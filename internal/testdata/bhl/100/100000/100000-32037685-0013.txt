PREFACE 

This volume is the outcome of a course of lectures, delivered at 
 Columbia University in the winter of 1892-93, in which I endeavoured 
 to give to an audience of general university students some account 
 of recent advances in cellular biology, and more especially to trace 
 the steps by which the problems of evolution have been reduced to 
 problems of the cell. It was my first intention to publish these 
 lectures in a simple and general form, in the hope of showing to 
 wider circles how the varied and apparently heterogeneous cell- 
 researches of the past twenty years have grown together in a 
 coherent group, at the heart of which are a few elementary phe- 
 nomena, and how these phenomena, easily intelligible even to those 
 having no special knowledge of the subject, are related to the 
 problems of development. Such a treatment was facilitated by 
 the appearance, in 1893, of Oscar Hertwig's invaluable book on 
 the cell, which brought together, in a form well designed for the 
 use of special students, many of the more important results of 
 modern cell-research. I am glad to acknowledge my debt to Hert- 
 wig's book ; but it is proper to state that the present volume was 
 fully sketched in its main outlines at the time the Zelle nnd Gcwcbe 
 appeared. Its completion was, however, long delayed by investiga- 
 tions which I undertook in order to re-examine the history of the 
 centrosomes in the fertilization of the ^g%, â€” a subject which had 
 been thrown into such confusion by Fol's extraordinary account of 
 the " Quadrille of Centres " in echinoderms that it seemed for a time 
 impossible to form any definite conception of the cell in its relation 
 to inheritance. By a fortunate coincidence the same task was inde- 
 pendently undertaken, nearly at the same time, by several other 
 investigators. The concordant results of these researches led to a 
 decisive overthrow of Fol's conclusions, and the way was thus cleared 
 for a return to the earlier and juster views founded by Hertwig, 
 Strasburger, and Van Benedcn, and so lucidly and forcibly developed 
 by Boveri. 

The rapid advance of discovery in the mean time has made it 
 seem desirable to amplify the original plan of the work, in order to 
 render it useful to students as well as to more general readers ; and 
 to this end it has been found necessary to go over a considerable
