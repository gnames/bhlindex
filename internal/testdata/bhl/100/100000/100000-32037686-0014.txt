viii PREFACE 

part of the ground already so well covered by Hertwig.^ This book 
 does not, however, in any manner aim to be a treatise on general 
 histology, or to give an exhaustive account of the cell. It has rather 
 been my endeavour to consider, within moderate limits, those features 
 of the cell that seem more important and suggestive to the student 
 of development, and in some measure to trace the steps by which. our 
 present knowledge has been acquired. A work thus limited neces- 
 sarily shows many gaps ; and some of these, especially on the botani- 
 cal side, are, I fear, but too obvious. On its historical side, too, the 
 subject could be traced only in its main outlines, and to many 
 investigators of whose results I have made use it has been impossible 
 to do full justice. 

To the purely speculative side of the subject I do not desire to 
 add more than is necessary to define some of the problems still to be 
 solved ; for I am mindful of Blumenbach's remark that while Drelin- 
 court rejected two hundred and sixty-two "groundless hypotheses" 
 of development, " nothing is more certain than that Drelincourt's 
 own theory formed the two hundred and sixty-third." ^ I have no 
 wish to add another to this list. And yet, even in a field where 
 standpoints are so rapidly shifting and existing views are still so 
 widely opposed, the conclusions of the individual observer may have 
 a certain value if they point the way to further investigation of the 
 facts. In this spirit I have endeavoured to examine some of the more 
 important existing views, to trace them to their sources, and in some 
 measure to give a critical estimate of their present standing, in the 
 hope of finding suggestion for further research. 

Every writer on the cell must find himself under a heavy obliga- 
 tion to the works of Van Beneden, Oscar Hertwig, Flemming, Stras- 
 burger, and Boveri ; and to the last-named author I have a special 
 sense of gratitude. I am much indebted to my former student, 
 Mr. A. P. Mathews, for calling my attention to the importance of 
 the recent work of physiological chemists in its bearing on the 
 problems of synthetic metabolism. The views developed in Chap- 
 ter VII. have been considerably influenced by his suggestions, and 
 this subject will be more fully treated by him in a forthcoming work ; 
 but I have endeavoured as far as possible to avoid anticipating his own 
 special conclusions. Among many others to whom I am indebted 
 for kindly suggestion and advice, I must particularly mention my 
 ever helpful friend. Professor Henry F. Osborn, and Professors 
 J. E. Humphrey, T. H. Morgan, and F. S. Lee.
