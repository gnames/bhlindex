PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION 

Since the appearance of the first edition of this work, in 1896, the 
 aspect of some of the most important questions with which it deals 
 has materially changed, most notably in case of those that are 
 focussed in the centrosome and involve the phenomena of cell-division 
 and fertilization. This has necessitated a complete revision of the 
 book, many sections having been entirely rewritten, while minor 
 changes have been made on almost every page. 

In its iirst form, the work was compressed within limits too nar- 
 row for a sufficiently critical treatment of many disputed subjects. It 
 has therefore been considerably enlarged, and upwards of fifty new 
 illustrations have been added. The endeavour has, however, still been 
 made to keep the book within moderate limits, even at some cost of 
 comprehensiveness ; and the present edition aims no more than did 
 the first to cover the whole vast field of cellular biology. Its limita- 
 tions are, as before, especially apparent in the field of botanical 
 cytology. Here progress has been so rapid that, apart from the dif- 
 ficulty experienced by a zoologist in the attempt to maintain a due 
 sense of proportion in reviewing the subject, an adequate treatment 
 would have required a separate volume. I have therefore, for the 
 most part, considered the cytology of plants in an incidental way, 
 endeavouring only to bring the more important phenomena into rela- 
 tion with those more fully considered in the case of animals. 

The steady and rapid expansion of the literature of the general 
 subject renders increasingly difficult the historical form of treatment 
 and the citation of specific authority in matters of detail. This plan 
 has nevertheless still been followed as far as possible, despite the 
 increased bulk of the book and the encumbrance of the text with 
 references thus occasioned, in the hope that these disadvantages- will 
 be outweighed by increased usefulness of the work. I beg the 
 reader to remember, however, that no approach to a complete history 
 of cytology and experimental embryology could be attempted, save 
 in a work of far greater proportions, and that it has been necessary
