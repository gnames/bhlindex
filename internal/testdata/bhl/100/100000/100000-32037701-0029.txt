During the half-century that has elapsed since the enunciation of 
 the cell-theory by Schleiden and Schwann, in 1838-39, it has become 
 ever more clearly apparent that the key to all ultimate biological 
 problems must, in the last analysis, be sought in the cell. It was the 
 cell-theory that first brought the structure of plants and animals under 
 one point of view, by revealing their common plan of organization. 
 It was through the cell-theory that Kdlliker, Remak, Nageli, and Hof- 
 meister opened the way to an understanding of the nature of embryo- 
 logical development, and the law of genetic continuity l3dng at the 
 basis of inheritance. It was the cell-theory again which, in the hands 
 of Goodsir, Virchow, and Max Schultze, inaugurated a new era in the 
 history of physiology and pathology, by showing that all the various 
 functions of the body, in health and in disease, are but the outward 
 expression of cell-activities. And at a still later day it was through 
 the cell-theory that Hertwig, Fol, Van Beneden, and Strasbarger 
 solved the long-standing riddle of the fertilization of the Q,g^ and the 
 mechanism of hereditary transmission. No other biological generali- 
 zation, save only the theory of organic evolution, has brought so many 
 apparently diverse phenomena under a common point of view or has 
 accomplished more for the unification of knowledge. The cell-theory 
 must therefore be placed beside the evolution-theory as one of the 
 foundation stones of modern biology. 

And yet the historian of latter-day biology cannot fail to be struck 
 with the fact that these two great generalizations, nearly related as 
 they are, have been developed along widely different lines of research, 
 and have only within a very recent period met upon a common ground. 
 The theory of evolution originally grew out of the study of natural 
 history, and it took definite shape long before the ultimate structure 
 of living bodies was in any degree comprehended. The evolutionists 
 of the Lamarckian period gave little heed to the finer details of 
 internal organization. They were concerned mainly with the more
