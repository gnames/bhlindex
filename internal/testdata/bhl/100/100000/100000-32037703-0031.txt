INTRODUCTION 3 

During the past thirty years the theory of organic descent has 
 been shown, by an overwhelming mass of evidence, to be the only 
 tenable conception of the origin of diverse living forms, however we 
 may conceive the causes of the process. While the study of general 
 zoology and botany has systematically set forth the results, and in a 
 measure the method, of organic evolution, the study. of microscopical

Fig. I. â€” A portion of the epidermis of a larval salamander {Amblystomd) as seen in slightly 
 oblique horizontal section, enlarged 550 diameters. Most of the cells are polygonal in form, con- 
 tain large nuclei, and are connected by delicate protoplasmic bridges. Above at is a branched, 
 dark pigment-cell that has crept up from the deeper layers and lies between the epidermal cells. 
 Three of the latter are undergoing division, the earliest stage {spireme) at a, a later stage (mitotic 
 figure in the anaphase) at b, showing the chromosomes, and a final stage {telophase), showing 
 fission of the cell-body, to the right. 

anatomy has shown us the nature of the material on which it has 
 operated, demonstrating that the obvious characters of plants and 
 animals are but varying expressions of a subtle interior organization 
 common to all. In its broader outlines the nature of this organiza- 
 tion is now accurately determined; and the "cell-theory," by which 
 it is formulated, is, therefore, no longer of an inferential or hypo-
