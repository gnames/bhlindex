In all the higher forms of life, whether plants or animals, the 
 body may be resolved into a vast host of minute structural units 
 known as cells, out of which, directly or indirectly, every part is 
 built (Figs. I, 2).. The substance of the skin, of the brain, of the blood, 
 of the bones or muscles or any other tissue, is not homogeneous, as it 
 appears to the unaided eye, but is shown by the microscope to be an 
 aggregate composed of innumerable minute bodies, as if it were a

colony or congeries of organisms more elementary than itself. The 
 name cells given to these bodies by the early botanists, and ulti- 
 mately adopted by nearly all students of microscopical anatomy, 
 was not happily chosen ; for modern studies have shown that although 
 the cell may assume the form of a hollow chamber, as the name 
 indicates, this is not one of its characteristic or even usual features. 
 Essentially the cell is a minute mass of protoplasfn, a substance long 
 since identified by Cohn, Leydig, Max Schultze, and De Bary as the 
 essential active basis of the organism, afterward happily characterized
