tance, made independently and almost simultaneously in 1884-85 by 
 Oscar Hertwig, Strasburger, Kolliker, and Weismann,^ while nearly 
 at the same time (1883) the splendid researches of Van Beneden on 
 the early history of the animal Q.gg opened possibilities of research 
 into the finer details of cell-phenomena of which the early workers 
 could hardly have dreamed. 

We can only appreciate the full historical significance of the new 
 period thus inaugurated by a glance at the earlier history of opinion 
 regarding embryological development and inheritance. To the modern 
 student the germ is, in Huxley's words, simply a detached living por- 
 tion of the substance of a preexisting living body ^ carrying with it a 
 definite structural organization characteristic of the species. By the 
 earlier embryologists, however, the matter was very differently re- 
 garded ; for their views in regard to inheritance were vitiated by their 
 acceptance of the Greek doctrine of the equivocal or spontaneous 
 generation of life ; and even Harvey did not escape this pitfall, near 
 as he came to the modern point of view. " The Qgg^ he says, " is 
 the mid-passage or transition stage between parents and offspring, 
 between those who are, or were, and those who are about to be ; 
 it is the hinge or pivot upon which the whole generation of the 
 bird revolves. The ^%^ is the terminus from which all fowls, male 
 and female, have sprung, and to which all their lives tend — it is the 
 result which nature has proposed to herself in their being. And 
 thus it comes that individuals in procreating their like for the sake 
 of their species, endure forever. The Qg%, I say, is a period or por- 
 tion of this eternity." ^ 

This passage appears at first sight to be a close approximation to 
 the modern doctrine of germinal continuity about which all theories 
 of heredity are revolving. In point of fact, however, Harvey's 
 view is only superficially similar to this doctrine ; for, as Huxley 
 pointed out, it was obscured by his belief that the germ might arise 
 "spontaneously," or through the influence of a mysterious '' calidiim 
 innatnm^' out of not-living matter."* Neither could Harvey, great 
 physiologist and embryologist as he was, have had any adequate con- 
 ception of the real nature of the egg and its morphological relation to 

1 It must not be forgotten that Ilaeckel expressed the same view in 1866 — only, how- 
 ever, as a speculation, since the data necessary to an inductive conclusion were not obtained 
 until long afterward. "The internal nucleus provides for the transmission of hereditary 
 characters, the external plasma on the other hand for accommodation or adaptation to the 
 external world" {Gen. Morplt., pp. 287-2S9).
