the body of which it forms a part, since the cellular structure of living 
 things was not comprehended until nearly two centuries later, the 
 spermatozoon was still undiscovered, and the nature of fertilization 
 was a subject of fantastic and baseless speculation. For a hundred 
 years after Harvey's time embryologists sought in vain to penetrate 
 the mysteries enveloping the beginning of the individual life, and 
 despite their failure the controversial writings of this period form one 
 of the most interesting chapters in the history of biology. By the 
 extreme " evolutionists " or " praeformationists " the Q.g% was believed 
 to contain an embryo fully formed in miniature, as the bud contains 
 the flower or the chrysalis the butterfly. Development was to them 
 merely the unfolding of that which already existed ; inheritance, the 
 handing down from parent to child of an infinitesimal reproduction 
 of its own body. It was the service of Bonnet to push this concep- 
 tion to its logical consequence, the theory of cmhoitement or encase- 
 ment, and thus to demonstrate the absurdity of its grosser forms, 
 pointing out that if the o.^^ contains a complete embryo, this must 
 itself contain eggs for the next generation, these other eggs in their 
 turn, and so ad infinitum, like an infinite series of boxes, one within 
 another — hence the term emboitement. Bonnet himself renounced 
 this doctrine in his later writings, and Caspar Friedrich Wolff (1759) 
 led the way in a return to the teachings of Harvey, showing by pre- 
 cise actual observation that the. egg does not at first contain any 
 formed embryo whatever ; that its structure is wholly different 
 from that of the adult; that development is not a mere process 
 of unfolding, but involves the continual formation, one after an- 
 other, of new parts, previously non-existent as such. This is some- 
 what as Harvey, himself following Aristotle, had conceived it — 
 a process of epigenesis as opposed to ezwhttioii. Later researches 
 established this conclusion as the very foundation of embryological 
 science. 

But although the external nature of development was thus deter- 
 mined, the actual structure of the Q.^g and the mechanism of inheri- 
 tance remained for nearly a century in the dark. It was reserved 
 for Schwann (1839) ^^d his immediate followers to recognize the 
 fact, conclusively demonstrated by all later researches, that tJie egg 
 is a cell having the same essential structure as other cells of the 
 body. And thus the wonderful truth became manifest that a single 
 cell may contain within its microscopic compass the sum-total of 
 the heritage of the species. This conclusion first reached in the 
 case of the female sex was soon afterward extended to the male 
 as well. Since the time of Leeuwenhoek (1677) it had been known 
 that the sperm or fertilizing fluid contained innumerable minute 
 bodies endowed in nearly all cases with the power of active move-
