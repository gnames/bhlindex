ment, and therefore regarded by the early observers as parasitic 
 animalcules or infusoria, a view which gave rise to the name sperma- 
 tozoa (sperm-animals) by which they are still generally known.^ As 
 long ago as 1786, however, it was shown by Spallanzani that the 
 fertilizing power must lie in the spermatozoa, not in the liquid in 
 which they swim, because the spermatic fluid loses its power when 
 filtered. Two years after the appearance of Schwann's epoch-mak- 
 ing work Kolliker demonstrated (1841) that the spermatozoa arise 
 directly from cells in the testis, and hence cannot be regarded as 
 parasites, but are, like the ovum, derived from the parent-body. Not 
 until 1865, however, was the final proof attained by Schweigger- 
 Seidel and La Valette St. George that the spermatozoon contains 
 not only a nucleus, as Kolliker believed, but also cytoplasm. It 
 was thus shown to be, lik-e the ^^^, a single cell, peculiarly modified 
 in structure, it is true, and of extraordinary minuteness, yet on the 
 whole morphologically equivalent to other cells. A final step was 
 taken ten years later (1875), when Oscar Hertwig established the 
 all-important fact that fertilization of the Q,g^ is accomplished by 
 its union with one spermatozoon, and one only. In sexual repro- 
 duction, therefore, each sex contributes a single cell of its own body 
 to the formation of the offspring, a fact which beautifully tallies 
 with the conclusion of Darwin and Galton that the sexes play, on 
 the whole, equal, though not identical parts in hereditary trans- 
 mission. The ultimate problems of sex, fertilization, inheritance, 
 and development were thus shown to be cell-problems. 

Meanwhile, during the years immediately following the announce- 
 ment of the cell-theory, the attention of investigators was especially 
 focussed upon the question : How do the cells of the body arise } 
 The origin of cells by the division of preexisting cells was clearly 
 recognized by Hugo von Mohl in 1835, though the full significance 
 of this epoch-making discovery was so obscured by the errrors of 
 Schleiden and Schwann that its full significance was only perceived 
 long afterward. The founders of the cell-theory were unfortunately 
 led to the conclusion that cells might arise in two different ways, viz. 
 either by division or fission of a preexisting mother-cell, or by " free 
 cell-formation," new cells arising in the latter case not from pre- 
 existing ones, but by crystallizing, as it were, out of a formative or 
 nutritive substance, termed the " cytoblastema " ; and they even 
 believed the latter process to be the usual and typical one. It 
 was only after many years of painstaking research that " free cell- 
 formation " was absolutely proved to be a myth, though manv of

 of Leeuwenhoek (1677), though Ilartsoeker afterward claimed the merit of having seen 
 them as early as 1674 (Dr. Allen Thomson).
