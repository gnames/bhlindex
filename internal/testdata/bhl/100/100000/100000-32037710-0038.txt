lO INTRODUCTION 

Schwann's immediate followers threw doubts upon it,^ and as early 
 as 1855 Virchow positively maintained the universality of cell-divi- 
 sion, contending that every cell is the offspring of a preexisting 
 parent-cell, and summing up in the since famous aphorism, " oninis 
 celliila e cellular'^ At the present day this conclusion rests upon a 
 foundation so firm that we are justified in regarding it as a universal 
 law of development. 

Now, if the cells of the body always arise by the division of pre- 
 existing cells, all must be traceable back to the fertilized egg-cell as 
 their common ancestor. Such is, in fact, the case in every plant and 
 animal whose development is accurately known. The first step in 
 development consists in the division of the o.^^ into two parts, each 
 of which is a cell, like the Qgg itself. The two then divide in turn to 
 form four, eight, sixteen, and so on in more or less regular progres- 
 sion (Fig. 4.) until step by step the ^g'g has split up into the multitude 
 of cells which build the body of the embryo, and finally of the adult. 
 This process, known as the cleavage or segmentation of the 0.%^, 
 was observed long before its meaning was understood. It seems to 
 have been first definitely described in the case of the frog's egg, by 
 Prevost and Dumas (1824), though earlier observers had seen it; but 
 at this time neither the t.gg nor its descendants were known to be 
 cells, and its true meaning was first clearly perceived by Bergmann, 
 Kolliker, Reichert, Von Baer, and Remak, some twenty years later. 
 The interpretation of cleavage as a process of cell-division was fol- 
 lowed by the demonstration that cell-division does not begin with 
 cleavage, but can be t7'aced back into tJie foregoing gejieration ; for the 
 egg-cell, as well as the sperm-cell, arises by the division of a cell pre- 
 existing in the parent-body. It is tJierefore derived by direct descent 
 from an egg-cell of the foregoing generation, aiid so on ad infinitnm. 
 Embryologists thus arrived at the conception so vividly set forth by 
 Virchow in 1858^ of an uninterrupted series of cell-divisions extend- 
 ing backward from existing plants and animals to that remote and 
 unknown period when vital organization assumed its present form. 
 Life is a continuous stream. The death of the individual involves no 
 breach of continuity in the series of cell-divisions by which the life 
 of the race flows onwards. The individual body dies, it is true, but 
 the germ-cells live on, carrying with them, as it were, the traditions 
 of the race from which they have sprung, and handing them on to 
 their descendants.
