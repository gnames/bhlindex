fers its hereditary tendencies from generation to generation, at first 
 unchanged, and always uninfluenced in any corresponding manner, 
 by that which happens during the Kfe of the individual which bears 
 it. If these views be correct, all our ideas upon the transformation 
 of species require thorough modification, for the whole principle of 
 evolution by means of exercise (use and disuse) as professed by La- 
 marck, and accepted in some cases by Darwin, entirely collapses " 
 {I.e., p. 69). 

It is impossible, he continues, that acquired traits should be trans- 
 mitted, for it is inconceivable that definite changes in the body, or 
 "soma," should so affect the protoplasm of the germ-cells as to cause 
 corresponding changes to appear in the offspring. How, he asks, 
 can the increased dexterity and power in the hand of a trained piano- 
 player so affect the molecular structure of the germ-cells as to pro- 
 duce a corresponding development in the hand of the child .'' It is 
 a physiological impossibility. If we turn to the facts, w^e find, Weis- 
 mann affirms, that not one of the asserted cases of transmission of 
 acquired characters will stand the test of rigid scientific scrutiny. It 
 is a reversal of the true point of view to regard inheritance as taking 
 place from the body of the parent to that of the child. The child 
 inherits from the parent germ-cell, not from the parent-body, and the 
 germ-cell owes its characteristics not to the body which bears it, but 
 to its descent from a preexisting germ-cell of the same kind. Thus 
 the body is, as it were, an offshoot from the germ-cell (Fig. 5). As

 (G) which separate from the soma and repeat the process in each successive generation. 

far as inheritance is concerned, the body is merely the carrier of the 
 germ-cells, which are held in trust for coming generations. 

Weismann's subsequent theories, built on this foundation, have 
 given rise to the most eagerly contested controversies of the post- 
 Darwinian period, and, whether they are to stand or fall, have played 
 a most important part in the progress of science. For aside from the 
 truth or error of his special theories, it has been Weismann's great 
 service to place the keystone between the work of the evolutionists 
 and that of the cytologists, and thus to bring the cell-theory and the
