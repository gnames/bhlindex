INTRODUCTION 

evolution-theory into organic connection. It is from the point of view 
 thus suggested that the present volume has been written. It has 
 accordingly not been my primary object to dwell on the minutice of 
 histology, still less to undertake an exhaustive description of all the 
 modifications of cell-structure and cell-action ; and for these the stu- 
 dent must refer to other and more extended treatises. Yet the broader 
 questions with which we have to deal cannot profitably be discussed 
 apart from the concrete phenomena by which they are suggested, and 
 hence a considerable part of the text is necessarily given over to 
 descriptive detail; but I hope that the reader will not lose sight of 
 the relation of the part to the whole, or forget the primary intention 
 of the work. 

We shall follow a convenient, rather than a strictly logical, order 
 of treatment, beginning in the first two chapters with a general sketch 
 of cell-structure and cell-division. The following three chapters deal 
 with the germ-cells, — the third with their structure and mode of 
 origin, the fourth with their union in fertilization, the fifth with the 
 phenomena of maturation by which they are prepared for their union. 
 The sixth chapter contains a critical discussion of cell-organization, 
 completing the morphological analysis of the cell. In the seventh 
 chapter the cell is considered with reference to its more fundamental 
 chemical and physiological properties as a prelude to the examination 
 of development which follows. The succeeding chapter approaches 
 the objective point of the book by considering the cleavage of the 
 ovum and the general laws of cell-division of which it is an expression. 
 The ninth chapter, finally, deals with the elementary operations of 
 development considered as cell-functions and with the theories of 
 inheritance and development based upon them.
