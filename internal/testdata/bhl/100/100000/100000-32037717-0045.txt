GENERAL SKETCH OF THE CELL 

" Wir haben gesehen, dass alle Organismen aus wesentlich gleichen Theilen, namlich aus 
 Zellen zusammengesetzt sind, dass diese Zellen nach wesentlich denselben Gesetzen sich 
 bilden und wachsen, dass also diese Prozesse iiberall auch durch dieselben Krafte hervorge- 
 bracht werden miissen." Schwann.^ 

In the passage quoted above Schwann expressed a truth which 
 subsequent research has estabhshed on an ever widening basis ; and 
 we have now more than ever reason to believe that despite unending 
 diversity of form and function all cells may be brought into definite 
 relation to a common morphological and physiological type. We are, 
 it is true, still unable to specify all its essential features, and hence 
 can give no adequate brief definition of the cell. For practical pur- 
 poses, however, no such definition is needed, and we may be content 
 with the simple type that has been familiar to histologists since the 
 time of Leydig and Max Schultze. 

It should from the outset be clearly recognized that the term 
 "cell" is a biological misnomer; for cells only rarely assume the 
 form implied by the word of hollow chambers surrounded by solid 
 wails. The term is merely an historical survival of a word casually 
 employed by the botanists of the seventeenth century to designate 
 the cells of certain plant-tissues which, when viewed in section, give 
 somewhat the appearance of a honeycomb.^ The cells of these tis- 
 sues are, in fact, separated by conspicuous solid walls which were 
 mistaken by Schleiden, followed by Schwann, for their essential part. 
 The living substance contained within the walls, to which Hugo von 
 Mohl gave the name protoplasm"^ (1846), was at first overlooked or 
 was regarded as a waste-product, a view based upon the fact that in 
 many important plant-tissues such as cork or wood it may wholly 
 disappear, leaving only the lifeless walls. The researches of Berg- 
 mann, Kolliker, Bischoff, Cohn, Max Schultze, and many others

- The word seems to have been first employed by Robert Hooke, in 1665, to designate 
 the minute cavities observed in cork, a tissue which he described as made up of " little 
 boxes or cells distinct from one another " and separated by solid walls. 

^ The same word had been used by Purkinje some years before (1840) to designate the 
 formative material of young animal embryos.
