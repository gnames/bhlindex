1 8 GENERAL SKETCH OF THE CELL 

showed, however, that most hving cells are not hollow but solid 
 bodies, and that in many cases — for example, the colourless corpuscles 
 of blood and lymph — they are naked masses of protoplasm not sur- 
 rounded by definite walls. Thus it was proved that neither the 
 vesicular form nor the presence of surrounding walls is an essential 
 character, and that the cell-contents, i.e. the protoplasm, must be the 
 seat of vital activity. 

Within the protoplasm (Figs. 6-Z) lies a body, usually of definite 
 rounded form, known as the nucleus} and this in turn often contains 

Attraction-sphere enclosing two centrosomes.

one or more smaller bodies or nucleoli. By some of the earlier 
 workers the nucleus was supposed to be, like the cell-wall, of sec- 
 ondary importance, and many forms of cells were described as being 
 devoid of a nucleus ("cytodes" of Haeckel). Nearly all later re- 
 searches have indicated, however, that the characteristic nuclear 
 material, whether forming a single body or scattered in smaller 
 masses, is always present, and that it plays an essential part in the 
 life of the cell. 

• Besides the presence of protoplasm and nucleus, no other struc- 
 tural features of the cell are yet known to be of universal occurrence.
