GENERAL MORPHOLOGY OF THE CELL

We may therefore still accept as valid the definition given more than 
 thirty years ago by Leydig and Max Schultze, that a cell is a mass 
 of protoplasm containing a n-ucleus} to which we may add Schultze's 
 statement that botJi niicleiis and protoplasm arise throngh the division 
 of the corresponding elements of a preexistijig cell. Nothing could be 
 less appropriate than to call such a body a " cell " ; yet the word has 
 become so firmly established that every effort to replace it by a 
 better has failed, and it probably must be accepted as part of the 
 established nomenclature of science.^ 

A. General Morphology of the Cell 

The cell is a rounded mass of protoplasm which in its simplest 
 form is approximately spherical. The form is, however, seldom 
 realized save in isolated cells such as the unicellular plants and ani- 
 mals or the egg-cells of the higher forms. In vastly the greater 
 number of cases the typical spherical form is modified by unequal 
 growth and differentiation, by active movements of the cell-substance, 
 or by the mechanical pressure of surrounding structures, but true 
 angular forms are rarely if ever assumed save by cells surrounded by 
 hard walls. The protoplasm which forms its active basis is a viscid, 
 translucent substance, sometimes apparently homogeneous, more fre- 
 quently finely granular, and as a rule giving the appearance of a 
 mesh work, which is often described as a spongelike or netlike " reticu- 
 lum."'^ Besides the active substance or protoplasm proper the cell 
 almost invariably contains various lifeless bodies suspended in the 
 meshes of the network ; examples of these are food-granules, pig- 
 ment-bodies, drops of oil or water, and excretory matters. These 
 bodies play a relatively passive part in the activities of the cell, 
 being either reserve food-matters destined to be absorbed and built 
 up into the living substance, or by-products formed from the proto- 
 plasm as waste-matters or in order to play some role subsidiary to 
 the actions of the protoplasm itself. The passive inclusions in the 
 protoplasm may be collectively designated as nictaplasui (Hanstein) 
 ox paraplasm (Kupffer), in contradistinction to the 2.ct\\e protoplasm.

"^ Sachs has proposed the convenient word energid (^Flora, '92, p. 57) to designate the 
 essential living part of the cell, i.e. the nucleus with that portion of the active cytoplasm 
 that falls within its sphere of influence, the two forming an organic unit both in a morpho- 
 logical and in a physiological sense. It is to be regretted that this convenient and appro- 
 priate term has not come into general use. (See also Flora, '95, p. 405, and cf. Kupffer 
 ('96), Meyer ('96), and Kolliker ('97).) 

^ Such meshworks are sometimes plainly visible in the living protoplasm (p. 44). It is 
 always more or less an open question how far the appearances seen in fixed (coagulated) 
 material correspond with the conditions existing in life. See pp. 42-46.
