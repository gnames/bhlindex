GENERAL SKETCH OF THE CELL 

It is often difficult to distinguish between such metaplasmic bodies 
 and the granules commonly supposed to be elements of the active 
 protoplasm ; indeed, as will appear beyond (p. 29), there is reason 
 to believe that "protoplasmic" and "metaplasmic" granules cannot 
 be separated by any definite limit, but are connected by various 
 gradations. Among the lifeless products of the protoplasm must be 
 reckoned also the cell-wall or membrane by which the cell-body may

 each cell an attraction-sphere with two centrosomes. Below, three contiguous spermatogonia,

be surrounded ; but it must be remembered that the cell-wall in some 
 cases arises by a direct transformation of the protoplasmic substance, 
 and that it often retains the power of growth by intussusception like 
 living matter. 

It is unfortunate that some confusion has arisen in the use of the 
 word protoplasm. When Ley dig, Schultze, Briicke, De Bary, and 
 other earlier writers spoke of " protoplasm," they had in mind only 
 the substance of the cell-body, not that of the nucleus. Strasburger,
