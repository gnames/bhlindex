22 GENERAL SKETCH OF THE CELL 

Kolliker, etc.) in its original narrower sense (equivalent to Stras>. 
 burger's cytoplasm), while perhaps the majority of writers have 
 accepted the terminology of Strasburger and Flemming. On the 
 whole, the terms cytoplasm and karyoplasm seem too useful to be 
 rejected, and, without attaching too much importance to them, they 
 will be employed throughout the present work. It must not, how- 
 ever, be supposed that either of the words denotes a single homo- 
 geneous substance ; for, as will soon appear, both cytoplasm and 
 karyoplasm consist of several distinct elements. 

The nucleus is usually bounded by a definite membrane, and often 
 appears to be a perfectly distinct vesicular body suspended in the 
 cytoplasm — a conclusion sustained by the fact that it may move 
 actively through the latter, as often occurs in both vegetable and 
 animal cells. Careful study of the nucleus during all its phases gives, 
 however, reason to believe that its structural basis is similar to that 
 of the cell-body ; and that during the course of cell-division, when 
 the nuclear membrane usually disappears, cytoplasm and karyoplasm 
 come into direct continuity. Even in the resting cell there is good 
 evidence that both the intranuclear and the extranuclear material may 
 be structurally continuous with the nuclear membrane^ and among the 
 Protozoa there are forms (some of the flagellates) in which no nuclear 
 membrane can at any period be seen. For these and other reasons 
 the terms "■nucleus'' and ''cell-body" shonld probably be regarded as 
 only topographical expressions denoting tivo differentiated areas in a 
 common structural basis. The terms karyoplasm and cytoplasm possess, 
 however, a specific significance owing to the fact that there is on 
 the whole a definite chemical contrast between the nuclear substance 
 and that of the cell-body, the former being characterized by the 
 abundance of a substance rich in phosphorus known as 7i2iclein, while 
 the latter contains no true nuclein and is especially rich in albuminous 
 substances such as nucleo-albumins, albumins, globulins, and the Hke, 
 which contain little or no phosphorus. 

' Both morphologically and physiologically the differentiation of the 
 active cell-substance into nucleus and cell-body must be regarded as a 
 fundamental character of the cell because of its universal, or all but 
 universal, occurrence, and because there is reason to believe that it is 
 in some manner an expression of the dual aspect of the fundamental 
 process of metabolism, constructive and destructive, that lies at the 
 iDasis of cell life. The view has been widely held that a third essen- 
 tial element is the centrosome, discovered by Flemming and Van 
 Beneden in 1875-76, and since shown to exist in a large number of 
 other cells (Figs. 7, 8). This is an extremely minute body which 

1 Conklin ('97, i), Obst ('99), and some others have described a direct continuity in the 
 restinc cell between the intranuclear and extranuclear ineshworks.
