STRUCTURAL BASIS OF PROTOPLASM 23 

is concerned in the process of cell-division and in the fertilization of 
 the Qgg, and has been characterized as the "dynamic centre" of the 
 cell. Whether it has such a significance, and whether it is in point 
 of morphological persistence comparable with the nucleus, are ques- 
 tions still sicb judice, which will be discussed elsewhere.^ 

B. Structural Basis of Protoplasm 

As ordinarily seen under moderate powers of the microscope, proto- 
 plasm appears as a more or less vague granular substance which 
 shows as a rule no definite structure organization. More precise 
 examination under high powers, especially after treatment by suitable 
 fixing and staining reagents, often reveals a highly complex structure 
 in both nucleus and cytoplasm. Since the fundamental activities of 
 protoplasm are everywhere of the same nature, investigators have 
 naturally sought to discover a corresponding fundamental morpho- 
 logical organization common to all forms of protoplasm and under- 
 lying all of its special modifications. Up to the present time, however, 
 these attempts have not resulted in any consensus of opinion as to 
 whether such a common organization exists. In many forms of proto- 
 plasm, both in life and after fixation by reagents, the basis of the 
 structure is a more or less regular framework or meshwork, consisting 
 of at least two substances. One of these forms the substance of the 
 meshwork proper; the other, often called the givund- sub stance (also 
 cell-sap, enchylema, hyaloplasma, paramitome, interfilar substance, 
 etc.), 2 occupies the intervening spaces. To these two elements must 
 be added minute, deeply staining granules or " microsomes " scattered 
 along the branches of the meshwork, sometimes quite irregularly, 
 sometimes with such regularity that the meshwork seems to be built 
 of them. Besides the foregoing three elements, which we may pro- 
 visionally regard as constituting the active substance, the protoplasm 
 almost invariably contains various passive or metaplasmic substances 
 in the form of larger granules, drops of liquid, crystalloid bodies, and 
 the like. These bodies, which usually lie in the spaces of the mesh- 
 work, are often difficult to distinguish from the microsomes lying in 
 the meshwork proper â€” indeed, it is by no means certain that any 
 adequate ground of distinction exists.^ 

From the time of Frommann and Arnold ('65-67) onwards, most 
 of the earlier observers regarded the meshwork as a fibrillar structure, 
 either forming a continuous network or reticulnvi somewhat like the 
 fibrous network of a sponge (" reticular theory " of Klein, Van Bene- 
 den, Carnoy, Heitzmann), or consisting of disconnected threads,
