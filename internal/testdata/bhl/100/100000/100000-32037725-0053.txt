STRUCTURAL BASIS OF PROTOPLASM 25 

whether simple or branching ("filar theory" of Flemming), and the 
 same view is widely held at the present time. The meshwork has 
 received various names in accordance with this conception, among 
 which may be mentioned reticidiini, thread-work, spongioplasni, viitome, 
 filar substance,^ all of which are still in use. Under this view the 
 "granules" described by Schultze, Virchow and still earlier observers 
 have been variously regarded as nodes of the network, optical sec- 
 tions of the threads, or as actual granules (" microsomes ") suspended 
 in the network as described above. 

Widely opposed to these views is the " alveolar theory " of Biitschli, 
 which has won an increasing number of adherents. Biitschli regards 
 protoplasm as having a foam-like alveolar structure ("Waben- 
 struktur "), nearly similar to that of an emulsion (Fig. 10), and he 
 has shown in a series of beautiful experiments that artificial emul- 
 sions, variously prepared, may show under the microscope a marvel- 
 lously close resemblance to hving protoplasm, and further that drops 
 of oil-emulsion suspended in water may even exhibit amoeboid changes 
 of form. To restate Biitschli's view, protoplasm consists of separate, 
 closely crowded minute drops^ of a liquid alveolar substance suspended 
 in a continuous interalveolar substance, likewise liquid, but of different 
 physical nature. The latter thus forms the walls of closed chambers 
 or alveoli in which the alveolar drops lie, just as in a fine emulsion 
 the emulsifying liquid surrounds the emulsified drops. The appear- 
 ance of a network in protoplasm is illusory, being due to optical sec- 
 tion of the interalveolar walls or partitions as viewed at any given 
 focus of the microscope. As thus seen, the walls themselves appear 
 as fibres, while the "spaces of the network" are in like manner opti- 
 cal sections of the alveoH, the alveolar substance that fills them 
 corresponding to the "ground substance." As explained beyond,^ 
 Biitschli interprets in like manner the radiating systems or asters 
 formed during cell-divison, the astral rays (usually considered as 
 fibres) being regarded as merely the septa between radially arranged 
 alveoli (Fig. 10). 

The two (three) general views above outlined may be designated 
 respectively as the fibrillar (reticular or filar) and alveolar theories 
 of protoplasmic structure ; and each of them has been believed by 
 some of its adherents to be universally applicable to all forms of 
 protoplasm. Beside them may be placed, as a third general view, 
 the granular theory especially associated with the name of Altmann, 
 by whom it has been most fully developed, though a number of 
 earlier writers have held similar views. According to Altmann's 
 view, which apart from its theoretical development approaches in
