made.i On the whole, the present drift of opinion is toward the 
 conclusion that none of the above interpretations has succeeded in 
 the attempt to give a universal formula for protoplasmic structure ; 
 and many recent observers have reached the conclusion, earlier advo- 
 cated by Kolhker ('89), that the various types described above are 
 connected by intermediate gradations and may be transformed one 
 into another, in different phases of cell-activity. Unna ('95), for 
 example, endeavours to show how an alveolar structure may pass into 
 a sponge-like or reticular one by the breaking down of the inter-

alveolar walls. Flemming, for many years the foremost and most 
 consistent advocate of the fibrillar theory, now admits that protoplasm 
 may be fibrillar, alveolar, granular, or sensibly homogeneous,^ and 
 that we cannot, therefore, regard any one of these types of structure 
 as absolutely diagnostic of the living substance. In plant-cells 
 Strasburger^ and a number of his pupils maintain that the "kino- 
 plasm" (p. 322) or filar plasm, from which the spindle-fibres and 
 astral rays are formed, is fibrillar, while the " trophoplasm " or 
 alveolar plasm forming the main body of the cell is alveolar, the 
 former, however, assuming the fibrillar structure, as a rule, onlv 
 during the mitotic activity of the cell. My own long-continued 
 studies on various forms of protoplasm have likewise led to the con- 
 clusion that no universal formula for protoplasmic structure can be
