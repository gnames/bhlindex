given. 1 In that classical object, the echinoderm-egg, for example, 
 it is easy to satisfy oneself, both in the living cell and in sections, 
 that the protoplasm has a beautiful alveolar structure, exactly as 
 described by Biitschh in the same object (Fig. ii). This structure 
 is here, however, entirely of secondary origin ; for its genesis can 
 be traced step by step during the growth of the ovarian eggs through 
 the deposit of minute drops in a homogeneous basis, which ultimately 
 gives rise to the interalveolar walls. In these same eggs the astral 
 systems formed during their subsequent division (Fig. 12) are, I

believe, no less certainly fibrillar ; and thus we see the protoplasm 
 of the same cell passing successively through homogeneous, alveolar, 
 and fibrillar phases, at different periods of growth and in different 
 conditions of physiological activity. There is good reason to regard 
 this as typical of protoplasm in general. Biitschli's conclusions, 
 based on researches so thorough, prolonged, and ingenious, are 
 entitled to great weight ; yet it is impossible to resist the evidence 
 that fibrillar and granular as well as alveolar structures are of wide 
 occurrence ; and while each may be characteristic of certain kinds of
