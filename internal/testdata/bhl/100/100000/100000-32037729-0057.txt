STRUCTURAL BASIS OF PROTOPLASM 29 

cells, or of certain physiological conditions,^ none is common to all 
 forms of protoplasm. If this position be well grounded, we must 
 admit that the attempt to find in visible protoplasmic structure any- 
 adequate insight into its fundamental modes of physiological activity 
 has thus far proved fruitless. We must rather seek the source of 
 these activities in the ultramicroscopical organization, accepting the 
 probability that apparently homogeneous protoplasm is a complex 
 mixture of substances which may assume various forms of visible 
 structure according to its modes of activity. 

Some of the theoretical speculations regarding the essential nature 
 of that organization are discussed in Chapter VI.,but one quasiAho-o- 
 retical point must be here considered. Much discussion has been 
 given to the question as to which of the visible elements of the proto- 
 plasm should be regarded as the "living" substance proper; and the 
 diversity of opinion on this subject may be judged by the fact that 
 although many of the earlier observers identified the "reticulum" as 
 the living element, and the ground-substance as hfeless, others, such 
 as Leydig and Schafer, held exactly the reverse view, while Altmann 
 insisted that only the " granules " were alive. Later discussions have 
 shown the futility of this discussion, which is indeed largely a verbal 
 one, turning as it does on the sense of the word "living." In practice 
 we continually use the word "living" to denote various degrees of 
 vital activity. Protoplasm deprived of nuclear matter has lost, wholly 
 or in part, one of the most characteristic vital properties, namely, the 
 power of synthetic metabolism ; yet we still speak of it as " living," 
 since it still retains for a longer or shorter period such properties 
 as irritability and the power of coordinated movement ; and, in like 
 manner, various special elements of protoplasm may be termed " liv- 
 ing " in a still more restricted sense. In its fullest meaning, however, 
 the word " living " implies the existence of a group of cooperating 
 activities more complex than those manifested by any one substance 
 or structural element. I am therefore entirely in accord with the 
 view urged by Sachs, Kolliker, Verworn, and other recent writers, 
 that life can only be properly regarded as a property of the cell- 
 system as a whole ; and the separate elements of the system would, 
 with Sachs, better be designated as "active" or "passive," rather 
 than as "living" or "lifeless." Thus regarded, the distinction 

^ Thus the alveolar structure seems to be characteristic of Protozoa in general, and of 
 the protoplasm of plant-cells when in the vegetative state, the fibrillar of nerve-cells and 
 muscle-cells. The granular type is characteristic of some forms of leucocytes and gland- 
 cells; but many of the granules in these cells are no doubt metaplasmic, and it is further 
 very doubtful whether such a granular or "pseudo-alveolar" structure can be logicallv dis- 
 tinguished from an alveolar (^cf. Wilson, '99). In the pancreas-cell granular and fibrillar 
 structures alternate with the varying phases of secretory activity {cf. Mathews, '99).
