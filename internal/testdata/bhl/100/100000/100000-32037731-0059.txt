THE NUCLEUS 3 1 

centre of cell-activity, and hence a primary factor in growth, develop- 
 ment, and the transmission of specific qualities from cell to cell, and 
 so from one generation to another.

The cell-nucleus passes through two widely different phases, one of 
 which is characteristic of cells in their ordinary or vegetative condi- 
 tion, while the other only occurs during the complicated changes 
 involved in cell-division. In the first phase, falsely characterized as 
 the "resting state," the nucleus usually appears as a rounded sac-like 
 body surrounded by a distinct membrane and containing a conspicu- 
 ous irregular network (Figs. 6, 7, 13), which is in some cases plainly 
 visible in the living cell (Fig. 9). The form of the nucleus, though 
 subject to variation, is on the whole singularly constant, and as a rule 
 shows no very definite relation to that of the cell-body, though in elon- 
 gated cells such as m_uscle-cells, in certain forms of parenchyma, 
 and in epithelial cells (Fig. 49), the nucleus is itself often elongated. 
 Typically spherical, it may, in certain cases, assume an irregular or 
 amoeboid form, may break up into a group of more or less completely 
 separated lobes (polymorphic nuclei, Fig. 49), sometimes forming an 
 irregular ring (" ring-nuclei " of leucocytes, giant-cells, etc.. Fig. 14, D). 
 It is usually very large in gland-cells and others that show a very 
 active metabolism, and in such cases its surface is sometimes increased 
 by the formation of complex branches ramifying through the cell 
 (Fig. 14, E). 

These forms seem in general to be fairly constant in a given species 
 of cell, but in a large number of cases the nucleus has been seen in 
 the living cell (cartilage-cells, leucocytes, ova) to undergo more or less 
 active changes of form, sometimes so marked as to merit the name of 
 amoeboid (Fig. yy). Perhaps the most remarkable deviations from the 
 usual type of nucleus occur among the unicellular forms. In the cili- 
 ate Infusoria the nuclei are massive bodies of two kinds, viz. a large 
 macronuclc7is and one or more smaller viicronnclei, both of which are 
 present in the same cell, the former kind being generally regarded as 
 the active nucleus, the latter as a reserve nucleus from which at cer- 
 tain periods new macronuclei arise (p. 224). The macronuclei show a 
 remarkable diversity of form and structure in different species. Still 
 more interesting are the so-called scattered or distributed nuclei, de- 
 scribed by Biitschli in flagellates and Bacteria, by Gruber in certain 
 rhizopods and Infusoria, and by several authors in the Cyanophyceas 
 (Figs. 15, 16). The nuclear material is here apparently scattered 
 through the cell in the form of numerous minute, deeply stained gran- 
 ules, which, if this identification is correct, represent the most primi-
