GENERAL SKETCH OF THE CELL 

tive known types of nucleus; but this subject is still stib jndice 
 (p. 39). A transition from this condition to nuclei of the ordinary- 
 type appears to be given in the nuclei of certain flagellates (e.g. Chi- 
 lonionas and T7'achelnionas\ where the chromatin-granules are aggre- 
 gated about a nucleolus-like body, but are not enclosed by a membrane.^ 
 In considering the structure of the nucleus, as seen in sections, we 
 must, as in the case of the cytoplasm, bear in mind the possibility, or 

rather probability, that some of 
 the elements described may be 
 coagulation - products ; for the 
 nucleus is in life composed of 
 liquid or semi-liquid substance, 
 and Albrecht ('99) has recently 
 shown that nuclei isolated in the 
 fresh condition will flow together 
 to form a single body. Most of 
 the main features of the nucleus, 
 both in the resting and in the 
 dividing phases, have, however, 
 been seen in life (Fig. 9), and the 
 principal danger of mistaking 
 artifacts for normal structures re- 
 lates to the finer elements, con- 
 sidered beyond. 

In the ordinary forms of nuclei 
 in their resting state the follow- 
 ing structural elements may as a 
 rule be distinguished (Figs. 6, 7,

b. The nuclear reticulum. This, the most essential part of the 
 nucleus, forms an irregular branching network or reticulum which con- 
 sists of two very different constituents. The first of these, forming the 
 general protoplasmic basis of the nucleus, is a substance known as linin
