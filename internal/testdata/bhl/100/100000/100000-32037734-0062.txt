GENERAL SKETCH OF THE CELL 

that of the subcutaneous gland-cells of Pisciola, the nuclei of which 
 contain in early phases of secretion but a single nucleolus. During 
 growth of the cell the nucleolus fragments, finally giving rise to 
 several hundred nucleoli which then appear to migrate out into the 
 cytoplasm, leaving but a single nucleolus to repeat the cycle.^ 

The bodies known as nucleoli are of at least two different kinds. 
 The first of these, the so-called true nucleoli or plasmosomes (Figs. 6, 
 8, B, 13), are of spherical form, and are shown by the staining 
 reactions to differ widely from chromatin, being in general sharply 
 stained by dyes which, like eosin, orange or acid fuchsin, stain the 
 linin and the general cytoplasm. The plasmosomes sometimes seem 
 to have no envelope, but in many cases {e.g. in leucocytes) are 
 surrounded by a thin layer that stains like chromatin. Nucleoli of a 
 quite different type are the "net-knots" (Netzknoten), chromatin- 
 nucleoli, or karyosomes, which agree in staining reaction with chro- 
 matin and are doubtless to be regarded as merely a portion of the 
 chromatin-network (Figs. 8, 49). These are sometimes spherical, 
 more often irregular (Fig. 8), and often are hardly to be distinguished, 
 except in size, from nodes of the chromatin-reticulum.^ The relations 
 between these two forms of nucleoli are far from certain, and the 
 variations in staining reaction shown by true nucleoli render it not 
 improbable that intermediate forms exist which may represent an 
 actual transition from one to the other.^ In many of the Protozoa, 
 as described beyond, the "nucleolus" is -shown by its behaviour 
 during mitosis to be comparable with an attraction-sphere or centro- 
 some {" nucleolo-centrosome," Keuten); and even in higher forms 
 there are some cells in which the centrosome is intranuclear 
 (Fig. 148). 

There is good reason to believe that the chromatin-nucleoli are 
 merely more condensed portions of the chromatin-network, since 
 during cell-division they have the same history as the remaining 
 portion of the chromatin-substance.'^ The nature of the true nucleoli 
 is still imperfectly known. By some observers, including Flemming, 
 O. and R. Hertwig, and Carnoy, they have been regarded as store- 
 houses of material (para-nuclein, plastin) which contributes to the

2 Flemming first called attention to the chemical difference between the true nucleoli and 
 the chromatic reticulum ('82, pp. 138, 163) in animal-cells, and Zacharias soon afterward 
 studied more closely the difference of staining reaction in plant-cells, showing that the 
 former are especially coloured by alkaline carmine solutions, the latter by acid solutions. 
 Other studies by Carnoy, Zacharias, Ogata, Rosen, Schwarz, Heidenhain, and many others 
 show that the medullary substance (pyrenin) of true nuclei is coloured by acid tar-colours and 
 other plasma stains, while the chromatin has a special affinity for basic dyes. Cf. p. 337.
