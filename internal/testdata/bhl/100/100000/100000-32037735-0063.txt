 active role in the nuclear activity. Strasburger ( '95) likewise be- 
 lieves them to contain a store of active material which, however, has 
 no direct relation to the chromosomes but consists of " kinoplasm "

A. Permanent spireme-nucleus, salivary gland of Chironomus larva. Chromatin in a single 
 thread, composed of chromatin-discs (chromomeres), terminating at each end in a true nucleolus 
 or plasmosoine. [Balbiani.] 

B. Permanent spireme-nuclei, intestinal epithelium of dipterous larva Pfy'chcptcra. [Van 
 Gehuchten.] C. The same, side view. 

D. Polymorphic ring-nucleus, giant-cell of bone-marrow of the rabbit; c. a group of centro- 
 somes or centrioles. [Heidenhain.] 

E. Branching nucleus, spinning gland of butterfly-larva {Pieris). [KORSCHELT.]

 observers regard the nucleolar material as a passive by-product of 
 the chromatin-activity destined to be absorbed by the active sub-
