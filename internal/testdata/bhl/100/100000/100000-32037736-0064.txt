36 GENERAL SKETCH OF THE CELL 

stances. This is supported by the fact that in some forms of mitosis 
 the nucleolus is at the time of division actually cast out of the 
 nucleus into the cytoplasm, where it degenerates without further 
 apparent function. This seems to constitute decisive evidence in 
 support of Hacker's view as applied to certain cases ; but without 
 further evidence it must remain doubtful whether it applies to 
 all.i 

d. The gr'onnd-sitb stance, nuclear sap, or karyolympJi, a clear sub- 
 stance occupying the interspaces of the network and left unstained 
 by most of the dyes that colour the chromatin, the linin, or the plas- 
 mosomes. By most observers the ground-substance is regarded as a 
 liquid filling a more or less completely continuous space traversed by 
 the nuclear network. By Biitschli, however, and some of his fol- 
 lowers the nucleus is regarded as an alveolar structure, the walls of 
 which represent the "network," while the ground-substance corre- 
 sponds to the alveolar material. Nearly related with this is the view 
 of Reinke ( '94) that the ground-substance consists of large pale 
 granules of " lanthanin " or "oedematin." 

The configuration of the chromatic network varies greatly in dif- 
 ferent cases. It is sometimes of a very loose and open character, 
 as in many epithelial cells (Fig. i); sometimes extremely coarse and 
 irregular, as in leucocytes (Fig. 49); sometimes so compact as to 
 appear nearly or quite homogeneous, as in the nuclei of spermatozoa 
 and in many Protozoa. In some cases the chromatin does not form 
 a network, but appears in the form of a thread closely similar to the 
 spireme-stage of dividing nuclei {cf. p. 65). The most striking case 
 of this kind occurs in the salivary glands of dipterous larvae {Chirono- 
 miis), where, as described by Balbiani, the chromatin has the form of 
 a single convoluted thread, composed of transverse discs and termi- 
 nating at each end in a large nucleolus (Fig. 14, A). Somewhat simi- 
 lar nuclei (Fig. 14, B) occur in various epithelial cells of other insects 
 (Van Gehuchten, Gilson), and also in the young ovarian eggs of cer- 
 tain animals {cf. p. 273). In certain gland-cells of the marine isopod 
 Anilocra it is arranged in regular rosettes (Vom Rath). Rabl, fol- 
 lowed by Van Gehuchten, Heidenhain, and others, has endeavoured 
 to show that the nuclear network shows a distinct polarity, the 
 nucleus having a " pole " toward which the principal chromatin- 
 threads converge, and near which the centrosome lies.^ In many 
 nuclei, however, no trace of such polarity can be discerned. 

The network may undergo great changes both in physical con- 
 figuration and in staining capacity at different periods in the life 
 of the same cell, and the actual amount of chromatin fluctuates, 
 sometimes to an enormous extent. Embryonic cells are in general
