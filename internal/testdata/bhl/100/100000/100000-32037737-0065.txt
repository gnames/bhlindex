characterized by the large size of the nucleus ; and Zacharias has 
 shown in the case of plants that the nuclei of meristem and other 
 embryonic tissues are not only relatively large, but contain a larger 
 percentage of chromatin than in later stages. The relation of these 
 changes to the physiological activity of the nucleus is still imperfectly 
 understood.^ 

2. Finer Structure of the Nucleus 

A considerable number of observers 
 have raised the question whether the 
 nuclear structures may not be regarded 
 as aggregates of more elementary 
 morphological bodies, though there is 
 still no general agreement regarding 
 their nature and relationships. The 
 most definite evidence in this direction 
 relates to the chromatic network. In 
 the stages preparatory to division this 
 network resolves itself into a definite 
 number of rod-shaped bodies known 
 as chromosomes (Fig. 21), which split 
 lengthwise as the cell divides. These 
 bodies arise as aggregations of minute 
 rounded bodies or microsomes to which 
 various names have been given (r//;v;w^- 
 meres, Fol ; ids, Weismann). They 
 are as a rule most clearly visible and 
 most regularly arranged during cell- 
 division, when the chromatin is ar- 
 ranged in a thread {spireme), or in 
 separate chromosovies (Figs. 8, D, 53, 
 B); but in many cases they are dis- 
 tinctly visible in the reticulum of the 
 "resting" nucleus (Fig. 54). It is, 
 however, an open question whether the chromatin-granules of the 
 reticulum are individually identical with those forming the chromo- 
 somes or the spireme-thread. The larger masses of the reticu-

^ Both chromatin-granules and nucleoli have been seen in a considerable number of living 
 cells (Fig. 9). Favourable objects for this purpose are according to Korschelt ('96) the sillc- 
 glands of caterpillars, where the whole nucleus may be seen to be tilled with fine granules 
 ("microsomes"), among which are scattered many larger granules (" macrosomes''). The 
 later studies of Meves ('97, l) make it probable that the latter are true nucleoli and the for- 
 mer chromatin-granules. Korschelt, however, regards the " macrosomes " as composed of 
 chromatin and the " microsomes " as representing the so-called " achromatic substance."
