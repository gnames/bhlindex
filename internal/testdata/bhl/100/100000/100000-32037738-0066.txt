GENERAL SKETCH OF THE CELL 

lum undoubtedly represent aggregations of such granules, but whether 
 the latter completely fuse or remain always distinct is unknown. 
 Even the chromosomes at certain stages appear perfectly homoge- 
 neous, and the same is sometimes true of the entire nucleus, as in the 
 spermatozoon. It is nevertheless possible that the chromatin-gran- 
 ules have a persistent identity and are to be regarded as morpho- 
 logical units of which the chromatin is built up.^ 

Heidenhain ('93, '94), whose views have been accepted by Reinke, 
 Waldeyer, and others, has shown that the " achromatic " nuclear net- 
 work is likewise composed of granules, which he distinguishes as 
 lantJianin- or oxychroniatin-'gx?ca\A&^ from the basichromati7i-gra.r\\At?, 
 of the chromatic network. Like the latter, the oxychromatin-granules 
 are suspended in a non-staining clear substance, for which he reserves 
 the term Imiii. Both forms of granules occur in the chromatic 
 network, while the achromatic network contains only oxy chromatin. 
 They are- sharply differentiated by dyes, the basichromatin being 
 coloured by the basic tar-colours (methyl-green, saffranin, etc.) and 
 other true " nuclear stains " ; while the oxychromatin-granules, like 
 many cytoplasmic structures, and like the substance of true nucleoli 
 (pyrenin), are coloured by acid tar-colours (rubin, eosin, etc.) and 
 other "plasma stains." This distinction, as will appear in Chapter 
 VI I., is possibly one of great physiological significance. 

Still other forms of granules have been distinguished in the nucleus 
 by Reinke ('94) and Schloter ('94). Of these the most important 
 are the "oedematin-granules," which according to the first of these 
 authors form the principal mass of the ground-substance or " nuclear 
 sap " of Hertwig and other authors. These granules are identified 
 by both observers with the " cyanophilous granules," which Altmann 
 regarded as the essential elements of the nucleus. It is at present 
 impossible to give a consistent interpretation of the morphological 
 value and physiological relations of these various forms of granules. 
 The most that can be said is that the basichromatin-granules are 
 probably normal structures ; that they play a principal i^ole in the 
 life of the nucleus ; that the oxychromatin-granules are nearly related 
 to them ; and that not improbably the one form may be transformed 
 into the other in the manner suggested in Chapter VII. 

The nuclear membrane is not yet thoroughly understood, and 
 much discussion has been devoted to the question of its origin and 
 structure. The most probable view is that long since advocated by 
 Klein (^7^) and Van Beneden ('83) that the membrane arises as a 
 condensation of the general protoplasmic substance, and is part of 
 the same structure as the linin-network and the cytoplasmic mesh- 
 work. Like these, it is in some cases "achromatic," but in other cases
