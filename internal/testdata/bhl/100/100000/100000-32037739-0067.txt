it shows the same staining reactions as chromatin, or may be double, 
 consisting of an outer achromatic and an inner chromatic layer. Ac- 
 cording to Reinke, it consists of oxychromatin-granules like those of 
 the linin-network. 

Interesting questions are raised by a comparison of these facts 
 with the conditions observed in some of the lowest organisms, such 
 as the flagellates and lower rhizopods among animals and the

Cyanophyceae and Bacteria among plants. In many of these forms 
 (Fig. 1 6) no distinct nucleus can be demonstrated, the cell consisting 
 of a mass of protoplasm in which are scattered numerous deeply 
 staining granules. Many of these granules stain intensely with 
 hjematoxylin and other "nuclear" dyes; like chromatin, they resist 
 the action of peptic digestion, and in at least one case (the bacterium- 
 like Achroviatium, according to Schewiakoff, '93) they have the power 
 of division like the chromatin-crranules of higher forms. For these
