GENERAL SKETCH OF THE CELL 

reasons most observers (Biitschli, Gruber, Schewiakoff, Nadson, etc.) 
 regard them as true chromatin-granules which represent a scattered or 
 distributed nucleus not differentiated as a definite morphological body. 
 If this identification is correct, such forms probably give us the most 
 primitive condition of the nuclear substance, which only in higher 
 forms is collected into a distinct mass enclosed by a membrane ; and 
 the scattered granules are comparable to those forming the chro- 
 matin-reticulum and chromosomes in the higher types. The identi- 
 fication is, however, difficult, owing to the impossibility of actual 
 chemical analysis ; and Fischer ('97) has shown in the case of the 
 Bacteria and Cyanophyceae that we cannot safely trust either the 
 staining reactions or the digestion test, since the former are variable, 
 while the latter does not differentiate the granules from some other 
 cytoplasmic constituents.^ It is, however, certain that the staining 
 power of chromatin in the higher forms varies with different condi- 
 tions, and furthermore there is reason to believe that these granules 
 may divide by fission. Besides these observations of Schewiakoff on 
 Achromatism (see above), we have those of several authors on 
 Infusoria, and more recently those of Calkins on flagellates, 
 both pointing to the same conclusion. Balbiani, Gruber, Maupas, 
 and others have described various Infusoria {Urostyla, TracJielocerca, 
 Holosticha, Uroleptns), as well as some rhizopods {Pelomyxd), in 
 which the body contains very numerous minute chromatin-granules 
 of "nuclei" (Fig. 15), which Gruber {'^7) showed to multiply by 
 division. Balbiani ('61) long since showed that in Urostyla these 
 bodies become concentrated toward the centre of the ceil at the time 
 of division, and Bergh ('89) demonstrated that they then fuse to form 
 a macronucleus of the usual type, that elongates, assumes a fibrillar 
 structure, and divides by fission. After division of the cell-body 
 the macronucleus again fragments into minute scattered granules, 
 which in this case certainly represent a distributed nucleus. In the 
 flagellate Tetramitus Calkins ('98, i) likewise finds numerous scat- 
 tered chromatin-granules, which at the time of division become aggre- 
 gated into a single dividing mass (p. 92); while in other forms the 
 mass (nucleus) persists as such without {Trachelomojias, Lagenella, 
 Chilomonas) or with {Eiiglena, Symwa) a surrounding membrane. 

Taken together, the foregoing facts, while certainly not conclusive, 
 give good ground for the provisional acceptance of Biitschli's con- 
 ception of the distributed nucleus, and indicate that nucleus and 
 cytoplasm have arisen through the differentiation of a common 
 protoplasmic mass. The nucleus, as Carnoy has well said,^ is like a
