house built to contain the chromatic elements, and its achromatic ele- 
 ments (Hnin, etc.) were originally a part of the general cell-substance. 
 Moreover, as Carnoy points out, the house periodically goes to pieces 
 in the process of mitotic division, the chromatin afterward "building 
 for itself a new dwelling." 

3. Chemistry of the Nucleus 

The chemical nature of the various nuclear elements will be considered in Chapter 
 VII., and a brief statement will here suffice. The following classification of the 
 nuclear substances, proposed by Schwarz in 1887, has been widely accepted, though 
 open to criticism on various grounds. 

1. Chromatin. The chromatic substance (basichromatin) of the network and of 

those nucleoli known as net-knots or karyosomes. 

2. Linin. The achromatic network and the spindle fibres arising from it. 

3. Paralinin. The ground-substance. 

4. Pyrenin or Parachroniatiti. The inner mass of true nucleoli. 

5. Amphipyrenin. The substance of the nuclear membrane. 

Chrofnathi is probably identical with miclein (p. 332), which is a compound of 
 micleinic acid (a complex organic acid, rich in phosphorus) and albuminous sub- 
 stances. In certain cases (nuclei of spermatozoa, and probably also the chromo- 
 somes at the time of mitosis) the jDercentage of nucleinic acid is very large (p. 333). 
 The linin is supposed to be composed of "plastin" â€” a substance identified by 
 Reinke and Rodewald ('81) and probably a nucleo-albumin or a related substance. 
 '' Pyrenin " is related to plastin ; and Carnoy and Zacharias apply the latter word to 
 the nucleolar substance, while O. Hertwig calls it paranuclei n. "Amphipyrenin" 
 has no very definite meaning ; for the nuclear membrane sometimes appears to be of 
 the same nature as the linin, while in other cases it stains like chromatin. For cri- 
 tique of the staining reactions see page 334. 

D. The Cytoplasm 

It has long been recognized that in the unicellular forms the 
 cytoplasmic substance is often differentiated into two well-marked 
 zones : viz. an inner medullary substance or cudoplasDi in which the 
 nucleus lies, and an outer cortical substance or cxoplasin (ectoplasm) 
 from which the more differentiated products of the cytoplasm, such 
 as cilia, trichocysts, and membrane, take their origin. Indications of 
 a similar differentiation are often shown in the tissue-cells of higher 
 plants and animals,^ though it may take the form of a polar differen- 
 tiation of the cell-substance, or may be wholly wanting. Whether 
 the distinction is of fundamental importance remains to be seen ; but 
 it appears to be a general rule that the nucleus is surrounded by 

^ This fact was first pointed out in the tissue-cells of animals by Kupffer ('75), and its 
 importance has since been urged by Waldeyer, Reinke, and others. The cortical layer is 
 by Kupffer termed paraplasm, by Pfeffer hyaloplasm, by Pringsheim the Haiitschicht. The 
 medullary zone is termed by Kupffer protoplasm, sensu strictu; by Strasburger", Korner- 
 plasma ; by 'i:ia.g&\\, polioplasin.
