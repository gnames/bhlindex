42 GENERAL SKETCH OF THE CELL 

protoplasm of relatively slight differentiation, while the more highly- 
 differentiated products of cell-activity are laid down in the more 
 peripheral region of the cell, either in the cortical zone or at one 
 end of the cell.^ This fact is full of meaning, not only because it is 
 an expression of the adaptation of the cell to its external environment, 
 but also because of its bearing on the problems of nutrition. ^ For if, 
 as we shall see reason to conclude in Chapter VI I., the nucleus be 
 immediately concerned with synthetic metabolism, we should expect 
 to find the immediate and less differentiated products of its action in 
 its neighbourhood, and on the whole the facts bear out this view. 

The most pressing of all questions regarding the cytoplasmic 
 structure is whether the sponge-like, fibrillar, or alveolar appearance 
 is a normal condition existing during life. There are many cases, 
 especially among plant-cells, in which the most careful examination 
 has thus far failed to reveal the presence of a reticulum, the cyto- 
 plasm appearing, even under the highest powers and after the most 
 careful treatment, merely as a finely granular substance. This and 
 the additional fact that the cytoplasm may show active streaming and 
 flowing movements, has led some authors, especially among bota- 
 nists, to regard the reticulum as non-essential and as being, when 
 present, either a secondary differentiation of the cytoplasmic sub- 
 stance specially developed for the performance of particular functions 
 or a mere coagulation-product due to the action of fixatives. It has 
 been shown that structureless proteids, such as egg-albumin and 
 other substances, when coagulated by various reagents, often show a 
 structure closely similar to that of protoplasm as observed in micro- 
 scopical sections. Flemming ('82) long since called attention to the 
 danger of mistaking such coagulation-products for normal structures 
 as seen in fixed and stained material, and his warning has been 
 emphasized by the later experiments of Berthold ('86), Schwarz ('87), 
 and especially of Biitschli ('92, '98), Fischer ('94, '95, '99), and 
 Hardy ('99). Biitschli's extensive studies of such coagulation-phe- 
 nomena show that coagulated or dried albumin, starch-solutions, gela- 
 tin, gum arable, and other substances show a fine alveolar structure 
 scarcely to be distinguished from that which he believes to be the 
 normal and typical structure of protoplasm. Fischer and Hardy 
 have likewise made extensive tests of solutions of albumin, peptone, 
 and related substances, in various degrees of concentration, fixed and 
 stained by a great variety of the reagents ordinarily used for the 
 demonstration of cell-structures. The result was to produce a mar- 
 vellously close simulacrum of the appearances observed in the cell, 
 alveolar, reticulated, and fibrillar structures being produced that often 
 contain granules closely similar in every respect to those described as
