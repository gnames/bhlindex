 pith with peptone-solution and then hardening, sectioning, and stain- 
 ing, the cells may even contain a central nucleus-like mass suspended 
 in a network of anastomosing threads that extend in every direction 
 outward to the walls, and give a remarkable likeness of a normal cell. 
 These facts show how cautious we must be in judging the appear-

 The evidence is nevertheless overwhelmingly strong, as I believe, 
 that not only the fibrillar and alveolar formations, but also the micro- 
 somes observed in cell-structures, are in part normal structures. This 
 evidence is derived partly from a study of the living cell, partly from 
 the regular and characteristic arrangement of the thread-work and
