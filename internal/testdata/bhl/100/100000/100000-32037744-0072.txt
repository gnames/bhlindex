GENERAL SKETCH OF THE CELL 

microsomes in certain cases. In many Protozoa, for example, a fine 
 alveolar structure may be seen in the living protoplasm ; and Flem- 
 ming as well as many later observers has clearly seen fibrillar struc- 
 tures in the living cells of cartilage, epithelium connective-tissue, and 
 some other animal cells (Fig. 9). Mikosch, also, has recently described 
 granular threads in living plant-cells. 

Almost equally conclusive is the beautifully regular arrangement 
 of the fibrillae in ciliated cells (Fig. 17, Engelmann), in muscle-fibres 
 and nerve-fibres, and especially in the mitotic figure of dividing cells

A-C. Necturus ; D. Rana. A and B represent two stages of the "loaded" cell, showing 
 zymogen-granules in the peripheral and fibrillar structures in the basal part of the cell. C shows 
 cells after discharge of the granule-material and invasion of the entire cell by fibrillae. In D por- 
 tions of the fibrillar material are coiled to form the mitosome (" paranucleus " or " Nebenkern "). 

(Figs. 21, 31), where they are likewise more or less clearly visible 
 in life. A very convincing case is afforded by the pancreas-cells 
 of Necturus, which Ma,thews has carefully studied in my laboratory. 
 Here the thread-work consists of long, conspicuous, definite fibrillae, 
 some of which may under certain conditions be wound up more or 
 less closely in a spiral mass to form the so-called Nebenkern. In all 
 these cases it is impossible to regard the thread-work as an accidental 
 coagulation-product. In the case of echinoderm eggs, I have made 
 ('99) a critical comparison of the living structure, as seen under powers
