The centre of the cell is occupied by a large vacuole, filled with a watery liquid. The cyto- 
 plasm forms a very regular and distinct reticulum with scattered microsomes which become very 
 large in the peripheral zone. The larger pale bodies, lying in the ground-substance, are excretory 
 granules {i.e. metaplasm). The nucleus, at the right, is surrounded by a thick chromatic mem- 
 brane, is traversed by a very distinct linin-network, contains numerous scattered chromatin- 
 granules, and a single large nucleolus within which is a vacuole. Above are two isolated nuclei 
 showing nucleoli and chromatin-granules suspended in the linin-threads. 

other reagents. The comparison leaves no doubt that the normal 
 structures are in this case very perfectly preserved, though the sec- 
 tions give at first sight an appearance somewhat different from that
