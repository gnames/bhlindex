 The nucleus contains a single intensely chromatic nucleolus, and a paler linin-netvvork with 
 rounded chromatin-granules. The cytoplasmic fibrillEe are faintly shown passing out into the 
 nerve-process below. (They are figured as far more distinct by Flemming.) The dark cyto- 
 plasmic masses are the deeply staining " chromophilic granules" (Nissl) of unknown function.
