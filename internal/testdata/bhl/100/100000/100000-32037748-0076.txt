48 GENERAL SKETCH OF THE CELL 

in life, the network is loose and open, and appears to consist of more 
 or less completely separate threads (Fig. 9). In the cells of colum- 
 nar epithelium, the threads in the peripheral part of the cell often 
 assume a more or less parallel course, passing outwards from the 
 central region, and giving the outer zone of the cell a striated appear- 
 ance. This is very conspicuously shown in ciliated epithelium, the 
 fibrillae corresponding in number with the cilia as if continuous with 
 their bases (Fig. i/).^ In nerve-fibres the threads form closely set 
 parallel fibrillae which may be traced into the body of the nerve-cell ; 
 here, according to most authors, they break up into a network in 
 which are suspended numerous deeply staining masses, the " chromo- 
 philic granules " of Nissl (Fig. 20).^ In the contractile tissues the 
 threads are in most cases very conspicuous and have a parallel course. 
 This is clearly shown in smooth muscle-fibres and also, as Ballowitz 
 has shown, in the tails of spermatozoa. This arrangement is most 
 striking in striped muscle-fibres where the fibrillae are extremely well 
 marked. According to Retzius, Carnoy, Van Gehuchten, and others, 
 the meshes have here a rectangular form, the principal fibrillae having 
 a longitudinal course and being connected at regular intervals by 
 transverse threads ; but the structure of the muscle-fibre is probably 
 far more complicated than this account would lead one to suppose, 
 and opinion is still divided as to whether the contractile substance 
 is represented by the reticulum proper or by the ground-substance. 

Nowhere, perhaps, is a fibrillar structure shown with such beauty as 
 in dividing cells, where (Figs. 21, 31) the fibrillae group themselves 
 in two radiating systems or asters, which are in some manner the 
 immediate agents of cell-division. Similar radiating systems of fibres 
 occur in amoeboid cells, such as leucocytes (Fig. 49) and pigment- 
 cells (Fig. 50), where they probably form a contractile system by 
 means of which the movements of the cell are performed. 

The views of Biitschli and his followers, which have been touched 
 on at p. 25, differ considerably from the foregoing, the fibrillae being 
 regarded as the optical sections of thin plates or lamellae which form 
 the walls of closed chambers filled by a more liquid substance. 
 Biitschli, followed by Reinke, Eismond, Erlanger, and others, inter- 
 prets in the same sense the astral systems of dividing cells which 
 are regarded as a radial configuration of the lamellae about a central 
 point (Fig. 10, B). Strong evidence against this view is, I beheve, 

1 The structure of the ciliated cell, as described by Engelmann, may be beautifully demon- 
 strated in the funnel-cells of the nephridia and sperm-ducts of the earthworm. 

2 The remarkable researches of Apathy ('97) on the nerve-cells of leeches have revealed 
 the existence within the nerve-cell of networks far more complex and definite than was 
 formerly supposed, and showing definite relations to incoming and outgoing fibrillae within 
 the substance of the nerve-fibres.
