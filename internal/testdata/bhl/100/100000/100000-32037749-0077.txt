afforded by the appearance of the spindle and asters in cross-section. 
 In the early stages of the o.^^ of Nereis, for example, the astral rays 
 are coarse anastomosing fibres that stain intensely and are therefore 
 very favourable for observation (Fig. 60). That they are actual fibres 
 is, I think, proved by sagittal sections of the asters in which the rays 
 are cut at various angles. The cut ends of the branching rays appear 
 in the clearest manner, not as plates but as distinct dots, from which 
 in oblique sections the ray may be traced inwards toward the centro- 
 sphere. Driiner, too, figures the spindle in cross-section as consisting 
 of rounded dots, like the end of a bundle of wires, though these are 
 connected by cross-branches (Fig. 28, F). Again, the crossing of

the rays proceeding from the asters (Fig. 128), and their behaviour in 
 certain phases of cell-division, is difficult to explain under any other 
 than the fibrillar theory. 

We must admit, however, that the meshwork varies greatly in differ- 
 ent cells and even in different physiological phases of the same cell ; 
 and that it is impossible at present to bring it under any rule of uni- 
 versal application. It is possible, nay probable, that in one and the 
 same cell a portion of the meshwork may form a true alveolar structure 
 , such as is described by Biitschli, while other portions may, at the 
 same time, be differentiated into actual fibres. If this be true the 
 fibrillar or alveolar structure is a matter of secondary moment, and 
 the essential features of protoplasmic organization must be sought in 
 a more subtle underlying structure.^
