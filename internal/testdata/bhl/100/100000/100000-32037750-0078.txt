50 GENERAL SKETCH OF THE CELL 

Space would not sufifice for a comparative account of the endless 
 modifications shown by the cytoplasmic substance in different forms 
 of cells. Many of these arise through special differentiations of the 
 active substance, the character of the structure thus being some- 
 times so highly modified, as in the striated muscle-fibre, that it is 
 difficult to trace its exact relation to the more usual forms. More 
 commonly the cytoplasm is modified through the formation of passive 
 or metaplasmic substances which often completely transform the 
 original appearance of the cell. The most frequent of such modifi- 
 cations arise through the deposit of liquid drops and "granules" 
 (many of the latter, however, being no doubt liquid in life). When 
 the liquid drops are of watery nature the cavities in which they lie 
 are known as vacuoles, which are especially .fcharacteristic of the pro- 
 toplasm of plant-c^H<s«Mi jet ^^Sst^zoa. These may enlarge or run 
 together to forny^#^sive cavine«,^^^e cell, the protoplasm becom- 
 ing reduced to A:weripTief3!*^!yCT', oTy?\strands and networks travers-

The vacuo li^ktiori or^^^^^Shltke- abearance arising through the 
 formation of larg^^^^]^gp,"^^^„iJfe deposit of other metaplasmic 
 material is inot to be confULiJ;id"e^with the primary protoplasmic struc- 
 ture. When, however, smaller vacuoles or metaplasmic granules are 
 evenly distributed through the protoplasm, a " pseudo-alveolar " struc- 
 ture (Reinke) arises that can often hardly be distinguished from the 
 " true " alveolar structure of Biitschli.^ Comparative study shows 
 that all gradations exist between the " false " and the " true " alveolar 
 structures and that no logical ground of distinction between the two 
 exists.^ We thus reach ground for the conclusion that the coarser 
 secondary alveolar or reticular formations are to be regarded as only 
 an exaggeration of the primary structure, and that the alveolar mate- 
 rial of Biitschli's structure belongs in the same general category with 
 the passive or metaplasmic substance.^ 

E. The Centrosome 

The centrosome^ is usually an extremely minute body, or more 
 commonly a pair of bodies, staining intensely with haematoxylin and 

1 In the latter the alveolar spheres are, according to Biitschli, not more than one or two 
 microns in diameter. 

2 This has been demonstrated in the cells of plants by Craio ('96), and more recently 
 by the writer ('99), in the case of echinoderm and other eggs.

* The centrosome was apparently first seen and described by Flemming in 1875, in the 
 egg of the fresh-water mussel Anodonta, and independently discovered by Van Beneden, in
