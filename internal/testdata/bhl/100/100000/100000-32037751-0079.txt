THE CENTROSOME 5 1 

some other reagents, and surrounded by a cytoplasmic radiating aster 
 or by a rounded mass known as the attraction-sphere (Figs. 8, 49, etc.). 
 As a rule it lies in the cytoplasm, not far from the nucleus, and 
 usually opposite an indentation or bay in the latter ; but in a few 
 cases it lies inside the nucleus (Fig. 148). In epithelia the centro- 
 somes (usually double) lie as a rule near the free end of the cell 
 (Fig. 23).i 

There is still much confusion regarding the relation of the centro- 
 some to the surrounding structures, and this has involved a corre- 
 sponding ambiguity in the terminology. We will therefore only 
 consider it briefly at this point, deferring a more critical account to 
 Chapter VI. In its simplest form it is a single minute granule, which 
 may, however, become double or triple (leucocytes, connective tissue- 
 cells, some epithelial cells) or even multiple, as in certain giant-cells 
 (Fig. 14, D), and as also occurs in some forms of cell-division (Fig. 
 52). In some cases (Figs. 8, C, 120, 148) the " centrosome " is a 
 larger body containing one or more central granules or " centrioles " 
 (Boveri); but it is probable that in some of these cases the central 
 granule is itself the true centrosome, and the surrounding body is part 
 of the attraction-sphere. During the, formation of the spermatozoon 
 the centrosome undergoes some remarkable morphological changes 
 (p. 171), and is closely involved in the formation of the contractile 
 structures of the tail. 

The nature and functions of the centrosome have formed the sub- 
 ject of some of the most persistent and searching investigations of 
 recent cytology. Van Beneden, followed by Boveri and many later 
 workers, regarded the centrosome as a distinct and persistent cell- 
 organ, which like the nucleus was handed on by division from one 
 cell-generation to another. Physiologically it was regarded as being 
 the especial organ of cell-division, and in this sense as the " dy- 
 namic centre" of the cell. In Boveri's beautiful development of this 

the following year, in dycyeiiiids. The name is clue to Boveri ('88, 2, p. 68). Van Beneden's 
 and Boveri's independent identification of centrosome in Ascaris as a permanent cell-organ 
 ('87) was quickly supported by numerous observations on other animals and on plants. In 
 rapid succession the centrosome and attraction-sphere were found to be present in pig- 
 ment-cells of fishes (Solger, '89, '90), in the spermatocytes of Amphibia (Hermann, '90), in 
 the leucocytes, endothelial cells, connective tissue-cells, and lung-epithelium of salamanders 
 (Flemming, '91), in various plant-cells (Guignard, '91), in the one-celled diatoms (Butschli, 
 '91), in the giant-cells and other cells of bone-marrow (Heidenhain, Van Bambeke, Van der 
 Stricht, '91), in the flagellate Noctiltua (Ishikawa, '91), in the cells of marine alga; (Stras- 
 burger, '92), in cartilage-cells (Van der Stricht, '92), in cells of cancerous growths (epitheli- 
 oma, Lustig and Galeotti, '92), in the young germ-cells as already described, in gland-cells 
 (Vom Rath, '95), in nerve-cells (Ivcnhossek, '95"), in smooth muscle-fibres (Lenhossek, '99), 
 and in embryonic cells of many kinds (Heidenhain, '97). Many others have confirmed 
 and extended this list. Guignard's identification of the centrosomes in higher plants is 
 open to grave doubt {^cf. p. 82). â– ^ C^ P- 57'
