leucoplastids in the embryonic cells. By enlargement and differen- 
 tiation these give rise to the starch-builders (amyloplastids), to the 
 chlorophyll-bodies (chloroplastids), and to other pigment-bodies 
 (chromoplastids), all of which may retain the power of division. The 
 embryonic leucoplastids are also believed to multiply by division and 
 to arise by the division of plastids in the parental organism ; but it 
 remains an open question whether this is their only mode of origin, 
 and the same is true of the more highly differentiated forms of plas- 
 tids to which they may give rise. 

The contractile or pulsating vacuoles that occur in most Protozoa 
 and in the swarm-spores of many Algae are also known in some 
 cases to multiply by division ; and the same is true, according to the 
 researches of De Vries^ Went, and others, of the non-pulsating vacu- 
 oles of plant-cells. These vacuoles have been shown to have, in many 
 cases, distinct walls, and they are regarded by De Vries as a special 
 form of plastid ("tonoplasts ") analogous to the chromatophores and 
 other plastids. It is, however, probable that this view is only appli- 
 cable to certain forms of vacuoles. 

The plastids possess in some cases a high degree of morphological 
 independence, and may even live for a time after removal from ' 
 the remaining cell-substance, as in the case of the "yellow cells" of 
 Radiolaria. This has led to the view, advocated by Brandt and others, 
 that the chlorophyll-bodies found in the cells of many Protozoa and 
 a few Metazoa {Hydra, Spougilla, some planarians) are in reality dis- 
 tinct Algae living symbiotically in the cell. This view is probably 
 correct in some cases, e.g. in the Radiolaria ; but it may be doubted 
 whether it is of general application. In the plants the plastids are 
 almost certainly to be regarded as differentiations of the protoplasmic 
 substance. 

The existence of cell-organs which have the power of independent 
 assimilation, growth, and division is a fact of great theoretical interest 
 in its bearing on the general problem of cell-organization ; for it is 
 one of the main reasons that have led De Vries, Wiesner, and many 
 others to regard the entire cell as made up of elementary self-propa- 
 gating units. 

G. The Cell-membrane 

The structure and origin of the cell-wall or membrane form a 
 subject somewhat apart from our general purpose, since the wall 
 belongs to the passive or metaplasmic products of protoplasm rather 
 than to the living cell itself. We shall therefore treat it very briefly. 
 Broadly speaking, animal cells are in general characterized by the 
 slight development and relative unimportance of the cell-walls, while
