54 GENERAL SKETCH OF THE CELL 

the reverse is the case in plants, where the cell-walls play a very- 
 important role. In the latter the wall sometimes attains a great 
 thickness, usually displays a distinct stratification, and often has a 
 complex sculpture. Such massive walls very rarely occur in the 
 case of animal tissues, though the intercellular matrix of cartilage 
 and bone is to a certain extent analogous to them, and the thick and 
 often highly sculptured envelopes of some kinds of eggs and of 
 various Protozoa may be placed in the same category. 

It is open to question whether any cells are entirely devoid of an 
 enclosing envelope ; for even in such " naked " cells as leucocytes, 
 rhizopods, or membraneless eggs, the boundary of the cell is usually 
 formed by a more resistant layer of protoplasm or " pellicle" (Biitschli) 
 which may be so marked as to simulate a true membrane, as is the 
 case, for example, in the red blood-corpuscles (Ranvier, Waldeyer, 
 etc.). Such pellicles probably differ from true membranes only in 
 degree ; but it is still an open question both in animals and in plants, 
 how far true membranes arise by direct transformation of the periph- 
 eral protoplasmic layer (the " Hautschicht " of botanists), and how 
 far as a secretion-product of the protoplasm. In the case of animal 
 cells, Leydig long since proposed ^ to distinguish between " cuticular " 
 membranes, formed as secretions and usually occurring only on the 
 free surfaces (as in epithelia), from " true membranes " arising by 
 direct transformation of the peripheral protoplasm. Later researches, 
 including those of Leydig himself, have thrown so much doubt on 
 this distinction that most later writers have used the term atticular 
 in a purely topographical sense to denote membranes formed only 
 on one (the free) side of the cell,^ leaving open the question of origin. 
 The formation and growth of the cell-wall have been far more thor- 
 oughly studied in plants than in animals, yet even here opinion is 
 still divided. Most recent researches tend to sustain the early view 
 of Nageli that the cell-wall is in general a secretion-product, though 
 there are some cases in which a direct transformation of protoplasm 
 into membrane-stuff seems to occur.^ In the division of plant-cells 
 the daughter-cells are in almost all cases cut apart by a cell-plate 
 which arises in the protoplasm of the mother-cell as a transverse 
 series of thickenings of the spindle-fibres in the equatorial region 
 (Fig. 34). This fact, long regarded by Strasburger and others as 
 a proof of the direct origin of the membrane from the protoplasmic 
 substance, is shown by Strasburger's latest work ('98) to be open 
 to a quite different interpretation, the actual wall being formed by 
 a splitting of the cell-plate into two layers between which the wall 
 appears as a secretion-product. Almost all observers further are 
 agreed that the formation of new membranes on naked masses of
