POLARITY OF THE CELL

protoplasm produced by plasmolysis are likewise secretion-products, 
 and that the secondary thickening of plant-membranes is produced 
 in the same way. These facts, together with the scanty available 
 zoological data, indicate that the formation of membranes by secre- 
 tion is the more usual and typical process.^ 

The chemical composition of the membrane or intercellular sub- 
 stance varies extremely. In plants the membrane consists of a basis 
 of cellulose, a carbohydrate having the formula CgH^gOg ; but this sub- 
 stance is very frequently impregnated with other substances, such 
 as silica, lignin, and a great variety of others. In animals the inter- 
 cellular substances show a still greater diversity. Many of them are 
 nitrogenous bodies, such as keratin, chitin, elastin, gelatin, and the 
 like ; but inorganic deposits, such as silica and carbonate of lime, are 
 common. 

H. Polarity of the Cell 

In a large number of cases the cell exhibits a definite polarity, its 
 parts being symmetrically grouped with reference to an ideal organic 
 axis passing from pole to pole. No definite criterion for the identi- 
 fication of the cell-axis has, however, yet been determined ; for the 
 general conception of cell-polarity has been developed in two differ- 
 ent directions, one of which starts from purely morphological con- 
 siderations, the other from physiological, and a parallelism between 
 them has not thus far been fully made out. 

On the one hand. Van Beneden ('83) conceived cell-polarity as a 
 primary morphological attribute of the cell, the organic axis being 
 identified as a line drawn through the centre of the nucleus and the 
 centrosome (Fig. 22, A). With this view Rabl's theory ('85) of 
 nuclear polarity harmonizes, for the chromosome-loops converge 
 toward the centrosome, and the nuclear axis coincides with the cell- 
 axis. Moreover, it identifies the polarity of the Q.gg, which is so 
 important a factor in development, with that of the tissue-cells ; for 
 the egg-centrosome almost invariably appears at or near one pole of 
 the ovum. 

Heidenhain ('94, '95) has recently developed this conception of 
 polarity in a very elaborate manner, maintaining that all the struc- 
 tures of the cell have a definite relation to the primary axis, and that 
 this relation is determined by conditions of tension in the astral rays 

^ Strasburger ('97, 3, '9S) believes membrane-formation in general to be especially con- 
 nected with the activity of the " kinoplasm," or filar plasm of which he considers the " Haut- 
 schicht," as well as the spindle-hbres, to be largely composed. In support of this may be 
 mentioned, besides the mode of formation of the partition-walls in the division of plant- 
 cells, Harper's ('97) very interesting observations on the formation of the ascospores in 
 Erysiphe (Fig. 33), where the spore-membrane appears to arise directly from the astral 
 rays.
