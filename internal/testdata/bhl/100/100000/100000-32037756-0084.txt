focussed at the centrosome. On this basis he endeavours to explain 
 the position and movements of the nucleus, the succession of division- 
 planes, and many related phenomena.^ 

Hatschek ('88) and Rabl ('89, '92), on the other hand, have ad- 
 vanced a quite different hypothesis based on physiological considera- 
 tions. By "cell-polarity" these authors mean, not a predetermined 
 morphological arrangement of parts in the cell, but a polar differen- 
 tiation of the cell-substance arising secondarily through adaptation of 
 the cell to its environment in the tissues,' and having no- necessary 
 relation to the polarity of Van Beneden (Fig. 22, B, C). This is

typically shown in epithelium, which, as Kolliker and Haeckel long 
 since pointed out, is to be regarded, both ontogenetically and phy- 
 logenetically, as the most primitive form of tissue. The free and 
 basal ends of the cells here differ widely in relation to the food- 
 supply, and show a corresponding structural differentiation. In such 
 cells the nucleus usually lies nearer the basal end, toward the source 
 of food, while the differentiated products of cell-activity are formed 
 either at the free end (cuticular structures, cilia, pigment, zymogen- 
 granules), or at the basal end (muscle-fibres, nerve-fibres). In the 
 non-epithelial tissues the polarity may be lost, though traces of it 
 are often shown as a survival of the epithelial arrangement of the 
 embryonic stages.
