POLARITY OF THE CELL

But, although this conception of polarity has an entirely different 
 point of departure from Van Beneden's, it leads, in some cases at 
 least, to the same result ; for the cell-axis, as thus determined, may 
 coincide with the morphological axis as determined by the position 
 of the centrosome. This is the case, for example, with both the 
 spermatozoon and the ovum ; for the morphological axis in both is 
 also the physiological axis about which the cytoplasmic differentia- 
 tions are grouped. Recent researches have further shown that the 
 same is the case in many forms of epithelia, where the centrosomes 
 lie in the outer end of the cell, often very near the surface.^ (Fig. 23)

and the recent observations of Henneguy ('98) and Lenhossek ('98,1) 
 give reason to believe that the "basal bodies" to which the cilia of 
 ciliated epithelium are attached may be the centrosomes.^ These 
 facts are of very high significance ; for the position of the centro- 
 some, and hence the direction of the axis, is here obviously related 
 to the cell-environment, and it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that 
 the latter must be the determining condition to which the intracellular 
 relations conform. When applied to the germ-cells, this conclusion 
 becomes of high interest ; for the polarity of the Q.gg is one of the
