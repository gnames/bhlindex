I. The Cell in Relation to the Multicellular Body 

In analyzing the structure and functions of the individual cell we 
 are accustomed, as a matter of convenience, to regard it as an inde- 
 pendent elementary organism or organic unit. Actually, however, 
 it is such an organism only in the case of the unicellular plants and 
 animals and the germ-cells of the multicellular forms. When we 
 consider the tissue-cells of the latter, we must take a somewhat dif- 
 ferent view. As far as structure and origin are concerned the tissue- 
 cell is unquestionably of the same morphological value as the 
 one-celled plant or animal ; and in this sense the multicellular body 
 is equivalent to a colony or aggregate of one-celled forms. Physi- 
 ologically, however, the tissue-cell can only in a limited sense be 
 regarded as an independent unit ; for its autonomy is merged in a 
 greater or less degree into the general life of the organism. From 
 this point of view the tissue-cell must in fact be treated as merely 
 a localized area of activity, provided it is true with the complete 
 apparatus of cell-life, and even capable of independent action 
 within certain limits, yet nevertheless a part and not a whole. 

There is at present no biological question of greater moment than 
 the means by which the individual cell-activities are coordinated, and 
 the organic unity of the body maintained ; for upon this question 
 hangs not only the problem of the transmission of acquired charac- 
 ters, and the nature of development, but our conception of life itself. 
 Schwann, the father of the cell-theory, very clearly perceived this ; 
 and after an admirably lucid discussion of the facts known to him 
 ('39), drew the conclusion that the life of the organism is essentially 
 a composite ; that each cell has its independent life ; and that " the 
 whole organism subsists only by means of the reciprocal action of the 
 single elementary parts." ^ This conclusion, afterward elaborated by 
 Virchow and Haeckel to the theory of the "cell-state," took a very 
 strong hold on the minds of biological investigators, and is even now 
 widely accepted. It is, however, becoming more and more clearly 
 apparent that this conception expresses only a part of the truth, and 
 that Schwann went too far in denying the influence of the totality of 
 the organism upon the local activities of the cells. It would of 
 course be absurd to maintain that the whole can consist of more than 
 the sum of its parts. Yet, as far as growth and development are con-

 products. 2 Untersuchimgen^ Trans., p. 181.
