THE CELL LN RELATION TO THE MULTICELLULAR BODY 59 

cerned, it has now been clearly demonstrated that only in a limited 
 sense can the cells be regarded as cooperating units. They are 
 rather local centres of a formative power pervading the growing 
 mass as a whole,^ and the physiological autonomy of the individual 
 cell falls into the background. It is true that the cells may acquire 
 a high degree of physiological independence in the later stages of 
 embryological development. The facts to be discussed in the eighth 
 and ninth chapters will, however, show strong reason for the conclu- 
 sion that this is a secondary result of development, through which the 
 cells become, as it were, emancipated in a greater or less degree 
 from the general control. Broadly viewed, therefore, the life of the 
 multicellular organism is to be conceived as a whole ; and the appar- 
 ently composite character which it may exhibit is owing to a second- 
 ary distribution of its energies among local centres of action. ^ 

In this light the structural relations of tissue-cells become a ques- 
 tion of great interest ; for we have here to seek the means by which 
 the individual cell comes into relation with the totality of the organ- 
 ism, and by which the general equilibrium of the body is maintained. 
 It must be confessed that the results of microscopical research have 
 not thus far given a very certain answer to this question. Though 
 the tissue-cells are often apparently separated from one another by a 
 non-living intercellular substance, which may appear in the form of 
 solid walls, it is by no means certain that their organic continuity is 
 thus actually severed. Many cases are known in which division of 
 the nucleus is not followed by division of the cell-body, so that multi- 
 nuclear cells or syncytia are thus formed, consisting of a continuous 
 mass of protoplasm through which the nuclei are scattered. Heitz- 
 mann long since contended ( '73), though on insufficient evidence, that 
 division is incomplete in nearly all forms of tissue, and that even when 
 cell-walls are formed they are traversed by strands of protoplasm by 
 means of which the cell-bodies remain in organic continuity. The 
 whole body was thus conceived by him as a syncytium, the cells 
 being no more than nodal points in a general reticulum, and the body 
 forming a continuous protoplasmic mass. 

This interesting view, long received with scepticism, has been to a 
 considerable extent sustained by later researches, and though it still 
 XQvcvzSxi^ sub judice, has been definitely accepted in its entirety by some 
 recent workers. The existence of protoplasmic cell-bridges between 
 the sieve-tubes of plants has long been known ; and Tangl's dis- 
 covery, in 1879, of similar connections between the endosperm-cells 
 was followed by the demonstration by Gardiner, Kienitz-Gerloff. A. 
 Meyer, and many others, that in nearly all plant-tissues the cell-walls
