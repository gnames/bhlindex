60 GENERAL SKETCH OF THE CELL 

are traversed by delicate intercellular bridges. Similar bridges have 
 been conclusively demonstrated by Ranvier, Bizzozero, Retzius, Flem- 
 ming, Pfitzner, and many later observers in nearly all forms of epithe- 
 lium (Fig. I ) ; and they are asserted to occur in the smooth muscle-fibres, 
 in cartilage-cells and connective tissue-cells, and in some nerve- 
 cells. Dendy ( '^"i), Paladino ( '90), and Retzius ( '89) have endeav- 
 oured to show, further, that the follicle-cells of the ovary are 
 connected by protoplasmic bridges not only with one another, bitt also 
 with the ovum ; and similar protoplasmic bridges between germ-cells 
 and somatic cells have been also demonstrated in a number of plants, 
 e.g. by Goroschankin ( '83) and Ikeno ( '98) in the cycads and by A. 
 Meyer ( '96) in Volvox. On the strength of these observations some 
 recent writers have not hesitated to accept the probability of Heitz- 
 mann's original conception, A. Meyer, for example, expressing the 
 opinion that both the plant and the animal individual are continuous 
 masses of protoplasm, in which the cytoplasmic substance forms a 
 morphological unit, whether in the form of a single cell, a multi- 
 nucleated cell, or a system of cells.^ Captivating as this hypothesis 
 is, its full acceptance at present would certainly be premature ; and 
 as far as adult animal tissues are concerned, it still remains unde- 
 termined how far the cells are in direct protoplasmic continuity. It 
 is obvious that no such continuity exists in the case of the corpuscles 
 of blood and lymph and the wandering leucocytes and pigment-cells. 
 In case of the nervous system, which from an a priori point of view 
 would seem to be above all others that in which protoplasmic con- 
 tinuity is to be expected, its occurrence and significance are still a 
 subject of debate. When, however, we turn to the embryonic stages 
 we find strong reason for the belief that a material continuity between 
 cells here exists. This is certainly the case in the early stages of 
 many arthropods, where the whole embryo is at first an unmistakable 
 syncytium ; and Adam Sedgwick has endeavoured to show that in 
 Peripatiis and even in the vertebrates the entire embryonic body, up 
 to a late stage, is a continuous syncytium. I have pointed out ( '93) 
 that even in a total cleavage, such as that of Aviphioxus or the echi- 
 noderms, the results of experiment on the early stages of cleavage 
 are difficult to explain, save under the assumption that there must 
 be a structural continuity from cell to cell that is broken by mechan- 
 ical displacement of the blastomeres. This conclusion is supported 
 by the recent work of Hammar ( '96, '97), whose observations on 
 sea-urchin eggs I can in the main confirm. 

Among the most interesting observations in this direction are 
 those of Mrs. Andrews ('97),^ who asserts that during the cleavage
