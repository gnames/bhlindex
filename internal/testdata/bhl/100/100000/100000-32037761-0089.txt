of the echinoderm-egg the blastomeres " spin " delicate protoplasmic 
 filaments, by which direct protoplasmic continuity is estabHshed 
 between them subsequent to each division. These observations, if 
 correct, are of high importance ; for if protoplasmic connections may 
 be broken and re-formed at will, as it were, the adverse evidence 
 of the blood-corpuscles and wandering cells loses much of its weight. 
 Meyer ('96) adduces evidence that in Volvox the cell-bridges are 
 formed anew after division ; and Flemming has also shown that 
 when leucocytes creep about among epithelial cells they rupture the 
 protoplasmic bridges, which are then formed anew behind them.^ 

We are still almost wholly ignorant of the precise physiological 
 meaning of the cell-bridges ; but the facts indicate that they are not 
 merely channels of nutrition, as some authors have maintained, but 
 paths of subtler physiological impulse. Beside the facts determined 
 by the isolation of blastomeres, referred to above, may be placed 
 Townsend's recent remarkable experiments on plants, described at 
 page 346. If correct, these experiments give clear evidence of the 
 transference of physiological influences from cell to cell by means of 
 protoplasmic bridges, showing that the nucleus of one cell may thus 
 control the membrane-forming activity in an enucleated fragment 
 of another cell. The field of research opened up by these and 
 related researches seems one of the most promising in view; but 
 until it has been more fully explored, judgment should be reserved 
 regarding the whole question of the occurrence, origin, and physio- 
 logical meaning of the protoplasmic cell-bridges.
