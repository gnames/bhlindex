CELL-DIVISION 

"Wo eine Zelle entsteht, da muss eine Zelle vorausgegangen sein, ebenso wie das Thier 
 nur aus dem Thiere, die Pflanze nur aus der Pflanze entstehen kann. Auf diese Weise ist, 
 wenngleich es einzelne Punkte im Korper gibt, wo der strange Nachweis noch nicht gelie- 
 fert ist, doch das Princip gesichert, dass in der ganzen Reihe alles Lebendigen, dies mogen 
 nun ganze Pflanzen oder thierische Organismen oder integrirende Theile derselben sein, ein 
 ewiges Gesetz der continuirlichen Entwicklung besteht." Virchow.^ 

The law of genetic cellular continuity, first clearly stated by Vir- 
 chow in the above words, has now become one of the primary data 
 of biology, and the advance of research is ever adding weight to the 
 conclusion that the cell has no other mode of origin than by division 
 of a preexisting cell. In the multicellular organism all the tissue- 
 cells arise by continued division from the original germ-cell, and 
 this in its turn arises by the division of a cell preexisting in the 
 parent-body. By cell-division, accordingly, the hereditary substance 
 is split off from the parent-body ; and by cell-division, again, this 
 substance is handed on by the fertilized egg-cell or oosperm to every 
 part of the body arising from it.^ Cell-division is, therefore, one of 
 the central facts of development and inheritance. 

The first two decades after Schleiden and Schwann ('40-'6o) were 
 occupied with researches, on the part both of botanists and of zool- 
 ogists, which finally demonstrated the universality of this process 
 and showed the authors of the cell-theory to have been in error in 
 asserting the independent origin of cells out of a formative blastema.^ 
 The mechanism of cell-division was not precisely investigated until 
 long afterward, but the researches of Remak ('41), Kolliker ('44), 
 and others showed that an essential part of the process is a division 
 of both the nucleus and the cell-body. In 1855 {I.e., pp. 174, 175), and 
 again in 1858, Remak gave as the general result of his researches 
 the following synopsis or scheme of cell-division. Cell-division, he 
 asserted, proceeds from the centre toward the periphery. It begins 
 with the division of the nucleolus, is continued by simple constriction 
 and division of the nucleus, and is completed by division of the cell-
