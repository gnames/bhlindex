body and membrane (Fig. 24). For many years this account was 
 accepted, and no essential advance beyond Remak's scheme was 
 made for nearly twenty years. A number of isolated observations 
 were, however, from time to time made, even at a very early period, 
 which seemed to show that cell-division was by no means so simple 
 an operation as Remak believed. In some cases the nucleus seemed 
 to disappear entirely before cell-division (the germinal vesicle of the 
 ovum, according to Reichert, Von Baer, Robin, etc.); in others to 
 become lobed or star-shaped, as described by Virchow and by Remak 
 himself (Fig. 24,/). It was not until 1873 that the way was opened 
 for a better understanding of the matter. In this year the discoveries 
 of Anton Schneider, quickly followed by others in the same direction 
 by Biitschli, Fol, Strasburger, Van Beneden, Flemming, and Hertwig, 
 showed cell-division to be a far more elaborate process than had been 

supposed, and to involve a com- 
 plicated transformation of the 
 nucleus to which Schleicher 
 ('78) afterward gave the name 
 of karyokinesis. It soon ap- 
 peared, however, that this mode 
 of division was not of universal 
 occurrence ; and that cell-divi- 
 sion is of two widely different 
 types, which Van Beneden i^J^) 
 distinguished as fragmentation, 
 corresponding nearly to the 
 simple process described by 
 Remak, and division, involving 
 the more complicated process 
 of karyokinesis. Three years 
 later Flemming ('79) proposed to substitute for these the terms direct 
 and indirect division, which are still used. Still later ('82) the same 
 author suggested the terms mitosis (indirect or karyokinetic division) 
 and amitosis (direct or akinetic division), which have rapidly made 
 their way into general use, though the earher terms are often em- 
 ployed. 

Modern research has demonstrated the fact that amitosis or direct 
 division, regarded by Remak and his immediate followers as of uni- 
 versal occurrence, is in reality a rare and exceptional process ; and 
 there is reason to beUeve, furthermore, that it is especially char- 
 acteristic of highly specialized cells incapable of long-continued 
 multiplication or such as are in the early stages of degeneration, for 
 instance, in glandular epithelia and in the cells of transitory embry- 
 onic envelopes, where it is of frequent occurrence. Whether this
