 A. Resting cell with reticular nucleus and true nucleolus ; at c the attraction-sphere containing 
 two centrosomes. B. Early prophase ; the chromatin forming a continuous spireme, nucleolus still 
 present; above, the amphiaster (a). CD. Two different types of later prophases. C. Disappear- 
 ance of the primary spindle, divergence of the centrosomes to opposite poles of the nucleus (exam- 
 ples, some plant-cells, cleavage-stages of many eggs). D. Persistence of the primary spindle (to 
 form in some cases the " central spindle ") , fading of the nuclear membrane, ingrowth of the astral 
 rays, segmentation of the spireme-thread to form the chromosomes (examples, epidermal cells of 
 salamander, formation of the polar bodies). E. Later prophase of type C\ fading of the nuclear 
 membrane at the poles, formation of a new spindle inside the nucleus ; precocious splitting of the 
 chromosomes (the latter not characteristic of this type alone). F. The mitotic figure established; 
 £.p. the equatorial plate of chromosomes. {Cf. Figs. 21, 27, 32, etc.)
