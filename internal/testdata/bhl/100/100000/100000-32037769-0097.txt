known as the karyokinetic or mitotic figure. It may be described as 
 consisting of two distinct parts; namely, i, the chromatic figure, 
 formed by the deeply staining chromosomes ; and, 2, the achro^natic 
 figure, consisting of the spindle and asters which, in general, stain 
 but slightly. The fibrous substance of the achromatic figure is gener-

 paratory in character. The metaphase, which follows, forms the 
 initial phase of actual division. Each chromosome splits lengthwise 
 into two exactly similar halves, which afterward diverge to opposite 
 poles of the spindle, and here each group of daughter-chromosomes
