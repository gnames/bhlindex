finally gives rise to a daughter-nucleus (Fig. 26). In some cases 
 the splitting of the chromosomes cannot be seen until they have 
 grouped themselves in the equatorial plane of the spindle ; and it is 
 only in this case that the term "metaphase" can be applied to the 
 mitotic figure as a whole. In a large number of cases, however, the 
 splitting may take place at an earlier period in the spireme-stage, or 
 even, in a few cases, in the reticulum of the mother-nucleus (Figs. 
 54, 55). Such variations do not, however, affect the essential fact 
 that the chromatic nettvork is conve7'ted into a thread'^ which, whether 
 continuous or discontiniLOiis, splits throughout its entire length into 
 tzvo exactly equivalent halves. The splitting of the chromosomes, 
 discovered by Flemming in 1880, is the most significant and funda- 
 mental operation of cell-division ; for by it, as Roux first pointed out 
 ('83), the entire substance of the chromatic network is precisely halved, 
 and tJie daughter-nuclei receive precisely equivalent portions of chro- 
 matin from the mother-ntichms. It is very important to observe that 
 the nuclear division always shows this exact quality, whether division 
 of the cell-body be equal or unequal. The minute polar body, for 
 example (p. 238), receives exactly the same amount of chromatin as 
 the Q-^g, though the latter is of gigantic size as compared with the 
 former. On the other hand, the size of the asters varies with that 
 of the daughter-cells (Figs. 58, 175), though not in strict ratio. The 
 fact is one of great significance for the general theory of mitosis, 
 as will appear beyond. 

3. AnapJiases. â€” After splitting of the chromosomes, the daughter- 
 chromosomes, arranged in two corresponding groups,^ diverge to oppo- 
 site poles of the spindle, where they become closely crowded in a mass 
 near the centre of the aster. As they diverge, the two groups of 
 daughter-chromosomes are connected by a bundle of achromatic 
 fibres, stretching across the interval between them, and known as the 
 interzonal fibres or connecting fibres? In some cases these differ in a 
 marked degree from the other spindle-fibres ; and they are believed 
 by many observers to have an entirely different origin and function. 
 A view now widely held is that of Hermann, who regards these fibres 
 as belonging to a central spindle, surrounded by a peripheral layer 
 of mantlefibres to which the chromosomes are attached, and only 
 exposed to view as the chromosomes separate.* Almost invariably 
 in the division of plant-cells and often in that of animal cells these 

1 It was this fact that led Flemming to employ the word mitosis (/j-ltos, a thread). 

2 This stage is termed by Flemming the dyaster, a term which should, however, be aban- 
 doned in order to avoid confusion with the earlier word amphiaster. The latter convenient 
 and appropriate term clearly has priority.
