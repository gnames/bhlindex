fibres show during this period a series of deeply staining thickenings 
 in the equatorial plane forming the cell-plate or mid-body. In plant- 
 mitoses this is a very conspicuous structure (Fig. 34). In animal cells 
 the mid-body is usually less developed and sometimes rudimentary, 
 being represented by only a few granules or even a single one 
 (Fig. 29). Its later history is described below. 

4. Telophases. — In the final phases of mitosis, the entire cell 
 divides in two in a plane passing through the equator of the spindle, 
 each of the daughter-cells receiving a group of chromosomes, half of 
 the spindle, and one of the asters with its centrosome. Meanwhile, 
 a daughter-nucleus is reconstructed in each cell from the group of 
 chromosomes it contains. The nature of this process differs greatly 
 in different kinds of cells. Sometimes, as in the epithelial cells of 
 Amphibia, especially studied by Flemming and Rabl, and in many 
 plant-cells, the daughter-chromosomes become thickened, contorted, 
 and closely crowded to form a daugJiter-spirenie, closely similar to that 
 of the mother-nucleus (Fig. 29); this becomes surrounded by a mem- 
 brane, the threads give forth branches, and thus produce a reticular 
 nucleus. A somewhat similar set of changes takes place in the seg- 
 menting eggs of Ascaris (Van Beneden, Boveri). In other cases, as 
 in many segmenting ova, each chromosome gives rise to a hollow 
 vesicle, after which the vesicles fuse together to produce a single 
 nucleus (Fig. 52). When first formed, the daughter-nuclei are of 
 equal size. If, however, division of the cell-body has been unequal, 
 the nuclei become, in the end, correspondingly unequal — a fact 
 which, as Conklin and others have pointed out, proves that the size 
 of the nucleus is controlled by that of the cytoplasmic mass in which 
 it lies. 

The fate of the achromatic structures varies considerably, and has 
 been accurately determined in only a few cases. As a rule, the 
 spindle-fibres disappear more or less completely, but a portion of 
 their substance sometimes persists in a modified form {^e.g. the 
 Nebenkem, p. 163). In dividing plant-cells, the cell-plate finally 
 extends across the entire cell and splits into two layers, between 
 which appears the membrane by which the daughter-cells are cut 
 apart. ^ A nearly similar process occurs in a few animal cells,- but 
 as a rule the cell-plate is here greatly reduced and forms no mem- 
 brane, the cell dividing by constriction through the equatorial plane. 
 Even in this case, however, the division-plane is often indicated 
 before division takes place by a peculiar modification of the cyto- 
 plasm in the equatorial plane outside the spindle (Fig. 30). This 
 region is sometimes called the cytoplasmic plate, in contradistinction 
 to the spindlc-plate, or mid-body proper. In the prophases and meta-
