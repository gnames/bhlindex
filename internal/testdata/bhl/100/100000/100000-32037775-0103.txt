plasm. These investigators agreed that the amphiaster is formed 
 under the influence of the centrosome, which by its division creates 
 two new "centres of attraction" about which the astral systems arise, 
 and which form the foci of the entire dividing system. In them are 
 centred the fibrillae of the astral system, toward them the daughter-

 shown. H. Later anaphase (dyaster of Flemming) ; the central spindle fully exposed to .view ;

 Boveri f uUy recognized the importance of their discovery. " We are 
 justified," said Van Beneden, "in regarding the attraction-sphere with 
 its central corpuscle as forming a permanent organ, not only of the 
 early blastomeres, but of all cells, and as constituting a cell-organ equal
