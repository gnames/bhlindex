in rank to the nucleus itself ; and we may conclude that every central 
 corpuscle is derived from a preexisting corpuscle, every attraction- 
 sphere from a preexisting sphere, and that division of the sphere 
 precedes that of the cell-nucleus." ^ Boveri expressed himself in 
 similar terms regarding the centrosome in the same year ('87, 2, 
 p. 153), and the same general result was reached by Vejdovsky 
 nearly at the same time,^ though it was less clearly formulated than 
 by either Boveri or Van Beneden. 

All these observers agreed, therefore, that the achromatic figure 
 arose outside the nucleus, in the cytoplasm ; that the primary impulse 
 to cell-division was given, not by the nucleus, but by the centrosome, 
 and that a new cell-organ had been discovered whose special office

That the centrosome does in many cases, especially in embryonic 
 cells, behave in the manner stated by Van Beneden and Boveri seems 
 at present to admit of no doubt ; and it has been shown to occur in
