attached to the chromosomes, and being, according to Hermann, the 
 principal agents by which the daughter-chromosomes are dragged 
 apart. The mantle-fibres thus form two hollow cones or half-spin- 
 dles, separated at their bases by the chromosomes and completely 
 surrounding the continuous fibres of the central spindle, which come 
 into view as the "interzonal fibres" during the anaphases (Fig. 28). 
 There is still considerable uncertainty regarding the origin and 
 relation of these two sets of fibres. It is now generally agreed with 
 Van Beneden that the mantle-fibres are essentially a part of the 
 asters, i.e. are simply those astral rays that come into connection 
 with the chromosomes — 
 wholly cytoplasmic in ori- 
 gin (Hermann, Driiner, 
 MacFarland), or in part 
 cytoplasmic, in part dif- 
 ferentiated from the linin- 
 network (Flemming, 
 Meves). Driiner ('95), 
 Braus ('95) (salamander), 
 and MacFarland {Pleiiro- 
 phyllidia, '97) believe the 
 central spindle to arise 
 secondarily through the 
 union of two opposing 
 groups of astral rays in 
 the area between the 
 centrosomes. On the 
 other hand, Hermann 
 ('91), Flemming ('91), 
 Heidenhain ('94), Kos- 
 tanecki ('97), Van der 
 Stricht ('98), and others 
 believe the central spindle 
 to exist from the first in 
 the form of fibres stretching between the diverging centrosomes ; and 
 Heidenhain believes them to be developed from a special substance, 
 forming a "primary centrodesmus," which persists in the resting cell, 
 and in which the centrosomes are embedded.^ MacFarland's observa- 
 tions on gasteropod-eggs ('97) indicate that even nearly related forms 
 may differ in the origin of the central spindle, since in Pleiirophyllidia 
 it is of secondary origin, as described above, while in Diaulula it is a 
 primary structure developed from what he describes as the " centro- 
 some," but which, as shown at page 314, is probably to be regarded as
