an attraction-sphere surrounding the centrosomes, and is perhaps 
 comparable to Heidenhain's " centrodesmus." 

In the second type, illustrated in the cleavage of echinoderm, 
 anneHd, molluscan, and some other eggs, a central spindle may be 
 formed, — sometimes already during the anaphases of the preceding 
 mitosis (Figs. 99, 155), — but afterward disappears, the asters moving

to opposite poles of the nucleus. Between these two poles a new 
 spindle is then formed in the nuclear area, while astral rays grow 
 out into the cytoplasm. There is strong evidence that in this case 
 the entire spindle may arise inside the nucleus, i.e. from the sub- 
 stance of the linin-network, as occurs, for example, in the eggs of 
 echinoderms (Fig. 2$, E), and in the testis-cells of arthropods. In 
 other cases, however, a part at least of the spindle is of cytoplasmic
