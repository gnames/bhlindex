origin, since the ends of the spindle begin to form before dissolution 
 of the nuclear membrane, and the latter is pushed inwards in folds 
 by the ingrowing fibres (Figs. 25, C, 99).^ In some cases, however, 
 it seems certain that the nuclear membrane fades away before com- 
 pletion of the spindle (first maturation-division of Thalassema, Chce- 
 topteriLs), and it is probable that the middle region of the spindle is 
 here formed from the linin-network. In most, if not all, mitoses of 
 the second type the chromosomes do not form a ring about the 
 equator of the spindle, but extend in a fiat plate completely through

 of two kinds, viz. continuous fibres, which form the interzonal fibres 
 seen during the anaphases, and half-spindle fibres, extending only 
 from the poles to the chromosomes. It is possible that these two
