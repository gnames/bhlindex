spond in function to those of the central spindle and to the mantle- 
 fibres. It seems probable that the difference between the two types 
 of spindle-formation may be due to, or is correlated with, the fact 
 that the nuclear transformation takes place relatively earlier in the 
 first type. When the nucleus lags behind the spindle-formation the 
 centrosomes take up their position prematurely, as it were, the cen- 
 tral spindle disappearing to make way for the nucleus. 

It is in the mitosis of plant-cells that the most remarkable type of 
 achromatic figure has been observed. In some of the lower forms 
 (Algae) mitosis has been clearly shown to conform nearly to the 
 process observed in animal cells, the amphiaster being provided with 
 very large asters and distinct centrosomes, and its genesis corre- 
 sponding broadly with the second type described above (Figs. 32, 33), 
 though with some interesting modifications of detail.^ Swingle ('97) 
 describes in Stytopocaiilon a process closely similar to that seen in 
 many animal cells, the minute but very distinct centrosomes being 
 surrounded by quite typical cytoplasmic asters, passing to opposite 
 poles of the nucleus, and a spindle then developing between them 
 out of the achromatic nuclear substance (Fig. 32). In the flowering 
 plants and pteridophytes, on the other hand, mitosis seems to be of a 
 quite different type, apparently taking place in the enth^e absence of 
 centrosomes. Guignard ('91, i, '92, 2) clearly described and figured 
 typical centrosomes and attraction-spheres both in the ordinary 
 mitosis (Fig. 34) and in the fertilization of the higher plants, giving 
 an account of their behaviour nearly agreeing with the views then 
 prevailing among zoologists. Although these accounts have been 
 supported by some other workers,^ and have recently been in part 
 reiterated by Guignard himself ('98, i), they have not been sustained 
 by some of the best and most careful later observers, who describe a 
 mode of spindle-formation differing radically from that seen in thal- 
 lophytes and in animals generally.^ According to these observations, 
 begun by Farmer and Belajeff, and strongly sustained by the care- 
 ful studies of Osterhout, Mottier, Nemec, and others, the achromatic 
 figure is almost wholly of cytoplasmic origin, arising from a fibrillar 
 material (" kinoplasm " or " filar plasm," of Strasburger), which at the 
 beginning of mitosis forms a net-like mass surrounding the nucleus, 
 from which fibrillae radiate out into the cytoplasm. As the nuclear 
 membrane fades, these fibrillae, continually increasing, invade the 
 nuclear area, gather themselves into bundles, converging to a number
