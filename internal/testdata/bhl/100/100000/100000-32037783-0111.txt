of centres (without centrosomes), and thus give rise to an irregular 
 multipolar figure (Figs. 36, 133). This figure finally resolves itself 
 into a definite bipolar spindle which is devoid of centrosomes, and 
 in the earlier stages also of asters, though in the later phases some- 
 what irregular asters are formed. On the basis of these observations 
 Mottier ^ proposes to distinguish provisionally two well-defined types 
 of mitosis in plants which he designates as the "thallophyte " and the 
 "cormophyte" types. The latter seems wholly irreconcilable with 
 the process observed in animal-cells ; for the whole course of spindle- 
 formation seems diametrically opposed in the two cases, and should 
 the cormophyte-type be estabhshed it would, to say the least, greatly 
 restrict the application of the centrosome-theory of Van Beneden and 
 Boveri. Only future re- 
 search can definitely de- 
 termine the question. 
 There can be no doubt 
 that the descriptions of 
 Guignard and his follow- 
 ers do not rest upon pure 
 imagination ; for it is easy 
 to observe at the spindle- 
 poles in some prepara- 
 tions {e.g. sections of root- 
 tips of Allium, Lilium, 
 etc.) deeply staining- 
 bodies such as these 
 authors describe. These 
 "centrosomes" seem, 
 however, to be of quite 
 inconstant occurrence ; 
 and the careful studies of 
 Osterhout, Mottier, and Nemec seem to give good ground for the 
 conclusion that they have no such significance as the centrosomes of 
 lower plants or of animals. It should nevertheless be borne in mind 
 that true centrosomes (" blepharoplasts ") have been demonstrated in 
 the spermatogenic divisions of some of the vascular cryptogams, and 
 that analogous bodies occur in the corresponding divisions of the 
 cycads (p. 175). We should therefore still hold open the possibility 
 that centrosomes may occur in the vegetative mitoses of the higher 
 plants, their apparent absence being possibly due to lack of staining- 
 capacity or similar conditions rendering their demonstration difficult.^

"^ Mention may here be made of the barrel-shaped truncated spindles described in some 
 of the plants. In Basidiobolus, Fairchild ('97) finds spindles of this type, having no asters
