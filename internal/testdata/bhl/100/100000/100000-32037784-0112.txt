CELL-DIVISION 

A no less remarkable mode of spindle-formation, which is in a cer- 
 tain way intermediate between the cormophyte-type and the usual 
 animal type is described by Mead ('97, '98, i) in the first maturation- 
 division of ChcBtopteriis. Here the completed amphiaster is of quite 
 typical form, and the centrosomes persist for the following mitosis ; 
 yet Mead is convinced that the amphiaster is synthetically formed by 
 the union of two separate asters and centrosomes (Fig. 150) which

 A. Anaphase of the first division, showing the twelve daughter-chromosomes on each side, the 
 interzonal fibres stretching between them, and the centrosomes, already double, at the spindle- 
 poles. B. Later stage, showing the cell-plate at the equator of the spindle and the daughter- 
 spiremes (dispireme-stage of Flemming). C. Division completed; double centrosomes in the 
 resting cell. D. Ensuing division in progress ; the upper cell at the close of the prophases, the

 grounds, it is supported by very strong evidence,^ and, taken together

 similar spindles have been described by Strasburger ('80) in Spirogyra, and in the embryo- 
 sac of Monotropa. It is not impossible that such spindles may represent a type intermediate 
 between the " cormoptyte " and " thallophyte " types of Mottier.
