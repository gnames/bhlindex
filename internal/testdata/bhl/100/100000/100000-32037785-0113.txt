with the facts described in plants, it indicates that the forces involved 
 in spindle-formation are far more complex than Van Beneden's and 
 Boveri's hypothesis would lead one to suppose.^ 

The centrosome and centrosphere appear to present great varia- 
 tions that have not yet been thoroughly cleared up and will be more 
 critically discussed beyond.^ They are known to undergo extensive 
 changes in the cycle of cell-division and to vary greatly in different 
 forms (Fig. 152). In some cases the aster contains at its centre 
 nothing more than a minute deeply staining granule, which doubtless

 rounded by a larger body, which in turn lies within the centrosphere 
 or attraction-sphere. In .still other cases the centre of the aster is 
 occupied by a large reticular mass, within which no smaller body can 
 be distinguished {e.g. in pigment-cells) ; this mass is sometimes called 
 the centrosome, sometimes the centrosphere. Sometimes, again, the 
 spindle-fibres are not focussed at a single point, and the spindle
