S6 CELL-DIVISION 

appears truncated at the ends, its fibres terminating in a transverse 
 row of granules (maturation-spindles of Ascaris, and some plant-cells). 
 It is not entirely certain, however, that such spindles observed in 
 preparations represent the normal structure during life. 

b. The Chromatic Figure. â€” The variations of the chromatic 
 figure must for the most part be considered in the more special 
 parts of this work. There seems to be no doubt that a single 
 continuous spireme-thread may be formed {cf. p. 113), but it is 
 equally certain that the thread may appear from the beginning 
 in a number of distinct segments, i.e. as a segmented spireme, 
 and there are some cases in which no distinct spireme can be 
 seen, the reticulum resolving itself directly into the chromosomes. 
 The chromosomes, when fully formed, vary greatly in appear- 
 ance. In many of the tissues of adult plants and animals they 
 are rod-shaped and are often bent in the middle Hke a V (Figs. 
 28, 131). They often have this form, too, in embryonic cells, as 
 in the segmentation-stages of the Qgg in Ascaris (Fig. 31) and 
 other forms. The rods may, however, be short and straight (seg- 
 menting eggs of echinoderms, etc.), and may be reduced to spheres, 
 as in the maturation-stages of the germ-cells. In the equatorial plate 
 the V-shaped chromosomes are placed with the apex of the V turned 
 toward the spindle (Fig. 28), while the straight rods are placed 
 with one end toward the spindle. In either case the daughter- 
 chromosomes first begin to move apart at the point nearest the 
 spindle, the separation proceeding thence toward the free portion. 
 The V-shaped chromosomes, opening apart from the apex, thus give 
 rise in the early anaphase to < >-shaped figures ; while rod-shaped 
 chromosomes often produce a- and _L-shaped figures (the stem of the 
 _L being double). The latter, opening farther apart, form straight 
 rods twice the length of the original chromosome (since each consists 
 of two daughter-chromosomes joined at one end). This rod finally 
 breaks across the middle, thus giving the deceptive appearance of a 
 transverse instead of a longitudinal division (Fig. 52). The <>- 
 shaped figures referred to above are nearly related to those that 
 occur in the so-called heterotypical mitosis. Under this name Flem- 
 ming ('87) first described a peculiar modification of the division of the 
 chromosomes that has since been shown to be of very great impor- 
 tance in the early history of the germ-cells, though it is not confined 
 to them. In this form the chromosomes split at an early period, but 
 the halves remain united by their ends. Each double chromosome 
 then opens out to form a closed ring (Fig. 37), which by its mode of 
 origin is shown to represent two daughter-chromosomes, each forming 
 half of the ring, united by their ends. The ring finally breaks in two 
 to form two U-shaped chromosomes which diverge to opposite poles
