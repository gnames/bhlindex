of the spindle as usual. As will be shown in Chapter V.,the divisions 
 by which the germ-cells are matured are in many cases of this type ; 
 but the primary rings here in many cases represent not two but four 
 chromosomes, into which they afterward break up.

 A. Prophase, chromosomes in the form of scattered rings, each of which represents U\o 
 daughter-chromosomes joined end to end. B. The rings ranged about the equator of the spindle 
 and dividing ; the swellings indicate the ends of the chromosomes. C. The same viewed from the 
 spindle-pole. D. Diagram (Hermann) showing the central spindle, asters, and centrosomes, and 
 the contractile mantle-fibres attached to the rings (one of the latter dividing). 

2. Bivalent and Plurivalent Chromosomes 

The last paragraph leads to the consideration of certain varia- 
 tions in the number of the chromosomes. Boveri discovered that the 
 species Ascaris megalocephala comprises two varieties which differ in 
 no visible respect save in the number of chromosomes, the germ-nuclei 
 of one form (" variety bivalens " of Hertwig) having two chromosomes,
