88 CELL-DIVISION 

while in the other form (" variety univalens ") there is but one. Brauer 
 discovered a similar fact in the phyllopod Artemia, the number of 
 somatic chromosomes being i68 in some individuals, in others only 
 84 (p. 281). 
 , It will appear hereafter that in some cases the primordial germ- 
 cells show only half the usual number of chromosomes, and in 
 Cyclops the same is true, according to Hacker, of all the cells of 
 the early cleavage-stages. 

In all cases where the number of chromosomes is apparently 
 reduced (" pseudo-reduction " of Riickert) it is highly probable that 
 each chromatin-rod represents not one but two or more chromosomes 
 united together, and Hacker has accordingly proposed the terms 
 bivaleitt and phirivalent for such chromatin-rods.^ The truth 
 of this view, which originated with Vom Rath, is, I think, conclusively 
 shown by the case of Artemia described at page 281, and by many facts 
 in the maturation of the germ-cells hereafter considered. In Ascaris 
 we may regard the chromosomes of Hertwig's "variety univalens" 
 as really bivalent or double, i.e. equivalent to two such chromosomes 
 as appear in "variety bivalens." These latter, however, are probably 
 in their turn plurivalent, i.e. represent a number of units of a lower 
 order united together; for, as described at page 148, each of these 
 normally breaks up in the somatic cells into a large number of shorter 
 chromosomes closely similar to those of the related species Ascaris 
 Iwjibricoides, where the normal number is 24. 

Hacker has called attention to the striking fact that plurivalent 
 mitosis is very often of the heterotypical form, as is very common 
 in the maturation-mitoses of many animals (Chapter V.), and often 
 occurs in the early cleavages of Ascai^is ; but it is doubtful whether 
 this is a universal rule. 

3. Mitosis in the Unicelhtlar Plants and Animals 

The process of mitosis in the one-celled plants and animals has a 
 peculiar interest, for it is here that we must look for indications of 
 its historical origin. But although traces of mitotic division were 
 seen in the Infusoria by Balbiani ('58-'6i), Stein ('59), and others 
 long before it was known in the higher forms, it has only recently 
 received adequate attention and is still imperfectly understood. 

Mitotic division has now been observed in many of the main divi- 
 sions of Protozoa and unicellular plants ; but in the present state of 

1 The words bivalejit and univalent have been used in precisely the opposite sense 
 by Hertwig in the case of Ascaris, the former term being appUed to that variety having two 
 chromosomes in the germ-cells, the latter to the variety with one. These terms certainly 
 have priority, but were applied only to a specific case. Hacker's use of the words, which is 
 strictly in accordance with their etymology, is too valuable for general descriptive purposes to 
 be rejected.
