the subject it must be left an open question whether it occurs in all. 
 In some of the gregarines and Heliozoa, the process is of nearly or 
 quite the same type as in the Metazoa. From such mitoses, how- 
 ever, various gradations may be traced toward a much simpler pro- 
 cess, such as occurs in Aniceba and the lower flagellates ; and it is not 
 improbable that we have here representatives of more primitive con- 
 ditions. Among the more interesting of these modifications may be 
 mentioned : —

the nuclear membrane may persist more or less completely through 
 every stage {Noctihica, EiiglypJia, ActinospJicEriiini). 

2. Asters maybe present (Hehozoa, gregarines) or wanting (In- 
 fusoria, Radiolaria). 

3. In one series of forms the centrosome or sphere is represented 
 by a persistent intranuclear body (nucleolo-ccntrosome) of consider- 
 able size, which divides to form a kind of central spindle {Eiig/iua 
 Amoeba, Infusoria .?). 

4. In a second series the centrosome or sphere is a persistent
