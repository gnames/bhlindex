hemispherical "end-plate" or "pole-plate" is situated at either pole 
 of the spindle, and Hertwig's observations indicated, though they 
 did not prove, that these plates arose by the division of a large 
 " nucleolus." Nearly similar pole-plates were somewhat described by 
 Schewiakoff ('88) in Eiiglypha (Fig. 39), and it seems clear that they 
 are the analogues of the centrosomes or attraction-spheres in higher 
 forms. In EtLglena, as shown by Keuten, the pole-plates, or their 
 analogues, certainly arise by division of a distinct and persistent intra- 
 nuclear body ("nucleolus" or " nucleolo-centrosome ") which elon-

gates to form a kind of central spindle around which the chromatin 
 elements are grouped (Fig. 40); and Schaudinn ("95) described a 
 similar process in Aviwba. Richard Hertwig's latest work on 
 Infusoria ('95) indicates that a similar process occurs in the micro- 
 nuclei of Parantceciuni, which at first contain a large " nucleolus " 
 and afterward a conspicuous pole-plate at either end of the spindle 
 (Fig. 38, D-H). The origin of the pole-plates was not, however, 
 positively determined. A corresponding dividing body is found in 
 Ccratijini (Lauterborn, '95), and as in the Infusoria the entire 
 nucleus transforms itself into a fibrillar spindle-like body.
