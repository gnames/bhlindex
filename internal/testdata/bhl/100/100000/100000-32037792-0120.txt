92 CELL-DIVISION 

Still simpler conditions are found in some of the flagellates. ^ In 
 Chilonwnas the sphere may still be regarded as intranuclear, since it 
 lies in the middle of an irregular mass of chromatin-granules, though 
 the latter are apparently not enclosed by a membrane. Nuclear 
 division is here accomplished by fission of the sphere and the aggre- 
 gation of the chromatin-granules around the two products. In 
 Tetramitus, finally (Fig. i6), the nucleus is represented by chromatin- 
 granules that are scattered irregularly through the cell and only at 
 the time of division collect about the dividing sphere.

In a second series of forms, represented by Noctiliica (Ishikawa, 
 '94, '98), (Calkins, '98, 2), Parainoeba (Schaudinn, '96, i), Actinophrys 
 and AcantJiocystis (Schaudinn, '96, 2), and the diatoms (Lauterborn, 
 '96), the sphere lies outside the nucleus in the cytoplasm and the 
 mitosis is closely similar to that observed in most Metazoa. This is 
 most striking in the Heliozoa, where the centrosome persists through 
 the vegetative condition of the cell as the " central granule," to which 
 the axial filaments of the pseudopodia converge. Schaudinn ('96, 2) 
 shows that by the division of this body a typical extranuclear amphi- 
 aster and central spindle are formed (Fig. 41), while the chromatin
