the diatoms {Surirella, t. Lauterborn), where the central spindle, 
 arising by a peculiar process from an extranuclear centrosome, 
 (sphere ?) sinks into the nucleus in a manner strongly suggesting that 
 observed in Noctihica. 

In the interesting form Paramoeba, as described by Schaudinn 
 ('96, i), the sphere (" Nebenkorper "), which is nearly as large as the 
 nucleus, divides to form a central spindle, about the equator of which 
 the chromatin-elements become arranged in a ring (Fig. 43) ; but no 
 centrosome has yet been demonstrated in the sphere. Parainccba 
 appears to differ from Eiiglena mainly in the fact that at the close of 
 division the sphere is in the former left outside the daughter-nucleus 
 and in the latter enclosed within it.^ The connecting link is perfectly 
 given by Tetramitus, where no morphological nucleus is formed, and 
 the sphere lies in the general cell-substance (p. 92); and we could 
 have no clearer demonstration that the extra- or intranuclear position 
 of sphere or centrosome is of quite secondary importance. As 
 regards the formation of the spheres (pole-plates) ActinosphcBriuni 
 (Figs. 44, 45) seems to show a simpler condition than any of the 
 above forms, since no permanent sphere exists, and Brauer ('94) and 
 R. Hertwig ('98) agree that the pole-plates are formed by a gradual 
 accumulation of the achromatic substance of the nucleus at opposite 
 poles. 

A distinct centrosome (centriole .-') in the interior of the sphere has 
 thus far only been observed in a few forms {Noctihica, ActmospJicB- 
 riitni), and neither its origin nor its relation to the sphere has yet 
 been sufficiently cleared up. Both Ishikawa ('94) and Calkins ('98, 2) 
 somewhat doubtfully concluded that in Noctihica the centrosomes 
 arise within the nucleus, migrating thence out into the extranuclear 
 sphere. With this agree R. Hertwig's latest studies on ActinospJicE- 
 riiini ('98), the spindle-poles being first formed from the pole-plates 
 (themselves of nuclear origin), and the centrosomes then passing into 
 them from the nucleus. Hertwig reaches the further remarkable 
 conclusion that the centrosomes arise as portions of the cJiToviatin- 
 netzvork extruded at the nuclear poles (Fig. 45), first forming a 
 spongy irregular mass, but afterward condensing into a deeply 
 staining pair of granules which pass to the respective poles of the 
 spindle. It is a remarkable fact that these centrosomes are only 
 found in the two maturation-divisions, and are absent from the ordi- 
 nary vegetative mitoses where the spindle-poles are formed by two 
 cytoplasmic masses derived, as Hertwig believes, from the intra- 
 nuclear plates. Schaudinn ('96, 3) likewise describes and clearly 
 figures an intranuclear origin of the centrosome in buds of Acantho- 
 cystis (Fig. 41), which are derived by direct division of the mother-
