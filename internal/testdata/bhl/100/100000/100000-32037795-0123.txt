nucleus with no trace of a centrosome. In this same form, as 
 described above, the ordinary vegetative mitoses are quite of the 
 metazoan type, with a persistent extranuclear centrosome. 

The history of the chromatin in the mitosis of unicellular forms 
 shows some interesting modifications. In a considerable number of 
 forms a more or less clearly marked spireme-stage precedes the forma- 
 tion of chromosomes (diatoms. Infusoria, dinoflagellates, Eiiglypha); 
 in others, long chromosomes are formed without a distinct spireme- 
 stage {Noctiluca). It has been clearly demonstrated that in some 
 cases these chromosomes split lengthwise, as in Metazoa {Noctiluca,

diatoms, Actinophrys, probably in EuglypJia) ; but in some cases they 
 are stated to divide transversely in the middle (Infusoria according 
 to Hertwig, Ccratinm according to Lauterborn). These chromosomes 
 appear always to arise, as in Metazoa, through the linear arrangement 
 of chromatin-granules {Noctiluca, ActinospJicerium, Etiglena), which 
 themselves in many cases arise by the preliminary fragmentation of 
 one or more large chromatin-masses {e.g. in A\}ctiliica or ActiiiospJicz- 
 riiint). In other forms no such linear aggregates are formed, and 
 direct fission of the chromatin-granules appears to take place without 
 the formation of bodies morphologically comparable with the chromo- 
 somes of such forms as Noctiluca. This is apparently the case in 
 Tetrainitus, and AcJiroviatiuvi, other forms having a distributed
