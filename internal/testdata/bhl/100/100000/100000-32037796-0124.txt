A. Nucleus and surrounding structures in the early prophase ; above and below the reticular 
 nucleus lie the semilunar " pole-plates," and outside these the cytoplasmic masses in which the

 showing equatorial plate, intra-nuclear spindle, and pole-plates {p.p.). C. Equatorial plate,

 Brauer's conclusion that the essential fact in the history of the chro- 
 matin in mitosis is the fission of the individual granules.^
