4. Pathological Mitoses 

Under certain circumstances the delicate mechanism of cell-division 
 may become deranged, and so give rise to various forms of patho- 
 logical mitoses. Such a miscarriage may be artificially produced, as 
 Hertwig, Galeotti, and others have shown, by treating the dividing 
 cells with poisons and other chemical substances (quinine, chloral, 
 nicotine, potassic iodide, etc.). Pathological mitoses may, however.

occur without discoverable external cause ; and it is a very interestino- 
 fact, as Klebs, Hansemann, and Galeotti have especially pointed out, 
 that they are of frequent occurrence in abnormal growths such as 
 cancers and tumours. 

The abnormal forms of mitoses are arranged by Hansemann in two 
 general groups, as follows: (i) asymmetrical mitoses, in which the 
 chromosomes are unequally distributed to the daughter-cells, and (2) 
 multipolar mitoses, in which the number of centrosomes is more than
