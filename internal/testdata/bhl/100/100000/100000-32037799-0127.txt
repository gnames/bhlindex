DETAILS OF MITOSIS

Normal multipolar mitoses, though rare, sometimes occur, as in the 
 division of the pollen-mother-cells and the endosperm-cells of flower- 
 ing plants (Strasburger) ; but such mitotic figures arise through the 
 union of two or more bipolar amphiasters in a syncytium and are 
 due to a rapid succession of the nuclear divisions unaccompanied by 
 fission of the cell-substance. These are not to be confounded with 
 pathological mitoses arising by premature or abnormal division of the 
 centrosome. If one centrosome divide, while the other does not, 
 triasters are produced, from which may arise three cells or a tri- 
 nucleated cell. If both centrosomes divide, tetrasters or polyasters 
 are formed. Here again the same result has been artificially attained 
 by chemical stimulus {cf. Schottlander, 'Z"^). Multipolar mitoses are

also common in regenerating tissues after irritative stimulus (Strobe); 
 but it is uncertain whether such mitoses lead to the formation of 
 normal tissue.^ 

The frequency of abnormal mitoses in pathological growths is a 
 most suggestive fact, but it is still wholly undetermined whether the 
 abnormal mode of cell-division is the cause of the disease or the 
 reverse. The latter seems the more probable alternative, since nor- 
 mal mitosis is certainly the rule in abnormal growths ; and Galeotti's 
 experiments suggest that the pathological mitoses in such growths 
 may be caused by the presence of deleterious chemical products in 
 the diseased tissue, and perhaps point the way to their medical 
 treatment.
