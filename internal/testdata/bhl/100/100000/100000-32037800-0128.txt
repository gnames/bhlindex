D. The Mechanism of Mitosis 

We now pass to a consideration of the forces at work in mitotic 
 division, which leads us into one of the most debatable fields of 

cytological inquiry.

A. Early anaphase; each chromosome has divided 
 into two. B. Later anaphase during divergence of the 
 daughter-chromosomes, a.c. Antipodal cone of astral 
 rays ; c.z. cortical zone of the attraction-sphere ; i. inter- 
 zonal fibres stretching between the daughter-chromo- 
 somes ; m.z. medullary zone of the attraction-sphere ; 
 p.c. principal cone, forming one-half of the contractile 
 spindle (the action of these fibres is reenforced by that of 
 the antipodal cone) ; s.e.c. subequatorial circle, to which 
 the astral rays are attached. 

All observers agree that 
 the amphiaster is in some 
 manner an expression of 
 the forces by which cell- 
 division is caused, and 
 many accept, in one form 
 or another, the first view 
 clearly stated by Fol,^ that 
 the asters represent in 
 some manner centres of 
 attractive forces focussed 
 in the centrosome or dy- 
 namic centre of the cell. 
 Regarding the nature of 
 these forces, there is, how- 
 ever, so wide a divergence 
 of opinion as to compel the 
 admission that we have 
 thus far accomplished little 
 more than to clear the 
 ground for a precise in- 
 vestigation of the subject; 
 and the mechanism of mi- 
 tosis still lies before us as 
 one of the most fascinating 
 problems of cytology. 

{a) The TJieory of Fi- 
 brillar Contractility . — The 
 view that has taken the 
 strongest hold on recent 
 research is the hypothesis 

First 
 ently put 

suggested 

of fibrillar contractility. 

by Klein in 1878, this hypothesis was independ- 

forward by Van Beneden in 1883, and fully outlined
