precisely like that of muscle-fibres ; and it is difficult to study Boveri's 
 beautiful figures and clear descriptions without sharing his conviction 
 that "of the contractility of the fibrillae there can be no doubt." ^ 

Very convincing evidence in the same direction is afforded by 
 pigment-cells and leucocytes or wandering cells, in both of which 
 there is a very large permanent aster (attraction-sphere) even in the 
 resting cell. The structure of the aster in the leucocyte, where it 
 was first discovered by Flemming in 1891, has been studied very 
 carefully by Heidenhain in the salamander. The astral rays here 
 extend throughout nearly the whole cell (Fig. 49), and are believed

by Heidenhain to represent the contractile elements by means of 
 which the cell changes its form and creeps about. A similar con- 
 clusion was reached by Solger ('91) and Zimmermann ('93, 2) in the 
 case of pigment-cells (chromatophores) in fishes. These cells have, 
 in an extraordinary degree, the power of changing their form and of 
 actively creeping about. Solger and Zimmermann have shown that 
 the pigment-cell contains an enormous aster, whose rays extend in 
 every direction through the pigment-mass, and it is almost impos- 
 sible to doubt that the aster is a contractile apparatus, like a radial 
 muscular system, by means of which the active changes of form are 
 produced (Fig. 50). This interpretation of the aster receives addi- 
 tional support through Schaudinn's ('96, 3) highly interesting dis-
