covery that the " central granule " of the Heliozoa is to be identified 
 with the centrosome and plays the same role in mitosis (Fig. 41). 
 In these animals the axial filaments of the radiating pseudopodia con- 
 verge to the central granule during the vegetative state of the cell, 
 thus forming a permanent aster which Schaudinn's observations prove 
 to be directly comparable to that of a leucocyte or of a mitotic figure. 
 There is in this case no doubt of the contractility of the rays, and- a

strong, if indirect, argument is thus given in favour of contractility in 
 other forms of asters. ^ The contraction-hypothesis is beautifully 
 illustrated by means of a simple and easily constructed model, devised 
 by Heidenhain ('94, '96), which closely simulates some of the phenom- 
 ena of mitosis. In its simplest form the model consists of a circle, 
 marked on a flat surface, to the periphery of which are attached at equal
