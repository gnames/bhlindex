intervals a series of rub- 
 ber bands (astral rays). 
 At the other ends these 
 bands are attached to a 
 pair of small rings (cen- 
 trosomes) fastened to- 
 gether. In the position 
 of equilibrium, when the 
 rays are stretched at 
 equal tension, the rays 
 form a symmetrical aster 
 with the centrosomes at 
 the centre of the circle 
 (Fig. 51, ^). If the con- 
 nection between the cen- 
 trosomes be severed, they 
 are immediately dragged 
 apart to a new position of 
 equilibrium with the rays 
 grouped in two asters, as 
 in the actual cell (dotted 
 lines in Fig. 51, A). If 
 a round pasteboard box 
 of suitable size (nucleus) 
 be inserted between two 
 of the rays, it assumes 
 an eccentric position, the 
 cell-axis being formed by 
 a line passing through its 
 centre and that of the 
 pair of small rings {cf. 
 the epithelial cell, p. 57), 
 and upon division of the 
 aster it takes up a position 
 between the two asters.
