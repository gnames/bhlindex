THE MECHANISM OF MITOSIS

divide without any amphiaster whatever. In Infusoria mitosis seems 
 to occur in the entire absence of asters, although the cells divide by 
 constriction, and the analogy with Heidenhain's model entirely fails.

Fig. 52. — The later stages of mitosis in the egg of the sea-urchin Toxopucustes {A-D, X 1000; 
 E-I\ X 500). 

A. Metaphase ; daughter-chromosomes drawing apart but still united at one end. B. Daugh- 
 ter-chromosomes separating. C. Late anaphase ; daughter-chromosomes lying near the spindle- 
 poles. D. Final anaphase ; daughter chromosomes converted into vesicles. E. Immediately 
 after division, the asters undivided ; the spindle has disappeared. F. Resting 2-cell stage, the 
 asters divided into two in anticipation of the next division. 

In Figs, ^l and /? the centrosome consists of a mass of intensely staining granules, which in 
 Cand D elongates at right angles to the spindle-axis. In /^the centrosome appears as a single 
 or double granule, which in later stages gives rise to a pluricorpuscular centrum like that in A. 
 The connection between D and F\s not definitely determined. 

In EuglypJia, according to Schewiakoff (Fig. 39), division of the cell- 
 body appears to take place quite independently of the mitotic figure. 
 Again, a considerable number of cases are now known in which dur- 
 ing the fertilization of the Q%g a large amphiaster is formed, with
