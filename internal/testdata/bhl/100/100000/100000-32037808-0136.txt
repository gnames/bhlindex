I08 CELL-DIVISION 

astral rays sometimes extending throughout almost the entire egg, 
 only to disappear or become greatly reduced without the occurrence 
 of division, the ensuing cleavage being effected by a new amphiaster 
 or by the recrudescence of the old.^ For these and other reasons we 
 must admit the probabihty that contractility of the astral fibrillae, if 
 it exists, is but the expression or consequence of a more deeply lying 
 phenomena of more general significance. The subtlety of the prob- 
 lem is strikingly shown by Boveri's remarkable observations on 
 abnormal sea-urchin eggs ('96), which show (i) that the periodic 
 division of the centrosome and formation of the amphiaster may take 
 place independently of the nucleus ; (2) that the spindle, as well as 
 the asters, is concerned in division of the cell-body ; and C3) that an 
 amphiaster without chromosomes is unable to effect normal division 
 of the cell-body. The first and third of these facts are shown by eggs 
 in which during the first cleavage all of the chromatin passes to one 
 pole of the spindle, so that one of the resulting halves of the Q,^g 
 receives no nucleus, but only a centrosome and aster. In this half 
 perfect amphiasters are formed simultaneously with each cleavage in 
 the other half, yet no division of the pi'otoplasniic mass occurs?' The 
 second fact is shown in polyspermic eggs, in which multipolar astral 
 systems are formed by union of the several sperm-asters (Figs. 53, loi). 
 In such eggs cleavages only occur betiucen asters that are joined by a 
 spindle. Normal cleavage of the cell-body thus requires the complete 
 apparatus of mitosis, and even though the fibres be contractile they 
 cannot fully operate in the absence of chromatin. 

We may now turn to theories based on the hypothesis, first sug- 
 gested by Fol in 1873, that the astral foci {i.e. centrosomes) represent 
 dynamic centres of attractive or other forces. It should be noted that 
 this hypothesis involves two distinct questions, one relating to the 
 origin of the amphiaster, the other to its mode of action ; and we have 
 seen that some of the foremost advocates of the contraction-hypothesis, 
 including Van Beneden and Boveri, have held the centrosomes to be 
 attractive centres. Apart from the movements of the chromosomes, 
 the most obvious indication that the centrosomes are dynamic centres 
 is the extraordinary resemblance of the amphiaster to the lines of force 
 in a magnetic field as shown by the arrangement of iron-filings about 
 the poles of a horseshoe magnet â€” a resemblance pointed out by Fol 
 himself, and urged by many later writers,^ especially Ziegler ('95)

2 This result is opposed to Boveri's earlier work on Ascaris (p. 355), and is modified by 
 Ziegler ('98), who observed in a single case that an irregular cleavage occurred in the 
 enucleated half after two or three divisions of the centrosome. On the other hand, it is sup- 
 ported by Morgan's convincing experiments on the eggs oi Arbacia (p. 308).

 the amphiaster is produced by fine crystals of sulphate of quinine (a semiconductor) sus-
