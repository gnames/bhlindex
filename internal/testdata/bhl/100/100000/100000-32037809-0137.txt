and Gallardo ('96, '97). It is impossible to regard this analogy as 
 exact ; first, because it is inconsistent with the occurrence of tripolar 
 astral figures ; second, as Meves has recently urged ^ the course of the 
 astral fibres does not really coincide with the lines of force, the most 
 important deviation being the crossing of the rays opposite the equa- 
 torial region of the spindle, which is impossible in the magnetic or 
 electric field. We must, however, remember that the amphiaster is 
 formed in a viscid medium, that it may perform various movements, 
 and that its fibres probably possess the power of active growth. The

physical or chemical effect of the centres, through which the amphias- 
 ter primarily arises, may thus be variously disturbed or modified in 
 later stages, and the crossing of the rays is therefore not necessarily 
 fatal to the assumption of dynamic centres. Butschli ('92, '98) has, 
 moreover, recently shown that a close simulacruin of the amphiaster, 
 showing a distinct crossing of the rays, may be produced in an arti- 
 ficial alveolar structure (coagulated gelatine) by tractive forces cen- 

pendcd in spirits of turpentine (a poor conductor) between two electric poles. This experi- 
 ment, devised by Faraday, has recently been applied by Gallardo ('96, '97) to an analysis 
 of the mitotic figure. ^ '96, p. 371.
