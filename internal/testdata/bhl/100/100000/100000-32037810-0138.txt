tring in two adjacent points. This result is obtained by warming and 
 then cooling a film of thick gelatine-solution, filled with air-bubbles, 
 and then coagulating the mass in chromic acid. Such a film shows a 
 fine alveolar structure, which assumes a radial arrangement about the 
 air-bubbles, owing to the traction exerted on the surrounding structure 
 by shrinkage of the bubbles on cooling. The amphiastral simulacra 
 are produced about two adjacent bubbles, â€” a " spindle " being formed 
 between them, and the " astral rays " sometimes showing a crossing 
 like that seen in the actual amphiaster (Biitschli is himself unable to 
 explain fully how the crossing arises). The protoplasmic asters are 
 maintained by Biitschli to be, in like manner, no more than a radial 
 configuration of the alveolar cell-substance caused by centripetal 
 diffusion-currents toward the astral centres.^ The most interesting 
 part of this view is the assumption that these currents are caused by 
 specific chemical changes taking place in the centrosom.e which causes 
 an absorption of liquid from the surrounding region. " The astral 
 bodies are structures which, under certain circumstances, function in 
 a measure as centres from which emanate chemical actions upon pro- 
 toplasm and nucleus ; and the astral phenomena which appear about 
 the centrosomes are only a result incidental to this action of the central 
 bodies upon the plasma." ^ Through centripetal currents thus caused 
 arise the asters, and they may even account, in a measure, for the move- 
 ments of the chromosomes.^ This latter part of Butschh's conception 
 is, I believe, quite inadequate; but the hypothesis of definite chemical 
 activity in the centrosome is a highly important one, which is sustained 
 by the staining-reactions of the centrosome and by its definite morpho- 
 logical changes during the cycle of cell-division. 

More or less similar chemical hypotheses have been suggested by 
 several other writers.^ Of these perhaps the most interesting is 
 Strasburger's suggestion,^ that the movements of the chromosomes 
 may be of a chemotactic character, which I suspect may prove to have 
 been one of the most fruitful contributions to the subject. Beside this 
 may be placed Carnoy's still earlier hypothesis ('85), that the asters 
 are formed under the influence of specific ferments emanating from 
 the poles of the nucleus. Mathews ('99, 2) has recently pointed out 
 that there is a considerable analogy between the formation of the 
 astral rays and that of fibrin-fibrils under the influence of fibrin-fer- 
 ment, adding the suggestion that the centrosome may actually contain 

1 Carnoy ('85) and Plainer ('86) had previously held a similar view, suggesting that not 
 only the spindle-formation, but also the movements of the chromosomes, might be explained 
 as the result of protoplasmic currents.
