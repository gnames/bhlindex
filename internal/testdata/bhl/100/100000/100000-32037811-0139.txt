THE MECHANISM OF MITOSIS 1 1 1 

fibrin-ferment. Attention may be called here to the fact, now definitely 
 determined by experiment/ that cell-division may be incited by chemi- 
 cal stimulus. In most of the cases thus far experimentally examined 
 the divisions so caused are pathological in character, but in others 
 they are quite normal, as shown in Loeb's remarkable results on the 
 production of parthenogenesis in sea-urchin eggs by chemical stimulus, 
 as described at pages 215 and 308. While these experiments by no 
 means show that division is itself merely a chemical process, they 
 strongly suggest that it cannot be adequately analyzed without reckon- 
 ing with the chemical changes involved in it. 

Risume. A review of the foregoing facts and theories shows how 
 far we still are from any real understanding of the process involved 
 either in the origin or in the mode of action of the mitotic figure. The 
 evidence seems well-nigh demonstrative, in case of the mantle-fibres 
 and the astral rays, that Van Beneden's hypothesis contains an element 
 of truth, but we must now recognize that it was formulated in too 
 simple a form for the solution of so complex a problem. No satisfac- 
 tory hypothesis can, I believe, be reached that does not reckon with 
 the chemical changes occurring at the spindle-poles and in the nucleus ; 
 and these changes are probably concerned not only with the origin of 
 the amphiaster, but also with the movements of the chromosomes. In 
 cases where the centrosome persists from cell to cell we may perhaps 
 regard it as the vehicle of specific substances (ferments .'*) which become 
 active at the onset of mitosis, and run through a definite cycle of 
 changes, to initiate a like cycle in the following generation ; and it is 
 quite conceivable that such substances may persist at the nuclear poles, 
 or may be re-formed there as an after-effect, even though the formed 
 centrosome disappears.^ In this consideration we may find a clue to 
 the strange fact — should it indeed prove to be a fact — that the cen- 
 trosome may divide, yet afterward disappear without discoverable 
 connection with the centrosomes of the succeeding mitosis, as several 
 recent observers have maintained. ^ When all is said, we must admit 
 that the mechanism of mitosis in every phase still awaits adequate 
 physiological analysis. The suggestive experiments of Butschli and 
 Heidenhain lead us to hope that a partial solution of the problem may 
 be reached along the lines of physical and chemical experiment. At 
 present we can only admit that none of the conclusions thus far 
 reached, whether by observation or by experiment, are more than the 
 first naive attempts to analyze a group of most complex phenomena 
 of which we have little real understanding.
