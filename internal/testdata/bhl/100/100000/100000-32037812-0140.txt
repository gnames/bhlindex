2. Division of the Chromosomes 

In developing his theory of fibrillar contractility, Van Beneden 
 expressed the view — only, however, as a possibility — that the 
 splitting of the chromosomes might be passively caused by the con- 
 tractions of the two sets of opposing spindle-fibres to which each is 
 attached.^ Later observations have demonstrated that this sugges- 
 tion cannot be sustained ; for in many cases the chromatin-thread 
 splits before division of the centrosome and the formation of the 
 achromatic figure — sometimes during the spireme-stage, or even in 
 the reticulum, while the nuclear membrane is still intact. Boveri 
 showed this to be the case in Ascaris, and a similar fact has been 
 observed by many observers since, both in plants and in animals.

The splitting of the chromosomes is therefore, in Boveri's words, 
 '■^ an independent vital manifestation, an act of 7'eprodnction on the part 
 of the chromosomes y^ 

All of the recent researches in this field point to the conclusion 
 that this act of division must be referred to the fission of the 
 chromatin-granules or chromomeres of which the chromatin-thread 
 is built. These granules were first clearly described by Balbiani 
 i^'J^^ in the chromatin-network of epithelial cells in the insect- 
 ovary, and he found that the spireme-thread arose by the linear 
 arrangement of these granules in a single row like a chain of bacte- 
 ria.^ Six years later Pfitzner ('82) added the interesting discovery
