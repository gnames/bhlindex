that during the mitosis of various tissue-cells of the salamander, the 
 granules of the spireme-thread divide by fission and thus determine the 
 longitudinal splitting of tJie etitij'e chromosome. This discovery was 
 confirmed by Flemming in the following year ('82, p. 219), and a simi- 
 lar result has been reached by many other observers (Fig. 54). The 
 division of the chromatin-granules may take place at a very early 
 period. Flemming observed as long ago as 1881 that the chromatin-

thread might split in the spireme-stage (epithelial cells of the sala- 
 mander), and this has since been shown to occur in many other cases ; 
 for instance, by Guignard in the mother-cells of the pollen in the 
 lily ('91). Brauer's recent work on the spermatogenesis of Ascaris 
 shows that the fission of the chromatin-granules here takes place even 
 before the spireme-stage, when the chromatin is still in the form of a 
 reticulum, and long before the division of the centrosome (Fig. 55). 
 He therefore concludes : " With Boveri I regard the splitting as an
