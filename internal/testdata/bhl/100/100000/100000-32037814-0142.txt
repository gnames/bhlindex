1 14 CELL-DIVISION 

independent reproductive act of tlie chromatin. The reconstruction 
 of the nucleus, and in particular the breaking up of the chromosomes 
 after division into small granules and their uniform distribution 
 through the nuclear cavity, is, in the first place, for the purpose of 
 allowing a uniform growth to take place ; and in the second place, 
 after the granules have grown to their normal size, to admit of their 
 precisely equal quantitative aizd qualitative division. I hold that all 
 the succeeding phenomena, such as the grouping of the granules 
 in threads, their union to form larger granules, the division of the 
 thread into segments and finally into chromosomes, are of secondary 
 importance ; all these are only for the purpose of bringing about in 
 the simplest and most certain manner the transmission of the daugh- 
 ter-granules (Spalthalften) to the daughter-cells." ^ " In my opinion 
 the chromosomes are not independent individuals, but only groups of 
 numberless minute chromatin-granules, which alone have the value 
 of individuals." ^ 

These observations certainly lend strong support to "the view that 
 the chromatin is to be regarded as a morphological aggregate â€” as 
 a congeries or colony of self-propagating elementary organisms 
 capable of assimilation, growth, and division. They prove, more- 
 over, that mitosis involves two distinct though closely related factors, 
 one of which is the fission of the chromatic nuclear substance, while 
 the other is the distribution of that substance to the daughter-cells. 
 In the first of these it is the chromatin that takes the active part ; 
 in the second it would seem that the main role is played by the 
 amphiaster. 

E. Direct or Amitotic Division 

I. General Sketch 

We turn now to the rarer and simpler mode of division known 
 as amitosis ; but as Flemming has well said, it is a somewhat trying 
 task to give an account of a subject of which the final outcome is 
 so unsatisfactory as this ; for in spite of extensive investigation, we 
 still have no very definite conclusion in regard either to the mechan- 
 ism of amitosis or its biological meaning. Amitosis, or direct division, 
 differs in two essential respects from mitosis. First, the nucleus 
 remains in the resting state (reticulum), and there is no formation 
 of a spireme or of chromosomes. Second, division occurs without 
 the formation of an amphiaster ; hence the centrosome is not con- 
 cerned with the nuclear division, which takes place by a simple 
 constriction. The nuclear substance, accordingly, undergoes a divi-
