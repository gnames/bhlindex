 granules (Fig. 56). 

Before the discovery of mitosis, nuclear division was generally- 
 assumed to take place in accordance with Remak's scheme (p. 63). 
 The rapid extension of our knowledge of mitotic division between 
 the years 1875 and 1885 showed, however, that such a mode of 
 division was, to say the least, of rare occurrence, and led to doubts 
 as to whether it ever actually took place as a normal process. As 
 soon, however, as attention was especially directed to the subject, 
 many cases of amitotic division were accurately determined, though

very few of them conformed precisely to Remak's scheme. One 
 such case is that described by Carnoy in the follicle-cells of the 
 Qgg in the mole-cricket, where division begins in the fission of the 
 nucleolus, followed by that of the nucleus. Similar cases have 
 been since described, by Hoyer('90)in the intestinal epithelium of 
 the nematode Rhabdonema, by Korschelt in the intestine of the 
 annelid Ophryotrocha, and in a few other cases. In many cases, how- 
 ever, no preliminary fission of the nucleolus occurs ; and Remak's 
 scheme must, therefore, be regarded as one of the rarest forms of 
 cell-division (!).

The behaviour of the centrosome in aniitosis forms an interesting question 
 on account of its bearing on the mechanics of cell-division. Flemming obser\'ed
