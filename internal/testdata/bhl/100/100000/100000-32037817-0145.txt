multiplication. It is frequent in pathological growths and in cells 
 such as those of the vertebrate decidua, of the embryonic envelopes 
 of insects, or the yolk-nuclei (periblast, etc.), which are 07i the way 
 toward degeneration. In many cases, moreover, direct nuclear divi- 
 sion is not followed by fission of the cell-body, so that multinuclear 
 cells and polymorphic nuclei are thus often formed. These and 
 many similar facts led Flemming in 1891 to express the opinion that 
 so far as the higher plants and animals are concerned amitosis is " a 
 process which does not lead to a new production and multiplication 
 of cells, but wherever it occurs represents either a degeneration or an 
 aberration, or perhaps in many cases (as in the formation of multi- 
 nucleated cells by fragmentation) is tributary to metabolism through 
 the increase of nuclear surface."^ In this direction Flemming 
 sought an explanation of the fact that leucocytes may divide either 
 mitotically or amitotically (/. Peremeschko, Lowit, Arnold, Flemming). 
 In the normal lymph-glands, where new leucocytes are continually 
 regenerated, mitosis is the prevalent mode. Elsewhere (w^andering- 
 cells) both processes occur. " Like the cells of other tissues the 
 leucocytes find their normal physiological origin (Neubildung) in 
 mitosis ; only those so produced have the power to live on and repro- 
 duce their kind through the same process." ^ Those that divide ami- 
 totically are on the road to ruin. Amitosis in the higher forms is 
 thus conceived as a purely secondary process, not a survival of a 
 primitive process of direct division from the Protozoa, as Strasburger 
 ('82) and Waldeyer ('88) had conceived it. 

This hypothesis has been carried still further by Ziegler and Vom 
 Rath ('91). In a paper on the origin of the blood in fishes, Ziegler 
 ('87) showed that the periblast-nuclei in the 0.2,^ of fishes divide ami- 
 totically, and he was thus led like Flemming to the view that amitosis 
 is connected with a high specialization of the cell and may be a fore- 
 runner of degeneration. In a second paper ('91), published shortly 
 after Flemming's, he points out the fact that amitotically dividing 
 nuclei are usually of large size and that the cells are in many cases 
 distinguished by a specially intense secretory or assimilative activity. 
 Thus, Riige ('90) showed that the absorption of degenerate eggs in 
 the Amphibia is effected by means of leucocytes which creep into the 
 egg-substance. The nuclei of these cells become enlarged, divide ami- 
 totically, and then frequently degenerate. Other observers ( Korschelt, 
 Carnoy) have noted the large size and amitotic division of the nuclei 
 in the ovarian follicle-cells and nutritive cells surrounding the ovum in 
 insects and Crustacea. Chun found in the entodermic cells of the 
 radial canals of siphonophores huge cells filled with nests of nuclei 
 amitotically produced, and suggested ('90) that the multiplication of
