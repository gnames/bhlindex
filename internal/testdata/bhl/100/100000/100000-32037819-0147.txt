SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION II9 

There is, however, strong evidence that this conclusion is too 
 extreme. Meves ('94) has given good reason for the conclusion that 
 in the salamander the nuclei of the sperm-producing cells (spermato- 
 gonia) may divide by amitosis yet afterward undergo normal mitotic 
 division, and Preusse ('95) has reached a similar result in the case of 
 insect-ovaries. Perhaps the most, convincing evidence in this direc- 
 tion is afforded by Pfeffer's ('99) recent experiments on Spiivgyra. 
 If this plant be placed in water containing 0.5 to 1.0% of ether, active 
 growth and division continue, but only by amitosis. If, however, the 
 same individuals be replaced in water, mitotic division is resumed and 
 entirely normal growth continues. This seems to show conclusively 
 that amitosis, in lower forms of life at least, does not necessarily mean 
 the approach of degeneration, but is a result of special conditions. 
 Nevertheless, there can be no doubt that Flemming's hypothesis in a 
 general way represents the truth, and that in the vast majority of cases 
 amitosis is a secondary process which does not fall in the generative 
 series of cell-divisions. 

F. Summary and Conclusion 

All cells arise by division from preexisting cells, cell-body from 
 cell-body, nucleus from nucleus, plastids (when these bodies are pres- 
 ent) from plastids, and in some cases centrosomes from centrosomes. 
 The law of genetic continuity thus applies not merely to the cell con- 
 sidered as a whole, but also to some of its structural constituents. 

In mitosis, the usual and typical mode of division, the nucleus under- 
 goes a complicated transformation, and, together with some of the 
 cytoplasmic material, gives rise to the mitotic figure. Of this, the 
 most characteristic features are the chromatic figure^ consisting of 
 chromosomes derived from the chromatin, and the acJiroinatic figure, 
 derived from the cytoplasm, the nucleus, or from both, and consisting 
 of a spindle, at each pole of which, as a rule, is a centrosome and 
 aster. There is, however, strong evidence that both these latter struc- 
 tures may in some cases be wanting, and the spindle is therefore prob- 
 ably to be regarded as the most essential element. 

The chromosomes, always of the same number in a given species 
 (with only apparent exceptions), arise by the transformation of the 
 chromatin-reticulum into a thread which breaks into segments and 
 splits lengthwise throughout its whole extent. The two halves are 
 thereupon transported in opposite directions along the spindle to 
 its respective poles and there enter into the formation of the two 
 corresponding daughter-nuclei. The spireme-thread, and hence the 
 chromosome, arises from a single series of chromatin-granules or 
 chromomeres which, by their fission, cause the splitting of the thread.
