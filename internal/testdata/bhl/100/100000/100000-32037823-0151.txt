physiological division of labour; and while it is no doubt the most 
 fundamental and important differentiation in the multicellular body, 
 it is nevertheless to be regarded as differing only in degree, not in 
 kind, from the distinctions between the various kinds of somatic cells. 
 In the lowest multicellular forms, such as Volvox (Fig. 57), the 
 differentiation appears in a very clear form. Here the body consists 
 of a hollow sphere, the walls of which consist of two kinds of cells. 
 The very numerous smaller cells are devoted to the functions of nutri-

tion and locomotion, and sooner or later die. A number, usually eight, 
 of larger cells are set aside as germ-cells, each of which by progressive 
 fission may form a new individual like the parent. In this case the 
 germ-cells are simply scattered about among the somatic cells, and no 
 special sexual organs exist. In all the higher types the germ-cells 
 are more or less definitely aggregated in groups, supported and nour- 
 ished by somatic cells specially set apart for that purpose and forming 
 distinct sexual organs, the ovaries and spcrniarics or their equivalents. 
 Within these organs the germ-cells are carried, protected, and nour- 
 ished ; and here they undergo various differentiations to prepare 
 them for their future functions. 

In the earlier stages of embryological development the progenitors 
 of the germ-cells are exactly alike in the two sexes and are indistin-
