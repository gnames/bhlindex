guishable from the surrounding somatic cells. As development pro- 
 ceeds, they are first differentiated from the somatic cells and then 
 diverge very widely in the two sexes, undergoing remarkable trans- 
 formations of structure to fit them for their specific functions. The 
 structural difference thus brought about between the germ-cells is, 
 however, only the result of physiological division of labour. The 
 female germ-cell, or ovum, supplies most of the material for the 
 body of the embryo and stores the food by which it is nourished. It 
 is therefore very large, contains a great amount of cytoplasm more or 
 less laden with food-matter (jj/.?/^ or dentoplasni), and in many cases 
 becomes surrounded by membranes or other envelopes for the pro- 
 tection of the developing embryo. On the whole, therefore, the early 
 life of the ovum is devoted to the accumulation of cytoplasm and the 
 storage of potential energy, and its nutritive processes are largely 
 constructive or anabolic. On the other hand, the male germ-cell or 
 spermatozoon contributes to the mass of the embryo only a very 
 small amount of substance, comprising as a rule only a single nucleus 
 and a very small quantity of cytoplasm. It is thus relieved from the 
 drudgery of making and storing food and providing protection for 
 the embryo, and is provided with only sufficient cytoplasm to form a 
 locomotor apparatus, usually in the form of one or more cilia, by 
 which it seeks the ovum. It is therefore very small, performs active 
 movements, and its metabolism is characterized by the predominance 
 of the destructive or katabolic processes by which the energy neces- 
 sary for these movements is set free.^ When finally matured, there- 
 fore, the ovum and spermatozoon have no external resemblance ; and 
 while Schwann recognized, though somewhat doubtfully, the fact 
 that the ovum is a cell, it was not until many years afterward that 
 the spermatozoon was proved to be of the same nature. 

A. The Ovum 

The animal t.gg (Figs. 58-59) is a huge spheroidal cell, sometimes 
 naked, but more commonly surrounded by one or more membranes 
 which may be perforated by a minute opening, the micropyle, through 
 which the spermatozoon enters (Fig. 63). It contains an enormous 
 nucleus known as the germinal vesicle, within which is a very con- 
 spicuous nucleolus known to the earlier observers as the germinal 
 spot. In many eggs the latter is single, but in other forms many 

1 The metabolic contrast between the germ-cells has been fully discussed in a most sug- 
 gestive manner by Geddes and Thompson in their work on the Evolution of Sex ; and these 
 authors regard this contrast as but a particular manifestation of a metabolic contrast charac- 
 teristic of the sexes in general.
