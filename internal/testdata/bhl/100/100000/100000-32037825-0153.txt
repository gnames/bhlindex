THE OVUM 125 

nucleoli are present, and they are sometimes of more than one kind, 
 as in tissue-cells.^ In many forms no centrosome or attraction-sphere 
 is found in the ^gg until the initial stages in the formation of the 
 polar bodies, though Mertens ('93) describes a centrosome and attrac- 
 tion-sphere in the young ovarian eggs of a number of vertebrates 
 (Fig. 79), while Platner ('89) and Stauffacher ('93) find what they 
 believe to be centrosomes in much later stages of Atilostonrnfu and 
 Cyclas, lying outside the nuclear membrane. Beside these cases 
 should be placed those described by Balbiani, Munson, Nemec, and 
 others in which a body closely resembling an attraction-sphere is 
 identified as a "yolk-nucleus" or "vitelline body," as described at 
 page 158. In none of these cases is the identification of this 
 body wholly satisfactory, nor is it known to have any connection with 
 the polar mitoses. Most observers find no centrosome until the 
 prophases of the first polar mitosis. Its origin is still problematical, 
 some observers believing it to arise de novo in the cytoplasm (Mead), 
 others concluding that it is of nuclear origin (Mathews, Van der 
 Stricht, Riickert), still others that it persists in the cytoplasm hidden 
 among the granules. In any case it is again lost to view after forma- 
 tion of the polar bodies, to be replaced by the cleavage-centrosomes 
 which arise in connection with the spermatozoon (p. 187). 

The egg-cytoplasm almost always contains a certain amount of 
 nutritive matter, the yolk or deiitoplasni, in the form of liquid drops, 
 solid spheres or other bodies suspended in the meshwork and varying 
 greatly in different cases in respect to amount, distribution, form, and 
 chemical composition. 

I. TJie Nucleus 

The nucleus or germinal vesicle occupies at first a central or nearly 
 central position, though it shows in some cases a distinct eccentricity 
 even in its earliest stages. As the growth of the Q.gg proceeds, the 
 eccentricity often becomes more marked, and the nucleus may thus 
 come to lie very near the periphery. In some cases, however, the 
 peripheral movement of the germinal vesicle occurs only a very short 
 time before the final stages of maturation, which may coincide with 
 the time of fertilization. Its form is typically that of a spherical sac, 
 surrounded by a very distinct membrane (Fig. 58); but during the 
 growth of the &gg it may become irregular or even amoeboid (Fig. jjX 
 and, as Korschelt has shown in the case of insect-eggs, may move 
 through the cytoplasm toward the source of food. Its structure is 

1 Placker ('95, p. 249) has called attention to the fact that the nucleolus is as a rule 
 single in small eggs containing relatively little deutoplasm (cojlenterates, echinoderms, 
 many annelids, and some copepods), while it is multiple in large eggs heavily laden with 
 deutoplasm (lower vertebrates, insects, many Crustacea).
