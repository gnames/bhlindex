126 THE GERM-CELLS 

on the whole that of a typical cell-nucleus, but is subject to very great 
 variation, not only in different animals, but also in different stages of 
 ovarian growth. Sometimes, as in the echinoderm ovum, the chro- 
 matin forms a beautiful and regular reticulum consisting of numer- 
 ous chromatin-granules suspended in a network of linin (Fig. 58). 
 In other cases, no true reticular stage exists, the nucleus containing 
 throughout the whole period of its growth the separate daughter-chro- 
 mosomes of the preceding division (copepods, selachians, Aniphibia),i

 It is a very interesting and important fact that during the growth 
 and maturation of the ovum a large part of the chromatin of the 
 germinal vesicle may be lost, either by passing out bodily into the 
 cytoplasm, by conversion into supernumerary or accessory nucleoli 
 which finally degenerate, or by being cast out and degenerating at 
 the time the polar bodies are formed (Figs. 97, 128). 

The nucleolus of the egg-cell is, as elsewhere, a variable quantity 
 and is still imperfectly understood. It often attains an enormous 
 development, forming the " Keimfleck " or " germinal spot " of the
