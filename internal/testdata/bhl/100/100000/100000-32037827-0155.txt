early observers. There are some cases {e.g. echinoderm eggs) in 
 which it is always a single large spherical body (Fig. 58), and this 
 condition appears to be characteristic of the very young ovarian eggs 
 of most animals. As a rule, however, the number of nucleoli in- 
 creases with the growth of the ovum, until, in such forms as Amphibia 
 and reptiles, they may be numbered by hundreds. 

In a large number of cases the nucleoli are of two quite distinct 
 types, which Flemming has distinguished as the " principal nucleolus "

 preparation by Dahlgren. [Enlarged 235 diameters.] The ovum lies in the Graafian follicle 
 within the discus proligerus, the latter forming the immediate follicular investment {corona 
 radiafa) of the egg. Within the corona is the clear zona pellucida or egg-membrane. {Cf.

 differ widely in staining-reaction ; but it does not yet clearly appear 
 whether they definitely correspond to the plasmosomes and karyo- 
 somes of tissue-cells (p. 34). The principal nucleolus, which alone 
 is present in such eggs as those of echinoderms, often stains deeply 
 with chromatin-stains, yet differs more or less widely from the 
 chromatin-network,^ and in some cases at least it does not contribute
