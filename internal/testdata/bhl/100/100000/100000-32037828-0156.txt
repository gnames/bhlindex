to the formation of chromosomes. It cannot therefore be directly com- 
 pared to the net-knots or karyosomes of tissue-cells. This nucleolus is 
 often vacuolated and sometimes assumes the form of a hollow vesicle. 
 It is rarely double or multiple. The accessory nucleoli, on the other 
 hand, are in general coloured by plasma-stains, thus resembling the 
 plasmosomes of tissue-cells ; they are often multiple, and as a rule 
 they arise secondarily during the growth of the ^^^ (Fig- 6i). The 
 accessory nucleoli often have no connection with the principal ; but 
 in some mollusks and annelids an accessory and a principal nucleolus 
 are closely united to form a single compound body (Figs. 60, 61). 
 The numerous nucleoli of the amphibian or reptilian o.^^ appear to be 
 of the "accessory" type. The singular inconstancy of the nucleolus 
 is evidenced by the fact that even closely related species may differ 
 in this regard. Thus, in Cyclops bt'evicornis, according to Hacker, the 
 very young ovum contains a single intensely chromatic nucleolus ; at 
 a later period a number of paler accessory nucleoli appear ; and still 
 later the principal nucleolus disappears, leaving only the accessory 
 ones. In C. stremms, on the other hand, there is throughout but a 
 single nucleolus. 

The physiological meaning of the nucleoli is still involved in doubt. 
 Many cases are, however, certainly known in which the nucleolus 
 plays no part in the later development of the nucleus, being cast out 
 or degenerating m situ at the time the polar bodies are formed. It 
 is, for example, cast out bodily in the medusa Aiqiiorea (Hacker) and 
 in various annelids and echinoderms, afterward lying for some time 
 as a " metanucleus " in the egg-cytoplasm before degenerating. In 
 these cases the chromosomes are formed in the germinal vesicle inde- 
 pendently of the nucleoli (Fig. 125), which degenerate in situ when 
 the membrane of the germinal vesicle disappears. In such cases it 
 seems quite certain that the nucleoli do not contribute to the forma- 
 tion of the chromosomes, and that their substance represents passive 
 material which is of no further direct use. Hence we can hardly 
 doubt the conclusion of Hacker, that the nucleoli of the germ-cells 
 are, in some cases at least, accumulations of by-products of the nuclear 
 action, derived from the chromatin either by direct transformation of 
 its substance, or as chemical cleavage-products or secretions. It will 
 be shown in Chapter V. that in some cases a large part of the 
 chromatic reticulum is cast out, and degenerates at the time the polar 
 bodies are formed. The immense growth of the chromatin during 
 the ovarian development is probably correlated in some way with the 
 intense constructive activity of the cytoplasm (p. 339); and when this 
 latter process has ceased a large part of the chromatin-substance, 
 having fulfilled its functions, is cast aside. It seems not improbable 
 that the nucleoli are tributary to the same general process, perhaps
