Fig. 60. â€” Eggs of the annelid A'tvt'w, before and after fertilization, X 400 (for intermediate 
 stages see Fig. 95). 

A. Before fertilization. The large germinal vesicle occupies a nearly central position. It con- 
 tains a network of chromatin in which are seen five small darker bodies; these are the quadruple 
 chromosome-groups, or tetrads, in process of formation (not all of them are shown) ; these alone 
 persist in later stages, the principal mass of the network being lost; g.s. double germinal spot, 
 consisting of a chromatic and an achromatic sphere. This egg is heavily laden with yolk, in the 
 form of clear deiitoplasm-spheres {d^ and fat-drops (/"), uniformly distributed through the cyto- 
 plasm. The peripheral layer of cytoplasm (peri-vitelline layer) is free from deutoplasm. Outside 
 this the membrane. B. The egg some time after fertilization and about to divide. The deuto- 
 plasm is now concentrated in the lower hemisphere, and the peri-vitelline layer has disappeared. 
 Above are the two polar bodies (/.*.). Below them lies the mitotic figure, the chromosomes 
 dividing.
