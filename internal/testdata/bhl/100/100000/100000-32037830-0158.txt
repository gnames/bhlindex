serving as storehouses of material formed incidentally to the general 
 nuclear activity, but not of further direct use. 

Carnoy and Le Brun ('97, '99) reach, however, the conclusion that 
 in the germinal vesicle of Amphibia the chromosomes are derived 
 not from the chromatin-network, but solely from the nucleoli. The 
 apparent contradiction of this result with that of other observers is,

A. Youngest stage with single (principal) nucleolus. B. Older egg, showing accessory nucle- 
 olus attached to the principal. C. The two nucleoli separated. D. Much older stage, showing 
 the two nucleoli united. E. Germinal vesicle of Epeira, showing one accessory nucleolus at- 
 tached to the principal, and one free. F. Later stage ; several accessory nucleoli attached to the 
 principal. 

perhaps, only a verbal one; for the "nucleoli" are here evidently 
 chromatin-masses, and the disappearance of the chromatic network is 
 comparable with what occurs at a later period in the annelid egg 
 (Figs. 97, 128).

The egg-cytoplasm varies greatly in appearance with the varia- 
 tions of the deutoplasm. In such eggs as those of the echinoderm
