THE OVUM 131 

(Fig. 58), which have little or no deutoplasm, the cytoplasm forms a 
 regular meshwork, which is in this case an undoubted alveolar struc- 
 ture, the structure of which has already been described at p. 28. In 
 eggs containing yolk the deutoplasm-spheres or granules are laid 
 down in the spaces of the meshwork and appear to correspond to the 
 alveolar spheres of the echinoderm o.^^ (p. 50). If they are of large 
 size the cytoplasm assumes a "pseudo-alveolar" structure (Fig. 60), 
 much as in plant-cells laden with reserve starch; but reasons have 
 already been given (p. 50) for regarding this as only a modification 
 of the "primary" alveolar structure of Biitschli. There is good 
 reason to believe, however, that the egg-cytoplasm may in some cases 
 form a true reticular structure with the yolk-granules lying in its 
 interstices, as many observers have described. In many cases a pe- 
 ripheral layer of the ovum, known as the cortical or peri- vitelline layer, 
 is free from deutoplasm-spheres, though it is continuous with the 
 protoplasmic meshwork in which the latter lie (Fig. 60). Upon 
 fertilization, or sometimes before, this layer may disappear by a 
 peripheral movement of the yolk, as appears to be the case in 
 Nereis. In other cases the peri-vitelline substance rapidly flows 
 toward the point at which the spermatozoon enters, where a proto- 
 plasmic germinal disc is then formed; for example, in many fish-eggs. 
 â€¢ The character of the yolk varies so widely that it can here be con- 
 sidered only in very general terms. The deutoplasm-bodies are com- 
 monly spherical, but often show a more or less distinctly rhomboidal 
 or crystalloid form as in Amphibia and some fishes, and in such cases 
 they may sometimes be spHt up into parallel lamellae known as yolk- 
 plates. Their chemical composition varies widely, judging by the 
 staining-reactions ; but we have very little definite knowledge on this 
 subject, and have to rely mainly on the results of analysis of the total 
 yolk, which in the hen's o.^^ is thus shown to consist largely of pro- 
 teids, nucleo-albumins, and a variety of related substances which are 
 often associated with fatty substances and small quantities of car- 
 bohydrates (glucose, etc.). In some cases the deutoplasm-spheres 
 stain intensely with nuclear dyes, such as hasmatoxylin; e.g. in many 
 worms and mollusks; in other cases they show a greater affinity for 
 plasma-stains, as in many fishes and Amphibia and annelids (Fig. 60). 
 Often associated with the proper deutoplasm-spheres are drops of oil, 
 either scattered through the yolk (Fig. 60) or united to form a single 
 large drop, as in many pelagic fish-eggs. 

The deutoplasm is as a rule heavier than the protoplasm ; and in 
 such cases, if the yolk is accumulated in one hemisphere, the o^gg 
 assumes a constant position with respect to gravity, the egg-axis 
 standing vertically with the animal pole turned upward, as in the 
 frog, the bird, and many other cases. There are, however, many
