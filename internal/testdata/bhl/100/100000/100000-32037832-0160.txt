THE GERM-CELLS 

cases in which the Q,gg may lie in any position. When fat-drops are 
 present they usually lie in the vegetative hemisphere, and since they 
 ^^ are hghter than the other constituents 

they usually cause the Q,^g to lie with 
 the animal pole turned downwards, as 
 is the case with some annelids (^Nereis) 
 and many pelagic fish-eggs.

 m. micropyle; p.b. the polar bodies. 
 The flat side of the egg is the dorsal, 
 the convex side the ventral, and the 
 micropyle is at the anterior end. 
 The deutoplasm (small circles) lies 
 in the centre surrounded by a periph- 
 eral or peri-vitelline layer of proto- 
 plasm. The outer heavy line is the 
 chorion, the inner lighter line the 
 vitelline membrane, both being per- 
 forated by the micropyle, from which 
 exudes a mass of jelly-like substance. 

3. T/ie Egg-envelopes 

The egg-envelopes fall under three 
 categories. These are : — ■ 

{a) The vitelline membrane, secreted 

by the ovum itself. 
 i^b) The choi'ion, formed outside the 
 ovum by the activity of the 
 maternal follicle-cells. 
 (c) Accessory envelopes, secreted by 
 the walls of the oviduct or other 
 maternal structures after the 
 ovum has left the ovary. 
 Only the first of these properly be- 
 longs to the ovum, the second and third 
 being purely maternal products. There 
 are some eggs, such as those of certain 
 coelenterates {j^-g- Renilla), that are 
 naked throughout their whole develop- 
 ment. In many others, of which the 
 sea-urchin is a type, the fresh-laid Q.g^ is 
 naked but forms a vitelline membrane 
 almost instantaneously after the sperma- 
 tozoon touches it.^ In other forms (in- 
 sects, birds) the vitelline membrane may 
 be present before fertilization, and in 
 such cases the Q,gg is often surrounded 
 by a chorion as well. The latter is 
 usually very thick and firm and may 
 have a shell-like consistency, its surface 
 sometimes showing various peculiar 
 markings, prominences, or sculptured 
 patterns characteristic of the species 
 (insects).^ 

1 That the vitelline membrane does not preexist seems to be established by the fact that 
 egg-fragments likewise surround themselves v/ith a membrane when fertilized. [Hertwig.] 

2 In some cases, according to Wheeler, the insect-egg has only a chorion, the vitelline 
 membrane being absent.
