THE OVUM 133 

The accessory envelopes are too varied to be more than touched 
 upon here. They include not only the products of the oviduct or 
 uterus, such as the albumin, shell-membrane, and shell of birds and 
 reptiles, the gelatinous mass investing amphibian ova, the capsules 
 of molluscan ova and the like, but also nutritive fluids and capsules 
 secreted by the external surface of the body, as in leeches and earth- 
 worms. 

When the q.^% is surrounded by a membrane before fertilization it 
 is often perforated by one or more openings known as micropyles, 
 through which the. spermatozoa make their entrance (Figs. 62, 63). 
 Where there is but one micropyle, ^ 

it is usually situated very near the 
 upper or anterior pole (fishes, 
 many insects), but it may be at the 
 opposite pole (some insects and 
 mollusks), or even on the side 
 (insects). In many insects there 
 is a group of half a dozen or more p.^ 63._ upper pole of the egg of Argo-

The plant-ovum, which is usually known as the oospJiere (Figs. 64, 
 107), shows the same general features as that of animals, being a 
 relatively large, quiescent, rounded cell containing a large nucleus. 
 It never, however, attains the dimensions or the complexity of struc- 
 ture shown in many animal eggs, since it always remains attached to 
 the maternal structures, by which it is provided with food and invested 
 with protective envelopes. It is therefore naked, as a rule, and is 
 not heavily laden with reserve food-matters such as the deutoplasm 
 of animal ova. A vitelline membrane is, however, often formed soon 
 after fertilization, as in echinoderms. The most interesting feature 
 of the plant-ovum is the fact that it often contains plastids (leuco- 
 plasts or chromatophores) which, by their division, give rise to those 
 of the embryonic cells. These sometimes have the form of typical 
 chromatophores containing pyrenoids, as in Volvox and many other 
 Algae (Fig. 64). In the higher forms (archegoniate plants), according 
 to the researches of Schmitz and Schimper, the q%% contains numer- 
 ous minute colourless " leucoplasts," which afterward develop into 
 green chromatophores or into the starch-building amyloplasts. This 
 is a point of great theoretical interest ; for the researches of Schmitz, 
 Schimper, and others have rendered it highly probable that these
