THE GERM- CELLS 

plastids are persistent morphological bodies that arise only by the 
 division of preexisting bodies of the same kind, and hence may be 
 traced continuously from one generation to another through the

germ-cells. In the lower plants (Algse) they may occur in both germ- 
 cells ; in the higher forms they are found in the female alone, and in 
 such cases the plastids of the embryonic body are of purely maternal 
 origin. 

B. The Spermatozoon 

Although spermatozoa were among the first of animal cells ob- 
 served by the microscope, their real nature was not determined for 
 more than two hundred years after their discovery. Our modern 
 knowledge of the subject may be dated from the year 1841, when 
 Kolliker proved that they were not parasitic animalcules, as the early 
 observers supposed, but the products of cells preexisting in the 
 parent body. Kolliker, however, did not identify them as cells, but 
 iDelieved them to be of purely nuclear origin. We owe to Schweigger- 
 Seidel and La Valette St. George the proof, simultaneously brought 
 forward by these authors in 1865,^ that the spermatozoon is a com- 
 plete cell, consisting of nucleus and cytoplasm, and hence of the same 
 morphological nature as the ovum. It is of extraordinary minute- 
 ness, being in many cases less than yoto o" ^^^ bulk of the ovum.^

 the volume of the ovum. The inequality is in many cases very much greater.
