Its precise study is therefore difficult, and it is not surprising that our 
 knowledge of its structure and origin is still far from complete.

In its more usual form the animal spermatozoon resembles a 
 minute, elongated tadpole, which swims very actively about by the 
 vibrations of a long, slender tail morpho- 
 logically comparable with a single cilium 
 or flagellum. Such a spermatozoon con- 
 sists typically of four parts, as shown in 
 Fig. 65: — 

1. The miclens, which forms the main 
 portion of the "head," and consists of a 
 very dense and usually homogeneous mass 
 of chromatin staining with great intensity 
 with the so-called "nuclear dyes" {e.g. 
 haematoxylin or the basic tar-colours such 
 as methyl-green). It is surrounded by a 
 very thin cytoplasmic envelope. 

2. An apical body, or acrosome, lying at 
 the front end of the head, sometimes very 
 minute, sometimes almost as large as the 
 nucleus, and in some cases terminating in 
 a sharp spur by means of which the 
 spermatozoon bores its way into the ovum. 

3. The middle-piece, or connecting 
 piece, a larger cytoplasmic body lying 
 behind the head and giving attachment to 
 the tail, from which it is not always dis- 
 tinctly marked off. This body shows the 
 same staining-reactions as the acrosome, 
 having an especial affinity for " plasma- 
 stains " (acid fuchsin, etc.). At its front 
 end it is in some forms (mammals) sepa- 
 rated from the nucleus by a short clear 
 region, the neck. Like the acrosome, the 
 middle-piece is in some cases derived from an " archoplasmic " mass, 
 representing an attraction-sphere {Lunibriciis) or a portion of the 
 Ncbcnkcrn (insects), and it contains, or according to some authors 
 actually arises from, the centrosome (salamander, mammals, insects, 
 etc.). 

4. The tail, or flagellum, in part, at least, a cytoplasmic product 
 developed in connection with the centrosome and " archoplasm "
