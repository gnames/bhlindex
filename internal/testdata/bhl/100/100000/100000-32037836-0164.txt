(attraction-sphere or " Nebenkern") of the mother-cell. It consists 
 of a fibrillated axial filament surrounded by a cytoplasmic envelope, 
 and in certain cases (Amphibia) bears on one side a fin-like undulat- 
 ing membrane (Fig. 66^. Toward the tip of the flagellum the enve- 
 lope suddenly disappears or becomes very thin, leaving a short 
 end-piece which by some authors is considered to consist of the naked 
 axial filament. The axial filament may be traced through the 
 middle-piece up to the head, at the base of which it usually termi-

nates in a minute body, single or double, known as the end-knob. 
 Recent research has proved that the axial filament grows out from 
 the spermatid-centrosome, the latter in some cases persisting as the 
 end-knob (insects, mollusks, mammals), in other cases apparently 
 enlarging to form the main body of the middle-piece (salamander). 
 The tail-envelopes, on the other hand, arise either from the " archo- 
 plasm " of the Nebenkern (insects) together with a small amount 
 of unmodified cytoplasm, or from the latter alone (salamander, rat).
