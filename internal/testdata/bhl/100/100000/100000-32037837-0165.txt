THE SPERMATOZOON 1 37 

From a physiological point of view we may arrange the parts of 
 the spermatozoon under two categories as follows : — 

I. The essential structtires which play a direct part in fertilization. 

These are : — 
 {a) The rmcleus, which contains the chromatin. 
 (J)) The middle-piece, which either contains a formed centrosome 
 or pair of centrosomes (end-knob), or is itself a meta- 
 morphosed centrosome. This is probably to be regarded 
 as the fertilizing element par excellence, since there is reason 
 to believe that when introduced into the q.%% it gives the 
 stimulus to division. 
 2. The accessory structures, which play no direct part in fertilization, 
 viz. : — 
 {a) The apex or spur, by which the spermatozoon attaches itself 
 to the egg or bores its way into it, and which also serves 
 for the attachment of the spermatozoon to the nurse-cells 
 or supporting cells of the testis. 
 {p) The tail, a locomotor organ which carries the nucleus and 
 centrosome, and, as it were, deposits them in the ^g^ at 
 the time of fertilization. There can be little doubt that 
 the substance of the flagellum is contractile, and that its 
 movements are of the same nature as those of ordinary 
 cilia. Ballowitz's discovery of its fibrillated structure is 
 therefore of great interest, as indicating its structural as 
 well as physiological similarity to a muscle-fibre. The 
 outgrowth of the axial filament from the centrosome is 
 probably comparable to the formation of spindle-fibres or 
 astral rays, a conclusion of especial interest in its relation 
 to Van Beneden's theor}^ of mitosis (p. 100). 
 Tailed spermatozoa conforming more or less nearly to the type 
 just described are with few exceptions found throughout the Metazoa 
 from the coelenterates up to man ; but they show a most surprising 
 diversity in form and structure in different groups of animals, and 
 the homologies between the different forms have not yet been fully 
 determined. The simpler forms, for example, those of echinoderms 
 and some of the fishes (Figs. 66 and 100), conform very nearly to the 
 foregoing description. Every part of the spermatozoon may, how- 
 ever, vary more or less widely from it (Figs. 66-68). The head 
 (nucleus) may be spherical, lance-shaped, rod-shaped, spirally twisted, 
 hook-shaped, hood-shaped, or drawn out into a long filament ; and 
 it is often divided into an anterior and a posterior piece of different 
 staining-capacity, as is the case with many birds and mammals, 
 but it is probable that the anterior of these may represent the acro- 
 some. An interesting form of head is described by Wheeler ("97) in
