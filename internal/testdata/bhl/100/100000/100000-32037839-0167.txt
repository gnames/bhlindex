THE SPERMATOZOON

the spermatozoon of Myzostoma, where it is a greatly elongated 
 fusiform body, passing insensibly into the tail without distinct middle- 
 piece and containing a single series of chromatin-discs. The num- 
 ber of these in M. glabriim is 24, which is the somatic number 
 of chromosomes in this species. In M. chrifemvi the number of 
 chromatin-discs is more than 60. Somewhat similar spermatozoa 
 occur in the acoelous Turbellaria.^ The acrosome sometimes appears 
 to be wanting, e.g. in some fishes (Fig. 66). When present, it is 
 sometimes a minute rounded knob, sometimes a sharp stylet, and in 
 some cases terminates in a sharp barbed spur by which the sperma- 
 tozoon appears to penetrate the ovum {Triton). In the mammals it 
 is sometimes very small (rat), sometimes very large (guinea-pig), and 
 in some forms is surrounded by a cytoplasmic layer forming the 
 "head-cap " (Figs. 68, 86). It is sometimes divided into two distinct 
 parts, a longer posterior piece and a knob-Hke anterior piece (insects, 
 according to Ballowitz). 

The middle-piece or connecting-piece shows a like diversity (Figs. 
 66-68). In many cases it is sharply differentiated from the flagellum, 
 being sometimes nearly spherical, sometimes flattened like a cap 
 against the nucleus, and sometimes forming a short cylinder of the 
 same diameter as the nucleus, and hardly distinguishable from 
 the latter until after staining (newt, earthworm). In other cases it 
 is very long (reptiles, some mammals), and is scarcely distinguishable 
 from the flagellum. In still others (birds, some mammals) it passes 
 insensibly into the flagellum, and no sharply marked limit between 
 them can be seen. In many of the mammals the long connecting- 
 piece is separated from the head by a narrow "neck" in which the 
 end-knobs lie, as described below. 

Internally, the middle-piece consists of an axial filament and an 
 envelope, both of which are continuous with those of the flagellum. 
 In some cases the envelope shows a distinctly spiral structure, like 
 that of the tail-envelope ; but this is not always visible. The most 
 interesting part of the middle-piece is the "end-knob" in which the 
 axial filament terminates, at the base of the nucleus. In some cases 
 this appears to be single. More commonly it consists of two or more 
 minute bodies lying side by side (Fig. 6?>, B, D). 

The flagellum or tail is merely a locomotor organ which plays no 
 part in fertilization. It is, however, the most complex part of the 
 spermatozoon, and shows a very great diversity in structure. Its 
 most characteristic feature is the axial filament, which, as Ballowitz 
 has shown, is composed of a large number of parallel fibrillae, like a 
 muscle-fibre. This is surrounded by a cytoplasmic envelope, which 
 sometimes shows a striated or spiral structure, and in which, or in
