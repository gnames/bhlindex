connection with which, may be developed secondary or accessory fila- 
 ments and other structures. At the tip the axial filament may lose 
 its envelope and thus give rise to the so-called "end-piece" (Retzius). 
 In Triton, for example (Fig. 66, F), the envelope of the axial fila- 
 ment (" principal filament ") gives attachment to a remarkable fin-like 

membrane, having a frilled or 
 " - undulating free margin along 
 which is developed a " mar- 
 ginal filament." Toward the 
 tip of the tail the fin, and 
 finally the entire envelope, 
 disappears, leaving only the 
 axial filament to form the end- 
 piece. After maceration the 
 envelope shows a conspicuous 
 cross-striation, which perhaps 
 indicates a spiral structure 
 such as occurs in the mam- 
 mals. The marginal filament, 
 on the other hand, breaks 
 up into numerous parallel 
 fibrillae, while the axial fila- 
 ment remains unaltered (Bal- 
 lowitz). 

A fin-membrane has also 
 been observed in some insects 
 and fishes, and has been as- 
 serted to occur in mammals 
 (man included). Later ob- 
 servers have, however, failed 
 to find the fin in mammals, 
 and their observations indi- 
 cate that the axial filament is 
 merely surrounded by an 
 envelope which sometimes 
 shows traces of the same 
 spiral arrangement as that 
 which is so conspicuous in 
 the connecting-piece. In the 
 skate the tail has two fila- 
 ments, both composed of 
 parallel fibrillae, connected by 
 a membrane and spirally 
 twisted about each other; a
