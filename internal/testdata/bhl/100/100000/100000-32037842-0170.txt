THE GERM-CELLS 

No less remarkable is the conjugation of spermatozoa in pairs (Fig. 68, //), which 
 takes place in the vas deferens in the opossum (Selenka) and in some insects 
 (Ballowitz, Auerbach). Ballovvitz's researches ('95) on the double spermatozoa 
 of beetles {Dy/iscidcE) prove that the union is not primary, but is the result of an 
 actual conjugation of previously separate spermatozoa. Not merely two, but three 
 or more spermatozoa may thus unite to form a " spermatozeugma," which swims like 
 a single spermatozoon. Whether the spermatozoa of such a group separate before 
 fertilization is unknown ; but Ballowitz has found the groups, after copulation, in 
 the female receptaculum, and he believes that they may enter the egg in this form. 
 The physiological meaning of the process is unknown. 

2. Other Foj'ins of Spermatozoa 

The principal deviations from the flagellate type of spermatozoon 
 occur among the arthropods and nematodes (Fig. 69). In many of 
 these forms the spermatozoa have no flagellum, and in some cases they 
 are actively amoeboid ; for example, in the daphnid Polyplienms (Fig. 
 69, A, B, (7) as described by Leydig and Zacharias. More commonly 
 they are motionless like the ovum. In the chilognathous myriapods 
 the spermatozoon has sometimes the form of a bi-convex lens {Poly- 
 desmiLs), sometimes the form of a hat or helmet having a double brim 
 {fiihts). In the latter case the nucleus is a solid disc at the base of 
 the hat. In many decapod Crustacea the spermatozoon consists of a 

cylindrical or conical body from 
 one end of which radiate a num- 
 ber of stiff spine-like processes. 
 The nucleus lies near the base. 
 In none of these cases has the 
 centrosome been identified.

Paternal Germ-cells of 
 Plants 

In most of the flowering 
 plants the male germ-cells are 
 represented by two " generative 
 nuclei," lying at the tip of the 
 pollen tube (Fig. 106). On the 
 other hand, in the cycads (Figs. 
 ?)J, 108) and in a large number 
 of the lower plants (pterido- 
 phytes, Muscineae, and many 
 others), the male germ-cell is a 
 minute actively swimming cell, 
 known as the spermatosoid, which is closely analogous to the spei;- 
 matozoon. The spermatozoids are in general less highly differenti- 
 ated than spermatozoa, and often show a distinct resemblance to the
