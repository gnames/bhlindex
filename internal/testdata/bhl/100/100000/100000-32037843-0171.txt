THE SPERMATOZOON

asexual swarmers or zoospores so common in the lower plants (Figs. 
 70, 71). They differ in two respects from animal spermatozoa: first 
 in possessing not one but two or several flagella ; second, in the fact 
 that these are attached as a rule not to the end of the cell, but on 
 the side. In the lower forms plastids are present in the form of 
 chromatophores, one 
 of which may be dif- 
 ferentiated into a red 
 "eye-spot," as in 
 Volvox and Fiiciis 
 (Figs. 57, 71, A), and 
 they may even contain 
 contractile vacuoles 
 ( Volvox ) ; but both 
 these structures are 
 wanting in the higher 
 forms. These con- 
 sist only of a nucleus 
 with a very small 
 amount of cytoplasm, 
 and have typically a 
 spiral form. In CJiara, 
 where their structure 
 and development 
 have recently been 
 carefully studied by 
 Belajeff, the sperma- 
 tozoids have an elon- 
 gated spiral form with 
 two long flagella at- 
 tached near the 
 pointed end, which is 
 directed forward in 
 swimming (Fig. 70). 
 The main body of the 
 spermatozoid is oc- 
 cupied by a dense, 
 apparently homoge- 
 neous nucleus sur- 
 rounded by a very delicate layer of cytoplasm. Behind the nucleus lies 
 a granular mass of cytoplasm, forming one end of the cell, while in 
 front is a slender cytoplasmic tip to which the flagella are attached. 
 Nearly similar spermatozoids occur in the liverworts and mosses. In 
 the ferns and other pteridophytes a somewhat different type occurs
