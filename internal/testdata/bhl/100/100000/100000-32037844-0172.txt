THE GERM-CELLS 

(Figs. 71, ^%y Here the spermatozoid is twisted into a conical spiral 
 and bears numerous cilia attached along the upper turns of the spire. 
 The nucleus occupies the lower turns, and attached to them is a large 
 spheroidal cytoplasmic mass, which is cast off when the spermatozoid 
 is set free or at the time it enters the archegonium. This, according 
 to Strasburger, probably corresponds to the basal cytoplasmic mass of 
 CJiara. The upper portion of the spire to which the cilia are attached 
 is composed of cytoplasm alone, as in Chara. Ciliated spermatozoids, 
 nearly similar in type to those of the higher cryptogams, have recently 
 been discovered in the cycads by Hirase {Gingkd), Ikeno {Cycas), and 
 Webber {Zaniia). They are here hemispherical or pear-shaped bodies 
 of relatively huge size (in Zamia upward of 250 ii in length), with a 
 large nucleus filling most of the cell and a spiral band of cilia making 
 from two to six turns about the smaller end (Figs, '^'j, 108). 

As will be shown farther on (p. 173), the "anterior" cytoplasmic 
 region of the spermatozoid, to which the cilia are attached, is probably 
 the analogue of the middle-piece of the animal spermatozoon ; and 
 the work of Belajeff, Strasburger, Ikeno, Hirase, Webber, and Shaw 
 gives good ground for the conclusion that it has an essentially simi- 
 lar mode of origin, though we are still unable to say exactly how far 
 the comparison can be carried. The "posterior" region of the sper- 
 matozoid appears to correspond, broadly speaking, to the acrosome. 

C. Origin of the Germ-cells 

Both ova and spermatozoa take their origin from cells known as 
 primordial germ-cells, which become clearly distinguishable from the 
 somatic cells at an early period of development, and are at first exactly 
 alike in the two sexes. What determines their subsequent sexual 
 differentiation is unknown save in a few special cases. From such 
 data as we possess, there is very strong reason to believe that, with 
 a few exceptions, the primordial germ-cells are sexually indifferent, 
 i.e. neither male nor female, and that their transformation into ova 
 or spermatozoa is not due to an inherent predisposition, but is a reac- 
 tion to external stimulus. Most of the observations thus far made 
 indicate that this stimulus is given by the character of the food, and 
 that the determination of sex is therefore in the last analysis a prob- 
 lem of nutrition. Thus Mrs. Treat ('73) found that if caterpillars 
 were starved before entering the chrysalis state they gave rise to a 
 preponderance of male imagoes, while conversely those of the same 
 brood that were highly fed produced an excess of females. Yung ('81) 
 reached the same result in the case of Amphibia, highly fed tadpoles 
 producing a great excess of females (in some cases as high as 92%) 
 and underfed ones an excess of males. The same result, again, is
