A. Two-cell stage dividing; s. stem-cell, from which arise the germ-cells. B. The same from 
 the side, later in the second cleavage, showing the two types of mitosis and the casting out of

the chromatin is cast out into the cytoplasm, where it degenerates, and 
 only in the germ-cells is the sum-total of the chromatin retained. In 
 Ascaris megalocepJiala univalens the process is as follow?, (Fig. y^): 
 Each of the first two cells receives two elongated chromosomes. As
