is less than in the somatic cells (Fig. 74). Vom Rath, working 
 in the same direction, believes that in the salamander also the 
 number of chromosomes in the early progenitors of the germ-cells 
 is one-half that characteristic of the somatic cells. ^ In both these 
 cases, the chromosomes are doubtless bivalent, representing two

 the two chromosomes of the stem-cell or primordial germ-cells is 
 probably plurivalent, and represents a combination of several units 
 of a lower order which separate during the segmentation of the 
 thread when the somatic mitosis occurs.
