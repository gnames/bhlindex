{a) Growth and Nutrition. â€” Aside from the transformations of 
 the nucleus, which are considered elsewhere, the story of the ova- 
 rian history of the Q.gg is largely a record of the changes involved in 
 nutrition and the storage of material. As the primordial germ-cells 
 enlarge to form the mother-cells of the eggs, they almost invariably 
 become intimately associated with neighbouring cells which not only 
 support and protect them, but also serve as a means for the elabora- 
 tion of food for the growing egg-cell. One of the simplest arrange- 
 ments is that occurring in coelenterates, where the o,^^ lies loose 
 either in one of the general layers or in a mass of germinal tissue, 
 and may crawl actively about among the surrounding cells like an 
 Aniceba. In such cases (hydroids) the Q,g^ may actually feed upon 
 the surrounding cells, taking them bodily into its substance or fusing 
 with them^ and assimilating their substance with its own. In such 
 cases {Ttibtilaria, Hydra) the nuclei of the food-cells long persist in 
 the egg-cytoplasm, forming the so-called " pseudo-cells," but finally 
 degenerate and are absorbed by the Q-^%. It would here seem as 
 if a struggle for existence took place among the young ovarian cells, 
 the victorious individuals persisting as the eggs ; and this view is 
 probably applicable also to the more usual case where the ^^g is 
 only indirectly nourished by its brethren. 

In most cases, as ovarian development proceeds, a definite associa- 
 tion is established between the Q.gg and the surrounding cells. In 
 one of the most frequent arrangements the ovarian cells form a 
 regular layer or follicle about the ovum (Figs. 59, 79), and there is 
 very strong reason to believe that the follicle-cells are immediately 
 concerned with the conveyance of nutriment to the ovum. A num- 
 ber of observers have maintained that the follicle-cells may actually 
 migrate into the interior of the o.'gg, and this seems to be definitely 
 established in the case of the tunicates and mollusks (Fig. 75).^ 
 Such cases are, however, extremely rare; and, as a rule, the material 
 elaborated by the nutritive cells is passed into the o^gg either in solu- 
 tion or in the form of granular or protoplasmic substance.^ An 
 interesting case of this kind occurs in the cycads, where, according 
 to Ikeno ('98), the egg-cell is connected with the surrounding cells 
 by broad protoplasmic bridges through which cytoplasmic material 
 flows directly into the egg-cell. 

Very curious and suggestive conditions occur among the annelids 
 and insects. In the annelids the nutritive cells often do not form
