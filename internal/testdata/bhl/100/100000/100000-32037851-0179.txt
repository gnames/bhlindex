GROWTH AND DIFFERENTIATION OF THE GERM-CELLS 151 

a follicle, but in some forms each o.^^ is accompanied by a single 
 nurse-cell, attached to its side, with which it floats free in the body- 
 cavity. In Ophryotrodia, where it has been carefully described by 
 Korschelt, the nurse-cell is at first much larger than the Qg^ itself, 
 and contains a large, irregular nucleus, rich in chromatin (Fig. "j^). 
 The egg-cell rapidly grows, apparently at the expense of the nurse- 
 cell, which becomes reduced to a mere rudiment attached to one side 
 of the Q.^g and finally disappears. There can hardly be a doubt, 
 as Korschelt maintains, that the nurse-cell is in some manner con- 
 nected with the elaboration of food for the growing egg-cell; and 
 the intensely chromatic 
 character of the nucleus is 
 well worthy of note in this 
 connection. Still more in- 
 teresting are the conditions 
 observed by Wheeler ('96, 
 '97) in Myzostoma, where 
 the young Q^g is accom- 
 panied by two nurse-cells, 
 one at either end. These 
 cells fuse bodily with the 
 ^gg, one having " some- 
 thing to do in forming the 
 vacuolated cytoplasm at 
 the animal pole, . . . the 
 other in forming the granu- 
 lar cytoplasm at the vege- 
 tative pole " ('97, p. 42). 
 The polar axis thus deter- 
 mined persists as that of 
 the ripe ovum. This 
 seems one of the clearest 

cases showing the establishment of the egg-polarity through the 
 relation of the Q.gg to its environment.^ 

Somewhat similar nurse-cells occur in the insects, where they have 
 been carefully described by Korschelt. The eggs here lie in a series 
 in the ovarian " egg-tubes " alternating with nutritive cells vari- 
 ously arranged in different cases. In the butterfly Vanessa, each 
 ^gg is surrounded by a regular follicular layer of cells, a few of 
 which at one end are differentiated into nurse-cells. These cells 
 are very large and have huge amoeboid nuclei, rich in chromatin 
 (Fig. jy, A). In the ear-wig, Forfiada, the arrangement is still more 
 remarkable, and recalls that occurring in OpJiryotrocha. Here each
