THE GERM-CELLS 

%gg lies in the egg-tube just below a very large nurse-cell, which, 
 when fully developed, has an enormous branching nucleus as shown 
 in Fig. 163. In these two cases, again, the nurse-cell is character- 
 ized by the extraordinary development of its nucleus — a fact which 
 points to an intimate relation between the nucleus and the metaboHc 
 activity of the cell.^ 

In all these cases it is doubtful whether the nurse-cells are sister- 
 cells of the Q.gg which have sacrificed their own development for the 
 sake of their companions, or whether they have had a distinct origin 
 from a very early period. That the former alternative is possible is 
 shown by the fact that such a sacrifice occurs in some animals after 
 the eggs have been laid. Thus in the earthworm, Linnbriais terres-

tris, several eggs are laid, but only one develops into an embryo, and 
 the latter devours the undeveloped eggs. A similar process occurs 
 in the marine gasteropods, where the eggs thus sacrificed may 
 undergo certain stages of development before their dissolution.^ 

{b) Dijferentiation of the Cytoplasm and Deposit of Detitoplasm. — 
 In the very young ovum the cytoplasm is small in amount and free 
 from deutoplasm. As the egg enlarges, the cytoplasm increases 
 enormously, a process which involves both the growth of the pro- 
 toplasm and the formation of passive deutoplasm-bodies suspended 
 in the protoplasmic network. During the growth-period a peculiar 
 body known as the yolk-micleiLS appears in the cytoplasm of many 
 ova, and this is probably concerned in some manner with the growth
