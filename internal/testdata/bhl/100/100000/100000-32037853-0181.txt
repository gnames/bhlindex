of the cytoplasm and the formation of the yolk. Both its origin and 
 its physiological role are, however, still involved in doubt. 

The deutoplasm first appears, while the eggs are still very small, 
 in the form of granules which seem to have at first no constant posi- 
 tion with reference to the egg-nucleus, even in the same species. 
 Thus Jordan ('93) states that in the newt {Diemyctyhis) the yolk may 
 be first formed at one side of the Q.g^ and afterward spread to other 
 parts, or it may appear in more or less irregular separate patches 
 which finally form an irregular ring about the nucleus, which at this 
 period has an approximately central position. In some Amphibia

the deutoplasm appears near the periphery and advances inward 
 toward the nucleus. More commonly it first appears in a zone 
 surrounding the nucleus (Fig. y^, C, D) and advances thence toward 
 the periphery (trout, Henneguy ; cephalopods, Ussow). In still others 
 {e.o-. in myriapods, Balbiani) it appears in irregular patches scattered 
 quite irregularly through the ovum (Fig. 78, A). In BraiicJiipns the 
 yolk is laid down at the centre of the Q.gg, while the nucleus lies at 
 the extreme periphery (Brauer). These variations show in general 
 no definite relation to the ultimate arrangement — a fact which 
 proves that the eccentricity of the nucleus and the polarity of the
