THE GERM-CELLS 

Q^g cannot be explained as the result of a simple mechanical dis- 
 placement of the germinal vesicle by the yolk, as some authors have 
 maintained. 

The primary origin of the deutoplasm-grains is a question that 
 involves the whole theory of cell-action and the relation of nucleus

C. Fish {Scorpcsna) , with deutoplasm forming a ring about the nucleus, and an irregular mass 
 of " eliminated chromatin " (? yolk-nucleus). [Van Bambeke.]

and cytoplasm in metabolism. The evidence seems perfectly clear 
 that in many cases the deutoplasm arises in sitti. in the cytoplasm 
 like the zymogen-granules in gland-cells. But there is now also a 
 very considerable body of evidence indicating that a part of the 
 egg-cytoplasm is directly or indirectly derived from the nucleus 
 through the agency of the yolk-nucleus or otherwise ; and the
