subject can best be considered after an account of that body. It 
 may be mentioned here, however, that a large number of observers 
 have maintained a giving off of nuclear substance to the cytoplasm, 
 in the form of actual buds from the nucleus (Blochmann, Scharff, 
 Balbiani, etc.) as separate chromatin-rods or portions of the chromatin 
 network (Fol, Blochmann, Van Bambeke, Erlanger, Mertens, Calkins, 
 Nemec, etc.) or as nucleolar substance (Leydig, Balbiani, Will, Ley- 
 dig, Henneguy), but nearly all of these cases demand reexamination.

 A. Egg of young magpie (eight days), surrounded by the follicle and containing germinal 
 vesicle and " attraction-sphere." B. Primordial egg (oogonium) of new-born cat, dividing. C. Egg 
 of new-born cat containing " attraction-sphere " {s) and centrosome. D. Of young thrush sur- 
 rounded by follicle and containing besides the nucleus an attraction-sphere and centrosome (j), 
 and a yolk-nucleus (j.;/.). E. Of young chick containing nucleus, attraction-sphere, and fatty 
 deutoplasm-spheres (black). F. Egg of new-born cliild, surrounded by follicle and containing 
 nucleus and attraction-sphere. 

(^) Yolk-nuclcns. — The term yolk-iiuclcus or vitelline body {Dottcr- 
 kern, corps vitclliti) has been applied to various bodies or masses 
 that appear in the cytoplasm of the growing ovarian Q.gg ; and it 
 must be said that the word has at present no well-defined mean- 
 ing. As originally described by von Wittich ('45) in the eggs of 
 spiders, and later by Balbiani ('93) in those of certain myriapods, 
 the yolk-nucleus has the form of a single well-defined spheroidal
