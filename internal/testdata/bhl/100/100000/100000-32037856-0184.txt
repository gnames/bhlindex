mass which appears at a very early period and persists throughout 
 the later ovarian history. In other forms there are several so-called 
 " yolk-nuclei," sometimes of fairly definite form as described in the 
 Amphibia by Jordan ('93) and in some of the myriapods by Balbiani 
 ('93). In some forms the numerous "yolk-nuclei" are irregular, ill- 
 defined granular masses scattered through the cytoplasm, as described 
 by Stuhlman {^^6) in the eggs of insects. In still others the " yolk- 
 nucleus " or "vitelline body" closely simulates an attraction-sphere, 
 being surrounded by distinct astral radiations and enclosing one or 
 more central granules like centrosomes [Geophiliis, Balbiani, '93, and 
 Liniitlus, Munson, '98). Balbiani is thus led to regard the yolk- 
 nucleus in general as being a metamorphosed attraction-sphere. 
 Miss Foot ('96) has brought forward evidence to show that the polar 
 rings, observed in the eggs of certain leeches and earthworms, are 
 also to be regarded as "yolk-nuclei" (Fig. 102). Henneguy ('93, 
 '96) finally compares the yolk-nucleus to the macronucleus of the 
 Infusoria (!). 

In the present state of the subject it is quite impossible to reconcile 
 the discordant accounts that have been given regarding the structure, 
 origin, and fate of the "yolk-nuclei", and from the facts thus far 
 determined we can only conclude that the various forms of " yolk- 
 nuclei" have little more in common than the name. It is, in the 
 first place, doubtful whether the "yolk-nuclei" simulating an attrac- 
 tion-sphere have anything in common with the other forms ; and 
 Mertens ('93), Munson ('98), have shown that the young ovarian ova 
 of various birds and mammals (including man) and of Limiilus 
 contain one or more " yolk-nuclei " in addition to the " attraction- 
 sphere " ("vitelline body" of Munson). In the second place there 
 seem to be two well-defined modes of origin of the yolk-nucleus. In 
 one type, illustrated by Jordan's observations on the newt ('93), the 
 " yolk-nuclei " arise separately zV? siUt in the cytoplasm without direct 
 relation to the nucleus. The same is true of the small peripheral 
 " yolk-nuclei " of Lhmdus (Munson). In a second and more frequent 
 type the " yolk-nvicleus " first appears very near to or in contact with 
 the nucleus, suggesting that the latter is directly concerned in its 
 formation. The latter is the case, for example, in the eggs of Cyma- 
 togaster (Hubbard, '94) Syngnathns (Henneguy, '96), the earthworm 
 (Calkins, '95, Foot, '96), Polyzoiiiiini and other myriapods (Nemec, 
 '97, Van Bambeke, '98), LinndiLS (Munson, '98), Cypris (Woltereck, 
 '98), and Molgida (Crampton, '99). In nearly all of these forms the 
 yolk-nucleus first appears in the form of a cap closely applied to one 
 side of the nucleus (Figs. 80, 81), sometimes so closely united to the 
 latter that it is difficult to trace a boundary between them. At a 
 later period the yolk-nucleus moves away from the nucleus and in
