most, if not in all, cases breaks up into smaller and smaller fragments 
 which contribute, directly or indirectly, to the cytoplasmic growth. 
 In all these cases the history of the yolk-nucleus is such as to indi- 
 cate the participation of the nucleus in its formation. Calkins ('95) 
 endeavours to show that the yolk-nucleus in Lumbriais is directly 
 derived from the nucleus by a casting out of a portion of the chro-

matin-reticulum — a result agreeing in principle with earlier obser- 
 vations on other eggs by Balbiani, Henneguy, Ley dig, Will, and 
 other observers. This conclusion rests partly on the apparent direct 
 continuity of yolk-nucleus and chromatin, partly on the staining- 
 reactions. Thus when treated with the Biondi-Ehrlich mixture (basic 
 methyl-green, acid red fuchsin), the yolk-nucleus at first stains green 
 like the chromatin, while the cytoplasm is red, and this is the case
