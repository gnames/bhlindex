158 THE GERM-CELLS 

even after the yolk-nucleus has quite separated from the nuclear 
 membrane. Later, however, as the yolk-nucleus breaks up, it changes 
 its staining power, and stains red like the cytoplasm. The later 
 observations of Miss Foot ('96) give ground to doubt the conclusion 
 that the yolk-nucleus is here actually metamorphosed chromatin, 
 for by the combined action of lithium carmine and Lyons blue its 
 substance is sharply differentiated from the chromatin. Still later 
 studies by Crampton ('99) on Molgida demonstrate that in this case 
 the yolk-nucleus is not directly derived from chromatin, but they 
 nevertheless indicate clearly the formation of the yolk-nucleus by or 
 under the immediate influence of the nucleus â€” a conclusion also 
 reached on less satisfactory evidence by Hubbard, Van Bambeke, 
 Woltereck, and Nemec. The general morphological history of the 
 yolk-nucleus is here closely similar to that of Liinibricus (Fig. 80), 
 except that no direct continuity between it and the nuclear substance 
 was observed. Stained with methyl-green-fuchsin the yolk-nucleus 
 and major part of the nuclear substance stain red, while the scattered 
 nuclear chromatin-granules and the cytoplasm stain green. Millon's 
 test, combined with digestion-experiments and the foregoing staining- 
 reactions, proves that the yolk-nucleus and the red staining nuclear 
 substance consist of albuminous substance and differ widely from 
 the general cytoplasm, which probably consists largely of nucleo- 
 albumins {cf. p. 331). These reactions give strong ground for the 
 conclusion that the substance of the yolk-nucleus, which progressively 
 accumulates just outside the egg-nucleus, is formed through the direct 
 activity of the latter, perhaps arising within the nucleus and passing 
 out into the cytoplasm. It is possible, further, that even the scattered 
 " yolk-nuclei " that seem to be of purely cytoplasmic origin may arise 
 in a similar manner, either, as Crampton suggests, through the early 
 formation and breaking up of a single yolk-nucleus, or in some less 
 obvious way. 

Interesting questions are suggested by those " yolk-nuclei," such 
 as occur in GeopJiilus and Limnlus, that so closely simulate an 
 attraction-sphere. Munson's observations show that this body 
 ("vitelline body") first appears in the very young ova as a crescent 
 applied to the nucleus precisely as in Molgula or Liimbriais, but 
 containing one or more central granules (Fig. 81). In later stages 
 it becomes spherical, moves away from the nucleus, and assumes the 
 form of a typical radial attraction-sphere with concentric microsome- 
 circles and astral rays. It is hardly possible to doubt that this body 
 in Limithis is of the same general nature as the yolk-nucleus of 
 LiLinbricits, Molgula, Cypris, Cymatogaster, or PJiolctis ; and if it be 
 a true attraction-sphere in the one case we must probably so regard 
 it in all. This identification is, however, by no means complete ;
