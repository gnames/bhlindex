and even Munson's careful studies do not seem definitely to establish 
 its connection with the attraction-sphere or centrosome of the last 
 oogonium-division. That a body simulating an attraction-sphere and 
 containing a central granule may arise de novo in the cytoplasm 
 is shown by Lenhossek's observations on the spermatids of the 
 rat (p. 170); and the central granule is in this case certainly not 
 a centrosom.e, since the true centrosomes are found in another 
 part of the cell. It is quite possible that the "vitelHne body" of 
 Liniiilus may have a similar origin. Nemec ('97) finds in Polyzoniictn 
 in the earliest stages a single body applied to the nucleus and 
 later two bodies, one of which enlarges to form a cap-shaped yolk-

nucleus hke those described above, while the other assumes the 
 structure of a radiating attraction-sphere containing a central 
 granule (centrosome .?), and his observations suggest that the two 
 bodies in question may have a common origin (Fig. 81). In none 
 of these cases do the astral radiations, surrounding this body, seem 
 to have any connection with cell-division, and it is probable that 
 a careful comparison of their physiological significance here, in 
 leucocytes, and in mitotic division, may give us a better understand- 
 ing of the general significance of astral formations in protoplasm. 

The fate and physiological significance of the yolk-nucleus are 
 still to a considerable extent involved in doubt. In many cases it
