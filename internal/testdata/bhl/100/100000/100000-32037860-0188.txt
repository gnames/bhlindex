breaks up into smaller and smaller granules {Lumbricus, Molgjtla, 
 Pholcus, some myriapods, Ante don), which scatter through the cyto- 
 plasm and are believed by many observers (Balbiani, Mertens, Will, 
 Calkins, Crampton, Nemec), following the earlier views of Allen 
 Thomson, to become directly converted into deutoplasm-spheres 
 (Fig. 80). Other observers (Van Bambeke, Foot, Stuhlman, and 
 others) adopt the original view of Siebold, that the fragments of 
 the yolk-nucleus are absorbed or converted into protoplasmic 
 elements and thus only indirectly contribute to the yolk. In still 
 other cases {e.g. the " vitelline body " of Lhniilns) the yolk-nucleus 
 does not fragment, but seems to serve as a centre about which new 
 deutoplasmic material is formed. A review of the general subject 
 shows that we are justified only in the somewhat vague conclusion 
 that the yolk-nucleus is probably involved in some manner in the 
 general cytoplasmic growth ; and that the facts strongly suggest, 
 though they hardly yet prove, that at least some forms of yolk-nuclei 
 are products of the nuclear activity and form a connecting link 
 between that activity and the constructive processes of the cyto- 
 plasm. That the yolk-nuclei have no very definite morphological 
 value, and that they are not necessary to growth, seems to be shown 
 by Henneguy's observation, that in the eggs of vertebrates it is in 
 some forms invariably present, in others only rarely, and in still 
 others is quite wanting ('96, p. 162). If this be the case, we must 
 conclude that the yolk-nucleus consists of material that contributes to 
 the constructive process, but is not necessarily localized in a definite 
 body. As to its exact role we are, as Henneguy has said, reduced 
 to mere hypotheses.^ The facts indicate that this material is a prod- 
 uct of the nuclear activity, and that it may in some cases contribute 
 directly to formed elements of the cytoplasm. It is probable, how- 
 ever, that beyond this the yolk-nucleus may supply materials, perhaps 
 ferments, that play a more subtle part in the constructive process, 
 and of whose physiological significance we are quite ignorant. ■ The 
 whole subject seems a most interesting and important one for further 
 study of the actions of the cell in constructive metabolism, and it is to 
 be hoped that further research will place the facts in a clearer light. 

2. Origin of the Spermatozoon 

{a) General. — The relation of the various parts of the sperma- 
 tozoon to the structures of the spermatid is one of the most 
 interesting questions in cytology, since it is here that we must 
 look for a basis of interpretation of the part played by the sperma-
