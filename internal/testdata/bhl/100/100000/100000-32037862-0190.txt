 form of a sphere (sometimes an attraction-sphere) or " Nebenkern " 
 or both. Apart from the nuclear history, these facts have been 
 definitely determined in only a few cases, and much confusion still 
 exists in the accounts of different observers. Thus a number of 
 investigators {e.g. Platner, Field, Benda, Julin, Prenant, Niessing) 
 have asserted that the centrosome passes into the acrosome, instead of

 question, afforded by recent observations on the spermatogenesis of 
 insects, annelids, mollusks. Amphibia, and mammals, leaves, however, 
 little doubt that the former result was an error and that, as the facts
