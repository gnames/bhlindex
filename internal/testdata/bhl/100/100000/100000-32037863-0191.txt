GROWTH AND DIFFERENTIATION OF THE GERM-CELLS 163 

of fertilization would lead us to expect, the centrosome of the sper- 
 matid passes into the middle-piece. 

Accounts vary considerably regarding the origin of the acrcfsome, 
 which according to most authors is of cytoplasmic origin, while a few 
 describe it as arising inside or from the anterior part of the nucleus. 

iU) Composition of the Spermatid. â€” The confusion that has arisen 
 in this difficult subject is owing to the fact that the spermatid may 
 contain, besides the nucleus and centrosome, no less than three addi- 
 tional bodies, which were endlessly confused in the earlier studies 
 on the subject. These are the Nebenkern} the attraction-sphere or 
 idiozome (Meves), and the chromatoid Nebenkorpei' {^e.nd3.). 

The Nebenkern (Fig. 82), first described by Biitschli ('71) in the 
 spermatids of butterflies, was afterward shown by La Valette ('86), 
 Platner ('86, '89), and many later investigators to arise wholly or in 
 part from the remaiiis of the spindle of the second spermatocyte 
 division. Its origin is thus related to that of an attraction-sphere 
 (which it often closely simulates), since the latter likewise arises 
 from the achromatic figure. To the remains of the spindle, however, 
 may be added granular elements, probably forming reserve-material 
 ("centro-deutoplasm of Erlanger), that are scattered through the cyto- 
 plasm or aggregated about the equator of the spindle (Fig. 126). 
 Thus the Nebenkern may have a double origin, though its basis is 
 formed by the spindle-remains. The Nebenkern sometimes takes a 
 definite part in the formation of the tail-envelopes and of the acro- 
 some (insects), but in many cases it seems to be wholly wanting.^ 
 The idiozome is in some cases an undoubted attraction-sphere derived 
 from the aster of the last division and at first containing the centro- 
 some, e.g. in the earthworm as shown by Calkins ('95) and Er- 
 langer ('96, 4), in the salamander and guinea-pig, Meves ('96, '99), 
 and in Helix according to Korff ('99), though in later stages the 
 centrosomes usually pass out of the body of the idiozome. In some 
 cases, however (in the rat, according to Lenhossek, '99), the idiozome 
 seems to arise independently through condensation of the cytoplasmic 
 substance into a sphere having no relation to the centrosomes. In 
 some cases the idiozomes of adjoining cells remain for a time con- 
 nected by bridges of material (Fig. 7) representing the remains of 
 the spindle, and hence corresponding to a Nebenkern {e.g. salaman- 
 der, Meves, '96), and the distinction between Nebenkern and idio- 
 zome here fades away. The idiozome is usually concerned in the 
 formation of the acrosome (Amphibia, mammals), but sometimes seems 

^ The English equivalent of this should be paranucleus, but the latter word has already 
 been used in various other senses, and it seems preferable to retain Biitschli's original Ger- 
 man word.
