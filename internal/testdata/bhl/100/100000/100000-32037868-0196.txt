"archoplasm" of the spermatid. Suzuki's studies clearly show, how- 
 ever, that the entire axial filament of the long middle-piece arises by 
 the elongation of the inner centrosome, while the outer centrosome, 
 from which the axial filament of the tail grows out, lies at the pos- 
 terior limit of the middle-piece (Fig. 85). A nearly similar result is 
 reached by Korff ('99) in the case of Helix. It was shown by God- 
 lewski ('97) that in this form the axial filament likewise grows out

from the centrosome. Korff's later studies show that here, exactly 
 as in the elasmobranch, the axial filament grows out from the periph- 
 eral centrosome and is afterward transformed into a ring (Fig. 85). 
 The inner centrosome elongates to form a rod, which afterward 
 becomes a long filament traversing the elongated middle-piece and 
 terminating in front in an end-knob at the base of the nucleus, while 
 the ring lies at its posterior limit. The idiozome (a true attraction- 
 sphere) degenerates without taking part in the formation of an aero-
