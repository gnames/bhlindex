some. The envelope of the middle-piece is here formed out of the 
 general cytoplasm. 

In the mammals the recent work of Lenhossek on the rat ('98) and 
 Meves on the rat, guinea-pig, and man ('98, '99) gives a result agree- 
 ing in its broader features with the forms already considered. In all 
 these mammals the young spermatids are closely similar to those of 
 the salamander, containing two peripherally placed centrosomes, from 
 the outer one of which the axial filament grows out (Fig. 86). Meves

and Lenhossek differ somewhat in their accounts of the later history 
 of these centrosomes, though agreeing that both contribute to the 
 formation of the middle-piece. Lenhossek states that in the rat both 
 centrosomes persist at the base of the nucleus to form the end-knob, 
 which, as Jensen showed ('87), is double in this animal. Meves finds 
 the process to be more complicated, agreeing in the main with that 
 observed by him in the salamander. In man and the rat the inner 
 centrosome passes to the base of the nucleus and flattens against it 
 to form a small disc-shaped body. The posterior centrosome divides
