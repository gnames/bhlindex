A. Primary spermatogonium (two generations before the primary spermatocytes) in division, 
 showing centrosomes. B. Primary spermatocyte with pair of " blepharoplastoids " (centrosomes). 
 C. Spindle of primary spermatocyte (first maturation-division). D. Four of the eight secondary 
 spermatocytes with blepharoplast. E~G. Prophase of second maturation-division. H. Pair of 
 spermatids ( Gyninogramyne) with blepharoplasts. I-J. Formation of the cihated band from the 
 blepharoplast. K. Nearly ripe spermatozoid, showing ciliated band {b), nucleus, and "cyto- 
 plasmic vesicle" (the latter is ultimately cast off). L. M. Spermatids of Equisetuni. N. Ripe 
 spermatozoid from above, showing spiral ciliated band. O. Ripe spermatozoid of Marsilla with 
 very long spiral ciliated band.
