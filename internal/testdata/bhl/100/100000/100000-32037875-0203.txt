STAINING-REACTIONS OF THE GERM-NUCLEI 175 

Webber and Ikeno have produced apparently strong evidence ^ that 
 they arise separately and de novo in the cytoplasm. After the ensu- 
 ing division (by which the two spermatids are formed) the astral rays 
 disappear, and the blepharoplast gives rise by a peculiar process to a 
 long, spiral, deeply staining band, from which the cilia grow forth. 
 The later studies of Shaw ('98, i) and Belajeff ('99) on the blepharo- 
 plasts in Onoclea and Marsilia leave no doubt that these bodies are 
 to be identified with centrosomes. In Marsilia Shaw first found the 
 blepharoplasts lying at the poles of the spindle during the anaphase 
 of the first maturation-division and very closely resembhng centro- 
 somes. Each blepharoplast, at first single, divides into two during the 
 late telophase, and during the prophases of the second division the 
 halves diverge to opposite poles of the nucleus and lie at the respec- 
 tive spindle-poles. This account is confirmed by Belajeff, who shows 
 further that during the prophases astral rays surround the blepharo- 
 plasts, and a central spindle is formed between them (Fig. ^'^\ 
 Belajeff also finds centrosomes in all of the earlier spermatogenic 
 divisions. The blepharoplasts are thus proved to be, in one case at 
 least, dividing" organs which in every way correspond to the centro- 
 somes of the animal spermatocytes; and the justice of Belajeff's 
 comparison is demonstrated. Shaw believed that the primary blepha- 
 roplast, which by division gives rise to those of the two spermatids, 
 arose de novo. He made, however, the significant observation that 
 in Marsilia "blepharoplastoids," exactly like the blepharoplasts, ap- 
 pear at the spindle-poles of the preceding (antepenultimate) division, 
 and that each of these divides into two in the late telophase. These 
 are said to disappear, without relation to the blepharoplasts which at 
 a slightly later period are found at the spindle-poles of the first matu- 
 ration division ; but in view of the demonstrated continuity of the 
 blepharoplasts during the second division we may well hesitate to 
 accept this result, as well as Webber's conclusion regarding the 
 independent and separate origin of the blepharoplasts in Zainia. In 
 any case the facts give the strongest ground for the conclusion that 
 the formation of the spermatozoids agrees in its essential features 
 with that of the spermatozoa, and for the expectation that the history 
 of the achromatic structures in fertilization will yet be found to show 
 an essential agreement in plants and animals.
