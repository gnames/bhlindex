FERTILIZATION OF THE OVUM 

" It is conceivable, and indeed probable, that every part of the adult contains molecules 
 derived both from the male and from the female parent; and that, regarded as a mass of 
 molecules, the entire organism may be compared to a web of which the warp is derived from 
 the female and the woof from the male." Huxley.^ 

In mitototic cell-division we have become acquainted with the means 
 by which, in all higher forms at least, not only the continuity of life, 
 but also the maintenance of the species, is effected ; for through this 
 beautiful mechanism the cell hands on to its descendants an exact dupli- 
 cate of the idioplasm by which its own organization is determined. 
 As far as we can see from an a priori point of view, there is no reason 
 why, barring accident, cell-division should not follow cell-division in 
 endless succession in the stream of life. It is possible, indeed prob- 
 able, that such may be the fact in some of the lower and simpler forms 
 of life where no form of sexual reproduction is known to occur. In 
 the vast majority of living forms, however, the series of cell-divisions 
 tends to run in cycles in each of which the energy of division finally 
 comes to an end and is only restored by an admixtiire of living mat- 
 ter derived front another cell. This operation, known as fertiliza- 
 tion or fecundation, is the essence of sexual reproduction ; and in it we 
 behold a process by which on the one hand the energy of division is 
 restored, and by which on the other hand two independent lines of 
 descent are blended into one. Why this dual process should take 
 place we are as yet unable to say, nor do we know which of its two 
 elements is to be regarded as the primary and essential one. 

Harvey and many other of the early embryologists regarded fer- 
 tilization as a stimulus, given by the spermatozoon, through which the 
 ovum was " animated " and thus rendered capable of development. 
 In its modern form this conception appears in the " dynamic " theories 
 of Herbert Spencer, Biitschli, Hertwig, and others, which assume that 
 protoplasm tends gradually to pass into a state of increasingly sta- 
 ble equilibrium in which its activity diminishes, and that fertilization 
 restores it to a labile state, and hence to one of activity, through mix- 
 ture with protoplasm that has been subjected to different conditions. 
 Biitschli ('76) pointed out that the life-cycle of the metazoon is com-
