FERTILIZATION OF THE OVUM 

crossing produces both greater vigour and greater variability. In view 
 of all the facts, however, we are constrained to the admission that the 
 essential nature of sexual reproduction must remain undetermined until 
 the subject shall have been far more thoroughly investigated, espe- 
 cially in the unicellular forms, where the key to the ultimate problem 
 is undoubtedly to be sought. 

A. Preliminary General Sketch 

Among the unicellular plants and animals, fertilization is effected 
 by means of conjugation, a process in which two individuals either 
 fuse together permanently or unite temporarily and effect an exchange

 A. The entire spermatozoon lies in the egg, its nucleus at the right, fiagellum at the left, while 
 the minute sperm-amphiaster occupies the position of the middle-piece. The first polar body has 
 been formed, the second is forming. B. The enlarged sperm-nucleus and sperm-amphiaster lie 
 near the centre ; second polar body forming and the first dividing. The egg-centrosomes and 
 asters afterward disappear, their place being taken by those of the spermatozoon. 

of nuclear matter, after which they separate. In all the Jiigher forms 
 fertilisation consists in the permanent fusion of tzvo germ-cells, one of 
 paterjial and one of maternal origin. We may first consider the fer- 
 tilization of the animal Q.%g, which appears to take place in essentially 
 the same manner throughout the animal kingdom, and to be closely 
 paralleled by the corresponding process in plants.
