PRELIMINARY GENERAL SKETCH l8l 

Leeuwenhoek, whose pupil Hamm discovered the spermatozoa 
 (1677), put forth the conjecture that the spermatozoon must pene- 
 trate into the ^^g ; and the classical experiments of Spallanzani on 
 the frog's o,^^ (1786) proved that the fertilizing element must be the 
 spermatozoa and not the liquid in which they swim. The penetration 
 of the ovum was, however, not actually seen until 1854, when Newport 
 observed it in the case of the frog's ^gg ; and it was described by 
 Pringsheim a year later in one of the lower plants, (Edigonitim. The 
 first adequate description of the process was given by Hermann Fol, 
 in 1879,^ though many earlier observers, from the time of Martin 
 Barry ('43) onward, had seen the spermatozoon inside the egg-enve- 
 lopes, or asserted its entrance into the &gg. 

In many cases the entire spermatozoon enters the Qgg (mollusks, 
 insects, nematodes, some annelids, Petromyzon, axolotl, etc.), and in 
 such cases the long fiagellum may sometimes be seen coiled within 
 the &gg (Fig. 89). Only the nucleus and middle-piece, however, are 
 concerned in the actual fertilization ; and there are some cases 
 (echinoderras) in which the tail is left outside the Q.gg. At or near 
 the time of fertilization, the ^gg successively segments off at the upper 
 pole two minute cells, known as Wio. polar' bodies {Y\g^. 89, 90, 116) or 
 directive corpuscles, which degenerate and take no part in the subse- 
 quent development. This phenomenon takes place, as a rule, imme- 
 diately after entrance of the spermatozoon. It may, however, occur 
 before the spermatozoon enters, and it forms no part of the process 
 of fertilization proper. It is merely the final act in the process of 
 maturation, by which the e,gg is prepared for fertilization, and we 
 may defer its consideration to the following chapter. 

I. 77^1? Germ-nuclei in Fertilization 

The modern era in the study of fertilization may be said to begin 
 with Oscar Hertwig s discovery, in 1875, of the fate of the sperma- 
 tozoon within the Qgg. Earlier observers had, it is true, paved the 
 way by showing that, at the time of fertilization, the &gg contains 
 two nuclei that fuse together or become closely associated before 
 development begins. (Warneck, Butschli, Auerbach, Van Beneden, 
 Strasburger.) Hertwig discovered, in the Qgg of the sea-urchin 
 ( Toxopneiistes lividius), that one of these nuclei belongs to the egg, 
 while the other is derived front the spermatozoon. This result was 
 speedily confirmed in a number of other animals, and has since been 
 extended to every species that has been carefully investigated. The 
 researches of Strasburger, De Bary, Schmitz, Guignard, and others 
 have shown that the same is true of plants. In every knozvn case an
