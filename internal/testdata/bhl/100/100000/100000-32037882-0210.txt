1 82 FERTILIZATION OF THE OVUM 

essential phenomenon of fertilizatio7i is the union of a sperm-nucletis, 
 of paternal origin, zvitJi an egg-nnclens, of maternal origin, to form the 
 primary nucleus of the embryo. This nnclejis, knozun as the cleavage- 
 or segmentation-nucleus , gives rise by division to all the nuclei of the 
 body, and hence every nucleus of tJie child may contain nuclear substance 
 derived from both parents. And thus Hertwig was led to the conchi- 
 sion ('84), independently reached at the same time by Strasburger, 
 Kolliker, and Weismann, that the nucleus is the most essential ele- 
 ment concerned in hereditary transmission. 

This conclusion received a strong support in the year 1883, through 
 the splendid discoveries of Van Beneden on the fertilization of the 
 thread-worm, Ascaris megalocephala, the Qgg of which has since ranked 
 with that of the echinoderm as a classical object for the study of cell- 
 problems. Van Beneden's researches especially elucidated the struc- 
 ture and transformations of the germ-nuclei, and carried the analysis 
 of fertilization far beyond that of Hertwig. In Ascaris, as in all 
 other animals, the sperm-nucleus is extremely minute, so that at first 
 sight a marked inequality between the two sexes appears to exist 
 in this respect. Van Beneden showed not only that the inequality in 
 size totally disappears during fertilization, but that the two nuclei 
 undergo a parallel series of structural changes which demonstrate 
 their precise morphological equivalence down to the minutest detail ; 
 and here, again, later researches, foremost among them those of 
 Boveri, Strasburger, and Guignard, have shown that, essentially, the 
 same is true of the germ-cells of other animals and of plants. The 
 facts in Ascaris (variety bivalens) are essentially as follows (Fig. 
 90) : After the entrance of the spermatozoon, and during the for- 
 mation of the polar bodies, the sperm-nucleus rapidly enlarges and 
 finally forms a typical nucleus exactly similar to the egg-nucleus. 
 The chromatin in each nucleus now resolves itself into two long, 
 worm-like chromosomes, which are exactly similar in form, size, and 
 staining-reaction in the two nuclei. Next, the nuclear membrane 
 fades away, and the four chromosomes lie naked in the egg-substance. 
 Every trace of sexual difference has now disappeared, and it is 
 impossible to distinguish the paternal from the maternal chromo- 
 somes (Fig. 90, D, E). Meanwhile an amphiaster has been devel- 
 oped which, with the four chromosomes, forms the mitotic figure for 
 the first cleavage of the ovum, the cJiromatic portion of which has 
 been synthetically formed by the union of tzvo equal germ-nuclei. The 
 later phases follow the usual course of mitosis. Each chromosome 
 splits lengthwise into equal halves, the daughter-chromosomes are 
 transported to the spindle-poles, and here they give rise, in the usual 
 manner, to the nuclei of the two-celled stage. Each of these nuclei, 
 therefore, receives exactly equal amounts of paternal and maternal 
 chromatin.
