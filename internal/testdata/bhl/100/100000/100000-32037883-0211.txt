Fig. 90. â€” Fertilization of the egg of Ascaris megaloccphala, var. bivalens. [BOVERI.] (For 
 later stages see Figs. 31, 145.) 

A. The spermatozoon has entered the egg, its nucleus is shown at S ; beside it lies the granu- 
 lar mass of " archoplasm " (attraction-sphere) ; above are the closing phases in the formation 
 of the second polar body (two chromosomes in each nucleus). B. Germ-nuclei (?, J) in the 
 reticular stage ; the attraction-sphere {a) contains the dividing centrosome. C. Chromosomes 
 forming in the germ-nuclei ; the centrosome divided. D. Each germ-nucleus resolved into two 
 chromosomes; attraction-sphere {a) double. E. Mitotic figure forming for the first cleavage; 
 the chromosomes {c) already split. F. First cleavage in progress, showing divergence of the 
 daughter-chromosomes toward the spindle-poles (only three chromosomes shown).
