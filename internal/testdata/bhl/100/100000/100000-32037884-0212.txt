FERTILIZATION OF THE OVUM 

These discoveries were confirmed and extended in the case of 
 Ascaris by Boveri and by Van Beneden himself in 1887 and 1888 
 and in several other nematodes by Carnoy in 1887. Carnoy found 
 the number of chromosomes derived from each sex to be in Coronilla 
 4, in Ophiostoniinn 6, and in Filaroides 8. A little later Boveri 
 ('90) showed that the law of numerical equality of the paternal and 
 maternal chromosomes held good for other groups of animals, being 
 in the sea-urchin Echinus 9, in the worm Sagitta 9, in the medusa 
 Tiara 14, and in the mollusk PterotracJiea 16 from each sex. Similar 
 results were obtained in other animals and in plants, as first shown by 
 Guignard in the lily ('91), where each sex contributes 12 chromosomes.

 A. Egg of nematode parasitic in ScyUiuvi ; the two germ-nuclei in apposition, each containing 
 four chromosomes; the two polar bodies above. B. Egg of Filaroides ; each germ-nucleus with 
 eight chromosomes ; polar bodies above, deutoplasm-spheres below. 

In the onion the number is 8 (Strasburger) ; in the annelid OpJiryo- 
 trocha it is only 2 from each sex (Korschelt). In all these cases the 
 7tnmber contributed by each is one-half the number characteristic of the 
 body-cells. The union of two germ-cells thus restores the normal 
 number, and here we find the explanation of the remarkable fact 
 commented on at page 67 that the number of cJiromosomes in sexually 
 produced organisms is always even} 

These remarkable facts demonstrate the two germ-nuclei to be in 
 a morphological sense precisely equivalent, and they not only lend 
 very strong support to Hertwig's identification of the nucleus as the 
 bearer of hereditary qualities, but indicate further that these qualities
