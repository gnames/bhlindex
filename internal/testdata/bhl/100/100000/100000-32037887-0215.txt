aster or amphiaster) is developed in the neighbourhood of the sperm- 
 nucleus, and this in a large number of cases gives rise or is definitely- 
 related to the cleavage- 
 amphiaster (coelente- 
 rates, flat-worms, echi- 
 noderms, nematodes, 
 annelids, arthropods, 
 mollusks, tunicates, ver- 
 tebrates). In many of 
 these cases the sperm- 
 aster, which by divi- 
 sion gives rise to the 
 amphiaster, has been 
 found to arise in inti- 
 mate relation with the 
 middle -piece of the 
 spermatozoon ; e.g. in 
 echinoderms(Flemming, 
 Hertwig, Boveri, Wil- 
 son, Mathews, Hill, etc.), 
 in the axolotl(Fick) and 
 salamander (Michaelis), 
 in the tunicates (Hill), 
 annelids (Foot, Vejdov- 
 sky), insects (Henking), 
 nematodes (Meyer, Er- 
 langer), and mollusks 
 (Henking, Kostanecki, 
 and Wierzejski). The 
 agreement between 
 forms so diverse is very 
 strong evidence that this 
 is a very general phe- 
 nomenon, and it is one of 
 great interest, owing to 
 the fact that the middle- 
 piece is itself derived 
 from or contains the 
 centrosome of the sper- 
 matid.^ 

The facts may be il- 
 lustrated by a brief 
 description of the phe-

 dle-piece and part of the flagellum. B. C. Immediately 
 after entrance, sliowing entrance-cone. D. Rotation of the 
 sperm-head, formation of the sperm-aster about the middle- 
 piece. E. Casting off of middle-piece; centrosome at focus 
 of the rays {cf. Fig. 12). The changes figured occupy about 
 eight minutes. F. G. Approach of the germ-nuclei ; grow th
