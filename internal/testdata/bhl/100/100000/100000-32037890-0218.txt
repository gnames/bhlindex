FERTILIZATION OF THE OVUM 

while in Chcetopteriis and Pieris the first polar spindle has advanced 
 into the anaphase.^ 

It is an interesting and significant fact that the aster or amphiaster 
 always leads the way in the march toward the egg-nucleus ; and in 
 many cases it may be far in advance of the sperm-nucleus.^ Boveri 
 ('87, i) has observed in sea-urchins that the sperm-nucleus may indeed 
 be left entirely behind, the aster alone conjugating with the egg-

nucleus and causing division of the o,^^ without itnion of the germ- 
 nuclei, though the sperm-nucleus afterward conjugates with one of 
 the nuclei of the two-cell stage. This process, known as " partial fer- 
 tilization," is undoubtedly to be regarded as abnormal. It affords, 
 however, a beautiful illustration of the view that it is the centro- 
 some alone that incites division of the egg, and is therefore the fer- 
 tilizing element proper (Boveri, 'Z'j, 2). 

The foregoing facts lead us to a consideration of Boveri's theory 
 of fertilization, which has for several years formed a central point of 
 discussion. The ground for this theory had been prepared by Oscar
