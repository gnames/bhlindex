 the asters represented " centres of attraction " lying outside and 
 independent of the nucleus. Oscar Hertwig showed, in 1875, that

in the sea-urchin Qgg, the amphiaster arises by the division of a 
 single aster that first appears near the sperm-nucleus and accompanies 
 it in its progress toward the egg-nucleus. A similar observation was 
 soon afterward made by Fol ('79) in the eggs of Astcrias and 
 Sagitta, and in the latter case he determined the fact that the astral
