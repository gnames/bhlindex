192 FERTILIZATION OF THE OVUM 

rays do not centre in the nucleus, as Hertwig described, but at a 
 point m advance of it — a fact afterward confirmed by Hertwig 
 himself and by Boveri ('88, i). Hertwig and Fol afterward found 
 that in cases of polyspermy, when several spermatozoa enter the Q.^%, 
 each sperm-nucleus is accompanied by an aster, and Hertwig proved 
 that each of these might give rise to an amphiaster (Fig. loi). In 
 1886—87 Vejdovsky brought forward strong evidence to show that 
 in the fresh-water annelid RhyncJielmis the cleavage-amphiaster 
 arises directly from the sperm-amphiaster, itself derived by the 
 division of a " periplast " (attraction-sphere) imported into the tg^ by 
 the spermatozoon, while the polar amphiaster entirely disappears. 
 It was Boveri i^^T, 2) who first carefully studied the facts with 
 reference to the centrosome, reaching the conclusion (in the case of 
 Ascaris and the sea-urchin) that a single centrosome is brought 
 in by the spermatozoon, and that it divides to form two centres about 
 which are developed the two asters of the cleavage-figure. He was 
 thus led to the following conclusion, which has received the sup- 
 port of many later investigators : The ripe egg possesses all of the 
 organs and qualities necessary for division excepting the centrosome, 
 by which division is initiated. The sper'niatozoon, on the other hand, 
 is provided with a centj^osoine, bnt lacks the substance in which this 
 orga7i of division may exert its activity. Through the union of the 
 two cells in fertilization, all of the essential organs necessary for 
 division are brongJit together ; the egg now contains a cejitrosome 
 which by its ozvn division leads the ivay in the embryonic develop- 
 ment.^ Very numerous observations, supporting this conclusion, have 
 been made by later observers. Bohm could find in Petromyzon ('88) 
 and the trout ('91) no radiations near the egg-nucleus after the 
 formation of the polar-bodies, while a beautiful sperm-aster is devel- 
 oped near the sperm-nucleus and divides to form the amphiaster. 
 Platner i^^^^ had already made similar observations in the snail 
 Arion, and the same result was soon afterward reached by Brauer 
 ('92) in the case of Branchipjis, and by Julin ('93) in Styleopsis. 
 Fick's careful study of fertilization of the axolotl ('93) proved in 
 a very convincing manner not only that the amphiaster is a product 
 of the sperm-aster, but also that the latter is developed about the 
 middle-piece as a centre. The same result was indicated by Foot's 
 observations on the earthworm ('94), and it was soon afterward 
 conclusively demonstrated in echinoderms through the independent 
 and nearly simultaneous researches of myself on the ^^g of Toxo- 
 pneustes, of Mathews on Aj'bacia, and of Boveri on Echinus. Nearly 
 at the same time a careful study was made by Mead ('95, '98, i) of 
 the annelid ChcBtopterics^ and of the starfish Asterias by Mathews,
