both observers independently showing that the polar spindle contains 
 distinct centrosomes, which, however, degenerate after the formation 
 of the polar bodies, their place being taken by the sperm-centrosome, 
 which divides to form an amphiaster before union of the nuclei, as 
 in Rhynchelmis. Exactly the same result has since been reached by 
 Hill ('95) and Reinke ('95) in SpJiczrecJiinus, by Hill in the tunicate 
 Phalliisia, by Kostanecki and Wierzejski ('96) in Physa (Fig. 89), 
 and by Van der Stricht ('98) in TJiysaiiozo'dn ; and in all of these the 
 centrosome is likewise shown to arise from the middle-piece or in 
 its immediate neighbourhood. Among others who have produced

evidence that the cleavage-centrosome stands in definite relation to 
 the spermatozoon, may be mentioned Oppel ('92) in reptiles, Brauer 
 ('92) in Bra7icJiipus, Henking ('92) in insects, Riickert ('95, 2) in 
 Cyclops, Sobotta ('95) in the mouse and ('98) Amphioxus, Ziegler ('95) 
 in Diplogastcr and RJiabditis, Castle ('96) in Ciona, Korschelt 
 ('95) in Ophryotrocha, Meyer ('95) in Strongyliis, Griffin ('96, '99) 
 in Thalassema, and Coe ('98) in Ccrebratulus. 

Beside the foregoing evidence may be placed the following addi- 
 tional data based on experiment and the study of pathological fer- 
 tilization, (i) In the case of sea-urchin eggs, Hertwig, Boveri, and
