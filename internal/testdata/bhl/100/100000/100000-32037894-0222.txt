194 FERTILIZATION OF THE OVUM 

several later observers have shown that egg-fragments, obtained by- 
 shaking eggs to pieces, are readily penetrated by the spermatozoa, 
 and that such fragments, though containing no nuclear matter from 
 the Qgg, may segment and give rise to perfect larvae.^ (2) Boveri 
 ('88) has observed that in ordinary fertilization the sperm-aster may 
 separate from the sperm-nucleus, travel through the cytoplasm to the 
 egg-nucleus and cause cleavage, the sperm-nucleus afterward fusing 
 with one of the nuclei of the two-cell stage (" partial fertilization "). 
 (3) Most remarkable of all, Boveri, confirmed by Ziegler ('98), has 
 recently observed that during the first cleavage the whole of the 
 chromxatin may pass to one pole, so that upon division one of the 
 halves of the ^%g receives only a centrosome without a nucleus. In 
 the nucleated half cleavage proceeds as usual. In the enucleated 
 half the centrosomes and asters continue for a considerable period 
 to multiply at the same rate as the cleavage of the nucleated half, 
 though the cell-body does not itself divide.^ Putting these facts 
 together we must conclude (i) that something is introduced into the 
 ^&g by the middle-piece of each spermatozoon entering it that is 
 either a centrosome or has the power to incite the formation of one ; 
 (2) that the centrosome thus arising is structurally independent of 
 both nuclei and may divide independently of them ; (3) that indepen- 
 dently of the division of the nucleus or cell-body there is some kind 
 of historical continuity between the centrosomes of successive genera- 
 tions. 

In the case of echinoderm-eggs this continuity is not yet known to 
 be effected by actual persistence of the centrosomes.^ There are, 
 however, a number of cases in which the division of the primary 
 cleavage-centrosomes and the persistence of their descendants as 
 those of the daughter-cells seem to have been conclusively shown â€” 
 for example on Ascaris (Van Beneden, Boveri, Kostanecki, and Sied- 
 lecki), in the trout (Henneguy, '96), in TJialassema (Griffin, '96, '99), 
 in ChiBtopterus QA&-3idi, '95, '98), in Physa (Kostanecki and Wierzejski, 
 '96), in CerebrahUiis (Coe, '98), and in RJiyndielniis (Vejdovsky and 
 Mrazek, '98). In TJialassema and Cer-ebraUdns (Figs. 99, 155) the 
 centrosome is a minute granule at the focus of the sperm-aster, 
 which divides to form an amphiaster soon after the entrance of the 
 spermatozoon. During the early anaphase of the first cleavage, each 
 centrosome divides into two, passes to the outer periphery of the 
 centrosphere, and there forms a minute amphiaster for the second

^ Erlanger's statement ('98) that the centrosomes persist through the first cleavage in 
 echinoderm-eggs is not supported by his figures ; and I am convinced from my own long- 
 continued studies of these eggs, as well as by an examination of Erlanger's preparations, 
 kindly placed in my hands by Professor Biitschli, that these difficult objects are very unfavour- 
 able for a decision of the question.
