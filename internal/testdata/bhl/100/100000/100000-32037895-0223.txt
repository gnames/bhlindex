cleavage before the first cleavage takes place. The minute centro- 
 somes of the second cleavage are therefore the direct descendants of 
 the sperm-centrosome ; and there is good reason to believe that the 
 continuity is not broken in later stages. The facts are nearly similar

in the trout, in CJicztopterns, and in PJiysa. In Ascaris division of 
 the centrosome first occurs at a somewhat later period (Figs. 90, 176). 
 If now the centrosomes were indeed permanent cell-organs, we 
 should thus reach the following result : During cleavage the cytoplasm 
 of the blastoiicrcs is derived froDi that of the egg, the cejitrosovies froui
