dence of a definite attraction between the germ-cells, which is 
 in some cases so marked (for example in the polyp Renilla) that 
 when spermatozoa and ova are mixed in a small vessel, each ovum 
 becomes in a few moments surrounded by a dense fringe of sperma- 
 tozoa attached to its periphery by their heads and by their move- 
 ments actually causing the ovum to move about. The nature of the 
 attraction is not positively known, but Pfeffer's researches on the 
 spermatozoids of plants leave little doubt that it is of a chemical 
 nature, since he found the spermatozoids of ferns and of Selaginella 
 to be as actively attracted by solutions of malic acid or malates (con- 
 tained in capillary tubes) as by the substance extruded from the

neck of the archegonium. Those of mosses, on the other hand, are 
 indifferent to malic acid, but are attracted by cane-sugar. These 
 experiments indicate that the specific attraction between the germ- 
 cells of the same species is owing to the presence of specific chemical 
 substances in each case. There is clear evidence, furthermore, that 
 the attractive force is not exerted by the egg-nucleus alone, but by 
 the egg-cytoplasm ; for, as the Hertwigs and others have shown, 
 spermatozoa will readily enter egg-fragments entirely devoid of a 
 nucleus. 

In naked eggs, such as those of some echinoderms, and coelen- 
 terates, the spermatozoon may enter at any point ; but there are 
 some cases in which the point of entrance is predetermined by the
