198 FERTILIZATION OF THE OVUM 

presence of special structures through which the spermatozoon 
 enters (Fig. 100). Thus, the starfish-egg, according to Fol, pos- 
 sesses before fertilization a peculiar protoplasmic "attraction-cone" 
 to which the head of the spermatozoon becomes attached, and through 
 which it enters the &gg. In some of the hydromedusas, on the other 
 hand, the entrance point is marked by a funnel-shaped depression at 
 the egg-periphery (Metschnikoff). When no preformed attraction- 
 cone is present, an " entrance-cone " is sometimes formed by a rush 
 of protoplasm toward the point at which the spermatozoon strikes 
 the Q^^ and there forming a conical elevation into which the sperm- 
 head passes. In the sea-urchin (Fig. 100) this structure persists 
 only a short time after the spermatozoon enters, soon assuming a 
 ragged flame-shape and breaking up into slender rays. In some 
 cases the Q.g^ remains naked, even after fertilization, as appears to 
 be the case in many coelenterates. More commonly a vitelline mem- 
 brane is quickly formed after contact of the spermatozoon, — e.g. 
 in AmpJiioxiis, in the echinoderms, and in many plants, — and by 
 means of this the entrance of other spermatozoa is prevented. In 
 eggs surrounded by a membrane before fertilization, the spermato- 
 zoon either bores its way through the membrane at any point, as is 
 probably the case with mammals and Amphibia, or may make its 
 entrance through a micropyle. 

In some forms only one spermatozoon normally enters the ovum, 
 as in echinoderms, mammals, many annelids, etc., while in others 
 several may enter (insects, elasmobranchs, reptiles, the earthworm, 
 Petromyzon, etc.). In the former case more than one spermatozoon 
 may accidentally enter (pathological polyspermy), but develojoment 
 is then always abnormal. In such cases each sperm-centrosome 
 gives rise to an amphiaster, and the asters may then unite to form 
 the most complex polyasters, the nodes of which are formed by the 
 centrosomes (Fig. loi). Such eggs either do not divide at all or 
 undergo an irregular multiple cleavage and soon perish. If, how- 
 ever, only two spermatozoa enter, the egg may develop for a time. 
 Thus Driesch has determined the interesting fact, which I have con- 
 firmed, that sea-urchin eggs into which two spermatozoa have acci- 
 dentally entered undergo a double cleavage, dividing into four at the 
 first cleavage, and forming eight instead of four micromeres at the 
 fourth cleavage. Such embryos develop as far as the blastula stage, 
 but never form a gastrula.^ In cases where several spermatozoa 
 normally enter the Q^g (physiological polyspermy), only one of the 
 sperm-nuclei normally unites with the egg-nucleus, the supernumer- 
 ary sperm-nuclei either degenerating, or in rare cases — e.g. in elas- 
 mobranchs and reptiles — living for a time and even dividing to form
