"merocytes" or accessory nuclei. The fate of the latter is still in 
 doubt ; but they certainly take no part in fertilization. 

It is an interesting question how the entrance of supernumerary 
 spermatozoa is prevented in normal monospermic fertilization. In 
 the case of echinoderm-eggs Fol advanced the view that this is 
 mechanically effected by means of the vitelline membrane formed 
 instantly after the first spermatozo5n touches the ^g^. This is indi- 
 cated by the following facts. Immature eggs, before the formation

of the polar bodies, have no power to form a vitelline membrane^ 
 and the spermatozoa always enter them in considerable numbers. 
 Polyspermy also takes place, as O. and R. Hertwig's beautiful ex- 
 periments showed ('87), in ripe eggs whose vitality has been dimin- 
 ished by the action of dilute poisons, such as nicotine, strychnine, 
 and morphine, or by subjection to an abnormally high temperature
