200 FERTILIZATION OF THE OVUM 

(31° C); and in these cases the vitelline membrane is only slowly 
 formed, so that several spermatozoa have time to enter.^ Similar 
 mechanical explanations have been given in various other cases. 
 Thus Hoffman believes that in teleosts the micropyle is blocked by 
 the polar bodies after the entrance of the first spermatozoon ; and 
 Calberla suggested {Petromyzon) that the same result might be 
 caused by the tail of the entering spermatozoon. It is, however, 
 far from certain whether such rude mechanical explanations are 
 adequate ; and there is considerable reason to believe that the egg 
 may possess a physiological power of exclusion called forth by the 
 first spermatozoon. Thus Driesch found that spermatozoa did not 
 enter fertilized sea-urchin eggs from which the membranes had been 
 removed by shaking.^ In some cases no membrane is formed (some 
 coelenterates), in others several spermatozoa are found inside the 
 membrane (nemertines), in others the spermatozoon may penetrate 
 the membrane at any point (mammals), yet monospermy is the rule. 

I. Immediate Residts of Union 

The union of the germ-cells calls forth profound changes in both. 

{a) The Spermatozoon. — Almost immediately after contact the tail 
 ceases its movements. In some cases the tail is left outside, being 
 carried away on the outer side of the vitelline membrane, and only 
 the head and middle-piece enter the Q,^g (echinoderms. Fig. 100). 
 In other cases the entire spermatozoon enters (amphibia, earthworm, 
 insects, etc.. Fig. 89), but the tail always degenerates within the 
 ovum and takes no part in fertilization. Within the ovum the 
 sperm-nucleus rapidly grows, and both its structure and staining- 
 capacity rapidly change {cf. p. 182). The most important and signifi- 
 cant result, however, is a7i immediate resumption by the sperm-nucleus 
 and sperm-centrosome of the power of division, which has hitherto 
 been suspended. This is not due to the union of the germ-nuclei ; 
 for, as the Hertwigs and others have shown, the supernumerary 
 sperm-nuclei in polyspermic eggs may divide freely without copu- 
 lation with the egg-nucleus, and they divide as freely after entering 
 enucleated egg-fragments. The stimulus to division must therefore 
 be given by the egg-cytoplasm. It is a very interesting fact that 
 in some cases the cytoplasm has this effect on the sperm-nucleus 

^ The Hertwigs attribute this to a diminished irritabihty on the part of the egg-substance. 
 Normally requiring the stimulus of only a single spermatozoon for the formation of the vitel- 
 line membrane, it here demands the more intense stimulus of two, three, or more before the 
 membrane is formed. That the membrane is not present before fertilization is admitted by 
 Hertwig on the ground stated at page 132. 

2 On the other hand, Morgan states ('95, 5, p. 270) that one or more spermatozoa will 
 enter nucleated or enucleated egg-fragments whether obtained before or after fertilization.
