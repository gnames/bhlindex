 but a short distance, and no further change occurs. 

{b) TJie Ovwn. — The entrance of the spermatozoon produces an 
 extraordinary effect on the Qgg, which extends to every part of its 
 organization. The rapid formation of the vitelline membrane, already 
 described, proves that the stimulus extends almost instantly through- 
 out the whole ovum.^ At the same time the physical consistency 
 of the cytoplasm may greatly alter, as for instance in echinoderm 
 eggs, where, as Morgan has observed, the cytoplasm assumes immedi- 
 ately after fertilization a peculiar 
 viscid character which it afterward 
 loses. In many cases the ^^^ con- 
 tracts, performs amoeboid movements, 
 or shows wave-like changes of form. 
 Again, the egg-cytoplasm may show 
 active streaming movements, as in 
 the formation of the entrance-cone in 
 echinoderms, or in the flow of periph- 
 eral protoplasm toward the region 
 of entrance to form the germinal 
 disc, as in many pelagic fish-eggs. 
 An interesting phenomenon is the 
 formation, behind the advancing 

sperm-nucleus, of a peculiar funnel- -ssesi.*- ^ ^ ^ 

shaped mass of deeply staining p^g ^^2. - Egg of the leech chpsine

described by Foot ( 94) m the earth- 
 worm, where it is very large and conspicuous, and I have since ob- 
 served it also in the sea-urchin (Fig. 94). 

The most profound change in the ovum is, however, the migration 
 of the germinal vesicle to the periphery and the formation of the 
 polar bodies. In many cases either or both these processes may occur 
 before contact with the spermatozoon (echinoderms, some vertebrates). 
 In others, however, the Q.^g awaits the entrance of the spermatozoon 
 (annelids, gasteropods, etc.), which gives it the necessary stimulus. 
 This is well illustrated by the o-gg of Nereis. In the newly dis- 
 charged Q.^^ the germinal vesicle occupies a central position, the 
 yolk, consisting of deutoplasm-spheres and oil-globules, is uniformly 
 distributed, and at the periphery of the ^gg is a zone of clear peri- 
 vitelline protoplasm (Fig. 60). Soon after entrance of the sperma- 

1 I have often observed that tlie formation of the membrane, in Toxopneiistes, proceeds 
 like a wave from the entrance-point around the periphery, but this is often irregular.
