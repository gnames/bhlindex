202 FERTILIZATION OF THE OVUM 

tozoon the germinal vesicle moves toward the periphery, its membrane 
 fades away, and a radially directed mitotic figure appears, by means 
 of which the first polar body is formed (Fig. 97). Meanwhile the 
 protoplasm flows toward the upper pole, the peri-vitelline zone disap- 
 pears, and the o.^^ now shows a sharply marked polar differentiation. 
 A remarkable phenomenon, described by Whitman in the leech i^7'^\ 
 and later by Foot in the earthworm ('94), is the formation of "polar 
 rings," a process which follows the entrance of the spermatozoon 
 and accompanies the formation of the polar bodies. These are two 
 ring-shaped cytoplasmic masses which form at the periphery of the 
 &^^ near either pole and advance thence toward the poles, the upper 
 one surrounding the point at which the polar bodies are formed 
 (Fig. 102). Their meaning is unknown, but Foot ('96) has made 
 the interesting discovery that they are probably of the same nature 
 as the yolk-nuclei (p. 156). 

2. Paths of the Germ-nuclei {Pro-n7iclei)^ 

After the entrance of the spermatozoon, both germ-nuclei move 
 through the egg-cytoplasm and finally meet one another. The paths 
 traversed by them vary widely in different forms. In general two 
 classes are to be distinguished, according as the polar bodies are 
 formed before or after entrance of the spermatozoon. In the former 
 case (echinoderms) the germ-nuclei unite at once. In the latter case 
 the sperm-nucleus advances a certain distance into the Qgg and then 
 pauses while the germinal vesicle moves toward the periphery, and 
 gives rise to the polar bodies {Ascaris, annelids, etc.). This signifi- 
 cant fact proves that the attractive force between the two nuclei is 
 only exerted after the formation of the polar bodies, and hence that 
 the entrance-path of the sperm-nucleus is not determined by such 
 attraction. A second important point, first pointed out by Roux, is 
 that the path of the sperm-nucleus is curved, its " entrance-path " 
 into the o-gg forming a considerable angle, with its "copulation-path" 
 toward the egg-nucleus. 

These facts are well illustrated in the sea-urchin egg (Fig. 103), 
 where the egg-nucleus occupies an eccentric position near the point 
 at which the polar bodies are formed (before fertilization). Entering 

1 The \.erms fe?)iale pro-jtucleus, male pro-nucletis (Van Beneden), are often applied 
 to the germ-nuclei before their union. These should, I think, be rejected in favour of 
 Hertwig's terms egg-nucletis and spenn-micleiis, on two grounds: (i) The germ-nuclei are 
 true nuclei in every sense, differing from the somatic nuclei only in the reduced number of 
 chromosomes. As the latter character has recently been shown to be true also of the 
 somatic nuclei in the sexual generation of plants (p. 275), it cannot be made the ground for 
 a special designation of the germ-nuclei. (2) The germ-nuclei are not male and female 
 in any proper sense (p. 243).
