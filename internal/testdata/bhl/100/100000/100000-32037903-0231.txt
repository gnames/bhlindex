In all the figures the original position of the egg-nucleus (reticulated) is shown at $ ; the point 
 at which the spermatozoon enters at E (entrance-cone). Arrows indicate the paths traversed by 
 the nuclei. At the meeting-point {M') the egg-nucleus is dotted. The cleavage-nucleus in its 
 final position is ruled in parallel lines, and through it is drawn the axis of the resulting cleavage- 
 figure. The axis of the egg is indicated by an arrow, the point of which is turned away from the 
 micromere-pole. Plane of first cleavage, passing near the entrance-point, shown by the curved

 nucleus, but toward a meeting-point where it comes in contact with 
 the es:g-nucleus. The latter does not begin to move until the
