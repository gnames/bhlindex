UNION OF THE GERM-CELLS 205 

cerned, a true fusion of the nuclei never takes place during fertili- 
 zation, and that the paternal and maternal chromatin m.ay remain 
 separate and distinct in the later stages of development â€” possibly 
 throughout life (p. 299). In this regard two general classes may be 
 distinguished. In one, exemplified by some echinoderms, by AinpJii- 
 oxus, PJiallitsia, and some other animals, the two nuclei meet each 
 other when in the reticular form, and apparently fuse in such a manner 
 that the chromatin of the resulting nucleus shows no visible distinc- 
 tion between the paternal and maternal moieties. In the other class, 
 which includes most accurately known cases, and is typically repre- 
 sented by Ascaris (Fig. 90) and other nematodes, by Cyclops (Fig. 98), 
 and by Pterotrachea (Fig. 93), the two nuclei do not fuse, but only 
 place themselves side by side, and in this position give rise each to 
 its own group of chromosomes. On general grounds we may confi- 
 dently maintain that the distinction between the two classes is only 
 apparent, and probably is due to corresponding differences in the rate 
 of development of the nuclei, or in the time that elapses before their 
 union. 1 If this time be very short, as in echinoderms, the nuclei 
 unite before the chromosomes are formed. If it be more prolonged, 
 as in Ascaris, the chromosome-formation takes place before union. 

With a few exceptions, which are of such a character as not to 
 militate against the rule, the number of cJiromosomes arising from the 
 germ-nuclei is always the same in both, and is one-Jialf the number 
 cJiaracteristic of the tissue-cells of the species. By their union, there- 
 fore, the germ-nuclei give rise to an equatorial plate contaijiing the 
 typical number of chromosomes. This remarkable discovery was first 
 made by Van Beneden in the case of Ascaris, where the number of 
 chromosomes derived from each sex is either one or two. It has 
 since been extended to a very large number of animals and plants, a 
 partial list of which follows. 

1 Indeed, Boveri has found that in Ascaris both modes occur, though the fusion of the 
 germ-nuclei is exceptional. (C/i p. 296.)
