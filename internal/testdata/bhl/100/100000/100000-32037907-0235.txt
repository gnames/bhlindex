The above data are drawn from sources so diverse and show so 
 remarkable a uniformity as to estabhsh the general law with a very- 
 high degree of probability. The few known exceptions are almost 
 certainly apparent only and are due to the occurrence of plurivalent 
 chromosomes. This is certainly the case with Ascan's (cf. p. Sy). 
 It is probably the case with the gasteropod Arion, where, as described 
 by Platner, the egg-nucleus gives rise to numerous chromosomes, the 
 sperm-nucleus to two only ; the latter are, however, plurivalent, for 
 Garnault showed that they break up into smaller chromatin-bodies, 
 and that the germ-nuclei are exactly alike at the time of union. We 
 may here briefly refer to remarkable recent observations by Riickert 
 and others, which seem to show that not only the paternal and mater- 
 nal chromatin, but also the chromosomes, may retain their individu- 
 ality throughout development.^ Van Beneden, the pioneer observer
