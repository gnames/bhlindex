2IO FERTILIZATION OF THE OVUM 

aster containing a pair of centrosomes, on the other hand that these, 
 Hke the egg-centrosomes, wholly disappear from view at a later period, 
 the cleavage-centrosomes having only a conjectural origin. 

The second of the views in question is that the cleavage-centro- 
 somes are derived from both germ-cells ; and this in turn has in its 
 favour the a priori evidence that in the Infusoria conjugation takes 
 place between two mitotic figures (p. 224). It appears in two forms, 
 of which the first, though undoubtedly erroneous, has had so interest- 
 ing a history as to deserve a brief review. It was predicted by Rabl 
 in 1889 that if the centrosome be a permanent cell-organ, the con- 
 jugation of germ-cells and germ-nuclei would be found to involve 
 also a conjugation of centrosomes. Unusual interest was therefore 
 aroused when Fol, in 1891, under the somewhat dramatic title of the 
 " Quadrille of Centres," described precisely such a conjugation of 
 centrosomes as Rabl had predicted. The results of this veteran 
 observer were very positively and specifically set forth, and were of 
 so logical and consistent a character as to command instant accept- 
 ance on the part of many authorities. In the eggs of the sea-urchin 
 the sperm-centrosome and egg-centrosome were asserted to divide 
 each into two, the daughter-centrosomes then conjugating two and 
 two, paternal with maternal, to form the cleavage-centrosomes. The 
 same result was announced by Guignard ('91) in the lily, by Conklin 
 ('93) in the gasteropod Crepidula, less definitely by Blanc ('93) in the 
 trout, and still later by Van der Stricht ('95) in Amphioxus. None 
 of these results have stood the test of later work. Fol's result was 
 opposed to the earlier conclusions of Boveri and Hertwig, and a careful 
 reexamination of the fertilization of the echinoderm &gg, indepen- 
 dently made in 1894-95 by Boveri {Echinus), by mysoYi {Toxopnetistes), 
 and Mathews {Arbacia, Asterias), and slightly later by Hill ('95) and 
 Reinke ('95) in SphczrecJumis, demonstrated its erroneous character. 
 Various attempts have been made to explain Fol's results as based on 
 double-fertilized eggs, on imperfect method, on a misinterpretation of 
 the double centrosomes of the cleavage-spindle, yet they still remain 
 an inexplicable anomaly of scientific literature. 

Serious doubt has also been thrown on Conkhn's conclusions by 
 subsequent research. Kostanecki and Wierzejski ('96) made a very 
 thorough study, by means of serial sections, of the fertilization of 
 the gasteropod PJiysa, and reached exactly the same result as that 
 obtained in the echinoderms. Here, also, the egg-centres degenerate, 
 their place being taken by a new pair, arising in intimate relation with 
 the middle-piece of the spermatozoon, about which forms a sperm- 
 amphiaster (Fig. 89). Conklin, after renewed research, himself 
 admitted that no quadrille occurs in Crepidtila, though he still believes 
 that a union of paternal and maternal attraction-spheres takes place.
