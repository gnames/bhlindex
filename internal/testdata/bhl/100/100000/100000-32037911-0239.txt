THE CENTROSOME IN FERTILIZATION 21 1 

Guignard's results, too, have entirely failed of confirmation by later 
 observers (p. 221), and in his own latest contribution to the subject 
 ('99) the centrosomes are conspicuous by their absence in both the 
 text and the figures. In like manner Van der Stricht's conclusions 
 have been shown by Sobotta ('97) to be without substantial founda- 
 tion, while Blanc's account, opposed to the earlier work of Bohm, is 
 too incomplete to carry any weight. The entire case for the " qua- 
 drille " has thus fallen to the ground. In its second form the supposed 
 double origin of the centrosomes rests upon a single research upon 
 Ascaris by Carnoy and Le Brun ('97, 2), who assert that the cleavage- 
 centrosomes arise de novo and separately, one inside of each of the 
 germ-nuclei, to migrate thence out into the cytoplasm. At the close 
 of mitosis they wholly disappear, to be replaced by a new pair, like- 
 wise of intranuclear origin. Since this result is totally opposed to 
 those of Van Beneden, Boveri, Erlanger, and Kostanecki and Sied- 
 lecki on the same object, and is contradicted in the most positive man- 
 ner by Fiirst,^ it may be received with some scepticism. The work of 
 Kostanecki and Siedlecki ('96) demonstrates the division of the sperm- 
 centrosome in Ascnris as described by Boveri ; and while it still 
 remains possible that the daughter-centrosomes may for a very brief 
 period disappear (as in some of the mollusks described beyond), no 
 ground is given for such a conclusion as Carnoy has drawn. No one 
 familiar with the object can repress the suspicion that Carnoy and 
 Le Brun have confused the centrosomes with the nucleoli ; but only 
 renewed research can determine the point. 

The ground is now clear for a closer study of Boveri's hypothesis 
 in the light of more recent research. It should first be pointed out 
 that that hypothesis is based upon and forms a part of the more gen- 
 eral theory of the autonomy of the centrosome ; and if the latter 
 theory cannot be sustained, the a priori side of Boveri's hypothesis 
 assumes a different aspect. In point of fact the general outcome of 
 recent research on fertilization has been on the whole unfavourable to 
 the view that the cleavage-centrosomes must necessarily be individu- 
 ally identical with permanent preexisting centrosomes â€” indeed, it is 
 in this very field that some of the most convincing evidence against 
 the persistence of the centrosome has been produced. The mode of 
 origin of the cleavage-centrosomes is nevertheless a question of high 
 interest on account of the unmistakable genetic relations existing 
 between the centrosome of the spermatid and sjDermatozoon and those 
 of the sperm-amphiaster within the ^g^. 

There are two points of capital importance to be determined before 
 a definite decision regarding the origin of the cleavage-centrosomes 
 can be reached. First, are the centrosomes of the sperm-aster within
