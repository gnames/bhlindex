THE CENTROSOME IN FERTILIZATION 21 Z 

though in substance it would still retain an element of truth, as pointed 
 out beyond. 

We may now examine the question whether the sperm-centrosomes 
 are actually identical with the cleavage-centrosomes. That such is 
 the case is positively maintained in the case of Ascaris by Boveri, 
 Kostanecki, and Erlanger, in PJiysa by Kostanecki and Wierzejski 
 ('96), in Thalassema by Griffin ('96, '99), and in CJicetopterns by Mead 
 ('95, '98). The two last-mentioned observers, who have followed 
 the phenomena with especial care, produce very strong evidence 
 that at no time do the sperm-centrosomes and asters disappear, and 
 that the former may be traced in unbroken continuity from the time 
 of their first appearance to the daughter-cells resulting from the first 
 cleavage (Figs. 99, 155). On the other hand, a considerable number 
 of observers, beginning with Viextwig (^Phyllirrhoe, PterotracJiea, '75), 
 have found that as the sperm-nucleus enlarges the sperm-asters di- 
 minish in size, until, in many cases, they nearly or quite disappear ; for 
 example, in /'wj'^//^(:^r^;/i-(Klinckowstrom, '97), in the mouse (Sobotta, 
 '95), in PlcuropJiyllidia (MacFarland, '97), PJiysa (Kostanecki and 
 Wierzejski, '96), Arenicola (Child, '97), Unio (Lillie, '97), Mycostoina 
 (Kostanecki, '98), and Cerebratiihis (Coe, '98).^ Several of these 
 observers (Klinckowstrom, MacFarland, Lillie, Child) have found that 
 not only the asters but also the centrosomcs totally disappear about 
 the time the germ-nuclei come together, a new pair of cleavage- 
 centrosomes and asters being afterward developed at the poles of 
 the united nuclei. These conclusions, if correct, place in a new 
 light the disappearance of the egg-centrosomes ; for this process 

1 Coe has pointed out that the eggs of various animals may be arranged in a series show- 
 ing successive graduations in the disappearance of the sperm-asters. " At the head of the 
 series we must place the eggs of Ascaris and Hfyzostoma (according to Kostanecki) and 
 similar ones in which the sperm-asters make their appearance only a short time before the 
 formation of the cleavage-spindle, and which, consequently, suffer no diminution in size. 
 Following these are the eggs of Cha:iopteriis (Mead) and Ophryotrocha (Korschelt) and 
 of some echinoderms in which the sperm-asters develop very early, but are not described 
 as decreasing in size before the formation of the cleavage-spindle. Then come the eggs of 
 Toxop7ieusies (Wilson) and Thalassema (Griffin), where the sperm-asters appear earlv and 
 develop to a very considerable size, but nevertheless become very much smaller and less 
 conspicuous after the germ-nuclei have come together. After these we must place the eggs 
 Qi Physa (Kostanecki and Wierzejski), for here the sperm-asters, after becoming very large 
 and conspicuous, degenerate to such an extent that only a very few e.xceedingly delicate 
 fibres remain. Those of Cerehratulus follow next. 

" Here the sperm-asters increase in size until they extend throughout the whole body 
 of the cell, but at the time of fusion of the germ-nuclei they degenerate completely. The 
 peripheral portions of their fibres, however, may be followed, as stated above of Pleuro- 
 phyllidia, Prosthecerccus, etc., where the sperm-asters degenerate soon after their forma- 
 tion, so that for a considerable period the egg is without trace of aster-fibres. Yet in all 
 of those cases where the sperm-asters disappear and their centrosomes become lost among 
 the other granules of the cell, we are justified in believing that the sperm-centrosomes 
 nevertheless retain their identity, and later reappear in the cleavage-asters" ('98, p. 455).
