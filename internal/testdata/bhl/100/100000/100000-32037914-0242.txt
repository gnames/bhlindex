214 FERTILIZATION OF THE OVUM 

would thus seem to be of the same nature as the disappearance of 
 the sperm-centrosomes, and both Boveri's theory of fertiHzation and 
 the general hypothesis of the permanence of the centrosomes would 
 receive a serious blow. 

The investigators to whom these observations are due have ranged 
 themselves in two groups in the interpretation of the phenomena. 
 On the one hand, Lillie and Child do not hesitate to maintain that 
 the centrosomes actually go out of existence as such, to be re-formed 
 like the asters out of the egg-substance ; and that such a new forma- 
 tion of centrosomes is possible seems to be conclusively shown by the 
 experiments of Morgan and Loeb described at pages 215 and 307. On 
 the other hand, Sobotta, MacFarland, Kostanecki, and Coe, relying 
 partly on the analogy of other forms, partly on the occasional pres- 
 ence of the centrosomes during the critical stage, urge that the dis- 
 appearance of the sperm-centrosomes is only apparent, and is due to 
 the disappearance of the asters, which renders difficult or impossible 
 the identification of the centrosomes among the other protoplasmic 
 granules of the o.g'g. These authors accordingly still uphold Boveri's 
 theory. 

It is difficult to sift the evidence at present, for it has now become 
 very important to reexamine, in the light of these facts, those cases 
 in which the absolute continuity of the centrosome has been main- 
 tained — for example, in Ascaris, Chcetoptertis, and Thalassenia — in 
 order to determine whether there may not be here also a brief critical 
 period in which the centrosomes disappear. There are, however, 
 some facts which tend to sustain the conclusion that even though the 
 sperm-centrosomes disappear from view, there is some kind of genetic 
 continuity between them and the cleavage-centrosomes. First, both 
 Kostanecki and Wierzejski ('96) and Coe ('98) have found that there 
 is some variation in eggs apparently equally well preserved, a few 
 individuals showing the sperm-centrosomes at the poles of the united 
 nuclei at the same period when they are invisible in other individuals. 
 Second, both these observers, Coe most clearly, have shown that the 
 egg-centrosomes disappear considerably earlier than the sperm-cen- 
 trosomes, and Coe has traced the sperm-centrosomes continuously to 
 the exact points {the poles of the imited nuclei) at which the cleavage- 
 centrosomes afterivard appear {Yig. 155). This important observation 
 leads to the suspicion that the apparent disappearance of the centro- 
 somes may be due to a loss of staining-capacity at the critical period, 
 or that even though the formed centrosome disappears its substance 
 reappears in its successor. Here again we come to the view sug- 
 gested at page 1 1 1, that the centrosome may be regarded as the vehicle 
 of a specific chemical substance which is transported to the nuclear 
 poles by its division, and may there persist even though the body of the
