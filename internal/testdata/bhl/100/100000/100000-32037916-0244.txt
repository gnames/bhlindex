FERTILIZATION OF THE OVUM 

our knowledge of it is rather incomplete. It is, however, sufficient 
 to show that the essential fact is everywhere a union of two germ- 
 nuclei — a process agreeing fundamentally with that observed in 
 animals. On the other hand, almost nothing is known regarding the 
 centrosome and the archoplasmic or kinoplasmic structures; and 
 most recent observations point to the conclusion that in the lowering 
 plants and pteridophytes no centrosomes are concerned in fertilization. 
 Many early observers from the time of Pringsheim ('55) onward 
 described a conjugation of cells in the lower plants, but the union of 
 germ-nuclei, as far as I can find, was first clearly made out in the 
 flowering plants by Strasburger in 1877-78, and carefully described 
 by him in 1884. Schmitz observed a union of the nuclei of the

conjugating cells of Spirogyra in 1879, and made similar observations 
 on other algae in 1884. Among other forms in which the same 
 phenomenon has been described may be mentioned Gidigoniimt 
 (Klebahn, '92), Vaiicheria (Oltmanns, '95), Cystop7is (Wager, '96), 
 SphcErotheca z.x\di ErysipJie {Yi^x^^x, '96), Fiiciis {Y^axTdox and Williams, 
 '96, Strasburger, '97), Basidiobolus (Fairchild, '97), Pilularia (Fig. 
 105, Campbell, '88), Onoclea (Shaw, '98, 2), Zamia (Webber, '97, 2), 
 and Lilium (Guignard, '91, Mottier, '97), Ginkgo (Hirase, '97).^ In 
 all of these forms and many others fertilization is effected by the 
 union of a single paternal and a single maternal uninucleated cell, 
 such as occurs throughout the animal kingdom. There are, however, 
 some apparently well-determined exceptions to this rule occurring 
 in the " compound " multinucleate oospheres of some of the lower
