plants. In Albugo bliti (one of the Peronosporeae), for example, as 
 shown by the recent work of Stevens ('99), the mature ovum contains 
 about a hundred nuclei, and is fertilized by a multinucleate proto- 
 plasmic mass derived from the antheridium, each nucleus of the latter 
 conjugating with one of the egg-nuclei. But although the conjugat- 
 ing bodies are here multinucleate, the germ-nuclei conjugate two and 
 two (as is also the case in the multinucleate cysts of ActinosphcBrmjn, 
 p. 279) ; and the case therefore forms no real exception to the 
 general rule that one paternal nucleus unites with one maternal.

Whether a union of more than two germ-nuclei occurs in any of the 
 lower plants is a question still disputed by botanists. ^ Such plural 
 fusion is rendered a priori improbable by the observations thus far 
 made upon the one-celled forms both in plants and in animals ; and 
 the known facts are sufficient to show that it must be, to say the 
 least, an exceptional process. 

In cases where the paternal germ-cell is a ciliated spermatozoid, as 
 in Fiicus, Pilnlaria, and the ferns and cycads, the germ-nuclei differ
