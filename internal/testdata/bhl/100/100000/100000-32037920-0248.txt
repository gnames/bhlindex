FERTILIZATION OF THE OVUM 

thus effects fertilization (Fig. 107). The other conjugates zvith one of 
 the polar nuclei (usually the upper), which then unites with the other 
 polar nucleus {cf. p. 264). By division of the fertilized o.^^ arises the 
 embryo ; while by division of the compound nucleus resulting from the 

fusion of the polar nuclei 
 and the second sperm nu- 
 cleus are formed the endo- 
 sperm-cells, which serve 
 for the nourishment of the 
 embryo. This remarkable 
 double copulation within 
 the embryo-sac is without 
 a parallel and is of wholly 
 problematical meaning, but 
 in no way contradicts the 
 general rule regarding the 
 union of two germ-nuclei 
 to produce the embryo.^ 

1 As in the case of animals (p. 
 176), the germ-nuclei of phanero- 
 gams also show marked differ- 
 ences in structure and staining-reac- 
 tion before their union, though they 
 ultimately become exactly equiva- 
 lent. Thus, according to Rosen 
 ('92, p. 443), on treatment by 
 fuchsin-methyl-blue the male germ- 
 nucleus is " cyanophilous," the 
 female " erythrophilous," as de- 
 scribed by Auerbach in animals. 
 Strasburger, while confirming this 
 observation in some cases, finds the 
 reaction to be inconstant, though 
 the germ-nuclei usually show marked 
 differences in their staining-capac- 
 ity. These are ascribed by Stras- 
 burger ('92, '94) to differences in 
 the conditions of nutrition ; by 
 Zacharias and Schwarz to corre- 
 sponding differences in chemical 
 composition, the male nucleus being 
 in general richer in nuclein, and the 
 female nucleus poorer. This dis- 
 tinction disappears during fertiliza- 
 tion, and Strasburger has observed, in the case of gymnosperms (after treatment with a 
 mixture of fuchsin-iodine-green), that the paternal nucleus, which is at first "cyanophil- 
 ous," becomes " erythrophilous," hke the egg-nucleus before the pollen-tube has reached 
 the egg. Within the egg both stain exactly alike. These facts indicate, as Strasburger 
 insists, that the differences between the germ-nuclei of plants are, as in animals, of a 
 temporary and non-essential character.
