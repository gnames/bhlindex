222 FERTILIZATION OF THE OVUM 

Stance is contained not in the nucleus but in the cytoplasm â€” more 
 specifically, in the case of spermatozoids, in the cilia-bearing body 
 derived from the blepharoplast, which in its development so strongly 
 suggests a centrosome (p. 172). Webber's and Ikeno's observations 
 on the cycads are not necessarily fatal to this view; for, as I have 
 shown (p. 188), the middle-piece in the echinoderm is likewise cast 
 off and degenerates near the periphery of the &gg, and the centro- 
 some is a body far more minute. The possibility has been admitted 
 that this centrosome may be formed de novo under the influence of 
 the middle-piece, which itself perishes. In like manner it may also 
 be possible that the primary stimulus in Zaniia and like cases is given 
 by the cilia-bearing body, even though this body itself disappears and 
 the mitotic apparatus is not formed until long afterward. 

E. Conjugation in Unicellular Forms 

The conjugation of unicellular organisms possesses a peculiar inter- 
 est, since it is undoubtedly a prototype of the union of germ-cells 
 in the multicellular forms. Biitschli and Minot long ago maintained 
 that cell-divisions tend to run in cycles, each of which begins and 
 ends with an act of conjugation. In the higher forms the cells pro- 
 duced in each cycle cohere to form the multicellular body ; in the 
 unicellular forms the cells separate as distinct individuals, but those 
 belonging to one cycle are collectively comparable with the multi- 
 cellular body. The validity of this comparison, in a morphological 
 sense, is generally admitted.^ No process of conjugation, it is true, is 
 known to occur in many unicellular and in some multicellular forms, 
 and the cyclical character of cell-division still remains sub judice? 
 It is none the less certain that a key to the fertilization of higher 
 forms must be sought in the conjugation of unicellular organisms. 

The difficulties of observation are, however, so great that we are 
 as yet acquainted with only the outlines of the process, and have still 
 no very clear idea of its finer details or its physiological meaning. 
 The phenomena have been most closely followed in the Infusoria by 
 Biitschli, Engelmann, Maupas, and Richard Hertwig, though many 
 valuable observations on the conjugation of unicellular plants have 
 been made by De Bary, Schmitz, Klebahn, and Overton. All these 
 observers have reached the same general result as that attained 
 through study of the fertilization of the &g^ ; namely, that an essen- 
 tial phenomenon of conjugation is a union of the n?iclei of the conju- 
 gating cells. Among the unicellular plants both the cell-bodies and 
 the nuclei completely fuse. Among animals this may occur ; but in
