many of the Infusoria union of the cell-bodies is only temporary, and 
 the conjugation consists of a mutual exchange and fusion of nuclei. 
 It is impossible within the limits of this work to attempt more than a 
 sketch of the process in a few forms. 

We may first consider the conjugation of Infusoria. Maupas's 
 beautiful observations have shown that in this group the life-history

of the species runs in cycles, a long period of multiplication by cell- 
 division being succeeded by an " epidemic of conjugation," which 
 inaugurates a new cycle, and is obviously comparable in its physio- 
 logical aspect with the period of sexual maturity in the Metazoa. If 
 conjugation does not occur, the race rapidly degenerates and dies out ; 
 and Maupas believes himself justified in the conclusion that conju-
