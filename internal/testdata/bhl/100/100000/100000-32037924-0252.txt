224 FERTILIZATION OF THE OVUM 

gation counteracts the tendency to senile degeneration and causes 
 rejuvenescence, as maintained by Biitschli and Minot.^ 

In Stylonychia pustiilata, which Maupas followed continuously from the end of 
 February until July, the first conjugation occurred on April 29th, after 128 bi-parti- 
 tions ; and the epidemic reached its height three weeks later, after 175 bi-partitions. 
 The descendants of individuals prevented from conjugation died out through " senile 
 degeneracy," after 316 bi-partitions. Similar facts were observed in many other 
 forms. The degeneracy is manifested by a very marlced reduction in size, a partial 
 atrophy of the cilia, and especially by a more or less complete degradation of the 
 miclear apparatus. In Stylonychia pusttdata and Onychodronms grandis this process 
 especially affects the micronucleus, which atrophies, and finally disappears, though 
 the animals still actively swim, and for a time divide. Later, the macronucleus 
 becomes irregular, and sometimes breaks up into smaller bodies. In other cases, 
 the degeneration first affects the macronucleus, which may lose its chromatin, 
 undergo fatty degeneration, and may finally disappear altogether (^Stylonychia 
 ?nytilus), after which the micronucleus soon degenerates more or less completely, 
 and the race dies. It is a very significant fact that toward the end of the cycle, as 
 the nuclei degenerate, the animals become incapable of taking food and of growth ; 
 and it is probable, as Maupas points out, that the degeneration of the cytoplasmic 
 organs is due to disturbances in nutrition caused by the degeneration of the nucleus. 

The more essential phenomena occurring during conjugation are 
 as follows. The Infusoria possess two kinds of nuclei, a large 
 maa^omicleus and one or more small micToiiitclei. During conjuga- 
 tion the macronucleus degenerates and disappears, and the micronu- 
 cleus alone is concerned in the essential part of the process. The 
 latter divides several times, one of the products, the germ-micletis, 
 conjugating with a corresponding germ-nucleus from the other indi- 
 vidual, while the others degenerate as "corpuscules de rebut." The 
 dual nucleus thus formed, which corresponds with the cleavage- 
 nucleus of the ovum, then gives rise by division to both macronuclei 
 and micronuclei of the offspring of the conjugating animals (Fig. 109). 

These facts may be illustrated by the conjugation of ParamoEciiim 
 cmidatum, which possesses a single macronucleus and micronucleus, 
 and in which conjugation is temporary and fertilization mutual. The 
 two animals become united by their ventral sides and the macronu- 
 cleus of each begins to degenerate, while the micronucleus divides 
 twice to form four spindle-shaped bodies (Fig. no. A, B). Three of 
 these degenerate, forming the "corpuscules de rebut," which play 
 no further part. The fourth divides into two, one of which, the 
 "female pronucleus," remains in the body, while the other, or "male 
 pronucleus," passes into the other animal and fuses with the female 
 pronucleus (Fig. no, C-H). Each animal now contains a cleavage- 
 nucleus equally derived from both the conjugating animals, and the 
 latter soon separate. The cleavage-nucleus in each divides three
