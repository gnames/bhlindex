times successively, and of the eight resulting bodies four become 
 macronuclei and four micronuclei (Fig. no, H-K). By two suc- 
 ceeding fissions the four macronuclei are then distributed, one to each 
 of the four resulting individuals. In some other species the micro- 
 nuclei are equally distributed in like manner, but in P. catidatiim the 
 process is more complicated, since three of them degenerate, and 
 the fourth divides twice to produce four new micronuclei. In either 
 case at the close of the process each of the conjugating individuals

 A. Attachment of the small free-swimming microgamete to the large fixed macrogamete; 
 micronucleus dividing in each (Carchesmm). B. Microgamete containing eight micronuclei; 
 macrogamete four {Vortkella). C. All but one of the micronuclei have degenerated as polar 
 bodies or " corpuscules de rebut." D. Each of the micronuclei of the last stage has divided into 
 two to form the germ-nuclei; two of these, one from each gamete, have conjugated to form the 
 cleavage-nucleus seen at the left ; the other two, at the right, are degenerating. 

has given rise to four descendants, each containing a macronucleus 
 and micronucleus derived from the cleavage-nucleus. From this time 
 forward fission follows fission in the usual manner, both nuclei divid- 
 ing at each fission, until, after many generations, conjugation recurs. 
 Essentially similar facts have been observed by Richard Hertwig 
 and Maupas in a large number of forms. In cases of permanent 
 conjugation, as in Vorticella, where a smaller microgamete unites with 
 a larger macrogamete , the process is essentially the same, though the 
 details are still more complex. Here the germ-nucleus derived from 
 each gamete is in the macrogamete one-fourth and in the microgamete
