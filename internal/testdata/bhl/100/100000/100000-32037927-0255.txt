CONJUGATION IN UNICEILULAR FORMS

one-eighth of the original micronucleus (Fig. iii). Each germ- 
 nucleus divides into two, as usual, but one of the products of each 
 degenerates, and the two remaining pronuclei conjugate to form a 
 cleavage-nucleus. 

The facts just described show a very close parallel to those observed 
 in the maturation and fertilization of the Q^^. In both cases there 
 is a union of two similar nuclei to form a cleavage-nucleus or its 
 equivalent, equally derived from both gametes, and this is the pro- 
 genitor of all the nuclei of the daughter-cells arising by subsequent 
 divisions. In both cases, moreover (if we confine the comparison 
 to the ^Z^^ the original nucleus does not conjugate with its fellow 
 until it has by division produced a number of other nuclei all but 
 one of which degenerate. Maupas does not hesitate to compare

these degenerating nuclei or "corpuscules de rebut" with the polar 
 bodies (p. 181), and it is a remarkable coincidence that their number, 
 like that of the polar bodies, is often three, though this is not always 
 the case. 

A remarkable peculiarity in the conjugation of the Infusoria 
 is the fact that tJie gerin-7i?iclei unite iv/icu in the form of spindles 
 or mitotic figures. These spindles consist of achromatic fibres, or 
 " archoplasm," and chromosomes, but no asters or undoubted cen- 
 trosomes have been thus far seen in them. During union the 
 spindles join side by side (Fig. no, G), and this gives good reason 
 to believe that the chromatin of the two gametes is equally distrib- 
 uted to the daughter-nuclei as in Metazoa. In the conjugation of 
 some other Protozoa the nuclei unite while in the resting state; but 
 very little is known of the process save in the cystoflagellate Nocti- 
 luca, which has been studied with some care by Cienkowsky and 
 Ishikawa (Fig. 112). Here the conjugating animals completely fuse, 
 but the nuclei are merely apposed and give rise each to one-half of
