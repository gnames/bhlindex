 origin of which remains undetermined. 

It is an interesting fact that in Noctihica, in the gregarines, and 
 probably in some other Protozoa, conjugation is followed by a very 
 rapid multiplication of the nucleus followed, by a corresponding divi- 
 sion of the cell-body to form " spores," which remain for a time 
 closely aggregated before their liberation. The resemblance of this

The conjugation of unicellular plants shows some interesting 
 features. Here the conjugating cells completely fuse to form a 
 "zygospore" (Figs. 113, 140), which as a rule becomes surrounded 
 by a thick membrane, and, unlike the animal conjugate, may long 
 remain in a quiescent state before division. Not only do the nuclei
