unite, but in many cases the plastids also (chromatophores). In 
 Spirogyra some interesting variations in this regard have been ob- 
 served. In some species De Bary has observed that the long band- 
 shaped chromatophores unite end to end so that in the zygote the 
 paternal and maternal chromatophores lie at opposite ends. In 
 5. Weberi, on the other hand, Overton has found that the single 
 maternal chromatophore breaks in two in the middle and the paternal 
 chromatophore is interpolated between the two halves, so as to lie 
 in the middle of the zygote (Fig. 113). It follows from this, as De 
 Vries has pointed out, that the origin of the chromatophores in the 
 daughter-cells differs in the two species, for in the former case one 
 receives a maternal, the other a paternal, chromatophore, while in 
 the latter, the chromatophore of each daughter-cell is equally derived 
 from those of the two gametes. The final result is, however, the 
 same ; for, in both cases, the chromatophore of the zygote divides 
 in the middle at each ensuing division. In the first case, therefore, 
 the maternal chromatophore passes into one, the paternal into the 
 other, of the daughter-cells. In the second case the same result is 
 effected by two succeeding divisions, the two middle-cells of the four- 
 celled band receiving paternal, the two end-cells maternal, chro- 
 matophores. In the case of a Spirogyra filament having a single 
 chromatophore it is therefore "wholly immaterial whether the indi- 
 vidual cells receive the chlorophyll-band from the father or the 
 mother" (De Vries).^ 

F. Summary and Conclusion 

All forms of fertihzation involve a conjugation of cells by a 
 process that is the exact converse of cell-division. In the lowest 
 forms, such as the unicellular algas, the conjugating cells are, in a 
 morphological sense, precisely equivalent, and conjugation takes 
 place between corresponding elements, nucleus uniting with nucleus, 
 cell-body with cell-body, and even, in some cases, plastid with plastid. 
 Whether this is true of the centrosomes is not known, but in the 
 Infusoria there is a conjugation of the achromatic spindles which 
 certainly points to a union of the centrosomes or their equivalents. 
 As we rise in the scale, the conjugating cells diverge more and more, 
 until in the higher plants and animals they differ widely not only 
 in form and size, but also in their internal structure, and to such an 
 extent that they are no longer equivalent either morphologically or 
 physiologically. Both in animals and in plants the paternal germ- 

^ De Vries's conclusion is, however, not entirely certain; for it is impossible to deter- 
 mine, save by analogy, whether the chromatophores maintain their individuahty in the 
 zygote.
