230 FERTILIZATION OF THE OVUM 

cell loses most of its cytoplasm, the main bulk of which, and hence 
 the main body of the embryo, is now supplied by the ^gg ; and 
 in the higher plants, the egg alone retains the plastids which 
 are thus supplied by the mother alone. On the other hand, the 
 paternal germ-cell is the carrier of something which incites the ^g^ 
 to development, and thus constitutes the fertilizing element in the 
 narrower sense. There is strong ground for the conclusion that in 
 the animal spermatozoon this element is, if not an actual centro- 
 some, a body or a substance directly derived from a centrosome of 
 the parent body and contained in the middle-piece. Boveri's theory, 
 according to which fertilization consists essentially of the replace- 
 ment of a missing or degenerating egg-centrosome by the importation 
 of a sperm-centrosome, was stated in too simple and mechanical a 
 form ; for the facts of spermatogenesis show conclusively that the 
 spermatid-centrosome is not simply handed on unmodified by the 
 spermatozoon to the o^g^, and the theory wholly breaks down in 
 the case of the higher plants. But although the theory probably 
 cannot be sustained in its morphological form, it may still contain 
 a large element of truth when recast in physiological terms. Like 
 mitosis, fertilization is perhaps at bottom a chemical process, the 
 stimulus to development being given by a specific chemical substance 
 carried in some cases by an individualized centrosome or one of its 
 morphological products, in other cases by less definitely formed 
 material. In the case of animals, we cannot ignore the historical 
 continuity shown in the origin of the spermatid-centrosomes, the 
 formation of the middle-piece, and the origin of the sperm-centro- 
 somes and sperm-amphiaster in the &gg, even though we do not 
 yet know whether the sperm-centrosome is as such imported into 
 the ^gg. And this chain of phenomena suggests that even in the 
 higher plants, where no centrosomes seem to occur, the fertilizing 
 substance, even if brought into the Q.gg in an unformed state, may 
 still be genetically related to the mitotic apparatus of the preceding 
 division.^ 

Through the differentiation between the paternal and germ-cells 
 in the higher forms indicated above, their original morphological 
 equivalence is lost and only the nuclei remain of exactly the same 
 value. This is shown by their history in fertilization, each giving 
 rise to the same number of chromosomes exactly similar in form, 
 size, and staining-reactions, equally distributed by cleavage to the 
 daughter-cells, and probably to all the cells of the body. We thus 
 find the essential fact of fertilization and sexual reproduction to be a 
 union of equivalent nuclei ; attd to this all other processes are tributary.
