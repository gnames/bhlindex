OOGENESIS AND SPERMATOGENESIS. REDUCTION OF THE 
 CHROMOSOMES 

" Es kommt also in der Generationenreihe der Keimzelle irgendwo zu einer Reduktion 
 der urspriinglich vorhandenen Chromosomenzahl auf die Halfte, und diese Zak/en-rednk- 
 tion ist demnach nicht etwa nur ein theoretisches Postulat, sondern eine Thatsache."

Van Beneden's epoch-making discovery that the nuclei of the con- 
 jugating germ-cells contain each one-half the number of chromosomes 
 characteristic of the body-cells has now been extended to so many 
 plants and animals that it may probably be regarded as a universal 
 law of development. The process by which the reduction in number 
 is effected, forms the most essential part of the phenomena of matura- 
 tion by which the germ-cells are prepared for their union. No phe- 
 nomena of cell-life possess a higher theoretical interest than these. 
 For, on the one hand, nowhere in the history of the cell do we find so 
 unmistakable and striking an adaptation of means to ends or one of 
 so marked a prophetic character, since maturation looks not to the 
 present but to the future of the germ-cells. On the other hand, the 
 chromatin-reduction suggests questions relating to the morphological 
 constitution of nucleus and chromatin, which have an important 
 bearing on all theories of the ultimate structure of living matter and 
 now stand in the foreground of scientific discussion among the most 
 debatable and interesting of biological problems. 

Two fundamentally different views have been held of the manner 
 in which the reduction is effected. The earlier and simpler view, 
 which was suggested by Van Beneden and adopted in the earlier 
 works of Weismann, Boveri, and others, assumed an actual degenera- 
 tion or casting out of half of the chromosomes during the growth 
 of the germ-cells â€” a simple and easily intelligible process. Later 
 researches conclusively showed, however, that this view cannot be 
 sustained, and that reduction is effected by a rearrattgement and redis- 
 tribution of the nnclear snbstaiicc without loss of any of its essential 
 constituents. It is true that a large amount of chromatin is lost dur- 
 ing the growth of the egg.^ It is nevertheless certain that this loss is 
 not directly connected with the process of reduction ; for, as Hertwig
