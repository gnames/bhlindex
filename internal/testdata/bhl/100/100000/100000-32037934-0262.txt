REDUCTION OF THE CHROMOSOMES 

and others have shown, no such loss occurs during spermatogenesis, 
 and even in the oogenesis the evidence is clear that an explanation 
 must be sought in another direction. The attempts to find such an 
 explanation have led to some of the most interesting researches of 
 modern cytology ; and though only partially successful, they have 
 raised many new questions which promise to give in the end a deeper 
 insight into some of the fundamental questions of cell-morphology. 
 For this reason they deserve careful consideration, despite the fact 
 that taken as a whole the subject still remains an unsolved riddle in 
 the face of which we can only return again and again to Boveri's 
 remark that whatever be its theoretical interpretation the numerical 
 reduction of the chromosomes is itself not a theory but a fact.

A. General Outline 

The general phenomena of maturation fall under two heads : viz. 
 oogenesis, which includes the formation and maturation of the ovum, 
 and spermatogenesis, comprising the corresponding phenomena in case 
 of the spermatozoon. Recent research has shown that maturation 
 conforms to the same type in both sexes, which show as close a paral- 
 lel in this regard as in the later history of the germ-nuclei. Stated in 
 the most general terms, this parallel is as follows : ^ In both sexes the 
 final reduction in the number of chromosomes is effected in the course 
 of the last two cell-divisions, or viaturatioji-divisions, by which the 
 definitive germ-cells arise, each of the four cells thus formed having 
 but half the usual number of chromosomes. In the female but one
