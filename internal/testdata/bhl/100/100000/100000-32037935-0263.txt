of the four cells forms the " ovum " proper, while the other three, 
 known as the polaj' bodies, are minute, rudimentary, and incapable of 
 development (Figs. 89, 97, 114). In the male, on the other hand, all 
 four of the cells become functional spermatozoa. This difference 
 between the two sexes is probably due to the physiological division of 
 labour between the germ-cells, the spermatozoa being motile and very 
 small, while the Qgg contains a large amount of protoplasm and yolk, 
 out of which the main mass of the embryonic body is formed. In the 
 male, therefore, all of the four cells may become functional ; in the 
 female the functions of development have become restricted to but one

of the four, while the others have become rudimentary (cf. p. 124). 
 The polar bodies are therefore not only rudimentary cells (Giard, '76), 
 but may further be regarded as abortive eggs — a view first put forward 
 by Mark in 1881, and ultimately adopted by nearly all investigators.^ 
 The evidence is steadily accumulating that reduction is accomplished 
 by two maturation-divisions throughout the animal kingdom, even in 
 the unicellular forms ; though in certain Infusoria an additional divi- 
 sion occurs, while in some other Protozoa only one maturation-division 
 has thus far been made out. Among plants, also, two maturation- 

1 A beautiful confirmation of this view is given by Francottes's ('97) observations on a 
 turbellarian, Prostliecerccus. The first polar body is here often abnormally large, all grada- 
 tions having been observed from the normal size up to cells nearly as large as the egg itself. 
 Siicli polar bodies are occasionally fertilized ?i\\^ develop into small gastrulas, first forming a 
 single polar body like the second polar body of the egg. Here, therefore, two of the four 
 cells are exceptionally capable of development. It may be added that Fol long ago observed 
 the penetration of the small polar bodies by spermatozoa in the echinoderms; and this has 
 been more recently observed by Kostanecki in mollusks.
