236 REDUCTION OF THE CHROMOSOMES 

divisions occur in all the higher forms (Muscineae, pteridophytes, and 
 phanerogams), and in some, at least, of the lower ones. Here, how- 
 ever, the phenomena are complicated by the fact that the two divi- 
 sions do not as a rule give rise directly to the four sexual germ-cells, 
 but to four asexual spores which undergo additional divisions before 
 the definitive germ-cells are produced. In the flowering plants there 
 are only a few such divisions, which give rise to structures within the 
 pollen-tube or embryo-sac. In the archegoniate cryptogams, on the 
 other hand, each spore gives rise, by repeated divisions, to a " sexual 
 generation " (prothallium, etc.) that intervenes between the process 
 of reduction and that of fertilization. The following account deals 
 primarily with reduction in animals, the plants being afterward con- 
 sidered. 

I . Reduction in the Female. Formation of the Polar Bodies 

As described in Chapter III., the Qgg arises by the division of cells 
 descended from the primordial egg-cells of the maternal organism, 
 and these may be differentiated from the somatic cells at a very early 
 period, sometimes even in the cleavage-stages. As development pro- 
 ceeds, each primordial cell gives rise, by division of the usual mitotic 
 type, to a number of descendants known as oogonia (Fig. 1 15), which 
 are the immediate predecessors of the ovarian Q,gg. At a certain 
 period these cease to divide. Each of them then grows to form an 
 ovarian ^gg, its nucleus enlarging to form the germinal vesicle, its 
 cytoplasm becoming more or less laden with food-matters (yolk or 
 deutoplasm), while egg-membranes may be formed around it. The 
 ovum may now be termed the oocyte (Boveri) or ovarian ^gg. 

In this condition the egg-cell remains until near the time of fertili- 
 zation, when the process of maturation proper — i.e. the formation of 
 the polar bodies — takes place. In some cases, e.g. in the sea-urchin, 
 the polar bodies are formed before fertilization, while the Qgg is still 
 in the ovary. More commonly, as in annelids, gasteropods, nema- 
 todes, they are not formed until after the spermatozoon has made 
 its entrance ; while in a few cases one polar body may be formed 
 before fertilization and one afterward, as in the lamprey-eel, the frog, 
 and AmpJdoxits?- In all these cases the essential phenomena are the 
 same. Two minute cells are formed, one after the other, near the 
 upper or animal pole of the ovum (Figs. 97, 1 16); and in many cases 
 the first of these divides into two as the second is formed (Fig. 89). 

A group of four cells thus arises, namely, the mature Q.gg, which 
 gives rise to the embryo, and three small cells or polar bodies which 
 take no part in the further development, are discarded, and soon die
