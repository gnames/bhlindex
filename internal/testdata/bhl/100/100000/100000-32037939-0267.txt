eight somatic chromosomes — the highest number thus far accurately 
 counted. As the first polar body forms, each of the tetrads is halved 
 to form two double groups, or dyads, one of which remains in the Q.g^

 A. The egg with the spermatozoon just entering at <S ; the germinal vesicle contains two rod- 
 shaped tetrads (only one clearly shown), the number of chromosomes in earlier divisions having 
 been four. B. The tetrads seen in profile. C. The same in end view. D. First spindle forming 
 (in this case inside the germinal vesicle). E. First polar spindle. F. The tetrads dividing. 
 G. First polar body formed, containing, like the egg, two dyads. H. I. The dyads rotating into 
 position for the second division, y. The dyads dividing. K. Each dyad has divided into two 
 single chromosomes, completing the reduction. (For later stages see Fig. 90.)
