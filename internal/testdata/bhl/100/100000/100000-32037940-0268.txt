REDUCTION OF THE CHROMOSOMES 

while the other passes into the polar body. Both the egg and the 
 first polar body therefore receive each a number of dyads equal to 
 one-half the usual number of chromosomes. The egg now proceeds 
 at once to the formation of the second polar body without previous 
 reconstruction of the nucleus. Each dyad is halved to form two 
 single chromosomes, one of which, again, remains in the egg while 
 its sister passes into the polar body. Both the Q,gg and the second 
 polar body accordingly receive two single chromosomes (one-half the 
 usual number), each of which is one-fourth of an original tetrad 
 group. From the two remaining in the q^^ a reticular nucleus, much 
 smaller than the original germinal vesicle, is now formed.^

Essentially similar facts have now been determined in a consider- 
 able number of animals, though, as we shall presently see, tetrad- 
 formation is not of universal occurrence, nor is it always of the same 
 type. For the moment we need only point out that the numerical 
 reduction of Q\ixoTi\2X\n-inasses takes place before the polar bodies 
 are actually formed, through processes which determine the number 
 of tetrads within the germinal vesicle. The numerical reduction is 
 therefore determined in the grandmother-cell of the ^gg. The actual 
 divisions by which the polar bodies are formed merely distribute the 
 elements of the tetrads. 

^ It is nearly certain that the division of the first polar body (which, however, may be 
 omitted) is analogous to that by which the second is formed, i.e. each of the dyads is 
 similarly halved. Cf. Griffin, '99.
