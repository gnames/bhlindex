2. Reduction in the Male. Spermatogenesis 

The researches of Platner ('89), Boveri, and especially of Oscar 
 Hertwig ('90, i) have demonstrated that reduction takes place in the 
 male in a manner almost precisely parallel to that occurring in the 
 female. Platner first suggested ('89) that the formation of the polar 
 bodies is directly comparable to the last two divisions of the sperm 
 mother-cells (spermatocytes). In the following year Boveri reached 
 the same result in Ascaris, stating his conclusion that reduction in 
 the male must take place in the " grandmother-cell of the sperma- 
 tozoon, just as in the female it takes place in the grandmother-cell 
 of the ^Zg,'' and that the egg-formation and sperm-formation really 
 agree down to the smallest detail ('90, p. 64). Later in the same 
 year appeared Oscar Hertwig's splendid work on the spermato- 
 genesis of Ascaris, which established this conclusion in the most 
 striking manner. Like the ova, the spermatozoa are descended from 
 primordial germ-cells which by mitotic division give rise to the 
 spermatogonia from which the spermatozoa are ultimately formed 
 (Fig. 118). Like the oogonia, the spermatogonia continue for a time 
 to divide with the usual (somatic) number of chromosomes, i.e. four 
 in Ascaris megalocepJiala bivalens. Ceasing for a time to divide, they 
 now enlarge considerably to form spermatocytes, each of which is 
 morphologically equivalent to an unripe ovarian ovum, or oocyte. 
 Each spermatocyte finally divides twice in rapid succession, giving 
 rise first to two daughter-spermatocytes and then to four spermatids, 
 each of which is directly converted into a single spermatozoon. The 
 history of the chromatin in these tzvo divisions is exactly parallel to 
 that in the formation of the polar bodies (Figs. 119, 120). From the 
 chromatin of the spermatocyte are formed a number of tetrads equal 
 to one-half the usual number of chromosomes. Each tetrad is halved 
 at the first division to form two dyads which pass into the respective 
 daughter-spermatocytes. At the ensuing division, which occurs with- 
 out the previous formation of a resting reticular nucleus, each dyad 
 is halved to form two single chromosomes which enter the respec- 
 tive spermatids (ultimately spermatozoa). From each spermatocyte, 
 therefore, arise four spermatozoa, and each sperm-nucleus receives 
 half the usual number of single chromosomes. The parallel with the 
 egg-reduction is complete. 

These facts leave no doubt that the spermatocyte is the morpho- 
 logical equivalent of the oocyte or immature ovarian Q,gg, and that 
 the group of four spermatozoa to which it gives rise is equivalent 
 to the ripe ^gg plus the three polar bodies. Hertwig was thus led to 
 the following beautifully clear and simple conclusion: "The polar 
 bodies are abortive eggs which are formed by a final process of
