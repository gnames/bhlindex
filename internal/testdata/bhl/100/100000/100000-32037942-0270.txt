division from the egg-mother-cell (oocyte) in the same manner as the 
 spermatozoa are formed from the sperm-mother-cell (spermatocyte). 
 But while in the latter case the products of the division are all used 
 as functional spermatozoa, in the former case one of the products

A. B. Division of one of the spermatogonia, showing the full number (four) of chromosomes. 
 C. Primary spermatocyte preparing for division; the chromatin forms two tetrads. D. E. F. First 
 division to form two secondary spermatocytes each of which receives two dyads. G. H. Division 
 of the two secondary spermatocytes to form four spermatids. Each of the latter receives two 
 single chromosomes and a centrosome which passes into the middle-piece of the spermatozoon.

 rudimentary form as the polar bodies." ^
