ORIGIN OF THE TETRADS

usual number of pieces. Apparently, however, there are two radi- 
 cally different types of tetrad-formation as follows. 

In the first type the tetrad arises by one longitudinal and one trans- 
 verse division of each primary chromatin-rod, the latter effecting the 
 reduction demanded by 

Weismann's hypothesis(Fig. 
 121, I). To give the usual 
 graphic representation, let 
 us, for the sake of discus- 
 sion, assume the somatic 
 number of chromosomes to 
 be four, designating the 
 spireme-thread as a b c d, J 
 each letter representing a 
 chromosome, each of which 
 we may in turn assume to 
 consist of a series of four 
 granules or "ids "(Fig. 121). 
 In ordinary mitosis the spi- 
 reme would segment into 
 a — b — c — d, which then 
 would divide lengthwise to 
 form pairs of identical sister

chromosomes

To form the tetrad, on the 
 other hand, the spireme first 
 segments into two rods ab 
 and cd, each of which, in 
 view of its subsequent his- 
 tory, may be regarded as 
 bivalent, representing two 
 chromosomes united end to 
 end (Vom Rath, Riickert, 
 Hacker). Each of 
 divides once longitudinally,

Inspection of Fig. 121, I, shows that through the second or transverse 
 division, each member of the tetrad receives only half the number of 
 ids contained in the original segment. This number, four, is the same 
 as that assumed for a single chromosome ; and, since each of the two 
 tetrads contributes one chromosome to the g-erm-cell, the latter receives
