248 REDUCTION OF THE CHROMOSOMES 

but half the usual number both of chromosomes and of ids. This mode 
 of tetrad-formation has been most clearly demonstrated in insects 
 and copepods, and an equivalent process occurs also in mollusks, 
 annelids, turbellarians, and some other animals, as described beyond. 
 In the second type, illustrated especially by Ascaris, the tetrad is 
 apparently formed by two longitudinal diznsions of each primary 
 chromatin-rod, and no reducing division occurs. If, therefore, we 
 adopt the same terminology as before, we have first ab and cd, then

this case, according to Brauer's careful studies, each chromatin-granule 
 (" id") divides at each longitudinal division of the primary rod. The 
 four chromosomes of the tetrad are therefore exactly equivalent, being 
 derived from the same region of the spireme-thread, and containing 
 the undiminished number of " ids " (Fig. 121, II). 

The contradiction may be stated in a different way. In the first 
 type of tetrad formation, the number both of granules and of chro- 
 mosomes is first doubled {i.e. in the assumed case, through the forma- 
 tion of two tetrads, each consisting of four chromosomes, or eight in 
 all), and then reduced to half that number by the two successive matu- 
 ration-divisions. In the second type, on the other hand, the number 
 of chromosomes is likewise doubled, but that of the granules is qnad- 
 rupled, so that, although in both types the two maturation-divisions 
 reduce the number of chromosomes to one-half, only in the first type 
 do they reduce the number of granules or "ids," as Weismann's 
 hypothesis demands. We must therefore distinguish sharply between 
 the reduction of the chromosomes and that of the "ids." The former 
 is primarily effected by the segmentation of the primary spireme- 
 thread, or the resolution of the nuclear reticulum, into one-half the 
 usual number of segments (z>. the "pseudo-reduction" of Riickert); 
 and here the real secret of the reduction of the chromosomes lies. The 
 reduction of the "ids," if they have any real existence, is a distinct, 
 and as yet unsolved, question.
