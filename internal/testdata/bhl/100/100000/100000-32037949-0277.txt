in copepods by Riickert, Hacker, and Vom Rath, in pteridophytes by 
 Calkins and Osterhout, in the onion, Alliinn, by Ishikawa, and in 
 various other forms where their history has been less clearly made 
 out. The genesis of the ring was first determined by Vom Rath in 
 the mole cncktt {Giyllotalpa, '92), and has been thoroughly elucidated 
 by the later work of Riickert ('94), Hacker ('95, i), and Paulmier 
 ('99). All these observers have reached the same conclusion ; 
 namely, that the ring arises by the longitudinal splitting of a primary 
 chromatin-rod, the two halves remaining united by their ends, and 
 opening out to form a ring. The ring-formation is, in fact, a form of

heterotypical mitosis (p. 86). The breaking of the ring into four 
 parts involves, first, the separation of these two halves (corresponding 
 with the original longitudinal split), and second, the transverse division 
 of each half, the latter being the reducing division of Weismann. 
 The number of primary rods, from which the rings arise, is one-half 
 the somatic number. Hence each of them is conceived by Vom Rath, 
 Hacker, and Riickert as bivalent or double ; i.e. as representing two 
 chromosomes united end to end. This appears with the greatest 
 clearness in the spermatogenesis of GryUotalpa (Fig. 122). Here
