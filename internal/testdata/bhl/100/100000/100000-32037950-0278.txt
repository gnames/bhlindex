REDUCTION OF THE CHROMOSOMES 

the spireme-thread splits lengthwise before its segmentation into rods. 
 It then divides transversely to form six double rods (half the usual 
 number of chromosomes), which open out to form six closed rings. 
 These become small and thick, break each into four parts, and thus

A. Germinal vesicle containing eight longitudinally split chromatin-rods (half the somatic 
 number). B. Shortening of the rods; transverse division (to form the tetrads) in progress. 
 C. Position of the tetrads in the first polar spindle, the longitudinal split horizontal. D. Ana- 
 phase ; longitudinal divisions of the tetrads. E. The first polar body formed; second polar 
 spindle with the eight dyads in position for the ensuing division, which will be a transverse or 
 reducing division. 

give rise to six typical tetrads. An essentially similar account of the 
 ring-formation is given by Vom Rath in Eiichceta and Calanns, and 
 by Riickert in Heterocope and Diaptomus. 

That the foregoing interpretation of the rings is correct, is beauti- 
 fully demonstrated by the observations of Hacker, and especially of
