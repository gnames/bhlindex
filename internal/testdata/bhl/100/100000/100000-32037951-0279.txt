Ruckert, on a number of other copepods {Cyclops, Canthocamptiis), 
 in which rings are not formed, since the splitting of the primary 
 chromatin-rods is comple,te. The origin of the tetrads has here been 
 traced with especial care in Cyclops strennus, by Ruckert ('94), whose 
 observations, confirmed by Hacker, are quite as convincing as those

 sult, the typical tetrads ; b. c. intermediate stages : at the left the ring-formation (as in Diaptcmus, 
 Gryllotalpa, Heterocope) ; middle series, complete splitting of the rods (as in Cyclops according to 
 Ruckert, and in Canthocamptiis) ; at the right by breaking of the V-shaped rods (as in Cyclops

of Brauer on Ascaris, though they led to a diametrically opposite 
 result. 

The normal number of chromosomes is here twenty-two. In the 
 germinal vesicle arise eleven threads, which split lengthwise (Fig. 123), 
 and finally shorten to form double rods, manifestly equivalent to the 
 closed rings of Diaptomus. Each of these now segments transversely
