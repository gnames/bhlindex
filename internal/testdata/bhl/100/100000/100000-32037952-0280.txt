to form a tetrad group, and the eleven tetrads then place themselves 
 in the equator of the spindle for the first polar body (Fig. 123, 6"), in 
 such a manner that the longitudinal split is transverse to the axis of 
 the spindle. As the polar body is formed, the longitudinal halves 
 of the tetrad separate, and the formation of the first polar body is 
 thus demonstrated to be an " equal division " in Weismann's sense.

so that the transverse division lies in the equatorial plane, and are 
 halved during the formation of the second polar body. The division 
 is accordingly a "reducing division," which leaves eleven single chro- 
 mosomes in the tgg. Paulmier's work on A?iasa and other Hemip- 
 tera ('99) gives the same result as the above in regard to the origin 
 of the tetrads (Figs. 126, 127). The process is, however, slightly 
 complicated by the fact that no continuous spireme-thread is formed, 
 while the rings are often bent or twisted and never open out to a
