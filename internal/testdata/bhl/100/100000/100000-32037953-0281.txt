ORIGIN OF THE TETRADS 253 

circular form. They finally condense into true tetrads which are 
 successively divided into dyads and monads by the two divisions ; 
 but it is an interesting fact that the order of division occurring in the 
 copepods appears here to be reversed, the first division being the 
 transverse and the second the longitudinal one — a result agreeing 
 with Henking's earlier conclusion in the case of PyrrocJwris. Oster- 
 hout ('97) and Calkins ('97) independently discovered tetrads in the 
 vascular cryptogams {Equisetum, Pteris), and the last-named observer 
 finds that in Pteris they may arise either from rings, as in Gryllotalpa 
 or Heterocope, or from double rods as in Cyclops, the halves in the 
 latter case being either parallel or forming a cross. This longitu- 
 dinal split, occurring in the spireme, is followed by a transverse 
 division by which the tetrad is formed. Tetrads having an essentially 
 similar mode of origin are also described by Atkinson ('99) in Ari- 
 scBma, and tetrad-formation is nearly approached in Allium according 
 to Ishikawa ('99).-^ These cases are considered at page 263. 

Resume. In all the foregoing cases the tetrads arise from a spi- 
 reme which splits lengthwise, segments into one-half the somatic 
 number of rods (each longitudinally divided) and each of the latter 
 divides transversely to form the tetrad. When the ends of the 
 daughter-chromosomes resulting from the longitudinal split remain 
 united (as in insects) ring-forms result, and the earlier phases of tetrad- 
 formation are thus identical with those of heterotypical mitosis. 
 When the split is complete, so that the ends remain free, double 
 rods result ; while, if the daughter-chromosomes remain temporarily 
 united at the middle or at the end, X-, Y-, and V-shaped figures may 
 arise. In all these forms tetrad-formation is completed by the com- 
 plete separation of the daughter-rods, the transverse division of 
 each in the middle, and the condensation of the four resulting bodies 
 into a quadruple mass. As will be shown in Section C (p. 258) 
 the transverse division is in many forms delayed until after sepa- 
 ration of the longitudinal halves. In such cases no actual tetrads 
 are formed, though the result is the same. 

{b) Second Type. Tetrad-formation with two Longitudinal Divi- 
 sions. — The only accurately known case of this type is Ascaris, the 
 object in which tetrads were first discovered by Van Beneden in 
 1883. Carnoy ('86, 2) reached the conclusion that the tetrads in 
 some other nematodes {Op/iiostomum, Ascaris clavata, A. lunibricoides') 
 arose by a double longitudinal splitting of the primary chromatin-rods. 

1 Vom Rath ('93, '59) has endeavoured to show that a process involving the formation of 
 true tetrads occurs in the salamander and the frog, but the later and more accurate studies 
 of Meves ('96) seem to leave little doubt that this was an error, and that the tetrads observeci 
 in these forms are not of normal occurrence, as Flemming ('87) had earlier concluded.
