REDUCTION OF THE CHROMOSOMES 

In the first of his classical cell-studies Boveri i^'i'j, i) reached the 
 same result through a careful study of Ascaris megalocepJiala, showing 
 that each tetrad appears in the germinal vesicle in the form of four 
 parallel rods, each consisting of a row of chromatin-granules (Fig. 117, 
 A—C\ He believed these rods to arise by the double longitudinal 
 splitting of a single primary chromatin-rod, each cleavage being a

preparation for one of the polar bodies. In his opinion, therefore, 
 the formation of the polar bodies differs from ordinary mitosis only 
 in the fact that the chromosomes split very early, and not once, but 
 twice, in preparation for two rapidly succeeding divisions without an 
 intervening resting period. He supported this view by further obser- 
 vations in 1890 on the polar bodies of Sagitta and several gastero- 
 pods, in which he again determined, as he believed, that the tetrads
