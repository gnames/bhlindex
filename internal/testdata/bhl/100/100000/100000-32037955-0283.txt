arose by double longitudinal splitting. An essentially similar view 
 of the tetrads was taken by Hertwig in 1890, in the spermatogenesis 
 of Ascaris, though he could not support this conclusion by very con- 
 vincing evidence. In 1893, finally, Brauer made a most thorough 
 and apparently exhaustive study of their origin in the spermatogene- 
 sis of Ascaris, which seemed to leave no doubt of the correctness of 
 Boveri's result. Every step in the origin of the tetrads from the retic- 
 ulum of the resting spermatocytes was traced with the most pains- 
 taking care. In the early prophases of the first division the nuclear 
 reticulum breaks up more or less completely into granules, which

become in part aggregated in a mass at one side of the nucleus 
 ("synapsis," p. 276), from which delicate threads extend through the 
 remaining nuclear space (Fig. 120, A). Even at this period the 
 granules of the threads are divided into four parts. As the process 
 proceeds the chromatin resolves itself into a single spireme-thread, 
 consisting of four parallel rows of granules, which break in two to 
 form the two tetrads (var. bivalcns), or is directly converted into a 
 single tetrad (var. iinivalens^ (Fig- 120). From these observations 
 Brauer concludes that each tetrad arises from a rod, doubly split 
 lengthwise by a process initiated at a very early period through the
