ORIGIN OF THE TETRADS 257 

{c) The Formation of Tetrads by Conjugation. — A considerable 
 number of observers have maintained that reduction may be effected 
 by the union or conjugation of chromosomes that were previously 
 separate. This view agrees in principle with that of Riickert, 
 Hacker, and Vom Rath ; for the bivalent chromosomes assumed by 
 these authors may be conceived as two conjugated chromosomes. It 
 seems to be confirmed by the observations of Born and Fick on 
 Amphibia and those of Riickert on selachians {Pristiurus); for in all 
 these cases the number of chromatin-masses at the time the first 
 polar body is formed is but half the number obsen^ed in younger 
 stages of the germinal vesicle. In PristinriLS there are at first thirty- 
 six double segments in the germinal vesicle. At a later period these 
 give rise to a close spireme, which then becomes more open, and is 
 found to form a double thread segmented into eighteen double seg-" 
 ments ; i.e. the reduced number. In this case, therefore, the prelimi- 
 nary pseudo-reduction is almost certainly effected by the union of 
 the original thirty-six double chromosomes, two by two. The most 
 specific accounts of such a mode of origin have, however, been given 
 by Calkins (earthworm) and Wilcox (grasshopper). The latter 
 author asserts ('95) that in Caloptemis the spireme of the first sperma- 
 tocyte gives rise without longitudinal division to twenty-four chromo- 
 somes (double the somatic number). These then become associated 
 in pairs, and still later the twelve pairs conjugate two and two to form 
 six tetrads. There is, therefore, no longitudinal splitting of the chro- 
 mosomes. The a priori improbability of such a conclusion is in- 
 creased by the studies of Paulmier on the Hemiptera, which demon- 
 strate the occurrence of a longitudinal division in a number of these 
 forms and confirm the original studies of Vom Rath on Gryllotalpa?- 

The second case, which is perhaps better founded, is that of the 
 earthworm {Luinbricns terrcstris), as described by Calkins ('95, 2), 
 whose work was done under my own direction. Calkins finds that 
 the spireme splits longitudinally and then divides transverselv 
 into 32 double segments. These then unite, two by two, to form 
 16 tetrads. The 32 primary double segments therefore represent 
 chromosomes of the normal number that have split longitudinally,

Such 

a tetrad, therefore, agrees as to its composition with the formulas 
 of Hacker, Vom Rath, and Riickert, and agrees in mode of origin 
 with the process described by Riickert in the eggs of Pristiunis.
