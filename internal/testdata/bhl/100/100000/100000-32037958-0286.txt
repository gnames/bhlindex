258 REDUCTION OF THE CHROMOSOMES 

theless rest on strong evidence, and they do not stand in actual con- 
 tradiction of what is known in the copepods and vertebrates. The 
 possibility of such a mode of origin in other forms must, I think, be 
 held open. 

Under the same category must be placed Korschelt's unique 
 results in the egg-reduction of the annelid OpJiryotrocha ('95), which 
 are very difScult to reconcile with anything known in other forms. 
 The typical somatic number of chromosomes is here four. The same 
 nmnber of chromosomes appear in the germinal vesicle (Fig. 125, D). 
 They are at first single, then double by a longitudinal split, but after- 
 ward single again by a reunion of the halves. The four chromo- 
 somes group themselves in a single tetrad, two passing into the first 
 polar body, while two remain in the Q^gg, but meanwhile each of them 
 ' again splits into two. Of the four chromosomes thus left in the Q.gg 
 two are passed out into the second polar body, while the two remain- 
 ing in the Q,gg give rise to the germ-nucleus. From this it follows 
 that the formation of the first polar body is a reducing division â€” a 
 result which agrees with the earlier conclusions of Henking on 
 Pyrrochoris, and with those of Paulmier on the Hemiptera. 

C. Reduction without Tetrad-formation 

As already stated (p. 246), the formation of actual tetrads is of 
 relatively rare occurrence, being thus far certainly known only in the 
 arthropods, nematodes, and sOme annelids. In the greater number of 
 cases the two divisions of the primary chromatin-masses {i.e. of the 
 primary oocyte or spermatocyte) are separated by a considerable inter- 
 val, during which the first maturation cell-division takes place or is ini- 
 tiated, and hence no actual tetrads are formed. This obviously differs 
 only in degree from tetrad-formation, the latter occurring only when 
 the two divisions are simultaneous or occur in rapid succession. 

In the cases now to be considered the length of the pause between 
 the maturation-divisions varies considerably, and in some forms (verte- 
 brates, flowering plants) it is so prolonged that the nucleus is partially 
 reconstructed. In all, or nearly all, these cases the first matiLration- 
 division is of the Jieterotypical form, the chromosomes having the form 
 of rings and arising by a process that agrees in most of its features 
 with that leading to tetrad-formation. There is here, however, exactly 
 the same contradiction of results as in the case of tetrad-formation 
 described at page 247, and a bewildering confusion of the subject still 
 exists. In brief, it may be stated that most observers of reduction of 
 this type in the lower animals (flat-worms, annelids, mollusks) have 
 found one transverse and one longitudinal division ; most of those
