who have studied the vertebrates find two longitudinal divisions ;

{a) Animals. — In the gephyrean Thalassenia and the mollusk 
 Zirphcea (Figs. 128-130) Griffin ('99) finds that the rings, arising as 
 described above, place themselves in the equator of the spindle with 
 the longitudinal division in the equatorial plane. They are then 
 drawn out toward the spindle-poles from the middle point, first 
 assuming the form of a double cross, then of elongated ellipses, and 
 finally break into two daughter-U's or -Vs. The first division is 
 therefore longitudinal. During the late anaphase the V's break at 
 the apex, the two limbs come close together, so as to give the decep-

 second division (following immediately upon the first without inter- 
 vening resting stage). The latter is therefore a transverse division 
 (Fig. 130). An essentially similar result, though less completely 
 worked out, is independently reached by Bolles Lee ('97) in Helix ; 
 by Klinckowstrom ('97) in the turbellarian Prost/iccercEi/s ; and by 
 Francotte ('97) and Van der Stricht ('98, i) in Thysanzoon. Klinckow- 
 strom shows that there is much variation in the way in which the 
 rings open out and break apart, though the result is the same in all. 
 In case of the vertebrates, Flemming {"^y^ long since described 
 and figured typical tetrads in the salamander, but regarded them as 
 "anomalies." Vom Rath's later conclusion ('93, '95) that they are
