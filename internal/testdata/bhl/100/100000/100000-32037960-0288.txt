normal tetrads has not been sustained by the still more recent work 
 of Meves ('96), whose careful studies, together with those of Moore, 
 Lenhossek, and others, thus far give no evidence of tetrad-formation, 
 and seem opposed to the occurrence of reducing divisions in the 
 vertebrates. Meves's work in the main confirms the earlier results 
 of Flemming, except that he shows that, as in so many other animals, 
 only two generations of spermatocytes exist. At the first division 
 the nuclear reticulum resolves itself into twelve (the reduced num- 
 ber) segments, which split lengthwise, the halves remaining united to 
 form elongated rings (Figs. 27, 37). These do not, however, con-

dense into tetrads, but break apart during the first division at the 
 points corresponding with the ends of the united halves. The first 
 division is therefore an equation-division. As the V-shaped halves sep- 
 arate they again split lengthwise (Fig. 131), each of the secondary sper- 
 matocytes receiving twelve double V's or dyads. In the telophases 
 and ensuing resting stage, however, all traces of this splitting are 
 lost, the nuclei partially returning to the resting stage, but retaining 
 traces of a spireme-like arrangement (Fig. 131). In the second 
 division twelve double V's reappear, showing a longitudinal division 
 which Flemming and Meves believe to be directly related to that
