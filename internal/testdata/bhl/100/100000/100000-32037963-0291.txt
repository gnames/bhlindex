REDUCTION WITHOUT TETRAD-FORMATION 263 

pause following the first division ; and he believes this to be the 
 same division as that seen during the anaphase. Carnoy and Le Brun 
 ('99) reach the same result in the formation of the polar bodies in 
 Triton, though their general account of the heterotypical mitosis 
 differs very considerably from that of other authors, the rings being 
 stated to arise by a double instead of a single longitudinal spHt. 
 These observers describe the rings of the early anaphase as having 
 almost exactly the same double cross-form as those in TJialasse^na or 
 Zirph(Ba (Griffin, '99), but believe them to arise in a manner nearly 
 in accordance with Strasburger's abandoned view of 1895,^ and with 
 Guignard's ('98, 2) and Gregoire's ('99) latest results on the flowering 
 plants, the ring being stated to arise by a double longitudinal split- 
 ting, as explained at page 265. 

In the elasmobranch Scyllmni Moore ('95) finds twelve (the re- 
 duced number) ring-shaped chromosomes at the first division. These 
 closely resemble tetrads ; but a resting stage follows, and the second 
 division is likewise stated to be of the heterotypical form. Both divi- 
 sions are stated to be equation-divisions — a conclusion well sup- 
 ported in case of the first, but so far from clear in the second that a 
 careful reexamination of the matter is highly desirable. 

In mammals the first division is of the heterotypical form (Her- 
 mann, '89, Lenhossek, '98), though the rings are much smaller than 
 m the salamander, recalling those seen in arthropods. No true 
 tetrads are, however, formed, and the two divisions are separated by 
 a resting period. The character of the second division is undeter- 
 mined, though Lenhossek believes it to be heterotypical, like the first. 

{b^ Plants. — It is in the flowering plants, where reduction likewise 
 occurs, as a rule, without true tetrad-formation, that the contradiction 
 of results reaches its climax ; and it must be said that until further 
 research clears up the present confusion no definite result can be 
 stated. The earlier work of Strasburger and Guignard indicated that 
 no reducing division occurred, the numerical reduction being directly 
 effected by a segmentation of the spireme-thread into half the somatic 
 number of chromosomes. Thus these observers found in the male 
 that the chromosomes suddenly appeared in the reduced number 
 (twelve in the Uly, eight in the onion) at the first division of the 
 pollen-mother-cell, and in the female at the first division of the 
 mother-cell of the embryo-sac. The subsequent phenomena differ 
 in a very interesting way from those in animals, owing to the fact 
 that the two maturation-divisions are followed in the female by one 
 and in the male by two or more additional divisions, in both of which 
 the reduced number of chromosomes persists. In the male the two 
 maturation-divisions give rise to four pollen-grains, in the female to
