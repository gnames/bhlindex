the four primary cells of the embryo-sac (Fig. 132); and these two 
 divisions undoubtedly correspond to the two maturation-divisions in 
 animals. In the female, as in the animals, only one of the four 
 resulting cells gives rise to the ^gg, the other three corresponding to 
 the polar bodies in the animal Q.gg, though they here continue to 
 divide, and thus form a rudimentary prothallium.^ The first-men-

 cells) just after the first division {Lillum). B. Final anaphase of second division {Podophylhini). 

C. Resulting telophase, which by division of the cytoplasmic mass produces four pollen-grains. 

D. Embryo-sac after completion of the first nuclear division {Filhem). E. The same after the 
 second division. F. The upper four cells resulting from the third division {cf. Fig. io6) : o, ovum ;

1 Of these three cells one divides to form the " synergidse," the other two divide to form 
 three " antipodal cells " (which like the synergidte finally degenerate) and a " lower polar 
 cell." The latter sooner or later conjugates with the " upper polar cell " (the sister-cell of 
 the egg) to form the " secondary embryo-sac-nucleus," by the division of which the endo- 
 sperm-cells arise. Of the whole group of eight cells thus arising only the egg contributes
