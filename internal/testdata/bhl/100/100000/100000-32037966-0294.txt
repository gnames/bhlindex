REDUCTION OF THE CHROMOSOMES 

essentially in agreement with the facts described in Ascaris, and 
 involves no reduction-division. Essentially the same result is reached 
 by Guignard ('98) in his latest paper on Naias, and by Gregoire ('99) 
 in the Liliacese. 

Strasburger twice shifted ground in rapid succession. First ('97, 2), 
 with Mottier ('97, i), he somewhat doubtfully adopted a view agreeing

essentially with the interpretation of Vom Rath, Riickert, etc. (p. 247). 
 The primary rods split once, and bend into a V, the branches of 
 which often come close together, and may be twisted on themselves, 
 thus giving the appearance of the second longitudinal split described 
 in Strasburger's paper of 1895. The two halves of the split U then 
 separate, opening out from the apex, to form the -figure. In the
