REDUCTION WITHOUT TETRAD-FORMATION 267 

second division the limbs of the daughter-V's again come close 
 together, remaining, however, united at one end, where they were 
 believed finally to break apart during the second division. The latter 
 was, therefore, regarded as a true reduction-division, the apparent 
 longitudinal split being merely the plane along which the halves of 
 the V come into contact (Fig. 134, C, D). 

The two accounts just given represent two extremes, the first 
 agreeing essentially with Ascaris, the second with the copepods or 
 insects. When we compare them with others, we encounter a truly 
 bewildering confusion. Strasburger and Mottier ('97) themselves 
 soon abandoned their acceptance of the reducing division, returning 
 to the conclusion that in both sexes {Liliimi, Podophyllimi) both divi- 
 sions involve a longitudinal splitting of the chromosomes (Figs. 133, 
 134). In the first division the longitudinally split spireme segments 
 into twelve double rods, which bend at the middle to form double V's, 
 with closely approximated halves. Becoming attached to the spindle 
 by the apex, the limbs of each separate to form a -figure. At 
 telophase the daughter-V's shorten, thicken, and join together to form 
 a daughter-spireme consisting of a single contorted thread. TJiis 
 splits lengtJnvise tJLro2iglLOJLt its whole extent, and then segments into 
 double chromosomes, the halves of which separate at the second 
 division (Fig. 135, L-M). The latter, therefore, Hke the first, 
 involves no reducing division. This result agrees in substance with 
 the slightly earlier work of Dixon ('96) and of Miss Sargant ('96, 
 '97), whose account of the origin of the -figure of the first division 
 differs, however, in some interesting details. It is also in harmony 
 with the general results of Farmer and Moore ('95), of Gregoire ('99), 
 and of Guignard ('98), who, however, describes the first division nearly 
 in accordance with Strasburger's account of 1895, as stated above. 
 On the other hand, Ishikawa (pollen-mother-cells of Alliuni, '97) and 
 especially Belajeff (pollen-mother-cells of Iris, 98) conclude that the 
 second division is a true transverse or reducing division. ^ Ishikawa 
 described the first division as being nearly similar to the ring-forma- 
 tion in copepods, the four elements of the ring being often so 
 condensed as nearly to resemble an actual tetrad. In the early ana- 
 phases the daughter-V's break at the apex ; and, although in the later 
 anaphases the limbs reunite, Ishikawa is inclined to regard the trans- 
 verse division as being a preparation for the second mitosis. Bela- 
 jeff's earlier work ('94) on Liliuui gave an indecisive result, though 
 one on the whole favourable to a reducing division. In his latest 
 paper, however ('98, i), Belajeff takes more positive ground, stating 
 that after the examination of a large number of forms he has found 

^ Schaffner ('97, 2) reaches exactly the reverse result in Lilium philaJelphiciim, i.e. the 
 first division is transverse, the second longitudinal.
