REDUCTION OF THE CHROMOSOMES 

in the pollen-mother-cells of Iris a much more favourable object of 
 investigation than Lilium, Fritillaria, and the other forms on which 
 most of the work thus far has been done, and one in which the sec- 
 ond division takes place with "admirable clearness"; he also gives 
 interesting additional details of the iirst division in this and other 
 forms. In the first division the spireme splits lengthwise, and then 
 breaks into chromosomes, which assume the shape of a V, Y, or X 
 (Fig. 135, N-Q). The two limbs of these bodies do not, as might be 

flowering plants.

supposed, represent sister-chromosomes (resulting from the longitu- 
 dinal division of the spireme) attached by one end or at the middle, 
 since each X, Y, or V is double, consisting of two similar superim- 
 posed halves. Belajeff, therefore, regards these figures as longitu- 
 dinally divided bivalent chromosomes, having the value of tetrads, 
 each limb being a longitudinally split single chromosome. The 
 double V's, Y's, and X's take up a position with the apex (or one end 
 of the X) attached to the spindle, and the longitudinal division in the 
 equatorial plane. The halves then progressively diverge from the
