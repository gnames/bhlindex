A-D. Vegetative mitoses (heterotypical form) in Picea. [Belajeff.] 

E-I. Illustrate Strasburger's earlier account ('95) and the later one of Guignard, of the first 
 maturation-division. E. Doubly split rod. F. Metaphase, in profile. G. The same en face, 
 showing the heterotype ring. H. I. Opening out and breaking apart of the ring. 

y-M. Later account of Strasburger and Mottier {cf. Figs. 133, 134). y. Longitudinally split, 
 V-shaped chromosome of first division. K. Opening out of the ring. L. Prophase of second 
 division, showing longitudinally split segmented spireme. M. Initial anaphase of second division. 

N-Q. First division. [Belajeff.] N. Longitudinally split chromosomes, viewed in the equa- 
 torial plane. O. The same viewed in the axis of the spindle. P, Separation of the daughter- 
 chromosomes. Q. Anaphase, all the chromosomes assuming the V-form. 

R- T. Second division in Iris. [BELAJEFF.] R. Equatorial plate, limbs of X's and V's break-
