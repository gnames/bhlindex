nection with the reduction-problem ; and some of these have raised 
 some remarkable questions regarding the origin of reduction. A 
 large number of observers are now agreed that during the growth- 
 period preceding the maturation-division (p. 236), in both sexes, the 
 nucleus of the mother-cell (spermatogonium, oogonium), both in 
 plants and in animals, passes through some of the changes prepara- 
 tory to reduction at a very early period. Thus, in the Qg^ the pri- 
 mary chromatin-rods are often present in the very young ovarian 
 eggs, and from their first appearance are already split longitudinally.^ 
 Hacker ('92, 2) made the interesting discovery that in some of the 
 copepods {CanthocamptiLS, Cyclops) these double rods could be traced

back continuously to a double spireme-thread, following immediately 
 upon the division of the last generation of oogonia, and that at no 
 period is a tme reticnhiDi formed in the germinal vesicle (Fig. 136). 
 In the following year Ruckert('93, 2) made a precisely similar discov- 
 ery in the case of selachians. After division of the last generation 
 of oogonia the daughter-chromosomes do not give rise to a reticu- 
 lum, but split lengthwise, and persist in this condition throughout 
 the entire growth-period of the &g%. Riickert therefore concluded 
 that the germinal vesicle of the selachians is to be regarded as a 
 " daughter-spireme of the oogonium {Ur-ei) grown to enormous 
 dimensions, the chromosomes of which are doubled and arranged in
