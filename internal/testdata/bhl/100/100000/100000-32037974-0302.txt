2/4 REDUCTION OF THE CHROMOSOMES 

pairs." -^ In this case their number seems to be at first the somatic 
 number (thirty-six), which is afterward halved by conjugation of the 
 elements two and two (Ruckert), as in Lmnbricus (Calkins). It is, 
 however, certain that in many cases (insects, copepods) the double 
 rods first appear in the reduced number, and the observations of Vom 
 Rath ('93) and Hacker ('95, 3) give some reason to believe that the 
 reduced number may in some forms be present in the earlier progeni- 
 tors of the germ-cells, the former author having found but half the 
 normal number in some of the embryonic cells of the salamander, while 
 Hacker ('95, 3) finds that in Cyclops brevicornis the reduced number 
 of chromosomes (twelve) appears in the primordial germ-cells which 
 are differentiated in the blastula-stage (Fig. 74). He adds the inter- 
 esting discovery that in this form the somatic nuclei of the cleavage- 
 stages show the same number, and hence concludes that all the 
 chromosomes of these stages are bivalent. As development proceeds, 
 the germ-cells retain this character, while the somatic cells acquire 
 the usual number (twenty-four) â€” a process which, if the conception 
 of bivalent chromosomes be valid, must consist in the division of each 
 bivalent rod into its two elements. We have here a wholly new light 
 on the historical origin of reduction ; for the pseudo-reduction of the 
 germ-nuclei seems to be in this case a persistence of the embryonic 
 condition, and we may therefore hope for a future explanation of the 
 process by which it has in other cases been deferred until the penul- 
 timate cell-generation, as is certainly the fact in Ascaris? 

This leads to the consideration of some very interesting recent dis- 
 coveries regarding the relation of reduction to the alternation of gen- 
 erations in the higher plants. As already stated (p. 263), Strasburger, 
 Guignard, and other observers have found that in the angiosperms 
 the two maturation-divisions are in both sexes followed by one or 
 more divisions in which the reduced number persists. The cells thus 
 formed are generally recognized as belonging to the vestiges of the 
 sexual generation (prothallium) of the higher cryptogams, the pollen- 
 grains (or their analogues in the female) corresponding to the asexual 
 spores of the archegoniate cryptogams. We should, therefore, expect 
 to find reduction in the latter forms occurring in the two correspond- 
 ing divisions, by which the "tetrad" of spores is formed (as was first 
 pointed out by Hartog, '91). Botanists were thus led to the surmise, 
 first expressed by Overton in 1892, that the reduced number would 
 be found to occur in the prothallium-cells derived from those spores.

- It may be recalled that in Ascaris Boveri proved that the primordial germ-cells have 
 the full number of chromosomes, and Hertvv'ig clearly showed that this number is retained 
 up to the last division of the spermatogonia. Ishikawa ('97) finds that in Allium the 
 reduced number (eight) appears in the mitosis of the " Urpollenzellen " preceding the 
 pollen-mother-cells. This is, however, contradicted by Mottier ('97, 2).
