EARLY HISTORY OF THE GERM-NUCLEI 2/5 

This surmise quickly became a certainty. Overton himself dis- 
 coyered ('93) that the cells of the endosperm in the gymnosperm 
 Ceratozaniia divide with the reduced number, namely eight ; and 
 Dixon observed the same fact in Pimis at the same time. In the 
 following year Strasburger brought the matter to a definite conclusion 
 in the case of a fern {Osmiinda), showing that all the cells of the 
 prothalliwn, from the original spore-motlier-cell onwards to the for- 
 mation of the germ-cells, have one-half the number of chromosomes 
 found in the asexical generatio7i, namely twelve instead of twenty- 
 four ; in other words, the reduction takes place in the formation of 
 the spore from which the sexual generation arises, many cell-genera- 
 tions before the germ-cells are formed, indeed before the formation of 
 the body from which these cells arise. Similar facts were determined 
 by Farmer in Pallavicinia, one of the Hepaticas, where all of the 
 nuclei of the asexual generation (sporogonium) show eight chromo- 
 somes during division, those of the ^xual generation (thallus) four. 
 It now seems highly probable that this will be found a general rule. 

The striking point in these, as in Hacker's observations, is that the 
 numerical reduction takes place so long before the fertilization for 
 which it is the obvious preparation. Speculating on the meaning of 
 this remarkable fact, Strasburger advances the hypothesis that the 
 reduced number is the ancestral inimber inherited from the ancestral 
 type. The normal, i.e. somatic, number arose through conjugation 
 by which the chromosomes of two germ-cells were brought together. 
 Strasburger does not hesitate to apply the same conception to ani- 
 mals, and suggests that the four cells arising by the division of the 
 oogonium {^gg plus three polar bodies) represent the remains of a 
 separate generation, now a mere remnant included in the body in 
 somewhat the same manner that the rudimentary prothallium of angi- 
 osperms is included in the embryo-sac. This may seem a highly 
 improbable conclusion, but it must not be forgotten that so able a 
 zoologist as Whitman expressed a nearly related thought, as long ago 
 as 1878 : " I interpret the formation of polar globules as a relic of the 
 primitive mode of asexual reproduction.''^ Strasburger's view is 
 exactly the reverse of this in identifying the polar bodies as the 
 remains of a sexual generation ; and as Hacker has pointed out ('98, 
 p. 102), it is difficult to reconcile with the fact that true reduction 
 appears to occur already in the unicellular organisms (p. 277). The 
 hypothesis is nevertheless highly suggestive and one which suggests 
 a quite new point of view for the study not only of maturation but 
 also of the whole problem of sexuality. 

We may now return to the consideration of some details. In a 
 considerable number of forms, though not in all, the early prophase is
