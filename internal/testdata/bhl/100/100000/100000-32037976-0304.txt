REDUCTION OF THE CHROMOSOMES 

characterized, especially in the male, by a more or less complete 
 concentration of the chromatin-substance at one side of the nucleus. 
 This stage, to which Moore has given the name synapsis (Fig. 120, A\ 
 sometimes occurs when the spireme thread is already split {Ascaris, 
 Liliuni), sometimes before the division is visible (insects). In either 
 case the chroniatin-segnients emerge from the synapsis stage longitudi- 
 nally divided and in the rediLced nnm-ber, a fact which gives ground 
 for the conclusion that the synapsis is in some way concerned with 
 the rearrangement of the chromatin-substance involved in the numer- 
 ical reduction. During the synapsis the nucleolus remains quite 
 distinct from the chromatin, and in many cases it afterward persists 
 beside the tetrads, in the formation of which it takes no part, to be 
 cast out into the cytoplasm (Fig. 124) or to degenerate in situ during 
 the first maturation-division. 

A suggestive phenomena, described by several observers,^ is the 
 casting out of a large part of the nuclear reticulum of the germinal

vesicle at the time the polar bodies are formed (Figs. 97, 128). In 
 these cases {^Asterias, Polychcerits, Thalasseina, Nereis) only a small 
 fraction of the chromatin-substance is preserved to form the chromo- 
 somes, the remainder degenerating in the cytoplasm.^ 

As a final point we must briefly consider the varying accounts of 
 the achromatic maturation-figures in the female already briefly referred 
 to at page 85. In many forms {e.g. in turbellarians, nemertines, anne- 
 lids, mollusks, echinoderms) the polar amphiasters are of quite typical 
 form, with large asters and distinct centrosomes nearly similar to those 
 of the cleavage-figures. In others, however (nematodes, arthropods, 
 tunicates, vertebrates), the polar spindles differ markedly from those 
 of the cleavage-figures, being described by many authors as ejttirely 
 devoid of asters and even in some cases of centrosomes (Fig. 137).
