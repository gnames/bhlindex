REDUCTION IN UNICELLUIAR FORMS 2/7 

There can be no doubt that these polar spindles differ from the usual 
 type, and that they approach those recently described in the mitosis of 
 the higher plants, but it is doubtful whether the apparent absence of 
 asters and centrosomes is normal. In Ascaris, the first polar spindle 
 arising by a direct transformation of the germinal vesicle (Fig. 117) 
 has a barrel-shape, with no trace of asters. At the poles of the 
 spindle, however, are one or two deeply staining granules (Fig. 137), 
 which have been identified as centrosomes by Hacker ('94) and 
 Erlanger ('97, 4), but by Fiirst ('98) are regarded as central granules, 
 the whole spindle being conceived as an enlarged centrosome.^ For 
 the reasons stated at page 314, I believe the former to be the correct 
 interpretation.^ Spindles without centrosomes have been described in 
 the eggs of tunicates (Julin, Hill, Crampton), in Ainp/iioxus {SohoXXB.), 
 in some species of copepods (Hacker), and in some vertebrates {Die- 
 myctylus, Jordan ; mouse, Sobotta). In Amphioxns (Sobotta) and 
 Triton (Carnoy and LeBrun) complete asters are not formed, but 
 fibrillae apparently corresponding to astral rays and converging to 
 the spindle-poles are found outside the limits of the spindle (Fig. 137). 
 In the guinea-pig, according to Montgomery ('98), centrosomes and 
 asters are present in the first polar spindle, but absent in the second. 
 The evidence is on the whole rather strong that the achromatic figure 
 in 'these cases approaches in form that seen in the higher plants ; 
 but it is an open question whether the appearances described may not 
 be a result of imperfect fixation. 

F. Reduction in Unicellular Forms 

Although the one-celled and other lower forms have not yet been 
 sufficiently investigated, we have already good ground for the conclu- 
 sion that a process analogous to the reduction of higher types regularly 
 recurs in them. In the conjugation of Infusoria, as already described 
 (p. 223), the original nucleus divides several times before union, and 
 only one of the resulting nuclei becomes the conjugating germ-nucleus,, 
 while the others perish, like the polar bodies. The numerical corre- 
 spondence between the rejected nuclei or " corpuscules de rebut " has 
 already been pointed out (p. 227). Hertwig could not count the chro- 
 mosomes with absolute certainty, yet he states ('89) that in Parai)ioe- 
 cinm ca?cdatum, during the final division, the number of spindle-fibres 
 and of the corresponding chromatic elements is but 4-6, while in the

2 Sala ('94) and Fiirst have shown that occasionally the polar spindles of Ascaris are 
 provided with large typical asters, and thus resemble those of annelids or mollusks. Sala 
 believed this to be an effect of lowered temperature, but Fiirst 's observations are unfavour- 
 able to this conclusion.
