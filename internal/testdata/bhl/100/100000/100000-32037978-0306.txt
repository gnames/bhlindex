REDUCTION OF THE CHROMOSOMES 

earlier divisions the number is approximately double this (8-9). This 
 observation makes it nearly certain that a numerical reduction of 
 chromosomes occurs in the Protozoa in a manner similar to that of 
 the higher forms ; but the reduction here appears to be deferred until

the final division. In the gregarines Wolters ('91) has observed the 
 formation of an actual polar body as a small cell segmented off from 
 each of the two conjugating animals soon after their union ; but the 

number of chromo- 
 somes was not deter-

 ('96, 2) has observed a 
 like process in Acti- 
 iiopJirys, each of the 
 gametes segmenting 
 off a single polar body, 
 after which the germ- 
 nuclei fuse (Fig. 138). 
 It is possible, as R. 
 Hertwig ('98) points 
 out, that in both these 
 forms a second polar 
 body may have been 
 overlooked, owing per-
