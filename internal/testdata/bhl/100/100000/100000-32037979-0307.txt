 A. Soon after union, four chromatophores. B. Chromatophores reduced to two, nuclei 
 distinct. C. Fusion of the nuclei. D. First cleavage of the zygote. E. Resulting 2-cell stage. 
 F. Second cleavage. G. Resulting stage, each cell bi-nucleate. H. Separation of the cells; 
 one of the nuclei in each enlarging to form the permanent nucleus, the other (probably repre- 
 senting a polar body) degenerating. 

1 Actinospharium forms one of the most extreme known cases of in-breeding; for the 
 gametes are sister-cells which immediately reunite after forming the polar bodies. The 
 general facts are as follows : The mother animal, containing very numerous nuclei, becomes 
 encysted, and a very large number of the nuclei degenerate. The body then segments into
