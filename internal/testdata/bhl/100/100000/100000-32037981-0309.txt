MATURATION OF PARTHENOGENETIC EGGS 28 1 

theoretical meaning of maturation, the suggestion is made that 
 parthenogenesis may be due to failure on the part of the tgg to 
 form the polar bodies, the egg-nucleus thus remaining hermaphrodite, 
 and hence capable of development without fertilization. This sug- 
 gestion forms the germ of all later theories of parthenogenesis. Bal- 
 four ('80) suggested that the function of forming polar cells has been 
 acquired by the ovum for the express purpose of preventing parthe- 
 nogenesis, and a nearly similar view was afterward maintained by 
 Van Beneden.i These authors assumed accordingly that in par- 
 thenogenetic eggs no polar bodies are formed. Weismann (^?>6) soon 
 discovered, however, that the parthenogenetic eggs of Polyphemus 
 (one of the Daphnidse) produce a single polar body. This observa- 
 tion was quickly followed by the still more significant discovery by 
 Blochmann ('88) that in Aphis the parthenogenetic eggs produce a siiigle 
 polar body, while the fertilized eggs produce ttvo. Weismann was able 
 to determine the same fact in ostracodes and Rotifera, and was thus 
 led to the view^ which later researches have entirely confirmed, that 
 it is the second polar body that is of special significance in partheno- 
 genesis. Blochmann observed that in insects the polar bodies were 
 not actually thrown out of the &gg, but remained embedded in its 
 substance near the periphery. At the same time Boveri {^"^7, i) dis- 
 covered that in Ascaris the second polar body might in exceptional 
 cases remain in the Q,gg and there give rise to a resting-nucleus indis- 
 tinguishable from the egg-nucleus or sperm-nucleus. He was thus 
 led to the interesting suggestion that parthenogenesis might be due 
 to the retention of the second polar body in the Q.gg and its union 
 with the egg-nucleus. " The second polar body would thus, in a 
 certain sense, assume the role of the spermatozoon, and it might not 
 without reason be said : ^^Parthenogenesis is the result of fertilization 
 by the second polar body.'' ^ 

This conclusion received a brilliant confirmation through the obser- 
 vations of Brauer ('93) on the parthenogenetic Q.gg of Artemia, 
 though it appeared that Boveri arrived at only a part of the truth. 
 Blochmann ('88-'89) had found that in the parthenogenetic eggs 
 of the honey-bee tivo polar bodies are formed, and Platner discov- 
 ered the same fact in the butterfly Liparis ('89) — a fact which 
 seemed to contradict Boveri's hypothesis. Brauer's beautiful re- 
 searches resolved the contradiction by showing that there are tzvo 
 types oi parthcnoge?iesis which may occur in the same animal. In the 
 one case Boveri's conception is exactly realized, while the other is 
 easily brought into relation with it.
