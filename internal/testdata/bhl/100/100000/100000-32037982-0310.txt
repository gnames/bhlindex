(Fig. 141) but one polar body is formed, which removes eighty-four 
 dyads, leaving eighty-four in the Q,gg. There may be an abortive 
 attempt to form a second polar spindle, but no division results, and 
 the eighty-four dyads give rise to a reticular cleavage-nucleus. From

A. The first polar spindle ; the equatorial plate contains 84 tetrads. B. C. Formation of the 
 first polar body ; 84 dyads remain in the egg, and these give rise to the egg-nucleus, shown in D. 
 F. Appearance of the egg-centrosome and aster. E. G. Division of the aster and formation 
 of the cleavage-figure ; the equatorial plate consists of 84 apparently single but in reality bivalent 
 chromosomes.

{b) It is the second and rarer mode that realizes Boveri's concep- 
 tion (Fig. 142). Both polar bodies are formed, the first removing 
 eighty-four dyads and leaving the same number in the egg. In the 
 formation of the second, the eighty-four dyads are halved to form
