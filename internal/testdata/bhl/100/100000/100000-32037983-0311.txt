MATURATION OF PARTHENOGENETIC EGGS

two daughter-groups, each containing eighty-four single chromosomes. 
 Both these groups remai7i in the egg, and each gives rise to a single 
 reticular nucleus, as described by Boveri in Ascaris. These tzvo nuclei 
 place themselves side by side in the cleavage-figure, and give rise each 
 to eigJity-four chromosomes^ precisely like two germ-nuclei in ordinary 
 fertilization. The one hundred and sixty-eight chromosomes split

 in the same number in later stages. In other words, the second polar 
 body here plays the part of a sperm-nucleus precisely as maintained 
 by Boveri. 

In all individuals arising from eggs of the first type, therefore, the 
 somatic number of chromosomes is eighty-four ; in all those arising 
 from eggs of the second type, it is one hundred and sixty-eight. This
