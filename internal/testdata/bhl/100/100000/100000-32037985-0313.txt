2. Aviitosis in the Early Sex-cells 

Whether the progenitors of the germ-cells ever divide amitotically is a question of 
 high theoretical interest. Numerous observers have described amitotic division in 
 testis-cells, and a few also in those of the ovary. The recent observations of Meves 
 ('91), Vom Rath ('93), and others leave no doubt whatever that such divisions 
 occur in the testis of many animals. Vom Rath maintains, after an extended inves- 
 tigation, that all cells so dividing do not belong in the cycle of development of the 
 germ-cells ('93, p. 164) ; that amitosis occurs only in the supporting or nutritive cells 
 (Sertoli-cells, etc.), or in such as are destined to degenerate, like the "residual 
 bodies " of Van Beneden. Meves has, however, produced strong evidence ('94) that 
 in the salamander the spermatogonia may, in the autumn, divide by amitosis. and in 
 the ensuing spring may again resume the process of mitotic division, and give rise to 
 functional spermatozoa. On the strength of these observations Flemming ('93) him- 
 self now admits the possibility that amitosis may form part of a normal cycle of devel- 
 opment.^ 

H. Summary and Conclusion 

The one fact of maturation that stands out with perfect clearness 
 and certainty amid all the controversies surrounding it is a redtcction 
 of the number of chromosomes in the ultimate germ-cells to one-Jialf the 
 number characteristic of the somatic cells. It is equally clear that this 
 reduction is a preparation of the germ-cells for their subsequent union, 
 and a means by which the number of chromosomes is held constant 
 in the species. With a few exceptions the first indication of the 
 numerical reduction appears through the segmentation of the spireme- 
 thread, or the resolution of the nuclear reticulum, into a number of 
 masses one-half tJiat of tJie somatic chromosomes. In nearly all higher 
 animals this process first takes place two cell-generations before the 
 formation of the definitive germ-cells, and the process of reduction is 
 completed by two rapidly succeeding "maturation-divisions," giving 
 rise to four cells, all of which become functional in the male, while in 
 the female only one becomes the o-g^, while the other three — the 
 polar bodies or their analogues — are cast aside. During these two 
 divisions each of the original chromatin-masses gives rise to four 
 chromosomes, of which each of the four daughter-cells receives one ; 
 hence, each of the latter receives one-half the somatic number of 
 chromosomes. In the higher plants, however, the two maturation- 
 divisions are followed by a number of others, in which the reduced 
 number of chromosomes persists, a process most strikingly shown in 
 the pteridophytes, where a separate sexual generation (prothallium) 
 thus arises, all the cells of which show the reduced number. 

Two general types of maturation may be distinguished according 
 to the manner in which the primary chromatin-masses divide. In one,
