286 REDUCTION OF THE CHROMOSOMES 

typically represented by Ascaris and the arthropods, each of these 
 masses divides into four to form a tetrad, thus preparing at once for 
 two rapidly succeeding divisions, which are not separated by a recon- 
 struction of the daughter-nuclei during an intervening resting period. 
 In the other, examples of which are given by the flowering plants and 
 the spermatogenesis of the Amphibia, no true tetrads are formed, the 
 primary chromatin-masses dividing separately for each of the matura- 
 tion-divisions, which are separated by a period in which the nuclei 
 regress toward the resting state, though often not completely return- 
 ing to the reticular condition. These two types differ, however, only 
 in degree, and with few excepHons they agree in the fact that during 
 the prophases of the first division the chromatin-bodies assume the 
 form of rings, the mitosis thus being of the heterotypical form, and 
 each ring having the prospective value of four chromosomes. 

Thus far the phenomena present no difficulty, and they give us a 
 clear view of the process by which the numerical reduction of the 
 chromosomes is effected. The confusion of the subject arises, on the 
 one hand, from its complication with theories regarding the individu- 
 ality of the chromosomes and the functions of chromatin in inheri- 
 tance, on the other through conflicting results of observation on the 
 mode of tetrad-formation and the character of the maturation-divisions. 
 Regarding the latter question nearly all observers are now agreed that 
 one of these divisions, usually the first, is a longitudinal or equation- 
 division, essentially like that occurring in ordinary mitosis. The main 
 question turns upon the other division, which has been shown in some 
 cases to be transverse and not longitudinal, and thus separates what 
 were originally different regions of the spireme-thread or nuclear 
 substance. The evidence in favour of such a division seems at present 
 well-nigh demonstrative in the case of insects and copepods, and 
 hardly less convincing in the turbellarians, anneHds, and mollusks. 
 On the other hand, both divisions are regarded as longitudinal by most 
 of those who have investigated the phenomena in Ascaris and in the 
 vertebrates, and by some of the most competent investigators of the 
 flowering plants. 

The evidence as it stands is so evenly balanced that the subject is 
 hardly yet ripe for discussion. The principle for which Weismann 
 contended in his theory of reducing division has received strong 
 support in fact; yet should it be finally established that numerical 
 reduction may be effected either with or without transverse division, 
 as now seems probable, not only will that theory have to be aban- 
 doned or wholly remodelled, but we shall have to seek a new basis 
 for the interpretation of mitosis in general. Weismann's theory is 
 no doubt of a highly artificial character ; but this should not close our 
 eyes to the great interest of the problem that it attempted to solve.
