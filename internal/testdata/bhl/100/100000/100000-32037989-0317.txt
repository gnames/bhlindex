SOME PROBLEMS OF CELL-ORGANIZATION 

" Wir miissen deshalb den lebenden Zellen, abgesehen von der Molecularstructur der 
 organischen Verbindungen, welche sie enthalt, noch eine andere und in anderer Weise com- 
 plicirte Structur zuschreiben, und diese es ist, welche wir mit dem Namen Organization 
 bezeichnen." Brucke.^

The remarkable history of the chromatic substance in the matura- 
 tion of the germ-cells forces upon our attention the problem of the 
 ultimate morphological organization of the nucleus, and this in its 
 turn involves our whole conception of protoplasm and the cell. The 
 grosser and more obvious organization is revealed to us by the micro- 
 scope as a differentiation of its substance into nucleus, cytoplasm, 
 and the like. But, as Strasburger has well said, it would indeed be a 
 strange accident if the highest powers of our present microscopes had 
 laid bare the ultimate organization of the cell. Brlicke insisted more 
 than thirty years ago that protoplasm must possess a far more com- 
 plicated morphological organization than is revealed to us in the 
 visible structure of the cell, repeating, though without accepting, an 
 earlier suggestion of Henle's ('41) that the cell might be composed of 
 more elementary vital units ranking between the molecule and the 
 cell. Many biological thinkers since Briicke's time have in one form 
 or other accepted this conception, which indeed lies at the root of 
 nearly all recent attempts to analyze exhaustively the phenomena of 
 cell-life. Without attempting to follow out the history of opinion in 
 detail or to give any extended review of the various theories,^ it may 
 be pointed out that this conception was based both on theoretical 
 a priori grounds and on the observed facts of cell-structure. On the 
 former basis it was developed by Herbert Spencer"* in his theory of 
 " physiological units " by which he endeavoured to explain the phe- 
 nomena of regeneration, development, and heredity ; while Nageli 
 (â€¢84) developed on the same general lines his theory of micellce which
