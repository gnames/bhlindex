290 SOME PROBLEMS OF CELL-ORGANIZATION 

has been so widely accepted by botanists. In the meantime Darwin ^ 
 introduced a new element into the speculative edifice in his celebrated 
 hypothesis of pangenesis, where for the first time appear the two 
 assumptions of specific differences in the ultra-microscopic corpuscles 
 (" gemmules ") and the power of self-propagation by division. Dar- 
 win did not, however, definitely maintain that protoplasm was actually 
 built of such bodies. The latter hypothesis was added by De Vries 
 ('89), who remodelled the theory of pangenesis on this assumption, 
 thus laying the basis for the theories of development which reached 
 their climax in the writings of Hertwig and Weismann. 

The views of Spencer and Darwin were based on purely theoretical 
 grounds derived from the general phenomena of growth and inheri- 
 tance.^ Those of Nageli, De Vries, Wiesner, Altmann, and others 
 were more directly based on the results of microscopical investigation. 
 The view was first suggested by Henle ('41), and at a later period 
 developed by Bechamp and Estor, by Maggi and especially by Alt- 
 mann, that the protoplasmic granules might be actually organic units 
 or bioblasts, capable of assimilation, growth, and division, and hence 
 to be regarded as elementary units of structure standing between the 
 cell and the ultimate molecules of living matter. By Altmann, espe- 
 cially, this view was pushed to an extreme limit, which lay far beyond 
 anything justified by the known facts; and the theory of genetic con- 
 tinuity expressed by Redi in the aphorism " omne vivinn ex vivo,'' 
 reduced by Virchow to ^' oninis celliila e celhda,'' finally appears in 
 the writings of Altmann as ^^ onine granulum e gramtlo'' !^ 

Altmann's premature generalization rested upon a very insecure 
 foundation and was received with just scepticism. Except in the case 
 of plastids, the division of the cytoplasmic granules was and still 
 remains a pure assumption, and furthermore many of Altmann's 
 "granules" (zymogen-granules of gland-cells, etc.) are undoubtedly 
 metaplasmic bodies.'* Yet the beautiful discoveries of Schimper ('85) 
 and others on the origin of plastids in plant-cells give evidence that 
 these cells do in fact contain large numbers of bodies, other than the 
 nuclei, that possess the power of growth and division. The division 
 of the chlorophyll-bodies, observed long ago by Mohl, was shown by 
 Schmitz and Schimper to be their usual if not their only mode of ori- 
 gin ; and Schimper was able to trace them back to minute colourless 
 plastids, scarcely larger than " microsomes," that are present in large 
 numbers in the protoplasm of the embryonic cells and of the egg, and 
 give rise not only to chlorophyll-bodies but also to the amyloplasts or 
 starch-formers and the chromoplasts or pigment-bodies. While it still 
 remains doubtful whether the plastids arise solely by division or also
