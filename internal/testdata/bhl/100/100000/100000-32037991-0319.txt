THE NATURE OF CELL-ORGANS

by new formation (as now seems to be the case with the centrosome), 
 the foregoing observations on the plastids give a substantial basis for 
 the hypothesis that protoplasm may be built of minute dividing bodies 
 which form its ultimate structural basis. It was these facts, taken in 
 connection with the phenomena of particulate inheritance and varia- 
 tion (Galton), that led De Vries and his followers to the fundamental 
 assumption of " pangens," "plasomes," "biophores," and the like as 
 final protoplasmic units ; ^ but these were conceived not as the visible 
 granules, plastids, etc., but as much smaller bodies, lying far beyond 
 the limits of present microscopical vision, through the growth or 
 aggregation of which the visible structures arise. This assumption 
 has been harshly criticised ; yet when we recall that in one form or 
 another it has been accepted by such men as Spencer, Darwin, Beale, 
 Hackel, Michael Foster, Nageli, De Vries, Wiesner, Roux, Weis- 
 mann, Oscar Hertwig, Verworn, and Whitman, and on evidence drawn 
 from sources so diverse, we must admit that despite its highly specula- 
 tive character it is not to be lightly rejected. In the present chapter 
 we may inquire how far the known facts of cell-structure speak for or 
 against this hypothesis, incidentally considering a number of detailed 
 questions of cell-morphology which have not hitherto found a place. 

A. The Nature of Cell-organs 

The cell is, in Briicke's words, an elementary organism, which may 
 by itself perform all the characteristic operations of life, as is the case 
 with the unicellular organisms, and in a sense also with the germ-cells. 
 Even when the cell is but a constituent unit of a higher grade of 
 organization, as in multicellular forms, it is no less truly an organism, 
 and in a measure leads an independent life, even though its functions 
 be restricted and subordinated to the common life. It is true that the 
 earlier conception of the multicellular body as a colony of one-celled 
 forms cannot be accepted without certain reservations.^ Neverthe- 
 less, all the facts at our command indicate that the tissue-cell possesses 
 the same morphological organization as the egg-cell, or the protozoan, 
 and the same fundamental physiological properties as well. Like 
 these the tissue-cell has its differentiated structural parts or organs, 
 and we have now to inquire how these cell-organs are to be conceived. 

1 The following list includes only some of the various names that have been given to 
 these hypothetical units by modern writers : Physiological units (Spencer) ; geinmules 
 (Darwin) ; pangens (De Vries) ; plasomes (Wiesner) ; micelles (Nageli) ; plastidules 
 (Hackel and Elssberg) ; inotagmata (Engelmann) ; biophores (Weismann); hioblasts 
 (Beale); somacules {YoiX.e.r); idioblasts (Hertwig); idiosomes (Whitman); biogens (Ver- 
 worn); microzymas (Bechamp and Estor) ; geniDuc (Haacke). These names are not 
 strictly synonymous, nor do all of the writers cited assume the power of division in the 
 units. "^ Cf. p. 58.
