SOME PROBLEMS OF CELL-ORGANIZATION 

est visible granules first come into existence when they first come 
 within view of the microscope. The " homogeneous " substance must 
 itself contain or consist of granules still smaller. The real question 
 is not whether such ultra-microscopical bodies exist, but whether they 
 are permanent organize d\)Q)6AQ.'s> possessing besides the power of growth 
 also the power of division. This question can be only indirectly ap- 
 proached ; and we shall find it convenient to do so by beginning at 
 the opposite end of the series, through a reconsideration of the 
 phenomena of nuclear division.

(a) HypotJiesis of the Individuality of the Chromosomes. — It may 
 now be taken as a well-established fact that the nucleus is never 
 formed de novo, but always arises by the division of a preexisting 
 nucleus. In the typical mode of division by mitosis the chromatic 
 substance is resolved into a group of chromosomes, always the same 
 in form and number in a given species of cell, and having the power 
 of assimilation, growth, and division, as if they were morphological 
 individuals of a lower order than the nucleus. That they are such 
 individuals or units °has been maintained as a definite hypothesis, es- 
 pecially by Rabl and Boveri. As a result of careful study of mitosis 
 in epithelial cells of the salamander, Rabl ('85) concluded that the 
 chromosomes do not lose their individuality at the close of division, but 
 persist in tJie chromatic reticubim of the resting mtcleus. The reticu- 
 lum arises through a transformation of the chromosomes, which give 
 off anastomosing branches, and thus give rise to the appearance of a 
 network. Their loss of identity is, however, only apparent. They 
 come into view again at the ensuing division, at the beginning of 
 which " the chromatic substance flows back, through predetermined 
 paths, into the primary chromosome-bodies " (Kernfaden), which re- 
 appear in the ensuing spireme-stage in nearly or quite the same posi- 
 tion they occupied before. Even in the resting nucleus, Rabl believed 
 that he could discover traces of the chromosomes in the configuration 
 of the network, and he described the nucleus as showing a distinct 
 polarity having a " pole " corresponding with the point toward which 
 the apices of the chromosomes converge {i.e. toward the centrosome), 
 and an " antipole " (Gegenpol) at the opposite point {i.e. toward the 
 equator of the spindle) (Fig. 22). Rabl's hypothesis was precisely 
 formulated and ardently advocated by Boveri in 1887 and 1888, and 
 again in 189 1, on the ground of his own studies and those of Van 
 Beneden on the early stages of Ascaris. The hypothesis was supported
