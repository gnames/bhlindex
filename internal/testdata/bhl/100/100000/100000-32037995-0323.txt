by extremely strong evidence, derived especially from a study of ab- 
 normal variations in the early development of Ascaris, the force of 
 which has, I think, been underestimated by the critics of the hypothesis. 
 Some of this evidence may here be briefly reviewed. In some cases, 
 through a miscarriage of the mitotic mechanism, one or both of the 
 chromosomes destined for the second polar body are accidentally left

 reticular nucleus (9, 9) ; the sperm-nucleus below (J). B. Later stage of the same, a single

in the Q.gg. These chromosomes give rise in the Q.%g to a reticular nu- 
 cleus, indistinguishable from the egg-nucleus. At a later period this 
 nucleus gives rise to the same number of chromosomes as those that 
 entered into its formation, i.e. either one or two. These are drawn 
 into the equatorial plate along with those derived from the germ- 
 nuclei, and mitosis proceeds as usual, the number of chromosomes 
 being, however, abnormally increased from four to five or six (Fig. 143,
