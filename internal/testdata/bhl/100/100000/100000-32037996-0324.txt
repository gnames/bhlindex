SOME PROBLEMS OF CELL-ORGANIZATION 

C, D). Again, the two chromosomes left in the egg after removal of 
 the second polar body may accidentally become separated. In this 
 case each chromosome gives rise to a reticular nucleus of half the 
 usual size, and from each of these a single chromosome is afterward 
 formed (Fig. 143, A, B). Finally, it sometimes happens that the two 
 germ-nuclei completely fuse, while in the reticular state, as is normally 
 the case in sea-urchins and some other animals (p. 188). From the 
 cleavage-nucleus thus formed arise four chromosomes. 

The same general result is given by the observations of Zur Strassen 
 ('98) on the history of giant embryos in Ascai'is. These embryos 
 arise by the fusion, either before or after the fertilization, of previ- 
 ously separate eggs, and have been shown to be capable of develop- 
 ment up to a late stage. Not only in the first but also in some, at 
 least, of the later mitoses, such eggs show an increased number of 

chromosomes proportional to the number 
 of nuclei that have united. Thus in 
 monospermic double eggs (variety bi- 
 valens) the number is six instead of four ; 
 in dispermic double eggs the number is 
 increased to eight (Fig. 144). 

These remarkable observations show 
 that zvJiatever be the number of chromo- 
 somes entering into the formation of a 
 reticular miclens, the same number after- 
 ward issues from it — a result which de- 
 monstrates that the number of chromo- 
 somes is not due merely to the chemical 
 composition of the chromatin-substance, 
 but to a morphological organization of 
 the nucleus. A beautiful confirmation 
 of this conclusion was afterward made 
 by Boveri ('93, '95, i) and Morgan ('95, 
 4), in the case of echinoderms, by rear- 
 ing larvae from enucleated egg-fragments, fertilized by a single sper- 
 matozodn (p. 194). All the nuclei of such larvae contain but half the 
 typical number of chromosomes, — i.e. in Echimis nine instead of 
 eighteen, — since all are descended from one germ-nucleus instead 
 of two ! 

Equally striking is the remarkable fact, described at page 275, that 
 all of the cells in the sexual generation (oophore) of the higher 
 cryptogams show half the number of chromosomes characteristic of 
 the sporophyte, the explanation being that while reduction occurs 
 at the time of spore-formation, the spores develop without fertilization, 
 the reduced chromosome-number persisting until fertilization occurs
