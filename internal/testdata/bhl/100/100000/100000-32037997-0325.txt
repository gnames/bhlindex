long afterward. Attention may be again called to the surprising case 
 of Artemia, described at page 281, which gives a strong argument in 
 favour of the hypothesis. 

In addition to the foregoing evidence, Van Beneden and Boveri 
 were able to demonstrate in Ascaris that in the formation of the 
 spireme the chromosomes reappear in the same position as those 
 which entered into the formation of the reticulum, precisely as Rabl

E. Anaphase of the first cleavage. F. Two-cell stage with lobed nuclei, the lobes formed by

maintained. As the long chromosomes diverge, their free ends are 
 always turned toward the middle plane (Fig. 31), and upon the re- 
 construction of the daughter-nuclei these ends give rise to correspond- 
 ing lobes of the nucleus, as in Fig. 145, which persist throughout the 
 resting state. At the succeeding division the chromosomes reappear 
 exactly in the same position, t/icir ends lying- in the nuclear lobes as 
 before (Fig. 145, G, H). On the strength of these facts Boveri con- 
 cluded that the chromosomes must be regarded as '* individuals " or 
 " elementary organisms," that have an independent existence in the
