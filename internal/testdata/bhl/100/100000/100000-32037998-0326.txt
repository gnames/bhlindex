SOME PROBLEMS OF CELL-ORGANIZATION 

cell. During the reconstruction of the nucleus they send forth pseu- 
 dopodia which anastomose to form a network in which their identity 
 is lost to view. As the cell prepares for division, however, the chro- 
 mosomes contract, withdraw their processes, and return to their 
 " resting state," in which fission takes place. Applying this con- 
 clusion to the fertilization of the Q.gg, Boveri expressed his belief that

other half of maternal T ^
