MORPHOLOGICAL COMPOSITION OF THE NUCLEUS 299 

Boveri's hypothesis has been criticised by many writers, especially 
 by Hertwig, Guignard, and Brauer, and I myself have urged some 
 objections to it. Recently, however, it has received a support so 
 strong as to amount almost to a demonstration, through the remark- 
 able observations of Ruckert, Hacker, Herla, and Zoja on the 
 independence of the paternal and maternal chromosomes. These 
 observations, already referred to at page 208, may be more fully re- 
 viewed at this point. Hacker ('92, 2) first showed that in Cyclops 
 strenuus, as in Ascaris and other forms, the germ-nuclei do not fuse, 
 but give rise to two separate groups of chromosomes that lie side by 
 side near the equator of the cleavage-spindle. In the two-cell stage 
 (of Cyclops temiicornis) each nucleus consists of two distinct though 
 closely united halves, which Hacker believed to be the derivatives of 
 the two respective germ-nuclei. The truth of this surmise was demon- 
 strated three years later by Ruckert ('95, 3) in a species of Cyclops, 
 likewise identified as C. strenuiis (Fig. 146). The number of chromo- 
 somes in each germ-nucleus is here twelve. Ruckert was able to 
 trace the paternal and maternal groups of daughter-chromosomes not 
 only into the respective halves of the daughter-nuclei of the two-cell 
 stage, but into later cleavage-stages. From the bilobed nuclei of the 
 two-cell stage arise, in each cell, a double spireme and a double 
 group of chromosomes, from which are formed bilobed or double 
 nuclei in the four-cell stage. This process is repeated at the next 
 cleavage, and the double character of the nuclei was in many cases 
 distinctly recognizable at a late stage when the germ-layers were 
 being formed. 

Finally Victor Herla's ('93) and Zoja's ('95, 2) remarkable obser- 
 vations on Ascaris showed that in Ascaris not only the chromatin of 
 the germ-nuclei, but also the paternal and maternal chromosomes, 
 remain perfectly distinct as far as the twelve-cell stage â€” certainly a 
 brilliant confirmation of Boveri's conclusion. Just how far the dis- 
 tinction is maintained is still uncertain, but Hacker's and Riickert's 
 observations give some ground to believe that it may persist through- 
 out the entire life of the embryo. Both these observers have shown 
 that the chromosomes of the germinal vesicle appear in tivo distinct 
 groups, and Ruckert suggests that these may represent the paternal 
 and maternal elements that have remained distinct throughout the 
 entire cycle of development, even down to the formation of the tgg ! 

Leaving aside all doubtful cases (such as the above suggestion of 
 Riickert's), the well-determined facts form an irresistible proof of the 
 general hypothesis ; and it is one with which every general analysis 
 of the cell has to reckon. I beHeve, however, that the hypothesis has 
 received an unfortunate name ; for, except in a few special cases,^
