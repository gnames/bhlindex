SOME PROBLEMS OF CELL-ORGANIZATION- 

almost no direct evidence exists to show that the chromosomes persist 
 as " individuals " in the chromatin-reticulum of the resting cell. The 
 facts indicate, on the contrary, that in the vast majority of cases the 
 identity of the chromosomes is wholly lost in the resting nucleus, and 
 the attempts to identify them through the polarity or other morpho- 
 logical features of the nuclear network have on the whole been futile. 
 It is therefore an abuse of language to speak of a persistent " individ-

 us to the extraordinary interest and significance of the facts. It is 
 difficult to suppose that the tendency of the chromatin to resolve 
 itself into a particular number of chromosomes is directly due to its 
 chemical or molecular structure, or is analogous to crystallization ; for 
 in the chromatin of the same species, or even in that of the same o-gg, 
 this tendency varies, not with chemical, but with purely morphological
