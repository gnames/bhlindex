302 SOME PROBLEMS OF CELL-ORGANIZATION 

divide, in the reticulum of the spermatocyte-nucleus, they are very 
 numerous. His figures of the spireme-thread show at first nearly 
 forty granules in linear series (Fig. 120, B). Just before the breaking 
 of the thread into two the number is reduced to ten or twelve (Fig. 
 120, C). Just after the division to form the two tetrads the number 
 is four or five (Fig. 120, D), which finally fuse into a homogeneous 
 body.^ 

It is certain, therefore, that the number of chromomeres is not con- 
 stant in a given species, but it is a significant fact that in Ascaris the 
 final number, before fusion, appears to be nearly the same (four to 
 six) both in the oogenesis and the spermatogenesis. The facts re- 
 garding bivalent and plurivalent chromosomes (p. 87) at once sug- 
 gest themselves, and one cannot avoid the thought that the smallest 
 chromatin-grains may successively group themselves in larger and 
 larger combinations of which the final term is the chromosome. 
 Whether these combinations are to be regarded as " individuals " is a 
 question which can only lead to a barren play of words. The fact 
 that cannot be escaped is that the history of the chromatin-substance 
 reveals to us, not a homogeneous substance, but a definite morpho- 
 logical organization in which, as through an inverted telescope, we 
 behold a series of more and more elementary groups, the last visible 
 term of which is the smallest chromatin-granule, or nuclear microsome, 
 beyond which our present optical appliances do not allow us to see. 
 Are these the ultimate dividing units, as Brauer suggests (p. 113)? 
 Here again we may well recall Strasburger's warning, and hesitate to 
 identify the end of the series with the limits reached by our best 
 lenses. Somewhere, however, the series must end in final chromatic 
 units which cannot be further subdivided without the decomposition 
 of chromatin into simpler chemical substances ; and these units must 
 be capable of assimilation, growth, and division without loss of their 
 specific character. It is in these ultimate units that we must seek the 
 " qualities," if they exist, postulated in Roux's hypothesis ; but the 
 existence of such qualitative differences is a physiological assumption 
 that in no manner prejudices our conclusion regarding the ultimate 
 morphological composition of the chromatin.

What, now, is the relation of the chromatin-grains to the linin-net- 
 work and the cytoplasm.? Van Beneden long ago maintained ^ that 

1 Eisen ('99) finds that the chromosomes of the spermatogonia of Batrachoseps always 
 consist of six " chromomeres," each of which consists of three smaller granules or " chromi- 
 oles." The latter persist as the chromatin-granules of the resting nucleus; and it is through 
 their successive aggregation that the chromomeres and chromosomes are formed,
