304 SOME PROBLEMS OF CELL-ORGANIZATION 

microsomes arranged in a network. The clearest evidence is, however, 
 afforded by the origin of the spindle-fibres in mitotic division ; for it 
 is now well established that these may be formed either inside or out- 
 side the nucleus, and at the close of mitosis the central portion of the 
 spindle appears always to give rise to a portion of the cytoplasm 
 lying between the daughter-nuclei. In such a case as that of the 
 sea-urchin (see above) we have, therefore, evidence of a direct trans- 
 formation of chromatin into linin-substance, of the latter into spindle- 
 fibres, and, finally, of these into cytoplasm. 

When all these facts are placed in connection, we find it difficult to 
 escape the conclusion that no definite line can be drawn between the 
 cytoplasmic granules at one extreme and the chromatin-granules at 
 the other. And inasmuch as the latter are certainly capable of 
 growth and division, we cannot deny the possibility that the former 
 may themselves have, or arise from elements having like powers. 
 But while we may take this as a fair working hypothesis, we should 
 clearly recognize that the base of well-determined fact on which it 
 rests is approached by a circuitous route ; that in case of most of the 
 cytoplasmic granules there is not the slightest evidence that they 
 multiply by division ; and that even though some of them may have 
 such powers, we cannot regard them as the ultimate structural units, 
 for the latter must be bodies far more minute. 

E. The Centrosome 

From our present point of view the centrosome possesses a peculiar 
 interest as a cell-organ which may be scarcely larger than a cytomi- 
 crosome, yet possesses specific physiological properties, assimilates, 
 grows, divides, and may persist from cell to cell without loss of identity. 
 Nearly all observers of the centrosome have found it lying in the 
 cytoplasm, outside the nucleus; but apart from the Protozoa (p. 94) 
 there is at least one well-established case in which it lies within the 
 nucleus, namely, that of Ascaris, where Brauer made the interesting 
 discovery that in one variety {tmivalens^ the centrosome lies inside the 
 nucleus, in the other variety {bivalens^ outside â€” a fact which proves 
 that its position is non-essential {^cf. Figs. 120 and 148). 

An intra-nuclear origin of the centrosome has also been asserted by 
 Julin ('93) in the primary spermatocytes of Styleopsis, by Ruckert 
 ('94) in the eggs of Cyclops, Mathews ('95) in those of Asterias, Car- 
 noy and Le Brun ('97, 2) in Ascaris, Van der Stricht ('98) in the eggs 
 of Thysanosoon, by R. Hertwig ('98) in ActinospJicerium, Calkins 
 ('98, i) in Noctiluca, and Schaudinn ('96, 3) in spore-producing buds of 
 Acanthocystis, though in the last-named form the centrosome of the 
 vegetative forms is extra-nuclear (p. 92).
