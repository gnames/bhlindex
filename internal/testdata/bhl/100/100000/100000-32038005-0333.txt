THE CENTROSOME

As already stated/ it is still undetermined whether a true centro- 
 some may ever arise de novo, but the evidence in favour of such a 
 possibility has of late rapidly increased. Carnoy il'^Q) long since 
 showed that the &^g of Ascaris, during the formation of the polar 
 bodies, sometimes showed numerous accessory asters scattered 
 through the cytoplasm. Reinke ('94) described somewhat similar 
 asters in peritoneal cells of the salamander, distinguishing among 
 them three orders of magnitude, the largest containing distinct 
 centrosomes or "primary centres," while the smaller contained 
 "secondary" and "tertiary" centres, the last named being single

microsomes at the nodes of the cytoreticulum. By successive aggre- 
 gations of the tertiary and secondary centres arise true centrosomes 
 as new formations. Watase ('94-95) also finds in the &%% of JMacro- 
 bdella, besides the normal aster containing an undoubted centrosome, 
 numerous smaller asters graduating downwards to such " tertiary 
 asters " as Reinke describes with a microsome at the centre of each, 
 and on this basis concludes that the true centrosome differs from a 
 microsome only in degree and may arise dc novo. Mottier ('97, 2) 
 finds in pollen-mother-cells numerous minute " cyto-asters " having 
 no direct relation to the spindle-formation (Fig. 133). Again Juel
