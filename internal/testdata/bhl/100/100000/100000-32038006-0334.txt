SOME PROBLEMS OF CELL-ORGANIZATION 

('97) finds that an isolated chromosome, accidentally separated from 
 the equatorial plate (pollen-mother-cells of Hcmerocallis), may give 
 rise to a small vesicular nucleus which may subsequently divide by 
 mitosis, though it is quite out of relation to the spindle-poles of the 
 preceding mitosis (Fig. 149). Strong evidence of the same character 
 as the last is given by the facts in the- heliozoon Acanthocystis, as 
 shown by Schaudinn ('96, 3), the ordinary vegetative cells containing 
 a persistent extra-nuclear centrosome, while in the bud-formation of 
 the swarm-spores a centrosome is formed de novo, without relation to 
 that of the mother-cell, inside the nucleus of the bud (Fig. 41). 

The strongest case in favour of the independent origin of centro- 
 somes is, however, given by the observations of Mead on ChcEtopteriis 
 ('98) and the remarkable experiments of R. Hertwig ('95, '96) and

Morgan ('96, i ; '99, i) on the eggs of echinoderms and other animals. 
 When eggs of CJicBtopterus are taken from the body-cavity and placed 
 in sea-water, a multitude of small asters appear in the cytoplasm, two 
 of which are believed to persist as those of the polar spindle, while 
 the others degenerate (Fig. 150). Mead is therefore convinced 
 that the polar centrosomes arise in this case separately and de novo} 
 R. Hertwig showed that when unfertilized eggs of sea-urchins 
 {Strongylocentrotris, EcJdnus) are kept for some time in sea-water or 
 treated with dilute solutions of strychnine the nuclei undergo some of 

1 A number of other authors {^e.g. Griffin, Thalassema, Coe, Cerebratulus) have likewise 
 found the first polar asters -widely separated at their first appearance. On the other hand, 
 Mathe-ws ('95), whose preparations I have seen, finds the polar centrosomes in Asterias 
 close together, and Francotte ('97, '98) has demonstrated that in Cycloportis and Prosihece- 
 rcBus they arise by the division of a single primary centrosome. The same is stated by Gar- 
 diner ('98) to be the case in Polyckcerus. It should be noted, further, that Mead could find 
 no undoubted centrosomes save in the " primary " or definitive polar asters.
