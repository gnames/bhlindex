THE CENTROSOME 307 

the changes of mitosis, the chromatin-network giving rise to a group 
 of chromosomes and a spindle, or more frequently a fan-shaped 
 half-spindle, arising from the achromatic substance. In some cases 
 not only a complete spindle appeared but also asters at the poles, 
 though no centrosomes were observed (Fig. 151). Morgan's experi- 
 ments along the same lines were mainly performed upon the sea- 
 urchin Arhacia, but included also the eggs of Asterias, Sipuncuhts, 
 and Cerebratnhis (Figs. 150, 151). In these eggs numerous asters 
 may arise in the cytoplasm, if they are allowed to lie some time in sea-

 These asters often contain deeply staining, central granules indistin- 
 guishable from the centrosomes of the normal asters ; and, what is of 
 high interest, such of them as He near the nucleus take part in the 
 irregular nuclear division that ensues, forming centres toward which 
 the chromosomes pass. These divisions continue for some time, the 
 chromosomes being irregularly distributed through the &gg, and giving 
 rise to nuclei of various sizes apparently dependent upon the number 
 of chromosomes each receives. After a variable number of such
