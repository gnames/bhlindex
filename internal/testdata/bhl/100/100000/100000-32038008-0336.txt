SOME PROBLEMS OF CELL-ORGANIZATION 

divisions the asters disappear, yet the irregular nuclear divisions con- 
 tinue, nuclear spindles with distinct centrosomes being formed at each 
 division, but apparently without relation to the older asters, and they

'■^ Morgan makes the important observation, which harmonizes with that of Boveri, 
 reported at page 108, that the divisions occur with 7-espect to the mimber and position of the 
 nuclei, not of the asters, concluding that the former must therefore play an essential rdle as 
 centres of division, and that the activity of the asters is in itself not sufficient to account 
 for division of the cytoplasm.
