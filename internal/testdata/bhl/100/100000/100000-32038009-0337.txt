referred to at page 215, finds that after treatment with magnesium 
 chloride unfertilized sea-urchin eggs {Arbacia) may give rise to perfect 
 Pluteiis larvae — a result which if well founded seems to place the 
 new formation of true centrosomes beyond question. 

Taken together, these researches give strong ground for the con- 
 clusion that true {i.e. physiological) centrosomes may arise de novo 
 from either the cytoplasmic or the nuclear substance and may play 
 the usual role (whatever that may be) in mitosis. If this conclusion 
 be sustained by future research, we shall no longer be able to accept 
 Van Beneden's and Boveri's conception of the centrosome as a per- 
 sistent organ in the same sense as the nucleus ; but on the other hand 
 we shall have gained important ground for further inquiry into the 
 nature and source of that power of division which is so characteristic 
 of living things and upon which the law of genetic continuity rests. 

Morphology of the Centrosome. — In its simplest form (Fig. 152, A) 
 the centrosome appears under the highest powers as nothing more than 
 a single granule of extraordinary minuteness which stains intensely 
 with iron-haematoxylin, and can scarcely be distinguished from the 
 cyto-microsomes except for the fact that it lies at the focus of the 
 astral rays. In this form it always appears at the centre of the very 
 young sperm-asters during fertilization (Figs. 97, 99), in the early 
 phases of ordinary mitosis (Figs. 27, 32), and in some cases also in the 
 resting cell, for example, in leucocytes and connective tissue corpuscles 
 (Figs. 8, 49), where, however, it is often triple or quadruple. In the 
 course of division the centrosome often increases in size and assumes 
 a more complex form, becoming also surrounded by various structures 
 involved in the aster-formation. The relation of these structures to 
 the centrosome itself has not yet been fully cleared up and there 
 is still much divergence of opinion regarding the cycle of changes 
 through which the centrosome passes. It is, therefore, not yet possi- 
 ble to give a very consistent account of the centrosome, still less to 
 frame a satisfactory morphological definition of it. 

It is convenient to take up as a starting-point Boveri's ('88) account 
 of the centrosomes in the o,^^ of Ascaris, supplemented by Brauer's 
 ('93) description of those in the spermatocytes of the same animal. 
 During the early prophases of the first cleavage Boveri found the 
 centrosome as a minute granule which steadily enlarges as the spin- 
 dle forms, until shortly before the metaphase it becomes a rather large, 
 well-defined sphere in the centre of which a minute central granule or 
 ccntriole appears (Fig. 152, B, C). From this time onward the cen- 
 trosome decreases in size until in the daughter-cells it is again reduced 
 to a small granule which divides into two and goes through a similar 
 cycle during the second cleavage and so on. The centrosome is 
 at all stages surrounded by a clear zone ("Heller Hof ") in which
