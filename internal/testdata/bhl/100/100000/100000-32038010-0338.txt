SOME PROBLEMS OF CELL-ORGANIZATION 

the astral rays are thinner and stain less deeply than farther 
 out. Brauer's account is substantially the same, though no definite 
 " Heller Hof " was found, and the astral rays were traced directly in 
 to the boundary of the centrosome. He added, however, two impor- 
 tant observations, viz. (i) that the central granule is visible at every 
 period ; and (2) division of the centrosome is preceded by division of 
 the central gramile {¥ig. 148) — an observation recently extended by 
 Boveri to the division of the egg-centrosome.^ Van Beneden and 
 Neyt {'^7), on the other hand, gave a quite different account of the

A. Centrosome, a simple granule at the centre of the aster; ex. sperm-aster in various animals. 
 B. "Centrosome," a sphere enclosing a central granule or centriole ; ex. Brauer's account of 
 spermatocytes oi Ascaris. C Like the last, but "centrosome" surrounded by a " Heller Hof"; 
 ex. Boveri's account of the centrosome of the Ascaris egg. D. Central granule surrounded by a 
 radial sphere ("centrosome") bounded by a microsome-circle, and lying in a "Heller Hof"; 
 ex. polar spindles of Thysanozoon, Van der Stricht. E. Central granule (" centrosome ") sur- 
 rounded by medullary and cortical radial zones, each bounded by a microsome-circle; ex. polar 
 spindle of U7iio, Lillie. F. Van Beneden's representation of aster of the Ascaris egg ; like the last, 
 but the " corpuscule central" consisting of a group of granules. G. "Centrosome," a group of 
 granules surrounded by a "Heller Hof"; ex. the echinoderm-egg. H. "Centrosome" (central 
 granule) surrounded by a vague larger body lying in a reticulated centrosphere ; ex. Thalassema.

structures at the centre of the aster. The " corpuscule central " 
 (usually assumed by later writers to be the centrosome), described as 
 a "mass of granules," is surrounded by two well-defined astral zones, 
 formed as modifications of the inner part of the aster, and constitut- 
 ing the "attraction-sphere." These are an inner "medullary zone," 
 and an outer " cortical zone," each bounded by a very distinct layer 
 of microsomes (Fig. 152, F^.
