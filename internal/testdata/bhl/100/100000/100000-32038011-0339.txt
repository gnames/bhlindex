THE CENTROSOME 3II 

The discrepancy between these results on the part of the two 
 pioneer investigators of the centrosome has led to great confusion 
 in the terminology of the subject, which has not yet been fully 
 cleared away. Many of the observers who followed Boveri (Flem- 
 ming, Hermann, Van der Stricht, Heidenhain, etc.) found the centro- 
 some, in various cells, as a much smaller body than he had described, 
 often as a single or double minute granule, staining intensely with 
 iron-haematoxylin. Heidenhain ('93, '94) and Driiner ('94, '95) found 
 further that the asters in leucocytes and other forms often show 
 several concentric circles of microsomes, and that the sphere bounded 
 by the innermost circle often stains more deeply than the outer por- 
 tions and may appear nearly or quite homogeneous (Fig. 156). To 
 this sphere, with its contained central granule or granules Heidenhain 
 applies the term microcentrum ('94, p. 463), while Kostanecki and 
 Siedlecki suggest the term microsphere ('96, p. 217). Still later 
 Kostanecki and Siedlecki ('97) found that even in Ascaris, as in other 
 forms, sufficient extraction of the colour (iron-haematoxylin) reduces the 
 centrosome to a minute granule to which the astral rays converge, 
 and which is presumably identical with Boveri's "central granule." 
 Heidenhain ('93, '94) found that in leucocytes the central granule is 
 often double, triple, or even quadruple, while in giant-cells of certain 
 kinds there are numerous deeply staining granules (Fig. 14). He 
 therefore proposed to restrict the term centrvsome to the individ- 
 ual granules, whatever be their number, applying the term microcai- 
 trum to the entire group ('94, p. 463). 

With these facts in mind we can gain a clear view of the manner 
 in which both the confusion of terminology and the contradiction of 
 results has arisen. Brauer ('93) found in Ascaris (see above) that 
 division of the central granule precedes division of the "centrosome,'' 
 and therefore suggested that only the former is equivalent to Van 
 Beneden's " corpuscule central," while the body called "centrosome" 
 by Boveri is really the medullary astral zone, the " Heller Hof " being 
 the cortical zone. This is substantially the same conclusion reached 
 by Heidenhain, Rawitz, Lenhossek, Kostanecki and Siedlecki, Erlan- 
 ger. Van der Stricht, Lillie, and several others. The confusion of 
 the subject is owing, on the one hand, to the fact that those who 
 have accepted this conclusion continue to use the word centrosome 
 in two quite different senses, on the other hand to the fact that the 
 conclusion is itself repudiated by Boveri ('95), MacFarland ('97), and 
 Fiirst ('98). 

As regards the terminology we find that most recent writers agree 
 with Heidenhain, Kostanecki and Siedlecki, in restricting the word 
 centrosome to the minute, deeply staining granules, whether one or 
 more, at the centre of the aster. On the other hand, Brauer, Fran-
