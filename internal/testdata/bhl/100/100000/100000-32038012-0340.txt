SOME PROBLEMS OF CELL-ORGANIZATION 

cotte, Van der Stricht, Meves, and others apply the term to the central 
 granule or granules plus the surrounding sphere (" centrosome " of 
 Boveri), which they regard as equivalent to the medullary zone of 
 Van Beneden, the " corpuscule central " of the last-named author 
 being identified with the central granule or "centriole" of Boveri, 
 though the latter structure is considerably smaller than the former 
 as described by Van Beneden. 

The matter of fact turns largely on the question whether the astral 
 rays traverse the larger sphere to the central granule. That such is 
 the case in Ascaris is positively asserted by Kostanecki and Siedlecki, 
 ('97) and as positively denied by Fiirst ('98) with whose observations

 granule double within the " centrosome." C. Elongation of old " centrosome " to form second 
 polar spindle. 

those of MacFarland ('97) on gasteropod-eggs agree. On the other 
 hand, in the turbellarians the observations of Francotte ('97, '98) and 
 Van der Stricht ('98, i) seem to leave no doubt that the larger sphere 
 ("centrosome"), here very sharply defined and staining deeply in 
 iron-haematoxylin, is traversed by well-defined astral rays converging 
 to the central corpuscle, and both these observers agree further that 
 both the corpuscle and the sphere divide to persist as the " centrosomes " 
 of the daughter-cells — a result in conformity with Van Beneden's con- 
 clusion in the case of Ascaris. 

Lillie's valuable observations on the polar asters of Unio ('98) afford, 
 I believe, conclusive evidence as to the nature of the sphere. In the
