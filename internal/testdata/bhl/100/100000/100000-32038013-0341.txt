A. Aster of the first polar figure; central granule (centrosome) surrounded by medullary 
 (entosphere) and cortical (ectosphere) zones. B. Late anaphase of second polar mitosis; radial 
 entosphere bounded by continuous membrane. C. D. Prophases of second mitosis ; formation

rays pass (Fig. 152, E, Fig. 154). The inner sphere, consisting of 
 a dense and deeply staining substance, has at first a typical radiate 
 structure and is bounded by a microsome-circle. In later stages (late 
 anaphase) the central granule divides into two and afterward into 
 four or more granules, of which, however, only one or two actually
