persist. The inner sphere is now bounded by a definite membrane, 
 and its radiate structure becomes obscure, the astral rays extending 
 only to the boundary of the sphere, though a few rays persist within 
 it (Fig. 154, B). It is clear from this that the inner sphere and 
 central granule pass through phases that bridge the gap between 
 Van Beneden's and Boveri's descriptions. Lillie's observations fully 
 sustain the conclusion that the central granule {"centriole'' of B overt) 
 corresponds to the '^ corpttscide centraV of Van Befteden, and the in7ier 
 sphere {medullary zone) to B overt s " centrosotne.'' A comparison of 
 the polar aster of Unio with that of Thysanozoon, as described by 
 Van der Stricht ('98), leaves hardly room for doubt that the cortical 
 zone represents Boveri's "Heller Hof " ; for in both forms the rays 
 of the cortical zone are much thinner and lighter than the more 
 peripheral portions, thus giving a clear zone, which in Unio is bounded 
 by only a fairly definite microsome-circle and in Thysanozoon by none. 
 Lastly, we must recognize the justice of the view urged by Kos- 
 tanecki, Griffin, Mead, Lillie, Coe, and others, that the term centro- 
 so7ne should be applied to the central granule and not to the sphere 
 surrounding it (medullary zone), despite the fact that historically the 
 word was first applied by Boveri to the latter structure. For in both 
 Dianlnla (MacFarland) and Unio (Lillie) the second polar spindle 
 arises from the substance of the inner sphere, while the central 
 granule, becoming double, gives rise to the centrosomes at its poles. 
 By following Boveri's terminology, therefore, MacFarland is driven to 
 the strange conclusion that the second polar spindle is nothing other 
 than an enormously enlarged " centrosome " â€” a result little short of 
 a rediictio ad absurdtmt when we consider that in Ascaris the polar 
 spindle arises by a direct transformation of the germinal vesicle 
 (p. 277). The obvious interpretation is that the central granule is 
 the only structure that should be called a centrosome, the surround- 
 ing sphere being a part of the aster, or rather of the attraction-sphere. 
 Thus regarded, the origin of the spindle in Dianhila presents nothing 
 anomalous and a similar interpretation may be placed on the polar 
 spindles of Ascaris as described by Fiirst ('98).^ 

1 In echinoderms the concurrent results of Reinke ('95), Boveri ('95), myself ('96-'97), 
 show that the " centrosome " is a well-defined sphere containing a large group (ten to twenty) 
 of irregularly scattered, deeply staining granules. I have shown in this case that in the early 
 prophases there is but one such granule, which then becomes double and finally multiple, 
 forming a pluricorpuscular centrum (Fig. 52) not unlike that described by Heidenhain 
 in giant-cells. Kostanecki, who asserts that the centrosome of echinoderms is a single 
 granule ('96, i, '96, 2, p. 248), has not sufficiently studied the later phases of mitosis. 
 Cf. also Erlanger ('98). The centrosomes described in nerve cells by Lenhossek ('95) are 
 apparently of somewhat similar type. Until the facts are more fully known the exact nature 
 of these "centrosomes" remains an open question. Lillie's observations on Unio show 
 that here, too (first polar spindle), the centrosome divides to form a considerable number of
