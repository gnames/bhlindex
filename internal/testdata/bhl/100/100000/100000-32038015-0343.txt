THE CENTROSOME 315 

The genesis of the concentric spheres surrounding the centrosome 
 will be considered in the following section. We may here only 
 emphasize the remarkable fact that the centres of the dividing 
 system are bodies which are in many cases so small as to lie almost 
 at the limits of microscopical vision, and which in the absence of the 
 surrounding structures could not be distinguished from other proto- 
 plasmic granules. Full weight should be given to this fact in every 
 estimate of the centrosome theory, and it is no less interesting in its 
 bearing upon the corpuscular theory of protoplasm. 

Watase ('93, '94) made the very interesting suggestion that the cen- 
 trosome is itself nothing other than a microsome of the same morpho- 
 logical nature as those of the astral rays and the general meshwork, 
 differing from them only in size and in its peculiar powers. ^ Despite 
 the vagueness of the word "microsome," which has no well-defined 
 meaning, Watase's suggestion is full of interest, indicating as it does 
 that the centrosome is morphologically comparable to other elemen- 
 tary bodies existing in the cytoplasmic stiaicture, and which, minute 
 though they are, may have specific chemical and physiological prop- 
 erties. 

An interesting hypothesis regarding the historical origin of centrosome is that of 
 Butschli ("91) and R. Hertwig ('92), who suggest that it may be a derivative of a 
 body comparable with the micro-nucleus of Infusoria, which has lost its chromatin 
 but retained the power of division ; and the last-named author has suggested fuiiher 
 that the so-called " archoplasmic loops " discovered by Platner in pulmonates may 
 be remnants of the chromatic elements. A similar view has been advocated bv 
 Heidenhain ('93, '94) and Lauterborn ('96). Heidenhain regards central spindle 
 and centrosomes as forming e.ssentially a unit ("microcentrum ") homologous with 
 the micro-nucleus of the Infusoria, the centrodesmus (p. 79) representing a part of 
 the original achromatic elements. The metazoan nucleus is compared to the proto- 
 zoan macro-nucleus. The improbability of a direct derivation of the Metazoa from 
 Infusoria, urged by Boveri C95) and Hertwig ('96), has led Lauterborn ("96) to the 
 view that the metazoan centrosome and nucleus are respectively derivatives of two 
 equivalent nuclei, such as Schaudinn ("95) describes in Amcsba binucleata, the 
 " Nebenkorper â– " of Paratnccba {cf. p. 94), being regarded as an intermediate step, 
 and the micro-nucleus of Infusoria a side-branch. R. Hertwig ('96), on the other 
 hand, regards the metazoon centrosome as a derivative of an intra-nuclear body such 
 as the '' nucleolo-centrosome " of Eugleita (p. 91), which has itself arisen through 
 a condensation of the general achromatic substance. With this view Calkins ("98). 
 on the whole, agrees; but he regards it as probable that the '"nucleolo-centrosome " 

gianules of which one or two remain as the persistent centrosome, while others are converted 
 into microsomes or other cytoplasmic structures. It is probable that something similar 
 occurs in the echinoderms. 

1 The microsome is conceived, if I understand Watase rightly, not as a permanent mor- 
 phological body, but as a temporary varicosity of the thread, which may lose its identitv in 
 the thread and reappear when the thread contracts. The centrosome is in like manner not 
 a permanent organ like the nucleus, but a temporary body formed at the focus of the astral 
 rays. Once formed, however, it may long persist even after disappearance of the aster, and 
 serve as a centre of formation for a new aster.
