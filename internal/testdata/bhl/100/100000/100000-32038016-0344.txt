3l6 SOME PROBLEMS OF CELL-ORGANIZATION 

of Eiiglena and Amceba and the sphere of Noctihica and Paraniosba are to be com- 
 pared with the attraction-sphere, while the centrosome may have had a different 
 origin. 

It appears to me that none of these views rests upon a very substantial basis, and 
 they must be taken rather as suggestions for further work than as well-grounded 
 conclusions. 

F. The Archoplasmic Structures 
 I . Hypothesis of Fibrillar Persistence 

The asters and attraction-spheres have a special interest for the 
 study of cell-organs ; for they are structures that may divide and 
 persist from cell to cell or may lose their identity and re-form in suc- 
 cessive cell-generations, and we may here trace with the greatest 
 clearness the origin of a cell-organ by differentiation out of the struc- 
 tural basis. Two sharply opposing views of these structures have 
 been held, represented among the earlier observers on the one hand 
 by Boveri, on the other by Biitschli, Klein, Van Beneden, and Carnoy. 
 The latter observers held that the astral rays and spindle-fibres, and 
 hence the attraction-sphere, arise through a morphological rearrange- 
 ment of the preexisting protoplasmic meshwork, under the influence of 
 the centrosome. This view, which may be traced back to the early 
 work of Fol ('73) and Auerbach ('74), was first clearly formulated 
 by Biitschli i^7^), who regarded the aster as the optical expression of 
 a peculiar physico-chemical alteration of the protoplasm primarily 
 caused by diffusion-currents converging to the central area of the 
 aster. ^ An essentially similar view is maintained in Biitschli's recent 
 great work on protoplasm,^ the astral " rays " being regarded as 
 nothing more than the meshes of an alveolar structure arranged 
 radially about the centrosomes (Fig. 10, B\ The fibrous appearance 
 of the astral rays is an optical illusion, for they are not fibres, but flat 
 lamellae forming the walls of elongated closed chambers. This view 
 has recently been urged, especially by Erlanger ('97, 4, etc.), who 
 sees in all forms of asters and spindles nothing more than a modified 
 alveolar structure. 

The same general conception of the aster is adopted by most of 
 those who accept the fibrillar or reticular theory of protoplasm, the 
 astral rays and spindle-fibres being regarded as actual fibres forming 
 part of the general network. One of the first to frame such a con- 
 ception was Klein {^'J^\ who regarded the aster as due to "a radial 
 arrangement of what corresponds to the cell-substance," the latter
