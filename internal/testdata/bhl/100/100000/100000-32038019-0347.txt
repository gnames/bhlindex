THE ARCHOPLASMIC STRUCTURES 319 

Boveri's celebrated archoplasm-hypothesis. Boveri has from the first 
 maintained that the amphiastral fibres are quite distinct from the gen- 
 eral cell-meshwork. In his earlier papers he maintained ('88, 2) that 
 the attraction-sphere of the resting cell is composed of a distinct sub- 
 stance, " arcJioplasm,'' consisting of granules or microsomes aggre- 
 gated about the centrosome as the result of an attractive force exerted 
 by the latter. From the material of the attraction-sphere arises the 
 entire achromatic figure, including both the spindle-fibres and the 
 astral rays, and these have nothing to do with the general reticulum 
 of the cell. They grow out from the attraction-sphere into the reticu- 
 lum as the roots of a plant grow into the soil, and at the close of 
 mitosis are again withdrawn into the central mass, breaking up into 
 granules meanwhile, so that each daughter-cell receives one-half of 
 the entire archoplasmic material of the parent-cell. Boveri was 
 further inclined to believe that the individual granules or archoplas- 
 mic microsomes were " independent structures, not the nodal points of a 
 general network," and that the archoplasmic rays arose by the arrange- 
 ment of these granules in rows without loss of their identity.^ In a 
 later paper on the sea-urchin this view underwent a considerable 
 modification through the admission that the archoplasm may not pre- 
 exist as formed material, but that the rays and fibres may be a new 
 formation, crystallizing, as it were, out of the protoplasm about the 
 centrosome as a centre, but having no organic relation with the gen- 
 eral reticulum ; though Boveri still held open the possibility that the 
 archoplasm might preexist in the form of a specific homogeneous sub- 
 stance distributed through the cell, though not ordinarily demonstra- 
 ble by reagents.^ In this form the archoplasm-theory approaches 
 very nearly that of Strasburger, described below. 

There are three orders of facts that tell in favour of Boveri's modi- 
 fied theory : first, the existence of persistent archoplasm-masses or 
 attraction-spheres from which the amphiasters arise ; second, the 
 origin of amphiasters in alveolar protoplasm ; and, third, the increas- 
 ing number of accounts asserting the replacement of the old asters 
 by others of quite new formation. In at least one case, namely, that 
 of Noctiluca, the entire achromatic figure is formed from a permanent 
 attraction-sphere lying outside the nucleus and perfectly distinct from 
 the general cell-meshwork.^ Other cases of this kind are very rare, 
 and in most cases the attraction-sphere sooner or later disintegrates,'* 
 but in the formation of the spermatozoa we have many examples of 
 archoplasmic masses (Nebenkern, attraction-sphere, idiozome), which 
 apparently consist of a specific substance having a special relation to 
 the achromatic figure.
