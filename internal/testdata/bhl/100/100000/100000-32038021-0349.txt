THE ARCHOPLASMIC STRUCTURES 32 1 

formation of the rays was Driiner, who maintained in the case of the 
 mitosis of salamander testis-cells, that " not a single fibre of the astral 
 system of the mother-cell is carried over unchanged into the organism 
 of the daughter-cell" ('95, p. 309). The same conclusion was soon 
 afterward supported by Braus ('95) in the case of the cleavage- 
 mitoses of Triton. The most convincing evidence of this fact has 
 been given by studies on the maturation and fertilization of the o-gg 
 by Griffin ('96, '99), MacFarland ('97), Lillie ('99), and Coe ('99), all of 
 whom find that the new astral centres, arising by division of the cen- 
 trosome, move away from the old position, to zvhicJi, hozvever, the old 
 rays still converge ivJiile the new asters are independently forming 
 (Fig. 155). This is shown with especial clearness in the 0.%^ of Cere- 
 bratnhts (Coe), where the peripheral portions of the old asters persist 
 until the new amphiaster is completely formed. This observation 
 seems conclusively to overturn Kostanecki's hypothesis of the persist- 
 ence and division of the rays, and together with the work of MacFar- 
 land gives a very strong support to Boveri's later view. 

It still remains an open question whether the rays actually arise 
 from the substance of the centrosome, from a specific surrounding 
 archoplasm, or by differentiation out of the general substance of the 
 meshwork. The first of these possibilities has been urged in a very 
 interesting way by Watase ('94), who believes that the centrosome 
 "spins out the cytoplasmic filaments "^ of the spindle and aster, and 
 that ordinary microsomes may in like manner spin out the fibrillas of 
 ordinary cytoplasmic networks.^ This view is sustained by the mode 
 of origin of the axial filament in the spermatozoa and that of the cilia 
 in plant spermatozoids. It is, on the other hand, opposed by the 
 almost infinitesimal bulk of the centrosome as compared with that of 
 the aster that may form about it, and by the formation of the spindles 
 in higher plants in the apparent absence of centrosomes. On the 
 whole, the facts do not seem at present to warrant the acceptance of 
 Watase's ingenious hypothesis, and the most probable view is that 
 of Driiner and Boveri, that the rays are differentiated out of the walls 
 of the meshwork. In cases where the protoplasm is reticular or 
 fibrillar the differentiation of the rays may be indistinguishable from 
 a mere rearrangement of the thread-work ; in alveolar protoplasm 
 they may be seen as new formations, while in either case the 
 material of the old aster may be more or less directly utilized in the 
 building of the new. The feature common to all is the periodic 
 activity either of the centre itself or of the surrounding protoplasm, 
 and the coincidence or non-coincidence of the new aster with the old 
 is apparently a secondary matter.
