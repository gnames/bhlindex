322 SOME PROBLEMS OF CELL-ORGANIZATION 

In its original form the archoplasm hypothesis, as stated by Boveri, 
 was developed with reference only to the material of the spindle- 
 fibres and astral rays. Later writers have greatly extended the con- 
 ception on the basis of Boveri's earlier view that archoplasm is a 
 specific form of protoplasm, possessing specially active properties. 
 Strasburger ('92-98), whose views have already been considered in 
 part, believes the protoplasm to consist of, or to show a tendency to 
 differentiate itself into, two distinct substances, namely, a specially 
 active fibrillar kinoplasm and a less active alveolar trophoplasin. 
 The former gives rise to the mitotic fibrillas, constitutes the periph- 
 eral cell layer, or Hantschicht, from which the membrane arises, 
 forms the substance of the centrosomes, and gives origin to the con- 
 tractile substance of cilia and flagella. The kinoplasm is thus mainly 
 concerned with the motor phenomena of the cell, the trophoplasm 
 with those of nutrition ; and this physiological difference is morpho- 
 logically expressed in the fact that the former has in general a 
 fibrillar structure, the latter an alveolar. Beyond this the two forms 
 of protoplasm show a difference of staining-reaction, the kinoplasmic 
 fibrillae staining deeply with gentian-violet and iron-hsematoxylin, 
 while the trophoplasm is but slightly stained. 

Prenant ('98, '99) still further extends the hypothesis, adopting the 
 view that the " ergastoplasmic " (Garnier) fibrillae of gland-cells^ are 
 equivalent to the kinoplasmic or archoplasmic fibrillas of the mitotic 
 figure, and to the fibrillae of nerve- and muscle-fibres as well. He is 
 thus led to the conception of a dominating or " superior " cytoplasm 
 (including "archoplasm," "kinoplasm," "ergastoplasm"), which arises 
 by differentiation out of the general cytoplasm, plays the leading ivle 
 in the elaboration of active cell-elements (" cytosomes "), such as 
 mitotic, neural, and glandular fibrillae, and finally, its role accom- 
 plished, may disappear. Under the same category with the foregoing 
 structures are placed the centrosome, attraction-sphere, mid-body, 
 idiozome, Nebenkern, and yolk-nucleus. 

Such a generous expansion of the archoplasm-hypothesis brings it 
 perilously near to a redtictio ad abstirdmn ; for the step is not a great 
 one to the identification of the " superior protoplasm " with the active 
 cell-substance in general, which would render the whole hypothesis 
 superfluous. Physiologically, we can drav/ no definite line of demar- 
 cation between the more and the less active protoplasmic elements, 
 and it may further be doubted whether such a boundary exists even 
 between the latter and the metaplasmic substances.^ It is further 
 quite unjustifiable to infer physiological likeness from similarity in 
 staining-reaction 2 or in fibrillar structure. For these reasons the 
 hypothesis of " superior protoplasm " seems one of doubtful utility.
