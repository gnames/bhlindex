THE ARCHOPLASMIC STRUCTURES 323 

In its more restricted form, however, the archoplasm or kinoplasm 
 hypothesis is of high interest as indicating a common element in the 
 origin and function of the mitotic fibrillse, the centrosome and mid- 
 body, and the contractile substances of cilia, flagella, and muscle- 
 fibres. The main interest of the hypothesis seems to me to lie in the 
 definite genetic relations that have been traced between the archo- 
 plasmic structures of successive cell-generations (as is most clearly 
 shown in the phenomena of maturation and fertilization). It has 
 been pointed out at various places in the preceding chapters ^ how 
 many apparently contradictory phenomena in cell-division, fertiliza- 
 tion, and related processes can be brought into relation with one 
 another under the assumption of a specific substance, carried by the 
 centrosome or less definitely localized, which gives the stimulus to 
 division, which is concerned in the formation of the mitotic figure 
 and of contractile elements, and which may be transmitted from cell 
 to cell without loss of its specific character. There seems, however, 
 to be clear evidence that such substance (or substances), if it exists, 
 is not to be regarded as being necessarily a permanent constituent of 
 the cell, but only as a phase, more or less persistent, in the general 
 metabolic transformation of the cell-substance.^ 

3. The Attraction-spJiere 

As originally used by Van Beneden ^ the term attraction-sphere was 
 applied (in Asearis) to the central mass of the aster surrounding the 
 "corpuscule central" and consisting of medullary and cortical zones, 
 as already described (p. 310). The cortical zone is bounded by a dis- 
 tinct circle of microsomes from which the astral rays proceed ; and at 
 the close of cell-division the rays were stated to fade away, leaving 
 only the attraction-sphere, which, like the centrosome, was regarded 
 as a permanent cell-organ. Later researches have conclusively shown 
 that the attraction-sphere cannot be regarded as a permanent organ, 
 since in many cases it disintegrates and disappears. This occurs, for 
 example, in the early prophases of mitosis in the testis-cells of the sala- 
 mander,^ where the sphere breaks up and scatters through the cell as 
 the new amphiaster forms (Fig. 27). A very interesting case of this 
 kind occurs in the cleavage of the ovum in Crepidula, as described by 
 Conklin ('99). The spheres here persist for a considerable period 
 after division (Fig. 192), but have no direct relation to those of the 
 ensuing division, finally disappearing in situ. The new spheres are 
 formed about the centrosomes, which Conklin believes to migrate 
 out of the old spheres (somewhat as occurs in the spermatid, p. 167) to 
 their new position. The interesting point here is that the old sphere
