THE ARCHOPLASMIC STRUCTURES

other cases a sphere closely simulating an attraction-sphere may- 
 arise in the cytoplasm without apparent relation to the centrosomes 
 or to the preceding aster, e.g. the yolk-nucleus or the sphere from 
 which the acrosome arises in mammalian spermatogenesis.^ To call 
 such structures "attraction-spheres" or " archoplasm-masses " is to 
 beg an important question ; and in all such doubtful cases the simple 
 word sphere should be used.^ In case of the aster itself we may, for 
 descriptive purposes, employ Strasburger's convenient and non-com- 
 mittal term centrosphere, to designate in a somewhat vague and general 
 way the central mass of the aster surrounding the centrosome, leaving 
 its exact relation to Van Beneden's attraction-sphere to be determined 
 in each individual case. Where the centrosphere shows two concen- 
 tric zones (medullary and cortical), they may be well designated with 
 Ziegler as entospJiere {" centrosome" of Boveri) and ectospJiere. 

As regards the structure of the centrosphere, two well-marked types 
 have been described. In one of these, described by Van Beneden in 
 Ascaris, by Heidenhain in leucocytes, by Driiner and Braus in divid- 
 ing cells of Amphibia, and by Francotte, Van der Stricht, Lillie, Kos- 
 tanecki, and others, in various segmenting eggs, the centrosphere has 
 a radiate structure, being traversed by rays which stretch between the 
 centrosome and the peripheral microsome-circle (Fig. 152, D, E, F), 
 when the latter exists. In the other form, described by Vejdovsky in 
 the eggs of Rhynchelmis, by Solger and Zimmermann in pigment-cells, 
 by myself in Nereis, by Riickert in Cyclops, by Mead in CJioetopterus, 
 Griffin in Thalassema, Coe in CerebratuliLS, Gardiner in Po/yc/icer?is, 
 and many others, the centrosphere has a non-radial reticular or vesicu- 
 lar structure, in which the centrosomes lie (Figs. 152, H, 155). Kos- 
 tanecki and others have endeavoured to show that such structures are 
 artifacts, insisting that in perfectly iixed material the astral rays always 
 traverse the centrosphere to the centrosome. This interpretation is, 
 however, contradicted by the fact that the new asters developing in 
 the centrospheres during the anaphases and telophases of such forms 
 as Thalassema or CerebraUihis (Figs. 99, 155) show perfect fixation of 
 the rays. The reticular centrosphere almost certainly arises as a nor- 
 mal differentiation of the interior of the aster, which, as Griffin ('96) 
 has suggested, probably marks the beginning of the degeneration of 
 â€¢the whole astral apparatus, to make way for the newly developing 
 system. 

The radial centrosphere is in Ascaris divided into cortical and medul- 
 lary zones, as already described (p. 310), the aster being bounded by 
 a distinct circle of microsomes. The true interpretation of these zones 
 was given through Heidenhain's beautiful studies on the asters in leu- 
 cocytes, and the still more thorough later work of Driiner on the sper-
