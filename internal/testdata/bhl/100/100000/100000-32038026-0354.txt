SOME PROBLEMS OF CELL-ORGANIZATION 

matocyte-divisions of the salamander. In leucocytes (Fig. 49) the 
 large persistent aster has at its centre a well-marked radial sphere 
 bounded by a circle of microsomes, as described by Van Beneden, but 
 without division into cortical and medullary zones. The astral rays, 

however, show indications of other 
 circles of microsomes lying outside 
 the centrosphere. Drtiner found 
 that a whole series of such concen- 
 tric circles might exist (in the cell 
 shown in Fig. 1 56 no less than nine), 
 but that the innermost two are often 
 especially distinct, so as to mark off 
 a centrosphere composed of a medul- 
 lary and a cortical zone precisely as 
 described by Van Beneden. These 
 observations show conclusively that 
 the centrosphere of the radial type 
 is merely the innermost portion of 
 the aster, which acquires a boundary 
 through the especial development 
 of a ring of microsomes, or other- 
 wise, and which often further 
 acquires an intense staining-capac- 
 ity so as to appear like a centrosome 
 (P- 313)- III Thysanozo'67i{y2iX\.diQX 
 Stricht) only a single ring of micro- 
 somes exists, and this lies at the 
 boundary between the medullary 
 and cortical zones (Fig. 152, D), the latter differing from the outer 
 region only in the greater delicacy of the rays and their lack of 
 staining-capacity, thus producing a " Heller Hof." In other cases, no 
 " microsome-circles " exist; but even here a clear zone often surrounds 
 the centrosome {e.g. in Physa, t. Kostanecki and Wierzejski), like that 
 seen in the cortical zone of Thysanozobn. 

There are some observations indicating that the entosphere (medul- 
 lary zone) may be directly derived from the centrosome (central 
 granule). This is the conclusion reached by Lillie in the case of Unio 
 referred to above, where, during the prophases of the second polar 
 spindle, the central granule enlarges and breaks up into a group of 
 granules from which the new entosphere is formed. Van der Stricht 
 ('98) reaches a similar conclusion in case of the first polar spindle of 
 Thysajiosodn. We may perhaps give the same interpretation to the 
 large pluricorpuscular centrum of echinoderms (p. 314). This obser- 
 vation may be used in support of the probability that the astral rays

The nucleus lies below. Above is the enor- 
 mous aster, the centrosome at its centre, its 
 rays showing indications of nine concentric 
 circles of microsomes. The area within the 
 second circle probably represents the " attrac- 
 tion-sphere " of Van Beneden.
