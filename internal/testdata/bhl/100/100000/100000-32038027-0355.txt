may be actually derived from the centrosome (p. 321) ; but Lillie finds 
 in some cases that in the same mitosis the entosphere is formed by a 
 different process, arising by a differentiation of the cytoplasm around 
 the central granule. The former case, therefore, may be interpreted 
 to mean simply that the centrosome may give rise to other cytoplasmic 
 elements (as has already been shown in the formation of the sperma- 
 tozoon, p. 172), the material of which may then contribute either 
 directly or indirectly to the building of the aster ; and the facts do 
 not come into collision with the view that the astral rays are in gen- 
 eral formed from the cytoplasmic substance. 

G. Summary and Conclusion 

A minute analysis of the various parts of the cell leads to the con- 
 clusion that all cell-organs, whether temporary or " permanent," are 
 local differentiations of a common structural basis. Temporary organs, 
 such as cilia or pseudopodia, are formed out of this basis, persist for a 
 time, and finally merge their identity in the common basis again. Per- 
 manent organs, such as the nucleus or plastids, are constant areas in 
 the same basis, which never are formed de novo, but arise by the divi- 
 sion of preexisting areas of the same kind. These two extremes are, 
 however, connected by various intermediate gradations, examples of 
 which are the contractile vacuoles of Protozoa, which belong to the 
 category of temporary organs, yet in many cases are handed on from 
 one cell to another by fission, and the attraction-spheres and asters, 
 which may either petsist from cell to cell or disappear and re-form 
 about the centrosome. There is now considerable evidence that the 
 centrosome itself may in some cases have the character of a perma- 
 nent organ, in others may disappear and re-form like the asters. 

The facts point toward the conclusion, which has been especially 
 urged by De Vries and Wiesner, that the power of division, not only 
 of the cell-organs, but also of the cell as a whole, may have its root in 
 a like power on the part of more elementary masses or units of which 
 the structural basis is itself built, tJic degree of pennanence in the cell- 
 organs depending on the degj'ee of coJiesion manifested by these elemen- 
 tary bodies. If such bodies exist, they must, however, in their primary 
 form, lie beyond the present limits of the microscope, the visible struc- 
 tures arising by their enlargement or aggregation. The cell, therefore, 
 cannot be regarded as a colony of "granules" or other gross morpho- 
 logical elements. The phenomena of cell-division show, however, that 
 the dividing substance tends to differentiate itself into several orders 
 of visible morphological aggregates, as is most clearly shown in the 
 nuclear substance. Here the highest term is the plurivalent chromo- 
 some, the lowest the smallest visible dividing basichromatin-grains,
