328 SOME PROBLEMS OF CELL-ORGANIZATION 

while the intermediate terms are formed by the successive aggrega- 
 tion of these to form the chromatin-granules of which the dividing 
 chromosomes consist. Whether any or all of these bodies are " indi- 
 viduals " is a question of words. The facts point, however, to the 
 conclusion that at the bottom of the series there must be masses that 
 cannot be further split up without loss of their characteristic proper- 
 ties, and which form the elementary morphological units of the nucleus. 
 In case of the cytoplasm the evidence is far less satisfactory. 
 Could Rabl's theory of fibrillar persistence, as developed by Heiden- 
 hain and Kostanecki, be established, we should indeed have almost a 
 demonstration of panmeristic division in the cytoplasm. At present, 
 however, the facts do not admit the acceptance of that theory, and 
 the division of the visible cytoplasmic granules must remain a quite 
 open question. Yet we should remember that the dividing plastids 
 of plant-cells are often very minute, and that in the centrosome we 
 have a body, no larger in many cases than a "microsome," which is 
 positively known to be in some cases a persistent morphological ele- 
 ment, having the power of growth, division, and persistence in the 
 daughter-cells. Probably these powers of the centrosome would 
 never have been discovered were it not that its staining-capacity ren- 
 ders it conspicuous and its position at the focus of the astral rays 
 isolates it for observation. When we consider the analogy between 
 the centrosome and the basichromatin-grains, when we recall the 
 evidence that the latter graduate into the oxychromatin-granules, and 
 these in turn into the cytomicrosomes, we must admit that Briicke's 
 cautious suggestion that the whole cell might be a congeries of self- 
 propagating units of a lower order is sufficiently supported by fact 
 to constitute a legitimate working hypothesis.
