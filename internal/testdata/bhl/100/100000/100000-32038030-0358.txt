SOME ASPECTS OF CELL-CHEMISTRY AND CELL-PHYSIOLOGY

A. Chemical Relations of Nucleus and Cytoplasm 

It is no part of the purpose of this work to give even a sketch of 
 general cell-chemistry. I shall only attempt to consider certain ques- 
 tions that bear directly upon the functional relations of nucleus and 
 cytoplasm and are of especial interest in relation to the process of 
 nutrition and through it to the problems of development. It has 
 often been pointed out that we know little or nothing of the chemical 
 conditions existing in living protoplasm, since every attempt to examine 
 them by precise methods necessarily kills the protoplasm. We must, 
 therefore, in the main rest content with inferences based upon the 
 chemical behaviour of dead cells. But even here investigation is be- 
 set with difficulties, since it is in most cases impossible to isolate the 
 various parts of the cell for accurate chemical analysis, and we are 
 obliged to rely largely on the less precise method of observing with 
 the microscope the visible effects of dyes and other reagents. This 
 difficulty is increased by the fact that both cytoplasm and karyoplasm 
 are not simple chemical compounds, but mixtures of many complex 
 substances ; and both, moreover, undergo periodic changes of a com- 
 plicated character which differ very widely in different kinds of cells. 
 Our knowledge is, therefore, still fragmentary, and we have as yet 
 scarcely passed the threshold of a subject which belongs largely to 
 the cytology of the future. 

It has been shown in the foregoing chapter that all the parts of the 
 cell arise as local differentiations of a general protoplasmic basis. 
 Despite the difficulties of chemical analysis referred to above, it has 
 been determined with certainty that some at least of these organs are 
 the seat of specific chemical change; just as is the case in the various 
 organs and tissues of the organism at large. Thus, the nucleus is
