albumins, which are compounds of pseudo-nucleinic acid with albumin 
 and yield no nuclein-bases (xanthin, hypoxanthin, adenin, guanin) as 
 decomposition products. 

The distribution of these substances through the cell varies 
 greatly not only in different cells, but at different periods in the life 
 of the same cell. The cardinal fact always, however, remains, that 
 there is a definite and constant contrast betzveen nucleus and cytoplasm. 
 The latter always contains large quantities of nucleo-albumins, certain 
 globulins, and sometimes small quantities of albumins and peptones; 
 the former contains, in addition to these, nuclein and nucleo-proteids, 
 which form its main bulk, and its most constant and characteristic 
 feature. It is the remarkable substance, nuclein, — which is almost 
 certainly identical with chromatin, — that chiefly claims our attention 
 here on account of the physiological role of the nucleus. 

2. TJie Nuclein Series 

Nuclein was first isolated and named by Miescher, in 1871, by 
 subjecting cells to artificial gastric digestion. The cytoplasm is thus 
 digested, leaving only the nuclei ; and in some cases, for instance pus- 
 cells and spermatozoa, it is possible by this method to procure large 
 quantities of nuclear substance for accurate quantitative analysis. 
 The results of analysis show it to be a complex albuminoid substance, 
 rich in phosphorus, for which Miescher gave the chemical formula 
 C29H49N9P3022- The earlier . analysis of this substance gave some- 
 what discordant results, as appears in the following table of per-

These differences led to the opinion, first expressed by Hoppe- 
 Seyler, and confirmed by later investigations, that there are several 
 varieties of nuclein which form a group having certain characters 
 in common. Altmann ('89) opened the way to an understanding of 
 the matter by showing that "nuclein " may be split up into two sub- 
 stances ; namely, (i) an organic acid rich in phosphorus, to which he
