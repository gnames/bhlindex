phosphorus-free." ^ Further, " in the processes of vital activity there 
 are changing relations between the phosphorized constituents of the 
 nucleus, just as in all metabolic processes there is a continual inter- 
 change, some constituents being elaborated, others breaking down 
 into simpler products." This latter conclusion has been well estab- 
 lished; the others, as stated by Halliburton, require some modification, 
 on the one hand, through the results of later analyses of chromatin, 
 on the other, because of the failure to distinguish between the nucleo- 
 proteids and the nucleo-albumins. First, it has been shown by 
 Miescher ('96), Kossel ('96), and Mathews ('97, 2) that the chromatin 
 of the sperm-nuclei (in fish and sea-urchins) is not pure nucleinic acid, 
 as Altmann conjectured, but a salt of that acid, with histon, protamin, 
 or a related substance. Thus, in the spermatozoa of the salmon, 
 Miescher's analyses give 60.56% of nucleinic acid and 35.56% of 
 protamin (CigH28N902). In the herring the chromatin is a compound 
 of nucleinic acid (over 63%) and a form of protamin called by Kossel 
 " clupein " (CggHg^N^^Og). In the sea-urchin Arbacia Mathews finds 
 the chromatin to be a compound of nucleinic acid and " arbacin," a 
 histon-like body. Kossel finds also that chromatin (nuclein) derived 
 from the thymus gland, and from leucocytes, is largely a histon 
 salt of nucleinic acid, the proportion of the latter being, however, 
 much less than in the sperm-chromatin, while albumin is also present. 
 In these cases, therefore, the greater part of the nucleinic acid is com- 
 bined not with albumin but with a histon or protamin radical. Second, 
 the nucleo-albumins of the cytoplasm are in no sense transitional be-' 
 tween the nucleins and the albumins, since they contain no true 
 nucleinic acid, but only pseudo-nucleinic acid.^ The fact nevertheless 
 remains that the nucleins and nucleo-proteids, though confined to the 
 nucleus, form a series descending from such highly phosphorized 
 bodies as the sperm-chromatin toward bodies such as the albumins, 
 which are especially characteristic of the cytoplasm ; and that they 
 vary in composition with varying physiological conditions. The way 
 is thus opened for a more precise investigation of the physiological 
 role of nucleus and cytoplasm in metabolism. 

3. Staining-reaction of the Niiclein Series 

In bringing these facts into relation with the staining-reactions of 
 the cell, it is necessary briefly to consider the nature of staining- 
 reactions in general, and especially to warn the reader that in the 
 whole field of " micro-chemistry " we are still on such uncertain 
 ground that all general conclusions must be taken with reserve. 

First, it is still uncertain how far staining-reactions depend upon 
 chemical reaction and how far upon merely physical properties of
