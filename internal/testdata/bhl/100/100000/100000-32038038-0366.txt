forming the " chromatin " of Flemming, is called " basichromatin." ^ 
 Morphologically, the granules of both kinds are exactly alike,^ and 
 in many cases the oxychromatin-granules are found not only in the 
 " achromatic " nuclear network, but also intermingled with the basi- 
 chromatin-granules of the chromatic network. Collating these results 
 with those of the physiological chemists, Heidenhain concludes that 
 basichromatin is a substance rich in phosphorus {i.e. nucleinic acid), 
 oxychromatin a substance poor in phosphorus, and that, further, 
 " basichromatin and oxychromatin are by no means to be regarded 
 as permanent unchangeable bodies but may change their colour- 
 reactions by combining with or giving off phosphorus." In other 
 words, " the affinity of the chromatophilous microsomes of the nuclear 
 network for basic and acid aniline dyes is regulated by certain physio- 
 logical conditions of the nucleus or of the cell."^ 

This conclusion, which is entirely in harmony with the statements 
 of Kossel and Halliburton quoted above, opens up the most interest- 
 ing questions regarding the periodic changes in the nucleus. The 
 staining-power of chromatin is at a maximum when in the preparatory 
 stages of mitosis (spireme-thread, chromosomes). During the ensuing 
 growth of the nucleus it always diminishes, suggesting that a com- 
 bination with albumin has taken place. This is illustrated in a very 
 striking way by the history of the egg-nucleus or germinal vesicle, 
 which exhibits the nuclear changes on a large scale. It has long 
 been known that the chromatin of this nucleus undergoes great 
 changes during the growth of the ^gg, and several observers have 
 maintained its entire disappearance at one period. Riickert first 
 carefully traced out the history of the chromatin in detail in the 
 eggs of sharks, and his general results have since been confirmed by 
 Born in the eggs of Triton. In the shark Pristiuriis, Ruckert ('92, i) 
 finds that the chromosomes, which persist throughout the entire 
 growth-period of the &gg, undergo the following changes (Fig. 157): 
 At a very early stage they are small, and stain intensely with nuclear 
 dyes. During the growth of the Q.gg they undergo a great increase 
 in size, and progressively lose their staining-capacity . At the same 
 time their surface is enormously increased by the development of 
 long threads which grow out in every direction from the central axis 
 (Fig. 157, A). As the Q.g^ approaches its full size, the chromosomes 
 rapidly diminish in size, the radiating threads disappear, and the stain- 
 ing-capacity increases (Fig. 157, B^. They are finally again reduced to 
 minute, intensely staining bodies which enter into the equatorial plate 
 of the first polar, mitotic figure (Fig. 157, C). How great the change 
 of volume is may be seen from the following figures. At the beginning 
 the chromosomes measure, at most, 12 /^ (about 2 oVo ''^^■) ^^ length and
