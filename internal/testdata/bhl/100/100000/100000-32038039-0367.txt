1 fx, in diameter. At the height of their development they are almost 
 eight times their original length and twenty times their original 
 diameter. In the final period they are but 2 /x in length and i /x in di- 
 ameter. These measurements show a change of volume so enormous, 
 even after making due allowance for the loose structure of the large 
 chromosomes, that it cannot be accounted for by mere swelling or 
 shrinkage. The chromosomes evidently absorb a large amount of

matter, combine with it to form a substance of diminished staining- 
 capacity, and finally give off matter, leaving an intensely staining 
 substance behind. As Riickert points out, the great increase of sur- 
 face in the chromosomes is adapted to facilitate an exchange of mate- 
 rial between the chromatin and the surrounding substance ; and he 
 concludes that the coincidence between the growth of the chromo- 
 somes and that of the o.'g'g points to an intimate connection between 
 the nuclear activity and the formative energy of the cytoplasm.
