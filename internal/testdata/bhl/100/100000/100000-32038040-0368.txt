If these facts are considered in the Hght of the known staining- 
 reaction of the nuclein series, we must admit that the following con- 
 clusions are something more than mere possibilities. We may infer 
 that the original chromosomes contain a high percentage of nucleinic 
 acid ; that their growth and loss of staining-power is due to a combi- 
 nation with a large amount of albuminous substance to form a 
 lower member of the nuclein series, probably a nucleo-proteid ; that 
 their final diminution in size and resumption of staining-power is 
 caused by a giving up of the albumin constituent, restoring the 
 nuclein to its original state as a preparation for division. The growth 
 and diminished staining-capacity of the chromatin occurs during a 
 period of intense constructive activity in the cytoplasm ; its diminu- 
 tion in bulk and resumption of staining-capacity coincides with the 
 cessation of this activity. This result is in harmony with the obser- 
 vations of Schwarz and Zacharias on growing plant-cells, the per- 
 centage of nuclein in the nuclei of embryonic cells (meristem) being 
 at first relatively large and diminishing as the cells increase in size. 
 It agrees further with the fact that of all forms of nuclei those of the 
 spermatozoa, in which growth is suspended, are richest in nucleinic 
 acid, and in this respect stand at the opposite extreme from the nuclei 
 of the rapidly growing egg-cell. 

Accurately determined facts in this direction are still too scanty to 
 admit of a safe generalization. They are, however, enough to indi- 
 cate the probability that chromatin passes through a certain cycle 
 in the life of the cell, the percentage of albumin or of albumin-radicals 
 increasing during the vegetative activity of the nucleus, decreasing in 
 its reproductive phase. In other words, a combination of albumin 
 with nuclein or nucleinic acid is an accompaniment of constructive 
 metabolism. As the cell prepares for division, the combination is 
 dissolved and the nuclein-radicle or nucleinic acid is handed on by 
 division to the daughter-cells. A tempting hypothesis, suggested 
 by Mathews on the basis of Kossel's work, is that nuclein, or one of 
 its constituent molecular groups, may in a chemical sense be regarded 
 as the formative centre of the cell which is directly involved in the 
 process by which food-matters are built up into the cell-substance. 
 Could this be established, we should have not only a clear hght on 
 the changes of staining-reactions during the cycle of cell-life, but also 
 a clue to the nuclear " control " of the cell through the process of 
 synthetic metabolism. This hypothesis fits well with the conclusions 
 of other physiological chemists that the nucleus is especially con- 
 cerned in synthetic metabolism. Kossel concludes that the formation 
 of new organic matter is dependent on the nucleus,^ and that nuclein 
 in some manner plays a leading role in this process ; and he makes
