PHYSIOLOGICAL RELATIONS OF NUCLEUS AND CYTOPLASM 341 

some interesting suggestions regarding the synthesis of complex 
 organic matters in the living cell with nuclein as a starting-point. 
 Chittenden, too, in a review of recent chemico-physiological dis- 
 coveries regarding the cell, concludes : " The cell-nucleus may be 
 looked upon as in some manner standing in close relation to those 
 processes which have to do with the formation of organic substances. 
 Whatever other functions it may possess, it evidently, through the 
 inherent qualities of the bodies entering into its composition, has a 
 controlling power over the metabolic processes in the cell, modifying 
 and regulating the nutritional changes " ('94). 

These conclusions, in their turn, are in harmony with the hypothesis 
 advanced twenty years ago by Claude Bernard ('78), who maintained 
 that the cytoplasm is the seat of destructive metabolism, the nucleus 
 the organ of constructive metabolism and organic synthesis, and 
 insisted that the role of the nucleus in nutrition gives the key to its 
 significance as the organ of development, regeneration, and inheri- 
 tance.i

How nearly the foregoing facts bear on the problem of the mor- 
 phological formative power of the cell is obvious ; and they have in a 
 measure anticipated certain conclusions regarding the role of nucleus 
 and cytoplasm, which we may now examine from a somewhat differ- 
 ent point of view. 

BriJcke long ago drew a clear distinction between the chemical and 
 molecular composition of organic substances, on the one hand, and, 
 on the other hand, their definite grouping in the cell by which arises 
 organization in a morphological sense. Claude Bernard, in like man- 
 ner, distinguished between chemical syntJiesis, through which organic 
 matters are formed, and morphological synthesis, by which they are 
 built into a specifically organized fabric ; but he insisted that these 
 two processes are but different phases or degrees of the same phe- 
 nomenon, and that both are expressions of the nuclear activity. We 
 have now to consider some of the evidence that the po^ver of mor- 
 phological, as well as of chemical, synthesis centres in the nucleus, 
 and that this is therefore to be regarded as the especial organ of 
 inheritance. This evidence is mainly derived from the comparison 
 of nucleated and non-nucleated masses of protoplasm ; from the form, 

1 " II semble done que la cellule qui a perdu son noyau soit sterilisee au point de vue de 
 la generation, c'est h, dire de la synthese morphologique, et qu'elle le soit aussi au point de 
 vue de la synthese chimique, car elle cesse de produire des principes immediats, et ne peut 
 guere qu'oxyder et detruire ceux qui s'y etaient accumules par une elaboration anterieure du 
 noyau. II semble done que le noyau soit \q geriiic de nutrition de la cellule ; il attire autour 
 de lui et elabore les materiaux nutritifs" ('78, p. 523).
