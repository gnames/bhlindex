I. Experiments on Unicellnlar Organisms 

Brandt {^7^^ long since observed that enucleated fragments of Acti- 
 nosphceriimi soon die, while nucleated fragments heal their wounds 

and continue to live. The 
 '(il^0^/y^ first decisive comparison be- 

tween nucleated and non-nu- 
 cleated masses of protoplasm 
 was, however, made by Moritz 
 Nussbaumin 1884 in the case 
 of an infusorian, Oxytricha. 
 If one of these animals be 
 cut into two pieces, the sub- 
 sequent behaviour of the two 
 fragments depends on the 
 presence or absence of the 
 nucleus or a nuclear frag- 
 ment. The nucleated- frag- 
 ments quickly heal the wound, 
 regenerate the missing por- 
 tions, and thus produce a 
 perfect animal. On the other 
 hand, enucleated fragments, 
 consisting of cytoplasm only, 
 quickly perish. Nussbaum 
 therefore drew the conclusion 
 that the nucleus is indispens- 
 able for the formative energy 
 of the cell. The experiment 
 was soon after repeated by Gruber('85)in the case of Stentor, another 
 infusorian, and with the same result (Fig. 159). Fragments possess- 
 ing a large fragment of the nucleus completely regenerated within 
 twenty-four hours. If the nuclear fragment were smaller, the re- 
 generation proceeded, more slowly. If no nuclear substance were 
 present, no regeneration took place, though the wound closed and 
 the fragment lived for a considerable time. The only exception- — • 
 but it is a very significant one — was the case of individuals in which 
 the process of normal fission had begun ; in these a non-nucleated 
 fragment in which the formation of a new peristome had already been 
 initiated healed the wound and completed the formation of the peri-

 regenerates a perfect animal. The enucleated pieces, 
 shown at the right, swim about for a time, but finally 
 perish.
