stome. Lillie ('96) has recently found that Stentor may by shaking 
 be broken into fragments of all sizes, and that nucleated fragments 
 as small as gV ^^e volume of the entire animal are still capable of 
 complete regeneration. All non-nucleated fragments perish. 

These studies of Nussbaum and Gruber formed a prelude to more 
 extended investigations in the same direction by Gruber, Balbiani, 
 Hofer, and especially Verworn Verworn ('88) proved that in Poly- 
 stomella, one of the Foraminifera, nucleated fragments are able to

repair the shell, while non-nucleated fragments lack this power. 
 Balbiani ('89) showed that although non-nucleated fragments of 
 Infusoria had no power of regeneration, they might nevertheless 
 continue to live and swim actively about for many days after the 
 operation, the contractile vacuole pulsating as usual. Hofer ('89), 
 experimenting on Amoeba, found that non-nucleated fragments might 
 live as long as fourteen days after the operation (Fig. 160). Their 
 movements continued, but were somewhat modified, and little by 
 little ceased, but the pulsations of the contractile vacuole were but 
 slightly affected ; they lost more or less completely the capacity to
