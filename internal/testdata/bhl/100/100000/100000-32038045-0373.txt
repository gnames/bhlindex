mella) or the slime by which the animals adhere to the substratum 
 {Amoeba, Diffliigia, Polystomella). Beside these results should be 
 placed the well-known fact that dissevered nerve-fibres in the higher 
 animals are only regenerated from that end which remains in con- 
 nection with the nerve-cell, while the remaining portion invariably 
 degenerates.

A. Plasmolyzed cell, leaf-hair of Ciiciirbita, showing protoplasmic balls connected by strands. 

B. Calyx-hair of Gaillardia ; nucleated fragment with membrane, non-nucleated one naked. 

C. Root-hair of Marchantia ; all the fragments, connected by protoplasmic strands, have formed 
 membranes. D. Leaf-hair of Cucnrbita ; non-nucleated fragment, with membrane, connected 
 with nucleated fragment of adjoining cell. 

These beautiful observations prove that destructive metabolism, as 
 manifested by coordinated forms of protoplasmic contractility, may 
 go on for some time undisturbed in a mass of cytoplasm deprived of 
 a nucleus. On the other hand, the building up of new chemical or 
 morphological products by the cytoplasm is only initiated in the 
 presence of a nucleus and soon ceases in its absence. These facts 
 form a complete demonstration that the nucleus plays an essential
