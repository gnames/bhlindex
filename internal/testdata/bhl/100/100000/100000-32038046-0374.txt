346 CELL-CHEMISTRY AND CELL-PHYSIOLOGY 

part not only in the operations of synthetic metabolism or chemical 
 synthesis, but also in the morphological detcrtninatioii of these opera- 
 tions, i.e. the morphological synthesis of Bernard â€” a point of capital 
 importance for the theory of inheritance, as will appear beyond. 

Convincing experiments of the same character and leading to the 
 same result have been made on the cells of plants. Francis Darwin 
 (^JJ) observed more than twenty years ago that movements actively 
 continued in protoplasmic filaments, extruded from the leaf-hairs of 
 Dipsaciis, that were completely severed from the body of the cell. 
 Conversely, Klebs ('79) soon afterward showed that naked proto- 
 plasmic fragments of Vaiwheria and other algae were incapable of 
 forming a new cellulose membrane if devoid of a nucleus ; and he 
 afterward showed ('87) that the same is true of Zygnema and CEdo- 
 gonium. By plasmolysis the cells of these forms may be broken up 
 into fragments, both nucleated and non-nucleated. The former sur- 
 round themselves with a new wall, grow, and develop into complete 
 plants ; the latter, while able to form starch by means of the chloro- 
 phyll they contain, are incapable of utilizing it, and are devoid of the 
 power of forming a new membrane, and of gtowth and regeneration. 
 A beautiful confirmation of this is given by Townsend ('97), who finds 
 in the case of root-hairs and pollen-tubes, that when the protoplasm is 
 thus broken up, a membrane may be formed by both nucleated and 
 non-nucleated fragments, by the latter however only when they remain 
 co7tnected zvith the nucleated masses by protoplasmic strands, however 
 fine. If these strands be broken, the membrane-forming power is 
 lost. Of very great interest is the further observation (made on leaf- 
 hairs in Cuc7irbita) that the influence of the nucleus may thus extend 
 from cell to cell, an enucleated fragment of one cell having the power 
 to form a membrane if connected by intercellular bridges with a 
 nucleated fragment of an adjoining cell (Fig. 161). 

2. Position and Movements of the Nnclens 

Many observers have approached the same problem from a dif- 
 ferent direction by considering the position, movements, and changes 
 of form in the nucleus with regard to the formative activities in the 
 cytoplasm. To review these researches in full would be impossible, 
 and we must be content to consider only the well-known researches 
 of Haberlandt i^Tj) and Korschelt ('89), both of whom have given 
 extensive reviews of the entire subject in this regard. Haberlandt's 
 studies related to the position of the nucleus in plant-cells with 
 especial regard to the growth of the cellulose membrane. He deter- 
 mined the very significant fact that local growth of the cell-wall is 
 always preceded by a movement of the nucleus to the point of growth. 
 Thus, in the formation of epidermal cells, the nucleus lies at first near
