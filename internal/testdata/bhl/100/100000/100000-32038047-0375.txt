the centre, but as the outer wall thickens, the nucleus moves toward 
 it, and remains closely applied to it throughout its growth, after which 
 the nucleus often moves into another part of the cell (Fig. 162, A, B). 
 That this is not due simply to a movement of the nucleus toward the 
 air and light is beautifully shown in the coats of certain seeds, where 
 the nucleus moves, not to the outer, but to the inner wall of the cell, 
 and here the thickening takes place (Fig. 162, C). The same position

of the nucleus is shown in the thickening of the walls of the guard- 
 cells of stomata, in the formation of the peristome of mosses, and in 
 many other cases. In the formation of root-hairs in the pea, the pri- 
 mary outgrowth always takes place from the immediate neighbourhood 
 of the nucleus, which is carried outward and remains near the tip of 
 the growing hair (Fig. 162, D, E). The same is true of the rhizoids 
 of fern-prothallia and liverworts. In the hairs of aerial plants this
