PHYSIOLOGICAL RELATIONS OF NUCLEUS AND CYTOPLASM 349 

in the perivisceral fluid, accompanied by a nurse-cell having a very 
 large chromatic nucleus, while that of the Q.gg is smaller and poorer 
 in chromatin. As the egg 
 completes its growth, the 
 nurse-cell dwindles away 
 and finally perishes (Fig. 
 'j6). In all these cases 
 it is scarcely possible to 
 doubt that the Q.gg is in a 
 measure relieved of the 
 task of elaborating cyto- 
 plasmic products by the 
 nurse-cell, and that the 
 great development of 
 the nucleus in the latter 
 is correlated with this 
 function. 

Regarding the posi- 
 tion and movements of 
 the nucleus, Korschelt 
 reviews many facts 
 pointing toward the 
 same conclusion. Per- 
 haps the most sugges- 
 tive of these relate to 
 the nucleus of the t.g^ 
 during its ovarian his- 
 tory. In many of the „. . ,, . . , . , • ^

 cessively younger stages of egg and nurse are shown above. 

cases referred to above, 
 the egg-nucleus at first 
 occupies a central posi- 
 tion, but as the ^g^ be- 
 gins to grow, it moves to the periphery on the side turned toward 
 the nutritive cells. The same is true in the ovarian eggs of some other 
 animals, good examples of which are afforded by various coelenterates, 
 e.g. in medusas (Claus, Hertwig) and actinians (Korschelt, Hertwig), 
 where the germinal vesicle is always near the point of attachment of 
 the Q.gg. Most suggestive of all is the case of the water-beetle Dytis- 
 cus, in which Korschelt was able to observe the movements and changes 
 of form in the living object. The eggs here lie in a single series alter- 
 nating with chambers of nutritive cells. The latter contain granules 
 which are believed by Korschelt to pass into the ^Z%, perhaps bodily, 
 perhaps by dissolving and entering in a liquid form. At all events.
