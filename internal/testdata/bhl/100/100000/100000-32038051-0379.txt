PHYSIOLOGICAL RELATIONS OF NUCLEUS AND CYTOPLASM 351 

We now turn to evidence which, though less direct than the above, 
 is scarcely less convincing. This evidence, which has been exhaus- 
 tively discussed by Hertwig, Weismann, and Strasburger, is drawn 
 from the history of the nucleus in mitosis, fertilization, and matura- 
 tion. It calls for only a brief review here, since the facts have been 
 fully described in earlier chapters. 

3. TJie Nucleus in Mitosis 

To Wilhelm Roux ('83) we owe the first clear recognition of the 
 fact that the transformation of the chromatic substance during mitotic 
 division is manifestly designed to effect a precise division of all its 
 parts, — i.e. a panmeristic division as opposed to a mere mass-division, 
 — and their definite distribution to the daughter-cells. "The essential 
 operation of nuclear division is the division of the mother-granules " 
 {i.e. the individual chromatin-grains) ; " all the other phenomena are 
 for the purpose of transporting the daughter-granules derived from 
 the division of a mother-granule, one to the centre of one of the 
 daughter-cells, the other to the centre of the other." In this respect 
 the nucleus stands in marked contrast to the cytoplasm, which under- 
 goes on the whole a mass-division, although certain of its elements, 
 such as the plastids and the centrosome, may separately divide, like 
 the elements of the nucleus. From this fact Roux argued, first, that 
 different regions of the nuclear substance must represent different 
 qualities, and second, that the apparatus of mitosis is designed to 
 distribute these qualities, according to a definite law, to the daughter- 
 cells. The particular form in which Roux and Weismann developed 
 this conception has now been generally rejected, and in any form it 
 has some serious difficulties in its way. We cannot assume a precise 
 localization of chromatin-elements in all parts of the nucleus ; for on 
 the one hand a large part of the chromatin may degenerate or be cast 
 out (as in the maturation of the ^gg\ and on the other hand in the 
 Protozoa a small fragment of the nucleus is able to regenerate the 
 whole. Nevertheless, the essential fact remains, as Hertwig, Kolliker, 
 Strasburger, De Vries, and many others have insisted, that in mitotic 
 cell-division the chromatin of the mother-cell is distributed with the 
 most scrupulous equality to the nuclei of the daughter-cells, and that 
 in this regard there is a most remarkable contrast between nucleus 
 and cytoplasm. This holds true with such wonderful constancy 

dependent upon certain substances (oxydation ferments) that in some manner, not yet 
 clearly understood, facilitate the process; and the work of Spitzer ('97) has shown that 
 these substances (obtained from tissue-extracts) belong to the group of nucleo-proteids, 
 which are characteristic nuclear substances. The view thus suggested opens a further way 
 toward more exact inquiry into the nuclear functions, though it is not to be supposed that 
 the nucleus is the sole oxydative centre of the cell, as is obvious from the prolonged activity 
 of non-nucleated protoplasmic masses.
