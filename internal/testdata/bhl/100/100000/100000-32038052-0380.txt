throughout the series of living forms, from the lowest to the highest, 
 that it must have a deep significance. And while we are not yet in 
 a position to grasp its full meaning, this contrast points unmistakably 
 to the conclusion that the most essential material handed on by the 
 mother-cell to its progeny is the chromatin, and that this substance 
 therefore has a special significance in inheritance. 

4. The Nucleus in Fertilization 

The foregoing argument receives an overwhelming reenforcement 
 from the facts of fertilization. Although the ovum supplies nearly 

all the cytoplasm for the embry- 
 onic body, and the spermatozoon 
 at most only a trace, the latter is 
 nevertheless as potent in its effect 
 on the offspring as the former. On 
 the other hand, the nuclei con- 
 tributed by the germ-cells, though 
 apparently different, become in 
 the end exactly equivalent in every 
 visible respect — in structure, in 
 staining-reactions, and in the num- 
 ber and form of the chromosomes 
 to which each gives rise. But 
 furthermore the substance of the 
 two germ-nuclei is distributed with 
 absolute equality, certainly to the 
 first two cells of the embryo, and 
 probably to all later-formed cells. 
 The latter conclusion, which long 
 remained a mere surmise, has been 
 rendered nearly a certainty by 
 the remarkable observations of 
 Riickert, Zoja, and Hacker, de- 
 scribed in Chapters IV. and VI. 
 We must therefore accept the high 
 probability of the conclusion that 
 the specific character of the cell is 
 in the last analysis determined by 
 that of the nucleus, that is by the 
 chromatin, and that in the equal 
 distribution of paternal and ma- 
 ternal chromatin to all the cells of 
 the offspring we find the physio- 
 logical explanation of the fact that
