PHYSIOLOGICAL RELATIONS OF NUCLEUS AND CYTOPLASM 353 

every part of the latter may show the characteristics of either or both 
 parents. 

Boveri ('89, '95, i) has attempted to test this conclusion by a most 
 ingenious and beautiful experiment ; and although his conclusions do 
 not rest on absolutely certain ground, they at least open the way to 
 a decisive test. The Hertwig brothers showed that the eggs of sea- 
 urchins might be broken into pieces by shaking, and that spermatozoa 
 would enter the enucleated fragments and cause them to segment. 
 Boveri proved that such a fragment, if fertilized by a spermatozoon, 
 would even give rise to a dwarf larva, indistinguishable from the nor- 
 mal in general appearance except in size. The nuclei of such larvae 
 are considerably smaller than those of the normal larvas, and were 
 shown by Morgan ('95, 4) to contain only half the mimber of chromo- 
 somes, thus demonstrating their origin from a single sperm-nucleus. 
 Now, by fertilizing enucleated egg-fragments of one species (^SpJice- 
 rechiiius gramilaris) with the spermatozoa of another {Echi?ius micro- 
 tiLbercidatus), Boveri obtained in a few instances dwarf Plutei show- 
 ing except in size tJie pure paternal cJiaracters {i.e. those of Echinus, 
 Fig. 164). From this he concluded that the maternal cytoplasm has 
 no determining effect on the offspring, but supplies only the material 
 in which the sperm-nucleus operates. Inheritance is, therefore, ef- 
 fected by the nucleus alone. 

The later studies of Seeliger ('94), Morgan ('95, 4), and Drisch 
 ('98, 3) showed that this result is not entirely conclusive, since hybrid 
 larvae arising by the fertilization of an entire ovum of one species by 
 a spermatozoon of the other show a very considerable range of varia- 
 tion ; and while most such hybrids are intermediate in character 
 between the two species, some individuals may nearly approximate 
 to the characters of the father or the mother. Despite this fact 
 Boveri ('95, i) has strongly defended his conclusion, though admitting 
 that only further research can definitely decide the question. It is 
 to be hoped that this highly ingenious experiment may be repeated 
 on other forms which may afford a decisive result. 

5. The Nucleus in Maturation 

Scarcely less convincing, finally, is the contrast between nucleus 
 and cytoplasm in the maturation of the germ-cells. It is scarcely 
 an exaggeration to say that the whole process of maturation, in its 
 broadest sense, renders the cytoplasm of the germ-cells as unlike, 
 the nuclei as like, as possible. The latter undergo a series of com- 
 plicated changes which result in a perfect equivalence between them 
 at the time of their union, and, more remotely, a perfect equality of 
 distribution to the embryonic cells. The cytoplasm, on the other
