piece (p. 212), which is itself genetically related to the centrosome of 
 the last cell-generation (p. 170). These facts seem explicable only 
 under the assumption that in these cases the centrosome, or a sub- 
 stance which it carries, gives an active stimulus to the cytoplasm 
 which incites the aster-formation about itself, and in the words of 
 Grifhn " disengages the forces at work in mitosis " ('96, p. 174). For 
 these reasons I incline to the view that in the artificial aster-formation 
 described by Morgan ^ the centrosomes there observed should not be 
 regarded as the creations of the asters, but rather as local deposits 
 of material which incite the aster-formation around them. That the 
 centrosomes or astral centres are centres of division (whether active 
 or passive) is beautifully shown by Boveri's interesting observations 
 on "partial fertilization " referred to at page 194. 

Again, Boveri has observed that the segmenting ovum of Ascaris 
 sometimes contains a supernumerary centrosome that does not enter

into connection with the chromosomes, but lies alone in the cytoplasm 
 (Fig. 165). Such a centrosome forms an independent centre of divi- 
 sion, the cell dividing into three parts, two of which are normal 
 blastomeres, while the third contains only the centrosome and attrac- 
 tion-sphere. The fate of such eggs was not determined, but they 
 form a complete demonstration that it is in this case the centrosome 
 and not the nucleus that determines the centres of division in the 
 cell-body. Scarcely less conclusive is the case of dispermic eggs in 
 sea-urchins. In such eggs both sperm-nuclei conjugate with the egg- 
 nucleus, and both sperm-centrosomes divide (Fig. 166). The 
 cleavage-nucleus, therefore, arises by the union of three nuclei and 
 four centrosomes. Such eggs divide at the first cleavage into four 
 equal blastomeres, each of which receives one of the centrosomes.
