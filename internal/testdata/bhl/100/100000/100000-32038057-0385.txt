also be concerned in the protoplasmic contraction of gland-cells by 
 which the excretion is expelled. [This is based on the fact that 
 the centrosomes are found in the free (pseudopodia-forming) ends of 
 the epithelial cells, and on the position of the centrosomes in goblet- 
 cells (Fig. 23) and in those of the lachrymal gland.] Peter ('99) has 
 attempted to test these conclusions experimentally by cutting or tear- 
 ing off cilia from the cell-body (gut-epithelium of Anodontd) and also 
 by isolating the tails of spermatozoa. In groups consisting of only a 
 few cilia, separated from the nucleus, the movements actively con- 
 tinue, while those that are separated from the basal bodies cease to 
 beat. Spermatozoon tails separated from the head also continue to

move, but only if they remain connected with the middle-piece. 
 Peter, therefore, supports the above conclusions of Henneguy and 
 Lenhossek. On the other hand, Meves ('99) finds that movements 
 of the undulating membrane in the tails of salamander-spermatozoa 
 continue if the middle-piece be entirely removed ; while a number 
 of earlier observers ^ have observed in flagellates that a flagellum 
 separated from the body may actively continue its movements for a 
 considerable time. 

Further research is therefore required to test these suggestions. 
 The intimate connection of the centrosomes with the formation, on the 
 one hand, of the astral rays, on the other of contractile organs, such
