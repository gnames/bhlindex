as cilia, flagella, and pseudopodia,^ the centrosomes in ciliated cells 
 and spermatozoa, and in the swarm-spores of Noctihica, is, however, a 
 most striking fact, and is one of the strongest indirect arguments in 
 favour of the general theory of fibrillar contractility in mitosis. 

D. Summary and Conclusion 

The facts reviewed in the foregoing pages converge to the conclu- 
 sion that the differentiation of the cell-substance into nucleus and 
 cytoplasm is the expression of a fundamental physiological division 
 of labour in the cell. Experiments upon unicellular forms demonstrate 
 that, in the entire absence of a nucleus, protoplasm is able for a 
 considerable time to liberate energy and to manifest coordinated 
 activities dependent on destructive metabolism. There is here sub- 
 stantial ground for the view that the cytoplasm is the principal 
 seat of these activities in the normal cell. On the other hand, 
 there is strong cumulative evidence that the nucleus is intimately 
 concerned in the constructive or synthetic processes, whether chemical 
 or morphological. 

That the nucleus has such a significance in synthetic metabolism 
 is proved by the fact that digestion and absorption of food and 
 growth soon cease with its removal from the cytoplasm, while destruc- 
 tive metabolism may long continue as manifested by the phenomena 
 of irritability and contractility. It is indicated by the position and 
 movements of the nucleus in relation to the food-supply and to the 
 formation of specific cytoplasmic products. It harmonizes with the 
 fact, now universally admitted, that active exchanges of material 
 go on between nucleus and cytoplasm. The periodic changes of 
 staining-capacity undergone by the chromatin during the cycle of cell- 
 life, taken in connection with the researches of physiological chemists 
 on the chemical composition and staining-reactions of the nuclein 
 series, indicate that the phosphorus-rich substance known as nucleinic 
 acid plays a leading part in the constructive process. During the 
 vegetative phases of the cell this substance is combined with a large 
 amount of the albumin radicles histon, protamin, and related sub- 
 stances, and probably in part with albumin itself, to form nuclein. 
 During the mitotic or reproductive processes this combination appears 
 to be dissolved, the albuminous elements being in large part split 
 off, leaving the substance of the chromosomes with a high percentage 
 of nucleinic acid, as is shown by direct analysis of the sperm-nucleus 
 and is indicated by the staining-reactions of the chromosomes. There 
 is, therefore, considerable ground for the hypothesis that in a chemi- 
 cal sense this substance is the most essential nuclear element handed
