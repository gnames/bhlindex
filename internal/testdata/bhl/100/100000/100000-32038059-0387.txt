on from cell to cell, whether by cell-division or by fertilization ; and 
 that it may be a primary factor in the constructive processes of the 
 nucleus and through these be indirectly concerned with those of the 
 cytoplasm. 

The role of the nucleus in constructive metabolism is intimately 
 related with its role in morphological synthesis, and thus in inheri- 
 tance ; for the recurrence of similar morphological characters must in 
 the last analysis be due to the recurrence of corresponding forms of 
 metabolic action of which they are the outward expression. That the 
 nucleus is in fact a primary factor in morphological as well as chemi- 
 cal synthesis is demonstrated by experiments on unicellular plants and 
 animals, which prove that the power of regenerating lost parts disap- 
 pears with its removal, though the enucleated fragment may continue 
 to live and move for a considerable period. That the nuclear sub- 
 stance, and especially the chromatin, is a leading factor in inheritance 
 is powerfully supported by the facts of maturation, fertilization, and 
 cell-division. In maturation the germ-nuclei are by an elaborate 
 process prepared for the subsequent union of equivalent chromatic 
 elements from the two sexes. By fertihzation these elements are 
 brought together, and by mitotic division distributed with exact equal- 
 ity to the embryonic cells. The result, which is especially striking in 
 the case of hybrid-fertilization, proves that the spermatozoon is as 
 potent in inheritance as the ovum, though the latter contributes an 
 amount of cytoplasm which is but an infinitesimal fraction of that 
 supplied by the ovum. 

It remains to be seen whether the chromatin can actually be re- 
 garded as the idioplasm or physical basis of inheritance, as maintained 
 by Hertwig and Strasburger. Verworn has justly urged that the 
 nucleus cannot be regarded as the sole vehicle of inheritance, since 
 the cooperation of both nucleus and cytoplasm is essential to com- 
 plete cell-life; and, as will be shown in Chapter IX., the cytoplasmic 
 organization plays an important role in shaping the course of devel- 
 opment. Considered in all their bearings, however, the facts seem 
 to accord best with the hypothesis that the cytoplasmic organization 
 is itself determined, in the last analysis, by the nucleus ; ^ and the 
 principle for which Hertwig and Strasburger contended is thus sus- 
 tained.
