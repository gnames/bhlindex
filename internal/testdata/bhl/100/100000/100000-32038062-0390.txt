362 CELL-DIVISION AND DEVELOPMENT 

sometimes so clearly marked and appear so early that with the very 
 first cleavage the position in which the embryo will finally appear in 
 the Q.gg may be exactly predicted. Such " promorphological " rela- 
 tions of the segmenting Q.gg possess a very high interest in their 
 bearing on the theory of germinal localization and on account of the 
 light which they throw on the conditions of the formative process. 

The present chapter is in the main a prelude to that which 
 follows, its purpose being to sketch some of the external features 
 of early development regarded as particular expressions of the gen- 
 eral rules of cell-division. For this purpose we may consider the 
 cleavage of the ovum under two heads, namely : — 

1. The Geometrical Relations of Cleavage-forms, with reference 
 to the general rules of cell-division. 

2. Tlie Provtorphological Relations of the blastomeres and cleav- 
 age-planes to the parts of the adult body to which they give rise. 

A. Geometrical Relations of Cleavage-forms 

The geometrical relations of the cleavage-planes and the relative 
 size and position of the cells vary endlessly in detail, being modified 
 by innumerable mechanical and other conditions, such as the amount 
 and distribution of the inert yolk or deutoplasm, the shape of the 
 ovum as a whole, and the like. Yet all the forms of cleavage can 
 be referred to a single type which has been moulded this way or that 
 by special conditions, and which is itself an expression of two general 
 rules of cell-division, first formulated by Sachs in the case of plant- 
 cells. These are : — 

1 . The cell typically tends to divide into equal parts. 

2. EacJi new plane of division tends to intersect the preceding plane 
 at a right angle. 

In the simplest and least modified forms the direction of the 
 cleavage-planes, and hence the general configuration of the cell- 
 system, depends on the general form of the dividing mass ; for, as 
 Sachs has shown, the cleavage-planes tend to be either vertical to the 
 surface {anticlines^ or parallel to it {periclines). Ideal schemes of 
 division may thus be constructed for various geometrical figures. In 
 a flat circular disc, for example, the anticlinal planes pass through 
 the radii ; the periclines are circles concentric with the periphery. If 
 the disc be elongated to form an ellipse, the periclines also become 
 ellipses, while the anticlines are converted into hyperbolas confocal 
 with the periclines. If it have the form of a parabola, the periclines 
 and anticlines form two systems of confocal parabolas intersecting at 
 right angles. All these schemes are mutatis mutandis, directly con- 
 vertible into the corresponding solid forms in three dimensions.
