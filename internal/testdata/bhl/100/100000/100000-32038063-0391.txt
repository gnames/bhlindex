Sachs has shown in the most beautiful manner that all the above 
 ideal types are closely approximated in nature, and Rauber has applied 
 the same principle to the cleavage of animal-cells. The discoid or 
 spheroid form is more or less nearly realized in the thalloid growths of

 after various authors.] 

A. Flat ellipsoidal germ-disc of Melobesia (Rosanoff) ; nearly tv-pical relation of elliptic 
 periclines and hyperbolic anticlines. B. C. Apical view of terminal knob on epidermal hair of 
 Pinguicola. B. shows the ellipsoid type, C. the circular (spherical type), somewhat modified 
 (only anticlines present). D. Growing point of Salvinia (Pringsheim), typical ellipsoid type; 
 the single pericline is, however, incomplete. E. Growing point of Azolla (Strasburger) ; circular 
 or spheroidal type transitional to ellipsoidal. F. Root-cap of Eqiiisi'tiim (Niigeli and Leitgeb) ; 
 modified circular type. G. Cross-section of leaf-vein, Trichomaiies (PrantI) ; ellipsoidal type with 
 incomplete periclines. H. Embryo of Alisma : typical ellipsoid type, pericline incomplete only 
 at lower side. /. Growing point of bud of the pine {Abies) ; typical paraboloid type, both anti- 
 clines and periclines having the form of parabolas (Sachs). 

various lower plants, in the embryos of flowering plants, and else- 
 where (Fig. 168). The paraboloid form is according to Sachs charac- 
 teristic of the growing points of many higher plants ; and here, too, 
 the actual form is remarkably similar to the ideal scheme (Fig. 168, /).
