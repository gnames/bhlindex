364 CELL-DIVISION AND DEVELOPMENT 

For our purpose the most important form is the sphere, which is 
 the typical shape of the egg-cell ; and all forms of cleavage may- 
 be related to the typical division of a sphere in accordance with Sachs's 
 rules. The ideal form of cleavage would here be a succession of 
 rectangular cleavages in the three dimensions of space, the anticlines 
 passing through the centre so as to split the Q.gg in the initial stages 
 successively into halves, quadrants, and octants, the periclines being 
 parallel to the surface so as to separate the inner ends of these cells 
 from the outer. No case is known in which this order is accurately 
 followed throughout, and the periclinal cleavages are of compara- 
 tively rare occurrence, being found as a regular feature of the early 
 cleavage only in those cases where the primary germ-layers are sepa- 
 rated by delamination. The simplest and clearest form of egg- 
 cleavage occurs in eggs like those of echinoderms, which are of 
 spherical form, and in which the deutoplasm is small in amount and 
 equally distributed through its substance. Such a cleavage is beauti- 
 fully displayed in the ^gg of the holothurian Synapta, as shown in 
 the diagrams. Fig. 169, constructed from Selenka's drawings. The 
 first cleavage is vertical, or inei'idional, passing through the egg-axis 
 and dividing the &gg into equal halves. The second, which is also 
 meridional, cuts the first plane at right angles and divides the Q.gg 
 into quadrants. The third is horizontal, or equatorial, dividing the 
 Q.g% into equal octants. The order of division is thus far exactly 
 that demanded by Sachs's rule and agrees precisely with the cleavage 
 of various kinds of spherical plant-cells. The later cleavages depart 
 from the ideal type in the absence of periclinal divisions, the embryo 
 becoming hollow, and its walls consisting of a single layer of cells in 
 which anticlinal cleavages occur in regular rectangular succession. 
 The fourth cleavage is again meridional, giving two tiers of eight 
 cells each; the fifth is horizontal, dividing each tier into an upper 
 and a lower layer. The regular alternation is continued up to the 
 ninth division (giving 512 cells), when the divisions pause while the 
 gastrulation begins. In later stages the regularity is lost. 

Hertwig s Development of Sachs's Rides. — Beside Sachs's rules 
 may be placed two others formulated by Oscar Hertwig in 1884, 
 which bear directly on the facts just outlined and which lie behind 
 Sachs's principle of the rectangular intersection of successive division- 
 planes. These are : — 

1 . The nucleus tends to take np a position at the centre of its sphere 
 of influence, i.e. of the protoplasmic mass in ivJdch it lies. 

2. The axis of the ^nitotic figu,res typically lies in the longest axis 
 of the protoplasjnic mass, and division therefore tends to cut this axis 
 at a right angle. 

The second rule explains the normal succession of the division-
