planes according to Sachs's second rule. The first division of a homo- 
 geneous spherical o-g^, for example, is followed by a second division 
 at right angles to it, since each hemisphere is twice as long in the 
 plane of division as in any plane vertical to it. The mitotic figure 
 of the second division lies therefore parallel to the first plane, which 
 forms the base of the hemisphere, and the ensuing division is vertical 
 to it. The same applies to the third division, since each quadrant is 
 as long as the entire Q,^g while at most only half its diameter. Divi- 
 sion is therefore transverse to the long axis and vertical to the first 
 two planes. 

Taken together the rules of Sachs and Hertwig, applied to the 
 ^g&' give us a kind of ideal type or model, well illustrated by the

cleavage of Synapta, described above, to which all the forms of cleav- 
 age may conveniently be referred as- a basis of comparison. Numer- 
 ous exceptions to all four of these rules are, however, known, and they 
 are of little value save as a starting-point for a closer study of the 
 facts. Cleavage of such schematic regularity as that of Synapta is 
 extremely rare, both the form and the order of division being end- 
 lessly varied and in extreme cases showing scarcely a discoverable 
 connection with the "type." We may conveniently consider these 
 modifications under the foUowino- three heads : —
