and Lamarle have shown, assume a polyhedral form and tend toward 
 such an arrangement that the area of surface-contact between them is 
 a miniimim. Spheres in a mass thus tend to assume the form of 
 interlocking polyhedrons so arranged that three planes intersect in 
 a line, while four lines and six planes meet at a point. If arranged 
 in a single layer on an extended surface, they assume the form of

hexagonal prisms, three planes meeting along a line as before. Both 
 these forms are commonly shown in the arrangement of the cells of 
 plant and animal tissues; and Berthold {^86) and Errera ('86, '87), 
 carefully analyzing the phenomena, have endeavoured to show that 
 not only the form and relative position of cells, but also the direction 
 of cell-division, is, partially at least, thus determined. 

It is through displacements of the cells of this type that many of
