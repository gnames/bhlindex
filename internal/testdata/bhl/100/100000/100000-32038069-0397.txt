required to show that this purely mechanical factor, though doubtless 
 real, must be subordinate to some other. This is strikingly shown, 
 for example, in the development of annelids and mollusks, where the 
 spiral cleavage, strictly maintained during the earlier stages, finally 
 gives way more or less completely to a bilateral type of division in 
 which the rule of minimal surface-contact is often violated. We see 
 here a tendency operating directly against, and finally overcoming,

the mechanical factor which predominates in the earlier stages ; and 
 in some cases, e.g. in the egg of Claveliua (Fig. 177) and other tuni- 
 cates, this tendency predominates from the beginning. In both 
 these cases this " tendency " is obviously related to the growth-process 
 to which the future bilateral embryo will owe its form ; ^ and every 
 attempt to explain the position of the cells and the direction of cleav- 
 age must reckon with the morphogenic process taken as a whole.
