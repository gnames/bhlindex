to the mesoblast-bands by continued divisions, always in the same 
 plane at right angles to that in which the rudimentary cells are 
 formed (Fig. 174). The cause of the definite succession of equal and 
 unequal divisions is here wholly unexplained. No less difficult is the 
 extreme inequality of division involved in the formation of the polar 
 bodies. We cannot explain this through the fact that deutoplasm is 
 collected in the lower hemisphere ; for, on the one hand, the succeed- 
 ing divisions (first cleavages) are often equal, while, on the other 
 hand, the inequality is no less pronounced in eggs having equally

Such cases prove that Balfour's law is only a partial explanation, 
 being probably the expression of a more deeply lying cause, and 
 there is reason to believe that this cause Hes outside the immediate 
 mechanism of mitosis. Conklin ('94) has called attention to the 
 fact^ that the immediate cause of the inequality probably does not 
 lie either in the nucleus or in the amphiaster ; for not only the 
 chromatin-halves, but also the asters, are exactly equal in the early 
 prophases, and the inequality of the asters only appears as the 
 division proceeds. Probably, therefore, the cause lies in some rela- 
 tion between the mitotic figure and the cell-body in which it lies.
