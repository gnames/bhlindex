GEOMETRICAL RELATIONS OF CLEAVAGE-FORMS 375 

eccentricity, the greater the inequality, an extreme form being beauti- 
 fully shown in the formation of the polar bodies. Here the original 
 amphiaster is perfectly symmetrical, with the asters of equal size 
 (Fig. 97, A). As the spindle rotates into its radial position and 
 approaches the periphery, the development of the outer aster be- 
 comes, as it were, suppressed, while the central aster becomes enor- 
 mously large. The size of the aster, in other words, depends upon the 
 extent of the cytoplasmic area that falls within the sphere of infiji.ence 
 of the centrosonie ; and this area depends upon the position of the 
 centrosome. If, therefore, the polar amphiaster could be artificially 
 prevented from moving to its peripheral position, the Q,^g would 
 probably divide equally.^ 

This leads us to a further consideration of the attempts that have 
 been made to explain the movements of the mitotic figure through 
 mechanical or other causes.^ Highly interesting experiments have 
 been made by Pfluger ('84), Roux ('85), Driesch ('92), and a number 
 of later investigators which show that the direction of cleavage may 
 be determined, or at least modified, by such a purely mechanical 
 cause as pressure, through which the form of the dividing mass is 
 changed. 

Thus, Driesch has shown that when the eggs of sea-urchins are 
 flattened by pressure, the amphiasters all assume the position of least 
 resistance, i.e. parallel to the flattened sides, so that the cleavages 
 are all vertical, and the Q.^g segments as a flat plate of eight, sixteen, 
 or thirty-two cells (Fig. 186). This is totally different from the nor- 
 mal form of cleavage ; yet such eggs, when released from pressure, 
 are capable of development and give rise to normal embryos. This 
 interesting experiment makes it highly probable that the disc-like 
 cleavage of meroblastic eggs, like that of the squid or bird, is in some 
 degree a mechanical result of the accumulation of yolk by which the 
 formative protoplasmic region of the ovum is reduced to a thin layer 
 at the upper pole ; and it indicates, further, that the unequal cleavage 
 of less modified telolecithal eggs, like those of the frog or snail, are 
 in like manner due to the displacement of the mitotic figures toward 
 the upper pole. 

The results of Pfliiger's and Driesch's pressure experiments obvi- 
 ously harmonize with Hertwig's second rule, for the position of least 
 resistance for the spindle is obviously in the long axis of the proto- 
 plasmic mass which is here artificially modified ; and it harmonizes 
 further with Driiner's hypothesis of the active elongation of the 
 spindle in mitosis (p. 105). There are, however, a large number of 
 facts which show that neither the form of the protoplasmic mass nor
