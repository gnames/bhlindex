CELL-DIVISION AND DEVELOPMENT 

the distribution of metaplasmic materials is sufficient to explain the 
 position of the spindle, whether with reference to the direction or the 
 inequality of the cleavage. 

As regards the direction of the spindle, Berthold ('86) long since 
 clearly pointed out that prismatic or cylindrical vegetable cells, for 
 instance, those of the cambium, often divide lengthwise ; and numer- 
 ous contradictions of Hertwig's " law " have since been observed by 
 students of cell-lineage with such accuracy that all attempts to explain 
 them away have failed.^ In some of these cases the position of the 
 spindle is not that of least but of greatest resistance,^ the spindle ac-

tually pushing away the adjoining cell to make way for itself. Simi- 
 lar difficulties, some of which have been already considered (p. 372), 
 stand in the way of the attempt to explain the eccentricity of the 
 spindle in unequal division. All these considerations drive us to the 
 view that the simpler mechanical factors, such as pressure, form, and 
 the like, are subordinate to far more subtle and complex operations 
 involved in the general development of the organism, a conclusion 
 strikingly illustrated by the phenomena of teloblastic division (p. 371), 
 where the constant succession of unequal divisions, always in the
