PROMORPHOLOGICAL RELATIONS OF CLEAVAGE 379 

of the upper hemisphere represent the " animal layer," outer germ- 
 layer or ectoblast from which arise the epidermis, the nervous system, 
 and the sense-organs. This fact, afterward confirmed in a very large 
 number of animals, led to the designation of the two poles as animal 
 and vegetative, formative and nutritive, or protoplasmic and deiito- 
 plasmic, the latter terms referring to the fact that the nutritive deuto- 
 plasm is mainly stored in the lower hemisphere, and that development 
 is therefore more active in the upper. The polarity of the ovum is 
 accentuated by other correlated phenomena. In every case where 
 an egg-axis can be determined by the accumulation of deutoplasm in 
 the lower hemisphere the egg-nucleus sooner or later lies eccentri- 
 cally in the upper hemisphere, and the polar bodies are formed at the 
 upper pole. Even in cases where the deutoplasm is equally distrib- 
 uted or is wanting — if there really be such cases — an egg-axis is 
 still determined by the eccentricity of the nucleus and the corre- 
 sponding point at which the polar bodies are formed. 

In vastly the greater number of cases the polarity of the ovum has 
 a definite promorphological significance ; for the egg-axis shows a 
 definite and constant relation to the axes of the adult body. It 
 is a very general rule that the upper or ectodermic pole, as marked 
 by the position of the polar bodies, lies in the median plane at a point 
 which is afterward found to lie at or near the anterior end. Through- 
 out the annelids and moUusks, for example, the upper pole is the point 
 at which the cerebral ganglia are afterward formed ; and these 
 organs lie in the adult on the dorsal side near the anterior extremity. 
 This relation holds true for many of the Bilateralia, though the 
 primitive relation is often disguised by asymmetrical growth in the 
 later stages, such as occur in echinoderms. There is, however, some 
 reason to believe that it is not a universal rule. The recent observa- 
 tions of Castle ('96), which are in accordance with the earlier work of 
 Seeliger, show that in the tunicate Ciona the usual relation is reversed, 
 the polar bodies being formed at the vegetative {i.e. deutoplasmic or 
 entodermic) pole, which afterward becomes the dorsal side of the 
 larva. My own observations ('95) on the echinoderm-egg indicate 
 that here the primitive egg-axis has an entirely inconstant and casual 
 relation to the gastrula-axis. It may, however, still be possible to 
 show that these exceptions are only apparent, and the principle in- 
 volved is too important to be accepted without further proof. 

ib) Axial Relations of the Primary Cleavage- planes. — Since the 
 egg-axis is definitely related to the embryonic axes, and since the 
 first two cleavage-planes pass through it, we may naturally look for a 
 definite relation between these planes and the embryonic axes ; and 
 if such a relation exists, then the first two or four blastomeres must 
 likewise have a definite prospective value in the development. Such
