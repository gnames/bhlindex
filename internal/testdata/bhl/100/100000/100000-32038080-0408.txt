relations have, in fact, been accurately determined in a large number 
 of cases. The first to call attention to such a relation seems to have 
 been Newport ('54), who discovered the remarkable fact that tJie first 
 cleavage-plane in the fi^og s egg coincides with the median plane of the 
 adult body ; that, in other words, one of the first two blastomeres 
 gives rise to the left side of the body, the other to the right. This 
 discovery, though long overlooked and, indeed, forgotten, was con- 
 firmed more than thirty years later by Pfliiger and Roux ('87). It

was placed beyond all question by a remarkable experiment by Roux 
 ('88), who succeeded in killing one of the blastomeres by puncture 
 with a heated needle, whereupon the uninjured cell gave rise to a 
 half-body as if the embryo had been bisected down the middle line 
 (Fig. 182). 

A similar result has been reached in a number of other animals by 
 following out the cell-lineage ; e.g. by Van Beneden and Julin ('84)
