in the ^^g of the tunicate Clavelina (Fig. 177), and by Watase ('91) 
 in the eggs of cephalopods (Fig. 178). In both these cases all the 
 early stages of cleavage show a beautiful bilateral symmetry, and not 
 only can the right and left halves of the segmenting Q.gg be distin- 
 guished with the greatest clearness, but also the anterior and poste- 
 rior regions, and the dorsal and ventral aspects. These discoveries 
 seemed, at first, to justify the hope that a fundamental law of develop- 
 ment had been discovered, and Van Beneden was thus led, as early 
 as 1883, to express the view that the development of all bilateral 
 animals would probably be found to agree with the frog and ascidian 
 in respect to the relations of the first cleavage. 

This cleavage was soon proved to have been premature. In one 
 series of forms, not the first but the second cleavage-plane was found

to coincide with the future long axis {N'crcis, and some other annelids ; 
 Crepidula, Uvibrella, and other gasteropods). In another series of 
 forms neither of the first cleavages passes through the median plane, 
 but both form an angle of about 45° to it {Clepsiiie and other leeches ; 
 RJiyncJiclmis and other annelids ; Planorbis, Nassa, Unio, and other 
 mollusks ; Discoccclis and other platodes). In a few cases the first 
 cleavage departs entirely from the rule, and is equatorial, as in Ascaris 
 and some other nematodes. The whole subject was finally thrown 
 into apparent confusion, first by the discovery of Clapp ('91), Jordan, 
 and Eycleshymer ('94) that in some cases there seems to be no con- 
 stant relation whatever between the early cleavage-planes and the 
 adult axes, even in the same species (teleosts, urodeles) ; and even in
