CELL-DIVISION AND DEVELOPMENT 

the frog Hertwig showed that the relation described by Newport and 
 Roux is not invariable. Driesch finally demonstrated that the direc- 
 tion of the early cleavage-planes might be artificially modified by 
 pressure without perceptibly affecting the end-result {cf. p. 375). 

These facts prove that the promorphology of the early cleavage- 
 forms can have no fundamental significance. Nevertheless, they are 
 of the highest interest and importance ; for the fact that the forma- 
 tive forces by which development is determined may or may not 
 coincide with those controlling the cleavage, gives us some hope of

{c) Other Promorphological CJiaracters of the Ovum. — Besides the 
 polarity of the ovum, which is the most constant and clearly marked 
 of its promorphological features, 'we are often able to discover other 
 characters that more or less clearly foreshadow the later develop- 
 ment. One of the most interesting and clearly marked of these is 
 the bilateral symmetry of the ovum in bilateral animals, which is 
 sometimes so clearly marked that the exact position of the embryo 
 may be predicted in the unfertilized tgg, sometimes even before it is 
 laid. This is the case, for example, in the cephalopod e^gg, as shown 
 by Watase (Fig. 179). Here the form of the new-laid &gg, before 
 cleavage begins, distinctly foreshadows that of the embryonic body, 
 and forms as it were a mould in which the whole development is cast. 
 Its general shape is that of a hen's egg shghtly flattened on one side,
