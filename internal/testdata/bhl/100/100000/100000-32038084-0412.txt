384 CELL-DIVISION AND DEVELOPMENT 

bilaterally symmetrical, and, according to Blochmann and Wheeler, 
 may even show a bilateral distribution of the yolk corresponding 
 with the bilaterality of the ovum. Hallez asserts as the results of a 
 study of the cockroach {Periplaneta), the water-beetle {Hydrophilus), 
 and the locust {Loaista) that "the egg-cell possesses the same orien- 
 tation as the maternal organism that produces it ; it has a cephalic 
 pole and a caudal pole, a right side and a left, a dorsal aspect and a 
 ventral ; and these different aspects of the egg-cell coincide with the 
 corresponding aspects of the embryo." ^ Wheeler ('93), after ex- 
 amining some thirty different species of insects, reached the same 
 result, and concluded that even when the ^g^^ approaches the 
 spherical form the symmetry still exists, though obscured. More- 
 over, according to Hallez ('86) and later writers, the Q.g^ always lies 
 in the same position in the oviduct, its cephalic end being turned 
 forwards toward the upper end of the oviduct, and hence toward 
 the head-end of the mother.^ 

2. Meaning of the Promorphology of the Ovuin 

The interpretation of the promorphology of the ovum cannot be 
 adequately treated apart from the general discussion of development 
 given in the following chapter ; nevertheless it may briefly be 
 considered at this point. Two widely different interpretations of 
 the facts have been given. On the one hand, it has been sug- 
 gested by Flemming and Van Beneden,^ and urged especially by 
 Whitman,* that the cytoplasm of the ovum possesses a definite 
 primordial organization which exists from the beginning of its exist- 
 ence even though invisible, and is revealed to observation through 
 polar differentiation, bilateral symmetry, and other obvious characters 
 in the unsegmented Qg^. On the other hand, it has been maintained 
 by Pflliger, Mark, Oscar Hertwig, Driesch, Watase, and the writer 
 that all the promorphological features of the ovum are of secondary 
 origin; that the egg-cytoplasm is at the beginning isotropous — i.e. 
 indifferent or homaxial — and gradually acquires its promorphological 
 features during its preembryonic history. Thus the Q.gg of a bilateral 
 animal is at the beginning not actually, but only potentially, bilateral. 
 Bilaterality once established, however, it forms as it were the mould 
 in which the cleavage and other operations of development are cast. 

I believe that the evidence at our command weighs heavily on 
 the side of the second view, and that the first hypothesis fails to

2 The micropyle usually lies at or near the anterior end, but may be at the posterior. 
 It is a very important fact that the position of the polar bodies varies, being sometimes at 
 the anterior end, sometimes on the side, either dorsal or lateral (Heider, Blochmann).
