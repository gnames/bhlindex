PROAIORPHOLOGICAL RELATIONS OF CLEAVAGE 387 

forms are concerned, though Watase does not enter into the question 
 as to how the arrangement of protoplasmic materials is effected. In 
 considering this question, we must hold fast to the fundamental fact 
 that the o,^^ is a cell, like other cells, and that from an a pi'iori point 
 of view there is every reason to believe that the cytoplasmic differ- 
 entiations that it undergoes must arise in essentially the same way as 
 in other cells. We know that such differentiations, whether in form 
 or in internal structure, show a definite relation to the environment 
 of the cell â€” to its fellows, to the source of food, and the like. We 
 know further, as Korschelt especially has pointed out, that the egg- 
 axis, as expressed by tJie eccentricity of tJie germinal vesicle, often 
 shows a defijiite relation to the ovarian tissues, the germinal vesicle 
 lying near the point of attachment or of food-supply. Mark made 
 the pregnant suggestion, in 1881, that the primary polarity of the Q.gg 
 might be determined by '^ tJie topographical relation of the ^^ (when 
 still in an indifferent state) to the remaining cells of the maternal tis- 
 sue from which it is differentiated,'" and added that this relation might 
 operate through the nutrition of the ovum. " It would certainly be 
 interesting to know if that phase of polar differentiation which is 
 manifest in the position of the nutritive substance and of the germi- 
 nal vesicle bears a constant relation to the free surface of the epithe- 
 lium from which the Qgg takes its origin. If, in cases where the Qgg 
 is directly developed from epithelial cells, this relationship were 
 demonstrable, it would be fair to infer the existence of correspond- 
 ing, though obscured, relations in those cases where (as, for example, 
 in mammals) the origin of the ovum is less directly traceable to an 
 epithehal surface." ^ The polarity of the egg would therefore be 
 comparable to the polarity of epithelial or gland-cells, where, as 
 pointed out at page 57, the nucleus usually lies toward the base of the 
 cell, near the source of food, while the centrosomes, and often also 
 characteristic cytoplasmic products, such as zymogen granules and 
 other secretions, appear in the outer portion.^ The exact conditions 
 under which the ovarian egg develops are still too little known to 
 allow of a positive conclusion regarding Mark's suggestion. More- 
 over, the force of Korschelt's observation is weakened by the fact that 
 in many eggs of the extreme telolecithal type, where the polarity is 
 very marked, the germinal vesicle occupies a central or sub-central 
 position during the period of yolk-formation and only moves toward 
 the periphery near the time of maturation. 

Indeed, in mollusks, annelids, and many other cases, the germinal 
 vesicle remains in a central position, surrounded by yolk on all sides, 
 until the spermatozoon enters. Only then does the egg-nucleus move
