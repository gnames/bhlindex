388 CELL-DIVISION AND DEVELOPMENT 

to the periphery, the deutoplasm become massed at one pole, and 
 the polarity of the ^^^ come into view {^Nereis, Figs. 60 and 97).^ In 
 such cases the axis of the egg may perhaps be predetermined by 
 the position of the centrosome, and we have still to seek the causes 
 by which the position is established in the ovarian history of the q^^. 
 These considerations show that this problem is a complex one, involv- 
 ing, as it does, the whole question of cell-polarity ; and I know of 
 no more promising field of investigation than the ovarian history of 
 the ovum with reference to this question. That Mark's view is cor- 
 rect in principle is indicated by a great array of general evidence 
 considered in the following chapter, where its bearing on the general 
 theory of development is more fully dealt with. 

C. Cell-division and Growth 

The general relations between cell-division and growth, which have 
 already been briefly considered at page 58 and in the course of this 
 chapter, may now be more critically examined, together with some 
 account of the causes that incite or inhibit division. It has been 
 shown above that every precise inquiry into the rate form, or direc- 
 tion of cell-division, inevitably merges into the larger problem of the 
 general determination of growth. We may conveniently approach 
 this subject by considering first the energy of division and the hmita- 
 tion of growth. 

All animals and plants have a limit of growth, which is, how- 
 ever, much more definite in some forms than in others, and differs 
 in different tissues. During the individual development the energy 
 of cell-division is most intense in the early stages (cleavage) and 
 diminishes more and more as the limit of growth is approached. 
 When the limit is attained a more or less definite equilibrium is estab- 
 lished, some of the cells ceasing to divide and perhaps losing this 
 power altogether (nerve-cells), others dividing only under special con- 
 ditions (connective tissue-cells, gland-cells, muscle-cells), while others 
 continue to divide throughout life, and thus replace the worn-out cells 
 of the same tissue (Malpighian layer of the epidermis, etc.). The 
 limit of size at which this state of equilibrium is attained is an heredi- 
 tary character, which in many cases shows an obvious relation to the 
 environment, and has therefore probably been determined and is 
 maintained by natural selection. From the cytological point of view 
 the limit of body-size appears to be correlated with the total miinber 
 of cells formed rather than with their individual size. This relation 
 has been carefully studied by Conklin ('96) in the case of the gastero- 

1 The immature egg of Nereis shows, however, a distinct polarity in the arrangement of 
 the fat-drops, which form a ring in the equatorial regions.
