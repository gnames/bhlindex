CELL-DIVISION AND GROWTH 389 

pod Crepidida, an animal which varies greatly in size in the mature 
 condition, the dwarfs having in some cases not more than 2V the vol- 
 ume of the giants. The eggs are, however, of the same size in all, 
 and their mitnber is proportional to the size of the adult. The same 
 is true of the tissue-cells. Measurements of cells from the epidermis, 
 the kidney, the liver, the alimentary epithelium, and other tissues 
 show that they are on the whole as large in the dwarfs as in the 
 giants. The body-size therefore depends on the total number of cells 
 rather than on their size individually considered, and the same appears 
 to be the case in plants.^ 

A result which, broadly speaking, agrees with the foregoing, is 
 given through the interesting experimental studies of Morgan ('95, i, 
 '96), supplemented by those of Driesch ('98), in which the number of 
 cells in normal larvae of echinoderms, ascidians, and AmpJiioxiis is 
 compared with those in dwarf larvae of the same species developed 
 from egg-fragments (Morgan) and isolated blastomeres (Driesch). 
 Unless otherwise specified, the following data are cited from Driesch. 

The normal blastula of Sphcerechinus possesses about 500 cells 
 (Morgan), of which from 75 to 90 invaginate to form the archenteron 
 (Driesch). In half-gastrulas the number varies from 35 to 45, occa- 
 sionally reaching 50. In the same species, the normal number of 
 mesenchyme-cells is 54 to 60, in the half-larvae 25 to 30. In EcJiinns 
 the corresponding numbers are 30 ± and 13 to 15. In the ascidian 
 larvae — a particularly favourable object — there are 29 to 35 (excep- 
 tionally as high as 40) chorda-cells ; in the half-larvae, 1 3 to 17. While 
 these comparisons are not mathematically precise, owing to the diffi- 
 culty of selecting exactly equivalent stages, they nevertheless show 
 that, on the whole, the size of the organ, as of the entire organism, is 
 directly proportional to the number and not to the size of the cells, 
 just as in the mature individuals of Crepidnla. The available data 
 are, however, too scanty to justify any very positive conclusions, and 
 it is probable that further experiment will disclose factors at present 
 unknown. It would be highly interesting to determine whether such 
 dwarf embryos could in the end restore the normal number of cells, 
 and, hence, the normal size of the body. In all the cases thus far 
 determined the dwarf gastrulas give rise to larvae {Phitei, etc.) corre- 
 spondingly dwarfed ; but their later history has not yet been sufifi- 
 ciently followed out. 

The gradual diminution of the energy of division during develop- 
 ment by no means proceeds at a uniform pace in all of the cells, and, 
 during the cleavage, the individual blastomeres are often found to 
 exhibit entirely different rhythms of division, periods of active division 
 being succeeded by long pauses, and sometimes by an entire cessa-
