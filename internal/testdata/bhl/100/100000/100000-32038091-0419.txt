CELL-DIVISION AND GROWTH 39 1 

words, each single division of the mesoblasts and each double division 
 of the ectoblasts splits off the material for a single somite ! The 
 number of these divisions, and hence of the corresponding somites, 
 is a fixed inheritance of the species. 

The causes that determine the rhythm of division, and thus finally 
 establish the adult equilibrium, are but vaguely comprehended. The 
 ultimate causes must of course lie in the inherited constitution of the 
 organism, and are referable in the last analysis to the structure of 
 the germ-cells. Every division must, however, be the response of the 
 cell to a particular set of conditions or stimuli ; and it is through the 
 investigation of these stimuli that we may hope to penetrate farther 
 into the nature of development. The immediate, specific causes of 
 cell-division are still imperfectly known. In the adult, cells may be 
 stimulated to divide by the utmost variety of agencies — by chemical 
 stimulus, as in the formation of galls, or in hyperplasia induced by 
 the injection of foreign substances into the blood ; by mechanical 
 pressure, as in the formation of calluses ; by injury, as in the heahng 
 of wounds and in the regeneration of lost parts ; and by a multitude 
 of more complex physiological and pathological conditions, — by any 
 agency, in short, that disturbs the normal equilibrium of the body. 
 In all these cases, however, it is difficult to determine the immediate 
 stimulus to division ; for a long chain of causes and effects may 
 intervene between the primary disturbance and the ultimate reaction 
 of the dividing cells. Thus there is reason to believe that the for- 
 mation of a callus is not directly caused by pressure or friction, but 
 through the determination of an increased blood-supply to the part 
 affected and a heightened nutrition of the cells. Cell-division is here 
 probably incited by local chemical changes ; and the opinion is gain- 
 ing ground that the immediate causes of division, whatever their 
 antecedents, are to be sought in this direction. That such is the 
 case is indicated by nothing more clearly than the recent experiments 
 on the Qgg by R. Hertwig, Mead, Morgan, and Loeb already referred 
 to in part at pages 1 1 1 and 215. The egg-cell is, in most cases, stimu- 
 lated to divide by the entrance of the spermatozoon, but in partheno- 
 genesis exactly the same result is produced by an apparently quite 
 different cause. The experiments in question give, however, ground 
 for the conclusion that the common element in the two cases is a 
 chemical stimulus. In the eggs of Chcetopterus under normal condi- 
 tions the first polar mitosis pauses at the anaphase until the entrance 
 of the spermatozoon, when the mitotic activity is resumed and both 
 polar bodies are formed. Mead ('98) shows, however, that the same 
 effect may be prpduced without fertilization by placing the eggs for 
 a few minutes in a weak solution of potassium chloride. In like 
 manner R. Hertwig ('96) and Morgan ('99) show that unfertilized
