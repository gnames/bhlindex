392 CELL-DIVISION AND DEVELOPMENT 

echinoderm-eggs may be stimulated to division by treatment with 
 weak solution of strychnine, sodium-chloride, and other reagents, the 
 result being here more striking than in the case of CJicBtopterus, since 
 the entire mitotic system is formed anew under the chemical stimulus. 
 The climax of these experiments is reached in Loeb's artificial pro- 
 duction of parthenogenesis in sea-urchin eggs by treatment with dilute 
 magnesium chloride. Beside these interesting results may be placed 
 the remarkable facts of gall-formation in plants, which seem to leave 
 no doubt that extremely complex and characteristic abnormal growths 
 may result from specific chemical stimuli, and many pathologists 
 have held that tumours and other pathological growths in the animal 
 body may be incited through disturbances of circulation or other 
 causes resulting in abnormal local chemical conditions.^ 

But while we have gained some light on the immediate causes of 
 division, we have still to inquire how those causes are set in opera- 
 tion and are coordinated toward a typical end ; and we are thus 
 brought again to the general problem of growth. A very interesting 
 suggestion is the resistance-theory of Thiersch and Boll, according 
 to which each tissue continues to grow up to the limit afforded by 
 the resistance of neighbouring tissues or organs. The removal or 
 lessening of this resistance through injury or disease causes a resump- 
 tion of growth and division, leading either to the regeneration of the 
 lost parts or to the formation of abnormal growths. Thus the 
 removal of a salamander's limb would seem to remove a barrier to 
 the proliferation and growth of the remaining cells. These processes 
 are therefore resumed, and continue until the normal barrier is re- 
 established by the regeneration. To speak of such a "barrier" or 
 "resistance" is, however, to use a highly figurative phrase which is 
 not to be construed in a rude mechanical sense. There is no doubt 
 that hypertrophy, atrophy, or displacement of particular parts often 
 leads to compensatory changes in the neighbouring parts ; but it is 
 equally certain that such changes are not a direct mechanical effect 
 of the disturbance, but a highly complex physiological response to it. 
 How complex the problem is, is shown by the fact that even closely 
 related animals may differ widely in this respect. Thus Fraisse has 
 shown that the salamander may completely regenerate an amputated 
 limb, while the frog only heals the wound without further regenera- 
 tion.^ Again, in the case of coelenterates, Loeb and Bickford have 
 shown that the tubularian hydroids are able to regenerate the ten- 
 tacles at both ends of a segment of the stem, while the polyp Cerian- 
 thiis can regenerate them only at the distal end of a section (Fig. 194^.

2 In salamanders regeneration only takes place when the bone is cut across, and does not 
 occur if the limb be exarticulated and removed at the joint.
