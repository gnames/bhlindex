CELL-DIVISION AND GROWTH 393 

In the latter case, therefore, the body possesses an inherent polarity 
 which cannot be overturned by external conditions. A very curious 
 case is that of the earthworm, which has long been known to possess 
 a high regenerative capacity. If the posterior region of the worm 
 be cut off, a new tail is usually regenerated. If the same operation 
 be performed far forward in the anterior region, a new head is often 
 formed at the front end of the posterior piece. If, however, the sec- 
 tion be in the middle region the posterior piece sometimes regenerates 
 a head, but more usually a tail, as was long since shown by Spallanzani 
 and recently by Morgan ('99). Why such a blunder should be com- 
 mitted remains for the present quite unexplained. 

It remains to inquire more critically into the nature of the correla- 
 tion between growth and cell-division. In the growing tissues the 
 direction of the division-planes in the individual cells evidently stands 
 in a definite relation with the axes of growth in the body, as is espe- 
 cially clear in the case of rapidly elongating structures (apical buds, 
 teloblasts, and the like), where the division-planes are predominantly 
 transverse to the axis of elongation. Which of these is the primary 
 factor, the direction of general growth or the direction of the division- 
 planes .'' This question is a difficult one to answer, for the two phe- 
 nomena are often too closely related to be disentangled. As far as 
 the plants are concerned, however, it has been conclusively shown by 
 Hofmeister, De Bary, and Sachs that the growth of the mass is the 
 primary factor ; for the characteristic mode of growth is often shown 
 by the growing mass before it splits up into cells, and the form of 
 cell-division adapts itself to that of the mass : " Die Pflanze bildet 
 Zellen, nicht die Zelle bildet Pflanzen " (De Bary). 

Much of the recent work in normal and experimental embryology, 
 as well as that on regeneration, indicates that the same is true in prin- 
 ciple of animal growth. Among recent writers who have urged this 
 view should be mentioned Rauber, Hertwig, Adam Sedgwick, and 
 especially Whitman, whose fine essay on the Inadequacy of the Cell- 
 theory of Development ('93) marks a distinct advance in our point of 
 view. Still more recently this view has been almost demonstrated 
 through some remarkable experiments on regeneration, which show 
 that definitely formed material, in some cases even the adult tissues, 
 may be directly moulded into nczv structures. Driesch has shown 
 ('95, 2, '99) that if gastrulas of Sphcsrechinus be bisected through the 
 equator so that each half contains both ectoderm and entoderm, the 
 wounds heal, each half forming a typical gastrula, in which the ente- 
 ron differentiates itself into the three typical regions (fore, middle, 
 and hind gut) correctly proportioned, though the whole structure is 
 but half the normal size. Here, therefore, the formative process is in 
 the main independent of cell-division or increase in size. Miss Bickford
