THE THEORY OF GERMINAL LOCALIZATION 397 

damental aspects as great a riddle as they were to the Greeks. What 
 we have gained is a tolerably precise acquaintance with the external 
 aspects of development. The gross errors of the early preformation- 
 ists have been dispelled.^ We know that the germ-cell contains no 
 predelineated embryo ; that development is manifested, on the one 
 hand, by the cleavage of the &gg, on the other hand, by a process of 
 differentiation, through which the products of cleavage gradually 
 assume diverse forms and functions, and so accomplish a physiological 
 division of labour. We can clearly recognize the fact that these pro- 
 cesses fall in the same category as those that take place in the tissue- 
 cells ; for the cleavage of the ovum is a form of mitotic cell-division, 
 while, as many eminent naturalists have perceived, differentiation is 
 nearly related to growth and has its root in the phenomena of nutri- 
 tion and metabolism. The real problem of development is the orderly 
 sequence and correlation of these pJienomena toivard a typical result. 
 We cannot escape the conclusion that this is the outcome of the 
 organization of the germ-cells ; but the nature of that which, for lack 
 of a better term, we call " organization," is and doubtless long will 
 remain almost wholly in the dark. 

In the following discussion, which is necessarily compressed wdthin 
 narrow limits, we shall disregard the earlier baseless speculations, 
 such as those of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, which 
 attempted a merely formal solution of the problem, confining our- 
 selves to more recent discussions that have grown directly out of 
 modern research. An introduction to the general subject may be 
 given by a preliminary examination of two central hypotheses about 
 which most recent discussions have revolved. These are, first, the 
 theory of Germinal Localisation'^ of Wilhelm His ('74), and, second, 
 the Idioplasm Hypothesis of Nageli ('84). The relation between these 
 two conceptions, close as it is, is not at first sight very apparent ; 
 and for the purpose of a preliminary sketch they may best be con- 
 sidered separately. 

A. The Theory of Germinal Localization 

Although the na'ive early theory of preformation and evolution was 
 long since abandoned, yet we find an after-image of it in the theory 
 of germinal localization which in one form or another has been advo- 
 cated by some of the foremost students of development. It is main- 
 tained that, although the embryo is not ^^x^tforiiicd in the germ, it must 
 nevertheless be ^x^dctcrniincd in the sense that the Q.gg contains
