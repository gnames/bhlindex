398 INHERITANCE AND DEVELOPMENT 

definite areas or definite substances predestined for the formation of 
 corresponding parts of the embryonic body. The first clear state- 
 ment of this conception is found in the interesting and suggestive 
 work of Wilhehn His ('74) entitled Unsere Kdrpei'form. Considering 
 the development of the chick, he says : " It is clear, on the one hand, 
 that every point in the embryonic region of the blastoderm must rep- 
 resent a later organ or part of an organ, and, on the other hand, that 
 every organ developed from the blo-stoderm has its preformed germ 
 (vorgebildete Anlage) in a definitely located region of the fiat germ- 
 disc. . . . The material of the germ is already present in the flat 
 germ-disc, but is not yet morphologically marked off and hence 
 not directly recognizable. But by following the development back- 
 wards we may determine the location of every such germ, even at a 
 period when the morphological differentiation is incomplete or before 
 it occurs ; logically, indeed, we must extend this process back to the 
 fertilized or even the unfertilized Q,gg. According to this principle, 
 the germ-disc contains the organ-germs spread out in a flat plate, and, 
 conversely, every point of the germ-disc reappears in a later organ ; 
 I call this the principle of organ- forming germ-regions T ^ His thus 
 conceived the embryo, not as ]ivtfonned, but as having all of its parts 
 ^xQlocalized in the egg-protoplasm (cytoplasm). 

A great impulse to this conception was given during the follow- 
 ing decade by discoveries relating, on the one hand, to protoplasmic 
 structure, on the other hand, to the promorphological relations of the 
 ovum. Ray Lankester writes, in 1877: "Though the substance of a 
 celP may appear homogeneous under the most powerful microscope, 
 it is quite possible, indeed certain, that it may contain, already formed 
 and individualized, various kinds of physiological molecules. The 
 visible process of segregation is only the sequel of a differentiation 
 already established, and not visible."^ The egg-cytoplasm has a defi- 
 nite molecular organization directly handed down from the parent ; 
 cleavage sunders the various " physiological molecules " and iso- 
 lates them in particular cells. Whitman expresses a similar thought 
 in the following year : "While we cannot say that the embryo is pre- 
 delineated, we can say that it is predetermined. The ' histogenetic 
 sundering ' of embryonic elements begins with the cleavage, and every 
 step in the process bears a definite and invariable relation to antece- 
 dent and subsequent steps. ... It is, therefore, not surprising to 
 find certain important histological differentiations and fundamental 
 structural relations anticipated in the early phases of cleavage, and 
 foreshadowed even before cleavage begins." * It was, however, Flem-
