THE IDIOPLASM THEORY 4OI 

difficulty and complexity of the problem. From his latest essay, in- 
 deed ('94), it is not easy to gather his precise position regarding the 
 theory of cytoplasmic localization. Through all his writings, never- 
 theless, runs the leading idea that the germ is definitely organized 
 before development begins, and that cleavage only reveals an organi- 
 zation that exists from the beginning. " That organization precedes 
 cell-formation and regulates it, rather than the reverse, is a conclu- 
 sion that forces itself upon us from many sides." ^ " The organism 
 exists before cleavage sets in, and persists throughout every stage of 
 cell-multiplication." ^ 

All of these views, excepting those of Roux, lean more or less 
 distinctly toward the conclusion that the cytoplasm of the egg-cell 
 is from the first mapped out, as it were, into regions which corre- 
 spond with the parts of the future embryonic body. The cleavage 
 of the ovum does not create these regions, but only reveals them to 
 view by marking off their boundaries. Their topographical arrange- 
 ment in the Q.gg does not necessarily coincide with that of the adult 
 parts, but only involves the latter as a necessary consequence — some- 
 what as a picture in the kaleidoscope gives rise to a succeeding pic- 
 ture composed of the same parts in a different arrangement. The 
 germinal localization may, however, in a greater or less degree, fore- 
 shadow the arrangement of adult parts — for instance, in the ^gg of 
 the tunicate or cephalopod, where the bilateral symmetry and antero- 
 posterior differentiation of the adult is foreshadowed not only in the 
 cleavage stages, but even in the unsegmented Q.gg. 

By another set of writers, such as Roux, De Vries, Hertwig, and 
 Weismann, germinal localization is primarily sought not in the cyto- 
 plasm, but in the nucleus ; but these views can be best considered 
 after a review of the idioplasm hypothesis, to which we now proceed. 

B. The Idioplasm Theory 

We owe to Nageli the first systematic attempt to discuss heredity 
 regarded as inherent in a definite physical basis ; ^ but it is hardly 
 necessary to point out his great debt to earlier writers, foremost 
 among them Darwin, Herbert Spencer, and Hackel. The essence of 
 Nageli's hypothesis was the assumption that inheritance is effected 
 by the transmission not of a cell, considered as a whole, but of a par- 
 ticular substance, the idioplasm, contained within a cell, and forming 
 the physical basis of heredity. The idioplasm is to be sharply dis- 
 tinguished from the other constituents of the cell, which play no 
 direct part in inheritance and form a "nutritive plasma" or tropJio-
