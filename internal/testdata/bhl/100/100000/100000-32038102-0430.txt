402 INHERITANCE AND DEVELOPMENT 

plasm. Hereditary traits are the outcome of a definite molecular 
 organization of the idioplasm. The hen's Q.^g differs from the frog's 
 because it contains a different idioplasm. The species is as com- 
 pletely contained in the one as in the other, and the hen's egg differs 
 from a frog's Q.gg as widely as a hen from a frog. 

The idioplasm was conceived as an extremely complex substance, 
 consisting of elementary complexes of molecules known as micellce. 
 These are variously grouped to form units of higher orders, which, 
 as development proceeds, determine the development of the adult 
 cells, tissues, and organs. The specific peculiarities of the idioplasm 
 are therefore due to the arrangement of the micellae ; and this, in its 
 turn, is owing to dynamic properties of the micellae themselves. 
 During development the idioplasm undergoes a progressive trans- 
 formation of its substance, not through any material change, but 
 through dynamic alterations of the conditions of tension and move- 
 ment of the micellae. These changes in the idioplasm cause reactions 
 on the part of surrounding structures leading to definite chemical and 
 plastic changes, i.e. to differentiation and development. 

Nageli made no attempt to locate the idioplasm precisely or to 
 identify it with any of the known morphological constituents of the 
 cell. It was somewhat vaguely conceived as a network extending 
 through both nucleus and cytoplasm, and from cell to cell through- 
 out the entire organism. Almost immediately after the publication 
 of his theory, however, several of the foremost leaders of biological 
 investigation were led to locate the idioplasm in the nucleus, and 
 concluded that it is to be identified with chromatin. The grounds 
 for this conclusion, which have already been stated in Chapter VII., 
 may be here again briefly reviewed. The beautiful experiments 
 of Nussbaum, Gruber, and Verworn proved that the regeneration 
 of differentiated cytoplasmic structures in the Protozoa can only 
 take place when nuclear matter is present {cf. p. 342). The study of 
 fertilization by Hertwig, Strasburger, and Van Beneden proved that 
 in the sexual reproduction of both plants and animals the nucleus of 
 the germ is equally derived from both sexes, while the cytoplasm is 
 derived almost entirely from the female. The two germ-nuclei, which 
 by their union give rise to that of the germ, were shown by Van 
 Beneden to be of exactly the same morphological nature, since each 
 gives rise to chromosomes of the same number, form, and size. Van 
 Beneden and Boveri proved (p. 182) that the paternal and maternal 
 nuclear substances are equally distributed to each of the first two 
 cells, and the more recent work of Hacker, Riickert, Herla, and 
 Zoja establishes a strong probability that this equal distribution con- 
 tinues in the later divisions. Roux pointed out the telling fact that 
 the entire complicated mechanism of mitosis seems designed to affect
