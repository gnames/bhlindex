book on the germ-plasm ('92). Accepting De Vries's conception of 
 the pangens, he assumes a definite grouping of these bodies in the 
 germ-plasm or idioplasm (chromatin), somewhat as in Nageli's concep- 
 tion. The pangens or biopJwres are conceived to be successively ag- 
 gregated in larger and larger groups; namely, {\^ determinants, which 
 are still beyond the limits of microscopical vision ; (2) ids, which are 
 identified with the visible chromatin-granules ; and (3) idants, or 
 chromosomes. The chromatin has, therefore, a highly complex fixed 
 architecture, which is transmitted from generation to generation, and 
 determines the development of the embryo in a definite and specific 
 manner. Mitotic division is conceived as an apparatus which may 
 distribute the elements of the chromatin to the daughter-nuclei either 
 equally or unequally. In the former c2iS,Q {" hoin(sokiiiesis," integral 
 or quantitative division), the resulting nuclei remain precisely equiva- 
 lent. In the second C2is& {" heterokinesis," qiuilitative ox dijferential 
 division), the daughter-cells receive different groups of chromatin- 
 elements, and hence become differently modified. During ontogeny, 
 through successive qualitative divisions, the elements of the idioplasm 
 or gerni-plasni (chromatin) are gradually sifted apart, and distributed 
 in a definite and predetermined manner to the various parts of the 
 body. " Ontogeny depends on a gradual process of disintegration of 
 the id of germ-plasm, which splits into smaller and smaller groups of 
 determinants in the development of each individual. . . . Finally, 
 if we neglect possible complications, only one kind of determinant re- 
 mains in each cell, viz. that which has to control that particular cell or 
 group of cells. ... In this cell it breaks up into its constituent bio- 
 phores, and gives the cell its inherited specific character." ^ Devel- 
 opment is, therefore, essentially evolutionary and not epigenetic ; ^ its 
 point of departure is a substance in which all of the adult characters 
 are represented by preformed, prearranged germs ; its course is the 
 result of a predetermined harmony in the succession of the qualitative 
 divisions by which the hereditary substance is progressively disinte- 
 grated. In order to account for heredity through successive genera- 
 tions, Weismann is obliged to assume that, by means of quantitative 
 or integral division, a certain part of the original germ-plasm is car- 
 ried on unchanged, and is finally delivered, with its original architecture 
 unaltered, to the germ-nuclei. The power of regeneration is explained, 
 in like manner, as the result of a transmission of unmodified or slightly 
 modified germ-plasm to those parts capable of regeneration.
