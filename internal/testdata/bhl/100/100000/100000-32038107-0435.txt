E. Critique of the Roux-Weismann Theory 

It is impossible not to admire the thoroughness, candour, and logical 
 skill with which Weismann has developed his theory, or to deny that, 
 in its final form, it does afford up to a certain point a formal solution 
 of the problems with which it deals. Its fundamental weakness is its

 of the germ-cells ("reducing divisions"), none of the visible phenom- 
 ena of cell-division give even a remote suggestion of qualitative divi-

 the division of the chromatin is carried out with the most exact equality.
