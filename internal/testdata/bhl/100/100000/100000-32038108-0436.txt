INHERITANCE AND DEVELOPMENT 

The hypothesis mainly rests upon a quite different order of phenom- 
 ena, namely, on facts indicating that isolated blastomeres, or other 
 cells, have a certain power of self-determination, or " self-differentia- 
 tion" (Roux), peculiar to themselves, and which is assumed to be pri- 
 marily due to the specific quality of the nuclei. This assumption, 
 which may or may not be true,^ is itself based upon the further assump- 
 tion of qualitative nuclear division of which we actually know nothing 
 whatever. The fundamental hypothesis is thus of purely a priori 
 character; and every fact opposed to it has been met by subsidi-

ary hypotheses, which, like their principal, relate to matters beyond 
 the reach of observation. 

Such an hypothesis cannot be actually overturned by a direct 
 appeal to fact. We can, however, make an indirect appeal, the 
 results of which show that the hypothesis of qualitative division is 
 not only so improbable as to lose all semblance of reality, but is in 
 fact quite superfluous. It is rather remarkable that Roux himself 
 led the way in this direction. In the course of his observations on 
 the development of a half-embryo from one of the blastomeres of 
 the two-cell stage of the frog's e.gg, he determined the significant 
 fact that the half-embryo in the end restores more or less completely
