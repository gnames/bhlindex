410 INHERITANCE AND DEVELOPMENT 

eggs separated by shaking to pieces the two-cell and four-cell stages. 
 Blastomeres thus isolated segment as if still forming part of an entire 
 larva, and give rise to a half- (or quarter-) blastula (Fig. 183). The 
 opening soon closes, however, to form a small complete blastula, and 
 the resulting gastrula and Pluteus larva is a perfectly formed dwarf 
 of only half (or quarter) the normal size. Incompletely separated 
 blastomeres give rise to double embryos like the Siamese twins. 
 Shortly afterward the writer obtained similar results in the case of 
 AmpJiioxiis, but here the isolated blastomere behaves front the begin- 
 ning like a complete ovum of half the nsnal size, and gives rise to a 
 complete blastula, gastrula, and larva. Complete embryos have also 
 been obtained from a single blastomere in the teleost Fimdnlns 
 (Morgan, '95, 2), in Triton (Herlitzka, '95), and in a number of 
 hydromedusse (Zoja, '95, Bunting, '99); and nearly complete em- 
 bryos in the tunicates Ascidiella (Chabry, '^'J^ Phalhtsia (Driesch, 
 '94), and Molgiila (Crampton, '98).^ Perhaps the most striking of 
 these cases is that of the hydroid Clytia, in which Zoja was able to 
 obtain perfect embryos, not only from the blastomeres of the two- 
 cell and four-cell stages, but from eight-cell and even from sixteen- 
 cell stages, the dwarfs in the last case being but one-sixteenth the 
 normal size. 

These experiments render highly improbable the hypothesis of 
 qualitative division in its strict form, for they demonstrate that the 
 earlier cleavages, at least, do not in these cases sunder fundamentally 
 different materials, either nuclear or cytoplasmic, but only split the 
 Qgg up into a number of parts, each of which is capable of producing 
 an entire body of diminished size, and hence m.ust contain all of the 
 material essential to complete development. Both Roux and Weis- 
 mann endeavour to meet this adverse evidence with the assumption 
 of a " reserve idioplasm," containing all of the elements of the germ- 
 plasm which is in these cases distributed equally to all the cells in 
 addition to the specific chromatin conveyed to them by qualitative 
 division. This subsidiary hypothesis renders the principal one {i.e. 
 that of qualitative division) superfluous, and brings us back to the 
 same problems that arise when the assumption of qualitative division 
 is discarded. 

The theory of qualitative nuclear division has been practically dis- 
 proved in another way by Driesch, through the pressure-experiments 
 already mentioned at page 375. Following the earlier experiments of 
 Pfluger ('84) and Roux ('85) on the frog's Qgg, Driesch subjected 
 segmenting eggs of the sea-urchin to pressure, and thus obtained fiat 
 plates of cells in which the arrangement of the nuclei differed totally 

^ The " partial " development in the earlier stages of some of these forms is considered 
 at page 419.
