from the normal (Fig. 186); yet such eggs when released from press- 
 ure continue to segment, ivitJioitt rearrangcDient of the nuclei, and 
 give rise to perfectly normal larvae. I have repeated these experi- 
 ments not only with sea-urchin eggs, but also with those of an annelid 
 {Nereis), which yield a very convincing result, since in this case the 
 histological differentiation of the cells appears very early. In the 
 normal development of this animal the archenteron arises from four 
 large cells or macromeres (entomeres), which remain after the suc- 
 cessive formation of three quartets of micromeres (ectomeres ) and the 
 parent-cell of the mesoblast. After the primary differentiation of 
 the germ-layers the four entomeres do not divide again until a very 
 late period (free-swimming trochophore), and their substance always 
 retains a characteristic appearance, differing from that of the other

blastomeres in its pale non-granular character and in the presence of 
 large oil-drops. If unsegmented eggs be subjected to pressure, as in 
 Driesch's echinoderm experiments, they segment in a flat plate, all 
 of the cleavages being vertical. In this way are formed eight-celled 
 plates in which all of the cells contain oil-drops (Fig. 187, D). If 
 they are now released from the pressure, each of the cells divides in 
 a plane approximately horizontal, a smaller granular micromere being- 
 formed above, leaving below a larger clear macromere in which the 
 oil-drops remain. The sixteen-cell stage, therefore, consists of eight 
 deutoplasm-laden macromeres and eight protoplasmic micromeres 
 (instead of four macromeres and twelve micromeres, as in the usual 
 development). These embryos developed into free-swimming trocho- 
 phores containing eight instead of four macromeres, which have the 
 typical clear protoplasm containing oil-drops. In this case there can
