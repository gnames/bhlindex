INHERITANCE AND DEVELOPMENT 

be no doubt whatever that four of the entoblastic nuclei were nor- 
 mally destined for the first quartet of micromeres (Fig. 187, B), from 
 which arise the apical ganglia and the prototroch. Under the condi- 
 tions of the experiment, however, they have given rise to the nuclei 
 of cells which differ in no wise from the other entoderm-cells. Even

A. B. Normal four- and eight-cell stages. C. Normal trochophore larva resulting, with four 
 entoderm-cells. D. Eight-cell stage arising from an egg flattened by pressure ; such eggs give rise 
 to trochophores with eight instead of four entoderm-cells. Numerals designate the successive 
 cleavages. 

in a highly differentiated type of cleavage, therefore, the nuclei of the 
 segmenting o.g'g are not specifically different, as the Roux-Weismann 
 hypothesis demands, but contain the same materials even in the cells 
 that undergo the most diverse subsequent fate. But there is, further- 
 more, very strong reason for believing that this may be true in later
