stages as well, as Kolliker insisted in opposition to Weismann as 
 early as 1886, and as has been urged by many subsequent writers. 
 The strongest evidence in this direction is afforded by the facts of 
 regeneration; and many cases are known — for instance, among the 
 hydroids and the plants — in which even a small fragment of the 
 body is able to reproduce the whole. It is true that the power of 
 regeneration is always limited to a greater or less extent according 
 to the species. But there is no evidence whatever that such limita- 
 tion arises through specification of the nuclei by qualitative division, 
 and, as will appear beyond, its explanation is probably to be sought 
 in a very different direction. 

F. On the Nature and Causes of Differentiation . 

We have now cleared the ground for a restatement of the problem 
 of development and an examination of the views opposed to the 
 Roux-Weismann theory. After discarding the hypothesis of quali- 
 tative division the problem confronts us in the following form. If 
 chromatin be the idioplasm in which inheres the sum total of heredi- 
 tary forces, and if it be equally distributed at every cell-division, how 
 can its mode of action so vary in different cells as to cause diversity 
 of structure, i.e. differentiation ? It is perfectly certain that differen- 
 tiation is an actual progressive transformation of the egg-substance 
 involving both physical and chemical changes, occurring in a definite 
 order, and showing a definite distribution in the regions of the &gg. 
 These changes are sooner or later accompanied by the cleavage 
 of the Qgg into cells whose boundaries may sharply mark the 
 areas of differentiation. What gives these cells their specific char- 
 acter.? Why, in the four-cell stage of an annelid &gg, should the 
 four cells contribute equally to the formation of the alimentary canal 
 and the cephalic nervous system, while only one of them (the left- 
 hand posterior) gives rise to the nervous system of the trunk-region 
 and to the muscles, connective tissues, and the germ-cells .-* (Figs. 
 171, 188, B.) There cannot be a fixed relation between the various 
 regions of the egg which these blastomeres represent and the adult 
 parts arising from them ; for in some eggs these relations may be 
 artificially changed. A portion of the egg which under normal con- 
 ditions would give rise to only a fragment of the body will, if split off 
 from the rest, give rise to an entire body of diminished size. What 
 then determines the history of such a portion .? What influence 
 moulds it now into an entire body, now into a part of a body .-• 

De Vries, in his remarkable essay on Intracellular Pangenesis 
 ('89), endeavoured to cut this Gordian knot by assuming that the 
 character of each cell is determined by pangens that migrate from
