NATURE AND CAUSES OF DIFFERENTIATION 415 

ment. Hertwig insisted that the organism develops as a whole as 
 the result of a physiological interaction of equivalent blastomeres, 
 the transformation of each being due not to an inherent specific 
 power of self-differentiation, as Roux's mosaic-theory assumed, but 
 to the action upon it of the whole system of which it is a part. 
 "According to my conception," said Hertwig, "each of the first two 
 blastomeres contains the formative and differentiating forces not 
 simply for the production of a half-body, but for the entire organism ; 
 the left blastomere develops into the left half of the body only because 
 it is placed in relation to a right blastomere." ^ Again, in a later 
 paper : " The o.^^ is a specifically organized elementary organism that 
 develops epigenetically by breaking up into cells and their subsequent 
 differentiation. Since every elementary part {i.e. cell) arises through 
 the division of the germ, or fertilized &^g, it contains also the germ 
 of the whole, but during the process of development it becomes ever 
 more precisely differentiated and determined by the formation of 
 cytoplasmic products according to its position with reference to the 
 entire organism (blastula, gastrula, etc.)."^ 

An essentially similar view was advocated by the writer ('93, '94) 
 nearly at the same time, and the same general conception was ex- 
 pressed with great clearness and precision by Driesch shortly after 
 Hertwig: "The fragments (i.e. cells) produced by cleavage are com- 
 pletely equivalent or indifferent." "The blastomeres of the sea- 
 urchin are to be regarded as forming a uniform material, and they 
 may be thrown about, like balls in a pile, without in the least degree 
 impairing thereby the normal power of development."^ '^ The rela- 
 tive position of a blastomere in the whole determines in general zvJiat 
 develops froin it ; if its position be changed, it gives rise to something 
 different ; in other words, its prospective value is a function of its 
 position. "* 

In this last aphorism the whole problem of development is brought 
 to a focus. It is clearly not a solution of the problem, but only a 
 highly suggestive restatement of it ; for everything turns upon how 
 the relation of the part to the whole is conceived. Very little con- 
 sideration is required to show that this relation cannot be a merely 
 geometrical or rudely mechanical one, for in the eggs of different

^ '93> P- 793- It should be pointed out that Roux himself in several papers expressly 
 recognizes the fact that development cannot be regarded as a pure mosaic-work, and that 
 besides the power of self-differentiation postulated by his hypothesis we must assume a 
 " correlative differentiation " or differentiating interaction of parts in the embryo. Cf. Roux,
