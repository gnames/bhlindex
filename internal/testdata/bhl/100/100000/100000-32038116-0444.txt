41 6 INHERITANCE AND DEVELOPMENT 

animals blastomeres may almost exactly correspond in origin and 
 relative position, yet differ widely in their relation to the resulting 
 embryo. Thus we find that the cleavage of polyclades, annelids, and 
 gasteropods (Fig. i88) shows a really wonderful agreement in form, 
 yet the individual cells differ markedly in prospective value. In all 
 of these forms three quartets of micromeres are successively formed 
 according to exactly the same remarkable law of the alternation of the 
 spirals ; ^ and, in all, the posterior cell of a fourth quartet lies at the 
 hinder end of the embryo in precisely the same geometrical relation 
 to the remainder of the embryo ; yet in the gasteropods and annelids 
 this cell gives rise to the mesoblast-bands and their products, in the 
 polyclade to a part of the archenteron, while important differences 
 also exist in the value of the other quartets. The relation of the 
 part to the whole is therefore of a highly subtle character, the pro- 
 spective value of a blastomere depending not merely upon its geomet- 
 rical position, but upon its relation to the whole complex inherited 
 organization of which it forms a part. The apparently simple con- 
 clusion stated in Driesch's clever aphorism thus leads to further prob- 
 lems of the highest complexity. It should be here pointed out that 
 Driesch does not accept Hertwig's theory of the interaction of blasto- 
 meres as such, but, like Whitman, Morgan, and others, has brought 
 forward effective arguments against that too simple and mechanical 
 conception. That theory is, in fact, merely Schwann's cell-composite 
 theory of the organism applied to the developing embryo, and the 
 general arguments against that theory find some of their strongest 
 support in the facts of growth and development.^ This has been 
 forcibly urged by Whitman ('93), who almost simultaneously with the 
 statements of Driesch and Hertwig, cited above, expressed the con- 
 viction that the morphogenic process cannot be conceived as merely 
 the sum total or resultant of the individual cell-activities, but operates 
 as a unit without respect to cell-boundaries, precisely as De Bary con- 
 cludes in the case of growing plant-tissues (p. 393), and the nature 
 of that process is due to the organization of the Q.gg as a whole. 

While recognizing fully the great value of the results attained 
 during the past few years in the field of experimental and specula- 
 tive embryology, we are constrained to admit that as far as the 
 essence of the problem is concerned we have not gone very far 
 beyond the conclusions stated above ; for beyond the fact that the 
 inherited organization is involved in that of the germ-cells we remain 
 quite ignorant of its essential nature. This has been recognized by 
 no one more clearly than by Driesch himself, to whose critical 
 researches we owe so much in this field. At the climax of a recent 
 elaborate analysis, the high interest of which is somewhat obscured by
