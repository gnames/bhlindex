INHERITANCE AND DEVEIOPMENT 

We now proceed to the consideration of experiments which show 
 that in some animal eggs such predetermination may go much farther, 
 so that the development does, in fact, show many of the features of 
 a mosaic-work, as maintained by Roux. The best-determined of these 
 cases is that of the ctenophore-egg, as shown by the work of Chun,

A. Half sixteen-cell stage, from an isolated blastomere. B. Resulting larva, with four rows of 
 swimming-plates and three gastric pouches. C. One-fourth sixteen-cell stage, from an isolated 
 blastomere. D. Resulting larva, with two rows of plates and two gastric pouches. E. Defective 
 larva, with six rows of plates and three gastric pouches, from a nucleated fragment of an unseg- 
 mented egg. F. Similar larva with five rows of plates, from above. 

Driesch, and Morgan ('95), and Fischel ('98). These observers have 
 demonstrated that isolated blastomeres of the two-, four-, or eight-cell 
 stage undergo a cleavage which, through the earliest stages, is exactly 
 like that which it would have undergone if forming part of a com-
