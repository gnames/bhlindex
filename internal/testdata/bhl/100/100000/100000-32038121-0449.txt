 neither in the nucleus nor in the form of the mass, we must seek them 
 in the cytoplasm ; and if we find here factors by which the tendency 
 of the part to develop into a whole may be, as it were, hemmed in, we 
 shall reach a proximate explanation of the mosaic-like character of 
 cleavage shown in the forms under consideration, and the mosaic
