theory of cytoplasmic localization will find a substantial if somewhat 
 restricted basis. 

That we are here approaching the true explanation is indicated by 
 certain very remarkable and interesting experiments on the frog's o-^^, 
 which prove that each of the first two blastomeres may give rise either 
 to a half-embryo or to a whole embryo of half size, according to cir- 
 cumstances, and which indicate, furthermore, that these circumstances 
 lie in a measure in the arrangement of the cytoplasmic materials. 
 This most important result, which we owe especially to Morgan,^ was 
 reached in the following manner. Born had shown, in 1885, that if 
 frogs' eggs be fastened in an abnormal position, — e.g. upside down, or 
 on the side, — a rearrangement of the egg-material takes place, the 
 heavier deutoplasm sinking toward the lower side, while the nucleus 
 and protoplasm rise. A new axis is thus established in the egg, which 
 has the same relation to the body-axes as in the ordinary develop- 
 ment (though the pigment retains its original arrangement). This 
 proves that in eggs of this character (telolecithal) the distribution of 
 deutoplasm, or conversely of protoplasm, is one of the primary forma- 
 tive conditions of the cytoplasm ; and the significant fact is that by 
 artificially changing this distribiition the axis of the embryo is shifted. 
 Oscar Schultze ('94) discovered that if the Q,g^ be turned upside down 
 when in the two-cell stage, a whole embryo (or half of a double 
 embryo) may arise from each blastomere instead of a half-embryo 
 as in the normal development, and that the axes of these embryos 
 show no constant relation to one another (Fig. 191). Morgan ('95, 3) 
 added the important discovery that either a half-embryo or a whole 
 half-sized dwarf might be formed, according to the position of the blas- 
 tomere. If, after destruction of one blastomere, the other be allowed 
 to remain in its normal position, a half-embryo always results,^ pre- 
 cisely as described by Roux. If, on the other hand, the blastomere 
 be inverted, it may give rise either to a half-embryo ^ or to a whole 
 dwarf.* Morgan therefore concluded that the production of whole 
 embryos by the inverted blastomeres was, in part at least, due to a 
 rearrangement or rotation of the egg-materials under the influence of 
 gravity, the blastomere thus returning, as it were, to a state of equilib- 
 rium like that of an entire ovum. 

This beautiful experiment gives most conclusive evidence that each 
 of the two blastomeres contains all the materials, nuclear and cyto- 
 plasmic, necessary for the formation of a whole body ; and that these 
 materials may be used to build a whole body or half-body, according 
 to the grouping that they assume. After the first cleavage takes
