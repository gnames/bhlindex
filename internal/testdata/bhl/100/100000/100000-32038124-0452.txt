INHERITANCE AND DEVELOPMENT 

show that here the substance of the attraction-spheres is unequally 
 distributed, in a quite definite way, among the cleavage-cells, each 
 sphere of a daughter-cell being carried over bodily into one of the 
 granddaughter-cells (Fig. 192). We have here a substantial basis for 
 the conclusion that in cleavage of this type qualitative division of the 
 cytoplasm may occur. 

It is important not to lose sight of the fact that development and 
 differentiation do not in any proper sense first begin with the cleavage 
 of the ovum, but long before this, during its ovarian history.^ The 
 primary differentiations thus established in the cytoplasm form the 
 immediate conditions to which the later development must conform ; 
 and the difference between Amphioxns on the one hand, and the

In both figures the old spheres (dotted) lie at the upper pole of the embryo, and at the third 
 cleavage they pass into the four respective cells of the first quartet of micromeres. The centro- 
 somes are seen in the new spheres. 

snail or ctenophore on the other, simply means, I think, that the 
 initial differentiation is less extensive or less firmly established in 
 the one than in the other. 

The origin of the cytoplasmic differentiations existing at the be- 
 ginning of cleavage has already been considered (p. 386). If the 
 conclusions there reached be placed beside the above, we reach the 
 following conception. The primary determining cause of develop- 
 ment lies in the nucleus, which operates by setting up a continuous 
 series of specific metabolic changes in the cytoplasm. This process 
 begins during ovarian growth, establishing the external form of the 
 ^gg, its primary polarity, and the distribution of substances within it. 
 The cytoplasmic differentiations thus set up form as it were a frame-
