426 INHERITANCE AND DEVEIOPMENT 

is no doubt due in part to differentiation of the cytoplasm. There is, 
 however, reason to suspect that, beyond this, differentiation may sooner 
 or later involve a specification of the nuclear substance. When we 
 reflect on the general role of the nucleus in metabolism and its signifi- 
 cance as the especial seat of the formative power, we may well hesi- 
 tate to deny that this part of Roux's conception may be better founded 
 than his critics have admitted. Nageli insisted that the idioplasm 
 must undergo a progressive transformation during development, and 
 many subsequent writers, including such acute thinkers as Boveri and 
 Nussbaum, and many pathologists, have recognized the necessity for 
 such an assumption. Boveri's remarkable observations on the nuclei 
 of the primordial germ-cells in Ascaris demonstrate the truth of this 
 view in a particular case ; for here all of the somatic nuclei lose a portion 
 of their chromatin, and only the progenitors of tJie germ-necleiretai7i the 
 entire ancestral heritage. Boveri himself has in a measure pointed out 
 the significance of his discovery, insisting that the specific develop- 
 ment of the tissue-cells is conditioned by specific changes in the 
 chromatin that they receive,^ though he is careful not to commit him- 
 self to any definite theory. It hardly seems possible to doubt that in 
 Ascaris the limitation of the somatic cells in respect to the power of 
 development arises through a loss of particular portions of the 
 chromatin. One cannot avoid the thought that further and more 
 specific limitations in the various forms of somatic cells may arise 
 through an analogous process, and that we have here a key to the 
 origin of nuclear specification ivithoui recourse to the tJieory of qualita- 
 tive division. We do not need to assume that the unused chromatin 
 is cast out bodily ; for it m.ay degenerate and dissolve, or may be 
 transformed into linin-substance or into nucleoli. 

This suggestion is made only as a tentative hypothesis, but the 
 phenomena of mitosis seem well worthy of consideration from this 
 point of view. Its application to the facts of development becomes 
 clearer when we consider the nature of the nuclear "control" of the 
 cell, i.e. the action of the nucleus upon the cytoplasm. Strasburger, 
 following in a measure the lines laid down by Nageli, regards the 
 action as essentially dynamic, i.e. as a propagation of molecular 
 movements from nucleus to cytoplasm in a manner which might be 
 compared to the transmission of a nervous impulse. When, however, 
 we consider the role of the nucleus in synthetic metabolism, and the 
 relation between this process and that of morphological synthesis, 
 we must regard the question in another light ; and opinion has of 
 late strongly tended to the conclusion that nuclear "control" can 
 only be explained as the result of active exchanges of material 
 between nucleus and cytoplasm. De Vries, followed by Hertwig,
