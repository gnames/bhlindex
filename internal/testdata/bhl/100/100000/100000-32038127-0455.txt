THE NUCLEUS IN LATER DEVELOPMENT 427 

assumes a migration of pangens from nucleus to cytoplasm, the 
 character of the cell being determined by the nature of the migrat- 
 ing pangens, and these being, as it were, selected by circumstances 
 (position of the cell, etc.). But, as already pointed out, the pangen- 
 hypothesis should be held quite distinct from the purely physiologi- 
 cal aspect of the question, and may be temporarily set aside ; for 
 specific nuclear substances may pass from the nucleus into the 
 cytoplasm in an unorganized form. Sachs, followed by Loeb, has 
 advanced the hypothesis that the development of particular organs 
 is determined by specific "formative substances" which incite cor- 
 responding forms of metabohc activity, growth, and differentiation. 
 It is but a step from this to the very interesting suggestion of 
 Driesch that the nucleus is a storehouse of ferments which pass 
 out into the cytoplasm and there set up specific activities. Under 
 the influence of these ferments the cytoplasmic organization is deter- 
 mined at every step of the development, and new conditions are 
 established for the ensuing change. This view is put forward only 
 tentatively as a "fiction" or working hypothesis; but it is certainly 
 full of suggestion. Could we establish the fact that the number of 
 ferments or formative substances in the nucleus diminishes with the 
 progress of differentiation, we should have a comparatively simple 
 and intelligible explanation of the specification of nuclei and the 
 limitation of development. The power of regeneration might then 
 be conceived, somewhat as in the Roux-Weismann theory, as due to 
 a retention of idioplasm or germ-plasm — i.e. chromatin — in a less 
 highly modified condition, and the differences between the various 
 tissues in this regard, or between related organisms, would find a 
 natural explanation. 

Development may thus be conceived as a progressive transforma- 
 tion of the egg-substance primarily incited by the nucleus, first mani- 
 festing itself by specific changes in the cytoplasm, but sooner or later 
 involving in some measure the nuclear substance itself. This process, 
 which one is tempted to compare to a complicated and progressive 
 form of crystallization, begins with the youngest ovarian ^gg and pro- 
 ceeds continuously until the cycle of individual life has run its course. 
 Cell-division is an accompaniment but not a direct cause of differen- 
 tiation. The cell is no more than a particular area of the germinal 
 substance comprising a certain quantity of cytoplasm and a mass of 
 idioplasm in its nucleus. Its character is primarily a manifestation 
 of the general formative energy acting at a particular point under 
 given conditions. When once such a circumscribed area has been 
 established, it may, however, emancipate itself in a greater or less 
 degree from the remainder of the mass, and acquire a specific char- 
 acter so fixed as to be incapable of further change save within the 
 limits imposed by its acquired character.
