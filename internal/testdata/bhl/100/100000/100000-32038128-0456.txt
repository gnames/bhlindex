INHERITANCE AND DEVELOPMENT 

H. The External Conditions of Development 

We have thus far considered only the internal conditions of devel- 
 opment which are progressively created by the germ-cell itself. We 
 must now briefly glance at the external conditions afforded by the 
 environment of the embryo. That development is conditioned by 
 the external environment is obvious. But we have only recently 

come to realize how intimate the rela- 
 tion is ; and it has been especially the 
 service of Loeb, Herbst, and Driesch to 
 show how essential a part is played by 
 the environment in the development of 
 specific organic forms. The limits of 
 this work will not admit of any adequate 
 review of the vast array of known facts 
 in this field, for which the reader is re- 
 ferred to the works especially of Herbst. 
 I shall only consider one or two cases 
 which may serve to bring out the general 
 principle that they involve. Every liv- 
 ing organism at every stage of its exist- 
 ence reacts to its environment by physio- 
 logical and morphological changes. The 
 developing embryo, like the adult, is a 
 moving equilibrium — a product of the 
 response of the inherited organization to 
 the external stimuli working upon it. If 
 these stimuli be altered, development is 
 altered. This is beautifully shown by the 
 experiments of Herbst and others on the 
 development of sea-urchins. Pouchet 
 A. Normal Piuteus istrongyiocen- ^nd Chabry showcd that if the cmbryos 
 trotus). B. Larva {sphcsreckinus) at of thesc animals be made to develop in 
 the same stage as the foregoing, devei- gea-watcr Containing no limc-salts, the 

oped m sea-water contammg a slight . ° ' 

excess of potassium chloride. larva fails to develop not Only its calca- 

reous skeleton, but also its ciliated arms, 
 and a larva thus results that resembles in some particulars an entirely 
 different specific form ; namely, the Toimaria larva of Balajioglossiis. 
 This result is not due simply to the lack of necessary material ; for 
 Herbst showed that the same result is attained if a slight excess of 
 potassium chloride be added to sea-water containing the normal 
 amount of lime (Fig. 193). In the latter case the specific metabolism 
 of the protoplasm is altered by a particular chemical stimulus, and a 
 new form results.
