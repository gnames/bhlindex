THE EXTERNAL CONDITIONS OF DEVELOPMENT 429 

The changes thus caused by sHght chemical alterations in the 
 water may be still more profound. Herbst ('92) observed, for 
 example, that when the water contains a very small percentage of 
 lithium chloride, the blastula of sea-urchins fails to invaginate to 
 form a typical gastrula, but evaginates to form an hour-glass-shaped

 the ectoblast. Moreover, a much larger number of the blastu la-cells 
 undergo the differentiation into entoblast than in the normal de- 
 velopment, the ectoblast sometimes becoming greatly reduced and 
 occasionally disappearing altogether, so that the entire blastula is
