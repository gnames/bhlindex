DEVELOPMENT, INHERITANCE, AND METABOLISM 431 

Claude Bernard regard as but different phases of one process. The 
 building of a definite cell-product, such as a muscle-fibre, a nerve- 
 process, a cilium, a pigment-granule, a zymogen-granule, is in the last 
 analysis the result of a specific form of metabolic activity, as we may 
 conclude from the fact that such products have not only a definite 
 physical and morphological character, but also a definite chemical 
 character. In its physiological aspect, therefore, inheritance is the 
 recurrence, in successive generations, of like forms of metabolism ; 
 and this is effected through the transmission from generation to gen- 
 eration of a specific substance or idioplasm which we have seen 
 reason to identify with chromatin. The validity of this conception 
 is not affected by the form in which we conceive the morphological 
 nature of the idioplasm â€” whether as simply a mixture of chemical 
 substances, as a microcosm of invisible germs or pangens, as assumed 
 by De Vries, Weismann, and Hertwig, as a storehouse of specific fer- 
 ments as Driesch suggests, or as a complex molecular substance grouped 
 in micellae as in Nageli's hypothesis. It is true, as Verworn insists, 
 that the cytoplasm is essential to inheritance ; for without a specifi- 
 cally organized cytoplasm the nucleus is unable to set up specific 
 forms of synthesis. This objection, which has already been con- 
 sidered from different points of view, by both De Vries and Driesch, 
 disappears as soon as we regard the egg-cytoplasm as itself a prodicct 
 of the nuclear activity ; and it is just here that the general role of the 
 nucleus in metabolism is of such vital importance to the theory of 
 inheritance. If the nucleus be the formative centre of the cell, if 
 nutritive substances be elaborated by or under the influence of the 
 nucleus while they are built into the living fabric, then the specific 
 character of the cytoplasm is determined by that of the nucleus, 
 and the contradiction vanishes. In accepting this view we admit 
 that the cytoplasm of the ^g^ is, in a measure, the substratum of 
 inheritance, but it is so only by virtue of its relation to the nucleus, 
 which is, so to speak, the ultimate court of appeal. The nucleus 
 cannot operate without a cytoplasmic field in which its peculiar 
 powers may come into play ; but this field is created and moulded 
 by itself.

Development 

We have now arrived at the farthest outposts of cell-research, and 
 here we find ourselves confronted with the same unsolved problems 
 before which the investigators of evolution have made a halt. For 
 we must now inquire what is the guiding principle of embryological 
 development that correlates its complex phenomena and directs them
