PREFORMATION AND EPIGENESIS 433 

we but throw the problem one stage farther back, and, as Weismann 
 himself has pointed out,^ substitute for one difficulty another of 
 exactly the same kind. 

The truth is that an explanation of development is at present 
 beyond our reach. The controversy between preformation and 
 epigenesis has now arrived at a stage where it has little meaning 
 apart from the general problem of physical causality. What we 
 know is that a specific kind of living substance, derived from the 
 parent, tends to run through a specific cycle of changes during which 
 it transforms itself into a body like that of which it formed a part ; 
 and we are able to study with greater or less precision the mechanism 
 by which that transformation is effected and the conditions under 
 which it takes place. But despite all our theories we no more know 
 how the organization of the germ-cell involves the properties of the 
 adult body than we know how the properties of hydrogen and oxygen 
 involve those of water. So long as the chemist and physicist are 
 unable to solve so simple a problem of physical causality as this, 
 the embryologist may well be content to reserve his judgment on a 
 problem a hundred-fold more complex. 

The second question, regarding the historical origin of the idio- 
 plasm, brings us to the side of the evolutionists. The idioplasm of 
 every species has been derived, as we must believe, by the modifica- 
 tion of a preexisting idioplasm through variation, and the survival 
 of the fittest. Whether these variations first arise in the idioplasm 
 of the germ-cells, as Weismann maintains, or whether they may arise 
 in the body-cells and then be reflected back upon the idioplasm, is 
 a question to which the study of the cell has thus far given 
 no certain answer. Whatever position we take on this question, the 
 same difficulty is encountered ; namely, the origin of that coordi- 
 nated fitness, that power of active adjustment between internal and 
 external relations, which, as so many eminent biological thinkers 
 have insisted, overshadows every manifestation of life. The nature 
 and origin of this power is the fundamental problem of biology. 
 When, after removing the lens of the eye in the larval salamander, 
 we see it restored in perfect and typical form by regeneration from 
 the posterior layer of the iris,^ we behold an adaptive response to 
 changed conditions of which the organism can have had no antece- 
 dent experience either ontogenetic or phylogenetic, and one of so 
 marvellous a character that we are made to realize, as by a flash of 
 light, how far we still are from a solution of this problem. It may 
 be true, as Schwann himself urged, that the adaptive power of 
 living beings differs in degree only, not in kind, from that of unor-
