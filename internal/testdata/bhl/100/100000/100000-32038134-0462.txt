434 INHERITANCE AND DEVELOPMENT 

ganized bodies. It is true that we may trace in organic nature long 
 and finely graduated series leading upward from the lower to the 
 higher forms, and we must believe that the wonderful adaptive mani- 
 festations of the more complex forms have been derived from simpler 
 conditions through the progressive operation of natural causes. But 
 when all these admissions are made, and when the conserving 
 action of natural selection is in the fullest degree recognized, we can- 
 not close our eyes to two facts : first, that we are utterly ignorant of 
 the manner in which the idioplasm of the germ-cell can so respond 
 to the influence of the environment as to call forth an adaptive 
 variation ; and second, that the study of the cell has on the whole 
 seemed to widen rather than to narrow the enormous gap that sepa- 
 rates even the lowest forms of life from, the inorganic world. 

I am well aware that to many such a conclusion may appear reac- 
 tionary or even to involve a renunciation of what has been regarded 
 as the ultimate aim of biology. In reply to such a criticism I can 
 only express my conviction that the magnitude of the problem of 
 development, whether ontogenetic or phylogenetic, has been under- 
 estimated ; and that the progress of science is retarded rather than 
 advanced by a premature attack upon its ultimate problems. Yet 
 the splendid achievements of cell-research in the past twenty years 
 stand as the promise of its possibilities for the future, and we need 
 set no limit to its advance. To Schleiden and Schwann the present 
 standpoint of the cell-theory might well have seemed unattainable. 
 We cannot foretell its future triumphs, nor can we doubt that the 
 way has already been opened to better understanding of inheritance 
 and development.
