Achro'matin (see Chromatin), the non-staining substance of the nucleus, as 
 opposed to chromatin ; comprising the ground-substance and the linin-network. 
 (Flemming, 1879.) 

A'crosome ( aKpov, apex, o-w/xa, body), the apical bod}' situated at the anterior end

Alloplasma'tic (aAAos, different). Applied to active substances formed by differ- 
 entiation from the protoplasm proper, e.g. the substance of cilia, of nerve-fibrillae, 
 and of muscle-fibrillas. Alloplasmatic organs are opposed to •• protoplasmatic," 
 which arise only by division of preexisting bodies of the same kind. (A. ]\Ieyer, 
 1896.) 

Amito'sis (see Mitosis), direct or amitotic nuclear division ; mass-division of 
 the nuclear substance without the formation of chromosomes and amphiaster. 
 (Flemming, 1882.) 

Am'phiaster (d/xc^t, on both sides ; acTT-qp, a star), the achromatic figure formed 
 in mitotic cell-division, consisting of two asters connected bv a spindle. (Fol, 

1877.) 

Amphipy'renin (see Pyrenin), the substance of the nuclear membrane. 
 (SCHWARZ, 1887.) 

Amy'loplasts (a/xtiAov, starch ; TrAacrrds, TrAdo-o-etv. form), the colourless starch- 
 forming plastids of plant-cells. (Errera, 1882.) 

An'aphase (dvd, back or again), the later period of mitosis during the divergence 
 of the daughter-chromosomes. (Strasburger. 1884.) 

Aniso'tropy (see Isotropy), having a predetermined axis or axes (as applied to 
 the egg). (Pfluger, 1883.) 

Antherozo'id. the same as Spermatozoid. 

Anti'podal cone, the cone of astral rays opposite to the spindle-fibres. (Van 
 Beneden, 1883.) 

Archiam'phiaster {apx<- = fii'st, + amphiaster), the amphiaster by whicli the first 
 or second polar body is formed. (Whitman, 1878.) 

Ar'choplasma or Archoplasni (d/ox^v, a ruler) (sometimes written archiplasiii), 
 the substance from which the attraction-sphere, the astral rays, and the spindle- 
 fibres are developed, and of which they consist. (Boverl 1888.) 

Arrhe'noid {apprjv, male). The sperm-aster or attraction-sphere formed during the 
 fertilization of the ovum. (Henking. 1890.) 

As'ter (do-rr/p, a star), i. The star-shaped structure surrounding the centrosome. 
 (Fol, 1877.) [2. The star-shaped group of chromosomes during mitosis (see 
 Karyaster). (Flemming, 1892.)] 

[As'troccele] (dcrrr/p, a star; koiAos, hollow), a term somewhat vaguely applied to 
 the space in which the centrosome lies. (Fol, 1891.)
