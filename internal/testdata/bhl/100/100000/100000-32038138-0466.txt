438 GLOSSARY 

As'trosphere (see Centrosphere) . i. The central mass of the aster, exclusive 
 of the rays, in which the centrosome lies. Equivalent to the "attraction-sphere" 
 of Van Beneden. (FoL, i8gi ; Strasburger, 1892.) 2. The entire aster 
 exclusive of the centrosome. Equivalent to the " astral sphere " of Mark. 
 (BovERi, 1895.) 

Attraction-sphere (see Centrosphere), the central mass of the aster from which 
 the rays proceed. Also the mass of " archoplasm," derived from the aster, by 
 which the centrosome is surrounded in the resting cell. (Van Beneden, 1883.) 

[Au'toblast] (au'ros, self), applied by Altmann to bacteria and other minute organ- 
 isms, conceived as independent solitary "bioblasts." (1890.) 

Axial filament, the central filament, probably contractile, of the spermatozoon- 
 flagellum. (Eimer, 1874.) 

Basiohro'matin (see Chromatin), the same as chromatin in the usual sense. 
 That portion of the nuclear network stained by basic tar-colours. (Heidenhain, 
 1894.) 

Bi'oblast (^t'os, life ; /SAacrTos, a germ), a term applied by Altmann to the hypo- 
 thetical ultimate vital unit (equivalent to plasonie)^ and identified by him as 
 the "granulum." 

Bi'ogen (l3io<;, life ; -yevi^s, producing), equivalent to plasoine, etc. (Verw^oRN, 
 1895.) 

Bi'ophores (^los, life ; -<f)6po<;, bearing), the ultimate supra-molecular vital units. 
 Equivalent to the pangens of De Vries, the plasomes of Wiesner, etc. (Weismann, 

1893-) 
 Bi'oplasm (^tos, TrXas^ia). The active "living, forming germinal material," as 

opposed to " formed material." Nearly equivalent to protoplasm in the wider 

sense. (Beale, 1870.) 
 Bi'oplast, equivalent to cell. (Beale, 1870.) 
 Bi'valent, applied to chromatin-rods representing two chromosomes joined end to 

end. (Hacker, 1892.) 
 Ble'pharoplast (^Ae^apts, eye-lash or cilium). The centrosome-like bodies in 

plant-spermatids in connection with which the cilia of the spermatozoids are 

formed. (Webber, 1897.) 
 Cell-plate (see Mid-body), the equatorial thickening of the spindle-fibres from 

which the partition-wall arises during the division of plant-cells. (Strasbur- 
 ger, 1875.) 
 Cell-sap. the more liquid ground-substance of the nucleus. [Kolliker, 1865; 

more precisely defined by R. Hertwig, 1876.] 
 Central spindle, the primary spindle by which the centrosomes are connected, as 

opposed to the contractile mantle-fibres surrounding it. (Hermann, 1891.) 
 Cen'triole; a term applied by Boveri to a minute body or bodies (" Central-ko'rn ") 

within the centrosome. In some cases not to be distinguished from the centro- 
 some. (Boveri, 1895.) 
 Centrodes'mus (Kevrpov, centre; Ses/tos, a band), the primary connection between 

the centrosomes, formed by a substance from which arises the central spindle. 

(Heidenhain, 1894.) 
 Centrodeu'toplasm, the granular material of the testis-cells which may contribute 

to the formation of the Nebenkern or to that of the idiozome. (Erlanger, 

^^97-) 

Centrole'cithal (/cevrpov, centre ; Askings, yolk), that type of ovum in which the 
 deutoplasm is mainly accumulated in the centre. (Balfour, 1880.) 

Cen'troplasm (Kevrpov, centre; 7rAacrp,a), the protoplasm forming the attraction- 
 sphere or central region of the aster ; the substance of the centrosphere. (Er- 
 langer, 1895.)
