Cen'trosome (Kivrpov, centre ; o-w/xa, body), a body found at the centre of the aster 
 or attraction-sphere, regarded by some observers as the active centre of cell- 
 division and in this sense as the dynamic centre of the cell. Under its influence 
 arise the asters and spindle (amphiaster) of the mitotic figure. (Boveri, 
 1888.) 

Cen'trosphere, used in this work as equivalent to the " astrosphere " of Stras- 
 burger ; the central mass of the aster from which the rays proceed and within 
 which lies the centrosome. The attraction-sphere. [Strasburger, 1892; 
 applied by him to the " astrosphere " and centrosome taken together.] 

Chloroplas'tids (xAojpos, green; TrAacrro's, form), the green plastids or chlorophyll- 
 bodies of plant and animal cells. (Schimper, 1883.) 

Chro'matin (xpw/xa, colour), the deeply staining substance of the nuclear network 
 and of the chromosomes, consisting of nuclein. (Flemming, 1879.) 

Chro'niatophore {^xpoijj.a, colour; -cf>6po<;, bearing), a general term applied to the 
 coloured plastids of plant and animal cells, including chloroplastids and chromo- 

plastids. (SCHAARSCHMIDT, 1880; SCHMITZ. 1882.) 

Chro'matoplasm (xpw[ji.a, colour; TrAacr/Aa, anything formed or moulded), the sub- 
 stance of the chromoplastids and other plastids. (Strasburger, 1882.) 

Chro'miole, the smallest chromatin-granules which by their aggregation form the 
 larger chromomeres of which the chromosomes are composed. (Eisen, 1899.) 

Chro'momere (;(paJ/xa, colour; /^tepos, a part), one of the chromatin-granules of 
 which the chromosomes are made up. Identified by Weismann as the "id." 
 See Chromiole. (FoL, 1891.) 

Chromoplas'tids (j^p^jxa, colour; TrAacrros, form), the coloured plastids or pigment- 
 bodies other than the chloroplasts, in plant-cells. (Schimper, 1883.) 

Chro'moplasts, net-knots or chromatin-nucleoli ; also used b}' some authors as 
 equivalent to Chromoplastid. (Eisen, 1899.) 

Chro'ino.somes (^pw/xa, colour; croip-a, body), the deeply staining bodies into which 
 the chromatic nuclear network resolves itself during mitotic cell-division. (Wal- 
 DEYER, 1888.) 

Cleavage-nucleus, the nucleus of the fertilized egg, resulting from the union of 
 egg-nucleus and sperm-nucleus. (O. Hertwig, 1875.) 

Cortical zone, the outer zone of the centrosphere. (Van Beneden, 1887.) 

Cyano'philou.s (Kmvos, blue; (fnXeiv, to love), having an especial affinity for blue 
 or green dyes. (Auerbach.) 

Cy'taster (kvtos, hollow (a cell) ; acrTrjp, star), the same as Aster, i. See Kary- 
 aster. (Flemming, 1882.) 

[Cy'toblast] (kvto<;, hollow (a cell); /i^Aao-To's, germ). i. The cell-nucleus. 
 (ScHLEiDEN. 1838.) 2. One of the hypothetical ultimate vital units (bioblasts or 
 '"granula") of which the cell is built up. (Altmann, 1890.) 3. A naked cell 
 or "protoblast." (Kolliker.) 

[Cytoblaste'nia] (see Cytoblast), the formative material from which cells were 
 supposed to arise by ''free cell-formation." (Schleiden, 1838.) 

[Cytochyle'nia] (ktjtos, hollow (a cell) ; x^^o? juice), the ground-substance of the 
 cytoplasm as opposed to that of the nucleus. (Strasburger, 1882.) 

Cy'tode (kvtos, hollow (a cell) ; et8o9, form), a non-nucleated cell. (Hackel, 1866.) 

Cytodie'resis (kvto^, hollow (a cell) ; Siatpecns, division), the same as Mitosis. 
 (Henneguy, 188?.) 

Cytohy'aloplasma (.kvtos, hollow (a cell) ; iJaAos, glass ; TrAacr/Aa, anything formed), 
 the substance of the cytoreticulum in which are embedded the microsomes ; 
 opposed to nucleohyaloplasma. (Strasburger, 1882.) 

Cy'tolymph (kvtos. hollow (a cell) ; lynipJia, clear water), the cytoplasmic ground- 
 substance. (Hackel, 1891.)
