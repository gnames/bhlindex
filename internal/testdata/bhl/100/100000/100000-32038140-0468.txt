Cy'tosome (kvto?, hollow (a cell) ; awfxa, body), i. The cell-body or cytoplasmic 
 mass as opposed to the nucleus. (Hackel, 1891.) 2. A term used as parallel to 
 chromosome to denote deeply staining definitely organized cytoplasmic filaments 
 or other cytoplasmic structures composed of "cytochrorriatin." (Prenant, 1898.)

 cell-membrane in plants. (Wiesner, 1886.) 

Der'matosomes {Sepfxa, skin ; o-w/xa, body), the plasomes which form the cell-mem- 
 brane. (Wiesner, 1886.) 

Determinant, a hypothetical unit formed as an aggregation of biophores, determin- 
 ing the development of a single cell or independently variable group of cells. 
 (Weismann, 1 89 1.) 

[Deuthy'alosome] (SevT(epo<;), second ; see Hyalosome), the nucleus remaining 
 in the egg after formation of the first polar body. (Van Beneden, 1883.) 

Deu'toplasm (8eijr(epos), second; TrXdap-a, anything formed), yolk, lifeless food- 
 matters deposited in the cytoplasm of the egg; opposed to "protoplasm." (Van 
 Beneden, 1870.) 

Diakine'sis (8ta, through), the segmented-spireme-stage, following the synapsis, in 
 the primary oocyte or spermatocyte, during which the chromosomes persist for a 
 considerable period in the form of double rods. (Hacker, 1897.) 

Directive bodies, the polar bodies. (Fr. Muller, 1848.) 

Directive sphere, the attraction-sphere. (Guignard, 1891.) 

Dispermy, the entrance of two spermatozoa into the egg. 

Dispi'reme (see Spireme), that stage of mitosis in which each daughter-nucleus 
 has given rise to a spireme. (Flemming, 1882.) 

Dy'aster (Suas, two; see Aster, 2), the double group of chromosomes during the 
 anaphases of cell-division. (Flemming, 1882.) 

Ectosphere (cktos, outside), the outer or cortical zone of the attraction-sphere. 
 (Ziegler, 1899.) 

Egg-nucleus, the nucleus ot the egg after formation of the polar bodies and before 
 its union with the sperm-nucleus. Equivalent to the " female pronucleus " of Van 
 Beneden. (O. Hertwig, 1875.) 

Enchyle'ma (ev, in; x"^Â°^^ juice), i. The more fluid portion of protoplasm, 
 consisting of " hyaloplasma." (Hanstein, 1880.) 2. The ground-substance 
 (cytolymph) of cytoplasm as opposed to the reticulum. (Carnoy, 1883.) 

Endoplast, the cell-nucleus. (Huxley, 1853.) 

Ener'gid, the cell-nucleus together with the cytoplasm lying within its sphere of 
 influence. (Sachs, 1892.) 

Entosphere, (evros, inside), the inner or medullary zone of the attraction-sphere. 
 (Ziegler, 1899.) 

Equatorial plate, the group of chromosomes lying at the equator of the spindle 
 during mitosis. (Van Beneden, 1875.) 

Ergastic (e'pya^o/xat, to work). Applied to relatively passive substances " formed 
 anew through activity of the protoplasm." Equivalent to metaplasmic. C/. 
 alloplasmatic. (A. Meyer, 1896.)
