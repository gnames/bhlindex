GLOSSARY

Ergastoplasm (epya^o/xat, to work). Nearly equivalent to the " kinoplasm " of 

Strasburger and the " ergoplasm " of DavidoiF. The more active protoplasmic 

substance from which fibrillar formations arise. (Garnier, 1897.) 
 Ergoplasm (epyov, work). The active protoplasm of the egg (in tunicates), mainly 

derived from the achromatic part of the germinal vesicle, and giving rise in part 

or wholly to the polar spindle. Analogous to archoplasm and kinoplasm. 

(Davidoff, 1889.) 
 Erythro'philous (ipv9p6<;, red ; cjayclv, to love), having an especial affinity for red 

dyes. (AuERBACH.) 
 Ga'mete {yajxiry], wife; yafxiTr]<;, husband), one of two conjugating cells. Usually 

applied to the unicellular forms. 
 Gem'mule (see Pangen), one of the ultimate supra-molecular germs of the cell 

assumed by Darwin. (Darwin, 1868.) 
 [Ge'noblasts] (yevos, sex ; ySAao-ros, germ), a term applied by Minot to the mature 

germ-cells. The female genoblast (egg or " thelyblast ") unites with the male 

(spermatozoon or "arsenoblast") to form an hermaphrodite or indifferent cell. 

(Minot, 1877.) 
 Germinal spot, the nucleolus of the germinal vesicle. (Wagner, 1836.) 
 Germinal vesicle, the nucleus of the egg before formation of the polar bodies. 

(PuRKiNjE, 1825.) 
 Germ-plasm, the same as idioplasm. (Weismann.) 
 Heterokine'sis (erepos, different), qualitative nuclear division ; a hypothetical mode 

of mitosis assumed to separate chromatins of different quality ; opposed to 

homookinesis or equation-division. (Weismann, 1892.) 
 Heterole'oithal (erepos, different ; AeVt^os, yolk), having unequally distributed 

deutoplasm (includes telolecithal and centrolecithal). (Mark, 1892.) 
 Heterotyp'ical mitosis (erepos, different ; see Mitosis), that mode of mitotic 

division in which the daughter-chromosomes remain united by their ends to form 

rings. (Flemming, 1887.) 
 [Holoschi'sis] (oAos, whole ; axtC^i-v, to split), direct nuclear division. Amitosis. 

(Flemming, 1882.) 
 Homole'cithal (6p.ds, the same, uniform ; XtKidos, yolk), equivalent to alecithal. 

Having little deutoplasm, equally distributed, or none. (Mark. 1892.) 
 Homookine'sis or Homeeokine'sis (6p,os, the same), equation-division, separating 

equivalent chromatins; opposed to heterokinesis. (WeiSxMANn, 1S92.) 
 Homoeotyp'ical mitosis (op.otos, like ; see Mitosis), a form of mitosis occurring 

in the secondary spermatocytes of the salamander, differing from the usual type 

only in the shortness of the chromosomes and the irregular arrangement of 

the daughter-chromosomes. (Flemming. 1887.) 
 Hy'aloplasma (ilaAos, glass ; TrXdafia, anything formed), i. The ground-substance 

of the cell as distinguished from the granules or microsomes. [Hanstein. 1880.] 

2. The achromatic substance of the nucleus in which the chromatin-particles are 

embedded. (Strasburger, 1882.) 3. The ground-substance as distinguished 

from the reticulum or "â–  spongioplasm." (Leydig, 1885.) 4. The exoplasm or 

peripheral protoplasmic zone in plant-cells. (Pfeffer.) 
 Hy'alosomes (v'aAos, glass ; o-w/xa, body), nucleolar-like bodies but slightly stained 

by either nuclear or plasma stains. (Lukjanow% 1888.) 
 [Hy'groplasma] (vypds, wet; -rrXda-fxa, something formed), the more liquid part 

of protoplasm as opposed to the firmer stereoplasm. (Nageli, 1884.) 
 Id, the hypothetical structural unit resulting from the successive aggregation of 

biophores and determinants. Identified by Weismann as the chromomere, or 

chromatin-granule. (Weismann, 1891.) 
 Idant, the hypothetical unit resulting from the successive aggregation of biophores.
