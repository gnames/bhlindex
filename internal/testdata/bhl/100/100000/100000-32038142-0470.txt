determinants, and Ids. Identified by Weismann as the chromosome. (Weis- 
 MANN, 1 89 1.) 

Id'ioblasts (I'Stos, one's own ; /3AacrTos, germ), the hypothetical ultimate units of 
 the cell ; the same as biophores. (O. Hertwig, 1893.) 

Id'ioplasm (i'Stos, one's own ; TrXdafxa, a thing formed), equivalent to the germ- 
 plasm of Weismann. The substance, now generally identified with chromatin, 
 which by its inherent organization involves the characteristics of the species. 
 The physical basis of inheritance. (Nageli, 1884.) 

Id'iosome (tSios, one's own; crwyua, body), the same as idioblast or plasome. 
 (Whitman, 1893.) 

Idiozome (i'Stos, specially formed; ^w/xa, girdle). The sphere, often called attrac- 
 tion-sphere and usually enclosing the centrosomes, found in the spermatids of 
 animals. (Meves, 1897.) 

Interfilar substance, the ground-substance of protoplasm as opposed to the thread- 
 work. (Flemming, 1882.) 

Interzonal fibres (" Filaments reunissants " of Van Beneden. " Verbindungs- 
 fasern" of Flemming -and others). Those spindle-fibres that stretch between 
 the two groups of daughter-chromosomes during the anaphase. Equivalent 
 in some cases to the central spindle. (Mark, 1881.) 

Iso'tropy (to-os, equal ; Tpoirrj, a turning), the absence of predetermined axes (as 
 applied to the egg). (Pfluger, 1883.) 

[Ka'ry aster] (Kapvov, nut, nucleus ; see Aster, 2), the star-shaped group of chromo- 
 somes in mitosis. Opposed to cytaster. (Flemming, 1882.) 

Karyenchy'ma (Kapvov, nut, nucleus ; iv, in ; x^/^os, juice), the " nuclear sap." 
 (Flemming, 1882.) 

Karyokine'sis (Kapvov, nut, nucleus; KtvTjcrts, change, movement), the same as 
 mitosis. (Schleicher, 1878.) 

[Karyoly'ma], the "karyolytic" (mitotic) figure. (Auerbach, 1876.) 

Ka'ryolymph. The nuclear sap. (Hackel, 1891.) 

[Karyo'lysis] (Kapvov, nut. nucleus; XvaLs, dissolution), the supposed dissolution 
 of the nucleus during cell-division. (Auerbach, 1874.) 

[Karyoly'tic figure] (see Karyolysis), a term applied by Auerbach to the mitotic 
 figure in living cells. Believed by him to result from the dissolution of the 
 nucleus. (Auerbach, 1874.) 

Karyonii'crosonie (see Microsome), the same as nucleo-microsome. 

Karyomi'tome (Kapvov, nut, nucleus; /xtrco/^ia, from /xtro?, a thread), the nuclear as 
 opposed to the cytoplasmic thread-work. (Flemming, 1882.) 

Karyomito'sis (Kapvov, nut, nucleus ; see Mitosis), mitosis. (Flemming, 
 1882.) 

Ka'ryon (Kapvov, nut, nucleus), the cell-nucleus. (Hackel, 1891.) 

Ka'ryoplasm (Kapvov, nut. nucleus; TrXdafxa, a thing formed), nucleoplasm. The 
 nuclear as opposed to the cytoplasmic substance. (Flemming, 1882.) 

Ka'ry osome (Kapvov, nut, nucleus; aSyfia, body), i. Nucleoli of the ''net-knot" 
 type, staining with nuclear dyes, as opposed to plasmosomes or true nucleoli. 
 (Ogata, 1883.) 2. The same as chromosome. (Platner, 1886.) 3. Caryo- 
 some. The cell-nucleus. (Watase, 1894.) 

[Karyo'ta] (Kapvov, nut, nucleus), nucleated cells. (Flemming, 1882.) 

Karyothe'ca (Kapvov, nut, nucleus ; 67]Kr), case, box), the nuclear membrane. 
 (Hackel, 1891.) 

Ki'noplasm (Ktveiv, to move; irXdap.a, a thing formed), nearly equivalent to 
 archoplasm, but used in a broader sense to denote in general the more 
 active elements of protoplasm from which arise fibrills, the substance of cilia, 
 and (in plants) the peripheral â€¢' Hautschicht " from which the membrane is
