 1892.) 

[Lanthanin] {XavOdvuv, to conceal), equivalent to oxychromatin. (Heidenhain, 
 1892.) 

Leucoplas'tids (AeiiKo?, white ; TrAacrros, form), the colourless plastids of plant- 
 cells from v/hich arise the starch-formers (amyloplastids), chloroplastids, and 
 chromoplastids. (Schimper, 1883.) 

Li'nin (linum, a linen thread), the substance of the "achromatic" nuclear reticu- 
 lum. (ScHWARZ, 1887.) 

Lininoplast, the true nucleolus or plasmosome. (Eisen, 1899.) 

Macrocentrosome, a term applied to the " centrosome " in Boveri's sense, i.e. to 
 the larger body in which lies the central granule. (Ziegler, 1898.) Probably 
 synonymous with entosphere. 

Maturation, the final stages in the development of the germ-cells. More spe- 
 cifically, the process by which the reduction of the number of chromosomes 
 is effected. 

Metakine'sis (see Metaphase) (/xeTa, beyond (z.e. further) ; KLwrja-i?. movement), 
 the middle stage of mitosis, when the chromosomes are grouped in the equatorial 
 plate. (Flemming, 1882.) 

Metanu'cleus, a term applied to the nucleolus after its extrusion from the germi- 
 nal vesicle. (Hacker, 1892.) 

Met'aphase, the middle stage of mitosis during which occurs the splitting of the 
 chromosomes in the equatorial plate. (Strasburger, 1884.) 

Met'aplasm (/xera, after, beyond ; TrXdajxa, a thing formed), a term collectively 
 applied to the lifeless inclusions (deutoplasm, starch, etc.) in protoplasm as op- 
 posed to the living substance. (Hanstein, 1868.) 

Micella, one of the ultimate supra-molecular units of the cell. (Nageli, 1884.) 

Microcentrosome, equivalent to the central granule or centriole of Boveri. 
 (Ziegler, 1898.) 

Microcen'trum, the centrosome or group of centrosomes united by a 'â€¢ primary 
 centrodesmus," forming the centre of the astral system. (Heidenhain, 1894.) 

Mi'cropyle (/xiKpo's, small; irvXr}, orifice), the aperture in the egg-membrane 
 through which the spermatozoon enters. [First applied by Turpin, in 1S06, 
 to the opening through which the pollen-tube enters the o\aile. /. Robert 
 Brown.] 

Mi'dcsome (/i.tKpos, small ; crto/xa, body), the granules as opposed to the ground- 
 substance of protoplasm. (Hanstein, 1880.) 

Microsphere, the central region of the aster (centrosphere) at tlie centre of which 
 lie the centrosomes. (Kostanecki and Siedlecki, 1896.) 

Middle-piece, that portion of the spermatozoon lying behind the nucleus at the 
 base of the flagellum. (Schweigger-Seidel, 1865.) 

Mid-body ("Zwischenkorper "), a body or group of granules, probably comparable 
 with the cell-plate in plants, formed in the equatorial region of the spindle during 
 the anaphases of mitosis. (Flemming, 1890.) 

Mi'tome (/xLTuifxa, from ixlto'?, a thread), the reticulum or thread-work as opposed to 
 the ground-substance of protoplasm. (Flemming, 1882.) 

[Mitoschi'.sis (|U.tTos, thread ; cr;(t^eti/, to split), indirect nuclear division; mitosis. 
 (Flemming, 1882.) 

Mito'sis (fjLLTos, a thread), indirect nuclear division typically involving: a. the 
 formation of an amphiaster; /^ conversion of the chromatin into a thread 
 (spireme) ; c, segmentation of the thread into chromosomes ; c/, splitting of the 
 chromosomes. (Flemming, 1882.) 

Mi'tosome {[xlto's, a thread ; au)fxa, body), a body derived from the spindle-fibres
