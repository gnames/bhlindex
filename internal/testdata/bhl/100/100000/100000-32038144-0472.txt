444 GLOSSARY 

of the secondary spermatocytes, giving rise, according to Platner, to the mid- 
 dle-piece and the tail-envelope of the spermatozoon. Equivalent to the Neben- 
 kern of La Valette St. George. (Platner, 1889.) 

Nebenkern (Paranucleus), a name originally appUed by Butschh (1871) to an 
 extranuclear body in the spermatid ; afterwards shown by La Valette St. George 
 and Platner to arise from the spindle-fibres of the secondary spermatocyte. 
 Since applied to many forms of cytoplasmic bodies (yolk-nucleus, etc.) of the 
 most diverse nature. 

Nuclear plate, i. The equatorial plate. (Strasburger, 1875.) 2. The parti- 
 tion-wall which sometimes divides the nucleus in amitosis. 

Nuclein, the chemical basis of chromatin ; a compound of nucleinic acid and albumin 
 or albumin radicles. (Miescher, 1871.) 

Nucleinic or nucleic acid, a complex organic acid, rich in phosphorus, and an 
 essential constituent of chromatin. 

Nucleo-albumin, a nuclein having a relatively high percentage of albumin. Dis- 
 tinguished from nucleo-proteids by containing paranucleinic acid which yields no 
 xanthin-bodies. 

[Nucleochyle'ma] (;i(TjA.ds, juice), the ground-substance of the nucleus as opposed 
 to that of the cytoplasm. (Strasburger, 1882.) 

Nucleohy'aloplasnia (see Hyaloplasm), the achromatic substance (linin) in which 
 the chromatin-granules are suspended. (Strasburger, 1882.) 

Nucleomi'crosomes (see Microsome), the nuclear (chromatin) granules as 
 opposed to those of the cytoplasm. (Strasburger, 1882.) 

Nu'cleoplasm. i. The reticular substance of the (egg-) nucleus. (Van Bene- 
 DEN, 1875.) 2- 'I'l^^ substance of the nucleus as opposed to that of the cell- 
 body or cytoplasm. (Strasburger, 1882.) 

Nucleo-pro'teid, a nuclein having a relatively high percentage of albumin. May 
 be split into albumin and true nucleinic acid, the latter yielding xanthin-bodies. 

CEde'matin (olhrjixa, a swelling), the granules or microsomes of the nuclear ground- 
 substance. (Reinke, 1893.) 

O'ocyte (Ovocyte) (woV, egg; kiJtos, hollow (a cell)), the ultimate ovarian egg 
 before formation of the polar bodies. The primary oocyte divides to form the 
 first polar body and the secondary oocyte. The latter divides to form the second 
 polar body and the mature egg. (Boveri, 1891.) 

Oogen'esis, Ovogenesis (woV, egg ; -yeVecrts, origin), the genesis of the egg after its 
 origin by division from the mother-cell. Often used more specifically to denote 
 the process of reduction in the female. 

Oogo'nium, Ovogonium (wov, egg ; yovjy, generation), i. The primordial mother- 
 cell from which arises the egg and its follicle. (Pfluger.) 2. The descend- 
 ants of the primordial germ-cell which ultimately give rise to the oocytes or 
 ovarian eggs. (Boveri, 1891.) 

Obkine'sis (woV, egg; KtvT^crts, movement), the mitotic phenomena of the egg dur- 
 ing maturation and fertiHzation. (Whitman, 1887.) 

O'vocentre, the egg-centrosome during fertilization. (FoL, 1891.) 

Oxychro'matin (ofi;?, acid ; see Chromatin), that portion of the nuclear substance 
 stained by acid tar-colours. Equivalent to "linin" in the usual sense. 
 (Heidenhain, 1894.) 

Pangen'esis (ttSs (Trav-), all; yeVecrts, production), the theory of gemmules, accord- 
 ing to which hereditary traits are carried by invisible germs thrown off by the 
 individual cells of the body. (Darwin, 1868.) 

Pangens (ttSs (-n-av-), all; -yevi^s, producing), the hypothetical ultimate supra-molec- 
 ular units of the idioplasm, and of the cell generally. Equivalent to gemmules, 
 micellae, idioblasts, biophores, etc. (De Vries, 1889.)
