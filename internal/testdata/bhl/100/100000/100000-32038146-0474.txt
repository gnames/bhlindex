446 GLOSSARY 

Pronuclei, the germ-nuclei during fertilization ; i.e. the egg-nucleus (female pro- 
 nucleus) after formation of the polar bodies, and the sperm-nucleus (male pro- 
 nucleus) after entrance of the spermatozoon into the egg. (Van Beneden, 
 1875.) 

[Prothy'alosome] (see Hyalosome), an area in the germinal vesicle (of Ascan's') 
 by which the germinal spot is surrounded, and which is concerned in formation 
 of the first polar body. (Van Beneden, 1883.) 

Pro'toblast (ttjowtos, first; ySAaoros, a germ), i. A naked cell, devoid of a mem- 
 brane. (KoLLiKER.) 2. A blastomere of the segmenting egg which is the 
 parent-cell of a definite part or organ. (Wilson, 1892.) 

Pro'toplasm (Trpwros, first; TrXaa-jxa, a thing formed or moulded). The active 
 or "living" cell-substance. By all earlier and some present writers applied only 
 to the substance of the cell-body (equivalent to Strasburger's cytoplasm). By 
 many later writers applied to the entire active substance of the cell (karyoplasm 
 plus cytoplasm). (Purkinje, 1840; H. von Mohl, 1846.) 

Pro'toplast (Trpwros, first ; TrAao-ros, formed) . i . The protoplasmic body of the 
 cell, including nucleus and cytoplasm, regarded as a unit. Nearly equivalent to 
 the energid of Sachs. (Hansteinj 1880.) 2. Used by some authors synony- 
 mously with plastid. 

[Pseudochro'matin] (see Chromatin), the same as prochromatin. (Pfitzner, 
 1886.) 

Pseudonu'clein (see Nuclein), the same as the paranuclein of Kossel. (Ham- 

MARSTEN, 1894.) 

Pseudo-reduction, the preliminary halving of the number of chromatin-rods as a 

prelude to the formation of the tetrads and to the actual reduction in the number 

of chromosomes in maturation. (RUckert, 1894.) 
 Pyre'nin {irvpriv., the stone of a fruit ; i.e. relating to the nucleus), the substance of 

true nucleoli. Equivalent to the paranuclein of Hertwig. (Schwarz, 1887.) 
 Pyre'noid (jrvp-qv, the stone of a fruit; like a nucleus), colourless plastids (leuco- 

plastids), occurring in the chromatophores of lower plants, forming centres for 

the formation of starch. (Schmitz, 1883.) 
 Reduction, the halving of the number of chromosomes in the germ-nuclei during 

maturation. 
 Sarcode (arapi, flesh). The protoplasm of unicellular animals. (Du Jardin, 

1835-) 

Sertoli-cells, the large, digitate, supporting, and nutritive cells of the mammalian 
 testis to which the developing spermatozoa are attached. (Equivalent to "sper- 
 matoblast" as originally used by Von Ebner, 1871.) 

Sper'matid (crTrep/xa, seed), the final cells which are converted without fiirther 
 division into spermatozoa ; they arise by division of the secondary spermatocytes 
 or" Samenmutterzellen." (La Valete St. George, 1886.) 

Sper'matoblasts (airep/xa, seed ; fSXaaro's, germ), a word of vague meaning, 
 originally applied to the supporting cell or Sertoli-cell, from which a group of 
 spermatozoa was supposed to arise. By various later writers used synonymously 
 with spermatid. (Von Ebner, 1871.) 

Sper'matocyst {cnripp.a, seed ; Kijcrrts, bladder), originally applied to a group of 
 sperm-producing cells ("spermatocytes"), arising by division from an "Ursa- 
 menzelle" or "spermatogonium." (La Valette St. George, 1876.) 

Sper'matocyte ((nrepixa, seed; kvtos, hollow (a cell)), the cells arising from the 
 spermatogonia. The primajy spermatocyte arises by growth of one of the last 
 generation of sperm^atogonia. By its division are formed two secondaty sper- 
 matocytes, each of which gives rise to two spermatids (ultimately spermatozoa). 
 (La Valette St. George, 1876.)
