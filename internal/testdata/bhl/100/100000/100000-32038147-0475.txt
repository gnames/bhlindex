GLOSSARY 447 

[Sperm atogem'ma] (cnripixa, seed; gemma, bud), nearly equivalent to spermato- 

cyst. Differs in the absence of a surrounding membrane. [In mammals, La 

Valette St. GfiORGE, 1878.] 
 Spermatogen'esis {a-rrepfui, seed : yeVecris, origin), the phenomena involved in 

the formation of the spermatozoon. Often used more specifically to denote the 

process of reduction in the male. 
 Spermatogo'nium ('• Ursamenzelle ") (crTrep/xa, seed; yovT^, generation), the 

descendants of the primordial germ-cells in the male. Each ultimate sper- 
 matogonium typically gives rise to four spermatozoa. (La Valette St. 

George, 1876.) 
 Spermatome'rites (cnrep/jia, seed; iJiipo<;, a part), the chromatin-granules into 

which the sperm-nucleus resolves itself after entrance of the spermatozoon. (In 

Petromyzon, Bohm, 1887.) 
 Sper'matosome (cnrepfjia, seed ; aC)jxa, body), the same as spermatozoon. (La 

Valette St. George, 1878.) 
 Spermatozo'id (see Spermatozoon), the ciliated paternal germ-cells in plants. 

The word was first used by von Siebold as synonymous with spermatozoon. 
 Spermatozo'on (airepixa, seed; ^wov, animal), the paternal germ-cell of animals. 

(Leeuwenhoek, 1677.) 
 Sperm-nucleus, the nucleus of the spermatozoon ; more especially applied to it after 

entrance into the egg before its union with the egg-nucleus. In this sense 

equivalent to the '• male pronucleus " of Van Beneden. (O. Hertwig, 

1875.) 
 Sper'mocentre, the sperm-centrosome during fertilization. (FoL, 1891.) 
 Spi'reme {airtLprfixxL, a thing wound or coiled; a skein), the skein or "Knauel" 

stage of the nucleus in mitosis, during which the chromatin appears in the form 

of a thread, continuous or segmented. (Flemming, 1882.) 
 Spon'gioplasm (crTroyytov, a sponge ; TrAacr/xa, a thing formed), the cytoreticulum. 

(Leydig, 1885.) 
 Ste'reoplasm (orepeds, solid), the more solid part of protoplasm as opposed to the 

more fluid " hygroplasm." (Nageli, 1884.) 
 Substantia hyalina, the protoplasmic ground-substance or "hyaloplasm." 

(Leydig, 1885.) 
 Substantia opaca, the protoplasmic reticulum or '• spongioplasm.'' (Leydig, 

1885.) 
 Synap'sis (crrvaTrra), to fuse together). A stage in the nucleus preceding the first 

maturation-division, characterized by the massing of the chromatin at one side 

of the nucleus. From it the chromatin-masses emerge in the reduced number. 

(Moore, 1895.) 
 Te'loblast (reXos, end ; /SXacrrd?, a germ), large cells situated at the growing end 

of the embryo (in annelids, etc.), which bud forth rows of smaller cells. (Whit- 
 man, Wilson, 1887.) 
 Telole'cithal (reAos, end ; AeVt^os, yolk), that type of ovum in which the yolk is 

mainly accumulated in one hemisphere. (Balfour, 1880.) 
 Te'lophases, Telokine'sis (tc'Aos, end), the closing phases of mitosis, during 

which the daughter-nuclei are re-formed. (Heidenhain, 1894.) 
 To'noplasts (rdvos, tension ; TrAacrTos, form), plastids from which arise the vacuoles 

in plant-cells. (De Vries, 1885.) 
 Trophoplasm (Tpocf)rj, nourishment; TrAao-jtia). i. The nutritive or vegetative 

substance of the cell, as distinguished from the idioplasm. (Nageli, 1884.) 

2. The active substance of the cytoplasm other than the "kinoplasm ■' or archo- 

plasm. (Strasburger, 1892.) 
 Tro'phoplasts {Tpo4>ij, nourishment; TrAao-ro's, form), a general term, nearly equiv-
