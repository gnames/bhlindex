This series is founded upon a course of popular Uniyersity 
 lectures given during the winter of 1892-3, in connection with 
 the opening of the new department of Biology in Columbia 
 Colleo'e. The lectures are in a measure consecutive in charac- 
 ter, illustrating phases in the discovery and application of the 
 theory of Evolution. Thus the first course outlined the de- 
 velopment of the Descent theory; the second, the application 
 of this theory to the problem of the ancestry of the Vertebrates, 
 largely based upon embryological data; the third, the applica- 
 tion of the Descent theory to the interpretation of the structure 
 and phylogeny of the Fishes or lowest Vertebrates, chiefly based 
 upon comparative anatomy ; the fourth, upon the problems of 
 individual development and Inheritance, chiefly based upon the 
 structure and functions of the cell. 

Since their original delivery the lectures have been carefully 
 rewritten and. illustrated so as to adapt them to the use of Col- 
 lege and University students and of general readers. The vol- 
 umes as at present arranged for include:
