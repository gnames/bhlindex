This opening volume, " From the Greeks to Darwin/' is an 
 outline of the develo|)ment from the earliest times of the idea of 
 the origin of life by evolution. It brings together in a continu- 
 ous treatment the progress of this idea fi'om the Greek philoso- 
 pher Thales (640 B.C.) to Darwin and Wallace. It is based 
 partly upon critical studies of the original authorities, partly 
 upon the studies of Zeller, Perrier, Quatrefages, Martin, and 
 other writers less known to English readers. 

This history differs from the outlines which have been pre- 
 viously published, in attempting to establish a complete conti- 
 nuity of thought in the growth of the various elements in the 
 Evolution idea, and especially in the more critical and exact 
 study of the pre-Darwinian writers, such as Buffon, Goethe, 
 Erasmus Darwin, Treviranus, Lamarck, and St. Hilaire, about 
 whose actual share in the establishment of the Evolution theory 
 vague ideas are still current.
