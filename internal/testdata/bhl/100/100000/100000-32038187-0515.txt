The purpose of this vohime is to consider the problem of the 
 ancestry of the Vertebrates from the standpoint of the anat- 
 omy and development of Amphioxns and other members of the 
 group Protochordata. The Avork opens with an Introduction, 
 in which is given a brief historical sketch of the speculations 
 of the celebrated anatomists and embryologists, from Etienne 
 Geoft'roy St. Hilaire down to our own day, upon this problem. 
 The remainder of the first and the whole of the second chapter 
 is devoted to a detailed account of the anatomy of Amphioxus 
 as compared with that of higher A'ertebrates. The third chapter 
 deals with the embryonic and larval development of Amphioxus, 
 while the fourth deals more briefly with the anatomy, embryology, 
 and relationships of the Ascidians; then the other allied forms, 
 Balanoglossus, Cephalodiscus, are described. 

The work concludes with a series of discussions touch- 
 ing the problem proposed in the Introduction, in which it is 
 attempted to define certain general principles of Evolution by 
 which the descent of the Vertebrates from Invertebrate ancestors 
 may be supposed to have taken place. 

The work contains an extensive bibliography, full notes, and 
 135 illustrations.
