This work has been prepared to meet the needs of the gen- 
 eral student for a concise knowledge of the Fishes. It contains 
 a review of the four larger groups of the strictly fishlike forms, 
 Sharks, Chimaeroids, Teleostomes, and the Dipnoans, and adds 
 to this a chapter on the Lampreys. It presents in figures the 
 prominent members, living and fossil, of each group; illustrates 
 characteristic structures; adds notes upon the important phases 
 of development, and formulates the views of investigators as to 
 relationships and descent. 

The recent contributions to the knowledge of extinct Fishes 
 are taken into special account in the treatment of the entire 
 subject, and restorations have been attempted, as of Dinichthys, 
 Ctenodus, and Cladoselache. 

The writer has also indicated diagrammatically, as far as 
 generally accepted, the genetic relationships of fossil and living 
 forms. 

The aim of the book has been mainly to furnish the student 
 with a well-marked ground-plan of Ichthyology, to enable him to 
 better understand special works, such as those of Smith Wood- 
 ward and Giinther. The work is fully illustrated, mainly from 
 the writer's original pen-drawings.
