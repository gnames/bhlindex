EXTRACT FROM PREFACE. 

"I shall try to show that life is response to the order of nature; in fact, this 
 thesis is the text of most of the lectures : but if it be admitted, it follows that 
 biology is the study of response, and that the study of that order of nature to 
 which response is made is as well within its province as the study of the living or- 
 ganism which responds, for all the knowledge we can get of both these aspects of 
 nature is needed as a preparation for the study of that relation between them which 
 constitutes life. Our interest in all branches of science is vital interest. It is only 
 as living things that we care to know. Life is that which, when joined to mind, is 
 knowledge, â€” knowledge in use ; and we may be sure that all living things with 
 minds like ours are conscious of some part of the order of nature, for the response 
 in which life consists is response to this order. The statement that physical 
 phenomena are natural seems to mean little, but the phenomena of life are so 
 wonderful that many hesitate, even at the present day, to believe that nature can be 
 such a wonderful thing as it must be if the actions of ail living things are natural ; 
 and, as I shall try to find out in this course of lectures what we mean by the asser- 
 tion that living nature is natural, I shall now attempt, by a few illustrations, to give 
 a broad outline of some of the most notable features of the nature of living things."
