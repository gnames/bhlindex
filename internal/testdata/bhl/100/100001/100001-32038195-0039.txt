SPUHR.] SNAKE RANGE. 31 

Mr. Weeks states that about 20 to 25 miles south of Wheeler Peak, 
 in the bold escarpment 1,500 to 2,000 feet in height which faces Spring 
 Valley, the Ordovician limestones abut against the Cambrian with a 
 very high angle of dip. In this series the following fossils, deter- 
 mined by Professor Ulrich, have been collected: 

First lot. 

OrtMs (near tricenaria) . 

Or this (? type of plicatella). 

Orthis (cf. bellarugosa) . 

Orthis n. sp. (near O. holstoni Safford). 

Dalmanella (type of testudinaria). 

Dalmanella (type of perveta) . 

Dalmanella. 

Hormotoma (near gracilis). 

Leperditia bivia White. 

Leperditella sp. 

Leperditella ? sp. 

Sehmidtella n. sp. (near crassiniarginata). 

Bathynrus (? Dikellocephalus) . Occurs elsewhere. 

Bathynrus. 

Aniijhion. 

Asaphtis. 

Asaphtis. 

Asaphus ? curiosus (Billings) Walcott. 

Second lot. 

Fragments of large cystidean or Carabocrinns. 

Orthis tricenaria-costalis. 

Orthis pogonipensis ? 

Orthis n. sp. (near O. holstoni Safford). 

Eccyliopterusâ€” fragment. 

Endoceras of new type. 

Leperditia bivia White. 

Leperditia n. sp. (near bivia and fabnlites). 

Leperditia n. sp. (semipunctate). 

Sehmidtella n. sp. 

lUaenus sp. (?Thaleops). 

Amphion nevadensis Walcott. 

Bathyurns ? n. sp. (Occurs at many localities.) 

These fossils are types that were found by Mr. Walcott in the 
 Lower PogoniiD (Ordovician) at Eureka, and it is not probable that 
 an erosion interval of much importance occurs at this horizon. 

The Carboniferous strata lie unconformably upon the Ordovician 
 in nearly horizontal position, and form the remaining portion of the 
 Snake Range. Between the Ordovician and the Carboniferous there 
 is a great interval of nondeposition, since the Eureka quartzite, the 
 Lone Mountain limestone of the Silurian, and the whole of the 
 Devonian as exposed at Eureka, are wanting in this section.
