32 GEOLOGY OF T^TEVADA SOUTH OF lOTH PARALLEL, [bull. 208. 

CARBONIFEROUS. 

Mr. F. B. Weeks" reports that near the southern end of the Snake 
 Range the Lower Silurian (Pogonip) i-ocks are directly overlain hy 
 Carboniferous limestones. There is here a gap in the Paleozoic sec- 
 tion. The upper formations of the Silurian as exposed at Eureka 
 (the Eureka quartzite and the Lone Mountain limestone) are wanting, 
 as well as the whole Devonian section (8,000 feet thick at Eureka). 
 In a low pass near the southern end of the Snake Range Carbonifer- 
 ous fossils were found, which were determined by Dr. Girty as con- 
 taining species of ZaphrenUs, Syringopora, and Reticularia. 

In the section across the range eastward from Osceola, and just 
 north of Wheeler Peak, the Cambrian rocks are succeeded to the 
 east by a conglomerate made up chiefly of the peculiar metamorphic 
 Cambrian limestones, and also containing pebbles of the quartzite 
 and calcite veins which these limestones hold. Between this locality 
 and the next outcrop to the west (which consists of Cambrian quartz- 
 ite and limestones), there is a gap of a few miles, covered by a drift 
 in which no rock outcrops were observed. Succeeding this on the 
 east is dark-gray, somewhat fetid, calcite-veined limestone, which is 
 very f ossiliferous. This locality yielded the following tipper Carbon- 
 iferous fossils, which were determined by Dr. George H. Girty: 

. Fisttilipora ? sp. 
 Producttis n. sp. 
 Prodiictus sp. 
 Marginifera splendens. 
 Spirifer boonensis. 
 Ambocoelia planiconvexa. 
 Seminula subtilita. 

This is lithologically the same rock as the Upper Carboniferous on 
 the west side of the Schell Creek Range, where it also abuts against 
 the Cambrian. 

This f ossiliferous bed is succeeded farther east by similar limestcmes 
 and by beds of ferriferous quartzite. After about three-quarters of a 
 mile there comes in about 400 feet of hard white quartzite, which is 
 supposed to be Silurian.^ The diij'of this flattens so that it forms the 
 outcrops and tlie tops of the hills for a half mile east. Then comes 
 in, farther east, conglomerate made up of limestone fragments in a 
 reddish, finely triturated matrix. The fragments yielded the follow- 
 ing Upper Carboniferous fossils, which were identified by Dr. George 
 H. Girty: 

Productus prattenianiis. 
 Productus ijortlockianiis'? 
 Marginifera splendens. 
 Spirifer camerattis. 
 Seminula mira?
