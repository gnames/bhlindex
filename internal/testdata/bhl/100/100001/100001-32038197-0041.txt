SPURR] SNAKE EANGE. 33 

Proceeding northward from this point along the eastern face of the 
 mountains, there was found, about 4 miles north of Robinson's ranch, 
 a compact red conglomerate, made up mostly of white quartzite and 
 crystalline limestone full of calcite veins. The limestone fragments 
 yielded the following Ordovician (Lower Silurian) fossils, which were 
 identified by Dr. George II. Girtj^: Fragments of Ortliis sp. and 
 Leperditia hi via. 

From another fragment the following Upper Carboniferous fossils 
 rere obtained: Rhomhopora? sp. and lamellibranch fragments. 

The angular shape of these fragments proves a shore formation. 
 TT^o hundred yards north the conglomerate passes laterally and 
 rapidlj^ into the solid rocks from which it is derived — black, dark- 
 blue, iind gray limestones, thoroughly seamed and crushed, and white 
 quartzite, having nearlj^ the same attitude as the conglomerates. The 
 solid limestone carries fossils like those in the conglomerate. Follow- 
 ing the section northward, one passes through 2,500 or 3,000 feet of 
 limestone to a belt of black shale in which Cambrian fossils were 
 found, as determined by Mr. C. D. Walcott. 

From here northward as- far as Pleasant Vallej^ no Carboniferous 
 fossils were found. On the north side of Pleasant Valley the meta- 
 morphic limestones, which have been referred to the Cambrian, are 
 succeeded to the west, near the gap where the road to Deep Creek 
 runs, by comparatively unaltered although calcite- veined limestones, 
 which carry the following Upper Carboniferous fossils, as determined 
 b}^ Dr. George H. Girty: 

Romingeria? sp. 
 Fenestella sp. 
 Prodtictns pratteniantis. 
 Semintila mira? 
 Piignax rocky montanus. 
 Dielasma? sp. ~ 

Edmondia? sp. 
 Pleurotomaria sp. 
 Bellerophon crassus? 

Farther north, at Uiyabi Pass, near the northern end of the range, 
 Mr. Howell found a few fossils, among them Fusuliiia cylindrioa, which 
 indicate Carboniferous age. These fossils were found in Carbonifer- 
 ous limestone which lies above the Cambrian quartzite, and probably 
 in the upper part of the limestone, the lower part being presumably 
 Cambrian.* This limestone, according to Mr. Howell,* is about 4,000 
 or 5,000 feet thick. 

MESOZOIC OR TERTIARY. 

As described above, there was found on the road leading east from 
 Osceola a folded conglomei"ate made uj) of coarse limestone frag-
