ments carrying Upper Carboniferous fossils and evidently derived 
 from immediately adjacent Upper Carboniferous strata. This con- 
 glomerate may be part of a series which was examined for 4 miles 
 farther east, and seems to consist mostly of gray sandstones. The 
 sandstones are tilted toward the west, sometimes at angles of 45°, but 
 in one place seem unconformable with a knob of underljdng lime- 
 stone. In the mountains a few miles north of Robinson's ranch, as 
 before noted, there was found a compact red shore conglomerate, 
 composed of limestone fragments carrying Ordovician and Upper 
 Carboniferous fossils. This is 100 feet thick, and below it comes 50 
 feet of consolidated black limestone talus; below the talus is again 
 500 feet of reddish conglomerate. This series dips 45° to the Avest, 
 but 200 yards farther north it seems to pass laterally into the solid 
 rocks from which it is derived. 

It thus appears that above the Upper Carboniferous limestone, and 
 separated from it by a distinct erosion interval, if not by an uncon- 
 formity, is a thick series of gray sandstones and limestone conglomer- 
 ates. We have no means of determining the age of these rocks. 
 In its ijhysical characters the series corresponds roughly to the Trias- 
 sic described in the Wasatch and eastward by Mr. King." It may 
 also be possibly Eocene.^ 

PLIOCENE. 

At the southeastern end of Pleasant Vallej^ is a considerable area of 
 level-topped hills, which rise about 1,500 feet above the valley, and are 
 symmetrically eroded. They are composed of horizontal, slightly con- 
 vsolidated sands, with ledges of conglomerates. At the base of the 
 series the material is coarse and little arranged. 

Just north of here, on the west side of Deep Creek Valle}^, Mr. 
 Emmons^ has described beds of fine sand and marls, with some gravel 
 conglomerate, and notes that they have a general lithologic resem- 
 blance to the Humboldt Pliocene. 

The Pleasant Valley strata also correspond in general appearance 
 to the supposedly Pliocene sands and gravels which are found over so 
 large a part of Nevada. They are far above the shore of Lake Bonne- 
 ville, as indicated b}^ Mr. Gilbert, ^^ and therefore appear to belong to 
 a body of water more ancient and probably more extensive than the 
 Pleistocene lake

Mr. Emmons*^ noted at the northern end of the Deep Creek (or
