about 800 feet above the desert level. This is perhaps one of the 
 terraces of the Pleistocene Lake Bonneville, afterwards described by 
 Mr. Gilbert. 

IGNEOUS ROCKS. 

At the southeastern end of Pleasant Valley occurs a series of small 
 biittes of hornblende-andesite. On the west end of this valley a mod- 
 erately large area at the base of the mountains is of augite-aleutite. 

dike; rocks. 

Along the north side of the Kern Mountains, in Pleasant Valley, 
 many acid dike rocks, A^arying from siliceous alaskite to muscovite- 
 biotite-granite, were found cutting the Cambrian quartzites and 
 limestone. Associated with these dike rocks are abundant quartz 
 veins. It is believed that these dikes have some connection with the 
 probable Archean granite which underlies the quartzites. A specimen 
 of this granite, taken a few miles west of the dikes, proved to be 
 biotite-muscovite-granite. 

STRUCTURE. 

The general structure of the Snake Range, between Wheeler Peak 
 and the Kern Mountains, appears to be anticlinal, although the rocks 
 are mostly worn away from the eastern limb. The axis of the fold 
 runs along the east side of the mountains and is marked by a north- 
 south depression, Avith high hills to the east and the bulk of the 
 range to the west. The general dip on both sides of the axis is per- 
 haps not more than 20°, although it increases locallj^ to 45° and even 
 more. 

In the neighborhood of Wheeler Peak, also, the rocks form a 
 gentle anticline. There is also cross folding, with an east-west axis, 
 so that the peak occupies the center of a quaquaversal. A short dis- 
 tance south of the peak the Avestern half of the princijjal north-south 
 striking anticline is removed, leaving the ridge monoclinal.'* 

At the northern end of the range Mr. HoAvell * noted that the struc- 
 ture of the range is anticlinal at Uiyabi Pass, but from there to 
 Pleasant Valley it is apparently monoclinal, only one limb of the anti- 
 cline being exposed. 

The Kern Mountains, south of Pleasant Valley, appear to consist 
 of an anticlinal fold, Avith northwest- southeast axis transverse to the 
 general trend of folding 

FAULTS. 

Mr. Howell * noted a cross fault running east and west about 4 or 6 
 miles north of Wheeler Peak, having a doAvnthroAv to the south.
