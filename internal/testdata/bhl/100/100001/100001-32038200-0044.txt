36 GEOLOGY OF NEVADA SOUTH OF 40TH PARALLEL, [bull. 208. 

The writer recognized this fault, and 4 or 5 miles north of it a parallel 
 fault, which seems also to have been downthrown to the south. 

Mr. Weeks'^* states that about 10 miles northeast of Osceola, in the 
 central part of the range, the Cambrian limestones are broken by 
 numerous faults which strike northwest and southeast. The massive 
 blue limestones which form the upper part of the series are repeated 
 several times by small faults of 200 to 300 feet throw. The general dip 
 of the Cambrian series is to the north-northwest, and the dip of the 
 Ordovician to the east-northeast. There appears to have been an 
 upthrust of the Cambrian which has brought the successive limestone 
 beds of the series in juxtaposition with the Ordovician. The existence 
 of a heavy fault between the Cambrian and Ordovician is clearly seen 
 in the southern portion of the Snake Range. ^ 

On the north side of the Kern Mountains a belt of quartz veins and 
 siliceous granitic dike rocks, running northwest along the base of the 
 mountains, appears to be along a fault zone. On the north side is the 
 crystalline nearly black Cambrian limestone, while on the south side 
 come schists which represent the top of the underlying Cambrian 
 quartzite. The vertical separation of the fault is probablj^ at least 
 several hundred feet. 

ORES. 

At Osceola, just north of Wheeler Peak, the Cambrian quartzites 
 and slates carry gold. Considerable placer and some vein gold has 
 been taken from this district. 

On the east side of the range there are small mines and prospects 
 in a number of places. In some localities the coincidence of mineral- 
 ization with the presence of a spring flowing in a box canyon leads to 
 the hypothesis that it was these same waters which formerly brought 
 about the ore deposition. Along the walls of such canyons, high 
 above the present bed, ancient water channels in the limestone rock 
 show that the spring has existed since near the time when the erosion 
 of the canyon began. 

CEDAR RANGE AND CLOVER VALLEY MOUNTAINS. 

The Cedar Range consists of broad, irregular, often mesa-like hills, 
 lying south of the Snake Range and northeast of Pioche. Southward 
 from the Cedar Range, and between it and the Mormon Range, there 
 lies to the east of Meadow Valley a wide area of irregular mountains 
 with no definite system of ridges. In these mountains is Clover 
 Valley, whence is taken the name applied here. 

The Cedar Range and the Clover Valley Mountains may be consid- 
 ered together for purposes of description. They have been partly 
 mapped by the Wheeler survey,^ and they have been observed by the 
 writer at several points. So far as known, they consist entirely of 
 lavas.
