SPURB.] CEDAE, CLOVER VALLEY, AND ANTELOPE RANGES. 37 

The geology of these mountains has not been stiTdied in detail, but 
 it is undoubtedl}' much the same as that described in Meadow Valley 
 Canyon,'* which is a chasm cut deep into the same volcanic series. 
 By analogy with the rocks in this canyon, we may suppose that the 
 lavas of the mountains under consideration are associated with de- 
 rived sediments and that these lavas were ejected at different periods. 
 The rock species will probably be found to be varied, ranging, as 
 in Meadow Valley Canyon, from basal rhyolite through andesites, 
 dacites, latites, etc., to the youngest rhyolite and oli vine-basalt. 

ANTELOPE RANGE. 

The Antelope Range is a comparatively insignificant group, about 
 30 miles long, lying just west of the northernmost portion of the 
 Snake Range (Deep Creek Range). 

The central part of the range possesses a topography of considerable 
 relief, mth an especially bold face on the east side (PI. IV, B), while on 
 the north and on the south ends the mountains give way to low hills, 
 which finally disappear under the Pleistocene detritus of the valleys. 

SEDIMENTARY ROCKS. 

On the eastern side of the range, about 3 miles west of Warm 
 Springs, the Eureka quartzite is exposed near the base of the moun- 
 tains, measuring about 200 feet in thickness. Above this come 700 to 
 800 feet of dark-blue (probably Lone Mountain) limestone, having the 
 characteristic texture of this formation in the Eureka district. From 
 here to the crest of the range comes limestones (probably Devonian?) 
 consisting of dark-blue and gray alternating bands. From the 
 extreme base of the mountains the following fossils were found: 
 Leperditia'bivia? White (very poor); Dalmanella perveta? The}^ are 
 Ordivician (Lower Silurian) species, as determined hj Prof. E. O. 
 Ulrich. These fossils are characteristic of the Pogonip horizon at 
 Eureka. 

To the north of this locality, along the eastern face of the moun- 
 tains, the strata lower gently, so that the probable Lone Mountain 
 and Nevada formations (Upper Silurian and Devonian) extend for 
 several miles. To the south the strata rise and the Eureka quartzite 
 passes half way to the top of the mountains, exposing the underlying 
 Pogonip (Lower Silurian) beds. 

This belt of stratified rocks is cut off to the north and to the south 
 by the volcanic rocks which form the greater part of the range. 

IGNEOUS ROCKS. 

Along the eastern base of the range, at the foot of the mountains 
 composed of Paleozoic strata, there is a belt of foothills about 3 miles
