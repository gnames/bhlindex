wide composed of lava. The same lava evidently underlies the 
 detrital dei)osits in the whole valley between the Antelope Mountains 
 and the Kern Mountains in the Snake Range, as is evidenced by occa- 
 sional volcanic buttes which project above the Pleistocene detritus. 
 A few miles soutli of Warm Sjjrings, near Antelope Spring-, the vol- 
 canic rock invades the stratified rock in large masses and soon forms 
 the whole of the mountains. From this point along the road which 
 leads from the southern part of the Antelope Mountains to Schellbourne 
 and Cherry Creek there is nothing but the same reddish lava, and, 
 so far as was seen, the lava seemed to extend northward to the end of 
 the lange. 

Siiecimens of the lava collected at various points throughout the 
 southern part of the range prove to be in general a pyroxene-aleutite. 
 It is essentially^ the same rock which stretches across the intervening 
 valley to the foothills at the western base of the Snake Range, north 
 of the Kern Mountains. The same body of lava also fills tlie whole 
 valley between the Antelope Mountains and the northern part of the 
 Schell Creek Range, and extends to the summit of this range. 

The lava constituting the northern part of the range has been 
 described by Mr. Emmons '^ as rhyolite. 

STRUCTURE. 

Where the Paleozoic rocks are exposed in the Antelope Range the 
 strike is in general north and south and the dip 20° W. On the west- 
 ern borders of the Snake Range, directly east of here, they have a 
 general dip of 15° E. The intervening valley is, therefore, perhaps 
 anticlinal. The structure of the stratified rocks of the Antelope 
 Mountains is obscured hy the ove-rlying lavas. 

SCHELL CREEK AND HIGHLAND RANGES. 

The Schell Creek Range has its northern end at the fortieth par- 
 allel (PI. Ill, B) and extends from here southward about 100 miles to 
 Patterson. Here a slight gap separates it from the Highland Range, 
 which is a direct continuation of it. The Highland Range extends 
 from Patterson southward for about 80 miles, when it runs into the 
 Meadow Valley Range, from which it is separated by no distinct gap. 
 The Meadow Valley Range will be described later. 

SEDIMENTARY ROCKS. 
 CAMBRIAN. 

At the northern end of the Schell Creek Range, in the vicinity of 
 Schellbourne, Mr. Emmons^ noted limestones carrying Cambrian fos- 
 sils and overlying heavy bodies of Cambrian quartzite. Mr. Gilbert^
