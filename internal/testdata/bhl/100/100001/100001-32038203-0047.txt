noted also Cambrian fossils near Scliellbourne and also botli north, 
 and south of it. In Rnbj^ Hill Canyon, about 10 miles south of Schell- 
 bourne, quartzites were noted at the eastern base of the ranjj-e, over- 
 lain by several thousand feet of limestones. About 18 or 20 miles 
 south of Ruby Hill and a few miles south of Piermont, at Whites 
 Peak, the quartzites have risen to the crest of the range and together 
 with, the associated schists display a thickness of over 11,000 feet. 
 Tlie strata dip 15° or 20° W., and the overlying limestone appears on 
 the west flank of the peak. Southward from "Whites Peak the qiiartz- 
 ite gradually sinks again, and the crest of the range is made up of 
 the overlying limestones. 

The writer crossed the Schell Creek Range at Scliellbourne and 
 found the eastern side composed of volcanic rock. A quarter of a 
 mile east of the summit dark-blue massive limestone begins. Under- 
 lying this limestone, on the west side of the x>ass, occurs dark-blue 
 limy shale, containing Cambrian fossils, as determined by Mr. C. D. 
 Walcott. 

This shale is several hundred feet thick and contains a bed of fine- 
 grained brown-weathering quartzite 100 feet thick. Similar fossils 
 are found above and below the quartzite. Beneath the shale comes a 
 well-bedded limestone. 

In the west-facing scarp of the mountain, directly north of the pass 
 as seen from Scliellbourne, the section examined may be seen finely 
 exposed. From stratigraphic evidence the writer would be inclined 
 to correlate the uppermost limestone with tlie Hamburg formation of 
 Eureka, the shales with the Secret Canyon formation, and the lower 
 limestones with the Prospect Mountain limestone. An estimated 
 section of the mountains here is as follows :

Neither the top nor the bottom of the section was observed. 

About 30 miles south of Whites Peak and Piermont the writer 
 crossed the Schell Creek Range along the main road between Ely and 
 Osceola. On the east side of the summit (which is not high at this 
 point) limestone carrying abundant Carboniferous fossils appears to 
 abut against massive dark-blue metamorphosed limestone, reticulated 
 with calcite veins, and associated with beds of marble. Immediatelj^ 
 below the metamorphic limestone beds is a ferruginous and micaceous 
 slate seam, contorted and containing veins of quartzite and calcite. 
 This limestone and underlying schistose slates constitute the whole 
 eastern part of the range. 

1^0 fossils were found at this point, but the beds are probably to be 
 correlated with the Cambrian limestones and underlving shales at
