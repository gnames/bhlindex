Whites Peak, at Ruby Hill, and Schellbourne. The succession and 
 the general chai'acter of the rocks are also similar to those of the 
 Cambrian limestones and shales in the Highland Range in the vicin- 
 ity of Pioche and in the Snake Range directly east of here, in both of 
 which localities Cambrian fossils have been found. 

On the west side of the range, north of the locality just described 
 and directly east of Ely in the Egan Range, the ridge which flanks the 
 main Schell Creek Range on the east has along its crest what appears 
 from a distance to be the white Eureka quartzite of the Silurian, dipping 
 west at a constant angle of about 30°. Between this ridge and the 
 main range there is a parallel depression which runs along the axis of 
 an anticline, for to the east of it the strata have an easterly dip of from 
 20° to 30°. On the ridge itself there comes in below the Eureka 
 quartzite strata resembling the thick, comparativelj' soft limestones of 
 the Pogonip formation, and beneath this, in the bottom of the valley, 
 are exposed massive gray limestones, which are perhaps Cambrian. 
 These Cambrian and Silurian rocks do not extend south past the end of 
 the ridge which forms the western high limb of the anticline, but are 
 replaced to the south ^^y the Devonian, tilie two regions being appar- 
 ently separated by a heavy east-west fault. 

Mr. Howell'* has described the rocks at the southern end of the 
 Schell Creek Range. He notes that at Patterson a heavy bed of 
 quartzite is exposed, dipping about 45° ESE. A few miles to the 
 north this is covered conformabl}^ by bluish-gray limestone. IsTo fos- 
 sil remains sufficient for determination were found, but the limestone 
 was correlated on lithologic grounds with the su^jposedly Carbonifer- 
 ous limestones of the Snake Range and the Highland Range. Inas- 
 much as at least the southern portion of the Highland Range consists 
 of Cambrian limestones, which were classed by Mr. Howell as Carbon- 
 iferous, but subsequently definitelj^ determined as Cambrian, and 
 since the same Cambrian series occurs in the Snake Range, it seems 
 likely that these rocks may also be Cambrian.* 

At the north end of the Highland Range, just south of Patterson, 
 Mr. Howell found Carboniferous limestone well characterized by 
 fossils. 

At Bristol, on the west side of the range, and about 30 miles 
 south of Patterson, Mr. Howell noted quartzite at the base, while 
 the whole upper portion was highly metamorphic limestone. This 
 section, so far as it goes, accords with the Cambrian section of the 
 southern end of the range, as will be mentioned later. 

Mr. Walcott '' noted on the western side of the range, at the same 
 locality as just mentioned, the occurrence of the Eureka quartzite. It 
 is possible that this is the same quartzite mentioned by Mr. Howell.

 in these limestones, above the quartzites.
