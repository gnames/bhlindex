SPURR.] SCHELL CREEK AND HIGHLAND RANGES. 41 

The writer passed only a few miles from Bristol, proceeding- from 
 Coyote Spring over Stami^ede Gap, and he also mapped the Silurian 
 as extending across the valley to Bristol, and indicated in liis notes 
 the probable occui'rence of the Eureka quartzite. 

At Stampede Gap the range, with the exception of some ver}^ low 
 foothills at the western base, which will be referred to later as prob- 
 ably Devonian or Silurian, is composed of about 800 feet of mingled 
 limestone and slate overlain by about 1,400 feet of massive limestone 
 containing siliceous beds. Some of these upper limestones carry 
 indistinct and indeterminable organic remains. A mottled structure, 
 seeming to indicate the former presence of coral remains in the now 
 altered rock, is common, being the same structure as observed in the 
 Cambrian rocks of the Schell Creek Range, described above as occur- 
 ring about 30 miles south of Piermont. In the limestones at both 
 localities metainorphism has caused the same peculiar pitted appear- 
 ance which results from the segregation of metamorphic minerals. 

In the Highland Range, about 4 miles south of Stampede Gap and 
 about the same distance southwest from Pioche, the entire range 
 appears to be of Cambrian strata, and Mr. Walcott" has measured 
 the following section:

The fossils which he collected at various points correlated this sec- 
 tion with the Cambrian at Eureka, the Itasal quartzite corresponding 
 to the Prospect Mountain quartzite. 

In the Highland Range, south of Bennetts Spring, the writer has 
 noted the probable continuation of the Cambrian section for a dis- 
 tance of 5 or 6 miles at the very least, the section being substantially 
 the same as between Bennetts Spring and Stampede Gap. From the 
 eastern base of the Highland Range abundant quantities of brown 
 quartzite, probably representing the basal Cambrian quartzite of Mr. 
 Walcott's section, come down into the vallej^ drift. This quartzite is 
 probabh^ overlain by the Cambrian limestone, for the strata appear 
 horizontal on the east side of the Highland Range throughout prac- 
 tically its whole length. 

At Pioche Mr. Howell* noted 400 feet of highly metamorphic blue- 
 gray limestone, and below this about .400 feet of shales, which yielded 
 abundant Cambrian fossils. Below these shales is an unknown thick- 
 ness of quartzite. He correlated this quartzite with the Cambrian 
 quartzites of the Snake and Wasatch ranges. Mr. Walcott* has also
