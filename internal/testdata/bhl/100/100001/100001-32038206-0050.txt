studied the Cambrian section at Pioche and finds a tliiclvness of the 
 basal quartzite of 1,200 feet on the west face of the Elj^ Range, a few 
 miles to the west of the town of Pioche. Mining operations have 
 thrown out large masses of shales carrying Cambrian fossils, which 
 Mr. Walcott * has described and correlated with a bed of the Highland 
 Range section. Similar fossils were also collected at the same locality 
 hy the writer. This horizon is well up in the shaly limestone which 
 overlies the basal quartzite. 

Three or 4 miles southeast of Pioche, along the road to Panaca, 
 what is probablj^ tlie basal quartzite is slightly exposed, immediately 
 overlain by the shales. From these shales Mr. Walcott collected a 
 number of Cambrian fossils. The writer also collected fossils from 
 this point. 

SILURIAN. 

In the western face of the Schell Creek Range, just east of EI3' in 
 the Egan Range, what is perhaps the Silurian Eureka quartzite 
 appears, forming the crest of a minor ridge, flanking to the west the 
 main Schell Creek Range. The quartzite dips to the west about 30" 
 and is underlain by what appears to be the Pogonip formation. No 
 fossils were collected. 

The Silurian rocks above described are probably cut off to the south 
 by an east- west fault, for thej^ are succeeded bj^ Devonian strata. 

Mr. F. B. Weeks ^ found, in 1900, that, about 10 miles nortli of the 
 road leading from Osceola to Ely, the Cambrian beds on the north- 
 east are separated from Ordovician beds on the southwest b}^ a heavy 
 fault. In these Ordovician beds the following fossils, determined by 
 Professor Ulrich, were collected : 

Orthis (related to O. bellariigosa)-. 

Dalraaiiella (near perveta). 

Dalmanella (near emacerata). 

Modiolodon sp. nndet.
