spuRR] SCHELL CREEK AND HIGHLAND EANGES. 43 

Another lot was as follows: 

Asaphus (related to Megalaspis belemnuras White). 

Two species of trilobites related to Symphysurus goldfussi Walcott. 

Leperditella (related to L. inflata). 

Undet. ostracod (? related to Octonaria). 

Silurian rocks do not appear, so far as yet observed, until the neigh- 
 borhood of Bristol, where the Eureka quartzite Avas observed by Mr. 
 Walcott. The writer also has observed probable Silurian rocks, con- 
 stituting low hills, which connect the Highland Range, in th.e neigh- 
 borhood of Bristol, with the irregular ridges lying between the Egan 
 and Pahroc ranges. 

Farther south Mr. Walcott " has noted the Eureka quartzite on the 
 west side of the Highland Range, in a hill north of the road leading 
 from Bennetts Spring to Hiko. At this point fossils ai'e very abundant. 

DEVONIAN. 

At the western base of the Highland Range, at Stampede Gap, 
 highly fossiliferous strata were observed, probably separated from the 
 Cambrian strata which form the mass of the range bj^ a heavy north- 
 south fault. No fossils were collected, but from the stratigraphy it 
 seems possible that these are the continuation of rocks in the neigh- 
 borhood of Coyote Spring, at the northern end of the Pahroc Range, 
 just west from Stampede Gap, which are Devonian. 

On the western side of the range, north of the road which crosses 
 it between Ely and Osceola, the writer found dark-blue to gray-blue, 
 often shaly limestone filled with calcite seams. From one horizon in 
 this limestone he collected the following Devonian fossils, which were 
 determined by Dr. George H. Girty: Stromatoporoid coral, Sjjirifer 
 utaJiensis, and Amhocadia umbonata. 

These Devonian strata are apparentl^^ separated from Silurian and 
 Cambrian rocks farther north by an east- west fault. 

CARBONIFEROUS. 

The western half of the Schell Creek Range, where it was crossed qn 
 the road between Ely and Osceola, about 20 miles southeast of Ely, 
 is chiefly composed of Carboniferous rocks. Thej" consist mostly of 
 dark-blue, gray-blue, and often shaly limestones, with occasional 
 brown quartzite seams. Some of the beds are semicrystalline. The 
 series throughout is highl}^ fossiliferous. 

Just after the road enters the range Upper Carboniferous fossils 
 were collected. They wore determined by Dr. George H. Girty, as 
 follows: Zaphrentis sp., Productus sp., Spirifer rockymontanus, ^ 
 Semimda sp.
