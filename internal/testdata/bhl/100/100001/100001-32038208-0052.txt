44 GEOLOGY OF NEVADA SOUTH OF 40TH PARALLEL, [bull. 208. 

A mile east of the above-mentioned locality the following Upper 
 Carboniferous fossils were collected : 

Orbiculoidea missoiiriensis. 

Prodiictiis infiattis? 

Marginif era imiricata. T 

Cleiothyris orbicularis. 

Seminula snbtilita. ' 

Rhombopora lepidodendroides. 

All these Carboniferous rocks dij) to the east 20° or 30°, and appar- 
 ently abut directly against the Cambrian on the east. 

Near the northern end of the Highland Range, 3 or -4 miles south of 
 Patterson, Mr. Howell'^' has noted 2,000 feet of limestone containing 
 well-marked Carboniferous fossils. 

IGNEOUS ROCKS. 

In the vicinity of Schellbourne the whole eastern part of the Schell 
 Creek Range is covered by basic lava, and this also overflows to the 
 western part of the range, covering up in patches the stratified Cam- 
 brian rocks. This lava is in general a pyroxene-aleutite. According 
 to Mr. Emmons,* the extreme northern portion of the range is entirely 
 covered by rhyolite. In the vicinity of Schellbourne the writer 
 found, underlying the basic lava, a few feet of white biotite-rhj^olite. 

On the western side of the Highland Range, 5 or 6 miles south of its 
 northern end, Mr. Howell '^ has reported lava. Still farther south, at 
 Stampede Gap, the writer observed a small area of rhyolite in the 
 vallej^ at the western base of the mountain. 

Mr. Gilbert '^^ has noted in Ruby Hill Canj'on, a few miles south of 
 Schellbourne, siliceous dikes cutting the Cambrian limestones. 

STRUCTURE. 

On the west side of Schell Creek Range, just east of Ely, a conspic- 
 uous anticline was observed, trending parallel to the crest of the main 
 range. The axis of this anticline is occupied by a valle}^, and the 
 western limb is marked by a minor north-south ridge running from 
 about the latitude of Ely northward to the neighborhood of Schell- 
 bourne, The rocks exposed in this anticlinal fold are probably Silu- 
 rian. To the south the fold, and at the same time the ridge in which
