its western limb is exhibited, are api3arently cut off by an east-west 
 fault, while on the north the rocks of the fold pass under the Pleisto- 
 cene valley detritus. About 10 miles south of the southern end of 
 the minor ridges above mentioned what aj)pears to be the continua- 
 tion of the same anticlinal fold is exhibited in the foothills on the 
 west side of the range. Still farther south the general strike of the 
 rocks changes from south to soutliAvest, and this anticlinal fold prob- 
 ably passes over into the southern end of the Egan Range, Avhere-a 
 series of folds was observed, one of which is perhaps identical with 
 it. Farther south again there is probably another synclinal fold, 
 whicli also passes over into the Egan Range on account of its south- 
 westerly strike. This is probably followed by an anticlinal fold, such 
 as HowelP' has described, at the extreme southern end of the range, 
 where the rocks dip east-southeast. Still farther south the several 
 folds which are found in the ridges forming the southern extremity 
 of the Egan Range are probably continuous across the intervening 
 valley to the Highland Range. 

The Cambrian rocks, which form the greater iDart of the eastern 
 portion of the Schell Creek and Highland ranges, are also folded. 
 At Schellbourne the rocks seemed to the writer to dip in general to 
 the east, although the attitude could not be certainly made out. 
 Farther south, at Whites Peak, Mr. Gilbert^ found the Cambrian 
 rocks dipping to the west at an angle of about 20°. Still farther 
 south, Avhere the writer observed the Cambrian rocks in crossing the 
 range between Ely and Osceola, he found the folding complicated 
 and the faulting considerable. 

In the Highland Range the folds in the Cambrian rocks appear to 
 be gentle and of no great extent. Those that were observed Avere 
 mostly transverse to the range, and in general the disposition of the 
 horizons did not vary greatlj^ from what they would have been had 
 they been horizontal. 

FAULTING. 

Although no careful examination has been made, the stratigraphy 
 indicates the existence of important faults in the Schell Creek and 
 Highland ranges. These probably belong to two chief systems — one 
 north and south and one east and west. On the road which crosses 
 the Schell Creek Range between Ely in the Egan Range and Osceola 
 in the Snake Range the whole rock series dips to the east. The east- 
 ern half of the range is comj)osed of Upper Carboniferous limestones 
 carr3ing abundant fossils, while the western is composed of metamor- 
 phic limestones underlain by schistose mica-slates. The character of 
 these later rocks, together with the succession, enables one to correlate 
 them with the Cambrian rocks found in the same range just north of
