here and also in the Highland and Snake ranges. This implies 
 either an enormous fault or a great erosion gap. 

Opposite Stampede Gap the writer crossed the valley which lies on 
 the west of the range from a district where there ai^e abundant expo- 
 sures of fossiliferons Devonian and Silurian rocks. At the western 
 base of the range he noted in the foothills fossiliferons strata, appar- 
 ently belonging to the same series, from which, however, he collected 
 no fossil remains. Proceeding farther west he found the whole moun- 
 tain made up of altered massive limestones, with intercalated shales 
 and schistose slates, which belong to the Cambrian. A few miles 
 north of Stampede Gap, at Bristol, Mr. Walcott found the Eureka 
 quartzite of the Silurian at the western base of the mountains, and 
 the same formation about 15 miles south of Stampede Gap on the road 
 from Bennetts Spring to Hiko. Both these places occupy the same 
 relative position at the Avestern base of the range. Between these 
 Silurian foothills and the Cambrian rocks of the main range there 
 appears to be a great break, bringing about juxtaposition of strata 
 which in their normal stratigraphic succession are separated by nearly 
 2 miles of intervening sediments. This is believed to be the same 
 break as that previously noted farther north, and it may be either a 
 fault or an erosion gap. 

An east-west fault ai3pears to cut the range transversely at a point 
 about 10 miles southeast of Ely in the Egan Range. To the north 
 of this line is an anticlinal fold which exposes probable Silurian or 
 Cambrian rocks. To the south only the eastern limb of the fold is 
 found, the ridge which represents the western limb being cut off. On 
 the south side the rocks carry Devonian fossils. 

About 10 miles north of the road which crosses the range between 
 Osceola and Ely Mr. F. B. Weeks* observed, in 1900, a strong north- 
 west fault marked by a profound interior valley. Cambrian rocks on 
 the northeast side of the fault are brought against Ordovician strata 
 on the north. The fault cuts across the entire range. 

Mr. Howell^ noted a probable cross fault near the north end of the 
 Highland Range. The line of this fault is continuous with a probable 
 fault line sketched by the writer on the Egan Range, just to the west. 
 The writer also saw, a few miles north of this, what is perhaps a par- 
 allel east- west fault, marked by a deep transverse valley in the Egan 
 Range and extending across to the gap which separates the Schell 
 Creek Range from the Highland Range. The displacement of these 
 faults was not measured, but is probably very considerable. 

At Pioche there are a number of intersecting faults, some belonging 
 to a northwest-southeast system and some to a northeast-southwest 
 system. The main fault observed by the writer runs tlirough the 
 south end of the town, in a northwest direction. It is marked bj'- a
