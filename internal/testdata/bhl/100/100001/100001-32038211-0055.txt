deep guleli, and has the Cambrian quartzite on the northeast side and 
 the Cambrian shale and limestone on the south. This fault has at 
 least 1,000 feet of vertical separation and may have much more. 
 Other faults are parallel to this, and there are a number of northeast- 
 southwest cross faults with considerable displacement. The effect of 
 these is to cause a certain degree of checkering of quartzite and lime- 
 stone. The northeast gulch in which Pioche lies seems to mark one 
 of these faults.'* 

EGAN RANGE. 

The Egan Range is the next important range west of the Schell Creek 
 and Highland ranges. Its north end lies just north of the fortieth 
 parallel and is included in the maps of the Fortieth Parallel Survey. 
 It extends due southward nearly 150 miles. 

TOPOGRAPHY. 

; Throughout nearly its whole course the Egan Range consists of a 
 single well-defined central ridge, from which the slopes to the valley 
 on both sides are comparatively steep. In the neighborhood of Ely 
 the ridges are slightlj^ broken up, but this is apparently due largely 
 to the presence of igneous rocks. At the extreme south end, also, the 
 main range splits up into several low ridges. 

The range is cut through at intervals by transverse valleys connect- 
 ing the vallej^s on either side of the range and very little higher than 
 they. Such valleys are found at Egan Canyon and at Ely. Near the 
 southern end of the range there are other deep transverse gaps, 
 which, however, do not cut clear down to the level of the vallej^s. 

ARCHEAN ROCKS. 

Mr. S. F. Emmons * has described the rocks in an outlying ridge on 
 the east side of the range, just south of the eastern end of Egan 
 Canyon. Here the lowest formation exposed is a mica-granite, which 
 is overlain by quartzites and quartzitic schists referred to the Cam- 
 brian. The granite is referred to the Archean. 

SEDIMENTARY ROCKS. 
 CAMBRIAN. 

As above noted, Mr. Emmons found overlying the granite at the 
 eastern end of Egan Canyon several thousand feet of quartzites and 
 quartzitic schists, together with a 50-foot bed of argillite. These 
 quartzites are overlain hy limestones. 

The same locality was observed by the writer from a distance, and 
 on account of the stratigraphy was referred with little hesitation to 

Â« These observations are in accordance with those previously made hy Mr. Howell (U. S. Geog. 
 Surv. W. One Hundreth Mer., Vol. Ill, pp. 2,57-361), as the writer discovered since writing the 
 above.
