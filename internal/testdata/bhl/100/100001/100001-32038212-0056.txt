the Cambrian. The rocks were not visited, but at the base are heavy 
 beds dipping to the west at an angle of about 30" and striking north 
 and south. These massive beds resemble the Cambrian quartzite 
 and limestone, while above them come more easily eroded limestones, 
 which correspond in thickness and position to the Silurian Pogonip 
 formation. Above the Pogonip on the east face of tlie main ridge 
 (which is separated from tlie spur above mentioned by a trough of 
 erosion) is exposed the Eureka quartzite, which is traceable along 
 the range for several miles northward. The identification of this 
 Silurian makes the reference of the easterly rocks of the outlying 
 spur to the Cambrian safe. 

Mr. F. B. Weeks '^^ reports that in the summit of the range, about 
 10 to 12 miles south of Egan Canyon, the following Upper Cambrian 
 fossils, determined by Mr. Walcott, were collected: 

Obolus (Lingulella) discoidensls H. & W. 
 Obolus (Lingulella) manticiilus White. 
 Obolus (Lingulella) punctatus Walcott. 
 Ophileta? 
 Agnostus, 2 sp. 
 Ptychoparia, 2 sp. 

Along the soutliern jjart of the Egan Range the west face, which 
 confronts the southern part of Sierra Valley, exposes some magnificent 
 sections of strata. These also were not visited any farther north than 
 the vicinity cf Adams's ranch on White River, near which point they 
 were found to be Devonian. Farther north, however, a thick section 
 of rocks, striking northeast and dipping southeast at an average 
 angle of 30", was exposed, and the circumstance that the strike is 
 diagonal to the north-south face of the range brings it about that 
 progressively lower beds are exjiosed going north. About 2 miles 
 north of the vicinity of Butterfleld Spring what was taken to be 
 Eureka quartzite was seen at a distance; below this occurs a great 
 thickness of more easily eroded limestones, which were referred to the 
 Pogoni'p formation; and beneath these again massive limestones, 
 which perhaps represent the Upper Cambrian. Only a comparatively 
 slight thickness of the latter limestones is exposed, when the dip of 
 the section is reversed and becomes northwest, so that the section 
 begins to ascend toward the north.

Mr. Emmons* noted the finding of Silurian fossils in the limestone 
 in the neighborhood of Egan Canyon. The writer, who crossed the 
 range at this point from Cherry Creek westerly, did not succeed in 
 finding any good fossils, but identified the formations on lithologic 
 and stratigraphic grounds as notably belonging to the Pogonip, the
