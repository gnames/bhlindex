Eureka, and the Lone Mountain formations of the Silurian as exhib- 
 ited in the Eureka section. In the easterly spur of the mountains 
 just south of Egan Canyon, as above noted, the whole thickness of the 
 Pogonip strata is exposed, occupjang a valley of erosion between this 
 spur and the main ridge. On the easterly face of the main ridge the 
 Eureka quartzite is exposed, and may be traced across Cherry Creek 
 and still farther north. Above the quartzite, in ascending from 
 Cherrj^ Creek westerly, dark-blue cr^^stalline limestones, similar litli- 
 ologicall}^ to the Lone Mountain limestones of Eureka, and carrying 
 indistinct fossils, were observed. 

The probable exposure of the Eureka quartzite on the western face 
 of the range, near its southern end, has already been noted in con- 
 nection with tlie probable Cambrian exposures. It is probable that 
 along here not only the Eureka quartzite, but the whole Silurian sec- 
 tion, is exposed. 

Crossing the separate low ridges which constitute the connection 
 between the southern end of the Egan Range and the Pahroc Range, 
 what is almost certainly the Eureka quartzite was found about 25 
 miles northwest of Pioche. Here was found a white vitreous quartz- 
 ite, rather coarse grained and upward of 100 feet thick, above which 
 lie dark-graj', comparatively thin fetid crystalline limestones, with 
 the fossils too much altered to be recognizable. This is perhaps the 
 Lone Mountain limestone. These Silurian rocks are exposed only 
 along the eroded axis of an east-west anticline, and to the north 
 and south are overlying rocks from which Devonian fossils were col- 
 lected. The general structure of the beds at this point makes it 
 probable that a little farther northeast a greater thickness of Silurian 
 rocks is exposed, in the valley midway between this point and the 
 Highland Range. 

DEVONIAN. 

The western face of the Egan Range about 8 or 10 miles north of 
 Cherry Creek is composed of stratified rocks dipping very gently 
 northwest. These stratified rocks are limestones whose appearance 
 suggests the Nevada formation of the Devonian. A short distance north 
 of these, also on the west face of the range, black, shaly, fetid lime- 
 stones carrying Upper Carboniferous fossils were obtained, wuile 
 south of the supijosed Devonian rocks, in the neighborhood of Cherry 
 Creek, there are exposed Silurian f ormatious, as already mentioned. It 
 is more than x^robable, therefore, that the intervening rocks are really 
 Devonian. Mr.- Emmons has made the same suggestion.* 

In the canyon which cuts through the range at Ely limestones carry- 
 ing Lower Carboniferous fossils were found. In these limestones are 
 siliceous beds which may perhaps represent the Diamond Peak 
 quartzite of the Eureka section, beneath which there is a slight
