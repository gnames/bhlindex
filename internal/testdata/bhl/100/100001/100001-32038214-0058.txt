50 GEOLOGY OF NEVADA SOUTH OF 40TH PARALLEL, [bull. 208. 

exposure of shaly limestone which may represent the White Pine 
 formation. No fossils, however, were procured from these beds, and 
 their identification as Devonian is only provisional. 

At the northern end of the curving spur which joins the main range 
 near this point (PL Y, A), where it passes under andesitic flows just 
 south of Summit stage station Cyathojjhyllum sp. was found, and was 
 referred to the Devonian by Dr. George H. Girty. 

This Devonian area, however, is small, since at a distance of 2 miles 
 farther south similar limestones carrying Carboniferous fossils were 
 found. 

Devonian rocks make uj) nearly the whole of the series of low ridges 
 which constitute the extreme southern end of the Egan Range, so far 
 as these rocks were examined bj^ the writer in crossing diagonally from 
 northwest to southeast. In crossing the pass which cuts through 
 the western and main ridge of these mountains, about 10 miles due 
 southeast from Adams's ranch, comparatively thin-bedded fetid lime- 
 stones were found folded into a syncline striking diagonally to the 
 trend of the pass, and carrying the following Devonian fossils, as 
 determined by Dr. George H. Girty: 

Amphipora? sp. 
 Cladopora? sp. 
 Stromatoporoid coral. 
 Chonetes macrostriatus. 
 Spirifer utahensis. 

The corals obtained here make up the greater bulk of the rock, 
 which appears, therefore, to have been a Paleozoic coral reef. Both 
 the fossils and the nature of the inclosing rocks are identical with 
 the fossils and rocks found in the Golden Gate Range, directly west 
 of here and about 15 miles distant. 

Following the road from here southeastward to Pioche, Devonian 
 fossils were again obtained about 12 miles south of the first localitj^ 
 as follows: 

Amphipora? sp. 
 Stromatoporoid corals. 
 Spirifer mala (small variety). 

Again about 6 miles farther southeast the following Devonian fos- 
 sils were collected: 

Fucoid. 

Prodtictella stibaculeata. 
 Rliipidomella sp. 
 Spirifer disjnncttis. 
 Spirifer iitaliensis. 
 Spirifer strigosus ? 
 Ambocoelia umbonata. 
 Camarotoecliia sappho. 
 Modiomorpha obtusa ? 
 Grammysia minor ? 
 Losonema? sp.
