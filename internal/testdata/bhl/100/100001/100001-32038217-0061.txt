The structure of the surrounding ridges makes it probable that most 
 of them are Devonian. 

CARBONIFEROUS. 

In the extreme northern end of the Egan Range Mr. Emmons'* col- 
 lected probable Carboniferous fossils. On the western front, about 
 12 miles north of Cherry Creek, the following fossils were collected by 
 the writer and identified by Dr. Girty : 

Orbiculoidea missouriensis ? 
 Marginif era splendens ? 
 Prodiictus 11. sp. 
 Spirorbis sp. 
 Euoniphalus catilloldes. 

Between Egan Canyon and Ely it is probable that the Carboniferous 
 rocks cover a considerable area. Near Ely, Carboniferous limestones 
 are abundantly exposed. About 2 miles south of Summit Springs, 
 on the road between Ely and Hamilton, massive semicrj^stalline lime- 
 stones are found which carry a probablj^ Upper Carboniferous fossil 
 that was determined by Dr. Girty as Zaplirentis sp. 

About 6 miles east of here, on the east side of the narrow valley 
 separating the minor ridge, in which the above fossil was obtained, 
 from the main range, were collected the following Upper Carbonifer- 
 ous fossils: 

Seminula subtilita? 
 Lithostrotion ? sp. 
 Ftistilina cylindrica. 

Two miles southeast of the last-named locality, near the western 
 entrance of the canyon which cuts through the range at Ely, dark- 
 gray carbonaceous fetid limestones were found which carry the fol- 
 lowing Lower Carboniferous fossils : 

Zaplirentis sp. 
 Ortliotlietes ingequalis. 
 Rhipidomella miclielini. 
 Productus serdireticulatris var. 
 Prodiictus n. sp. 
 Spirif er ceiitronatiis. 
 Straparollus liixus. 
 Proetus peroecidens. 

The black shaly limestone which carries the Lower Carboniferous 
 fauna at the last-named locality passes into a belt of red, yellow, and 
 orange weathering shales, with occasional beds of gray, shaly lime- 
 stone. The thickness of these shales is estimated at from 800 to 
 1,000 feet. Farther east in the canyon beds of cherty and siliceous 
 limestones also occur in this same series. It is probable that the low- 
 est of these shaly beds are Devonian, but to the south of Ely, above
