the shales, the more massive limestone comes in above again and 
 extends for 5 or 6 miles at least, striking east and west and dipping 
 gently south. 

On the southeastern slope of Hamels Peak, some miles south of Ely, 
 the fossils named below were collected by Mr. F. B. Weeks,^ and were 
 determined by Dr. Girty. Regarding this collection, Mr. Girty states 
 "The fauna has a similar fades to that of the Marion formation of 
 the Kansas section, which Prosser regards as a true Permian fauna, 
 and it probably can be safely correlated with the Marion."

IGNEOUS ROCKS. 

On the west side of the Egan Range, just north of Egan Canyon, a 
 series of low hills are composed of basalt. One of these hills has a 
 conical shape practically unmodified, and, from the circumstance of 
 this slight erosion, the age of the lava must be very recent. 

Farther south, also on the west side of the range, is a considerable 
 mass of volcanic rock which has filled up the vallej^ between the 
 southern end of the Long Valle}^ Range and the Egan Range north 
 of Ely. This is, in general, a dacite-andesite and has been deeply 
 eroded, indicating greater age for it than for the basalt. 

At the southern end of the range, in the sei3arate low ridges which 
 form the connection of this range with the Pahroc Range, there are 
 large areas of quartz-latite which seem to be continuous with similar 
 lavas occurring in the northern end of the Golden Gate Range and 
 on the easterly side of the Grant Range in the same latitude. As in 
 the other cases described, it is plain that these outflows occurred 
 subsequent to the formation of the deep valleys between the limestone 
 ridges, for the volcanic rock either fills up such valleys or has been 
 poured into them without quite filling them up and now forms their 
 floor. Nevertheless, this volcanic rock is also deeply eroded, and 
 therefore its age is not recent. It may be considered as very late 
 Tertiary or early Pleistocene.
