SPURR.] EGAK RANGE 58 

DIKES. 

At tlie western entrance of the canyon wliich cuts through the range 
 at Ely a dike of hornblende-tonalite-porphjay was noted. Farther 
 east in the eanj^on occur a number of other siliceous dikes. These 
 dikes probably connect with a larger body farther south, which seems 
 to form the crest of the range in the ^dcinit5^ of Howells Peak. 

Just west of the town of Cherry Creek occur a number of dikes 
 which are apparently connected with a larger igneous body a little 
 farther north. Specimens of these dikes show them to be chiefly 
 quartz-monzonites. 

STRUCTURE. 

The extreme northern end of the range is said by Mr. Emmons^ to 
 present an anticlinal fold striking northeasterly, and so diverging 
 from the general trend of the mountains. Farther south, but still 
 north of Egan Canyon, the general structure is plainlj^ synclinal, 
 and has the same northeasterly trend. This syncline must succeed 
 the anticline to the southeast. In the vicinity of Egan Canyon, on the 
 eastern side of the range, the strata on the eastern limb of this syn- 
 cline dip to the Avest at angles of from 30° to 45°, which gradually 
 grow less to the west until, at a point about 8 or 10 miles north of 
 Cherry Creek, and on the west side of the range, easterly dipping 
 strata constituting the other side of the syncline are found. 

Between the Cambrian rocks on the eastern side of Egan Canyon 
 and the same formations on the west face of the Schell Creek Range, 
 only a few miles to the east, there is probably an anticlinal fold 
 occupying Steptoe Valley. 

From Egan Canyon south the Egan Range may be seen to consist 
 of stratified rocks as far as Ely, but the general northeasterly trend 
 of the beds at Egan Canyon changes to a northwesterly one in the 
 mountains north of Hercules Gate, about 10 miles north of Ely. The 
 general structure of the mountains at this point seems lobe synclinal, 
 the western limb of the fold being exposed in the Devonian limestone 
 lying just south of Summit stage station on the road between Ely and 
 Hamilton. These limestones dip to the east at an angle of 20°. 

From Ely south for a number of miles the strata are not conspicu- 
 ously folded, but dip gently in various directions, chiefly to the south. 
 The whole southern end of the range, however, from a point about 10 
 or 15 miles south of Ely as far as the point where the main range 
 begins to split up into several, shows beds which strike uniformly 
 northeast, at an angle with the general north-south trend of the 
 mountains. The farther south one goes the more easterly becomes 
 the strike of the strata, until, in the series of low ridges at the south-
