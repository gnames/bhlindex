54 GEOLOGY OF NEVADA SOUTH OF 40TH PARALLEL. [BULt..208. 

ern end of the range, it swings aronnd to east-west and then to south- 
 east, and so runs into the Pahroc Range, where it becomes due north 
 and south. 

In this southern i3art of the range many parallel open folds are 
 exposed. On the west face, about 30 miles north of Adams's ranch, in 
 Sierra Valley, the axis of a broad syncline may be traced, with the 
 rocks on both sides dipping from 10° to 30°. This is followed to the 
 south hy a slight anticline and this by a broad syncline, whose axis 
 cuts the mountains about 10 miles southeast of Adams's ranch, at 
 the pass through which runs the road to Pioche. South of here the 
 succeeding anticlines and synclines are frequent and regular. Since 
 their strike is transverse in general to the trend of the ridges and 
 since different ridges are composed of the same i-ocks, the folds may 
 be traced from one to the other for long distances. Thus, south of 
 the synclinal fold above described a broad anticline was observed, 
 which comprises the rocks for a distance of about 10 miles to the 
 south and which has in general an east-west trend. South of this 
 a comparatively^ narrow syncline exists, and south of this again an 
 anticlinal fold, which after swinging from an east-west to a south- 
 easterly direction, appears to change still more. Mil it enters the 
 Pahroc Range with a north-south trend and constitutes the chief fold 
 of these mountains. 

In general, therefore, the Egan Range consists of open and sym- 
 metrical anticlines and synclines, with the rocks rarely dipping more 
 than 30°. In general these folds trend more easterly than the general 
 trend of the mountains, and thus a number of succeeding folds are 
 exposed. 

FAULTING. 

In the southern part of the range several deep transverse valleys 
 suggest fault lines, but the examination was too hasty to be sure of 
 their existence. 

ORES. 

At Mineral City, just west of Ely, lead, silver, and gold, with son>e 
 copper, are obtained. At this locality'' a number of siliceous dikes cut 
 up through the limestone, and seem to be connected with the miner- 
 alization. In the neighborhood of Elj^ there are considerable ore 
 deposits. At Cherry Creek also the dikes have perhaps brought about 
 the deposition of the minerals. Some of the ore deposits here run 
 comparatively high in gold and silver. 

LONG VALLEY RANGE. 

Long Valley Range consists of low limestone mountains. Its south- 
 ern end, just east of Hamilton, is united with the White Pine Range 
 bj^ a series of connecting north-south parallel ridges. On the north 
 it extends up into the area of the Fortieth Parallel surveys, where it 
 is represented by a series of detached low limestone mountains and 
 finally dies out in the valley.
