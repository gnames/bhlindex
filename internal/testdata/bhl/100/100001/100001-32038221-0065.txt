SPURR.] LONG VALLEY EANGE. 55 

TOPOGRAPHY. 

The Long Valley Range consists in general of a single main ridge, 
 on both sides of which the ascent from the base is comparatively 
 gentle. The interrupted form of the northern end of the range, 
 resulting in detached clumps of hills, has probably been brought 
 about b}^ erosion, which has cut deep into the ridge and formed val- 
 lej's which were afterwards filled up with detrital material, on a level 
 with that of the main valleys between the ranges. On the eastern 
 side of the south end of the range a great flood of andesitic lava has 
 filled a former valley to a height equal in general to that of the pre- 
 existing ridges. 

This andesite itself has been considerably eroded. The valleys 
 which have been cut in it, being younger than the main vallej^ into 
 which the lava was poured, are instructive as to the manner of the 
 formation of desert valleys in general and their filling up with detrital 
 accumulations. Each of these narrow valleys in the lava, often only 
 a few hundred feet wide, presents in a small way all the character- 
 is|-ics of the larger valleys which separate the ranges. In the middle 
 is a flat sage-brush plain, and on the sides long gentle slo]3es of wash 
 proceed from the gullies which cut up the adjoining ridges. In these 
 deposits of the smaller valleys, as in those of the larger valley, there 
 is no trace of deposition in the presence of water, but the vallej^s 
 have filled up evenly and smoothly with dry material, distributed 
 perhaps in part by rivulets and by wind storms. 

SEDIMENTARY ROCKS. 
 CARBONIFEROUS. 

At the south end of the range a section was followed along a portion 
 of the road between Hamilton and Ely. The rock hei^e is a limestone, 
 often cherty or aphanitic. Under the microscope the chert shows 
 cross sections of organic forms. The western edge of the section 
 yielded the following Upper Carboniferous fossils, which were deter- 
 mined by Dr. Girty: 

Marginifera imiricata? 
 Productus prattenianus. 
 Prodtictus inflatus? 

Farther east the following Upper Carboniferous fossils were col- 
 lected from the same limestone at a horizon several hundred feet 
 higher than the above : 

Fenestella? sp, 
 Campophyllum torquium? 
 Productus prattenianus. 
 Fusulina cylindrica. 
 Rhombopora lepidodendroides. 
 Fistulipora? sp. 
 Productus semireticulatus.
