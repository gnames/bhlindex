56 GEOLOGY OF NEVADA SOUTH OF 40TH PARALLEL, [bull.208. 

Only about 1,000 feet of strata are exposed in this section, owino- to 
 the low dip of the rocks. 

On the north end of the range the separated groups of low moun- 
 tains above mentioned appear to be almost entirelj' composed of Car- 
 boniferous limestone. They are so shown on the maps of the 
 Fortieth Parallel Survey. Tlie writer collected two lots of Upper 
 Carboniferous fossils at the northern end of the limestone mountain 
 which lies just east of Franklin Lake and the northern end of Ruby 
 Lake. This is ]3ractically the northern terminus of the Long Valley 
 Range, although in the Fortieth Parallel maps it is given under the 
 head of the Ruby Group of Mountains. 

According to Dr. Girtj^'s determination, the first locality yielded 
 Marginifera splendens ? 

The second locality afforded the following: 

Chonetes flemingi. 
 Productus subliori-idus. 
 ProdiTcttis mi-iltistriatus. 
 Spirifer cameratus? 
 Spiriferina pulchra. 
 Semintila mira. 

South of the lava area which fills the vallej^ between the Long Val- 
 ley Range and the Egan Range, on the road from Hamilton to Ely, 
 there is a narrow spur of mountains running from the neighborliood 
 of Summit stage station to the Egan Range, south of Ely. This may 
 be considered as an outlying spur of the Egan Range, but yet may 
 extend beneath the lava and so form a connection with the Long 
 Valley Range. From the rocks of this spur at a point just south of 
 Summit station a Devonian coral was obtained. Farther south in the 
 same ridge are Carboniferous fossils, as described under the head of 
 the Egan Range (see p. 51).

LAVAS. 

The great mass of lava .Avhicli flanks the eastern side of th^ Long 
 Valley Range proper at its lower end has alread}^ been mentioned. 
 The extent of this patch of lava to the north is uncertain, but prob- 
 ably is not more than 10 or 15 miles. To the south it passes under 
 the Pleistocene accumulations of Sierra Valley, while to the east 
 and to the west it abuts against the limestones of the Egan and the 
 Long Valley ranges. As noted above, this lava has been considerably 
 eroded. Thin sections of the rock show it to be in general a dacite- 
 andesite, the prevalent type being a dacite containing augite, biotite, 
 and hornblende. 

STRUCTURE. 

FOLDING. 

A section taken at the southern end of the range shows a mono- 
 clinal structure for the main ridge. In reality, however, this is the
