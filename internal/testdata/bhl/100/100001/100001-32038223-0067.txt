east side of an anticline whose axis lies in a narrow valley to the west 
 of the main ridge and wiiose easterly limb is exposed in the next ridge 
 to the west (see fig. 1, p. 66). 

The spnr of Devonian-Carboniferons rocks described on page 56 is 
 separated from the main ridge by Pleistocene deposits and by lava, 
 and the structural connection is not shown, but in itself it exhibits a 
 series of somewhat closely compressed regular open folds with north- 
 south strike, changing to a northwest-southeast strike as the si3ur 
 approaches the Egan Range. In this minor ridge there is exjjosed, 
 beginning with the most westerly fold, an anticline, a syncline, a sec- 
 ond anticline, and a second s^yncline. 

For the main ridge of the Long Valley Range the general strike is 
 seen to be parallel to the general trend of the mountains; that is, a 
 little east of north. At the north end of the range, at the fossil local- 
 ities, a slight syncline with a general north-south strike was observed 
 in the Carboniferous limestone. 

GOLDEN GATE RANGE. 

The Golden Gate Range scarcely deserves a separate name, on 
 account of its comparative insignificance. This name is applied to 
 a connected series of low mountains which lies to the east of the 
 Grant Range, and properly has a north-south extent of not more than 
 25 miles, with an average width of 3 or 4 miles. On the south the 
 Golden Gate Range is connected by low hills with the northern exten- 
 sion of the Hiko Range, while on the north the range dies awa}^ into 
 the Sierra Valley. Twentj^-five miles north of the north end of the 
 range there is a chain of low hills running north and south and lying 
 midway between the White Pine Range and the Egan Range. These 
 hills might perhaps be considered as the northern continuation of the 
 Golden Gate Range, the intervening portion being covered up by the 
 Pleistocene accumulations of Sierra Valley. 

TOPOGRAPHY. 

The mountains which make up the Golden Gate Range are entirely 
 detached from one another, and are separated by narrow stretches 
 of Pleistocene valley deposits, on a general level with the vallej^s on 
 both sides of the range. The separate groups are sometimes composed 
 of stratified rocks and sometimes of lava. The hills of stratified rock 
 are scarped along the axes of anticlinal folds. They are therefore 
 scarped on both sides Avhen they are synclinal, while when they are 
 anticlinal the}' have in general smooth sides with a sharp downcutting 
 in the center. The groups which are composed of volcanic rocks have 
 naturally a milder and more uniform topography.
