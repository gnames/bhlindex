esting- section of Silurian rocks. The beds here striliie N. 35° W. and 
 dip 30° NE. At the base of the section is 300 feet of thin-bedded, 
 somewhat fetid limestone and limy shale. Above comes 250 feet of 
 white vitreous quartzite, which is undoubtedly the Eureka formation. 
 Above this comes about 800 feet of comparatively massive brownish 
 limestone (the Lone Mountain formation). At a point about 150 
 feet below the bottom of the Eureka quartzite, in the Pogonip lime- 
 stone, Ordovician fossils were found. They have been determined by 
 Dr. Girtj^ as follows: 

Ortliis perveta. 
 Maclurea sp. 
 Murchisonia sp. 
 Pleurotomaria sp. 
 Leperditia bivia. 
 lUaeniTS sp. 
 Trilobites undet. 

DEVONIAN. 

Southwest from this butte and about 10 miles distant is a consider- 
 able clump of hills, which forms one of the chief features of the range. 
 A section of about 2,000 feet of limestone is here exposed. The lower 
 1,000 feet is of limestone, which in places has the peculiarity of 
 weathering brown and craggy, like quartzite. The upper 1,000 feet is 
 composed of shale and thin-bedded limestone. In the lower limestone, 
 where it was examined, the rocks are chiefly composed of corals and 
 constitute, therefore, part of a Devonian coral reef. The same reef, 
 with the same corals, was found in the ridges which form the southern 
 continuation of the Egan Range, 12 or 15 miles east of here. The 
 following Devonian fossils were identified by Dr. Girty: 

Amphipora? sp. 
 Stromatoporoid coral. 
 Indeterminable gasteropod. 

PLEISTOCENE. 

As before noted, the hills of the Golden Gate Range are surrounded 
 and often separated by accumulations of Pleistocene material. This 
 material is generally angular and bears the marks of having been 
 brought to its present position by the influence of rains, wind, and 
 gravity, not by stream or lake action. Probably this Pleistocene 
 forms a veneer over underlying Tertiary deposits, as is the case in 
 the next valley to the west — Railroad Valley. 

In the neighborhood of the Silurian butte above mentioned is an 
 extensive deposit of calcareous hot spring tufa, covering apparently 
 an area of several square miles and eroded into hills and bluffs in 
 places 40 feet high. Within this area active hot springs are plentiful. 

IGNEOUS ROCKS. 

Several of the eminences of the Golden Gate Range are composed 
 of volcanic rocks, which also surround some of the hills of stratified
