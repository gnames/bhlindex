rocks and apparently extend to the east to the southern end of the 
 Egau Range, as represented on the map. A specimen of the lava 
 from the north end of the Golden Gate Range proved to be quartz-latite. 

STRUCTURE. 

FOLDING. 

In the stratified rocks of the Golden Gate Range the strike runs 
 diagonally or transversely to the general trend of the mountains. It 
 has been noted how in the southern part of the Schell Creek and Egan 
 ranges the folds have northeast and southwest axes, which are diag- 
 onal to the general trend of these ranges. In the Pahroc Range the 
 trend of the axes of folding seems to be north and south, parallel with 
 the mountains. Between the Pahroc and the Egan ranges there is an 
 area containing a number of minor cross folds, which have a curving 
 axis and which extend to and connect with the folds of the Golden 
 Gate Range. Several of these minor folds seem to die out just west 
 of the Golden Gate Range. 

The anticlinal fold which marks the rocks of the northernmost and 
 chief group of hills of the range in which the Devonian corals were 
 found may be a continuation of a possible broader anticlinal axis 
 running between the Worthington Mountains and the northern end 
 of the Hiko Range. The folds of the Golden Gate Range lying south 
 of this anticline, comprising two more anticlines with intervening 
 synclines, do not have any visible relation to the folds to the west or 
 south. However, they raay be traced continuously to the east across 
 the several ridges which mark the southern end of the Egan Range. 
 The southernmost folds curve around southeasterly toward the Pah- 
 roc Range, while the northerly ones, diverging from the others, main- 
 tain a northeasterly direction. 

FAULTING. 

In the neighborhood of the Silurian butte above mentioned the 
 abundance of hot springs suggests the presence of faults, but this 
 could not be established. 

HUMBOLDT RANGE. 

The Humboldt Range is the most important mountain ridge in the 
 Great Basin between the Wasatch and the Sierra Nevada. Its south- 
 ern end only was visited by the writer, and as this has already been 
 mapped and explored by the geologists of the Fortieth Parallel Sur- 
 vey, it is unnecessary here to go into details. But inasmuch as the 
 writer collected fossils in localities from which none had been reported, 
 it is thought advisable to insert this short description. 

TOPOGRAPHY. 

North of Fremont Pass the Humboldt Range is exceedingly rugged 
 and precipitous. South of the pass the mountains become lower.
