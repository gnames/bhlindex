60 GEOLOGY OF KEYADA SOtJTH OF 40TH PARALLEL, [bull. 208. 

At Hastings Pass tliey are of only moderate height, and the ascent from 
 the base on both sides to the summit is not precipitous. South of 
 Hastings Pass the mountains are still lower, and pass into straggling 
 groups which connect with the northern extension of the White Pine 
 Range. 

SEDIMENTARY ROCKS. 

North of Fremont Pass the Humboldt Range consists mainlj^ of 
 Archean rocks, as has been described by King'' and Hague. ^ These 
 rocks consist of a series of gneisses and schists overlying the basal 
 granite and having a thickness of 8,000 or 10,000 feet. Of this series 
 the lower 5,000 feet is in general a mica-gneiss, while the upper 5,000 
 feet is a hornblendic and dioritic schist, containing veins of quartzite. 
 At the top are beds of limestone and quartzite. Above this gneiss 
 and schist series comes a series of quartzites about 2,000 feet thick. 
 The quartzites are white or yellow-brown in color and contain sec- 
 ondary garnet, hornblende, actinolite, muscovite, biotite, and iron 
 oxide. On them rest unconformably the Paleozoic strata, with the 
 Devonian generally at the base and the Carboniferous above. 

King notes the resemblance of the quartzite series (which lies 
 unconformably beneath the Paleozoic beds) to similar rocks in the 
 Wasatch Mountains. It is possible also that the thick white and 
 brown Cambrian quartzites exposed in the Snake Range, especiallj'^ 
 in the vicinity of Jeff Davis or Wheeler Peak, may be equivalents of 
 the Humboldt quartzite. 

South of Fremont Pass the eastern face of the range is composed of 
 easterly or southeasterly dipping limestones. At a i3oint not more 
 than 4 miles south of the pass the. following Coal Measures fossils were 
 collected by the writer from a butte at the base of the mountains. 
 They were determined by Dr. Girty as follows : 

Fisttilipora sp. 
 Campophyllum torquiiim? 
 Lophophyllnm proliferain. 
 Rhipidomella pecosi. 
 ProcUictiTS sp. 
 Spirifer camerattis. 

These same limestones continue all along the east face of the range 
 as far as Hastings Pass. On the summit of the pass is found a con- 
 siderable thickness of sandstones mixed Avith fine conglomerates. 
 These the Fortieth Parallel geologists regarded as Devonian of the 
 Ogden formation, which would correspond to the Diamond Peak 
 quartzite of the Eureka section. A short distance west of the summit 
 the Paleozoic rocks are overlain unconformably by thick deposits 
 belonging to the Humboldt Pliocene of the Fortieth Parallel Survey. 
 At the upper edge of the Pliocene deposits the material consists of
