large angular fragments of limestone. From some of the largest of 
 these fragments fossils were obtained which were determined by 
 Professor Ulricli as Ordovieian.

If Silurian rocks exist in place at this point one may well snppose 
 that they are exposed by means of a fanlt, for otherwise the thick- 
 ness of strata in the mountains seems hardly sufficient to account for 
 their appearance. 

IGNEOUS EOCKS. 

North of Fremont Pass the basal rock appears to be mica-granite, as 
 described by King.<* South of Hastings Pass a considerable area is 
 also represented as granite in the Fortieth Parallel maps. 

STRUCTURE. 
 FOLDING. 

The general structure of the Humboldt Range is a broad anticline, 
 as has been mentioned by King^ and by Hague,'^ and as can be seen 
 by an inspection of the maps of the Fortieth Parallel. 

FAULTING. 

It appeared to the Avriter that Fremont Pass is the line of an east- 
 west fault, and that this explains the abutting of the Paleozoic rocks 
 on the south against the granite and Archean on the north. More- 
 over, the above-mentioned Paleozoic rocks are sharpl}' turned up 
 along this supposed fault line, so that they dip steeply, and their 
 strike swings round from the normal north-south direction to a 
 northeasterly one, so as to be nearly parallel with the supposed fault. 

The possible existence of a fault along the west side of Hastings 
 Pass exposing the Silurian rocks has been mentioned above. 

WHITE PINE RANGE. 

The White Pine Range, as here described, is the southern continu- 
 ation of the Humboldt Range, and its northern end begins about 10 
 miles south of Hastings Pass, in that range. From this point it 
 extends unbroken southward for 100 miles, with a general due north- 
 south trend. At its southern end it is continuous with the short 
 Grant Range, which topographically and geologically is a part of it, 
 but which is differently named and will be described separately.
