SILURIAN. 

On the road which runs east from Osceola there was observed a 
 hard Avhite quartzite about 400 feet thick, which was recognized in 
 the field as similar in every respect to the Silurian Eureka quartzite 
 of the Eureka section. 

Northeast of this locality, about 4 miles north of Robinson's 
 ranch (PI. IV, A), a compact conglomerate, which Avill presently be 
 described as probabl}' Mesozoic or T(U"tiary, contains large quanti- 
 ties of similar white quartzite, together with limestone fragments. 
 From some of the limestone fragments the following Ordovician 
 (Lower Silurian) fossils were obtained and identified by Prof, E. O. 
 Ulrich: 

L'eperditia fabtilites Conrad, variety. 
 Isoclillina, sp. iindet. 
 Lophospira. sp. cf. L. bicincta Hall. 
 Fragments of an Orthis near Tricenaria. 

These conglomerates pass laterally into limestones and white 
 Quartzites, whence they are derived. The Leperditia above men- 
 tioned is found in the Pogonip terrane at Eureka, so that the lime- 
 stone here is very likely of the same horizon. This also strengthens 
 the previous tentative assignment of the quartzite to the Silurian. 

Eight miles northeast of Osceola, in the center of the range, Mr. 
 F. B. Weeks « observed, overlying Cambrian limestones, a different 
 series of purple, drab, and white limestones, in which the following 
 Ordovician fossils were found (determined by Professor Ulrich) : 

Fragments of crinold column.s. 

Orthis (cf. lonensis and holstoni). 

Dalmanella (cf. testudinaria) . 

Dalmanella (cf . emacerata) . 

Dalmanella (cf. perveta and pogonipensis).
