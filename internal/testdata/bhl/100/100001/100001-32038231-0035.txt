imen of the limestone examiued aj)pe<ired to contain indistinct traces 
 of organic forms, but was thoroughly recrystallized. 

At the southeastern end of the Kern Mountains the same highly 
 altered limestone Avas found. Farther northwest, toward the heart of 
 the mountains, this is underlain bj^ highl}^ altered quartzite-schists 
 with an intercalated band of marble similar to the section described 
 farther south. The schist is cut by numerous dikes of siliceous granitic 
 rock, as above described. Thin sections of the schist examined 
 proved that it Avas originally quartzite, but the more metamorphosed 
 specimens showed the dcA^elopment of biotite and muscovite along 
 sliding planes, producing a muscovite-biotite-quartzite-schist. 

In the mountains on the north side of Pleasant Valley Mr. Howell"' 
 has noted that the range is composed of quartzite overlying granite 
 and itself overlain by limestone. He also notes that there is fre- 
 quently a little shale between the limestone and the quartzite. At 
 Uiyabi Pass he estimated the limestone at from 3,000 to 5,000 feet. 
 He found there onl}^ from 200 to 400 feet of quartzite between the 
 granite and the limestone. 

Along the nortli side of Pleasant Valley, at the base of the Deep 
 Creek Mountains, the writer noted the continuation of the altered 
 limestones that overlie the quartzites and shales of the Kern Moun- 
 tains. This limestone was traced nortliAvestward to the gap though 
 which the road runs northward to Deep Creek. Immediately west 
 of here it is replaced by less altered limestone carrying Coal Meas- 
 ures fossils. 

We have, therefore, extending nearly the whole length of the 
 Snake Range, for 100 miles at least, a heavy quartzite resting upon a 
 basement of granite and overlain by slates, which in turn are overlain 
 by massive metamorphic limestones. The thickness of the quartzite 
 in the neighborhood of Osceola was estimated at not less than 2,500 
 feet, while Mr. Howell found only 200 or 400 feet at the northern end 
 of the Deep Creek Range. The thickness of the overljdng shales or 
 slates seems to be likewise small at the northern end of the range, 
 while in the neighborhood of Osceola it is considerable, and was 
 roughly estimated by the writer, partly by comparison with the 
 adjacent Schell Creek Range section, to be 4,000 to 5,000 feet. The 
 thickness of the massive limestones above was estimated by Mr. 
 Howell at Wheeler Peak at from 4,000 to 5,000 feet; by the Avriter, at a 
 point some distance farther north, at about 5,000 feet; and by Mr, 
 Howell at Uiyabi Pass at from 3,000 to 5,000 feet. But at the latter 
 locality Howell found Carboniferous fossils, so that at least the upper 
 part of the limestone here can not be included with the Cambrian. 

The whole section corresponds in its chief features to the Cambrian 
 section of the Schell Creek Range, the Highland Range, and the section 
 at Eureka, and the Cambrian fossils found in the shale horizon above
