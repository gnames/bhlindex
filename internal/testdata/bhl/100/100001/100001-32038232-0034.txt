distance farther east the slates are underlain by 300 feet of brown 
 quartzite like that at Osceola, below which comes 600 feet of gray 
 quartzite. 

The following observations have been directly communicated to the 
 writer by Mr. F. B. Weeks, who made an extended trip in the Great 
 Basin region in the summer of 1900: 

A few hundred feet below the summit of the ridge south of Osceola fossils were 
 found in the limestone and have been determined by Mr. Walcott as Lower 
 Cambrian. 

About 8 miles northeast of Osceola the center of the range is occupied by hard 
 and massive drab and blue limestones, in which fossils collected at two localities 
 have been determined by Mr. Walcott to be Middle Cambrian forms. These Cam- 
 brian limestones are succeeded by Ordovician limestones. 

We have, then, in the neighborhood of Osceola a section of sedimen- 
 tary rocks resting upon the basal granite and consisting of at least 2,500 
 feet of quartzites, succeeded by a thickness of silvery, somewhat 
 micaceous slates of uncertain but iDrobably considerable thickness, 
 and these by at least a thousand feet of metamorphic limestones. 
 The section is identical with that just west of here, in the Schell Creek 
 Range. 

About 20 to 25 miles south of Wheeler Peak Cambrian limestones, 
 overlain by Ordovician limestones, Avere also observed by Mr. Weeks. 

All along the eastern side of the Snake Range, north of Wheeler 
 Peak, is found the same section, although the overlying silvery slates 
 often become more quartzitic and pass into quartzite-schists. Just 
 north of the east- west gap crossing the range north of Wheeler Peak 
 a series of 2,500 to 3,000 feet of craggy-weathering brown or black 
 considerably altered limestones, reticulated by many veins and highly 
 jointed, was gone through. In this limestone no fossils were seen, but 
 above it is found limestone with Coal Measures fossils. The lower 
 limestone is believed to be in part Cambrian, for below it was found a 
 belt of about 200 feet of black shale, in which a number of fossils 
 were collected, which were determined by Mr. C. D. Walcott to be 
 Cambrian. Below this shale comes a peculiar 50-foot bed of white 
 marble, banded with gray, and beneath this upward of 1,500 feet of 
 highly schistose quartzite, producing the effect of a silvery slate. 

From here north to the transverse gap which cuts across the range 
 south of the so-called Kern Mountains, one finds almost continuously 
 the same quartzite-schists at the bottom of the section, sometimes 
 nearly approaching the condition of a mica-schist. Above this come 
 heavy bedded limestones, which weather brown, and which carry 
 indistinct and indeterminable fossil remains. Midway between the 
 northern end of the main portion of the Snake Range, south of the 
 Kern Mountains, and the Kern Mountains themselves, the same 
 metamorphic limestone was found in a butte. 

From observations all along this face of the range the thickness of 
 the metamorphic limestone was estimated at about 5,000 feet. A spec-
