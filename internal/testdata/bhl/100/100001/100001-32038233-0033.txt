granitic rock is locally intrusive into the Cambrian strata, and the 
 same has been suspected in other places. From the fact, however, 
 that the intrusive phenomena are of minor importance, and also from 
 the circumstance that where the Cambrian quartzite is schistose the 
 underlying granite also shows signs of movement, the writer inclines 
 to the belief that the granite as a whole is really Archean and is the 
 basement upon which the Cambrian quartzites were laid down. So 
 thick a series of quartzites (amounting to several thousand feet) 
 naturally suggests a granitic land mass as their source. As regards 
 the occasional intrusive phenomena, it is possible that these represent 
 occasional outbursts of molten rock which found its way from the 
 lower and more heated regions up through the crust of hard Archean 
 granite and into the overljdng Cambrian, being intrusive into the 
 Upper Archean as well as into the quartzites, although belonging prac- 
 ticallj" to the same body as the basement granite. The writer would 
 suggest that this explanation may ]Dossibly apply to Big Cottonwood 
 Canj^on, in the Wasatch, near Salt Lake City, where the granite was 
 originally believed to be Archean, but where later observers have 
 noted intrusive phenomena.*

In the southern part of the range, at Wheeler Peak, there are heavy 
 quartzites dipping in all directions, forming a gentle quaquaversal. 
 Howell^ notes the same quartzites for some distance south of the iDeak, 
 overlain by heavj^ bluish-gray limestones. He estimates the lime- 
 stones as 4,000 to 5,000 feet thick, and the underlying quartzite at 
 not less than 1,000 feet. 

North of Wheeler Peak, at the mining camp at Osceola, the writer 
 observed these quartzites, and found on the mountain just south of 
 the camp about 500 feet of pure white quartzite underlain by about 
 2,000 feet of massive gray quartzite, with some silvery slate. At 
 Osceola there is an east-west fault which brings together a massive 
 brown craggy- weathering quartzite on the north side and the silvery 
 slate with quartzite bands on the south: Above the quartzite, one mile 
 east of Osceola, there is a high bluff of dark-blue frosty lustered silice- 
 ous limestone with indistinct, probably organic, markings, similar to 
 the limestones just west of here, in the Schell Creek Range. About a 
 mile farther east the slight westerly dip of the limestones brings up 
 the same underlying silvery slates as were noted in the neighborhood 
 of Osceola and also in the Schell Creek section at the same horizon. 
 The limestones in the neighborhood of Osceola were estimated at 
 1,000 feet thick, while the slates, as exposed in the Schell Creek sec- 
 tion, were roughly estimated at from 4,000 to 5,000 feet. A short
