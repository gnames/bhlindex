a spring flowing in the bottom of a magnificent narrow canyon, 
 bounded by perpendicular walls 2,000 or 2,500 feet high. In these 
 walls are a number of large holes or caves in the limestones, which 
 evidently represent the former courses of the same spring that now 
 emerges in the gulch bottom. From the distribution of these caves it 
 appears that the spring has been flowing during all the time that the 
 canyon has been eroding and that its former underground courses 
 have been exposed by the down cutting. The adjacent gulches, which 
 do not continually contain running water, have V-shaped valleys with- 
 out box canyons, and are much shallower. 
 In this canyon are small working mines. 

ARCHEAN ROCKS. 

Howell found fragments of granite in the wash which came down 
 from Wheeler Peak, and regarded this as Archean, underlying the 
 undoubtedly Cambrian quartzite. Farther north, on the east face of 
 the mountain, and on the north side of the gap which runs trans- 
 versely across the range north of Wheeler Peak,- the writer found 
 abundant schistose granite in the drift and in one locality in place. 
 Where it was found in place it seemed to lie beneath limestones which 
 are probably Cambrian, with no intervening quartzite. Farther 
 north, also on the eastern side of the range, one finds continually 
 huge blocks of schistose granite mingled with the blocks of schistose 
 Cambrian quartzite. Upon the north side of the Kern Mountains 
 granite is found in contact with the schistose Cambrian quartzite and 
 also with the overlying metamorphic limestones. The central portion 
 of the Kern Mountains is made up of this granite, with the Cambrian 
 rocks on the flanks. A sjpecimen examined microscopically proved to 
 be a biotite-muscovite-granite, approaching alaskite. On the borders 
 of the granitic mass are found siliceous granitic dikes, which cut the 
 Cambrian quartzite-schists. At one locality, which is on the south- 
 west side of Pleasant Valley and near the State line, is found a broad 
 belt of confused alaskite dikes showing a tendency to change into a 
 muscovite-biotite-granite on the one hand and into large quartz veins 
 on the other. 

Howell'* notes that at the head of Deep Creek, only a few miles 
 north of Pleasant Valley, the erosion of the creek has laid bare gran- 
 ite underlying the quartzite and limestone. From here northward to 
 Uiyabi Pass, not far from the northern end of the range, he notes 
 that the base of the range is granite, overlain and flanked on the 
 west by quartzite and limestone. 

From these evidences it would seem that the limestones and over- 
 lying quartzites which form the base of the stratifled series in the 
 Snake Range, and which will be presently shown to be Cambrian, are 
 ordinarily underlain by granite. But in at least one locality similar
