SNAKE RANGE. 

The Snake Range lies next east of the Schell Creek Range and for 
 the most part just west of the Nevada-Utah line. It is the most 
 eonspicnous range between the Wasatch and the Humboldt. The 
 northern end of the range has been variously called the Deep Creek 
 Mountains or the Ibenpah Mountains, while just south of this part of 
 the range a transverse ridge has been called the Kern Mountains; but 
 here they will all be included under the general name Snake Range. 
 The range, as thus defined, extends from about latitude 40Â° 15' about 
 135 miles in a direction a little west of south. At its southern end it 
 runs into a group of irregular mountains, probably in large part vol- 
 canic, of which certain portions go by the name of the Cedar Moun- 
 tains, and the Piiion Mountains of Lincoln County. 

TOPOGRAPHY. 

The relief of the Snake Range is in general great. The mountains 
 are divided into irregular ridges which are broken and separated by 
 transverse east- west gaps. Bj^ two such gaps the so-called Kern 
 Mountains are separated from the rest of the range, and a similar but 
 lower gap occurs just north of Wheeler or Jeff Davis Peak. This 
 peak has the highest elevation of any between the Sierra Nevada and 
 the Wasatch, attaining over 12,000 feet (PI. HI, A). Directly south 
 of this the mountains decrease rapidlj' in height and pass into the low 
 volcanic peaks above mentioned. 

Some of the erosion forms are interesting. On the east side of the 
 range, between Wheeler Peak and the Kern Mountains, a number of 
 springs furnish continual streams. At the mouths of the gulches 
 from which such streams flow the Pleistocene wash which covers the 
 base of the mountains has been lowered fully 500 feet below the wash 
 on both sides, and the stream flows through this deposit between 
 steep banks 40 feet high. Where near-by gulches which do not con- 
 tain any continual streams join the same detrital apron, the reverse 
 is the case, the gulches being fronted by huge alluvial fans higher 
 than the rest of the i)lateau. 

Considering the gulches formed b}^ these continual streams and 
 comparing them with the neighboring gulches which do not contain 
 springs, we find a strong contrast. Smith Creek, for examj)le, is
