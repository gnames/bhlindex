uppermost of the lithologic divisions of the Devonian in the Eureka 
 district. It consists of 2,000 feet of black argillaceous shales, more 
 or less arenaceous, with intercalations of red and reddish-brown friable 
 sandstone, changing rapidly with the locality. The beds contain 
 plant impressions. The formation is underlain by the Devonian 
 Nevada limestone and overlain by the Carboniferous Diamond Peak 
 quartzite. These lithologic subdivisions seem to change rapidly as 
 one goes away from the Eureka district, and have not often been 
 certainly identified.
