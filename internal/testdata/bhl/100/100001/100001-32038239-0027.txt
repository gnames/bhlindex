Unkar formation. — This has alreadj- been mentioned, under the 
 headings Grand Canyon and Chuar, as the lowest division of the 
 Grand Canyon group of the Algonkian in the Grand Canyon section. 
 It is overlain conformably by the Chuar, and separated below by a 
 great unconformity from the Vishnu series. 

Wasatch limestone. — The term was applied by King" to an enor- 
 mous bodj^ of limestone seen in the Wasatch and farther west, but 
 not to the east. He describes it as a single body of limestone about 
 7,000 feet in thickness, holding its enormous volume with remarkable 
 evenness wherever observed over Utah and Nevada. It is underlain 
 by the Ogden quartzite, from which it is lithologically sharply distin- 
 guished. Above, it passes into the great Weber quartzite, but there 
 is an alternation of sandstone and limestone beds at this transition 
 and the thickness of these intercalated beds is very variable, reach- 
 ing sometimes about 1,000 feet. 

The lower 1,400 feet of the Wasatch limestone was regarded as 
 Devonian. Above this is 300 or 400 feet of dark, heavy limestones 
 carrying fossils resembling those of the Waverly group, but which 
 perhaps are closer to the Devonian. Directly above these are 400 or 
 500 feet of dark beds carrying Lower Carboniferous fauna, and above 
 these the upper 4,500 feet of the limestone is characterized by abun- 
 dant Coal Measures fossils. 

The term Wasatch was not retained in the Eureka section,^ the 
 Devonian and Carboniferous being subdivided into various forma- 
 tions. However, these lithologic subdivisions are not readily recog- 
 nizable at many other points in Nevada, and the old term is often 
 convenient. 

Weber conglomerate. — Mr. King^ described the Weber quartzite as 
 a body of indurated sandstone and quartzite carrying occasional 
 sheets of conglomerate, interposed between two bodies of Coal Meas- 
 ures limestone. He described .it as obtaining a thickness of 2,000 feet 
 in the Wasatch, 8,000 feet in the Oquirrh, and probably more in 
 middle California. This formation overlies the Wasatch limestone 
 and underlies the Upper Coal Measures limestone. 

The same formation was recognized by Mr, Hague ^^ at Eureka, 
 where it is underlain by the Lower Coal Measures limestone and over- 
 lain by the Upper Coal Measures limestone. Its thickness at Eureka, 
 however, is only 2,000 feet. Here it consists of coarse and fine con- 
 glomerates, with angular fragments of chert and layers of reddish- 
 yellow sandstone. 

White Pine shale. — This term was a^jplied by Mr. Hague '^ to the
