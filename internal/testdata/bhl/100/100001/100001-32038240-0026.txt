22 GEOLOGY OF NEVADA SOUTH OF 40TH PARALLEL, [bull.208. 

fossils were obtained just below the middle of the series, and were 
 doubtfully referred to the Lower Carboniferous. 

Secret Canyon shale. — This name was applied bj'- Mr. Hague « to 
 a division of the Cambrian in the Eureka district overlying the 
 Prospect Mountain limestone and underlying the Hambiirg lime- 
 stone. It consists of 1,G00 feet of yellow and gray argillaceous 
 shales, passing into shaly limestone. This formation is characterized 
 by a fauna that may be referred to the upper portion of the Middle 
 Cambrian. 

Star Peak formation. — This name was applied by Mr. King'' to the 
 uppermost of the two great divisions of the Triassic of western 
 Nevada. The series consists of 10,000 feet of strata, made up of an 
 alternation of three great limestone zones and three interposed quartz- 
 ite zones. The upper two quartzites represent moderately pure sili- 
 ceous sediment, while the lower quartzite closely follows the physical 
 and chemical peculiarities of the underlying Triassic Koipato series. 
 The fossils of these limestones are marvelously like the St. Cassian 
 and Hallstadt of the Austrian Alps. Directly overlying the upper- 
 most Star Peak quartzite is a limestone carrying Lower Jurassic or 
 Liassic forms, and succeeded upward by an immense series of argil- 
 lites of unknown thickness. 

Tonto shale and sandstone. — The name Tonto was applied by Mr. 
 G. K. Gilbert « in 1874 to a series of sandstones and shales lying 
 l3etween the subjacent granite and the superjacent limestones wJiich 
 occur at the mouth of the Grand Canyon in Arizona. He considers 
 the formation of Primordial age, and it has been since found to con- 
 tain an Upper Cambrian fauna. ^ 

Truckee formation. — Mr. King« proposed the name Pah-Ute Lake 
 for a fresh-water Miocene lake, which is regarded as extending from 
 the region of the Columbia River, and perhaps still farther north, far 
 south through Oregon and Nevada into California. To the beds of 
 this lake in the fortieth parallel area lie gave the name of Truckee 
 Miocene. They are made up of 150 feet or less of detrital rocks and 
 gritty sandstones, with some conglomerate. Above these lie about 
 250 feet of palagonite tuff. Above this is 250 to 300 feet and more of 
 infusorial silica, followed by 120 feet of detrital sandy rocks, contain- 
 ing also infusorial silica. Above these comes 60 feet of fresh-water 
 limestone, which is succeeded upward by 250 feet of detrital grits; 
 and the latter give away to an enormous formation of volcanic tuffs. 
 In Nevada the thickness of these volcanic muds is 2,000 or 3,000 feet; 
 in Oregon it is even more.
