about the middle of the qnartzite is a thin bed of white, slightly silice- 
 ous marble. No fossils were found in this formation, but it was 
 referred to the Devonian, since it was found to overlie the Pogonip 
 limestone, which contains Lower Helderberg fossils, and is overlain 
 by the Wasatch limestone, whose basal beds contain Upper Helder- 
 berg forms. 

Pogonip formation. — King'* described the Pogonip limestone in 
 middle Nevada, in the regions of White Pine, Eureka, Pinyon, and 
 Roberts Peak ranges, as being Cambrian in the lower half and con- 
 taining Silurian fossils in its upper 2,000 feet. In the Eureka sec- 
 tion, the term Pogonip was limited by Mr. Hague ^ to the Silurian 
 portion of the series, which consists of 2,700 feet of interstratified 
 limestone and argillites, with arenaceous beds at the base> These 
 rocks pass into pure, fine-grained limestone of a bluish-gray color, 
 distinctly bedded. They are highly fossiliferous. The Pogonip lime- 
 stone is the lowest member of the Silurian of the Eui'eka section. - It 
 overlies the topmost member of the Cambrian, the Hamburg shale, 
 conformably, and is conformably overlain by the Silurian Eureka 
 qnartzite. 

Prospect Mountain limestone and quartziie. — These names were 
 given by Mr. Hague ^ to the two lowest divisions of the Cambrian sec- 
 tion at Eureka, Nev. The Prospect Mountain qnartzite is the lowest 
 and consists of 1,500 feet of bedded brownish- white quartzites, weath- 
 ering dark brown but Avhiter near the summit. The quartzites contain 
 intercalated thin laj^ers of arenaceous shales, and are ferruginous 
 near the base. 

The qnartzite is overlain by the Prospect Mountain limestone, 
 which consists of 3,050 feet of gray, compact limestone of rather light 
 shade, traversed by thin seams of calcite. It has very imperfect bed- 
 ding iDlanes. The upper portion of the Prospect Mountain quartzites 
 is characterized by the Olenellus or Lower Cambrian fauna, and the 
 Prospect Mountain limestone by the Middle Cambrian fauna of the 
 Rocky Mountain section. 

Red Wall limestone.- — This name was applied by Messrs. Gilbert 
 and Marvine '^ to a heavy Carboniferous limestone in the Grand Can- 
 yon region. This limestone has a gray color on fresh fracture, but 
 shows a red rust on weather-stained cliffs. It is generally heavy 
 bedded to massive. At the top sandstone alternates with limestone 
 for from 200 to 500 feet. Through its lower half the limestone is 
 interrupted by occasional shaly bands. The average total thickness 
 is 2,500 feet. Fossils are abundant near the top but rare in the lower 
 part. The upper portion contains Coal Measures fossils. The lowest
