Huitiboldt series. — This name was applied by King"^' to a series of 
 loose, friable Tertiar}^ rocks, carrying very recent fresh-water niol- 
 lusks. This series is found at intervals all over the northern portion 
 of the Great Basin region, from the Sierra Nevada into Utah. Mr. 
 King regard-ed all these beds, which from their fossils were referred 
 to the late Pliocene, as lake deposits and as representing the sedi- 
 ment of a single lake out of which the numerous lofty mountain 
 masses rose in a complicated system of islands. 

Koipato formation. — This name was applied by Mr. King* to one of 
 the two chief divisions of the Triassic in western Nevada. He 
 describes the Koipato as made up of siliceous and argillaceous beds, 
 whose chemical peculiaritj^ is the almost total absence of soda and 
 lime and the high percentage of alumina and potash. This series has 
 an observable thickness of about 6,000 feet, with an unknown quan- 
 tity to be added for the unseen beds at the bottom. Tlie Koipato is 
 overlain by the Triassic Star Peak series. 

Lone Mou7itai7i limestone. — This name was given by Mr. Hague 
 to the uppermost division of the Silurian in the Eureka district. It 
 consists of 1,800 feet of strata. At the base are black gritty beds 
 passing into light-gray siliceous rocks with all traces of bedding 
 obliterated. There are Trenton fossils at the base and Halysites in 
 the upper portion. The formation is separated from the underlying 
 Silurian Eureka quartzite by an unconformity, and is overlain con- 
 formably by the Devonian Nevada limestone. 

Nevada limestone. — The Nevada limestone, as defined b^'' Mr. 
 Hague,'' is the lower member of the Devonian series at Eureka. It 
 consists of 6,000 feet of limestone. The lower horizons are indis- 
 tinctly bedded, with saccharoidal texture and gray color, passing up 
 into distinctly bedded strata, reddish brown and graj^^ in color, fre- 
 quently finely striped, ijroducing a variegated appearance. The 
 upper horizons are massive, well bedded, bluish black in color, and 
 highly fossiliferous. The Nevada limestone overlies the Silurian 
 Lone Mountain limestone at Eureka and is overlain by the Devonian 
 White Pine shale. 

Ogden quartzite. — This term was applied by King'^ to a sheet of 
 siliceous sediment, in general compacted into a quartzite. Mr. King 
 stated that this formation had a remarkable evenness over all the 
 Paleozoic area west of and including the Wasatch. In its typical 
 locality, Ogden Canyon, AVasatch Range, it was stated to be 1,200 
 or 1,400 feet thick; at Cottonwood Canyon 1,000 feet, and in middle 
 Nevada from 800 to 900 feet. In Ogden Canyon it is bounded at 
 the top and bottom b}^ thin beds of greenish-gray argillites; and
