spuRR.] DESCRIPTIONS OF FORMATIONS. 19 

Lower Coal Measures limestone, which contains intercalated beds of 
 chert and argillaceous beds near the base. The Diamond Peak quartz- 
 ite is not a persistent lithologic terrane, and is not recognizable Avith 
 confidence at any great distance from tlie Enreka section. 

Es)neralda formation. — This name was ap^jlied by Mr. 11. W. Tur- 
 ner" to Tertiary formations in the Silver Peak Range, in tlie west- 
 ern part of Nevada. These deposits consist of sandstones, shales, 
 volcanic tuffs, breccias, conglomerates, and great thicknesses of 
 lacustrine marls. Coal beds and plant remains occur; also fossil 
 shells and fish bones. From the evidence afforded b}^ these fossils, 
 the age of the beds was broadly determined as late Eocene or early 
 Miocene. 

Eureka quartzite. — This name was applied by Mr. Hague to the mid- 
 dle of the three divisions of the Silurian in the Eureka district. This 
 division here consists of 500 feet of compact vitreous quartzite, white 
 or blue in color, and j)assing into rock of reddish tints near the base, 
 with indistinct bedding. It overlies the Pogonip limestone, and is 
 separated from the overlying Silurian Lone Mountain limestone by an 
 unconformity. The Eureka quartzite appears to be one of the most 
 persistent lithologic terranes of the Nevada Paleozoic. It has been 
 recognized over a wide area. 

Grand Canyon groiqj. — The name Grand Canyon groux3 was given 
 by Ma j. J. W. Powell to the strata in the Grand Canyon region beneath 
 the Tonto sandstone and above the Grand Canyon schists. The 
 latter were referred tentatively to the Eozoic, and the 10,000 feet of 
 the Grand Canyon group to the Silurian. In 1883 Mr. C. D. Walcott 
 referred Major Powell's Grand Canyon group to the Lower Cambrian 
 and separated it into an upper and a lower division, the Grand Canyon 
 and the Chuar. In 1886 these rocks were referred bj^ Mr. Walcott to 
 the pre-Cambrian, and in 1890 to the Algonkian. In 1894 Mr. Wal- 
 cott subdivided the Grand Canyon group of the Algonkian into the 
 Chuar and the Unkar series. The Grand Canyon group is separated 
 by an unconformity from the overlying Cambrian (Tonto sandstone), 
 and by a great unconformity from the underlying Vishnu series of 
 schists. 

Hamhiirg limestone a7id shale. — The Hamburg limestone and shale 
 are the uppermost divisions of the Cambrian as defined by Mr. Hague 
 in the Eureka district, Nevada. The Hamburg shale lies at the very 
 top and consists of 350 feet of yellow argillaceous shale containing 
 layers of chert nodules, especially near the top. The underlying 
 Hamburg limestone consists of 1,200 feet of dark-gray granular lime- 
 stone, with only slight traces of bedding. The Hamburg shale is 
 characterized by well-developed Upper Cambrian fauna.*
