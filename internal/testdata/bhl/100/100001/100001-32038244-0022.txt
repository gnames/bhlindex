EXPLANATION OF FORMATION NAMES. 

The following is a brief explanation of formation names used in this 
 work. Names are arranged alphabetically. 

Aubrey limestone and sandstone. — These names were applied by 
 Messrs. Gilbert and Marvine in 1871 to formations in the Colorado 
 Canyon region. The limestone lies above the sandstone and has a 
 thickness of 820 feet on Kanab Ci-eek. At a few points in the top- 
 most layer were found a group of shells suggesting the Permo-Carbon- 
 iferous of the Mississippi Valley, indicating that the great Paleozoic 
 lithologic change at this horizon marks the absolute close of the 
 Carboniferous age. Lithologically the limestone is characterized by 
 a great abundance of chert, which toward the top sometimes consti- 
 tutes half the mass. Near the middle it is in some places interruj^ted 
 by a belt of shale with gyi)suni. 

The underlying Aubrey sandstone series has a thickness in the 
 Aubrey cliffs and along the Grand Canyon of about 1,000 feet. In 
 every exjjosu re a portion of this bod}^ is massive and cross bedded and 
 another portion soft and gypsiferous, but the order of these parts is 
 not constant. The sandstones contain no fossils, but an intercalated 
 limestone below the middle of the series at Canyon Creek bears famil- 
 iar Coal Measures shells." 

Chuar series.— This name was introduced by Mr. C. D. Walcott in 
 1883 for a part of the LoAver Cambrian of the Grand Canyon region. 
 Mr. Walcott divided the Grand Canyon group of Major Powell into a 
 lower and an upper division, the Grand Canyon and the Chuar. In 1886 
 the reference to the Lower Cambrian was changed to pre-Cambrian. 
 In 1890 these strata were referred to the Algonkian system. In 1894 
 Mr. Walcott again classified the Algonkian, dividing the Grand 
 Canj^on series of this system into the upper (Chuar) series and the 
 lower (Unkar) series. The Chuar is separated by an unconformity 
 from the overlying Cambrian (Ton to series).* 

Diamond Peak quarizite. — -This name Avas given by Mr. Hague to 
 the lowest lithologic member of the Carboniferous at Eureka, Nev. 
 At this place the Diamond Peak quartzite consists of 3,000 feet of mas- 
 sive gray and brown quartzites, with broAvn and green shales at the 
 summit. It underlies 3,800 feet of heavy bedded, dark-blue and graj^
