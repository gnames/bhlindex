SPURR] INTRODUCTION. 17 

The foregoing explauation iudicates clearly euougli the character 
 of the ma]3 aud the weight which should be placed upon it. The 
 data along the lines of reconnaissance, often obtained on forced 
 marches of 20 or 30 miles a day, are oftentimes meager and nnsatis- 
 factor3^ Between the lines of actual travel the data are still less 
 reliable, and a great deal of the mapping has been done simjply from 
 inference. Thus it is probable that anyone examining closely the 
 detail of the map will find it nearly all inaccurate, while one looking 
 for the main principles will recognize the general correctness of the 
 mapping and the value of the map as a pioneer. 

The inaccuracy of the map is unavoidably heightened by the lack 
 of a suitable topographic base. The present base has been prepared 
 in a very rough and unsatisfactory way, chiefly from the Wheeler and 
 other early surveys. It is a source of regret to the author of the bul- 
 letin that so rough a topographic map must be presented as the vehicle 
 for his geologic information. 

Within the text of the bulletin an effort has been made to give 
 clearly the known facts concerning the geology, whether obtained by 
 the writer or previousl3\ Fidl credit is given to previous work, 
 although it can not alwaj^s be given in the map compiled from this 
 information. The chief sources, however, are shown on PL II." 

The writer has judged it most advisable to confine the text to 
 descriptive matter. General results, especially those involving appli- 
 cation of theory, have been withheld or published separately. Among 
 these general results the author has published two papers on volcan- 
 ism in the Journal of Geologj^ entitled The Succession and Relation 
 of Lavas of the Great Basin Region (October-November, 1900), and 
 Transitions of Texture in certain Tertiary Igneous Rocks of the Great 
 Basin. A petrographic paper on Quartz-muscovite E'ock from Bel- 
 mont, Nev., has been published in the American Journal of Science 
 (November, 1900). A paper on the Origin and Structure of the 
 Basin Ranges was read before the Geological Society of America at 
 Albany, December, 1900. 

« After the above was written, and while the bulletin was in galley proof, new information was 
 received as a result of the studies of Messrs. Weeks and Rowe, of the U S. Geological Survey.' 
 The studies of Mr. Weeks were made in 1900; those of Mr. Rowe in 1900 and 1901, The results of 
 these have been incorporated in the bulletin.
