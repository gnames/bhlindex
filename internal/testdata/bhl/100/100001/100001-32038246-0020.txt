16 GEOLOGY OF NEVADA SOUTH OF 40TH PAKALLEL. [bull. 208. 

State was crossed a third time, by way of Indian Springs and Pali- 
 rumji Valley, into California. Funeral Range was crossed and Death 
 Valley entered at Furnace Creels:. From here the expedition went 
 southward, and, crossing the Panamint Range at Windy Gap, pro- 
 ceeded by way of Granite Wells to Johannesburg. From Johannes- 
 burg the party proceeded across the Mohave Desert, crossing the 
 Santa Fe Railroad at Hinckley. Finally San Bernardino was readied, 
 which was the end of the journey. This trip lasted about five months, 
 and comprised over 2,000 miles of actual travel. 

The primary object of tlie expedition was to make the roughest kind 
 of a general geologic map, such as might fill up the great gaps in the 
 map of the western United States. It being the intention of the Sur- 
 vey to publish a general geologic map of the United States on a scale 
 of about 40 miles to the inch, no great amount of detail was advisable 
 or possible. On account, also, of the rough and inaccurate manner in 
 which much of the region of the western United States has been 
 already mapped, it was not advisable to undertake to do any work of 
 higher grade. 

In order to accomplish the style of mapping desired with as much 
 economy of time and labor as possible, the writer determined to avoid 
 anj^ duplication between his route and those already traveled by geolo- 
 gists, and carefully planned his journeys with that end in view. On 
 the north the area which he undertook to investigate was bounded by 
 the geologic maps of the Fortieth Parallel Survey (atlas maps 4 and 5) ; 
 on the east it was bounded by the geologic maps of the Wheeler sur- 
 vey; and on the west chiefly by a reconnaissance map of the Sierra 
 Nevada published by Mr. H. W. Turner in the Seventeenth Annual 
 Report of the United States Geological Survey, Part I ; on the south 
 there was no definite boundary. 

Within the area to be mapped, about the only important journey 
 that had been made by a geologist had been accomplished by Mr. 
 Gilbert in 1871, while with the Wheeler Topographic Survey. His 
 route, with the other boundaries already mentioned, is shown on PI. II. 
 The writer was able to so plan his route with reference to the work 
 of Mr. Gilbert and to the maps which bounded the area that hardly 
 any point in the region examined can be found which is more than 30 
 miles from a point of observation. This in any country would prob- 
 ably be sufficient for a reconnaissance map on a scale of 40 miles to 
 the inch, but in the Great Basin region of Nevada and California the 
 conditions are especially favorable, so that a map can be made having 
 far more value than in ordinary regions. The clear air, the lack of 
 vegetation, and the general continuity of formations parallel with the 
 north-south ranges all combine to make a reconnaissance more satis- 
 factory than usual. The attitude of strata or a conspicuous formation 
 maj" often be followed 15 or 20 miles along the front of a mountain, by 
 the aid of a field glass, from a single point.
