The field work upon which the jiresent bulletin is based, so far as 
 the writer's labors are concerned, was done in the summer and fall of 
 1899. After visiting the Wasatch Range to study briefly the Wasatch 
 Paleozoic section, as determined by the Fortieth Parallel Survey, the 
 writer proceeded to Eureka, in Nevada, and there spent two weeks in 
 studjnng that section, the best and most complete yet discovered in 
 the far West. Feeling finally ready for untried ground, the expedi- 
 tion, consisting, besides the writer, of a teamster, a cook, and an assist- 
 ant, left Eureka and proceeded southeastward to Hamilton, and then 
 to Elj^ From Elj^ the route ran to Osceola in the Snake Creek Range, 
 thence across that range and northward up Snake Valley to Pleasant 
 Valley, where a westward course was again taken. Schellbourne 
 and Cherry Creek, the latter in the Egan Range, were next visited, 
 and thence the waj^ led northwestward to Ruby Lake, and so back to 
 Eureka. During part of this journey some of the region which had been 
 mapped by the Fortieth Parallel Survej^ was traversed, this route being 
 purposely chosen so as to permit study in the field of the application 
 of the Fortieth Parallel geologic section. After replenishing sup- 
 plies at Eureka the expedition took the road southward to Hot Creek, 
 and thence proceeded westward to Belmont. The country to Carson 
 was then traversed, the more or less inactive mining camps of lone, 
 Ellsworth, and Downieville and the Indian reservation at Walker 
 Lake being passed. At Carson a short time was spent, and the famous 
 Comstock lode and the southern end of the Virginia Range were 
 visited. From Carson the route was southwestward past Wellington, 
 Hawthorne, Sodaville, Columbus, and Silver Peak, to Lida. From 
 Lida the course was again toward the east, and the State of Nevada 
 was crossed again by way of tlie Ralston Desert, Twin Springs, and 
 White River, to Pioche. From Pioche, Meadow Valley Canyon was 
 followed southward to the Indian reservation at Moapa or West Point, 
 not far from the Colorado, then, a turn to the west being made, the
