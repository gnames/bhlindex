62 GEOLOGY OF NEVADA SOUTH OF 40TH PARALLE'^u. [bull. 208. 

TOPOGRAPHY. 

The northern jiart of the White Pine Range, from the southern end 
 of the Humboldt Range to the White Pine mining district, consists of 
 a main ridge, which is narrow and not very high, with a number of 
 minor ridges on each side, separated from the main ridge by narrow 
 valleys in which the underlying rock is only partly obscured bj^ 
 Pleistocene detritus. In the vicinity of the White Pine mining dis- 
 trict the mountains grow higher and the small north-south ridges 
 change into a complicated group of irregular mountains. At the 
 same time the main ridge broadens out to four or five times its 
 former width. 

In the White Pine mining district three mam north-south ridges 
 may be distinguished â€” that of Pogonip Mountain on the west, the 
 minor one of Treasure Hill in the middle, and that of Mokeamoke 
 Ridge on the east. Still farther east a succession of regular north- 
 south ridges, similar to those just described for the northern part of 
 the range, form a continuation of the southern end of the Long Valley 
 Range. 

Within the White Pine mining district the mountains reach a height 
 of 10,000 feet above the sea, while to the north and to the south they 
 are considerably lower. To the south of the district also the moun- 
 tains assume something of the same simple character as they do to 
 the north, being made up of regular north-south ridges, and for 
 the most part consisting of a single main ridge. While in the mining 
 district the mountains and valleys are irregular, the topography of 
 the range to the north and to the south is quite conventional, showing 
 a nniform succession of serrated peaks of nearly uniform height, with 
 their sides furrow^ed at comparatively regular intervals by the 
 drainage. 

Within the mining district the irregularity is due, as will be pres- 
 ently seen, to the local complexity of the geologic structure. Pogonip 
 Mountain, which, near Hamilton, juts boldly out from the main ridge 
 and is the highest peak in the whole neighborhood, has a bold scarp 
 to the north and to the Avest. Throughout the district there are a 
 number of other precipitous cliffs. But in the rest of the range the 
 mountains show the same steep, but yet not abrupt, faces that are 
 characteristic of the other ranges of the region. It was noticed, how- 
 ever, that south of Hamilton the west face of the mountains was rather 
 steeper than the eastern one. 

SEDIMENTARY ROCKS. 

CAMBRIAN. 

Pogonip Mountain is composed of Paleozoic strata which dip in 
 general toward the east, forming the western limb of the syncline 
 whose eastern limb is exposed on the west side of Treasure Hill Ridge.
