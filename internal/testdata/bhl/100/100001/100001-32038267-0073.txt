On the western side of Pogonip Mountain Mr. Walcott ^ has deter- 
 mined from fossils the existence of the Cambrian Hamburg limestone 
 of the Eureka section. About 800 feet of the Cambrian is exposed at 
 this point. 

SILURIAN. 

Silurian rocks were described from Pogonip Mountain by Mr. 
 Hague ^ during the Fortieth Parallel Survey. Later on the Silurian 
 beds were also visited and reported upon by Mr. Walcott.'' Mr. Wal- 
 cott found in Pogonip Mountain the following formations, divided 
 according to the Eureka section :

The writer obtained from Mr. Grandelmeyer, of Hamilton, a fossil 
 said to come from a locality about 6 miles south of that place. It 
 was identified by Dr. Girty as Receptaculites sp. and assigned to the 
 Ordovician. 

DEVONIAN. 

While Pogonip Mountain is composed almost entirely of Silurian 
 strata, the ridge next east is made up almost entirely of Devonian. 
 Mr. Hague has described the strata and their contained fossils at this 
 point. The formation, divided according to the Eureka section, com- 
 prises the Nevada limestones and the White Pine shales. Besides 
 this Devonian ridge, the writer has also recognized the White Pine 
 Devonian on the east side of Mokeamoke Ridge, where it is 
 repeatedly brought to the surface beneath the Carboniferous rocks 
 by the erosion of anticlinal folds. He has moreover traced it north 
 of the White Pine mining district for some distance along the west 
 side of Mokeamoke Ridge, where it is largely hidden by Pleistocene 
 detritus. 

CARBONIFEROUS. 

The third and most easterly of the three ridges at White Pine, 
 Mokeamoke Ridge, is made up chiefly of Carboniferous rocks which 
 carry abundant fossils. A list of Carboniferous fossils obtained from 
 Mokeamoke Ridge in the mining district is given by Mr. Hague. ^^ 
 The writer has traced the continuation of the Carboniferous belt of 
 Mokeamoke Ridge 15 or 20 miles north of the mining district. At a
