64 GEOLOGY OF NEVADA SOUTH OB^ 40TH PARALLEL, [boll. 208. 

point 6 miles north of Hamilton Upper Carboniferous fossils were 
 collected. The following were determined by Dr. Girty: 

Producttis semh'eticulatus? 
 Spirifer boonensis. 
 Seminula siibtilita? 
 Euomphalus sp. 

In the same rocks, close by the above locality, but at a horizon 
 about 200 feet higher up, were found the following: 

ProdiTctus prattenianiis. 
 ProdiictiTS sp. 
 Spirifer boonensis. 
 Seniintila subtilita. 

The minor parallel ridges which mark the northern end of the range 
 have all the aspect and structure of the Carboniferous limestones. 
 The writer has also found Upper Carboniferous limestones lying 
 directly north of Pogonip Mountain, being separated from the Silu- 
 rian rocks at this point by a heavy east-west fault which deter- 
 mines the northern end of this mountain. Here the following fossils 
 were collected: 

Lithostrotion? sp. 
 ProdiTctiis sp. 
 Spirifer boonensis. 
 Spiriferina gonionotus. 
 Seminula mira? 
 Bulimorpha chrysalis? 

On the eastern side of Moteamoke Ridge the writer has traced the 
 Carboniferous rocks continuously across the intervening ranges to the 
 southern end of the Long Valley Range. 

At the head of AUepaw (Aj)plegarth?) Canyon, which is on the east 
 side of the range, just east of Hamilton, Glyphioceras sp., an Upper 
 Carboniferous form, was found. 

Half a mile farther east, down the canyon, were found the follow- 
 ing .Upper Carboniferous fossils: Marginifera muricatas, Productus 
 semireticulatus, Productus prattenianus. 

Still half a mile farther, at the old pumping station for the town of 
 Hamilton, were found: Orhiculoidea sp., Productus seniireticidatus, 
 Productus prattenianus, Marginifera muricata? 

Along this section the Carboniferous rocks alternate with narrow 
 belts of the underlying Devonian, which is exposed by the erosion of 
 the anticlinal folds. 

The Carboniferous section here has always at the base the Diamond 
 Peak quartzite of the Eureka section. This quartzite, or rather sand- 
 stone (for it is not actually a quartzite), outcrops all along the westerli 
 base of Mokeamoke Ridge, so far as this has been followed, and has 
 a thickness of several hundred feet â€” much smaller than at Eureka. 
 Above the sandstone come heavy, blue limestones containing Coal.
