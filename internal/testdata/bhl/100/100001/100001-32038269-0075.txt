Measures fossils. In the Carboniferous hillocks at tlie northei'u base 
 of Pogonip Mountain conglomerates were found containing joebbles 
 of red and purple chert, closely resembling similar beds just west of 
 here, on the east side of the Pancake Mountains. 

RHYOLITE ASH. 

North of the White Pine mining district and on the western side of 
 Mokeamoke Ridge, the broad area of low hills is partly covered by a 
 deposit of stratified rhyoliticash. NearSixmile House, 6 miles north 
 of Eureka, a dike of rhyolite is found which cuts this deposit and 
 shows that the ash is the earlier of the two. It is very likely that 
 this rhyolite ash is of the same age as that ex]30sed at Twin Springs 
 in the Pancake Range. 

IGNEOUS ROCKS. 

The existence of a rhyolite dike in the vicinity of Sixmile House 
 has just been referred to. In this neighborhood and farther north 
 one finds, together with the rhyolite ash already described, numerous 
 small buttes of lava which have been eroded into separate patches, 
 but which once evidently were joined together to form a continuous 
 thin sheet which sjjread over this region. 

Small patches of coarse-grained hornblende-granite have been men- 
 tioned by Hague « as outcropiDing along the base of Pogonij) Mountain. 
 Whether this granite is intrusive or Archean is not stated. 

STRUCTURE. 

FOLDING. 

The main ridge, Mokeamoke, which extends north from the White 
 Pine mining district, has a general synclinal structure. This sjaicline 
 is variously affected by erosion, so that at times one limb is almost 
 completely worn away, giving the range the aspect of being monocli- 
 nal. For the most part, however, this syncline is well shown for a 
 number of miles north of Hamilton. Still farther north, as far as the 
 southern end of the Humboldt Range, the structure was not carefully 
 observed, but in general it consists of a series of gentle ojjen folds 
 trending parallel to the mountain ridges. On Coal Burners or Bald 
 Mountain the attitude of the strata seems to be very near horizontal. 

Besides the main Mokeamoke Ridge, whose structure, as sketched 
 about 8 miles north of Hamilton, is shown in the accompanying figure
