ridge. Within this region also there are a great number of faults, 
 which appear in general to belong to two systems, one having a 
 north-south and the other an east-west strike. The heaviest fault of 
 the region appeared to the writer to be that at the northern end of 
 Pogonip Mountain, where the Coal Measures limestones are brought 
 by a hidden east-west fault directlj^ against the Silurian strata of 
 the mountain. This fault, therefore, must have a vertical displace- 
 ment of from 7,000 to 10,000 feet. On the northwest corner of Pogo- 
 nip IMountain another fault was observed, having a considerably less 
 displacement and a northwest strike. Mr. Hague '^^ mentions another 
 heavy fault on the western side of the same mountain. Between 
 Pogonip Mountain and the Treasure Hill ridge there is also, accord- 
 ing to Mr. Hague, ^ a disijlacement. In Treasure Hill itself Mr. 
 Hague '^ described, and the writer subsequently observed, an east- 
 west fault which crosses from the southern side of Treasure Hill 
 to Pogonip Mountain. It apj)eared to the writer also that the steeply 
 bent anticlinal fold which is exposed in an east-west cross section of 
 Treasure Hill has been faulted somewhat along its axis and the east- 
 ern part relatively downthrust, the fault being probably a normal 
 one. There are certainly many other faults in the mining district, 
 but all the examinations thus far made have been cursor}^ On the 
 western side of Mokeamoke Ridge and in AUepaw (Applegarth?) Can- 
 yon a number of probable east- west faults were observed. 

It will be noted that this faulting is, so far as observed, restricted 
 to the neighborhood of the mining district. To the north and to the 
 south there is little reason for believing that the mountains are much 
 affected by faulting. The White Pine district, then, bears exactly the 
 same relation to the rest of the White Pine Range as the Eureka 
 district does to the Diamond Range. Both are areas of local and 
 special dynamic disturbance, resulting in folding, faulting, and ore 
 deposition, and in both the special effects die out in a surprisingly 
 short distance. 

RELATION OF TOPOGRAPHY TO STRUCTURE. 

In the northern part of the White Pine Range, north of the mining 
 region, there is a distinct tendency toward anticlinal valleys and 
 synclinal ridges. The mountains, therefore, though determined pri- 
 marily by erosion, yet have the location of their ridges and valleys 
 governed by the position of the folds. South of the White Pine 
 mining region the same general peculiarities hold to the southern end 
 of the range. 

Within the mining region itself the faults introduce a new feature 
 into the topography. The whole district, as before stated, is traversed
