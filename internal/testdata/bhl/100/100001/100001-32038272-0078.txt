by a north-south and an east- west system of faults, with minor diago- 
 nal ones. Some of these are attended by steep scarps. 

In the same district wliere these scarps occur the folds seem to 
 have directly determined the topograjihy. The Treasure Hill ridge 
 is anticlinal and the valley between it and Pogonip Mountain syn- 
 clinal. But Mokeamoke Ridge and the ridges to the west are syn- 
 clinal, witli anticlinal valleys, indicating a long-continued erosion 
 period. The folding of the ridges to the west of Mokeamoke Ridge 
 was then distinctly later than that of the ridge itself and later than 
 that of the range in general. 

The faults of the mining district appear to belong also to the same 
 recent epoch as the associated folds. Those of Treasure Hill have 
 apparently been affected very little by erosion, and are marked by 
 scarps which seem to represent very closely the vertical displace- 
 ment. The same seems to be true of the heavy fault which forms the 
 northern end of Pogonip Mountain, which has already been mentioned. 

ORES. 

The structurally complicated region around Hamilton has been the 
 site of rich ore deposition. The ores are distinctly connected with 
 the fault fissures and have formed largely in their vicinit3^ Mr. 
 Hague "- describes the occurrence of the silver deposits of Treasure 
 Hill as (1) in fissures, striking east and west; (2) in deposits between 
 the limestone and shale; (3) in beds or chambers in the limestone 
 and parallel to the stratification of the rock; and (4) in the regular 
 seams or joints across the rock bedding, most frequently with a north- 
 south trend. The minerals found in the mining district comjjrise 
 quartzite, calcite, gypsum, fluorite, barite, black oxide of manganese, 
 rhodochrosite, cerargyrite, galena, cerussite, and azurite. The dis- 
 trict once had a population of many thousand, but at present there is 
 very little activity. 

QUINN CANYON AND GRANT RANGES. 

The Grant Range is really the southern extension of the White 
 Pine Range, there being no decided break between the two. It has a 
 length from north to south of about 30 miles. Tlie Quinn Canyon 
 Range is closely connected with the Grant Range, being separated 
 only by a narrow rock-cut valley, whose bottom is for the most part 
 comparatively free from detritus. It is, however, offset from the 
 Grant Range to the west. The Quinn Canyon Range is broad and 
 short, having a north-south extent of about 25 miles, and an east- west 
 extent of nearly 20 miles. 

TOPOGRAPHY. 

The Grant Range consists of a single main ridge, rather flat and 
 broad on toj^, and cut up deeply by the smaller mountain valleys,
