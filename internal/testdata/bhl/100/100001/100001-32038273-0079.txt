which run out into the wide detritus-filled main vallej's. These 
 smaller valleys and their auxiliary gulches are generally bounded by 
 steep walls. In general, the main mountain fronts, on the east and 
 west, are also steep. The south end of the range, which lies just east 
 of Garden Valley, decreases graduallj^ in height, and so passes into a 
 series of low buttes which run out into the valley. 

The Quinn Canyon Range is bounded hy steep cliffs on the east, 
 west, and north sides of its northern half, and the small vallej'^s and 
 ravines which have been worn in this half are guarded by the same 
 precipitous walls as in the Grant Range. This part of the range is 
 cut out of limestone; hence its rugged and irregular topograph 3^ The 
 southern part of the range is a mass of volcanic rocks, which, how- 
 ever, have been extensively eroded. The type of topography is nat- 
 nrally quite different from that in the limestone region, the distribu- 
 tion of the valley's being regular and the rocks being cut up into steep 
 but not precipitous mountains. The southern end of the range also 
 appears to have a more gradual descent into the plain that has the 
 northern.

CAMBRIAN. 

In the foothills at the north end of the Qninn Canyon Rapge and 
 to the north of the abrupt scarj) which limits the northern end of the 
 mountain proper an exposure of rustj-brown shal}'' limestone was 
 found in a canj^on, from which fossils were collected. They were 
 determined by Mr. Walcott as Cambrian. 

These were the onlj^ Cambrian rocks found in the two ranges. 
 Immediately" to the south, in the high mountains of the Quinn Canyon 
 Range, the rocks are Silurian and probably also Devonian, and indeed 
 an outcrop of undoubtedly Silurian quartzite (Eureka formation) was 
 found only a short distance east of the Cambrian locality. The atti- 
 tude of the beds in both outcroj)S makes it clear that between the two 
 there is a heavy fault, and from the lack of faulting in the Quinn 
 Canyon Range proj)er it is clear that the fault does not run in a 
 north-south direction, but must run in a general east-west direction, 
 not far from the base of the heavj' scarp which delimits the mountain 
 at its north end. 

SILURIAN. 

On the steep west face of the northern end of the Quinn Canyon 
 Range the mountains near the base consist of massive, often shaly, 
 dark-blue to gray-blue limestone, much broken ^.nd veined as a con- 
 sequence of granitic intrusions. On account of the alteration the 
 organic remains obtained from this limestone are not identifiable. 
 Six hundred or 800 feet above the base of the limestone, as exposed, 
 comes about 200 feet of hard white vitreous quartzite, which one at 
 once recognizes as probably the Eureka formation. Above this 
 quartzite comes upward of 4,000 feet of gray-blue extremel}" massive 
 limestone, extending to the top of the mountain and weathering into
