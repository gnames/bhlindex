On the east side also the Eureka quartzife again appears and can 
 be contiuuonsly traced for long distances, thus becoming an impor- 
 tant aid in the studj^ of the stratigraphy. In the valley which sepa- 
 rates the Quinn Canyon Range from the Grant Range the Eureka 
 quartzite outcrops on both sides, on the two limbs of an anticlinal 
 fold froDi which the valley has been eroded. In the bottom of the 
 vallej", beneath the quartzite, is found massive limestone, brecciated, 
 hardened, and altered. In the upper part of that portion of the 
 valley draining north (which is separated by a decided divide from 
 that portion which drains to the south into Grarden Valley) the ascent 
 takes one above the horizon of the Eureka quartzite into that of the 
 overlying limestones. Along the course of this nortliern j^art of the 
 valley no good fossils could be found in any locality, but fragments 
 picked up at various points in the canyon have been identified by 
 Professor Ulrich as Silurian.

At the divide above mentioned tlie stratified rocks are hidden ])y 
 later volcanics. A short distance south of the pass, however, the 
 Eureka quartzite is again encountered, and above it the same heavy 
 limestone as appeared in the Quinn Canyon Range. These rocks 
 extend quite through to the eastern face of the Grant Range. On 
 the lower part of Cherry Creek, after passing the volcanic area, densÂ© 
 blue limestone is encountered, and farther down the Eureka quartz- 
 ite. From the limestone beds, a few hundred feet below the quartzite, 
 the following Ordovician fossils were obtained and determined by 
 Professor Ulrich.

The Eureka quartzite, dipping to the east, forms the eastern front 
 of the Grant Range for some miles north of Cherry Creek, and then, 
 on account of the irregular erosion of the mountain front, passes into 
 tlie foothills, where it can be traced for a nuinber of miles farther 
 north. 

DEVONIAN. 

No Devonian fossils were obtained from either the Quinn Canj^on or 
 Grant ranges. As already noted, however, the thickness of the lime- 
 stone section which is exposed above the Eureka quartzite is upward 
 of 4,000 feet in both ranges. In the Eureka section <* the thickhess of 
 the Silurian Lone Mountain limestone above the Eureka quartzite is
