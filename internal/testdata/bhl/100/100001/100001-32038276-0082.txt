given at 1,800 feet. There is an unconformity at Eureka between the 
 Eureka quartzite and the overljdng limestone. Nevertheless, it is 
 very likely that the upper portion of the massive limestone observed 
 in the Quinn Canyon and Grant ranges includes part of the Devonian 
 limestone of the N.evada formation. 

CARBONIFEROUS. 

On the eastern slope of the Grant Range, north of Warm Spring, in 
 White River Valley, the following Carboniferous fossils were collected 
 by Mr. F. B. Weeks'^ and determined by Dr. Girty: 

Chonetes sp. 
 Chonetes illinoisensis. 
 Derbya kaskaskiensis. 
 Prodtictella ? near concentrica. 
 Sph'ifer centronatus. 
 Camarotoechia sp. 
 Eiiinetria verneuiliana. 
 Naticopsis sp. 
 Ostracoda. 

PLIOCENE. 

In the northern part of the valley separating the two ranges there 
 are found, uj) to a height of 6,200 feet above the sea, horizontally bed- 
 ded arkoses and conglomerates, made iTp of the fragments of the 
 limestone cliffs above and nevertheless hardened into' solid rocks. 
 This may be a shore formation, and may belong to the Pliocene lake 
 whose sediments are shown in the Pancake Range at Twin Springs 
 and at Hot Creek. The Pleistocene subaerial accumulations hide the 
 Tertiary strata throughout the greater part of the valleys. A hint of 
 the former existence of a Pliocene lake on the west side of Quinn 
 Canyon Range, however, was found in the x>eculiar development of 
 the gulches which furrowed the volcanic rocks. These gulches are 
 deepest at the top, and grow progressively shallower lower down, 
 until near the bottom they die out entirely. This may signify that 
 the development of the gulches began above the surface of the Plio- 
 cene lake and as the lake became lower the gulches were forced to 
 extend themselves, but naturally accomplished only a small amount 
 of cutting in those new portions as compared with the long-established 
 upper parts. 

IGNEOUS ROCKS. 
 RHYOLITE AND GRANITE. 

On the west side of Quinn Canyon Range, directlj^ east of Twin 
 Springs, are found great masses of siliceous igneous rocks which widen 
 in extent farther south and cover up the whole of the range. ^ At the 
 northern end of the mountain valley which separates the most easterly 
 part of the range from the westerl}^ part, along which the Quinn Canyon
