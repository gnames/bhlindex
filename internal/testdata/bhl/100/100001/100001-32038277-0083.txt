road runs, the volcanic rock has been stripped down to the underlying 
 limestone, which is found to be traversed by great dikes of acid rock, 
 varying from coarse to fine in texture. The overlj-ing rhj^olite and 
 the dike rocks were examined microscopically. Of two specimens of 
 the dikes one was a coarse biotite- hornblende-granite and the other 
 a very fine biotite-granite-porphjay, the same mineralogically as the 
 coarse variety, but both mineralogically and structurally far more 
 closelj' connected with the rhj'olite.'* It is probable, therefore, that 
 the dikes and the massive eruptions constitute different jparts of the 
 same igneous mass. 

BASALTIC VOLCANICS. 

In the small valley between the two ranges, thin-bedded basaltic 
 volcanics occur just south of the pass and stretch over a considerable 
 area. These rocks are fine grained or glassy and show very beautiful 
 flow structure, in strong contrast to the massive, rugged rhj^olite in 
 the hills above them. Specimens examined microscopically show the 
 rock to be a basalt carrying augite and hornblende. The basaltic 
 rocks extend for some distance along Cherry Valley. 

QUARTZ-LATITES. 

On the east side of the Grant Range, near the point where it joins 
 the White Pine Range, the outljnng foothills which bound the south- 
 ern or southwestern end of Sierra Valley are evidently comjDosed of 
 dark-colored volcanic rock. This is not far from similar volcanic 
 areas which form the northerly continuation of the Golden Gate Range, 
 and is very likely of the same nature. From one of the volcanic hills 
 of the Golden Gate Range near this point a specimen i^roved to be 
 quartz-latite, containing augite, biotite, and hornblende. 

RELATIVE AGE OF LAVAS. 

In these two ranges the rhyolites are distinctly oldest, as shown not 
 only by the fact that the more basic lavas overlie them, but also by 
 the greater erosion of the rhj^olites as compared with the others. The 
 latite ax3pears to be of intermediate age. It is probable that the 
 rhyolites and the basalts are to be correlated with the corresponding 
 lavas of the Pancake Range, as exhibited at Twin Springs. 

STRUCTURE. 
 FOLDING. 

At the west base of the Quinn Canyon Range the distribution of the 
 Eureka quartzite shows that there exists here an anticline with a 
 north-south or northeasterly-southwesterly axis. The north end of 
 the range exposes a broad, very shallow syncline, which succeeds the 
 anticline to the east. In the center of this syncline the beds are 
 horizontal for a considerable distance, and the maximum dip on
