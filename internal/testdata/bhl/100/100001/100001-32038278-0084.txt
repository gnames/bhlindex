the two sides is about 35°. The syn- 
 cline is succeeded farther east by 
 an anticline, along which the valley 
 separating the two mountain ranges 
 has been eroded. The Eureka quartz- 
 ite, which appears on both sides of 
 this anticline, allows its being traced 
 easily for long distances. The fold 
 has a general north - northwesterly 
 trend and is visible in the moun- 
 tains of the Grant Range about 
 8 or 10 miles to the northeast of the 
 north end of the Quinn Canyon 
 Range. At this point it is much 
 sharper than farther south. 

The eastern limb of the anticline, 
 which is steeper than the western 
 limb, is at the same time the western 
 limb of a syncline which is dis- 
 plajT^ed in the Grant Range. There 
 are some slight minor folds, but the 
 general cross section apjDcars to show 
 a perfect sjnicline at a point just east 
 of the north end of the Quinn Canyon 
 Range. Farther south, in the vicinity 
 of Cherrj^ Creek, the jutting out of 
 the mountains a little farther east, 
 as a consequence of the irregular ero- 
 sion, permits the study of a third 
 anticline, Avhich succeeds the syn- 
 cline, and is a heavy and persistent 
 fold. Looking north from the vicinity 
 of Cherr}" Creek, one sees this anti- 
 clinal fold passing from the side of 
 the mountains into the foothills, so 
 that the strata which at first dip 
 easterly on the mountain face change 
 to a westerly dip, which denotes the 
 eastern limb of the Grant Range syn- 
 cline. These folds have a more north- 
 easterly strike than those farther west, 
 so that the easternmost anticline just 
 described probablj^ strikes across the 
 valley to the low hills which divide the 
 Golden Gate Range from the Grant 
 Range about 20 miles north of Cherry
