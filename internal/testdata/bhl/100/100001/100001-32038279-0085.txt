 point the anticline is joined on the east by a connected series of open 
 synclines and anticlines, which form the low mountains of the Golden 
 Gate Range and extend across to the northern end of the Hiko Range.

The strikes of these folds become more and more easterly until in 
 the Hiko Range they swing round and become southwesterly, and 
 then, farther south, pass into the usual north-south trend again, 
 having described semicircles. (See figs. 3 and 4.) 

FAULTING. 

As alreadj^ mentioned, there is apparently a heavy fault at the 
 northern end of the Quinn Canyon Range, which has brought up the 
 Cambrian rocks on the north side against the Silurian on the south. 
 This was the only fault determined in the two ranges. (See fig. 5.)

Some slight crumpling of the strata was observed on the eastern side 
 of the Grant Range, near Cherry Creek, but this was probablj^ due to 
 the intrusion of the near-by volcanic rocks. In general, the folds of 
 the stratified rocks are even and unbroken. 

RELATION OF STRUCTURE TO TOPOGRAPHY. 

As described, the Quinn Canj^on Range is essentially a simple syn- 
 cline, as is also the Grant Range. On the west side of the Quinn 
 Canyon Range, the east side of the Grant Range, and also between
