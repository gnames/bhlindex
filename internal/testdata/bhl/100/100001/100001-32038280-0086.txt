the two ranges, are anticlines wliicli are marked by deep depressions. 
 In general, therefore, the form of the mountains is one that implies a 
 long period of erosion subsequent to the folding. Although the faces 
 of both these ranges, on the east and on the west, are somewhat 
 abrupt, the apparent continuation of the beds XDast these steep faces 
 without break indicates that the faces are not caused by faulting, but 
 are due to erosion. The north end of the Quinn Canyon Range is 
 probably along a fault, but in this case the Cambrian rocks, which 
 have been relatively upthrust by the faulting, are found in low foot- 
 hills running into the valley, while the downthrust Silurian rocks 
 form abrupt cliffs facing the Cambrian. It seems, therefore, that if 
 the cliff was primarily determined by faulting it is not directlj^ due to 
 upthrnst, but to powerful erosion. 

WORTHINGTON MOUNTAINS. 

The Worthington Mountains are a very small group lying north- 
 west of the Pahranagat Range, with which they are connected by a 
 series of hills. They also are connected with and probably form the 
 northern extension ef the Timpahute Range, and on the north the 
 rocks are probably continuous with those of the Grant Range, from 
 which they are separated by a few miles of desert valley. On the 
 west side of the Worthington Mountains there is a series of low hills 
 which form a certain connection between them and the Quinn Canyon 
 Range. 

Like most of the high mountains of the region, as, for example, the 
 Quinn Canyon Range and the Grant Range farther north, the Worth- 
 ington Mountains have steep sides, averaging perhaps 30Â° in incli- 
 nation to the horizontal, to the east, west, and north. 

SEDIMENTARY ROCKS. 

The northern end of the range was viewed by the writer from a point 
 several miles farther north. From here the rocks are apparently 
 massive limestones, resembling the Devonian and Silurian strata of 
 the Grant Range just to the north, and having a similar strike. These 
 same strata can be traced southward along the flanks of the moun- 
 tains. At the northern end, according to Mr. Gilbert,^ they consist 
 principally of limestone, with some sandstone- The limestone carried 
 abundant fossils, which probably belong to the Silurian. 

IGNEOUS ROCKS. 

According to Mr. Gilbert, the northern end of the mountain is 
 flanked on the east by beds of rhyolite, associated with which are the 
 Freiberg silver mines.
