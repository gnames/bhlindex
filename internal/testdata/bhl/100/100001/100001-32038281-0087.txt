STRUCTURE. 

At tilie northern end of the range the strata dip westerly about 30Â°, 
 parallel with the general slope of the range. Farther south the dij) 
 grows continually less, until at the southern end it is horizontal. It 
 was at this point observed by Mr. Gilbert, who interpreted the hori- 
 zontal structure of this bold mountain as determined bj^ faults on 
 both sides, the mountain being an upthrust block between the two. 
 Considering the change in attitude between the south and north ends, 
 however, it may also be that the mountain represents part of a fold 
 whose strike diverges slightl}^ from the trend of the ridge. 

PANCAKE RANGE. 
 TOPOGRAPHY. 

The northern end of the Pancake Range lies just east of Eureka, 
 where it terminates in White Pine Valley. North of this termination 
 and across the valley is Coal Burner or Bald Mountain, a prominent 
 eminence which appears to be in geologic continuity with the Pancake 
 Range, but which is more closely connected topographically with the . 
 southern end of the Humboldt Range. To the south the Pancake Range 
 extends in a straggling fashion as far as Twin Springs, a distance of 
 about 100 miles, with a general trend a little west of south. At Twin 
 Springs a narrow pass separates the Pancake Range from the Reveille 
 Range, farther south. There is, however, no real break in the topo- 
 graphic continuity here, and the distinction is therefore somewhat 
 arbitrary. 

The Pancake Range is low and without striking relief, as its name 
 indicates. The northern end of the range consists in part of lime- 
 stone ridges with general northwest trends, diagonal to the trend of 
 the range. Flanking these limestone ridges are somewhat dissected 
 but nevertheless level-topped volcanic mesas. South of the road 
 between Eureka and Hamilton is a considerable area of shaly Devo- 
 nian rocks, which are eroded into low smooth hills. About 8 or 10 
 miles farther south, with the covering up of the stratified rocks by 
 later eruptives, a corresponding change in the topographj^ takes 
 place. The single main ridge divides into a number of irregular 
 parallel ridges and the low smooth hills change to higher ones which, 
 though sometimes rounded, are often sharp or conical. The tops of 
 these hills often join to form a general mesa. This type of topog- 
 raphy extends to the extreme southern end of the range. 

SEDIMENTARY ROCKS. 

CARBONIFEROUS. 

In the northern end of the range limestones and conglomerates asso- 
 ciated with thin seams of impure coal have been reported.'* These
