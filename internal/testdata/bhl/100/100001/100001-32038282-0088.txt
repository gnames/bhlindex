78 GEOLOGY OF NEVADA SOUTH OF 40TH PARALLEL, [bill 208. 

limestones contain numerous species of Carboniferous fossils. The 
 writer also collected Upper Carboniferous fossils from tlie vicinity of 
 the road which crosses the Pancake Mountains between Eureka and 
 Hamilton. One locality afforded the following species, which were 
 determined by Dr. Girtj^ : 

Fusulina cylindrica. 
 Fisttilipora ? sp. 
 Derbya sp. 

Chonetes verneuilianus. 
 Rhipidomella pecosi. 
 Prodtictiis sp. 
 ProtliTctiis nebraskensis ? 
 Margin! f era muricata ? 
 Seniinula subtilita ? 

Another localit}^ about 2 miles southeast of the first, yielded 
 Chceietes milleporaceus, Spirifer rockymontanus, Phillijjsia s;2>- 

These fossils were in shaly gray limestone, which was overlain by 
 more massive limestone, interstratified with occasional belts of con- 
 glomerate containing pebbles of quartzite and chert. 

DEVONIAN. 

South of the road meiitioned come in the sandy and limy shales of 
 the Devonian White Pine formation. Â« This shale is associated with 
 beds of brown sandstone which contains plant remains. 

TERTIARY. 

On the west side of Hastings Pass, in the Humboldt Range, near 
 the northern end of White Pine. Valley, are sediments to which was 
 given the name of the Humboldt Pliocene, and which were described 
 and mapped by the Fortieth Parallel Survey. These beds were 
 examined by the writer and were found to consist largely of limestone 
 fragments derived from adjacent Silurian rocks. They abut against 
 the mass of the Humboldt Range in such a manner as to show that 
 this range formed their shore line and that they were deposits formed 
 when the valley had practically its present shape. 

In other parts of the valley the Pliocene deposits are generally 
 covered with Pleistocene accumulations, and are therefore not dis- 
 cernible. Along the Pancake Range, however, on the east side of 
 the extreme southern end of Little Smoky Valley, stratified deposits 
 similar to those on the flanks of the Humboldt Range were found, 
 forming a fringe around the mountains. 

At Twin Springs the canyon which has been worn transversely across 
 the mountains exposes a section of Tertiary stratified rocks, lying 
 between the Tertiary volcanics. The section shows rhyolite at the 
 base. Above this comes several hundred feet of horizontally bedded
