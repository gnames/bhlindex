water-laid semiconipacted sandstones, apjiarently derived from the 
 rlij^olite. At the top of this stratified series the white sands change 
 to stratified tufl's and gravels, brown in color and evidently derived 
 from basic lava snch as immediately overlies them. This lava is a 
 solid dark-colored basalt, which forms the uppermost member of the 
 series. 

PLEISTOCENE LAKE .DEPOSITION. 

At several points the marks of a comparatively recent body of 
 water, occupying a large part of Big Smoky and White Pine valleys, 
 were observed. On the east side of the Diamond Range, about 10 
 miles north of Pinto Creek, distinct terraces were observed in the 
 detritus at the base of the mountains. These terraces are several in 
 number and are 50 or 60 feet above the valley floor. Also about 15 
 miles south of Fish Creek a regular bench com loosed of lava debris 
 was noted on both sides of the vallej^ about 15 feet above the smooth 
 mud deposits of the valley bottom. Farther north, at a point on the 
 Pancake Range just south of the road between Eureka and Hamilton, 
 at the mouth of a gap in the hills, a definite beach bar was noticed, 
 such as forms along gently sloping shores at the mouths of inlets. 

There was therefore probably a Pleistocene body of water which 
 spread over the greater part of Little Smoky and White Pine valleys. 
 The shore marks above mentioned indicate that this lake was shallow. 
 Tlie final remains of the Pleistocene lake may be considered as still 
 existing in the numerous marshy ponds which are scattered through 
 the White Pine Valley north of the Pancake Range. 

GULCH DUMPS OR ALLUVIAL FANS. 

Along the line of junction of the mountains Avitli the valleys, and 
 occasionally forming the low foothills, are sometimes observed accu- 
 mulations of detritus which rise above the level valley floor, and 
 which have such relation to the gulches of the mountains above that 
 it is plain their materials have been derived from their erosion; and 
 in some cases it seems that the amount of material in these dumps is 
 a verj^ large portion of that which has been removed in the excava- 
 tion of the gulches. Where this material is exposed at the surface, it 
 is found to be angular and bearing other marks of having been 
 brought down by torrents. 

These accumulations are certainly, in part at least. Pleistocene, and 
 are being added to at i^resent. However, they antedate largely the 
 Pleistocene water body above described. They are therefore Pliocene- 
 Pleistocene, and are largely contemporaneous with the water-laid 
 deposits which occur at lower altitudes. 

IGNEOUS ROCKS. 

At the northern end of the Pancake Range a body of rhyolite forms 
 the western half of the mountains and extends as far south as the
