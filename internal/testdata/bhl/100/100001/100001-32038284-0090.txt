road between Eureka and Hamilton. A short distance south of this 
 road andesite comes in in considerable patches/' This andesite was 
 observed by the writer at intervals for a distance of 10 or 15 miles 
 south of here. It is here generally mixed up with small areas of rhyo- 
 lite. Still farther south rhyolite seems to form the greater part of 
 the range (PL V, B). In the neighborhood of Twin Springs, as men- 
 tioned above, the rhyolite occurs at the base of the section and basalt 
 at the top. 

STRUCTURE. 

FOLDING. 

The area of White Pine Devonian rocks, above described, forms a 
 shallow syncline which apparently gives place to a gentle anticline 
 farther north, and there exposes the Carboniferous limestones. It is 
 possible, however, that it is a fault which brings up these limestones. 
 The syncline has a general northwest strike and is i)lainly continuous 
 with the faulted syncline of the Eureka district, just across the valley, 
 which has Newark Mountain on its eastern limb and the Alhambra 
 Hills on its western. This syncline may be traced across the Pancake 
 Mountains and across the intervening low hills to the White Pine 
 Range, its strike being at an angle to the general trend of the major 
 ridges, although the minor ridges conform to it. 

FAULTING. 

The Upper Carboniferous limestones on the road across the range, 
 between Eureka and Hamilton, have perhaps been brought to their

present jDosition by an east-west fault, transverse to the trend of the 
 range, for their relation to the Devonian rocks just south of here can 
 not be readily explained by the folding. 

The accompanying section (fig. 6) shows the structure of the Pan- 
 cake Mountains at Twin Springs. There has been practically no 
 folding here, except where the beds have been locally crumpled bj^ 
 overriding sheets of lava. A series of faults was observed, some of 
 which have a throw of several huudi-ed feet. The fault lines are 
 accompanied by gullies, but not by fault scarps.
