COAL. 

lu the northern end of the Pancake Range the Carboniferous rocks 
 carry tliin seams of impure coal, which have been in vain explored 
 for marketable material. "■ 

DIAMOND RANGE. 

The Diamond Range may be somewhat arbitrarily defined as begin- 
 ning at Railroad Canyon on the north, and extending southward 
 through the Eureka Mountains to Fish Creek. South of Fish Creek 
 comj^aratively low mountains occur. No decided break separates 
 these from the Eureka Mountains, but they are more closely associ- 
 ated with the Hot Creek Range, and will be described in the latter 
 connection. 

TOPOGRAPHY. 

The main part of the Diamond Range, from its northern end to the 
 vicinity of Eureka, consists of a single narrow, somewhat regular 
 ridge, whose divide is in the center. This is sharply cut uj) on both 
 sides, so as to present a succession of well-defined peaks, with deep 
 drainage channels. 

In the neighborhood of Eureka this simple topographic structure 
 changes to a more complicated one, which is the expression of a 
 geologic structure more comj^licated than that to the north. The 
 mountains in the vicinity of Eureka are considerabl}^ folded, and are 
 traversed by numerous faults, which run in several directions. The 
 result of the erosion of this structurally complicated region is that 
 there have arisen many separate mountain ridges, and the total width 
 of the range has increased. 

South of the Eureka Mountains the range is composed of a single 
 narrow ridge of stratified rocks, which seem to resume the compara- 
 tively" simple structure of the northern portion. Just south of here 
 the sedimentaries are buried iinder thick sheets of lava. 

SEDIMENTARY ROCKS. 

At the nothern end of the Diamond Range, at Railroad Canyon, 
 the rocks have been described by Mr. Hague ^ as light cream-colored 
 limestones dipping to the north under sheets of basalt. These lime- 
 stones are mapped by the Fortieth Parallel geologists ^ as the Lower 
 Coal Measures.

 from a i)oint just west of Hastings Pass, in the Humboldt Range, to 
 the southern termination. At the northern end of the traverse a sec-
