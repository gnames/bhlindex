tion of strata is visible, wliicli, in default of oj)i30i-tiinity for examina- 
 tion, Avas provision allj^ supposed to have the Devonian White Pine 
 shale of Eureka at the base, with the Carboniferous Diamond Peak 
 quartzite above. 

The thickness of the exposures of these two formations was roughly 
 estimated at from 2,000 to 2,500 feet. Above this section were 
 obsei'ved comparatively massive limestones which were taken to be 
 the Lower Coal Measures limestones, and of these an estimated thick- 
 ness of 4,000 feet was observed. Above these again are heavy 
 brown-weathering massive rocks forming the precipitous crest of the 
 range for a long distance. These were thought to belong to the Webtr 
 formation. About 1,500 feet of this was visible, the top not being 
 seen. Mr. Hague ^* notes that at Chokup Pass, which is within the 
 above section, limestones occur in which no fossils were found. "In 
 the limestone occurs a belt of coarse, although compact, brownish- 
 yellow sandstone, not unlike the sandstone body at White Pine, which 
 lies at the base of the Coal Measures limestone. It measures nearly 
 300 feet in thickness." This is, perhai^s, the Diamond Peak quartz- 
 ite, as it was afterwards called bj^ the geologists who studied the 
 Eureka district. 

South of Chokup Pass the same formations occur. In the eastern 
 foothills the Diamond Peak quartzite outcrops, brown, iron stained, 
 friable, and calcareous, resembling exactly the same formation as 
 exposed in the Egan Range, in the canyon west of Ely. The quartzite 
 becomes at times a conglomerate, containing i^ebbles of chert and 
 limestone. It is possible that this conglomerate indicates an erosion 
 interval between the Carboniferous and the underlying Devonian. 

A few miles farther south, the strike of the Diamond Peak quartz- 
 ite having carried it temporarily under the valley detritus, the 
 eastern foothills are composed of the overlying dark-blue limestone 
 with chert nodules. This limestone cai-ries the following abundant 
 fauna, determined as Upper Carboniferous by Dr. Girty; 

Fistulipora ? sp. 
 Rhombopora lepidodeiidroides. 
 ArchaBOcidaris sp. 
 Productns prattenianus. 
 Prodiicttis semireticulattis. 
 Productus nebraskensis. 
 Prodnctus nevadensis ?. 
 Sph'ifer boonensis. 
 Seminula stibtilita. 
 Fish scale. 

Still farther south a change in the structure brings in the Diamond 
 Peak^iuartzite again, together with the underlying Devonian rocks, 
 and the strata rise rapidly to the top of the range.
