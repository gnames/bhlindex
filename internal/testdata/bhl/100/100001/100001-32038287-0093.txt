slightly fetid limestone was found, and at a point about 1,000 feet 
 above the bottom of the series exjDosed were Devonian fossils, as 
 determined by Dr. Girty.

This is part of the Nevada limestone, for the Devonian White 
 Pine shales come in about 500 feet above. 

South of here the geology has been thoroughly worked out during 
 the surve}^ of the Eureka mining district, which survey embraces the 
 region from Diamond Peak on the north to White Cloud Peak on the 
 south. 

Within this area is found exposed the best Paleozoic section yet 
 studied west of the Rocky Mountains, comprising strata from the 
 Prospect Mountain Cambrian quartzite, through the Cambrian, Silu- 
 rian, Devonian, and Carboniferous.^ 

South of the Eureka mining district proper, the single ridge into 
 which the mountains contract is shown in the geologic maj) of the 
 Eureka district^ to be composed of the Silurian Pogonip limestone. 
 This limestone extends farther south till covered up by volcanic flows. 

IGNEOUS ROCKS. 

At the northern termination of the Diamond Range the stratified 
 rocks are overlain by flows of basalt. '^ Between this point and the 
 region around Eureka no igneous rocks were observed. The Eureka 
 district, however, lias been the seat of volcanic activity. Among the 
 volcanic rocks, hornblende-andesite, dacite, rhyolite, pyroxene-ande^ 
 site, and basalt have been described bj'^ Mr. Iddings.*^ Granite-i^or- 
 phyry is also found as a dike rock. 

The volcanic rock which occurs at the southern termination of the 
 range has been determined by the writer, a few miles farther south, 
 to be rhyolite. 

STRUCTURE. 

North of the Eureka district the stratified rocks of the Diamond 
 Range are bent into a series of gentle folds which in general strike 
 nearl}^ with the trend of the range. In the region between Chokup 
 Pass and Railroad Pass these folds seem to consist of an anticline on 
 the east side, with its eastern limb almost buried by the detritus of 
 the valley, followed by a shallow broad syncline to the west, and this
