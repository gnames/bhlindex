in turn by an important anticline wliicli seems to form tlie western 
 edge of the mountains. 

At Chokup Pass Mr. Hague" notes tlie general anticlinal structure 
 of the mountains, the summit of the anticline occupj-ing the crest of 
 the pass. This is the same anticline as has just been noted as form- 
 ing the western face of the mountains to the north of the pass, the 
 slight divergence of the strike of the fold from the trend of the moun- 
 tain bringing the fold to this place. Farther south the continued 
 divergence brings the axis of this anticline at one point down to the 
 easternmost foothills. As a consequence of this, the syncline and 
 anticline which lie to the east are covered by valley detritus. Farther 
 south still, as one approaches the vicinity of Diamond Peak, the trend 
 of the folds changes slightly and again brings the crest of the eastern- 
 most anticline to the summit of the range. 

South of Diamond Peak the country in the neighborhood of Eureka 
 is a region of special dynamic disturbance, and is folded and faulted 
 to a remarkable degree. Except in this district, however, no faults 
 have been observed in the range. 

RELATION OF STRUCTURE TO TOPOGRAPHY. 

North of the Eureka district the structure has been so far influ- 
 ential that the trend of the range corresponds nearly to the general 
 strike. 

In the Eureka district the complicated topography is dependent 
 upon the increased complications in the geology, but the forms appo^ir 
 to be directly due to differential erosion. Most of the faults here are 
 oblique to the general trend of the range. Along these faults valleys 
 or canyons are sometimes found, and sometimes moderate scarps; 
 but that these latter are due to differential erosion is shown by the 
 fact that it is sometimes the downthrown side of the fault that 
 appears as a scarp and sometimes the upthrowu, depending upon the 
 nature of the beds. 

ORES. 

The whole district around Eureka has been the site of abundant 
 ore deposition, a phenomenon plainly connected with the dynamic 
 disturbances which have brought about the complicated folding and 
 faulting (and indirectly the topography) and with the volcanic out- 
 bursts. The ore deposits of Eureka have already been thoroughly 
 studied.* Outside of this region the range is not remarkably ore 
 bearing. 

HOT CREEK RANGE. 

The Hot Creek Range is separated at its south end by a narrow 
 pass from the Kawich Range, which otherwise is continuous with it.
