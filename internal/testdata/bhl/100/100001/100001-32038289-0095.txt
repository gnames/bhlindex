HOT CREEK EANGE. 85 

From here it runs north 70 miles and disappears in a valley a few 
 miles sonth of the latitude of Eureka. In the same line, farther 
 north, occurs the Piiion Range. The northern continuation of the 
 Hot Creek Valley divides the mountains into an east and a west half. 
 The western half is the continuation of the Hot Creek Range proper, 
 while the eastern one runs north and joins the Eureka Mountains.

. Three miles west of this localit}^, at the ranch near Hot Springs, 
 there comes in, below bed No. 1, more massive siliceous light-gray, 
 coarsely crystalline or aphanitic limestone about 600 feet in thick- 
 ness. This makes about 1,000 feet of limestone in all below the 
 quartzite. 

From the first-named locality, at a point about 200 feet below the 
 quartzite, Ordovician fossils were obtained. The following were deter- 
 mined by Professor Ulrich : 

Amphion (sp. near A. salteri Billings) . 

nisenus (sp. near I. americanus, consimilis. and crassicauda) . 

Bathynrns sp. iindet.
