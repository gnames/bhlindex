86 GEOLOGY OF NEVADA SOUTH OF 40TH PARALLEL, [bull. 208. 

It is, then, plain that the quartzite is the Eureka quartzite of the 
 Eureka section, while the limestone below corresponds to the Pogonip 
 formation and that above to the Lone Mountain. We have here 
 a section of about 3,100 feet of Silurian rocks, comprising 1,000 feet 
 of the Pogonip, 400 feet of the Eureka, and 1,700 feet of the Lone 
 Mountain. 

A few miles south of the above locality, in the next canj^on to the 
 south of Hot Creek, there were collected from the limestones above 
 the quartzite the following Upper Silurian fossils (Niagara ?), as deter- 
 mined by Professor LTlrich: 

Halysites catenulatus, large variety. 
 Halysites catenulatus, small variety. 
 Favosites (ramose species). 
 Syringopora sp. iindet. 
 Amplexus sp. nndet. 
 Cyathophyllum sp. undet. 
 Zaphrentis ? sp. undet. 
 Rhynchonella sp. xindet. 

At Tybo, about 15 miles south of Hot Creek, and also on the east 
 side of the range, the rocks appear to be mainly massive dark-blue 
 limestones with a general westerly dip. This locality was not visited, 
 but a single fossil obtained from these limestones was regarded by 
 Dr. Girty as jjrobably Ordovician, Maclurea aymulata ? 

From Tybo to the south end of the range, just west of Twin Springs, 
 in the Pancake Range, the east half of the mountains is entirely com- 
 posed of similar limestones. At the extreme south end the limestones 
 are overlapped by the rhyolites of the Kawich Range, which have 
 altered the sedimentary rocks. No fossils were found at this point, 
 but a specimen of the limestone was seen under the microscope to be 
 made up of tinj^ indeterminable organic remains. 

TERTIARY. 

On the eastern side of the range, extending from Hot Creek a num- 
 ber of miles in both directions, are gray hills composed of partly 
 consolidated coarse gravel and grit. This material often overlies 
 rhyolite, from which it is partly derived, and it rests against the steep 
 eroded base of the limestone mountains. The material is evidently 
 waterlaid. The same formation stretches southward and is visible 
 near Tj^bo as a strip of yellow dissected hills. At the pass between 
 the Hot Creek Range and the Kawich Range are large amounts of 
 horizontally stratified white waterlaid deposits composed of rhyolitic 
 fragments.'^' 

This formation is evidently the same as described in the neighbor- 
 hood of Twin Springs, in the Pancake Range, a few miles to the east. 

aThis formation is chiefly included under the color for volcanic rocks on the map. The nar- 
 row atrip near Tybo is not represented.
