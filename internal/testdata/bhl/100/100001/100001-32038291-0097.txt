spuRR.J HOT CREEK RANGE. 87 

IGNEOUS ROCKS. 

The whole north end. of the Hot Creek Range, beginning with a 
 point a few miles north of Hot Creek, is, so far as known, composed 
 entirely of volcanic rocks, including both rhyolite and basalt. There 
 has been much erosion since the outpouring, resulting in the carv- 
 ing of considerable valleys and the formation of large gulch dumps 
 (alluvial fans) at their mouths, exactly as in the case of the stratified 
 rocks. In jilaces, also, erosion has stripped away the upper layers of 
 lava and ash and has exposed symmetrical volcanic cones, which have 
 been preserved by this protecting covering. PI. V, .B, is aphotograi)h 
 of such a cone. The number of these small cones and the abundance 
 of ash, together with the thinness of the lava sheet, show that the 
 volcanic rock in this region came from many separate explosive 
 vents. 

In the neighborhood of Hot Creek, as before stated, the eastern half 
 of the range contains a considerable area of Silurian rocks. However, 
 rhyolile is found at the extreme eastern base, and the whole western 
 half of the mountain at this point is composed of several thousand 
 feet of the same rock. From here to the southern end of the range 
 the western part is of volcanic, while the eastern half is mostly strat- 
 ified. At the southern end the rh3^olite mantles around to the east to 
 join the lava of the Kawich Range. 

STRUCTURE. 

In Hot Creek Canyon the Silurian rocks form an anticlinal fold, 
 broken by two or three normal easterly dipping faults. The first of 
 these faults occurs at the eastern end of the canyon, and by it the 
 strata, including the P^ureka quartzite, are down-fanlted to the east 
 200 or 300 feet. This fault was also noted in the first canyon south of 
 Hot Creek. Three miles farther west occurs a second parallel fault. 
 This fault has a vertical separation of about 1,000 feet, as marked by 
 the Eureka quartzite, upthrown on the west. (See fig. 7.) 

From Hot Creek to the southern end of the range the structure was 
 not carefulljr examined, but for nearly the whole way the limestones 
 can be seen to dip in general westerly at an angle of from 15° to 20°. 
 It is probable that this dip represents the westerly limb of the anti- 
 clinal fold exi:)osed in Hot Creek Canj^on. 

ORES. 

Along Hot Creek Canyon are some vertical zones in which rich pock- 
 ets of ore are said to have been found. These zones are apparently 
 ancient channels of the hot springs, which still exist. South of this 
 jDoint the rocks are more or less mineralized all the way toTybo, where 
 there are some important ore deposits.
