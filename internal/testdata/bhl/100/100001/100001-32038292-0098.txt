PINON RANGE. 

The Pinon Range is mentioned in 
 this report only because its southern 
 end, wliieh extends beyond the south- 
 ern limit of the Fortieth Parallel 
 maps, is included in the accompany- 
 ing map. The writer did not visit 
 this range, and the following slight 
 summarj^ is taken chiefly from the 
 work of the Fortieth Parallel geol- 
 ogists. 

TOPOGRAPHY. 

The range consists of a single main 
 ridge, which is conspicuous north of 
 the fortieth parallel and lies next 
 west of the Humboldt Range. Far- 
 ther south the Diamond Range comes 
 in between the two. Near this x)oint 
 the Pinon Range becomes lower, and 
 its trend changes from south to south- 
 easterlj^ so that it swings around 
 and joins the Diamond Range near 
 Eureka. 

SEDIMENTARY ROCKS. 

In the neighborhood of Pinto Peak 
 there is exposed a thickness of about 
 14,000 feet of sedimentary rocks, ^ 
 comprising a section from the Cam- 
 brian up into the Carboniferous. 
 South of this the range is almost en- 
 tirely composed of Devonian rocks. 
 These Devonian rocks are continu- 
 ous southward to the junction with 
 the Eureka Mountains.*^ 

IGNEOUS ROCKS. 
 VOLCANIC ROCKS. 

Throughout most of the extent of 
 the range various volcanic rocks are 
 found, both at the east and the west 
 bases.
