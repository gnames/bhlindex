SPUKK] PINON, MONITOR, AND WALWEAH RANGES. 89 

STRUCTURE. 

As stated by Mr. Hague/' the range consists of open anticlinal and 
 s.vnclinal folds. South of Pinto Peak the structure is anticlinal, the 
 axis of the fold striking diagonally across the range S. 25Â° E., 
 while the general trend of the range at this point is west of south. It 
 is likely that the main anticlinal fold of the Diamond Range is the 
 direct continuation of this anticline. Farther south, along the Piiion 
 Range, this anticline gives way to an adjacent sjnicline, and farther 
 south again the eastern limb of this s^nicline is cut off by the ^"alley, 
 so that only the western or easterl}^ dipping limb remains. This por- 
 tion of the range, therefore, has the aspect of being monoclinal. 

A section made b}^ Mr. Walcott,* at Ravens Nest, just north of 
 Pinto Peak, shows the structure as a faulted anticline. 

MONITOR RANGE. 

The Monitor Range is a belt of mountains about 70 miles long, Ijdng 
 next west of the Hot Creek Range. It has its northern end just 
 south of the area shown on the Fortieth Parallel maps. The northern 
 part of the range, up to within a few miles of Altoona Pass, has the 
 aspect of a great west-sloping table which ends in a scarp on the 
 west, facing the vallej^. At Altoona Pass the range is narrower and 
 has a very sharp summit, with a steep descent on both sides. Farther 
 south the range grows lower and is broken b}^ frequent gaps, till it 
 passes into low volcanic hills and dies out in the Ralston Desert. 

Gilbert^ has observed a single spur of metamorphic rock on the west 
 side of the range at its southern end. Otherwise the whole southern 
 part of the range, as observed by Mr. Gilbert and the writer, is vol- 
 canic. At Altoona Pass the lava is a siliceous rhyolite like that of 
 the Hot Creek Range. 

It is probable that this range has been formed b}^ a series of vol- 
 canoes along a north-south line. The topograph}^ of the southern 
 part of the range (like that in the southern parts of the Toquima and 
 Pancake ranges) is extremel}" irregular, consisting in part of inter- 
 rupted mesas and ancient volcanic cones defaced by erosion. It is 
 plain from this topography that the lavas have escaped from many 
 different vents and have flowed together. Erosion of the lava has 
 gone on to a considerable extent, indicating the lapse of some time 
 since the cessation of volcanic activitj-. 

WAHWEAH RANGE. 

The name Wahweah Range is applied to an irregular cluster of hills 
 west of the southern end of the Piiion Range and just witliin the
