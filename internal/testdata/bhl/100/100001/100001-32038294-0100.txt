northern limits of the accompanyiDg map. It was not visited bj^ the 
 writer, and the following brief characterization is taken from the 
 reports of the Fortieth Parallel Survey: 

The range is about 30 miles long and at its northern end consists 
 mainly of granite, together with a heavy body of qnartzite, which was 
 referred to the Ogden Devonian on lithologic grounds, there being no 
 fossils. The sedimentary rocks are here flanked by flows of volcanics, 
 which farther south mantle over the stratified rocks and constitute 
 most of the surface, exposingthe underlying Paleozoic only in patches. '^ 

TOQUIMA RANGE. 

The Toquima Range is situated next west from the Monitor Range. 
 It has a trend a little east of north and a total length of about 80 
 miles. At its north end it passes into the level desert east of Austin, 
 and its south end is situated southwest of Belmont, on the borders of 
 Ralston Valley. The San Antonio Mountains are an irregular clump, 
 south of the Toquima Range, and ai-e separated from this range by 
 a gap only a few miles wide. Thej^ are surrounded on all sides by 
 detritus-covered plains. 

TOPOGRAPHY. 

The Toquima Range has comparatively great relief. In general it 
 consists of a single ridge of moderate breadth. At its southern end, 
 near the town of Belmont, this splits in two, the main ridge trending : 
 a little west of south toward the San Antonio Mountains, while a minor 
 one diverges and runs in a southeasterly direction into the Monitor 
 Range. Between the two ridges is a low valley, filled with Pleistocene 
 detritus. 

The range is essentially volcanic, but in places is ex]30sed a core of 
 Paleozoic rocks beneath, indicating that here, as in the Hot Creek 
 Range, the Antelope Mountains, and others, there existed a distinct 
 range of Paleozoic rocks before the lava efi'usion, which has now 
 almost completely masked the stratified rocks and given the range the 
 aspect of being primaril}' volcanic. 

SEDIMENTARY ROCKS. â€¢ 

The range was crossed by the writer only at one point. His route 
 lay from the town of Belmont, around the southern end of the range, 
 along the road to Cloverdale. Along this route no stratified rocks 
 could be seen in the range. North of Belmont all is apparently vol- 
 canic. This impression has been confirmed by reconnaissance notes 
 made bj'^ Messrs. Gilbert* and Emmons.^ Mr. Emmons suggests that
