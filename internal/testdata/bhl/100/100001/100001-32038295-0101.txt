the core of the range some distance north of Belmont may be com- 
 posed of stratified rocks, hut the first point where they have been 
 observed is just east of Belmont, where occurs a series of black limy 
 slates and gray finely crystalline limestone, banded black and white, 
 and often siliceous. The formation is preeminently a slaty one and 
 has often the aspect of a schist. This aspect is due to metamorpliisin, 
 occasioned by certain siliceous dikes of the granitic family. One 
 great dike is half a mile wide and runs in a north-south direction. 
 Near its junction the shaly limestones become transformed into jas- 
 peroid, and in places by the development of mica the rock j)asses into 
 mica-schist. Some of the jasperoid is also schistose, and contains 
 small bunches of red and j^ellow metallic oxides, which give it the 
 asj)ect of a knotted schist. 

The stratified rocks here are tilted at high angles. Where observed 
 by the writer they were mostly vertical, but Mr. Emmons found a 
 general easterlj" dip. 

In the slates Mr. Gilbert '^ found graptolites, which referred the 
 rocks to the Silurian age. According to Mr. Walcott,'^ the rocks prob- 
 ably correspond to a i)art of the nj)per Pogonip formation of Eureka. 
 Mr. Gilbert^ estimates the apparent thickness of the stratified series 
 at Belmont at 4,000 or 5,000 feet. 

On the road leading from Belmont southwest toward Cloverdale the 
 same series of strata is found at the eastern base of the main ridge. 
 The chief rock is compact limy black slate, often metamorphic and 
 schistose, corresponding closelj^ with the rocks just east of Belmont. 
 The metamorphism is evidently, as in the former case, connected uith 
 intrusive masses of granite and rhyolite. By these the slate is some- 
 times transformed into an unsheared jasperoid or to a quartz-schist 
 (the latter often containing actinolite and staurolite) and sometimes 
 into highly crystalline mica-schist. A mile south of the most north- 
 ern outcroj^ found the shales are overlain bj^ about 200 feet of massive 
 white quartzite, which is probably the Eureka formation. The quartz- 
 ites and underlying beds are exposed south of here for some distance 
 till they disappear under Pleistocene detritus on one side and volcanic 
 rocks on the other. Farther southwest, however, at the spring, is found 
 another small patch of the schistose slates capped by the quartzite. 
 This patch is surrounded on all sides by rhyolites, and is chiefiy altei-ed 
 into jasperoid seamed with iron. 

Looking eastward from the eastern base of the main ridge a portion 
 of the minor ridge which runs southeasterly from Belmont is seen to be 
 composed of stratified rocks similar to those just described. Aj)par- 
 ently the schists and the overljang white quartzite can be recognized.
