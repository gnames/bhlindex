IGNEOUS ROCKS. 

The whole northern part of the Toquima Range appears to be cov- 
 ered up by great flows of rhyolite. Just east of Belmont the foothills 
 bordering the area of stratified rocks are composed of rhyolite running 
 out to the north toward the main mass. Rhyolite is also found in 
 large quantities southwest of Belmont. This area stretches north 
 and, growing broader, joins the great mass whicli covers the northern 
 part of the range. To the south also it appears to stretch across the 
 gap to the San Antonio Mountains. Similai^ly, the rocks of the minor 
 ridge which runs southeast from Belmont are mainly rhyolitos, form- 
 ing a continuous body with the rhyolites of the Monitor Range. 

DIKE ROCKS. 

Near Belmont there is a considerable development of coarse-grained 
 granitic rocks. In several cases these are found to be intrusive into 
 the stratified I'ocks. A mile south of Belmont is an exposure of coarse 
 granite-porphyr}^ with sparse biotite and numerous large orthoclase 
 phenocrysts from 2 to 4 inches long. This may be continuous with 
 the great dike before noted as running north and south just east of 
 Belmont and having a width of half a mile. 

The rocks of this dike, however, are different, being finer grained 
 and in general more siliceous. They consist chieflj^ of quartz and 
 feldspar. In, some places the rock becomes mostl}^ quartz; in others 
 mainlj^ feldspar. Quartz veins are abundant, irregular, and segrega- 
 tional, and evidently are the results of crystallization contempora- 
 neous in a general way with the- crystallization of the rest of the rock. 
 Biotite is often sparsely present, and in some x^laces the rock contains 
 considerable muscovite and even passes into muscovitic quartz veins. 
 Thin sections of the rock examined show in one case a fine-grained 
 biotite-quartz-raonzonite; in another case siliceous muscovite-biotite- 
 granite, peculiar in having certain areas entirely of quartz. This 
 rock is evidently closely related with another which is essentially 
 composed of quartz and muscovite, Avith a little albite. This is a 
 variation of the muscovite-biotite-granite, in which muscovite has 
 largely taken the place of feldspar. The distinction between this 
 type and the micaceous quartz veins which occur in close connection 
 with it, is not sharp «. 

STRUCTURE. 

The Silurian shales which occur just east of Belmont have a strike 
 of N. 35° W., and change from vertical to a generally easterly dip. 
 Southwest of Belmont, on the eastern side of the main ridge, the same
