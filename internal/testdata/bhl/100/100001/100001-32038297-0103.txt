rocks luive a general uortli-soutli strike and a westerly dip of 20°. 
 The two locations, therefore, may be on the two limbs of an anticli- 
 nal fold. The fnrther strnctni-e of the stratified rocivs is concealed 
 beneath the lava flows. 

ORES. 

In the vicinity of Belmont there has been considerable ore dei^osi- 
 tion, which in the time of Nevada's prosperity made the region one 
 of considerable wealth. At present the mining indnstry is perfectly 
 dormant. During the period of activity the region was described by 
 Mr. Emmons." According to him the ores occur generally in white 
 quartz veins, often several feet in width, and consist princij)ally of 
 stetefeldtite (an argentiferous ore of antimony) with which is com- 
 bined lead, silver, copper, and iron. The metallic minerals are scat- 
 tered through the quartz in bunches or disseminated particles — rarely 
 in banded form. The veins are found cutting the Silurian shales and 
 limestones, and frequent!}' are close to tlie intrusive granitic dikes. 

It appears to the writer that there is a genetic connection between 
 the intrusive rocks and the inetalliferous quartz veins of this dis- 
 trict. ^ 

TOYABE RANGE. 

The Toyabe Range lies next west of the Toquima and extends south- 
 ward about the same distance. To the north, however, it has a greater 
 length, running along the western border of the desert into which the 
 Toquima Range merges at its northern end. Thus the entire length 
 of the Toyabe Range is about 100 miles. It lias a uniform north - 
 northeast trend. 

That portion of the Toj^abe Range which lies north of Austin has 
 been included in the general maps of the Fortieth Parallel Survey. 
 From Austin southward nearly to the southern end of the i^ange, the 
 mountains have been made the subject of a special study by Mr. 
 Emmons. '■ The writer observed the range at its extreme southern 
 end, and also its western base, along the valley which separates it 
 from the closely adjacent Reese River Range. 

TOPOGRAPHY. 

The topography of the Toyabe Range is marked by features of con- 
 siderable contrast, the mountains being sharp and high and the inter- 
 vening canyons deeply cut. Throughout most of its course the range 
 consists of a single ridge in its central portion. The southern ends of 
 this range and of the Reese River Range converge until they almost 
 unite. 

The southern part of the range is essentially volcanic; while the 
 rest is composed chiefly of granite and Paleozoic strata. The erosion
