of the lavas appears to have been quite as profound as that of the 
 stratified rocks, showing that a considerable period has elapsed since 
 the effusion of volcanic material. 

In the valley which separates the southern end of the Toyabe Range 
 from the corresponding portion of the Reese River Range there is a 
 higli divide, separating the north-flowing drainage of Reese River 
 from that which flows south into the desert plain at Cloverdale. The 
 south-flowing drainage runs in a canyon cut into the bottom of the 
 valley, with rhyolite walls which go up at angles of from 45° to 65° to 
 heights of 700 or 800 feet. At its bottom is a level floor covered with 
 wash and sagebrush, and in the center of this floor is an arroyo 5 or 
 6 feet deep. At Cloverdale this bottom is one-quarter of a mile 
 across, while 7 or 8 miles up it is barely 30 yards. The stream which 
 flows in this canyon is derived from a spring. This case is like one 
 described in the Snake Range region. 

Another noteworthy feature of the erosion of this range, according 
 to Mr. Emmons, is the occurrence of basins at the heads of some of 
 the canyons, which basins, he infers, were formerly occupied by glaciers. 
 At the mouth of one of the canyons Mr. Emmons "• found glacial strige, 
 which strengthened his belief. On most of the Great Basin ranges, as 
 is well known, there are no marks of glaciation.

All the stratified Paleozoic strata of the Toyabe Range were mapped 
 by the Fortieth Parallel geologists as Carboniferous, since (^arbonif- \ 
 erous fossils were the only ones found in the series. These occurred 
 in limestones. Beneath the limestones was a thick series of slates, 
 which were regarded as the same as those in the Toquima Range near 
 Belmont. The subsequent finding by Mr. Gilbert of fossils in the 
 Belmont slates determined them as Silurian. Beneath these slates, 
 in the Toyabe Range, Mr. Emmons has described a series of compact 
 white quartzites with some thin beds of white gi-anular limestone, the 
 series being several thousand feet thick. The quartzites underlie the 
 slate series in apj)arent conformity, and outcroi) in places along the 
 eastern face of the south half of the range. 

Farther north, beyond Austin, the high mountain called the Dome 
 has been described by Mr. Hague ^ as consisting of nearly white 
 quartzite beds, which seem to be bent into a broad anticlinal fold. 
 These are overlain by beds of siliceous and argillaceous slates, and 
 these by compact gray limestones. This is evidently the same series 
 as described by Mr. Emmons. The thickness of the quartzites is not 
 estimated, but must be great.
