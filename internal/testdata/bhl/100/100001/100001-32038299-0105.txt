SPURR.] TOYABE RANGE. 95 

No fossils were found in tliese quartzites, but in the Eureka section 
 no such quartzite exist except that of the basal Cambrian; and the 
 position of this series in tlie Toj^abe Range above probable Silurian 
 slates strengthens the belief that it also is Cambrian. 

SILURIAN. 

As before noted, Mr. Emmons has described, overlying the heavy 
 quartzites, an estimated thickness of 7,000 feet of limestone shales, 
 with siliceous clay slates, locally metamorphosed into schistose rocks. 
 Mr. Emmons regarded these slates as the same as at Belmont. In 
 these latter rocks Silurian fossils have since been found. In the 
 Eureka section the thickness of the Silurian is estimated at 5,000 feet. 

This slate series occupies the central portion of the ranee, the gen- 
 eral structure being anticlinal. 

DEVONIAN. 

Whether or not the Devonian exists in tliis range is not certain. 
 The i3resence of Carboniferous and probable Silurian makes it seem 
 veiy possible that the Devonian also conies in, although it has not 
 been" recognized. 

CARBONIFEROUS. 

Overljdng the slate series which has just been referred to the 
 Silurian, Mr. Emmons "' has described a compact dark-blue limestone 
 which lies conformably upon the slates and is exposed on both flanks 
 of the range on the two sides of the general anticlimil fold which is 
 the chief structural feature. In this limestone. Mr. Emmons found 
 Fusiilina cylindrica and 8yri7igopora. 

TERTIARY. 

Near the northern end of the range Mr. Hague ^ has described, 
 beneath i-hyolite, beds of volcanic ash which, although without deter- 
 minable fossils, he referred to the Miocene. These beds are older than 
 the rhyolite and have been disturbed, since their deposition, by the 
 intrusion of igneous rocks, so that they underlie unconformably sup- 
 posedly Pliocene strata, which are younger than the rhyolite. 

IGNEOUS ROCKS. 

A considerable portion of the Toyabe Range is made up of granite 
 and volcanic rocks. 

Mr. Emmons^ has described five bodies of granite, all intrusive into 
 Paleozoic strata. The rocks vary somewhat in texture and composi- 
 tion, but are generally markedly siliceous, being characterized by a
