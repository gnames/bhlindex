large ijroportiou of quartz, an almost entire absence of hornblende, 
 and a small j)roportion of mica. Associated with the granite are fine- 
 grained dikes. 

RHYOLITE. 

Volcanic rocks occur at intervals along the flanks of the range, but 
 the most important mass is at the southern end, where for 30 miles it 
 completely conceals the granite and the stratified rocks. 

Among the volcanic rocks, rhyolite is the only one that lias any 
 very wide distribution, so far as observed. Mr. Emmons notes tliat 
 rhj^olite occurs in exceptionally large masses and is of comparatively 
 uniform coarse texture, having a granitic a^jpearance in tlie hand 
 specimen. At the southern end of the range the present writer has 
 studied the rhyolites, which are here associated with tuffs. The gen- 
 eral type is biotite-hornblende-rhyolite, similar to the lava which forms 
 the southern end of the adjacent Toquima Range. 

AUGITE-BASALT. 

In the little valley which separates the southern end of the Toyabe 
 Range from the Reese River Range there was found, near the head 
 of the Reese River drainage, a small area of augite-basalt. 

RELATIVE AGE OF THE IGNEOUS ROCKS. 

As in the Toquima Range, the intrusive granites of the Toyabe 
 Range and the rhyolites show marked consanguinity in composition. ; 
 Each is characterized by biotite as the chief ferromagnesian mineral. 

The augite-basalt is decidedly younger than the rhyolite, since it ' 
 was poured out in a valley which has been deeply cut into the latter 
 rock. 

STRUCTURE. 

According to Mr. Emmons Â« the range owes its existence chiefly to 
 a lateral compression, which has thrown the stratified rocks into 
 north-south anticlinal and synclinal folds. In addition to this 
 there has been another pressure, coming from a different direction, 
 which has distorted and dislocated these folds. The main fold of the 
 range is an anticline, which occupies the whole central part of the 
 range. The axis of this fold has an extreme variation from northeast 
 at its northern end to northwest at its southern. South of here, at 
 Ophir Canyon, Mr. Emmons noted a syncline, probably adjacent to 
 the main anticline. This syncline, however, was probably formed by 
 the intrusion of granite. To the north of the central part of the 
 range, in the vicinity of Austin, another synclinal fold appears, which 
 also seems to be connected with a granitic intrusion. Farther north,
