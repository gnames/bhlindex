ORES. 

Formerly the ores of the Toyabe Range were of great economic 
 importance, but with the decline of the mining industries of Nevada 
 they have been almost forgotten. The principal mining region was in 
 the neighborhood of Austin, but mines were found from here south- 
 ward all along the range. Mr. Emmons has described many of the 
 deposits, which in nearly ever}^ case consist of veins of white quartz 
 carrying metallic sulphides in irregularly disseminated bunches and 
 streaks. In the vicinity of Austin, the oldest mining district in the 
 State, the veins are mostly in granite, and rich ores do not appear to 
 occur in other rocks. In other parts of the range, however, the veins 
 occur in the stratified rocks. Besides quartz as gangue mineral, man- 
 ganese spar and calc spar were noted, while the metallic sulphides 
 comprise proustite, pyrargyrite, stephanite, polybasite, tetrahedrite, 
 argentiferous galena, zinc blende, copper pyrites, and iron pyrites. 
 In some of the veins the chief silver-bearing mineral is a mixed sul- 
 phide of antimony, as is the case in the neighborhood of Belmont. 
 The veins are often faulted. 

As in the case with the ores at Belmont, there is probably an inti- 
 mate connection between the metalliferous quartz veins and the 
 intrusive rocks.
