 KAISTGES OF WEST-CKISTTRAL ISTEVADA. 

REESE RIVER RANGE. 

The Reese River Range lies next west of the Toyabe Range, from 
 which it is separated only by a narrow north-south valley at its 
 southern end. From here it extends in a direction a little east of 
 north about 100 miles into the area of the Fortieth Parallel surveys. 
 Farther north the same general line of elevations is continued in the 
 Shoshone Range. 

TOPOGRAPHY. 

So far as' observed, the Reese River Range is composed entirely of 
 igneous rocks, and the forms produced by erosion have therefore a 
 certain uniformit3^ The summits show peaks which resemble rem- 
 nants of ancient volcanic cones, and the valleys which furrow the 
 flanks are deeply cut. 

The valley which sepai-ates the Reese River Range from the Toyabe 
 Range at its southern end has considerable interest. Its broad 
 rounded form, as contrasted with the sharp incision of the lesser 
 mountain valleys, shows that it has not been jDroduced since the 
 effusion of the lavas, but existed previously; yet the bottom of the 
 valley consists of an unknown thickness of lava, similar to that of 
 the mountains on both sides. Subsequent to the iDcriod of effusion, 
 erosion has formed deep gorges in the valley bottom. 

Fifteen miles north of the southern end of the Reese River Range 
 there is in the valley a divide which separates the northward-flowing 
 drainage of Reese River from that which runs south. The southward- 
 flowing drainage is in a canyon which is cut below the main valley 
 floor 700 or 800 feet.Â® On the north side of the divide, the descent is 
 sharp into a broad, V-shaped valley cut in the rhyolite. Farther 
 north, where the mountains diverge, the valley suddenly widens, and 
 at the same time the topography of the base of the mountains on both 
 sides changes, a broad, gently sloping plateau taking the place of the 
 irregular hill topography of the higher valley. In the middle of this 
 plateau the valley in which the uppermost drainage of Reese River 
 flows is several miles wide.
