IGNEOUS ROCKS. 

So far as seen, the range is composed mainly of great masses of 
 rlij^olite, similar to the lava wliicli makes np the southern end of the 
 Toyabe Range. Along the eastern base of the mountains, at their 
 southern end, are abundant dejjosits of white volcanic ash. The erup- 
 tions whieli poured out the lava must, therefore, have been of an 
 explosive nature. 

In the valley between the Keese River Range and the Toyabe 
 Range, at a point southeast of lone, a flow of augite-basalt was found. 
 On the opposite side of the range, in the vicinity of lone, there is a 
 considerable body of the same rock. 

On the edge of the desert valley, 1 or 2 miles west from lone, there 
 is a basic lava which appears, upon microscopic examination, to be 
 biotite-andesite. 

The low ridges running south from Cloverdale to the Monte Cristo 
 Mountains are mainly flat volcanic mesas. As seen from tlie vicinity 
 of lone, the Reese River Range for 10 or 15 miles north is evidently 
 volcanic, and is x)robably mainly so up to the junction of the Fortieth 
 Parallel maj), where the Shoshone Range is represented as all rhyolite. 

AGE OF LAVAS. 

The augite-basalt on both sides of the range is plainly younger than 
 the rhyolite, and appears to lie against the flanks of the hills eroded 
 from it. 

ELLSWORTH RANGE. 

The name Ellsworth Range is here applied to the extreme southern 
 end of a series of rather disconnected ridges which farther north are 
 known as the Desatoya Mountains. This southern end, so named 
 from the decayed mining camj) of Ellsworth, is narrow, and consists 
 of a single ridge which reaches a moderately great altitude. 

In general the range seems to be composed of an ancient series of 
 volcanics and derived tuffs, Avith limestones. These are cut by dikes 
 and are capped and often entirely hidden by late volcanic flows. 

SEDIMENTARY ROCKS. 

The range was crossed by the writer between Ellsworth, on the east 
 side, and Downieville, on the west. On the road some miles west of 
 Ellsworth is a comparatively small outcrop of white granular lime- 
 stone, consisting of loosely cohering calcite crj^stals, which give a 
 granular appearance not unlike that of sandstone. This rock is asso- 
 ciated with an altered green rock of probable igneous origin, which 
 is cut by siliceous dikes and is frequently mineralized. The only 
 specimen of the green rock examined turned out to be made up of 
 epidote, quartz, and calcite, all probably secondary and resultant
