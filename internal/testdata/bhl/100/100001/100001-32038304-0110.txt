from alteratiou accompauying the introduction of tlie metallic sul- 
 phides which are frequently found disseminated in the rock. 

On the summit of the pass, separated from the locality just men- 
 tioned by a sheet of overlying basic lava, there is found, immediately 
 beneath the volcanic rock, a dense sandstone or tuff, which on micro- 
 scopic examination is found to consist of rounded quartz grains and 
 altered feldsj^ar fragments. This tuff contains occasionally angular 
 fragments of lava and also doubtful x^lant remains. 

From here to the foot of the comparatively steep scarp which occurs 
 along the western face of the range, there is a vertical distance of 
 nearly 2,000 feet. The section shows a single rock series, all prob- 
 ably of igneous origin. The rocks are reddish or greenish, often 
 trap like and nearly always contain abundant angular fragments of 
 lava, giving" the ajDpearance of a breccia. Rock having the appear- 
 ance of red sandstone is common, but when examined under the micro- 
 scope this is found to consist chiefly of highly altered feldspar frag- 
 ments, with some calcite and epidote, the whole being stained with 
 iron oxide. It is probable, therefore, that this rock is also a volcanic 
 tuff. More abundant than this ajjparent red sandstone is a dense, 
 greenish-looking rock, which microscopic examination shows to be 
 probably a hornblende-biotite-syenite-porphyry. Below the chief 
 mass of this igneous rock there is again found a great thickness of 
 f eldspathic tuff, which is highly colored in the hand specimen. Under 
 the microscope the tuft" is seen to be made up of rounded and broken 
 fragments of feldspar in a kaolinic matrix, the whole colored by iron 
 oxide. Below this again there is found white volcanic tuff, resem- 
 bling ash, but containing some rounded, apparently waterworn, 
 grains. 

The dij) of this series of igneous rocks and tuffs seems to be in gen- 
 eral to the west, although the folding on a small scale is considerable. 

At the base of the abrupt mountain scarp is found a moderately 
 thin-bedded siliceous limestone, without fossils. The general strike 
 is north and south, and the dip 20° to 30° W. This rock is found 
 continuously to the end of the foothills at Downieville, where dark- 
 blue limestone alternates with beds of white and gray granular 
 limestone or marble. 

In the whole series exposed in the Ellsworth Range no fossils were 
 found, except in the limestone just east of Downieville, where they 
 were too poorly preserved to warrant collection. 

The marble or white granular limestone at Downieville resembles 
 that described on the east side of the mountain, above Ellsworth. 
 In both places there is a north-south strike. The dip in the occur- 
 rence near Ellsworth is an easterly one of 4°, while near Downieville 
 it is westerly, averaging 20° or 30°. It may be, therefore, that the 
 two occurrences are on opposite sides of an anticlinal fold. If this 
 is the case, then the thick series of interstratified igneous rocks and
