tuffs wliicli constitutes the core of tlie mountain lies beneath the 
 limestone series. The volcanic series must be at least 2,000 feet thick, 
 the limestone series hardly less. 

If we had no other data than the preceding we would hardly be able 
 even to suggest the age of the rocks. We have, however, from the 
 researches of the Fortieth Parallel geologists, in the region not far 
 north, results which may help us in correlating. In this same range 
 near New Pass Peak, about 60 miles northeast, are Triassic strata 
 which Mr. Emmons has described in the following terms'' : 

The lowest exjiosiires show strata of a greenish, somewhat cherty qtiartzite. 
 Above these, forming the summit of the ridge, is a breccia-like conglomerate, 
 made np of greenish and purple clierty fragments, with a red cement, overlaid 
 by a thickness of abont 1,000 feet of qnartzite and conglomerate, weathering 
 with a peculiar yellowish-brown earthy surface. On the western slopes, imme- 
 diately miderlying the limestones, is a bed of purple, argillaceons roofing slate. 
 As exposed in Ammonite Canyon, there lies conformably above this a thickness 
 of 1.000 to 1,500 feet of dark grayish-bine, compact, earthy limestones of the 
 Star Peak grotip, which lithologically can not be distingiiished from the Car- 
 boniferous limestones. At the contact of the limestones with the qnartzites is a 
 band of yellow calcareous shales. 

The underlying greenish cherty quartzite and breccia-like con- 
 glomerate with red cement, described by Mr. Emmons, recalls the 
 central mass of tuffs and volcanic rocks near Ellsworth, while the 
 overlying, dark grayish-blue limestones are similar to those near 
 Downieville. Immediatel}^ above the limestones Mr. Emmons found 
 abundant Triassic fossils in a series of shales which were not 
 observed in the Downieville section 

The lower of the two series at l^ew Pass Peak has been correlated 
 by Mr. King with the Koiijar.o formation, and the underlying lime- 
 stone with the Star Peak formation, both formations occurring in 
 the Triassic of West Humboldt Range. Concerning the Koipato in 
 the West Humboldt Mountains, Mr. King writes that at the base it 
 consists of a vast thickness of quartzitic and argillaceous beds. 
 These purely sedimentary rocks are observed to i3ass lateral^ into a 
 rock which in hand specimens resembles an eruptive rock. 

This whole series contains no distinct beds of limestone, and wherever analyzed 
 is remarkably free from carbonate of lime. Its lower limit is nowhere seen and, 
 owing to the disappearance of the strata planes nnder extreme metamoi-phism, 
 there is no possible mode of arriving at its total thickness. The upper limit, 
 however, is sharply marked by an abrupt transition from the schists into a body 
 of dark carbonaceous limestone. To this whole underlying group of schists and 
 porphyroids we have given the title Koipato. from the Indian name of this range.'' 

Allowing for some slight difference in interpretation, Mr. King's 
 characterization of the Koii)ato formation applies to the rocks on the 
 western face of the range between Ellsworth and Downieville. Mr. 
 King believed that the transition from sedimentary argillites to
