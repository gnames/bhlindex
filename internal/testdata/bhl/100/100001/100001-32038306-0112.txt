102 GEOLOGY OF NEVADA SOUTH OF 40TH PARALLEL, [bull. 208. 

igneous rocks resulted from metamorphism, while in the case of the 
 rocks near Ellsworth those which possess igneous structure are almost 
 without doiTbt ancient volcanics, which pass above and below, and 
 probably laterally, into shales, conglomerates, and water-laid brec- 
 cias derived from these or similar igneous rocks. The whole series 
 therefore is conceived to represent the products of a period of ancient 
 volcanic activity. 

The series is more indurated, altered, and oxidized than any of the 
 Tertiary volcanic series, and no similar rocks 'are known in the Paleo- 
 zoic of Nevada. Their correlation with the established Triassic for- 
 mations is therefore j)lausible. 

IGNEOUS ROCKS. 

The oldest igneous rocks of the range are those just described as 
 interstratified with the tuffs of the great ancient volcanic series. The 
 only specimen examined is probably a hornblende-biotite-sj^enite- 
 porphyry. 

Next younger than these ancient. volcanics come siliceous dikes, 
 which are well exposed on the eastern face of the -range, near Ells- 
 worth. The most easterly outcrop encountered is an alaskite-por- 
 phyrjT^ "â–  containing feldspar phenocrysts which are sometimes as much 
 as 4 or 6 inches long. This resembles the granitic rock described 
 south of Belmont. It is cut b}^ several narrow dikes of liner-grained 
 rock having the same composition, but not porphja'itic. These silice- 
 ous dikes are intrusive into metamorphosed green rock just west of 
 Ellsworth, the siliceous rock cutting the other in numerous dikes. 

Covering the ancient volcanic rocks and the later alaskite dikes 
 there is found, occupying the center of the mountain between Ells- 
 worth and Downieville, a bed of volcanic ash. Above this, forming 
 the crest of the range and constituting all the high peaks, is a mas- 
 sive, columnar-jointed volcanic rock. A specimen of this proved on 
 examination to be hyperstheue-aleutite.^ In the western foothills, 
 near Downieville, is also probably a patch of similar, comj)aratively 
 young volcanic rock, and north of Downieville the low limestone 
 mountains are succeeded after a few miles by a chain of lower hills, 
 which are, in part at least, volcanic. These extend northward at least 
 10 or 15 miles. At the southern end of the Desatoya Range, as mapijed 
 by the Fortieth Parallel geologists, the rocks are all volcanic, envelop- 
 ing the Triassic strata exposed in the region of New Pass Peak. 

STRUCTURE. 

Apparentlj^ the main structure of the range is anticlinal, the 
 ancient volcanic series constituting the core, from which the overly- 

a Alaskite is a general name proposed for rocks consisting essentially of quartz and alkali feld- 
 spar, without essential ferromagnesian minerals. J. E. Spurr, Classification of igneous rocks

6Aleutite is the name proposed for a rock intermediate between andesite and basalt. J. E.
