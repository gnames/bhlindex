ing limestones dip away on both sides. Tnst north of Downieville the 
 low limestone monntaius are separated from the main range by a shal- 
 low and relatively broad valley. The structure of these low mountains 
 is anticlinal, and between this anticline and the one comprised in the 
 main ridge is a syncline, in which the intervening vallej^ lies. 

ORES. 

On both sides of the range there are ore deposits, once of great 
 economic value, now largely abandoned. The mines near Ellsworth 
 seem to be in the ancient igneous formation, and these old rocks show 
 on exposed surfaces carbonate of copper and on fi-esh breaks copper 
 pyi-ite. Between Downieville and the top of the mountains also there 
 are ore deposits in the ancient volcanic series. At Downieville ores 
 are found in the limestone, resulting apparently from replacement 
 of the rock by sulphides. 

PILOT MOUNTAINS. 

East of the Excelsior Range, on the other side of Soda Springs Val- 
 ley, lies a short but comiaaratively rugged mountain range which has 
 a north-south trend, changing to northwest in its northern portion. 
 On the south the foothills of this range merge into those of the Oan- 
 delaria Mountains, and are separated from the northern end of the 
 Monte Cristo Mountains only by a narrow gai3. On the north, the 
 Pilot Mountains pass into the volcanic hills of the Galibs Valley 
 Range. 

The highest portion of the range is Pilot Mountain, which lies just 
 east of Sodaville. On the west face of this mountain there is a bold 
 scarp (very likely a simple fault scarp), which rises from a point which 
 has an estimated elevation of about 6,000 feet above sea level. Below 
 this point there are immense gulch dumps, or alluvial fans, covering 
 the other valley detritus, and reaching several miles westward toward 
 the center of the valley. 

SEDIMENTARY ROCKS. ' 
 EARLY TERTIARY OR MESOZOIC SERIES. 

Most of Pilot Mountain is made up of stratified rocks. At the base 
 is a series of gray rocks which, on account of a slight east-west flex- 
 ure, transverse to the general north-south line of folding, passes down 
 to the north and south so as to be covered by the valley detritus. 
 These rocks are hard to identify in the field on account of their altered 
 character, but microscopic study shows them to consist mainly of vol- 
 canic tuffs, generally coarse, sometimes fine and slaty. They grade 
 into solid lavas. A specimen of one of the lava sheets on examina- 
 tion seems to be andesite. In the field no sharp line can be drawn 
 between the tuffs and the slaty lavas. These rocks are cut by many 
 dikes of siliceous granite.
