Overlying tliis gray tnffaceous series are reddish sandstones, shales, 
 and conglomerates, which in tnrn are overlain by a considerable 
 thickness of purer red sandstone and quartzite, which forms the sum- 
 mit of the mountains. An estimation of the thickness of the different 
 rock series in this section gives 1,000 feet for the basal tnffaceous 
 series, 1,000 feet for the sandstone, shale, and conglomerate series, and 
 also 1,000 feet for the purer red sandstone series, making a total of 
 2,000 feet of red sandstone, shale, and conglomerate overlying 1,000 
 feet of the gray tufifaceous series. 

Where the rocks immediately overlying the basal grsty series were 
 examined at the base of the mountain they were found to be red or 
 white sandstone and quartzite, sometimes fine and calcareous, some- 
 times coarse and gritty. There is also much red sandstone con- 
 glomerate, indurated and squeezed. The pebbles of the conglomerate 
 seem to be entirelj^ of quartzite and chert. This reddish sandstone 
 and shale series aj^pears to extend northward several miles, until 
 overlain by later volcanic rocks. On the south it does not extend so 
 far, being overlain in the foothills of the Pilot Range along the road 
 between Sodaville and Columbus by later liorizontally stratified 
 sediments. 

The upper 2,000 feet of red sandstone, shale, and conglomerate is 
 perhaps the same series as that described as occurring in tlie Excel- 
 sior Mountains, just across the valley to the west. The underlain g 
 gray tnffaceous series is not found in the Excelsior Mountains. Litho- 
 logically, some of the tuffs correspond to andesitic tuffs found in the 
 folded Earlier Tertiary series of the Monte Cristo Mountains, 20 miles 
 south of Pilot Peak. At the same time, the series has a verj^ strong 
 lithologic resemblance to the supposedly Triassic beds of the Ells- 
 worth Range, into which the Pilot Mountains are almost directlj^ con- 
 tinuous on the north. 

Mr. H. W. Turner has recently reported Jurassic limestone and slate 
 in the Pilot Mountains. " In a personal letter to the writer, Mr. Tur- 
 ner states that at the north base of the mountains he found abundant 
 fossils in limestone, which Avere examined by Prof. J. P. Smith, of 
 Stanford University, who pronounced them certainly Jurassic. 

PLIOCENE. 

On the southern side of Soda Springs Valley, horizontally stratified 
 rolled gravels were found at an elevation of about 5,250 feet, and 
 were referred to the Pliocene sediments of Shoshone Lake. Similar 
 sediments undoubtedly exist at the base of Pilot Mountain, but they 
 have been covered ujp by the enormous subsequent Pleistocene gulch 
 dumps, which form a belt along the foot of the mountain. The material 
 in these dumps manifestly represents the larger portion of that 
 removed from the gulches which cut back into the scarp of the inoun-
