tain above. The erosion of these g'lilches is, therefore, mainly 
 Pleistocene. 

At the southern end of the Pilot Mountains, along the road between 
 Sodaville and Columbus, is a considerable area of horizontally strati- 
 fied fine silts and hardened clays, with some volcanic ash beds. This 
 formation constitutes the divide between Soda Springs Valley and 
 Columbus Valley, and reaches as high an elevation as 6,000 feet, where 
 it is overlain by a sheet of basalt. These beds are evidently the result 
 of deposition in a still bodj^ of water, and are correlated with the sim- 
 ilar Pliocene beds described elsewhere in this region. 

IGNEOUS ROCKS. 

PLEISTOCENE OLIVINE-BASALT. 

At the southern end of the range, overlying probable Pliocene sedi- 
 ments, occurs a thin-bedded, dark, vesicular lava, which proves to be 
 olivine-basalt. From its occurrence there is no doubt that this rock 
 should be classified with the other Pleistocene basalts of the region. 

GRANITIC ROCKS. 

Pilot Mountain contains many branching dikes and irregular masses 
 of intrusive granitic rock, similar to that across the vallej^ in the 
 eastern end of the Excelsior Range. A typical specimen, examined 
 microscopicallj', proves to be a biotite-granite. The intrusives seem 
 to be chiefly confined to the base of the mountain, and not to have 
 reached, in veiy great quantity, the uppermost strata. The granite 
 is accompanied hj alaskite,^' and in the vicinity of these intrusions 
 are ore deposits, as in the case of the east end of the Excelsior Moun- 
 tains; and the ore has probably had a genetic connection with the 
 igneous rock. 

MONTE CRISTO MOUNTAINS. 

The Monte Cristo Mountains are comparatively short and low. 
 The}" have a general north-south trend, and extend from the Pilot 
 Mountains on the north to the Silver Peak Range on the south, with 
 a total length of about 30 miles. 

SEDIMENTARY ROCKS. 

On the road between Columbus and Silver Peak there is a com- 
 parativelj' low gap in the Monte Cristo Range. In this gap are 
 found low hills of white shale capped by a porous bed which, examined 
 microscopically, proved to be a calcareous andesite tufi". From this 
 rock a collection of poorly preserved fossil shells was made, which 
 Dr. W. H. Dall was not able to identify with cei-tainty. Dr. Dall 
 thought the forms suggested a fresh-water origin. He found a 

a Rock consisting essentially of quartz and alkali feldspar, without essential ferromagnesian 
 minerals.
