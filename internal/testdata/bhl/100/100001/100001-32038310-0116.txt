bivalve, which may be a Sphcerium, and a gasteropod that may be a 
 Planorhis. The shales contain frequent leaves and occasional coal 
 seams. 

These sediments are capped by volcanic rocks. In the low pass 
 above referred to the immediately overlying rock is a light-gray 
 tordrillite. " Above this comes andesite. 

At the northern end of the Monte Cristo Range there appears to be 
 a patch of stratified rocks similar to those just described, the inter- 
 vening space being completelj^ covered by lavas. 

This series has been examined somewhat carefully by Mr. H. W. 
 Turner, who has named it the Esmeralda formation. He finds that 
 it is shown at various points in the Silver Peak Range, and that it 
 comprises a considerable variety of sediments.* According to him 
 the series exposed aggregates at least 2,000 feet, and is composed 
 chiefly of sandstone, with some shale. The top is made u]3 of laeus- 
 tral marls and white shales. Mr. Turner collected from these rocks 
 fossil shells, fish bones and scales, and dicotyledonous leaves, which 
 were examined by Dr. J. C. Merriam, Prof. F. A. Lucas, and Dr. F. H. 
 Knowlton. Dr. Merriam lound that the fossil shells indicate an early 
 Miocene or a late Eocene age for the beds, and Dr. Knowlton found 
 that the plant remains indicate a Middle Tertiary age. The fish 
 remains, so far as yet studied, do not seem determinate. 

The Avriter has observed in the region south of liere, notablj^ in the 
 neighborhood of Death Vallej^ and in the Mojave Desert, upturned 
 Tertiary sediments which he is inclined to correlate with the beds of 
 the Esmeralda formation in the Silver Peak and Monte Cristo 
 Mountains. 

IGNEOUS ROCKS. 

The greater portion of the Monte Cristo Mountains is covered by 
 volcanic rocks. In general, dark basic lava seeuis to overlie lighter- 
 colored siliceous lava. 

DESERT MOUNTAINS. 

The Desert Mountains form an irregular group which runs from 
 the southern end of Mason Valley southeastward to near the north- 
 western end of the Gabbs Yallej^ Range at the northern end of Walker 
 Lake. In general these mountains have slight relief, although north 
 of Mason Valley the peaks reach a considerable height. At the 
 southern end the mountains change into low mesas of brilliant color. 

These mountains are composed entirely of well-bedded volcanic 
 rocks. At the extreme northwestern end specimens examined prove 
 to be biotite-hypersthene-andesite. Along the southeastern end, near 

"Tordrillite differs from a rhyolite in being more siliceous and containing no essential dark 
 minerals. J.E. Spurr, Am.Geol., Vol. XXV, 19(10, No. 3. p. 230.
