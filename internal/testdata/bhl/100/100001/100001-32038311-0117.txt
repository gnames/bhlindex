GABBS VALLEY AND GABBS VALLEY RANGE. 

Gabbs Valley is a broad, flat-bottomed basin, almost comi^letely sur- 
 rounded by irregularly distributed volcanic mountains. The higher 
 mountains to the south of the vallej^ constitute the Gabbs Valley 
 Range, which extends from AValker Lake southeastward for about 40 
 miles to the Pilot Mountains. The topography of this range, as well 
 as of the hills on the north side of the valley, is comparatively primi- 
 tlA^e, the valleys being regular and in general not vei-y deepl}' cut, 
 recalling the erosion topography of the sui3posedly I'liocene lake 
 deposits of Pleasant Valley in the Snake Range.

 EARLIER TERTIARY MARLS. 

Near the center of the valley, just east of the low mountain spur 
 which crosses it, and on the Reese River road, there are low ridges of 
 gi-ay, stratified marl containing leaf remains, alternating with gravels 
 and more solid conglomerates. Some of the conglomerate contains 
 comparatively alnindant silicified wood. The conglomerate, when 
 examined microscopically, proves to be volcanic. The pebbles are 
 made up in part at least of spherulitic glass. Some pebbles contain 
 plienocrj^sts of feldspar, of species indicating that the lava is ande- 
 sitic, in a glassy matrix containing broken feldspar and biotite. 
 Some of the shaly beds associated with the conglomerate are felds- 
 pathic tuff, made up of fine fibrous material, with larger In-oken frag- 
 ments of feldsi^ar and some shreds of l)iotite. These beds strike north 
 and south and dip about 8Â° E. 

No fossils were obtained from these beds. The locality is, how- 
 ever, at a higher altitude than that of tlie Pleistocene lake which, 
 according to Professor Russell,'^' covered tlie lowest part of the valley 
 just west of here. Also, the beds seem to show a general tilting, and 
 since, according to Mr. King,'''' the last marked folding in this area was 
 j)ost-Mlocene, these beds are verj'- iikelj^ pre-Pliocene. They liave the 
 aspect of lacustrine marls. Lithologically, they coincide with the 
 descriptions given by Mr. King of his typical Truckee Miocene, which 
 consists of sandstones, conglomerates, and tuffs at the base, witli an 
 enormous thickness of volcanic tuffs at the top, the whole series 
 being as much as 2,000 or 3,000 feet thick. The typical Miocene 
 localities of King are situated near here to the north. Therefore the 
 beds under consideration are provisionally^ correlated with those 
 described b}^ Mr. King. They have also a general resemblance in 
 their nature, derivation, degree of induration, and especially in their
