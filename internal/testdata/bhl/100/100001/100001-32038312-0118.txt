PLEISTOCENE. 

In the lowest portion of Gabbs Valley, west of the Tertiary marls 
 just described, is a broad alkali flat or playa, covered with smooth, 
 hard mud. This was perhaps the bottom of a lake inclosed in the 
 Gabbs Valley Basin. As mapped by Professor Russell, it was contem- 
 poraneous with the great Lake Lahontan, but separated from it. 

At the base of the volcanic mountains there is a continuous apron 
 of detrital material sloping away at an angle of about 3|° for a mile 
 or two toward the middle of the basin. As in the case of the similar 
 alluvial deposits investigated hj Mr. Russell,^' these aprons seem to 
 be older than the great Pleistocene lakes. 

The effect of eolian action, of importance everywhere in the Great 
 Basin, is very conspicuous in certain portions of Gabbs Valley. 
 The Avind-blown sands have in many places accumulated in consider- 
 able mass. 

IGNEOUS ROCKS. 

Most of the mountains surrounding Gabbs Valley, including the 
 Gabbs Valley Range, are volcanic. These rocks represent a variety 
 of species. 

Just east of the hot spring in the valley the road passes through a 
 gap in the mountains about 1,500 feet deep, the sides of which rise at 
 an angle of about 50°. The rock at this j)oint varies from moderately 
 fine to moderately coarse, but it is, nevertheless, always holocrj^stal- 
 line. It is massive and verticall}^ jointed, yet has a distinct horizon- 
 tal bedding, and a little northeast of here it seems to be underlain by 
 ash. It is therefore probably effusive. A single specimen of this 
 rock, examined microscopically, proves to be a hornblende-biotite- 
 quartz-monzonite. 

On the mountain ridge which separates Gabbs Valley from Walker 
 Lake Valley the lavas which dip eastward into the former basin at 
 angles of 10° or more, in color gray or oxidized bright red, prove to 
 be biotite-, hypersthene-, and hornblende-aleutites and andesites. On 
 all the mountains to the north of here, which were not visited, there 
 appears to be a basal light-gray or red lava, which forms the highest 
 peaks, underlying a dark-brown or black lava which forms the fringes 
 of the mountains and sometimes constitutes a cone 3^et only slight]}^ 
 defaced. 

Where tlie road crosses the extreme western end of the Gabbs Val- 
 ley Range, overlooking Walker Lake, the lavas are mixed and the 
 hills variegated, the colors being bright red, yellow, gray, greenish
