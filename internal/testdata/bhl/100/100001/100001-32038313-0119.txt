yellow, white, and black. In geueral a liglit-gray lava is overlain by 
 dense black flows. The former jiroved to be biotite-andesite, while 
 the latter is augite-basalt. A little farther, biotite-rhyolite was found, 
 api^arently underlying the basalt. 

EXCELSIOR RANGE. 

The name Excelsior Range is aj^plied to a short, rather irregular 
 group of mountains which lies south of Walker Lake, and, unlike the 
 most of the ranges of this region, runs in a general east-Avest direction, 
 cutting off the southern end of Walker Lake Valley and extending 
 from the southern end of the Walker River Range eastward to Soda 
 Springs Valley. The entire length of the range is only about 30 miles. 
 The main range has to the north of it several high spurs which run 
 off at right angles and connect with a lower east-west ridge parallel 
 to the main one, farther north. To the south also a number of north- 
 south spurs connect the Excelsior Mountains with the Candelaria 
 Mountains. The main range is terminated on the east by a bold 
 scarp overlooking Soda Springs Valley, corresponding to the west- 
 facing scarp of the Pilot Mountains on the other side. 

These mountains Avere crossed by the writer on the road between 
 Hawthorne and Sodaville, which leads through Excelsior Flat. 

SEDIMENTARY ROCKS. 
 LIMESTONE SERIES (EARLY TERTIARY?). 

If one travels along the above-mentioned road from Walker River 
 Valley eastward, he finds, after passing through a belt of lava which 
 constitutes the foothills, an area of thin-bedded, shaly, sometimes 
 compact, blue limestone. This limestone is overlain by a lava sheet, 
 and near the contact is baked and silicified to a greenish or brown 
 jasperoid containing segregated nodules of silica. The stratification 
 is nearly horizontal, but shows local contortion and horizontal fault- 
 ing, suggested breaking and shoving by the overriding lava sheet. 

Near the contact, partly in the blue shaly limestone, partly in the 
 same rock transformed into jasperoid by the contact metamorphism, 
 were found fossils. Mr. T. W. Stanton, of the National Museum, 
 reports on these as follows: 

Fossil lot No. 46, from the Excelsior Range, road between Hawthorne and 
 Sodaville, evidently represents two distinct beds, one a hard brown siliceo-argilla- 
 ceous rock and the other a dark-blue limestone. The former contains several 
 specimens of a Corbula, another undetermined bivalve, and a very imperfect 
 Gasteropod that may be a Natica or a Vivapar us,, th.Q generic character not pre- 
 served. These are probably not earlier than Cretaceous, and they may be Tertiary. 

The blue limestone fragments yielded a small Neritina, a Hydrohia (?) , an 
 Astarte (?) , and several imperfect specimens of two or three other small bivalves. 
 These fossils have a Tertiary aspect. They are certainly not older than Cretaceous.
