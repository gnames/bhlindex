In answer to a query as to tlie conditions of deposition indicated by 
 the fossils Mr. Stanton writes : 

The fossils in lot 46 are either marine or brackish-water form, not fresh water. 
 If I could be sure that the bivalve I have called Astarte (?) really belonged to that 
 genus there would be no doubt that they are marine. The other genera recog- 
 nized live in both salt and brackish water. 

To the east tliis limestone forms a well-defined anticline, with a 
 north-south axis, and with dips of 20° to 30° on both sides. Still 
 farther east the limestone is again overlain by the volcanic rock 
 wdiich encircles this area. 

In the bottom of Excelsior Flat, near its eastern side, probablj^ the 
 same limestone series is found, but more altered and crushed and 
 veined by dynamic action. Badly i^reserved fossils were collected 
 from this rock, but could not be identified. 

The thickness of this limestone series was roughly estimated at 
 2,000 feet. 

SANDSTONE-SHALE SERIES (EARLY TERTIARY OR MESOZOIC?) . 

Along the western border of Excelsior Flat is found a belt of red 
 sandstone which underlies the lavas. This sandstone belt is contin- 
 uous to the low mountains south of here, where it passes upward into 
 a series of gray vStratified rocks. Farther east the sandstone series, 
 with the overlying gray rocks, seems to overlie the probable Tertiary 
 limestones which outcroj) along the eastern portion of Excelsior Flat, 
 the older rock being apparently the core of an east- west striking anti- 
 clinal fold, and the sandstone series forming the northern limb. On 
 the southern limb, which comprises the main ridge of the Excelsior 
 Mountains, the bulk of the rocks seem, as viewed from a distance, 
 also to belong to the stratified red sandstone and shale series. 

Following the road farther east, the transverse sjiur which runs 
 northward from the main ridge of the Excelsior Mountains exhibits 
 the same east- west striking anticline. Along the axis a canyon has 
 been cut through the spur, and here are exjjosed red sandstones, with 
 much red, yellow, brown, and green dense siliceous shales. No fossils 
 could be found. The rocks here stand, in general, nearly vertical, 
 and are crumj)led and faulted. South of here the rocks have a 
 southerly dij), first steep, then shallowing, while to the north the 
 rocks belonging to the same series have for a considerable distance a 
 northerly dip, which afterwards reverses so that a body of underl3'- 
 ing gray shale, which may belong to the probable Tertiary limestone 
 series, comes into the visible section. 

From the data above noted, we appear to have a series of red sand- 
 stones and quartzites, with some shales and conglomerates, having a 
 roughly estimated thickness of 1,500 feet. These are overlain by a 
 series of red -gray sandstones, shales, and conglomerates about 2,000 
 feet in thickness, making a total of about 3,500 feet. These rocks
