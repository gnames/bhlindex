seem to overlie the probable Tertiary limestones aud are folded 
 together with them. The exact contact of the tAvo series, however, 
 was not found. No such sediments as this sandstone-shale are known 
 in the Paleozoic section, and therefore the rocks would, without any 
 other consideration, at once be considered as Mesozoic or Tertiary. 
 In the region just south of here a series of folded shales and tuffs 
 has been described by Mr. Turner" under the name of the Esmeralda 
 formation and is probably Miocene, possibly reaching back into the 
 Eocene. 

This series, when observed by the i^resent Avriter, struck him as 
 resembling in a general way the thin sandstones and parti-colored 
 shales of the Excelsior Range section, although the latter are dis- 
 tinctly more highly indurated and altered. 

Rocks similar to the sandstone-shale series of the Excelsior Railge 
 form a large portion of Pilot Mountain, just to the east of here, across 
 Soda Springs Valley. As noted in the description of the Pilot Range, 
 Mr. H. W. Turner found Jurassic fossils in some of these beds. 

It is therefore not certain whether the sandstones and shales of the 
 Excelsior Mountains are Tertiary or Mesozoic, and they may be partly 
 one and partly the other. 

While the series of tuffs, sandstones, shales, and conglomerates of 
 the Excelsior Range may possibly be the equivalent of the somewhat 
 similar strata of the Esmeralda formation near Silver Peak, the lime- 
 stone of the former locality is not represented in the latter. This 
 limestone also sejjarates itself from the probable fresh- water Esmer- 
 alda formation in that its fauna denotes a i3robable marine origin. 
 In this respect, also, it seems to be different from the rest of the known 
 Tertiary strata, which extend in a more or less continuous belt from 
 this district south into the Mohave Desert, and the present aspect of 
 our knowledge indicates that it represents a period during which 
 conditions were quite different from those which followed. 

PLIOCENE. 

On the western side of Excelsior Flat the lava is underlain by a 
 solid but friable deposit, consisting of ash and pumice, having the 
 appearance of being waterlaid. This occurs at an elevation of about 
 5,500 feet. In the valley below and to the east of this are less con- 
 solidated, horizontally stratified gravels, containing pebbles of lava 
 and reaching up nearly to the same elevation. 

On the eastern flanks of the Excelsior Mountains, overlooking Soda 
 Springs Valley, there was noted, at an elevation of 5,250 feet, hori- 
 zontally stratified gravels and volcanic tuffs, lying uuconformably 
 against the folded Tertiary series and partially consolidated. The 
 regular stratification of these deposits suggests that they are lake
