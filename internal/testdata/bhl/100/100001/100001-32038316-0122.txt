sediments, aud they are probably to be correlated with similar sedi- 
 ments found all over the region north and west of here, which have 
 been called Pliocene. 

IGNEOUS ROCKS. 

Along the road between Hawthorne and Sodaville, which passes 
 through Excelsior Flat, there is, on the west border of the hills, a belt 
 of fine-grained lava, which forms broad, slightly dissected mesas. A 
 specimen of this lava proved to be pja-oxene-olivine-basalt. It occu- 
 pies a large area, inclosing the body of probable Tertiary limestone, 
 whicli it overlies, and toward the east forms a considerable portion of 
 the main ridge of tlie Excelsior Mountains, of the spurs which run 
 north from it, and of the parallel east-west ridge with which these 
 spurs connect. It overlies the probable Tertiary sandstones and 
 shales and the stratified, water-laid tuffs and gravels of the Pliocene. 
 South of the main range the earlier Tertiary series is again overlain 
 by slightly dissected lava, and this lava runs southward into the Can- 
 delaria Mountains, where a prominent peak has the aspect of a 
 slightly denuded volcanic cone. 

The fact that this lava overlies all the stratified rocks, even the 
 supposedly Pliocene gravels, together with its very slight erosion, 
 shows that it is very young, probably early Pleistocene. The comi)o- 
 sition of the lava bears out this reasoning, for it is probably to be 
 correlated with the Pleistocene basalts described in other ranges.*^ 

GRANITIC ROCKS. 

As seen from Excelsior Flat, a considerable portion of the highest 
 part of the Excelsior Mountains to the southwest consists of gray, 
 rugged- weathering granitic rocks. At the abrujit eastern end of the 
 main range the earlier Tertiary sandstone and shale series is contorted 
 and apparently cut by granitic dikes. 

STRUCTURE. 

To the north of the main ridge, the general east-west valley, which 
 is in part occupied by Excelsior Flat, seems to lie along the axis of an 
 anticlinal fold with east-west strike. The main ridge lies on the 
 southern limb of this fold, while the minor ridge lying north of the 
 valley and parallel to the main one, is on the northern limb. 

Northwest of Excelsior Flat the area of probably Tertiary lime- 
 stone first described^ forms one of the north-south spurs which run 
 at right angles to the main range. The structure of this spur is anti- 
 clinal, but the strike of the fold is north and south.
