ORES. 

There lias been considerable mineralization in the Excelsior Moun- 
 tains. On the west side, along the road traveled, there has been 
 mineralization in the limestoue near the contact with the overlying 
 lava. Farther east the red sandstones are found to be bleached and 
 to contain disseminated copper minerals. On the eastern end of the 
 main range are ore deposits, associated with crnmpling of the strata 
 and probably with granitic dikes. 

RESUME. 

The rocks of the mountains are probably Early Tertiary limestones, 
 together with a series of sandstones and shales with some conglomer- 
 ates. The relative age of the limestones and sandstone shales is 
 uncertain. These two series were folded together. While the main 
 folds trended east and west, a minor set had north-south axes. At 
 about the same time came the intrusion of granitic rocks as dikes and 
 larger masses; the ore deposition was also probably nearly contem- 
 poraneous. After this came deep and long-continued erosion, bring- 
 ing about the present topography and followed by the formation of 
 the Pliocene lake. Finally this lake receded and great sheets of 
 basalt were poured out. 

CANDELARIA MOUNTAINS. 

The term Candelaria Mountains is here applied to an irregular 
 group, reaching from the California-Nevada State line eastward to 
 the Columbus Valley. It lies Just north of the White Mountain 
 range and south of the Excelsior Mountains. 

SEDIMENTARY ROCKS. 
 CAMBRIAN. 

Mr. F. B. Weeks, who visited the mountains in 1899, has informed 
 the writer of the existence of a considerable thickness of quartzite 
 and limestone (see PL I). No identifiable fossils were found. 

CARBONIFEROUS. 

On the road between Columbus and Candelaria there occnr dark- 
 graj^ nearly black, quartzites, and stretched conglomerates, with 
 some coarse sandstones and nearly white fine-grained chert. Mr. 
 H. W. Turner has kindlj^ supplied the writer with the following note 
 concerning the disco veiy of Carboniferous fossils in this rock: 

I am indebted to William Grozenger for information as to tliis locality, which 
 lies 3 miles northwest of Columbus by the trail to Candelaria, at an elevation of 
 about 4,900 feet. Similar fossils also occur in the gulch just north of this point at
