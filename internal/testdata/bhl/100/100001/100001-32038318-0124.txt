an elevation of aboiit 5,300 feet. These fossils were referred to Mr. Charles Schu- 
 chert, of the United States National Museum, who reports that the collection 
 contains two Carbonic species, a Productus and a Spirifer. Both are specifically 
 tindeterinined at present. The Spirifer (apparently a new species) belongs to the 
 S. eavieratus section, fossils recognized as characteristic of the Upper Carbonic. 
 The Productus is apparently identical with one from the region north of Mount 
 Shasta, in California, also associated with Upper Carbonic species. These forms 
 remind one more of the Carboniferous fauna found in the Shasta region than of 
 the Carboniferous farther east. 

EARLIER TERTIARIES. 

Adjoining the Carboniferous rocks to the northeast, and probably 
 overlying them is a comparatively small area of brown, yellow, some- 
 times purplish, limy and sandy shales, argillaceous fine sandstones, 
 and thin-bedded brown and yellow aphanitic limestones. This series 
 strikes N. 65° E., and dips 65° NW. It is probably identical with 
 the rocks of the Esmeralda formation a few miles to the south, In the 
 southern end of the Monte Cristo Mountains. At one place the 
 upturned edges of the stratified rocks are overlain by a thin sheet of 
 siliceous rock, so glassy that the microscope does not show its true 
 character, but it is probably rhyolite and susceptible of correlation 
 with the rhyolite overlying the sedimentary rocks in the Monte Cristo 
 Mountains. 

PLIOCENE BEDS. 

At the gap which separates the Pilot Mountains from the Cande- 
 laria Mountains, just north of Candelaria, occur certain horizontally 
 stratified clays and sands which have already been mentioned, in 
 describing the Pilot Mountains, as belonging to the group of Pliocene 
 sediments. 

IGNEOUS ROCKS. 

Overlying the Pliocene sediments not far north of Candelaria, thin 
 sheets of olivine-basalt were found (Pleistocene). South of liere, over- 
 lying the stratified beds of the Esmeralda formation, were found the 
 sheets of glassy rhyolite above mentioned. West of Columbus and 
 Candelaria, a large part of the range appears to be comj)osed of red 
 and gray lavas overlying and often concealing the sedimentary rocks. 
 As seen from Sodaville, the northern part of this mountain group is 
 also chiefly volcanic, the topography showing such smooth, mesa-like 
 forms, and so little erosion that the rocks were considered as probabl}^ 
 belonging to the Pleistocene lavas. A prominent peak in the central 
 portion of the Candelaria Mountains has the aspect of a little denuded 
 volcanic cone." 

a These observations have been confirmed by Messrs. Turner and Weeks, who visited the range 
 separately the same year as did the writer. Mr. Turner states that the bills north of Benton 
 are also all lavas.
