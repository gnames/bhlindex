SPURR.] RANGES OF WEST-CENTEAL NEVADA. 115 

WALKER RIVER RANGE. 

The Walker River, or Wassiiek, Range is a straight, bold ridge of 
 mountains, rising immediately from the west shore of Walker Lake. 
 It has a trend a little west of north and a length of about (50 miles. 
 It is separated on the north from the volcanic Desert Mountains by 
 the Walker River Valley, and on the south it passes into the irregular 
 Excelsior Mountains. Throughout most of its course the range is 
 characterized by the comj)aratively gentle slope of the west side and a 
 steep scarp on the east. 

IGNEOUS ROCKS. 

Almost all the rocks of the Walker River Range are igneous. Those 
 on the steep eastern face are generally granular, and those on the 
 west side typical volcanics. 

GRANULAR ROCKS. 

Just west of the Indian agency at the upper end of Walker Lake, 
 the rock of the mountains is chiefly a coarse-grained biotite-granite. 
 Farther north, near the point where the road crosses the range, 
 biotite-granite-aplite, of a distinctly more siliceous variety than the 
 first, occurs in conjunction with great masses of alaskite-aplifce. 

On the road which crosses the range, at a point southwest of Haw- 
 thorne, the summit and greater part of the mountain range appears 
 to be also of decomjiosed biotite-granite. Between these two locali- 
 ties the granite is i^robably nearly or quite continuous. 

Underlying the biotite-granite, at the point first described, is a dark 
 rock, specimens of which proved to be hornblende-quartz-syenite and 
 biotite-hornblende-quartz-monzonite. The granite is shown by its 
 branching dikes to be intrusive into the more basic rock. Both rocks 
 are cut by dikes of alaskite, which grows very siliceous and runs out 
 in places to nearly pure quartz. 

In the cream-colored mountain of granite and alaskite around 
 which the road turns in crossing the range, the alaskite is evidently 
 younger than the siliceous granite, into which, however, it x^asses by 
 transitional stages as regards its composition. The granite some- 
 times contains large feldspar phenocrysts, similar to those of the rock 
 near Belmont and near Ellsworth. 

At the pass southwest from Hawthorne, the biotite-granite which 
 occupies the summit of the mountains is succeeded farther east by 
 metamorphosed igneous rocks, probably altered by dynamic move- 
 ments. These rocks lie along the face of a bold, eastward-facing 
 scarp. As examined microscopically, they consist of aposyenite-por- 
 phyry, apogranite, and apoalaskite, with some biotite-rhyolite, which 
 may be later than the others. These metamorphosed igneous rocks 
 are confused with some highly altered limestones and quartzites.
