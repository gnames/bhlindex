116 GEOLOGY OF NEVADA SOUTH OF 40TH PAEALLEL. [bull.308. 

On the west side of the cream-colored mountain which lies north- 
 west of the north end of Walker Lake, on the road across the range, 
 the granular rocks, already described, pass under and into gray and 
 red volcanics, which dip 30° to 45° SW. away from the mountain. 
 About the point where the granular rock gives place to the evident 
 volcanics, specimens were collected, which proved to be alaskite- 
 IDorphjay and tordrillite, the latter with a finely cryptocrystalline 
 groundmass. Overlying these siliceous rocks was found augite-biotite- 
 aleutite. West of this point, near the summit of the range, the prev- 
 alent rock is biotite-andesite, containing many angular fragments of a 
 darker lava. The whole western side of the mountains is volcanic. 

IGNEOUS ROCKS SHOWING TRANSITIONS OF TEXTURE. 

In a small butte (Mason Butte) which emerges from the Pleisto- 
 cene valley deposits to the west of the northern part of the Walker 
 River Range, a few miles south of Wabuska, an intersecting series of 
 igneous rocks was studied. The butte presents the appearance of a 
 typical volcanic rock, being distinctl}^ and thinly bedded and of red 
 and gray colors. 

Upon examination the rocks are found to be in part granular and in 
 part fine grained and j)orphyritic, the different textures alternating 
 in conformable beds. Examined microscopicallj', the coarse-grained 
 rocks are hornblende-biotite-quartz-diorites, while the fine-grained 
 ones are hornblende-biotite-quartz-andesites. The chemical composi- 
 tion of the two rocks is also nearly the same. Sometimes the coarse- 
 grained and the fine-grained types api^ear in the same bed, one 
 apparently being formed at the same time as the other; generally, 
 however, the beds are separate. 

The hyj)othesis adopted by the writer is that these rocks are the 
 roots of old volcanic flows which have been exposed by the removal 
 of the overlying portions of the lava through the erosion of Walker 
 River, in whose valley the butte lies. The whole appears to have 
 been an igneous mass in process of slow flowage, some streaks of 
 which crystallized rapidly, with the texture of true lavas, while 
 between them portions of the same magma crystallized more slowly, 
 as granular rocks.'* 

Facts suggesting similar transitions of texture were noted within 
 the main Walker River Range, but are not described on account of 
 insufficient evidence. 

SEDIMENTARY ROCKS. 

PLEISTOCENE. 

Professor Russell lias described the history ^ and the sediments of 
 the Pleistocene Lake Lahontan, an arm of which occupied the valley
