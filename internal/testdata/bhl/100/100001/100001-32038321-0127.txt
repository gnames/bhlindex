SPURR] WALKER RIVER AND SMITH VALLEY RANGES. 117 

of the present Walker Lake. The writer also observed these sedi- 
 ments as well as older stratified deposits, which reach higher up 
 in the mountains. The line between the Pleistocene and the Tertiary 
 has not been closely di-awn in this region, and probablj^ a portion of 
 those dej)Osits older than the Lahontan sediments are still Pleisto- 
 cene, but at present the writer will include under that head only the 
 deposits of the lake described b}^ Russell. 

In the valley of Walker Lake the dej)tli of the Pleistocene Lake 
 Lahontan at its highest stage was 225 feet. At the upper end of the 
 present Walker Lake the elevation is 4,120 feet above sea level, which 
 would make the surface of Lake Lahontan at this iDoint 4,845 feet. 
 At about this altitude, as measured by the barometer, the writer 
 found a heavy terrace, and about 200 feet above this a still heavier 
 one, the top of the main terrace being about 4,600 feet high. These 
 terraces are constructional and show a rude horizontal stratification. 
 They are composed largely of gravels and huge bowlders from the 
 adjacent mountains. At another point, farther north, the altitude of 
 this same chief terrace was determined as 4,675 feet. On tlie opposite 
 side of the valley, on the slopes of the Painted Mesa (which forms 
 part of the Desert Mountains), corresponding dej)osits may also be 
 seen, taking the form of inclined slopes or ancient beaches rather 
 than of sharpl}^ cut terraces. 

PRE-LAHONTAN SEDIMENTS. 

About 100 feet above the heaviest terrace just mentioned is a 
 lesser constructional terrace, and about 400 feet higher there is on 
 the mountains a rock-cut bench which is probably also a water line. 
 This rock-cut bench is at an altitude of about 5,100 feet, or about 700 
 feet above the surface of the ancient Lake Lahontan, while the con- 
 structional terrace below it is about 300 feet above the old surface. 
 Crossing the southern end of the range, coarse, horizontally stratified 
 material, consisting of little assorted volcanic rock, is found to the 
 summit, where it forms hills 400 or 500 feet high, reaching up to an 
 altitude of about 5,730 feet, or 1,385 feet above the surface of Lake 
 Lahontan. 

On the western side of the range, at the point where the road crosses 
 due southwest from Hawthorne, stratified gravels are found u]3 to a 
 height of 7,100 feet. These deposits seem to be water-laid. They are 
 evidently pre-Lahontan, and if formed in a lake occupied a body of 
 Avater which was the ancestor of the Pleistocene lake, but of vastlj 
 greater dimensions and probabl}^ of longer life. 

From reasons entailed in the correlation of these gravels with others 
 throughout the region these deposits are provisionally classified as 
 Pliocene. 

SMITH VALLEY RANGE. 

The name Smith Valley Range may be applied to a low and narrow 
 moF ntain ridge, which on the north merges Avith the Pine Nut Range,
