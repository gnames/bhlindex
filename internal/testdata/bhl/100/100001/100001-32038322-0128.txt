and on the south spreads out broadly into a series of volcanic mesas, 
 which connect farther south with a spur of the Sierras north of Lake 
 Mono. The range as thus defined separates Mason Valley, on the east, 
 from Smith Valley, on the west. 

IGNEOUS ROCKS. 

Smith Valley Range is essentially volcanic. At the northern end, 
 where it merges into the Pine Nut Range, specimens of the lava, form- 
 ing comparatively^ well-dissected mountains, are found to consist of 
 hypersthene and biotite-andesite, with some biotite-dacite. South- 
 ward from here the range is evidently volcanic, but it was not examined 
 closely except in the region of Dalzell Canyon, which separates the 
 southern part of the range tro^n the Sweetwater Mountains, fai'ther 
 west. 

In Dalzell Canyon the oldest formation consists of granite and 
 rhyolite, and is altered and jointed. Overlying this is iJja^oxene- 
 hornblende-andesite, and still higher are comparatively slightly eroded 
 mesas of more siliceous andesitic rock, or hornblende-biotite-latite. 

On the road which cuts across the low southern end of the range 
 east of Sweetwater, following the upper part of the East Walker 
 'River Valley, the siliceous andesite and latite flows are succeeded on 
 the east by more basic thin-bedded andesitic or basaltic lava, largely 
 glassy. This overlies sands, clays, and conglomerates, which will 
 presently be described as probably Pliocene. It has flowed into and 
 dammed up the valley eroded in the earlier lavas. It is therefore the 
 latest of all and is i^robably Pleistocene. Farther east this same 
 glassy lava occupies a considerable area in the bottom of the broad 
 Walker River Valley, and forms broad mesas on the flanks of the 
 Smith Valley Range on f he west and the Walker River Range on the 
 east, and, reaching around to the south, forms a large part of the hills 
 between the Walker River Vallej^ and Mono Valley. At the southern 
 end of Walker River Valley, a few miles north of Auroi-a, is a little- 
 defaced volcanic cone of red lava, which probajbly belongs to the same 
 epoch. This has been called the Aurora Crater on the topographic 
 map accompanying Professor Russell's paper on Lake Mono.^' These 
 lavas everywhere overlie the stratified gravels which occur in the 
 southern part of the Walker Lake Valley, in the same manner as 
 already mentioned. 

South of here, in the basin of Lake Mono, Professor Russell* has 
 described various lavas, including hypersthene- andesite verging upon 
 basalt, and rhy9lite, which are evidently Pleistocene. These lavas 
 belong to the same class as those just described, and seem to corre- 
 spond with the thin flows capping the Pliocene gravels near Welling- 
 ton on the Sweetwater Range, and also to the thin flow of basalt which
