SEDIMENTARY ROCKS. 

Just south of Dalzell Canyon were found well-stratified arkoses 
 and little- worn conglomerates, containing chiefly angulai- fragments. 
 These seem to cover the whole of a broad upland valley, to its abrupt 
 end at the base of the Sweetwater Mountains, at an elevation of some- 
 thing over 7,000 feet. As one goes southeastward from here, i^assing 
 Sweetwater post- office and proceeding down the valley of Walker River 
 where this cuts across the range, one finds, at an elevation of 6,500 
 feet at least, and below, well-stratified, washed, and assorted, hori- 
 zontally or slightly cross-bedded sandstones, arkoses, and gravels. 
 These rocks are often firmly consolidated, though friable, and resem- 
 ble the sandstones near Carson, as exposed at the State prison.* The 
 pebbles in the gravels are evidently derived from tlie andesite which 
 is the main rock of the Smith Vallej^^ Range. Farther west, on the 
 slopes of the hills facing the main Walker River Vallej*, a section of 
 these deposits 100 feet thick was examined. Near the bottom were 
 found sandy clays, which may be in part water-laid volcanic ash. 
 Farther up come hard gravels, the well-rolled pebbles comi)rising 
 various varieties of hornblende- and mica-andesite. Above this comes 
 a compact gray sandstone, also made ux3 of volcanic debris and contain- 
 ing fragments of white decomposed pumice. Capping the sedimen- 
 tary rocks and overlying them, with a considerable angle of divergence, 
 comes a thin sheet of andesitic or basaltic lava with glassy base. The 
 top of this section has an altitude of about 0,150 feet. A short dis- 
 tance away from this section the highest sandstone reaches an altitude 
 of about 6,350 feet and is exposed as a simple bench in the mountains, 
 the overlying lava having been eroded back from it. Along the north- 
 ern slopes of the mountains which form the southern end of the Walker 
 River Valley, northwest from Aurora, are continuous benches, the 
 best marked of which can be little less than 7,000 feet in height. 
 Below this are other sharp smooth benches of horizontal sandstone. 
 The comparatively recent volcanic cone above referred to, lying north- 
 east from Aurora, is benched up to 6,700 or 6,800 feet, but not higher. 
 These terraces appear to grow somewhat higher to the south. The 
 whole valley here is covered with the sandstones above described, 
 which have been considerably eroded. At least 700 or 800 feet of this 
 sedimentarj^ series is exposed.
