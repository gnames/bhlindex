horizontally stratified gravels, apparently belonging to the same series 
 as the sandstones above mentioned, occnr, frequently overlain b}'' 
 glassy and slaggy andesitie or basaltic lavas, up to a height of 7,100 
 feet, where they give way to a fresh lava, above which all is decom- 
 posed granite. 

All these comparatively recent horizontal sediments are provision- 
 ally^ classed as Pliocene. 

PINE NUT RANGE. 
 TOPOGRAPHY. 

The Pine Nut Range lies immediately east of the Sierra Nevada, 
 and has much of the bold irregular topograph}^ of that range. As 
 contrasted with the mountains of the more arid regions farther east, 
 it* is distinguished by deeper dissection, affording more profound 
 canyons and more abrupt cliffs. The eastern face of the range is 
 steep, the western side in general less abrupt. 

Wherever this range was visited, numerous springs were observed, 
 and the dissection seemed to be largely the result of water derived 
 from these sources. The springs seem to be arranged, in part at 
 least, along north-south lines, which are probably lines of fracture. 
 These lines are deeper than the regions between, Avhich stand up as 
 ridges; but whether these ridges are directly due to displacement, or 
 have been left as such by the erosion of depressions along the lines of 
 spring water, is uncertain. 

On the western side, between Daj^ton and Carson, the peculiarlj' 
 wild and rugged topograi:)hy is caused bj^ the Carson River and its 
 mountain tributaries which, in late Tertiarj^ or Pleistocene time, have 
 dissected the mountain and the adjacent plateau-valle3^ 

IGNEOUS ROCKS. 

Nearly the whole mass of the range is igneous. The rocks Avere 
 studied principally along two sections, one across the range southeast 
 from Dayton and the other on the road between Wellington and 
 Genoa. 

In the eastern part of the first-mentioned section, in the loAver 
 mountains which here lie to the east of the main range and are con- 
 nected with the northern end of the Smith Vallej^ Range, chiefly 
 andesitie rocks were found. The andesite contains different ferro- 
 magnesian minerals, including hornblende, augite, hypersthene, 
 bronzite, and biotite. Occasionally biotite-dacite or quartz-andesite 
 is found. Where erosion has cut deeply into the lava, coarser, denser, 
 more massive, and more porjjhyritic forms are exposed. At the bot- 
 tom of one of these canyons the lava is a fine-grained diorite-porphyry, 
 while farther up it is hypersthene-bronzite-andesite with some dacite. 

Farther west, on the eastern scarp of the main range, occur gran-
