iilar I'ocks. These, when examined microscopically, tnrned ont. to be 
 hornblende-biotite-granite, sometimes porphyritic, and alaskite. The 
 same granular siliceous rocks are exposed nearly to the summit, and 
 they occur also on the western side of the divide. Here they are 
 overlain by hornblende-, augite-, and hypersthene-andesites. 

About halfway down the mountains, in Eldorado Canyon, where 
 the road leading to Dayton runs, there are hills of gently folded grav- 
 els and coarse clays, the gravels being derived almost entirely from 
 the andesites. They are exposed best in the arroyos, where they are 
 overlain unconformablj^ hy 8 or 10 feet" of stratified bowlders and soil, 
 which represent the recent stream accumulations. Farther doAvn the 
 canyon is a volcanic breccia with rounded andesite bowlders, prob- 
 ablj^ water-laid. This breccia is followed by thin flows of slaggy white 
 lava, which contains numerous included angular fragments of andes- 
 ite; these flows are interbedded with ash. The present canyon has 
 been worn down through this breccia, ash, and porous white lava 
 deposit. In several places a thin sheet of basalt has been poured ont 
 after the development of the present topography (fig. 8). This sheet

also occupies the tops of some of the neighboring hillocks, which have 
 been separated from one another by erosion subsequent to the last 
 volcanic outbursts. 

In the canyon of the Carson River, a few miles southwest of Dayton, 
 the stream has cut down 400 to 800 feet, exposing lavas like those in 
 Eldorado Canj^on. The uppermost of these flows is a Avliite, little- 
 compacted rhj^olite, while beneath it are large masses of a rock recog- 
 nized in the field as lava, which on microscopic examination appears 
 to be monzonite-porphjay. This is perhaps a coarser variation of 
 andesite. 

Between Dayton and Wellington the Pine Nut Range is mainly 
 igneous. The central ridge has a massive aspect in general, and is 
 probably made up of the granitic rocks. 

Where the road between Genoa and Wellington crosses the range, 
 hornblende-biotite-andesites occur on the western slopes. As in 
 Eldorado Canyon, the whole system of gulches has been cut in this 
 lava.
