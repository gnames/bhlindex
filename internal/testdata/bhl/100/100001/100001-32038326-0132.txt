122 GEOLOGY OF NEVADA SOUTH OP 40TH PAEALLEL. [bull.208. 

Near the summit of the low pass on this road were found cliffs of 
 a dense, massive, volcanic breccia with horizontal bedding and con- 
 taining pebbles of rhyolite only. Some distance farther up, appar- 
 ently belonging to the same series as the breccia, was found an ancient, 
 apparently water-laid tuff, which microscopic examination shows to 
 be rhyolitic, with above it a bed of coarse volcanic grit, and still 
 higher a bed of volcanic conglomerate with large well-rounded pebbles 
 of biotite-rhyolite and a matrix derived from the same rock. A short 
 distance farther the rocks from which these detritals are derived were 
 found in place in a hill to the north of the valley and to the east of 
 the pass. This rock shows many and great variations, passing from 
 a fine-grained aphanitic rhyolite to coarse granite and alaskite, and 
 these variations are .arranged in thin bands. 

These are essentially quartz-feldspar rocks, generall}" containing 
 biotite. They comprise biotite-rhyolite, fine-grained granite-porphyry, 
 medium-grained biotite-granite, coarse-grained alaskite and granite- 
 aplite, and one sjpecimen was a fine-grained quartz-monzonite-porphyry. 
 These different varieties present, textn rally and structurally, almost 
 perfect transitions from one to another, ranging from coarse granites 
 through the granite-aplites and porphyries to the rhyolite, and the 
 development of the different structures from the fine-grained rhj^olite 
 is very clear and instructive. Only one band was found which did 
 not belong to the general granitic series. This was a band of dark- 
 green slaty rock, which, when examined, proved to be probably horn- 
 blende-andesite; j^et this rock does not appear to be intrusive, but 
 to form a band or streak probably contemporaneous with the more 
 siliceous rocks. 

West of this old granite-rhyoiite area, andesite comes in above it 
 again, of the same kind as before. Where it has been deeplj^ eroded 
 a coarser- textural type is exposed; for example, the hornblende- 
 andesite with cryptocrystalline groundmass, which represents the 
 rocks near the surface, gives way in some deeper cuts to hornblende- 
 andesite with granular groundmass, which is transitional to horn- 
 blende-diorite-porphyry,

TRIASSIC LIMESTONE. 

Southeast of Dayton, limestone, in extremely scanty outcrops, just 
 visible beneath the overlying volcanics, was found on both sides of 
 the range. On the eastern side the limestone is massive, dark-blue 
 and sometimes siliceous. Its laminae are vertical, although they may 
 result more from shearing than from stratification. It is cut by 
 andesite dikes. On the western side of the mountain, in Eldorado 
 Canyon, the limestone is also blue and siliceous, changing to shaly 
 and carbonaceous. It is crushed and seamed, but ajDpears nearly
