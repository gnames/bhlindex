horizontal. The shal}^ limestone contains nearly obliterated fossils, 
 npon which Mr. T. W. Stanton comments as follows: 

The collection * * * yielded only fragments and impressions of a Pecten 
 and a specimen that appears to be part of an Ammonite. These are Mesozoic and 
 probably Triassic. 

This locality is probably the same as that mentioned by Whitney'* 
 as having- yielded the Triassic fossil Goniatites Icevidorsatus Ilauer. 

This Triassic limestone is probablj^ to be correlated with King's 
 Triassic Star Peak limestone.* 

In the Pine Nut Range the limestone is probably older than the 
 granitic rock which forms the main range, between its two outcrops.

PLIOCENE DEPOSITS. 

On the west flanks of the mountains above Dayton, as already 
 described, there are found some hardened, well-stratified gravels 
 and clays, derived from the andesites, and overlain, often unconform- 
 ably, by stream gravels (fig. 9). They have the appearance of having 
 been deposited in moving water, but this aspect may well have resulted 
 from current action in a stable water-bod5^ On the face of the range 
 just east of Daj- ton there is a rough inclined plane running uj^ to a 
 height of 6,000 feet and terminating in obscure benches. Above this 
 termination the mountain rises sharply and steeply, as vnsij be seen
