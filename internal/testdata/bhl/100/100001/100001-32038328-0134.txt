Survey. The approximately horizontal upper limit of the plane sug- 
 gests lake action, and the older gravels and clays in Eldorado Canyon 
 strengthen the idea. At Dayton Professor Russell'' has placed the 
 limit of one of the bays of Lake Lahontan at an elevation of 4,375 
 feet. The above-mentioned bench is, therefore, 1,625 feet above the 
 uppermost limit of the Pleistocene lake. Southward from Dayton 
 the leveled plane was not observed, and it is probable that some of 
 the lavas which here form the mountain flanks were laid down in the 
 lake period and so covered the ]3lane or prevented its erosion. 

In the plateau valley between Dayton and Carson there occur 
 stratified clays and coarse gravels, at heights of several hundred feet 
 above the Pleistocene Lake Lahontan. Near Carson there occurs a 
 hardened sandstone or granitic arkose, which is well exposed at the 
 State prison. The rock here contains plant remains and occasional 
 fresh-water shells. One of these shells submitted to Dr. W. H. Dall 
 was determined as Anodonfa, belonging to a recent species found 
 living in California. Dr. Dall adds that the species may be older 
 than the Pleistocene, since the genus goes back as far as the Eocene; 
 but that since the genus is so easily affected by environment, the same 
 species is rarely found in more than two horizons. Excavations in 
 this rock at the State prison have brought to light layers covered with 
 footprints of the extinct elephant and other mammals and birds. On 
 the hill south from the prison there is benching up to a height of 4,850 
 feet. The same sandstone as shown at the State j)rison, but some- 
 what looser and more friable, occurs west of Carson at the foot of the 
 Sierras.^ 

South of this point, along the face of the range, there is a belt of 
 low hills often covered \\\) bj^ the Pleistocene detritus, but consisting, 
 when exposed, of stratified sands and gravels. On the western face 
 of the Pine Nut Range, southward from Carson, there is generallj'^ 
 visible a distinct line in the topograi)hy at about 6,000 feet, below 
 which the slopes are gentler and above which the mountains are 
 steeper and more rugged. Along the road which crosses the range 
 from Genoa to Wellington stratified sands and gravels, carrying well- 
 rounded pebbles, occur in hills covering the gentlj^ inclined plain at

ft After writing the above description the writer found that the locality had been already 
 better described by Professor Le Conte and others. He lets his own description stand only to 
 show how independent observations have led to similar conclusions. 

Professor Le Conte (On certain remarkable tracks, found in therocksof Carson quarry: Proc. 
 Cal. Acad. Sci., Aug. 27, 1882) describes a few fresh- water fossil shells of species still living in the 
 vicinity. Among the vertebrate remains are fragments of tusks and molars of an elephant, and 
 molars and fragments of jaws containing molars of two species of horse. 

Concerning the age of the beds he conclvides that if not Quaternary, they can not be earlier 
 than Upper Pliocene passing into Quaternary. He also suggests that they are possibly deposits 
 of King's Lake Shoshone, and not Lake Lahontan. 

Professor Le Conte observed that the level at this locality is 240 feet higher than the upper- 
 most shore line of the Pleistocene Lake Lahontan, which, moreover, did not extend so far west 
 as Carson.
