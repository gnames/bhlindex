the base of the steeper mountains. These hills are considerably 
 eroded. Near the mountains the jjebbles are larger, and in crossing 
 the range the stratified deposit stops at 6,000 feet precisely, above 
 which the rocks are bare. Below the uj)permost gravels are benches 
 in the detritus and in the lava on which the detritus lies. These 
 benches, as well as the canyon of the Carson River at this point, seem 
 to have been cut during the recession of the lake to which the gravels 
 owe their origin, and whose uppermost shore line was at the G, 000-foot 
 cut. On the western side of the range there is also a pronounced 
 scarp above the 6,000-foot contour, and beneath this stratified gravels 
 constitute the foundation of the valley between the Pine Nut Range 
 and the northern end of the Sweetwater Range. 

The uniform and general distribution of these water-deposited 
 gravels and sands, up to about 6,000 feet, and the horizontal groin which 
 occurs on the mountains about the same height, suggest that the 
 deposits were laid down in a lake, which had its surface at its time of 
 maximum extension at the altitude above mentioned. That the lake 
 was older than the Pleistocene is shown b}^ the fact that the Pleisto- 
 cene Lake Lahontan reached an altitude of only 4,375 feet. The indu- 
 ration of the sediments of this higher lake, as seen in the sandstone 
 of Carson, also i)oints to a greater age; and the great amount of sub- 
 sequent erosion, illustrated in the carving of the canyon of Carson 
 River, indicates that the maximum extent of the lake was at a period 
 which was removed from the period of maximum extension of Lake 
 Lahontan by a time interval much longer than from the latter x^eriod 
 to the present day. On the whole the deposits of this older lake will 
 be considered late Pliocene. 

SWEET\A^ATER RANGE. 

The Sweetwater Range may be considered as the southern prolonga- 
 tion of the Pine Nut Range, from Avhich it is separated by the valley 
 of the West Walker River, at Wellington. It is also a spur of the 
 Sierras, into which it passes at its southern end, 

TOPOGRAPHY. 

The Sweetwater Mountains are high and rugged for the most part, 
 with bold peaks and cliffs. The eastern face of the northern part of 
 the range, from Wellington southward to Desert Creek, is steep and 
 straight. Southwest of Wellington the West Walker River has cut a 
 deep canyon along the face of the range, below the level of the broad 
 desert valley separating it from the Pine Nut Range. On the road 
 from Wellington to Sweetwater, the Sweetwater Range is separated 
 from the Smith Valley Range on the east by the deeply cut Dalzell 
 Canyon.
