IGNEOUS ROCKS. 
 POST-PLIOCENE BASALTIC LAVA. 

The gravels and sands which occur in the valley separating the 
 northern end of the Sweetwater Range from the Pine Nut Range 
 belong to the ancient sediments which have already been provisionally 
 classified as Pliocene. Along the canyon of the West Walker River, 
 a short distance southwest of Wellington, there occur in places sheets 
 of columnar basaltic lava, overlying the gravels. This is probably 
 nearl}^ contemporaneous with the basalt in Eldorado Canyon, of the 
 Pine Nut Range. 

LATE RHYOLITIC LAVA. 

The highest i)ortion of the Sweetwater Range, just west of the post- 
 office at SweetAvater, is distinguished by the brilliant light-gray, yellow, 
 and red which its rocks assume on Aveathering. These rocks all seem 
 to be gray, essentially fine-grained, thin-bedded surface volcanics. 
 They Avere not examined in place, but a typical specimen selected from 
 the blocks derived from this mountain proves on chemical analysis to 
 be A^ery siliceous rhyolite'^' or tordrillite.* 

LATE ANDESITE AND LATITE. 

In the same canyon as above mentioned (near Wellington), there 
 occurs, beneath the rolled gravels, stratified ash, dipping nortliAA^est 
 aAvay from the mountains. Below this ash occurs lava, through which 
 also the river has cut. There are two distinct flows, the lower of 
 Avhich has a perfect columnar jointing, Avhile the upper one is often 
 brecciated and rests uj)on the apparently eroded surface of the lower. 
 The rock of the loAA^er flow, microscopically examined, proves to be 
 bronzite-andesite, that of the upper one hornblende-biotite-latite. 
 The uppermost of these floAvs has been deepl}^ weathered, and has 
 been displaced by a fault, which is subsequent to the weathering. 

The andesite is of the same composition as the ancient andesite 
 AA'hich forms the greater part of the range, but its association Avith 
 breccias and graA^els stamp it as being younger than the main mass 
 and intermediate belAveen it and the latite. 

In Dalzell Canyon are coarse volcanic breccias, Avith thin inter- 
 banded flows, all dipping at moderate angles irregularl3^ A specimen 
 from a hard bowlder in the breccia is hornblende-bronzite-andesite. 
 These breccias and thin flows are probably younger than the massive 
 andesite of the main range. They are very likely of about the same 

a Dr. H. W. Fairbanks (Am. Geol., Vol. XVII, p. 152) mentions a rock in Ferris Canyon, in the 
 Sweetwater Range, which is probably the same as that above described. 

f> TordriUite is proposed as the flne-grained equivalent of alaskite, and differs from rhyolite in 
 being in general more siliceous and containing no essential feiTomagnesian minerals. See J. E. 
 Spurr, Classification of igneous rocks according to composition: Am. Geol., Vol. XXV, 1900, p. 210.
