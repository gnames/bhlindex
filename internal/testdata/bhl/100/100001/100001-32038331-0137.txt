age as the breccias in Eldorado Canyon, in the Pine Nut Range, 
 which they resemble exactly. 

Jnst south of the post-office at Sweetwater similar hornblende- 
 bronzite-audesite comes in, overlying the ancient rhyolite series. This 
 is of the same general age as the breccias in Dalzell Canyon. 

EARLIER ANDESITES. 

Most of the Sweetwater Range to the north of the high gray.rhyo- 
 litic peaks above described is of red, deejjly eroded lava. Near Well- 
 ington, and at the northern end of Desert Creek, specimens of this 
 lava proved on examination to be hornblende-bronzite-andesite. 

The main mass of hornblende-pja'oxene-andesite forming the bulk 
 of the Sweetwater Range is older than the thin flows and breccias 
 previously described. The later andesites are closely associated with 
 gravels which were chiefly derived from the erosion of the earlier 
 andesite. 

EARLIER RHYOLITE. 

Just below Sweetwater there outcrops a gray lava which has some- 
 what the aspect of a pj^roclastic breccia. A specimen proves to be 
 rhyolite, with a microcrystalline granular groundmass, and contain- 
 ing small fragments of a gray basic lava free from quartz. This rock 
 is of exactly the same type as one examined from the banded granite- 
 rhyolite series in the Pine Nut Range, on the road between Genoa 
 and Wellington. At Sweetwater, also, this lava has an ancient 
 appearance. It has a pronounced jointing, or sheeting, in two direc- 
 tions, at right angles to one another, one striking N. 70° E. and dip- 
 ping 70° SE., and the other dipping 70° NE. This rhyolite is over- 
 lain by hornblende-bronzite-andesite. 

GRANITIC ROCKS. 

Along the eastern side of the northern portion af the Sweetwater 
 Range, south of Wellington, there is, back of the main scarp, a second 
 scarp composed of gray and massive rocks. In the bottom of the 
 vallej' east of here are rolled pebbles and bowlders of granular and 
 porphyritic granitic rocks. As one goes southward from here he may 
 trace the scarp of gray rocks into Desert Creek Canyon, which seems 
 to be cut in similar rocks, and the uppermost portion of Desert Creek 
 Peak is seen to be of the same material. Just east of Desert Creek 
 Peak, at Wileys, granite actually outcrops, beneath hornblende- 
 bronzite-andesite. The granite is in part coarse and porphyritic, 
 containing large feldspars, which have inclusions of dark minerals, 
 and is of the same variety as noted at Belmont, Ellsworth, and on 
 the eastern face of the Pine Nut Range, southeast from Dayton. 
 There is also some nonporphyritic granite, and some containing few 
 dark minerals, and so verging oh alaskite.
