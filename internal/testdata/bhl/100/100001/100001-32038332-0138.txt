128 GEOLOGY OF NEVADA SOUTH OF 40TH PARALLEL, [bull.208. 

The granitic rocks have been decomposed to a depth of many feet, 
 so that no specimens could be collected. This decomposition occurred 
 before the eruption of the andesite, for this lava is fresh where it 
 overlies the rotten granite. The period sufficient for this decomposi- 
 tion is considerable, and it must have been preceded by a long period 
 of erosion, which exposed the granite. 

In the valley drift above noted there was found, besides granite, 
 specimens of porphyritic siliceous rock, transitional between granite 
 and rhyolite. It is possible that the granite and the rhyolite at 
 Sweetwater may be of nearly the same age and may be correlated with 
 the ancient granite-rhyolite series of the Pine Nut Range. 

SEDIMENTARY ROCKS. 
 PLIOCENE DEPOSITS. 

The valley which separates the northern end of the Sweetwater 
 Range from the adjacent Pine Nut Range is covered with bedded 
 gravels, through which West Walker River has cut a Pleistocene 
 canyon. Besides the rolled gravels, which are largely derived from 
 the andesite of the mountains, there are some beds of stratified ash. 
 Across the range from here, the foot of the main scarp north of Desert 
 Creek ends in a sloping lAahi at an elevation of 6,000 feet; and in the 
 valley below this the deposits consist of rolled gravels similar to 
 those exposed in Walker River Canyon. 

South of Dalzell Canyon and east of the highest peaks of the Sweet- 
 water Range is a broad, gently sloping valley, several miles across, . 
 reaching back to the Sweetwater Mountains, which rise sharply from i 
 it at an altitude of about 7,000 feet. The surface of this valley is; 
 smooth, and slight cuts in it show a stratified deposit of arkose and I 
 angiilar fragments of lava.*^^ 

All these deposits are provisionally referred to the Pliocene. 

RESUME. 

Probably the oldest rocks of the range are a series of granites andi 
 ancient rhyolites, which were perhaps contemporaneous. They have 
 been jointed by dynamic action, and are deeply decomposed. 

The succeeding geologic formation was a hornblende-pyroxene- 
 andesite, which was poured out in great masses over the underlying 
 siliceous mountain core. Subsequent to this, the andesite was deeply 
 eroded, and probably a lake was formed. The material-derived from 
 the erosion of the andesite and of the underlying siliceous rock was 
 spread out in the valleys as gravels. 

During this erosion period thin sheets of andesite similar to the 
 main mass were poured out.
