SPURR.] SWEKTWATEK AND VIRGINIA RANGES. 129 

Later than this, but also i^robably while the lak'^ still existed, a 
 more siliceous lava, which has been classified as hornblende-latite, 
 was poured out in comparatively thin sheets. The rhyolites or tor- 
 drillites of the highest portion of the range were probably j)Oured out 
 at approximately the same period, so far as we can judge from the 
 amount of erosion. 

The shrinking of the lake exposed to erosion those lavas which had 
 been poured out in it, and the present stream canyons were cut in the 
 lake sediments and the lavas. At the same time thin sheets of 
 basaltic lava were locally erupted. 

At the southern end of the Sweetwater Range there appears to have 
 occurred, subsequent to the retreat of the lake, a local ui3lift, which 
 has elevated the lake sediments and shore lines 1,000 feet above the 
 same sediments in the regions north of here. 

VIRGINIA RANGE. 

The Virginia Range lies next east of the Sierras and north of Car- 
 son. It is ceparated on the south from the Pine Nut Range by a narrow 
 plateau valle}', in which Carson River has cut a Pleistocene canyon. 
 The range rises abruptly from the plains at its base, and is high and 
 rugged. The northern portion was examined by the geologists of the 
 Fortieth Parallel Survey, and the geology of this part is represented 
 on map 5 of the atlas accompanying that rei3ort. In the southern 
 part of the range is the famous Comstock lode, and in this vicinity 
 the geology has been studied in detail by King, Becker, and others. 

IGNEOUS ROCKS. 

With one or two nn important exceptions, the Virginia Range is 
 made up entirely of igneous rocks. These were thoroughly studied 
 by Dr. Becker," and later were made the subjectiof a critical study 
 by Messrs. Hague and Iddings.^ 

The igneous rocks consist partly of rocks with porphyritic structure 
 and fine-grained or glassy groundmass, partlj^ of those porphj^-itic 
 rocks whose groundmass is comparativel}^ coarse, and x)artly of typical 
 granular rocks. At first these rocks of different structures but simi- 
 lar composition were described as distinct from one another and of 
 different ages, but Hague and Iddings considered that the structures 
 above enumerated occur in the same eruptive bodies, the finer-grained 
 structures having occurred at or near the surface, while the coarsely 
 granular ones are typical of the core of the mountain, now made 
 accessible by the deep uiine workings. These conclusions Avere after- 
 wards contested by Dr. Becker.
