130 GEOLOGY OF NEVADA rfOUTH OF 40TH PARALLEL, [bull. 208. 

According to Dr. Becker, the succession of igneous rocks in this 
 district is, beginning with the oldest: 

Granite, metamoi^phics, granular diorites, porphyritic diorites, 
 quartz-porphyry, porphyritic diabase, later diabase (black dike), 
 earlier hornblende-andesite, augite-andesite, later hornblende-ande- 
 site, basalt. 

The succession, according to Hague and Iddings, is as follows: 

1. Pyroxene-hornblende-andesite (in its coarser inner portions becoming 

pyroxene-hornblende-diorite-porphyry and pyroxene-hornblende-dio- 
 rite). 
 Period of volcanic rest and denudation. 

2. Hornblende-mica-andesite. 

3. Dacite. 

4. Rhyolite. 

5. Pyroxene-andesite. 

6. Basalt. 

All these igneous rocks are considered by Hague and Iddings as 
 Tertiarj^, but they have been divided into Tertiary and pre-Tertiary 
 by Becker and others. 

SEDIMENTARY ROCKS. 
 ANCIENT LIMESTONES. 

Mr. Becker Â« described near Virginia a small area of distinctl}^ 
 stratified rocks, consisting of limestones and greatly metamorphosed 
 micaceous schists. No fossils Avere found. They are perhaps similar 
 to the Triassic limestones found a few miles south of here, in the 
 Pine Nut Range near Daj^oii. (See p. 207.)
