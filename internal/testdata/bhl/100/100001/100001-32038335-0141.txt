 RANGES OF S0UTHER:N^ NEVABA. 

VIRGIN RANGE. 

The Virgin Range is just ^vithiu the eastern limit of the folded 
 strata of the Basin ranges and west of the nearlj^ horizontal rocks of 
 the Colorado Plateau.** According to Button,* the exact boundary 
 between these two provinces is the Grand Wash, the vallej^ which 
 lies immediately east of the Virgin Range. In this valley is a heavy 
 fault with downthrow to the west. Dutton sa^^s : 

This fault is the boiindary of the G-rand Canyon district and of the Plateau 
 country itself. The region beyond is a Sierra coimtry, with the same character- 
 Lstics as the Great Basin of Nevada and western Utah. 

SEDIMENTARY ROCKS. 

PRE-TERTIARY. 

According to Marvine ^ the rocks exposed in the main body of the 
 Virgin Range present the same general sequence as is shown in that 
 portion of the range cut by the Colorado River. The fundamental 
 rocks are Archean gneisses, schists, granites, etc., overlain by Cam- 
 brian rocks, which in turn are capped by a great thickness of Carbon- 

ferous rocks of the Red Wall and Aubrey groups. At the extreme 
 northern end of the range, east of Beaver Dam Wash, an area of red 

andstones, supposed to be Triassic, although no fossils were found, 
 tias been maj)ped bj^ the geologists of the Wheeler Survey,^ but is not 
 included in the map accompanying the present reiDort. 

PLIOCENE. 

Besides the Archean and Paleozoic rocks, Marvine * describes in the 
 Jrand Wash, which lies just east of the Virgin Range, a series of 
 ompact conglomerates, which constitute a very large amount of the 
 t^alley filling and which have often been eroded into a rolling or hilly 
 lUrface with deep valleys. This conglomerate contains some beds of 
 ava, is horizontally bedded, and abuts unconformably against the 
 'olded Carboniferous rocks of the mountains. Southward from the
