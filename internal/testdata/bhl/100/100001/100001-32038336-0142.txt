Colorado, in another valley, the same gravels or conglomerates are met 
 with, overlain by calcareous tufas several hundred feet in thickness. 

On traveling along the west side of the Mormon Range toward the 
 pass between it and the Muddy Range, the writer noted that the 
 greater portion of the valley of the Virgin River lying east of 
 the Virgin Range was covered with slightly eroded Tertiary strata, 
 probably identical with the horizontal red, gray, and brown sand- 
 stones and conglomerates observed in the lower portion of the Meadow 
 Valley Wash/' The conglomerates in the Grand Wash, on the other 
 side of the Virgin Range, described by Marvine, probably belong to 
 the same series. As observed by the writer in the Meadow Valley 
 Wash, they have the appearance of having been deposited in a lake, 
 although it is possible that they represent the valley accumulation of 
 the Colorado River, at a period when the streams of this system occu- 
 pied wide valleys, in which they worked laterall}^ and deposited the 
 material which they derived from the erosion of the mountains, the 
 carrying power of the streams at that time not being equal to 
 the amount of load received. These sediments occupy the older val- 
 leys which were eroded in the Paleozoic limestones and in the earlier 
 Tertiary sediments and lavas, but they were laid down before the 
 down cutting of the latest sharp gorges, for they stand as the walls 
 of these. They lie against the Carboniferous limestones, and, as 
 described by Marvine, against the Archean granites along the Grand 
 Wash. 

According to Dutton ^ the greater part of the general denudation of 
 the Colorado drainage region was probably accomplished in Miocene 
 time, whereas the cutting of the Grand Canyon probably began in the 
 early part of the Pliocene. The conglomerates and sandstones under 
 consideration were evidently deposited just before the period of rapid 
 canyon cutting, and this, in conjunction with the evidence afforded 
 by the underlying unconformable Tertiary rocks in Meadow Valley 
 Canyon, may be sufficient grounds for specifying their age provision- 
 ally as Pliocene. 

IGNEOUS ROCKS. 

Marvine^ describes large masses of black basaltic lavas resting 
 upon the eastern base of the Virgin Range. Where the Colorado 
 River cuts the range, at Virgin Canyon, Mr. Gilbert '^ describes lavas 
 overlying the gneissic Archean rocks. 

STRUCTURE. 

As seen from the west, the limestones of the central portion of the 
 Virgin Range present dips of 15° to 30°, and strikes indicating some-
