what irregular folding. Marvine " records that the main fold of the 
 range is anticlinal and that a fault exists along the east face. This 
 is j)robably the fanlt mentioned by Dntton,* which has a downthrow 
 to the west of between 6,000 and 7,000 feet. 

Toward the south the folding appears to die ont so as to be nearly 
 horizontal in the Colorado Canyon. 

COLORADO CANYON. 

That part of the canyon of the Colorado which is represented in the 
 sontheastern corner of the map accompanying this report lies near 
 the boundary between the Colorado Plateau on the east and the 
 region of the Desert or Basin ranges on the west. The Colorado 
 Plateau is characterized by nearly horizontal rocks forming mesas or 
 benched platforms, while the region to the west has many different 
 ranges of higii rugged mountains composed of folded strata. 

The rocks exposed in this portion of the canyon are Carboniferous 
 and lower. At the mouth of the Grand Canyon Mr. Gilbert made a 
 section showing^ over 5,600 feet of rocks, being all horizontal strata 
 except the extreme base, where the granites and gneisses of the 
 Archean appear. Above the Archean rocks are 755 feet of shales, 
 sandstones, and some limestone belonging to the Upper Cambrian of 
 the Tonto group. Above the Cambrian comes in, in aptparent con- 
 formitj^, heavy limestones with some sandstones, having a thickness 
 of 2,675 feet. This is the Red Wall limestone of the Carboniferous. 
 Above the Red Wall comes in the Aubrey group of the Upper Car- 
 boniferous, consisting of 1,300 feet of shales, sandstones, and cherty 
 limestones. 

Later, Mr. Walcotf^^ found in the Grand Canyon a slight thick- 
 ness of Devonian, rarely over 100 feet, between the Red Wall lime- 
 stone and the Tonto rocks. Often the Devonian in this region is 
 entirely absent, either through erosion or nondeposition. The rocks 
 of this period are thin, purplish, fine-grained sandstones, becom- 
 ing calcareous and containing unmistakable fossils. Mr. Walcott 
 observed an erosion break at the top of the Tonto strata, and another 
 between the Carboniferous and the Devonian. No Silurian rocks are 
 present. 

At the base of the Tonto there is a great unconformity, beneath 
 which occur sandstones, shales, limestones, and ancient lavas of the 
 Chuar and Unkar divisions of the Grand Canyon group resting upon 
 thin-bedded quartzites, which stand vertical and are broken through 
 bj^ intrusive masses of granite. Mr. Walcott considers that the strata
