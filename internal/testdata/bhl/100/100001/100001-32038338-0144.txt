between the Tonto and the thin -bedded qnartzites belong to the Algon- 
 kian. The qnartzites are Algonkian or Archean." 

As one proceeds down the Colorado River from the Grand Canyon, 
 he finds the upper strata successively disappearing, until, in Boulder 
 Canyon and below, the Archean granites, gneisses, and schists come 
 to the top of the canyon, except where covered up by Tertiary lavas. 

MORMON RANGE. 

The Mormon Range lies immediately east of Meadow YalleJ^ It 
 has an extent of about 40 miles, and a north-northeast trend. At its 
 south end it is divided from the Muddy Range by the valley of Muddy 
 Creek, while at its northern end it merges into irregular volcanic 
 mountains which cover a large area southeast of Pioche. 

In topography the Mormon Range is not extraordinarj^, its peaks 
 being fairly rugged and of moderate height. Running along the 
 central part of the range, and parallel with its axis, is a continuous 
 notch or incipient valley, about 2,000 or 3,000 feet deep, which never- 
 theless has not yet been deeply enough eroded to form part of the true 
 valley system. 

SEDIMENTARY ROCKS. 

CARBONIFEROUS. 

The great bulk of the Mormon Range is almost free from igneous 
 rocks and is made up of a dark-blue, sometimes crystalline limestone, 
 with some reddish shaly beds. In Meadow Valley Canyon, on the 
 northeast flanks of the range, a spur of this limestone contained the 
 following fossils which were determined by Dr. Girty, of the United 
 States Geological Survey, to be Upper Carboniferous: 

Crinoid steins. Productns punctatus?. 

Fenestellid. Spirifer cameratus. 

Fistulipora sp. . Spiriferina gonionotus. 

Productns nebraskensis. Seminula mira. 
 Prodnctns splendens?. 

This is probably the Red Wall limestone group of Gilbert's Grand 
 Canyon section.^ 

The same limestone series is exposed in Hackberry Canyon, a few 
 miles south of here, and it probablj' constitutes the bulk of the range. 

In drift from the southern part of the range, found in the southern 
 part of Meadow Vallej^ were pebbles containing the following Upper 
 Cai'bouiferous fossils: 

Syringopora multattennata. Chsetetes milleporaceus? 

Fnsnlina cylindrica. Prodnctns semireticulatns. 

Archseocidaris sp.
