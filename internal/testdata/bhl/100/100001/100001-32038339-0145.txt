found, overlying the more massive dark-blue limestone, a series of 
 pink sandstones, clierty limestones, and shales of considerable thick- 
 ness. At Kane Spring, thin-bedded, siliceous, cherty limestones, 
 with yellow, limy shales, belonging to this upper series, contain poorly 
 preserved fossils, referre<i by Dr. Girty to the Upper Carboniferous. 
 This is undoubtedly the Aubrey group of the Grand Canyon section.'* 
 The Aubrej^ Carboniferous lies conformably on the Red Wall Car- 
 boniferous, and both lie conformably beneath the lower rhyolite 
 series of Meadow Valley Canyon.^' They are separated from the later 
 Tertiary formations, especially the probable Pliocene sandstones and 
 conglomerates, by a marked unconformity. 

PLIOCENE. 

The Pliocene which lies against the flanks of the Mormon Range, 
 in Meadow Valley Canyon, will be considered in the special descrip- 
 tion of the canyon. The rocks consist of horizontal or slightly undu- 
 lating red, gray, and brown sandstones and conglomerates, the latter 
 often honeycombed, rising to a height of about 5,500 feet above sea 
 level, and lying against the folded limestones of the mountains. The 
 conglomerates contain pebbles of the fossiliferous Carboniferous 
 limestones, as well as of the older Tertiary formations. 

As seen from the gap between the Mormon Range and the Muddy 
 Range, large areas on the eastern side of the Mormon Range are 
 probably occupied by Pliocene strata similar to those found on the 
 western, these beds covering much of the broad valley between the 
 Mormon Range and the Virgin Range. 

IGNEOUS ROCKS. 

Despite the fact that much volcanic material was found closely 
 adjacent to the Mormon Range on the north and west, there seems to 
 be little in the range itself. The volcanic rocks on its western flanks 
 will be treated in the description of Meadow Vallej^ Canyon. 

STRUCTURE. 

The Mormon Range, as viewed from the west, appears to consist 
 chiefly of an anticlinal fold, whose trend diverges somewhat from 
 that of the range, since it runs in a direction west of north, while that 
 of the range runs east of north. On the western slope of the range 
 there was observed a parallel synclinal fold of comparatively small 
 extent, flanked by another slight anticline still farther west. These 
 two folds are probably local. They are succeeded on the west by a 
 syncline Avhich occupies the broad plateau valley in which Meadow 
 Vallej^ Canj'on lies. (See fig. 10.) 

As seen from the north the maiii anticline is comparatively gentle,
