the clips on both sides appearing to be 
 about 15°. Farther south, however, 
 these dips gradually increase, and in 
 one conspicuous peak in the south- 
 central part of the range the strata are 
 sharply compressed, forming a type of 
 structure quite unusual in the desert 
 ranges, but still present, especially in 
 certain ranges Ij'ing closelj^ east of the 
 Sierra Nevada.'' 

It has already been noted that the 
 limestone which forms the Mormon 
 Range seems to be conf ormabl}^ over- 
 lain, on the flanks of the range, by a 
 Tertiarj^ rhyolite and rhyolite tuff 
 series.* That there was an erosion 
 interval between the Carboniferous and 
 the rhyolite period is shown by the 
 irregularity of the contact, as, for ex- 
 ample, at the mouth of Hackberry 
 Canyon, where the rhyolite is found 
 on one side of the canyon and not on 
 the other. Nevertheless, most of the 
 folding which brought about the forma- 
 tion of the range certainlj^ did not begin 
 until after the rhyolite period. The 
 limestones must also have taken j)art 
 in later movements, evidenced by fold- 
 ing in the postrhj^olitic Tertiary rocks 
 to be described in considering Meadow 
 Valley Canyon, which are separated 
 from the rhyolites by an unconformity. 
 Thus the total amount of folding in the 
 range is the combined result of all the 
 Tertiary movements, which, from phe- 
 nomena observed in Meadow Valley Can- 
 yon, seem to be still in progress. 

MUDDY RANGE. 

The Muddy Range is a soutliAvard con- 
 tinuation of the Mormon Range, being 
 separated from it only by the gap of 
 Muddy Creek. It extends south to the 
 Colorado River, where it is separated 
 from the Colorado Range hy Boulder 
 Canyon.
