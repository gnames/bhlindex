SPUKR.] MUDDY RANGE. 137 

SEDIMENTARY ROCKS. 

The Carboniferous strata of tlie Mormon Rani>e appear in tlie field 
 to be continuous into the northern end of the Muddy Range. The 
 soutliern portion of the range, however, is represented on the Wlieeler 
 survey geologic map as composed of Triassic rocks." 

At the extreme southern end of the range, in Boulder Canj^on, only 
 the Archean igneous rocks and gneisses are exposed, as described by 
 Mr. Gilbert.* These are overlain by Tertiary- lavas. 

The following observations were made b}^ Mr. R. B. Rowe'^: 

CARBONIFEROUS. 

About 4 miles west of Logan, on Muddj" Creek, there occurs prob- 
 ably Carboniferous limestone, overlying Mesozoic sandstones and 
 conglomerates. Between Logan and Weiser's ranch, above the Nar- 
 rows, Paleozoic limestone is again shown, being brought against the 
 Mesozoic by a heavy fault. The Mesozoic also seems to lie conform- 
 ably upon the limestone on one side of the fault plane. 

Fossils collected 3 miles west of Logan post-office by Mr. Rowe 
 were determined by Dr. Girty a"s rather doubtfull}^ Permian. 

MESOZOIC. 

At the first locality above-mentioned, 4 miles west of Logan j)Ost- 
 office, there are bright-red hills of massive cross-bedded sandstone 
 showing no bedding iDlanes. West of these hills are softer red-clay 
 beds, bluish shale beds, gray conglomerates, and thin limestone beds. 
 Some of the limestone beds contain fossils, regarded by Mr. Rowe as 
 Jurassic. Mr. Rowe's collection was examined by Mr. T. W. Stan- 
 ton, who referred it possiblj^ to the same horizon as fossils from simi- 
 lar beds in the south part of the Spring Mountain Range. He believes 
 the horizon is not younger than the Triassic and may be as old as the 
 Permian, but as the forms are all new no definite statement can be 
 made. 

One of the conglomeratic strata contains considerable petrified 
 wood. From some of the darker shales of the Mesozoic some narrow 
 seams of coal, from one-half to one inch in thickness, have been 
 reported. 

At the second localitj^ mentioned above, between Logan and 
 Weiser's ranch, the Mesozoic again appears, lying conformably upon 
 the limestone.^ 

TERTIARY. 

On the north side of Muddy Creek, above the old California cross- 
 ing, are the red, j^ellow, and bluish deposits of the Tertiary. On the

f' This Mesozoic is mapped as Triassic to conform with the Wheeler survey mapping in the 
 southern part of the I'ange. It will be ob.3erved, however, that these beds may be, in part at 
 least, the same as those mapped in the Spring Mountain range as Jurassic.
