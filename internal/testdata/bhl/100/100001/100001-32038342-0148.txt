south side, and iindoubtedl}^ connected with these, are clay deposits 
 of considerable thickness and extent. 

Between Logan and Weiser's ranch red and yellow clays and ancient 
 talus deposits, now hardening into conglomerates, lie un conformably 
 upon the Mesozoic. 

IGNEOUS ROCKS. 

In the northern part of the range the writer* observed volcanic rocks 
 overlying the folded strata. On the Wheeler maps patches of basalt 
 are shown in a similar relation in the southern part of the range, and 
 these extend, as described by Mr. Gilbert, to Boulder Canyon. 

STRUCTURE. 

At the northern end of the range the stratified rocks seemed from 
 a distance to dip eastward at high angles, but the actual structure w^as 
 not made out. The folding probablj^ decreases rapidly toward the 
 south. 

The following observations were made by Mr. R. B. Rowe : 
 About 4 miles west of Logan there is probably a fault between 
 the Paleozoic and the Mesozoic. The Mesozoic dips quite sharply to

the west. Between Logan and Weiser's ranch the fault is beautifullj^ 
 shown, bringing the Mesozoic against the Paleozoic limestones. On 
 the west side of the range the Mesozoic seems to line conformably 
 upon the limestone. The dip of the limestone is almost perpendicu- 
 lar, while the Mesozoic lies against it, with a much lower dip, on the 
 east side. (See fig. 11.) 

COLORADO RANGE. 

The Colorado Range is a southward continuation of the Muddj^ 
 Range, and is separated from it by the Colorado River at Boulder 
 Canyon. Its geology is represented on the Wheeler geologic atlas
