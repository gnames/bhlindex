ELDORADO RANGE. 

The Eldorado Range lies west of the Colorado Range, being separated 
 from it by the Colorado River. As represented on the Wheeler atlas, 
 its geology is abont the same as that of the Colorado Range. 

MEADOW VALLEY CANYON. 
 TOPOGRAPHY. 

Meadow Valley Canyon is cut in the bottom of a broad north-south 
 plateau vallej", which separates the Meadow Valley Range on the west 
 from the Mormon Range and other mountains on the east. Although 
 the canyon is dry for long stretches, yet such water as may flow in it 
 is carried to the Colorado, of whose drainage the canyon forms a part. 
 That portion of the valley which is here described is about 90 miles 
 in length, extending from the vicinity of Pioche soutliward to West 
 Point or Moapa. The canyon begins a short distance south of Pioche, 
 and grows continually deeper toward the south. The continuation of 
 Meadow Valley northward from Pioche is called Duck Vallej^, which 
 is a tj-pical broad desert valley with no canyon. Opposite Pioche 
 the appearance is already unlike that of the tj^pical desert vallej" of 
 the region. There comes in a central narrow strip of level wash, 
 marking the channel of drainage, while on both sides there rises to 
 the mountains a detrital slope, which, unlike that of most Nevada 
 valleys, is cut up into low hills. To the south the central drainage 
 channel becomes deeper, the slopes sharper, and the hills more cut up. 
 To the north the reverse is the case, until the valley appears almost 
 flat, like the typical Nevada valley. 

From the vicinity of Pioche the incision of the drainage into the 
 valley bottom becomes progressively more pronounced southward, 
 until some few miles south of Panaea a box canyon begins, which 
 soon attains a depth of 500 feet, and, within a few miles, 1,000 or 
 1,500 feet (PL VI, A). Some miles south of here, at Kernan's ranch, 
 the canyon walls are estimated to be fully 2, 000 feet high. Still farther 
 south, and just northeast of the Mormon Range, the valley widens out 
 into a broad basin inclosed by mountains, for a few miles below which 
 another shorter and somewhat lower canj^on is entered. Below this 
 is a broad, gently sloping plateau- valley, in which the drainage chan- 
 nel, though generally sharp, is shallow. This plateau gi'ows wider 
 toward the south, as also the vallej^ which is cut in it. At the junction 
 of the Muddj^ Creek and Meadow Creek drainage, near West Point or 
 Moapa, the valley is 2 miles wide. 

Meadow Vallej^ Canj'on ofl"ers exceptional advantages for study. 
 Most of the Nevada deserts are nearly level, and appear to be filled 
 with Pleistocene accumulations, mostly subaerial. Observations in
