some of these flat valleys, however, show that Tertiary rocks crop out in 
 patches and that the Pleistocene cover is onlj^ a veneer. But, tliere 
 being no drainage, in these valleys, there is very rarely an opportunity 
 to find sections cut by running waters, so as to study the real valley 
 filling. In Meadow Creek Canyon we have such an opportunity. 
 The slight incision in the valley opposite Pioche grows to a continuous 
 canyon 1,000 or 2,000 feet deep, whose walls afford excellent sections 
 of the Tertiary sediments and lavas which constitute the real valley 
 filling between the ranges of Paleozoic strata on either side. 

PALEOZOIC ROCKS. 

On the west of the valley, the Highland and Meadow Valley ranges, 
 and on the east the Mormon Range, are composed of Paleozoic strata, 
 the Highland Range being chiefly Cambrian, the rest largely Carbon- 
 iferous. Between these mountain ranges the valley probably existed 
 before the deposition of any of the Tertiarj^ rocks. 

RHYOLITE. 

The oldest of the post-Paleozoic rocks noted in Meadow Valley Can- 
 yon was j-hj^olite. This Avas flrst encountered at the ui)per end of the 
 canyon, near Yokum's ranch, where it occurs in rugged outcrops. A 
 specimen proved to be a siliceous biotite-rhyolite. This has been 
 eroded, and against it has been laid down a horizontally stratified 
 white rhyolite sandstone derived from it. The sandstone is hardened 
 and forms cliffs and buttes. The rhyolite is thoroughly decomposed. 

South of here, the basal rhyolite may be traced for some short dis- 
 tance in the canyon walls till it sinks below the bottom of the 
 canyon and gives place to an enormous series of the overlying rhyolite 
 sandstones, which contain interbeclded thin sheets of rhj^olite. There 
 are in many places evidences that the basal rhyolite was eroded before 
 the deposition of the overlying detrital series, for the latter often rests 
 in the irregularities of the surface offered bj^ the former. The rhj^o- 
 lites and the overljang derived sediments are folded throughout (dip- 
 ping exceptionally as much as 30Â°, though usually deviating only 
 slightly from the horizontal), and are often faulted, small faults 
 being numerous, and those of KX) feet or more being not infrequent. 

The basal massive rhj^olite was again observed at Hackberry Can- 
 yon. In the section afforded here the lowest member is a white bio- 
 tite-rhyolite, thoroughly decomposed. At the mouth of the canyon 
 this rhyolite overlies the Carboniferous limestones conformably', the 
 whole being folded together and unconformable to the overlying for- 
 mations. 

RHYOLITE-SANDSTONE SERIES. 

At the upper end of Meadow Valley Canyon, at Yokum's, the con- 
 solidated rhyolite sandstone and conglomerate whicli overlies the 
 massive rhyolite has alreadj^ been described, and also its occurrence 
 in the canyon immediately^ to the south, where it succeeds the basal
