lava above an apparent erosion gap and is folded with it. The 
 rhj'olite-saudstone or tnff series is overlain unconformably by ande- 
 site, and is also cut by thin intrusive sheets of it. 

There appears also to have been considerable disturbance even 
 during the deposition of the rhyolite-sandstone or tuff series, which 
 is expressed by slight erosion gaps and irregularities between adjoin- 
 ing beds. During the deposition of this series, therefore, periodic 
 effusion of thin sheets of lava and erosion seem to have gone on 
 simultaneousl3^ Some of the thin rhyolite sheets rest one upon 
 another with diverging angles of banding, indicating to the observer

 being white stratified rock. 

This series was estimated to be 4,000 feet thick, and is exposed 
 soutliAS'ard to a point about 45 miles south of Pioche, where it gives 
 place, on account of the general southerl}^ di]3 of the folded beds, to 
 later overlying sediments and lavas. 

ANDESITE-LATITE SERIES. 

There is found, overlying the rhyolite-sandstone or tuff series, at 
 Yokum's ranch and in the canj^on to the south, several hundred feet 
 of basic lava, specimens 
 which proved to be in gen- 
 eral bronzite-biotite-ande- 
 site. A specimen coUecte;! 
 just above Yokum's, prob- 
 ably from the same gen- 
 eral series, is biotite-horn- 
 blende-C[uartz-latite. 

This andesite-latite se- 
 ries rests unconformably 
 upon the basal rhyolite or on the overlying rhyolite tuff (fig. 12) and 
 also intrudes them in thin intercalated sills (fig. 13). 

From the northern end of the canyon the andesites were not 
 observed for many miles southward, but in Hackberry Canyon they 
 were again found exposed in exceptionally good section. Here they 
 overlie the basal rhyolite unconformably, and are themselves tilted so 
 as to be unconformable below the overlying sands and gravels. At
