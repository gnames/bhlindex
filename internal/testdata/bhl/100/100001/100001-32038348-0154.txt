GEOLOGY OF NEVADA SOUTH OF 40TH PARALLEL, [bull. 

this point, as also at the northern end of Meadow Valley Canyon, the 
 andesite contains considerable masses of volcanic breccia. It is con- 
 sidex'ably decomposed, though not so much as the underlying rhyolite, 
 and specimens proved to be pyroxene-andesite. 

REDDISH DACITES AND RHYOLITES AND ASSOCIATED SEDIMENTS. 

In the southern half of the northern portion of Meadow Valley 
 Canyon, above the open basin to the northeast of the Mormon Range, 
 the andesites were not observed; but the rhyolite sandstone or tuff 
 formation was found to be overlain by beds of brown and yellow tuff, 
 containing a variable amount of red lava, in the form of sheets. The 
 great variability in thickness of the lava sheets, and, therefore, of the 
 interbedded sandstones, makes a study of the series very difficult, no 
 two sides of the canyon ever matching; but, so far as examined, the

volcanic rocks found in this upper reddish series are in part biotite- 
 hornblende-dacite and in part pink rhyolite. It is not plain in the 
 field whether this series of dacites and reddish rhyolites is older or 
 younger than the andesites, for the two are not found together; but 
 from the fact that the andesite is often found resting directly upon 
 the basal rhyolite, it is inferred that it is probably older than the 
 reddish dacite-rhyolite series. Between the series of red lavas and 
 yellow-brown tuffs and the underlying series of white rhj^olites and 
 white tuffs there is a marked unconformity and erosion gap (fig. 14). 
 The dacites and reddish rhyolites not only form interbedded sheets 
 contemporaneous with the yellow-brown tuffs, and furnish many 
 of the pebbles in the associated gravels, but they have cut the same 
 gravels and tuffs as intrusive sills, which are often of considerable 
 thickness. Thus there are exposed sections in the canyon walls with 
 the reddish volcanics at the base and the j^ellow-brown tuffs above, 
 giving a false appearance, as if the sediments were younger than the 
 lava.
