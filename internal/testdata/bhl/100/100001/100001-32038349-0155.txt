SPTTRE] MEADOW VALLEY CANYOJSI. 143 

At one locality, near Kernan's ranch, the brown tuffs and red lavas 
 were seen to be overlain bj^ a flow of pyroxene-olivine-basalt, whose 
 lower boundary is irregular. 

This whole series of red lavas and brown tuffs is broadly folded, 
 although not so much as the rhyolitic series below. It has in general 
 a southerly dip, and where the canj^on gives way below Kernan's ranch 
 to the broad, level basin which lies northeast of the Mormon Range 
 it is overlain unconformably by horizontal brown sandstone or tuff 
 belonging to a later epoch. 

PLIOCENE BEDS. 

In the valley near Panaca the stream bottom has on both sides 
 scarps 60 to 100 feet high, consisting of horizon tallj^ stratified silt and 
 sand. These sediments are sometimes green and yellow and pass into 
 rhyolitic arkose. The scarps are cut down in a level valley plateau 
 which has an elevation of about 5,000 feet; and from here on both 
 sides a succession of benches, more or less dissected, rise to the moun- 
 tains. The highest well-marked bench was estimated at 6,000 feet. 

In the northern portion of Meadow Valley Canyon, between Carson's 
 and Kernan's ranches, tlie different series of interbedded lavas and 
 tuffs above described, which are all more or less folded, give way for 
 a few miles on the west side of the valley to a deposit of about 2,000 
 feet of clean, brown volcanic sandstone and tuff, beautifully stratified 
 horizontally, and extending to the top of the hills. The deposits are 
 unfolded and unbroken, dipping south about 2°, and having a maxi- 
 mum elevation of about 5,500 feet. In the upper part of this sand- 
 stone series there seems to be a few sheets of rhyolite and basalt, the 
 basalt being the younger. 

South of Kernan's ranch a series of brown, horizontally stratified, 
 volcanic sandstones or tuffs comes in uncomformably above the 
 slightly folded red lava and brown tuff series, and fills the broad basin 
 which lies northeast of the Mormon Range. Of these horizontal sand- 
 stones there is shown in the bottom of the valley a thickness of about 
 800 or 900 feet, although neither the bottom nor the top was seen. 
 Below the sandstones are barely exi)osed horizontal conglomerates, 
 well indurated, and containing pebbles of various sizes up to 2 feet in 
 diameter. This sandstone series continues south, and lies up against 
 the slopes of the Mormon Range to a height of about 2,000 feet above 
 the valley or about 5,500 feet above sea level. The lower portions of 
 the sandstone are indurated, while the upper parts are softer. They 
 are often honeycombed i;i consequence of unequal consolidation and 
 erosion. In one locality they are overlain by a sheet of very recent 
 tordrillite. These horizontal rocks acquire a slight wavy structure 
 on approaching the spur of Paleozoic limestones which constitutes 
 the southern barrier of the basin. There are developed gentle folds 
 with axes parallel to the spur, and dijjs averaging not more than 10°.
