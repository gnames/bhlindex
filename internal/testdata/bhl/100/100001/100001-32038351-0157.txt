Paleozoic limestones and sand- 
 stones. At this point a fault lias 
 displaced the Paleozoic rocks, but 
 not the overlying conglomerates, 
 showing that it occurred before the 
 deposition of the latter (fig. 16). A 
 short distance south of here the 
 horizontal sandstone is brought to 
 the bottom of the canyon by the 
 dipping down of the contact be- 
 tween it and the lower formations, 
 and from liere to the neighborhood 
 of Moapa or West Point it is the 
 principal formation exi^osed in the 
 valley, the older Tertiary deposits 
 not being observed and the Pale- 
 ozoic rocks only in patches. 

Froui Kane Spring southward to 
 Grapevine Spring, a distance of 
 about 3 miles, there is a ver}^ inter- 
 esting section (fig. 17). Above the 
 upturned and eroded Paleozoic 
 limestones occur the consolidated 
 brownish sandstones, grits, and 
 conglomerates of the horizontal se- 
 ries. The conglomerates contain 
 pebbles of limestone, chert, and 
 quartz from the Paleozoic series, 
 white rhyolite from the basal rhyo- 
 lite series, and characteristic red 
 lava from the dacite-rhyolite series 
 (PI. VI, B). There has been a slight 
 local folding of the brown sand- 
 stones and conglomerates, Avhich 
 seems to have been partly caused 
 by the advent of a considerable 
 sheet of rhyolite. This rhyolite 
 overlies the sandstones and has 
 also cut into them as sills. Prob 
 ably, however, part of the fold, 
 iug took place before the intru- 
 sion. At Grapevine Spring there 
 has been a late faulting which has 
 disj^laced the lava as well as the 
 sandstones, and here also the up- 
 turning of the strata has been
