 the uj)turned edges of the brown sandstones here, and also upon the 
 later rhj^olite, is a series of consolidated grits and conglomerates,

 colors of the beds below (fig. 18). Southward from GraiDevine Spring 
 to Moapa, the horizontal gray sandstone and conglomerate is contin- 
 ually observed overlying the red and yellow series, which is again 
 horizontal and mostly conformaljle to it. 

The very slight folding of all the beds which have been described 
 under the last head separates them from all the underlying uncon- 
 formable Tertiary series. Their position, structure, and distribution 
 show that they are probably lake beds, and, indeed, they lie, partly

In the section between Kane Spring and Grapevine Spring the ^ 
 moderately tliick sheet of rhyolite above noted is of an age intermedi- 
 ate between the lower brown Pliocene sandstone series and the upj)er 
 gray Pliocene series, since it overlies the one and underlies the other. 
 It is a glassy rock, and veiy little can be told of its composition.

At several points very recent lavas are seen, which form the latest 
 phase of volcanic activity in this region. In the canyon near the 
 northern end of the broad basin which lies northeast of the Mormon
