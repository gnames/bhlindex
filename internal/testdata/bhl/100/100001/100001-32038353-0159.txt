Near the southern end of the same basin a thin sheet of glassy tor- 
 drillite comes down into the valley, covering the hills in such a way 
 as to show that the present topograj)liy was developed before the lava 
 effusion. 

At Hackberr^^ Canj'on thin sheets of glassy lava overlie the hori-

 sheets, taken at different but neighboring points, proved to lie tor- 
 drillite and pyroxene-olivine-basalt. The two seem to be practically 
 contemporaneous, and both must be regarded, from their position and

Through all the rocks previousl}^ described, except part of the 
 Pleistocene rhj^olites and basalts, the drainage has cut a canyon in 
 places as much as 2,000 feet deep. The detritus removed b}^ this 
 cutting has chiefly been carried down the valley and out to the Colo- 
 rado River, but a certain portion still floors the vallej^ bottom. 

SEQUENCE OF EVENTS. 

Out of the complicated conditions observed at so many points in 
 the valley of Meadow Creek, the following rough sequence of events 
 may be provisionallj^ laid down : 

1. Deposition of the Paleozoic series of quartzites and limestones. 

2. Elevation of this series to a land mass and the erosion of the 
 rocks to produce a system of mountains and valleys. This was 
 attended hy little or no folding. 

3. Pouring out of great masses of white biotite-rhyolite (early 
 Tertiary.) 

4. The formation of a series of water-laid rhvolitic sandstones and
