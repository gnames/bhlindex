tuffs, interbeclded Avith thin sheets oL" rhyolite and rhyolite bveccias. 
 This wliole series is ronglily estimated at 4,000 feet thick and at the 
 top contains relatively more tuffs, while at the bottom there are rela- 
 tively more lavas. Several slight unconformities and manj^ slight 
 erosion gaps occur in the series. 

5. Folding to a considerable degree of the whole crust. 

6. Explosive eruptions of pyroxene-andesites and latites of mod- 
 erate extent. 

7. The formation of a series of water-laid brown volcanic tuffs or 
 sandstones and breccias, with interbedded quartz-bearing volcanics, 
 chiefly dacites and reddish rhyolites. The sandstones were relatively 
 thick at the bottom of the ^series, the volcanics at the top. The entire 
 thickness of the series is estimated at 3,500 feet. There are some 
 petty erosion intervals. 

8. General folding, comparatively gentle. 

9. Deposition of at least 2,000 feet of brown or red conglomerates 
 and soft sandstones, which are accompanied by very few volcanic 
 flows and so are distinct from the preceding formations. They have 
 remained nearly horizontal and are probably, in large part at least, 
 lake beds. They have been referred to the Pliocene. 

10. Drainage of the Pliocene lake, erosion and slight local folding 
 in the Pleistocene. 

11. Outpouring of thin sheets of rhyolite, tordrillite, and pyroxene- 
 olivine-basalt. 

12. The formation of a small amount of high stream gravels. 

13. Cutting down of the canyon bed to its present position. 

The thickness of the basal rhyolite is not known. A^ver}^ roughly 
 estimated section of the overlying formations is as follows:

The succession of lavas, so far as can be made out in this confused 
 section, is as follows: Biotite-rhj^olite, p^a-oxene-andesite, biotite- 
 hornblende-quartz-latite, biotite-hornblende-dacite, quartz-latite or 
 red rhyolite and tordrillite, pyroxene-olivine-basalt, glassj^ rhyolite 
 or tordrillite. 

MEADOW VALLEY RANGE. 

The Meadow Yalloy Range lies oi)posite the Mormon Range, on the 
 west side of Meadow Valley. It is comparatively low and irregular. 
 At the north end it i)asses into tlie Highland Range and at the south
