into Las "S^eg'as Range, with which it forms a V. Near this point it 
 lioeonies broader and divides into several parallel petty ridges. 

SEDIMENTARY ROCKS. 
 The Meadow Valley Range is composed chiefly of stratified rocks. 

CAMBRIAN. 

I'he mining camp of Delamar is situated on the western slope of 
 the Meadow Vallej' Range. According to Mr. Emmons^' the range 
 here consists of limestones underlain by heavy quartzites, these for- 
 mations corresponding to the Cambrian quartzites and the limestones. 
 There is a belt of shale, as at Pioche. These rocks are continuous 
 northward into the Highland Range, but on the east are overlain by 
 later volcanics. 

CARBONIFEROUS. 

Along the road which crosses the range from Moapa toward Pah- 
 ranagat Valley an excellent section is obtained. Tlie rocks are 
 Paleozoic limestones and form two synclinal ridges, with an interior 
 anticlinal valley between. The eastern part of the section con- 
 sists of rather thin-bedded limestone, full of chert nodules. These 
 apparently overlie the strata of the westernmost ridge, which are 
 dark-blue, semicrystalline limestones, also full of chert nodules, and 
 containing some quartz veins. This is often fetid, and is more mass- 
 ive and of older appearance than the other limestones of the section. 

Where the road cuts through the low eastern ridge the follow- 
 ing Upper Carboniferous fossils were found, as determined by Dr. 
 Girty: 

Fusiilina cylindrica. 
 Archaeocidaris sp. 
 Productus pratteniamis. 
 Prodtictiis semiretictilatus. 

From the apparently lower rocks of the western ridge the following 
 fossils were collected (also Upper Carboniferous): 

Zaphrentis sp. 
 Productus? sp. 
 Spirifer sp. 
 Seminula sp. 
 Macrocheilina? sp. 

Between the western ridge and the eastern face of the New Moun- 
 tains to the west, which are an important branch of Las Vegas Range, 
 a low ridge runs along the middle of the valley, joining the more 
 massive mountains on the south at the angle of the V. This ridge 

a Oral oommunication.
