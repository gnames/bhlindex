is composed of fetid tliin-bedded limestones, like those just described. 
 The following- fossils were found by Dr. Girty to be Upper Carbon- 
 iferous : 

Fusulina cylindrica. 
 Syringopora niultattentiata. 
 Productus semireticulatus. 
 Productus prattenianus. 
 Pleiirotomaria sp. 

PLIOCENE. 

The Pliocene of the southern portion of Meadow Valley'^ extends 
 westward and forms the flanks of the Meadow Valley Range, abut- 
 ting nnconformably against the upturned Paleozoic limestones. The 
 rocks consist of horizontal red and white sandstones and occasional 
 conglomerates, varied a short distance east of Moapa by a white con- 
 solidated volcanic ash. The Pliocene strata occupy a broad belt 
 running north and south. They are locall}^ slightly folded, dipping 
 as much as 10Â°, but in general are horizontal. 

On the western side of the range, in the bay between it and the 
 New Mountains and Las Vegas Range, the same Pliocene sandstones 
 occur. 

Some distance north from Moapa and just northwest from Hack- 
 berry Spring, as seen from Meadow Valley, the Pliocene deposits 
 seem to rise along the flanks of the Paleozoic Range until they occupy 
 broad areas covering the limestones on the summits of the range, 
 they themselves being capped by volcanics. 

IGNEOUS ROCKS. 

In the northern half of the range a great part of the rocks exposed 
 at the surface seem to be volcanics, undoubtedly belonging to the 
 Tertiar}^ and Pleistocene flows already described in Meadow Valley 
 Canj^on. Thej^ probabl}^ are associated with Tertiary sediments 
 derived from them, like the beds in the locality mentioned. 

STRUCTURE. 

The northern end of the range seems to be chiefly volcanic, from 
 which the underlying Paleozoics emerge in places. South of here 
 appear volcanics and associated Tertiary sediments, and the main 
 ridge in the whole southern part of the range consists of folded Paleo- 
 zoic limestones. The structure in the Paleozoic limestones consists 
 of open j)arallel anticlines and synclines, generally of no great width 
 or depth. North of the valley of the Mudd}^ the central ridge is syn- 
 clinal, with an anticline closely adjacent to it on the eastern flanks 
 of the ridge. Irregularities in the erosion sometimes bring this anti-
