eline to the crest of the ridge, as shown 
 in a section observed northwest of Kane 
 Spring. Just west of Grapevine Spring, 
 however, the syncline forms the summit. 

South of Mudd}' Yalle}^ on the road 
 wliich runs westward from Moapa, the 
 bioadening and dividing range shows two 
 principal synclinal ridges with an interven- 
 ing nonpersistent anticlinal valley. The 
 SA'ucline of the westernmost of these ridges 
 appears to be continuous with the main sj^n- 
 clinal ridge farther north. Besides these 
 main folds several petty ones were ob- 
 served to the east of the easternmost large 
 syncline, consisting of slight alternating- 
 anticlines and sj^nclines. In the whole 
 section no less than six adjacent open 
 folds were observed, the sjniclines gener- 
 ally forming ridges, the anticlines depres- 
 sions. West of the westernmost syncline, 
 a low Carboniferous ridge in the valley 
 has a westerly clip, and in the depres- 
 sion between it and the synclinal ridge 
 is an anticline, as is shown in the moun- 
 tains which terminate the depression be- 
 tween the two ridges a few miles farther 
 south (fig. 20). 

PAHROC RANGE. 

The Pahroc is a comparatively short 
 range of no great height, lying immedi- 
 ately west of the Highland Range and 
 having a due north-south trend. Its length 
 is not over 25 miles and its width not 
 more than 5 or 6 miles. Only the north- 
 ern part of the range was seen by the 
 writer, and that from a distance of several 
 miles. 

IGNEOUS ROCKS. 

Mr. Gilbert^' rej)orts that the Pahroc 
 Range, on the road from Hiko to Pioche, is 
 of lava, which extends a number of miles 
 north and south.
