152 GEOLOGY OF NEVADA SOUTH OB^ dOTH PARALLEL, [bull.208. 

SEDIMENTAPa" ROCKS. I 

As seen fi-oin the north, the northern end of the range is made 
 up of stratified roeli;s of moderate-l}^ tliick bedding, evident!}" lime- 
 stones. These rocks extend for some distance fartlier south. Judg- 
 ing from the rocks found just north of liere, in the low hills Avhich 
 have been described as forming the connection between the Pahroc 
 Range and the southern end of the Egan Range a short distance 
 northwest of Pioche," the rocks of the Pahroc Range thus exposed are 
 perhaps, in part at least, Devonian. The Silurian may possibly be 
 represented. 

STRUCTURE. 

The limestones which constitute the northern end of the range seem, 
 when viewed from a distance, to be bent into a single, regular, anti- 
 clinal fold, which strikes parallel to the north-south trend of the range. 
 The summit of the range appears to com^jrise the axis of the fold, and 
 from this the rocks dip on l)oth sides at a gentle angle, averaging 
 about 15Â°. 

HIKO RANGE. 

The Hiko Range lies next southwest of the Pahroc Range, with 
 which it is joined at several points by low connecting hills. It has a 
 north-south extent of about 30 miles, and, like the Pahroc Range, its 
 general trend hardly diverges from a due north-south line. On the 
 west the Hiko Range is connected by a series of hills with the Pahran- 
 agat Range, and this series of hills continued farther Avest connects 
 these ranges Avith the Timpahute Range and the Worthington Moun- 
 tains. Like the Pahroc Range, .the Hiko Range is comparatively^ Ioaa'. 

SEDIMENTARY ROCKS. 

Most of the Hiko Range is composed of limestone of Silurian and 
 DcA'onian ages. Mr. Gilbert* first described Silurian fossils from 
 Fossil Butte, just Avest of the main range. Subsequentlj^ Mr. Wal- 
 cott ^ made an investigation of the paleontology here, and described 
 many species of fossils. According to Mr. Walcott there is exposed 
 in Fossil Butte the Pogonip limestone of the Eureka series, overlain 
 by the Eureka quartzite. Near Hiko he found shaly limestone, OA^er- 
 lain by arenaceous limestone carrying a DcA^onian fauna. 

IGNEOUS ROCKS. 

Accoi'ding to Mr. Gilbert,'^ there are a fcAV small bodies of laA^a in 
 the range.
