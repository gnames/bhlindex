SPUKR] HIKO AND PAHRANAGAT RANGES, 153 

STRUCTURE. 

Mr. Gilbert « found in the Hiko Range north of Fossil Butte a 
 westerly clip, but south of this point an easteii}^ dip. There has 
 been no folding, and therefore* there is a scissors fault''' transverse 
 to the range at about this point. This same peculiar structural 
 feature, according to Mr. Gilbert, is characteristic of all the ridges 
 west of here as far as the Tinipahute Range. 

PAHRANAGAT RANGE. 

The Pahranagat Range lies next southwest of the Hiko Range, 
 with which it is connected at its northern end by Fossil Butte. From 
 here it extends southward in a general south-southeasterly direction 
 for about 40 miles, where it is separated from the Arrow Canj^on 
 Mountains by a comparatively short transverse stretch of desert 
 valley. The highest mountain in the range is Quartz Peak, at its 
 northern end. 

SEDIMENTARY ROCKS. 

Mr. Gilbert^ found Silurian fossils in the northern end of the 
 range. Mr. Walcot t '^' found on the eastern side of the Pahranagat 
 Range limestones which he regarded as possibly belonging to the 
 Lone Mountain series of the Silurian. In Quartz Peak, just west of 
 here, he found a fine exposure of Silurian strata comprising the fol- 
 lowing divisions:

South of Quartz Peak he found a great thickness of limestone, 
 nearl}^ 8,000 feet in all, broken onlj'^ by thin beds of yellow sandstone, 
 the heaviest not over 100 feet in thickness. In this g'reat thickness 
 of limestone he found no lithologic variation sufficient to base 
 divisions upon. From the fossils contained he found that the lime- 
 stone ranged from Carboniferou-^ through the Devonian into the 
 Silurian. It was impossible to draw any line of demarcation

bThe writer has employed this term thinking that it was already in use. Mr. Gilbert, how- 
 ever, who has examined the manuscript, believes that the term is original here, and it is there- 
 fore defined as a fault whose movement is like that of a pair of scissors when opened, there being 
 on the fault plane an axis where the differential movement is nothing, while on one side of this 
 axis the movement is the reverse of what it is on the other. Therefore the rocks on the two 
 sides of the fault plane will acquire tilts in opposite directions.
