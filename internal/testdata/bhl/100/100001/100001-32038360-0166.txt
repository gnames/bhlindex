IGNEOUS ROCKS. 

Mr. Walcott noted occasional outbursts of acidic lavas in the Pah- 
 ranagat Range, and Mr. Gilbert describes two large eruptions of 
 rhyolite, one at the north end of the range and the other at Logan 
 Pass at a cross fault. 

STRUCTURE. 

According to Mr. Gilbert the cross fault above-mentioned is a scis- 
 scors'* fault, having such differential movement that all the strata to 
 the north acquired a westerly dip, while those to tlie south are tilted 
 toward the east. That portion of the range which lies north of the 
 cross fault is divided into separate north-south ridges by north-south 
 faults whose downthrow has been uniformly to the east. South of 
 the pass the strata have a single, monoclinal, easterly dip. 

ARROW CANYON RANGE. 

The Arrow Canyon Range has not been visited and was onlj^ seen 
 from some little distance. It is a continuation northward of that 
 branch of Las Vegas Range which has been called the New Mountains. 
 It has a general northwesterly trend, j)arallel with the main west arm 
 of Las Vegas Range, and has a length of more than 20 miles. On 
 the north it is separated from the Pahranagat Range by a nari-ow, 
 transverse valley. 

As seen from several points, the Arrow Canyon Mountains are made 
 up of stratified rocks, well banded, but eroded so as to form massive 
 cliffs. This is the apijearance offered by the heavy Carboniferous 
 limestone of this region, as shown just south of here in the New 
 Mountains. It is possible, therefore, that the bulk of the range is 
 Carboniferous. To the north also, in the Pahranagat Range, Carbon- 
 iferous rocks are present in considerable quantity. 

The strike of the strata is parallel with the trend of the range. 
 Along nearly the whole of its western side the rocks are seen to dip 
 into the range eastward at angles of from 15° to 20°. Farther north 
 an area of apparently horizontal strata can be distinguished; so that 
 the general structure of the range maj'^ be synclinal, corresponding 
 to that of the New Mountains to the south, or it may be a general 
 monocline dippiug eastwardly, like the Pahranagat Range.
