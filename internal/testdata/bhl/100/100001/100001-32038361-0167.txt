SPURR] AKKOW CANYON AND LAS VEGAS RANGES. 155 

LAS VEGAS RANGE. 

Las Vegas Range forms an irregular group in the central portion 
 of southern Nevada, lying just east of another irregular group, the 
 Spring Mountain Range. Las Vegas Range has hardly any defijiite 
 form, but a prolongation on the northwest gives it rather the 
 aspect of having a northwesterly trend. This pixjlongation forms one 
 arm of a rough V, of which the southern portion of the Meadow 
 Valle}' Range forms the other, the two uniting in a rugged cluster 
 of mountains in the neighborhood of Gass Peak. Bisecting the 
 angle of the V is a high, rocky ridge, which was not delineated on the 
 Wheeler survey maps, and which the writer will call, for the purpose 
 of description, the New Mountains. 

It is peculiar that so prominent a ridge should have escaped map- 
 ping, for it comprises some of the highest mountains in the southern 
 part of the State. On the eastern face of the New Mountains is a 
 sharp scarp of about 4,000 feet, rising from the foothills. This scarp 
 is often perpendicular for great heights, and is apparently inacces- 
 sible. The rocks are composed of massive limestone, beautifully 
 banded. To the north the New Mountains become lower and are 
 separated from the Arrow Canj^on Mountains, which are reallj^ a 
 portion of the same general range, by a transverse valley. 

The south-^iBst face of Las Vegas Range, facing Las Vegas Vallej^ 
 also possesses a steep slope, reaching 45Â° at some points. 

No igneous rock whatever was found in Las Vegas Range. 

SEDIMENTARY ROCKS. 
 CAMBRIAN. 

From a point about 6 or 7 miles north of Mormon Wells, which is on 
 the wagon trail crossing the southern portion of the range in a north- 
 easterljT^ direction, southward probably to the end of the range, the 
 rocks consist chiefly of bristly weathering siliceous, crystalline, cherty 
 limestone, often having a peculiar mottled structure, which is proba- 
 bly due to the rock having been originally made up of coral, now 
 recrj'stallized and unidentifiable. This rock is lithologically identical 
 with Cambrian limestones in the Highland Range west of Pioche. 

On the divide south of Mormon Wells there are found thin, brown 
 and red, sandy, and limj^ slates, changing to thin-bedded limestones. 
 These contain fossil remains, which are determined by Mr. Walcott 
 as belonging above the OleneUus zone and probably to the Middle 
 Cambrian. Fragments of white quartzite were found in the drift here, 
 which also suggest the existence of Lower Cambrian quarzites in the 
 mountains. 

The same ancient-appearing limestones are continuously exposed 
 along the road above mentioned, southwest nearly to Las Vegas Val- 
 ley. At this point they give way to the underlying Silurian.
