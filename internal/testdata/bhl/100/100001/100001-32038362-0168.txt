156 GEOLOGY OF NEVADA SOUTH OF 40TH PARALLEL, [bull. 208. 

Mr. R. B. Rowe noted that the first ridge west of Sheep or Gass 
 Mountain (which ridge is here considered the northernmost part of 
 Las Vegas Range) consists of beds of dark-blue and gv&y lime- 
 stone, with white and reddish sandstone. Fossils collected in this 
 locality were found b}' Dr. Girtj^ to be chiefly Devonian, but to con- 
 tain one Cambrian specimen. Therefore, probably both the Cambrian 
 and the Devonian are here represented. 

SILURIAN. 

In the vallej^ just northeast of Gass Peak, at the locality above 
 mentioned, occur cherty, blue-graj^ and siliceous, sometimes green 
 and shaly, limestones similar to those of the Cambrian. The few,^ 
 fossils obtained from these rocks are regarded by Mr. Walcott as rep- 
 resenting H horizon about the base of the Pogonip (Ordovician). Mr. 
 Walcott determined Ortliis perveta (?) and the tail of a trilobite 
 belonging to the genus Batliyurus. 

From this point to the northwestern end of the range the rocks â–  
 appear to be all limestones, of the same ancient character as tlioise 
 already described, as specimcKS obtained here and there show. Ai 
 similar limestone extends still farther northwest into the southern 
 end of the Desert Range, and was followed continually along Las Vegas- 
 Valley to Indian Spring in the Spring Mountain Range. At Indian 
 Spring iDrdovician fossils were found. 

About miles northeast of Corn Creek, near the mouth of the first 
 important canyon, Mr. R. B. Rowe found about 200 feet of dark 
 blue limestone, containing immense numbers of gasteropods of enor- 
 mous size, together with a few corals. The fossils collected hy Mr. 
 Rowe were determined bj' Dr. Girty as Ordovician. 

DEVONIAN. 

The existence of Devonian limestones in the ridge west of Sheep or 
 Gass Mountain, at the north end of the range, has already beeni 
 mentioned. 

CARBONIFEROUS. 

The Cambrian rocks in the neighborhood of Mormon Wells are 
 apparently separated by a heavy east- west fault from the unmetamor- 
 phosed massive blue limestones which make up the greater portion of 
 the New Mountain ridge and the auxiliary ridges to the east. In one 
 of these auxiliary ridges a collection of fossils was obtained, which 
 were found by Dr. Girty to be Upper Carboniferous. No north-south 
 faults were determined, and the gentle folding, resulting in slight, 
 alternating synclines and anticlines, suggests that rocks of the same 
 horizon make uji the New Mountains to the west. 

According to the notes of Mr. R. B. Rowe, the mountains east of 
 Las Vegas contain the Lower Carboniferous, the Carboniferous red
