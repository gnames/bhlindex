3eds, and the Upper Carboniferous limestone, so far as can be seen 
 Tom Las Vegas ranch. 

From Sheep or Gass Mountain, in Las Vegas Range, specimens of 
 (xoniatites were brouglit and given to Mr. Rowe. The fossils seem to 
 3ome from a soft shale.'* 

About 2 miles west of Sheep or Gass Mountain, in a spur of that 
 *ange, about 5 or G miles north of the road leading from Corn Creek 
 j:o Indian Creek, fossils were collected which were determined by Dr. 

irty as Upper Carboniferous or Pennsylvanian, and in the same 
 General region other fossils were collected which were determined. by 
 Dr. Girt}' as Lower Carboniferous or Mississippian. The ridge con- 
 "lists mainly of low hills, wliich are cut extensively by canyons. 

Terfianj. — -Mr. R. B. Rowe's notes on the Tertiary areas follow. 
 lAt Las Vegas and in the immediate vicinity there are white beds of 
 probabl}" volcanic ash. From the vallej^ some distance west of Las 
 V^egas mastodon teeth were collected. About midwa}^ between Corn 
 Creek and Tule Springs some mastodon teeth and bones have been 
 found. They were situated in a clay bank some 10 or 15 feet high. 

East of the range, at the summit of the pa^ss between Las Vegas 
 Valley and Muddj^ Creek, about 12 miles east of Las Vegas, are 
 fed and yellow Tertiary beds which dip toward the Colorado River at 
 an angle ranging from 4° to 5°.* 

The valley between Las Vegas, Tule Springs, and Corn Creek seems 
 to be filled with lake deposits. About Tule Springs, and from there 
 up the valley, are probably the remnants of an old, dry lake bed or 
 playa. The deposits do not have the appearance of the Tertiary lake 
 deposits, but resemble exactly the clay deposits in the present dry 
 lakes. Underlying these is a gravel or talus deposit. The eroded 
 drv lake beds extend froni Corn Creek to Indian Creek. 

PLEISTOCENE. 

In Las Vegas Vallej^ the Tertiary deposits so abundantly exposed 
 in the region of Meadow Valley are hidden beneath Pleistocene 
 accumulations. This valley is of the usual type of the desert valleys 
 of Nevada, with gulch dumps fringing the mountains, and in the 
 center a nearly level area of hard mud flats, or a playa. There has 
 been no dissection of these deposits to reveal what lies beneath. 

STRUCTURE. 

The general folding in Las Vegas and New mountains has apparently 
 resulted in a rough, shallow, disturbed northeast-southwest striking 
 syncline. The nearly horizontal area in the central portion of the range 

« These maybe the same as some specimens of Goniatiies rec3ived by Dr. Girty from. Mr. 
 Rowe's collection after the death of Mr. Rowe. They were considered by Dr. Girty as Lower (?) 
 Carboniferous. 

''These are the same as described by the writer under the head of 'Meadow Valley Range."
