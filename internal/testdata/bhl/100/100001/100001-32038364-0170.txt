belongs in the trough of thes^^ncline, while at the northwestern end the 
 dip of the northwest limb of the fold becomes 30° or 45° southeasterly, 
 or even more. The sjaicliue is succeeded by a much sharper anti- 
 cline along the narrow valle}^ separating the Desert and Las Vegas 
 ranges. In the broad central portion of the syncline there has been 
 irregular minor folding, chiefly along east-west lines, the dips gener- 
 ally being under 15°. At the southern end of the range the general 
 strike appears to become east and west, and the dip about 20° north. 

The main fold of Las Vegas Range, being at right angles to the 
 general trend of the mountains, runs across Las Vegas Valley and is 
 probably to be found in the Spring Mountain Range on the other side, 
 where, indeed, it Avas thought to have been identified by the writer. 
 Similarly, the various ijarallel ridges of limestone which run trans- 
 verse to the general trend of the range are broken by the valley and 
 find their continuation in the Spring Mountain Range opposite. Las 
 Vegas Valley, therefore, differs from the most ordinary type in the 
 Great Basin in that it is transverse to the general strike of the rocks. 

In the region north of Mormon Wells there is a marked change 
 from massive, unaltered, blue limestones, probably belonging to the 
 Carboniferous, to altered, ancient-appearing, crystalline limestones, 
 associated with shales can-ying Cambrian fossils. The areas occupied 
 by these different rocks may be easily sketched, since the erosion of 
 each has resulted in peculiar forms. The Cambrian rocks have 
 rounded topography, without scarps or evident structure, and weather 
 brown, while to the north the blue-gray Carboniferous rocks have 
 sharp scarped outlines with perfectly visible stratification. Inasmuch 
 as the strike of the folds is here north and south, which carries the 
 Carboniferous limestone directly into the Cambrian, there must be a 
 fault between tlie two horizons, and this fault must have, as sketclied, 
 a direction somewhat north of west. The vertical disj)lacement of the 
 fault maj^ be several thousand feet and has resulted in a downthrow 
 to the north. There is no distinct brealv in the topography along the 
 fault line. 

The bold east face of the New Mountains suggests a more recent 
 heavy fault, to whose displacement the scarp maj^ perhaps be directly 
 due. 

The following notes on the structure were made by Mr. R. B. Rowe: 

A sketch of the mountains of Las Vegas Range east of Las Vegas 
 shows a constant dip of about 40° to the east. A hypothetical fault 
 is also shown, which has the effect of bringing up the lower strata on 
 the east side. 

In ear Corn Creek the rocks strike east and west and dip uniformly 
 30 ° to the north. 

As has been noted, there is a^jparently a series of old, dry lake 
 deposits in Las Vegas Valley, which are now being cut into by 
 the arroyos. These, taken together witli the fact that the surface 
 rises about 400 to 600 feet between Tule Sjarings and Com Creek
