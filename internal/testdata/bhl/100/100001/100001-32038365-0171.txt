and that the same beds rise still higher bej^on«l Corn Creek, indicate a 
 comparatively recent elevation of the upper end of Las Vegas Valley. 
 On the east side of Las Vegas Range, the fact that the Tertiary 
 beds dip slightly toward the Colorado at an angle of 4° or 5° suggests 
 that the Las Vegas Range has been slightly raised since the general 
 elevation of the region. 

TIMPAHUTE RANGE. 

The following summary of the Timpahute Range is taken from 
 Mr. Gilbert's description." 

The Timpahute Range lies next west from the Pahranagat Range 
 and immediately south of the Worthington Mountains. Its general 
 trend is a little east of north and its length about 30 miles. The 
 highest portion is Timpahute Peak, near the southern end. 

SEDIMENTARY ROCKS. 

At the south end of the range Mr. Gilbert * measured a thickness 
 of 2,325 feet of strata showing the following section:

1. Heavy-bedded gray limestone, light and dark 400 

2. Yellow argillaceoiis shale:

b. Yellow sandstone, 75 feet | 

c. Yellow and green shale, with fillets of , fossiliferons limestone | 

(Conoconjphe) , 500 feet J 

3. Piarple, ripple-marked, vitreoiTS sandstone, with bands of siliceous shale. 1, 000 

Total -. 2,325 

The fossils found in the shales above the basal quartzite fix the 
 formation as Cambrian, and the basal quartzite is the same as the 
 basal quartzite of the Highland Range Cambrian section and also 
 the Prospect Mountain quartzite at Eureka." 

The northern portion of the range does not appear to have been 
 described. Both to the east and to the west of it, in the Worthing- 
 ton Mountains and in the Pahranagat Range, are Silurian rocks, in 
 part Lower Silurian. It is probable, therefore, that this north end of 
 the Timpahute Range is in part Silurian and in part also Cambrian. 

IGNI]OUS ROCKS. 

According to Mr. Gilbert,'^ Timpahute Peak is the center of a 
 massive eruj)tion of rhyolite, which connects with a similar eruption 
 northeast of here in the Pahranagat Range by a line of volcanic 
 hills which runs across the intervening valley.
