160 GEOLOGY OF NEVADA SOUTH OF 40TH PAEALLEL. [bull.208. 

STRUCTURE. 

The volcanic outburst at Tiinpaliute Peak, according to Mr. Gil- 
 bert/' is on the line of a scissors fault, whicli has so displaced the 
 strata that to the north of this fault they dip uniformly west while to 
 the south thej^ dip nniformly east. This fault is on the same line as 
 a similar fault northeast of here in the Pahranagat Range, and 
 another still farther northeast in the Hiko Range, and in each of 
 these ranges the peculiar tilting of the strata above noted is found. 
 In the Timpahute Range the sedimentary rocks south of the line of 
 faulting are separated by north-south vertical faults which have a 
 uniform downthrow to the west. Mr. Gilbert gives a section of the 
 range showing this structure. 

ORE DEPOSITS. 

In the Cambrian shales at the southern end of the range, according 
 to Mr. Gilbert,^ are metalliferous veins. 

DESERT RANGE. 

The Desert Range is somewhat irregular and of moderate height. 
 It is divided into two branches by an interior valley which reaches 
 northward from the north end of the Spring Mountain Range. At 
 its north end the Desert Range passes into the valley which sepa- 
 rates the Timj)ahute from the Pahranagat Range. 

SEDIMENTARY ROCKS. 

The south end of the Desert Range was visited by the writer. It 
 consists of altered, crystalline, light-gray limestone, brown weathei-- 
 ing, often full of rounded, detrital quartz grains. There are also 
 beds of black, dense limestone. Similar limestone contains Ordovi- 
 cian (Pogonip) fossils in the western part of Las Vegas Range. This 
 limestone series can be distinguished extending northward fully half- 
 way to the end of the range, at least 20 miles. It is possible that it 
 may contain some of the Cambrian limestones which are hardly 
 separable lithologically from the overlying Silurian. 

Mr. F. B. Weeks'' followed along the west side of the range and 
 crossed the north end, at Mud Spring, in 1900. He found the bulk 
 of the range to consist of stratified rocks, which he was inclined to 
 consider as Silurian and Devonian, while on the north end these 
 strata are replaced by volcanic rocks. 

The following notes were made b}^ Mr. R. B. RoAve:'^

About 8 or 9 miles northeast of Indian Creek, in the first range on 
 the west side of the dry lake which lies east of Indian Creek, and about
