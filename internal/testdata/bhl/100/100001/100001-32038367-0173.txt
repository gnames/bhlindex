spiTRR.] DESEET AND REVEILLE RANGES. 161 

•4 miles north of the road from Indian Creek to Corn Creek, tlie section 
 consists chiefly of dark-bine limestone, with light-bine arenaceons 
 limestones and shaly limestones with chert layers. There are also a 
 few layers of white sandstone, resembling- qnartzite. Fossils collected 
 were regarded by Mr. RoAve as Ordovician, and his impression was 
 corroborated by Dr. Girty's examination. 

The rocks 4 miles east of Indian Creek are light-gray, arenaceons, 
 and dark-bine limestones, with laj^ers of chert and white sandstone, 
 which is nearly a qnartzite, as it is farther east. These rocks were 
 regarded b}'^ Mr. Rowe as probably Lower Silnrian. 

DEVONIAN. 

Abont o miles northeast of Indian Creek, in low hills sonth of the 
 road leading to the lower end of Pahranagat Valle}^ and north of the 
 road to Corn Creek, fossils were found in loose blocks of dark-blue 
 limestone. These were regarded by Mr. Rowe as Middle Devonian, 
 and were determined by Dr. Girty as probably Lower Devonian. 

STRUCTURE. 

At its southern end the range is separated on the southwest from 
 Las Vegas Range by a narrow anticlinal valley, the rocks of the Desert 
 Range dipping northwest on the northwest limb of the fold. The 
 general strike here is northeast, and a series of parallel ridges has 
 been eroded parallel to the strike. The dip continues in the same 
 direction as far as the interior valley dividing the two chief branches, 
 but becomes flatter, and the strike swings around more toward the 
 north. On the western branch of the range, as seen from the south, 
 the rocks are j)artly horizontal and partly strike a little east of north 
 and dip uniformly west at angles not exceeding 15°. 

The valley lying between the ridge lying west of Sheep Mountain 
 and the range next west, or between Las Vegas Range and the Desert 
 Range, was regarded by Mr. Rowe as anticlinal in structure." The 
 mountains on the two sides dip in opposite directions. On the west- 
 ern side Ordovician fossils were found ; on the eastern side Carbonif- 
 erous and Cambrian. There are probably large and numerous faults 
 concealed by the talus. There is a great deal of plainly observable 
 faulting at right angles to the strike. These faults are generally not 
 large, but are abundant.* 

REVEILLE RANGE. 

The Reveille Range is separated on the north from the Pancake 
 Range by a narrow transverse gap at Twin Sijrings. It extends 
 southeastward from here a distance of about 60 miles, running 
 obliquely across to the Timpahute Range. 

"This is the same anticlinal valley that was previously observed by the writer (see above) 
 (J.E.&.). 
 bThis whole paragraph is from Mr. Rowe's notes.
