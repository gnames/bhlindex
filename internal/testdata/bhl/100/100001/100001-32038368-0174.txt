GEOLOGY OF NEVADA SOUTH OF 40TH PARALLEL, [bull. 

TOPOGRAPHY. 

The range is somewhat irregular in its course and extent, which 
 arises from its being made up largely of volcanic outbursts. This 
 also accounts for the prevalent tj^pe of topography, which is similar 
 to that of the Pancake Range to the north, showing low peaks and 
 broad, gently sloping mesas, which are sharply cut into by the valleys 
 eroded since the period of lava effusion. At one or two points, how- 
 ever, such as that near the old mining camp of Reveille, xjatches of 
 older Paleozoic strata, and of older volcanics than those which form 
 tlie mesa-like forms, emerging from the younger lavas, offer a series- 
 of sharp, irregular peaks and better developed valleys. 

SEDIMENTARY ROCKS. 

According to Mr. Gilbert," the Paleozoic strata which form the core 
 of the Reveille Range are exposed at but two points, one at Reveille 
 and the other 60 miles farther south. In both these cases the rocks 
 dip to the west, the dip being steeper at the more southern exposure. 
 At Reveille the strata are of limestone and quartzite.

The more northerly locality was Adsited by the writer, and so far as 
 a hasty examination could determine, the lowest formation seems to 
 be a hard white quartzite, surmounted by a dark-blue massive lime- 
 stone, much altered and cariying only indeterminable fossils. As 
 seen from Reveille, the mountain to the east seems to have at its base 
 about 1,500 feet of quartzite, capped by 2,000 feet of limestone. The 
 strike is north and south, the dip W. 15° or 20°. If the section is 
 actually as supijosed, the rocks can hardly be other than the Cam- 
 brian quartzite and limestone of the Eureka section.^ 

The strata are traversed by many i^orphjay dikes, probabl}^ con- 
 nected with the rhyolitic outbursts. The rhyolite wraps around these 
 limestone mountains in such a way as to show that they were already 
 sharp peaks previous to the pouring out of the lava (fig. 21).

6 Ibid., p. 1V9, Mr. Gilbert cites Prof. J. J. Stevenson as having recognized Carboniferous rocks 
 at Reveille. In view, however, of the confusion of Carboniferoiis and older rocks at this period 
 (several other Cambrian areas having been referred to the Carboniferous) and in view of the 
 fact that the lithology of the region is that typical of the Cambrian here, but probably not 
 chai'floteristic of the Carboniferous, the writer has decided to retain in the mapping the Cambrian 
 color.
