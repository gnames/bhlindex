TERTIARY. 

In the transverse cut across the northern end of the mountain range 
 at Twin Springs the section consists of volcanic rocks and water-laid 
 tuffs and gravels derived from them. At the base of the section is 
 altered biotite-rhyolite, and above comes about (300 feet of white 
 rhyolitic sandstone. This is (japped by 100 feet of rhyolitic tuffs and 
 gravels, surmounted by about 100 feet of angite-olivine-basalt. 

IGNEOUS ROCKS. 

As already stated, most of the range is made up of igneous rocks. 
 Those Avliich outcrop most upon the surface appear to belong to the 
 later, more basic lavas, of which the augite-olivine-basalt at Twin 
 Springs is a member. This same basalt is found on the east of the 
 higher mountains between Twin Sjirings and Reveille. Beneath this 
 basic lava, however, the older biotite-rhyolite frequently comes to the 
 surface and is distinguishable by its more rugged topograj)hy. 

RELATIVE AGE OF IGNEOUS ROCKS. 

In the section at Twin Springs it is shown that the rhj^olite is older 
 than the basalt. Between Twin Springs and Reveille the intervening 
 series of tuffs disappears with increasing elevation, and the basalt 
 mantles around the base of craggy rhyolite eminences in sucli a way 
 as to show that they were already mountaius before the basalt 
 appeared. The disappearance of the intervening tuffs also suggests 
 that the higher rhyolite ijeaks Avere mountains in the lakes in which 
 the rhyolitic tuffs were laid down. 

ORE DEPOSITS. 

In the vicinity of Reveille are mines which formerl}^ were very 
 profitable, but which are now almost entirely deserted. The mines 
 are situated in a patch of limestone and quartzite surrounded by 
 volcanic rocks, and the ores probably have genetic connection with 
 the dikes which traverse the sedimentaries.

^' BELTED RANGE. 

The Belted Range runs southward from the Reveille Range and 
 forms, in its southern part, the eastern boundary of the Aniargosa 
 Desert. It is somewhat irregular, but has a general north-south 
 trend. At its northern end it is separated from the Reveille Range 
 by a slight interval of low, lava-covered country, while at its south 
 end it is separated from the low mountains Ijing north of Pahrump 
 Valley by a considerable intervening area of Pleistocene subaerial 
 deposits. Its name has probably been given to it on account of the 
 horizontal banding visible for a long distance on its steep sides.
