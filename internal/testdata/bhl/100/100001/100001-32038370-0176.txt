SEDIMENTARY ROCKS. 

CAMBRIAN. 

The Belted Range was crossed by Mr. Gilbert during his recon- 
 naissance for the AVheeler survey. He notes that at White BlufE 
 Spring and for several miles southward the range shows an axis of 
 quartzite.*^ This he regards as the same formation as a similar 
 quartzite recognized in the Timpahute Range, which is of Cambrian 
 age. 

The whole southern portion of the range, as seen from the south, is : 
 of stratified rocks, apparently chiefly limestones. It is probable that 
 this portion of the range forms a part of the general Cambrian- 
 Silurian area, which includes part of the northern end of the Spring 
 Mountain Range, a large portion of Las Vegas Range, and at least 
 the southern end of the Desert Range. 

IGNEOUS ROCKS. 
 VOLCANIC ROCKS. 

Mr. Gilbert^ found that near White Bluff Spring the principal mass 
 of the range was of lavas, which nearl}^ hid the Paleozoic axis. These 
 lavas stretch northeastward and connect with those of the Reveille 
 Range, and also extend westward, forming low mountains, which 
 divide the Ralston Desert from the Amargosa Desert. In these 
 mountains Fortymile Canyon is cut. They extend westward at least 
 as far as Oasis Vallej^, which is the head of the Amargosa River ; and 
 they stretch northward over the whole of the Ralston Desert. <^ 

STRUCTURE. 

The probable structure of the Paleozoic southern portion of the 
 range could only be uncertainly made out from a distant view. In 
 general, however, the rocks appear nearly horizontal, but they some- 
 times dip as much as 15° at least. The general strike is i^arallel with 
 the trend of the range. 

SPRING MOUNTAIN RANGE. 

The Spring Mountain Rauge is an exceedingly irregular-shaped 
 group of mountains, lying southwest of Las Vegas Range, and sepa- 
 rated from the Kingston Range, farther south, by the Pahrump 
 Valley. The general trend of the range is northwest and southeast, 
 and its length in this direction is about 60 miles, and at its northern 
 end, in the neighborhood of Charleston Peak, the total width is as 
 much as 30 miles. This peak constitutes the highest portion of the 
 range, being 10,874 feet above the sea, and is a conspicuous landmark. 
 This range is divided into numerous ridges, which run in many dif-
