SPURR] SPRING MOUNTAIN RANGE. 165 

ferent directions without much visible system. At at least two points 
 at the northern base of the range there occur warm springs, namely, 
 Indian Spring and the spring at White's ranch in Pahrnmp Valley 
 This is interesting, since the range contains few igneous rocks.

The north end of the range was traversed from Indian Spring 
 southwest, b}^ way of Hornet Spring, to White's ranch. At Indian 
 Spring are limestones carrying Lower Carboniferous fossils, as deter- 
 mined by Dr. Girty. Following up the canyon which leads southward 
 to Hornet Spring a great thickness of limestones was passed through, 
 all striking a little north of east, parallel in general with the north 
 end of the range, and dipping northward at angles varying from 20° 
 to 65°. The limestone is all thin bedded. North of the summit of 
 the pass comes in a thin bed of vitreous quartzite. At the summit 
 is a thick white vitreous quartzite, often coarse and nearly conglom- 
 erate, beneath the limestone. Just south of the summit there is an 
 east- west fault which cuts off the quartzite and again brings down 
 the limestone into the section. In this limestone, at a point half a 
 mile south of Hornet Spring, were found abundant fossils, which 
 have been determined by Mr. Walcott to be Cambrian, probably 
 Middle Cambrian. These fossils are in blue-gray semicrystalline 
 limestone like that found above the quartzite north of the fault. It 
 is probable, therefore, that some of the limestones exposed in ascend- 
 ing the canyon north of the summit belong to the Cambrian, and that 
 these pass upward into the Lower Carboniferous limestones at Indian 
 Spring without any marked stratigraphic or lithologic break. The 
 white quartzite at the summit is also probably Cambrian, since it 
 underlies the limestones. 

The thickness of the section shown north of the fault has been 
 estimated at about 17,000 feet, of which an estimated thickness of 
 2,000 feet ma}' be taken for the quartzite, leaving 15,000 feet for the 
 limestones. 

The Cambrian limestones near Hornet Spring are continuous only 
 a short distance south, when they give place abruptly to Carbonif- 
 erous limestones, the two being apparentlj^ separated by an east- west 
 fault, parallel with and only some 3 miles south of the one already 
 mentioned. From this j)oint to the southern end of the range it is 
 probable that no Cambrian rocks are exposed, since Carboniferous 
 fossils are found at many points. 

Mr. R. B. Rowe's notes'* on the Cambrian may be summarized as 
 follows : 

About 7 miles south of Indian Spring, in a high range of hills, 
 were found greenish-yellow shales, with thin, dark sandstone bands
