containing trilobite and linguloid shells. These were nnderlaiu by 
 brownish massive limestone, containing great numbers of trilobite 
 remains. These Cambrian rocks appear to be directly overlain by 
 dark-bine and gray, iDrobably Carboniferous, limestones. The dip of \ 
 the Cambrian rocks is due north, while that of the Carboniferous is to \ 
 the south, suggesting an unconformity,, although the two formations 
 are divided b}^ a covered wash 2^ miles Avide. The Cambrian may be I 
 separated from the Carboniferous here hy a fault or bj^ an uncon- 
 formit3^ 

In the whole Spring Mountain Range nothing was found between 
 the Cambrian and the Carboniferous suggesting a hiatus between the 
 two periods. 

On the southwest side of a traversed line from Indian Creek to Tule 
 Springs (on the east side of Las Vegas Range), from a distance 
 about 5 miles east of Indian Creek to about 5 miles west of Corni 
 Creek, the low hills near the valley are Cambrian, and probablj^ some 
 on the north side of the valley also. About 6 or 7 miles southwest of 
 Corn Creek, on the south side of the valley, there is apparently a 
 fault, bringing the Cambrian against what is i:)robabl3' the Carbon-i 
 iferous (fig. 22). The Cambrian comprises a number of parallel 
 ridges, with steep south-facing escarpments and with strata dii^ping; 
 north. Between the ridges is a covering of talus. 

CARBONIFEROUS. 

At Indian Spring Lower Carboniferous fossils were found in a black, 
 fetid, semicrystalline limestone with brown sandy beds. They were 
 determined bj'^ Dr. Girty as follows: 

Ptilodictya sp. 
 Chonetes sp. 
 ProchictiTS cf. mesialis. 
 Orthothetes 11. 8p. 

Dr. Girt}^ remarks that this fauna can not with certainty be placed* 
 in the Lower Carboniferous, though it is probably of that age. 

These rocks probably constitute a relativel}'^ narrow strij^ at the 
 northern end of the range, and are succeeded on the south by older 
 strata, as above described. 

A few hundred yards south of the ranch at Indian Spring the fol- 
 lowing Carboniferous fossils were collected by Mr. F. B. Weeks, in 
 1900," and were determined by Dr. Girty: 

Zaphrentis sp. Productns cf. P. Isevicosta. 

Rliipidomella oweni. Spmfer keokiik. 

Orthothetes insequalis. Spirifer near neglectiis. 

Prodnctella concentrica ? Seminnla liumilis. 

Prodiictns btirlingtonensis. Camarotoechia sp. 
 Productus semireticiilatus.
