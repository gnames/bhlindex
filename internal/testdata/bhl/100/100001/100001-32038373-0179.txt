SPURK.] SPRING MOUNTAIN RANGE. 167 

At the same locality Mr. R. B. Rowe'* noted and collected Lower 
 C'arboniferons fossils. The rock is massive and chert}' blue and gray 
 limestone, with reddish and yellowish shalj^ and arenaceous laj^ers. 
 The section is as follows from the top downward: 

Section near Indian Sjrrings. 

1. Massive clierty blue limestone, poor in fossils. Thickness unknown. 
 Unconformity. 

2. Red shales with thin bands of blue limestone and yellowish calcareous sand- 

stone, about 300 feet. Lower Carboniferous fossils. 

3. Massive blue limestone filled with crinoids and corals. Thickness unknown. 

Fossils collected from the red shales underlying the upper blue 
 limestone unconformabh^ were determined by Dr. Girty to be Upper 
 Carboniferous or Pennsylvanian, rather than Lower Carboniferous. 
 Therefore the line between LTpper and Lower Carboniferous lies 
 between 2 and 3. 

About half a mile south of Indian Creek, fossils collected by Mr. 
 Rowe from the rocks that apparently underlie Ihe red beds from 
 which the LTpper Carboniferous fossils were taken, were found by 
 Dr. Girty to be Lower Carboniferons or Mississippian. 

About 7 miles south of Indian Creek, the fol'owing Carboniferous 
 section was found by Mr. Rowe, overlying the Cambrian. The sec- 
 tion is given from the toj:* down. 

Section 7 miles south of Indian Creek. 

1. Massive dark-blue limestone, weathering rough, and containing white calcite 

spots. 

2. Light-gray, massive, unfossiliferous limestone. 

3. Massive dark-blue limestone, like No. 1. 

About 3 or 4 miles south of Hornet Spring fossils are found in yellow- 
 weathering, blue, slialy, argillaceous, cherty limestone, which lies to 
 the south of the thin-bedded Cambrian limestone, and is not readily 
 separable from it in the field. In this yellowish, shaly limestone 
 Fusidina cylindrica was found, and the liorizon was therefore deter- 
 mined by Di". Girty as Upper Ca-boniferous. Southward from here, 
 as far as the jDoint where the road enters the foothills, tlie ]"ocks are 
 all similar thin-bedded limestones. 

To the east, Charleston Peak and the high ridge south of it are 
 formed of massive limestone, which has all the appearance of belong- 
 ing to the great Carboniferous series. Mr. Turner has informed the 
 writer that Carboniferous fossils have actually been found on Charles- 
 ton Peak by surveyors. 

On the east side of Charleston Canyon Mr. Rowe* noted that the 
 range seemed to be made ux3 of Carboniferous limestone. Well down 
 in these strata some fossils were found, chiefly Fusulina. The rocks 
 are light-gray arenaceous limestones, containing considerabk^ chert.
