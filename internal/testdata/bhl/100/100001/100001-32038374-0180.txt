1G8 GEOLOGY OF NEVADA SOUTH OF 40TH PARALLEL, [bull.208. 

Fossils collected by Mr. Rowe were identified hy Dr. Girty as Peuu- 
 sylvauian oi- Upper Carboniferous. 

la the foothills of the range, just east of White's ranch, in Pahrump 
 Valley, a collection of Lower Carboniferous fossils was obtained, as 
 determined by Dr. Girty: 

Zaphrentis sp. Spiriferina sp. 

Aulopora sp. Atliyris lamellosa. 

Fenestella sp. Seminula sp. 

Leptsena I'homboidalis. Rhynclionella sp. 

Chonetes planumbontis ? Beyricliia sp. 

Productus cf. mesialis. Phillipsia sp. 
 Spirifer cf . grimesi. 

About 7 miles north of the above locality the rocks are also Carbon- 
 iferous, according- to a note supplied b}^ Mr. Turner. Fossils were 
 collected bj^ Mr. F. C. Boyce from near Fremont Wash, 7^ miles 
 north-northeast of Manse post-office (White's ranch). On these Mr. 
 Schuchert, of the United States National Museum, reported: 

The fossils * * * are of Carboniferous age. There are two species of Za- 
 phrentis, a Syringopora near multaticnuata and a Spirifer fragment too small for 
 determination. 

South of Manse the range was not visited by the writer, but he 
 observed that the same series of rocks extended east and soutli for a 
 number of miles. Mr. Gilbert, however, observed Carboniferous rocks 
 east and south of here, at Cottonwood Spring^ and at Olcott Peak.^ 
 At the first-named locality Mr. Gilbert made the following section: 

Section at Cottomcood Spring.

 1. Massive red and yellow sandstone: 

a. Yellow, 250 feet 1 

h. Red, 150 feet ". | â€ž 

c. Yellow, 200 feet ' '

d. Red and shaly, 400 feet 

2. Bedded, fine-grained to saccharoid limestone, gray and cream-colored: 
 beds separated by shaly layers so as to weather in steps. [Phillipsia 
 (?) , Macrocheihts (non des.), Naticopsis, Aviculopecten, Avicida, Meek- 
 ella, Myalina, Productus semiretieulatiis, Spirifer lineatus, Athyris

S. Massive gypsum, white and red, in lenticular masses to 70 

4. Gray, massive, cherty limestone:

b. Unseen; red (shale ?) , 25 feet. . _ : \ 475 

c. Limestone, 200 feet . J 

5. Friable sandstone, in places shaly or marly; variegated with brilliant 

iron colors 350 

Total _. ^ 2,395 

The fossils here show that the rocks of the section are Upper Car- 
 boniferous. At Olcott Peak the fossils, according to Mr. Gilbert, are 
 Lower Carboniferous.
