SPURR.] SPRING MOUNTAIN RANGE. 169 

At Mountain Spring, a point about G miles west of Cottonwood 
 Spring, Mr. Gilbert" notes that Mr. C. A. Ogden obtained a set of 
 fossils of facies older than the Coal Measures. Among the forms are 
 PMUi2:)sia, 82:)irifer (two species of Devonian aspect), RhynchoneUa, 
 Hemipronites, Afhyn's (distinct from A. suhtilita), Choneies, Tere- 
 hratula (.^), Productus (like P. subacideatus), and FenesteUa. The 
 horizon is referred to the Lower Carboniferous. 

The following valuable observations on the Carboniferous of the 
 southern portion of the Spring Mountain Range were made bj^ Mr. 
 R. B. Rowe in 1900-1901:* 

Lower Carboniferous. — About 6 miles south of Good Spring, Lower 
 Carboniferous limestones are found, probably separated by an over- 
 thrust fault from Mesozoic strata. The Carboniferous is much altered, 
 but in some of the layers good corals are found. The Mesozoic beds 
 consist of rich shales and sandstones. 

At Mountain Spring fossil-bearing Lower Carboniferous beds not 
 more than 3,000 feet thick occur. Above these are Carboniferous red 
 beds, at least 2,000 feet thick, which are overlain by Upper Carbon- 
 iferous limestone, from 500 to 600 feet thick. Beneath the Lower Car- 
 boniferous is a light-graj^ arenaceous limestone. The line between 
 this limestone and the overljang Carboniferous limestone is sharply 
 drawn. *" 

Carboniferous red beds {Upper Carboniferous). — About one-half 
 mile west of Mountain Spring, on the road to Mule Spring, is a dark 
 fossiliferous limestone lying upon a light-colored, much-altered lime- 
 stone. These limestones are ijrobably Lower Carboniferous. In the 
 vallej^ west of Mountain Spring they are overlain \)y a considerable 
 thickness (2,000 feet?) of red Carboniferous shales and sandstones, 
 which form a greater portion of the Mule Spring Mountains and are 
 capped by the Upper Carboniferous fossil-bearing cherty limestones. 
 On the east side of Mule Spring Mountain the red shales and sand- 
 stones are found at the base, capped b}^ the Upper Carboniferous 
 limestones. 

For 8 or 10 miles north and northwest of Mule Spring the Upper 
 Carboniferous is overlain hy the fossiliferous Jurassic. '^^ There are 
 no red beds or conglomerates between the two formations, although 
 some of the topmost layers of the Carboniferous are conglomeratic. 
 The thickness of the Upper Carboniferous limestone is about 500 feet. 
 The thickness of the Upper Carboniferous red shales and sandstones 
 exposed in this region must be two or three times as much. 

Between Mule Spring and Mountain Spring red sandstone occurs, 
 with a northerly strike and a dip 20° west. 

At Mountain Spring the Carboniferous red beds lying above the
