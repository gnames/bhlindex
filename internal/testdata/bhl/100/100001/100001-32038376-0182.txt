Lower Carboniferous are at least 2,000 feet thick, and are overlain i 
 by 500 to 600 feet of Upper Carboniferous limestone. 

On a divide along the road between Good Spring and Cottonwood 
 Spring, Carboniferous red beds immediately underlie the fossilifer- 
 ous Jurassic,'^ as is the case also at Good Spring; but about G miles 
 east of Cottonwood Spring the Jurassic'^ lies directly upon the Upper j 
 Carboniferous limestone. 

South of Indian Spring, at the northern end of the range, are red 
 shales and sandstones underlying massive blue limestones uncon- 
 formably. The shaly layers and the thin limestone bands in these 
 red beds are fossiliferons. They were determined by Dr. Girty 
 as Upper Carboniferous. The formation here has a thickness of 
 about 300 feet. It overlies blue massive Lower Carboniferous lime- 
 stone. 

U'pyer Carboniferous limestone.â€” For 8 or 10 miles north and noi'th- 
 west of Mule Spring the folded Upper Carboniferous is overlain by 
 fossiliferons Jurassic. " The Upper Carboniferous limestone is about 
 500 feet tliick ; the Upper Carboniferous red shales and sandstones 
 about 2,000 feet thick. The Upper Carboniferous limestone maj^ be 
 divided about equally into (1) upper clierty massive limestone, con- 
 taining abundant fossils; (2) lower light-gray, massive limestone, 
 containing a few fossils. The two portions are divided in some i^laces 
 by layers of red shales and sandstones, as, for example, at Cotton- 
 wood Spring. One-half mile west of Mule Spring Mr. Rowe col- 
 lected fossils determined by Dr. Girtj^ as Pennsylvanian or LTpper 
 Carboniferous. 

On the escarpment of the west side of the Mule Sj)ring Mountain 
 there is exposed the Upper Carboniferous limestone, underlain by the 
 red shale formation. 

At Mountain Spring, Cai'boniferous red beds are at least 2,000 feet 
 thick. They overlie about 3,000 feet of Lower Carboniferous strata, 
 and underlie Upper Carboniferous limestone from 500 to 600 feet thick. 
 Beneath the Lower Carboniferous is a light-graj^ arenaceous limestone, 
 containing no discovered fossils. 

At Cottonwood Spring fossils were collected from the Upper Car- 
 boniferous by Mr. Rowe, and were subsequently identified as such by 
 Dr. Girty.* Upper JCarboniferous beds were followed [some distance 
 south of Cottonwood Spring ; also east of Cottonwood Spring. 

In the hills north and northwest of Cottonwood Spring the Upper 
 Carboniferous is overlain by conglomerate and strongly cross-bedded 
 coarse sandstone, in beds 10 or 20 feet thick. Above these conglom- 
 erates are shales and gypsum beds, above which again are the fossil- 
 iferous arenaceous Jurassic" limestones.
