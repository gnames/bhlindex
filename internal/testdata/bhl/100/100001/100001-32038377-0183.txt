SPURR] SPRING MOUNTAIN RANGE. 171 

About 3 miles southeast of tlie summit, between Good Spring and 
 A\"ilson's ranch, the Lower Carboniferous of the Bird Spiring Range 
 lies against the Upper Carboniferous and Jurassic,'^ being separated 
 l)y a fault. 

About 6 miles east of Cottonwood Spring, directly overlooking Las 
 ^'egas Valley, is an escarpment consisting of Upper Carboniferous 
 beds. These are underlain bj^ lieavj^ shales and brownish micaceous 
 sandstone, much cross-bedded. At this point the red beds seen are 
 not over 50 feet thick. 

Between Good Spring and Cottonwood Spring the Upper Carbon- 
 iferous repeatedlj^ occurs. North of Good Spring a low knoll of the 
 Upper Carboniferous occurs west of the road, up to the Mesozoic 
 cliff at the foot of Oleott Peak (Potosi Mountain). Near the summit 
 both Carboniferous and Mesozoic rocks occur along the road. East 
 and north of Cottonwood Spring are apparentl}^ Carboniferous rocks, 
 while south and west are Mesozoic. 

About 12 miles north of Good Spring, near the divide between Good 
 Spring and Cottonwood Spring, is a small area of Upper Carbonifer- 
 ous, occupying a fault zone which s^^arates the probably Mesozoic 
 red sandstones and shales from the Lower Carboniferous limestones 
 which make up Oleott Peak.* On the east side of Oleott Peak, 
 about 10 miles north of Good Spring, fossils were collected by Mr. 
 Rowe that were identified b}' Dr. Girty as Upper Carboniferous or 
 Pennsylvanian . 

About 3 miles northeast of Good Spring, in the Bird Spring Moun- 
 tains, there was noted about 425 feet of gray, brownish, and pinkish 
 arenaceous limestone. Fossils collected at three different horizons in 
 the series bj^ Mr. Rowe were determined by Dr. Girty to be Upper 
 Carboniferous or Pennsylvanian. 

At Good Sj)ring the following section was obtained, from the top 
 down : 

Section at Good Spring. 

Consolidated ancient tains 6-10 

Arenaceous light-brown limestone, rather thin bedded 610 

In part yellowish and reddish shales and sandstones, which make the same 

red terrane as shown at the eastern base of Oleott Peak 760 

Heavy conglomerate, siibangular pebbles 50 

Gray limestone with some red and pinkish arenaceous layers and cherty 
 layers: the tipper 50 feet is conglomeratic and contains large qiiartzite 
 bowlders: fossils abundant in the conglomerate, less so in the rest 300 

Mr. Rowe regards the 50 feet of conglomerate underlying the red 
 beds as a basal conglomerate, and the conglomerate at the top of the 
 limestone beneath as an apical conglomerate. Fossils of the lower 
 conglomerate collected by Mr. Rowe are regarded hx Dr. GiYij as 
 probably Permian, or uppermost Carboniferous. Fossils collected 

Â« Mr. Rowe's field determination.
