from the arenaceous limestone overlying the red beds are regarded by 
 Dr. T. W. Stanton as not younger than Trias, and perhaps as old as 
 the Permian. 

Fossils collected from the Upper Carboniferous at Cottonwood 
 Spring by Mr. Rowe are regarded as possibly Permian by Dr. Girt3^ 

East and southeast of Good Spring, along the road to Manvel, 
 occurs the contact of the Mesozoic and Carboniferous. On the east 
 and north are Upper Carboniferous beds with fossils identical with 
 those found at Good Spring. The red shales, sandstones, and con- 
 glomerates which He between the Upper Carboniferous and Jurassic 
 at Good Spring and at Olcott Peak are wanting about 5 miles south- 
 east of Good Spring, and the calcareous sandstones of the Jurassic 
 lie directly upon the Carboniferous. The Upper Carboniferous also 
 has lost at this point the conglomerate which lies at its top at Good 
 Spring. 

The mountains near Good Spring are chiefly limestones, with con- 
 siderable sandstone underlying. Fossils collected by Mr. Rowe from 
 the lowest rocks exposed in the Bird Spring Range" were identified 
 by Dr. Girty as Pennsylvanian. or Upper Carboniferous. 

Correlation ivith Grcmd Canyon section. — In the Grand Canj^on and 
 Colorado Plateau region the Carboniferous was studied in the course 
 of the Wheeler survey by Messrs. Gilbert and Marvine. It was 
 divided into the Aubrey limestone, the Aubrey sandstones, and the Red 
 Wall limestone. The Aubrey limestone has a maximum thickness of 
 820 feet, and contains fossils suggesting the Permo-Carboniferous of 
 the Mississippi Vallej^, and indicating the close of the Carboniferous 
 age. The limestone is characterized by a great abundance of chert, 
 which toward the top sometimes constitutes half the mass. Near the 
 middle it is in some places interrupted by a bed of shale with gypsum. 

The Aubrey sandstone has a thickness along the Grand Canyon of 
 about 1,000 feet. A portion is massive and cross-bedded, another 
 portion soft and gypsiferous. The sandstones contain no fossils, but 
 an intercalated limestone bears Coal Measures shells. 

The Red Wall limestone has a gray color on fresh fracture. It is 
 heavy-bedded and massive. Near the top sandstone alternates with 
 the limestone for from 200 to 500 feet. Tiirough its lower half the 
 limestone is interrupted by occasional shaly bands. The average 
 total thickness is 2,500 feet. Fossils are abundant near the top, but 
 in the lower portions are difficult to find. The lowest fossils were 
 found a little below the middle of the series, and were doubtfully 
 referred to the Lower Carboniferous. The fauna of the upper portion 
 is rich, and, while different from that of the Aubrey limestone, is 
 referable to the Coal Measures. 

Mr. Gilbert ^ was not able to exactly correlate the Colorado Plateau
