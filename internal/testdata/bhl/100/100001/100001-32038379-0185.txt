and Grand Canyon Carboniferous witli the Carboniferous series in 
 the Spring Mountain Range. Nevertlieless, the Carboniferous de- 
 scribed by Mr. Rowe seems to bear a general resemblance to the 
 Colorado Plateau and Grand Canj^on section. This correlation may 
 be suggested : 

Correlation of Spring Mountai)i coid Grand Canyon sections. 

Gilbert and Marvine, Grand Canyon section. 

RoXve, Spring Mountain section. 

Aubrey limestone, maximum 830 feet, Upper Upper Carboniferous limestone, 500-600 feet. 
 Carb'oniferoiis. 

Aubi'ey sandstone, l.(XXl feet, probably Upper Carboniferous red sandstone, shale, and con- 
 Carboniferous, glomerate, 1,000-2,000 feet, probably Upper 

I Carboniferous. 

Red "Wall limestone, Upper and Lower Carbon- ' Lower Carboniferous limestones, 3,000 feet, 
 iferous, 3,500 feet. [ 

MESOZOIC. 

Eight or 10 miles north and northwest of Mule Spring the Upper 
 Carboniferous is overlain by fossiliferous Jurassic.^ Among the fos- 
 sils seen in the Jurassic Pentacrinus astericus"' is very abundant. 

About 4 miles west of Cottonwood Spring is a great escarpment, at 
 least 2,000 feet high. It consists of two terranes, the lower being red 
 shales and sandstones, making up about one-third of the height. 
 Above this is a heavj^ yellow sandstone, containing occasional red 
 lenses. These rocks are probably Mesozoic. 

To the east and northeast of Cottonw^ood Spring the hills appear 
 to be Mesozoic also. 

In the hills north and northwest of Cottonwood Spring the Upper 
 Carboniferous is overlain by beds of conglomerate and coarse, strongly 
 cross-bedded sandstone. These beds are from 10 to 20 feet thick. 
 Overlying these conglomerates are 100 feet or more of intercalated 
 white gj-psum beds and red shales, and above these lies the fossil- 
 iferous arenaceous limestone of the Jurassic.'* Near the bottom of the 
 fossiliferous beds is a stratum containing a multitude of Gryphoea/'' 

About 10 miles north of Wilson's ranch, the Carboniferous lime- 
 stone has been brought above massive red Mesozoic sandstone by a 
 great overthrust fault. Between Wilson's i-anch and Red Spring the 
 Mesozoic is also found. About 8 or 10 miles north of Wilson's ranch 
 the same overthrust fault as mentioned above was found. The mas- 
 sive Mesozoic sandstone here is colored pink, bright vermilion red, 
 and white. It is strongly cross bedded everywhere. 

Between Wilson's ranch and Cottonwood Si)ring the low hills show 
 strata which contain Jurassic fossils. 

About three-quarters of a mile south of the summit, between Good 
 Spring and Wilson's ranch, the Jurassic lies at the foot of a ridge 
 made up of Upper Carboniferous rocks, the Carboniferous being sepa- 
 rated from the Mesozoic by a fault. 

a Mr. Rowe's field determination.
