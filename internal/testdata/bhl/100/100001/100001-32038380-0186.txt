174 GEOLOGY OF NEVADA SOUTH OF 40TH PARALLEL, [btjll.308. 

At the foot of Olcott Peak there is a cliff composed of Mesozoic 
 rocks. From here the Mesozoic turns east aud crosses the road before 
 the summit between Good Spring and Cottonwood Spring is reached. 
 Near the summit Carboniferous and Mesozoic alternate along the 
 road. From the summit to Cottonwood Spring, Mesozoic rocks occur 
 on both sides of the road. The rocks in the hills south and west of 
 Cottonwood Spring are Mesozoic. 

On the great fault line which separates the Mesozoic from the 
 Carboniferous between Good Spring and Cottonwood Spring, the 
 fossiliferous Jurassic apparently lies beneath the red and white sand- 
 stones which form the cliffs west of Wilson's ranch. 

At Good Spring the Mesozoic was found overlying the Carbonifer- 
 ous. The following is the section : 

Section of Mesozoic at Good Spring. 

Feet. 

1. Arenaceous limestone 610 

2. At base yellowish and reddish sandstone about 50 feet thick. Above this 

are layers of red and yellowish shale. This may be the same red terrane 
 which shows at the eastern base of Olcott Peak 760 

3. Heavy conglomerate 50 

4. Gray limestone, with some layers of red or pinkish arenaceoiis limestone, 

and abimdant layers of chert. The upper 50 feet contains numerous 
 large quartzite bowlders . 300 

Fossils collected from No. 1 were described, after a preliminary 
 examination by Mr. T. W. Stanton, as belonging to a horizon not 
 younger than the Triassic, and possibly as old as the Permian. The 
 fossils collected from No. 4 were judged to be questionably Permian 
 by Dr. Girty. 

East and southeast of Good Spring, along the road between Good 
 Spring and Manvel, the road runs along the contact of the Mesozoic 
 and the Carboniferous. The red shales, sandstones, and conglomer- 
 ates which lie between the Upper Carboniferous and the Jurassic at 
 Good Spring and Olcott Peak are wanting about 4 or 5 miles south- 
 east of Good Spring, and the calcareous sandstones of the Jurassic 
 lie directly upon the Carboniferous. 

About 6 miles south of Good Spring the Lower Carboniferous seems 
 to be overthrust upon the Jurassic. 

IGNEOUS ROCKS. 

At Good Spring, near the southern end of the range, Mr. Gilbert '^ 
 noted a flow of basalt. Other than this no igneous rock is known in 
 the whole range. Mr. Rowe's notes record the following: 

At the Keystone mine, at the southern end of the range, there is an 
 acid porphyry dike running N. 17° E. Along both sides of this, in a 
 talcose material, gold is found. The dike dips from 35° to 40° W.
