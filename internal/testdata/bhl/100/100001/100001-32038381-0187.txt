SPRING MOUNTAIN RANGE. l75 

East of Bird Spring Range, in the direction of the Colorado River, 
 there appear to be extensive lava fields. 

STRUCTURE. 

The general observed strikes and dips of the strata in the Spring 
 Mountain Range have been plotted by the writer from different points. 
 The results show more complex folding than in any of the mountain 
 ranges to the north and east, and to this folding the irregular shape 
 of the range is probably due. In an east- west section the general 
 structui-e of the range seems to be a broad syncline, with a number of 
 minor folds, of little importance, and all part of the great fold. The 
 axis of this syncline runs northeast and southwest, transverse to the 
 general trend of the mountains and parallel to the axes of the folds 
 in Las A^egas Range, already described, and well over to the western 
 side of the mountains. Mr. Gilbert" gives a section of the Carbon- 
 iferous rocks at Cottonwood Spring, Avhich shows the southeasterly 
 side of this general syncline. 

At a point on the eastern face of the range, due southwest from 
 Corn Creek in' Las Vegas Valle}^ a sharp, slight anticline, constitut- 
 ing a wrinkle in the general syncline and with a parallel axis, may be 
 observed. On the other side of the range a similar anticline runs 
 along the foothills northward from White's ranch for some distance. 
 It afterwards appears to pass into and occupj^the narrow north-south 
 valley l^etween the northern end of the Spring Mountain Range and 
 the low clusters of mountains immediately west. 

In a north-south section, however, the structure of the Spring Val- 
 ley Range appears to be anticlinal, the strike at both the north and 
 south end being in general east and west, and the dip varying up to 
 65° N. at the north end and up to about 20° S. at the south end. 

Taken altogether, therefore, the range exhibits a peculiar fold, anti- 
 clinal in a north-south section, and showing a slightly complicated or 
 wrinkled synclinorium in an east-west section. The portions of the 
 center of the syncline that should lie flat dip north and south at each 
 limb of the anticline. 

Except at the northern end the rocks of the range are chiefly Car- 
 boniferous. At the northern end the Cambrian rocks are brought up, 
 probably, by at least two heavy east-west faults. The northernmost 
 of these faults observed lies north of Hornet Spring, and has appar- 
 ently brought the Cambrian quartzite into juxtaposition with the 
 Cambrian limestone, which stratigraphicall}^ overlies it. The throw 
 of the fault must be at least 1,000 feet, and its course can be traced 
 across the country by the break in the quartzite. The second fault 
 lies 3 or 4 miles south of here, just south of Hornet Spring. It is 
 probably parallel to the first, although it can not be traced so easily,
