since it separates one limestone 
 body from another. Bnt the lime- 
 stone to the north is probably Mid- 
 dle Cambrian, while to the south it 
 is Upper Carboniferous. A ver- 
 tical displacement of several thou- 
 sand feet is here evidenced, the 
 downthrow being to the south, as ■ 
 is also the case with the first fault '■ 
 mentioned. 

These two heavy faults have 
 the same general direction as the 
 heavy fault described in Las Ve- 
 gas Range, and like it they have 
 no primary effect on the topogra- 
 phy, being marked by no scarps- 
 (fig. 22). 

A third fault is suspected at the 
 northern end of the range, sepa- 
 rating the Carboniferous limestone 
 from the supposedly Silurian lime- 
 stone of the immediately adjacent! 
 Desert Range. If this fault ex- 
 ists, its downthrow is, like the 
 others, to the south (fig. 22). 

The following important ol^ser- 
 vations on structure have been; 
 taken directly from Mr. Rowe's; 
 notebooks, after the writing of the; 
 above : 

About 10 miles west and north- 
 west of Mule Spring, the Upper i 
 Carboniferous is thrown into a se- 
 ries of minor faults running in a 
 nearly northwest direction, 
 l^itch is very heavy toward 
 south. These are probably 
 southern ends of the folds 
 uplifts which have brought up 
 Charleston Peak. Together with 
 the folding there was a great deal 
 of minor faulting. A fault with 
 a throw of a few hundred feet is 
 seen about one-half mile west of 
 Mule Spring. On the east side of 
 Mule Spring is a steep escarpment
