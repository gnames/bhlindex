5PURK.] SPRING MOUNTAIN RANGE. 177 

3omj)Osed of Uppei" Carbouiferous limestoues overlying red shales. 
 [u this escarpiiieiit is shown a minor fault or a slight broken fold 
 R^hich appears to be I'ecent and has directly displaced the surface. 

On the west side of Mule Spring, at Mule Spring Mountain, the same 
 formations are shown in a similar escarpment. Here the beds are 
 bhrown into minor folds and faults. 

A great fault runs in a northerly to northwesterly direction directly 
 bhrough the center of the main Spring Mountain Range and through 
 the minor ranges which are coutinous with it on the south (see map, 
 PL I). This is shown 10 miles north of Wilson's ranch, where it 
 funs nearly due north. It was also observed east of Mountain Spring 
 (fig. 34), and at the east base of Olcott Peak (fig. 23), and was traced 
 past Good Spring to the southeast. At Good Spring its course is north 
 and south.

I Mountain Spring occupies the center of the important anticline 
 which forms Olcott Peak or Potosi Mountain. East of Mountain 
 Spring there is exposed the great fault. East of the fault is an ero- 
 sion scarp (fig. 24). 

Between Wilson's ranch and Red Spring, and about 10 miles north 
 of Wilson's ranch, there is an overthrust fault, by which the Carbonif- 
 erous limestone is thrust over the massive red Mesozoic sandstone. 
 Three important faults are shown here — two running parallel and 
 nearly north or west, the other (the great fault) running at right 
 angles, or nearly north and south. 

A,t Cottonwood Spring the apparent section is : 

Jurassic. 

Upper Carboniferous. 

Red Beds. 

Jurassic. 

Upper Carboniferous. 

This can only be explained by a fault. It is to be inferred that the 
 fault is an overthrust. No direct evidence was seen.
