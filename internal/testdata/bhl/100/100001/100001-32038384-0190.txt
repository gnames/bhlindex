178 GEOLOGY OF NEVADA SOUTH OF 40TH PAEALLEL. [bull.208. 

About 1 mile south of Cottonwood 
 Spring the Carboniferous rocks 
 strike S. 63° W., and dip 30° NW. 
 About 6 miles east of Cotton- 
 wood Spring a great escarpment 
 consists of Upper Carboniferous 
 beds underlain by reddish shales 
 and sandstones. Mr. Rowe's sec- 
 tion indicates that the escarpment 
 has been formed by the erosion of 
 these softer beds. 

In the valley east of the Cotton- 
 wood Spring escarpment there is 
 probably a fault within the shale 
 belt. This must be an overthrust 
 fault along bedding planes, because 
 everything r.ppears to be conform- 
 able. Red beds of the Carbonifer- 
 ous overthrust on the red beds of 
 the Mesozoic make the fault diffi- 
 cult to see. Two or three days' 
 search failed to reveal any direct 
 indication (fig. 24). 

There is some minor faulting 
 'shown in the Upper Carboniferous 
 strata about Cottonwood Spring, 
 and some minor folding in the Ju- 
 rassic east of the springs. 

On the divide between Good 
 SiDring and Cottonwood Spring 
 there appears to be some very 
 sharp folding or faulting at right 
 angles to the general trend of the 
 great faults, and at right angles to 
 the great fault running on the east 
 side of the Charleston Range. 

The great fault lying on the east 
 side of the Spring Mountain Range 
 may be followed easily northward 
 from Good Spring to the divide be- 
 tween Good Spring and Cottonwood 
 Spring, 12 miles. On the east side 
 of the fault is heavy-bedded red 
 sandstone and red shales. On the 
 west is Middle or Lower Carbon- 
 iferous and Upper Carboniferous
