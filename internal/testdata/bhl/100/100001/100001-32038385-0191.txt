wedged in the fault by tlie drag- 
 (fig. 23). The section given bj^ Mi\ 
 Rowe shows an anticline over- 
 thrown to the east and faulted. 
 The fold is cut deeply by canyons. 
 Along its axis the rocks are much 
 crushed and broken, and much 
 minor faulting is visible in places. 
 This great fault line was followed 
 north toward AYilson's ranch. It 
 changes its course from about 15° 
 west of north, south of the summit, 
 to 45° west of north, north of the 
 summit. 

About o miles north of Good 
 Spring the Carboniferous is folded 
 into a sharp anticline and sj'ncline. 

The general structure of the Bird 
 Spring Mountains seems to be anti- 
 clinal, with a channel of erosion 
 along the apex of the anticline. 
 There is a fault along the east side 
 of the range which brings the Lower 
 Carboniferous against the red shales 
 and sandstones of the Mesozoic. 
 This fault runs uortliAvest and 
 southeast (see fig. 25). About 14- 
 miles north of Bird Sxjrings there is 
 another fault, which crosses the first 
 one at an angle and brings the 
 Lower and Upper Carboniferous 
 together. 

About 6 miles south of Good 
 Spring the Lower Carboniferous is 
 overthrust upon the Jurassic. The 
 rocks are very much disturbed along 
 the fault line. 

About three-quarters of a mile 
 south of the summit, between Good 
 Spring and Wilson's ranch, there 
 is a fault which brings the Upper 
 Carboniferous above the Jurassic. 
 The fault has a nearly due north- 
 west course. About 3 miles south- 
 east of the summit there is another 
 fault, also running due west, which
