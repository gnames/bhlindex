180 GEOLOGY OF NEVADA SOUTH OF 40TH PARALLEL, [bull.208. 

brings the Upper Carboniferous and Jurassic against the Lower Car- 
 boniferous. These faults are nearly normal to the direction of the 
 main northwest-running faults. Minor folds shown at the summit 
 seem to be at right angles, or nearly so, to tlie main folds running 
 northwest. 

About (3 or 7 miles west of Corn Creek, on the south side of the 
 valley between Las Vegas Range and Spring Mountain Range, tliere 
 is apparently a fault bringing the Cambrian against what is probably 
 the Carboniferous.'' The Cambrian comprises a number of parallel 
 ridges running east and west. The strata dip north. Each of the 
 ridges has a steep escarpment facing south. Possibly there is a series 
 of faults running parallel to the strike. 

Just south of Indian Spring, at the northern end of the range, the 
 Upper Carboniferous limestones show considerable minor faulting 
 and folding. Except where locally folded, the dip of these rocks is 
 generally southwest. About one-half mile south of the spring, yel- 
 lowish arenaceous limestone is brought by a fault against dark-blue 
 cherty limestone. The rocks are much broken, also, bj^ minor faults, 
 which are hard to observe. An unconformity is shown in several 
 places between the red shaly Carboniferous beds and the overljang 
 Carboniferous limestone. 

ORE DEPOSITS. 

In the extreme southern part of the range is the old Potosi or Yel- 
 low Pine mining district. Here there are veins of argentiferous galena 
 in the limestone.^ 

AREA SOUTH OF SPRING MOUNTAIN. 

From Mr. Rowe's notebooks the following information is taken : 
 The range on. the east side of State Line Pass, about 12 miles soutli 
 of Good Spring, shows fossiliferous Carboniferous limestone on the 
 west side. The limestone on the east side is probably also Carbonif- 
 erous, but no fossils were found. Tlie section made by Mr. Rowe 
 seems to show faulting separating the two limestones. The beds dip 
 throughout the whole section to the west. 

Mr. H. ^y. Turner has kindly supplied the following note: 
 Locality on the boundary line between San Bernardino County, 
 Nev., and Lincoln County, ISTev., at State Line Pass, at about G,000 
 feet elevation. Mr. Schuchert states that the collection wliicli was 
 made by F. C. Boj^ce contains two sj)ecies — a CJucdetes, which is 
 usually identified as C. milleporaceus Edwards and Ilaime, and a 
 Productus of the P. cora type. The horizon from wliicli these fossils 
 are derived is Carboniferous, and probably Upper Carboniferous. 

«This is very likely the same fault as described above by the writer (J. E. S.).
