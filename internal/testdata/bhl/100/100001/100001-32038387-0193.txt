SPURR.J KAWICH RANGE AND RALSTON DESERT. 181 

The north end of the jNIeCnlloli Mountains is Carboniferous and 
 seemed to be lithologieally like the Carboniferous of the Bird Spring- 
 Mountains, consisting large!}' of light-gray arenaceous limestones. 

KAWICH RANGE. 

The Kawich Range forms the southern continuation of the Hot 
 Creek Range, from which it is separated at its northern end onh' by 
 a narrow transverse pass. From this point it extends due south about 
 60 miles, where its southern end runs out into the desert valley. 

TOPOGRAPHY. 

The range is high and is deeply eroded into bold, craggy mountains. 
 On both sides the slope of the mountains is steep, es]3ecially on the 
 west, where there are almost impassable cliffs. On the flanks of the 
 range on both sides of the rugged backbone are smoother, mesa-like 
 forms. 

SEDIMENTARY ROCKS. 
 TERTIARY. 

The only stratified rocks known in the Kawich Range are the rhj'o- 
 litic tuffs and sandstones which occur in the pass between the Kawich 
 and the Hot Creek mountains and which also mantle around the north- 
 ern base of the Kawich Range. These strata are evidently the same 
 as those described at Twin Springs, between the Pancake and the 
 Reveille ranges. They are closely associated with Tertiarj^ rhyolites. 

IGNEOUS ROCKS. 

The igneous rocks constitute the whole of the main range, so far as 
 noted. The rough, deepl}' eroded central mass of the mountains is 
 composed of biotite-rhyolite similar to the basal rhyolite of the Reveille 
 Range. In these rhyolites, as in those of the Reveille Range, there is 
 a pronounced north-south jointing or sheeting which is not found in 
 the younger lavas. The dissected mesas found in a narrow belt at the 
 base of the mountains are composed chiefly of more basic lavas, with 
 some acid lavas. From the western side of the range, near its north- 
 ern end, specimens of tordrillite and biotite-andesite were collected. 
 In tlie pass between the Kawich and the Hot Creek niountains decom- 
 posed andesite was found. 

At the northern end of the Kawich Range the rhj^olite abuts against 
 the Paleozoic strata of the Hot Creek Range in such a way as to show 
 that the mountains of the Hot Creek Range were already eroded out 
 of the limestones before the rhyolites were extruded. 

RALSTON DESERT. 

East of the Sierra Nevada there is a belt of mountain ranges which 
 have a Paleozoic or old granitic core, which have considerable heights, 
 and whose general trend is northwest and southeast, parallel with the 
 face of the Sierras. In this belt the rocks show frequently compressed 
 or even overthrown folds, yet have experienced vastly less compres-
