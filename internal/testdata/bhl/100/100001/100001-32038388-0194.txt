sion than the intensely folded and sheared strata of the Sierra. East 
 of these auxiliary ranges there is a belt which is comparatively free 
 from Paleozoic or old granitic ranges. It has been covered in many 
 places by late Tertiary or Pleistocene lavas, so as partly to conceal 
 the fact that it is a broad depression, but nevertheless this character 
 is still traceable and even well marked on a topographic map. This 
 great belt runs northwest and southeast, parallel with the Sierra, and 
 separates the region of northwest-trending ranges on the west from 
 the north-south trending ranges on the east. 

The Ralston Desert forms a portion of this. Northwest of the Ral- 
 ston Desert the depression is continued by the lower end of Big Smoky 
 Valley, by Sinkavata and Gabbs valleys, and farther north by the 
 region of Carson and Pyramid lakes. Beyond this it appears to run 
 up into Oregon. 

On the south the Ralston Desert is separated from the Amargosa 
 Desert bj^ an irregular belt of late Tertiary volcanic mesas, through 
 which Fortymile Canyon is cut. At the south end of the Amargosa 
 Desert the open belt becomes narrow, but farther south passes into 
 the Mohave Desert. 

The Ralston Desert is bounded on the north and south by late 
 Tertiary volcanic mesas, which, indeed, are found throughout its ex- 
 tent, so that these boundaries are rather arbitrarily taken. On the 
 west the desert ends at the chiefly Paleozoic Silver Peak and Grape- 
 vine ranges, while to the east it is limited chiefly by the rugged 
 Kawicli Range, which apiDcars to be j)rincipall3^ rhyolite. 

In general the desert consists of an irregular but nearly level sandy 
 plain, broken by bunches of low mesas or slightly eroded volcanic 
 mountains. Stonewall Mountain, which lies about 30 miles east from 
 Lida, is an exception to this topograph}^, being a high, rugged grouj), 
 reaching probably 9,000 feet in altitude, or 4,000 feet above the desert 
 at its base. The northern side of this mountain is a steep cliff: escarp- 
 ment, probably 1,000 or 1,200 feet high, and is perhaps a simple fault- 
 scarp. (See PI. VII, A.) 

' IGNEOUS ROCKS. 

RHYOLITES. 

Stonewall Mountain is entirely made up of rhyolite, and has been 
 so deeply eroded that it can not be of very recent age. This rock is 
 probably the same as the rugged rhyolite core of the Kawich Range. 
 Northeast of Stonewall the low mountains in which Cactus Corral is 
 situated are composed of rhyolite and tordrillite, also considerably 
 eroded and probably belonging to the same period. 

Most of the hills in the desert, however, show comparatively^ slight 
 erosion. They represent thin flows, which have been very fluid and 
 so have run comparatively long distances from the vent, at a very 
 slight angle of descent. So the edges ai-e thin-benched mesas, while 
 the thicker, inner i^arts are irregular hills. While these mesas are
