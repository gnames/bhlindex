evidently younger than the deeply eroded rugged rhyolite of Stone- 
 wall JMonntain, j'et they seem to be, in part at least, older than cer- 
 tain horizontally stratified rhyolitic claj^s which will presently be 
 described as occupying a large portion of the desert between the vol- 
 canic hills and underlying the Pleistocene sands. Within these strati- 
 fied clays, aud sometimes capping them, are also beds of rhyolite, very 
 tine grained and often giassj'. This is evidently the youngest of all 
 the rhyolites, and we may infer that the rhyolitic eruj)tions lasted a 
 long time, beginning with those of Stonewall Mountain and ending 
 with the slaggv flows last mentioned. 

The latest lava of the desert is a flow of slaggy olivine-basalt, hang 
 at the base of Jackson Mountain, which is just east of Lida. This is 
 not only vounger than the youngest rhyolite, but is apparently younger 
 than the erosion of this and the underlying sediments to form the 
 buttes, of which Jackson Mountain is one. 

SEDIMENTARY ROCKS. 
 TERTIARY. 

The main portion of Jackson Mountain consists of several hundred 
 feet of hardened, horizontal sands and clays, containing irregular 
 fragmentri of rhyolite. The base of the mountain is at an elevation 
 of 5,100 feet, so that the uppermost sediments are at least 0,000 feet. 

In the valley between Stonewall Springs and Cactus Corral there is 
 also found green, hardened, rhyolite ash containing harder fragments. 
 It is evenly and horizontally stratified and is overlain on the edges by 
 the Pleistocene gulch dumps, or wash, which sometimes extend to 
 the middle of the valle}^ The ash is eroded into hummocks. 

This thick series of volcanic sands and clays was probably depos- 
 ited in a body of standing water and represents a lake contemporary 
 with the later rhyolitic eruption. As seen from the sediment:; of Jack- 
 son Mountain, the lake must have been at least 1,000 feet deep or 
 the desert. 

PLEISTOCENE. 

Along the slopes of all the mountains, especially of Stonewall Moun- 
 tain, are great wash slopes and gulch dumps fringing the scarp. This 
 material, flowing down into the valle}^ overlies the Tertiary lake 
 deposits. In the bottoms of the valleys are broad, bare mud flats or 
 playas, evidently quite recent and contein]3oraueous with the gulch 
 dumps. They seem to be simply sinks, where at intervals Avater col- 
 lects and speedily evaporates. They do not represent the residuum 
 of evaporated Pleistocene lakes of which, moreover, there is no other 
 evidence. 

LONE MOUNTAIN. 

For the following slight description of Lone Mountain the writer is 
 indebted to Mr. Turner, since he himself saw the mountain only 
 from a distance. The mountain really forms the northern end of the â–
