184 GEOLOGY OF NEVADA SOUTH OF 40TH PARALLEL, [bull. 208. 

Montezuma Ridge of the Silver Peak Range, but on account of its 
 exceptional height and prominence has been given a separate name. 

IGNEOUS ROCKS. 

The main part of Lone Mountain consists of craggy, light-colored, 
 massive granitic rock. 

SEDIMENTARY ROCKS. 

South of the granitic area the central portion consists of Cambrian 
 limestone^ To the east of this Cambrian belt is a belt of Silui-ian 
 limestones, as determined bj' Mr. Turner. Along tlie west flanks of 
 the mountain the ujtturned beds of the Esmeralda formation (earlier 
 Tertiary) occur. 

SILVER PEAK RANGE. 

The Silver Peak Range is short and somewhat irregular' in form. 
 It lies immediately east of the northern end of the White Mountain 
 Range, and like this range has a general northwest-southeast trend. 
 On the north the range is separated by a Ioav pass from the Monte 
 Cristo Mountains, while on the south it runs into the northern end of 
 the Grapevine and Panamint ranges. From near the southern end 
 of the range a spur runs off to the north, forming the eastern boun- 
 dary of Clayton Valley, which lies between it and the main range. _ 

The Silver Peak Range was studied by Mr. H. W. Turner during || 
 the summer of 1899, and the mapping of the formations over most of 
 the range has been kindly furnished b}* Iiim to the writer. Most of 
 the following notes on the geology, designed to explain the map, are 
 also due to him. Mr. F. B. Weeks, of the Geological Survey, also 
 spent some time during the same season in the Silver Peak region, 
 chiefly for the purpose of collecting fossils, and the present writer 
 passed through it on his wa}^ from Columbus to Lida. 

The range is mostly made uj) of folded Paleozoic rocks, together 
 with intrusive granite and a large auionnt of volcanic material. 

SEDIMENTARY ROCKS. 
 CAMBRIAN. 

Fossils obtained by Mr. J. K. Clayton, as early as 1866, at Silvei 
 Peak, and fijst regarded as Silurian or Devonian, were shown by Mr. 
 Walcott" to be Middle Cambrian. The studies of Mr. Turner have 
 furnished many details concerning these Cambrian rocks, wliich 
 occupy considerable portions of the range. In some of the Cam- 
 brian limestones masses of the same corals occur as in the White 
 Mountains to the west, so that Mr. Walcott regarded the two occur- 
 rences as essentially forming part of a single reef. ^ 

The chief area of Cambrian is north of Silver Peak, where it is 
 capped by volcanic rooks in many places. The buttes in Clayton
