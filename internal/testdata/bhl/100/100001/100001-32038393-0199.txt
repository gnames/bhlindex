SPURR.] SILVER PEAK RANGE. 185 

Valley are also largely Cambviau. The section consists of comj)ara- 
 1 ively massive limestones and cxnartzites. 

Along the road leading from Silver Peak by way of Barrel Springs 
 to the sontherii end of the range at Lida, the rocks are chiefly Cam- 
 brian limestones. At Lida the writer collected fossils referred 
 bv ]Mr. Yfalcott to the Lower Cambrian. 

Mr. Turner found overlying the Cambrian limestones other lime- 
 stones containing occasional graptolites, which he therefore refers to 
 the Sikirian. An area of these Silurian rocks occurs nortli of Benderes 
 Pass, while a belt of the same rocks occurs encircling a granitic area 
 north of Palmetto. Silurian rocks are also found on the southwest- 
 ern edge of the branch mountain ridge above described, which ma}^ 
 be called the "Montezuma Ridge" from the mining camp which is 
 situated on it. 

EARLY TERTIARY. 

On the flanks of this range Mr. Turner has described sediments to 
 which he gives the name of the Esmeralda formation.^' These dej)osits 
 consist of sandstones, shales, volcanic tuffs, breccias, and conglom- 
 erates, and great thicknesses of lacustral marls. Coal beds and plant 
 remains occur; also fossil shells and fish bones. From this fossil evi- 
 dence the age of the beds is broadly determined as late Eocene or 
 early Miocene. The beds are nearly always folded, dipping from 10° 
 to 40°, but the entire thickness may be several thousand feet. 

PLIOCENE. 

A butte in Clayton Valley, northeast from Silver Peak, which is 
 capped In' olivine-basalt, is chieflj^ made up of horizontalh" stratified, 
 partially' consolidated, green volcanic ash and tuff, with i^ebbles of 
 dark hiva. The stratified beds are undoubtedly water- laid and are 
 probably unconformable with the folded Tertiary series just described, 
 which occurs in patches all over the valley to the north of here. In 
 general appearance the beds are like the Pliocene sediments which 
 have such a broad distribution north of here, such, for example, as 
 occur on the pass between the Candelaria Mountains and the Pilot 
 Mountains. They are also similar to the latter occurrence in being 
 capped by olivine-basalt and not being folded. 

Going south from Silver Peak to Barrel Springs, the slopes of the 
 mountains consist of rolled gravels whose pebbles are derived from 
 most of the rocks around, including the lavas. These extend back 
 eastward to the hills of the Montezuma Ridge, which are made up 
 parti}' of volcanic rock. In the canyon below Barrel Springs the 
 stratified gravels and sands, containing rhyolite pebbles, are found to 
 lie against the eroded edge of a deposit of white volcanic ash and 
 pumice apparently water-laid, and this ash lies against the eroded
