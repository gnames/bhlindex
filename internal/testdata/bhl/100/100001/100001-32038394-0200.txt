edge of the slightly dipiDing Cambrian limestone. These gravels and 
 sands seem to be the same as those in the butte described above. 

In the outlying hills of the southern part of the range just east of 
 Lida is a series of hardened, stratified, greenish clays and sands con- 
 taining fragments of rhyolite. These clays have sometimes been 
 eroded to form buttes, especially where capped by lava. They are 
 horizontally stratified and undisturbed, and are younger than the 
 flow of olivine-basalt which sometimes mantles around the base of 
 the buttes. 

The deposits in these different localities may be provisionall}^ cor- 
 related with the other sediments which have already been ascribed to 
 the Pliocene-Pleistocene Shoshone Lake. 

IGNEOUS ROCKS. 

In the Silver Peak region the igneous rocks are abundant and 
 varied. 

GRANITES. 

Granites occupy considerable areas, and field evidence shows that 
 they are intrusive into the Paleozoic sediments, but not into the 
 Tertiary rocks. 

VOLCANIC ROCKS. 

The volcanic history of the region is of considerable complexity and 
 interest. Mr. Turner, who has made a study of this, has kindly 
 supplied the writer with the information that the succession of lavas 
 in this district has been, in general, (1) rhj^olites, (2) andesites, and (3) 
 basalts. 

ORE DEPOSITS. 

At Silver Peak there are rich silver and gold mines. The Cam- 
 brian limestones are cut by pegmatitic granitic rock, which changes 
 to pegmatite and quartz veins. The ores appear to be, partly at 
 least, connected with these intrusions. 

Numerous other localities are known where mineralization has 
 occurred. At Barrel Springs the limestone is decomposed and stained 
 along a vertical zone 10 yards wide with iron and copper. The honey- 
 combed and cavernous appearance of the rocks shows that they have 
 been the channel for ascending springs, to which the mineralization 
 is undoubtedly due. 

At Lida the writer noticed an auriferous quartz vein 5 or 6 feet 
 wide, occurring along the entire contact of a 20-foot-wide nearly 
 vertical dike of quartz-monzonite-porphyry which cuts the nearlj^ 
 horizontal Lower Cambrian limestones. This dike is evidently a 
 phase of the general granitic intrusion and the quartz vein is an 
 accompaniment.
