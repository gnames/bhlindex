GREAT BASIIvT RAISTGES OF CAIjIFOR^^IA, ?^0RTH OF 
 MOHAVE DESERT. 

GRAPEVINE AND FUNERAL RANGES. 

The Grapevine and Funeral ranges are practically parts of a single 
 mountain chain, which is the easternmost of the Important chains 
 belonging to the Sierra Nevada auxiliary belt. This chain faces the 
 Amargosa and the Ralston deserts on the east, and has a northwest- 
 southeast trend. The Grapevine Range is continued on the north 
 by the Silver Peak Range, from which it is separated only by a com- 
 paratively narrow transverse valley. 

That portion of the range which lies immediately north of Furnace 
 Creek has been sometimes called the Amargosa Range ; but in the 
 present description all of the mountains from Furnace Creek north- 
 ward will be included under the single term Grapevine Range, 
 while those south of Furnace Creek will be described as the Funeral 
 Mountains. To this southern portion of the range the name Amargosa 
 has also been applied, and to certain parts of it the name Black 
 Mountains; but these will here be omitted. 

The Funeral Mountains have a trend somewhat different from that 
 of the Grapevine Range, being more nearly north and south. This 
 change is accompanied by a similar change in the trend of the Pana- 
 mint Range, which lies next west. 

The Grapevine Range is not of great width, but is high and narrow, 
 with wild scenery (PI. VII, B). The Funeral Mountains are lower, and 
 have a striking air of desolation, due to the lack of vegetation and 
 the dai-k, gloomy colors of the rocks. Both the Grapevine and Fune- 
 ral ranges are cut by deep canyons which sometimes extend quite 
 through the range, a phenomenon frequent in the Great Basin ranges. 

At Furnace Creek the Grapevine Range fronts the Funeral Range 
 with a south-facing scarp, so steep as to be almost inaccessible and 
 about 4,000 or 5,000 feet in height. At the base of this scarp the 
 drainage from it has cut a channel parallel with its^ front, which 
 forms that branch of Furnace Creek along which the road runs across 
 the mountains. 

Both the Grapevine and the Funeral mountains present steep sides 
 to Death Valley, which are bolder than the western side of the valley,
