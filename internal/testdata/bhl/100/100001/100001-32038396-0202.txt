SEDIMENTARY ROCKS. 

Mr. George G. Davis has kindly sent the writer samples of the chief 
 rocks at Gold Mountain, which ajtpear to be a grayish, rather coarse- 
 grained quart2ate and a dark bliie-gi*ay slatj^ limestone of ancient 
 appearance. These rocks may perhaps be Cambrian or Silurian. 

At Boundary Canj^on Mr. Gilbert found limestones with imperfect 
 fossils, which, Avitli the stratigraphic data, serve to connect the rocks 
 with the Cambrian beds observed farther east." 

At the extreme southern end of the range, at Saratoga Springs, Mr. 
 Gilbert* has noted the following section (from toj) to bottom) :

According to Mr. M. R. Campbell,'' the rocks composing the southern 
 end of the Funeral Range at Saratoga Springs are limestone, shale, 
 and quartzite, presumably of pre-Cambrian age and containing no 
 fossils. They strike north and south, and dip about 50° E. No Ter- 
 tiary rocks were seen in the southern end of the range from Saratoga 
 Springs, while strata resembling those exposed at Saratoga Siorings 
 could be traced nortliAvard for several miles into the high summits. 

SILURIAN. 

At Furnace Creek Valley the writer obsei'ved bowlders of pure white, 
 vitreous quartzite extending down from P^a^amid Peak, although the 
 main mass of the mountain is limestone. This quartzite resembles 
 the Silurian Eureka quartzite, so persistent in Nevada, and the rela- 
 tion of these beds to those overljing, which are probabty Devonian 
 and Carboniferous, makes it probable that in Pja^amid Peak and 
 west of it the strata are largely Silurian. The writer has been 
 informed by Mr. F. B. Weeks, of the United States Geological Survey, 
 that at Grapevine Peak limestones cariying Lower Silurian fossils 
 (probabl.y corresponding to the Pogonip formation of Eureka) occur, 
 and he regards these Silurian rocks as probablj^ continuous southward 
 to Pyramid Peak. 

DEVONIAN. 

In the mountains east of Pyramid PeaK: a great series of easterly 
 dipping limestones are exjDosed, in Avhich badly preserved fossils
