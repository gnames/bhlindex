resembling those foiiiul in tlie rocks of the ranges just east of liere 
 were observed. In the Kingston Range Devonian fossils were col- 
 lected from similar rocks, and from the great thickness of the section 
 exposed in the Grapevine Range at this point it is likely that both 
 the Devonian and the Carboniferous may be represented here. 

TERTIARY. 

In the eastern part of the range, where the road crosses from the 
 Amargosa Valley into Furnace Creek, there is found a great amount 
 of conglomerate, forming high hills. These conglomerates are very 
 coarse and contain rounded pebbles and bowlders of all sizes, made 
 up of reddish and white quartzite and black and gray limestones 
 bearing the badly preserved Paleozoic fossils above mentioned. The 
 conglomerate is as hard and firm as the rocks from which it is derived. 
 It is water-laid and well stratified, and evidently a shore formation. 
 The whole thickness exx^osed is estimated at 4:,00() feet. It is sharply 
 folded, together with the limestones from which it is derived, but it 
 abuts abruptly against these limestones on the west. 

The irregularity of the contact between conglomerate and limesione 
 denotes a great erosion interval, yet no unconformity of attitude is 
 apparent. 

This conglomerate seems to fringe tlie north edge of the bold 
 Paleozoic scarp of the Grapevine Mountains across the greater por- 
 tion of the range. It is found at A^arious points. A little west of 
 Pj'ramid Peak conglomerate occurs, interbedded with and running 
 laterally into a hard limestone, which has all the appearance of 
 being calcareous tufa. A specimen examined microscopically bears 
 out this idea and shows that the rock is probabl}^ a chemical i)recipi- 
 tate. It is like a rock found in crossing the Panamint Range from 
 Death Valley to Windy Gaj:), and also like one from the Esmeralda 
 formation, between the Candelaria Mountains and the Pilot Range. 

Besides these rocks there occur, as parts of the same series, semi- 
 consolidated gi-avels, with clays j)artially hardened to slaty shales, 
 limy clays partially consolidated to argillaceous secondary limestones, 
 and sands partially hardened to cherty and limy sandstones, all 
 interbedded. All these, including the conglomerate and the limestone 
 tufa, have a general light-j^ellow, often greenish color, characteristic 
 of the series. 

This sedimentary series makes up the greater i:)ortion of the Funeral 
 Range. Along Furnace Creek Valley and on both sides of it the 
 mountains consist chiefly of y^ellow-green strata capped by basalt. 
 The lava seems to occur interbedded with the sedimentaries, as well 
 as overlying them. The series is here consolidated into a hard clay 
 rock, with occasional thin sandstone, and the general yellow-gi-een 
 color is changed in places to reddish, j^ellowish, and i^inkish. The 
 rocks are often gyj)siferous and contain abundant grass remains,
