which are, however, indeterminable. From the yellow-green Tertiary 
 series in the hills just east of the mouth of Furnace Creek there 
 has been taken much borax, which occurs as borate of lime in beds in 
 the strata. Superintendent Roach, of the borax works at Daggett, 
 says that from one hill here — Mount Blanco — 200 tons of borax a day 
 could be easily shii)ped. 

On the eastern side of -Death Valley, southward from Furnace 
 Creek, the upturned yellow-green Tertiaries, with some few inter- 
 calated sheets of lava, constitute the mountains. Beneath some of 
 these sheets the clays are baked to a red, natural brick. The lavas 
 seem to occur chiefly at the top of the j^ellow-green series, or at a still 
 higher horizon, for the great mass of beds exposed in the lower por- 
 tion of Furnace Creek contains no lava sheets; yet in these beds occur 
 occasionally lava bowlders and pebbles, so that we conclude that the 
 period was one of continual volcanic activity. From fragments of 
 lava picked up at the base of the mountains and from observations at 
 a distance tho lower lavas seem to be not so basic as the upper ones, 
 which are chiefly olivine-basalt. A single specimen of biotite-andesite 
 was all that was collected to represent these more siliceous volcanics. 

Near the summit of the pass, just east of Furnace Creek, there 
 come in above the yellow-green Tertiary se)-ies softer, dark-brown, 
 honeycombed conglomerates, recalling the similar rocks of Meadow 
 Valley Canyon. Thin sheets of basalt are interbedded with the con- 
 glomerates, but the great sheets lie on top. Patches of this same 
 upper conglomerate series were elsewhere observed, and at one place 
 its contact with the underlying yellow-green series appeared slightly 
 discordant. The conglomerate contains pebbles and bowlders which i 
 are chiefly of lava and must have been derived from the sheets of 
 basalt which were periodically poured out during the deposition of [ 
 the beds. 

A rough estimate of the thickness of this whole series of slightly 
 consolidated beds and volcanics puts it at not less than 4,000 feet, , 
 and the nature. of the sediments shows that they must have been i 
 deposited in standing water. The presence in some of the beds of 
 gypsum, borax, and calcareous tufa shows that at some jDcriods the 
 waters in which the sediments were deposited were evaporated. 
 They were, therefore, those of an inclosed lake, which was probably 
 of great dimensions. It is likely that a large portion of the beds wei-e 
 deposited in fresh water at a period different from that in which the 
 chemical precipitates were laid down. 

The borax in these beds is probabl}^ contemporaneous with the 
 borax deposits in similar folded Tertiaries at Daggett and elsewhere 
 in the Mojave Desert. Between these two localities, moreover, the 
 strata, so far as known, appear to be roughly continuous. The strata 
 of Mojave Desert are exposed on a grand scale at Cajon Pass, where 
 they contain beds of black lignite.
