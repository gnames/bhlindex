SPURR.] GRAPEVINE AND FUNERAL RANGES. 191 

Northward from Furnace Creek, at. Silver Peak, are found beds of 
 the Esmerakla formation, which are eutirel}^ similar in nearly every 
 respect to those at Furnace Creek. Moreover, the fossils found in 
 the Esmeralda beds indicate a nearly similar age to that indicated 
 by fossils found in the Tertiary strata of the Mojave Desert, just west 
 of Cajon Pass. 

The upper part of the Furnace Creek beds is identical in appear- 
 ance with certain semi-indurated and slightly folded conglomerates 
 and sandstones found in Meadow Valley Canyon, which have been 
 referred to the Pliocene.'* 

PLEISTOCENE. 

At the lower end of Furnace Creek the steeplj^ dipping Upper 
 Tertiary gravels are overlain directly and unconformably by hori- 
 zontal gravels, which are partly consolidated and form bluffs 15 feet 
 high. 

These are the same gravels as were noted on the eastern flanks of 
 the Panamint Range, on the road crossing to Windy Gap, the beds 
 here having the same appearance and position. Their jjerfect hori- 
 zontality indicates that they are perhaps the deposits of a post- 
 Tertiary lake. This lake was a few hundred feet deep, as measured 
 by tlie highest of these sediments. 

It therefore api^ears j)robable that the Furnace Creek beds repre- 
 sent nearly the whole of the Tertiary period, from the Eocene through 
 the Pliocene. It is jDossible also that the uppermost lavas belong in the 
 Pleistocene, for they are fresh olivine-basalt, like that which is known 
 to have been extruded throughout the Great Basin region during the 
 Pleistocene.* 

A considerable portion of the area of greatest depression is occux)ied 
 by a great brown desert. This has the api)earance of a newly jilowed 
 field in color and form, and appears soft. On examination the surface 
 is found to consist entirely of hard salt, rendered brown by a mixture 
 of soil. This deposit is probably the result of the evai)oration of 
 the Pleistocene lake. 

This lake was fed by the Amargosa River. The writer has been 
 informed by those who are familiar with this region that occasionally^ 
 the Amargosa River has been seen to be 200 feet wide at the southern 
 end of Death Valley, although generally it is dry on the surface as 
 far uj) as Ash Meadows. Along this dry course it flows underground, 
 as is shown by the fact that water may. generally be found by digging 
 a few feet below the surface. In Death Valley, also, water can be 
 found in many places by digging, so the dregs of the lake may be said 
 to still exist.
