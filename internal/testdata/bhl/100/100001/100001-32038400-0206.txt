IC4NEOUS ROCKS. 
 GRANULAR ROCKS. 

Granitic rocks are said to occur at Gold Mountain, at the northern 
 end of the range, where the gold ores are connected with theni.'^ 

OLIVINE-BASALT AT FURNACE CREEK. 

The Funeral Mountains are capjjed by hea^'y flows of pyroxene- 
 olivine-basalt, which seems to have been slightly involved in the latter 
 part of the folding wliich affected the underlying Tertiaries. The 
 rock is black and slaggy and is identical in appearance and composi- 
 tion with the Pleistocene olivine-basalts found frequently in Nevada.* 

Besides capping the Tertiar}^ sediments, the basalt occurs in sheets 
 which are, in part at least, certainly contemporaneous with the upper 
 portion of the sediments, especially the conglomerate series. One 
 basalt sheet was noted as metaniori^hosing the underlying conglomer- 
 ates, but not the upper ones, and is therefore probably a flow and 
 not an intruded sill. Moreover, the i)ebbles and bowlders in the 
 ui3j)er conglomerate series are largely of the same basalt. 

ANDESITE AT FUkxj^cE CREEK. 

Beneath the basalt sheets there is a certain amount of less basic 
 volcanic material in the beds. This was not carefully investigated, 
 but a single specimen showed that biotite-andesite is represented. 

VOLCANICS NORTH OF FURNACE CREEK. 

North of Furnace Creek the Avholc northeastern side of the Grape-^ 
 vine Range is overlapped by the sea of lava v\diich occurs over mostoi 
 the Ralston and Amargosa deserts, except where obscured by Terti- 
 arj^ or Pleistocene detrital accumulations. At the north end of the 
 range these volcanics may connect with the volcanic area just north 
 of Gold Mountain, which there extends to the western side of th( 
 range and is probably connected with the lavas at the northern end 
 of the Panamint Range. 

Mr. Gilbert'" notes that rhyolite occurs a few miles north of 
 Boundary Canyon, flanking the range both on its eastern and its west-i 
 ern side. 

STRUCTURE. 

Mr. Gilbert '^ has drawn a section of the Graj^evine Range at Bound- 
 ary Canyon. This section shows essentially a main anticlinal fold, 
 slightly overthroAvn to the west, Avith an auxiliar}^ broad anticline
