 between the two. These folds are much broken np l)y faults, which, 
 as Mr. Gilbert notes, are not only longitudinal, but transverse." 

In crossing- the mountains at the junction of the Grajievine and 
 Funeral ranges, on the road leading to Furnace Creek, a good struc- 
 ture section was obtained. The south-facing scarp of the Grapevine 
 Mountains shows a central chief anticline, with a very great thick- 
 ness of uniformly easterly-dipping beds on the east limb. AVest from 
 this central anticline, whose axis is immediately west of Pyramid 
 Peak, there is a second anticline, also with steep dips, in the moun- 
 tains immediately above Death Valley, and between the two anti- 
 clines is a slight syncline. On the south side of the pass, in the lower 
 Funeral Mountains, it seemed to the writer that there is about the 
 same structure, although the dips ajjpear to be decidedly less. No 
 faults were noted in this section, though the}' very likel}^ exist. 

The folds at Furnace Creek are probably continuous with those 
 shown in Mr. Gilbert's section. As the writer looked along the face 
 of the Grapevine Mountains, noi'thward from Furnace Creek, he 
 thought to be able to trace the western anticline at least as far as 
 Boundary Canyon. 

The Tertiary beds of the Funeral Mountains have therefore been 
 folded together with the Paleozoics of the Grapevine Range. Yet the 
 Paleozoic limestones appear to have in general steeper dips than 
 the Tertiary strata. Nevertheless, the chief folding has come about 
 since the deposition of the Tertiary. Not only the lower Tertiary 
 beds, but also the upper conglomerates are folded, and even to a cer- 
 tain extent the interbedded and overlying olivine-basalt, which is of 
 fresh appearance and may be in part as young as Pleistocene. Cer- 
 tainly, therefore, the upheaval of the Funeral Mountains and the 
 present Grapevine Range has been very recent indeed. 

This is illustrated in the Funeral Range, which, as viewed by the 
 writer, seemed to consist near its northern end of two anticlinal ridges 
 with a synclinal valley between. This synclinal vallej^ is occupied by 
 Furnace Creek, which follows the folding in all its bendings. The 
 northwesterly course of the lower portion of Furnace Creek is caused 
 by a corresponding bend in the synclinal trough. This deflection of 
 the Furnace Creek syncline appears not to be continuous into the 
 Paleozoic strata just north of here, and. it is very likely due to the 
 differential folding of the Tertiary strata against the hard Paleozoic 
 buttress. In the summit of the pass above Furnace Creek, this fold- 
 ing against the Paleozoic cliff is well shown b}" a sharp local anticline 
 in the Tertiary beds, the north limb of which dips from 20 degrees to 
 45 degrees toward the Paleozoic wall, which does not take part in the 

cMr. F. B. Weeks, of the U. S. Geological Survey, found in 1900 that at Grapevine Peak 
 the main range was decidedly synclinal in structure, the axis of the fold in general transverse 
 to the trend of the range.
