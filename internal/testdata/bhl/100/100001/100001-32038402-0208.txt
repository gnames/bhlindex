RESUME. 

The succession of events in the Grapevine and Funeral ranges and 
 in the region of Death Valley is, then, about as follows: 

1. Deposition of a thick, conformable. Paleozoic series. 

2. Elevation to a land mass, without marked folding. 

3. The formation of sharp, lofty mountains, with deep valleys. 

4. The deposition of the thick Tertiary series. This took place, in 
 part at least, in a great lake or inland sea. In this lake were deposited 
 near the shores conglomerates and breccias derived from the Paleozoic 
 rocks; in the other portions were formed silts mixed occasionally with 
 gravels. During the deposition of this series, especially the later 
 portion, there was volcanic activity, and sheets of lava were poured 
 into the lake, thus becoming intercalated with the sedimentary beds. 

5. The lake, probably generally fresh, was at certain times reduced 
 and evaporated, so that beds containing salt, borax, silica, and lime 
 were chemically precipitated and mingled with the detrital silts. 

6. The volcanics changed to olivine-basalt. These lavas are asso- 
 ciated with well-stratified sediments, such as might have been formed 
 in a lake, but accurate data bearing on this point are lacking. The 
 sediments may possibly be the result of stream action. They consist 
 of brown and red conglomerates, which overlie the yellow-green lake 
 beds, and are separated from them by some slight movement and per- 
 haps an erosion gap. 

7. Final flows of olivine-basalt. 

8. Probably beginning before the deposition of the Tertiary, but 
 not becoming very important until during and after the close of this 
 period, came a disturbance, leading to rapid folding. The crvist was 
 bent, and j)erhaps broken, forming hills and valleys. Death Valley 
 was created. 

9. The mountains were eroded, producing minor irregular forms. 
 The climate being slightly moister than now, a shallow lake a few 
 hundred feet deep was formed in the bottom of Death Valle3^ This 
 soon became charged with salt, borax, etc., derived chiefly from 
 the leaching of the earlier lake beds, now become mountains. At 
 this period the late Pleistocene shore gravels were formed. 

10. The climate becoming drier, the lake evaporated, leaving a salt 
 desert. Since that time there has been only a slight incision of the 
 lake shore conglomerate by the drainage from the mountains to the 
 dry valley. 

AMARGOSA VALLEY. 

The Amargosa Valley lies between the Kingston and Funeral 
 ranges. The following notes are from Mr. R. B. Howe's notebooks, 
 except where credited to Mr. Campbell.
