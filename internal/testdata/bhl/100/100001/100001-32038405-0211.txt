spuRR.l AMARGOSA VALLEY AND KINGSTON EANGE. 195 

METAMORPHIC ROCKS. 

Metamorphic rocks are exposed about a mile below the China ranch. 

SEDIMENTARY ROCKS 
 TERTIARY. 

Overlying the metamorphic rocks at the point mentioned above are 
 Tertiary deposits. These Tertiary lakes were dry part of the time, or 
 receded to a great extent and then swelled out again, for talus and 
 lake deposits alternate with each other in the lower Amargosa. At 
 China ranch the Amargosa River cuts through the Tertiary beds to 
 a depth of 200 or 300 feet. 

Mr. M. R,. Campbell ^'' has indicated on a maj) two areas of Tertiary 
 lake beds near Amargosa Valley, one around Resting Springs and the 
 other south of Ash Meadow. 

STRUCTURE. 

At China ranch the Tertiaries have been uplifted so that they dip 
 at a high angle. The structure seems to be monoclinal. There is also 
 some faulting in the Tertiary beds. Above China ranch the late talus 
 deposits overlying the Tertiary are tilted uj) to a high angle, together 
 with the Tertiary rocks. 

For a distance of 3 miles, near China ranch, the Amargosa River 
 has recently cut down about 20 feet into an old river deposit or wash. 
 For a distance of about 1 mile it is beginning to cut down 4 or 5 feet 
 farther. This is shown by waterfalls in the talus. This local down- 
 cutting seems to indicate recent movement. 

Mr. M. R. Campbell* states that the Tertiary beds in this valley 
 bear evidence of considerable crustal movement since their deposi- 
 tion. The eastern margin that rests against the foot of the Kingston 
 Range is 800 feet higher than the uppermost beds of the same series 
 at the foot of Funeral Mountain. This indicates a depression toward 
 the west, in the direction of Death Valley. It seems possible that 
 the change was due to tlu^ sinking of Death Valley to its present 
 position below sea level. 

KINGSTON RANGE. 

The Kingston Range lies between Pahrump Valley and the valley 
 of Amargosa River. The Califoi-nia-Nevada line passes along its 
 eastern base. Tlie range luis a northwest-southeast trend and is 50 
 or 60 miles in length. At its northern end it is separated by a short 
 valley, called Stuart Valley, from the mountains which lie directly 
 north of Pahrump Valley, and which form an irregular group afford- 
 ing a partial connection between tlie Spring Mountain Rajige and the 
 Kingston Range. This group will be described together with the 
 Kingston Range.
