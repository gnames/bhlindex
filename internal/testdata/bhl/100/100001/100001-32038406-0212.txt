The Kingston Range generally has steep fronts, especially along 
 the main eastern side, where it faces Palirnmp Valley.

 CAMBRIAN. 

Mr. R. B. Rowe, in 1900-1901, discovered and described Cambrian 
 in the Kingston Range. The following information has been taken 
 from his notebooks : 

The greater part of the Kingston Range is made up of Cambrian 
 strata. On the road from the j)ost-office at Sand}^ to Kingston Peak 
 there are sandstones and limestones, with metamorphosed gray schists 
 cut by dikes. 

Kingston Mountain consists of a central core of granite, which is 
 topped on tlie north and northeast by a fine-grained white quartzite 
 with reddish bands. The succession at Kingston Peak, near Horse 
 Spring, from the bottom up, is as follows: 

Section at Kingston Peak. 

1. White, gray, or red qiiartzites. 

2. Red, gray, and blue slates, and heavy beds i)f quartzite. 

3. Dark blue, much altered limestone. 

4. Light gray, arenaceous limestone, much altered, with crystallized calcite 

in its crevices and interspaces. 

5. White and brownish quartzite, with conglomerate at the bottom. This 

sometimes alternates with the red, gray, and bine slates. 

In. some ijlaces the wliite quartzite at the base seems to run into a 
 gray gneiss. 

On the road between Manse and Resting Springs, througli the pass 
 going to Tecopa, there is an excellent section of the mountains east of 
 Resting Springs. The Cambrian seems to be repeated at this point, 
 probably by a fault. At Resting Si)rings the thickness of the Cam- 
 brian, j)artly estimated and parti}' actually measured, is about 1,500 
 feet, and can not be more than 2,000 feet. About 4 or 5 miles north 
 of Resting Si^rings the Cambrian is capped by lava. 

On the spur of the Kingston Range ending at Resting Springs, at a 
 locality about 2 miles north of the springs, the following section, from 
 the bottom up, was observed : 

Section Â£ miles north of Resting Springs. 

Feet. 

Heavy sandstone, probably all conglomeratic. Observed pebbles were all 
 well-rounded quartzite 2, 000 

Generally gray shales, with bands of sandstone 1 , 000 

Dark-blue limestone with shales and siliceous limestones, containing trilo- 
 bites and other Cambrian fossils 100 

Quartzitic sandstones and shales 700 

About 7 miles east of Resting Springs the rocks in the range, which 
 is jjart of the Kingston Range, are in j)art Lower Cambrian, and are a
