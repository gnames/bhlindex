repetition of those exposed at Resting Springs. There is shown in 
 these mountains about 4,000 feet of Lower Cambrian or earlier rocks. 
 Tliey consist chiefly of reddish and gray sandstone, some calcareous 
 sandstones, and red and blue shales. Fossils were found within about 
 1,500 feet of the top, and none below that. Although a diligent search 
 was made, they were found only in one ledge, and seemed to be poorly 
 represented even there. About 800 feet below the top of the shale 
 and sandstone formation, fossils are very abundant in some very 
 thin sandstones. Thej^ consist mainly of trilobites, Hyolifhes, and a 
 brachiopod. 

In the pass east of Resting Springs, about 800 feet beneath the 
 dark blue limestones, Cambrian fossils were collected. The section 
 consists, from. the bottom up, as follows:

About 2,500 feet from the bottom Cambrian fossils are fonnd, and they

4. Shaly brown sandstone, with beds of limestone. Contains small trilobites 

and lingtiloid shells. Probably Cambrian and possibly Lower Cambrian _ 20 

About 8 miles east of Resting Springs is found No. 5 of the sec- 
 tion, consisting of light-gra}^ and dark-l)lue limestone, moi-e or less 
 massive; thickness, about 2,000 feet. There is an apparent uncon- 
 formity between this limestone and tlie underlying formations. 
 Certain parts of the limestone are penetrated by whal may be worm 
 l)orings, now filled with calcite. 

About 3y miles east of Twelvemile Springs is l)lue and gray lime- 
 stone. From loose blocks found li-ilobites were collected, which did 
 not appear to Mr. RoAve to be Lower Cambrian, but to be sonuMvhere 
 l)etween the Trenton and the Lower Cambrian.
