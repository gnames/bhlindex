but a small lot of fossils was obtained, which are regarded by Dr. 
 Girt}' as Devonian. The species ai^e as follows: 

Zaphrentis sp. Spirifer maia. 

Orthis sp. Spirifer maia (small variety)?. 

Chonetes deflectusr. Spirifer argentarius. 

About 10 miles northwest of the fossil locality above mentioned 
 occurs a Tertiary conglomerate, containing pebbles of this limestone 
 and quartzite, and from these pebbles another collection of fossils 
 was made, which are determined by Dr. Girty to be Devonian : 

Zaphrentis sp. Spirifer indeterminable. 

Crinoid stems. Athyris? sp. 

Bryozoan fragments. Atrypa missourensis. 

Spirifer pinyonensis. Phaethonides sp. 

MESOZOIC. 

At the summit of the pass between Manse and Tecopa Mr. Rowe 
 noted that the Paleozoic limestone is overlain by light-gray and 
 chocolate sandstones, reddish and red sandstones, and dark-brown 
 sandstones. Some of these are conglomeratic. Lithologically, this 
 formation is like the Mesozoic of the Spring Mountain Range. These 
 rocks seem to be unconformable with the underlying dark-blue Paleo- 
 zoic limestone, the dip of the Paleozoic rocks being about 10 or 11 
 degrees greater. The supposedly Mesozoic rocks are about 1,000 fee) 
 thick, and are overlain to the south by a lava bed. 

TERTIARY. 

On the border of the Amargosa Desert, in the foothills of the north 
 end of the Kingston Range, is found a coarse breccia or conglomerate, 
 containing pebbles of brown or blue fetid limestone and quartzite 
 similar to that found in place in the Devonian series. These pebbles 
 are angular, subangular, or rounded, and are of all sizes up to 2 feet 
 in diameter. They are cemented by a coarse, red matrix, probably 
 chieflj^ derived from the limestone. The stratification is hardly trace- 
 able, 3^et the deposit is probably water-laid. The general dip seems 
 to be a few degrees northeast. About two miles west of here there 
 occurs a thick deposit of medium coarse granitic arkose, which becomes 
 finer grained and changes to greenish sand. Farther west this sand 
 is seen to overlie a series of soft gray-green shales, sandstones, and 
 granitic arkoses, moderately well hardened. The strike of this series 
 is north and south and the dip 15Â° E. The finer strata show oscilla- 
 tion ripple marks, such as are formed in standing water, a few inches 
 apart. Somewhat farther west, in the same series, was found a pure 
 white, compact rock, which microscopic investigation shows to be a 
 consolidated volcanic ash. It consists of many fragments of glass in 
 a white opaque dust matrix. The ash underlies greenish, considerably 
 indurated, sandstones, often oxidized to a red color. 

This detrital series resembles the series of shales, tuffs, and sand- 
 stones exposed near Columbus and Silver Peak, which have been
