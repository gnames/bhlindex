SPDRR] KINGSTON RANGE. 199 

described by Mr. Turner under tlie name of the Esmeralda formation, 
 and which carry earl}^ Tertiary fossils. The series is also probably 
 the same as that which makes up part of the Funeral Range, and 
 extends over so wide a region south of here. Like all these beds, it is 
 probably early Tertiarj^ 

Mr. R. B. Rowe noted that about Resting Springs there are Tertiary 
 deposits 3^ounger than the lavas of the same region. 

IGNEOUS ROCKS. 

The Tertiary arkoses described above seem to indicate the existence 
 of granite somewhere in the vicinity. As viewed from Pahrump Val- 
 ley, the southern portion of the Kingston Range in the neighborhood 
 of Kingston Peak has a rugged, massive aspect which may denote the 
 presence of granite. Granite occurs not far southeast of here in the 
 Clarks Peak Mountains, where it cuts the Paleozoic limestones. 

At the extreme northern end of those low outlying mountains which 
 lie to the north of the Pahrump Valley there appears to be, as seen 
 fi'om Pahrump Valley, a portion where the topography is low, smooth, 
 and rounded, contrasting with the rugged, banded, stratified rocks 
 farther south. This more monotonous region is probably volcanic. 

Mr. Rowe noted the following concerning the igneous rocks subse- 
 quent to writing the above : 

North of Resting Springs the Cambrian rocks are covered by lavas, 
 which are separated from the underlying rocks by an erosion interval, 
 but are folded to about the same extent. These lavas dip at a high 
 angle and are carved by erosion, like the sedimentary rocks. Thej- 
 do not appear to be as recent lavas as those in the Tertiary deposits. 
 They occupy ancient erosion valleys in the Cambrian. 

Between Resting Springs and Tecopa basalt is present in large 
 quantities. 

Gneisses in the pass between Sandy and Kingston Peak are cut 
 by many dikes. Kingston Peak itself has a central core of probably 
 pre-Cambrian or basal granite. The overlying quartzite is cut by 
 dark-colored igneous rocks. 

STRUCTURE. 

According to Mr. R. B. Rowe, the general structure of the Kings- 
 ton Range seems to be monoclinal, the dip being to the east. At 
 Kingston Peak the Cambrian strata which overlie the central core of 
 granite dip to the north and are folded. 

A sketched cross section of the range north of the road between 
 Sandy and Kingston Peak seems to indicate a slight synclinal struc- 
 ture at this point. There is also a great deal of faulting here. 

At Kingston Peak there is considerable faulting at right angles to 
 the strike of the rocks, and some parallel to the strike. The pass 
 east of Resting Springs seems to be along a transverse fault.
