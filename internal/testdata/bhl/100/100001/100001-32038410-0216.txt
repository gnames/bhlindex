About 8 miles east of Resting- Springs, and about 2 miles northeast 
 of the pass, is a normal fault running 20 degi-ees west of north. This 
 fault is also shown in the Resting Springs Valley. It brings up the 
 Lower Cambrian shales and sandstones against the overljdng 
 limestone. The writer^' has estimated the throw of the fault, from 
 Mr. Rowe's description, to be about 8,000 feet. 

There is an apparent unconformity at this place between the lower 
 Cambrian and the overlying limestone. The limestone strikes N. 28° 
 W,, and dips 43° NE. 

About G miles north of Resting Springs the lavas which lie upon 
 the Cambrian are folded to the same extent as the Cambrian, botli 
 dipi^ing northeast 52°. The Cambrian rocks must have been nearly 
 level at the time of the eruption of the lava, although eroded to a con- 
 siderable extent. The lava flowed over the eroded region, and was 
 deposited in the vallej^s, against the edges of the strata. Then at a 
 later period l)otli were raised. 

A section of a spur of the Kingston Mountains east of Resting 
 Springs shows a monoclinal structure, the dips being uniformlj^ east. 
 The fault above mentioned runs nearly parallel to the range. 

OPAL OR CLARKS PEAK MOUNTAINS. 

This is a small group of mountains situated on the State line 
 between Nevada and California, just soutli of the southern end of the 
 Spring Mountain Range. Its chief eminence is Clarks Peak. The 
 mountains are probably to be considered as an extension of the Kings- 
 ton Range. 

Mr. Gilbert'^ notes that in these mountains near Ivanpah the rocks 
 are chiefly limestone, of which the age was not determined. Judging 
 from the fact that the Avhole southern part of the Spring Mountain 
 Range is Carboniferous and that the Kingston Range is apparently 
 also largely composed ,.7f Cai'bon if erous and Devonian, it is likely that 
 the limestone of the 'Marks Peak Mountains belongs to much the 
 same period. 

Mr. Gilbert further .otes that the C(>ntral portion of these moun- 
 tains is occupied hy a belt of granite, cutting obliquely across the 
 range, with limestone on both sides. 

ORE DEPOSITS. 

Rich silver oi-es occur in these mountains, both in the limestone 
 and granite. Farther south large deposits of coi^per are reported.^ 

PANAMINT RANGE. 

The Panamint Range is one of the most important of the ranges 
 auxiliary to the Sierra Nevada, whicli lie in the belt east of it and run
