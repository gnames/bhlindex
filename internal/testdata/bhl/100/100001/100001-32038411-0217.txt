SPURR.] PANAMINT RANGE. 201 

northwest and sontheast parallel to its front. The range is abont 130 
 miles in length. At its northern end it merges into lava flows which 
 unite it with the northern end of the Grapevine Range, while at its 
 southern end it passes into low hills of Tertiaiy strata and associated 
 lavas capped by later basic volcanics. It forms the southwestern 
 barrier of Death Valley, which it fronts with a steep slope. 

This range has been verj" little explored and not much is known 
 concerning its geology. The detail of its mapping, therefore, and 
 especially the differentiation of the Paleozoic which is known to exist 
 in its central i^ortion into the Cambrian and Silurian (as has been 
 done on the accompanying map, PI. I), is very hypothetical. 

SEDIMENTARY ROCKS. 

CAMBRIAN. 

On the east front of the range, above the road from Furnace Creek 
 in Death Valley to the crossing of the range at Windy Gap or Win- 
 gate, a large portion of the range consists of older stratified rocks, 
 which seem, as viewed from a distance, to lie beneath upturned Ter- 
 tiary sediments and associated volcanics, and are cut through by 
 masses of intrusive granite. No close examination of these older 
 rocks was made, but the drift shows them to be in part finely crystal- 
 line blue limestone, and in x)art quartzite, white, gray, or green, often 
 considerably altered and often coarse grained. The amount of quart- 
 zite in the drift implies a considerable thickness of this rock and 
 suggests that the strata are of Cambrian age, as this is the onlj^ divi- 
 sion of the Paleozoic in this region which contains great amounts of 
 quartzite. 

From this neighborhood northward the Panamint Range is com- 
 posed chiefly of old Paleozoic stratified rocks till near its northern 
 end, as can be plainly seen from Death Vallej". On the accomi^anj^- 
 ing map Cambrian rocks are represented as running along the crest 
 of the range, the flanks being occupied by Silurian. 

The Panamint Range has been examined by Mr. II. W. Fairlianks'^ 
 for some distance north of the region crossed b}^ the writer. Mr. 
 Fairbanks found on the western side of the range, north of Windy 
 Gap as far as the Pinto Range (whicli is a spur of the Panamint 
 Range running northwesterly from the Wild Rose mining district), 
 that a large portion of the rocks are mica- schists, quartzites, and 
 marbles, which have been cut by intrusive granite. According to Mr. 
 Fairbanks, the Pinto Range, as viewed from the Argus Range, appears 
 also to be formed of bands of marble of various colors. 

In the Grapevine Range at Boundary Canyon Mr. Gilbert ^ f oiind 
 limestones containing imperfect Cambrian fossils. lie notes that in 
 that part of the Panamint Range which lies opposite Boundary 
 Canyon the rocks appear from a distant view to be similar.
