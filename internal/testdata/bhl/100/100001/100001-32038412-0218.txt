202 GEOLOGY OF NEVADA SOUTH OF 40TH PARALLEL, [bull.208. 

The strike of the folds is parallel with the trend of the range, so 
 that unless disturbed by cross faulting the same general formations 
 will be found for many miles. Therefore the Cambrian and Silurian 
 have been represented on the map as extending northward until 
 covered by volcanic flows at the northern end of the range. 

SILURIAN AND CARBONIFEROUS. 

Mr. F. B. Weeks, of the U. S. Geological Survey, visited various 
 parts of the range in 1900. Near Panamint he found quartzite and 
 limestones which he referred on stratigraphic grounds to the Cam- 
 brian. South of Shaw Peak (near the northern end of the range) he 
 found a considerable extent of Silurian rocks, with Lower Silurian 
 (Pogonip) fossils, as subsequently determined by Mr."Ulrich. South 
 of here the Silurian Pogonip formation was succeeded by the over- 
 lying Eureka quartzite, and still farther south were the Upper 
 Silurian limestones, making the Silurian belt extend to Cottonwood 
 Canyon. At the mouth of Cottonwood Canyon Mr. Weeks found 
 Carboniferous fossils â€” Productus, crinoid stems, and a species of 
 Serainula {?) . 

EARLY TERTIARY. 

The eastern flanks of the range fronting Death Valley, as seen on 
 the road between Furnace Creek and Windy Gap, are composed of 
 upturned, j^ellow-green strata and associated volcanics lying upon 
 the older rocks with no evident unconformity, and partaking of their 
 folds. This belt of interbedded volcanics and sediments grows wider 
 toward the south, and soon completely covers, the Paleozoic area, 
 which is wedged out between the younger series and the granite. 
 The same series occurs along a great part of the road which crosses 
 the range to Windy Gap. It consists of layers of calcareous tufa, 
 evidently chemical deposits, with brown conglomerates containing 
 lava bowlders, interstratified with and covered by lava, lava conglom- 
 erate, and lava breccia. The lava in these belts proved, in three 
 different samples, to be biotite-hornblende-andesite. 

This series of conglomerates, breccias, tufiis, chemical precipitates, 
 and lavas is the same as that exposed on the ojDposite side of Death 
 Valley, where it forms practically^ the whole mass of the Funeral 
 Mountains. In the Funeral Mountains these rocks have been pro- 
 visionally correlated with the Esmeralda formation in the Silver Peak 
 Range, which are chiefly Eocene-Miocene. 

LATE TERTIARY. 

Mr. H. W. Fairbanks notes" that on the northern slopes of the 
 Panamint Range, overlooking Mesquite Valley, there are large areas 
 of gravels, which are unconsolidated and reach an elevation of 6,000 
 feet, extending nearly to the summit of the range. These may be
