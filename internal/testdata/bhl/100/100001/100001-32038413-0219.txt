comparable to the j^onnger semi-iudurated conglomerate series in 
 the Funeral Range, which is probablj^ late Tertiary/' or may be even 
 Pleistocene. 

PLEISTOCENE, 

At the foot of the range, above Death Valley, at its southern 
 end, one finds, overlying unconformably the Tertiary deposits just 
 described, bluffs of well-rolled pebbles and small bowlders with per- 
 fectly horizontal stratification, the strata making a continual angle 
 with the slight dip of the surface to the east. This horizontalitj^ sug- 
 gests that the deposit is a lake deposit, and connects it with similar 
 conglomerates observed in a similar position in the lower part of 
 Furnace Creek, in the Funeral Mountains. These conglomerates are 
 also intimately connected with the gravels which occupy the bottom 
 of Death Yalley and with the salt desert which occurs between the two 
 localities just described. 

IGNEOUS ROCKS. 

In the southern portion of the range the core of the mountains for 
 some distance is made up of a body of massive granite, which varies 
 to gâ€¢ranite-porph5^r5^ This granite appears to be intrusive into the 
 Paleozoic rocks, but not into the Tertiaries. Along the road which 
 crosses the range east of Windy Gap the granite is hidden beneath 
 these Tertiary rocks, but just south of the road another patch of 
 granite is exposed around Granite Peak. The rock at Granite Peak 
 was shown by microscopic examination to be a biotite-granite, verging 
 toward alaskite, while farther north two samples of granite proved to 
 be biotite-granite-porphyry. 

Farther north, according to Mr. Fairbanks,^ the granite which cuts 
 the ancient limestones and quartzites in the mining regions on the 
 east side of Panamint Vallej^ is a biotite-hornblende-granite with 
 much quartz. 

VOLCANIC ROCKS. 

As already stated, volcanic rocks make up a considerable portion 
 of the Tertiary formations. Three specimens of these rocks examined 
 all proved to be biotite- or hornblende-andesite, but probably other 
 rocks occur in the series. 

Overljang these folded lavas unconformably is a later flow of more 
 basic rock, which covers a considerable area in the neighborhood of 
 Browns Peak, just south of Windy Gap. Two specimens of this rock 
 taken at different places proved to be in one ease pyroxene-aleutite, 
 and in the other bronzite-olivine-aleutite.^ Analysis shows them to 
 be rather siliceous for the species.
