204 GEOLOGY OF JSTEVADA SOUTH OF 40TH PARALLEL, [bull. 208. 

Mr. H. W. Fairbanks states'^' that ou the northern slopes of the 
 Panamint Range, overlooking Mesquite Vallej^, there are scattered 
 sheets of andesite and basalt. 

Yet another sei'ies of volcanics is exposed in this region. It is that 
 forming the greater part of the Slate Range, which lies immediately 
 west of the sonlhern end of the Panamint Range. The same rocks 
 o^cur in the region south of Browns Peak, in the Panamint Range, 
 underljdng the aleutites. These older volcanics are comparatively 
 light colored and weathei' reddish ; they are, moreover, considerably 
 sheared. Thin sections fail to exactly determine their nature, except 
 that the}^ are really lavas with glassy groundmass, and that they are 
 largely feldspathic. From the shearing it is jirobablethat these lavas 
 are older than those in the folded Tertiar3^ series. 

Mr. Fairbanks^ found forming the highest portion of the Panamint 
 Range for a number of miles east of Panamint a body of ancient 
 rhyolite, which he regards as one of the most ancient lavas observed 
 in the region. 

According to Mr. F. B. Weeks, of the United States Geological Sur- 
 vey, who has visited the northern end of the Panamint Range, the 
 Paleozoic rocks are here covered by extensive flows of lava, which 
 appear to be nearlj^ continuous with the lava area at the extreme 
 southwestern end of the Silver Peak Range. 

STRUCTURE. 

That portion of the Panamint Range between a point opposite Fur- 
 nace Creek and Windy Gap api^eared to the writer, studjang it through 
 field glasses, to be, in general, anticlinal. From Cottonwood Canyon 
 northward to Shaw Peak, according to Mr. F. B. Weeks,^ the Pale- 
 ozoic strata dip in general north of west. 

The Paleozoic and Tertiary strata on the east side of the range, 
 south of Emigrant Canyon, are apparently conformable and have the 
 same folds. There is here a series of alternating anticlines and syn- 
 clines, having trends due north and south. Each of these folds maj^ 
 be traced continuouslj^ for a number of miles. The axes of the folds, 
 as sketched on the map, form a series of straight lines of moderate 
 length, tiie more southern of which are continually^ offset to the east 
 from the more northern ones. The explanation of this phenomenon 
 may be a series of east-west faults, which fault the folds system- 
 aticall}^ to the east on the south side. 

Just north of the eastern part of the road which runs from Furnace 
 Creek to Windy Gap, where this road enters the Panamint Range, 
 the strike of the folds changes from north and south to northwest and 
 southeast, and so continues to the extreme termination of the range, 
 in the neighborhood of Owlshead Peak. In all this extreme southern 
 portion there are no Paleozoics, but the Tertiary interbedded sedi-
