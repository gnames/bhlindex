ments and lavas .show the same system of folding as in the Paleozoics, 
 altlioiigh somewhat less pronouuced. 

The Pluto Mountains, a spur of the Panamiut Range, lying north- 
 east of the "Wild Rose mining district, are stated by Mr. Fairbanks'* 
 to have an apparent monoclinal structure, exposing an enormous 
 thickness of strata whose truncated edges face Panamiut Yalley. 

In tlie Panamiut Range much of the deformation must be of com- 
 paratively recent date. AVe know that much of it occurred since the 
 deposition of the Tertiary beds and associated lavas, since these are 
 involved with the Paleozoics in the upturning". 

ORE DEPOSITS. 

The following brief note on the ores of the Panamiut Range is 
 gleaned from the reports of Mr. H. W. Fairbanks.* Near Postof&ce 
 Springs gold is found in quartz veins inclosed in limestone, which is 
 folded to a syncline, with slates below and on both sides. The ore is 
 high grade. In the neighborhood of the old town of Panamiut are 
 found silver-bearing sulphides of copper, antimony, and arsenic, 
 sti'omeyerite and tetrahedrite being the most common minerals. The 
 gangue of the veins is quartz, and the veins are found in all the sed- 
 imentary formations of the district. North of here, in the Wild Rose 
 district, a similar class of ores is found. Galena is seldom observed. 

LEACH POINT AND BURNT ROCK MOUNTAINS. 

The roughly defined east-west chain of low, irregular mountains 
 which stretches eastward from the southern end of the Sierra Nevada 
 at El Paso Peak to Pilot Knob is continued farther east in other Ioav, 
 irregular mountains, which just east of Pilot Knob have been called 
 the Burnt Rock Mountains, and still farther, in the same direction, the 
 Leach Point Mountains. On the north of these mountaius the narrow 
 Leach Point Yallej^ separates them from the southern end of the Pan- 
 amiut Range. On the south lies the Mojave Desert. 

SEDIMENTARY ROCKS. 

LIMESTONE. 

About 8 miles northeast of Pilot Knob there occurs, along the 
 main traveled road, an outlying spur from the low mountains, which 
 is composed of very sandy blue limestone, amounting almost to a 
 graj^ ciuartzite. This is interbedded with shaly and cherty thin- 
 bedded limestones. This rock strikes N. 00° E. and dips E. 65°. 
 It is slightly altered and sheared, and no fossils were found. It forms 
 only a small patch, and is overlain by basalt.
