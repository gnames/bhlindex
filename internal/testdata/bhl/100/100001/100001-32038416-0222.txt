206 GEOLOGY OF NEVADA SOUTH OF 40TH PARALLEL, [bull, 208. 

The bulk of the mountains Ijang east of Pilot Knob are flat topped 
 and slightly pinnacled. They consist of light-colored stratified beds, 
 with intercalated sheets of lava, the whole, in general, capped by 
 black sheets of basalt. Mr. Gilbert '^ has also noted these deposits in 
 this range. They are probably the sam^ as those exposed in the 
 El Paso Mountains, where they contain Eocene fossils, and they are 
 also the same as those which make up the Funeral Range and thus are 
 widelj^ distributed throughout this region. 

IGNEOUS ROCKS. 

GRANITE. 

Along the western edge of these mountains granite is seen to be 
 the basal rock. A specimen collected a few miles north of Pilot 
 Knob appears to be a typical biotite-granite. The relation of this 
 rock to the limestone above described is not known, but it is very 
 likel}'^ intrusive in it, if we may judge from the similar occurrences 
 in the Panamint and El Paso ranges and in other neighboring ranges. 

VOLCANIC ROCKS. 

Some miles north of Pilot Knob typical tordrillite* was collected, 
 apparently derived from one of the sheets intercalated in the lake beds. 

Sheets of black basalt overlie the lake beds and constitute the 
 latest volcanic rock of the region. 

STRUCTURE. 

The Tertiary beds and intercalated lava sheets seem to be, in gen- 
 eral, nearly horizontal, but in one place at least — about 4 miles north- 
 east of Pilot Knob — an anticlinal fold was observed, having a nearly 
 north-south trend, with dips of from 10° to 20° on the limbs. 

WHITE MOUNTAIN RANGE. 

The important mountain range immediately east of the Sierra has 
 gone by the name of the White Mountains in its northern portion and 
 the Inyo Range in its southern. Inasmuch as the two so-called ranges 
 are not in any way disconnected, but form a complete whole, they will 
 be here, for the sake of convenience, described together under the head 
 of the White Mountain Range, as suggested by Mr. Walcott.'^ The 
 range extends in a northwesterly and southeasterly direction, from 
 the Candelaria Mountains on the north to the neighborhood of 
 Owens Lake on the south, passing at both ends into lower, irregular 
 mountains of lava. No part of the range has been visited by the writer,
