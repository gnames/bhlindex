SPURR.] WHITE MOUNTAIN RANGE. 207 

and the following notes are entirely a compilation of observations, 
 although now for the first time brought together. The observers 
 include Messrs. Gilbert, Walcott, Turner, and Weeks, of the United 
 States Geological Survej'', and Goodyear, Gabb, and other geologists 
 of the geological survey of California. 

TOPOGRAPHY. 

As a rule the topography of the White Mountains is characterized 
 by great relief, with deep canyons and high peaks. On the eastern 
 side of the range there is an abrupt scarp for manj'^ miles, while the 
 western slope, although generally steep, is on the average considerably 
 gentler than the eastern. White Mountain Peak, which is at the 
 northern end of the range, is of granite, and is a conspicuous land- 
 mark for many miles. It stands exactly on the boundary between 
 Nevada and California. 

SEDIMENTARY ROCKS. 
 CAMBRIAN. 

Near the central portion of the range, or at the southern end of 

the White Mountains proper, Mr. Gilbert '^ early observed a series of 

quartzites and schists with a little limestone. The age of this series 

he did not determine. Later Mr. Walcott investigated it and found 

it to be Lower Cambrian. Mr. Walcott's chief studies were on the 

western side of the range. In several canyons to the east of Big Pine, 

namely, Waucobi, Black, and Silver canyons, Mr. Walcott* found the 

following section:

2. Siliceous slates and quartzites 2, 000 

1. Siliceous limestones . 1, 700 

Total 4,900 

No fossils were found in the lower limestone, but in the lower silice- 
 ous series are annelid trails and in places the heads of Olenellus, 
 Avhile in the upper limestone are great quantities of Cambrian corals, 
 of the same types as occur in the Silver Peak Range to the east. 
 Mr. Walcott notes that this is the oldest Cambrian fauna known in 
 the western portion of the United States. 

Northward from this locality Mr. Walcott found Cambrian rocks 
 along the western face of the range, nearly to its northern end. 

On the eastern side of the range he found many of the low moun- 
 tains lying northeast of Salinas Valley^ to be Cambrian, and also a
