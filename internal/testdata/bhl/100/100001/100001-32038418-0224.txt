great part of the main White Mountain Range bordering the same 
 valley on the west. At the latter locality Cambrian rocks are cut by 
 great masses of intrusive granite. At the northern end of the range 
 Cambrian rocks occur in considerable quantities on the eastern side, 
 alternating with areas of granite which are intrusive into them." 

The rocks have here suffered considerable contact metamorphism 
 bj^ the granite, the limestones being sometimes changed to dolomitic 
 marbles. 

SILURIAN. 

Mr. Walcott* discovered a patch of rocks bearing Silurian (Trenton) 
 fossils on the eastern side of the range, southeast from Big Pine, along 
 the road leading from Waucobi Canyon. 

Mr. F. B. Weeks* found in 1900, near the head of Mazurka Canyon, 
 rolled remains of crinoids and fragments of biyozoa which indicate 
 that the rocks at this place are not older than Middle Ordovician, 
 and may be somewhat younger. 

At the southern end of the range, in the vicinity of Cerro Gordo, 
 Dr. O. Loew^' reports that the rocks are largely Silurian limestones 
 containing great numbers of fossils, whose genera and species, how- 
 ever, he does not record. These rocks, he notes, are cut into by 
 intrusive masses of granitic rocks. 

CARBONIFEROUS. 

Mr. Walcott'^ records that Mr. Fairbanks, of the California Mining 
 Bureau, discovered the characteristic Coal Measures fossil, F'usuliiia 
 cyUndrica, in the southern end of the range east of Keeler. 

Also at the southern end of the range, just below the summit of 
 Cerro Gordo Peak the follow^ing Carboniferous fossils were found by 
 Mr. Weeks in 1900, and were determined by Dr. Girty: 

Rhipidomella ? sp. 
 Aniplexus westi ? 
 Prodtictiis fragments. 
 Marginifera splendens ? 

TRIASSICi 

Just east of Cami) Independence Dr. Horn, of the California geo- 
 logical survey, discovered a fossil in a series of slates with intercalated 
 limestone beds, which was considered by Mr. Gabb' to be Triassic. 

According to Professor Whitney, these same slates extend north- 
 ward from Bend City (just east of Camp Independence) for :25 miles. 
 Yet this general region is delineated on the map accompanying this
