spuRR.] WHITE MOUNTAIN RANGE. 209 

bulletin as granite, following the preliminary geological maps of the 
 State of California, published in 1891 by the State Mining Bureau. 

South of the locality above mentioned, near the crest of the range, 
 halfway between Independence and Owens Lake, Mr. AValcotf^* found 
 a single block containing Triassic fossils. 

Mr. Turner'* traced the Triassic rocks as a continuous belt between 
 the two localities above mentioned and also some distance farther 
 south along the western flanks of the range. Mr. Turner states that 
 the rocks consist essentially of Triassic lavas with iuterbedded tuffs. 
 The same rocks occur on the western side of Owens Valley, northwest 
 of Owens Lake, on the flanks of the Sierras, and here also are of the 
 same character. 

From the lithology of the Triassic rocks above mentioned a proba- 
 ble coi'relation is established with the Koipato group of the fortieth 
 parallel Triassic, as defined by King. 

PLIOCENE. 

Just east of Big Pine Mr. Walcott^ has described a considerable 
 area covered by consolidated stratified deposits, which he regards as 
 lake beds. The strata consist of fine calcareous, arenaceous, and 
 argillaceous sands with layers of fine conglomerate, the whole being 
 covered by angular debris washed down from the mountain since the 
 deposition of the stratified material. The deposits are coarser near 
 the mountains and finer as the distance increases. Some of the white 
 beds are made up almost entirelj^ of fresh-water shells, concerning 
 which Dr. Dall says: "Anj^ of them may be recent or Pliocene. My 
 imjjression from the mass is that they are Pleistocene." Mr. Walcott^ 
 found these beds reaching from the bottom of the valley up to a height 
 of 3,000 feet above the valley, or to an actual height above sea level 
 of about 7,000 feet. As an explanation for the great height at which 
 these deposits are found, Mr. Walcott mentions two main hypoth- 
 eses — first, that a lake 3,000 feet deep existed over the site of the 
 present Owens Lake, and, second, that the Inyo or White Mountain 
 Range has been elevated since the deposition of the lake beds, carry- 
 ing up these beds with it. He inclines to the view that the latter is 
 the correct hypothesis, on account of the steep easterly scarp of the 
 range, which might be taken as a fault scarp, and from other consid- 
 erations. * 

The character of these beds, as described by Mr. Walcott, and their 
 nearly horizontal attitude are identical with those of deposits of the 
 late Pliocene lake which has already been described by the writer as 
 observed by him in numerous localities in Nevada, but chiefly in the 
 region between Lake Mono and Carson. All these beds he has con- 
 sidered as the deposits of a late Pliocene lake— the Lake Shoshone of
