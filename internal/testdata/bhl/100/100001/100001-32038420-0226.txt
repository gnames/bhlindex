King." In the region just nortli of Lake Mono he found the highest 
 deiDOsits of this lake at an altitude of 7,100 feet, and came to the con- 
 clusion that the uppermost deposits of the ancient Lake Mono formed 
 part of the deposits of the same great water body. When the great 
 lake stood at this altitude it must have been connected by numerous 
 straits with the valley of the present Owens River, which formed an 
 arm of the same lake. The uppermost limit of the lake beds noted by 
 Mr. Walcott coincides almost exactly with the uppermost limit in the 
 vicinity of Lake Mono and to the north of it. It is therefore likely 
 that the deposits on the slopes of the White Mountain Range are to 
 be correlated with these other deposits. The age indicated by the 
 fossils found by Mr. Walcott also coincides with the other determina- 
 tions made in other localities, all combining to indicate a period 
 between late Pliocene and early Pleistocene. 

If this is the case, no local elevation of the Wliite Mountains can be 
 inferred from the position of the lake beds at the comparatively great 
 altitude where they are found, since the altitude is similar over the 
 whole region. As was inferred by the writer with reference to the 
 region around Lake Mono, there appears to have been a general uplift 
 of mountain and valley throughout this whole region, lifting the 
 deposits of the Pliocene lake about 1,000 feet higher than farther 
 north. 

South of Owens Lake Mr. Turner found * well-stratified sands, 
 gravels, and tuffs, occupying a large portion of the valley beneath 
 the overlying Pleistocene accumulations, and having a slight dip west- 
 ward. These may belong to the same series as above described. The 
 same beds are mentioned by Mr. Fairbanks,'^ who notes that at Owens 
 Lake they reach an elevation of- at least 1,500 feet above the lake 
 surface. Mr. Fairbanks regards these beds as formed under water. '^ 

IGNEOUS ROCKS. 
 GRANITIC ROOKS. 

Mr. Gilbert ^ noted that the eastern ridge of the White Mountains, 
 east of Deep Springs Valley, is composed of granite. The map of the 
 California State Mining Bureau-^ shows a number of other granite 
 areas. On this map the whole northern end of the range in the vicin- 
 ity of White Mountain Peak is shown to be of granite, and also most 
 of the range from Loehr Peak southward to Deep Springs Valley. 
 Farther south, a considerable area of granitic rocks is shown south of

f'Mr. M. B. Campbell's later notes on these gravels (Bull. U. S. Geol. Survey No. 200, p. 20) show 
 that they are gently folded lake sediments containing much volcanic tuff. They are very likely 
 pre-Pliocene (Eocene or Miocene), like the lake beds in Funei-al Range.
