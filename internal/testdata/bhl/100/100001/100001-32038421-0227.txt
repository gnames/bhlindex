SPURR] WHITE MOUNTAIISr RANGE. 211 

Waucoln Peak,*^ while a small area is shown southwest of Salinas Val- 
 lej^, also in the center of the range. In the low monntains lying 
 northeast of Salinas Valley two considerable areas are shown. 

From personal commnnications of Messrs. Walcott, Turner, and 
 Weeks, further information on the extent of the granite has been 
 obtained. The two northern granite areas represented as separate 
 on the above-cited map appear to be continuous between Loehr Peak 
 and White Mountain Peak. On the eastern side of the northern end of 
 the range a great deal of granitic rock is found, cutting bhe Cambrian 
 sediments. Farther south, the granite area south of Waucobi Peak 
 extends sontheastward in a continuous belt to the area southwest of 
 Salinas Valley, and the Cambrian beds west of Salinas Valley are cut 
 through by juasses of the same rock. 

VOLCANIC ROCKS. 

As noted above, many of the Triassic rocks are lavas. There are, 
 moreover, some areas of Tertiary and Pleistocene lavas^ as repre- 
 sented on the map. Mr. Gilbert ^ noted some basalt just east of Big 
 Pine. The map of the California Mining Bureau, above mentioned, 
 shows an area of volcanic rocks lying on the west flanks of the range 
 in the neighborhood of Waucobi Peak, and connecting westward 
 across Owens Vallej^ with a larger area of lava on the eastern, slopes 
 of the Sierra. The same map also shows volcanic rocks lying on the 
 northern slopes of the granite of White Mountain Peak, at the north- 
 ern end of the range, and shows a great area of lava lying southeast 
 of Owens Lake, and forming the southern end of the range. Mr. 
 Turner found that the mountains east of Sandy Springs, which form 
 a kind of connection between the northern end of the White Mountain 
 Range and the Silver Peak Range, are mostly volcanic. 

ORE DEPOSITS. 

The following notes are taken from Mr. H. W. Fairbanks's writings. ^ 
 Silver-lead ores, chiefly in limestone, are found about Cerro Gordo 
 and southeast of Independence. 

Auriferous quartz veins are abundant. They are found north of 
 Cerro Gordo, in the Beveridge district, in the Alhambra Hills, 5 miles 
 north of Lone Pine, between Independence and Big Pine, and east 
 and northeast of Bishop Creek. The veins are chiefly in or near 
 granite, often at or near the contact of it with slates or limestones. 
 They probablj^ have a genetic connection with the granitic intrusion. 

<i According to Professor Whitney, however (Geological Survey of California, Geology, Vol. I, 
 p. 459), the western face of the range, south of Waucobi Peak to Bend City (just east of Camp 
 Independence), is composed of tilted slates and other stratified rocks. If this is the case, these 
 stratified rocks are undoubtedly continuous with the Triassic rocks south of Camp Inde- 
 pendence.
