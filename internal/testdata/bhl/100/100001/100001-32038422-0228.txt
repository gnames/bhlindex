STRUCTURE. 

Mr. Gilbert^ gives a cross section of the range east of Big Pine, 
 which exhibits several adjacent folds of moderate dip, broken by a 
 number of faults. According to Mr. Gilbert's section the faults are 
 not directly expressed in the topography. 

Later Mr. Walcott * described several sections of the White Moun- 
 tain Range, in the same general region as that in which Mr. Gilbert's 
 section was made. Mr. Walcott also finds the range made up of a 
 number of adjacent folds broken by faults, and finds the chief fold to 
 be a closely compressed syncline overthrown to the east, thus present- 
 ing a type of structure common in the Appalachians. 

DARWIN OR ARGUS RANGE. 

This range is low and of no great importance. It lies between the 
 Panamint Range and the Coso Mountains and is south-southeast of the 
 White Mountain Range. The range is about 70 miles in length and 
 very narrow. Through its northern portion Darwin Canyon runs. 

SEDIMENTARY ROCKS. 

Mr. H. W. Fairbanks^ notes that the eastern face of the Argus 
 Range, from Darwin to Modoc, is made up largely of limestone, which 
 sometimes forms the crest of the range and is present in great thick- 
 ness. Besides the limestone there is also calciferous quartzite. 

The age of this Paleozoic series is not known, but it is provisionally 
 mapped as Cambrian, in view of the probable age of the rocks of the 
 Panamint Range to the east.^ 

IGNEOUS ROCKS. 

According to Mr. Fairbanks,^ granite occupies a considerable por- 
 tion of the Argus Range, forming part of a continuous body which 
 stretches from the Mojave Desert to the Sierra Nevada. In general, 
 it is a granular, light-colored, biotite-hornblende rock. 

VOLCANIC ROCKS. 

From Darwin Canyon north to the 36° 30' parallel the mountains 
 are described as black lava hills on the topographic map of the 
 Wheeler Survey (65-D). This same portion of the range is also rep- 
 resented as volcanic on the preliminary geologic map of California,

rfSince writing the above Mr. F. B Weeks has informed the writer that in 1900 he fodnd in 
 Shepherd Canyon heavy exposures of quartzite overlain by limestone, which he had no hesita- 
 tion in referring on stratigraphic grounds to the Cambrian.
