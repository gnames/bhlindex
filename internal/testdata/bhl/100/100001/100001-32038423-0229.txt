SPURR.] DARWIN AND SLATE RANGES. 213 

issued hj the California mining bureau in 1891. On this maj) the 
 lava is represented as extending southward along the range to a point 
 beyond Malurango Peak. 

Mr. H. ^y. Fairbanks" reports numerous flows of andesite and 
 basalt through the Argus Range, forming inclined plateaus on the 
 mountain slopes. One of these basalt flows is exposed in Argus 
 Gulch, and beneath it is an ancient river channel flUed with clay and 
 gravel. 

The southern portion of the range has a volcanic appearance, as 
 seen by the writer from a point farther south. 

ORE DEPOSITS. 

Mr. Fairbanks* states that a large number of gold-bearing quartz 
 A^eins are scattered through the southern portion of the Argus Range. 
 There is also, in the neighborhood of Darwin and Modoc, considerable 
 galena, rich in silver, in chambers in the limestone. 

SLATE RANGE. 

The Slate Range lies in Panamint Valley, between the southern end 
 of the Panamint and that of the Darwin or Argus ranges. It has an 
 extent of only about 12 miles, and is comparatively low and narrow. 
 The range derives its name from the fact that its rocks have been 
 sheared so as to assume a slaty structure. 

SEDIMENTARY ROCKS. 
 PALEOZOIC. 

Mr. H. W. Fairbanks states that nietamorphic strata appear promi- 
 nently in the Slate Range. 

TERTIARY. 

At the extreme southern end of the range schistose volcanics are 
 overlain by cream-colored Tertiarj^ sediments, capped by later basaltic 
 lava. These Tertiary sediments are probably the same as those 
 exposed in the Panamint Range just east of here, and also in the 
 Funeral Mountains. 

IGNEOUS ROCKS. 
 VOLCANIC ROCKS. 

So far as could be observed, the range near Windy Gap and from 
 here southward to the extreme end consists of uniform rocks. As 
 examined under the microscope, these rocks seem to be sheared 
 feldspathic lava, much altered. The exact nature of the lava could 
 not be determined, but it consists chiefly of a glassy groundmass, with 
 phenocrysts of feldspar. One specimen studied was so sheared as to 
 be comminuted into bits.
