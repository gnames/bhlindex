214 GEOLOGY OF NEVADA SOUTH OF 40TH PARALLEL, [bull.208. 

The age of the schistose volcanics is not known, except that thej^ 
 are older than tlie basalt and probably older also than the Tertiary 
 sediments. Their shearing suggests a considerable age and also sug- 
 gests that they may be connected with the granites of the Panamint 
 Range, or with the ancient rhyolite of that range east of Panamint,^ 
 which rhyolite has a probable connection with that in the vicinity of 
 Johannesburg. 

At the northern end of the range the slaty rocks appear to be in 

part overlain bj^ later volcanic flows, as seen from the south end. 

There are probably basalts similar to those at the south end of the 

range. 

COSO RANGE. 

IGNEOUS ROCKS. 

The central portion of the Coso Mountains is made up of granite 
 and gneissoidal rocks. '^ The rock in this range is reported by Mr. 
 H. W. Fairbanks'^ to be a coarse, easily decomposed granite, and the 
 same writer states that granite makes up most of the rest of the range. ^ 
 This granite is continuous with the granite of the Sierra Nevada. 

VOLCANIC ROCKS. 

Mr. Gilbert notes that the western base of Coso Range, south of 
 Owens Lake, appears to be entirely eruptive. Mr. Fairbanks-^ has 
 noted volcanic rocks belonging to two distinct periods of eruption in 
 the western part of the range. To the older rocks belong rhyolites 
 and andesites, while the younger consist of extensive flows of basalt 
 (so recent in origin that their surfaces have been but slightly modified 
 by erosion), reaching southward in long arms into Salt Wells Valley. 

EL PASO RANGE. 

The El Paso Range is a rugged, irregular bunch of mountains con- 
 stituting an outlier of the southern Sierra Nevada, south of the Coso 
 Range. The general trend of its ridges is east and west. It is 
 bounded on the north by Salt Wells Valley and on the south by the 
 Mohave Desert. 

SEDIMENTARY ROCKS. 

According to Mr. H. W. Fairbanks,^ the stratified rocks of a meta- 
 morphic series (probably Paleozoic) form a part of the El Paso Range 
 and are cut by the granite.
