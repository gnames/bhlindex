SPURR.] EL PASO RANGE. 215 

EARLY TERTI ARIES. 

Mr. Gilbert '^ lias described a series of semiconsolidated beds in 
 Redrock Canyon, in the southern part of the El Paso Monntains. 
 These beds dip westward at angles ranging- from 15° to 30° and con- 
 sist of semiconsolidated sand, gravel, and volcanic tnffs interbedded 
 with basalts and rhyolites. The gravels contain pebbles of quartz 
 and various volcanic rocks. 

Mr. H. W. Fairbanks^ describes the same series on the northern 
 slope of the El Paso Range, where it also consists of clays, sandstone, 
 volcanic tuffs, and interbedded lava sheets. The whole thickness is 
 estimated to be 1,000 feet or more, and the series extends over a con- 
 siderable area between the El Paso Range and the Sierra Nevada. 
 Between clay strata, apparently below the tuffs, southeast of Black 
 Mountain, a seam of coal 14 inches thick occurs in this series. In the 
 clay above the coal leaf impressions were found, which Dr. F. H. 
 Knowlton considered as probably belonging to the Eocene. Mr. Fair- 
 banks notes that andesite appears as flows between the beds as well 
 as in dikes cutting them and as sheets capping them. 

The series of semiconsolidated, tilted tuffs, sands, gravels, and vol- 
 canic sheets is evidently identical with that which constitutes the 
 Funeral Range and the southern end of the Panamint Range, as 
 described. As has already been stated, these latter beds are believed 
 to be the same as those still farther north, in the neighborhood of 
 Silver Peak. 

IGNEOUS ROCKS. 

Mr. Gilbert^ notes that the El Paso Mountains have a core of 
 granite. The same is noted by Mr. Fairbanks.'^ 

X VOLCANIC ROCKS. 

Mr. Fairbanks* notes that quartz-porphja-ies appear for several 
 miles along the El Paso Range. The writer found that near Johan- 
 nesburg and Randsburg, which lie among low hills just east of El 
 Paso Range, the jjrincipal rock is an ancient sheared rhyolite. To 
 one looking from this point westward this same rhyolite appears to 
 form a considerable portion of the eastern end of this range also. It 
 is possible that this is the same rock that Mr. Fairbanks describes as 
 quartz-porphyry. It is the most ancient volcanic rock found in the 
 region, and is probably nearly contemporaneous with the schistose 
 volcanics described at the southern end of the Slate Range. It
