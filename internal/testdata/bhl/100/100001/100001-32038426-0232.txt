underlies the early Tertiar3^ sediments. Mr. Gilbert^' notes that at 
 the eastern end of the El Paso Mountains there is a large mountain 
 of acidic lavas, inclosing and nearly concealing a core of granite. 

Mr. Gilbert also notes that the El Paso Mountains are flanked to 
 the south by basaltic and trachytic rocks. Mr. Fairbanks* describes 
 andesites as occurring freely in this range. The trachytes described 
 by Mr. Gilbert are probably the andesites of Mr. Fairbanks, since 
 trachytes, as now understood, are very rare in this region. 

STRUCTURE. 

Reasoning from the tilting of the earlj^ Tertiary sediments, Mr. 
 Fairbanks has inferred three distinct movements of Black Mountain 
 in the El Paso Range. As the result of these movements, the Ter- 
 tiary beds have been elevated, tilted, and extensively eroded. 

ORE DEPOSITS. 

According to Mr. Fairbanks,'' the granite of the El Paso Range has 
 been in different places mineralized, and contains a small amount of 
 gold. 

THE HILLS FROM RANDSBURG EAST TO PILOT KNOB. 

Forming a sort of continuation of the El Paso Range to the east is 
 a series of low, detached, rounded, or level-topped buttes, connected 
 by low ridges or Pleistocene detrital slopes, or entirelj^ separated l\v 
 an undulating detritus-covered desert. These hills have a general 
 east-west trend. 

SEDIMENTARY ROCKS. 

On the north slopes of Malapai Mountain, about 4 or 5 miles north- 
 east of Johannesburg, the hornblende-pja'oxene-aleutite, which 
 makes up the higher portion of the mountain, is underlain by 
 banded or bedded rocks, which at first have the aspect of altered vol- 
 canies, but which, when examined microscojjicallj^, turn out to be 
 arkoses of different degrees of coarseness. Most of them are granitic, 
 while some appear to be in part derived from rhyolite. These arkoses 
 probably overlie the ancient rhyolites. They are firmly consolidated, 
 and they may belong to the series of Eocene sediments found near 
 here, especially in the El Paso Range to the west, and on the east in 
 the Leach Point Mountains. 

On Pilot Knob, according to Mr. Gilbert,'^ are exposed about 2,000 
 feet ^of volcanic products, probabl}^ tuffs, overlain by basaltic lava. 
 These lie upon the granite, which is the base of the knob.
