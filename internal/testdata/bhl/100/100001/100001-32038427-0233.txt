IGNEOUS ROCKS. 

The lower portion of Pilot Knob is of siliceous biotite-granite. To 
 the south, southeast, and west this same body of granite extends 
 for miles. Many of the numerous small hills, which emerge from 
 the general plateau level of the desert area of granite, are often 
 capped l\y patches of basic lava or stratified Tertiary sediments. 

All the hills in the vicinity of Randsburg and Johannesburg con- 
 sist of ancient sheared rhyolites, often considerably decomposed. 
 When fresh, the rock appears to be a biotite-rhyolite, but as often as 
 not the biotite has completelj^ disappeared on account of decomposi- 
 tion, and the other minerals, notably orthoclase, have also become 
 considerably altered. It is in this rock that the gold-bearing veins of 
 the district occur, and the rhj^olite has been locally altered at the time 
 of the introduction of the ores so as to become a semijasperoid, and 
 sometimes even passes into vein quartz by a process which appears to 
 be chiefly replacement. 

This ancient sheared rhyolite resembles the sheared volcanics of 
 the southern end of the Slate Range. 

The greater portion of Malapai Mountain is made up of a consider- 
 able thickiiess of lava, which overlies the rhj^olite and underlies 
 basalt. Its intermediate age is also at once evident from its appear- 
 ance. A number of specimens of this rock have been studied and 
 show it to be probably a hornblende-i^yroxene-biotite-aleutite. This 
 rock has no ai)parent banding, and has a great variet}^ of texture 
 exposed by the erosion which it has undergone. 

The basaltic rock which caps Pilot Knob was also encountered just 
 west of this mountain. The sj)ecimen taken here proves to be a 
 P3^roxene-basalt, evidently belonging to the same general series as the 
 olivine-basalt of the region. In the Browns Peak region, in the south- 
 ern end of the Panamint Range, the same basalt occurs in a number 
 of buttes, caj)ping other rocks. 

At Johannesburg a dike of pyroxene-olivine-diabase-porjjhyry was 
 found, cutting the ancient rhyolites. This dike is probably to be cor- 
 related with the basaltic flows. 

The succession of igneous rocks in this district, therefore, is, so far 
 as made out, biotite-granite, biotite-rhyolite, hornblende-pyroxene- 
 biotite-aleutite, pyroxene-basalt, and pyroxene-olivine-diabase-por- 
 Pbyry. ^ 

ORE DEPOSITS. 

Gold-bearing veins are very numerous in the ancient rhyolite in the 
 vicinity of Johannesburg and Randsburg. The veins generally con- 
 sist of a central thin seam of quartz, flanked above and below by 
 sheared, silicified, and discolored country rock, which also may carry 
 quartz nodules or segregations. There are also larger veins of clearer 
 bluish quartz. Certain portions of these quartz veins and altered
