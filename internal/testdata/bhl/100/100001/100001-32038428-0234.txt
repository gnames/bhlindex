218 GEOLOGY OF NEVADA SOUTH OF 40TH PARALLEL, [bull 208. 

sheared zones carry free gold in such quantities as to malve them high- 
 grade ores. The schistosity of the rocks has a general northeast dip 
 of 15° and 20°, and the veins are usually conformable to this. 

SIERRA NEVADA. 

Properly speaking, the Sierra Nevada does not constitute part of 
 the present study. It was thought best, however, to include the east- 
 ern edge of this important mountain chain so as to show its relations 
 to the region lying east of it. For the sake of uniformity a few brief 
 descriptive notes will be given. The region is, geologically, a compli- 
 cated one, but has been the subject of a great amount of careful 
 study by many geologists, while the Basin region has been left almost 
 untouched. 

As a topographic feature the Sierra Nevada is a broad range, attain- 
 ing considerable elevation and having many well-defined peaks. Its 
 eastern face constitutes a sharp western limit to the interior Basin 
 region, which is characterized by narrow ridges of generall}^ less, 
 height, with flat desert valleys between. Unlike the Basin ranges,' 
 the Sierra Nevada is well watered and wooded, and from this circum- 
 stance has derived a different minor topograph}^ from that of the 
 Basin ranges. 

SEDIMENTARY ROCKS. 

Mr. Turner « states that it is probable that there are in the Sierra 
 Nevada formations ranging in age from Archean or Algonkian to 
 Recent. The rocks have been strongly affected by compression of 
 the crust, which has produced close folding and schistosity, and has 
 frequently obliterated the original nature and age of the sediments. 
 In different parts of the range, ^ however, the great series of auriferous 
 slates has been found to contain Silurian, Carboniferous, Triassic, and 
 Jurassic fossils. The superjacent series of less altered rocks consists 
 of strata ranging from the Upper Cretaceous through the Tertiary. 
 Large portions of the range are covered with auriferous river gravels 
 of Neocene age. 

Within the area represented by the map accompanying this bulle- 
 tin the stratified rocks occupy onlj^ restricted areas, surrounded by 
 great masses of granite. 

CAMBRIAN. 

Just west of Mono Lake there is a considerable patch of quartzites 
 and schists, mapped by Mr. Turner '^ as Paleozoic. Mr. Walcott^' sub- 
 sequently visited these rocks, and considers them identical with the 
 Cambrian series of the White Mountains. Southward from here a
