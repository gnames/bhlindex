SPURR.] , SIERRA NEVADA. 219 

short distance, on the Nortli Fork of San Joaqnin Biver, is an area of 
 similar rocks, according to Mr. Turner. Still farther southeast, not 
 far from Big Pine, in Owens Valley, Mr. Walcott found small patches 
 of Cambrian, and considers that these separate occurrences may 
 belong to a single belt. 

CARBONIFEROUS. 

On the extreme western edge of the map, northeast from Mariposa, 
 is an area of Carboniferous rocks which has been studied by Mr. 
 Turner. 

TRIASSIC. 

Northwest of Owens Lake, on the eastern flanks of the Sierra 
 Nevada, is an area of Triassic beds, consisting mainly of ancient 
 lavas and tuffs, similar to the Triassic rocks of the White Mountains 
 on the other side of the valley. 

Some distance south of here the region around Owens Peak con- 
 sists of rocks similar to the Triassic formations just described. No 
 fossils were found in this region. 

Just east of Silver City, which is southeast of Lake Tahoe, Mr. 
 Turner has mapped several small exposures of sedimentary rock. 
 In his reconnaissance map" these areas are mapped as doubtful 
 Juratrias. 

JURASSIC. 

A long tongue of the Jurassic rocks which occur at Mariposa comes 
 into the map at its extreme w^estern end. 

IGNEOUS KOCKS. 

The Sierra Nevada contains enormous quantities of igneous rocks, 
 both coarse and fine grained, and both surface flows and plutonic 
 and dike masses. According to Mr. Turner,^ the coarse-grained 
 rocks consist mosth^of granite and grauodiorite, wdth diorite, gabbro, 
 etc., while the abundant Tertiary lavas consist of andesite, rhyolite, 
 and basalt. 

In the area covered by the map accompanying this bulletin (PI. I) 
 the greater part of the Sierras consist of coarse, granular, igneous 
 rocks, among which granite and granitic rocks occupy the chief place. 

Overlying the ancient granites, within the limit of this map, come 
 occasional areas of Tertiary lavas. Mr. Turner has kindly supplied 
 the writer with notes concerning two of these regions, one of which is 
 in the neighborhood of Silver City and the other at the extreme 
 southern end of the range^ just north of the cut of the Southern 
 Paciflc Railway, between Tehachapi and Mojave. At the first-named 
 locality Mr. Turner obser <^ed at one point a thickness of half a mile of
