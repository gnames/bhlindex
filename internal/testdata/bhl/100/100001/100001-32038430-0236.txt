volcanic lavas and tuffs. The lavas occupy several separated areas, 
 and in them occur the ore deposits of the region. In the second 
 locality Tertiary lavas with Tertiary sediments make up the southern 
 flanks of the range. 

On the flanks of the range, about Fish Springs, are flows of basalt, 
 described by Mr. W. A. Goodyear." Mr, H. W. Fairbanks^ suggests 
 that these ma}^ be of the same age as the basalts of the Coso Range. 
 According to Mr. Fairbanks, also, "andesite covers a great stretch of 
 country about the head of Owens River, forming the crest of the 
 Sierra Nevada between it and the head of the North Fork of the San 
 Joaquin River." 

STRUCTURE. 

It has been recognized, from the evidence which the Mesozoic strata 
 of the Sierra Nevada offer, that the folding of the range was initiated 
 at the close of Jurassic time, after the Mariposa beds were deposited. '^ 
 During the period which succeeded this Jurassic movement erosion 
 produced great changes, and gradually brought about the formation 
 of a topograjjliy of little relief, the mountains being low, the valleys 
 broad, and the streams sluggish. This period appears to have reached 
 its maximum during the Miocene. ^^ Subsequent to the development 
 of this style of topography there was a general disturbance which 
 brought about the acceleration of the streams and the cutting of deep 
 valleys, leaving high ridges between. This disturbance apparently 
 consisted in part of differential movement, but there are evidences that 
 the whole mass of the Sierra was uplifted at least 4,000 feet, and possi- 
 bly as much as 7,000 feet.* Mr. Turner^ concludes, from the fact 
 that the Neocene Gulf deposits, at the very west edge of the range, 
 have been elevated at least 1,000 feet above their original position, 
 that the mountains were uplifted as a whole, and not by a tilt to the 
 westward, for in the latter case the west edge of the block so tilted 
 would remain approximately at its original elevation. 

During the latter ]3art of the time that the Sierra Nevada region 
 was being worn down, a great series of auriferous gravels was depos- 
 ited by the sluggish streams. These gravels, after the uplift and the 
 acceleration of the drainage, remained often in the highest parts of 
 the range and in the regions between the present river valleys, especi- 
 ally where protected by later cappings of lava. 

The eastern face of the Sierra, for a distance of several hundred 
 miles, is very steep, contrasting strongly with the comparatively 
 uniform and gentle slope on the west. The earliest observ^ers saw in 
 this a probable fault scarp. Mr. Clarence King ^ was one of the first
