of these, and the hj^pothesis has been accepted by nearly all succeed- 
 ing geologists. 

The observations most in favor of the existence of a fault are those 
 of high gravels on the very summits of the mountains above the steep 
 eastern scarp. Mr. Diller'* has noted, at the northern end of the 
 range, that these gravels are displaced by a fault having about 3,000 
 feet vertical displacement, which extends along the eastern face of the 
 range. Mv. Russell ^ also found water- worn gravels on the top of the 
 range to the west of Mono Lake, at an altitude of about 11,500 feet. 
 Mr. Turner 'â–  found well-rounded pebbles on the main summit of the 
 range a few miles northwest of Tower Peak, at an elevation of over 
 9,000 feet. Mr. Turner observes that these gravel patches along the 
 crest of the range undoubtedly represent remnants of Neocene river 
 beds, now almost entirely eroded. 

The writer does not know of any case where actual faulting has 
 been proved by displacement of rocks, unless it is the case of the dis- 
 placement of i-ecent lavas along the crest north of Honey Lal^e, 
 described by Mr. Diller.'^ Even in many of the instances Avhere river 
 gravels have been found at the summit of the range, it is j^ossible 
 that some other hypothesis maybe found to explain their presence, as 
 well as that of faulting. Along most of the range the rocks of the 
 Sierra Nevada scarp do not stop abruptly, but are found in the ranges 
 lying next east. The eastern face of the range is not the boundary 
 between the granites on the west and the volcanics on the east, 
 as supposed by Russell.^ In the White Mountain, Pine Nut, and 
 other ranges Ijang next east of the Sierra, granitic rocks are found 
 forming the core, and also in some of the ranges farther east, 
 growing, however, continually lower until no longer exposed by 
 erosion. 

Mr. King/ considered that the fault along the eastern scarj) was 
 formed either within the Eocene or at the close of Eocene time, since 
 it evidentl}^ existed before the formation of the Miocene Piute 
 Lake, which was an inclosed inland body of water and was shut 
 off from the sea by the barrier of the Sierra. On the other hand, 
 Mr. Diners' considered that the fault along the eastern scarp must 
 have been formed very recently, in Jjost-Tertiary time, ^ince the Ter- 
 tiary river gravels and most of the volcanics are displaced. South 
 from the area observed by Mr. Diller, however, Mr. Lindgren^* found 
 that the eastern slope of the range was formed before the eruption 
 of the andesitic lavas.
