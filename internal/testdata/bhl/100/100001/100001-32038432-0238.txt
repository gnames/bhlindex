222 GEOLOGY OF NEVADA SOUTH OF 40TH PARALLEL, [bull. 208. 

Since writing the above the writer has obtained tlie following addi- 
 tional information : 

On the east front of the Sierra, between Carson and Markleeville, 
 Mr. Lindgren has found evidence of recent faulting along the base of 
 the mountains. Near Genoa, Pleistocene alluvial deposits are dis- 
 placed some 40 feet by this fault. Another point is the behavior of 
 the Carson River, which, on emerging from the mountains, increases 
 its grade abruptly, suggesting comparatively recent dislocation of its 
 valley. Mr. Lindgren believes that the first dislocation along the 
 eastern face of the Sierra Nevada took place at the close of the Creta- 
 ceous and that movement has continued at intervals down to the 
 present day. The faulting was not simple, but complex. A number 
 of more or less parallel faults may be distinguished within a belt 25 
 miles wide.^'
