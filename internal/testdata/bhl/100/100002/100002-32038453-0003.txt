SUMMARY 

The fourth in a series of shellfish explorations in southeastern Alaska was 
 made during the late winter and the early spring of 1952. Fishing operations were 
 carried out between March 8 and April 28. A 20-foot beam trawl and various types 
 of shrimp traps were used throughout this exploration. 

Of the areas explored, the best shrimp catches were made in Glacier Bay. 
 Shrimp were taken in good quantities in most of the localities dragged and results 
 indicate this region would support a commercial shrimp fishery. The best catches, 
 up to 330 pounds per one-hour drag, were taken between South Marble Island and the 
 entrance of Muir Inlet. Other localities in Glacier Bay where catches exceeded 
 225 pounds per one-hour drag included Geikie Inlet, Queen Inlet, between Geikie 
 and Hugh Miller Inlets, and Muir Inlet. The bottom in Glacier Bay was found to be 
 generally free of obstructions; however, some difficulty was experienced from 
 "mudding down" in certain inlets. Although numerous icebergs were encountered in 
 certain parts of Glacier Bay, they at no time curtailed the fishing activities of 
 the John N. Cobb . 

Fair catches of shrimp were also taken in Affleck Cainal and Port Althorp. 
 Best catches in these areas were 142 and 172 pounds per one-hour drag, respectively. 
 Other regions explored yielded only small amoiuits of shrimp. Trap sets resulted 
 in poor catches of shrimp throughout the exploration. 

INTRODUCTION 

Since the spring of 1950, the U, S. Fish and Wildlife Service's exploratory 
 fishing vessel John N. Cobb has been engaged in a series of investigations to ex- 
 plore the shellfish potentialities of certain southeastern Alaskan waters. The 
 fourth exploration in this series was carried out during March and April 1952. The 
 main objective was to investigate the shrimp resources in areas which had not been 
 commercially fished for shrimp.
