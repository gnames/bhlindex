COMMERCIAL FISHERIES REVIEW 

The vessel left Seattle on March 3 and returned on May 3. Fishing operations 
 were conducted from March 8 to April 28. Areas explored for the first time bythe 
 John No Cobb included Lisianski Inlet, Llsianski Strait, Port Althorp, GlacierBay, 
 Kelp Bay, Tebenkof Bay, Affleck Canal, Davidson Inlet, Sea Otter Sound, and the 
 Point Baker area of Sxunner Strait. In addition, further work and testing of shrimp 
 traps was carried on in certain areas previously explored by the John N. Cobb 
 (Schaefers 1951, Ellson and Livingstone 1952), These areas were Peril Strait, 
 Tenakee Inlet, Sitka Sound, and Keku Strait (fig. 1). 

During the trip 96 drags were made with a beam trawl, and 365 individual 
 shrimp traps were set. The locations of drags and trap sets are shown in figures 
 7, 9, 12, and 15. Detailed information on the size, quantity, and commercial var-

Data concerning 

GEAR 

All drags were made with a 20-foot beam trawl. The net was constructed with 
 36-thread Ij-inch stretched-mesh cotton webbing, 150 meshes deep (for detailed 
 specifications of the beam trawl 

see Ellson and Livingstone 1952) . 
 The beam was a hemlock pole ap- 
 proximately 8 inches in diameter 
 and cut down to 6 inches at each 
 end to allow for attachment of 
 the "D" frames. In areas where 
 hemlock poles were not available, 
 a 6 X 6-inch milled fir beam was 
 used. 

Four types of shrimp traps 
 were fished experimentally: two- 
 and four-tunnel non-collapsible 
 iron traps, four-tunnel collap- 
 sible iron traps, and two-tunnel 
 non-collapsible wooden traps. 

four-tunnel non-collapsible-type shrimp trap. 

The four-tunnel non-collap- 
 sible trap (fig. 2) was also fished during the John N. Cobb's 1950 shellfish explor- 
 ations and was described by Schaefers (1951).
