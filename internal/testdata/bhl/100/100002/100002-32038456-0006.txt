FIG. 3 - THREE TYPES OF SHRIMP TRAPS USED DURING THIS 
 EXPLORATION. A - TWO- TUNNEL NON-COLLAPSIBLE TRAP. 
 B - FOUR-TUNNEL COLLAPSIBLE TRAP. C - TWO-TUNNEL 
 NON-COLLAPSIBLE WOODEN TRAP. 

The four-tunnel collapsible trap was cubic in shape with sides 24 inches 
 square (fig. 3). The top frame was J x l^-inch galvanized iron; the bottom frame 
 f X 1-inch galvanized iron; and the four vertical supports were 5/8-inch-diameter 

galvanized iron rods. Holes were 
 ... ' ' drilled through each comer of 

the top and bottom frame for in- 
 sertion of the rods. Hexagonal 
 nuts at the ends of each rod se- 
 cured them to the top and bottom 
 frame (fig. 4). The trap could 
 be collapsed by removing the 
 outside nuts and the vertical 
 rods. The lid frame was 3/8- 
 inch-diameter galvanized iron. 
 Three holes were drilled in one 
 side of the top frame and a 14- 
 gauge wire was passed through 
 these holes and wound around one 
 side of the lid frame to form 
 hinges. The lid was secured on 
 the other side with twine. The 
 tunnel entrances were formed by 3-inch-diameter galvanized iron rings, located 
 in the center of each vertical side. The tunnel indentations were formed by cross- 
 tying the opposing rings with seine twine. This procedure was also used in the 
 other types of traps. The frame and the timnels were covered with 15-thread 1^- 
 inch stretched-mesh cotton netting. 

The two-tunnel non-collapsible trap (fig. 5) was rectangular in shape, 24 
 inches long, 18 inches wide, and 16 inches high. The top frame was ^ x 1-inch 
 galvanized iron, and the bottom frame 3/8 x 
 1-inch galvanized iron. Fourj-inch-diameter 
 galvanized iron rods, welded at each end to 
 the corners of the top and bottom frame, 
 formedthe sides of the frame. The lid frame 
 was constructed of the same material and op- 
 erated inthe same manner as that of the four- 
 tunnel collapsible trap. The tunnel entrances 
 were formed by 3-inch-diameter galvanized 
 iron rings located in the center of each end. 
 The frame and the tunnels were covered with 
 15-thread l^-inch stretched-mesh cotton net- 
 ting. 

The wooden trap was rectangular in shape, 
 24 inches long, 18 inches wide, and 13 inches 
 high. The sides and bottom were covered with 
 strips of lath, spaced 3/8-inch apart and 
 nailed to 1-5/8 x 1-5/8-inch end frames. The 
 lid was also made of lath nailed to ^ x IJ 
 inch fir boards located near each end of the 
 trap. Strips of leather were used as hinges 
 for the lid. The tunnel entrances were formed 
 by 3-inch-diameter galvanized iron rings, 
 located in the center of each end. The tun- 
 nels were covered with 15-thread l^-inch fig. 4 - portion of four-tunnel collapsible 
 stretched-mesh cotton webbing. shrimp trap showing method of securing
