COMMERCIAL FISHERIES REVIEW 

Frozen herring was used as bait in all trap sets. The herring was cut into 
 pieces, placed in a net bait bag, and suspended from the tunnel crossties. A motor 
 launch was frequently used simultaneously with the John N. Cobb in setting and 
 hauling shrimp traps. The launch 
 had a capstan operated by means 
 of a power take-off fromthe launch's 
 engine (fig. 8), In areas inac-

RESULTS OF GEAR TESTS 

To obtain a comparison of the 
 effectiveness of the four types 
 of shrimp traps used, two sets 
 were made in Keku Strait (fig. 7) 
 where spot ( Pandalus platyceros ) 
 and coon-stripe ( Pandalus hypsino - 
 tus ) shrimp are fished commercial- 

^^' FIG. 5 - TWO-TUNNEL NON-COLLAPSIBLE SHRIMP TRAP WITH 

TOP OPEN AND BAIT IN PLACE. 

Eight traps, two of each type, 
 were fished off Pup Island and the same number were fished near the Keku Islands. 
 In each location the traps were set at the same depths and as close to each other 
 as practicable. All traps caught shrimp but no significant difference in amount 

was noted. The set off 
 Pup Island caught 23 pounds 
 of coon-stripe shrimp and 
 a trace of spot and pink 
 shrimp, while that off the 
 Keku Islands produced I82 
 pounds of spot and 2 pounds 
 of coon-stripe. Results 
 of trap sets during the 
 rest of the trip were gen- 
 erally poor. The four- 
 tunnel collapsible-tjrpe 
 iron trap suffered less 
 damage to the frames than 
 the other types because of 
 its heavy construction. 

FISHING RESULTS 

FIG. 6 - HAULING A SHRIMP TRAP ABOARD THE JOHN N. COBB. The findings reported 

in this paper apply to the 
 period March 8 to April 28, 
 1952. Since the gear used during this period was a 20- foot beam trawl, the catches 
 are smaller than probable with a commercial-size trawl, which normally has a 40- 
 or 50-foot beam. By far the best catches of shrimp were made in Glacier Bay, 

GLACIER BAY AREA 

Glacier Bay is 56 miles long and varies from 2 to 9 miles in width. It has 
 numerous inlets or arms, most of which were fished lay the John N. Cobb . Of the 
 49 drags made in Glacier Bay (fig. 10), 48 were made north of Strawberry Island.
