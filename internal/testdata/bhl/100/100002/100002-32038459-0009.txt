COMMERCIAL FISHERIES REVIEW 

The extensive area and the wide distribution of drags which produced good 
 catches indicate that Glacier Bay would suonort a commercial shrimp fishery. Catches 
 of shrimp in excess of 225 pounds per houri/ 
 were taken in Geikie Inlet, Queen Inlet, and 
 Mulr Inlet; between Geikie Inlet and Hugh 
 Killer Inlet; and between South Marble and 
 Sebree Islands. With the exception of rocky 
 bottom in the Drake Island and Willoughby 
 Island areas, the bottom dragged was predomi- 
 nately mud and adaptable for beam trawling. 
 However, difficulty was experienced from 
 "mudding down" in some localities. A strong 
 tidal condition exists from Willoughby Is- 
 land to the entrance, and the bottom is un- 
 favorable for dragging. 

Although icebergs were quite numerous 
 in Glacier Bay, they did not curtail fishery 
 operations. Ice covered the head of Geikie 
 Inlet , the narrow southeast arm of Charpen- 
 tier Inlet, and the upper reaches of Muir 
 and Adams Inlets. Navigation of Glacier Bay 
 should be undertaken with extreme caution 
 as it has not been completely surveyed above 
 the line from Francis Island to the western 
 entrance point of Muir Inlet, There are no 
 navigational aids within the Bay, and no 
 large-scale chart of the area is available. 

Good catches were made in all drags in 
 Geikie Inlet. Drags near the entrance of 
 the inlet encountered snags, but those made 
 approximately halfway between the entrance and the head encountered no difficulty 
 and averaged 26l pounds of shrimp per hour. The catch consisted of 89 percent pink 
 (Pandalus borealjs ).^ and 11 percent coon-stripe ,3/ Drags between Geikie Inlet 
 and Hugh Miller Inlet averaged 26? pounds per hour (66 percent pink and 34 percent 
 side-stripe, Pandalopsis dispar ) . The bottom dragged was generally favorable. 
 Suitable dragging grounds were not located in Hugh Miller Inlet.

The drags made in Queen Inlet averaged 167 pounds of mixed pink and side-stripe 
 shrimp per hour. A soft mud bottom caused the first drag to mud down after 8 min- 
 utes towing time. In an attempt to prevent this condition in future drags, the 
 chain was removed from the "D" frames and the sweep rope was wrapped with 3-inch- 
 circumference manila line. After this, drags No. 33 to 35 were towed 30 minutes 
 and less mud was encountered in the net. Mud picked up by the trawl was removed 
 by towing the gear behind the vessel before bringing the catch on board. 

Considerable difficulty from soft mud was also experienced in Rendu Inlet. 
 Drag No. 36 caught 70 pounds of pink shrimp in 10 minutes before mudding down. 
 When the net was taken aboard, a foul smell was detected and an estimated 5 per- 
 cent of the shrimp were dead. Only a trace of pink and side-stripe shrimp (nearly
