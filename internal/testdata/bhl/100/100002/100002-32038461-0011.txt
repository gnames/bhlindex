COMMERCIAL FISHERIES REVIEW 

all of which were dead) were caught by drags No. 40 in Rendu Inlet and No. 1+3 in 
 Muir Inlet. Other locations in both of these inlets produced catches of live 
 shrimp of good quality, 
 with two drags (No. 45 and 
 47) in Muir Inlet averaging 
 216 pounds of shrimp per 
 hour (41 percent pink and ^ 
 59 percent side-stripe) . 

The region from Bear- 
 track Cove to the entrance 
 of Muir Inlet proved to be 
 one of the best regions ex- 
 plored in Glacier Bay. This 
 area was predominately gray 
 mud bottom, for the most 
 partfree of obstructions, 
 and suitable for drags of 
 several hours duration. 
 With the exception of six 
 drags, catches were rela- 
 tively free of miscellane- 
 ous invertebrates, scrap 
 fish, and debris. Two of 

the best drags in this area (No. 54 and 60) averaged 313 pounds of shrimp per hour 
 (61 percent pink and 39 percent side-stripe). Six drags made from South Marble 
 Island to Sturgess Island in 80 to 96 fathoms averaged 207 pounds of shrimp per 
 hour (50 percent pink and 50 percent side-stripe).

CLEAN CATCH OF SHRIMP FROM GLACIER BAY ON THE DECK 

OF THE JOHN N. COBB. 

Catches in Lisianski 
 Inlet (fig. 12) were poor 
 with suitable dragging 
 bottom limited mainly to 
 mid-channel locations from 
 Soloma Point to the vicin- 
 ity of Miner Island. The 
 best catch, made near Pel- 
 ican City produced 70 pounds 
 of mixed pink and side- 
 stripe shrimp per hour. 
 The head of Lisianski In- 
 let was covered with ice. 

Negligible quantities 
 of shrimp were taken in 
 Stag Bay and Lisianski 
 Strait proper. A total of 
 118 shrimp traps set in 
 the Lisianski Inlet and 
 the Lisianski Strait area 
 yielded poor catches.
