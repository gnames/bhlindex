PORT ALTHORP 

Suitable dragging bottom in Port Althorp (fig. 12) was located in a small 
 area off Point Lucan to the opposite shore of Chichagof Island and in shallow wa- 
 ter near the head of the inlet. Only two drags produced a fair showing of shrimp 
 (drags No. 15 and 16). Shrimp traps set in the area caught only a fewpink shrimp. 

TENAKEE INLET, PERIL STRAIT, AND SITKA SOUND AREAS 

Some areas which had been explored by the John N. Cobb in the fall of 1950 
 (Schaefers 1951) were again fished during this cruise. These were Tenakee Inlet 
 (fig. 12) and portions of Peril 
 Strait and Sitka Sound (fig. 15). 
 Drags in Tenakee Inlet and Fish 
 Bay (Peril Strait) made inapprox- 
 imately the same locations as drags 
 in 1950, yielded generally smaller 
 catches than those of the previous 
 survey o However, drag No. 74 in 
 Tenakee Inlet produced 110 pounds 
 of coon-stripe shrimp, which was 
 several pounds greater than the 
 best catch made in Tenakee Inlet 
 in 1950. Catches from Deadman 
 Reach (Peril Strait) and Silver 
 Bay (Sitka Sound) were negligible, which correspond with the 1950 results, 

SMALL ICEBERG IN GLACIER BAY, ALASKA. 

Results of trap sets in the same localities of Tenakee Inlet as in 1950 
 yielded smaller catches than those of the previous cruise (table 1) . 

KELP BAY AND TEBENKOF BAY AREAS 

Suitable dragging bottom was limited in Kelp Bay (fig. 15) and Tebenkof Bay 
 (fig, 7). Drags and trap sets in these regions caught few shrimp. 

AFFLECK CANAL AREA 

Fishing was carried 
 on in Affleck Canal (fig. 7) 
 from near the head of the 
 canal to the entrance. The 
 bottom was predominately 
 green mud, and no gear was 
 damaged in this area. Catches 
 varied from 64 to 142 pounds 
 per hour. Three drags at 
 depths of 74 to 96 fathoms 
 averaged 80 pounds of pre- 
 dominately side-stripe 
 shrimp and one drag in 40 
 to 60 fathoms produced 142 
 pounds of predominately 
 pink shrimp. Most of the 
 drags contained large quan- 
 tities of bottom debris and 
 miscellaneous trash fish.
