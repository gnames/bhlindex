DAVIDSON INLET AND SEA OTTER SOUND 

Because of the limited amount of dragging bottom in Davidson Inlet (fig. 7), 
 only two drags were made, both of which produced insignificant quantities of shrimp.

No suitable dragging bottom was located off Heceta Island in Sea Otter Sound, and 
 the remainder of the area was not explored. Shrimp traps set in Davidson Inlet 
 and Sea Otter Sound had negligible results. 

POINT BAKER AREA OF SUMNER STRAIT 

Of the 19 shrimp traps set in the Point Baker area (fig. 7), H were lost. 
 The traps were set at depths of 24 to 80 fathoms near the edges of relatively 
 steep slopes, and those lost evidently were carried away by the swift current pre- 
 vailing in the area. The eight traps recovered yielded a total of 2% poiinds of 
 spot shrimp. 

MISCELLANEOUS CATCHES 

Marine life commonly found in beajn-trawl catches included the arrow-toothed 
 floimder ( Atheresthes stomias ) , eel pouts (Zoarcidae), flathead "sole" ( Hippoglos - 
 soides elassodon ) ) sculpins (Cottidae), sea poachers (Agonidae), and rockfish 
 (Scorpaenidae). Small whiting ( Theragra chalcogramma ) were common in most areas, 
 and tanner crab ( Chionoecetes bairdii ) were encountered frequently in Glacier Bay, 
 No commercial quantities of food fish were taken,
