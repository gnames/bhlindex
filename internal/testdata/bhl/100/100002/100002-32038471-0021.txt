ALASKA'S SHRIMP INDUSTRY 

By Norman B. Wigutoff* 

INTRODUCTIW 

One of the oldest operating fishery industries in Alaska is the shrimp fish- 
 ery. Started in the vicinity of Petersburg, Alaska, in 1915, it has continued to 
 be one of the most important "off-season" fisheries in the Territory. The primary 
 and most important fisheries of 
 Alaska — salmon and halibut — are 
 of extremely short duration and 
 occur in the summer months. But 
 the shrimp fishery could be ex- 
 ploited on a year-round basis ex- 
 cept for a short closed season 
 (established by Federal regula- 
 tions) in certain areas of South- 
 eastern Alaska from February 15 
 through April 30. 

SPECIES OF SHRIMP 

Although numerous species 
 of shrimp from Alaska have been 
 identified (Hynes 1930), these 
 five are of major importance in 
 the commercial shrimp fishery: 

1. Pink, Pandalus borealis . 

2. Side-stripe, Pandalopsis 

dispar . 

3. Humpy, Pandalus goniurus 

4. 

Spot or pravm, 
 platyceros . 

Pandalus 

5. Coon-stripe, Pandalus 
 hypsinotus .

 HAVE BEEN THE CENTER OF THE ALASKA SHRIMP FISHERY FOR 
 THE PAST 30 YEARS. 

Of these, the first three make up from 85 to 95 percent of the commercial 
 catch divided almost equally among them., The sizes of the pink and humpy vary from 
 about 60 to 150 whole shrimp per pound. Side-stripe range from 20 to 75 whole 
 shrimp per pound. The spot or prawn are the largest, averaging 8 to 10 whole shrimp 
 per pound. Coon-stripe rvin about 30 to 50 whole shrimp per pound, 

CATCH AND FISHING AREAS 

The average annual shrimp catch for 1940 through 1945 was around 900,000 
 pounds. From 1946 through 1951 Alaska shrimp fishermen made an average annual 
 catch of 2,146,000 pounds. The highest annual catch of shrimp in Alaska was 
 2.835.000 pounds in 1948.
