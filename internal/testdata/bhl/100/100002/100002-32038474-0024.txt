beam or timber. The trawl is set on the bottom and towed behind the vessel. 
 After an hoTir or two it is hauled up, the shrimp are brailed out and stored whole 
 on deck in wooden boxes holding from 150 to 200 pounds each. Because of prevail- 
 ing cool air temperatures and the fact that shrimp are landed daily, no ice is 
 used. The shrimp trawlers usually leave port in the very early hours of themorn- 
 ing and return to the processing plants with their catches in the late afternoon 
 or early evening. A complete and detailed description of the fishing vessels, 
 the beam trawl, and the fishing method, is given in a report on experimental and 
 exploratory shrimp fishing conducted in 1944 by the Alaska Fisheries Experimental 
 Commission (Carlson 1945). Ellson and Livingstone (1952) describe a smallertrawl 
 used in exploratory fishing operations. Collapsible shrimp traps were also used 
 in the explorations of the John N. Cobb , and are described in detail by Ellson 
 and Livingstone. 

PBOCESSING AND MARKETING PROCEDURES 

The method of processing the shrimp in the plants has been the same for a 
 number of years. As soon as a boat arrives at the plant, the boxes of shrimp are 
 unloaded from the deck of the fishing vessel. The whole shrimp are immediately 
 precooked, one boxful at a time, in a tank of fresh boiling water heated by direct

injection of live steam. The precook to simplify picking is as short as possible 
 and is judged sufficient when the shrimp rise to the surface and float. As the 
 whole shrimp rise to the surface, they are skimmed off with a short dip net and 
 put into small wooden trays with galvanized wire-mesh bottoms. Each tray holds 
 20 to 25 pounds. The trays are placed in cooling racks until the following morn- 
 ing, when they are moved into the picking room as needed. Women, many of them 
 Alaska natives, are mainly employed in the picking operation. The meats are picked 
 from the shells and again placed in the cooling trays. Pickers are paid by the 
 weight of meat picked. Because the fishermen are paid on the weight of the cooked 
 meats picked from their catch, each boat's catch is kept separate when processed. 
 The trays of picked meats are washed under cold potable fresh water sprayed by a 
 hose or faucet, and permitted to drain on the racks for a few minutes. 

After picking and washing, the meats have a bland flavor and need salt. The 
 industry practices two different methods for the further processing of the meats. 
 The most commonly used method is to cook the trays full of meats in a strong salt 
 solution (25°-30O salometer) for a very short period — from one to three minutes.
