This is also done in a vat or tank heated by direct injection or closed coils of 
 live steam. The other method is to first dip the trays of picked meats in a sat- 
 urated salt solution for about three 
 ,/ . minutes. After the dip, the trays 

of meats are allowed to drain. Then 
 the trays are placed in a steam re- 
 tort and cooked without pressure for 
 3 to 4 minutes. There is some slight 
 variation from plant to plant, and 
 even from day to day in the same 
 plant, in the cooking time and the 
 strength of brines used. After brin- 
 ing and cooking, the shrimp meats 
 are cooled in the trays on the racks 
 for several hours, or overnight. To 
 remove fragments of shell andantennae 
 or "feelers," the meats are then put 
 through a combination shaking and 
 blowing machine or a rotating drum 
 and blower, of which there are about 
 as many different designs as there 
 are processing plants. From the 
 mechanical cleaning machines, the 
 meats are taken to the packing roomo 
 Approximately 35 pounds of cooked 
 meats are obtained from 100 pounds 
 of raw whole shrimp.

For many years, until about 19A-0, the shrimp meats were packed dry, 5 pounds 
 to a one-gallon can, and shipped in ice by steamship to Seattle brokers, who dis- 
 tributed the perishable product as far east as the Rocky Mountain area. With tha 
 advance in the use of freezing in the last several years, the industry has now 
 changed almost completely to marketing its 
 products in the dry frozen state. Freezing 
 is accomplished at temperatures between 0° 
 and 10° F. Most Alaska freezers are the 
 shelf type. One operator, however, ships % 
 all his production fresh by air to Seattle. 
 The largest volume of shrimp meats is packed 
 in No. 10 double-seamed cans, 5 poxinds of 
 meats per can, for the hotel and restaurant 
 trade. In recent years , with the increased *^ 
 use of frozen products in the home, the 
 shrimp industry of Alaska has turned to one 
 pound and even smaller containers. Very 
 recently the "tuna" can (known in the can- 
 ning trade as a 307 x 113), has been adopted 
 for a consumer-size package containing four 
 ounces of shrimp meat sealed under vacuum. 
 Vacuum packing yields a product with a su- 
 perior storage life and minimizes the tough- 
 ening and loss of flavor of the shrimp dur- 
 ing long frozen-storage periods. Enamel- 
 lined cans are used. 

Some shrimp are marketed in other forms fig. 12 - packing and weighing no. io cans. 
 than as cooked picked meats. These are: each can contains five pounds of meats.
