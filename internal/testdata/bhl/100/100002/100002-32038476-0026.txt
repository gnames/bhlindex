TUNA AND SHRIMP SHRINKAGE E«JRING CANNING 

Canning experiments showed that the shrinkage of tuna meat during heat 
 processing depended little on the sterilizing value of the process used. 
 Shrimp, however, shrunk more with increasing the sterilizing value of the 
 process. The increase in shrinkage gradually fell off when the sterilizing 
 effect of the heat process approached the values which should be used com- 
 mercially. (Report of the Technological Laboratory of the Danish Ministry 
 of Fisheries, 1951.)
