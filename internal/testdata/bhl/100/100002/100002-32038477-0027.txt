FREEZING FISH AT SEA- -NEW ENGLAND 

Part 6 - Changes and Additions to Experimental 
 Equipment on the Trawler Delaware 

By C. G. P. Oldershaw* 

ABSTRACT 

THE COLD-STORAGE CAPACITY OF THE EXPERIMENTAL TRAWLER DELAWARE 
 WAS INCREASED, AND SEVERAL CHANGES AND ADDITIONS WERE MADE TO THE 
 EXPERIMENTAL FREEZING EQUIPMENT AND REFRIGERATION MACHINERY. 

INTBODUCTIWJ 

The freezing-fish-at-sea project currently in progress at the Boston Fishery 
 Technological Laboratory of the U, S, Fish and Wildlife Service's Branch of Com- 
 mercial Fisheries has these general objectives: (a) the development of handling, 
 freezing, and storage fa- 
 cilities which can be in- 
 stalled and used success- 
 fully on existing vessels 
 of the New England fleet, 
 and (b) the establishment 
 of the technological _ and 
 economic feasibility of 
 freezing fish "in the round" 
 at sea for later processing 
 ashore . 

The experimental e- 
 quipment installed by this 
 laboratory on the trawler 
 Delaware has been described

of experience gained dur- 
 ing the 1951 season, sev- 
 eral changes and additions 

were made to increase the efficiency of the operation. These changes and additions, 
 made during the vessel's 1951/52 winter lay-up period (and tested during the 1952 
 operating season) , are described herein. 

E(^IPMENT CHANGES AND ADDITIONS 

INCREASE IN COLD - STORAGE CAPACITY ; The cold-storage space for frozen fish 
 was increased by approximately 1,000 cubic feet with the addition of another insu- 
 lated bulkhead in the iced-fish storage space (see figure 1). Construction details 
 were similar to the forward bulkhead previously described (Butler, et al 1952). 
 Located two pen-sections forward of the existing forward bulkhead, the new bulkhead
