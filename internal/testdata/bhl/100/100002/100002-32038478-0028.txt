encloses a space approximately ten feet fore and aft, across the full width of 
 the vessel. Both bulkheads enclosing this space are fitted with refrigerator 
 doors to provide access from either the cold-storage space aft or the single re- 
 maining iced-fish storage pen, forward. A deck hatch, part of the ship's original 
 structure, provides access for unloading the frozen fish. 

The original fish hold (7 five-foot pen-sections in length) is now partitioned 
 as follows: one pen-section forwardmost for storing iced gutted fish; two pen- 
 sections insulated and refrigerated for storing round frozen fish; three pen-sec-

 brine-freezing apparatus; and one pen-section aftermost housing the refrigeration 
 machinery. 

The new forward frozen-fish storage space is refrigerated by 1,500 feet of 
 1^-inch iron-pipe coils mounted on deckhead, bulkheads, and skin. Wooden gratings 
 are laid on the floor to aid in the circulation of air under the piles of frozen 
 fish. 

The cooling coils of both frozen-fish storage spaces were arranged to provide 
 flexibility of control in maintaining the desired storage temperatures. The re- 
 frigerant, an aqueous solution of ethanol referred to herein as "antifreeze," is 
 pumped through the shell-and-tube cooler in the refrigeration machinery room 
 (Butler, et al 1952), circulated through the room c"boling coils, then returned to 
 the cooler. A rectamgular 40-gallon "antifreeze" supply and surge-tank, located
