above deck, is connected by a 3/4- inch line to the 2-inch return main. Four banks 
 of coils, one on each aide of the two refrigerated spaces, are supplied with the 
 chilled "antifreeze" through a 2-inch supply main by means of four conveniently 
 located distribution valves. Thus, the refrigeration supplied to either storage 
 sf>ace may be regulated. 

BRINE MAKE -UP TANK AND ACCESSORIES ; A brine make-up tank was constructed to 
 serve as a reservoir for maintaining the optimum brine level in the freezer ir- 
 respective of the amount of fish-loaded, and to serve as a make-up tank for pre- 
 paring brine of the desired concentration to overcome normal dilution of the 
 freezing medivim. Two possible sources of dilution of the freezing medium are the 
 gradual addition of sea water associated with the fish, and the slight uptake of 
 salt by the fish during the freezing process. 

A rectangular steel tank, 5 feet high by 4 feet long by 2^ feet wide, was 
 welded to the forward port side of the brine freezer to serve as the make-up and 
 reserve. The top is enclosed except for a small opening for charging the tank 
 with salt. The tank is fitted with an outlet and two nozzle inlets interconnected 
 through a 1/4-hp. rotary pump to the freezer tank and to an overboard discharge. 
 Valves are so arranged that the make-up solution can be recirculated in the make- 
 up tank via the nozzle inlets to promote dissolving of the salt; the solution can 
 be pumped from make-up tank to freezer (and vice versa), or it can be pumped over- 
 board from either tank. 

RELOCATION OF PUMPS ; The brine and "antifreeze" circulating pumps, original- 
 ly located adjacent to the freezer tank (see illustration in Part 3 of this series 
 by Butler, et al 1952) have been relocated on the port side of the refrigeration 
 machinery room. This change was made to provide more space and to reduce the re- 
 frigeration load in the cold-storage area, and to afford better access to the 
 pumps for maintenance. At the same time, the original ^-hp. "antifreeze" circu- 
 lating pximp was replaced by a 1^-hp, pump to give adequate circulation through the 
 enlarged cooling-coil system. To obviate the necessity of insulating the individ- 
 ual brine and "antifreeze" pipes and fittings, a cork-insulated partition, fitted 
 with a small access door, was constructed to separate the area where the pumps 
 and piping are located from the warm refrigeration machinery room. 

REFRIGERATION PLANT ; Additional controls and measuring instruments were in- 
 stalled and some modifications made to the absorption refrigeration machinery. 
 While it is recognized that simplicity and ruggedness are major requirements for 
 successful operation abosird a fishing vessel, the experimental nature of this in- 
 stallation enhances the need for accurate measurement and control; 

To provide greater flexibility of operation, the system by which liquid am- 
 monia was supplied to the shell-and-tube brine and "antifreeze" coolers has been 
 modified. Formerly the supply to both coolers was controlled by a single low- 
 pressure float control which, by means of equalizing lines joining the coolers, 
 maintained the aimmonia liquid level in both coolers simultaneously. The equalizing 
 lines were removed and in their place was installed a separate thermostatic liquid 
 feed control for the "antifreeze" cooler. Now either cooler can be operated whether 
 or not the other is in use. 

To guard against the possibility of freezing the brine in the tubes of the 
 brine cooler when the brine temperature is near its freezing point and no fish are 
 being frozen, an automatic evaporator pressure regulator was installed in the am- 
 monia vapor line leading from the top of the cooler to the absorber. This control 
 is actuated by the temperature of the brine leaving the cooler. When the brine is 
 cooled to a predetermined temperature, the valve closes and stops the cooling proc- 
 ess until the brine temperature rises again.
