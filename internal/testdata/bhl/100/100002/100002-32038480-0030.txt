The level of aqua-ammonia in the generator of the absorption refrigeration 
 machine (Butler, et al 1952) is indirectly affected by the rate of flow of cool- 
 ing water through the condenser. To maintain an optimxam level under varying re- 
 frigeration loads, an automatic flow regulator was therefore installed in the 
 cooling water system. 

Two 2-pen recording thermometers were installed in the refrigeration machin- 
 ery room. One reco-rds the air temperature in the forward and the aft frozen-fish 
 storage spaces, while the other records the temperature of the circulating brine 
 before and after it passes through the brine cooler. The latter temperature re- 
 corder, used in conjunction with an orifice-plate flowmeter in the brine-circu- 
 lating system, indicates the refrigeration output of the brine cooler. 

While still further improvements in equipment are contemplated, the changes 
 and additions described produced considerable improvement in the performance of 
 the experimental brine-freezing and cold-storage equipment aboard the Delaware .

TRADE SCHOOL F(» CANNING IN NORWAY 

A trade school for the canning industry was opened at Ledal, near 
 Stavanger, Norway, towards the latter part of August 1952, reported The 
 Fishing News , a British fishery periodical. It is claimed to be the only 
 school of its kind in the world and was built at an estimated cost of $US420,000. 

Courses at the school last 18 months and are designed to train workers 
 for positions as foremen, supervisors, and production planners. A nmnber 
 of offices and institutions relating to the canning industry moved into the 
 school. Since fish canning is an important part of the Norv/egian canning 
 industry, there no doubt will be training in fish canning operations.
