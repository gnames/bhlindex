REFRIGERATION : Preparation of a Manual on the Refrigeration of Fish : In 
 order to provide certain information to include in the manual, a survey was made 
 of refrigerated retail display cases in approximately 100 supermarkets from Vlash- 
 Ington, D. C, to Boston, Massachusetts. The follovri.ng observations were made: 
 (l) availability of frozen fishery products was generally adequate; (2) sales ef- 
 fort towards marketing frozen fish was quite variable; (3) holding temperatures 
 in frozen-food cabinets were generally higher thkn they should be to protect the 
 quality of the frozen fish. Work on the manual had been delayed due to the ill- 
 ness and subsequent death of the technologist assigned to the project. Another 
 technologist has been transferred from the Boston Technological laboratory to Col- 
 lege Park to continue the work. (College Park) 

Freezing Fish at Sea . Defrosting , Filleting , and Refreezing the Fillets ; 
 Vessel Operation : VESSEL: Specifications for bids were prepared for the annual 
 overhauling of and for certain alterations on the research trawler Delaware . Al- 
 terations on the Delaware will include the installation of a new ventilating sys- 
 tem in the freezing-machinery room and the installation of a new basket-type brine 
 freezer. The new brine freezer has been designed so that loading and unloading 
 operations can be carried out on deck. The new arrangement will also allow fuller 
 use of available frozen storage space. The capacity of the brine freezer has been 
 increased so as to permit continuous freezing of fish during normal fishing opera- 
 tions. 

LABORATORY: To obtain further information on salt penetration into fish, two 
 samples of rovmd scrod haddock were immersed in cold (5°F.) sodium-chloride brine 
 (25 percent) for 7 days, Weight losses in the two samples during the immersion 
 period were 5«3 percent and 6. A percent. The fish were extremely desiccated, the 
 surfaces were soft and rubbery, and the tail sections were flexible. The surface 
 areas and tail sections apparently were not frozen even at 5° F. due to the pene- 
 tration of salt from the cold brine into the meat of the fish. Cross-section 
 cuts of the fish revealed that the center area was frozen, but the outer area — 
 3/l6-inch from the surface — was unfrozen. This unfrozen area was highly discolored. 
 The samples were inedible due to saltiness and off-flavors. Further tests will be 
 made to determine the maximum time -scrod haddock can be held in cold brine before 
 excessive salt penetration occurs. Present recommended practices of removing the 
 fish from the brine immediately after they are frozen result in negligible pene- 
 tration of salt. (Boston) 

BYPRODUCTS : Vitamin Content and Nutritive Value of Fishery Byproducts : An- 
 alyses were made of samples of anchovy, sardine, and mackerel scrap, and whale- 
 loin meal for riboflavin, niacin, and vitamin B]_2 content. The results are as 
 follows :
