TECHNICAL NOTE NO. 25--AMINO-AaD 
 CONTENT OF SALMON ROE 

ABSTRACT 

THE "essential" AMINO-ACID CONTENT OF ROE FROM THE FIVE SPECIES 
 OF SALMON HAVE BEEN DETERMINED. ANALYSES OF EIGHT INDIVIDUAL ROE 
 FROM PINK SALMON OF SIMILAR AND MODERATE MATURITY SHOWED NO STATIS- 
 TICALLY SIGNIFICANT VARIATION IN AMINO-ACID CONTENT. THERE WAS AN 
 INDICATION THAT THE ESSENTIAL AMINO-ACID CONTENT OF KING SALMON ROE 
 SHOWED AN INCREASING TREND WITH MATURITY. THERE WAS NO APPARENT DIF- 
 FERENCE IN THE AMINO-ACID CONTENT OF ROE FROM THE FIVE SPECIES OF 
 SALMON WHICH WERE OF SIMILAR (mODERATE) MATURITY. THE AVERAGE AMINO- 
 ACID CONTENT OF MATURE ROE FROM THE FIVE SPECIES OF SALMON EXPRESSED 
 AS A PERCENTAGE OF PROTEIN WAS: ARGININE 7.3; HISTIDINE 2.6; ISOLEU- 
 CINE 7.4; LEUCINE 9.9; LYSINE 8.8; METHIONINE 3.0; PHENYLALANINE 4.8; 
 THREONINE 5.7; TRYPTOPHANE 0.9; AND VALINE 7.2. 

INTRODUCTKW 

Studies on the utilization of Alaska salmon-cannery waste have indicated that 
 sa,l^on eggs offer considerable promise for the development of valuable industrial 
 products (Jones, Carrigan, and Dassow 1948), besides serving as an excellent source 
 of feed for hatchery fish (Robinson, Palmer, and Burrows 1949). Little is known, 
 however, about the composition of the protein of salmon roe. Since most of the 
 present uses for salmon eggs depend on their high protein content, 23 to 29 per- 
 cent (Jones, Carrigan, and Dassow 1948), a study of the amino-acid content of this 
 material was considered desirable. 

The amino-acid content of salmon roe was studied by considering possible var- 
 iation in composition due to species, maturity, and individual variation. Prelim- 
 inary studies, using the microbiological assay technique, have been limited to de- 
 terminations of the "essential" amino acids (arginine, histidine, isoleucine, leu- 
 cine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophane, and valine). 

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES 

Source and Preparation of Samples ; The roe from king ( Oncorhynchus tschawyt - 
 scha ) , chum (O. keta ) , red (O. nerka ) , coho (O. kisutch ) , and pink (O. gorbuscha ) 
 salmon, of varying degrees of sexual maturity, were obtained in a random mariner 
 from local sources. The skeins were sorted as to relative maturity, sealed in cans, 
 and frozen at -20° F. The frozen samples were stored at 0° F. until needed for 
 analysis. 

Crude protein samples were prepared as follows: The eggs were thawed then 
 blended with acetone in an electric blender. The samples were covered with addi- 
 tional acetone and permitted to stand overnight. They were then subjected to con- 
 tinuous Soxhlet extraction with acetone for 20 hours. The residue was dried in a 
 vacuum oven (29 inches of mercury vacuum) at 40° C. for one hour, and finely ground. 
 The dry and fat-free samples were stored in airtight containers. 

The degree of development or maturity of the salmon eggs was estimated bymeans 
 of the arbitrary scale suggested by Davidson and Shostrom (1936). The scale con^ 
 sists of arbitrary values ranging from 1 to 4 in relation to the size and condition 
 of the eggs as they are found either in ovaries or loose in the body cavity of the 
 salmon. Eggs that were found to be Small and compact in the ovaries were given a 
 classification of 1, Those that were greatly increased in size and had been shed 
 from the ovaries into the body cavity were given a classification of 4» Those 
 found in intermediate stages of development were graded 2 or 3.
