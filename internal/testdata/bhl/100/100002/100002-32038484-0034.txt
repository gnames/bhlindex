Assay Method ; The microbiological procedure and media of Henderson and Snell 
 (1948) were used. This method employs various lactic acid-producing bacteria with 
 a single uniform medium. Acid production was measured by electrometric titration. 
 Streptococcus faecalis R (American Type Cultxire Collection #8043) was the assay 
 organism used for arginine, leucine, methionine, threonine, and valine ; Leuconostoc 
 mesenteroides (A.T.C.C. #8042) was used for histidine, isoleucine, lysine, and 
 phenylalanine; and Lactobacillus plant arum (A.T.C.C. #8014) was used for trypto- 
 phane. Protein-acid hydrolysates were prepared by autoclaving 0.5 gm. of the 
 dried protein in sealed pyrex tubes with 20 ml, of 3 N hydrochloric acid for 5 
 hours at 15 povinds pressure. Alkaline hydrolysates for tryptophane assays were 
 prepared by autoclaving 0.5 gm. of the dried protein with 10 ml. of 5 N sodium 
 hydroxide for 10 hours at 15 pounds pressure in covered, stainless steel beakers. 
 Complete racemization of the tryptophane was assumed. The alkaline hydrolysates 
 were acidified with excess acetic acid and extracted twice with equal volumes of 
 ethyl ether (Neilands, Sirny, Sohljell, Strong, and Elvehjem 1949). Nitrogen de- 
 terminations were carried out on triplicate aliquots of the protein-acid hydro- 
 lysates by the micro Kjeldahl method of Ma and Zuazaga (1942). 

RESULTS 

The first phase was. a determination of the variability of the amino-acid con- 
 tent of egg samples from salmon of identical species and of similar physical char- 
 acteristics. Eight individual skeins of eggs of moderate maturity (Classification 
 3) were selected from eight pink salmon and assayed separately. In each case the 
 whole skein was utilized, including the skein membrane and adhering slime layer.

statistically significant variation, (Recovery experiments, in which amino-acid 
 standards were added to protein hydrolysates, averaged from 96 to 107 percent of 
 the theoretical amoxint.) 

The second phase was a determination of the essential amino-acid content of 
 egg samples from salmon of identical species but of varying sexual maturity. Pro- 
 tein samples were prepared from the eggs of king salmon corresponding to the dif- 
 ferent arbitrary levels of sexual maturity described previously. For each protein 
 sample, 25-gm. portions were cut vertically from the midsections of 6 individual 
 skeins, combined, and homogenized with acetone. The proportional parts of the roe 
 (egg casings, sac contents, and skein membrane when present) were not considered, 
 since the relative amounts vary with maturity. An effective separation of these 
 components is impossible in some cases and any error thus introduced is probably 
 of small magnitude. A protein hydrolysate was prepared from a representative sam- 
 ple of each homogenate and assayed for the essential amino acids.
