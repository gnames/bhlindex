cases, the values for immature eggs (Classification l) were 30 percent lower than 
 the mean for all values of this species. 

A comparison of the values obtained for these materials with values reported 
 by Deas and Tarr (1949) for "white spring salmon roe" shows that, with the excep- 
 tion of lysine, the distribution was somewhat similar. The value of 1.8 gm. of 
 lysine per 100 gm, of protein reported for "white spring salmon roe" is unusually 
 low for an animal protein. 

For a comparison of the essential amino-acid content of salmon egg samples 
 from the different species, protein samples from moderately mature eggs. (Classifi- 
 cation 3) from the five species of salmon were analyzed. The results (table 3)

indicate no apparent difference in the essential amino-acid content of the eggs 
 obtained from the five species of salmon of moderate and similar maturity. 

A detailed evaluation of the data reported in this paper will not be attempted. 
 Corresponding cimino-acid values for animal liver, a feed commonly used for hatchery 
 fish, are presented for comparison (table 3). Any conclusions as to the quality 
 of salmon-egg protein (based on amino-acid content) as compared with animal liver, 
 for example, are not warranted, since the amino-acid requirements of hatchery fish 
 have not been established. Further studies on the variability of the ami no-acid 
 content of salmon egg protein from the different species of salmon of varying sex- 
 ual maturity are being carried out, and will be reported in more detail at a later 
 date.
