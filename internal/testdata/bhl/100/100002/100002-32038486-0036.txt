MAYONNAISE WITH FISH-PBOTEIN STABILIZER WITHSTANDS HEAT PBOCESSING 

By substituting egg yolk with a fish-protein stabilizer (manufactured 
 by a firm in Hamburg, Germany), it is possible to make mayonnaise which 
 withstands heat processes normally used for canned foods. The experiments 
 were made with shrimp packed in mayonnaise. (Report of the Technological 
 Laboratory of the Danish Ministry of Fisheries, 1951.)
