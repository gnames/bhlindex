COMERCIAL FISHERIES REVIEW 

Vol. 15, No. 3 

An average price of 53.9 cents per pound was paid for fishery products pur- 
 chased in January 1953, and 46.8 cents in January 1952. This is an increase of 
 15.2 percent, a good indication that there were purchases of higher-priced fish- 
 ery products this year. 

Metal Cans--Shipments for Fishery Products, 1951-52 

Shipments of metal cans for fishery products during the 12 
 months of 1952 totaled 107,856 short tons of steel as compared 
 with 105,704 short tons of steel during the year 1951, accord- 
 ing to a February 18 report issued by the Bureau of the Census. 
 note: statistics cover all commercial and captive plants known to be 
 producing metal cans. reported in base boxes of steel consumed in the 
 manufacture of cans, the data for fishery products are converted to 
 tons of steel by using the factor: 23.0 base boxes of steel equal one 
 short ton of steel. 

Michigan's Great Lakes Catch of Larger Species Declining 

Michigan's catch of the larger fresh-water fish species (lake trout and white- 
 fish) in the Great Lakes has been declining in recent years, while the catch of 
 smaller species (smelt, herring, and chubs) has been increasing. The principal 
 reason for this trend is the sea lamprey which has nearly wiped out lake trout pop- 
 ulations in all the Great Lakes except Lake Superior. Recent reports indicate the 
 sea lamprey is on the increase in Lake Superior also, states the Mchigan Depart- 
 ment of Conservation in a recent news bulletin. 

The total volume of the catch in the Great Lakes has changed only slightly in 
 recent years, but the value has dropped as the larger and more valuable species 
 are being replaced by the smaller and less valuable species. This means reduced 
 income to the fishermen. 

New Bottom-Fishing Area Discovered Off California Coast 

A new bottom-fishing area has been discovered recently off the California 
 Coast by a research team of commercial fishermen and the California Department of 
 Fish and Game. The new grounds (about 600 square miles I40 to 350 fathoms deep) 
 lie 25 to 30 miles off the coast from Morro Bay and Avila. The potential of this 
 bottom fishery is estimated at $3 mil]J.on annually, reports the California Depart- 
 ment of Fish and Game in a February 11 news release. 

Two vessels, the Alamo and Empire II, were used in the three-day survey 
 which produced the find. A State biologist reported "mature and heavy Dover soles 
 were found in quantity and plenty of rockfish were taken, indicating that summer 
 trawling might be as rewarding as that off Eureka."
