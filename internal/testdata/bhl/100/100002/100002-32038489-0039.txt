March 1953 COMMERCIAL FISHERIES REVIEW 37 

The research cruise was completed early in February. The two boats used spe- 
 cial deep-trawling gear and tested Santa Lucia Bank and its shoreside trough. Ob- 
 jectives were to check potential fishery resources and determine if commercial 
 trawling grounds existed in these deep waters. 

The commercial captains, both Eureka fishermen, volunteered their vessels 
 for the research cruise, and the Department's Marine Fisheries Branch assigned a 
 biologist and supplied nets for the experimental deep-water drags.

" JOHN N. COBB " TO EXPLORE COMMERCIAL SHELLFISH RESOURCES IN SOUTHEASTERN A- 
 LASKA ( Cruise No . I5T: The commercial possibilities of shellfish resources in 
 Southeastern Alaska again will be explored by the Service's exploratory fishing 
 vessel John N. Cobb on a cruise that began at Seattle, Wash., on March 2. Par- 
 ticular emphasis will be placed on finding areas containing shrimp in commercial 
 quantities. This will be the fifth in a series of similar exploratory cruises. 

The vessel will commence explorations in Yakutat Bay, fishing both inside and 
 ocean waters in the region, and then will fish certain bays in the Cross Sound area, 
 and off the west coast of Chichagof Island, particularly in the Khaz Bay area. 
 Beam trawls and shrimp traps will be used. Bottom characteristics will be deter- 
 mined by use of a recording depth-finder, and water temperatures and bottom samples 
 will be obtained at each fishing station.

" CHARLES H. GILBERT " FINDS MANY SMALL SCHOOLS OF TUNA WEST OF HAWAII ( Cruise 
 No . 2.)' A surprisingly large number of small schools of skipjack and yellowfin 
 tuna were found in the area west of Hawaii and Lanai Islands as far as I50 miles 
 offshore by the Service's Pacific Oceanic Fishery Investigations research vessel 
 Charles H. Gilbert on a cruise completed on February 14. This was the third tuna- 
 survey by this vessel for signs of skipjack schools in waters north and south of 
 the Hawaiian Islands to a distance of I50 miles. 

Preliminary tests on the use of chemical fish attractants in place of live 
 bait were also carried out. It is planned to further explore the use of the tuna 
 attractant developed at Coconut Island by Dr. Albert Tester of the University of 
 Hawaii. If the fish extract can be successfully applied at sea to take the place 
 of live bait in "chvmmiing" for skipjack, it will have wide application here and off 
 the west coast of the United States as well. Several tuna were captured alive and 
 put in the ponds at the University of Hawaii Marine Laboratory at Coconut Island 
 for ftirther testing with the chemical attractant. 

In addition, a wide variety of biological specimens were obtained including 
 the uncommon snake mackerel made famous in the accounts of Kon Tiki expedition. 
 Several bands of humpback whales were observed off Molokai and the Kona coast of 
 Hawaii. 

These survey cruises will continue intermittently during the winter and increase 
 later in the spring when the skipjack normally appear in abundance around the Is-
