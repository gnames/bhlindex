lands. These surveys carried out as part of a joint program vrith the Territory- 
 Fish and Game Division are designed to study the possibility for an expansion of 
 the tuna fisheries around the Hawaiian Islands. The scientists of both depart- 
 ments are determined to discover where the skipjack go in the winter and whether 
 or not the fishery can be extended over a larger portion of the year than at the 
 present time.

" HUGH M. SMITH " ( Cruise No. 12) MD SAMPAN " TRADEWIND " FISH TUNA IN LINE IS- 
 LANDS AREA ; A one-month commercial tuna-fishing trip to the Line Islands area 
 was completed February 12 by the Hawaiian sampan Tradewind and the Service's 
 Pacific Oceanic Fishery Investigations research vessel Hugh M. Smith . Both ves- 
 sels caught 22 tons of yellowfin tuna and 2 tons of market fish. 

The Tradewind fished for tuna with live bait. Its Captain reports that 
 bait (mostly mullet, Mugil longimanus ) of suitable size for yellowfin fishing 
 was scarce at Palmyra Island, but easily obtained at Christmas and Fanning islands. 
 Surface schools of yellowfin tima were small and scattered; no large concentra- 
 tions were encountered, although more schools were observed in the Palmyra area 
 than at the other islands. About half of the 14 tons of yellowfin tuna was 
 caught off Palmyra Island and half off Fanning Island. The two tons of market 
 fish, mostly papio ( Caranx sp.), were taken at Christmas Island. 

The Hugh M. Smith on this cruise carried out a program of experimental long- 
 line fishing, surveyed the oceanic conditions surroiinding the islands, and in- 
 cidentally supplied fuel and ice to the Tradewind . lilhile the live-bait fishing 
 of the sampan was not outstanding, the experimental long-line fishing by the 
 Hugh M. Smith showed yellowfin tuna catches as high as 14 and 19 fish per hun- 
 dred hooks. This indicated a high abundance of subsurface yellowfin tuna in the 
 waters close to the islands. The total catch of 8 tons of yellowfin tuna (in- 
 cluding shark-eaten fish) by the Hugh M. Smith were delivered to Kauai for can- 
 ning. The main purpose of the research vessel's cruise was to learn something 
 about the distribution of tuna about the islands instead of trying. to catch the 
 maximum amount of fish.
