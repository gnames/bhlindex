When compared with the record-production year of 1951, shrimp production in 
 1952 dropped almost 3 percent, attributed mainly to a decline in Louisiana land- 
 ings (table 2). But shrimp production in 1952 was almost 6 percent greater than 
 in 1950. 

Shrimp Vessel Operators Advised by 

Texas Banks of Possible Loan Action 

Certain banks in Texas, holding mortgages or notes against shrimp vessels, 
 have advised vessel owners that their loans or notes will be declared in default 
 if the vessels are seized by Mexican authorities within 10 miles of the Mexican 
 coast, except in case of emergency. This information was received by the Serv- 
 ice's New Orleans Market News Service office. The following is an excerpt from 
 the notification forwarded to owners of shrimp vessels who have loans from these 
 Texas banks: 

"You are hereby advised that you or your crew members are forbidden to take 
 this boat, which is mortgaged to our bank, closer than ten (lO) miles to anypart 
 of the Mexican coast at any time (except in case of emergency for repairs or due 
 to bad weather). Should you or any of your crew members violate this stipulation 
 and take the boat in closer to the Mexican shore than this ten-(lO) mile limit, 
 our bank shall then declare our note in default and shall demand from you payment 
 in full of your note to us." 

Wholesale and Retail Prices 

WHOLESALE PRICES, JANUARY 1953 : A seasonal decline in production was re- 
 sponsible for increases in the wholesale prices for edible fishery products from 

December 1952 to January 1953 • 
 But compared to the previous 
 year, prices were somewhat 
 lower. The edible fish and 
 shellfish (fresh, frozen, and 
 canned) wholesale index for 
 January 1953 was 110. 5 percent 
 of the 1947-49 average (see 
 table) — 5.6 percent higher 
 than in December 1952, but 3-5 
 percent below January 1952, 
 the Bureau of Labor Statis- 
 tics of the Department of La- 
 bor reports. 

For the drawn, dressed, 
 or whole finfish subgroup i- 
 tems, average wholesale prices in January increased 8.2 percent over the previous 
 month, but were 13.9 percent under a year earlier. Western halibut at New York 
 City was the only item under this subgroup which dropped in price from December 
 to January. Whitefish at Chicago jumped 71.7 percent as supplies became short, 
 and the ex-vessel price for large offshore haddock at Boston rose 16.2 percent. 

Fresh processed fish and shellfish prices were 7.5 percent higher than in 
 December and 11.9 percent higher than in January 1952. Fresh haddock fillet prices
