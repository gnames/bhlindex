 Fresh shrimp prices increased 10.7 percent from December to January and were 50.5 
 percent higher than a year ago. Shorter supplies and an exceptionally good de- 
 mand have kept shrimp prices at a very high level for the past number of months. 
 Shucked oysters declined slightly in line with the usual seasonal trend.

able) during week beginning JANUARY 12. 

Higher frozen shrimp prices (8.3 percent over December) were entirely respon- 
 sible for the 2.4 percent increase in the processed frozen fish and shellfish 
 prices from December to January and for the fact that the average prices for this 
 subgroup were 2.8 percent higher than a year earlier. Frozen haddock fillets 
 dropped 6.6 percent in January, while fillets of flounder and ocean perch remain- 
 ed unchanged. Heavy stocks of frozen groundfish fillets adversely affected the 
 market for frozen haddock fillets. On the other hand, unusually low inventories 
 have kept frozen shrimp prices at very high levels during recent months. Janu- 
 ary prices for all frozen fillets were substantially lower than a year ago. 

Canned fishery products average prices rose 3.2 percent from December to Jan- 
 uary. The largest increase was for Maine sardines — 13.5 percent. Pink salmon, 
 the only other canned item to increase, rose 5.3 percent. Canned tuna sold at De- 
 cember prices, while California sardines sold 1.1 percent lower. January 1953 
 canned fish prices were 1.3 percent lower than in the same month in 1952 due main- 
 ly to substantially lower quotations for Maine sardines and slightly lower prices 
 for canned pink salmon.
