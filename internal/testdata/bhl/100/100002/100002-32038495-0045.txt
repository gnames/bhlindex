Of the 427 fishing vessels available at the end of 1951, 389 were manned with 
 1,862 men. Of this total, 1,457 were seamen (fishermen) and 405 were engineers or 
 other specialists. This is an increase of 20 seamen and 2 specialists over 1950. 
 The number of boy entrants (apprentices) is far lower than what the fleet could 
 absorb, and might possibly lead to a lack of replacement for older fishermen* Ac- 
 cording to a 1931 law, each fishing vessel with a crew of 3 to 8 adults must have 

1 boy in service, while each vessel with a crew of more than 8 adults must carry 

2 boys. Thus, on December 31, 1951, the fleet should have had a total of 387 boys 
 wfiereas it only had I38, a 64 percent deficit. 

The port of Ostende had the largest fishing fleet in 1951 â€” a total of 205 
 vessels, including all 9 class VI trawlers and 9 of the 10 class V trawlers. Zee- 
 brugge was next in importance with I56 vessels , followed by Nieuport with 58 vessels, 
 and Blankenberge with 8 vessels.

FISH FROZEN AT SEA TESTED FOR TASTE : Freezing-fish-at-sea experiments, mainly 
 to determine the comparative taste appeal of certain British Columbia species under 
 various conditions of storage, have been carried out by the Pacific Experimental 
 Station of the Canadian Department of Fisheries at Vancouver, B. C. A tasting panel 
 of 200 Vancouver citizens helped to evaluate the results of the investigations. They 
 compared fish which had been (1) packed only in crushed ice for different periods 
 up to 12 days after catch, (2) frozen within a few hours after being caught and then 
 stored frozen for varying periods, and (3) held in ice up to eight day^ before freez- 
 ing and storage. Various other holding and freezing conditions were also compared, 
 reports the December 1952 Trade News, issued by the Department of Fisheries.
