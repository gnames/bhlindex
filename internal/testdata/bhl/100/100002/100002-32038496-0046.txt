Advances in commercial freezing and cold-storage techniques now make it quite 
 practical to maintain high quality in frozen fish, providing that the quality of 
 the fish is excellent when 
 freezing takes place. Dur- 
 ing the past year tests were 
 continued on fish landed from 
 the Tauranga , a commercial 
 trawler operating out of Van- 
 couver, equipped with mechani- 
 cal refrigeration facilities 
 made available by the Canadi- 
 an Fisheries Research Board. 

Observations made in the 
 latest series of tests dealt 
 with halibut and other flat 

fish, specifically brill and rock sole. The Tauranga ' s catches were of very hi^ 
 quality, due in part to the refrigerating equipment aboard but also to the short 
 runs to the fishing grounds; the Tauranga landed its fish on the average of 3 to 5 
 days after catch. Much of that marketed as fresh was delivered to the consumer 
 market 7 to 10 days after catch. Unfrozen fish on the Tauranga was packed in re- 
 frigerated ice and stored at temperatures in the refrigerated hold slightly above 
 the freezing point of fresh fish, which is about 30° F. 

Halibut Tests : In three recent tests halibut was sometimes frozen on board 
 and sometimes only packed in refrigerated ice aboard for later freezing ashore. 
 Both kinds were held frozen for varying periods at the Station. About 42 percent 
 of the members of the tasting panel expressed a preference for the halibut landed 
 in ice and later frozen and stored; about 31 percent preferred the halibut frozen 
 at sea and kept frozen ashore; and about 27 percent had no preference (see table). 
 The percentages of preference and no preference were remarkably consistent in the 
 three similar tests. 

In earlier tests it was shown that when iced halibut was held on ice at 32° F. 
 for storage periods of up to 18 days, preference for frozen halibut increased sharp- 
 ly. This indicated that most of the tasters preferred halibut frozen at sea. The 
 halibut frozen at sea appears to be firmer in texture and to have less moisture than 
 the fish which has been on ice. 

Fiat-Fish Tests : For flat fish, such as brill and rock sole, 45 percent of 
 the tasters preferred the frozen-at-sea; 35 percent preferred those fish iced at 
 sea and frozen later; the remainder had no preference. The tasters showed a prefer- 
 ence for flat fish dressed before storage on board to flat fish dressed after land- 
 ing, though differences were not great. For example, in one test 37.2 percent pre- 
 ferred dress ed-at-sea; 28.1 percent dress ed-after-landing; 34.7 percent detected 
 no difference. The usual commercial procedure is to rinse the ungutted flat fish 
 with sea water, then pack whole on ice and store in the hold until landing. 

Tuna Tests ; Conmon practice aboard the tuna vessels is to chill the fish and 
 freeze it without dressing, etc. On an albacore tuna fishing trip, fishermen a- 
 board the Tauranga removed the gills and viscera Immediately after catching; the 
 fish were then chilled, packed in refrigerated ice, and frozen by contact with the 
 aluminum walls of the refrigerating jacket. Upon landing, the tuna was stored in 
 the frozen state until processed. 

Tuna is most familiar to consumers as a canned product. For this reason it 
 was desirable to offer the panel tasters a product already processed. By way of
