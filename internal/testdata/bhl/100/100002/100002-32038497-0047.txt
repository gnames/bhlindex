comparison a can of good quality, unlabelled, coimnercially-canned albacore tuna 
 was sent to the tasters vri.th a can of tuna from the Tauran^a catch. The "conmer- 
 cial" tuna vras cauglit in the same general area as the Tauran^a tuna; both boats 
 are refrigerated, the times of catch were within the same fortniglit, and both packs 
 were canned locally. The only difference in treatment was that the Tauranga tuna 
 were dressed before chilling and freezing wtiereas the "commercial" tuna were dress- 
 ed after landing at Vancouver. 

The results to date (from 158 persons participating in the panel of 245 per- 
 sons) are: 54 percent preferred the Tauran°:a pack, 33 percent preferred the "com- 
 mercial" pack, and 13 percent indicated no preference. 

Further tests on canned albacore tuna are to be made after varying periods of 
 storage of the raw or unprocessed fish»

UNDERWATER TELEVISION TESTED OFF BRITISH COLUMBIA ; The first Canadian under- 
 water television tests in salt water were carried out off British Columbia in the 
 vicinity of Nanaimo on November 4 and 5, 1952, from the Canadian research vessel 
 Investigator I. The tests were made to familiarize the staff of the Pacific Bio- 
 logical Station of the 
 Fisheries Research Board 
 of Canada with the possi- 
 bilities of the equipment 
 in fisheries research. 
 Previous tests had been 
 made in fresh waters of 
 the Ottawa River and Lake 
 Ontario in 1951, and in 
 Lake Minnewanka in 1952, 
 according to the November 
 1952 Trade News of the Ca- 
 nadian Department of Fish- 
 eries. 

The Canadian equip- 
 ment was devised by W. F, 
 Torrlngton and his assist- 
 ants, VI. E. M. Dale and 
 T. R. Smith, of the Nation- 
 al Research Council of Ca- 
 nada . 

SKETCH OF CAMERA BEING LOWERED INTO THE WATER. 

The television camera 
 is enclosed in a steel 
 watertight cylinder and 
 weighs about 300 pounds out of water. The cylinder is 3 feet long and 18 inches in 
 diameter. In addition to the camera, it contains 3 electric motors and a 50-pound 
 lead weight which serves partly to offset the buoyancy and partly, by shifting its 
 position forward or backward, to incline the nose of the cylinder up or down. Two 
 propellers fitted to the stern are driven by electric motors and are capable of 
 moving the cylinder for/jard or backward, or of swinging it from side to side. A 
 battery of four spotlights is mounted on the front of the casing and provides ad- 
 equate illumination. Weights suspended by a length of chain beneath the unit cause 
 it to sink until the weights touch bottom, whereupon the unit regains its buoyancy 
 and remains at a distance from the bottom, governed by the length of chain.
