The imaj-es picked up by the sensitive tube in the camera are transmitted to 
 the television screens on the boat through a coaxial cable. In addition there is 
 a one-inch cable, lined with wooden floats to help buoy it up and reduce drag on 
 the cylinder to a minimum. This cable contains all the conductors providing power 
 for the camera, lights, and propulsion motors. The present cable is about 600 feet 
 long and weighs about 400 pounds. 

All operations of the camera are governed by remote control. Movements of the 
 camera are directed from a small unit . The master control unit regulates the quali- 
 ty of the image on the screen and the other electronic functions, yet also enables 
 the operator to focus the camera and change the lens openings. The lens can even 
 be changed from the normal 2 inches to 5 inches for close-ups. 

There are two viewing units. One provides for continuous undervjater obser- 
 vation, while an auxiliary unit is fitted ivith a special movie camera. This can 
 make a permanent record of objects of interest, without interfering with ordinary 
 observations.

 of sea fish were 10 percent 
 lower than the previous year. 
 Tie-ups particularly hampered British Colombia herring and salmon fisheries. 

Although cod landings were large off the Maritime Provinces, they were not 
 sufficient to offset the greatly reduced Newfoundland catch. Only one whaling firm 
 operated in Newfoundland last year, whereas in 1951 there were 3o Seal-oil produc- 
 tion likewise decreased due to a limited market and low returns to producers.

REVIEW OF^ THE FISHERIES . 1951 : Landings and Value: The total catch of fish 
 and shellfish in Denmark in 1951 amounted to approximately 278,300 metric tons, 
 valued at about 177,100,000 kroner (US $25, 600,000) to the fishermen (see table), 
 according to Fiskeri-Beretning for the Year 1951 . a Danish Goverrment publication. 
 This includes 15,000 metric tons, valued at 7,000,000 kroner (US $1,000,000), landed 
 by Swedish vessels in Danish ports, and it was mostly herring. 

The total catch of edible fish and shellfish increased about 1,600 metric tons 
 over 1950, while the catch of fish for reduction increased about 46,000 metric tons
