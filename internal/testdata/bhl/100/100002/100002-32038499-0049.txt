and the mussel catch declined about 8,500 metric tons. About 11,700,000 kroner 
 (US$1,700,000) of the increased value can be attributed to edible fish and shell- 
 fish, mainly due to a slight rise in the price of plaice, dab, cod, and mackerel. 
 The remaining 8,200,000 kroner (US$1,200,000) increase mainly derived from the in- 
 creased catch of waste fish for reduction.

The total value of the fishing vessels was estimated at 143,600,000 kroner 
 (US$20,800,000). The value of fishing gear was about 44,600,000 kroner (US$6,400, 000).

 3,000,000 kroner (US$433,000) in 1951. 

The total number of fishermen regularly or occasionally employed was 19,623 in 
 1951 as compared with 19,882 in 1950. The number of regular fishermen decreased 
 from 14,260 to 14,078.
