Catch of Principal Species : The plaice fisheries jdelded about the same as 
 in 1950, but the catch showed a considerable increase in the Skagerak, the Kattegat 
 and the Belt Sea, and a corresponding drop in the North Sea. 

The total yield in 1951 from the herring fisheries was about 2,000 metric tons 
 less than in 1950. The yield from the herring fisheries in the North Sea was al- 
 most double that of 1950, while the Baltic and the Belt Sea showed only a small 
 increase. On the other hand the catch in the Skagerak declined about 4» 000 metric 
 tons as compared with 1950; likewise the catch in the Kattegat declined but con- 
 siderably less than that of the Skagerak. 

Cod, the most important edible fish in volume, increased 3,000 metric tons. 
 Fishingwas carried on mainlyinthe Belt Sea and the Baltic , which together yielded 
 aliTiOst 50 percent of the total catch of cod. 

The 1951 mackerel catch was almost equal to that of 1950. About 85 percent 
 of the mackerel was caught in the Kattegat and Skagerak— 60 and 40 percent, respec- 
 tively. 

The drop in the catch of mussels is due to the almost complete suspension of 
 this fishery in the Kattegat and the Belt Sea. 

Fishing Areas : The catch from the fiords of Western Jutland, the Lime Fiord, 
 and the more remote waters declined slightly in 1951, while catches in all the 
 other waters increased. 

DANISH BEACH LANDING CRAFT. FAO EXPERTS HAVE STUDIED THESE BOATS TO SEE WHETHER THEY COULD 
 BE INTRODUCED IN OTHER COUNTRIES. 

About 50 vessels were fishing in the Barents Sea in 1951 as compared with 
 about 100 in 1950. The total yield, which was landed in British ports, amounted 
 to about 500 metric tons valued at about 800,000 kroner (US$116,000) as compared 
 with about 800 metric tons and 900,000 kroner (US$130,000) in 1950. This fishing, 
 therefore, seems to have been fairly profitable to the fishermen in 1951. Plaice 
 totaled 400 metric tons, valued at about 700,000 kroner (US$100,000). 

The bulk of the Danish catch in 1951 was caught in Danish waters, but Danish 
 fishermen also exploited remote seas — first and foremost, the waters of f Greenland. 
 Five companies operated there, and work has been continued on the basis of the ex- 
 perience gained in recent years. Improved landing facilities have been provided, 
 and technical improvements introduced at the stations ashore. Fishing was mainly
