by lines and pound nets. The total yield (converted into whole fish) amounted to 
 about 5|400 metric tons of which about 5,000 metric tons were salted cod. 

As in previous years, a large number of cutters with trawl and Danish seine 
 have been operating in waters off Iceland. They disposed of their catch (mainly 
 plaice) in British ports. Further, a few Danish expeditions also took part in the 
 herring fisheries off Northern Iceland. The total catch from this area was about 
 1,400 metric tons valued at about 1,500,000 kroner (US$218,000), mainly plaice, 
 herring, cod, and haddock. 

Fresh-Water Fisheries : Only scant information is available about the fresh- 
 water fish caught in lakes and rivers. The total yield is estimated at about 1,000 
 metric tons, valued at about 1,000,000 kroner (US$145, 000). Fairly complete infor- 
 mation has been obtained about the considerable rearing of brook trout, which takes 
 place in the pond cultures at Danish fish farms. Total production for export was 
 about 2,500 metric tons in 1951, valued at about 12,100,000 kroner (US$1,750,000) 
 as compared with 2,100 metric tons and 10,300,000 kroner (US$1, 500, 000) in 1950, 
 Only a small part of the production was disposed of on the domestic market. 

Shellfish : Oyster dredging, state operated and cairied on in the Lime Fiord, 
 only yielded a total of 2,600,000 oysters in the I95I/52 season as compared with 
 3,100,000 in 1950/51Â» 

Imports : Danish imports of fishery products in 1951 were valued at about 
 26,900,000 kroner (US$3,900,000). The value of fresh fish imported (mainly from 
 Swedish landings) totaled about 11,400,000 kroner (US$1,650,000), Imports of cured 
 products amounted to 15,500,000 kroner (US$1,600,000), of which salted codandher- 
 ring accounted for about 14,100,000 kroner (US$2,000,000) and canned fish about 
 1,200,000 kroner (US$173,000). Imports of fish meal and herring oil accounted for 
 about 14,900,000 kroner (US$12,200,000), medicinal fish oil about 6,900,000 kroner 
 (US$1,000,000) , and other kinds of fish oil and whale oil 41, 100, 000 kroner (US$5,900,000). 

Exports : Total exports in 1951 amounted to about 120,700 metric tons, valued 
 at about 187,500,000 kroner (US$27,100,000) as compared with about 122,700 metric 
 tons and 169,500,000 kroner (US|24, 500,000) in 1950. Of this, about 91,000 metric 
 tons were fresh fish valued at about 147,000,000 kroner (US$21,200,000) as compared 
 with about 88,000 metric tons and 128,000,000 kroner (US$18, 500, 000) in 1950. Fur- 
 ther, 15,400 metric tons of various shellfish and cuttlefish were exported fresh, 
 valued at about 3,900,000 kroner (US$564, 000) as compared with about 22,200 metric 
 tons and 4,900,000 kroner (US$708,000) in 1950. The export of cured fish products 
 (including shellfish) amounted to about 14,200 metric tons in 1951 valued at about 
 36,400,000 kroner (US$5,300,000) as compared with about 12,500 metric tons and 
 36,200,000 kroner (US$5,200,000) in 1950. Of these exports, canned goods reached 
 a total of about 3,300 metric tons, valued at 17,000,000 kroner (US$2, 500,000), and 
 salted products of herring and cod reached about 10,700 metric tons valued at about 
 18,300,000 kroner (US$2,600,000) , 

Fishery Loans : In the fiscal year 1951/52 the Fisheries Bank granted long- 
 term loans totalling 3,016,800 kroner (US$440, 000) as compared with 5,788,550 kron- 
 er (US$836,000) in 1950/51. 

Fishery Legislation: The basic fishery laws were revised in 1951 both for 
 fresh-water and salt-water fisheries. Together with the extensive legislation on 
 the domestic and export fish trade passed in 1950, these new laws have created a 
 modernized basis for public control of production and distribution of fishery pro- 
 ducts and byproducts.
