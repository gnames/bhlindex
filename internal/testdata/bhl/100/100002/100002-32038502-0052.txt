FRSSH-WATBR ELECTRICAL FISHING EXFERffiffl.'TS ; Experiments in fresh water to 
 catch fish by electricity have been carried out in Hungary the past few years. 
 The results are considered successful, reports The Fishing News of January 17, a 
 British trade magazine. Sponsored by the National Fish Breeding Institute, the 
 aim was to discover the most suitable type of apparatus and to find out if the 
 current had any harmful effect on the fish and on fish breeding. Electrical fish- 
 ing proved particularly successful in waters where plants, reeds, snags, and roots 
 prevent the use of traditional fishing gear. Field experiments were carried out 
 for 11 months mainly in the autumn and winter of 1950-51. 

The apparatus finally adopted consisted of an electric generator capable of 
 producing up to 300 volts and powered by an 8 hp. motor. It was found preferable 
 to use the apparatus from a small craft, to which a copper strip had been fitted 
 to the keel to act as a negative electrode. 

The postive electrode is fitted to the end of a wooden pole and attached to 
 the generator by a length of cable. It consists of a basket-like construction 
 covered with a fine metal mesh. The fisherman stands in the stern of the craft, 
 wiiich is kept in constant motion by an oarsman. When the craft is in a fishing 
 area, the positive electrode is lowered into the water and the current switched onÂ» 
 An electric field is created around the positive electrode and any fish within a 
 radius of one to two meters (3 to 65 feet) is attracted to the positive electrode. 
 It is stunned by the current and can be lifted out of the water in a net. 

Although the radius of the current is small, the fact that the electrode can 
 be dipped into the water about 100 times an hour means that a large area of water 
 can be covered. It was found that the best results were obtained in cooler weather 
 when the fish were more sluggish, and fishing can even be carried out when there 
 is thin ice on the water. Fish which are too small or are otherwise unsuitable 
 can be left to recover and swim away. Also, small fish are less attracted by the 
 current than bigger ones. 

Direct current is used, as alternating current paralyzes the fish and makes 
 them sink to the bottom almost immediately. The strength of the current used varies 
 considerably, but even when full power is used it is not practicable to fish in 
 water more than six feet deep. The electrode is dipped in the water for up to eight 
 seconds at a time. 

The experiments showed that electric fishing while not suitable for big rivers 
 and large expanses of water, gives excellent results \Mhen used in favorable areas. 
 One boat fishing for six weeks on the Nagyberen River, where traditional methods 
 are impracticable, caught 5k metric tons of fish. 

It is intended to encourage fishing by electricity in appropriate waters. The 
 method is also to be used to rid rivers and ponds of cannibal fish and to catch fish 
 for breeding in ponds.

FISHERIES OUTLOOK FOR 1953 : The beginning of the main winter fisheries took 
 place in the face of contracting markets for both frozen and salted fish and stocks 
 of processed fish which are already taxing Iceland's limited storage facilities. 
 The outlook is so poor that the freezing plants have so far been unwilling to agree
