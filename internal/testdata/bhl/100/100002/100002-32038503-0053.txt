to a renewal of last year's price of I.kr. 1.00 per kilo (about 2.8 U. S. cents 
 per pound) for cod (gutted vrith head on), to be paid to the motorboat operators. 
 Price discussions are now going on, after the actual start of fishing operations 
 has taken place, states a January 28 U. S. consular dispatch from Reykjavik. The 
 most favorable market outlook at present is for stockfish (dried cod). This has 
 been a significant export commodity only during the past two years, but will proba- 
 bly be of increasing importance in the future as Iceland develops its own markets 
 for this commodity. Iceland' s largest buyer of stockfish is at present the Federal 
 Republic of Germany, which re-exports the fish to African customers. Iceland lacks 
 experience in fish drying for export, and the weather at the beginning of the sea- 
 son is somewhat risky, but the prospects are that drying will be done on a much 
 larger scale this year. 

PLAJJ TO INCREASE FISHERY PRODUCTS EXPORTS ; A representative of the Icelandic 
 Foreign Office's Commercial Section is now in Warsaw negotiating a renewal of the 

Icelandic-Polish trade 

agreement, which ex- 
 pired at the end of 
 1952. The increasing 
 importance of compen- 
 sation trade in Ice- 
 land's search for mar- 
 kets for fisheries 
 products has led to 
 attempts to arrange 
 triangular deals by 
 which Icelaijd will buy 
 more of a product than 
 she can consume, and 
 re-export the surplus. 
 It can be expected that Iceland will attempt to re-export Spanish oranges to the 
 Faroe Islands and certain "curtain" countries, particularly Hungary. The Iceland- 
 ic Chamber of Commerce has taken the lead in promoting this type of trade which, 
 it is hoped, will improve Iceland's export possibilities by making it possible for 
 her to offer her customers an attractive "package" of commodities, and at the same 
 time enabling Iceland's suppliers to take more Icelandic fish.

U. S. ARMY VETERINARIAN VISITS FREEZING PLANTS : The Chief Veterinarian for 
 the U. S. Army's European Command visited Iceland in January to inspect fish freez- 
 ing plants as a possible source of supplies of fish to the U. S. Army. The Army's 
 needs, procurement, and sanitary inspection procedures were discussed at a meeting 
 attended by representatives of the organizations exporting frozen fish, the Ministry 
 of Commerce, and the Legation. A number of freezing plants in the Reykjavik, Akranes, 
 Keflavik area were inspected and the Veterinarian reported that he was very much 
 impressed with the plants he saw. He is recommending that the plants be put on the 
 Army's approved list. U. S. Army requirements are for 250,000 pounds of fishmonth- 
 ly; and while this is a comparatively modest amount, the Icelandic producers are 
 anxious to supply the U. S. Army because of increasingly poor prospects for market- 
 ing the fish caugiit during the season just beginning. (Editor's Note: Although 
 not specifically stated, requirements are for U. S. troops in Iceland only . Pur- 
 chase of fish abroad to meet requirements of troops in United States not contem- 
 plated, according to the U. S. Army Quartermaster Corps.)
