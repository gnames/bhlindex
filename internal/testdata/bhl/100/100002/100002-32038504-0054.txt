RENEWAL gF_ MOTORBOAT CURRENCY AGREEMENT : Negotiations are now taking place 
 regarding the renewal of the currency retention scheme for the motorboat fishing 
 fleet. The motorboat owners are attempting to obtain a larger share of the for- 
 eign exchange proceeds of their exports. As a collateral demand they are asking 
 that they be allowed to name one member of the Government's Economic Board, as they 
 contend that no one on the present Board knows the fishing industry well enough. 
 The owners are also pressing for a reduction in the interest rate of the banks on 
 operational loans to fishing-boat operators, from the present 7 percent to 5 per- 
 cent. The prospects are for a renewal of the currency scheme on the same basis as 
 before, with a possible concession on the question of interest rate.

FISHERIES TO RECEIVE AID FROM NORWAY : India's fisheries will be provided 
 with fishery technical experts and equipment from Norway as part of a tri-partite 
 agreement signed recently by representatives of India, Norway, and the United Na- 
 tions. The agreement includes an over-all plan for improving the economic and 
 social conditions in a limited area of Travancore-Cochin, on the west coast of 
 India, states the Norwegian Information Service on February 5. 

Norway will contribute 2.7 million rupees (US$560, 000) in the I953/54 fiscal year 
 toward technical aid to a community of some 12,000 fit^hermen living on the shores 
 of the Ashtamudi Lagoon in the estuary of the Callada River. In the same period, 
 the Government of India will spend 10.6 million rupees (US$2. 2 million) on devel- 
 oping fisheries in this same area. 

Among the projects that will have top priority are: (l) the installation of 
 Norwegian engines in Indian fishing craft; (2) promoting rational methods of han- 
 dling fish; (3) construction of an ice-making plant for the fisheries; (4) purifi- 
 cation of drinking water; and (5) establishment of a health center. 

The Norwegian assistance will be financed by a fund voted by the Parliament, 
 later to be supplemented by the proceeds from a nationwide collection drive now 
 being organized.
