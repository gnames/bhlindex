dispatches from Tehran. The financial and administrative affairs of the firmwill 
 now be managed bj'- Iranian officials and the Soviet Government vd.ll no longer have 
 any interest in its financial affairs. Iran officials have replaced former Soviet 
 officials in the accounts department. Iranian Government representatives visited 
 various installations of the fisheries and issued new instructions for each sec- 
 tion. Among the technical staff, 29 Soviet nationals continued with their work 
 to prevent a breakdown of operations pending their replacement. 

The 1927 agreement provided that when the contract expired the operations of 
 the company would cease and the assets would be divided equally between the two 
 countries. One Iranian Government official expressed confidence that the proce- 
 dure of liquidating the assets would run smoothly, and when finally settled some 
 Russian experts may remain in Iran to help operate the new company. 

It is understood that the Iranians plan to pay in fish for the Russians' half 
 of the physical properties and give them the right to buy all of the new company's 
 output.

CANNED AND FROZEN TUNA EXPORT QUOTA TO UNITED STATES INCREASED: 

The export 

of an additional 3,000 short tons of frozen tuna and 150,000 cases of canned tuna 
 to the United States for the period April 1952 to March 1953 has been authorized 
 by the Japanese Ministry of International Trade, reports a February 17 U. S. Em- 
 bassy dispatch from Tokyo. 

The Japanese Government on April 7, 1952, established a quota for the export 
 of frozen and canned tuna to the United States for April 1952-March 1953. The 
 original quota for frozen tuna was 12,000 short tons; last September this was in- 
 creased by 6,000 tons to 13,000 tons; and the latest increase of 3j000 tons raises 
 the quota to 21,000 tons. The original quota for canned tuna was 1,000,000 cases 
 and the present increase raises it t o 1,150,000 cases. 

NOTE: THERE HAS BEEN SOME CONEUSION AS TO WHETHER THE QUOTA WAS EXPRESSED IN METRIC OR SHORT 
 TONS. HOWEVER, ACCORDING TO RECENT INFORMATION IT IS REPORTED THAT THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT 
 HAS ALWAYS REPORTED THE QUOTA FOR FROZEN TUNA EXPORTS TO THE UNITED STATES IN SHORT TONS.

FISHERIES P RODUCTION OUTLOOK THROUGH 1957 : Japanese fisheries production is 
 expected to steadily rise each year until it reaches approximately 10.8 billion 
 pounds in 1957 as compared with the 7.9 billion pounds produced in 1951 and an 
 estimated 8.5 billion pounds in 1952 (see table). 
 The 1957 estimate represents a 27-percent in- 
 crease above the prewar level of 1936. This pre- 
 diction, published in the Japanese press ( Kyodo , Year 
 December 3} and Tokyo Shinbun, December 2), was 
 made by the Japanese Fisheries Agency, reports a 
 U. S. Embassy dispatch from Tol<yo. 

The upward trend in catch is expectedto re- 
 sult from: (l) the shift from coastal fishing to 
 more productive offshore fishing grounds, includ- 
 ing exploration and development of some of the
