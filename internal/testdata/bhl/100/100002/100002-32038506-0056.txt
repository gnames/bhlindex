 the best utilization on a sustained-yield basis; and (4) continued improvement in 
 the whaling catch, reaching prewar levels.

WHALE - CATCHER BOAT LOCATES GOOD TUNA GROUNDS IN CORAL SEA: Experimental fish- 
 ing by a Japanese whale catcher ( Fumi Maru No. 1^) en route to the Antarctic has 
 revealed indications of good catches of tuna in the Coral Sea between Australia 
 and New Caledonia, according to a Japanese press report (Mainichi Shimbun , Decem- 
 ber 20). This catcher (attached to the factoryship Nisskin Maru ) did some exper- 
 imental fishing with long lines in waters south of the equator. Good tuna fish- 
 ing was indicated at 19°43' S. latitude and 156°32' E. longitude. The catch of 
 the brief experimental fishing consisted of 11 yellowfin tuna, 8 albacore,l broad- 
 bill swordfish, and 15 Spanish mackerel. This is equivalent to a Japanese tuna 
 boat catch of 350 baskets of gear on regular long-line operations, or 256,000 
 pounds per haul. 

This information was received with considerable interest by the tuna fisher- 
 men at Misaki, one of the leading tuna ports in Japan. Misaki is 3,480 miles 
 from the new tuna area. Tuna fishermen believe this distant fishing ground can be 
 fished by the large-sized tuna boats (350 gross-ton class) which have been com- 
 pleted or are under construction. Indications are that Japanese boats will soon 
 be making trips to this newly-reported tuna area to determine the possibility of 
 full-scale commercial operations.
