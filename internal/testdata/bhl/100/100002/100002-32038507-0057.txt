WHALE OIL SOLD TO WEST GERMANY : An agreement for the sale of 12,250 metric 
 tons of Japanese whale oil to West Germany was reached recently. This should po 
 a long way towards solving Japan's difficulty in disposing of the bulk of its 
 1951/52 Antarctic whaling production, according to a Japanese press report ( Kyodo , 
 December 12, 1952). This amount is 35 percent of Japan's total production (34,700 
 metric tons) of whale oil for 1951/52. In exchange for the whale oil (in storage 
 in Europe), West Germany is expected to sell Japan 26,000 metric tons of Cuban 
 sugar . 

Several factors contributed to Japan' s inability to dispose of the 1951/52 
 Antarctic production of whale oil: 

1. On the export market : (a) whale oil was banned by the United Kingdom, 
 one of the largest consumers, because of its import curtailment policy; (b) Ger- 
 many, the Netherlands, and other countries in Europe suffered the loss of markets 
 due to Japan's excessive export credit; and (c) the supply of whale oil increased. 

2. On the domestic market ; the sale of whale oil has been adversely affected 
 by imports of cheap beef tallow from the United States. 

The price of whale oil has been affected by the world-wide increase in the 
 production of vegetable oils. Because of the decline in the price of vegetable 
 oils, the whale-oil price decreased from tl20 (US$336) per ton in December 1951 
 (the beginning of the whaling season) to L70 (US$196) per ton in May 1952 after 
 the whaling season had ended. The price quoted in the deal with West Germany is 
 approximately i95 (US$266) per ton. 

The Japanese whaling industry is endeavoring to dispose of its whale-oil 
 stocks in storage in Japan — approximately 23,000 metric tons. The Fisheries Com- 
 mittees of the Lower House on December 19, 1952, called on the Japanese Government 
 to purchase whale oil to stabilize the price. No decision has been made by the 
 Government on this problem.

FISHING VESSELS LAND AT HONG KONG : Two Japanese otter trawlers landed their 
 catches at Hong Kong on December 6, marking the first Japanese catch to be landed 
 directly at that port in the postwar period, reports the Japanese press ( Nippon 
 Times , December 8). The two boats, owned by a Tokyo company, are part of a 13- 
 boat fleet operating under a special license granted the firm for fishing in the 
 South China Sea, including the area off Hong Kong. This trawler fleet is headed 
 by the mothership Baikal Maru of 7,477 gross tons. 

These landings are the result of negotiations at Hong Kong between a repre- 
 sentative of the Japanese fishing company and Hong Kong Government officials. In 
 discussions with Hong Kong officials regarding fishing and marketing conditions, 
 the Japanese representative was informed that there were no legal objections to the 
 landing of catches by Japanese fishing boats although it was expected that Hong 
 Kong fishermen would oppose such landings. However, the officials added that the 
 catches would have to be sold through the Government marketing system, to which 
 the Japanese representative agreed. 

The Hong Kong officials also stated that the current supply of fish was con- 
 siderably belov/ requirements since the local population has increased greatly in 
 the past year or so, largely because of the influx from Red China. The Hong Kong 
 fleet is apparently incapable of adequately supplying this increased need at the 
 present time. It was believed, therefore, that landings by Japanese fishing boats 
 would be helpful in meeting the shortage of animal protein foods.
