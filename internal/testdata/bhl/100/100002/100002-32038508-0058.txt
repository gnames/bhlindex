56 COMKERCIAL FISHERIES REVIEW Vol. 15, No. 3 

Anticipating that Hong Kong fishermen would object to the landings by Japa- 
 nese boats and vd.shing to prevent any adverse effect of such landings on the Hong 
 Kong market, the Japanese company plans to limit landings by using only twotrawl- 
 ers of its fleet. It further plans to hold the landed catches to limited quanti- 
 ties and to space them over specified intervals of time to prevent a drastic drop 
 in fish prices on the Hong Kong market. The catch of the rest of the Japanese 
 fleet operating off Hong Kong will be carried directly to Japan. 

Hong Kong fishermen have already voiced opposition to the landings of Japa- 
 nese catches ( Kyodo , November 29). They charged that a sharp drop (50 percent) 
 in fish prices occurred prewar when Japanese fishing boats "suddenly dumped" their 
 catches at Hong Kong. 

According to a December 7 press report, the two Japanese trawlers landed ap- 
 proximately two metric tons of fish and the catch was sold through Hong Kong Gov- 
 ernment channels. The fish arrived at a time when recent adverse fishing weather 
 had resulted in much smaller catches by Hong Kong fishermen. 

The Japanese company received information from Hong Kong on December 9 that 
 good progress had been made in clarifying a misunderstanding on the quantity of 
 Japanese-caught fish to be landed and that the "situation was quiet." The Japa- 
 nese company is anxious to avoid international friction and, therefore, carefully 
 reviewed the situation and discussed the project with responsible Hong Kong offi- 
 cials before deciding to send its boats into that port.

FISHING RESTRICTIONS OFF KOREA CAUSE CONCERN ; The Japanese have expressed 
 concern over the restrictions on fishing in areas off South Korea as a result of 
 the "Sea Defense Zone" established by the Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations 
 Forces, a Uo S. Embassy dispatch from Tokyo dated December 29 states. It is hoped 
 by the Japanese that a solution will be fovmd which will allow Japanese fishermen 
 to have access to those waters.

JAPANESE-KOREAN DISPUTE OVER FISHING AREAS OFF KOREA : Korean President Rhee 
 has stated his willingness to meet with representatives of the Japanese fishing 
 industry to discuss problems of mutual interest to Japanese and Korean fisheries. 

The scheduled meeting (expected to take place in February) developed from a 
 request to President Rhee by the Japanese fishing industry to lift the Korean re- 
 strictions on Japanese fishing inside of the Rhee Line which was established by 
 unilateral action of Korea in January 1952 by a proclamation by President Rhee. 
 The Japanese Government has objected to Korea' s action in claiming territorial 
 jurisdiction beyond the international three-mile limit and extending into "high 
 seas" areas. Seizures of Japanese vessels by Korean patrol boats have taken place 
 over the last several months. These have been vigorously protested by the Japanese 
 fishing industry operating in the waters off South Korea. This topic has received 
 wide publicity in the Japajnese press. 

Although the discussions between President Rhee and his officials and the 
 Japanese fishing delegation will be informal, fishery circles hope that they will 
 pave the way for the solution of fisheries disputes by official negotiations which 
 may follow between the Governments of Korea and Japan.
