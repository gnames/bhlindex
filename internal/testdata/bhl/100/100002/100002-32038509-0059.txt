PEARL-SHELL FISHING FLAMMED IN Tm ARAFURA SEA: Pearl-shell fishing in the 
 Arafura Sea (north of Australia) has been authorized by the Japanese Government 
 for the first time in the postwar era, states a December 17 dispatch from the 
 United States Embassy in Tokyo. Fishing will be by mothership operations on the 
 high seas by a private company organized on December 5, 1952. Final composition 
 of this expedition has not been decided as yet, but it is expected that it will 
 consist of not more than one mothership (tonnage not known), 25 diver boats (50 
 to 80 gross tons average), and 70 Japanese divers. The fleet will probably sail 
 from Japan in late February or early March 1953. 

A total of 25 applications have been approved by the Japanese Fisheries A- 
 gency from a total of 78 received. The Agency gave preference to those who had 
 engaged in pearl-shell fishing before the war, and all approved applicants have 
 had such experience. Those authorized to engage in this activity will also be 
 required to obtain special operational licenses, provided the vessels and other 
 conditions meet Government requirements. 

The Government has limited the annual catch to 1,250 metric tons to avoid 
 catches in excess of requirements that would oversupply the limited market. The 
 Government has also imposed a minimum oyster-size limit. The landed catch will 
 consist only of shells 15 centimeters or larger. The catch will be brought to 
 Japaji and processed into shell buttons. It is reported a New York firm will be a 
 principal distributor. 

Prior to World War II a fleet of Japanese divers fished for pearl shells in 
 the Arafura Sea. According to reports, the fleet nvimbered 170 boats and 2,200 
 fishermen at its peak, and produced an annual catch of 3>800 metric tons. A large 
 part of the production was exported to the United States button markets. In 1923, 
 the Japanese also began experiments in the culture of the pearl-shell oyster at 
 Buton, Celebes. In 1930, a company was organized in the interest of further de- 
 velopment in the culture of the pearl-shell oyster. This company was in existence 
 until 1944.

U. S. VESSELS ACCUSED OF FISHING IN MEXICAN TERRITORIAL WATERS : According to 
 reports of Mexican commercial fishermen, approximately 30 United States shrimp 
 fishing vessels are regularly operating off the coast of Mexico between Tampico 
 and Tuxpan, frequently within one or two miles off the coast. These reports also 
 indicate that the vessels carry an unusually large number of small arms. A large 
 fleet of United States fishing vessels is also reported in Campeche Sound, accord- 
 ing to reports transmitted by the U. S. Embassy at Mexico City in a February 13 
 dispatch. 

United States operators of fishing boats operating near Mexican waters are 
 notified that foreign vessels found fishing in Mexican waters without authorization 
 from the Mexican Government may be seized by Mexican Authorities. Mexico considers 
 its territorial waters to extend nine miles out to sea,
