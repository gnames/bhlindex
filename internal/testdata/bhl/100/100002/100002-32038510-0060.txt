STATUS OF FISPERIES , 1951 : The total investment of capital in the Mexican 
 fishery industries amounted to approximately 250 million pesos (US$29 million) as 
 of December 30 j 1951, reports the November 1952 World Fish Trade , a Danish trade 
 periodicals Further expansion is predicted. 

There were at least 36 freezing plants operating in Mexico during 1951 — 29 
 on the Pacific Coast and 7 on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, there 
 were 27 plants processing sardines, tuna, bonito, Spanish mackerel, and abalone 
 for both export and domestic consumption. These processing plants are located in 
 the states of Sonora, Sinaloa, Baja California, and Campeche. 

Total exports of shrimp to the United States in 1951 amounted to 39,652,640 
 pounds. One-third of this total was caught in the Gulf of Mexico and the remain- 
 der in the Pacific Ocean, including the Gulf of California. 

Government revenue through taxes on fishery products exports has been stead- 
 ily increasing.

HUGE FISH-FREEZING AND COLD-STORAGE PLANT BEGINS OPERATIONS : A fish-freezing 
 and cold-storage plant, considered to be the world's largest, was scheduled for 
 testing in Bergen, Norway, late in January, according to a report in Fiskaren 
 (January 14), a Norwegian traJe periodical. The plant was expected to begin ac- 
 cepting herring for freezing in half -boxes (44 pounds) at a rate of 2,500 boxes 
 per 24-hour day. During the trial operation, storage will be available for about 
 40,000 boxes. 

When the plant is in full operation later in the summer, it will be able to 
 freeze 5,000 half-boxes per 24-hour day and store 12,000 metric tor* of fish, in- 
 cluding herring. The dry-freezing capacity will be 75 metric tons per 24-hour 
 day, with special consideration for tuna. The plant is equipped with refrigera- 
 tion machinery of American manufacture.

WHALE-MEAT INDUSTRY ; Production ; A total of 6,300 metric tons of whale meat 
 was produced in Norway in 1952, compared with 5,420 metric tons in 1951, reports 
 a December 15, 1952, U. S. Embassy dis- 
 patch from Oslo (see table). It is ex- 
 pected that the future annual production 
 will remain at between 5,000 and 7,000 
 metric tons. 

The main whale-catching districts 
 are located on the west coast of Norway 
 which has about 100 deep-freezing plants. 
 The total capacity of these olants is 
 well over 100 metric tons per 24-hour day.

There are 4 shore whaling stations, oper- 
 These catcher boats are mainly engaged in catching 
 large whales, which they tow to the shore stations for processing. In addition, 
 there are 240 smaller boats catching smaller whales. The number has been reduced 
 from over 400 in previous years in order to avoid reduction of the number of whales. 
 The small boats, in contrast to the whale catchers of the shore stations, strip the 
 whales of blubber and cut the meat in the catching area. After the meat has cooled, 
 it is iced.
