March 1953 COMMERCIAL FISHERIES REVIEW 59 

The Norwegian Government, through the Office of Whaling of the Ministry of 
 Industries, issues licenses valid for one year to small boat owners who wish to 
 engage in whale catching. Licenses were issued to 240 boats for the 1952 season, 
 less than the number issued in previous years. In order to avoid depleting the 
 whale supply, the Government by licensing larger boats, is attempting to encourage 
 whale catching farther from the Norwegian coast. 

The catching season for small boats is from March 15 through September 14, 
 with the exception of the period July 1 through 20. The catching season for the 
 shore stations is from April 20 through October 19. The shore stations are al- 
 lowed to catch whales during the July 1-20 period, but they are not allowed to 
 market whale meat during this period. The shore stations are issued licenses 
 valid for 7 years Â» 

Attempts have been made to have whales processed within 24 hours after kill- 
 ing, but this is very difficult to control. In any event, meat intended for sale 
 for human or animal consumption is inspected and passed by government inspectors. 
 Meat which does not pass inspection is processed into other products. 

Processing Regulations ; Regulations on the handling and packing of whale 
 meat specify, in part, that: 

All whale meat packers must be authorized by the Ministry of Industries. 

As soon as possible after catching, the blood shall be drawn from all whales 
 which are to be towed ashore for processing. 

Prior to towing, all whales shall be opened in order that they may be evis- 
 cerated during towing. 

The whales shall be stripped of blubber as soon as they have been brought 
 ashore. 

During processing, the whale meat is to be graded as follows: 

lo Whale steak - Meat cut from the back or side of the whale, of at least 
 a 50-3quare-centimeter cross section area down through the grain. 

2. Manufacturing meat - The same meat as whale steak, but of smaller cuts, 

3. Whale-tongue meat - The light colored meat from the tongue,, 

4. Animal food or waste meat - All other meat from the whale. 

The meat should be deep frozen within 72 hours from the time freezing is 
 started. 

Exports of grades of whale meat other than "whale steak" or "manufacturing 
 meat," and whale meat which is not frozen, are prohibited. 

Exports ; Exports of whale and seal meat from Norway in the period January- 
 October 1952 totaled 3,^61 metric tons (table 2). In the entire year 1951 exports 
 totaled 1,144 metric tons. Frozen whale meat exports are not available separately, 
 but seal meat exports are an insignificant part of the total. About 56 percent 
 of the total 1952 production of whale meat has been exported at an average f .o.b 
 price of 1,68 kroner per kilo (10^ U.S. cents per poxmd) . About 90 percent of 
 total exports went to the United Kingdom,
