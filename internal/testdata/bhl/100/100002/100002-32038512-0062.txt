One of the 
 main exporters of 
 whale meat (the 
 only significant 

exporters of frozen whale meat for human consiimption to the U. S.) indicated that 
 in a normal catching season, if exports to the United Kingdom were reduced and 
 favorable prices on the American market prevailed, he would be able to offer the 
 following quantities for export to the Uo So annually: 1,000 metric tons whale 
 steak, 1,000 tons manufacturing meat, and 2,000 tons whale meat for animal feeding. 
 A representative from the Whaling Office of Ministry of Industries considered these 
 figures too high, and believed that no more than about 2,000 tons of the Norwegian 
 production of manufacturing meat and animal food could possibly be exported.
