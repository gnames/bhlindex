This modification of Decree No. 30 is the direct result of the Panamanian 
 Government's recognition of the fact that it now does not have available practical 
 means for selling the fuel and lubricants in Panamanian territory and for collect- 
 ing the related import duties. The oil companies refused to assist in collecting 
 these duties.

According to Spanish 
 fin species, while skipjac 
 eral heading of "bonito." 
 Albacore (also called "Bo- 
 nito del norte") is clas- 
 sified separately. Data 
 in this report are accord- 
 ingly classified under 
 three separate headings: 
 "tuna," "bonito," and "al- 
 bacore" in accordance with 
 Spanish classifications. 

Fishing and the Fleet ; The Spanish tuna fishing industry is centered chiefly 
 in the Canary Islands and the Provinces of Huelva and Cadiz. Bonito and albacore 
 fishing is scattered generally around the northern and northwestern littoral, with 
 the Cantabrian region ranking first in bonito and albacore catches. 

Tuna fishing off the shores of Huelva and Cadiz is from fixed nets, owned by 
 one company. This organization is believed to be capitalized at between 75 and 
 100 million pesetas (U3$l,892,000-2, 522,000) . The Spanish Government controls 52 
 percent of its capital stock and private Spanish interests the remainder. In 1951 
 it operated 218 boats of all types and employed l,A-00 persons in fishing and tend- 
 ing its installations. Fishermen earn a fixed salary plus a percentage of the 
 catch with average earnings amounting to about 1,000 pesetas (US$25) monthlyo 
 This firm also operates a number of canneries in this area, the output of which 
 consists of various species of fish for export. 

Tuna fishing in the Canaries supplies about 8 percent of the total fish catch 
 in that area. There are no available data relating to the percentage of the Canary 
 Island fleet specializing in tuna fishing. The total fishing fleet (excluding oar- 
 propelled boats) in the Canary Islands numbers some 557 units with a net tonnage 
 of 11,894 metric tons and a declared value of approximately 76 million pesetas 
 (US$1,917,000). 

The entire Cantabrian fishing fleet of Northern Spain in 1951 numbered 2,371 
 vessels (excluding oar-propelled) with a net tonnage of 56,818 metric tons. Simi- 
 larly, there is no breakdown of data relating to the percentage of vessels spec- 
 ializing in albacore or bonito fishing. The greater part of this fleet is reported 
 to be aintiquated and badly in need of replacement. There are, however, a number 
 of modern and well-equipped fishing vessels included in the fleet.
