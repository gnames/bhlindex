COMMERCIAL FISHERIES REVIEW 

Vol. 15, No. 3 

The fleet engaged in fishing for albacore off the Vigo area is estimated to 
 number some 50 units of from 80 to 150 tons. Its fishing grounds are roughly de- 
 scribed as an area 50 to 60 miles from Vigo off the Spanish and Portugese coasts 
 and as far north as the 45th parallel, near the Grand Sole. The season generally 
 runs from the beginning of June through the middle of October, vd.th the larger 
 vessels extending their operations later in the season up to the 45th parallel. 

The Direccion General de Pesca Maritima states that the Spanish tvma fleet, 
 as such, is relatively small. The Government has apparently made no special ef- 
 fort to develop a tuna industry since the end of the Spanish Civil War. 

In 1950 the Government repealed the ban against the construction of fishing 
 vessels of less than 100 tons and offered subsidies for the construction of new 
 vessels and the refitting of old ones. However, new construction was hampered by 
 the lack of raw materials, ship fittings, and the requirement that one old unit 
 be removed from service for every new one constructed under a subsidy. Since the 
 majority of owners possessed only one or two units, they could not afford to re- 
 move their vessels from service while awaiting the construction of new ones. The 
 scarcity and excessive cost of ship-building materials still hamper the expansion 
 of the Spanish fishing fleet. 

Prices ; Prices paid to fishermen vary throughout the different regions. The 
 national averages for the years 1949-52 are shown in table 2.

Canning Industry : An impediment to the development of the fish-canning in- 
 dustry in general is the shortage of tinplate. With increased arrivals from the 
 United States and European sources Spain is gradually allocating more to the fish- 
 packing industry. Packers still complain, however, that they could export more 
 fish if there were sufficient tinplate available. 

About 20 percent of the approximately 425 fish-canning plants in operation 
 during 1951 listed tuna and tuna-like fish among their specialties. The Vigo area 
 is the leading packing center with a total of 103 plants â€” 23 of which handle tuna, 
 bonito, and albacore, among other species. Albacore fishing for canning in this 
 area sprang into importance about 1944 when the scarcity of sardines forced the 
 canning industry to turn to other species. When sardines are available, the can- 
 ning of albacore is estimated to represent about l6 percent of total production, 
 practically all of which is for export. When sardines are not available, as has 
 been the case for the past several years, the canning of albacore is estimated to 
 represent about 45 percent of production. 

The canning facilities in the Vi^o area are estimated to account for about 80 
 percent of the total volume of the Spanish fish-canning industry. There are no 
 figures available as to the percentage of the national output of tuna and tuna-like 
 fish canned in any one area. Other important areas in which tuna and tuna-like 
 fish are canned are Oviedo, Vizcaya, Santander, and La Coruna. Of the 10 fish-can- 
 ning plants in the Canary Islands, 7 specialize in canning tuna.
