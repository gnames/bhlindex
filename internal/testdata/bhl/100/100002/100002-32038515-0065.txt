COMMERCIAL FISHERIES REVIEW 

63 

It is estimated that approximately 80 percent of the tuna and tuna-like fish 
 canned in Spain is packed in olive oil, the remainder in a mild solution of vine- 
 gar and salt with a flavoring agent, such as laurel leaves. During the fishing 
 season a small percentage of the catch is sold fresh in the local markets. There 
 are limited cold-storage facilities in some of the principal fishing centers in 
 Spain, but there are no special fish-freezing plants. It is reported, however, 
 that a Vigo firm has such a plant under order but not in operation. 

Exports ; Various trade sources estimate exports of tuna, albacore, and bo- 
 nito as between 70 and 85 percent of the total catch. The same sources state 
 that Italy is Spain's traditional export market for tuna and tuna-like fish, fol- 
 lowed by Switzerland, Egypt, Cuba, Great Britain, Uruguay, Mexico, United States, 
 and Germany. .

FISH CONSUMPTION . 1949 -51: The total consumption of fishery products in 
 Sweden during 1951 amounted to 107,700 metric tons, reports a December 5 U. S. 
 consular dispatch from Goteborg (see table). This was a decrease of 3 percent 
 from the total consumption in 1950, and 5 percent less than for 1949. 

Consumption of fishery products during the first six months of 1952, accord- 
 ing to preliminary estimates, amounted to approximately 48,175 metric tons, com- 
 pared with 44,802 tons in the similar period of 1951 and 53,855 tons in 1950.
