Union of South Africa 

STATUS OF COMMERCIAL FISHERIES , 1952 : The commercial fishery industries of 
 the Union of South Africa produce about 600,000 metric tons of fishery products 
 annually and are still in the process of expanding, states a December 23 U. S. 
 consular dispatch from Cape Town. The industries are valued at close totl3 million 
 (US$36 million). 

The fishing fleet totals 2,558 craft — 36 steam trawlers, 6 motor trawlers, 
 46 whaling vessels, 72 motorboats, 266 sail and row boats over 13 feet in length, 
 and 1,493 dinghies under 13 feet. Approximately 8,000 fishermen are active in 
 the industry and a similar number are engaged in the processing plants. Over 
 50,000 men, women, and children in South Africa are directly dependent on the fish- 
 ing industry for a livelihood. 

Trawling ; Cape Town is the most important of the Union's trawling centers. 
 Of the 62,500 metric tons of the fish caught by ^trawlers in 1951, 58,000 tons were 
 landed in Cape Town, while the balance was handled at Port Elizabeth, East London, 
 and Mossel Bay. Three-quarters of the total catch consisted of stockfish ( Merluc - 
 cius capensis ) . 

Pilchard Fishery : South Africa's vast pilchard potential (which prior to the 
 World War II years had been practically completely ignored) has developed into the 
 Union's most important fishery industry. Now over 500,000 metric tons of pilchard 
 and maasbanker are taken annually. At present there are 15 reduction plants — 11 
 in the St. Helena-Saldanha Bay area and 4 (with licenses for 2 more) at Walvis Bay. 
 These plants produce over 100,000 metric tons of fish meal and approximately 
 5,000,000 gallons of fish oil each year. The canning plants handle 30,000 metric 
 tons of pilchard. One of the four major pilchard factories at Walvis Bay went 
 into operation only in September 1952, two reduction plants, with capacities of 
 10 metric tons per hour, were in operation when the factory opened, and a third has 
 now been completed. 

Seven vessels are presently feeding the factory, which is producing only fish 
 meal until the cannery is completed next year. Two vessels fishing at Walvis Bay 
 for this plant are specially designed purse seiners — larger than the usual type. 
 It is reported that the performances of these vessels are being watched with in- 
 terest by the industry. 

Nearly all pilchard canning companies report record trading profits for the 
 most recent financial year and hopes for still better results are supported by the 
 construction work in progress along the West Coast. It appears that the aggregate 
 output of canned pilchard is soon to increase by 50 percent and this may be the 
 limit for some time in order to preserve the resource. 

Spiny Lobster Industry ; Canned and frozen spiny lobster has also assumed an 
 important role in the Union's fishing industry. About 28,000,000 pounds of spiny 
 lobster are caught each year off the West Coast. The Government has imposed a 
 ceiling of 7i million pounds on the annual exportation of canned and frozen spiny 
 lobster tails. 

The Union consumes about 2,000,000 pounds of spiny lobster of which about 
 600,000 pounds are in the form of frozen tails. The frozen spiny lobster fishery 
 has also developed into an important dollar-earning industry through exports to the 
 United States, while the canned product is exported mainly to the tJnited Kingdom, 
 Australia, and the Far East.
