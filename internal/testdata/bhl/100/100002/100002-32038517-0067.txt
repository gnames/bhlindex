March 1953 COMMERCIAL FISHERIES REVIEW 65 

Standard Specifications Proposed ; The South African Government recently 
 issued two notices in its official gazette concerning the introduction of proposed 
 compulsory standards specifications for canned fish and canned spiny lobster. Al- 
 though these specifications vd.ll not be enforced until two months after the pub- 
 lication of a final notice, the Cape Town Chamber of Commerce has, at the request 
 of the South African Bureau of Standards, recently advised its members to dispose 
 of their existing stocks of canned fish and canned spiny lobster, as the final 
 notice is to be issued in the very near future. 

Trends and Developments ; The most serious problem facing the fishery indus- 
 try along the West Coast is the lack of fresh water for use by canneries and 
 processing plants. There is however, a Government plan afoot to supply fresh water 
 from the Berg River to Saldanha Bay and the area around the Berg River mouth. 

Development of the industry and the responsibilities of providing simenities 
 for those engaged in the industry are in the hands of the Fisheries Development 
 Corporation of South Africa Limited. This organization, which was established in 
 terms of the Fishing Industry Development Act of 1944, is at present a wholly Gov- 
 ernment-owned body. 

Its main objects, as set out in the Act, are briefly as follows: 

lo To establish and manage schemes for the promotion or better organization 
 of the catching of fish and to finance such schemes. 

2Â« To carry on the business of buying, selling, processing, and marketing 
 of fish and fish products. 

3. To acquire shares in any company engaged in catching fish, 

4. To establish mutual benefit societies, social clubs, townships, housing 
 utility companies, home ownership schemes, social and health services, 
 and any other similar undertakings which may be beneficial to fishermen. 

The organization has contributed much towards the success and stability of 
 the industry and towards the general well being and social uplift of the fishermen. 
 The Government has also taken active steps to establish a training scheme for fish- 
 ermen to improve their efficiency,, A Union Mercantile Marine Trading Advisory 
 Board has been created to deal with the question of nautical training generally, 
 with special reference to the training of fishermen. 

Research ; In 1950 the South African Government had a research ship Africana 
 II specially designed and built for research work in the South African seas. The 
 length of the vessel is 205 feet, displacement 1,300 tons, maximum speed 13.5 knots, 
 and a range of 6,500 miles. It is fitted with radar, wireless, and echo-sounding 
 equipment (down to a depth of over 4,000 fathoms). Accommodation is provided for 
 35 officers (including six scientists) and men. Two smaller vessels are also em- 
 ployed for inshore research work and patrolling spiny lobster sanctuaries. 

Commercial enterprise is further aided indirectly by tho Fishing Industry Re- 
 search Institute which carries out research of a technological nature in the fields 
 of canning, freezing, and processing of fisheries products. The Institute is short- 
 ly to be transferred to the grounds of the University of Cape Town where a modern 
 block of twenty research laboratories is to be erected. 

Other scientists and scientific bodies are also contributing their share to 
 the accumulated knowledge of fishes of the coast of the Union. The Zoological
