SOUTH-WEST AFRICA CURTAILS PILCHARD FISHING : The administration of South- 
 west Africa set a limit on the number of pilchard fishing vessels each factory 
 may operate at Walvis Bay, states a January 5 Uc S. consular dispatch from Cape 
 Town. Each factory will be limited to 24 vessels, except in cases where factories 
 already have more than this number operating. It is reported that pilchard schools 
 are so large that vessels have caught more fish than they can carry and are forced 
 to discard some of the catch. Another factor prompting this action is the vessel 
 congestion at fishing factory jetties where due to unloading delays fish rot in 
 the holds. Now, no vessel may wait more than 12 hours before unloading.

WHITE FISH AND HERRING INDUSTRIES BILL INTRODUCED ; The "White Fish and Her- 
 ring Industries Bill" introduced into the House of Commons on December 15, 1952, 
 will provide grants towards the cost of building and equipping vessels for inshore 
 and near- and middle-water fishing. The White Fish Authority stated in its first 
 annual report that 75 percent of these vessels are over 30 years old, reports a 
 December 18 UÂ« S. Embassy dispatch from London. 

Exchequer payments over a period of ten years will be authorized in the amount 
 of L9 million (US$25 million) to the White Fish Authority and up to L750,000 
 (US$2,100,000) to the Herring Industry Board. The terms of the grants will apply 
 only to vessels or engines ordered after July 1952. Thus, working owners will be 
 eligible for a grant of 25 percent of the cost, with a maximum of 1=4,000 (US$11, lOO), 
 and in other cases the grant will be 20 percent of the cost. Working fishermen 
 also are eligible for grants for 25 percent up to a maximiun of tl,000 (US$2,800) 
 for new engines. 

Under the Sea Fish Industry Act, 1951, the White Fish Authority may borrow 
 up to tl5 million (US$42 million) and the Herring Industry Board under its empower- 
 ing legislation up to t2.5 million (US$7 million). These limits have now been 
 raised to L25 million (US$69. 6 million) and fe4 million (US$11 million), respectively. 

The existing white fish subsidy will be continued until March 31, 1958; the 
 total amount allocated for such subsidy is now fc7.5 million (US$20. 9 million) but 
 this limit may be raised to felO million (US$27. 8 million) subject to an affirmative 
 resolution of the House of Commons. 

The grants to be made by the Herring Industry Board towards the cost of new 
 vessels and engines are similar to those of the white-fish industry. Furthermore, 
 the powers of Ministers to make grants to the Board for promoting the sale of her- 
 ring, the conversion of surplus herring to oil and meal, and other purposes will 
 be extended for ten years from the passage of the Bill and the maximum payable is 
 to be raised from tl.5 million to t3 million (US$4. 2 to 8.4 million). The provis- 
 ion for grants for new vessels and engines does not apply to Northern Ireland, but 
 the other provisions relate to the United Kingdom as a whole. A financial memo- 
 randum which accompanied the Bill estimated that during the coming financial year
