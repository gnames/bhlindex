HERRING MARKETING FUND PAYMENTS . 1951/52 ; In the fiscal year ending March31, 
 1952, the Herring Industry Board was advanced 1.95,000 (US.$264,000) from the Her- 
 ring Industry Vote (Government grants), which was applied to loans to fishermen 
 for provisions, reconditioning, and equipment of boats. No advances for these 
 piirposss are scheduled to be made after August 2, 1952. 

Also, from the Herring Marketing Fund the Board was advanced t257,000 
 (US$715,500) for working capital, largely for the herring meal and oil schemes. 
 There were no loans granted during the year for export promotion such as was pre- 
 viously granted British kipper exporters for assistance in breaking into the 
 United States market, reports a January 6 U. S. Embassy dispatch from London.

RUSSIAN FISHERIES STATUS . 1952 : The Russian catch of fish in 1952 was 70 per- 
 cent greater than in 1940, and the capacity (presumably its gross tonnage) of its 
 fishing fleet was 3.2 times that of the prewar fleet, according to a report by 
 a member of the Poli.tburo published in the January 17 issue of The Fishing News, 
 a British trade magazine. By 1955 the capacity of the fishing fleet would be~in- 
 creased to 4o5 times the prewar figure. Before World War II Russian fishermen 
 landed the third largest catch in the world, estimated at 1,560,000 metric tons. 
 Only the United States and Japan surpassed this catch. 

The deep-sea catch amounted to 66 percent of the total 1952 landings as com- 
 pared with the 1940 figure of 48 percent. While the catch off the Murmansk coast 
 and the Baltic Sea was increasing satisfactorily, landings for the Sea of Azov, 
 the Black Sea, the Caspian Sea, and Far Eastern fishing grounds were light. 

There was every possibility that the total catch might be increased at an 
 even higher rate than in the past, and that the output of high-quality fish prod- 
 ucts might also be considerably increased so as to fulfil the assignments of the 
 current Five Year Plan— namely, to raise the catch to more than twice the 1940 
 level. To carry out this task it would be necessary to expand the number of coast- 
 al bases serving the fishing fleet and to build new ones, to build still more fish- 
 processing factories, to increase the mechanization of catching and processing op- 
 erations, and to expand the program for building fishermen's houses. 

A large number of skilled fishery personnel— captains, navigators, and mechan- 
 ics—have been trained in postwar years, though there is still a shortage of such 
 men. There were in 1952 about 12,300 men under training as compared with 740 in 
 1940, stated the member of the Politburo. 

The inland breeding of fish in ponds and reservoirs is another aspect of the 
 fishing industry in the Soviet Union. The construction of the huge hyd-o-electric 
 power stations on the Volga and the Don, as well as on the Dnieper, the Kura and 
 the Amu Darva rivers, had resulted in the establishment of immense reservoirs (in-
