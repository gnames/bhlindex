land fresh-water seas) which if properly developed could be the basis of fish- 
 breeding on a vast scale and would lead to a large increase in stocks of bream, 
 carp, pike, perch, and other fish. 

The changes effected in the river system as a result of the hydro-electric 
 power program, however, would substantially alter the natural conditions of fish 
 propagation in the Caspian and Azov Seas, and would involve the intensive devel- 
 opment of the breeding of the valuable species found there in order to prevent a 
 depletion of stocks. The valuable sturgeon fishery, which was conducted by the 
 Soviet Union \inder an agreement with Iran, is located in the South Caspian. 

Hatcheries and special fish ponds must, therefore, be constructed on a large 
 scale, stated the member of the Politburo. He complained that the Soviet Ministry 
 of Fisheries had been very slow to carry out these measures. Ponds on collective 
 farms are potentially a rich source of fish supplies. A big building program is 
 envisaged. The levels to which the productivity of such ponds could be raised 
 was shown by the experience of fish farms in thi:ee provinces in the Ukraine, where 
 a number had achieved a yield of 1.5 to 2 tons of fish per pond hectare (just over 
 two acres) per year. 

In 1952 the Soviet Union claims that its cold-storage capacity for all frozen 
 foods, including fish, had more than doubled, and that by the end of the current 
 plan in 1955 it would be more than four times that of 1940. Delays in equipping 
 the distribution network with mechanically-operated refrigeration plants were 
 rapidly being overcome. In 1948 there had been 1,650 centers equipped with such 
 plants; in 1952 there were 18,000, and by 1955 it was expected to total 40,000 
 plants. 

The number of self-propelled refrigerator ships — mostly engaged in the fish- 
 ing industry — was more than doubled in 1952, and by 1955 it would reach three 
 times the prewar figure. 

The five-year plan for 1951-55 was considered at the Communist Party confer- 
 ence held in Moscow recently, reports the February 1953 World Fishing , a British 
 trade periodical. It estimates that the production of fish in 1955 will be 58 
 percent greater than in 1950. But it must be remembered that the target figure 
 for the previous five-year plan was not achieved. It was set at 2,250,000 metric 
 tons, but 1950 production was only 1,800,000 tons. 

CANNED MACKEREL QUALITY ENHANCED BY BLANCHING FISH BEFORE FREEZING 

In freezing mackerel for canning it was found that blanching for 7 
 to 8 minutes before freezing enhanced the quality of the canned product. 
 Dipping in ascorbic acid solutions before freezing prevented non-blanched 
 mackerel from becoming rancid, but had no effect on blanched mackerel.
