4. Q. What is a "petition pending" 
 before the stabilization agencies within

A. A petition pending before the sta- 
 bilization agencies is any petition, includ-

 or appeal, properly filed in accordance

 tion on or before February 6, 1953, and 
 not disposed of on or before February 6,

 procedural regulation, has filed a request 
 for further reconsideration of the previ- 
 ous action by the appropriate agency. 
 Is a "petition pending" within the mean-

A. A decision or agreement may now 
 be made to effectuate such adjustment 
 without violating the Defense Production 

Act of 1950, as amended. This does not 
 determine, however, that such retroac- 
 tive payments are or are not permissible 
 tax deductions for the year in which the 
 services paid for were performed ; or that 
 such retroactive payments will neces- 
 sarily be recognized as permissible reim- 
 bursable expense by Government pro- 
 curement agencies, under the statutes 
 applicable to their operations. 

8. Q. A wage, salary, or other com- 
 pensation agreement was executed be- 
 fore February 6, 1953, and provided for 
 adjustments subject to stabilization 
 agency approval, but a petition was not 
 filed with the appropriate agency on or 
 before February 6, 1953. What adjust- 
 ments may now be made? 

A. A decision or agreement may now 
 be made to effectuate such adjustment 
 without violating the Defense Produc- 
 tion Act of 1950, as amended. This does 
 not determine, however, that such retro- 
 active payments are or are not permis- 
 sible tax deductions for the year in which 
 the services paid for were performed; or 
 that such retroactive payments will nec- 
 essarily be recognized as permissible 
 reimbursable expense by Government 
 procurement agencies, under the statutes 
 applicable to their operations. 

9. Q. What effect does Executive 
 Order 10434 have upon enforcement 
 proceedings?

excuse violations committed prior to 

February 6, 1953. The stabilization 

gencies are continuing to process 

enforcement actions.
