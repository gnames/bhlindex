MISSISSIPPI RIVER FISHERIES- -19 50 ANNUAL SUMMARY 

The first complete general canvass of the Mississippi River Fisheries 
 in almost 20 years was conducted by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
 for the year 1950. The last survey of these fisheries was made for the 
 year 1931. 

Landings of fishery products in the Mississippi River and its tribu- 
 taries during 1950 amounted to 105,795,800 pounds, with an ex-vessel value 

of $10,104,129. This was 
 an increase of 28 percent 
 in quantity and 249 per- 
 cent in value as compared 
 with the 1931 landings. 
 Rough fish taken from 
 lake and stream manage- 
 ment programs have been 
 included. Although these 
 fish in many cases were 
 not taken by commercial 
 fishermen, they were mar- 
 keted through commercial 
 channels. Rough fish 
 made up a majority of the catch in some states. There was a marked decrease 
 in the production of mussel shells— in 1931 over 37 million pounds were 
 harvested, but during 1950 only 23 million pounds were reported. Increased 
 use of cheaper synthetic buttons has probably contributed greatly to the 
 decline of this industry. 

During 1950, there were 19,197 fishermen employed in these fisheries 
 as compared with 15,884 in 1931.
