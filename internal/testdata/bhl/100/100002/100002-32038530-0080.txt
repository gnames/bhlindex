British Columbia Catch Statistics 1952 (By Area 
 and Type of Gear) , 131 p., illus. , processed. 
 Department of Fisheries of Canada, Pacific Area, 
 Vancouver 5, B.C. (Limited distribution.) This 
 is the second annual report of fish-catch stat- 
 istics for British Columbia based on the multi- 
 ple sales-slip system that was introduced on a 
 Province-wide basis on January 1, 1951. Statis- 
 tics are presented by species, by months, by 
 year, and by area. The most significant effect 
 on the volume of fish caught in British Colum- 
 bia in 1952 was the decrease in the fishing ef- 
 fort caused by the tie-up of the fishing fleets 
 pending price and other negotiations between the 
 fishermen's union and the operators. There were 

five distinct and separate periods during 1952 
 when fishing activities were curtailed. The 
 first major stoppage occurred when the whaling 
 fleet remained tied up pending a union contract 
 and did not leave port until May 2, nearly four 
 weeks later than in 1951. Despite this, howevar, 
 the total whale catch was the highest for many 
 years. Whaling statistics are not reported on 
 sales slips and are therefore not Included in 
 this suranary. The second tie-up started in 
 Prince Hupert on April 29 when most of the trawl 
 fleet remained in port pending price negotiations 
 and union recognition. This tie-up gradually 
 spread to other parts of the Province and includ- 
 ed most but not all of the trawler fleet. The
