boats finally started returning to the fishing 
 grounds on June 23, but production was seriously 
 curtailed during the tie-up. During the salmon 
 season, the gill-net and seine fleets were tied- 
 up on two separate occasions. From July 20 to 
 July 24, the gill-net and seine fleets remained 
 in port pending price negotiations on pink salm- 
 on. The second tie-up of the salmon gill-net 
 and seine fleet occurred during prolonged nego- 
 tiations on the price of chum salmon. This 
 lasted from September 6 until October 20 and, 
 with the exception of a small number of boats 
 fishing for the cooperatives or for food relief 
 purposes, the tie-up of net fishermen was prac- 
 tically 100 percent effective. The final tie- 
 up during the year affected the herring seine 
 fleet. Due to the drop in the market price for 
 fish oils since the last season, the operators 
 initially offered a lower price per ton to the 
 fishermen for the 1952/53 season as compared with 
 the previous year. This was not acceptable to 
 the fishermen and attempts made at negotiating a 
 price satisfactory to both operators and union 
 were not successful in the closing months of 1952.
