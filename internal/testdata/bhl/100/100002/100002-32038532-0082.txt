Inter- American Tropical Tuna Coomission Annual Re- 
 port for the Years 1950 and 1951 . 58 p. , illua. , 
 printed, in Spanish and English. Inter-American 
 Tropical Tuna Commission, La Jolla, Calif. ,1952, 
 The Convention between the United States of Amer- 
 ica and the Republic of Costa Rica for the estab- 
 lishment of an Inter-American Tropical Tuna Com- 
 mission was signed on May 31, 1949. The purpose of 
 the Convention is to establish a means of cooper- 
 ation in the gathering and interpretation of fac- 
 tual information to facilitate maintaining, at a 
 level which will permit maximum sustained catches, 
 the populations of yellowfin and skipjack tuna, 
 and other fish taken by tuna fishing vessels in 
 the eastern Pacific Ocean. This report describes 
 the functions and duties of the Commission and 
 outlines the program of investigations. It in- 
 cludes a report of the investigations of the Inter- 
 American Tropical Tuna Commission during the year 
 1951, and the text of the Convention betvjeen the 
 UnitedStates of America and the Republic of Costa 
 Rica for the establishment of the Commission. 
 Also included are the enabling legislation passed 
 by the United States Congress, giving effect to 
 the Convention, and the Decree ratifying the Con- 
 vention adopted by the Republic of Costa Rica. 

NEFCO , From Sea To World Markets , by Harry R. Beard, 
 128 p., printed, $1.25. New England Fish Coiig>any, 
 Seattle, Washington, 1953. Although designed pri- 
 marily as a means of publicizing the products and 
 activities of the New England Fish Company, on the 
 occasion of its 85th anniversary, the book con- 
 tains considerable valuable information on the 
 fishing industry. There is accurate and authen- 
 tic information on historical background, catch- 
 ing, packing, freezing, processing, packaging, 
 and marketing of fish and shellfish (including 
 salmon, tuna, crabs, clams, oysters, halibut, cod, 
 rockfishes, flounders, smelt, and herring). Of 
 particular interest are the discussions on what 
 buyers want to know about fresh fish, frozenfish, 
 and canned tuna; and inspecting and grading of 
 canned salmon. General information on the nutri- 
 tional value of fishery products and sources of 
 fishery information are also valuable. Also in- 
 cluded are an interesting history of the develop- 
 ment of the company and its facilities, and a list 
 of its products and how they are produced andmar- 
 keted. Written in the language of the layman, the 
 report makes interesting and informative reading 
 for fish producers, buyers, or consumers. The 
 photographs and illustrations are excellent and 
 were used freely.

 two different types is found in this article. 

(Pacific Marine Fisheries Commission) Fifth Anm'ai 
 Report of the Pacific Marine Fisheries Ccmmission 
 for the Year 1952 (To the Congress of the United 
 States and the Governors and Legislatures of 
 Washington, Oregon, and California), 19 p., printed. 
 Pacific Marine Fisheries Commission, Portland, 
 Oregon. Describes briefly the activities of the 
 Commission and contains a short resume of the one 
 meeting of the Commission during 1952. Also in- 
 cluded are summaries of reports submitted by the 
 participating agencies on the research conducted 
 in 1952 on the following marine species and fish- 
 eries: ocean salmon, albaoore tuna, sablefish 
 (black cod), the otter-trawl fishery, and pollu- 
 tion research. In addition, a financial report of 
 the Commission appears in the report. 

(Scotland) The Food of Halibut from North Atlantic 
 Fishing Grounds , by A. D. liclntyre, Ilarine Re- 
 search 1952 No. 3, 22 p. , illus., printed, 4s. 
 l^ii. (about 58 U.S. cents). Scottish Home Depart- 
 ment (Available from Her Majesty's Stationery 
 Office, Edinburgh, Scotland), 1953. Describes the 
 food of the North Atlantic halibut, based on the 
 examination of 1,225 stomachs, mostly from the 
 waters around Iceland and Faroe. The halibut had 
 been feeding mainly on fish, decapod Crustacea, 
 and cephalopoda, according t.o this report. A 
 change in feeding with age, from a more or less 
 mixed diet in the younger specimens to an almost 
 entirely fish diet in the adults is suggested, 
 particularly off Iceland. The feeding intensity is 
 greater in sumner than in spring. The small number 
 of species required to support the halibut popula- 
 tion is noted, and the importance of Sebastes mar- 
 inus discussed. The feeding habits are considered 
 and some of the factors connected with a fish tak- 
 ing bait are analyzed. 

(Scotland) Haddock Bionomics â€” 1. The State of the 
 Haddock Stocks in the North Sea 1946 -50 and at 
 Faroe 1914 -50. by B. B. Parrish and R. Jones, Ma- 
 rine Research 1952 No. 4, 27 p., illus., printed, 
 5s. Igd. (about 72 U.S. cents). Scottish Home 
 Department (Available from Her Majesty's Stationery 
 Office, Edinburgh, Scotland), 1953. The first in 
 a series entitled "Haddock Bionomics," this public- 
 ation is an attempt to apply theoretical models to 
 fish population problems developed on precise con- 
 cepts of "overfishing," "maximum yield," and "maxi- 
 mum fishing intensity," earlier formulated. To 
 the authors, the concept of "maximum fishing inten- 
 sity" is the most important element in biological 
 overfishing, and can be defined as "...that fish- 
 ing intensity which, when operative in a given a- 
 rea, on a self-contained fish stock over a number 
 of years during which recruitment has been rela- 
 tively steady, would give the maximum sustained 
 yield from that area. When the fishing intensity 
 increases above that level which gives rise to the 
 maximum sustained yield from the gear in use then 
 the stock is, on this definition, being 'overfished',"
