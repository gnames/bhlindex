The authors conclude, "The particular merits of 
 this definition are (1) thtit it is independent 
 of political or eoononic factors, which deter- 
 mine the profitableness of fishing to the indi- 
 vidual fishermen and which may fluctuate widely 
 from year to year, and (2) that the maximum 
 yield can be determined from population data and 
 is characteristic of each self-contained fish 
 stock subject to commercial exploitation. Nec- 
 essarily, it depends upon the method or methods 
 of fishing." This study is the result of the 
 assessment of the haddock stocks on the Faroe 
 Plateau and in the North Sea since 1914 and 1946, 
 respectively, by the use of mathematical models 
 to determine the present level of yield in re- 
 lation to the maximum yield, based on the bio- 
 logical concepts which are more reliable than the 
 interpretation of commercial statistics alone. 

Seasonal and Vertical Patterns of Oyster Setting off 

Madmalp.w Island , £. C. , by J, Kneeland McNulty7 
 Coptributions from Bears Bluff Laboratories No. 
 15, 19 p., illus, , printed. Bears Bluff Labora- 
 tories, VJadmalaw Island, S. C. , January 1953. De- 
 scribes seasonal and vertical patterns of oyster 
 setting as estimated from semimonthly spat counts 
 of cultoh exposed at various vertical elevations 
 during two setting seasons at three stations near 
 Bears Bluff Laboratories, w'admalaw Island. Spat- 
 fall in excess of one percent of the seasonal to- 
 tal can be expected from early May through early 
 October, subject to annual variations of about 
 two v;eeks. Two setting pulses can be expected 
 each season, the first from early June through 
 early July and the second, of lesser intensity, 
 sone time in August or early September, with set- 
 ting of considerable intensity occurring before, 
 between, and after these maxima. A vertical dif- 
 ference of about 2 feet has been detected in the 
 zone of maximum setting at £ stations, about 2.8 
 and 8.3 nautical miles distant from the sea. As 
 measured from mean lov; tide level, maximum set- 
 ting occurred at about minus 1 foot at the more 

seaward station and at about plus 1 foot at the 
 other station. Setting below low-water mark to 
 a depth of 7 feet was continuous from about Ju- 
 ly 1 until about September 15, 1952, at the sta- 
 tion investigated. Spatfall intensity at minus 
 3, 5, and 7 feet averaged about 1.5 times less 
 than intensity at minus 1 foot and about 4 times 
 less than at plus 1 foot. Rapid fouling of clean 
 cultoh below low-water mark with bryozoa and silt 
 is suggested as a major factor in reduced setting 
 below low-water mark. 

Years of Progress 1945-19a2 (U. £. Department of 
 the Interior ) , 197 p., illus., printed, $1.25 
 (paper) . [Tor sale by the Superintendent of Doc- 
 uments, Washington £5, D. C. ) This publication 
 reports on the progress in the utilization and 
 conservation of our natural resources and the 
 contributions of the various agencies (including 
 the Fish and Wildlife Service and the Defense 
 Fisheries Administration) of the Department of 
 the Interior during the period 1945-52. It is 
 divided into major sections by major resources — 
 (1) Water 2nd Power, (2) Mineral Resources, and 
 (3) The Land of America. The latter section in- 
 cludes, among others, a report of the Fish and 
 Wildlife Service v;ith specific discussions on 
 utilization of fishery resources (including a 
 description of the contributions of the Br.-.nch 
 of Commercial Fisheries); disaster caused by the 
 sea lamprey in the Great Lakes fisheries; Alaska 
 fisheries administration; maintenance of inland 
 fishorles; aid to the states in fish and wildlife 
 conservation, river basin studies, protection of 
 wildlife resources; and other activities. Other 
 major sections of this publication are (1) The 
 Defense Agencies of the Department, (2) Depart- 
 mental Management, (3) Foreign and International 
 Affairs, and (4) The Controversy Over the Conti- 
 nental Shelf. The first of these sections in- 
 cludes a description of the Defense Fisheries Ad- 
 ministration's progress since its establishment 
 In 1950.
