WHAT DO CONSUMERS LIKE ABOUT FROZEN FISH? 

"Ease of preparation" is the most liked feature of frozen fish. This 
 was brought out in the recently published results of a national consumer 
 survey ( Fish and Shellfish Preferences of Household Consumers ) made by the 
 U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service during 1951, It was mentioned by nearly 
 half (42 percent) of those asked: "What do you particularly like about 
 frozen fish?" 

"Taste" ranked second in importance, with 23 percent saying that they 
 particularly liked frozen fish for this reason. The "price" of frozen fish 

surprisingly ranked 
 far below many other 
 features, with only 
 3 percent mentioning 
 it. "Ease of stor- 
 ing" frozen fish in 
 the refrigerator (cit- 
 ed by 12 percent of 
 the respondents) was 
 third in importance. 
 "Ready availability" 
 (liked by 6^ percent) , 
 "lack of bones" (5 
 percent) , and its "ad- 
 dition of variety" 
 to the diet (5g- per- 
 cent) were all ad- 
 vantages of frozen 
 fish more frequently 
 mentioned than its 
 economy. 

Analysis of the 
 replies by geographic 
 areas of the country (Northeast, North Central, South, and West) gave quite 
 similar rankings to the main reasons for frozen fish being liked. "Ease of 
 preparation" and "taste" ranked one and two, respectively, in all areas. 
 "Ease of storage" was third everywhere except in the South, where it dropped 
 to fourth place with "easy availability" third. 

The fourth ranking virtue of frozen fish in both the Northeast and 
 West was considered to be the "variety" which it could add to the diet. 
 However, in the North Central area people considered the "absence of bones" 
 as being fourth in importance.
