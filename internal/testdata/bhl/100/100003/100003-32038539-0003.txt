 NOTE: ONLY THE SEA SCALLOP'S LARGE MUSCLE THAT CONTROLS TflE SHELL MOVEMENTS IS MARKETED. 

SCALLOPS ARE SHUCKED AND THE LARGE MUSCLES ( CALLED EYES ) CUT OUT ABOARD THE VESSEL, BUT THE 
 REMAINDER IS GENERALLY DISCARDED. THEREFORE, THE SCALLOP MEATS LANDED REPRESENT ONLY A SMALL 
 PROPORTION OF THE GROSS OR NET WEIGHT OF THE SCALLOPS.
