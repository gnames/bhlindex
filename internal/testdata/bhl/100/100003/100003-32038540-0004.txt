INTRODUCTION 

The giant or sea scallop, Pecten grandis (Solander),^/ is today one of New 
 England's major fishery resources. The past two decades have witnessed about a 

tenfold rise in production â€” al- 
 most 20 million pounds of scal- 
 lop meats, valued in excess of 
 9 million dollars, were landed 
 in the peak year of 1950. 

The industry has in past 
 years expressed concern for the 
 future of the fishery,, Although 
 the over-all production trend 
 has been upward, there has been 
 a general belief among scallop 
 fishermen that production was 
 maintained at the expense of de- 
 pletion of certain grounds .and 
 that the present rate of fishing 
 would result in ultimate deple- 
 tion of all areas. Fishermen 
 have reported that in many areas 
 they are forced to work longer 
 to get a trip.

Recognizing the need for a more adequate knowledge of this fishery, the U. S. 
 Fish and Wildlife Service in July 1943 instituted routine collection of data rela- 
 tive to the fishery at New Bedford, Mass., now the world's largest sea scallop port. 
 Since that date, skippers of scallop draggers landing at the port of New Bedford 
 have been interviewed by a representative of the Fish and Wildlife Service. The 
 information obtained includes the sailing and landing date, grounds and depths 
 fished, actual fishing time, 3/ and quantity of scallop meats landed. From these 
 basic data it is now possible to present a general picture of the activities of 
 the scallop fleet as it has shifted from ground to ground and to obtain some in- 
 formation on the changing abundance of scallops in different areas during the past 
 nine years. 

Members of the scallop industry have asked that some regulation be applied 
 to the fishery in order to insure maintenance of the high productivity which has 
 characterized the operations over the past years. Before any recommendations for 
 conservation measures can be made, two basic questions must be answered: (l) Are 
 there signs of depletion on the scallop grounds? (2) How long can the grounds 
 withstand present fishing intensity? 

An answer to the first question can be given on the basis of the interview 
 data collected over the past nine years. The second question cannot be fully an- 
 swereduntil more is learned about the biology of the sea scallop. 

UNITED STATES LANDINGS 

In table 1 are tabulated the United States landings of sea scallops (meats 
 only) by state and region for all ye ars since 1889 for which records are available. 

2/THE CORRECT SCIENTIFIC NAME OF THE SEA SCALLOP HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF CONSIDERABLE DEBATE. 
 MODERN TAXONOMISTS SEEM TO AGREE ON PECTEN GRAND IS (SOLANDER). OTHER NAMES FOUND IN LITERA- 
 TURE ARE P. n MAGELLANICUS (GMELIN) AND P. TENUI COSTATUS (MIGHELs). 

3/ DAYS FISHED AS USED IN THIS REPORT INCLUDES TIME ^PENT IN r| ACTUAL FISHING AND MOVEMENT FROM
