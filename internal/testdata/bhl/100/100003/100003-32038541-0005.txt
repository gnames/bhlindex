May 1953 COMMERCIAL FISHERIES REVIEW 3 

There are only sporadic records from 1889 to 1929. From 1929 to the present the 
 records are fairly complete,, The variations in U. S. landings from 1929 through 
 1952 are shown graphically in figure 3o

FIGURE 3 - TOTAL UNITED STATES LANDINGS OF SEA SCALLOPS (MEATS ONLY), 1929-52. 

We note that landings rose from slightly over 2 million pounds of scallop 
 meats in 1929 (the first year for which we have complete statistics) to almost 20 
 million pounds in 1950, reaching an initial peak of about 10 million pounds in 1939, 
 dropping during World War II to slightly less than 5 million pounds in 1944, and 
 then rising rapidly to the peak in 1950. Landings decreased in 1951, and in 1952 
 dropped to about 17 million pounds — the lowest since 1948. 

COMPARISON BY REGIONS : In the early years of the fishery by far the greatest 
 portion of the United States sea-scallop catch was landed in the New England States, 
 but with the discovery of scallop beds off Long Island in the early 1920' s, the 
 Middle Atlantic ports assumed leadership. Many of the boats fishing theNew England 
 area (principally off the Maine coast) moved their base of operations. It was not 
 until the middle 1930' s that the New England landings again exceeded the Middle 
 Atlantic catch. This was not due to a shift from Middle Atlantic ports because the 
 landings in these ports also increased up to 1938. 

The increased landings in New England were due to the discovery of scallop 
 beds on Georges Bank and the development of markets for the Droduct. Most of this 
 catch was landed in Massachusetts ports. As indicated in table 1, Massachusetts
