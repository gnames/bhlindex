LANDINGS REPORTED. 

During World War II New England production declined, then picked up again in 
 1946, and increased to an all-time record of almost 15 million pounds in 1952. 

Most of the postwar production in New England 
 was landed in the nort of New Bedford, Massa- 
 chusetts. 

Middle Atlantic landings after the War 
 rose to a peak of over 6 million pounds in 1950 
 and then declined to a little over 2 million 
 pounds in 1952. 

NEW BEDFORD LANDINGS AND FISHING AREAS 

The principal scallop port for many years, 
 especially since 1941, has been New Bedford. 
 Landings at this port are compared with those 
 for the entire Atlantic Coast for the years 
 1938 through 1952 in table 2. Most of the 
 studies included in this report are based on an 
 analysis of landings in New Bedford from 1944 
 through 1952, during which period New Bedford 
 received from 60 to 82 percent of the total At- 
 lantic Coast scallop production. 

Scallops landed at New Bedford are taken 
 largely from eight of the statistical subareas
