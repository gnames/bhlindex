by the relative productivity of adjacent areas. It is, therefore, possible that 
 a productive area may be neglected for some period of time if neighboring areas 
 are found to be more profitably fished. 

STELLWAGEN OR MIDDLE BANK ( Statistical Subarea XXII- E) : This area contributes 
 very little to the landings at New Bedford. In only one of the nine years under

consideration was more than 1 percent of the total catch landed from this area. 
 The fishery on Stellwagen Bank is conducted chiefly by the smaller vessels oper- 
 ating out of Provincetown and other Cape Cod ports. 

WESTERN SIDE OF SOUT H CHANNE L ( Statistical Subarea XXI1-G ): The beds in this 
 area are located in the vicinity of #10 Buoy, Half-Moon Shoal, and along the Bottom 
 of South Channel. In 1944, 6 percent of the total catch came from this area. In 
 subsequent years, the contribution of this area increased, until more than 20 per- 
 cent of the total came from here in 1949. The production from this area decreased 

slightly in 1950 and 1951, and 
 then increased again in 1952, 
 with almost 23 percent of the 
 catch originating here in that 
 year. 

CULTIVATOR SHOALS ( Statis - 
 tical Subarea XXII -H ) : This 
 ground contributed 10 percent of 
 the catch in 1944, 18 percent in 
 1945, and about 11 percent in 
 each of the next two years. Sub- 
 sequent years saw only minor land- 
 ings from this area. An increase 
 was noted in 1951, when more than 
 6 percent of the total catch came 
 from this area, but in 1952 the 
 catch from this ground dropped 
 again.
