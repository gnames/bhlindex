COMMERCIAL FISHERIES REVIEW 

NORTHERN EDGE ( Statistical Subarea XXII-J) : In the earlier years, 1944-47, 
 this was the most important scallop area, accounting for 45 to 70 percent of the 
 catch. In each of the next two years, 1948 and 1949, this area contributedbetween 
 36 and 37 percent of the catch, and in 1950 about 18 percent. During the next two 
 years production increased. In 1952 over 40 percent of the total catch came from 
 hereÂ« 

SOUTHEAST GEORGES ( Statistical Subarea XXI I -M ) : These beds accounted for 10 
 percent of the total catch in 1944, but in subsequent years a considerable decline 
 in landings was noted, until 1947 when less than 1 percent of the total catch came 
 from here. In 1948 there was a tremendous increase, with almost 23 percent of the 
 total catch coming from these beds. In following years the landings from this area 
 varied greatly, declining to about 1 percent in 1949 and jumping to over 26 percent 
 of the New Bedford landings in 1952. 

SOUTHWEST GEORGES ( Statistical Subarea XXII-N ) : Only 3 percent of the catch 
 was landed from this area in 1944 and 1945, but in 1946 more than 26 percent of 
 the total originated here. The next two years landings from this area were prac- 
 tically nil. In 1949, 4 percent came from this area, and in 1950 and 1951, 23 and 
 30 percent, respectively. In 1952 less than 7 percent of the New Bedford catch 
 originated here. 

NANTUCKET SHOALS ( Statistical Subarea XXII-0 ) : During 1944-46, the contribu- 
 tion of this area fluctuated between 8 and 14 percent. In 1947 it dropped to less 
 than 4 percent. From 1948-50, the contribution of this area ranged from about 21 
 to 33 percent. The following two years the contribution of these beds declined to 
 about 12 percent in 1951 and 2 percent in 1952. 

OFF FIRE ISLAND INLET ( Statistical Area XXIII ); These beds off Long Island, 
 SE. of Ambrose Light, are fished very little by the New Bedford fleet, but have 
 been important to the New York scallop fleet. In none of the years, 1944-52, does 
 the contribution of these beds exceed 2 percent of the total scallop catch landed 
 at New Bedford. 

ABUNDANCE 

Landings alone do not tell us much about the relative abundance of scallops 
 on the grounds. Landings have been artifically controlled by agreements among the 
 fishermen. The union has prescribed a catch limit of 100 gallons (900 pounds) of 
 scallop meats per man per trip during most of the period of this study. In the 
 early part of the period the limit was 150 gallons (1,350 pounds). The union rules
