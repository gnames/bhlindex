further required that boats engage in actual fishing operations for not more than 
 8 days and that they remain in port 2 to 4 days between trips. However, these 
 regulations have not been in force since the latter part of 1952. 

Throughout the period of this study the scallop boats were able t-o catch the 
 established limit in less than eight days, except during periods of unfavorable 
 weather. We are thus afforded two measures of abundance: the catch per-unit-of- 
 effort and the number of fishing days required to catch the prescribed limit.

FIGURE 7 - CATCH PER BOAT PER DAY ( I N THOUSANDS OF POUNDS) FOR THE NEW BEDFORD SEA-SCALLOP 
 FLEET, 1944-52. 

The first index, catch per boat per day, is shown in the last column of table 4 
 and is plotted in fig. 7. It will be noted that this index varies very little 
 throughout the period of study except for the years 1948 and 1949 when the index 
 was somewhat lower. 

The other index, average number of days fished per trip, was also remarkably 
 uniform (column 5, table 4). 

One must conclude from these data that there has not been a serious depletion 
 of scallops in the Atlantic banks considering the area as a whole. It must be borne 
 in mind that these figures are for landings at New Bedford regardless of area fished. 

Since the fleet shifts its effort from place to place in order to continue op- 
 erations in the best fishing areas it is desirable to examine abundance indexes ac- 
 cording to particular regions. 

In table 5 are tabulated the catches per day for statistical subareas from 
 1944 through 1952. The outstanding feature of this table is the uniformityof catch 
 per day throughout the various areas and years. Most catches are between 1,200 and 
 1,800 pounds per day. In only two areas did the catch per day drop below 1,000
