 Island Inlet in 1947, but these areas were never important to the New Bedford fleet. 
 Neither area contributed as much as 2 percent of the catch during the study period. 

One possibly significant fact emerges from the data in this table. The two 
 years, 1948 and 1949, which were low years in the index calculated for all banks,

1/lNSUFFICIENT FISHING TO COMPUTE 

A RELIABLE INDEX. 

are years in which the index is generally low for each area. It might possibly 
 mean that factors which control the abundance of scallops in one particular area 
 have similar effects throughout the entire area of Georges Bank and Nantucket 
 Shoals. 

There is no evidence, however, that any areas were overfished during this 
 period. If one area could not provide the catch limit in a few days' fishing, other 
 areas were found that could. Thus the effort in any one area was adjusted to its 
 productive capacity. The result is that catch-per-day was maintained for all im- 
 portant areas. 

The relative abundance of scallops in the area fished by the New Bedford fleet 
 during the nine-year period are shown graphically in figures 8a-8i. In the analysis 
 of the interview data, catch per day was computed for each unit area (areas bounded 
 by 10 minutes of latitude and 10 minutes of longitude). These figures (8a r 8i) show 
 very clearly how the areas fished fluctuated from year to year. In no two years 
 were exactly the same beds fished. There was a constant shifting from one area to 
 another but Georges Bank as a whole maintained its productive capacity (with a 
 slight recession in 1947 and 1948) . 

The only conclusion that can be drawn from the above studies is that there has 
 been no over-all depletion of scallops on Georges Bank and nearby areas. Although 
 individual beds may have been fished out, there have always been other beds avail- 
 able to insure all vessels catching their limits, The value of the catch limit in 
 the conservation of the sea scallop cannot be assessed at this time. Whether the 
 banks could have withstood greater fishing pressure during the past nine years will 
 always be a matter of conjecture. 

THE FUTURE OF THE SCALLOP FISHERY 

These studies of catch and effort records show that there has not been any 
 serious depletion of scallop grounds up to 1953. The question of how long the beds 
 can withstand present fishing intensity or whether they can withstand an expanded 
 fishery cannot be answered from catch and effort statistics alone. To answerthese 
 questions it is necessary to have certain biological facts concerning the species. 
 Unfortunately the necessary facts are lacking in the case of the Georges Bank scal- 
 lop fishery.
