The Canadians have learned much about the Digby scallops (Dickie 1950, 1951, 
 1952, and Medcof 1948, 1952) but this information cannot be applied to the same 
 species in other areas. As the result of these studies, there is reasonably good 
 information available on growth rates, age composition of the stock, catches, and 
 fishing effort for the Canadian fishery. 

Canadian scientists have found it possible to relate changes in landings di- 
 rectly to changes in abundance, and abundance in turn to variation in bottom water 
 temperature. Periods of high and low abundance correspond fairly well with periods 
 of warm and cold water, respectively, indicating that water temperature during the 
 spawning season is a major factor in regulating the abundance of seed scallops pro- 
 duced in any year and landings of the fishery years later when these scallops reach 
 commercial size. Canadian biologists claim they will be able to forecast periods 
 of high and low abundance. 

The Canadians also claim that protection of small scallops maintains the yield 
 of the fishery at a higher long-term level than would unrestricted fishing. Canada 
 has prescribed a legal size limit of 4 inches (shell diameter) for many years. 
 This limit has proved difficult to enforce because scallops are shucked at sea and 
 the shells discarded. Canadian scientists have, therefore, begun work on scallop 
 savings gear to facilitate the escape of undersized individuals. 

Posgay (1950) has summarized our knowledge of the biology of the Georges Bank 
 stocks. Basic information necessary for the conservation of the stocks is lacking. 

The spawning season is uncertain. The sexes are separate and fertilization 
 takes place in the water. Ripe males and females are found from early spring until
