16 COMMERCIAL FISHERIES REVIEW Vol. 15, No. 5 

The age and growth of Georges Bank scallops are imperfectly known. The con- 
 centric rings which in some molluscs (including the sea scallop in Canada) reveal 
 the annual growth have in our sea scallops never been satisfactorily interpreted 
 in relation to age. An alternative method of determining growth is by repeated 
 examination and measurement of samples taken from the same population. Thismethod 
 might be used in the case of scallops, but would require the use of a research 
 vessel for repeated samplings seasonally for several years. 

Posgay is of the opinion that our sea scallop grows to a length of about 40 
 mm. (1|5 inches) in the first year, 80 mm. (3-1/8 inches) in the second year, 110 
 mm. (4-1/3 inches) the third year, and thereafter grows more slowly. Misestimates, 
 however, are based on very sketchy evidence. We do not yet have sufficient infor- 
 mation on growth to hazard an opinion on how long it would take a new set to reach 
 commercial size. 

Conversely, we do not know the natural mortality rates of these shellfish. 
 Should they be fished as soon as they are of marketable size or would it pay to 
 leave them to grow a little larger? Without this information we cannot recommend 
 management procedures. 

The importance of motility in scallops has always been of interest. Scallops 
 can swim quite actively by clapping their shells together. The young appear to be 
 more active than older individuals. The scallop beds seem to be on rather loose 
 sand, in depressions in a level surface, on the edge of a shoal, or where a slop- 
 ing surface becomes steeper (Posgay 1950). 'Whether sea scallops actively seek 
 such places or are concentrated there by currents is not known. 

There is a belief among some fishermen that scallops have a tendency to con- 
 gregate and that beds will recover if left undisturbed for a period of time. A 
 closed season is sometimes advocated on this basis but there is no experimental 
 evidence to substantiate this opinion. 'We cannot at this time predict the effect 
 of a cessation of fishing. 

An extensive tagging program might shed some light on problems of growth and 
 migration. No large-scale project has been undertaken, although Baird (1952) tagged 
 2,000 scallops in the past two years and has had some returns. His results are 
 not available. Members of the Fish and Wildlife Service tagged 198 specimens on 
 Southwest Georges in 1949 and 200 in 1950. Only one tag has been recovered to date. 
 The tagged specimen was taken near its release point about 2 years after tagging. 
 It had grown 3/4-inch. 

SUMMARY 

United States landings of sea scallops (meats) increased from about 2 million 
 pounds in 1929 to about 20 million pounds in 1950, and then decreased to about 17 
 million pounds in 1952. 

Most of the postwar production of sea scallops has been landed at the port of 
 New Bedford, Mass. An analysis of catch and effort data collected at this port 
 from 1944 to 1952 reveals that there was no serious depletion of scallops on Georges 
 Bank and nearby areas during that period. 

The future of the scallop fishery is uncertain. The biology of the scallops 
 fished by UnitedStates vessels is too imperfectly known to form the basis of any 
 predictions of the effects of different intensities of fishing.
