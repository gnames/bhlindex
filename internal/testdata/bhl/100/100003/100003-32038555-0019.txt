DO YOU KNOW THAT. 

A total of 4,112,000 pounds of scallop meats (includes both sea and bay scallops) were 
 frozen in the United States during 1952 — slightly less than the 4,705,000 
 pounds frozen in 1951. 

Of the total amount frozen in 1952, 3,481,000 pounds were frozen in 
 the New England States, 536,000 pounds in the Middle Atlantic States, 
 74,000 pounds in the South Atlantic States, and the balance in the South 
 Central and Pacific States.
