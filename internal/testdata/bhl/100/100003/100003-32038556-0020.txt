SALMON TAGGING BY THE 1952 JAPANESE NORTH PACIFIC 

FISHING EXPEDITION 

By C. J. Burner* 

The Japanese re-entered the salmon fisheries of the North Pacific Ocean west 
 of longitude 175° W. during 1952V with a fleet of 3 motherships and 50 catcher 
 boats. Accompanying and patrolling the fleet were three fully-equipped and heavily- 
 staffed oceanographic-exploratory research vessels of the Japanese Fisheries Agency. 
 These ships ranged 400 miles or more from the mothership in all directions. Their 
 purpose was to keep the fishing fleet within the area of operations authorized by 
 the Japanese Government and to recommend fishing areas on the basis of abundance of 
 plankton and suitable temperatures. Thus, in 1952 the Japanese fleet fished south 
 of the Aleutians because the sea north of the chain was considered too cold. In 
 addition to standard oceanographic equipment, the three vessels carried nets and 
 long lines for exploratory-fishing and salmon-tagging operations. 

The tagging experiments done by the Japanese, while limited and inconclusive, 
 clearly demonstrate that salmon can be taken in numbers and good enough condition 
 for marking or tagging on the high seas. 

Since a Bering Sea and North Pacific tagging experiment to determine the degree 
 of mixing or demarcation of Asiatic and Alaska stocks of salmon is being considered 
 by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the methods and results of the Japanese tag- 
 ging are of considerable interest. A summary of the results of the tagging done in 
 the North Pacific in 1952 was prepared by the Japanese Fisheries Agency and forwarded 
 by William C. Neville, Fisheries Attache at the United States Embassy at Tokyo, Japan.
