According to the report, 2,419 salmon were tagged between May 20 and June 18, 
 1952. Of this number 1,175 were chum salmon ( Oncorhynchus keta) , and 1,244 were 
 red salmon ( Oncorhynchus nerka ) . The tag used was a red (on red salmon) and a pink 
 (on chum salmon) celluloid oval stamped with the letters JFA (Japanese Fisheries 
 Agency), the year, and a serial number on the reverse side. It was attached to the 
 fish with a 0.4 mm. silver-coated copper wire so that it encircled the caudal pe- 
 duncle like a bracelet (see fig. 1). The tags are "dished" slightly to conform to 
 the body curve of the fish. 

The size of the fish tagged is given as 45 cm. to 65 cm. , with a 55 cm. mean, 
 on the basis of "forked length." This is for both species. It is possible, there- 
 fore, that all salmon tagged were mature and in the spawning year. No further data 
 are given. 

The Agency reports that gill nets were used to capture the fish prior to tag- 
 ging. However, in conversations aboard the Tenyo Maru , the United States biologist 
 F. M. Fukuhara obtained the distinct impression that long lines were also used, and 
 that salmon thus caught were in much better condition for tagging. The Agency re- 
 ports that long lines were fished, found unsuccessful, and not used for actual tag- 
 ging. Dates and locations of tagging are given in the table. 

Of the 2,419 salmon tagged, three fish were actually recovered in the Japanese 
 nets, but one of them escaped. The two recaptures were chum salmon tagged on June 2 

and retaken on June 5 at 

the following locations: 
 Tag No. 3 (pink color) at 
 50°29' N. latitude, 177^45' 
 W. longitude} and Tag No. 
 1206 (pink color) at50°28» 
 N. latitude, 177°45' W. 
 longitude. Both fish swam 
 approximately 14 miles in 
 a northwesterly direction 
 toward Kiska Island before 
 recapture, assuming straight- 
 line movement. 

Two tags (numbers un- 
 known) were reported on red salmon passing through the weir at Egegik River, Bristol 
 Bay, on July 1 and July 7, respectively. These tags were not recovered, but the de- 
 tailed description given by the weir watchman gives some indication that the tags 
 were placed on the fish by the Japanese Fisheries Agency a month or so earlier and 
 about 1,000 miles away. 

No conclusions are drawn by the Agency or by the Service. The few returns and 
 the short distance traveled by chum salmon preclude any attempt to define the migra- 
 tory behavior, or to distinguish the stocks of salmon in the North Pacific Ocean. 

CORRECTIONS 

The following errors occurred in the article "Japanese 1952 North Pacific Salmon- 
 Fishing Expedition" by Francis M. Fukuhara, Commercial Fisheries Review , vol. 15, 
 no. 2 (February 1953): 

Page 1, paragraph 1, line 5 -"north of Atka Island" should read "west of Atka 

Island" 
 Page 4, last paragraph, line 3 -"400 miles south of Kiska" should read "90 miles 

south of Kiska."
