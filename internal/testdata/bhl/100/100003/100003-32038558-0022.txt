REFRIGERATION ; Freezing Fish at Sea , Defrosting , Filleting ;, and Refreezing 
 the Fillets : VESSEL OPERATIONS: The Delaware remained dry-docked at the ship- 
 yard in Chelsea, Mass., during which time it was painted and overhauled and the 
 brine-freezer tank was modified. 

LABORATORY STUDIES: Further tests were carried out on dipping fillets in 
 brine. From a local trawler 600 pounds of gutted scrod haddock were obtained and 
 stored in ice at the laboratory. At intervals of 1, 5, and 10 days, one-third of 
 the lot was filleted, dipped in brine, packaged, frozen, and later examined (table l) .

VARIES INVERSELY 

WITH TENDERNESS OF FILLETS. 




The tests indicated that storage of the fish in ice for various periods prior to 
 filleting has little effect upon the fillets dipped in brine from the standpoints 
 of salt absorption and weight increase, or upon tenderometer value, press drip, or 
 press drip solids of the thawed frozen fillets. The dipped fillets from fish stored 
 in ice for 10 days upon freezing and thawing showed lower apparent free-drip val- 
 ues as compared with the dipped fillets from fish stored in ice for 1 or 5 days. 

The effect of brine temperature and time of immersion on the absorption of 
 salt by whole scrod haddock during the freezing process was studied on a laborato- 
 ry scale. Whole scrod haddock were procured from a local trawler about 24 hours
