 solution for one hour at various temperatures. The effect of brine temperature 
 on the penetration of salt into the fish is shown in table 2.

The results indicate that freezing the whole scrod haddock at 10° F. or be- 
 low produces much lower salt penetration in the fish than freezing at temperatures 
 above 10° F. 

Table 3 shows the effect of immersion time of the fish on the salt penetra- 
 tion. The results indicate an initial high rate of salt penetration in the first 
 l/4-inch of flesh during the first hour of freezing. Further absorption continued 
 at a much reduced rate, particularly at the lower temperatures.

Results of prolonged immersion-freezing in 23-percent salt solution is shown 
 in table 4. 

Thawing was first noticeable as a very slight softening of the skin of the 
 fish. As salt continued to penetrate into the flesh, thawing or softening occurred 
 at greater depths. Shrinkage, due apparently to loss of water from the fish, was 
 observed after 48 hours of immersion of the fish and eventually became so great as 
 to cause outlines of the muscular striations to appear on the skin. After four
