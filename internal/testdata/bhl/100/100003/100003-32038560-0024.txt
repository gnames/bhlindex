days the tail section became pliable; this condition spread slowly to about one- 
 third the length of the fish at the time the test was terminated. The fish im- 
 mersed for 24 hours would not take a glaze due to the high salt content of the 
 surface layer of the fish.

Freezing , Glazing , and Thawing Salmon to be Canned : Examination was made of 
 four lots of canned sockeye salmon prepared last fall from fresh (unfrozen) fish, 
 and from frozen fish containing varying amounts of added salmon oil. The purpose 
 of the test was to determine the amount of curd formation and appearance of the 
 final product when salmon oil is added to canned salmon (prior to sealing and proc- 
 essing) prepared from frozen fish. Six l/2-flat cans of each of the following four 
 lots of canned sockeye salmon were examined: 

1. Prepared from brine-frozen fish — salt added. 

2. Prepared from brine-frozen fish — salt and 3 milliliters 

of salmon oil added to each l/2-flat can. 

3. Prepared from brine-frozen fish — salt and 6 milliliters 

of salmon oil added to each 1/2-flat can. 

4. Prepared commercially from fresh (unfrozen) fish — salt 

added. 

The results are shown in table 1.

J/PENETROMETER VALUE VARIES INVERSELY WITH THE FIRMNESS OF THE PRODUCT. 

In comparison with lot 4 (prepared from fresh fish), lot 1 (prepared from 
 brine-frozen fish) had on the average a smaller volume of free aqueous liquid and 
 free oil, and a lower penetrometer reading (or firmer texture). Lot 4 possessed 
 a natural salmon flavor and odor and had only a trace of curd. Lotl had lost some
