of the natural flavor and odor and some of the samples showed incipient rancidity; 
 had a firm texture, which was not considered too objectionable; and had a moderate 
 amount of curd, which lowered the appearance rating. Although a definite differ- 
 ence in texture between the two lots (1 and 4) was found by both organoleptic ex- 
 amination and penetrometer tests, some of the difference may have been due to the 
 method of packing. Lot 1 was hand packed while lot 4 was machine packed commer- 
 cially. 

Adding natural salmon oil to each can (lots 2 and 3) increased the amount of 
 free oil in the final product; however, the curd appeared in more compact layers 
 and made the appearance of the fish in the can less desirable. 

ANALYSIS AND COMPOSITION : 
 mination of Oil in Fish Meal: 

Cooperative Work with the A.O.A.C. on the Deter - 
 Work has been resumed on this project in an effort 

to develop a simple and rapid procedure for the determination of oil in fish meal. 
 Chemists in the industry have indicated that the acetone extraction method, de- 
 veloped some time ago and now a tentative A.O.A.C. method, consumes too much time. 
 In the earlier work, it was found that acid hydrolysis did not completely digest 
 the fish meal to the extent that it does fish flesh. The tests now under way are 
 designed to determine whether or not the acid hydrolysis procedure can be improved 
 to provide complete hydrolysis of the meal and effect more accurate oil determina- 
 tions. Preliminary tests indicate that more complete hydrolysis of the meal is 
 facilitated by grinding the meal exceedingly fine and using a high ratio of acid 
 to meal.

CEMENT FROM SEA SHELLS 

A plant designed specifically for the production of cement from coquina 
 (periwinkle) shells has been constructed at Flagler Beach, Florida, on a 
 10,000-acre site, to produce 10,000 to 15,000 barrels of cement per day from 
 3,000 tons of shell. Borings in the area indicate the presence of enough 
 accumulated shell to supply a plant of the size described for at least 100 
 years. ( Chemical and Sng ineering News , May 26, 1952)
