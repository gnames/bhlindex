TECHNICAL NOTE NO. 26- -GLAZING BRINE- FROZEN SALMON 

Frozen whole fish in cold storage are usually protected byan ice glaze. This 
 glaze, a thin shell of ice around the fish, is formed when frozen fish are given 
 a short dip in chilled water. The purpose of the glaze is to serve as a barrier 
 against the loss of moisture and to prevent air from coming into contact with the 
 fish. It thus protects the fish from dehydration and retards the rate of oxida- 
 tive deterioration, including the development of rancidity and rusting. 

There are several factors that can interfere with the formation of a good 
 glaze. Patches of oil may form on the surface of the fish and cause the dip wa- 
 ter to run off these areas before it can freeze and adhere. Similarly, slime and 
 blood may also contribute to a poor glaze. In brine-frozen fish the presence of 
 absorbed salt can make glazing difficult. The salt lowers the freezing point of 
 the water glaze, and a good glaze may not be possible in the range of about 0° F. 
 to 10° F., the storage temperatures commonly used commercially. 

Recently, inquiries have been received regarding the feasibility of glazing 
 brine-frozen fish. In order to observe the nature and extent of the problems in- 
 volved in glazing such fish, a brief experiment was conducted. Brine-frozen salm- 
 on were used as they were readily available from the increasingly large number 
 brought from Alaska to the Pacific Northwest for canning. 

Red salmon that were caught in Bristol Bay during the 1952 fishing season were, 
 obtained from one of the freezerships unloading at Seattle, Washington. These fish 
 had been frozen by immersion for about 12 hours in a saturated brine solution at 
 approximately 5° F. and then transferred to a dry hold for storage at 5° F. When 
 the fish were obtained from the vessel, they were slightlythawed at the outer sur- 
 face, but otherwise appeared to be in good condition. Ten of the fish were placed 
 in storage at 0° F. and ten at -20° F. 

The ten salmon that had been stored at 0° F. for several days were glazed by 
 immersing in water cooled to around 34° F. They were allowed to age for several 
 hours at 0° F., and then the glaze was examined and evaluated. The glaze taken by 
 the fish varied from good to poor in both quantity and quality. On some parts of 
 the fish the glaze was "soft" (not hard frozen) and rubbed off easily; this prob- 
 ably was due mainly to a high salt concentration in that particular area. In oth- 
 er small areas there was no glaze whatever because the water had run off before it 
 could freeze. Only 2 out of 10 fish took a complete glaze. All ten fish were then 
 sprayed with water and scrubbed with a brush to remove some of the salt, oil, blood, 
 and slime from the surface. This washing increased slightly the amount of glaze 
 that the fish would take; however, the glazing as a whole could not be considered 
 satisfactory. 

To determine whether these brine-frozen salmon would take a good glaze at a 
 lower temperature, ten other fish that had been stored at -20° F. were dipped in 
 cold water and then returned to the -20° F. room. All ten fish took a good glaze. 
 Later, three of these fish were transferred to the 0° F. room and were examined 
 the following day. Although the glaze was still intact, the ice had softened in 
 some parts, particularly on the head. On contact, this soft ice easily fell away 
 from the fish. In comparison, the .glaze on the fish left in the -20° F. room was 
 still hard. No tests were made at temperatures between 0° F. and -20° F. 

SUMMARY 

The salt absorbed by brine-frozen fish interferes with successful ice-glazing 
 of fish at storage temperatures commonly used commercially (0° F. to 10° F.). The
