May 1953 COMMERCIAL FISHERIES REVIEW 25 

glaze taken by brine-frozen Alaska red salmon at 0° F. was not considered satis- 
 factory; however the glaze taken at -20° F. was good. Since glazing of the brine- 
 frozen salmon does not appear feasible at the storage temperatures now used by the 
 freezerships (about 5° F.), these fish will be more susceptible to dehydration and 
 oxidative deterioration upon prolonged storage. It therefore is highly important 
 to process these fish as soon after freezing as possible in order to have a good 
 quality canned product.

HOME FREEZERS EXPAND FROZEN FOOD MARKET POTENTIAL 

Since the war, nearly 5 million home freezers have been sold with the 
 result that around 12 percent of the nation's 42 million electrically-wired 
 homes now have a freezer. According to a recent survey by Electrical Merchan- 
 dising , 1 , 140 , 000 home freezers were sold in 1952, a 9 percent gain over 1951, 
 when sales totaled 1,050,000 units. Also, the larger freezers are becoming 
 more popular. 

Several government and industry surveys have shown that a family with 
 a home freezer almost invariably uses more frozen foods. In towns under 
 5,000 population, which often have no other local frozen-food distributors, 
 many locker plants have gone "all out" to sell frozen food to home-freezer 
 owners. A large number of the nation's 11,000 locker-plant operators feel 
 that their business future lies in the success with which they can become 
 the "frozen food center" of their communities. 

The locker-plant associations and trade magazines have been doing a 
 great deal to help locker-plant operators become "frozen food centers." Many 
 operators have had difficulty in securing frozen foods at competitive prices, 
 so a national trade magazine has started a directory service listing free 
 of charge frozen-food packers interested in sales to locker plants. Eight 
 companies selling fishery products are now included in this directory. 

The U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service has been working with the locker 
 plants, their national association, and their trade magazines, to call at- 
 tention to the profit possibilities in the sale of frozen fishery products. 
 The Service has found that many operators already handle fish and shell- 
 fish. However, with greater knowledge of fishery products and their avail- 
 ability, plus some merchandising tools, e.g., signs and recipe booklets, 
 salss of fish by locker plants could be greatly increased.
