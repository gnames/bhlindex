The average price for all fur-seal skins sold at the April auction was $85.42 
 per skin, or $19.58 under the October average of $105.00. 

Black skins, of which there were 7,000 offered, averaged $100.52 per skin as 
 compared -with October's average of $122.04. A total of 14,900 dyed "Matara" (brown) 
 skins was offered and these skins sold for an average of $82.67, or $27.04 less than 
 in October. A total of 2,500 "Safari" brown (a lighter brown) skins was offered and 
 averaged $59.51 per skin, as compared with $69.14 in October.
