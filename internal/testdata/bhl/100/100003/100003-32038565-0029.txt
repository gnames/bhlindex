STATE TAGS TUNA : A total of 1,638 tuna— 1,139 yellowfin, 499 skipjack— were 
 tagged by the California Department of Fish and Game on a 3^-months', 20, 000-mile 
 cruise on the commercial vessel Intrepid . The cruise was completed at Los Angeles 
 on February 11. Three types of tags were used. Other major purposes for the cruise 
 were to test the feasibility of carrying out tagging operations on a commercial fish- 
 ing vessel; gain experience in commercial fishing methods; and collect post-larval 
 specimens of yellowfin and skipjack tuna under a night light to further delineate 
 the spawning range. 

Two of the tagged yellowfin tuna have already been recovered, reports the De- 
 partment of Fish and Game in aMarch 6 bulletin. One fish taken by a Peruvian purse 
 seiner on January 17, 1953, three miles west of Mancora, Peru, had moved 34 miles 
 south by west in 33 days from the spot tagged. The other fish, taken by the tuna 
 clipper Santa Helena on January 17, 1953, five miles west of Culpepper Island in 
 the Galapagas group had traveled 5 miles west in 49 days. Both fish were in good 
 condition and showed no significant increase in length. 

For all fish tagged, 96.7 percent of the yellowfin tuna were released in sat- 
 isfactory condition and 92.4 percent of the skipjack. The skipjack were the more 
 difficult of the two species to tag regardless of the type of tag used.

RESEARCH VESSEL " YELLOWFIN " FINDS ABALONE IN POOR CONDITION IN CHANNEL ISLAND 
 REGION: Abalone in the Channel Island region of Santa Cruz and San Clemente Islands 
 were found to be few in number, small in size, and poor in quality (most were in- 
 fested with round worms) . These were the findings of the research vessel Yellow - 
 fin of the California Department of Fish and Game. The vessel completed a two- 
 weeks' cruise at Los Angeles on February 26. Dives were made in the Santa Cruz 
 Island and San Clemente Island areas. Off San Clemente Island there was a greater 
 concentration of abalone than off Santa Cruz. Compared to a similar survey in 
 1952, fish life and abalone were observed to be considerably less abundant. 

One day of the cruise was spent in underwater photography off San Clemente 
 Island where conditions were judged favorable for this work. The results of these 
 films were encouraging and it is planned to return later in 1953 for additional 
 work, the California Department of Fish and Game announced recently. This was 
 Cruise 2 of the Yellowfin for 1953. 

This vessel's Cruise 1 (January 5-24, 1953) was a routine one for hydrograh- 
 ic research for the Cooperative Sardine Research Program. The purpose was to col- 
 lect data for determining the oceanographic factors responsible for the behavior, 
 spawning success, and survival of Pacific sardine. Operations were conducted in 
 the coastal and offshore area between Pt. Conception and Cape Colnett.

"YELLOWFIN " STUDIES SARDINE ABUNDANCE OFF LOWER CALIFORNIA : A total of 68 
 schools of fish were spotted by the California Department of Fish and Game research 
 vessel M/V Yellowfin on a 15-day 375-mile cruise completed at Los Angeles on March 
 20. The cruise was made to assess the abundance and distribution of spawning sar- 
 dines; to obtain sardine samples for age determinations; to test the feasibility 
 of using the Hardy Plankton Indicator in conjunction with the sardine surveys; and 
 to study the spawning population of sardines and their environment off lower Cali- 
 fornia. The area from Sebastian Vizcaino Bay to San Hipolito Bay, including the 
 area around Cedros and San Benitos Islands, was scouted, an April 21 report from 
 the California Department of Fish and Game states.
