Of the 68 schools spotted, it was estimated that 36 were of sardines, and 
 25 of mackerel. Two samples of sardines and one of Pacific mackerelwere obtained 

from the schools sampled. Thirty- 
 nine light stations were occupied 
 and yielded samples of sardines, 
 Pacific mackerel, jack mackerel, and 
 anchovies. Two samples of sardines 
 were obtained fromtuna clippers in 
 Turtle Bay. All the sardine samples 
 contained fish very near spawning. 

The Hardy Plankton Indicator 
 tested worked satisfactorily, but 
 more studies are needed to develop 
 a standard technique for interpre- 
 tation of the results of the tows. 
 In general, sardines in this area 
 were not as abundant inshore as they 
 have been during the fall months. 
 They were more abundant from San 
 Cristobal Bay northward to the area 
 around Cedros Island, and in the 
 southwest part of Sebastian Vizcaino 
 Bay. Heavyweather prevented a sur- 
 vey of the adjacent offshore area.

YELLOWTAIL TAGGED ; Rough weath- 
 er off Guadalupe Island, Mexico, lim- 
 ited the tagging of troll-caught yel- 
 lowtail by the California Department 
 of Fish and Game on a 5-day cruise 
 completed on April 14. The privately- 

owned yacht Goodwill , chartered forthis cruise, 
 was used for this tagging operation. 

Altogether five yellowtail ( Seriola dor- 
 salis ) were caught by trolling. Four were 
 tagged and one was retained for study. One 
 large yellowtail was double tagged, using a 

Petersen disk and a nylon capsule tag. The others were tagged only with Petersen 
 disks because of very rough waters, states the California Department of Fish and 
 Game in an April 22 report.
