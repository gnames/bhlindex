 Corps in March 1953 averaged 57.5 cents per pound as compared with 46.4 cents in 
 March 1952. The average price paid for the first three months of 1952 was 56.5

In addition to the purchases of fresh and frozen fishery products indicated aâ€” 
 bove, the Armed Forces generally make some local purchases which are not included 
 in the above figures. Therefore, actual purchases are somewhat higher than indi- 
 cated, but it is not possible to obtain data on the local purchases made by milita- 
 ry installations throughout the country.
