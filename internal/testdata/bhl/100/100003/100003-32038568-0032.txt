BAIT FISHING FOR TUNA TO BE TRIED BY " OREGON " ( CRUISE NO. 1£) : Live-bait fish- 
 ing for tuna and the capture and trial use of live bait taken off the United States 
 Gulf coast are the chief objectives of the Service's exploratory fishing vessel Or- 
 egon . The cruise commenced at Pascagoula, Mississippi, on April 9. Operations will 
 be centered in the ap- 
 proaches to the Gulf 
 of Mexico, the Straits 
 of Florida, the Yucatan 
 Channel, and the north- 
 eastern Caribbean Sea. 
 Emphasis will be plac- 
 ed on live-bait fish- 
 ing for blackfin and 
 yellowfin tuna and 
 white skipjack ( Kat- 
 suwonus ) „ 

The Oregon has 
 been readied to fish 
 for tuna with live bait 
 in the conventional 
 style used successfully 
 by the U.S. fishery 
 off the Pacific coast. 
 However, some addi- 
 tional kinds of equipment are being carried for trial use under conditions in the 
 Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean f>ea. The gear has been prepared so that changes 

in methods of bait fishing can be 
 made without returning to port. 

STERN VIEW OF THE OREGON SHOWS TUNA FISHING RACKS. 
 THE SPRAY SYSTEM IS BEING TESTED. 

NOTE THAT 

FITTED OUT FOR TUNA BAIT FISHING, THE SERVICE S EXPLOR- 
 ATORY FISHING VESSEL OREGON GETS READY TO SAIL. 

In addition, exploratory drags 
 with a 40-foot shrimp trawl will 
 be made in areas hitherto not cov- 
 ered by the Oregon. Red snapper 
 fishing with wire lines will be 
 undertaken in deep water if and 
 where indications of potential 
 snapper fishing are found. 

An "electronic fish finder," 
 the Fischlupe . has been installed 
 and will be tested during this 
 cruise. 

The Oregon is scheduled to 
 return to Pascagoula on June 25.
