Metal Cans--Shipments for Fishery Products, February 1953 

Total shipments of metal cans for fish and sea food in Jan- 
 uary-February 1953 amounted to 7,910 short tons of steel — 9 per- 
 cent less than the 8,675 short tons shipped in the first two months 
 of 1952. This is based on an April 23 report issued by the Bureau 

of the Census. 

NOTE: statistics cover all commercial and captive plants known to be pro- 
 ducing METAL CANS. REPORTED IN BASE BOXES OF STEEL CONSUMED IN THE MANU- 
 FACTURE OF CANS, THE DATA FOR FISHERY PRODUCTS ARE CONVERTED TO TONS OF STEEL BY USING THE 
 FACTOR: 23.0 BASE BOXES OF STEEL EQUAL ONE SHORT TON OF STEEL.

" ALBATROSS III " FISHES FOR YOUNG OCEAN PERCH ( Cruise No. IgB) : Bad weather 
 hampered operations and cut short the cruise of the Branch of Fishery Biology's re- 
 search vessel Albatross III to the northeast peak of Georges Bank and the area south 
 of Jeffrey's Ledge. The six-day cruise was completed at Woods Hole, Mass., on April 
 21. The objectives of the cruise were to determine the characteristics of a fish 
 school, to obtain a sample of young ocean perch, and to obtain live haddock for ex- 
 periments at station. 

Fourteen tows were made on the Northeast Peak of Georges Bank; no concentra- 
 tion of haddock suitable for more detailed operations was discovered. The haddock 
 were very uniformly distributed along the entire section covered by these tews. 
 Northwesterly winds and heavy seas on the evening of April 17 made it necessary to 
 cease fishing operations. Because of unfavorable weather reports for April 18, the 
 vessel proceeded to the ocean perch area. 

Eleven tows were made in the area south of Jeffrey's Ledge and a total of 200 
 young ocean perch were caught. Operations then ceased because of bad weather. 

Bottom photographs were obtained by Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution person- 
 nel with the stereocamera in the Northeast Peak area and during the fishing opera- 
 tions for young ocean perch. A series of night photographs of the bottom were ob- 
 tained in the area south of Jeffrey's Ledge. The number of bottom samples obtained 
 was limited both because of failure of the equipment to operate satisfactorily and 
 because of the type of bottom encountered.

" JOHN N. COBB " FAKES GOOD SHRIMP CATCHES IN ALASKAN WATERS ( Cruise No. 1£) : 
 Good shrimp catches were made in southeastern Alaska waters by the Service's Explor- 
 atory fishing vessel John N. Cobb on a 7-week cruise completed at Seattle, Washing- 
 ton, on April 17. This trip was the fifth in a series of explorations to locate com- 
 mercial concentrations of shrimp and other shellfish in southeastern Alaskan waters. 

Fishing operations were carried out in Yakutat Bay and the adjacent ocean waters 
 near the Cape Phipps Peninsula. A total of 79 drags were made — the majority with a 
 20-foot beam trawl, although a small West Coast box-type otter trawl and a New Bed- 
 ford-type scallop dredge were used in some instances. Shrimp traps were also fished.
