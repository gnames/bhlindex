Good catches of pink shrimp were made with the beam trawl from off Blizhni 
 Point to off Kame Stream. Nine drags in this area averaged 242 pounds of pink 
 shrimp per 30- minute drag, with the best drag yielding 510 pounds of 80-count (80 
 whole shrimp per pound) pink shrimp. Six 30-minute drags northwest of Knight Is- 
 land produced from 102 to 145 pounds of mixed pink and side-stripe shrimp per drag. 
 Drags off Krutoi Island yielded up to 300 pounds of 67-count pink shrimp per 30- 
 minute drag. 

Shrimp traps set from the vicinity of Gregson Island to north of Knight Island 
 were generally productive. One set of 38 traps was set for 47 hours off the north 
 tip of Knight Island to the vicinity of Eleanor Cove. The set averaged slightly 
 under lg pounds of 13-count spot shrimp and l£ pounds of 41-count coon-stripe shrimp. 

Otter-trawl tows off the Cape Phipps Peninsula resulted in negligible catches 
 of shrimp and fish. Drags with the scallop dredge in Yakutat Bay caught only a few 
 scallops. 

Norwegian Sardines Promoted in Major U. S. Markets 

The second phase of an intensive three-year advertising and promotion campaign 
 for Norwegian canned sardines has been launched in the United States by the Norwe- 
 gian Canners Association,, This association, with headquarters in Stavanger, repre- 
 sents 106 Norwegian canning companies , an April 9 news release from the Norwegian 
 Information Service points out. 

Using newspapers, radio, and television, as well as point-of-sales promotion, 
 the Association is vigorously publicizing Norwegian sardines in six major United 
 States markets — Boston, New York-Newark, Chicago, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Los Angeles- 
 Long Beach, and San Francisco-Oakland. A total of 53 daily and weekly newspapers 
 in these market areas are running weekly advertisements. 

During Lent the Association backed up its newspaper ads with either radio or 
 television spot announcements. Scheduled to be used in the summer months, these 
 announcements will stress sardines as easy-tc— prepare, heat-beating snacks. More- 
 over, sardines from Norway are being publicized on radio and television cooking 
 shows, as well in grocery, restaurant, and hotel trade publications. Special fea- 
 tures of the public relations program are Norwegian sardine recipes and pictures 
 for editorial use, and the color film "Silver Harvest." This film on the Norwegian 
 sardine industry is available free of charge to television stations, clubs, and as- 
 sociations. 

As part of the current drive, tie-ins between Norwegian sardines and four lead- 
 ing cracker companies have been arranged in the New York, Chicago, Boston, and Los 
 Angeles areas. Scheduled to continue through April, the tie-ins include mutual co- 
 operation in newspaper advertising and sales promotion, and in arranging point-of- 
 sales displays. Further tie-ins are being planned for the late spring and summer 
 months . 

To stimulate interest in Norwegian sardines among food brokers and store oper- 
 ators, the Association is distributing a 14-page sales portfolio, pointing out that 
 one out of every four families in the U. S. buys Norwegian sardines. The portfolio 
 also tells in pictures and words about the canning process and the standards set by 
 the Association's Quality Control Institute. Other promotional material made avail- 
 able to grocers includes point-of-sales aids, such as shelf-talkers and dump display 
 cards .
