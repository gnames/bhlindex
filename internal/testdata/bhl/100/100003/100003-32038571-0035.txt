May 1953 COMMERCIAL FISHERIES REVIEW 33 

In the past 50 years the Norwegian food-canning industry has made tremendous 
 progress . There are at present about 300 canneries scattered along the Norwegian 
 coast, the point of greatest concentration being in the Stavanger district. Since 
 World War II, Norway has exported an annual average of 3,000 to 3,500 metric tons 
 of canned sardines, as well as kippers, crab meat, and shrimp.

Pacific Oceanic Fishery Investigations 

" HUGH M. SMITH " STUDIES OCEANOGRAPHY AS REIATSD TO SKIPJACK TUNA IN HAWAIIAN 
 WATERS ( Cruise No . 20J1 Detailed data on ocean currents and abundance of nutrient 
 chemicals and marine life were collected by the Service'3 Pacific Oceanic Fishery 
 Investigations research vessel Hugh M. Smith on a cruise completed at Honolulu on 
 April 4. The cruise, which began February 25, completed the first part of a pro- 
 gram of intensive oceanographic studies in Hawaiian waters. 

Hydrographic and biological data were obtained at 56 stations around the Ha- 
 waiian Islands. Two exploratory sections to 29 N. along the 155° and 158° W. me- 
 ridians did not reveal any concentrations of marine life. Several oceanic "fronts" 
 were encountered near the northern ends of the lines . The studies were planned to 
 coincide with the season of scarcity of the skipjack tuna or "aku," the most impor- 
 tant species in the Hawaiian tuna fishery. A similar investigation will be carried 
 out during the peak of the skipjack season this coming summer; it is hoped that a 
 comparison of the data from these two cruises may shed light on the environmental 
 factors which regulate the seasonal movements of these schools in and out of Hawai- 
 ian waters. This could result in an increase in the skipjack catch through the ex- 
 tension of fishing operations into new areas during the local offseason. 

In the interim between these two major cruises, a close check will be kept on 
 local hydrographic conditions and on the abundance and whereabouts of the skipjack 
 schools. This work will be accomplished by frequent, short cruises of the smaller 
 research vessel, Charles H. Gilbert, supplemented by aerial scouting in cooperation 
 with the U. S. Navy. 

Service Completes Study of Domestic Tuna Industry 

A comprehensive study of the domestic tuna industry and its current production 
 and marketing problems has been completed by the Fish and Wildlife Service, the Sec- 
 retary of the Interior announced in May. 

This study was launched in October 1952 in response to a petition to the Secre- 
 tary of the Interior by six senators from the tuna-producing states of California, 
 Washington, and Oregon. The senators had expressed concern over increased foreign 
 competition and the industry's general economic health. 

The results of the study just completed by specialists in the Fish and Wildlife 
 Service's Branch of Commercial Fisheries have been compiled in a report of more than 
 400 pages. Copies have been submitted to the legislators who sought the investiga- 
 tion. Subjects covered include: history of the industry; consumption; world produc- 
 tion; domestic production; processing; relationship of the industry to the national 
 interest; distribution; government assistance in the United States and competing 
 countries; and recommendations for action by both the tuna industry and the Federal 
 Government .
