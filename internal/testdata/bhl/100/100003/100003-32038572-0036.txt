The report notes that the outlook for consumption of products of the tuna in- 
 dustry is bright. On the other hand, the prospects of major relative cost reduc- 
 tions in fishing and processing are rather bleak. Distribution, which is respon- 
 sible for only a small part of the 
 ultimate cost of canned tuna, does 
 not offer any great prospect of cost 
 savings as an aid in improving the 
 position of the industry. In the 
 light of these and associated deter- 
 minations, the report contains sug- 
 gestions as to what may be done by 
 the domestic tuna industry — the fish- 
 ermen, processors, distributors, and 
 importers — and the Federal Govern- 
 ment, to promote necessary adjust- 
 ments so that the industry may a- 
 chieve and maintain a sound position 
 in the domestic economy. 

A crisis in the domestic t.una 
 industry arose in 1951 when duty- 
 free imports of frozen tuna from Ja- 
 pan and Latin America, together with 
 increased imports of brine-packed 
 canned tuna from Japan, reached un- 
 precedented proportions. United 
 States tuna fishermen and cannery 
 operators, particularly on the West 
 Coast, found domestic markets over- 
 supplied with tuna and were forced 
 to tie up their vessels and close 
 processing plants. 

SURVEY OF THE 
 DOMESTIC TUNA 
 INDUSTRY 

WASHINGTON, D. C. 
 MAY, 1953 

As the crisis developed, a bill calling for a 3-cent-per-pound duty on fresh 
 or frozen tuna imports was considered by the Congress. This bill, which also di- 
 rected the Tariff Commission and the Fish and Wildlife Service to initiate inves- 
 tigations of the tuna fishing industry, passed the House but failed of passage in 
 the Senate. 

Subsequently, the Senate Finance Committee directed the Tariff Commission to 
 investigate the tuna situation, particularly from the standpoint of foreign compe- 
 tition in order to assist Congress in any future legislation concerning tuna. The 
 Fish and Wildlife Service report supplements, but does not duplicate, the Tariff Com- 
 mission investigation report published in March. 

U. S. Production of Packaged Fish, 1952 

The production of fresh and frozen packaged fish (fillets, steaks, and split 
 "butterfly") in the United States during 1952 totaled 190,374,040 pounds, valued 
 at $54,912,172 to the processors. This is a decrease of 7 percent in quantity and 
 8 percent in value as compared with the 1951 production. 

In 1952 ocean perch fillets (58,660,499 pounds) was once again the largest 
 single item of fresh and frozen packaged fish produced. Haddock fillets (52,064,681
