The merchandising of frozen fishery products in consumer-size packages (2 
 pounds or less per pkg. ) has made rapid strides in the United States since 1950. 

The production of a select- 
 ed number of items in con- 
 sumer-size fixed-weight pack- 
 ages in 1952 totaled over 
 77 million pounds â€” 25 per- 
 cent over the 1951 pack and 
 82 percent more than in 1950. 
 Fillets and shrimp are the 
 principal products put up in 
 the consumer-size packages. 
 Included are frozen breaded 
 and cooked products.
