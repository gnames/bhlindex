The 1952 pack was 23 percent less in quantity and 25 percent lower in value as com- 
 pared with 1951 (table 2). This was due to 1952 being an off-year for the pink salm- 
 on run. All other species of salmon, except chinook or king, increased substantial- 
 ly; the largest increase (72 percent) was for silver or coho.
