The average price of all salmon packed in the Pacific Coast States in 1952 was 
 $24.61 per standard case to the canners as compared with $25.31 in 1951. Columbia 
 River canned salmon had the highest average price — $33.55 per standard case — due to 
 the large percentage of chinook salmon. The 1951 average on the Columbia Riverwas 
 $35.41 per case. Salmon canned in the Puget Sound area averaged $22.68 per stand- 
 ard case to the canner in 1952 and coastal salmon averaged $18.46, compared with 
 $23.24 and $20.90, respectively, in 1951.
