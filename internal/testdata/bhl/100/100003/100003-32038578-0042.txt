PRODUCTION IN 1944, 1945, AND 1946 BECAUSE CANS WERE NOT ALLOCATED FOR THIS PRODUCT 

The canning of animal food from fishery products has increased sharply since 
 the end of World War II (table 3) • More packers have become aware of the value of 
 animal food produced from fishery products , and the expanding market for this pro- 
 duct. During World War II no cans were allocated by the Government for the canning 
 of animal food, which accounts for the fact that none was produced during that pe- 
 riod. 

U. S. Production of Selected Byproducts 

OYSTER AND MARINE-CLAM SHELL PRODUCTS : The production of grit and agricultur- 
 al lime from oyster-shell products in 1952 totaled 429,348 tons, valued at $3,359,024 
 to the manufacturers (table 1). This was a decrease of 5 percent in quantity and 1 
 percent in value as compared with 1951. No clam shel]s were used in 1952.
