U. S. Shrimp Imports, 1952 

United States shrimp (fresh, frozen, canned, and dried) imports from all 
 countries in 1952 totaled 38,470,510 pounds, a decrease of 8 percent from 1951 

and 4 percent less than in 1950 (table l) . This decline was duemainly 
 to poor fishing on the Mexican west coast. Mexico as usual was still 
 the largest foreign shipper of fresh and frozen shrimp to the United 
 States. Almost its entire production is exported to the UnitedStates. 

In 1952 Mexican shipments comprised 88 percent of the total shrimp imports 
 into the United States, compared with 94 percent in 1951, and 99 percent in 1950.
