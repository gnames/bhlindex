In spite of lighter-than-average landings, large drawn offshore haddock at Boston 
 dropped 35.8 percent. Whitefish at New York and Chicago dropped considerably from 
 a month earlier — 43.8 percent at New York and 34.1 percent at Chicago. All other 
 items were priced higher than in February. Compared with March 1952, all items 

in this subgroup sold at considerably 
 lower prices this March. 

Fresh processed fish and shellfish 
 prices rose 1.8 percent above February 
 and 9.5 percent over March 1952 due en- 
 tirely to higher shrimp prices. Shrimp 
 landings continued light and the market 
 was strong. Fresh haddock fillet prices 
 at Boston declined while shucked oysters 
 at Norfolk remained unchanged. Compared 
 with March 1952, fresh shrimp and oyster 
 prices were up and haddock prices were 
 down. 

From February to March frozen fish 
 and shellfish prices continued to de- 
 cline, but inventories were being reduced. 
 This decline was more than offset by a 
 further increase in frozen shrimp prices. Frozen fillets of haddock and ocean 
 perch were priced the same as in February, but flounder fillets dropped 11.8 per- 
 cent. Compared with a year earlier, the processed frozen fish and shellfish sub- 
 group index was 2 8 8 percent higher — shrimp was up 32.1 percent, but haddock fillets 
 and flounder fillets were down 32.2 and 15.4 percent respectively. 

Canned fishery products prices in March were 0.4 percent higher than in Feb- 
 ruary, but 3.6 percent lower than March 1952. The only change from February was 
 a 1.0-percent increase in canned tuna prices. Inventories of canned tuna were 
 lower and the market stronger. Also, canned tuna was the only canned fish item 
 priced higher than in March 1952 — all other canned fish were priced lower.
