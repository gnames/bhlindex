FISH ^LOUR AS MILK SUBSTITUTE ; A quart bottle of fish flour— suggested as a 
 possible substitute for a quart of milk in countries where cows are scarce — was 
 exhibited in New York to the 26-nation Executive Board of the United Nations In- 
 ternational Children's Emergency Fund on March 20. The sample was called, by rep- 
 resentatives of UNICEF and the Food and Agriculture Organization, a deodorized, 
 tasteless product rich in calcium, containing twice as much protein as skim milk, 
 and costing about the same as milk. 

To test the public response to fish flour, FAO hopes to conduct tests inChile 
 later this year, the Board was informed. As a country with a steady supplyof fish, 
 Chile would be especially suitable for trials, FAO believes. 

The discussion of milk substitutes arose when a report on "Improvement of 
 Child Nutrition" (Doc. E/lCEF/217), drawn up by a Technical Working Group on Long- 
 Range Activities for Children, was introduced by a member of the UNICEF staff. 
 The Working Group, he said, had decided at a recent meeting in Rome that soybean 
 milk and fish flour were the most promising possibilities for milk substitutes. 
 He then described the nutritional value of the products and mentioned the interest 
 expressed by Indonesia, Guatemala, and Chile. 

An FAO representative displayed the bottle of fish flour and said the product 
 could be used in biscuits, soups, or mixed with corn meal. One important advan- 
 tage, she said, was that fish flour contains vitamin B-12, essential for growth, 
 which does not appear in the vegetable diets common in some countries. FAO, she 
 said, was gathering samples of various types of fish flour and would select the 
 most suitable for acceptability tests in Chile.

WHALING SEASON SUCCESSFUL IN 1952 ; The Australian 1952 whaling season was the 
 most successful on record, according to the January 1953 Fisheries Newsletter pub- 
 lished by the Commonwealth Director of Fisheries. 

Unfortunately, the substantial drop in whale oil prices has had a marked ef- 
 fect on the total value of the production. This has been offset to some extent by 
 improved efficiency in operations with a corresponding increased yield. 

During the 1952 season four stations operated at Point Cloates, Carnarvon, and 
 Albany on the west coast, and Moreton Island on the east coast. They processed 
 1,787 humpback whales for an oil production of 91,360 barrels, equal to 51.1barrels 
 per whale (see table). Female whales comprised 37.2 percent of the total and their 
 average length was 2+0 .,5 feet, the same as in 1951. The average length of males was
