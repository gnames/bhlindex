The increase in oil yield per whale from 1949 to 1952 clearly indicates the 
 improvements being made in processing the whales. 

It will be noted that in 1952 there was a considerable increase in the per- 
 centage of female whales as compared with 1951. However, the percentage is less 
 than in 1950, and the percentage of females carrying a foetus is also less than in 
 1950, but higher than 1951. 

No exceptionally large whales were taken and no whale markets were found. 
 There was a large number of sharks present off Point Cloates. The sharks were so

bad that it was not possible to flag a whale outside the reefâ€ž Attempts to do so 
 resulted in more than half the whale being eaten with a corresponding loss in oil 
 production. A total of 80 sharks were shot while attacking a singlewhale alongside 
 a catcher.
