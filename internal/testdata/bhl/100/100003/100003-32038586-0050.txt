UNITED KINGDOM TO BUY BRITISH COLUMBIA CANNED SALMON : Great Britain has 
 agreed to purchase 014,250, 000 worth of British Columbia canned salmon, the Cana- 
 dian Minister of Fisheries announced the Latter part of March. Reports indicate 
 the purchase will consist of about 200,000 cases of salmon. 

Failure of Great Britain to purchase usual quantities of Canadian canned 
 salmon in 1952 was mainly responsible for a large carry-over of 500,000 cases from 
 the 1952 pack, reports a March 25 U=. S. Embassy dispatch from Ottawa. 

While it is reported that no conditions were attached to this purchase, it is 
 hoped that the Canadian salmon industry would be able to increase its purchases of 
 tin plate and fish nets from the United Kingdom,, Particularly as tin plate is no 
 longer in such short supply. The Canadian Minister of Fisheries endorsed this 
 recommendation with the remark "that it was only by expanding her trade with this 
 country that Britain could increase her purchases here," reports a March 30 U. S. 
 Embassy dispatch from London. 

SEAL HUNTING PLANS FOR 1953 : The Canadian Department of Fisheries states 
 that about 18 vessels, Canadian and foreign, will go out after seals this spring, 
 reports a February 27 dispatch from the U. S. consulate at St. John's, Newfound- 
 land. This is a larger number than anticipated. Of these vessels, nine will oper- 
 ate on the "Front" and the 
 remainder in the Gulf of 
 St. Lawrence. Only five 
 Newfoundland vessels will 
 hunt for seals this year 
 as compared to nine in 1952. 

It is reported that 
 of the six sealers from 
 Norway, four would work in 
 the Gulf and the remainder 
 on the "Front." Five or 
 six other vessels from 
 Halifax would work in the 
 Gulf. Newfoundland ships 
 clearing this year were ex- 
 pected to leave St. John's 
 between March 5 and 10. 
 The killing date for the 
 Gulf area has been set as 
 March 5, and March 10 for 
 the "Front." Itis reported 
 that Gulf seals give birth to young one week earlier than the "Front" seals. 

Vessels planning to work the Gulf region estimate that about 115,000 animals 
 will have to be taken in order to rate the catch as "good." It is estimated that 
 a herd of about 200,000 seals moves annually in this area where few bedlamers and 
 old seals are to be found. Newly-born seals constitute the main objective. Seal- 
 spotting planes will again be used this year in both waters. The Newfoundland press 
 states that up to the end of February there have been no reports of ice in the Gulf , 
 causing some concern to sealers planning to operate there.
