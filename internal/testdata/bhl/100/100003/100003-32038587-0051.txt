May 1953 COMMERCIAL FISHERIES REVIEW 49 

Due to adverse weather conditions in 1952 and the uncertainty of market prices, 
 it was not believed that much effort would be made to hunt seals this spring. 
 However, as all 1952 oil and skins were eventually disposed of, sealers have be- 
 come more optimistic as it appears a ready market will be available for the 1953 
 skins. Seal oil is generally the primary reason for a seal hunt and unfortunately 
 market quotations for oil this spring are 25 percent below those of 1952.

FISHERMEN'S COOPERATIVES PLANNED : Fishermen's cooperatives in Egypt are being 
 planned by the Department of Coastguards arid Fisheries, a March 23 U. S. Embassy 
 dispatch from Cairo states. Present plans call for cooperatives at Lake Manzala 
 and Mariut, but the system could be extended to cover all lakes and sea fisheries. 
 An appropriation of feE40,000 (US$114>800) to finance the plan has been requested 
 from the Egyptian Government. Of this total, one-half would be used as a loan 
 fund to finance cooperative associations for the fishing industry, and one-half 
 as a gift from the Government for building construction and purchase of refriger- 
 ated trucks. 

The importance of the plan to the national economy was outlined by officials 
 of the Department. It was explained that the cooperatives would be private. The 
 Government would assist in formulation not only because of the benefit to the na- 
 tional economy, but to improve the social welfare of Egypt's fishermen. The fish- 
 ermen now live under worse conditions than other groups. Plans* include building 
 model communities for the fisherman, with improvements in health, education, and 
 social conditions. Officials believe that the betterment of fishermen's living 
 conditions will result in increased production to help meet Egypt's ever-growing 
 food demands.
