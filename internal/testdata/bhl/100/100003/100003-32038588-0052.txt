MOTOR BOAT CURRENCY RETENTION SCHEME EXTENDED : The Icelandic Currency Reten- 
 tion Scheme, commonly known as the "Motor Boat Currency," a form of indirect sub- 
 sidy to the Icelandic motor boat fishing fleet, was extended for one year, effec- 
 tive February 5, 1953. The terms are unchanged, reports a February 16 U. S. con- 
 sular dispatch from Reykjavik. The winter fishery began in January, before agree- 
 ment had been reached on this extension, as the Icelandic Government had urged the 
 industry to operate every day possibles 

During the discussions of the scheme, the boat operators had made the colla- 
 teral demand that the interest rate on operational loans to the industry by the Na- 
 tional Bank and Fisheries Bank be again reduced to 5 percent. This rate was raised
