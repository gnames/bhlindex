 the rate should be 5 percent for the first 6 months and 5^ percent for the second

Following the agreement with the Government, the boat operators announced the

I/no prices established in 1952. 



basic price is for cod, gutted with head on, and was set at I.kr. 1.05 per kilogram 
 (US$2. 92 per cwt.), the same price as was paid last year. The prices to be paid 
 in 1953 to boat operators by the buyers and processors were also announced. The 
 buyers and processors basic price is I.kr. 1.00 per kilogram (US$2. 79 per cwt.) of 
 gutted cod with head on. 

A new classification — "net fish" — was added to the price schedules this year. 
 This refers to cod which lie in the net for a period of from 1 to 3 nights, and 
 prices the fish according to freshness. This reflects the fact that many boats 
 are unable to take up all their nets when returning to port, but must return to 
 the grounds the following day or later to collect them, and is an attempt to im- 
 prove uniformity and quality at the processing plants. 

Both price schedules show increases only for haddock, wolf fish (catfish), and 
 roe. Haddock and wolf fish arethe mostdesired Icelandic species on the U. S. market, 
 but represent only a small proportion of the total catch in Icelandic waters. 

Since the operators have agreed to pay the fishermen I.kr. 1.05 per kilo 
 (US$2.92 per cwt.) for cod and will receive only I.kr. 1.00 (US$2. 79 per cwt.) from 
 the processing plants, it is obvious that they are depending upon the indirect sub- 
 sidy of the motor-boat currency scheme to break even or show a profit. Since the 
 fishermen won a substantial increase in their wage guarantee in the agreement which
