 more than ever upon the catch this year. They are placing great hopes that the

FISH PRODUCTION AND UTILIZATION , 1952 ; Production of fishery products in 
 Iceland during 1952 totaled 336,760 metric tons, 9 percent less than in 1951 and 
 4 percent greater than in 1950 (see table), reports the February Statistical Bul- 
 letin of the National Bank of Iceland. Production of fish used for food increased 
 over 1951 — 102 percent more fish was utilized for salting and 34 percent more fish 
 was filleted. There was a big drop in the amount of fish used for fish meal and 
 oil in 1952 — the herring catch was 87 percent less than in 1951, while the utili- 
 zation of other fish for reduction purposes was 90 percent less.

POLICY ON TUNA EXPORTS IN 1953 : Japanese Government officials and members of 
 the tuna industry are holding discussions to formulate the policy on exports of 
 tuna for the new Japanese fiscal year, April 1, 1953, to March 31, 1954. No offi- 
 cial Government announcement has been issued as yet, but is expected shortly, re- 
 ports a March 17 U. S. Embassy dispatch from Tokyo. 

Reports indicate the Government favors continuing the policy of a quota and 
 check prices on exports to the United States as was in effect during the past fis- 
 cal year. The last fiscal year's quota on frozen tuna was 21,000 short tons, but 
 was originally established at 12,000 tons; canned tuna quota is 1,150,000 cases, 
 originally fixed at 1,000,000 cases. 

A discussion by producers and exporters indicates a strong desire for an in- 
 itial quota of 30,000 tons for 1953. The canners have declared a production goal 
 of 1,500,000 cases of tuna, but are withholding comment on the quota desired by 
 them for export pending further study.
