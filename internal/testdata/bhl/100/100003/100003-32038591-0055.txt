May 1953 COMMERCIAL FISHERIES REVIEW 53 

The Chairman of the Council on Tuna Exports (including producers of frozen 
 tuna andcanners) has proposed a meeting between tuna representatives of the United 
 States and Japan to discuss the problem of exports before deciding on the Japanese 
 policy for 1953. No agreement has been reached on this suggestion by members of 
 the Council. Some elements in the Japanese tuna industry are optimistic that no 
 definite action will be taken to apply a tariff on imports of frozen tuna into the 
 United States. This feeling is influenced by (a) the defeat in the U. S. Senate 
 (June 1952) of the bill to place a temporary tariff of 3 cents per pound on im- 
 ports of fresh and frozen tuna; (b) a recent report that a bill had been defeated 
 in the California State Assembly to levy a state tax equivalent to 3 cents per 
 pound on frozen tuna imported from Japan ( Mainichi , March 10); and (c) expectation 
 of continued and added support from some United States canners opposing a tariff 
 on imports of frozen tuna because they need Japanese tuna to meet their full pro- 
 duction requirements.

PROPOSAL TO REMOVE FUR-SEALING BAN : The recently organized League for the 
 Promotion of Japanese Fur Sealing has proposed that the Japanese Government's ban 
 on pelagic fur sealing be removed to permit operations in the coastal waters of 
 Japan. According to a recent press item ( Nippon Kaizai, March 10), the League 
 gave the following reasons for its proposals: 

1. Results of the joint investigation of fur seals in coastal waters of Japan 
 in 1952 by Canada, United States, and Japan have revealed that the continued re- 
 striction on fur-seal hunting would not substantially increase the supply of fur 
 seals in Japanese waters. 

2. The fur seals which migrate to Japanese waters feed on fish, hence are 
 harmful to the Japanese fishing industry. 

3. Approximately US$2,800,000 per year could be realized from the sale of 
 50,000 pelts exported at an estimated value of US$56 per pelt. 

The League further proposed that, if operations are resumed, (a) the season 
 should be from April through August, (b) hunting should be principally off Hokkaido 
 and the eastern (Pacific) coast of Honshu, (c) the Government should license ap- 
 proximately 60 catcher boats averaging 20 to 30 gross tons each, and (d) the Gov- 
 ernment should limit the catch to less than 50,000 seals a year "to conserve the 
 resource." It is also suggested that an association be formed to handle the sale 
 of exports of the pelts. The Japanese Government has made no announcement on this 
 proposal, reports a March 13 American Embassy dispatch from Tokyo. 

This effort to remove the restrictions on Japanese fur sealing reflects a 
 part of the policy and charges of the prewar period which led to the abrogation by 
 Japan of the Fur Seal Convention in October 1941. One of the principal reasons 
 given by the Japanese for that action was the charge that the fur seals were ad- 
 versely affecting the fisheries by consuming large quantities of commercially val- 
 uable fish. Insufficient knowledge of fur-seal biology existed at that time to 
 answer satisfactorily the criticism by the Japanese fishermen and other interests. 
 Occupation authorities in October 1945 advised the Japanese Government that pelagic 
 sealing would not be countenanced, in recognition of the provisions of the Fur Seal 
 Convention of 1911. Evidence indicates that some illicit pelagic sealing was con- 
 ducted despite this order. 

By a cooperative arrangement of the Japanese Government and the Occupation 
 Government, pelagic fur-seal investigations in the coastal waters of Japan were
