begun in 1949 and continued in 1950. In 1952, the joint investigation was con- 
 ducted on an intensive scale from February through June. Preliminary analysis of 
 the 1952 data reveals that approximately 69 percent of the stomach contents of 
 the seals examined (2,312) had no commercial value. The most important item in 
 the fur seal's diet is lantern fishes. Answers to other questions on the source 
 and maintenance of the fur seal resource in Japanese coastal waters are expected 
 to be provided with the completion of the analysis of the 1952 data.

PEARL-SHELL FISHING IN ARAFURA SEA POSTPONED ; The sailing date of the pearl- 
 shell fishing expedition to the Arafura Sea (north of Australia) has been postponed 
 by the Japanese Government. The Australian Government requested that the expedi- 
 tion's departure date be postponed until a Japan-Australia Fisheries Agreement has 
 been reached. The Japanese Government has already accepted the proposal from the 
 Australian Government to open negotiations for such an agreement at Canberra on 
 April 13, 1953* In case an agreement is not reached within one month after the 
 commencement of negotiations, the sailing of the pearl-shell fishing expedition 
 will be subject to further consideration by the two governments.

EXPERIMENTS WITH RING-NET FISHING GEAR : Experiments being conducted in the 
 use of the ring-net type of fishing gear have shown very encouraging results, ac- 
 cording to a recent report of the Federation of Malaya's Fisheries Department. 
 Since December 1952, the Trustful IV , a fishing smack purchased in Scotland and 
 manned by a Scotch crew, has been used in experimental ring-net fishing operations 
 off the coast of Perak. At first, the mesh (designed for herring) proved to be 
 too large for use in Malayan waters. However, after switching to a net of smaller 
 mesh, results improved at once, reports a March 18 U. S. consular dispatch from 
 Kaula Lumpur. 

The Scotch crew is now training Malays in the use of a ring-net designed for 
 use in Malayan seas. It combines the features of Malayan and European nets. The 
 Department of Fisheries says that the fishing operation is almost completely mech- 
 anized, from shooting out the net to hauling in the fish. The experimental fish- 
 ing unit, which has been operating with one large boat and one smaller boat, has 
 been catching as much fish as the most modern local craft, the Fisheries Department 
 claimed. Moreover, the Trustful IV is manned by only 8 fishermen (4 Scotch and 4 
 Malays) as compared to 24 men who operate one of the modern local fishing boats. 
 The fishermen on the Trustful IV were especially proud when on a recent expedition 
 they brought in a ton of fish, whereas the local craft operating in the same area 
 caught no fish at all. Machinery is also used for unloading the fish. 

The Fisheries Department plans to have the fishing unit operated entirely by 
 Malays by the end of August 1953. The Trustful IV, already commanded by a Malay, 
 will then be used for demonstration and training of additional fishing crews in 
 the Federation. A spokesman of the Fisheries Department said that local fishermen 
 will also be taught how to use the ring-net gear to increase their catch of ikan 
 kembong , a low-priced fish much in demand by the Malayan workers and farmers.
