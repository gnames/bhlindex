REVIEW OF THE FISHERIES , 1940 -49: The Mexican catch of fishery products in 
 1949 totaled 71,866 metric tons, valued at 103.8 million pesos (US$12 million). 
 There has been a steady increase in the Mexican fish catch each year since 1940 
 (table l) ; the increase has averaged about 13 percent each year. However, it is

not likely to increase at this pace in the future because of reduced supplies of 
 the main export species and the slow expansion of the domestic market. This is 
 based on the "Fisheries" section of The Economic Development of Mexico , a recent 
 report issued in Mexico. The report is a study made by the Combined Mexican Work- 
 ing Party of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the 
 Mexican Government (Nacional Financiera) . 

The most important development in the Mexican fisheries since 1940 has been 
 the great increase in the shrimp and sardine catches, which now account for more 
 than half the total catch. The shrimp catch, most of which is exported, rose from 
 5,100 metric tons in 1940 to 18,500 metric tons in 1949. The sardine catch, con- 
 sumed almost entirely within the country, increased from 2,700 to 18,700 tons in 
 the same period. The catch of other species, sold mainly in the domestic market 
 without processing, more than doubled between 1940 and 1945, but decreased some- 
 what since then because of the concentration on shrimp and sardine fishing in the 
 Gulf of California and Lower California. 

The catch increase was made possible by the expansion of the Mexican fishing 
 fleet— from 7,900 tons in 1941 to 23,500 tons in 1949 (table 2)— and by the estab- 
 lishment of a fish canning and freezing industry. In 1950 this industry included 
 68 plants, mainly for processing shrimp and sardine. These are located mostly on 
 the Gulf of California and in Lower California. 

Fish exports, principally shrimp and small amounts of abalone and lobster, 
 have increased from 8,200 metric tons, valued at 7 million pesos (US$1. 4 million) 
 in 1940 to 22,900 tons and 163 million pesos (US$18. 8 million) in 1949 (table 3). 
 In each year, exports were equivalent to about one-third of the total production. 

Although the United States market could absorb more Mexican shrimp and abalone 
 at remunerative prices, there is no outlook for a substantial expansion of these 
 exports because of the scarcity of these species. The shrimp catch in the Gulf of 
 California, the main producing center, has been declining sharply in the 1950/51 
 and 1951/52 seasons. It is possible, nevertheless, that the adoption of conserva- 
 tion methods, towards which some recent measures have been directed, could raise 
 the catch again to former or even somewhat higher levels. New fishing areas are 
 being opened near Mazatlan and SalinaCruz on the Pacific Coast and further expansion
