in Campeche on the Mexican Gulf Coast is possible. Increased production in these 
 regions could compensate for the decline in the Gulf of California area and allow 
 for some increase over the 1949 level if production in the Gulf of California again 
 increases. There seems to be no possibility of expanding the catch of the better 
 type of abalone novf being taken; prices are much lower for the other available 
 type s . 

Prospects for developing exports of additional fishery products are not good. 
 The output of sardines could be increased substantially even with existing equip-

 Tuna fishing on the high seas would require a basic reorientation of the Mexican 
 fishing industry and considera.ble new investment. A Mexican tuna-fishing industry 
 must also expect to encounter difficulites in competing with the tuna industries 
 of other countries because the Mexican labor law requirements would result in high

operating costs. Moreover, it can be assumed that the United States, the only 
 major market, would take whatever steps may be necessary to protect its own tuna- 
 fishing industry if confronted with increased supplies of tuna from abroad. Onthe 
 whole, therefore, it is improbable that the volume of fishery products exports from 
 Mexico will continue to expand more than slightly over the present level. 

In view of the not too favorable outlook for exports, the best opportunity for 
 expanding Mexican fisheries therefore lies in production for the domestic market.
