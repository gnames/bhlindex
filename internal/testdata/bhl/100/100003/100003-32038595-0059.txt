Although a remarkable increase in the consumption of fish occurred during World 
 War II, when consumption more than doubled in five years, the amount of fishery 
 products consumed annually in Mexico is still less than 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds) 
 per person (table 4). The level of consumption has been' almost stationary since

1946. There are no imminent limits on the supply of species consumed in the do- 
 mestic market; however, the low level of incomes, inadequate facilities for trans- 
 porting and handling fish, and an inefficient distribution system operating with 
 high margins seriously restrict the local market and the possibilities for expansion.

SINALOA SHRIMP FISHERY TRENDS , FEBRUARY 1953 : Sinaloa shrimp exports to the 
 United States in February totaled 560, 616 pounds, 45 percent less than in January, 

but 87 percent more than in February 1952 
 (see table) . 

The season for shrimp fishing in the 
 bays on the west coast of Mexico was de- 
 clared closed from March 1 to April 15, 
 1953, by the Secretaria de Marina, a 
 March 9 U. S. consular dispatch from Ma- 
 zatlan states. This will be an experiment 
 in an effort to stem the reported depletion of shrimp stocks off the West '"'oast. 
 It is believed that during the 45-day period that shrimp fishing will be banned, 
 the shrimp will migrate to the bays and estuaries for spawning, later returning to 
 the sea to grow. However, unlike last year, deep-sea shrimp fishing will continue 
 to the end of the season on July 1.

REVIEW OF THE FISHERIES , 1950 : The total catch of fishery products in Mozam- 
 bique during 1950 amounted to 9,271,280 pounds as compared with the 1949 catch of 
 8,557,289 pounds, reports a recent dispatch from Lourenco Marques. However, even 
 with this increase there was still not sufficient fish to supply the domestic re- 
 quirements. The 1950 catch consisted of 7,916,713 pounds of fresh fish, 181,072 
 pounds of shellfish, and 1,173,493 pounds of miscellaneous fishery products.
