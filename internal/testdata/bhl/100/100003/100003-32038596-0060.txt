Vol. 15, No. 5 

The two fishing companies that operated in Mozambique in 1949 dissolved dur- 
 ing 1950. This placed increased importance on the activities of small and inde- 
 pendent fishermen. Goanese and native fishermen operating with small trawlers 
 and sailing vessels were the backbone of the industry. In 1950 a total of 6,177 
 persons were engaged in fishing as compared with 4,753 in 1949. There were 12 
 trawlers and 1,303 sailing vessels operating in 1950 as against 7 trawlers and 
 1,042 sailing vessels in 1949. 

A United States citizen has chartered a trawling vessel from the Mozambique 
 Government and entered the spiny lobster fishing business. Under the terms of the 
 contract all fish taken on each voyage will be sold on the local market at fixed 
 prices, thus augmenting the local food supply. The spiny lobsters will be exported 
 to the United States. Aside from increasing the food supply, the dollar revenue 
 of the province will be increased.

 iced herring, klipfish (salted and sun-dried cod), fresh and iced fish other than 
 herring, frozen herring, stockfish (unsalted dried groundfish), and canned fish
