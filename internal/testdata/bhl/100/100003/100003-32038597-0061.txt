meal exported by Nor- 
 way, 30 percent or 38,110 
 tons were shipped to 
 the United States. Can- 
 ned fish and shellfish 
 exports to the United 
 States amounted to 
 9,580 tons â€” 39 percent 
 of the total Norwegian 
 exports . Norway' s ex- 
 ports of frozen fish 
 fillets totaled 12,661 
 tons, of which 6,142 
 tons or 49 percent were 
 shipped to the United 
 States. 

AUTOMATIC WEIGHING MACHINE FOR HERRING : Herring are automatically weighed 
 into boxes at a large plant in Bergen, Norway, by a weighing machine designed by 
 Magnus K. Johannessen of that city. He has specialized in the design and construc- 
 tion of packaging and weighing machines, according to the February 25 issue of 
 Fiskaren , a Norwegian trade paper. His solution to the problem of whether it is 
 better to weigh or measure herring is a machine which has a capacity of 200 weigh- 
 ings per hour and is accurate to within one or two herring. The herring are weighed 
 in a rotating drum and flow evenly from the drum into the box. Although the equip- 
 ment is designed for weighings of small quantities, the same system can be used 
 with herring for reduction plants. Weighing machines with a capacity of 100 tons 
 per hour or more can be built, it is claimed. 

WHALE AND SPERM OIL PRODUCTION , 1952/53 : Norway's production of whale and 
 sperm oil in the 1952/53 season was 135,200 long tons, including production of the 
 Antarctic whaling fleets and production at the Norwegian land station at Husvik 
 Harbour, South Georgia, but not including production at shore stations in Norway. 

The 1953 Antarctic pelagic whaling season ended at midnight, March 16, 1953, 
 with the Norwegian share of the total catch reduced approximately in proportionto 
 her reduced participation this year. Norway entered the race for whales with only 

7 expeditions, compared to 10 in 1952 (other countries 
 sent a total of nine expeditions each time). Three Nor- 
 wegian floating whale factories were transferred to more 
 profitable tanker operations. 

The Norwegian Antarctic pelagic whaling fleets this 
 season produced 738,100 barrels of whale oil and 27,400 
 barrels of sperm oil (6 barrels equal 1 long ton), com- 
 pared with 971,800 barrels of whale oil and 116,300 bar- 
 rels of sperm oil during the 1951/52 season (table 1). 
 As in previous years, the Norwegian companies which engage 
 in pelagic whaling sold their 1952/53 catch through a 
 common marketing pool. 

rfhile most of the seven Norwegian expeditions which 
 participated this season accounted for more whale oil
