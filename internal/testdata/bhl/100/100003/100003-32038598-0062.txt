than they did in 1952, the total catch was only 76 percent of last season's. The 
 production of sperm oil this season was uniformly poor, with the result that the 

total was down to 23 percent 
 of last season's. Because 
 of the poor market for sperm 
 oil this year, the Norwegian 
 whaling fleet arrived in the 
 Antarctic just prior to the 
 opening of the blue-whale sea-

son, thus missing the usual 
 pre-season sperm-whale oper- 
 ations. The entire fleet, 
 furthermore, returned directly 
 to Norway at the close of the 
 regular season. 

Since the average number 
 of catchers per expedition 
 was larger this year and since, 
 for the first time, helicopters and modern ultrasonic equipment were taken along 
 by some of the Norwegian expeditions, the authorities had been counting on a catch 
 of about 800,000 barrels. Helicopters were used this year by the Thorshavet and 
 Norhval expeditions; ultrasonic equipment designed to 
 bring whales to the surface was installed on some of 
 the catchers on an experimental basis. After the first 
 favorable reports began coming in, moreover, it appear- 
 ed that the Government's estimate had been pessimistic. 
 However, during the latter part of the season, some of 
 the Norwegian expeditions were hampered by bad weather. 

The total catch for the expeditions of all coun- 
 tries participating this year did not come so close to 
 the international limit of 16,000 blue-whale unitsl/ 
 as it had in 1952. With 7 of the 16 expeditions par- 
 ticipating this year, Norway accountedfor about 5,000 
 of the approximately 15,000 units reported. Last year 
 the proportion was 7,151 out of 15,875 units.

The stabilization of the 
 whale-oil price at the compar- 
 atively low level of L70 (US 
 $196) per long ton makes the 
 reduced production an even 
 harder bloxv to the Norwegian 
 economy. From a post-Korea 
 high of L170 (US$476), the 
 price had sunk to L120 (US$336) 
 by the fall of 1951. Then, 
 very rapidly in January 1952 
 the price dropped to L70 (US 
 $196). Norway's 1951/52 sea- 
 son production of whale oil 
 was finally disposed of at an 
 average of L82 (US$230) per 
 long ton. The average price 
 for the 1952/53 season was 
 L71 10s. (US$200) per long ton.
