COMMERCIAL FISHERIES REVIEW

In spite of a few advance sales at higher prices, the average price for this sea- 
 son's production has been only £71 10s. (US$200) per long ton. This year, for a 
 change, practically the entire production had been sold before the close of the 
 season. Considering both the reduced production and lower average price, it ap- 
 pears that Norway's income from pelagic whaling in 1953 will be less than two- 
 thirds of the 1952 figure. 

Most of Norway's whale-oil production was exported (table 3). 

The Norwegian shore station on South Georgia this season produced 43,300 bar- 
 rels of whale oil and 2,300 barrels of sperm oil (table 1). This was less than 
 the previous season's production of 47,100 barrels of whale oil and 1,500 barrels 
 of sperm oil, an April 29 American Embassy dispatch from Oslo points out. 

In addition to the above, shore stations in Norway produced 14,800 barrels 
 of sperm andwhale oil — about the same as during the previous season (table 2). 

Republic of the Philippines 

IMPORTS AND EXPORTS OF FISHERY PRODUCTS . 1951-52 : Philippine total imports 
 of fishery products from all countries in 1952 were valued at 15,826,000 pesos 
 (US$7, 913, 000), a decrease of 33 percent from the 1951 value of 23,709,000 pesos 
 (US$11,854,500). The Philippines normally import large quantities of California 
 sardines, but in 1952 that fishery was almost a complete failure; this no doubt 
 accounted for the large drop in imports of fishery products. 

Philippine exports of fishery products to all countries in 1952 were valued 
 at 96,000 pesos (US$48, 000), 2 percent less than in 1951 when exports were valued 
 at 98,000 pesos (US$49,000). 

Portugal 

COD INDUSTRY: Production of Salted Cod . 1952/53 : The landings of wet-salted 
 cod in Portugal during the 1952/53 season by the fleets fishing on the banks off 
 Newfoundland and Greenland amounted to 53,240 metric tons (table 1). This is a 9- 
 percent increase over the catch for the 1951/52 season, reports a March 20 U. S. 
 Embassy dispatch from Lisbon. The amount of dried cod obtained from this catch is
