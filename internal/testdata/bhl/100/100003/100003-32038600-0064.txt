not yet available as the fish is still in the process of drying; however, it is 
 expected to total about 38,680 metric tons. Total production of cod-liver oil and 
 other byproducts from the 1952/53 catch are not yet available.

fell substantially. In 1952 Nor- 
 wegian shipments decreased 66 
 percent and Canadian shipments 
 were off 57 percent from 1951. 
 The reduction appears to have 
 been due to high prices and, in 
 the case of Canada, to the fact 
 that payment in dollars was re- 
 quired for the first time. Pre- 
 viously, payment in sterling had 
 been accepted, even after New- 
 foundland became a part of Canada. 
 The Portuguese Supply Commission 
 absorbed losses due to higher 
 prices of imported cod in 1952. 
 In December retail price increases of 18 to 23 percent were announced for imported 
 cod to offset the 25-percent increase in the cost of importing. At the same time, 
 it was announced that "yellow-cured"l/ cod will be produced in Portugal for sale at 
 the same price as the imported product. 

The Minister of Economy stated that consumption for 1953 is estimated at 79.2 
 million pounds, of which 15.8 million pounds will be imported and 63.4 million 
 pounds supplied by the Portuguese fishing fleet. Of the latter, 10.6 million pounds 
 will be "yellow-cured." 

The supply of salted cod appeared to be adequate throughout 1952 despite the 
 substantial reduction in imports. It would appear that a further reduction in im- 
 ports is anticipated for 1953. 

All cod produced and imported was for domestic consumption. There were no 
 exports . 

J/IMPORTED COD IS "YELLOW-CURED" AND IS MUCH DRIER THAN PORTUGUESE NATIONAL CURED.

GOVERNMENT -SUPERVISED WHOLESALE FISH MARKET : The new wholesale fish market 
 recently completed at Bangkok commenced operations in April under the supervision 
 of the Thai Government, states a March 6 dispatch from the U. S. Embassy at Bangkok. 
 The new market was built at a cost of 6 million baht (US$478, 000) . A sum of 11 
 million baht (US$876, 000) has been appropriated from the 1953 national budget for 
 the installation of an ice and cold-storage plant , 

Thirteen fish-auctioneering companies (including one that is government-spon- 
 sored) have registered to operate at the market. Previously, 9 brokers controlled 
 the fresh marine-fish trade in Bangkok.
