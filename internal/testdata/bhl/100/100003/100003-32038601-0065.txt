STATUS OF ICELANDIC - BRITISH FISHING DISPUTE ; There is some speculation that 
 the Icelandic-British fishing dispute may be considered at the meeting of the Per- 
 manent Commission of the North European Overfishing Convention which is scheduled 
 to take place in London on May 5. This possibility was reported in the April 6 
 issue of the Manchester Guardian.

"...Here, on the Humber, leaders of the trawling industry at Grimsby and Hull 
 are eagerly awaiting the meeting of the permanent commission, confident that their 
 condemnation of Iceland's action and subsequent attitude will be upheld.
