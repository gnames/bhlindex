64 COMMERCIAL FISHERIES REVIEW Vol. 15, No. 5 

"The Icelandic Government, it will be remembered, announced in May (1950) 
 that, as a measure to conserve fishing grounds, the fishing limits off the Ice- 
 landic coasts would be extended from the old line drawn three miles from the coast 
 to a new limit drawn four miles from a line linking coastal headlands. To British 
 trawlers, long accustomed to fish in the bays of Iceland's deeply-indented coast, 
 the extension of enclosed waters was a heavy blow, depriving them, as they esti- 
 mate, of some one million hundredweights of better quality fish every year. Their 
 reply was to refuse at Hull and Grimsby to allow the Icelanders to use their own 
 privately-owned unloading facilities. 

"in/hen Icelandic trawlermen countered this with a plan to form a company to 
 provide landing facilities of their own, British skippers and mates refused to put 
 to sea at all until they had an understanding from merchants not to handle any 
 Icelandic fish. There, with Icelandic trawlers virtually excluded from British 
 ports, the matter now rests in a stalemate. 

"Representations from the British Government to Iceland have not been very 
 productive, and in any case, being a signatory of the Overfishing Convention, 
 Britain is somewhat inhibited in the matter of unilateral action. Under the pro- 
 visions of the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade the British Government could 
 not readily limit the landing of foreign-caught fish at British ports, so, although 
 the trawler-owners advocate governmental regulation of imports as a general policy, 
 it is to the Overfishing Convention rather than the Government that they are look- 
 ing for immediate support 

"Apart from uncertainty about the power of their Government to help them, the 
 British trawlermen have another reason for wanting the dispute heard at interna- 
 tional level. They are extremely apprehensive that other countries may follow 
 Iceland in extending fishing limits <> Iceland only acted after the Hague Court had 
 upheld a similar Norwegian claim. In the face of thi3, Iceland felt safe in ex- 
 tending her limits, and so, say the men of Hull and Grimsby, might Denmark; and, 
 in doing so, close the valuable grounds around the Faroe Islands. Again, Iceland, 
 and later others like her, might not for long be content with the headland line. 
 It is believed in Grimsby that the line of the Continental Shelf, the hundred- 
 fathom line, is already being talked about. 

"Iceland at present forbids her own trawlers to fish where those of other na- 
 tions are prohibited; but there are many in Grimsby who have no faith that she will 
 retain this equality of treatment once the new territorial-water line has been es- 
 tablished and internationally recognized...."
