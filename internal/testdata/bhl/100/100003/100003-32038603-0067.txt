May 1953 COMMERCIAL FISHERIES REVIEW 65 

Decree No. 4 states: "Article 1 — It is prohibited to fish with electric, 
 gasoline, or any other lamps in the interior waters or within a distance of 9,200 
 meters or 5 miles of the coast. Article 2 — The use in fishing of lines of argollas, 
 circles of nets, tarrafas, purse seines, is prohibited in the waters of the inter- 
 ior or within 9,200 meters or 5 miles of the coast. Article 3 — The use filetes 
 cariteros, tendidos de hilo, or ahorque in the interior waters or within a dis- 
 tance of 9,200 meters or 5 miles of the coast are also prohibited. Article 4 — 
 Infractions will be penalized with fines ranging from Bolivares 50 to Bolivares 
 10,000 (US$15-$3,000) and the confiscation of the materials." 

The Venezuelan Ministry of Agriculture states that the several local names 
 used above are: Article 1, forms of purse seines; Article 2, gill nets. Evidently 
 there are numerous forms of netting differing somewhat in various regions of the 
 country. In this resolution an attempt is being made to prohibit two general types 
 of nets — purse seines and gill nets. 

In an interpretation of the new regulations, the Minister of Agriculture 
 stated that they do not apply to large streams such as the Orinoco, a dispatch 
 from the U. S. Embassy at Caracas states. In that river the methods prohibited 
 for small streams will not apply.

PEARL FISHING IN 1953 SEASON NOT PROFITABLE : The 1953 Venezuelan pearl-oys- 
 ter season was not profitable, reports a March 9 U. S. Embassy dispatch from Caracas. 
 A total of 219 boats engaged in the fishery this year off the Island of Margarita 
 from January 1 to April 1. The total average catch for the fleet was between 30 
 and 50 carats of pearls per day, about 35 percent lower than the last previous 
 pearling season in 1951. The pearls are valued at between 1 and lg bolivares (29 
 and 45 U. S. cents) per carat, not much lower than in 1951. 

In 1912 pearls averaged about 6 bolivares (US$1. 79i/) per carat, but have 
 never been as high since. In 1940 the Banco Agricola y Pecuario established a 
 floor price for the principal grade "small round" of 2.20 bolivares (69 U.S. cents2/) 
 per carat and had to purchase almost the entire harvest. This year, it is stated, 
 the Bank finally disposed of 100,000 carats of its several years supply at 1.80 
 bolivares (54 U. S. centsl/) , 

It is believed that the world-wide changing tastes in jewels has reduced the 
 demand for pearls 

V BASED ON CURRENT EXCHANGE RATE: 3.35 BOLIVARES EQUAL US$1.00. 
 2/ 1940 EXCHANGE RATE: 3.19 BOLIVARES EQUAL US$1.00.
