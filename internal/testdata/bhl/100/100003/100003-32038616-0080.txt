Washington Department of Fisheries . Sixty-Second 
 Annual Report , 128 p., printed. Washington State 

Department of Fisheries, 1308 Smith Tower, Seattle 
 k, Washington, 1953. Discusses the problems and 
 policies of the Department of Fisheries, with par- 
 ticular reference to the rehabilitation of the 
 salmon fisheries. The research and management 
 program for both fish and shellfish, and the De- 
 partment 1 s artificial propagation activities are 
 commented on in considerable detail. Coopera- 
 tive programs with other 3tates, the FederalGov- 
 ernment, and the International Pacific Salmon 
 Commission are discussed. The report likewise 
 contains information on the Department's enforce- 
 ment program, the orders of the Director issued 
 in 1951 and 1952, a list of departmental per- 
 sonnel, a summary of 1951 catch statistics, his- 
 torical data on the catch of fishery products, 
 and the pack of canned salmon.

SCHOOLING FISH CAN SEE 

Vision plays a dominant role in the schooling of fish, although other senses 
 may contribute. Only in tuna schools do individual fish act as leaders. 

Fish that cannot see one another will not school, nor even form into aggre- 
 gations, reports Dr. James W. Atz, ichthyologist of the New York Zoological Society. 
 Vision plays the dominant role in fish schooling, although other senses like touch, 
 hearing, and smell may have lesser parts. 

A true school of fish is a group in which all individuals are facing a common 
 direction, parallel and regularly spaced, and moving at a uniform speed. Aggrega 
 tions are groups in which fish are attracted together but without uniform spacing 
 or direction. 

There may be cases of "false schooling," when aggregations of fish line up in 
 the same direction in response to a water current. In an experiment with sunfish 
 ( Lepomis ) , an aggregation all lined up regularly when a current was started in 
 their tank, but the group broke up as soon as the flow was stopped. 

One popular theory explains fish schooling to work essentially this way: 

(1) two or more fish swim towards each other when they come into visual range; 

(2) they line up in parallel paths to keep each other in the desired close range 
 while on the move or in a strong current; (3) a certain antagonism, however, may 
 act to keep them a minimum distance apart. 

Another idea is that schooling fish us'e one another as visual reference points, 
 to help locate themselves in the empty space of water. Typical schooling fish are 
 usually those of the open sea, where there is practically nothing — except another 
 fish — for a constantly moving fish to fix upon to give him a -sense of location. 

In general, fish in the center of a school are much closer together than those 
 nearer the edge. With the exception of tuna schools, there are no reports that in- 
 dividual fish act as leaders of schools.
