Federal regulations require that all 
 mailing lists be circularized periodically. 
 A circularization letter dated May 15 was 
 sent to all those on the Commercial Fish er- 
 ies Review mailing list. ( Individuals or 
 firms who have requested their names added 
 to the mailing list subsequent to March 1, 
 1953, will not receive a circularization 
 letter and will be retained on the mailing 
 list, unless the recipient meanwhile requests 
 that his name be removed.) 

Firms or individuals who do not return 
 the circularization letter will be dropped 
 from the Commercial Fisherie s Review mail- 
 ing list. The June 1953 issue will be the 
 last one to be mailed to those in the Unitsd 
 States who do not reply, and the August 1953 
 issue will be the last one for those in for- 
 eign countries. If you don't want to miss 
 any issues of the Review , return the cir- 
 cularization letter promptly. 

Comments or suggestions regarding the 
 Review will be appreciated by the editors.
