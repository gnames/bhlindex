STYELOI DES EVISOERANS. 

budded from a parent stock. There is however, so far as I could ascertain by dissection, 
 no organic union. 

Why one species should act in the way described while another attached perhaps 
 to the same stone does not, is a question not easily answered, . ut the fact affords 
 a special case of self-mutilation or autotomy, a jmenomenon of wide distribution in the 
 animal kingdom, varying greatly in its manifestations. 

Fig. 10. Group of seven individuals of Styeloides eviscerans, represented as lying attached to the surface 
 of a fragment of stone. In the large individual to the right the digestive tract is indicated in process of 
 extrusion through the atrial aperture, a. Anus with frilled margin, i. Intestine, br. s. Branchial sac. 
 e. Endostyle. h. Foreign organisms attached to test. (From Quart. J. Micr. Sci., Vol. 39, 1896.) 

The genus Styeloides was established in 1885 by Dr Sluiter 1 for a species found 
 by him near Batavia, which appeared to be normally destitute of a branchial sac. 
 Subsequently he returned to the subject and suggested that the branchial sac and 
 intestine are lost in the adult period only' 2 .
