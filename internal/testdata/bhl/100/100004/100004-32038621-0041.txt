RHODOSOMA HUXLEYI. 711 

More recently Dr Sluiter has accepted my observations as affording an explanation 
 of the absence of the branchial sac in Styeloides, and he thinks that this generic name 
 should lapse in favour of Polycarpa 1 . 

Another notewj.thy Ascidian which I found in Blanche Bay on a reef-patch off 
 Baravon, is called Rhodosoma huxleyi, and was described under the name Per a huxleyi 
 in 1862 by Dr J. D. Macdonald, who obtained his material from the Bellona Reef 2 . 
 The peculiarity of Rhodosoma is this, that the upper portion of the test fits like 
 a lid upon the rest of the tunicary and can be raised and depressed like the valve 
 of a lamellibranchiate Mollusc. Compared with those bivalve Molluscs where one 
 valve is fixed to the substratum, the action of the lid of Rhodosoma which protects 
 the siphons bears a striking analogy to that of the freely hinged valve of the former. 
 It is, in fact, a good example of parallel evolution, a phenomenon of wide occurrence 
 and profound significance, but not always easy to recognise. By what may be termed 
 a singular coincidence, the late distinguished Professor H. de Lacaze-Duthiers 3 , who was 
 one of the first to publish a full account of Rhodosoma, was at great pains to demon- 
 strate the supposed molluscoid affinities of the Ascidians, and the discovery of a species 
 of this peculiar valvate genus confirmed him in what most naturalists will now admit 
 to have been an interesting and instructive error.

Finally there is a third Ascidian which is abundant in Blanche Bay and 
 neighbouring localities (New Guinea, etc.) and claims notice on account of its size and

 whether the viscera can be regenerated, but Dr Sluiter thinks he has found indications of a regeneration of 
 the endostyle in Styeloides abranchiata.
