714 NATIVE FANCIES. 

a patch of the long grass called kune or kunai, which is used for thatching houses, she 
 heard something rustle in the grass, but in searching for a " nialira " was unable to find 
 one. Whereupon with true native logic she made a long detour and finally found her 
 victim hiding away with a couple of cocoa-nuts, as he knew his "nimuna" was passing 
 through the neighbourhood and he could not let her see him with food in his hands. 
 In consequence of the woman's assertions her husband demanded ten fathoms of diwara 
 from the alleged offender although there was no proof whatever against him. If the 
 woman heard anything at all in the grass it was most likely a lizard and she concocted 
 her story on the strength of it. The last I heard of the affair was that the parties 
 had submitted the matter to Mrs Parkinson's arbitration. 

In the course of my relations with my assistants I became acquainted with several 
 of the minor traits of the native character. 

Sometimes they fall ill and ascribe their malady to the influence of "puta." They 
 are very careful to conceal or destroy all waste-products of their food, an admirable 
 custom, but if they fail to do so by inadvertence, an enemy can collect the refuse and 
 work mischief with it by sorcery. This branch of sorcery is called " puta " and one of 
 my men, To-warabur, fell a victim to it, according to his own account. 

When they see a log of wood or a bamboo-stem, floating vertically in the water 
 and bobbing up and down, as often happens, they are frightened and filled with 
 veneration for it, calling it " a tuk." On one occasion we passed such a drifting 
 bamboo rod upon the top of which there were some accidental marks so disposed as 
 to convey a grotesque resemblance to the human face. One of my boys, To-iraran, fled 
 behind the mast in terror of this ill-omened taberan or demon. I then learnt that 
 a former assistant of mine, a " koloata " or man of the bush, called To-bokat, who had 
 fallen sick and returned to his village, had traced his affliction to the retribution due 
 to him for having innocently hurled some stones at one of these vagrant logs. 

Once I thought I had purchased the fidelity of two bearded men of Davaun but 
 they disappeared during the night. I went to Davaun the next day to demand an 
 explanation and was told that To-palavur's mother was sick and had said " very good 
 they no go belong whity man." This affords an illustration of the working of the native 
 idea of the " kubak," according to which the friends and relatives of a sick person who 
 have slept within the same house or enclosure as the patient cannot spend a night 
 elsewhere without causing a turn for the worse. 

In the middle of July I left Karavia to take up my quarters in a recently vacated 
 trader's house at Baravon on the other side of the bay, where there is good anchorage 
 during the south-east season. I stayed here for some time, the chief objection to the 
 place being that it was overrun by rats, which manifested the utmost impudence and 
 indifference to the presence of a white man in their midst. 

In August I paid a visit to the Credner Islands, called locally the Pigeon Islands, 
 of which Nanuk is the smaller and Palakuvur the larger. These uninhabited islands are 
 purely coral-formations, covered with vegetation, surrounded by reefs with a passage 
 between the islands and a beach of white calcareous sand. On a subsequent occasion 
 I procured here numbers of the interesting Enteropneust, Ptychodera ruficollis, but this 
 time I accidentally incapacitated myself for serious work by biting into an uncooked
