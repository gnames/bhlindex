taro. I had anchored on the reef at Nanuk for the night, it being high water, and 
 intended to sleep on the boat while my boys lighted a fire and made themselves 
 comfortable on the beach, cooking taro for themselves and for me. During the night 
 it rained and thundered, and thinking to console myself with a taro I groped in the 
 dark amongst the litter of ropes and gear, picked up one of these excellent fruits of 
 the earth and made a lusty bite into it. It proved to be uncooked but I recovered 
 from the dire effects within the twenty-four hours. 

In the middle of August a note was brought to me from Mr Reuben Buckley, 
 a trader quartered in the Malagunan district quite at the other end of Blanche Bay, 
 saying that Nautilus was also found off the north coast of the Gazelle Peninsula. 
 Accordingly the next day I paddled over to Malagunan and was conducted overland 
 to a place called Matakabang on the north coast, the road between these two villages 
 being flanked on the east by the heights of the North Daughter. From Matakabang 
 we pulled across to a district at the head of Talili Bay called Unakamkambi, where 
 there was another trading station tenanted by Mr MacNicoll. Here I made arrangements 
 for traps to be set for Nautilus and next day returned to Blanche Bay to raise up 
 some coral blocks which I had previously sunk in a selected spot in about 80 fathoms. 
 On examining the coral trees I found numbers of the large Ostracod crustacean which 
 has been described by Mr Stebbing under the name Asterope arthuri, but no signs 
 of Nautilus. 

The next morning I set sail for Unakamkambi, rounding Praed Point and Cape 
 Stephens. I spent the best part of a month at this place, having found the conditions 
 for pursuing my search for the young of Nautilus almost as favourable in the south-east 
 season in Talili Bay as they were in Blanche Bay, but not more so ; in the north-west 
 season I think it would be impossible to operate in Talili Bay. Near the eastern limit 
 of Talili Bay there was a Catholic Mission station, administered by Pere Bley, and at the 
 western point a Wesleyan Mission station, presided over by Rev. J. A. Crump, at the 
 village of Kabakada adjoining Unakamkambi. 

I have made occasional reference to certain New Britain usages according as I had 
 opportunity to observe or to take part in them, and it is impossible to leave this island 
 without a word concerning two of its most characteristic and well-known institutions, the 
 Dukduk and the Tubuan. They are cognate organisations ordained for the glorification 
 of departed chiefs and to promote the circulation of diwara, although this brief statement 
 does not exhaust the sum of their functions. It appears that the Tubuan is supposed to 
 die periodically and to be born again. I once witnessed a most interesting representation 
 of the resurrection of the Tubuan, which took place opposite to my house at Barawon 
 near the village ruled over by an important chief named To-kinkin. 

At midnight, in the month of July (1895) a couple of Tubuans from Matupi. escorted 
 by a fleet of forty or fifty canoes, arrived at To-kinkin's place. They had brought with 
 them a carved human emblem representing a personage whom they called To-ririg, 
 doubtless a great man of former days. This circumstance suggested to me the possibility 
 â€¢ of the dukduk and its subsidiary tubuan being a means by which the history of the
