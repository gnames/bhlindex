716 TTJBUAN AND DUKDUK. 

tribe is handed down from one generation to another 1 . Throughout the rest of the night 
 the natives uttered awe-inspiring howls at frequent intervals. After sunrise they took 
 to their canoes again, the two Tubuans in separate canoes, and the entire flotilla pulled 
 out to the middle of the bay, where they came to rest. The Tubuans thereupon 
 executed an elegant dance with due restraint in their respective canoes, apparently 
 illustrating their regeneration from the sea in the manner of Aphrodite'-. The setting 
 for the performance provided by the natural features of the bay was most picturesque 
 and impressive, and the effect was heightened by the chant which was intoned by the 
 assistants.

The more important Dukduk is dressed like the Tubuan in the bird-costume, the 
 chief difference being that the conical head-dress of the former is much longer than that 
 worn by the Tubuan. The Dukduk observance may be a very elaborate ceremony 3 , but 
 for my part I saw some dukduks on the beach at Matupi on one occasion only. I was 
 informed that they had been engaged by an old chief who expected to die but recovered. 

On several other occasions while I was in New Britain a Tubuan was to be seen 
 dancing along the beach skirting Blanche Bay, shouting to scare the women. Sometimes 
 the Tubuans are engaged instead of the Dukduks, I think on account of the smaller 
 expense, to celebrate the funeral rites of a deceased chief. None were present at the 
 only native funeral which I attended, but another funeral was taking place elsewhere 
 at the same time, at which two Tubuans were employed. 

If the seven principal features of New Britain life which I have briefly touched 
 upon be enumerated in the following order, pepe, maravot, igiat, paraparau, malira, 
 tubuan, dukduk, we shall gain I think a fairly accurate insight into the sequence of 
 ceremonial observances in this wonderful island. 

Towards the end of September (1895) the " Ivanhoe," a topsail schooner of 
 152 tons, Capt. James Steele, unexpectedly arrived at Herbertshohe from British New 
 Guinea on a trading cruise. She was to return to Cooktown by way of New Guinea 
 and after long consideration I determined to continue my quest in the neighbourhood of 
 Milne Bay, knowing well the importance of keeping on the move while engaged in such 
 work as that to which I was committed. I took leave of my kind friends at Ralum with

2 The costume of the Tubuan, consisting of a tall conical mask topped by a plume of white feathers 
 and passing below into a heavy stack of leaves reaching from the shoulder's to the knees, is intended to 
 represent the figure of a bird, and what is known of bird-symbolism may suffice to justify the above com- 
 parison, although I have no actual information on the subject.
