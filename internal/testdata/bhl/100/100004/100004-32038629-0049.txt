Bay. It is true that a single specimen of Nautilus umbilicatus was picked up from 

the surface of the neighbouring sea and reached my hands later in a mangled condition. 

From this circumstance it would seem possible 

that systematic search on an extensive scale 

with unlimited equipment would discover a 

Nautilus ground in New Guinea waters. But 

from all I can hear, it is likely that the 

Philippine Islands will prove to be the vantage 

ground for this investigation 1 . 

An old pearler whom I met in Milne Bay 
 on board his cutter informed me that he did 
 not think Nautilus lives in Milne Bay, but the 
 shell drifts into the bay from the windward 
 from such places as Teste Island, Brooker 
 Island and the Du Chateau Islands 2 , although 
 some natives said they had taken it in the bay 
 long ago. 

Shortly after leaving Milne Bay I was 
 sorry to lose the services of my native skipper, 
 Suopa, who was a cheery fellow as well as a 
 handy man. Knowing that it was my ultimate 
 intention to leave New Guinea in order to seek 
 out some more likely place, he one day offered 
 to follow me wherever the four winds might 
 take me, not caring even if it should so fall 
 out that he never returned home. I was rather 
 touched by this assurance of devotion, the more 
 so because I knew that it would be contrary 
 to regulations to accept his offer of service 

away from New Guinea, but I was quite unprepared for the reaction which set in the 
 very next day when he demanded money and freedom, and, not content with these, 
 began raking up old scores as a reason for leaving. 

Next day I sailed east, in the direction of the Conflict Group, with a crew of 
 three mop-headed youths, including a little fellow whom we called " Cookie," but whose 
 real name was Taliwanedi, a native of Sanaroa. 

The distances between the numerous groups of islands into which the eastern 
 division of Papua is subdivided, are not very great, but the opposing winds, currents 
 and calms render navigation uncertain and sometimes precarious even to a seasoned 
 mariner.

On the 14th of January, while nearly becalmed and drifting within sight of the 
 low-lying western islets of the Conflict Group, a shell of Sepia, often called the cuttle-

 - I had intended to visit these islands, but the imminence of the south-west monsoon in this region 
 prevented me from getting farther east than the Deboyne Group, except at a risk of being wind-bound.
