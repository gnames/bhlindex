The fact of biradial symmetry means, of course, that there are two planes of 
 symmetry which divide the body respectively into two equal halves. One of these 
 planes passes through the muscular pinnate tentacles, and is called the tentacular plane 
 of Gtenoplana and of the Ctenophora generally. The other plane cuts the tentacular 
 plane at right angles, and corresponds to the so-called stomachal or gastral plane of 
 the Ctenophora. Corresponding with these two planes we have the two axes, namely, 
 the tentacular axis and the gastral axis. 

Armed with a few new facts, one is strangely tempted to enter the lists of 
 biological speculation and take one's chance in the meUe, or in other words, to make 
 some addition to the discussion concerning the relation of the above-named planes and 
 axes of biraclially symmetrical animals to the planes and axes of bilaterally symmetrical 
 animals such as Turbellarians and Annelids. The chief question which fixes the attention 
 of the observer is this: â€” Is it the tentacular plane or the gastral plane which is 
 homologous with the sagittal plane of a bilateral worm ? or, to put it more brusquely, 
 Is it the tentacular axis or the gastral axis which corresponds with the oro-anal axis 
 of a Nemertine or an Annelid ? 

It might be and I believe it has been contended that there is no ground for 
 comparison between the axes of a Ctenophore and those of a worm, in which case 
 the question propounded above has no point. Freely admitting that this may be true, 
 there is still room to suppose that it may not be true. Assuming therefore that one 
 or other of the biradial planes must represent the sagittal plane of higher forms, I 
 give it as my own conviction that the tentacular plane of Gtenoplana about which the 
 aboral ciliated sensory papillae are disposed in paired groups as shown in Fig. 13, 
 coincides with the sagittal plane of a bilateral Turbellarian, Nemertine, or Annelid. 

Much as the prominent pinnate tentacles of Gtenoplana 1 simulate transversely-paired 
 organs, they are not more paired than are the ciliated sensory tentacles of the same 
 animal. Both these organic systems, however, are paired about different planes and it 
 is to this circumstance that the discussion which I have outlined is due. I simply 
 desire to emphasize what I believe to be theoretically sound, namely, that if the 
 above-named planes are held to be respectively comparable, then the tentacular plane 
 of Gtenoplana and of the Ctenophores 2 represents the sagittal plane and the pinnate 
 tentacles occur in this plane, like the proboscis of the Nemertines. Either there is 
 no correspondence at all or the tentacular and sagittal planes are homologous, but to 
 my mind there can be no question of the gastral axis of Gtenoplana corresponding 
 with the antero-posterior or oro-anal axis of the bilateral forms. 

Whatever the truth may be, Gtenoplana remains a remarkably interesting type and 
 no zoologist could encounter specimens of it without experiencing a momentary thrill 

1 The same applies to tbe Ctenophora in a less obvious sense. For discussion of the axes of Ctenophora 
 the reader should consult Prof. Chun's Monograph, Die Ctenophoren des Golfes von Neapel, 1880. 

2 This is the view, as concerning the Ctenophora, which was first held by Professor Chun, but he seems 
 to have made a subsequent retractation.
