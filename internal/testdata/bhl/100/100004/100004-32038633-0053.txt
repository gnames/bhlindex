of satisfaction. Of the four specimens which I obtained three were mottled with green, 
 the fourth with red pigment; the former were rather larger than the red variety and 
 differed from it somewhat in shape. The red form also differed in minor details from 
 the original type Gtenoplana kowalevskii Korotneff. Nevertheless, with added experience 
 of specific divergencies, I am now inclined to think that my Ctenoplana rosacea is 
 co-specific with Korotneff 's type, and it seems quite likely that the green form is 
 nothing more than a variety or phase of the same species. 

All the green individuals contained male gonads with their genital ducts, but I 
 was unfortunately unable to satisfy myself concerning the female gonads. It should be 
 noted that great care and the application of very special methods are requisite for the 
 preservation of Gtenoplana. It is well known that some of the Ctenophora dissolve 
 away before one's eyes in certain fluids, and although Gtenoplana does not vanish in 
 this way, the contraction of the tentacular musculature is apt, in healthy specimens, 
 to cause a lamentable shrinkage. 

In his recent account of the Ctenophora 1 Mr G. C. Bourne places Ctenoplana and 
 the allied genus Goeloplana in a special order of Ctenophora Tentaculata, which he 
 names Platyctenea, at the same time declining " to attach very much importance to 
 the resemblance between Gtenoplana and the Polyclada." Mr Bourne further comes to 
 the conclusion "that the Turbellaria, the Nemertines and the Ctenophora are descended 
 from a common ancestor which is most nearly represented by the larva of Stylochus" 
 [a Polyclade worm]. This is mainly in accordance with the views which I expressed 
 in my paper, and Mr Bourne quotes the Pilidium larva of Nemertines in his 
 comparison, as I also did. Moreover, the term Platyctenea is undoubtedly preferable 
 to the term which I suggested, Archiplanoidea, as an ordinal name, but I am unwilling 
 to refuse any importance to the latter name. I intend it to embody the proposition 
 originally laid down in its main principles by Prof. Chun, that the bilateral Plathelminthes 
 generally have originated from a biradially symmetrical ancestor, and further to express 
 the possibility of the diphyletic origin of triploblastic animals. 

After much labour against the tide we managed to get to a temporary anchorage 
 off the westerly islet of the Conflict Group, intending to make the lagoon before dark, 
 but failing to find the passage we spent a squally night tacking about. Towards the 
 evening a remarkable procession of transparent pelagic animals, Ctenophora of several 
 different kinds, including the ribbon-shaped Cestus, drifted past the islet. These creatures, 
 as I have said, are most difficult to preserve, as they have the peculiar property of 
 undergoing instantaneous disintegration and dissolution under certain conditions of 
 treatment. 

Next morning I had quite lost my bearings and suddenly found myself heading 
 straight for the reef, but I got the jib and sail down just in time to avoid a collision. 
 It was not until the following sundown that we found the passage and anchored in 
 the lagoon. Just about this time the south-west wind began to blow and I found 
 the lagoon with its loose sandy bottom a most uncomfortable anchorage. In this region
