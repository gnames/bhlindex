PROCHORDATA. 

729 

Tabulation of structures concerned in the formation of the anterior trematic complex of the 
 Prochordata, consisting of organs which are probably homogenetic and of their connections which are 
 presumably related through metaleptic succession or substitution. 

I. Enteropneosta. 

II. TONICATA. 

III. Cephalochorda. 

Proboscis 

with a head-cavity or proboscis 
 coelom communicating by a coe- 
 lomic orifice with the proboscis 
 pore-canal (or end-vesicle) which 
 opens externally by the proboscis- 
 pore in the vicinity of the anterior 
 neuropore. 

Organ of fixation 

with a cavity in which mesen- 
 chyme-cells circulate ; probably a 
 degenerate coelomic cavity but 
 neither blastocoel nor haemocoel ; 
 it is a deuterocoel sui generis. 

Rostrum 

with a head-cavity which becomes 
 divided in the embryo into right 
 and left portions, the former con- 
 stituting the rostral cavity and the 
 latter the praeoral pit of the larva 
 and the ciliary cotnplex at the roof 
 and sides of the oral hood in the 
 adult. The praeoral pit repre- 
 sents, inter alia, the coelomic 
 orifice of I., being removed from 
 dorsal surface by intervention of 
 notochord ; physiologically it is 
 comparable with the dorsal tubercle 
 of II. 

Proboscis pore-canal 

which, as indicated above, opens 
 externally near to or in common 
 with the anterior neuropore. 

Neuro-hypophysial canal 

or duct of the subneural gland. 
 It arises in primary continuity 
 with the wall of the cerebral vesicle 
 with which it remains in com- 
 munication in the larva by an 
 intracerebral orifice ; at the other 
 (oral) end it opens into the vesti- 
 bule of the branchial sac by an 
 intrabuccal orifice which gives rise 
 to the dorsal tubercle of the adult. 

Olfactory pit 

into which the anterior neuropore 
 opens in the larva. 

Ventral mouth 

of larva and adult. 

Dorsal mouth 

of larva (with which the neuro- 
 hypophysial canal communicates) 
 becoming the buccal siphon of 
 adult. 

Sinistral mouth 

of larva (separated together with 
 the praeoral pit from association 
 with the neuropore by intervention 
 of notochord) becoming the median 
 ventral velum in the adult, the 
 innervation of which, according to 
 the discovery of Professor Van 
 Wijhe, remains sinistral. 

Having obtained the necessary permission from the authorities of the French 
 administration I left Noumea on July 18 on board a local steamer for the Isle of Pines, 
 accomplishing the journey of 65 miles in nine hours. The southern coast of New 
 Caledonia is studded locally with forests of Araucaria, and the Isle of Pines is a hilly 
 satellite of the larger island, and likewise affords some exquisite coast scenery. It is used 
 as a penitentiary establishment, the native population being confined to a reservation on 
 one side of the island, the most picturesque side, where it is controlled by the Mission 
 authorities under the direction of Pere Lambert, who is a renowned conchologist. I paid
