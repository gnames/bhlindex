730 ISLE OF PINES AND MARE. 

several visits to the native who was the nominal chief of the tribe, but he failed to 
 understand my wishes and showed me no hospitality. I made an abortive attempt to 
 reach his heart by means of a present, which he accepted, and sent a man in brass 
 buttons to me on the following day to know what it was for. 

Altogether I found the Isle of Pines an unsatisfactory .place in which to pursue my 
 special and peculiar avocation, and the eighteen days which I spent here were only 
 relieved by two circumstances, namely, the opportunity of studying Ptychodera flava 
 which I found at low tide in sandy rock pools on the coralline platform at the base of 
 the cliffs where the breakers expend their fury, and secondly the companionship of my 
 native servant, an important chief from Lifu who had been exiled from his native place 
 for drunkenness accompanied by violence. A man of forty with a distinguished face and 
 bearing, speaking fair English and better French, he served me well in return for his 
 food and one franc a day. He would have made an ideal " roi de Lifu " but for his 
 addiction to the vile vitriol which does duty for liquor. He answered, temporarily, to the 
 name of Eugene, and in the course of conversation he strongly urged me to make for 
 Lifu rather than Mare - , although I had been thinking of the latter. Fortunately his 
 counsels prevailed and I left the Isle of Pines on August 5 in a cutter manned by Mar6 
 islanders. We anchored for the night at a point called Gadji, at the northern end of the 
 Isle Of Pines. Here there are extensive reefs, mud-flats, quicksands and sand which is 
 strongly elastic, rebounding to the tread like india-rubber, imparting an unusual and 
 somewhat exhilarating sensation. There are also numerous islets clothed with vegetation 
 and undermined in a characteristic manner by the action of the sea 1 . 

The next morning at 4 a.m. we left Gadji with the rising of the moon and had 
 a fair wind to Mare, where we arrived at sundown. There is some difficulty in landing 
 here as the rock-bound coast drops sheer into the sea, and the rudeness of the rocks 
 simply anticipates the astonishing inhospitality of the natives. It is true I presented 
 a dilapidated appearance, especially after walking over the scraggy limestone surface of 
 the island, and had it not been for the good offices of a petty chief called Wainani, who 
 had been a fellow passenger on the cutter, I should have been in a still more desolate 
 condition, being already mistaken for a libere. The Government representative on Mare 
 was the Commandeur, M. Journot, who entertained me at luncheon on my way to the 
 great chief Neisselin at Netchi. With the best will my friend Wainani none the less led 
 me into a trap, by which I became exposed to the merciless and humiliating diatribes 
 of Neisselin's wife, delivered in excellent English. The population of Mare consists of 
 Catholics and Protestants, and the latter have for some years been left without a white 
 shepherd, but they conduct their own services with a gusto which must be heard to be 
 appreciated. 

Besides the usual beehive huts they have white plaster houses which are rather 
 oppressive. I boarded with a native called Ito Pupu and after prayers went to bed. 
 Next day he informed me that his father had partaken of white man. I had agreed 
 with a tall handsome bearded native called Waiyowara, the owner of a cutter, for my 
 passage to Lifu, the arrangement being that he would call for me at a certain place 
 and time. He was not punctual, and such was my anxiety to leave this island where 

1 Similar mushroom-shaped islets occur in the Fijis and have been described and figured by Mr J. Stanley 
 Gardiner in the Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc, Vol. ix. Part 8, 1898; see p. 459.
