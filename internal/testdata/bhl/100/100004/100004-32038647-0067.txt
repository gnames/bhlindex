ASTROSCLERA. 733 

twenty-five francs. Near the end of January, 1897, we had a visitation of wind, probably 
 the trail of a_ hurricane, which played havoc with my baskets, and cost the lives of 
 some sixteen Nautili. Shortly afterwards I lost another " thingit " containing six pairs of 
 Nautili in forty fathoms, and on March 8 left Lifu in a small schooner, bound for 
 Noumea, calling at Uvea on the way. 

Apart from Nautilus I obtained many valuable accessions to my general collection 
 at Lifu. A large proportion of Sandal Bay is flanked by terraced limestone cliffs from 
 seventy to a hundred feet in height. The base is excavated by the sea, as in the case 
 of the mushroom-shaped islets which I have previously mentioned, and halfway up the 
 face of the cliff there is an exactly similar excavation. From the base of the cliff the 
 water deepens rather rapidly to about forty fathoms, and then there is a sudden drop, 
 showing the existence of a remarkable submarine ledge of dead, shaly rock. I dragged 
 along this forty fathom ledge with a grapnel in the hope of recovering one of my 
 " thingits," which had disappeared, and it was here that I found some peculiar calcareous 
 growths which I preserved, although I had no inkling of what their true nature might 
 be, suspecting them rather to be Foraminifera. In Mr J. J. Lister's hands they have 
 proved to represent a very interesting form of calcareous sponge, Astrosclera, offering 
 a curious superficial resemblance to the mesozoic Pharetrones 1 . 

I also described a curious flatworm 2 from Lifu under the name of Heteroplana, 
 but the generic properties which I ascribed to it are open to another interpretation. 
 The shape of the body was peculiar, symmetrical in front, not quite symmetrical behind, 
 unlike anything else I had seen. 

Examination with lens and microscope in the living state revealed the fact that 
 the organs of the left side, principally the intestinal diverticula, were suppressed. I found 
 the worm in a hole on the lower side of a coral block 3 and on account of its large 
 size, semi-opaque orange colour, characteristic shape and other peculiarities, gave it the 
 above name. It has been suggested that Heteroplana is a phase in the regeneration 
 of a mutilated Polyclade worm. If this be so I cannot account for its very definite 
 external form, but at any rate the genus must remain in abeyance until more light is 
 thrown upon this subject 4 . 

The population of Lifu, like that of the other Loyalty Islands, is now entirely 
 Christian, being divided between the Catholic and Protestant communions. The two great 
 hereditary chiefs of the island, Ukenesoe and Bula, who formerly waged incessant warfare 
 with each other, are now the respective champions of the rival creeds. The social 
 organisation is somewhat communistic so far as this is compatible with the existence 
 of chiefs, and it sometimes happens that even such valuable property as a horse is 
 readily yielded up to the first importunate acquaintance who casts envious eyes upon it. 
 But of course a return present will be exacted sooner or later. If I gave something 
 of value, tackle, food or money, to my man, it was quite a chance if I did not find it 
 shortly in the possession of somebody else in whom I had no particular interest.

2 I collected a number of Polyclade worms which I have sent to Prof. A. Lang at Zurich. For notes

3 Repeated and laborious search failed to elicit any more specimens.
