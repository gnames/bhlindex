This is neither the time nor the opportunity for the composition of a costly 
 monograph on Nautilus. It will be time when the embryonic stages have been 
 discovered and opportunity when it is possible for an investigator to command the 
 requisite knowledge and material to permit of detailed comparisons being made, step 
 by step, between more or less distantly related types. I am only able to furnish 
 a contribution which partakes of the nature of a monograph in a strictly limited 
 sense of the term. The new matter contained in these pages consists of facts and 
 suggestions some of which have been already published in a preliminary form, and 
 relates principally to the following aspects of the subject: — bionomics (habits, range, 
 oviposition), branchial sense-organs (osphradia), mechanism of respiration, injection of the 
 vascular system, connections of the siphuncle, innervation of the ophthalmic tentacles, 
 development of the accessory sexual organs, enumeration of the digital tentacles, 
 orientation, and specific divergence. 

1. Historical Survey. 

The bibliography of Nautilus includes so many memoirs of the first order of 
 importance written at varying intervals by experienced anatomists of different schools 
 and countries during the last seventy years, as to convey the impression that its 
 conchological, malacological and biological properties must be well-nigh established and 
 that the only scope for further contributions to knowledge must take the direction of 
 physiological and embryological researches. Such however is not the case, and so far 
 as the finer anatomy and oecology of Nautilus are concerned, it will be long before 
 the Pierian spring is exhausted. 

The seven decades which have elapsed since Nautilus was assigned its definite 
 position in the natural system fall into two very distinct periods, the first of which 
 was inaugurated by Sir Richard Owen 1 in 1832, followed by Valenciennes 2 in 1841, 
 and terminated by Keferstein 3 in 1865. The second period, which is now in course,
