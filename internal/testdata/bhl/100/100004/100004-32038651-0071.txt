HISTORICAL SURVEY. 737 

was opened by the works of Professors von Jhering 1 (1877 — 1881), and Lankester and 
 Bourne 2 (1883). 

It is a point of literary interest to note that there is some evidence, which was 
 discussed at length by Owen in his celebrated memoir, tending to show that the 
 mollusc which inhabits the shell of the Pearly Nautilus was known to the father of 
 natural history. However this may be, it is certain that since the revival of learning, 
 Nautilus has on two occasions, separated from one another by an interval of a hundred 
 and twenty years, been the subject of an important zoological discovery. The first of 
 these was made by a Dutch physician and botanist, resident in the East Indies, named 
 George Everard Rumph, usually known as Rumphius, the author of a large work 
 entitled D 'Amboinsche Rariteitkamer, which was published in folio in Amsterdam in 
 1705, and was translated into German sixty years later. In this volume appeared the 
 first recognisable description and illustration of Nautilus pompilius, this fact constituting, 
 I believe, one of his principal titles to enduring distinction as a zoologist. 

Rumphius described some of the external characters of Nautilus with considerable 
 accuracy, recognising it as a Cephalopod Mollusc allied to the calamaries, cuttle-fishes 
 and octopuses, but his statements lacked confirmation and amplification and consequently 
 had no marked effect on classification. Cuvier [Regne Animal, in. p. 366, quoted by 
 Owen] dismissed his figure of Nautilus with the epithet " indechiffrable," but Keferstein 
 [Nachr. Ges. Gottingen, 1865, p. 356] was more generous, saying, "Oken allein scheint 
 mir diese recht gute Beschreibung und Abbildung angemessen gedeutet zu haben." 

The works of Rumphius 3 , overshadowed by those of Linnaeus, became practically 
 forgotten, and so it happened that the capture of a unique specimen in the year 1829 
 by Dr George Bennett off the island of Erromanga in the New Hebrides, followed 
 by its successful transmission to Europe, had all the merit of an original discovery 4 . 
 In his book entitled Gatherings of a Naturalist in Australasia, Bennett tells us that 
 his attention had been directed to the subject of Nautilus and its relation to Ammonites 
 and Belemnites after a chance conversation with Professor Owen. 

In the evening of August 24th, 1829, while at anchor in Dillon Bay, Erromanga, 
 he " observed an object floating upon the water, resembling a dead tortoiseshell cat. 
 So unexpected a sight," he says, "excited my curiosity, and the boat... was immediately... 
 sent to ascertain the nature of this floating object. It was found to be the Pearly 

Nautilus On being brought on board, I observed it retract the tentacles or feelers 

still closer than before; and this, with a slight quivering of the body, was the only 
 sign of vitality it gave." This specimen was therefore clearly in a moribund condition
