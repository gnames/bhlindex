and is described as the everlasting spirit ; another is " Pepe tuna " or the true spirit 
 of the " pepe " ; and there are others. After a certain lapse of time the " pepe " votaries 
 gather together in a special "pepe "-house to recount their visions, and then decorate 
 themselves according to their respective inspirations. Revelations concerning future 
 events, such as dances, - are held in abeyance until the appointed time. 

While holding communion with the spirits which dwell in trees, when a man, 
 under the influence of "pepe," "exempt from public haunt, finds tongues in trees," 
 he does not associate with his friends, but keeps in retirement until finally the maker 
 of the "pepe" gives a great feast for the men, towards the expenses of which each 
 guest contributes a yard of diwara, and the spell is broken. 

I took my "pepe" in a secluded spot in the cocoa-nut plantation behind Ralum, 
 but it was unconvincing, as they were afraid to give me too much "pepe," and I failed 
 to seek subsequent inspiration under the proper trees. Nevertheless the ceremony of 
 the " pepe " undoubtedly presents many features which are both quaint and picturesque. 

I was expected to contribute to the repast a native dish called " a ku," which 
 my boys prepared. This consists of the juice squeezed out from the white kernel of 
 the cocoa-nut, which is boiled in banana leaves by placing heated stones in it. Under 
 this treatment the milky juice becomes as thick as porridge, leaving a watery residue 
 which is drained off. The creamy decoction was then tied up in the leaves and carried 
 to the rendezvous, accompanied by a fish of moderate size, which had also been cooked 
 and wrapped in leaves. The " pepe " was tastefully arranged on the ground in a circle, 
 placed upon leaves with the margins artificially coloured red, and, outside these, wreaths 
 of similar leaves, and also variegated leaves of Dracaena, Groton, and other ornamental 
 plants cultivated expressly for such occasions by the natives. The whole was protected 
 by a fane of palm-leaves. After I had paid my initiation fee of two fathoms of diwara 
 the palm-leaves were removed, the pepe exposed and handed round. When taken, the 
 leaf with its red-coloured margin is wrapped round the mixture of bark-scrapings and 
 nuts, and the entire bolus is then swallowed, a taste of ginger predominating. They 
 had prepared some six or eight leaves, which were distributed among as many persons 
 including myself, but they said that the whole quantity prepared should have been 
 eaten by one recipient, in order that its effects might be appreciated. The painted 
 leaves used at the "pepe" and on other occasions are carefully hidden away afterwards 
 so that they may not be looked upon by the women. 

Shortly after the experience in practical folk-lore which I have described, namely 
 on April 17th, 1895, Mr Parkinson invited me to accompany him to a place some 
 miles distant in the bush behind Ralum, where a great dance or " malagene," called 
 the " maravot," was going to be held. It had been convoked by an aged chief of 
 wealth and fame, named To-ragat, the richest and most renowned personage of all the 
 country round Ralum. 

The " maravot " is an elaborately concerted festival designed for the purpose of 
 initiating the young men into the tribal usages, and touches the very heart of the 
 native society of the Gazelle Peninsula. It is not held annually, but at long intervals, 
 and like all such tribal assemblages of people who do not possess written records to 
 give authority to their precedents, its scope will become narrowed and it will sooner
