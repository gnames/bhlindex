706 THE MYSTERY OF THE PEPE. 

I desire to take this opportunity of qualifying my former statements concerning 
 the structure of the endodenn in post-natal and in prae-natal (i.e. immediately prior 
 to birth) stages of P. novae-britanniae (Part I. Zool. Results, pp. 29 and 30). This 
 seemed to afford ground for comparison with certain histolytic phenomena which have 
 been observed to take place in the intestine of insects and some other animals. In 
 his recent detailed description of the Malayan genus Eoperipatus (published in the 
 Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science (1901), Vols. 44 and 45), Mr Richard Evans 
 finds no confirmation of the observations which I recorded, and gives reasons for 
 supposing that the appearances were the result of the method of preservation. After 
 renewed consideration and re-examination of my preparations I have come to the 
 conclusion that he is probably right. This qualification has no reference to the 
 " trophocytes " which I described in an earlier stage (op. cit. p. 22), to which I adhere. 

Being desirous, as occasion offered, of acquiring some personal acquaintance with 
 one or two of the native sorceries I brought my mind, in the Easter of 1895, to 
 consent to be initiated into the mystery of the " pepe." The details had been very 
 kindly arranged for me by Mrs Parkinson by negotiation with a native petty chief 
 named Taipuk. 

From information which Mrs Parkinson 1 obtained from the natives, the " pepe " is 
 somewhat vaguely described as a preparation made by native doctors to be partaken 
 of by others for the purpose of causing the spirits which dwell in certain trees to 
 enter their bodies for specific purposes. There are several trees which are frequented 
 by the spirits, notably the banyan tree, " a giau." 

The " pepe " is prepared once a year during the south-east season when it is 
 dry, because in north-west weather the spirits are driven from the trees by the rain. 
 At the right time, as ascertained by the behaviour of the tides, the man who prepares 
 the "pepe" scrapes the aromatic bark from certain trees, adds to it Areca-nut and 
 lime, and wraps the whole in the " Aier " or betel leaf, making a number of small 
 bundles which he spreads out in the less frequented parts of the bush. When the 
 " pepe " is laid out in this way, i.e., in the manner of a repast, the people who intend 
 to partake of it gather round it and the master gives each communicant a small 
 parcel. They eat their parcel and then fall down in a trance as if intoxicated, and 
 go to sleep on the spot. When they awake in the morning, they start off by twos 
 or threes to find the spirit-haunted trees, and to sleep under them until they discover 
 by the nature of their dreams a tree inhabited by a good spirit, i.e., a male spirit, 
 as the female spirits are reputed bad. The information which they desire to obtain 
 from the good spirit relates to personal ornaments, waistbands made with shells, chaplets, 
 tattoo-marks, feather-tufts for the head, scented leaves for the neck, dyes for the hah-, 
 pig's bristles for the hair, cassowary quills and opossum-teeth for the nose, painting 
 of the body and so forth. Further information is desired upon the important matter 
 of charms, chiefly of the nature of love-philtres, fern-seed and rain-making. All this 
 knowledge is imparted by the good spirits in dreams to him who has taken the "pepe." 
 The spirits have different names and different functions. One is called " Tutana Vuragit " 

1 Mrs Parkinson was kind enough to present me with a description of the " pepe " which she reduced 
 to writing for the occasion. The general account which I give in the text is largely derived from this document.
