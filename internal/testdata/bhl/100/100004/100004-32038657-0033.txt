PERIPATUS. 705 

In the four largest embryos which he extracted from the uterus, Dr Hansen 
 observed a most remarkable feature. From the articular membrane which connects the 
 head with the protergum, there issued an unpaired nuchal organ, slender at the base 
 but rapidly increasing in volume, which became lacerated during the removal of the 
 embryo. " This organ," he considered, " must be in connection with the interior wall of 
 female genital organs and thus serve the nutrition of the young ones." 

While taking out the two smallest of the embryos, which he was able to procure 
 without destroying the specimen, the head was broken off in each case, which seemed 
 to him to indicate "that also these specimens had been fixed by an organ from the 
 neck." Remarking upon the probably nutritive function of this nuchal organ, Dr Hansen 
 does not hesitate to give it as his opinion that the very anomalous mode of propagation 
 of Hemimerus is of great systematical importance 1 , and marks it as the type of a distinct 
 family allied to the Forficulina. 

To my mind the nuchal organ of Hemimerus is homologous with the corresponding- 
 trophic vesicle of Paraperipatus novae-britanniae as described by me 2 , all that is wanted 
 to complete the comparison being an account of the actual history of the organ in 
 Hemimerus in order to demonstrate its relation to the normal embryonic membranes 
 of the insect. 

The other fact which it is my fortune to bring forward in support of the suggestion 
 that the trophic vesicle here referred to is a formation of primary or phylogenetic 
 significance, is due to the recent observations of M. Bouvier of Paris 3 . In a species of 
 the South African genus Peripatopsis, namely, P. sedgwicki Purcell, M. Bouvier describes 
 a blastodermic vesicle with nuchal insertion as in Paraperipatus. The vesicle attains 
 relatively enormous dimensions, measuring as much as 5 mm. in length in the case of 
 an embryo of 3 mm. M. Bouvier is of opinion that the species in question is the 
 most primitive member of the genus Peripatopsis and that the other species of this genus, 
 as regards their development, are derived from it by atrophy of the vesicle accompanied 
 by greater simultaneity in the growth of the embryos. 

1 The expression "great systematical importance" may be interpreted in various ways, but, for my part, 
 I prefer to take it as signifying great phylogenetic importance.

3 Bouvier, E. L., " Observations sur le developpement des Onychophores," C. E. Acad. Paris, tome 131, 
 p. 652, 1900. M. Bouvier has again returned to this question (" Sur la reproduction et le developpement du 
 Peripatopsis blainvillei," op. cit., tome 133, p. 518, 1901) in connection with the Chilian species which affords 
 a transition from the Andicolous to the South African forms. He finds that the genus Peripatopsis presents 
 three modes of development: — 1. avec un oeuf tres petit et sans annexe embryonnaire (P. blainvillei); 
 2. avec un ceuf assez volumineux et [avec] vesicule nuquale (P. sedgwicki) ; 3. avec un oeuf assez volumineux 
 et sans annexe embryonnaire (tous les autres Peripatopsis). In the second category I have placed the word 
 "avec" in square brackets, because, in the original, the word "sans" is inserted by an obvious typo- 
 graphical error. 

That all these deductions cannot be accepted without discussion goes without saying, but fortunately the 
 issue is fairly clear and an important presentation of the opposite view has quite recently been contributed 
 by Professor Arthur Dendy ("On the oviparous species of Onychophora," Quart. J. Micr. Sc., Vol. 45, 1902, 
 pp. 363 — 415, Pis. 19 — 22). Dendy thinks that the oviparity of certain Australian species which lay large 
 yolk-laden eggs is primitive, and adduces in support of this contention the consideration that the chorion 
 which surrounds the intra-uterine embryo in the viviparous species of Peripatus may be regarded as a vestigial 
 structure inherited 'from oviparous ancestors in which a chorionic membrane acted as a protection to the 
 deposited egg during the early stages of development. It does not follow however that the eggs were primitively 
 overloaded with yolk, since most so-called alecithal eggs are also protected by a chorionic or vitelline membrane.
