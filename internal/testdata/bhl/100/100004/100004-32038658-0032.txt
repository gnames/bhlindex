704 PERIPATUS. 

both in its structure and habits. While abundant moisture is absolutely indispensable 
 to its existence, immersion is quickly fatal ; it is therefore likely to prove of peculiar 
 theoretical value to the zoogeographer since the only conceivable means of transit from 
 one place to another is by land. But the occurrence of distinct genera in Australasia 
 (Australia, Tasmania and New Zealand), in New Britain and in the Malay Peninsula 
 and Sumatra, renders it impossible, in the absence of information concerning the 
 rejsresentation of Peripatus on any of the intervening islands, to construct a scheme of 
 any route of migration in former geological ages, especially as we cannot be certain 
 whether the centre of distribution lay in the Eastern or the Western Hemisphere, 
 although M. Bouvier 1 is of opinion that the American Continent was the original head- 
 quarters of the Onychophoran stock. 

Until quite recently a peculiar correlation has seemed to subsist between three classes 
 of phenomena in their relation to Peripatus, namely: (1) the discontinuity of its areas of 
 distribution ; (2) the generic divergence of the different types ; (3) the method of nutrition 
 of the young in the intra-uterine development. 

It now appears certain that this correlation is neither so simple nor so fixed and 
 definite as had been supposed. If the method of embryonic nutrition, for example, were 
 strictly correlated with the generic divergencies, the selection of any particular method as 
 bearing a more primitive or ancestral stamp than the rest, might well appear arbitrary, 
 since the generic divergence may be taken to depend partly upon the discontinuity of 
 distribution. 

When I first became acquainted with the blastodermic or trophic vesicle of the 
 embryos of the New Britain species {Paraperipatus novae-britanniae) I was completely at 
 a loss to offer any provisional explanation of it based upon morphological principles, but 
 in the course of time I evolved a working hypothesis, an account of which was published". 

Through the kindness of Professor G. B. Howes, F.R.S., I have recently come to the 
 knowledge of an interesting memoir by Dr H. J. Hansen of Copenhagen, on the structure 
 and development of a primitive insect named Hemimerus talpoides, belonging to the order 
 Orthoptera 3 . This insect has been found living in the fur of a West African rat of the 
 genus Cricetomys; it resembles a wingless cockroach in superficial appearance but is more 
 nearly related to the Forficulina than to the Blattina, as is indicated especially by 
 the arrangement of the mouth-parts. The chief peculiarity of Hemimerus lies in its 
 anomalous method of propagation which isolates it from all known insects. It is truly 
 viviparous (not merely ovoviviparous) and in one female Dr Hansen found six embryos 
 at different stages of development, the largest of which, in its convoluted state, measured 
 2"8 mm. in length and the smallest 1"2 mm. 4 

Dr Hansen points out that it is thus evident that Hemimerus gives birth to its 
 young singly and in succession, not simultaneously; moreover the newly born young only 
 differs from the adult in the less number of joints of the antennae and in lacking 
 the sexual modification of the posterior abdominal segments.
