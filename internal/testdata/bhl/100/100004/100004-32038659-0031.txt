PEEIPATUS IN NEW BEITAIN. 703 

called "a tita" (Parinarium laurinum) which has a wide distribution and is even called 
 by the same native name in the Solomon Islands, where it is employed for the same 
 purpose and also as cement for the remarkable inlaid work which the Solomon Islanders 
 practise in the decoration of their canoes, paddles and weapons. 

The kernel of the nut is removed and rubbed against a stone to produce a pulp. 
 According to native directions " u na ud ia ta ra wat," which means, word for word, 
 â€¢' you must rub it on the stone," the particle " na " implying both obligation and futurity. 
 A quantity of dust or ashes is mixed with the pulp to form a paste which is then 
 employed like putty in filling up the crevices of the canoe. The composition soon turns 
 brown and dries hard, after which it is plastered over with lime obtained from calcined 
 corals and mixed with the expressed juice of the cocoa-nut. 

The natives are cynophagists and I was told that they rub the bruised fruit 
 of the Barringtonia speciosa called " a vutun " on the closed eyes of recently born 
 pups, to cause them to open, but I did not actually see this veterinary feat performed. 

I stayed at Karavia, renting about half a bungalow belonging to Ah Tarn of 
 Matupi, from March 1 to July 12 (1895). During this time hardly a day passed 
 without some experiments, operations or observations relating to Nautilus being carried on. 
 If I made an excursion into the bush behind Karavia to shoot a pigeon for lunch 
 or for change of occupation, either a cage, barrel, basket or hempen tangle would be 
 testing its quality in the silent depths of the bay. 

It was during one of these excursions, on the occasion of my second visit to 
 New Britain, that I had the good fortune to come across a species of Peripatus. 
 At the outset of my journey I had calculated upon the possibility of discovering the 
 Peripatus of New Britain, but it was not until near the close of my voyages, in the 
 year 1897, that my dream was realised. 

It is well known that Peripatus occupies an isolated position in the animal kingdom, 
 presenting signs of affinity both to the Annelid Worms and to the Tracheate Arthropods 
 but not falling into the sequence of normal gradation of forms. When seen from above, 
 immediately after turning over a stone or a fallen leaf or a piece of rotten bark, it 
 resembles a caterpillar; if looked at from below it is like a centipede with many pairs 
 of clawed legs, and when held in the hand or between the fingers it is found to be 
 soft like a caterpillar or a worm. 

From a zoogeographical point of view, Peripatus possesses a perennial interest which 
 does not diminish as time goes on, although the recent discovery of a new genus, with 
 three new species, in the Malay Peninsula during the Skeat Expedition to this region, 
 renders generalisation for the present impossible. We may confidently await further 
 additions to our knowledge of the distribution of the Onychophora for many years to 
 come, according as the various islands of the Eastern Archipelago are searched for their 
 cryptozoic inhabitants. For example it may seem difficult to believe that Peripatus has 
 been overlooked in Java which has been visited by so many naturalists of the highest 
 distinction, but it is equally incredible that it does not occur there. It is to be looked 
 for under leaves, bark and stones in damp mountain valleys near streams or springs, and 
 its absence from the neighbourhood of one source does not preclude the possibility of its 
 occurrence near another half-a-mile distant. It is essentially a creature of contradictions
