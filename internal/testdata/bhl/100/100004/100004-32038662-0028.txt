702 THE WEARING OF THE KABIL. 

with palms and Cycads in the foreground. They use long, light, narrow rafts made with 
 the midribs of sago-palm leaves lashed together and propelled with simple bamboo rods. 
 When a crowd of natives came to the beach the women kept together in a separate 
 group, and when a young fellow accepted the recruiting terms and was taken away in the 
 boat the poor women often raised a terrible wail, shrieking, stamping and rubbing sand 
 over their bodies. But from previous experiences I felt that such grief would be soon 
 assuaged, heart-rending though it appeared. 

The wearing of the "kabil" is an act of deference to the men. In one village called 
 Neila-as, on the island of Kung, there was a tree near the chiefs house, upon which 
 several skulls were exposed, with huge rents behind the ear. There can be no doubt 
 that in this country infringements of the social code are visited with swift retribution. 

At Neila-as we wanted to photograph a group of the women with their kabils, 
 and in order to place them in a favourable light it was necessary for them to cross 
 the village-square. I was much interested to observe that they crossed this space on 
 their knees in view of a group of men who were watching them. 

Birds are " tambu " or sacred in New Hanover and each individual native acknow- 
 ledges a certain kind of bird as his patron-bird and the people range themselves 
 accordingly into groups or phratries, named after the birds. The esteem in which birds 
 are held is further manifested in their carvings, particularly in the figure-heads of 
 their canoes which are carved out of the same piece of wood from which the dug-out 
 itself is made ; the head and eyes are usually distinct but the rest of the body is 
 drawn out into a fantastic scroll and in fact the whole figure of the bird may 
 degenerate into a decorative scroll. Another kind of carvings representing birds is called 
 "kui." This is used in dances and is provided with a spatula-shaped basal piece by 
 which it is held in the mouth ; the eyes are the blue opercula of Turbo petholatus. 

Seismic disturbances are of frequent occurrence in New Britain and when they 
 occur at night the bush re-echoes with the blowing of conchs and the tattoo of 
 " garamats " or native tomtoms, to soothe the angry spirit. If there were any houses 
 built of stone the earthquakes would no doubt frequently be classed as disasters, but 
 under present conditions only minor casualties occur such as the upsetting of lamps and 
 other household implements. 

In the Strait of Rakaiya between Vulcan Island and the mainland, both men and 
 women used to come down to scoop up the black sand or mud near the shore with 
 small hand-nets in search of the " diwara " shell which occurs here in small quantities but 
 is said to be of inferior quality 1 , and varies in colour from almost pure white to jet-black. 
 The natives sift the sand through their nets and each shell, as they find it, is carefully 
 stored away in their mouths until their jowls are full. 

Finding it necessary to have some lighter craft than a whale-boat for general 
 purposes, and not being able at that time, for reasons stated above, to purchase a New 
 Britain canoe, I commissioned a Samoan mission-teacher to make me a canoe in Samoan 
 fashion during his spare time. In this plain unadorned dug-out I was able to traverse 
 the whole extent of Blanche Bay with a single companion. When it sprung a leak, as 
 all canoes do sooner or later, the holes were stopped up with the bruised fruit of a tree 

1 The principal source of the shell lies far away on the north coast in the district of Beining.
