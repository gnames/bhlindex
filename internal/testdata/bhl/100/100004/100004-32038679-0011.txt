As I have already explained in the prefatory note which accompanied the first 
 Part of these Zoological Results, my journey to the Eastern Archipelago was promoted 
 by the Managers of the Balfour Studentship in the University of Cambridge, with the 
 avowed object of procuring material for the study of the embryonic development of the 
 pearly Nautilus. It is well known that this molluscan type occupies a comparatively 
 isolated position in the series of existing animal forms, and that it is a surviving relic 
 of an order which was dominant in former geological epochs. It is in fact one of the 
 best examples of what have been called persistent types or, by way of paradox, living 
 fossils, that is to say, relict types of pre-tertiary creation. 

It has been an object of serious investigation on the part of many of the foremost 
 zoologists of England, France, Germany and Holland during the nineteenth century, and 
 it was even one of Cuvier's regrets that he had never seen the inhabitant of the 
 chambered shell which had been, from time immemorial, an ornament of the conchologist's 
 cabinet. 

Of course the chance of acquiring a complete set of developmental stages of such 
 a type as this, from the moment of deposition of the eggs, through the period of 
 incubation, culminating finally in the hatching of the miniature organism, would be 
 enough to whet the enthusiasm and claim the devotion of any zoologist. The dis- 
 tinguished German naturalist, Dr Richard Semon, whose journey to Australia, "the land 
 of living fossils," has resulted not only in the publication of an imposing array of 
 technical monographs, but also in the composition of a delightfully instructive book, 
 spent some time at Amboyna, and tells us that a principal aim of his stay on the 
 Moluccas was the study of Nautilus's development 1 . Elated by his successes in Australia, 
 Semon began to imagine himself "the happy possessor of a perfect series of developing 
 Nautilus pompilius." In this, however, he was disappointed, and it will be seen that 
 my efforts were only crowned by partial success, an eventuality for which I had 
 prepared my mind beforehand.
