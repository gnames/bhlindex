740 SEXUAL DIMORPHISM. 

funnel may be faintly detected projecting beyond the anterior lip of the shell. The 
 posterior surface of the hood is concave, in accurate correspondence with the involute 
 convexity (anfractus) of the keel of the shell, and in the concavity there is a semilunar 
 fold which fits upon the blackened involute portion of the shell, towards which it acts as 
 a lubricant. This fold is the nuchal membrane which was compared by Keferstein (1865), 
 and Lankester (1883, Encyc. Brit.) with the cartilaginous nuchal plate of Sepia. I shall 
 have occasion to return to it later. In the specimen which I photographed, the slender 
 tentacles were mostly in a condition of protraction, and when, as in this instance, the 
 animal is stationary although expanded, they are seen to hang down listlessly, but when 
 swimming vigorously backwards are held out straight 1 , like the arms of Octopus under 
 the same circumstances.

In Nautilus the sexes are separate, as in all other Cephalopoda, and this dioecism 
 is accompanied by a sexual dimorphism which is determined by the nature of the 
 accessory organs of reproduction and is manifested in the dimensions of the mouth of 
 the shell. 

With regard to the statistical relations of the sexes I found that, judging from the 
 ■specimens taken in the traps, the number of males exceeds that of the females in the 
 case of N. pompilius, while for N. macromphalus the reverse was true. The excess of 
 females, or hyperpolygyny, is a common phenomenon among Cephalopoda, and it is 
 a curious fact that there should be an apparent difference in this respect between these 
 two species of Nautilus. The figures relating to the former species which I have 
 recorded are perhaps more convincing than those which concern the latter. Out of 216 
 specimens of N. pompilius, 150 were male and 66 female. Of 26 N. macromphalus, 

1 This is well shown in some of Dr Dean's figures to which I have already referred.
