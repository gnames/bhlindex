In contrast with the race of the Argonauts or Paper Nautili where the male is 
 strikingly smaller than the female, which alone carries a shell of peculiar construction, 
 the males of the Pearly Nautilus are rather larger than the females. This predominance 
 of the male is due to its possession of a remarkable organ, the spadix, placed beside 
 the mouth within the outer whorl of tentacles and formed, as first described by the 
 Dutch anatomist Van der Hoeven, by the combination of four modified tentacles belonging 
 to the inner whorl (see below). The presence of the bulky spadix in the midst of the 
 cephalic complex which, in the retracted condition, is concealed below the hood, determines 
 an increase in the dimensions of the latter, which must obviously find expression in the 
 size of the orifice of the shell.
