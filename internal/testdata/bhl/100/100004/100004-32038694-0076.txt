SEXUAL DIMORPHISM. 

The sexual dimorphism is more pronounced in Nautilus than in any other recent 
 Cephalopod, with the exception of Argonauta, owing to the fact that the spadix is

•a permanent structure, having a gradual development from the adolescent to the adult 
 stages. It is not periodic in its appearance as is the hectocotylus of the Dibranchs. 
 That its presence should determine a difference in the shape and dimensions of the 
 orifice of the shell, is a fact which has already been made use of by palaeontologists, 
 who now recognise similar sexual variations in the shells of extinct species. Commenting 
 upon my observations and figures (published in 1895) relating to the shells of male and 
 female Nautilus, Professor Howes 1 pointed out that these and the nearly contemporaneous 
 observations of M. Vayssiere bore out the suggestion made by D'Orbigny more than fifty 
 years ago that certain differences in the shells of Ammonites might possibly be indicative 
 of sexual variation.
