SPECIES AND RANGE. 743 

The sexual dimorphism manifested by the shells of recent Nautilus has also been 
 observed among the much more numerous species which occur in the fossil state. For 
 example, it is shown in a striking manner in the figures of Nautilus bradfordensis Crick, 
 contained in an article by Mr G. C. Crick 1 , where he described and figured the shells of 
 eleven species of Nautilus taken from various zones in the Inferior Oolite of Dorsetshire, 
 of which no fewer than ten were registered as new to science.

Hitherto it has only been found really practicable to differentiate the recent species 
 of Nautilus according to the character of the shell in the umbilical region, and from 
 this point of view four well-marked forms have been distinguished, namely, N. pompilius 
 Linn., with umbilicus concealed by a deposit of callus in the adult, N. stenomphalus
