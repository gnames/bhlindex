Sowerby, with narrow perforate umbilicus, N. macromphalus Sowerby, with rather wide 
 subperforate ] umbilicus, N. umbilicatits Lister, with very wide perforate umbilicus. 

Judging from the known facts relative to the coiling of the shells of extinct 
 Ammonoids and Nautiloids and also from the fact that the young shells of N. pompilius 
 are perforate, the umbilical region becoming subsequently covered over by callus, I suppose 
 it is natural to conclude that the form of the shell in N. umbilicatits is the most primitive 
 among recent species, while that of N~. -pompilius is the most highly adapted. 

If inquiry be made into the nature of the adaptation which has resulted in the 
 complete closure of the umbilicus in the latter species, it will be found as a fact that 
 an exposed deeply excavated itmbilical region, such as is presented by the shells of 
 N. macromphalus and N. umbilicatus, is liable to be selected as a nidus for the attachment 
 of all kinds of sedentary animals, Serpulids, Cirripedes, Ostreids, Bryozoa, Foraminifera, 
 and others. 

The fouling of the shell resulting from the incrustations of these foreign bodies will 
 not only serve to irritate the sensitive edge of the mantle in their vicinity, but will 
 also materially hamper the swimming of the Nautilus. (PL LXXIX. fig. 1.) 

The deposition of callus over the umbilicus in N. pompilius effectually repels the 
 visits of unbidden guests. In view of these considerations it is interesting to note that 
 it is precisely in the umbilical region that the shell of N, pompilius exhibits marked 
 variations, to which I have called attention (1896), and I came to the conclusion that 
 N. stenomphalus was simply an extreme variety of this species. Shells which are assigned 
 to N. stenomphalus also vary in the diameter of the umbilicus, and I named a form 
 of which I obtained one specimen of the shell only, through the kindness of the 
 Hon. M. H. Moreton, at Samarai, N. pompilius, var. Moretoni, but I have since been shown 
 a specimen in the Manchester Museum by Mr W. E. Hoyle which is identical with mine. 

In 1855 Macdonald described the anatomy of a species from New Caledonia, which 
 he erroneously called N. umbilicatus, subsequently recognising his mistake, and correcting 
 the name to that of N. macromphalus* . Maedonald's investigation of the anatomy of 
 N. macromphalus resulted, as is well known, in the discovery of the otocysts, but revealed 
 no appreciable specific differences between it and N. pompilius so far as the soft parts 
 are concerned. In fact the animals of these two species are really indistinguishable, and 
 I was therefore very pleased to come into the possession of a single mutilated specimen 
 of N. umbilicatus accompanied by its shell, which had been picked up from the surface 
 of the sea, not far from Milne Bay in British New Guinea, and to find that this species 
 differed noticeably from its congeners by the character of the hood, the gibbosities of 
 which have the form of flat-topped angular areas separated by deep grooves, producing 
 a pronounced tessellated appearance. (PI. LXXVIII. fig. 3.) 

In comparison with its former world-wide distribution, evidenced for example by the 
 abundance of its remains in the London Clay, the present restricted range of the genus 

1 If the shell is coiled in such a manner that a space is left between the first chamber and the first 
 turn of the spiral so that light may be seen through the pin-hole aperture, the umbilicus is said to be 
 perforated. In the shell of N. macromphalus there is a pit on each side but it does not extend through 
 from -one side to the other.
