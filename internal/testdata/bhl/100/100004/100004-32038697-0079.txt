SPECIES AND RANGE. 745 

Nautilus, shown in the map at the end of this article, appears to have a special interest 
 It is wholly confined to the seas adjoining the islands of the Eastern Archipelago, 
 including in the latter term the East Indies, Philippines, New Guinea and its dependencies, 
 Solomon Islands, New Caledonia, New Hebrides, and Fiji. Its shells have been picked 
 up on the Nicobar Islands, Japan [Dean] and the coast of New South Wales, drifting 
 to these localities which lie outside the range of the living animal. 

It is curious that so far as is known with any certainty it does not occur west of 
 the Strait of Malacca nor east of Fiji. Although it descends to deep water, the single 
 specimen obtained during the Challenger Expedition having been dredged in 320 fathoms 1 , 
 it is not an abyssal form, but rather seems to affect the vicinity of large islands, which 
 perhaps in former ages were united to still larger continental masses. Mr Charles Hedley, 
 who has developed a remarkable theory of a Melanesian plateau, which amongst other 
 connections united New Caledonia to New Zealand (as indicated primarily by the 
 distribution of land-molluscs), in a recent paper says, " It is remarkable how strictly 
 Nautilus observes as its eastern limit the ancient coast line of the Melanesian plateau 2 ." 

If the generic distribution is interesting, the local range of one of the three recent 
 species, namely N. macromphalus, is still more strange. Although as noted above there is 
 no apparent difference between the animals which construct the shells of N. pompilius and 
 N. macromphalus respectively, yet these species are quite distinct, as is shown not only 
 by the coiling of the shell, which is quite constant in the latter, but also by their 
 geographical distribution. N pompilius is never taken in the New Caledonian Group 
 [New Caledonia, Isle of Pines, Loyalty Islands], and N. macromphalus is never taken 
 anywhere else. The species which occurs among the New Hebrides and Fiji Islands 
 is N. pompilius. When we consider the individual abundance of Nautilus wherever 
 a favourable locality is known, the circumscribed limits of the area frequented by 
 N. macromphalus alone are very puzzling. On the other hand so far as we can judge 
 from the scanty data which are available, the area of distribution of N. umbilicatus overlaps 
 that of N. pompilius, and therefore this factor does not contribute to the differentiation of 
 the species, but in this case the animals are quite distinct, N. umbilicatus, as I have 
 already mentioned, presenting a characteristic areolation of the upper surface of the hood, 
 resembling the pallial investment of Lepidoteuthis grimaldii described by M. Joubin 5 . 
 The same description applies to both sets of cutaneous structures, rhombohedral scales 
 of cartilaginous consistency and fibrous texture. Of course they have been independently 
 acquired, since they occur in different regions of the body, on the cephalopodium in 
 N. umbilicatus, on the mantle in Lepidoteuthis. 

It follows from what has preceded that the recent species which has the widest 
 known range is N. pompilius, since it occurs in the Philippines, Moluccas, Bismarck 
 Archipelago, Torres Strait, New Hebrides, and Fiji. The other species which can be obtained 
 in abundance is confined to the New Caledonian Archipelago, namely, N. macromphalus. 
 Finally, the third species N. umbilicatus occurs also in Papuan waters, but the animal
