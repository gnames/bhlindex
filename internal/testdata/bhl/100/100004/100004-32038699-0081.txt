Upon taking a shell, of which the animal had died and fallen out, from a basket 
 at Lifu, something rattled like a stone in the shell. It turned out to be a handsome 
 pearl of large size, but of doubtful value as a gem, since the shape is not quite regular, 
 flattened on one side, and the surface is not absolutely pure. It measures about 
 15 millimetres in major diameter, 11 mm. in height, weighs 3690 milligrammes and is, 
 I believe, the first nautiline pearl to be recorded. 

The shape of the shell, a circinate spiral, belongs to one of those fundamental 
 forms which recur both primarily and secondarily under various guises in both kingdoms 
 of the organised creation. This form is calculated, for example, to meet the require- 
 ments of economy of space combined with strength and symmetry of construction, and 
 has therefore a physiological meaning. It is certainly remarkable to find a mollusc 
 provided with an external shell as large as that of Nautilus, which is at the same time 
 an expert and rapid swimmer. This faculty of swimming as the principal, practically 
 the sole means of locomotion, depends of course more upon the buoyancy of the shell 
 than upon its shape, but the latter should not be disregarded in this connection. 

The buoyancy of the shell is due to the series of air-chambers which have 
 long excited the admiration of poets and philosophers. Successive chambers are added 
 by the secretion of fresh septa pari passu with the growth of the animal. If the shell, 
 with the live Nautilus in it, be perforated over the chambers under water, the air 
 bubbles gently out as the water enters. I regret that I omitted to collect any of this 
 air, but Vrolik (1843) ascertained that it contained more nitrogen than atmospheric air, 
 a fact which is not surprising if we consider that the animal could better afford to 
 part with nitrogen than with oxygen. Nautilus seems to have a peculiar faculty of 
 producing gas 1 , and my knowledge of the pallial veins was chiefly due to their automatic 
 injection with gas after removal of the animal from the shell. 

The chambers are not individually air-tight since they are perforated by the 
 siphuncle, but collectively they are rendered an air-tight and water-tight hydrostatic 
 apparatus, owing to the fact that the animal itself completely closes up the entrance 
 to the chambers in virtue of its adherence to the shell by the muscles and annulus 
 (girdle of Owen). Any loss by diffusion might be made good by the siphuncle, but 
 apart from this I see no reason to imagine that the air which fills the chambers 
 undergoes any appreciable fluctuations of pressure. It is, I am convinced, an error 
 to suppose that variations of pressure of the air in the chambers enable Nautilus to 
 rise or sink as the case may be. The air simply renders the shell buoyant once 
 for all. 

The progressive growth of the animal is accompanied by the addition of new 
 chambers, which give increased buoyancy and so maintain the shell under the entire 
 control of the animal until a limit is reached when the last air-chamber has been 
 divided off, and then only does propagation commence. 

1 Professor Lankester (Article " Mollusca," Encyc. Brit., Vol. xvi. 9th edit.) says: â€” "In connexion with the 
 secretion of gas by the animal, besides the parallel cases ranging from the Protozoon Arcella to the Physoclistic 
 Fishes, from the Hydroid Siphonophora to the insect-larva Corethra, we have the identical phenomenon observed 
 in the closely-allied Sepia when recently hatched."
