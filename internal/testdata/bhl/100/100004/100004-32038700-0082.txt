748 MANTLE ; SHELL ] NUCHAL MEMBRANE. 

There are several features in the shell which indicate that it has reached its limit 
 of growth and that its inhabitant is therefore mature. The lip of the shell which has 
 hitherto been thin and fragile gradually becomes thickened, and a black border is 
 ultimately formed round it on the inside in continuity, at the umbilicus, with the 
 coating of black varnish which covers the involute convexity or anfractus of the shell 
 from the earliest stages. The septa, as seen in sections through the shell, become 
 progressively thicker from the earliest to the latest, so that the last septum which 
 precedes sexual maturity is, when completed, the thickest of all 1 . Another striking 
 character which indicates the termination of the chamber-building activity of Nautilus 
 is found in the fact that the last air-chamber of the finished shell is generally smaller 
 than the one which preceded it, due no doubt to advancing age, but one of my bisected 
 shells of N. macromphalus provides an apparent exception to this rule in that, though 
 the black edge has been added to the lip of the shell, the final chamber is not smaller 
 than the penultimate. It was formerly supposed that the most recent chamber was always, 
 at its first formation, smaller than its jDredecessor, even in young growing shells, and 
 this assumption was used as an argument in support of a theory of shell-growth by 
 intussusception [Riefstahl], but it is not so, and the error has been duly corrected 2 . 

The total number of chambers constructed seems to vary considerabl)-. Three shells 
 of N. pompilius have 36, 34, and 33 chambers respectively, two of N. macromphalus have 
 28 and 27, one of N. umbilicatus 32. 

Although the umbilicus of N. pompilius is closed externally by a deposit of callus 
 it is well known that a section through the shell reveals the presence of an umbilical 
 fossa in consequence of which the initial chamber of the shell has a free outer surface. 
 In the middle of this surface when isolated by chipping away the rest of the shell 
 there is a sub-rotund area with a slightly raised oval boss in the centre of it, and in 
 the middle of the boss a shallow elongate depression, the whole somewhat resembling 
 the structures known in plants as bordered pits. This is called after its dis- 
 coverer as Hyatt's scar 5 and is the principal feature of the shell, concerning the nature 
 of which and its relation to a possible protoconch we might expect to acquire special 
 information from a study of the embryonic stages of development 4 . 

At the median dorsal border of the earlier septa, from the third to the twenty- 
 second or thereabouts, there is a deep pit which occasions a prominent lobe to project 
 backwards into the preceding chamber from each septum. This dorsal lobe of the 
 septum was observed by Valenciennes and later writers, and an excellent illustration has 
 been furnished more recently by Dr Appellof 5 .
