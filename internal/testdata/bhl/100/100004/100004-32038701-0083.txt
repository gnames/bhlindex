MANTLE ; SHELL ; NUCHAL MEMBRANE. 749 

The line of insertion of each septum into the wall of the shell is known as the 
 septal suture and follows a broadly sinuous course, well indicated for example in a 
 skiagraph made by Messrs J. Green and J. H. Gardiner and commented upon by Mr B. B. 
 Woodward 1 . (Cf. PI. LXXVII. fig. 1.) 

In precise correspondence with the septal suture which bounds the fundus of the 
 animal chamber (Wohnkammer) there is an aponeurotic band round the visceral portion of 
 the mantle forming the boundary of the pallial area which secretes the septa (PL LXXV.). 
 I figured this band in 1896, referring to it as the septal contour 2 , and it has since 
 been further illustrated by Mr L. E. Griffin 3 who speaks of it as the " posterior ventral 
 aponeurotic band," having overlooked my previous account 4 . Recently, however, I have 
 met with a still earlier description of this septal aponeurosis in the work of Appellof 
 (1893), though without illustration. Having referred to the annulus or horny girdle of 
 Owen by which the visceral sac adheres to the shell all round its circumference between 
 and including the shell-muscles, Appellof {op. cit. p. 75) goes on to say : — " Hinter 
 diesen [i.e. the annulus] und sehr deutlich markirt erstreckt sich rings um den Mantel 
 eine zweite Linie, welche der Septalsutur anliegt. Dieselbe tritt durch ihre weissliche 
 Farbe scharf hervor und scheint eine Verdickung im Mantel zu bilden." 

The preceding remarks lead to the consideration of the method of formation of the 
 septa. This is simple enough so far as the septum itself is concerned. What is not 
 so easy to understand is the manner in which the animal glides bodily forwards in its 
 shell so as to leave a space behind it which is destined to become the new air-chamber. 

The foundation of a new septum consists of a very thin, easily torn membrane, 
 presumably conchyolin, which appears as a cuticle over the entire septal area of the 
 mantle, i.e. the area limited by the septal aponeurosis. Upon this membrane nacreous 
 matter is deposited commencing from the septal suture, and the membrane itself remains 
 as a thin pellicle over the hinder surface of the septum. This pellicle appears to better 
 advantage in some specimens than in others. It is a striking circumstance, upon removing 
 a young Nautilus from its shell, to find that the septum which constitutes the fundus 
 of the animal chamber is composed of soft membrane only without any trace of nacreous 
 substance. When a calcified septum is substituted for the primary membranous septum 
 by the deposition of nacre, it is at first exceedingly thin and fragile, becoming gradually 
 thickened by further secretion, but the size of the air-chamber is determined from the 
 commencement of calcification and undergoes no subsequent change. 

If the horny membrane which covers over the muscular impressions in the shell 
 be removed, it will be found that each muscle-scar consists of a series of close-set 
 concentric lines exactly like the growth-lines of the shell, not however continuous with 
 the latter but quite independent, superposed upon the growth-lines of the shell, and 
 traversing them at an angle. These superadded lines may be called the growth-lines
