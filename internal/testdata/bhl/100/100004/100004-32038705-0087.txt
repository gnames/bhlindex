VENTRAL PALLIAL COMPLEX. 753 

form but adherent to the posterior declivous surface of the hood and only free at its 
 circumference. This plate is of an aponeurotic texture and a white colour: at both 
 sides it is united to the dorsal fold [italics mine] and below it seems to have an 
 intimate connection with the two side parts of the funnel, and indeed to be a con- 
 tinuation of those parts." The new fact signalised by Van der Hoeven is the relation 
 of the nuchal membrane to the aloe infundibuli into which alone it passes behind and 
 below (PI. LXXVIL fig. 4). 

The umbilical portion of the pallial border is the angle which unites the dorsal 
 and ventro-lateral folds together, and in N. pompilius secretes the callus which conceals 
 the true umbilicus of the shell. 

6. Ventral Pallial Complex. 

In order to render my description of the pallial topography relatively complete it 
 is desirable to devote a special section to an enumeration of the organs which are 
 contained in the spacious mantle-cavity 1 produced by the deep ventro-lateral fold of the 
 mantle. The insertion of this fold into the body-wall is not so easily understood as in 
 the case of the dorsal fold as it involves some of the organs, notably the branchiae, 
 osphradia, anus and renal organs, which in other Cephalopods form part of the body 
 proper and are not carried up into and upon the mantle itself. 

The various organs, lines and regions which compose the ventral pallial complex 
 are mapped out in the coloured figure on Plate LXXV. which shows their exact normal 
 positions in the fresh condition as seen upon and through the thin pallial wall. Such 
 a figure as that referred to is serviceable from the point of view of topographical 
 anatomy on account of the degree of transparency possessed by the living mantle as 
 compared with its opacity in preserved specimens. 

The mantle commences as a free fold behind the renal sacs, so that these structures 
 actually penetrate into the substance of the mantle, and their apertures as well as the 
 viscero-pericardial apertures open upon the inner surface of the mantle. The pallial 
 insertion of the above-named organs and also of the nidamental gland in the female, 
 by all of which Nautilus differs from the Dibranchs, has doubtless been noted by 
 anatomists who have dissected this animal, and has further received special attention from 
 Dr L. E. Griffin 2 , who points out that "there is in the Nautilus pompilius the same 
 arrangement of the parts of the pallial complex as in many Gasteropoda." It may be 
 noted here that the particular Gasteropoda to which Nautilus, in common with other 
 Cephalopoda, is specially comparable, are the Zygobranchiate Prosobranchiata which 
 include Haliotis and Pleurotomaria 3 .
