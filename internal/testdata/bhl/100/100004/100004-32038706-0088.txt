754 SIPHUNCLE AND PALLIAL VESSELS. 

In comparing Nautilus with the dibranchiate Cephalopods Professor Lankester (1883, 
 Encyc. Brit.) points out that " in the former the base of the fold forming the mantle- 
 skirt comprises in its area a part of what is unreflected visceral hump in the latter." 

The consequence of this invasion of organs into the substance of the mantle is 
 that when the ventro-lateral fold of the latter is pulled back and turned inside out in 
 order to expose the pallial organs, the normal antero-posterior relations of parts are 
 inverted and what is actually placed anteriorly in the natural position of the mantle 
 (PI. LXXV.) becomes posterior when the mantle is retroverted (PL LXXVL). This 
 simple fact has led to much confusion of terminology, actual topographical conditions 
 being confused either with mechanically retroverted positions or with inferred morpho- 
 logical relations of parts 1 . 

Of the nine apertures which open into or near the fundus of the mantle-cavity 
 only four were seen by Owen, namely the two viscero-pericardial orifices, the anus and 
 the opening of the female generative apparatus. Four more, the renal apertures, were 
 added by Valenciennes (1841), and their relations further elucidated by Vrolik 2 . The 
 full number of nine was first established in 1883 by the important discovery announced 
 by Lankester and Bourne 3 of the existence of a rudimentary antimere of the functional 
 generative orifice, represented on the left side by the external pore of the vestigial 
 structure known as the pyriform gland. 

In the male the generative pore is carried forwards and occupies a prominent 
 median position adherent to the vena cava, but the penis is divided by a septum 
 internally so that it possesses two lumina. Externally the terminal portion of the male 
 generative apparatus appears to be symmetrical, an appearance which is heightened 
 especially in the young by the existence of an arcuate radix on the left side as well 
 as that which leads to the so-called Needhamian vesicle on the right, but the left lumen 
 ends blindly behind and as shown by Lankester, Bourne, and later by Graham Kerr 4 , 
 the opening of the pyriform gland is independent and has the same relations in the 
 male as in the female. 

In the female the genital orifice is placed on the right side precisely in the angle 
 made by the insertion of the mantle into the body-wall, and is represented by a 
 transverse bilabiate vulva which is prominent in the adult but lies deep and concealed 
 in the young.

It may seem strange to unite these structures in one heading but it is not so strange 
 as it looks, especially when we remember that the siphuncle is essentially and entirely
