SIPHUNCLE AND PALLIAL VESSELS. 755 

an appendix of the visceral sac, that is to say, of the visceral portion of the mantle, 
 and that it owes whatever physiological importance it may possess to the blood which 
 is supplied to it from the pallial circulation. While describing the latter we are 
 necessarily led to speak of the siphuncle, which is a vascular vermiform process of the 
 mantle and hence the reason for their association in one chapter. 

By means of injections practised upon fresh specimens when I was living on the 
 shores of Blanche Bay, I obtained a fair knowledge of the distribution of the pallial 
 arteries, such in fact as had not been possible to my predecessors working with pre- 
 served material only. I published an account of the results of my injections in 1896 
 (Quart. Journ. Micr. Sc, Vol. 39), which I propose to recapitulate here, the more im- 
 portant, in my own opinion, relating to the vascularisation of the siphuncle, which does 
 not, as was formerly supposed from the time of Owen's memoir (1832) to that of 
 Dr Haller's memoir 1 , published in 1895, receive a main artery direct from the heart 
 but merely a secondary and two or three tertiary ramifications from the posterior pallial 
 artery. 

Looked at from below through the transparent wall of the mantle the heart is seen 
 lying in the pericardium in the form of a transversely elongated somewhat oblong body 
 placed immediately behind the level of the mantle-insertion and receiving at its four 
 corners the paired branchio-cardiac or efferent branchial vessels (PL LXXXIL). The 
 hinder surface of the heart is slightly convex, while the anterior surface is emarginate, 
 and from the base of the groove there issues a very short vessel called by Owen the 
 rt lesser aorta," which he correctly described as dividing almost immediately into two 
 branches, of which he thought the anterior was "exclusively distributed to the mucous 
 organ of the oviduct" (1832, p. 36), by which he meant the nidamental gland, while 
 the posterior passing backwards between the ovary and the gizzard entered, " without 
 diminution of size, the membranous tube that traverses the partitions of the shell." 
 A third branch (intestinal artery) arising after the bifurcation of the lesser aorta was 
 correctly described by Owen as being distributed to the mesentery between the ascending 
 and descending limbs of the last loop of the intestine. 

The two primary branches of the lesser aorta are respectively the anterior 
 and posterior pallial arteries, the former supplying the anterior free mantle fold with 
 arterial blood, and the latter irrigating the posterior or visceral portion of the mantle, 
 including the siphuncle. 

The anterior pallial artery bends at first inwards and downwards to the middle 
 line, and then runs forwards below the skin at the surface of the renal sacs. At the 
 point where it turns forwards a small intestinal branch (i.a.) is given off. Arrived at 
 the anterior limit of the region of the renal sacs, which, as already mentioned, forms 
 part of the free mantle-skirt, the anterior pallial artery passes into the substance of 
 the mantle and runs forwards towards the free margin of the latter. At some distance, 
 13 or 14 mm., from the free margin of the mantle, the anterior pallial artery divides
