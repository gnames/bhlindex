The posterior pallial artery runs backwards, crossing over the ventral surface of the 
 heart and leaving the pericardium through the median orifice of the pallio-visceral 
 ligament. It then passes backwards without branching on the left side of the gonad 
 between the latter and the gizzard, adhering to the gonad by a ligament named by 
 Haller the genito-inteslinal ligament. This ligament binds the gonad and intestine to 
 the posterior wall of the perivisceral coelom with an insertion into the wall of some 
 20 mm. in length running in a dorso-ventral direction. At a site near the middle 
 of the line of insertion of the genito-intestinal ligament into the posterior body-wall 
 occurs the root of the siphuncle. The posterior pallial artery reaches the posterior body- 
 wall through the intermediation of the free ventral border of the ligament at a point 
 distant by 5 mm. from the root of the siphuncle. Upon reaching, in the way described 
 above, what is approximately the middle point of the posterior rounded surface of the 
 body, the posterior pallial artery passes into the integument and immediately divides 
 into two main branches which supply the dorsal and posterior regions of the mantle, 
 including the siphuncle. The two main branches of the posterior pallial artery are 
 the pallio-septal arteries, so called because they supply that portion of the mantle which 
 secretes the septa of the shell.

Figs. 4 and 5. N. pompilius, S . Two views of the dorsal surface of the pallio-visceral region, to show the 

principal ramifications of the posterior pallial artery. The siphuncular artery (s.a.) has a dextral origin 

in Fig. 4, sinistral in Fig. 5.

A variable number of small arteries are distributed to the siphuncle, but there is 
 one branch, a secondary branch of the posterior pallial artery, which may be regarded
