SIPHUNCLE AND PALLIAL VESSELS. 759 

aber nur mit einer. Somit ist das Innere vom Sipho als die directe Fortsetzung des 
 grossen Cblomraumes aufzufassen, und das Colomepithel setzt sich als ein niedrig- 
 cubisches, beinahe plattes Epithel in die Siphonalhbhlung continuirlich fort." 

The relative importance of a correct knowledge of the nature of the siphuncular 
 cavity is too obvious to render an apology for the quotations which I have given 
 necessary. In fact this cavity is a venous cavity or haemocoel, as I have satisfied 
 myself by means of transverse and longitudinal sections, but above all by dissection, 
 which besides showing the non-existence of any opening into the coelom has revealed 
 the presence of a hitherto undescribed venous channel, which I will call the posterior 
 pallial vein, into which the siphuncular vein, i.e. the axial cavity of the siphuncle, 
 discharges (PI. LXXVL, figs. 7 and 8). It is quite probable that the posterior pallial 
 vein which runs above, approximated to, and parallel with, the posterior pallial artery 
 in the genito-intestinal ligament, is identical with the "free passage" which Owen 
 described as coursing alongside of the posterior pallial artery between the pericardium 
 and the siphuncle. As a matter of fact the channel which occurs in this position is 
 a vein which runs forwards until it arrives at the pericardium, when it bends up above 
 the dorsal wall of the latter and enters the central venous sinus from whence the 
 afferent branchial vessels are given off. 

The finer structure of the siphuncle (PI. LXXXIII.) is complicated and not readily 
 intelligible. Surrounding the central vein is a loose meshwork of trabeculae, the meshes 
 communicating with one another and with the central vein. The communications 
 between the peripheral system of spaces and the central sinus are best seen in longi- 
 tudinal sections, but are also to be found in transverse sections. The external epithelium 
 of the true or pallial siphuncle which secretes the partially calcified and partially horny 
 siphuncle, which remains behind after the soft parts are extracted, presents a very 
 peculiar structure. This has been in part correctly described by Haller, who states 
 {op. cit., p. 201) that the entire surface of the siphuncle is thrown into very fine 
 longitudinal folds due to the plaited membrana basilaris of the epithelium, and in each 
 plication of the basement-membrane there is a narrow space lined by flattened endo- 
 thelium (Haller, op. cit, Taf. XII., fig. 19). 

I can confirm the existence of these folds, although they do not appear in my 
 preparations to be so regular as Dr Haller describes and figures them. Moreover I cannot 
 see the regular deep epidermal pits which alternate in correspondence with the subjacent 
 mesodermal folds in his figures. What seems very remarkable is the fact that the 
 spaces in the folds are in reality prolongations from the meshes of the trabecular tissue 
 of the siphuncle, and therefore represent intra-epidermal blood-spaces. I think this 
 circumstance must throw some light on the function of the siphuncle, which is essentially 
 a vascular appendix. I have already expressed the possibility that the siphuncle would 
 be capable of keeping the air in the chambers up to the normal pressure by making 
 good losses caused by diffusion. The same, or a closely similar suggestion, was in fact 
 made by Keferstein (1865, op. cit. p. 374)'.
