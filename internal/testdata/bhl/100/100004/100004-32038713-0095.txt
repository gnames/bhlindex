free lip of the shell merges into the umbilicus. When a large enough hole has been 
 made in the shell to admit the scissors, the shell being still held upside down, the 
 postero- ventral visceral portion of the body behind the annulus usually detaches itself 
 from the shell, or can be readily caused to do so, and sinking inwards, exposes the 
 root of the siphuncle, which can then be severed. Upon righting the shell the body 
 resumes its normal contact with the fundus of the shell, thus preventing an immediate 
 and extensive hemorrhage. For example a Nautilus treated in this way, and replaced 
 in the sea at a suitable spot, swam about vigorously for some time in the middle stratum
