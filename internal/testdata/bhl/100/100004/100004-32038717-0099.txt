FUNNEL AND CAPITO-PEDAL CARTILAGE. 765 

may be gathered from such a dissection as that represented in fig. 1, PI. LXXXL, that 
 the main axis of the cephalopodium, as indicated by the general trend of the tentacular 
 sheaths, does not coincide with the skeletal axis but describes an angle with it. I shall 
 refer to this matter again under the heading " Flexure and Orientation," but meanwhile 
 I cannot help thinking that the occurrence of conflicting axes in relation to the 
 cephalopodium of Nautilus may have morphological significance, as affording evidence 
 of profound topographical changes which have upset the primitive axial simplicity. Such 
 an axial disturbance is no longer apparent in the Dibranchiata, so that whatever it may 
 indicate, it is at all events a remarkable feature in the organisation of Nautilus and 
 should be, though it never has been, taken into account. 

The limit of the extension of the anterior cornua into the crura of the funnel is 
 superficially indicated on each side by the presence of a limbate border (I). These cornua 
 do not reach to the base of the tongue-like valve which is inserted upon the inner 
 surface of the dorsal wall of the funnel. 

The posterior cornua underlie the optic ganglia, the olfactory labyrinths (rhinophores) 
 and the otocysts in the order named (cf. PI. LXXXL fig. 5), but do not embrace these 
 structures. Into the hinder extremities of the posterior cornua are inserted the retractor 
 muscles of the buccal cone (PL LXXXL fig. 7), and the angles in which the insertion 
 takes place constitute deep pits in the fundus of the peristomial haemocoel. 

The funnel itself comprises several regions which differ in colour, texture and function. 
 Its anterior and posterior portions are separated from one another by the anterior cornua 
 and body of the cartilage. At the forward limit of the latter there occurs externally 
 a peculiar border or limbus, the limbus infundibuli (I). If the funnel be cut across behind 
 the limbus the whitish crura infundibuli penetrated by a pair of subcylindrical muscles, 
 the levatores infundibuli of Owen, lying in their own venous sinus on each side, are 
 seen to be clearly separated by the anterior cornua of the cartilage, from the soft brownish 
 yellow alae infundibuli which extend backwards and dorsally to the base of the nuchal 
 membrane. (PI. LXXXII. fig. 3.) It is one of the best known peculiarities of the 
 organisation of Nautilus that the funnel is cleft down the ventral surface, so that its 
 flaps overlap and present a free border throughout their entire length. The anterior 
 portion of the free borders of the flaps belongs to the region of the crura, and the 
 posterior portion to that of the alae, although of course quite continuous. The crura 
 are united together dorsally by the thin median wall of the funnel which rests in the 
 infundibular fossa of the great oral sheath and carries, on its inner surface, the large 
 valve of the funnel. Behind this thin-walled anterior portion, the dorsal wall of the 
 funnel, between the alae, is greatly thickened owing to the presence of the spongy 
 compressor muscle, the transverse fibres of which are inserted into the median keel of the 
 cartilage {carina cartilaginis). 

In the fresh condition the integument which covers the compressor muscles and the 
 adjoining surface of the alae infundibuli is found to be a slimy, mucous membrane, forming 
 two large pads meeting in the middle line and constituting the mucus-gland of the funnel. 
 It is interesting to note that Jatta 1 has interpreted the funnel-organ of Dibranchiate
