766 FUNNEL AND CAPITO-PEDAL CARTILAGE. 

Cephalopoda as a mucus-gland, and has further homologised it with the pedal gland of the 
 Gastropoda. 

After comparing the figures published by Jatta, relating to the funnel-organ of 
 Sepia officinalis, Octopus vulgaris and other species, I have no doubt that the funnel- 
 gland of Nautilus is an organ homologous with the corresponding structure in the funnel 
 of other Cephalopoda. I have not made sections through this gland, and shall have no 
 further opportunity of doing so, but I have really no hesitation in the matter notwith- 
 standing this omission (cf. PI. LXXVI. fig. 1). 

The funnel-organ of Nautilus passes laterally into the alae infundibuli. and posteriorly 
 it is attached to the ventral surface of the skin covering the shell-muscles by an elongated 
 limbus. I observed a network of what I took to be venous channels below the mucosa 
 of the funnel-organ, and two large veins passing from the limbus into the vena cava. 
 (See figures on PL LXXXII. and LXXXIII.) 

The cartilage forms a very incomplete wall to the endochondral sinus, only the ventral 
 and lateral sides being bounded by massive cartilage, while dorsally there is a narrow bar 
 of cartilage (arcus cartilaginis) which forms two bosses projecting into the peristomial 
 haemocoel between the pedal and visceral commissures. Between the arcus and the pedal 
 commissure are to be seen two orifices which represent main conduits leading from the 
 peristomial haemocoel to the endochondral sinus (PL LXXXII.). Behind the arcus occurs 
 the insertion of the inferior retractor muscles of the buccal cone into the body of the 
 cartilage on each side. 

The infundibular nerves arise from the pedal commissure and run straight forwards 
 into the crura infundibuli dorsad and ectad of the tubular sinuses, in which the above- 
 mentioned levator muscles lie. Their topography will be elucidated in the chapter on 
 the peristomial haemocoel. 

In concluding the present chapter, I should like to emphasize the view that the 
 capito-pedal cartilage of Nautilus is to a large extent a funnel-cartilage, and is probably 
 not directly homologous with the cephalic cartilage of Dibranchs, but related to the 
 latter through substitution. It is of course obvious that the principle of substitution is 
 apt to become little more than a form of words, and to convey no true image to the mind. 
 In regard to the endoskeleton of Cephalopoda the idea which is present to my mind is 
 the following. The cephalic cartilage is to the Dibranchs what the capito-pedal cartilage 
 is to Nautilus, but the former is not to be identified with the latter, and does not 
 merely represent a specialisation of it. If this be so we might expect to find traces 
 of a true capito-pedal or funnel-cartilage in the Dibranchs, and indeed a pah- of siphonal 
 cartilages 1 curiously recalling the cornua of the cartilage of Nautilus, has been discovered 
 by Hoyle 2 in the remarkable and, in more than one sense, primitive genus Gonatus. 
 Without venturing to express the definite opinion that these apparently rudimentary 
 siphonal cartilages of Gonatus may represent vestiges of a capito-pedal cartilage such as 
 occurs in the still more primitive genus Nautilus, I think the suggestion may be one 
 worthy of the attention of teuthologists, although the fact that they occur in the ventral 

1 The funnel of Cephalopoda is often quite properly called the siphon but the latter term is also quite 
 improperly applied to the siphuncle of Tetrabranchiates, and for this reason I have avoided its use.
