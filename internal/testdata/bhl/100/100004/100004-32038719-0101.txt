wall of the siphon of Gonatus might be thought to militate against this view. Still 
 the anterior cornua of the cartilage of Nautilus penetrate into the ventral wall of the 
 funnel. 

9. Digital and Ophthalmic Tentacles. 

The head or cephalopodium of Nautilus comprises the better half of the animal, and 
 represents a complication of organs and appendages performing divers functions. The 
 body-wall in this region is composed in the main of a thick coriaceous integument, which 
 presents a dorsal convexity formed by the mottled brown-coloured hood, and three deep 
 concavities, anterior, posterior and ventral. The anterior deepest concavity is the fossa 
 buccalis, which is surrounded by the tentacular crown and lodges the great buccal cone ; 
 the posterior concavity is the fossa nuchalis which receives the anfractus of the shell, 
 and gives origin to a muscular flap, the semilunar nuchal membrane ; finally the ventral 
 concavity is the fossa infundibular is, which varies somewhat in depth according to the 
 state of muscular contraction of the parts concerned in its formation, and is exactly 
 suited to receive the funnel. 

The cephalopodium of Nautilus consists of a tentacular crown disposed about the 
 mouth in the form of an oral sheath, and composed of two whorls, outer and inner. 
 The outer circlet 1 of tentacles comprises the " digital processes " of Owen, while the inner 
 circlet consists of the so-called " labial processes," but the latter is an unfortunate term, 
 since the actual buccal orifice is provided with a prominent lip surrounding the mandibles 
 and richly furnished with labial papillae. I therefore propose to refer to the tentacles 
 generally, whether belonging to the outer or to the inner whorl, as digital tentacles. The 
 two tentacles, the one in front of, and the other behind the eye on each side, which 
 Owen named " ophthalmic tentacles," really belong to the outer whorl, but have become 
 so modified in function and position as to require separate treatment. 

The tentacles arise from the bottom of profound sheaths, within which those of the 
 outer whorl are completely retractile and those of the inner whorl partially so, but in 
 either case it is at once apparent that the tentacles are essentially marginal appendages. 

The digital tentacles have been more particularly described as to their structure 
 and distribution by Owen (1832), Valenciennes (1841), Owen 2 (1843), Lankester and 
 Bourne (1883), Vayssiere (1896), Willey 3 (1897), Griffin 4 (1898). These tentacles have 
 in general a trihedral form tapering slightly towards the tip, and are divided by shallow 
 annular grooves into a large number 5 of articulations, the grooves being deeper on the
