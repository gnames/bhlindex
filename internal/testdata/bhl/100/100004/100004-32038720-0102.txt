768 DIGITAL AND OPHTHALMIC TENTACLES. 

inner sides which form the bases of the trihedra, so that a series of transverse ridges 
 is produced, by means of which the tentacles are able to adhere to surfaces in a manner 
 analogous to the action of the feet of a gecko. When attached to a rough surface by 
 means of the suctorial ridges the tentacles may be drawn out to a great length in all 
 directions, and hold on to their support with so much tenacity that sometimes when 
 I forcibly detached the animal some of the tentacles broke off and remained fixed to 
 the substratum. The suctorial ridges of the tentacles have a pale neutral tint in the 
 fresh state, while the crests and sides of the trihedra are distinguished by a deep 
 brown pigment. The tentacles which thus act in a way resembling the arms of the 
 Dibranchiate Cephalopoda are the digital tentacles of the outer whorl. They have 
 an adhesive, prehensile and tactile function. 

In the middle of each tentacle runs a large axial nerve, which originates directly 
 from the ganglionic nerve-centre and presents, as was first noted by Griffin, a series of 
 slight ganglionic enlargements at its periphery, in correspondence with the annulation 
 of the tentacle. In sagittal section the axial nerve is seen with its peripheral ganglion 
 cells which constitute an almost unbroken layer on the ventral side of the nerve, that 
 is on the side nearest to the suctorial ridges, but on the opposite side are segregated 
 into groups. The suctorial ridges appear as bold outstanding nearly flat-topped excrescences 
 slightly convex, with a tendency to imbricate at their edges. They are covered with a high 
 and very dense epidermis which passes abruptly into the indifferent layer which lines 
 the intervening grooves. Below the nerve the tentacle is traversed by an artery, and 
 below that again, a venous channel 1 . Owen (1843) graphically described the dense central 
 tissue which protects the nerve and artery, from whence radiating fasciculi proceed to 
 the periphery with longitudinal muscular bundles in the meshes. He also pointed out 
 how similar requirements elsewhere are met by analogous structure. Thus " the mechanical 
 arrangement of the contractile fibres is very similar to that of the complex muscles 
 described by Cuvier in the proboscis of the elephant. The attenuation and elongation 
 of this brobdignagian [sic] tentacle must be effected without compressing the central 
 breathing-tubes and the transverse fibres accordingly radiate from the dense ligamentous 
 tissue which surrounds the tubes." We may add that a closely analogous structure is 
 met with in the proboscis of the Enteropneusta. The arms of the other Cephalopoda 
 are also built upon the same plan. Owen duly noted the suctorial ridges which he 
 described as presenting " the appearance of a number of close-set transverse plates." He 
 says further that " this modification must increase the prehensile and sentient properties 
 of the inner surface of the tentacle, and it is on the corresponding part of the larger 
 and fewer tentacles of the Dibranchiate Cephalopods that the acetabula are developed." 
 Again on p. 310 (1843) he states that " the prehensile surface of the tentacula of the 
 Nautilus is made adhesive, after the type of the simple laminated sucker of the Remora." 
 Finally the primary import of the tentacles of Nautilus is "plainly indicated by the 
 direct derivation of their central nerve from the cephalic ganglion." 

These quotations serve to show that Owen had acquired a very just appreciation 
 of the general nature of the digital tentacles, although it should be noted that the fact
