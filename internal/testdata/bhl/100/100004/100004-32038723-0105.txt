DIGITAL AND OPHTHALMIC TENTACLES. 771 

The above tables seem to betray ineradicable divergencies, due merely to different 
 points of view. There is, however, one door left open for immediate criticism. It might 
 at least have been expected that there would be agreement as to the first and the 
 last, but such is not the case. Vayssiere's nineteenth tentacle is my eighth, and my last 
 is Vayssiere's seventeenth. 

It was admitted by Owen and his successors that the main bulk of the hood consists 
 of "two digitations conjoined along the mesial line 1 ." "The median antero-posterior line 
 traversing this hood exactly corresponds to the line of concrescence of the two halves 
 of the fore-foot, which primitively grew forward, one on each side of the head, and finally 
 fused together along this line 2 ." Seeing that the lateral portions of the hood are actually 
 formed by the cohesion of the sheaths of the second pair of tentacles with the main 
 body of the hood, it appears reasonable to infer that the latter arose by concrescence 
 of the sheaths of the first pair. The median portion of the hood of Nautilus is thus 
 taken to represent a dorsal symphysial tract. 

I have found no reference to the occurrence of a ventral symphysial tract 3 and yet, 
 I think, that is the nature of the bridge which forms the fundus of the concavity which 
 lodges the funnel, and at the same time completes the outer circlet (annular lobe of 
 Lankester) across the ventral median line. At the corners of this tract are placed the 
 tentacles of the nineteenth pair, in very much the same way as the tentacles of the 
 first pair occur near the outer borders of the median portion of the hood, and I think 
 it likely that this ventral tract owes its origin to the concrescence of the sheaths of the 
 last pair of tentacles, just as the dorsal tract admittedly represents the fused sheaths of 
 the first pair. An indication of the bilateral constitution of the ventral tract is furnished 
 by the mesial line which divides the laminae of the mucous gland which develops upon 
 its inner surface in the female 4 . If it is true that there is a ventral symphysial tract, then 
 it is clear that the tentacles which are most intimately associated with it and immediately 
 border it are to be reckoned as the last of the series. 

Assuming then that my identification of the nineteenth pair of tentacles of the outer 
 circlet is correct, it still remains to justify the enumeration of the tentacles which 
 intervene between the first and the last. Taking into consideration their evident character 
 as marginal appendages of an annular lobe, we may further assume that the border out 
 of which they arose was not plain but frilled like an undulating membrane, and that 

1 Owen, Memoir 1832, p. 13. Owen seems to have erred somewhat in his counting of the tentacles 
 through anxiety on behalf of even numbers. The passage runs as follows : â€” " Of the digital processes nineteen 
 have been enumerated on either side ; but as the hood has two perforations anteriorly from which tentacles 
 similar to those of the digitations are also protruded, we may consider this part as two digitations conjoined 
 along the mesial line, and so reckon with Eumphius the even number of twenty digitations on either side 
 of the head."

3 Except perhaps in the memoir by Valenciennes (1841), who describes the two inferior arms as being 
 united below by a thin plate hollowed out to receive the funnel, while on the inner surface of the plate, 
 on each side of the median line of junction, there is in the female a lamellated organ, the same which 
 has recently been shown by Mr Graham Kerr to serve as a receptacle for the spermatophore.
