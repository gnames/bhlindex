776 DIGITAL AND OPHTHALMIC TENTACLES. 

omitted, and I have also not reckoned them numerically with the digital tentacles, but 
 their morphological valency as the first two tentacles of the outer whorl of the cephalo- 
 podium of Nautilus is I think clear, and I shall again refer to the recurrent nerve 
 of the posterior ophthalmic tentacle 1 . 

The inner whorl of the cephalopodium is incomplete dorsally, and moreover it is 
 broken up into distinct tentaculiferous and lamelligerous lobes which have become more 
 or less specialised as accessory sexual organs, and exhibit profound sexual differences 
 which are tolerably familiar to malacologists. There are two principal groups of tentacles 
 of the inner whorl which may be described as extrabuccal and infrabuccal, and correspond 
 to Owen's " external labials "and "internal labials " respectively. The objections to Owen's 
 terminology are firstly that the epithets " external " and " internal " obscure the view that 
 the tentacles belong to an inner whorl, and secondly the expression " labial " is inappropriate 
 and apt to cause confusion with the labial papillose fringe which surrounds the jaws. 

In the female the extrabuccal lobes carry twelve ordinary tentacles on each side, 
 of which eight are disposed in a descending and four in an ascending series. The lobes 
 themselves consist of the coalescent sheaths of the tentacles borne upon a fleshy basis 
 which rises up from the fundus of the fossa buccalis. The extrabuccal lobes adhere 
 ventrally to the inner surface of the outer whorl 2 by means of an intercoronal membrane 
 which proceeds on each side from the ventral border of the lobe (cf. PI. LXXX. figs. 7 
 and 8, i). 

In the male the extrabuccal tentacles are subdivided into three groups, an upper 
 series of eight tentacles with coalescent sheaths, a middle set of three, and a single 
 ventral free tentacle. The free tentacle is usually found to nestle within a groove formed 
 by a vertical flap which grows out from the sheath of the first tentacle of the middle 
 set or the ninth of the entire series, or it may follow simply at the end of the series. 
 The middle set comprising the ninth to the eleventh extrabuccal tentacles, together with 
 the free twelfth tentacle, constitute a natural group of four which are known as the 
 spadix on the one side and the antispadix on the other. The intercoronal membrane 
 arises in the male from the lower border of the upper set of coalescent tentacular sheaths 
 (1 — 8), and passes unattached in front of the tetrad group to its insertion into the 
 inner wall of the outer (annular) lobe. 

The ventral or infrabuccal lobe of the inner whorl is modified in both sexes to form 
 a special infrabuccal apparatus. In the female it consists of a median laminated organ 
 flanked on each side by a uniserial row of 12 — 14 tentacles; the lamellae are modified 
 tentacles and retain their apices (PL LXXIX. fig. 6, and PI. LXXX. fig. 11). In the 
 male there are no unmodified tentacles remaining in connection with the infrabuccal 
 apparatus, which is completely metamorphosed into a laminated organ, known as Van der 
 Hoeven's organ, retractile within a pouch and closely adherent to the ventral integument 
 of the buccal cone. 

I do not propose to enter upon a long description of these structures, partly because 
 this has already been done by others, and partly because I was unable to ascertain the 
 manner in which the various parts are brought into action. 

1 In my experience the most suitable material for the successful dissection of the tentacular nerves of 
 Nautilus consists of soft specimens and not of such as have become too hard under preservation. 

2 The outer whorl is the "oral sheath" of Owen the "annular lobe" of Laukester.
