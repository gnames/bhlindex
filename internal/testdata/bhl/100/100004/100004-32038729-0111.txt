DIGITAL AND OPHTHALMIC TENTACLES. 777 

The spadix is a composite erectile organ (PI. LXXVIII. fig. 4) which occurs indifferently 
 on the right or left side of the cephalopodium. It was originally described by Van der 
 Hoeven 1 , and has since been treated in greater detail by Professors Haswell 2 and Vayssiere 3 . 
 This organ shows a gradual development from the early to the adult life of the animal, 
 only attaining its full growth at sexual maturity (cf. PI. LXXX. figg. 3 — 7 and PI. LXXIX. 
 figg. 9 and 10). The ninth extrabuccal tentacle constitutes the glans and. its sheath, the 
 prepuce. The latter gives rise to a free fold along its outer border, and at the summit 
 bears a large thick glandular cushion covered with bordered pits, which may be described 
 as the preputial gland. The tenth tentacle (the second of the spadix) is a fleshy flattened 
 appendage strongly ribbed upon its glandular surface. The third tentacle of the spadix 
 (eleventh of the series) is also a flattened foliaceous appendage, but in place of the 
 transverse costae of the preceding tentacle, it presents a marvellous system of glandular 
 crypts, producing the appearance, as Professor Haswell pointed out, of a minute honeycomb. 
 The last tentacle, the twelfth extrabuccal, is somewhat enlarged, but otherwise undergoes 
 comparatively little modification and is partially concealed, on the outer aspect of the 
 spadix, beneath the flap of the prepuce. The second tentacle of the spadix may be 
 distinguished as the costate tentacle, the third as the tessellate tentacle, and the fourth as 
 the free tentacle or cirrus. 

Like all the other accessory sexual organs of both male and female, the spadix manifests 
 a gradual development pari passu with the growth of the animal. I use the word 
 " development " in contrast with " growth " to express the fact that in the young Nautilus 
 the character of the spadix is quite different from the adult structure of the organ. 

The smallest Nautilus which I ever obtained was a male N. pompilius 1 with the 
 following dimensions : — ■ 

Length from root of siphuncle to mid-anterior point of hood (measured 

along the dorsum) 5 25 mm. 

Length of hood along middle line 10"5 „ 

Breadth of body across middle of eyes 15 „ 

The shell was perforated at the umbilicus and contained thirteen air-chambers. 

At this stage it is not possible to say upon which side of the cephalopodium the 
 definitive spadix will appear, the two groups of four tentacles — numbers 9 to 12 of the 
 inner, whorl — being almost exactly alike, notably in regard to the tardy development 
 of the 10th tentacle (PL LXXX. figg. 1 and 2). 

After this stage the growth in length of tentacles 9 — 11 of the future spadix becomes

 of the hood was white and unpigmented when the specimen was brought to me, but this may have been 
 due to previous discharge of pigment from the epidermal cells of the hood. This often happens when the 
 animals are kept under unfavourable conditions.

 N. pompilius from the Moluccan Sea than any that I obtained in New Britain.
