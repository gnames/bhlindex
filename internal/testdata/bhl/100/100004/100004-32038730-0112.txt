778 DIGITAL AND OPHTHALMIC TENTACLES. 

arrested while number 12 continues to grow, and thus appears for a time to be the 
 most important member of the confederation, until eventually its limit is reached, the 
 others forge ahead and number 12 retires behind the curtain which grows out from the 
 sheath of number 9 (cf. PL LXXX. figg. 7 and 4) 1 . 

The infrabuccal organ of the male consists of a bipartite laminated structure contained 
 in a pouch formed by the integument of the buccal membrane, which in adult specimens 
 projects far back into the peristomial haemocoel (PL LXXXII. fig. 3). It was first 
 described and figured by Van der Hoeven' 2 (1850) who regarded the lamellae as tentacles 
 modified in a manner similar to those of Owen's laminated organ in the centre of the 
 infrabuccal lobe of the female. 

Van der Hoeven's organ (PL LXXX. figg. 13 — 15) has recently been described in 
 some detail by Dr L. E. Griffin 3 . It consists in the adult of a pair of fleshy narrow 
 lobes parallel to one another, closely approximated in the middle line and bearing, upon 
 the outer surface of each about fifteen to nineteen lamellae of which only a certain 
 number are visible in external view, the others being concealed below them like the 
 leaves of a book. 

The lamelligerous lobes are united together at the base by an intermediate portion 
 which forms a sort of peduncle, and the adoral surface of lobes and peduncle is beset 
 with the openings of glands, which discharge their secretion into the cavity of the pouch 
 in which the organ is contained (PL LXXX. fig. 14). Often in preserved specimens 
 a coagulum is found at the orifice of the pouch. In sections cutting the lamellae at 
 right angles the epithelium clothing the surfaces of the lamellae appears to be richly 
 ciliated, an appearance due, as described by Griffin, to the occurrence of numerous 
 sensory cells bearing sense-hairs. 

In a very young male of iV. pompilius, the smallest specimen which I obtained, the 
 appearance of the infrabuccal organ is different from that which it presents in the adult. 
 Instead of being bent into a U -shape as it becomes at a later stage, the two halves of 
 the gland are extended in the transverse direction with a narrow median tract between 
 the ridges which represent the future lamellae (PL LXXIX. fig. 12). The appearance of 
 the infrabuccal organ at this stage suggests that its lamellae are homologous with the 
 tentacles only of the female infrabuccal organ, while the group of lamellae (Owen's 
 "olfactory" organ) between the tentaculiferous lobes is reduced to an insignificant median 
 tract in the male. If this be so, then the infrabuccal organ of the male is not simply 
 homologous with that of the female, but chiefly with the tentacular portion of the latter, 
 the median lamellae of the female organ being mostly suppressed in the male, and the 
 lateral tentacles of the former converted into lamellae in the latter. Apart, however, from 
 the interesting evidence furnished by the development of the male infrabuccal organ, its 
 composition in the adult suggests the same homologies which we may tabulate.
