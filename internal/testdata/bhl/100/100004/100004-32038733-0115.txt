side, when a forest of slender conjunctive trabeculae are found passing from the inner 
 (mesial) surface of the liver to the wall of the crop. 

The peristomial haemocoel is virtually separated from the peri-oesophageal space by 
 a tendinous diaphragm on the dorsal side, and by the tissues and organs of the fundus 
 elsewhere. The diaphragm is a very definite structure stretching from the cerebral 
 capsule to the body- wall in the region of the nuchal membrane (PI. LXXXI. fig. 7, and 
 PL LXXXIII. fig. 26). 

The nerve-collar which strictly surrounds the oesophagus is the cerebro-visceral loop. 
 The pedal commissure is separated from contiguity with the oesophagus by an interval 
 which is occupied by the ventral retractor muscles of the buccal mass. The oesophagus 
 passes into the buccal mass precisely at the level of the fundus of the peristomial 
 haemocoel, so that the oesophagus proper lies entirely within the peri-oesophageal haemocoel, 
 the buccal mass 1 with its attendant muscles and nerves being the only portion of the 
 digestive apparatus which occurs within the limits of the peristomial haemocoel. 

The cerebral portion of the cerebro-visceral nerve-collar lies within the peristomial 
 haemocoel (PL LXXXI. fig. 7) while the vis- 
 ceral portion lies within the peri-oesophageal 
 haemocoel (PL LXXXIII. fig. 26). Within 
 the mass of the cephalopodium at the angle 
 of junction of the cerebral and visceral por- 
 tions of the nerve-collar occur the cephalic 
 organs of special sense (eye, rhinophore, and 
 otocyst) and their nerves. The demarcation 
 of these components of the nervous system is 
 therefore clear. 

The greater or systemic aorta of Nautilus 
 arises as a large truncus arteriosus 2 from the 
 left dorso-posterior region of the heart and 
 leaves the pericardium through the left peri- 
 cardio-visceral fontanelle. On its mesial side 
 as it leaves the heart it is adherent to the 
 ligament which binds the heart to the floor 
 of the pericardium. Haller (1895) points out 
 that this cardiac ligament is a very primitive 
 structure, representing the place of origin of 
 the heart in the coelom. 

Having emerged from the pericardium, 
 the great aorta, after a short upwardly directed 
 course through the perivisceral coelom, enters the peri-hepatic haemocoel between the 

1 There are no extra-bulbar salivary glands in Nautilus, but intra-bulbar glands in relation with Owen's 
 faucial follicles have been described by Griffin (Zool. Bull. 1897, Vol. i. p. 149, fig. 4). Compare also

2 There are simple valves (noted by Owen) at the bases of the branchio-cardiac trunks and a semilunar 
 valve at the root of the truncus arteriosus.
