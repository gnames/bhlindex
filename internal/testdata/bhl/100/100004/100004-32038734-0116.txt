 adult) sends off two important arteries, the hepatic artery on the left and the gastric 
 artery on the right of the main aortic trunk. It then turns definitely forwards dorsad 
 of the crop, giving off other branches (Text-fig. 8) until it reaches the intercoelic 
 diaphragm which separates the peristomial from the peri-oesophageal haemocoel on the 
 dorsal side. Having arrived at this level, the dorsal aorta divides into the two main

Fig. 9. N. pompilius, 3 . Dissection, from above, of the cephalic region to show the cephalic arteries. An 
 incision has been made through the nuchal membrane, the hood, and the buccal membrane. The brain- 
 capsule has been opened, and the median portion of the mantle behind the nuchal region has been 
 removed, b.c. buccal cone ; tent. int. extrabuccal tentacles (the external labial processes of Owen) ; l.a. labial 
 arteries supplying the buccal membrane and fringe; s.m.a. superior mandibular artery; s.r. superior retractor
