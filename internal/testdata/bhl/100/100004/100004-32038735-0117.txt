PERISTOMIAL, HAEMOCOEL ; SYSTEMIC AORTA; CEPHALIC ARTERIES. 783 

After giving off branches to the buccal mass and to the shell-muscle, the main 
 vessel on each side passes below the cerebral capsule, and follows the inner concave 
 border of the coronal (pedal) ganglion (PL LXXXIII. fig. 28). Having arrived at the end 
 of the ganglionic swelling, at the point where the latter passes into the comparatively 
 slender pedal commissure, the vessel passes below or behind the ganglion, and then bends 
 sharply backwards and upwards, sending branches to the tentacles (PI. LXXXII. fig. 5). 

Although too much stress need not be laid upon the vagaries of blood-vessels, yet 
 I think that this recurrent course of the main tentacular arteries may be regarded as 
 an indication of an important transposition of parts or change of topography which has 
 taken place during the evolution of the nautiline plan of organisation. 

At the point of flexure of the tentacular artery on each side a large branch is given 
 off which traverses the cartilage and is distributed to the alae infundibuli. 

In the peristomial fundus there are symmetrically placed apertures leading into 
 various lacunae in the massive cephalopodium ; there is one particularly large sinus 
 surrounding the lower portion of the spadix in the male (PL LXXXII. fig. 5). The 
 intrabulbar sinuses are of great complexity and I do not propose to analyse them. They 
 are all connected by more or less wide fontanelles with each other and with the 
 peristomial haemocoel. 

With regard to the stomatogastric nerves I have nothing to add to Mr Graham 
 Kerr's account, except that the nerves are more deep-seated than his description might 
 lead one to expect. They are below the sheet-like protractor muscle and below all the 
 retractors, and hence it is hardly apposite to speak of them as lying "just below the skin" 
 (PL LXXXIII. fig. 29). 

The great peristomial haemocoel which is such a remarkable feature in the haemal 
 system of Nautilus communicates with the endochondral sinus by two channels which 
 lie between the dorsal protuberances {arcus cartilaginis) of the capito-pedal cartilage, 
 and the capsule of the pedal commissure (PL LXXXII. fig. 5). 

These are the most important fontanelles in the wall of the endochondral sinus, 
 and I propose to name them the capito-pedal venous orifices. I have seen a delicate 
 membranous fold on the inner wall of the endochondral sinus arching over the orifice 
 as if it were a valve to prevent the reflux of blood from the sinus to the haemocoel. 
 These are the capito-pedal valves, but I cannot certify as to their constant occurrence or 
 effective function though I deem it worth while to direct attention to them (PL LXXXIII. 
 % 14). 

The blood of Nautilus when freshly drawn exudes as a colourless fluid which quickly 
 turns bluish at the edges of the fluid mass after exposure to the air, and the bluish 
 tinge gradually advances to the centre. When this has taken place the blood appears 
 of a uniform pale blue colour, which subsequently becomes darker. The blood does not 
 coagulate of itself if left to stand. It contains numerous amoebocytes, which I have 
 sometimes observed both in living and stained preparations to be united together in 
 small groups after the manner of a plasmodium, possibly the result of successive 
 nuclear divisions (PL LXXXIII. figg. 1 and 1 a). The nucleus of the amoebocytes presents 
 a chromatic network, while the protoplasm appears as a spongy reticulum, containing 
 granules which are dissolved by acetic acid.
