their way to the exterior. I say virtually, because the coelomic aperture of the gonadic 
 pouch becomes, in the adult, so closely approximated to the coelomic orifice of the genital 

Fig. 10. N. pompilius, a . Genital arteries from below, r. rectum ; r.a. rectal artery. (N.B. — The rectal 
 arteries are very variable.) ant.p.a. anterior pallial artery; i.a. intestinal artery. (N.B. — This artery 
 usually passes to the right of the rectum, as shown in this figure ; but in one instance I have observed 
 it to pass down to the left of the rectum.) In-. v. branchial veins; post.p.a. posterior pallial artery; 
 p.s.g. pear-shaped gland with its artery; a. branches of the preceding artery and of the gonaducal artery, 
 which supply the superjacent ligaments; gen.a. genital artery and its branches; t. testis; t.o. aperture 
 of testis; p.v.o. orifice of communication between the pericardial and visceral portions of body-cavity, 
 through which the posterior pallial artery passes ; gmi.a. gonaducal artery ; v.s. vesicula seminalis. 
 (N.B. — This structure, the testis and pear-shaped gland are closely united to the heart by a ligament.)

 wall ventrally. [From Quart. J. Micr. Sc. Vol. 39, 1896.] 

duct, often actually penetrating into the latter though separate from it, that the ova 
 and spermatozoa are conveyed directly from the gonad to the duct. 

The main trunk of the median genital artery applies itself at first to the dorsal 
 side of the gonad, and extends round to the ventral side, giving off branches of greater 
 and of lesser importance. 

In the female the ultimate ramifications of the genital artery reach the surface of 
 the individual ova, the finer branches following but not confined to the reticulations 
 formed by the ridges of the follicle which project into the yolk (PI. LXXXIII. fig. 17). 
 The arteries which traverse the surface of the ova (PL LXXXIII. figg. 15 and 16), give
