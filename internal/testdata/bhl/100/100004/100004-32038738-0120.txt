the deep-lying branches anastomose with one another, thus forming a rete mirabile, while 
 the superficial branches appear not to form anastomoses. 

The germinal tract appears in the centre of the clear polar area of the fresh egg 
 as a faint whitish spot upon the ventral aspect of the ova as they lie within the ovary 
 (Text-fig. 13). The older ovarian ova are rendered somewhat shapeless by mutual pressure 
 with a roughly oval outline, and measure 15'5 mm. in length with a maximum breadth 
 of 115 mm. When the pressure is relieved by slitting open the ovary the ova round
