REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS AND GENITAL ARTERIES. 787 

The follicular meshes 1 are close-set in young ova, becoming more open during the 
 later stages of maturation and finally disappearing before oviposition. The nearly ripe 
 ova rupture with the utmost facility, and this may account for certain appearances 
 which have been recorded by Keferstein (1865) and Haller (1895). Keferstein described 
 a large albuminiparous gland (Eiweissdriise) in connection with the ovary, while according 
 to Haller's interpretation {op. cit. p. 199) the ovary is gorged with free yolk in addition 
 to the ova. As I have described above, the vitellus receives its nutriment solely 
 through the vessels of the follicular membrane, and the adventitious occurrence of free 
 yolk can only be ascribed to the rupture of mature or submature ova and is therefore 
 an artefact. 

In the female the short oviduct is closely adherent to the wall of the pericardium, 
 and its ostium abdominale lies behind and closely apposed to the pallio-visceral ligament. 

The male organs of generation have received fresh description on the part of 
 Mr Graham Kerr {op. cit. 1895, p. 671), to whose work I may refer the reader, and also 
 to the explanation of the figures 16 â€” 19 on my Plate LXXX. The male duct com- 
 prises an external and an internal portion. The latter projects boldly into the perivisceral 
 coelom, where it constitutes a vesicula seminalis of special composition, consisting of two 
 portions separated from one another by a diaphragm perforated near its mesial border 
 (PL LXXX. fig. 17). The ostium abdominale leads into the so-called accessor}/ gland, 
 which contains a complex lumen in which the spermatophore is fabricated, after which it 
 is passed through a very small aperture into the distal thin-walled portion of the seminal 
 vesicle which I will call the antrum. Beyond this point the duct penetrates the integu- 
 ment at the level of the pallial insertion by a narrow neck, and then dilates again to 
 form the so-called Needhamian sac which, as described by Van der Hoeven and by Kerr, 
 is partially subdivided into two cavities by an internal longitudinal septum. The septum 
 presents a free anterior border, in front of which the two halves of the cavity unite, and 
 over which the convoluted spermatophore rests as if upon a saddle (PL LXXX. fig. 18). 

The Needhamian sac is connected with the penis or terminal portion of the vas 
 deferens by a narrow neck surrounded by a sphincter. The penis itself is completely 
 divided by an internal longitudinal septum (described and figured by Kerr) so that it 
 contains two lumina, of which only the right is functional and lodges a spermatophore 
 at maturity, the left lumen ending blindly behind. 

I have no information concerning the manner in which the spermatophore is con- 
 veyed from the penis to its position in the fossa buccalis on the dorsal side of the 
 buccal cone, where it is held by the two most dorsally placed tentacles of the extra- 
 buccal series on each side (PL LXXVII. fig. 6). The transparent membrane or cyst in 
 which the spermatophore is always contained when it occupies this position is probably 
 secreted by some portion of the spadix. 

A mature male will have a spermatophore in the buccal fossa, another in the 
 right penial lumen (which is capable of great distension), and a third in the Need- 
 hamian sac. I do not know how the spermatophore is conveyed to the organ of 

1 The vascular folds of the inner layer of the follicle in the eggs of Sepia, noted in their superficial 
 aspects by Kolliker (1844), were first correctly interpreted and described in detail by Lankester, E. B.,
