792 MECHANISM OF RESPIRATION, ETC. 

seconde paire d'osphradies fusionnees [Willey] ne parait done pas soutenable." Dr Pel- 
 seneer makes no reference to my discovery of cilia 1 on the osphradia, otherwise he could 
 hardly have been so categorical as to the absence of a " region sensorielle." 

Continued investigation of the organs by finer methods than I had previously employed 
 has resulted in a confirmation of my interpretation (PI. LXXXIII. figg. 3 — 8). Even 
 without this confirmation I should have confidently adhered to the view expressed upon 
 grounds of topography, homodynamy, and ciliation of protected surfaces, and I gather that 
 this view has found favour with Dr Ludwig Plate 2 . 

The two pairs of osphradia may be distinguished as the interbranchial osphradia and 
 the submedian 3 osphradia respectively. The nerves which supply the former are not difficult 
 to find in section, and they have been figured in longitudinal section, i.e. in a section 
 parallel to the sagittal plane of the body, by Pelseneer {op. cit. PL xxi. fig. 180). 
 Pelseneer says that the papilla is not sensory, but only the subjacent pallial epithelium, 
 which receives " un grand nombre de ramifications d'un filet du nerf visceral-branchial." 
 I am able to confirm this statement, with the reservation that I find that the sensory 
 epithelium is not confined to the adjacent pallial surface, but extends round the angle of 
 insertion of the papilla (PL LXXXIII. fig. 7). 

In the case of the submedian osphradia the entire sensory epithelium is raised above 
 the level of the pallial surface while maintaining its character as a sensory groove, for 
 protective purposes no doubt, and so it comes about that the papillae are bilobate with 
 the sensory surface occupying the depression between the lobes in each case. The nerves 
 are best seen in sections taken parallel to the long axis of the body, and in such sections, 
 if properly prepared, the nerves may be found to penetrate through the basement-membrane 
 of the epidermis, and to spread out in the substance of the latter external to the base- 
 ment-membrane (PL LXXXIII. figg. 3 — 8). In this way a remarkable intra-epidermal 
 fibrillar plexus is brought into existence comparable for example with the intra-epidermal 
 terminations of the collar nerve-roots of the Enteropneusta 4 . What is more to the point 
 however is that an exactly similar intra-epidermal distribution of nerve-fibres in the osphradia 
 was described by Professor Spengel 5 in 1881 in the case of the primitive Lamellibranch 
 Area noae as well as in the Prosobranchs Haliotis and Trochus. The identity of distri- 
 bution of nerves in the osphradia of these Molluscs and of Nautilus may be said to be 
 demonstrative. 

According to Professor Spengel's account, the osphradium of Area resembles that of 
 Haliotis and of Trochus in that from the subjacent visceral ganglion numerous nerves arise 
 which enter the pigmented cylinder-epithelium and distribute themselves in this " so dass 
 wir dasselbe eigenthumliche Bild einen von starken Nervenfaserstrangen durchbrochenen 
 Epithelschicht vor uns haben wie dort."
