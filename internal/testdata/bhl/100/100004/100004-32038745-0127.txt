In the sensory epithelium of the osphradium of Nautilus I have seen cells with large 
 vesicular nucleus and darkly staining nucleolus, bearing a great resemblance to ganglion- 
 cells, and as I have found them in special relation with the nerves it seems very probable 
 that they are in fact peripheral ganglion-cells which have retained their primitive position 
 in the epidermis. They are best seen in tangential sections (PL LXXXIII. fig. 5).

I do not propose to dwell in detail upon these structures but to focus attention, for 
 the special purpose of this contribution, upon their topography. They are in fact inex- 
 tricably involved in the cephalopodium, and it is of the utmost importance to appreciate 
 their character of true cephalic sense-organs, whereas the ciliated ophthalmic tentacles 
 between which the eye is placed belong to the digital series. 

The eye of the Nautilus is a hollow hemisphere with an opaque pigmented cornea 
 perforated near the centre by a small aperture which is the pupil of the eye. The size 
 of the pinhole aperture is apparently capable of slight accommodation to the intensity of 
 light as I have seen it contract from a comparatively wide orifice, 2 - 5 mm. in diameter, 
 to a mere slit with apposed margins. Passing from the aperture to the ventral border 
 of the eye is a superficial pigmented groove somewhat resembling a choroid fissure or 
 raphe. Perhaps the development of the eye would throw some light upon the meaning 
 of this corneal raphe. 

The dorsal border of the eye is convex, but the rest of the margin is produced into 
 a thin limbus. Sometimes the corneal raphe commences a short distance below the pupil, 
 and the latter then appears as an isolated subcentral orifice. 

The eye faces outwards and cannot be moved in any other direction, the optic 
 peduncle being relatively immobile and capable only of slight protraction. The whole 
 aspect of the pedunculated eye somewhat resembles a sheath of a digital tentacle, and 
 Macdonald 1 actually asserted that there can be little doubt that the eye is a modified 
 tentacular sheath so fashioned as to become the seat of the special sense of vision. There 
 is perhaps no obvious inherent impossibility in this view, especially when regarded from 
 the standpoint of those who consider the digital tentacles to be special cephalic processes, 
 but I think it is important to dismiss the idea from the mind if it should ever present 
 itself. 

The eye of Nautilus was correctly described in respect of the pinhole aperture and 
 absence of dioptric apparatus by Owen (1832), and was subsequently examined in greater 
 detail by Hensen 2 (1865). Later still it was shown by Fraisse 3 to represent a primordial 
 type of eye which is also met with among the prosobranchiate Gastropods.

 London, vni. 1857, pp. 380 — 382. In this connection the fact may be mentioned that the optic peduncle 
 does not contain an axial nerve but separate nerves arise from the ganglion and pass through the eye-stalk to 
 the retina.
