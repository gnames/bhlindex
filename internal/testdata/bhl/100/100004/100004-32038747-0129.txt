THE MOLLTJSCAN FOOT. 795 

14. The Molluscan Foot. 

The foot of a Gastropod in its fullest development consists of a median sole 1 and 
 lateral appendages resembling metapleural folds. 

Huxley {Phil. Trans. 1853) divided the median portion of the foot into three portions, 
 propodium, mesopodium, metapodium, and called the lateral portion the epipodium. He 
 pointed out that of all Mollusca the Heteropod genus Atlanta possesses the best de- 
 veloped foot-proper, and has its parts best specialised and separated, the peculiar ciliated 
 sucker of this pelagic animal representing the mesopodium. 

Twenty years later Grenacher established a more fundamental subdivision of the 
 molluscan foot, retaining Huxley's epipodium, but viewing the entire median portion, 
 whether simple or differentiated into regions, as the protopodium*, which is not to be 
 confused with Huxley's propodium. 

Huxley's threefold subdivision of the protopodium still remains, though of subordinate 
 importance. An interesting example of it is afforded by the widely distributed species 
 Harpa, ventricosa, which I met with in the course of my travels. In this form the proto- 
 podium as a whole is capable of enormous extension so as to cover a relatively immense 
 superficial area, and the propodium is not only marked off from the rest of the foot by 
 a deep notch on each side, but Brock 3 has discovered that it possesses a special inner- 
 vation in the form of a very remarkable nervous reticulum. The mesopodium and meta- 
 podium of Harpa appear at a hasty glance not to be differentiated from one another as 
 there is no operculum, but closer inspection reveals a line of division between them, and 
 if the hinder or caudal end of the foot of the living animal be held firmly in the hand 
 the metapodium is cast off and remains in the hand while the animal falls to the ground. 
 This is an interesting example of muscular autotomy which was known and is referred to 
 in the Cambridge Natural History*, though the suggestion that it is effected by pressure 
 of the shell is erroneous (PI. LXXVI. fig. 3). 

The metapodium is cut off with a clean concave anterior surface, the posterior surface 
 of the mesopodium after the act of autotomy being convex. There is no effusion of blood. 

In a large species of Oliva which was common at Lifu, the protopodium is also 
 capable of great extension and will wrap itself round land-snails which are offered to 
 it as bait by the natives. 

The sides of the protopodium may be produced into great natatory folds as in 
 Aplysiidae. These lateral expansions of the protopodium are called parapodia (Pelseneer) 
 or pteropodia (von Jhering). Whether or not these are of the nature of true epipodia 
 is a question which does not concern us here. 

The epipodia are presented in their most typical development in certain proso- 
 branchiate genera, particularly in Haliotis, where they appear as a pair of deeply cleft
