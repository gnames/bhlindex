CHANGES OF FUNCTION, ORGANS AND TOPOGRAPHY. 797 

and substitution of organs are often found associated with more or less radical changes 
 of topography. 

One of the simplest examples of change of topography is to be met with in connection 
 with the position of the vent in Teleostean fishes, even in closely allied species. Instances 
 of this kind (as also in regard to the position of the pelvic fins of fishes) are exceedingly 
 numerous, but one of the most striking cases has been brought to my knowledge by 
 the courtesy of Mr G. A. Boulenger, F.R.S. In the Berycid genus Trachichthys the vent 
 is placed normally behind the series of abdominal scales, but in the closely allied genus 
 Paratrachichthys "as first observed by Giinther, the vent is far forward between the 
 ventral fins, in front of and not, as usual, behind the series of abdominal scales 1 ." 

I have selected this example of change of position of the vent, because the antero- 
 posterior axis of many animals corresponds more or less closely with what has been 
 called the oro-anal axis; it does so for example in the most primitive group of Mollusca, 
 the Amphineura (Chiton, Ckaetoderma, Neomenia). In consequence of this circumstance 
 the oro-anal axis has frequently been adopted as a fixed quantity, from which all bearings 
 must be taken. This may be true in special cases but it is clearly not true for the 
 Cephalopoda, at least this is my opinion of the matter, and I do not regard the antero- 
 posterior axis as synonymous with the oro-anal axis, although, as indicated above, I do 
 not forget that the two may coincide. 

In Nautilus and the Cephalopoda generally, in consequence of the flexure of the 
 intestine there is no longer any question of an oro-anal axis, but there is an antero- 
 posterior axis which it is our business to discover. 

The evidence of change of topography in Nautilus based upon anatomical conditions 
 is to be traced directly in the occurrence of conflicting axes, and in the existence of 
 recurrent nerves and arteries, and indirectly in the relations of the siphuncle. With 
 regard to the conflicting axes I am aware that these are visionary allies, since they 
 involve an imaginary interpretation of imaginary lines, but I have come to the conclusion 
 that what I have to say is not destitute of possible interest. 

The capito-pedal cartilage, the skeletal basis of the body of Nautilus, possesses 
 a distinct longitudinal axis of its own, and this axis does not coincide with the axis 
 of the cephalopodium, but describes an angle with it 2 (PI. LXXXI. figg. 1 and 2). 

It seems a possible view to take that the skeletal axis may represent the primitive 
 longitudinal axis of the uncoiled ancestor of Nautilus, that the tilting of the cephalopodial 
 axis is evidence of the concrescence and translocation of the primitive epipodium (the 
 tentacles of Nautilus being here regarded as epipodial tentacles), and finally that the 
 ventral pallial flexure of Nautilus has resulted in the formation of a visceral sac or 
 abdomen, which lies chiefly below the level of the primitive antero-posterior axis 
 (PL LXXXI. fig. 2). The lateral portions or cornua of the cartilage which determine 
 the direction of its main axis, occur along the angle of junction of the epipodium 
 (cephalopodium) and protopodium (funnel). 

The recurrent nerves of the posterior ophthalmic tentacles obviously indicate change
