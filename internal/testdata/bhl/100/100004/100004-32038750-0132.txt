798 FLEXURE AND ORIENTATION. 

of primitive topographical relations of parts, and perhaps a similar interpretation, although 
 not so certain, may be put upon the recurrent tentacular arteries (PI. LXXXII. fig. 5, 
 and PI. LXXXIII. fig. 28). 

With regard to the siphuncle, while it is certain that it has a physiological relation 
 to the air-chambers of the shell, its morphological nature is not so clear, but I think 
 it is a vestige, a vermiform appendix of Nautilus, the remnant of the primitive elongate 
 body which we must suppose the remote ancestor of Nautilus possessed. The gut and 
 the coelom have vanished from the siphuncle, and it is now reduced to the condition 
 of a vascular appendage, of vital importance to Nautilus in a physiological sense, but 
 a mere vestige morphologically. 

16. Flexure and Orientation. 

When squids are watched darting through the water with their pointed hinder 
 extremities turned in the direction of locomotion, the possibility of there being any 
 question concerning the orientation of the animal, i.e. concerning the true bearings of 
 the antero-posterior axis, never occurs to the observer. It is left to the refinements 
 of morphology to raise such a question, the discussion of which is only too apt to be 
 profitless and uninteresting. It is however impossible to neglect it in a work like the 
 present. 

Considered as Mollusca, the problem of the orientation of the body of Cephalopoda 
 depends upon and is created by two main features of organisation: â€” (1) the absence 
 of a plantar foot or platypodium; (2) the ventral position of the forwardly directed anal 
 aperture, which is associated with what Huxley (1853) called a neural flexure of the 
 intestine. 

The current notions regarding the orientation of a Cephalopod follow the lines laid 
 down by Huxley, according to whom the visceral sac represents a dorsal hump or 
 abdomen while the arms represent a ventral foot, so that the morphological position of 
 the animal is taken to be that which is sometimes assumed for example by Octopus 
 (cf. also my PL LXXVII. fig. 3) in which the arms are directed downwards, i.e. towards 
 the substratum and the visceral sac upwards. This is also the position which is usually 
 postulated for Nautilus on the tacit assumption that Nautilus in spite of its possession 
 of many primitive anatomical characters, affords no fresh clue in this regard. 

Another view with which I find myself, under certain reservations, in substantial 
 agreement, has been started in recent years by Dr B. Haller. I may quote the following 
 paragraph from this author's work on Nautilus (op. cit. 1895, p. 191): "Bezuglich der 
 Orientirung mochte ich vorausschicken, dass ich den Nautilus, wie iiberhaupt die Cephalo- 

poden (wie ich dies ausfuhrlicher schon mitgetheilt habe 1 ) aus einem chitonartigen 

Mollusken so hervorgegangen mir vorstelle, dass letzterer mit seinem hinteren Korper- 

abschnitt sich von hinten nach vorn und somit nach ventral warts bog, wodurch 

der After nach vorn zu gelangte Vorn ist der Kopf, hinten der Sipho."

 " Sipho" means of course the siphuncle.
