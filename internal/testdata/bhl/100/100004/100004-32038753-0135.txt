MORPHOLOGY OF THE TENTACLES OF NAUTILUS. 801 

are not furnished with suckers but with delicate filiform tentacula, but the fact is that 
 there is a median row of suckers as in Eledone, though the suckers are reduced, and 
 alternating with them are 26 pairs of cirri on each arm 1 . 

When we come to consider the broader interpretation of the arms of Cephalopoda 
 from a pan-molluscan standpoint we are again confronted with two rival theories which 
 may be defined as follows: — 

1. Pedal Theory of Huxley 2 (1853), according to which the arms of Cephalopoda are 
 derivatives of the primitive molluscan foot. 

2. Cephalic Theory of Leuckart (1848) and von Jhering (1877), according to which 
 they are special appendages and derivatives of the primitive head. 

The most complete exposition of the Pedal Theory is contained in the memoir by 
 Pelseneer 3 , while the Cephalic Theory has been strongly advocated by Grobben 4 , and more 
 recently by Kerr 5 . 

Huxley, as is well known, regarded the arms of Cephalopoda as representing the 
 protopodium and the funnel the epipodium 6 . "The formation of an abdomen," he said, 
 " with a peculiar development of the margins of the foot into elongated processes, and 
 with cohesion of the posterior epipodial lobes, gives us the Cephalopodan subtype." 
 From this quotation it is clear that Huxley considered the arms as marginal appendages, 
 which is in itself an important conclusion. His reason for identifying them with the 
 protopodium may possibly be looked for in the bionomical fact that Octopus, for example, 
 actually does crawl about from place to place by means of its arms, although it can 
 swim vigorously on occasion. The identification of the funnel with the epipodium may 
 be due to the fact of the cleft funnel of Nautilus, the flaps of which may be likened 
 to pteropodial lobes. 

Grenacher (Zeitschr. wiss. Zool., Bd. 24, 1874) homologised the arms with the velum 
 of Gastropod embryos, but adopted Huxley's interpretation of the funnel on account of 
 the development of the latter from paired primordia. 

The special reasons for the view that the funnel is an epipodial derivative are there- 
 fore based upon facts of bionomics, comparative anatomy, and embryology, but I believe 
 that these are facts which mask the truth in this particular case. The epipodium as 
 the name implies lies dorsad of the protopodium, while the siphonopodium of Cephalopods 
 is ventral in position, and although great allowances may be made for changes of topo-
