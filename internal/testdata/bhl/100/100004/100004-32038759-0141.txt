With regard to the relationship of Nautilus to the other Cephalopoda opinions will 
 always differ as to details, but the main issues are clearly defined. In respect that it 
 is a Cephalopod, the external shell of Nautilus is probably primitive as compared with 
 the internal shell of Spirula and the other Dibranchs 1 . 

Upon the primitive characters of the digestive system, the paired liver, structure 
 of pyloric coecum, etc., Haller (1895) may be consulted. Brock tabulated upwards of 
 a dozen different combinations and correlations of oviducts and nidamental glands, and 
 pointed out that the slit-like orifices of the renal sacs of Nautilus are of primitive 
 significance, inasmuch as this kind of renal orifice is again met with in all Oigopsid 
 cuttle-fishes, and in the more primitive forms of the other subdivisions, whereas in the 
 higher Myopsidae and Octopoda a fleshy renal papilla has developed 2 . He thinks that 
 the Octopoda are the most highly specialised Cephalopoda (as illustrated in the structure 
 of the central nervous system, the eye which can be closed by eyelids, the atrophy of
