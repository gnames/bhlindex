The specimen of Nautilus which was dissected by Owen contained fragments of 
 triturated Crustacea in its stomach and crop, and this would seem to constitute its staple 
 food-supply since prawns and crabs abound on the nautiline terrains. 

As mentioned in a previous chapter any kind of animal bait will tempt Nautilus, 
 and after a full meal the crop is found to be gorged to repletion. 

In order to be in a position to form a just estimate of the value of the various 
 accounts and legends concerning the habits of Nautilus several facts require special 
 consideration. In the first place Owen drew attention to the circumstance that whereas 
 two kinds of Nautili are referred to by Aristotle, only one kind is mentioned by Pliny. 
 In his Thesaurus Gonchyliorum, Sowerby (1855) took care to note particularly that 
 the Pearly Nautilus is not the Nautilus of Pliny, which is Argonauta or the Paper 
 Nautilus, so-called on account of the thin, white, delicate structure of its peculiar shell. 

No doubt many of the fantastic ideas concerning our Nautilus, more especially such 
 as possess the popular mind, owe their origin to a simple confusion between the Pearly 
 or, as we may picturesquely term it, Aristotle's Nautilus and the Paper or Pliny's Nautilus. 
 That this is the case is indicated in a convincing manner by the identity of some of 
 the myths which have been related in connection with both species 1 . 

It is also desirable to remember that Nautilus obviously draws its supplies of food 
 from the bottom of the sea, it is a ground-feeder, while Argonauta, according to available 
 evidence, is a pelagic feeder. 

When Nautilus has been taken, as a great rarity, at the surface of the sea, it has 
 generally, if not always, been found that the specimen was in a more or less moribund 
 condition. At the same time, with its known faculty for swimming and migration in 
 some places into quite shallow water a few fathoms only in depth, it is quite conceivable 
 that an individual specimen might occasionally wander away from its home and arrive 
 at the surface, but there is no evidence that this is a regular practice. 

In his " Notes by a Naturalist on H.M.S. Challenger," Moseley also gives it as his 
 opinion that " it is probably a mistake to suppose that it ever comes to the surface 
 voluntarily to swim about." 

Moreover only single individuals have ever been seen at the surface and then in the 
 daytime 2 , but the evidence of the traps goes to show that Nautilus is a gregarious 
 animal and nocturnal in its habits. It repairs in shoals at night to its shrimping 
 grounds, but I suspect that it breeds in deep water or in inaccessible submarine gullies.
