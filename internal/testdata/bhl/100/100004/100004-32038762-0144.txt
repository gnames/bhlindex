VARIATION AND REGENERATION. 

like the latter they are laid singly. The pectinate ridges are more prominent on the 
 outer capsule of the egg of N. pompilius, often having a frill-like appearance and pro- 
 jecting freely for a short distance at their anterior ends. 

The capsules of the egg are often deficient in some respects, sometimes exposing 
 the vitellus through the gaping sutures of the 
 inner capsule (PI. LXXXIII. fig. 18), and in 
 the case of iV. macromphalus at Lifu I frequently 
 found fully formed capsules without any con- 
 tents, the latter not having escaped, but never 
 having been present. This also must I think 
 have been due to a derangement of the normal 
 reflexes, the result of captivity. The pectinate 
 ridges of the outer capsule of the egg seem 
 to correspond with the annulations of the infra- 
 buccal tentacles (PI. LXXIX. figg. 2 a and 6 a). 

For further details concerning the egg- 
 capsules I may refer to the explanation of 
 figures 19â€”23 on Plate LXXXIII.

21. Variation and Regeneration. 

Although the old idea of the fixity of species has long been superseded, the fixity 
 of certain types seems to be a fact not open to question. Fixity of type is the ex- 
 pression of a completed evolution, and this is what is meant when a particular type 
 is said to be highly specialised in a given direction. Fixed types are very likely the 
 same as persistent types, and they have some properties in common amongst which are 
 their limited range of variation and their defective power of regeneration. 

The variation in the number and disposition of the digital tentacles of Nautilus 
 is a negligible quantity, but the spadix exhibits ambidextral variation, being now on 
 the left side of the cephalopodium and now on the right. A variation of a similar 
 nature affects the origin of the main siphuncular artery, which sometimes arises as a 
 branch of the left division of the posterior pallial artery and sometimes from the right 
 division. The constitution of the spadix shows hardly any appreciable variation. 

In one instance only did I meet with a situs inversus of the reproductive apparatus, 
 and this was the case with a male in which the vas deferens was developed on the 
 left side instead of on the right, with the pyriform gland on the right instead of the 
 left side (PL LXXVIII. fig. 2). 

More than once or twice I found males in which the hood had been so bitten away 
 that the spermatophore lodged in the buccal recess was exposed to view. Sometimes 
 the front part of the hood is eaten away, at other times a piece is bitten out of 
 the middle of the hood just over the spermatophore (PI. LXXVII. figg. 5 and 6). 

At first I attributed these injuries to the attacks of voracious fishes, but it is not 
 impossible that they are the results of nuptial combats. Without in any way relaxing
