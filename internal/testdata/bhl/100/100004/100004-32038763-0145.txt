its hold upon the shell, Nautilus can project its body from the shell with a darting 
 movement and protrude the buccal cone so as to seize hold of its food. I have seen 
 it seize a prawn between its jaws in this way, and it would not be a difficult matter 
 for a female to bite into the hood of a male. However this may be, the point to 
 which I desire to draw attention is that the wounds heal up at the edges, but the 
 parts are not regenerated.

Amphioxus is another example of a relatively fixed type which presents little range 
 of variation, and less power of regeneration. Perhaps Chiton is another. 

Sometimes the sheaths of the tentacles become perforated at some part of their 
 length, and the tentacle may then issue from the adventitious orifice instead of from 
 the apical orifice. 

Not seldom among the shells of N. pompilius which are washed upon the reefs 
 of New Guinea specimens are found in which the umbilicus is incompletely closed 1 .
