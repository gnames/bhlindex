814 DESCRIPTION OF PLATES. 

Between the bases of the cephalic tentacles occurs a free flap of the integument 
 resembling a nuchal membrane (Fig. 5). x 3. 

JST.B. â€” No portion of the mantle appears in either figure. 

Fig. 6. N. pompilius juv. Dorsal view of a portion of the mantle-region of the same 
 specimen as PI. LXXVII. fig. 4. 

d.p.i. The line of insertion of the dorsal lobe of the mantle into the body-wall. 

s.m. Shell-muscle. 

an. Annulus. 

s.a. Septal aponeurosis. 

The succeeding figures, unless otherwise stated, relate indifferently to N. pompilius and 

N. niacromphalus. 

Fig. 7. Piece of the posterior region of the mantle viewed from the inner or coelomic 
 surface, to illustrate the connections of the siphuncle. The piece comprises the entire dorso- 
 ventral extent of the insertion of the geni to intestinal ligament into the hinder wall of the 
 perivisceral coelom. 

g.l. Genito-intestinal ligament (cut across). 

p.a. Posterior pallial artery. 

p.v. Posterior pallial vein. 

s.a. Siphuncular artery (sinistral). 

r.s. Radical sinus of the siphuncle (pallio-siphonal sinus). 

s. Siphuncle. 

Fig. 8. Similar piece from another specimen. The posterior pallial vein and pallio-siphonal 
 sinus have been laid open and a bristle passed into the siphuncular vein (axial cavity of 
 siphuncle). The siphuncular artery (dextral) is seen in the floor of the pallio-siphonal sinus. 

Fig. 9. Portion of a bisected shell of iV. pompilius to illustrate the relation between 
 the growth-lines of the shell (shell-lines), the concentric muscle-lines and the posterior border 
 of the actual muscle-scar and annulus. An asterisk is placed opposite to the linea limitans 
 of the muscular impression. The last-formed septum is thin and fragile, thickening not having 
 yet taken place. 

PLATE LXXVII. 

Fig. 1. Frontal view of the fundus of the animal-chamber of a shell of N. pompilius. 

1. Annular impression. 

2. Septal suture or impression of the septal aponeurosis of the mantle. 

3. Muscle-scar. 

4. Border of the nacreous layer deposited by the dorsal lobe of the mantle over the 
 black varnish which covers the normally banded periostracum of the anf cactus of the shell. 

Fig. i. Specimen, of female N. macromphalus with spermatophore (sp.) protruding from 
 the oral sheath. 

Fig. 3. N. macromphalus adhering to the substratum in a vertical position by means 
 of its tentacles. More usually its position, when attached to any surface, is more or less 
 horizontal, with the adhesive tentacles spreading about in all directions.
