 PL LXXXII. fig. 7). 

si. Siphuncle. 

Figg. 21 and 22. Details of preceding, to elucidate the relations of the transverse and 
 longitudinal loops of the intestine. Fig. 21 shows a portion of the intestine and right liver

b.d. Bile-duct, above or behind which the intestine passes. 

Fig. 23. Pallio-visceral region of another specimen older than that of fig. 20, but showing 
 the same primary relations of the mesentery. 

y. Pyriform gland. 

st. Stomach traversed in this specimen by constrictions. 

p.a. Posterior pallial artery. 

d.i. and a.i. Intestine.

PLATE LXXXI. 

Fig. 1. N. pompilius. Dissection of a relaxed specimen from the right side, showing 
 the relation of the capito-pedal cartilage to the siphonopodium and to the cephalopodium.

 portion forming part of the hood and a posterior portion ; the third sheath (3) is wedged 
 in between 2 and 4, only its anterior end being visible in this view. 

Fig. 2. Diagram of Nautilus to illustrate the theory of orientation. The dotted line
