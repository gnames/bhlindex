INTRODUCTION 

The general scarcity of live bait in the central Pacific limits live-bait 
 fishing for the available stocks of surface tuna and makes it desirable to develop 
 some alternate method of capture. Attempts to gill net skipjack in the Hawaiian 
 Islands where there is a commercial live-bait fishery have met with little success 
 (Matsumoto 1953). Purse-seine fishing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the 
 California landings of tuna (Godsil 1949, page 17), was tried intensively by the 
 Pacific Oceanic Fishery Investigations of the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service dur- 
 ing the period April 12, 1950, to September 15, 1951. These trials centered around 
 the Phoenix, Line, and Hawaiian Islands (fig. 1, table 1) where surface schools of 
 tuna are commonly found. 

DESCRIPTION OF GEAR 

The John R. Manning, a West Coast-type purse seiner, was used for all purse 
 seining (fig. 2). The vessel's essential characteristics are: 

Length - 86 feet 6 inches 
 Depth - 12 feet 8 inches 
 Displacement - 237 tons 

Beam - 22 feet 6 inches 

Cruising speed - 7-3/4 knots 

Three purse seines were used during the John R . Manning ' s operations. Seine 
 No. 1, a standard West Coast tuna net made of cotton thread in San Diego, Calif., 
 was 360 fathoms long with a lead line measuring 340 fathoms. It had a depth of 
 approximately 31 fathoms. The main body consisted of five strips of No. 48-thread 
 4^-inch mesh, each 100 meshes deep. The lead-line strip was No. 84-thread 7-inch 
 mesh, 50 meshes deep, and the selvage strip was No. 84-thread 4^-inch mesh, 20
