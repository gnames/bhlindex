modified by removing one strip of No. 48-thread 45-inch mesh cotton adjoining the 
 7-inch heavy mesh lead-line strip and substituting two strips, each 100 meshes 
 deep, of No. 40/16 cabled linen thread, 
 4-5-inch mesh. The theoretical depth of 
 this seine was thereby increased to ap- 
 proximately 36 fathoms. However, drop 
 tests indicated that the modified net 
 reached a maximum depth of only 30 fath- 
 oms so the weight on the lead line was 
 increased to 10| pounds or 42 4-ounce 
 leads per fathom,, The first 50 fathoms 
 of the seine to leave the vessel — the 
 bow end of the net — had 44 leads per 
 fathom for faster sinking This seine 
 was used on cruises 5 through 7-A during 
 the period January 1951 through June 1951.

The third and final seine to be used was constructed of boiled linen netting 
 (fig. 3). It was 400 fathoms long with a maximum fishing depth of 39 fathoms (46.7 
 fathoms stretched mesh). The lead line measured 381 fathoms. The main body of 
 this seine was 7 strips, each 100 meshes deep, of No. 40/16 cabled linen thread 
 45-inch meshc The lead-line strip, 50 meshes deep, was made of No. 6.5/12 cabled 
 linen thread 7-inch mesh. The selvage strip was No. 60 medium-lay cotton thread 
 4g-inch mesh, 8 meshes deep. The web was hung in the ratio of 10 fathoms of cork
