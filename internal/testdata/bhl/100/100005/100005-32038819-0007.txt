line to 9s fathoms of lead line, with the exception of the stern 10 fathoms of 
 the seine which were hung in a 10:10 ratio. Nine extra meshes per 10 fathoms of 
 netting were allowed as slack on the cork line. 

The cork line of the linen seine contained 22 6-inch diameter cork per fathom 
 in the main body of the net. At each extremity of the seine there were 14 corks 
 per fathom for a distance of 30 fathoms. The lead line was weighted with 17 8- 
 ounce leads per fathom throughout. For ten fathoms on each end, the lead line 
 was reinforced with 21-thread manila rope. The taper on the towing end of the 
 linen seine was made in the form of a 45° angle and differed from that in the cot- 
 ton seine which was in the form of a 25° angle. The breast-line hanging was es- 
 sentially the same as for the cotton seine. This linen seinei/ was fished only 
 during the final stages of the purse-seine program in the Hawaiian Islands area 
 (July-August 1951). 

PURSE- SEINING RESULTS IN THE CENTRAL PACIFIC 

PHOENIX ISLANDS : The John R. Manning visited the Phoenix Islands on two oc- 
 casions. During the first period, July 24 to September 1, 1950 (Cruise 3) > parts 
 of 16 days were devoted to scouting for tuna. This activity centered around the 
 islands of Canton, Birnie, Sidney, Phoenix, Enderbury, McKean, Gardner, and Hull, 
 and Carondelet Reef. During the 64 hours of actual scouting, 11 schools of tuna 
 were sighted — 4 of shipjack, 2 of yellowfin, and 5 unidentified. These schools 
 either outran the vessel or were too close to coral reefs to permit setting the 
 net without considerable risk. The greatest handicap during this period was the 
 rough sea. Beaufort forced/ 5 or stronger winds prevailed during 18 of the 40 
 days and force 4 during 4 of the 40 days. This either precluded operations en- 
 tirely or Limited them to the lees of the islands » 

In the second visit to the Phoenix Islands, January 24 to February 5, 1951 
 (Cruise 5), scouting was carried out at Canton, Enderbury, Phoenix, Sidney, and 
 Hull Islands. In these 13 days, 29 hours of 9 days were devoted to searching for 
 tuna. Four schools of unidentified tuna were sighted, but they could not be set 
 on. Three practice hauls «rere made, however, during this period. Force 4 and 
 force 5 winds prevailed through the period, limiting operations to the lees of the 
 islands. 

It appears that the prevailing high winds limit purse seining in the Phoenix 
 group to the lees of the islands. Here schools of tuna are relatively scarce and 
 frequently too close to the reefs for sets to be made without great hazard. 

LINE ISLANDS : The purse-seining potential of the Line Islands was surveyed 
 on five separate occasions: April 22 to June 7, 1950; September 2 to 19, 1950; 
 November 1 to December 1, 1950; February 11 to 23, and April 5 to May 12, 1951. 

From April 22 to June 7, 1950 (Cruise 2), waters adjoining the following is- 
 lands were investigated: Kingman Reef, Palmyra, Washington, and Fanning. During 
 this 47-day period, parts of 38 days — a total of 310 hours — were devoted to actual 
 scouting for tuna. Twenty-eight schools of tuna were sighted, including 12 of 
 yellowfin, 8 of skipjack, 5 unidentified, and 3 of mixed species. Two sets were 
 made. On May 8, 1950» a set on a sc hool of yellowfin off Fanning Island was un- 
 i/the linen seine was difficult to use because skipjack had a tendency to catch on the rough 

LINEN THREAD (FIG. a) , NECESSITATING INDIVIDUAL HANDLING OF A LARGE PORTION OF THE CATCH. 
 SOME OF THE SKIPJACK RAISED WITH THE NET CREATED A WORKING HAZARD WHEN THEY FELL ON DECK, 
 AND IN SO DOING FREQUENTLY BROKE THE RELATIVELY SMALL-DIAMETER LINEN TWINE. THESE PROBLEMS 
 MIGHT HAVE BEEN LESS SERIOUS IF THE LINEN HAD BEEN TARRED, MATTING DOWN THE LOOSE FIBERS.
