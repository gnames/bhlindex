successful. The second set was made off Christmas Island on May 13, 1950, on a 
 mixed school of yellowfin and skipjack and was also unsuccessful, although fish 
 were in the net when pursing began. 

Throughout this period (April 22-June 7, 1950) the weather was generally fa- 
 vorable. No winds over force 4 were encountered. Chiefly force 3 and lesser 

r winds prevailed with force 4 winds en- 
 1\ countered only for five days. 

During the period September 2-19, 
 1950 (Cruise 3), the following islands 
 were scouted: Jarvis, Christmas, Pal- 
 myra, and Kingman Reef. Scouting for 
 tuna was done during 85 hours of 9 
 days. Sighted were 8 schools of yel- 
 lowfin and 6 schools of unidentified 
 tuna. One set was made off Christmas 
 Island on September 9 on "breezing" 
 tuna, but no fish were captured. An- 
 other set was made on September 10 
 under bird signs, and again no fish 
 were taken. Sets were also made on 
 September 11 and on September 12 off 
 Christmas Island. Both of these were 
 on yellowfin tuna and on both sets 
 fish were still inside the net when 
 pursing commenced, but they apparently 
 sounded out of the net. 

During this 18-day period, Beau- 
 fort force 5 winds prevailed on 4 days, 
 force 4 on 5 days, and force 3 or less 
 prevailed for the balance. 

The John R. Manning scouted areas 
 near Kingman Reef, Christmas, Fanning^ 
 Washington, and Palmyra islands from 
 November 1 to December 1, 1950 (Cruise 
 4) . During 226 hours of actual scout- 
 ing distributed over 18 days, 9 schools 
 of yellowfin tuna, 7 schools of skip- 
 jack, and 6 schools of unidentified 
 tuna were sighted. Although most of 
 these schools were either too close to 
 the reefs or too elusive to permit a 
 set, one unsuccessful attempt was made 
 During the set the fish sounded and

escaped after pursing began. Four practice sets were made in the area. 

High winds were a considerable handicap largely limiting operations to the 
 lees of the islands. For 18 days force 5 or stronger winds prevailed; force 4 
 winds blew on 4 days; and lesser winds blew for 9 days. 

The waters off the islands of Jarvis, Christmas, Fanning, Washington, Palmyra, 
 and Kingman Reef were prospected February 11 to 23, 1951 (Cruise 5). During 104 
 hours of actual scouting, only 1 school of yellowfin, 2 of skipjack, and 2 of mixed 
 yellowfin and skipjack were seen. Only one was large, and it could not be set on
