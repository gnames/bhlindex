because of the proximity of the Fanning Island reef. The other schools were very 
 small and outran the vessel. Four sets were made on this cruise, two for practice 
 and two on milkfish ( Chanos chanos ) . The latter two were unsuccessful. 

Fdr 6 days of the period, force 5 winds prevailed, for 5 days force 4, and 
 for only 2 days force 3« These winds, of course, limited operations to the lees 
 of the islands. 

The final attempt at purse seining in the Line Islands (Cruise 6) was made 
 April 5 to May 12, 1951, when waters in the vicinity of Kingman Reef, Palmyra, 
 Fanning, Christmas, and Washington islands were explored. Parts of 28 days — 208 
 hours — were devoted to scouting for fish. Schools sighted were 2 of yellowfin, 
 2 of skipjack, and 2 of unidentified tuna. Five practice sets were made — 2 on 
 visible fish, 1 under bird signs, 1 on porpoises, and 1 on fathometer indications. 
 No fish were taken, but fish were still in the net as pursing began on the May 1 
 set on yellowfin off Christmas Island and the May 5 set on unidentified tuna. 
 Evidently these fish sounded. 

During this survey, force 5 or stronger winds blew on 19 days, force 4 winds 
 blew on 7 days, and lesser winds blew on 13 days. 

In summary, 5 trips distributed over one 12-month period were made to these 
 islands (fig. l) . During these trips, 933 hours were devoted to scouting fortuna. 
 Strong winds frequently limited operations to the small lees of the individual 
 islands. Sighted were 75 schools of tuna, but either because of the wildness of 
 the fish or the proximity of reefs, it was possible to set on only 8 of them. On 
 six of these sets fish were in the circle as pursing began, but sounded out before 
 pursing was completed. Tuna purse seining in the Line Islands, therefore, appears 
 to be a problematical venture. 

CONVENTIONAL PURSE SEINING IN THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS ; The initial survey of 
 the Hawaiian Islands area was undertaken June 5 to June 18, 1951. During 122 hours 
 of actual scouting, 6 schools of skipjack were located, but because of their speed 
 and erratic behavior the John R_. Manning was able to approach only one and this 
 was not set on. 

More extensive trials were made from July 21 to August 15, 1951. During this 
 and subsequent cruises the linen seine was substituted for the cotton net used 
 previously. In order to insure maximum efficiency in handling the gear, the cap- 
 tain, a skilled California purse-seine fisherman, was engaged for this and the 
 subsequent tests. A total of 213 hours distributed over 23 days was devoted to 
 scouting for tuna. This activity occurred in the lees of Hawaii, Maui, Lanai, 
 Oahu, and Kauai, with the exception of August 14-15 when weather conditions per- 
 mitted scouting off the windward (NE.) side of Oahu. Sixty schools of tuna were 
 sighted on this cruise, and with the exception of 4 schools of yellowfin sighted 

off the lee of Hawaii, all were identified 
 as skipjack. The localities of these schools 
 are given in table 2.

The behavior of the schools was very 
 erratic so that even though a serious attempt 
 was made to set on 57 of them, it was possi- 
 ble to "shoot" the net on only 7 schools — 1 
 of yellowfin tuna and 6 of skipjack. Some 
 of the 57 schools sounded on approach, some 
 changed course so frequently it was impossi-
