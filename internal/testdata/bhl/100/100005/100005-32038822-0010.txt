schools scattered on approach, and some merely outran the vessel. The most per-

COMBINED PURSE-SEINE AND LIVE-BAIT OPERATION OFF THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS ; A 
 cruise to test the feasibility of seining Hawaiian tuna in cooperation with a 
 live-bait boat was made August 21 to September 8, 1951. A small Honolulu sampan, 
 the Moral, was engaged as a chum boat. Seven days were devoted to catching bait, 
 6 to fishing for tuna, and 5 to travel between baiting and fishing localities. 

The fishing procedure followed a regular pattern. After locating a school, 
 the Momi attempted to concentrate the fish with chum. If this was successful, her 

speed was reduced 
 so that a set could 
 be made by the 
 John R. Manning . 
 (According to Ha- 
 waiian fishermen 
 the local skipjack 
 will disperse de- 
 spite the throw- 
 ing of chum unless 
 a speed of approx- 
 imately 2 knots is 
 maintained.) When 
 the captain of the 
 of the Momi con- 
 sidered that the school was concentrated and holding, he signalled the John R. 
 Manning to set. The set was started at the earliest moment the vessel could ma- 
 neuver into a proper downwind position from the Momi . During the course of the 
 set the Momi cruised in a circle inside the seine, chumming continuously. When 
 the net was pursed, the Momi ceased chumming, gunned her engine, then cut it off 
 and coasted over the cork line. The rest of the operation constituted a normal 
 purse. Eleven schools of skipjack were located during the fishing. One of these 
 was abandoned because of rough seas, 3 did not respond to the chum, and 7 were 
 set on.

The results of the 7 sets are given in table 4. The amounts of bait shown 
 in the table are the actual catches less the estimated amounts lost between capture 
 and utilization. Losses were inordinately high, chiefly because time could not 
 be spared to rest the bait after capture. It is evident from table 4 that the 
 chumming rate varied considerably. This came about because the chief aim was to 
 investigate the general method, not to work out minimum chumming rates, and conse- 
 quently no effort was made to economize on bait. Also there was a distinct tend- 
 ency on the part of the fishermen to chum more heavily when ample bait was in the 
 wells . 

The catch for the successful sets, with the exception of the fourth and sixth, 
 represents the entire school. On the fourth the Momi appeared to have held only 
 part of the school. The school for the sixth set was completely chummed, but a 
 large segment of the school disengaged and sounded before the net could be pursed. 
 A number of controllable factors contributed to this: (l) there was too long a 
 period between chumming the school and pursing the net; (2) too much tow line was 
 let out, thus increasing the pursing time; (3) the wilder iao ( Pranesus insularum ) 
 were used as chum instead of the nehu ( Stolephorus purpureus ) normally used. This 
 latter species, in contrast to the iao, remains very close to the boat after being 
 thrown in the water.
