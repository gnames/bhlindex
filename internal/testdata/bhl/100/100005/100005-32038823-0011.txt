COMMERCIAL FISHERIES REVIEW 

It appears that by skillful handling of both the chum boat and purse seiner 
 entire schools of Hawaiian skipjack can be captured. With our present information 
 it is not possible to state whether this type of fishing is economically feasible.

1/THE POUNDAGE OF THE CATCH ON THE JOHN R. MANNING AND THE MOMI WAS ESTIMATED BY MULTIPLYING THE NUMBER OF 
 FTSH BY THE MEAN WEIGHT OF THE INDIVIDUAL SKIPJACK, ACCURATE COUNTS WERE NOT OBTAINED FOR THE MOMI CATCH 
 ON SETS 1, 2, AND 4. NOR FOR THE JOHN Râ€ž MANNING ON SET 6. THE MOMI CATCH WAS MADE BY FISHERMEN WITH JIGS 
 WHILE CHUMMING THE SCHOOL.

4/lN 1948 THE HAWAIIAN FLEET AVERAGED 14 BUCKETS OF BAIT PER TON OF FISH LANDED. 

In order for the operation to be profitable, the cost of producing fish in terms 
 of capital outlay, personnel, and consumption of bait must be no higher than that 
 experienced by the present commercial fleet. The POFI operation, being an exper- 
 imental one, was expensive, but some economies appear to be possible. The most 
 practical methods are listed below. 

1. Design netting gear that can be used in rough seas in order to overcome 
 the present restriction to the lees of the islands. 

2. Design a small chum boat that can be carried and launched by the seiner 
 when a school is sighted. Bait reserves could be carried on the seiner. 

3. Economize on bait by: 

a. Reducing chumming rate to a minimum 

b. Reducing the chumming period by: 

(1) determining how long before the net is pursed chumming can cease; 

(2) reducing preset chumming to a minimum by skillful boat handling; 

(3) using the smallest possible net and fast winches to reduce purs- 

ing time (this might also reduce the capital outlay) . 

4. Use boat time more efficiently by: 

a. Having bait boat locate a ^second school while the net boat is complet- 

ing a set. 

b. Providing a supply of bait so that the equipment is not held up when 

catching bait. 

FACTORS AFFECTING THE SUCCESS OF PURSE SEINING 

WEATHER : As already intimated, conventional purse seining in the central 
 Pacific is severely handicapDed by prevailing high winds. This is indicated by 
 the prevalence of Beaufort force 4 (11 to 16 knots) or higher winds in the various 
 island areas (table 5). According to Bigelow and Edmondson (1947), 5- to 8-foot
