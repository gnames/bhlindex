seas are associated with force 4 winds, and 5-foot seas in our experience are 
 near the maximum for effective use of conventional purse-seine gear. These wind 
 conditions are compared (table 5) with those experienced off Cape San Lucas,Baja 
 California, where force 4 winds are rarely experienced. 

Strong winds particularly handicap purse-seine operations in the Hawaiian 
 Islands area as they are most prevalent during the period when tuna are most a- 

bundant (May to October) . Off 
 the Line and Phoenix Islands winds 
 are less severe, but nevertheless 
 preclude any systematic effort to 
 operate a purse seine. 

Because of the generally un- 
 favorable sea and weather condi- 
 tions of the central Pacific, purse 
 seining must generally be carried 
 on in the lees of the islands. 
 With the exception of the Island 
 of Hawaii, the lees are quite small, 
 thus greatly limiting operations. 

CLARITY OF THE WATER ; Clar- 
 ity of the water is a factor that 
 affects the efficiency of many 
 types of nets, e.g., gill nets. Generally, as the water becomes clearer the nets 
 become less efficient. Increased clarity of the water might affect a purse seine 
 by allowing the tuna to see it at a considerable distance, stimulating them to 
 dive under the net. 

Purse seines are constructed so that they belly somewhat when laid in the 
 water. As soon as pursing is started this is accentuated so that very early in 
 the set a shelf of webbing is formed under the vertical sections of the net. If 
 the water were turbid so that a fish did not sight the net until it was within 10 
 feet of the web, a 10- or 15-foot shelf might stop it from sounding if it became 
 panicky and dashed about at random after finding its downward path blocked. If it 
 perceived the net at 100 feet, a shelf extending at least 100 feet into the center 
 of the net would be needed to turn back the fish. Further, in very clear water a 
 fish sounding and striking a shelf of netting might actually perceive the edge of 
 the shelf and swim towards it.

There are few data available on the relative turbidity of the Central Pacific 
 and West Coast of North America, but according to Jerlof (1951) surface transmis- 
 sion of blue light was 76 percent per meter south of the Galapagos Islands and 92 
 percent per meter south of the Hawaiian Islands. This unit is not particularly 
 meaningful for purposes of comparison because light intensity decreases logarith- 
 mically with distance. More useful is the extinction coefficient (Sverdrup et al 
 1949, p. 82), which is a linear measure of water clarity. The extinction coeffi- 
 cient for Jerlof s Galapagos station is 0.0833, and for the Hawaiian station 
 0.2754. In other words, the water south of the Galapogos is about 3.3 times as 
 turbid as water south of the Hawaiian Islands. Therefore, a fish could theoreti- 
 cally see a net 3-1/3 times as far in Hawaiian waters. 

On the other hand, tuna may not become alarmed and sound wildly on sighting 
 a net. They may simply swim to it and follow it down to the lead line like sheep 
 following a fence. In this event water clarity would have little effect on the 
 efficiency of a purse seine because, unless the fish were motionless, the difference
