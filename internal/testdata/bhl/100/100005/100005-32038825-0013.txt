in time (during which pursing might be proceeding) between the perceiving of the 
 net at 100 feet and at 30 feet would be inconsequential. 

Skipjack tuna are not inherently "afraid" of a boat or net, for schools of 
 skipjack have been observed swimming close alongside our vessels. Whether this 
 occurs in those rare instances when the course of the vessel and the course of 
 the school coincide, or is the result of a definite attraction, has not been de- 
 termined. Further, when skipjack were pursuing the live-bait chum, they were ob- 
 served swimming or foraging within a foot or two of the net without showing alarm. 
 They would even swim by the unclosed gap in the purse seine and within 15 feet of 
 the boat with its throbbing machinery without showing alarm or attempting to escape. 

These observations lead to the conclusion that tuna leave a purse seine not 
 because of inherent fear of foreign bodies in the water, but rather because on 
 encountering a wall of netting in their course they simply avoid the obstacle by 
 diving under it. If this is true, perhaps purse-seine sets are not particularly 
 successful unless some other factor prevents the fish from diving under the net. 

VERTICAL THERMAL STRUCTURE ; It is entirely possible that the vertical tem- 
 perature structure of the water can influence the success of a purse-seine set, 
 for if the lead line extends into cold water, yellowfin tuna and skipjack might 
 be deterred from sounding out of the net. 

The experimental sets in the Central Pacific have shown rather conclusively 
 that tuna, even when corralled by the net, readily and quickly sound out of it. 
 This occurred even when tuna were seen in the net several minutes after pursing 
 began. Observations on the purse seines used by POFI showed that the lead line 
 reached a depth of approximately 200 feet. At this depth the water in the Central 
 Pacific, including Hawaiian waters, is generally only 2° to 5° F. cooler than the 
 surface water temperature of about 80° F It is difficult to imagine this temper- 
 ature difference and the high absolute temperatures at the lead line acting to 
 prevent fish from sounding out of the net. In contrast, b at hythermo grams from off 
 Cape San Lucas, Las Tres Marias, and San Benedicto Island (West Coast purse-seine 
 grounds) having surface temperatures from 74° to 87° F., show a 4° to 22° differ- 
 ential between the surface and 200 feet. In this area not only the difference 
 between surface and lead line but the low temperature at 200 feet might frequent- 
 ly act as a deterrent to sounding out of the net„ 

Breder (1951) found that Jenkinsia stolifera reacted very positively to a 
 temperature gradient; the fish, even when frightened, turned back when they en- 
 countered a particular temperature. Sounding tuna might well react in a similar 
 manner, particularly if they were not under a strong stimulus such as fright, and 
 there is reason to believe tuna are not greatly alarmed by the net. 

BEHAVIOR OF TUNA ON THE SURFACE : The rapid, erratic swimming of tuna schools 
 in the Central Pacific, particularly of the Hawaiian skipjack, has already been 
 noted. Since the same species tend to swim slowly and are readily caught off Cen- 
 tral America, there must be some factor in the Central Pacific environment that 
 accounts for their behavior. 

It is possible that the behavior of tuna while feeding is in large part a 
 function of the behavior of their forage. It has been observed on the west coast 
 of Central America that forage fishes will frequently "ball up" into a compact mass 
 when attacked by tuna» This tends to produce a relatively stationary school of 
 fish, an easy prey for a purse seiner. This sort of behavior has never been ob- 
 served in the Central Pacific to the knowledge of the writers. The local forage 
 species when attacked flee rapidly as a school or scatter with the tunas in pursuit.
