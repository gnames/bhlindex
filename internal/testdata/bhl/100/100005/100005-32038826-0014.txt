12 COMMERCIAL FISHERIES REVIEW Vol. 15, No. 4 

Further evidence that forage-fish behavior controls tuna behavior on the feeding 
 grounds is afforded by the behavior of the skipjack when the purse seiner-chum 
 boat combination was used to capture them. By the simple expedient of introducing 
 the docile nehu, a species not normally found where tuna are feeding, the behavior 
 of the skipjack is markedly changed. The speed of the schools can be slowed to 
 2 knots and they can be led into a circle inside a purse seine, all in response 
 to a different food supply. 

Reintjes and King (1953) have shown that yellowfin tuna in the CentralPacific 
 are rarely gorged . The average volume of the stomach contents is such that the 
 fish may have to forage rather constantly in order to obtain an adequate daily 
 ration. Presumably this would result in continuous movement of the tuna schools. 

CONCLUSIONS 

Tuna purse seining shows little promise of success in Central Pacific waters. 
 On our trials we found that: 

1. The area and period of operations were greatly limited by prevailing wind 
 and sea. Even in the lees of the islands operations were hindered by the coral 
 reefs and the few schools present. 

2. The tuna schools swam wildly and rapidly, frequently outrunning the vessel, 
 and of course making it extremely difficult to set on them. 

3. Tuna surrounded in the conventional manner dove under the seine. These 
 tuna may do this easier than off the American coast because the water is much 
 clearer and also warm to a greater depth. Cold water which might be a barrier to 
 sounding, occurs below the lead line of even an extra-deep seine in the Central 
 Pacific. 

4. Live-bait chum would hold a tuna school while it was being surrounded by 
 the purse seine. Small, but apparently entire schools, were captured in this way. 
 Commercial operation in this manner is questionable because there is no proof that 
 this method — using an expensive purse seine — would catch more tuna than pole-and- 
 line fishing with live bait.
