REFRIGERATION : Cold - Storage Life of Frozen Halibut : The purpose of this 
 project is to provide information on the cold-storage life of frozen halibut packed 
 according to present commercial methods, and to compare various packaging and 
 storing methods. This information will be of value to producers and distributors 
 engaged in packaging, storing, and marketing frozen halibut. It will also serve 
 as a basis for the requirements set forth in the Federal specifications for frozen 
 fishery products. Four series of samples were prepared. A description of the 
 samples and the results of the storage tests are as follows: 

Five dressed (heads off and eviscerated) halibut, weighing from 20 to 40 
 pounds each, were obtained from eachof three commercial fishery firms . These fish 
 were sharp frozen and then glazed with potable water. Four halibut from each firm 
 were packed in paper-lined wooden boxes and held in the company' s cold-storage 
 room at 0° F. for periods of 6 to 9 months as needed to prepare the test series. 
 The fifth halibut from each firm was steaked immediately after freezing and glaz- 
 ing. These steaks were glazed and packaged for storage as indicated in each series. 
 One of the following packaging methods was adopted for the steaks and in each 
 series of tests the packaging method used is indicated by the packaging code letter:

A 

Glazed steaks were packed in layers in a 15-pound corrugated-type card- 
 board carton lined with parchment paper. A sheet of parchment paper was 
 placed between each layer of steaks. 

B 

Glazed steaks were placed in MSAT cellophane bags . The bags were heat 
 sealed and packed in 15-pound corrugated-type cardboard cartons. 

C 

Glazed steaks were packed in layers in a 60-pound fibre board box in 
 accordance with military requirements. 

For the organoleptic tests the halibut steaks were examined while frozen, 
 after thawing, and after baking in an oven.
