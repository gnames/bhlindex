 found in the samples from lot 1-3. Preference was given to samples from lot 1-3 
 and second preference to lot 1-2. All three lots were acceptable. 

The packed steaks adjacent to the inner surface of the boxes were extremely 
 dehydrated. The inner layers of steaks showed little or no dehydration. No sig-

nificant differences in quality were found among the steaks stored at the four dif- 
 ferent cold-storage plants. There was more variation within a lot than from lot 
 to lot. The four lots of steaks were considered acceptable. However, the pack- 
 aging method did not provide adequate protection of the samples from dehydration.
