Study of Texture Change of Canned Salmon Prepared from Frozen Fish : Freez- 
 ing and storing salmon prior to canning cause certain changes to occur in the can- 
 ned product. The principal changes are toughening of the canned meat and the for- 
 mation of excessive curd. In an effort to minimize this formation of curd, exper- 
 imental packs were prepared in which the thawed fish were dipped in a salt (sodi- 
 um chloride) solution or tartaric acid solution prior to canning. Alaska red 
 salmon were used. The fish were frozen in the round at -20° F., glazed, and then 
 stored at 0° F. After 14 weeks of storage, the fish were thawed and the experi- 
 mental packs prepared. The canned samples (J-flat cans) were examined after one 
 month's storage at room temperature. Description of the packs and the resultsof 
 the test are summarized in the following table:

In every instance, the samples dipped in either brine (B-l and B-2) or tar- 
 taric acid (C-l and C-2) were superior in appearance to the canned salmon prepared 
 in the regular commercial manner (A) . The one-minute dips appeared equally as ef- 
 fective as the two-minute dips for each respective solution. The tartaric acid 
 solution (5 percent) dip was more effective than the sodium chloride solution dip. 
 In both the normal and brine-treated lots the canned fish showed a considerable 
 tendency to stick to the lids or ends of the can, resulting in a rough surface 
 when the cans were opened. The tartaric acid dip eliminated the tendency of the 
 fish to stick to the lids. Those canned samples treated with tartaric acid had 
 a smooth surface in the can and were free of curd. A slightly abnormal red-orange 
 coloration of the tartaric acid treated fish was noted, but this was not objec- 
 tionable even when compared with canned salmon prepared from unfrozen fish. 

Penetration tests for comparing texture revealed that none of the dips had 
 any effect on the texture (degree of firmness) of the canned product. 

Further tests were carried out to determine the absorption of tartaric acid 
 during the one-minute dip in 5-percent tartaric acid solution. For this particu- 
 lar test, king salmon were used, since they were the species available. These 
 samples had been frozen and held in storage for about 5 months at -10° F. The 
 salmon were thawed and cleaned, and then cut into can-size (js-flat) chunks. The 
 chunks were divided alternately into two lots. One lot was used as a control sam- 
 ple. The other wa.s treated with tartaric acid as follows: The chunks were dipped 
 in 5-percent tartaric-acid solution for 1 minute at a temperature of 60° F. The 
 pH of the solution was 1.9. 

Both lots, the control and treated, were packed into cans, one-half teaspoon 
 of salt was added, and the cans processed in the usual manner. The cans were 
 stored two weeks prior to analysis for tartaric acid content.
