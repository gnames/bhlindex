Free acid in the liquor and in the meat was determined in six cans of fish 
 from each of the two lots. Tartaric-acid content was considered the difference 
 between the combined average of the control lot and the individual can averages 
 of the treated lot. The results are shown in the table. 

The average percentage of free tartaric acid 
 in a g-flat can of salmon was estimated to be 0.029 
 percent . 

Although use of tartaric acid dips shows prom- 
 ise of preventing curd formation in canned salmon 
 prepared from frozen fish, further tests are neces- 
 sary to confirm the results. It will also be nec- 
 essary to determine whether or not use of the proc- 
 ess will meet the provisions of the Federal Food, 
 Drug, and Cosmetic Act. 

The second phase of this project involves a 
 study of the effect of cell breakdown of the frozen 
 and processed fish on the texture of the canned 
 product. Four experimental packs were prepared in 
 the late summer of 1952 and the canned samples (5-flat cans) examined after about 
 five months of storage. The description of the experimental packs and summary of 
 the results are presented in the following table:

Fresh chunks of fish were canned; the cans were 
 frozen at -20° F. and then stored at 0° F. After 9 
 weeks of storage the fish (in the cans) were thawed 
 in cold water then processed at 242° F. (steam pres- 
 sure) for 85 minutes.

Skinned and boned salmon was ground in a blendor. The 
 blended material was packed in cans and processed 
 immediately at 242° F. (steam pressure) for 85 minutes.

Skinned and boned salmon was ground in a blendor. The 
 blended material was packed in cans, frozen at -20° 
 F. and then stored at 0° F. After 9 weeks of storage 
 the material in the cans was thawed in cold water, then 
 processed at 242° F. (steam pressure) for 85 minutes.

1_/THE penetrometer reading varies inversely with the toughness of the fish. 

The penetrometer readings for samples 1-A and 1-B show that toughening occurs 
 in canned salmon prepared from frozen fish. The difference in the average pene- 
 trometer readings for the fish that had been ground (2-A and 2-B) was not signifi- 
 cant. This seemed to indicate that when the cell walls of the fish tissues were 
 ruptured by mechanical means prior to freezing the meat, toughening of the canned 
 product did not occur » Freezing did have considerable effect on curd formation, 
 however, since sample 2-A prepared from unfrozen fish that had been ground showed 
 no curd, while sample 2-B prepared from frozen fish that had been ground showed 
 heavy curd formation. (Ketchikan)
