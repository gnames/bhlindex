DEVELOPMENT OF SPECIALTY FOOD PRODUCTS FROM ALASKA FISH 

AND EDIBLE FISH TRIMMINGS- - Review for Period July 1952-March 1953 

This project was initiated to develop specialty products from Alaska fish 
 and edible fish trimmings in order to encourage off-season industries in Alaska. 
 This is the progress in developing various products during the period July 1952 
 to March 1953: 

CANNED SALMON EGG SPREAD ; A canned salmon egg spread was developed that 
 showed good consumer acceptance. Publication of the process must await a final 
 and favorable report on thermal-process determinations. 

PICKLED HERRING : An improved pickling formula for Alaska herring was tested. 
 The new formula limits the use of red peppers and quadruples the quantity of sugar 
 previously used. The recommended formula and procedure are as follows: Remove 
 head, viscera, and kidney from the herring. Wash fish thoroughly with fresh water. 
 Place the dressed herring in a 90° salometer brine until "struck through" (7 to 9 
 days). Remove the fish from the brine and then freshen them in running coldwater 
 overnight (15 hours). Drain fish. Cut into fillets, and cut fillets into about 
 l^-inch pieces. Pack the pieces of fish layerwise in an earthenware crock and 
 sprinkle spices between each layer. Add to the crock a pickling solution made up 
 of 1^ quarts of vinegar, 1^ pints of water, and 8 ounces of sugar. Allow the her- 
 ring pieces to stand in this pickling mixture for about 2 days, then repack in 
 jars with the spices used in pickling. Packing of fish and spices should be done 
 carefully to make a neat-appearing pack. Fill jars with the pickling solution 
 and add one red pepper and an onion ring to each jar. The spices required to 
 pickle 11 pounds of salted herring are: allspice, 3 oz.; bay leaves, 1 oz.; mus- 
 tard seed, 2 oz.; black pepper, 5 oz.; cloves, \ oz.; and sliced onions, 2 oz. 
 The procedure should produce a spiced Alaska herring product excellent in appear- 
 ance, flavor, and texture. 

CLAMS : A canned smoked clam product was developed which was excellent from 
 the standpoint of appearance and flavor, but had a tough texture. Attempts to im- 
 prove the texture have been unsuccessful. 

FISH SPREADS AND PASTES : A smoked chum-salmon spread was prepared. The prod- 
 uct received fairly good acceptability from the standpoint of texture and flavor. 
 The color of the product, which was somewhat yellow, seemed to be the limiting 
 factor. Further tests to improve the color will be carried out. The present for- 
 mula is: 

6 lbs ground smoked chum salmon 

(skinless and boneless) 
 18 oz. tomato puree 
 24 oz. water 

lg tsp. garlic salt 

36 oz. melted oleomargarine 

3 tsp. gelatin 

Mix the ingredients in a large container. Pour into £-pound cans. Vacuum seal the 
 cans and process for 40 minutes at 242° F. (steam pressure), and finally water cool. 
 (Smoked pink salmon may be substituted for smoked chum salmon.) 

SMOKED SHRIMP : Excellent packs of smoked Alaska shrimp in oil have been pre- 
 pared. Alaska shrimp seem to lend themselves well to the preparation of this type 
 of product. (Ketchikan)
