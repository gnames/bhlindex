Alaska Salmon Research Extended to Offshore Waters 

Research on Alaska salmon in offshore areas of the North Pacific, including 
 the Bering Sea, will be conducted in the summer of 1953 by the U„ S. Fish and Wild- 
 life Service, the Secretary of the Interior announced on March 27. This workwill 
 involve the catching of salmon in waters north and south of the Aleutian Islands 
 in an area centered at 175° W. longitude, which runs through Atka Island. 

Objectives of the program are (l) to gain as much knowledge as possible of 
 the distribution, abundance, life history, racial composition, and other factors 
 of the North Pacific salmon in offshore waters, and (2) to test and evaluate the 
 effectiveness of various types of gear for catching salmon on the high seas. This 
 will involve developing means of capturing salmon in considerable numbers suitable 
 for future tagging experiments. 

Fishing will begin not later than June 1, which will require departure of the 
 vessel from Seattle about May 15. Activities will continue through July and pos- 
 sibly into August, depending on requirements of the program. 

Detailed planning and duties of this project are the joint responsibility of 
 three Branches of the Fish and Wildlife Service:
