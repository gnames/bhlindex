20 ""COMMERCIAL FISHERIES REVIEW Vol. 15, No. 4 

Branch of Commercial Fisheries — general operation of the exploratory fishing 
 vessel John N. Cobb ; developing, supplying, and operating the gear for catching 
 the salmon. 

Branch of Fishery Biology — making biological observations and analyzing the 
 data. 

The Branch of Alaska Fisheries assisted in the planning of the project. 

A cooperator from the Fisheries Research Institute of the University of 
 Washington will also be aboard the vessel to work on the project. 

The Director of the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service explained that the proj- 
 ect was a part of the preliminary salmon research begun in the summer of 1952 in 
 connection with the International Convention for the High Seas Fisheries of the 
 North Pacific Ocean, signed at Tokyo, May 9, 1952, subject to ratification by the 
 United States, Canada, and Japan. The Convention establishes the meridian of 
 175° W. longitude as a provisional line of demarcation between salmon of American 
 and Asiatic origin. Both Japan and Canada have agreed to abstain from fishing 
 for salmon east of this line in the Bering Sea. A protocol to the Convention 
 provides for scientific investigation to determine the location of a permanent 
 line of demarcation. 

Although the Convention has not yet entered into force, the Fish and Wildlife 
 Service has already initiated research in the area. During the summer of 1952, a 
 Service biologist accompanied a Japanese salmon expedition operating in the Bering 
 Sea west of 175° W. longitude to collect data bearing upon the distribution of 
 salmon. 

Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission 

NORTH AND MIDDLE ATLANTIC SECTIONS MEET : Dragging regulations in inlandwaters 
 and the marginal sea were discussed at a joint meeting of the North and Middle 
 Atlantic sections of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission held at New 
 York on March 12. The U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service was requested to summarize 
 all available data on the effects of dragging on bottom life and the sea bottom, 
 and if data is inadequate, to outline a program of study and estimate costs. 

New York, New Jersey, and Massachusetts fishermen reported concern over the 
 decline in sea-scallop production and the sections, after full discussion, voted 
 to ask the Fish and Wildlife Service to make a quick study and report on thismatter. 

It was announced that the Fish and Wildlife Service will coordinate the Com- 
 mission' s joint federal-state research program on striped bass. A Service scien- 
 tist will visit the various states along the Atlantic coast to encourage and co- 
 ordinate striped bass research among the state fishery agencies and laboratories. 
 He will also conduct limited research on the racial composition of various striped 
 bass stocks. The officials and scientists of the two sections were shown the new 
 Striped Bass Compendium, sponsored by the Commission's Striped Bass Committee, and 
 just published by the Bingham Oceanographic Laboratory of Yale University. This 
 work summarizes all the data on the striped bass published to November 1949 and 
 contains new material relating to Chesapeake Bay, the principal source of the At- 
 lantic striped bass stock.
