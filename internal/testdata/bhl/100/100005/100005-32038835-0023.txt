21 

New York, Connecticut, and New Jersey members discussed at length New York's 
 new act repealing the 6-inch size limit on butterfish adopted at the request of 
 anglers and commercial fishermen. Connecticut representatives declined to recom- 
 mend similar legislation in that State and New Jersey officials indicated they 
 would not take any action this year but would study the results of New York' s 
 action. 

Also discussed were the new Weichel Act adopted by Congress in 1952, forbid- 
 ding the shipment of fish into or out of any state in violation of its laws; the 
 regulation of out-of-state boats in inland marine waters; Tidelands bills pending 
 in Congress; offshore waste disposal by industry; and several minor bills in the 
 several states.

TUNA FLEET ALERTED TO WATCH FOR TAGGED FISH : California' s tuna-fishing fleet 
 has been alerted to be on the lookout during 1953 for fish tagged by the State De- 
 partment of Fish and Game, reports a March 18 release by that Agency. Marine bi- 
 ologists have been tagging skipjack, albacore, and other tuna for 12 months under 
 the Department's tuna research program, and are keenly interested in examiningall 
 tagged fish caught, the State agency reports,. Recoveries of tagged tuna will help 
 the Department determine basic migration patterns, rate of growth, and population 
 groups. The over-all aim is to gain knowledge so that the fishery's abundance 
 and sustained yield can be assured. Several tagged tuna already have been recov- 
 ered. 

Fishermen are asked to preserve in the round all tagged fish recovered, and 
 turn them over to the nearest California Fish and Game office. The State's cur- 
 rent marine tag is a short piece of plastic "spaghetti" threaded through the fish 
 behind the second dorsal fin. It contains the original tagging data and should 
 be returned with the fish.
