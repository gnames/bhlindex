22 COMMERCIAL FISHERIES REVIEW Vol. 15, No. 4 

decrease of 32.3 percent in quantity and 19.7 percent in value as compared with 
 the same period in 1952. 

Prices paid for fresh and frozen fish by the Army Quartermaster Corps in 
 February averaged 58.4 cents per pound as compared with 53.9 cents in January, 
 and 47.9 cents in February 1952. 

In addition to the purchases of fresh and frozen fishery products indicated 
 above, the Armed Forces generally make some local purchases which are not included 
 in the above figures. Therefore, actual purchases are somewhat higher than indi- 
 cated, but it is not possible to obtain data on the local purchases made by mili- 
 tary installations throughout the country. 

Fishery Products Marketing Prospects for April-June 1953 

Civilian per-capita consumption of fishery products during the early part of 
 1953 was about as large as a year earlier, and is expected to continue at the 1952 
 rate at least through mid-year. Retail prices, judging from trade reports from 
 important wholesale markets, have been much lower than in the comparable months 
 of 1952. Current indications are that retail prices for fresh and frozen products 
 as a group during the spring and early summer may be considerably below those in 
 the same part of last year, while those of the canned commodities may be slightly 
 lower. 

The commercial catch of fish and shellfish during January-March 1953 was 
 somewhat smaller than in the first quarter of 1952. In some areas the size of the 
 catch was limited by the availability of fish, as in the case of shrimp for the 
 Gulf Coast States; in other areas (principally the Northwest) the relatively low 
 prices paid to fishermen discouraged commercial fishing activity. 

Commercial freezings of fishery products in the United States and Alaska dur- 
 ing the first quarter of this year totaled almost 29 million pounds, down 18 per- 
 cent from output in the comparable part of 1952. Freezings of shrimp and haddock 
 fillets were sharply lower thus far in 1953 than a year earlier. Total output of 
 frozen fish and shellfish is expected to increase by mid-1953, reflecting the sea- 
 sonal increase in commercial landings. 

Record stocks of frozen fishery products in cold storage in the United States 
 and Alaska on April 1 totaled 119 million pounds, 4 percent above a year earlier. 
 An unusually large proportion of the total stocks on April 1 was made up of frozen 
 halibut and frozen fillets of cod, haddock, and ocean perch. 

About the same volume of canned fishery products has been available thus far 
 this year as in the same part of 1952, when supplies were relatively light. The 
 larger supplies of canned tuna, Maine sardines, mackerel, and anchovies were more 
 than offset by smaller quantities of canned salmon and the scarcity of California 
 sardines. 

Current prospects are that supplies of canned fish and shellfish will total 
 no larger than in 1952 at least until late summer, when the new packs of most prod- 
 ucts start moving into domestic distribution in volume. 

Imports of frozen groundfish and ocean perch fillets, a very important group 
 among the fishery products received from abroad, totaled 16 million pounds during
