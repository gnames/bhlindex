April 1953 COMMERCIAL FISHERIES REVIEW 23 

January and February 1953 , about 15 percent smaller than a year earlier. Imports 
 of these products during the next few months will be large, but are not expected 
 to equal total receipts during the same part of 1952. 

Exports of edible fishery products during January and February, especially 
 of the canned commodities, were somewhat below the relatively snail volume of a 
 year earlier. During the spring months, exports may not exceed those of a year 
 earlier because of the comparatively small domestic supplies of canned salmonand 
 California sardines (pilchards), especially of the latter. 

This analysis appeared in a report prepared by the Bureau of Agricultural 
 Economics, U. So Department of Agriculture, in cooperation with the U. S. Fish 
 and Wildlife Service, and published in the former agency's April-June 1953 issue 
 of the National Food Situation . 

Metal Cans — Shipments for Fishery Products, January 1953 

Total shipments of metal cans for fish and sea food in January 
 1953 amounted to 3,375 short tons of steel — 30 percent less than the 
 5,500 short tons shipped in December 1952, but 4 percent more than 
 the 3,743 short tons shipped in January 1952. This is based on a 
 March 24 report issued by the Bureau of the Census. 
 note: statistics cover all commercial and captive plants known to be producing metal cans, 
 reported in base boxes of steel consumed in the manufacture of cans, the data for fishery 
 products are converted to tons of steel by using the factor: 23.0 base boxes of steel equal 
 one short ton of steel. 

North Atlantic Fishery Investigations 

" ALBATROSS III " COLLECTS SAMPLES FOR OCEAN PERCH LIFE -HISTORY STUDY ( Cruise 
 No . 45) : A small sample of very small ocean perch '(54-80 mm.) was collected by 
 the research vessel Albatross , 111 operated by the Service's Branch of Fishery 
 Biology. The cruise to the western part of the Gulf of Maine commenced on March 3. 
 The small ocean perch samples were sought for life-history studies and to endeavor 
 to determine the vertical distribution of ocean perch at night. No ocean perch 
 were caught during night-fishing operations. These small sizes were previously 
 unobtainable and are valuable for age and growth studies. The vessel returned to 
 Woods Hole on March 11 

Extremely rough weather and the unfortunate loss of fishing gear did much to 
 hamper fishing. Although the small ocean perch were not collected in the quanti- 
 ties hoped for, some concentrations of small haddock (13-1S cm.) were found and 
 specimens were collected which may prove valuable for haddock food study work.

" ALBATROSS III " COLLECTS HADDOCK EGGS AND LARVAE ( Cruise No. 46) : Approxi- 
 mately 3,000 miles of continuous plankton tows were made on Georges Bank and the 
 Gulf of Maine by the Service's research vessel Albatross III to collect samples 
 and data to determine the distribution of haddock eggs and larvae. Operated by 
 the Branch of Fishery Biology, the vessel made tows at the surface and 10-meter 
 depths with Hardy Plankton Recorders. Continuous salinity and temperature records 
 were also obtained. A total of 800 drift bottles were released throughout the area.
