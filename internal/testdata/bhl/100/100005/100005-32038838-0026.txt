Large concentrations of eggs were found on the Northeast peak of Georges 
 Bank, in South Channel, and on Browns Bank. Some of the egg samples were hatched 
 out for identification purposes. The data have yet to be analyzed. It is believed 
 a very complete coverage was made of the area of concern.

" CHARLES H. GILBERT " STUDIES TUNA DISTRIBUTION AND MOVEMENTS IN HAWAIIAN 
 AREA ( Cruise "f): The study of the winter distribution and movements of surface 
 tuna schools in the Hawaiian area in relation to temperature and related phenomena 
 was carried out by the Service's research vessel Charles H„ Gilbert on a 19-day 
 cruise completed at Honolulu on February 14. Also, tests were conducted with fish 
 attractants, bait tank aeration, and the use of the hydrophone and recorder for 
 tuna detection. Live small yellowfin were obtained and delivered to the Coconut 
 Island ponds in Hawaii in good condition,, 

Notable concentrations of small schools of skipjack tuna attended by birds 
 were encountered west of the Kona coast to more than 100 miles from land, and 
 southwest of Lanai. Replicate passes in opposite directions along each leg of the 
 cruise were made to provide a basis for estimating the variability in counts of 
 flocks and schools in a given area. Preliminary inspection of the data indicates 
 significant variations in counts of flocks and schools with vessel direction, from 
 area to area, and from day to day, but not with time of day. A possible explana- 
 tion for some of the variability lies in the assumption of a systematic northeast- 
 erly movement of schools into the area south of the islands during the period of 
 the survey. Abrupt surface temperature discontinuities north of Oahu and south- 
 west of Lanai were found and sectioned by bathythermograph lowerings in close suc- 
 cession. 

Preliminary tests with a fish attractant solution mixed with fluorescein were 
 carried out north of Oahu. Reactions of the fish were not observed. Bait-tank 
 aeration by a compressed air jet was found to be efficient as a means of holding 
 live bait during dead-ship experiments with the hydrophone <, Mechanical failure 
 cancelled the sole opportunity to use the hydrophone in an area where skipjack 
 tuna were abundant.

STEEL-WIRE LONG-LINE GEAR TESTED BY " CHARLES H. GILBERT " ( Cruise 10) : There 
 appears to be no significant difference between the behavior of cotton and steel 
 long-line gear in the water, according to tests made by the Pacific Oceanic Fish- 
 ery Investigations' research vessel Charles H. Gilbert . On this 4-day cruise, 
 completed at Honolulu on March 26, the vessel operated off the Kona coast and SW. 
 of Lanai. The tests with the steel-wire gear were made in these areas at three 
 fishing stations. Three big-eyed tuna, two sharks, and one manimahi were takenon 
 the wire gear. 

Tests of cotton long-line gear treated with Stockholm tar were made, but re- 
 sults were inconclusive. Newly-tarred gear was difficult to handle with the long- 
 line hauler. During the latter part of the cruise, as excess tar was washed from 
 the line, an improvement was noted. Additional tests are necessary to showwhether 
 or not tar is suitable as a long-Line preservative.
