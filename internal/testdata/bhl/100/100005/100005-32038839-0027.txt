April 1953 COMMERCIAL FISHERIES REVIEW 25 

Sea tests of two types of experimental plastic depth gauges were made by low- 
 ering gauges to various depths with a 900 -foot BT. Each type of gauge, when low- 
 ered several times to the same level, showed uniform readings with small differ- 
 ences between successive trials; however, calibration corrections or differences 
 between individual gauges were very large,,

" JOHN R. MANNING " MAKES EXCELLENT YELLOWFIN TUNA CATCHES NEAR EQUATOR ( Cruise 
 No. IkJ": Excellent long-line catches of yellowfin tuna were made in the Pacific 
 equatorial zone by the POFI research vessel John R. Manning on a two-months' ex- 
 perimental fishing cruise completed at Honolulu on March 25. The deep-swimming 
 tunas of the equatorial zone were sampled by fishing long lines at a series of 
 stations southward across the equator in the vicinity of 150° W. longitude. After 
 refueling at Papeete, Tahiti, a second series of stations were fished along 140° 
 W. longitude on the homeward leg. Particularly good catches of yellowfin were 
 made in the latter section where catch rates ran^as high as 17 tuna or about one 
 ton per 100 hooks per day of fishing. This was more than twice the rate found on 
 previous cruises in the same locality and 8 times greater than the average catch 
 rate in Hawaiian waters. 

On both sections, the biggest catches were made within 1° of the equator. 
 The apparent abundance of tuna was much higher on 140° W. longitude than on 150° 
 W. longitude. The average tuna catch (all species) per 100 hooks per day's fish- 
 ing for eight stations between 4°30' N. and 4° S. on 150° W. longitude was 3.48 
 fish as compared with an average of 8.72 fish for eight stations between the same 
 latitudes on 140° W. longitude. The average yellowfin catch rates for, the same 
 two series of stations were 2.75 and 7.49 fish, respectively. 

To show the diurnal variation in availability of tunas to long-line fishing 
 and the effect of soaking time on the long-line catch, a series of four special 
 stations was fished near the equator — two 12-hour stations and one 24-hour station 
 on the 150° W. longitude section and one 24-hour station on the 140° W. longitude 
 line. Although these experiments were carried out at locations which had afforded 
 good catches during the preceding day, the results were generally poor and too few 
 fish were caught to contribute much information on the questions under study. 
 Sharks and bait-stealing organisms, probably squid, were found to be much more 
 active during the night than in the daytime,, 

A total of 40 albacore, ranging in weight from 30 to 50 pounds, were taken, 
 all of them south of the equator. On the 150° W„ longitude section, albacore were 
 caught at all of the stations from 1° S. to 15°30' S. latitude, the last station 
 before Tahiti. But on the return voyage, they were taken only at the two south- 
 ernmost stations, at 13°30' S. and at 10°10' S. latitude. 

A total of 20 baskets of experimental long lines with 1-fathom branch lines 
 were used on the 150° W. longitude section, in addition to the usual 40 baskets of 
 standard gear. It appeared that these lines caught fish as well as the regular 
 gear, but a tendency for the short branch lines to wind up tightly during the haul 
 made the experimental gear slow and troublesome to handle. 

The relation of the hooks to the thermocline was investigated by means of 
 echo-sounding, and the use of depth gauges on the line. The echo-sounding was 
 fairly successful and indicated a high degree of variability in line depth. 

Information was collected ooncerning the small-scale tuna fishery of Tahiti 
 with a view to learning anything which might be profitably applied to fishery de-
