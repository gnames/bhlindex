velopment in the United States island territories in the Pacific. It was found 
 that the Tahitian fishery has apparently been held back by the same obstacles of 
 inadequate bait supplies, primitive fishing and canning methods, and distance 
 from the major consuming areas which tuna-fishing enterprises elsewhere in the 
 Pacific islands have encountered. 

Status of American Samoa Shipments of Fishery Products 

to the United States 

Certain questions have been raised regarding the status of American Samoa 
 shipments of fishery products to the United States. Since a United States busi- 
 ness firm may lease the tuna cannery situated in American Samoa, the possibility 
 of such shipments may develop. In order to establish the status of such shipments 
 and of fishery products landings at American Samoa ports by vessels of foreign 
 registry, the Special Assistant to the Under Secretary of State requested an ex- 
 pression of opinion from the Commissioner of Customs. The reply by the Commis- 
 sioner of Customs points out that: 

(1) "...Canned tuna brought into the United States from Samoa is not subject 
 to customs duties because it is not imported from a foreign country. ..o" 

(2) If legislation provided for a quota on fresh and frozen tuna imports 
 into the United States, "it would not apply to imports into American Samoa because 
 American Samoa is not a part of the customs territory of the United States." How- 
 ever, "whether or not a quota on 'imports' of tuna would apply to shipments from 
 Samoa of tuna landed there by a foreign country would depend on the answer to the 
 question whether shipments from Samoa are 'importations' for tariff purposes. 
 Since American Samoa is a possession of the United States, it is not a foreign coun- 
 try and shipments therefrom would not be importations into the United States, if 
 the merchandise had actually been imported into Samoa as distinguished from pass- 
 ing through Samoa in transit . . . . " 

(3) "Except as otherwise permitted by treaty or convention, section 4311 of 
 the Revised Statutes (46 U.S.C. 251), as amended by the Act of September 2, 1950 
 (64 Stat. 577), prohibits a foreign-flag vessel, whether documented as a cargo 
 vessel or otherwise, from landing in a port of the United States its catch of 
 fish taken on board on the high seas or fish products processed therefrom, or any 
 fish or fish products taken on board such vessel on the high seas from a vessel 
 engaged in fishing operations or in the processing of fish or fish products. The 
 Bureau (of Customs) is of the opinion that the statute does not apply to the land- 
 ing of fish or fish products in any port of American Samoa. Accordingly, a Japa- 
 nese flag mothership or fishing vessel, whether proceeding as such or as a cargo 
 vessel direct from fishing grounds on the high seas, is not prohibited thereby 
 from landing in American Samoa fresh or frozen tuna fish taken on the high seas, 
 nor does such law prohibit a United States flag vessel from landing at American 
 Samoa such a fish cargo acquired on the high seas by direct transfer from a Japa- 
 nese flag mothershipo"
