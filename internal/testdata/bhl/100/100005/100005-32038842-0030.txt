duction in the Atlantic Coast States has declined sharply. The mackerel fishery 
 along the Atlantic Coast the past few years has been very poor and the catch has 
 been only a small percentage of former years. 

Because of the failure of the sardine fishery in California in 1952, packers 
 in that State have concentrated on packing mackerel. On the other hand, since 1949 
 mackerel canning on the Atlantic Coast has shown a steady decline due principally 
 to the scarcity of mackerel in the Atlantic. 

Demand for canned mackerel in 1952 was considered good and prices were higher 
 than for the past several years. The average canners' price for 1952 in California 
 was $7.39 per standard case — substantially higher than in 1951 and for any year 
 since 1949. A steady export demand for canned mackerel helped to maintain the price, 
 On the other hand, Atlantic Coast packers sold canned mackerel in 1952 at an aver- 
 age price of $11.41 per standard case — somewhat lower than the record price of 
 $12.12 per case received in 1951. The price in 1952, however, was the second high- 
 est price on record.
