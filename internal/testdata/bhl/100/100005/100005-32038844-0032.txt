There has been an almost constant decline in the canning of alewives since 
 the peak year of 1946 (table 2). However, there was a good production in 1951 
 and a sharp decline in 1952. 

Canners received an average of $4.69 per standard case for the 1952 pack, one 
 percent less than the $4.73 received in 1951. Since 1942, only in 1949 ($4.19) 
 and in 1950 ($4.56) did lower prices prevail. A record-high price ($6.08) was re- 
 ceived by canners in 1946.

 pack of canned groundfish flakes in 
 the United States amounted to 29,333 
 standard cases, valued at $479,027 
 to the packers. This was an increase 
 of 49 percent in quantity and 53 per- 
 cent in value, compared with the 1951 
 production. Maine and Massachusetts 
 are the only states that produce can- 
 ned groundfish flakes — canning in 1952 
 was carried on by 4 plants in Maine 
 and 2 plants in Massachusetts. 

Canners received an average price 
 of $16.33 per case in 1952, an increase 
 of 42 cents per case over 1951, and 
 was exceeded only by the record price 
 of $16.37 in 1947.
