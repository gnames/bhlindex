2/a gallon of oil weighs 7.74 pounds. 

This was the fifth successive year that the catch exceeded one billion pounds. 
 The catch of menhaden by fishermen since the founding of the nation has been far 
 greater than that of any other species. Available data for most of the last 79 
 years indicate that about 38 billion pounds of menhaden were taken for manufacture 
 into meal and oil. Table 2 shows the rapid growth of the menhaden fishery in re- 
 cent years.

U. S. Fish Oil Exports, 1952 

United States inedible fish oil exports in 1952 declined 12 percent from 1951 
 and 42 percent from 1950 (see table), reports the March 23 Foreig n Crops and Markets 
 of the Department of Agriculture. Shipments amounted to 21,981 short tons, com- 
 pared with 24,920 and 37,987 tons, respectively, in the 2 previous years. About 
 94 percent of the total was sold to Europe. More than one-half (11,697 tons) of 
 the over-all total went to the Netherlands. Western Germany purchased almost one- 
 fourth (5,134 tons) of the total.
