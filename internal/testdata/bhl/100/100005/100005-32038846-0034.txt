Utilization of U. S. and Alaska Catch 

of Fishery Products, 1952 

Preliminary data reveal that the total catch of fishery products in the United 
 States during 1952 amounted to 4.3 billion pounds (round weight), compared with 
 Utilization of U.S. and Alaska Catch of Fishery! 4.4 billion pounds in 1951 (see 
 Products, 1948-52 ( Round Weight Basis) J table). Of the 1952 catch, 35.3 

percent was utilized fresh and fro- 
 zen as compared with 38.5 percent 
 in 1951 and 34.6 percent in 1950. 
 Due to record catches of menhaden, 
 the byproducts and bait industries 
 used 33.2 percent of the catch in 
 1952 as compared with 28.2 percent 
 and 28.1 percent in 1951 and 1950, 
 respectively. The failure of the 
 California pilchard (sardine) fish- 
 ery reduced the amount of the 1952 catch processed into canned fish to 29.2 percent 
 as against 31.0 percent in 1951 and 35.3 percent in 1950. The remaining 2 percent 
 of the total catch was cured.
