WHOLESALE PRICES , FEBRUARY 1953 : Prices for edible fishery products at the 
 wholesale level were down in February. Unusually mild weather, particularly on 
 the Atlantic Coast, brought about increased fishing activity and a good supply of 
 fish and shellfish. Further declines in meat prices, 
 especially beef, also was a factor in keeping fish 
 prices down. The over-all edible fish and shell- 
 fish (fresh, frozen, and canned) wholesale index 
 for February was 108.0 percent of the 1947-49 av- 
 erage (see table) â€” 3 -3 percent lower than in Jan- 
 uary and 0.2 percent less than in February 1952, 
 the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department 
 of Labor reports. 

Prices dropped for all salt-water fish in- 
 cluded in the drawn, dressed, or whole finfish 
 subgroup. On the other hand, fresh-water fish 
 prices rose except for whitefish prices at New York City which also dropped. Com- 
 pared with a year ago, prices in this subgroup were mostly down. From Januaryto 
 February fresh large drawn offshore haddock at Boston dropped 14.2 percent because 
 of heavier landings. There were slight price declines at New York City for frozen 
 Western halibut and salmon, and a 32.6-percent decrease in whitefish prices. Drawn,
