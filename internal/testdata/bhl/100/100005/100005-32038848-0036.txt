dressed, or whole finfish prices for February on the whole were down 4.5 percent 
 from January and 5.2 percent below February 1952. 

Fresh processed fish and shellfish prices declined 4.2 percent from January 
 to February. During this period haddock fillets at Boston went down 18.2 percent, 
 but fresh large shrimp rose 2,0 percent due to light supplies and a strong market. 
 Compared with a year earlier, prices in this subgroup were 10.3 percent higher, 
 principally due to shrimp prices which were 21.5 percent higher. 

There was a mixed trend in the frozen processed fish and shellfish subgroup. 
 Prices in general dropped 1.1 percent from January to February. Flounder fillet 
 and large shrimp prices were higher, small haddock fillet prices were much lower 
 (17.2 percent), while ocean perch fillet prices remained the same. Inventories 
 of frozen flounder fillets and shrimp were light, while haddock fillet supplies 
 were heavy. Cold-storage inventories of frozen groundfish fillets as a whole were 
 very large due to heavy imports in 1952. Most frozen fillet prices were down. 
 This February's frozen shrimp prices were 37.4 percent higher than a year earlier 
 and were responsible for the 1„3 percent over-all increase in the processed frozen 
 fish and shellfish subgroup. Actually frozen flounder, haddock, and ocean perch 
 fillet prices this February were considerably lower than in February 1952. 

The canned fishery products subgroup index was the only one to show an in- 
 crease (0.5 percent) from January to February, but it was slightly lower (1..1 per- 
 cent) than in February 1952. Canned pink salmon prices remained steady at January 
 levels, but all other canned fish prices in this subgroup rose. Compared with 
 February 1952, canned fish prices showed a mixed trend. Pink salmon and California 
 sardines were down slightly, while Maine sardines were down 22.7 percent. Canned 
 light-meat tuna prices were up 12.7 percent because the market for this product 
 was considerably stronger than a year ago.
