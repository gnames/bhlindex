NORTH EUROPEAN OVERFISHING CONVENTION OF 1946 COMES INTO FORCE : The Over- 
 fishing Convention signed in London in 1946, to prevent depletion of stocks in 
 the North Sea and other areas, was recently ratified by Spain, the last of the 
 twelve signatories to do so, and the Convention therefore comes into force A— 
 pril 5, 1953. The signatories are Belgium, Denmark, the Irish Republic, France, 
 Iceland, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the U~ 
 nited Kingdom, reports a February 20 U. S. Embassy dispatch from London,, Al- 
 though not a signatory, the German Eederal Republic is expected to accede to 
 the Convention, a London- press release ( Manchester Guardian . February 13) points 
 out. 

In a written answer in the House of Commons on February 12, 1953, the British 
 Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, in announcing that the Convention would 
 come into force on April 5 of this year, stated that by that time it was expect- 
 ed the provisions relating to the retention, landing, and sale of immature fish 
 would have been put into effect, but that most countries would require a longer 
 time to use up stocks of existing nets before the provisions for increasing the 
 minimum size of mesh would come into force. He further stated that the matter 
 would be discussed at the scheduled March 4 conference, as well as the setting 
 up of the Permanent Commission provided by the Convention and which will have 
 the task of considering what further conservation measures are required. The 
 increase of the minimum size of net mesh would also be considered. 

The question of the fishing dispute with Iceland was most likely to be air- 
 ed at the scheduled meeting, since all the disputants in the case (France, Bel- 
 gium, and the Netherlands have also formally protested the restrictions) are 
 parties to the Convention. However, serious study of the problem will most prob' 
 ably be left to the Permanent Commission. 

The press release indicates that "the Convention fixed the size limits be- 
 low which certain fish should not be retained on board ship, landed, or sold. 
 The United Kingdom has already applied this provision by means of the Sea Fish- 
 ing Industry (Immature Sea Fish) Order, 1948, and it is expected that all the 
 other signatories will have acted likewise before April 5 if they have not al- 
 ready done so. 

"Unrestricted fishing between the two world wars, and the probability that 
 this practice would be resumed, led to the preparation of the Overfishing Con- 
 vention as a means of preventing the depletion of stocks in the North Sea and 
 other areas." 

It is reported that the waters concerned are those parts of the Atlantic 
 and Arctic Oceans lying north of 48° N. latitude and between 42° W. longitude 
 and 32° E. longtitude excluding the Baltic. 

The news release further states that "the waters covered by the Convention 
 are those of the North Sea, and of the Northern seas away to Greenland, Iceland,
