"It may take between 12 and 18 months before all the fishing vessels of all 
 the signatories are equipped with nets of the new minimum standard. The rate 
 of replacement of fishing nets is fairly rapid, and as the need for replacement 
 occurs the new nets will be supplied. The proposed permanent commission will 
 have no executive powers and no international sanctions are proposed for the en— 
 forcement of the Convention. Each signatory will be responsible for ensuring 
 that its fishing industry keeps to the new rules."

FISHING-BOAT DESIGN AND EQUIPMENT MEETINGS IN PARIS 
 AND MIAMI: To encourage the exchange of information on 
 latest advances in the design and equipment of fishing 
 boats, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United 
 Nations will sponsor two meetings — 'One in Paris, October 12- 
 16 and another in Miami, Florida, November 16-20, 1953. 

The new plan of holding the same type of meeting in 
 two places will be tried, FAO said, in an effort to reach 
 the largest possible audience. "Neither experts nor their 
 audience have the time or the money to travel halfway a- 
 round the world for a single meeting," FAO's Senior Fish- 
 eries Technologist pointed out, 

FAO has invited all member countries to send official delegates and hopes 
 that comnercial firms in all regions will send observers. The Paris meeting was 
 scheduled mainly for Europe, most of Asia and Africa, and the Miami meeting for 
 the American continents and the Pacific. 

Designers of fishing boats and manufacturers of equipment are expected to 
 be interested in the meetings. Many of the papers and films to be presented will 
 deal with new and improved craft and equipment of all sorts. 

The agenda will be the same at both meetings. Included will be a review of 
 different types of boats from all over the world; discussions of fish handling 
 and processing in f actoryships ; the shape of boats; construction methods and ma- 
 terials; choice of engines; gear for handling nets; and arrangements for handling 
 the catch on board. 

An important contribution to the meetings will be made, FAO believes, by 
 countries often considered less developed in technical fields. For example, FAO 
 pointed out, Chile has much to offer in the mechanization of sailing boats suit-
