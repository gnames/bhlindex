SEA-WATER POLLUTION CONTROL CONSIDERED DESIRABLE BY SOME NATIONS : Interna- 
 tional action to reduce the pollution of sea water by oil and other waste mate- 
 rials is considered desirable by a number of governments which have replied to 
 a United Nations inquiry, according to a report prepared for the UN Transport 
 and Communications Commission. Some of the governments reported that pollution 
 has increased in recent years, with resulting damage to fisheries, sea birds, 
 plant life, beaches, and ports. Others indicated that the problem had been con- 
 trolled by local and national vigilance, a January 19 United Nations Press release 
 reports . 

The report (Doc. E/CN .2/134, Nov. 12, 1952) will be considered at the Com- 
 mission's sixth session which opened on February 2 at the U. N. Headquarters. 
 It summarizes information received in response to an Economic and Social Council 
 resolution of August 1951 inviting governments to send to the UN the results of 
 studies on pollution of sea water. Results of the studies will be given to the 
 Intergovernmental Maritime Consultative Organization when it starts functioning 
 as a specialized agency of the United Nations. 

The report outlines some of the studies made and steps taken by national 
 governments, summarizes suggestions by a number of governments regarding techni- 
 cal methods for reducing discharge of oily wastes from ships, and reviews previ- 
 ous international action on the problem.
