In its reply the United States said it had insufficient evidence that pol- 
 lution of the high seas was serious enough to require international action, but 
 expressed readiness to participate in joint studies. National and municipal laws 
 against pollution are rigidly enforced in the United States, the reply stated.

ANTARCTIC SEASON FOR 1952/53 ENDED MARCH 16: The 1952/53 pelagic (open 
 sea) season for baleen whales in the Antarctic ended on March 16, just 75 days 
 after the opening on January 2. The decision on the closing date reached by 
 the Committee of International Whaling Statistics constitutes a forecast by that 
 body that the maximum-catch quota of 16,000 blue-whale units will have been at- 
 tained by that date. Although the 1952/53 season will be 11 days longer than 
 last year's short season of only 64 days, the expeditions participating number- 
 ed only 16 against 19 in 1951/ 
 52. The 3 factoryships with- 
 drawn from service this sea- 
 son were Norwegian vessels,

Production of whale oil from the current season's Antarctic pelagic catch 
 probably will approximate the 383,000 short tons produced in 1951/52, since the 
 16,000 blue-whale-unit quota remains unchanged. However, a small increase in 
 output may result from the longer season due to the fact that whales grow fatter 
 as the season progresses. In addition to the 1951/52 Antarctic pelagic output, 
 some 25,000 tons of whale oil was produced from whales killed by catcher boats 
 operating from 3 South Georgia shore stations. Data regarding production of 
 whale oil in areas outside the Antarctic in 1952 are not yet available. This 
 production, however, usually con- ; . ; ,. :4:s , :W ,. M . : *&&Â«? 

stitutes only about 10 percent of 
 the total world output. 

The catching of sperm whales 
 is not subject to the same strict 
 international regulations that gov- 
 ern baleen whales, although some 
 limitations have been introduced. 
 If preliminary data regarding the 
 production of sperm oil by Antarc- 
 tic expeditions prior to the open- 
 ing of the baleen season on Jan- 
 uary 2, 1953, can be considered a 
 criteria of the entire season's 
 output, production of sperm oil 

will drop sharply in 1952/53. Of the 12 expeditions for which information is 
 available, sperm oil output was only about one-third of the quantity produced 
 as of the comparable date in 1952. Total Antarctic production of sperm oil in 
 1951/52 was about 53,500 short tons, including some 1,200 tons from South Geor- 
 gia shore-station operations. Production of sperm oil in "other" areas in 1952 
 probably will be less than half the 71,000 tons produced in these areas in 1951*
