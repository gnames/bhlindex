INTERNATIONAL PACIFIC HALIBUT COMMISSION 

MAJOR CHANGES IN THE NEW UNITED STATES-CANADIAN PACIFIC HALIBUT CONVEN - 
 TION ; There are several major changes in the revision of the "Convention be- 
 tween the United States of America and Canada for the Preservation of the Hal- 
 ibut Fishery of the Northern Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea," which was signed in 
 Ottawa on March 2, 1953: 

1. The title has been altered to distinguish the new Convention from other 
 fisheries treaties. The change in name from "The International Fisheries Com- 
 mission" to the "International Pacific Halibut Commission," is to enable ready 
 identification and to distinguish the Commission from other fishery commissions 
 on which Canada and the United States are represented. 

2 The number of commissioners has been changed. In the present revision 
 the number of commissioners has been increased from 4 to 6 — 3 from each country. 

3. A change has been made in the open fishing season for halibut. Under 
 the new treaty the Commission has power to establish more than one open season. 
 There was some doubt as to the Commission's power to do this under the former 
 treaty. The granting of this power was considered necessary in order to allow 
 the Commission to extend fishing over more than one period of time. The scien- 
 tists of the Commission advanced the hypothesis that during a concentrated short 
 season some fishing grounds might be underexploited. The experiment of divid- 
 ing up the season will be useful to determine to some extent whether this hy- 
 pothesis is correct. 

4. Under the former treaty the Commission had power to limit or prohibit 
 the incidental catch of halibut taken by vessels fishing for other species dur- 
 ing the closed season only. Additional power has now been given to the Commis- 
 sion so that it has the right also to regulate such incidental catch during the 
 open season. 

The Convention between Canada and the United States of America for the pres- 
 ervation of the halibut fishery of the North Pacific Ocean and the Bering Sea 
 was first negotiated in 1923. It was revised in 1930 and again in 1937, and dur- 
 ing the past three years negotiations have taken place between the two countries 
 which have led to the present revisions. 

The first treaty limited the Commission's powers to regulate the fishery 
 by a three-month closed season, and this was ineffective in stemming the decline. 
 Evidence of the success of the Commission's work following the second revision 
 of the Convention is shown in the increase in United States-Canadian halibut 
 landings. The total Canadian-United States catch in 1952 from the areas under 
 regulation was 62,282,000 pounds — the largest catch in 37 years, a pressrelease 
 from the Canadian Department of Fisheries points out. 

The year 1888 marked the beginning of the commercial halibut fishery on the 
 West Coast. The completion that year of transcontinental railroads opened east- 
 ern markets, especially Boston, to Pacific halibut. From a catch of 1,500,000 
 pounds in that year the take increased steadily until 19 08. Approximately 
 50,000,000 pounds annually were taken from then on. 

To achieve this production the industry had to use more efficient equip- 
 ment with bigger and stronger ships. Diesel engines reduced costs considerably 
 so that it was possible to make distant fishing a profitable operation. Even 
 with the increased fishing effort there were fluctuations of millions of pounds 
 from year to year.
