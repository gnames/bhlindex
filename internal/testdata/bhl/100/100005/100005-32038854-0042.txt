COMMERCIAL FISHERIES REVIEW 

Vol. 15, No. 4 

Owing to the character of halibut which live along the ocean bed and be- 
 cause of the uneven bottom of the fishing grounds, ground lines are most effec- 
 tive for halibut fishing. The unit of gear, which is the amount of gear that 
 can be easily operated by one fisherman, is known as a "skate." It consists 
 of six fairly heavy ground lines, each about 50 fathoms long and to each of 
 which, at 13-foot intervals, 5-foot lines are attached which carry a single 
 hook at the end. At one time fishing was conducted from dories but they became 
 outmoded and finally were prohibited in the fishery. With the skate as a meas- 
 ure of efficiency, it was shown that where formerly the average catch per skate 
 was several hundred pounds, the catch had fallen to under a hundred pounds. In 
 addition, where formerly the fishermen were able to get their fish in a 600-mile 
 area, the fishery now covered an area of almost 1,800 miles. 

When the Commission was first established, the fishery had fallen off con- 
 siderably. Evidence of overfishing was apparent. A much greater fishing effort 
 was required to bring in approximately the same amount of fish. It was relative- 
 ly easy to establish a unit of catch as the fishing method was standard through- 
 cut the industry. 

The original purpose of the Commission was to eliminate fishing during the 
 halibut spawning season from November to February and to undertake an intensive 
 investigation into the life history of the halibut. The new treaty concluded 

in 1930 set up regulatory 
 power to rebuild the fishery. 

Since that time the Com- 
 mission has regulated the 
 areas to be fished, changing 
 the quota for each area as 
 seemed advisable at the time. 
 It established nursery areas 
 where fishing was completely 
 prohibited. It set a quota 
 for the entire fisherywhich 
 at present averages about 
 54,000,000 pounds, but it does 
 not interfere with the rate 
 of fishing. 

The International Fish- 
 eries Commission seems to be 
 successfully achieving its 
 purpose â€” the gradual rebuilding of the halibut supply to a higher level of pro- 
 ductivity. The Commission's achievements have shown what can be accomplished 
 when two countries cooperate fully to reach a common goal. 

The question of port privileges has been a considerat 
 sion was first established. Formerly the two Governments 
 legislation each year to renew the agreement. However, in 
 national convention was signed allowing reciprocal port pr 
 fishing vessels on the West Coast. Instruments of ratific 
 in 1950, brought the Convention into force. As a result C 
 States halibut fishermen are assured of yearly reciprocal 
 ing of catches for transshipment, and obtaining supplies, 

ion since the Commis- 
 had to pass enabling 
 March 1950 an inter- 
 ivileges for halibut 
 ation, exchanged later 
 anadian and United 
 privileges in the land- 
 repairs , and equipment.
