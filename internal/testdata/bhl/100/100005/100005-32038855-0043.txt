VIEWS ON DEFINITION OF TERRITORIAL WATERS ; There is currently before the 
 Canadian Parliament, Bill No. 44 (Letter E of the Senate), "An Act to Protect 
 the Coastal Fisheries ," the purpose of which is to completely revise .the pres- 
 ent Customs and Fisheries Protection Act, which has been in effect since 1868 
 and was last revised in 1913. The proposed changes appear chiefly to be direct- 
 ed to providing more adequate definition of what is to be considered a fishing 
 vessel, to define in more detail the authority of Protection Officers, and to 
 extend the authority of the Government to license foreign fishing vessels to en- 
 ter Canadian territorial waters, according to a February 18 U. S. Embassy dis- 
 patch from Ottawa. 

Canadian territorial waters are defined in the new bill as "any waters des- 
 ignated by an Act of the Parliament of Canada or by the Governor in Council as 
 the territorial waters of Canada; or any waters not so designated being within 
 three marine miles of any of the coasts, bays, creeks or harbors of Canada and 
 includes the inland waters of Canada." Under the authority of this provision 
 it would be possible for the Canadian Government, at such time as it might deem 
 opportune, to designate as "Canadian territorial waters" any coastal waters. 
 In the debate in the House, in fact, before the bill was referred to the Stand- 
 ing Committee on Marine and Fisheries, various members expressed the desirabili- 
 ty of extending Canadian territorial waters as far out as possible in order to 
 preserve the inshore fisheries. 

In the subsequent Committee hearings the Canadian Minister of Fisheries 
 emphasized that the Bill gave the Government the power to designate territorial 
 waters but did not alter the practice as to territorial waters . "The practice 
 we have followed is continued," he said, "but it does provide authority to change 
 the practice if it is ever decided by the Government to do so." Some countries, 
 he added, had hastily, perhaps too hastily, attempted to apply the principles 
 which they thought the judgment in the United Kingdom-Norway dispute announced, 
 but the Canadian Government was proceeding more cautiously because of the com- 
 plexity of the problems involved, and had set up an interdepartmental committee 
 to study the implications of the judgment of the Hague Court and the subsequent 
 steps taken since by various countries.
