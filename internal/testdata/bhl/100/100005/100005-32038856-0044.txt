NEWFOUNDLAND'S FROZEN FILLET EXPORTS TO THE UNITED STATES SLUMP : Newfound- 
 land exporters of frozen fillets to the United States report a marked slump in 
 the demand for their products. Large stocks are accumulating in cold-storage 
 plants in St. John's, according to recent Newfoundland press releases. Although 
 stated to be in part seasonal, large shipments to the United States fromlceland 
 and Norway and a decline in United States retail meat prices , have been mainly 
 responsible for this trend in frozen fillets. Reports that the Boston market 
 price of cod fillets has dropped and that there are large stocks of fillets in 
 cold storage in the United States caused some apprehension. Newfoundland ex- 
 vessel prices for fresh haddock and cod have dropped £ Canadian cent a pound. 
 Although the present slump is the most severe ever to hit Newfoundland exporters 
 to the United States market, there is, nevertheless, no good reason to doubt 
 that a recovery can be attained later in the year, points out the St. John's 
 Evening Telegram. 

NEWFOUNDLAND HERRING MARKET WEAK : Herring fishing for this season is now 
 over in the Placentia Bay area; the catch is reported to have been "poor." New- 
 foundland shippers of herring are understood to be having a hard time in dis- 
 posing of their stocks at prices that will allow a small profit or even pay costs . 
 It is reported there are fair stocks of herring on hand. Also, prices are very 
 weak. The first of this season's Norwegian herring pack is scheduled to reach 
 the United States early in March and Norwegian prices are so low that most New- 
 foundland packers cannot compete, according to a February 26 U. S. consular dis- 
 patch from St. John's.

NEW NEWFOUNDLAND FILLETING PLANT PLANNED : The construction of a new fil- 
 leting and freezing plant at Fortune Bay, Newfoundland, was expected to get un- 
 der way late in February, reports a February 20 consular dispatch from St. John's. 
 It is anticipated that construction will be completed in less than 5 months so 
 that production should commence in July. The Government announced that this 
 project would be financed by both Canadian and United States private capital, 
 most of which would come from the United States. 

An eventual annual output of 10 million pounds of frozen fishery products 
 is expected, and a full line is contemplated, including frozen shellfish. A 
 process called "flash freezing" will be used for freezing the fish. The entire 
 output of this Fortune Bay plant will be marketed frozen in the United States by 
 a Georgia firm. 

A subsidiary plant to produce fish meal is also planned. 

This will be the third filleting plant to be established in Newfoundland 
 since early in 1952. One at Fermeuse commenced operations in mid-1952 and has 
 a daily capacity for cutting and freezing 50,000 pounds of fillets (it has al- 
 ready produced as high as 35,000 pounds in an 11-hour shift). Storage capacity 
 of this plant is 2\ million pounds. On November 30, 1952, there were 1,750,000 
 Dounds of frozen fishery products (mostly cod fillets) on hand. A fish-meal pro- 
 ducing plant is to be added to the Fermeuse plant in the future, with a capacity 
 of 5 tons of meal per hour. Filleters are reported to be receiving C$0.82 an 
 hour and general laborers C$0.72 an hour. 

Another plant commenced operation at Gaultois, Hermitage Bay, in the fall of 
 1952. This plant's products are distributed in the United States by a Boston 
 fishery firm.
