FISHERIES ATTACHE TO UNITED STATES TO ENCOURAGE SALE OF FISHERY PRODUCTS : 
 In order to establish contacts to build up a United States market for fishery 
 products, the Danish Ministry of Fisheries on February 28 announced the appoint- 
 ment of Erik Jacobsen to fill the newly-established post of Fisheries Attache 
 in the United States. Primarily he will endeavor to encourage the sale of fro- 
 zen brook trout and fillets, but will also promote the sale of all fishery prod- 
 ucts from Denmark, Greenland, and the Faroe Islands, a March 12 U. S. Embassy 
 dispatch from Copenhagen declares. 

Interviewed by the Danish press on March 1, the new Fisheries Attache em- 
 phasized that he will not be working as a diplomat but primarily as a business- 
 man, helping Danish exporters and producers. He sees his job 2ts temporary, and 
 useful only until Danish exporters have established a foothold in the United 
 States market. 

The office of the new Fisheries Attache will be in New York City at the 
 Building of the Danish Consul General. He is expected to leave for New York 
 City early in April. 

French Morocco 

FISHERIES TRENDS , 1952 : The 1952 fisheries catch for French Morocco was 
 103,000 metric tons as against 83,000 tons in 1951, according to an outline of 
 the present fisheries situation presented by the French Zone Director of Com- 
 merce at a meetingof the Central Fisheries Committee on February 25. The can- 
 neries only absorbed 65,000 tons of the 1952 catch, and the balance went to fish 
 meal and oil plants. 

Canned fish exports to areas outside the French zone continued to drop 
 sharply: 123,000 cases for 1952/53 as against 380,000 for 1951/52. France re- 
 mained a relatively faithful customer, but Portuguese competition was strong in 
 other markets, reports a March 2 U. S. consular dispatch from Tangier. French 
 Morocco will increase its efforts to sell pilchards in the Middle East and Pak- 
 istan at low prices and to open outlets in the Soviet bloc. The French Moroc- 
 can canners are attempting to obtain cheaper oil and tin from France and French 
 West Africa in order to reduce export prices for canned fish to meet competition,, 

Increasing interest is shown in the possibilities for tuna. Reports indi- 
 cate that an exploratory cruise is searching for tuna-fishing areas between Agadir 
 and Cape Verde. 

A letter received from the Director of L'Institut Scientifique des Peches 
 Maritimes du Maroc (Scientific Marine Fisheries Institute of Morocco), referring 
 to the news item which appeared in the October 1952 issue of Commercial Fisheries 
 Review (pp. 61-2), states that a crisis exists in the Moroccan sardine industry. 
 However, this crisis is a result chiefly of marketing difficulties attributed to 
 the high price of Moroccan sardines in oil. As far as the catch of sardines is 
 concerned, there has been a steady increase in recent years. The abundance of 
 sardines in 1952 has resulted in the development of the fish meal and oil indus- 
 try, in addition to the canning industry.
