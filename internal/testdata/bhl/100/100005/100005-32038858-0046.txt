The Institute concludes that the sardine resources off Morocco are quite 
 large and that any change of area for sardines, attributed to hydrological con- 
 ditions, has taken place within the Atlantic zone of Morocco, which is hydro- 
 logically unique. According to the Institute, there has never been any migra- 
 tion of sardines towards Portugal. Besides, the Portuguese have complained in 
 1951 and 1952 of a decline in the sardine fishery.

 men, states a U. S. Embassy dispatch from Tegucigalpa dated February 17. The 
 group arrived in Tegucigalpa recently. The plan calls for a minimum capitali- 
 zation of US$12,500 backed by cash and letters of credit at Tegucigalpa banks

The group is interested in obtaining an exclusive concession to explore the 
 possibility of shrimp fishing on the North Coast for a period of one year, with 
 a permit to increase the period to ten years should shrimping prove feasible. 
 They should not experience much difficulty in obtaining their request due to the 
 fact that there are no commercial fishing companies in Honduras at present. One 
 freezer vessel, now in Costa Rica and two shrimp boats fromCorpus Christi, Texas, 
 are scheduled for use in this venture.
