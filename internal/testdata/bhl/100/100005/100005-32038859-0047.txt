FISHING FLEET INCREASED BY REFUGEE VESSELS FROM COMMUNIST CHINA : Hong 
 Kong's fishing fleet during 1952 increased by 763 vessels. These vessels are 
 alleged to have fled from Chungshan (across from Macau), Communist China, to the 
 various ports in the Colony, reports a January 26 U. S. consular dispatch from 
 Hong Kong. 

JAPANESE TRAWLERS PERMITTED TO LAND FISH : Three Japanese trawlers arrived 
 in the Colony during December with cargoes of fish for the Fish Cooperative Mar-^ 
 ket, despite strenuous objections from local fishermen. These trawlers are fish' 
 ing in nearby Tongking Bay and from time to time two of the Japanese trawlers 
 will be permitted to land their catch at Hong Kong and receive in exchange oil 
 and other supplies of equivalent value. The catch is not to exceed 3Â»000piculs 
 (400,000 pounds) a month or about 12 percent of the average monthly local catch. 
 It is not expected that these landings will cause the local fishing industry 
 serious inconvenience. These vdssels landed mostly snapper and red sea bream; 
 and are expected to augment the supply of fish for Hong Kong's population and 
 help keep prices down. They will also reduce the dependence on supplies of 
 fresh-water fish from the China mainland.

DANISH TRAWLERS FISH SUCCESSFULLY IN INDIAN WATERS : The two Danish trawl- 
 ers bought in 1950 by the West Bengal Government of India have caught about 
 1,500,000 pounds of fish in 37 trips from December 1950 to January 1953, accord- 
 ing to a Calcutta press release ( Amrita Bazar Patrika, February 8). The vessels 
 sailed out of Calcutta and fished in the Bay of Bengal. The catches were con- 
 sidered small as emphasis was placed on experimental and exploratory work in the 
 initial stages. Nevertheless, says the article, the catches per day compared 
 very favorably with those in other well-known fishing grounds of Europe and A- 
 merica. Intensive fishing operations were started after the monsoon in 1952. 
 In addition to the Indian crew and trainees there are four Danish personnel on 
 the fishing staff. 

The catch during the last trip (111,160 pounds) was the highest even though 
 the number of days spent in actual fishing was the lowest. The total catch No- 
 vember 1952-January 1953 was 410, 08A pounds as against 1,123,122 pounds during the 
 previous 23 months. 

Consumers in Calcutta "seem" to be gradually "becoming more accustomed to 
 sea fish." The ocean fish is sold in a number of shops in Calcutta and Howrah 
 and is handled by a Government agent, reports a February 12 U. S. consular dis- 
 patch from Calcutta. 

INDO-JAPANKgE JOINT FISHING COMPANY PLANNED IN BOMBAY : A joint fishing 
 company with headquarters in Bombay is being planned between a Bombay firm and 
 a Tokyo firm, according to a Bombay press report ( Evening News of India . Febru- 
 ary 2). Negotiations are now under way. 

It is reported that both firms will have equal interests in the proposed 
 new company. It is expected that in the initial stages the operations will be
