restricted to the Bombay coast but later be expanded to cover the entire Indian 
 coast. The Japanese firm has a trawler, Taiyo Maru No . 17 . currently engaged 
 in deep-sea fishing off the Bombay and Saurashtra coasts. 

The first stage of the negotiations was carried on in Bombay. A represent- 
 ative of the Indian firm is now in Japan and will continue the negotiations, a 
 February 11 U. S. consular dispatch from Bombay points out.

AID TO FISHING FLEET ; The Italian Government plans to assist the fishing 
 fleet in the conversion of 2,600 vessels from gasoline engines to Diesel pro- 
 pulsion, reports the February 1953 World Fishing , a British trade magazine. To 
 insure that the plan will be carried out, the Government will provide each boat 
 credit up to 1.5 million lire (US$2, 400) at a low rate of interest and a long 
 period of amortization. 

SICILIAN FISHERIES : Imports Threaten Domestic Industry : Increased imports 
 of canned fish from Japan and Peru will cause a grave crisis in the Sicilian fish- 
 ing industry, according to an official of the Sicilian Regional Ministry of Fish- 
 eries. Recent trade treaties signed by Italy with both these countries allow 
 for increased Italian imports of canned fish in exchange for o th er products . The 
 amount envisioned in both treaties, plus the fish imports under the terms of 
 present agreements with other countries, could total about 6 or 7 times the avâ€” 
 erage Italian annual consumption of fish, according to the official quoted. There 
 is considerable criticism of the Central Government in Sicily because of these 
 new treaties and the Regional Government has gone on record in Rome against the 
 new trade agreements, reports a January 30 U. S. consular dispatch from Palermo. 

Sicily's fishing interests have strongly advocated that only needed quanti- 
 ties of fish be imported to cover the normal demand of the Italian market. They 
 are demanding high tariff barriers on canned fish to keep the price of imports 
 safely out of the price range of domestic fish. The Federation of Sicilian In- 
 dustries, in fact, protested against a recent importation from Japan of 1,250 
 cases of canned fish classified as "tuna," which instead turned out to be "pala- 
 mito," said to be somewhat similar to tuna but of an inferior quality to that of 
 the domestic tuna marketed here. 

It is reported that Sicilian manufacturers of canned fish products have 
 marketed less than 12 percent of their latest production, due to the fact that 
 dealers and outlets are still heavily stocked with these products. As a result 
 of this lag some producers who had borrowed money from banks have been unable to 
 reimburse the amounts of their loans and are in a serious and difficult position. 
 This critical situation has come about even though the effect of the above-men- 
 tioned new trade treaties has not yet been felt. 

Tuna Fishing : The tuna-fishing season which ended in June 1952 was a very 
 poor one, both because the total catch was small and because the average size of 
 fish was smaller than the standard for canning. Unfavorable weather conditions 
 during the last six months of 1952 hampered fishing operations.
