Fishing Legislation : Discussions have been held on a proposed law to set up 
 in the more important Sicilian fishing centers offices for the purpose of coordi- 
 nating matters involving the fishing industry, and to obtain more accurate data re- 
 garding the catch and canning production. Present statistics are incomplete and in- 
 accurate and appear to be one of the important reasons why the Italian Government 
 negotiated the impugned import treaties with Japan and Peru. The Government was un- 
 der the impression that Italian production would merelybe supplemented, rather than 
 swamped, by these imports â€ž 

The Sicilian Regional Gazette of October 24, 1952, contains Law No. 50, in the 
 interests of individual fishermen and fishing companies and cooperatives , the mem- 
 bers of which have their residence and exercise their activities on the Island of 
 Sicily. Special credits are granted persons in these categories: 

(1) For the purchase of newly-built motor fishing boats of not less than 20 
 and not more than 40 tons gauge.. 

(2) For equipping with engines, modernizing, and repairing any type of fish- 
 ing boats. 

(3) For purchasing equipment which is part of the motor fishing boats , includ- 
 ing nets, lamps, and other instruments allowed by law, as well as fittings which 
 permit the detection of fishing banks, and the installation of wireless transmitters. 

(4) For installation of equipment to conserve fish on board. 

(5) For setting up storerooms to preserve the fish and to transfer it to ap- 
 propriate warehouses which should also have sufficient space for the necessary 
 fishing boat supplies as well as other assistance to the fishing industry, includ- 
 ing means of sea or land transportation to forward fish in refrigerated trucks or 
 boats. 

Financial aid is planned to the extent of 30 percent of the prospective expense 
 if it is established to be in accordance with the correct cost, but not to exceed 
 the amount of 5 million lire (US$80, 000) if it involves an individual fisherman or 
 associated fishermen, and not to exceed 50 percent of the expenses up to the amount 
 of 8 million lire (US$130,000) for fishing cooperatives.

FROZEN COOKED TUNA LOINS EXPORTED TO U. S. FOR CANNING : For the past year Ja- 
 pan has been exporting experminental lots of frozen cooked albacore tuna loins to 
 the United States. This product has been processed by canners along the west coast 
 of the United States into canned white meat tuna, with a large percentage packed as 
 chunk style. The canned yield is about 112 cases (48 No. 1/2 tuna cans packed with 
 5^ oz. of meat) per short ton. 

In Japan the loins are prepared from albacore which have been beheaded, gutted, 
 and cooked for 30 minutes (depending on size). Then the tail and fins are removed, 
 the fish are skinned, and four fillets are cut from the backbone. After removing or 
 trimming off the dark meat, the fillets are frozen 3 to 4 hours (depending on size) 
 until glazed. Each fillet is finally wrapped in parchment paper and packed in paper 
 or wooden boxes, 50 pounds to the box. Recovery of loins from whole fish is esti- 
 mated at 30 to 40 percent.
