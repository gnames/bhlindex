48 COMMERCIAL FISHERIES REVIEW Vol. 15, No. 4 

Exports through January 1953 totaled about 225 short tons. The price f.o.b. 
 Japan is reported about US$700 per short ton. At present Japanese plants are not 
 equipped to produce frozen cooked loins for export in commercial quantities, re- 
 ports a February 13 U. S. Embassy dispatch from Tokyo. They are lacking in freez- 
 ing equipment . 

Some experimental export shipments of frozen raw yellowfin tuna loins have al- 
 so been reported. In addition, there was a sample shipment of a few cases of fro- 
 zen precooked albacore tuna hand packed in open half-pound tuna cans. The tuna was 
 not processed nor hermetically sealed. It was shipped to the United States for com- 
 plete processing and the addition of salt and oil. 

TUNA FISHERY PLANS FOR 1953 : Mothership Tuna Fishing : Tentative plans for 
 Japanese mothership tuna-fishing operations in 1953 provide for three fleets, re- 
 ports a March 3 U. S. Embassy dispatch from Tokyo. Information obtained from news 
 items and other Japanese sources indicate these fleets will consist of: 

(1) Mothership Tenyo Maru (10,000 gross tons) with 30 catcher boats; catch 
 target approximately 16,400,000 pounds in two trips from May through No- 
 vember . 

(2) Mothership Settsu Maru (10,000 gross tons) with 20 to 30 catcher boats; 
 catch target 8,400,000 pounds. 

(3) Mothership Ginka Maru (3,000 gross tons) with 10 to 15 catcher boats; 
 catch target not announced. Some sources state this fleet may not mate- 
 rialize partly because of the excessive cost of converting the Ginka Maru 
 to a tuna mothership. 

The fleets are expected to concentrate on yellowfin tuna in equatorial regions, 
 including the Solomon Islands where good results were obtained by one fleet in 1952. 

Construction of Large Tuna Boats Planned : Construction of new large tuna boats 
 is being planned for 1953. At least 15 and possibly 20 boats (320 gross tons each) 
 are expected to be financed wholly or in part by the Japanese Government. These boats 
 would be suitable for fishing tne more distant tuna grounds from Hawaii southward 
 to the equator and off northeast Australia. Many of the present Japanese tuna boats 
 are less than 150 gross tons. The proposed 1953 construction of the larger tuna boats 
 will supplement that of 10 similar boats in 1952. 

Cooperative Sales System for Frozen Tuna : A cooperative sales system for fro- 
 zen tuna for export to the United States is being discussed in Japanese fishing cir- 
 cles. A number of the leading producers believe that such a system should be pat- 
 terned after the Tokyo Canned Tuna Sales Company which handles most of the sales of 
 canned tuna by the canners to exporters. This company was organized in May 1952. 
 Its principal purpose is to assist in stabilizing exports, avoid adverse effects in 
 foreign markets , and prevent "dumping," excessive price-cutting, and other undesir- 
 able features of competitive trade. Proponents of the cooperative system for the 
 sale of frozen tuna feel it would give support to the existing Japanese Government 
 controls on exports of frozen tuna to the United States by: (l) checking and pre- 
 venting three-way trading by some Japanese exporters selling to Canada for reship- 
 ment to the United States, and (2) checking and preventing exporters from rebating 
 on sales to offset Government check prices on exports to the United States.
