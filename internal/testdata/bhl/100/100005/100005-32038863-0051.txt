Tuna Exports to United States : The Japanese Government on February 16 increas- 
 ed the quota of frozen tuna exports to the United States by 3,000 short tons — from 
 18,000 short tons to 21,000 tons for the period ending March 31, 1953. Applications 
 for allocations of the additional 3,000 short tons closed on February 18 and total- 
 ed 8,800 tons. Allocation of the 3,000 short tons was prorated to 23 applicants. 
 United States demand for canned tuna is not as brisk as for the frozen product. It 
 is reported that the recent increase in the quota for frozen tuna is from6,000 tons 
 of tuna officially set aside in September 1952 for an anticipated rise in the quota 
 for canned tuna. At that time the quota on frozen tuna was raised from 12,000 to 
 18,000 tons, but the canned set-aside was not utilized for raising the quota for 
 canned tuna. Hence, a decision has been made by the Government to utilize it in 
 equal portions to the exporters of frozen and canned tuna, i.e., 3,000 tons of fro- 
 zen tuna (or the equivalent of 150,000 cases of canned tuna, which was the amount 
 by which the quota for canned tuna exports to the United States was raised on Feb— 
 ruary 16 — from 1,000,000 cases t o 1,150,000 cases). 
 note: the united states export quota for frozen tuna has been reported in both metric and 

short tons, but recent information indicates that the quota has always been reported by the 

japanese government on a short-ton basis.

2 million pounds and US$1.2 million less than in 1951, due to increased competition 
 from Peruvian swordfish on the United States markets, states a U. S. Embassy dis- 
 patch from Tokyo dated February 27. Japanese swordfish exporters expect an upward 
 trend in trade with the United States in 1953 because of 3ome evidence of increased 
 consumer demand for this type of product.
