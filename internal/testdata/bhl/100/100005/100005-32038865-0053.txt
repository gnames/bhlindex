COMMERCIAL FISHERIES REVIEW

The 1952 expedition was operated jointly by the same three large fishing com- 
 panies which will engage in the 1953 expedition. In 1953, each of the three fleets 
 will be operated independently by each company. The 1952 operation was financial- 
 ly profitable, with much of the catch being consumed in Japan, especially as salt- 
 ed fish during the fall and winter months and in the New Year holiday season. 

JAPANESE-AUSTRALIAN FISHERIES TREATY TALKS PROPOSED : Talks for a Japanese- 
 Australian fisheries treaty were recently proposed by the Australian Government, 
 according to a Japanese press release ( The Mainichi , February 19) supplied by the 
 U. S. Embassy at Tokyo. The talks were proposed for sometime in April in Australia. 
 The proposal also requested Japan to suspend the pearl-shell fishing expedition 
 which was scheduled to sail to the Arafura Sea north of Australia sometime in March. 
 It is believed that this expedition prompted the Australian Government to make the 
 proposal. 

Under Article 9 of the San Francisco Peace Treaty Japan agreed to "enter prompt- 
 ly into negotiations with Allied Powers so desiring for the conclusion of bilateral 
 and multilateral agreements providing for the regulation or limitation of fishing 
 and the conservation and development of fisheries on the High Seas." 

There are two reasons why Japan has delayed a reply to this proposal: 

1. Japan would like to hold the negotiations in Tokyo, because it is more eco- 
 nomical, and because it wants its fisheries experts close at home to handle the prob- 
 lems that constantly arise in this vital Japanese industry. 

2. Considering the fact that preliminary negotiations for the reopening of 
 deadlocked Japan-Republic of Korea treaty talks is now in progress, a priority should 
 be given to the Korean talks rather than to the Australian proposal.

At present most of the shrimp shipped to the United States is jumbo size (under 
 15 count) and shippers receive 95 U. 3. cents per pound (about US$2,100 per metric 
 ton) f.o.b. New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles. Processing and shipping costs amount 
 to 16 U. S. cents per pound (about US$350 per metric ton). The processors pay 53 
 U.S. cents per pound (US$1,163 per metric ton) ex-vessel and realize a profit of ap- 
 proximately 26 U. S. cents per pound (US$590 per metric ton).
