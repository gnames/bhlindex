52 COMMERCIAL FISHERIES REVIEW Vol. 15, No. 4 

Sinaloa shrimp exports to the United States in January totaled 1,013,049 pounds — 
 a decrease of 6 percent when compared with December 1952 and 13 percent less than 
 in January 1952 (see table). 

GUAYMAS SHRIMP PRODUCTION CONTINUES TO DECLINE : Shrimp production at Guaymas 
 continued to dwindle during January and boat owners reported their catches by kilos 
 rather than by tons , reports a February 6 U. S. consular dispatch from Guaymas. The 
 total January production of little more than 200 metric tons marked a new monthly 
 low in West Coast shrimping. This figure is less than one third of the total landed 
 during any January at the height of the boom, and is 50 tons under December's mea- 
 ger catch. 

As the catch became lighter, boat owners sent their vessels as far south as 
 Salina Cruz on the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in search of the disappearing shrimp. A 
 few craft fishing in the Gulf of Tehuantepec caught from 3 to 4 metric tons of shrimp, 
 but the modest spurt failed to create optimism as it would have earlier in the season. 

A few Guaymas shrimpers are considering the conversion of their craft to tuna 
 clippers, a type of vessel from which a few of the shrimp boats were originally 
 converted. However, it is believed installation of bait tanks and auxiliary ma- 
 chinery would prove too expensive for the majority of the hard-pressed shrimpers; 
 neither would credit be forthcoming. 

The larger shrimp operators were granted a considerable measure of financial 
 relief during January when the Mexican Government granted them a moratorium on the 
 5-million pesos (US$578, 000 ) loaned shrimp operators at the beginning of the 1951/ 
 52 season. The moratorium was granted with the understanding that interest pay- 
 ments on the loan would be brought up to date and maintained, and that insurance 
 premiums would not be permitted to lapse. Otherwise, boat owners not financially 
 able to meet these conditions presumably would have their vessels and equipment 
 attached by the Government. It is widely believed that many of the more marginal 
 operators will be forced out of the industry by the interest and insurance payment 
 requirements. The moratorium is to extend to December 31, 1954. 

One-half of the Guaymas shrimping fleet left Guaymas during February for Salina 
 Cruz, Oaxaca, to fish in the Pacific off the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. Catches there 
 have been described as "fair," but it is not expected that the boat operators will 
 have a good year, reports a March 3 U. S„ consular dispatch from Guaymas. Shrimp 
 taken off Salina Cruz are being landed there and shipped directly to Mexico City 
 and El Paso, Texas. This practice will probably keep most of the freezing and pack- 
 ing plants at Guaymas closed. 

Some boats have ventured as far as the Pacific coast of Baja California. Fish- 
 ing at such distances from the home port (1,000 miles and more) reducethe operators' 
 margin of profit drastically. At present it is estimated that this year's shrimp 
 catch by the Guaymas fleet will be about 30 percent less than in the 1951/52 sea- 
 son when 3,455 metric tons were landed. Last year was considered very poor in com- 
 parison with the 1949/50 and 1950/51 seasons when over 5,000 tons of shrimp were 
 landed in each season. Since Guaymas depends heavily on the shrimp catch for its 
 livelihood, this is a serious financial and economic problem for the city. 

Local newspapers in Guaymas, Ciudad Obregon, and Navojoa have joined the Mex- 
 ican press in other parts of the country in giving heavy and sensational coverage 
 to the operations of what they term "pirate" American shrimp boats off the east 
 coast of Mexico. They have demanded that the Mexican Government use any and all
