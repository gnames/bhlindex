SPINY LOBSTER AD- VALOREM EXPORT TAX REDUCED : The ad-valorem tax on exports 
 of fresh, cooked, or refrigerated spiny lobster from Mexico was reduced by the Mex- 
 ican Government from 15 percent to 3-3?4 percent, retroactive to January 1 this year 
 and to expire December 30, 1953. This action was announced by an Acuerdo publish- 
 ed in the Diario Oficial on February 23, and signed by the President of Mexico. The 
 specific duty of 0.03 ccntavos per gross kilogram plus 10 percent additional listed 
 under Fraction 11-10 remains unchanged. 

The reduction, according to the Acuerdo . was made in view of the serious com- 
 petition from North African and Australian spir.y lobster exporters, as well as in- 
 creased costs of production and the low price prevailing in consuming centers. 

All firms who channel their spiny lobster exports through the Banco Nacional 
 de Foment o Cooperativo, S. A. de C. V., or under its authorization, are granted the 
 reduction, according to a U. 3. Embassy dispatch from Mexico City dated February 26Â»

NEW FISHERY-TYPE " ASDIC " TESTED ON COMMERCIAL HERRING VESSEL : A new fishery- 
 type ASDIC, which registers herring schools at a distance of 1,000 meters (about 
 3,280 feet) was tested recently by personnel of the Norwegian Directorate of Fish- 
 eries on the commercial fishing vessel Ramoen . reports the January 4 Fiskaren . a 
 Norwegian fishery magazine. Tests were made on the herring fishing grounds, and it 
 is hoped this new ASDIC will prove practicable for the fishing fleet. The civil en- 
 gineer who was on board the Ramoen during the tests said: "We are well pleased with 
 the tests we made so far. We registered herring up to a distance of 1,000 meters 
 and many times had good contacts." 

In previous tests on the Norwegian fishery research vessel G. 0. Sars . contact 
 with herring schools was made at distances up to 2,000 meters (6,560 feet ) , but at 
 this distance an observer who has experience in herring detection is required, re- 
 ports Finn Devoid, Norwegian fishery scientist. 

The captain of the Ramoen says that ASDIC can also be used for vertical regis- 
 tering and is unsurpassed when compared with the usual echo sounder. It is simpler 
 in construction and takes less space than other types of ASDIC. It now must be de- 
 termined if this newtype is of sufficient value for use by the largest fishing vessels. 

The ASDIC equipment installed in the fishing vessel Ramoen is a prototype of a 
 commercial model, reports a March 3 U. S. Embassy dispatch from Oslo. This equip- 
 ment was constructed and tested at the laboratory of the ASDIC section of the Nor- 
 wegian Defense Research Establishment, and was installed in the fishing vessel for 
 final tests. The equipment is not yet available. However, production rights have 
 been granted to an electronics firm in Oslo. The total electrical power require- 
 ment for operation of the equipment is approximately 350 watts, 220 V, 110 V, or 24 V
