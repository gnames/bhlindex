HERRING CUTTING MACHINE : A new herring cutting machine built in Aalesund, Nor- 
 way, by Per Borch Olsen, that is reported to have increased capacities and cut op- 
 erating costs, has been well received in the Aalesund and Bergen districts. The 
 machine is fed by hand and has a normal capacity of 180 herring per minute, or 20 
 barrels per hour. It costs between kr. 3,000 and 4,000 (US$420 to 560) ; a Swedish 
 machine that has been used to date costs kr. 25,000 (US$3,500). A similar machine 
 for use on Norwegian fishing vessels that fish for Icelandic herring is also under 
 construction by the inventor, according to the February 11 Fiskaren , a Norwegian 
 trade publication. 

BLOCK FREEZING OF BAIT IN ALGINATE GELATIN : A promising method for block freez- 
 ing of bait in an alginate gelatin has been tested by a Drammen, Norway, firm. The 
 method appears suitable for preserving bait over long periods of time. It is re- 
 ported to hinder the bait from breaking up and to protect it from rancidity. Tests 
 at the Industry Laboratory in Kristiansund and during practical trials in the Green- 
 land fishery showed promising results. Additional tests will be made this winter 
 at various freezers under the direction of the inventor, Alf Olsen. 

WINTER " LARGE HERRING " FISHERY : Catch For 1953 Season : The 1953 winter "large 
 herring" fishery season came to an official close on February 15 with a total catch 
 of 559,000 metric tons, states a February 18 U.S. Embassy dispatch from Oslo. Thus, 
 in spite of a late start and unusually stormy weather during the first part of the 
 season, the 1952 "large herring" catch of 549,000 metric tons was exceeded, but the 
 record catch of 648,000 metric tons in 1951 was not reached. 

The herring did not arrive at the regular locations until January 27, about 
 two weeks late, due to the poor weather and the fact that the herring remained deep 
 in the water. However, in a two-week period, starting the first of February, her- 
 ring were scooped out of the sea at an average rate of about 37,000 metric tons per 
 day, an intensity never before equalled in the history of Norwegian fishing. An 
 all-time record for a single day's catch, set on February 3 (65,000 metric tons), 
 was exceeded on February 7 when over 93,000 metric tons were landed between Aalesund 
 and Floro in a 24-hour period. 

The vessels knew exactly where to go when they set off for the herring grounds. 
 The areas of maximum fish concentration had been pin-pointed by scientists on the 
 research vessel G. 0. Sars and promptly relayed to the fishermen by radiotelephone. 

It is hoped that the Norwegian winter herring fishery ( comprising "large herring" 
 and "spring herring") this year may live up to the high budgetary estimates prepared 
 before the start of the season â€” 884,000 metric tons or the same as was caught in 1951. 

The excellent results obtained during the last two weeks of the "large herring" 
 season are attributed partly to the larger number of fishing craft participating and 
 partly to the wider use of electronic devices, and in spite of the unfavorable water 
 temperatures and weather. 

The importance to the Norwegian economy of this favorable turn of events will 
 be seen when it is remembered that in 1952 the winter herring catch accounted for 
 almost 5 percent of Norway's foreign exchange earnings from exports (excluding ships) . 

U.S.. Herring-Fishing Techniques Unsuccessful : A Norwegian fisheries expert 
 has indicated that these three fishing techniques developed in the United States had 
 been tried in Norway with unsatisfactory results:
