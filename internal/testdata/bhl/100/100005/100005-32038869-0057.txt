April 1953 COMMERCIAL FISHERIES REVIEW 55 

1. The use of nylon purse seines. The Norwegian winter herring 

are so lively that several nylon seines were lost by a trap- 
 ped school suddenly diving; ordinary seines break under the 
 impact and can be mended, but nylon nets, being too strong, 
 are carried away at such times. 

2. The use of Auction hoses to bring herring aboard from the 

seine. The dip-net method is faster and less harsh. 

3. The use of the seiners themselves rather than dories to make 

the "cast" of the purse seine. The dory method is more 
 flexible and better adapted to the crowded conditions on 
 the Norwegian herring banks. 

Operation of Herring Sales Organization : The same fisheries expert explained 
 the function of the herring sales organization (Norges Sildesalslag) , which has been 
 in operation for the past 25 years. Before, confusion and uncertainty had hampered 
 fishing operations during the best part of the season. Now, as each ship completes 
 its catch of herring it radios the nearest office of the organization giving its lo- 
 cation, speed, amount of catch, and other pertinent information. The office is then 
 able' to direct each returning vessel to the place (or places) where it should dis- 
 charge its cargo. The organization maintains an equalization fund so that fisher- 
 men get the same price no matter to whom they sell their catch. At the same time, 
 herring meal plants do not pay as much for their raw material as do, for instance, 
 freezing plants. Freezing plants take only the top layer of herring from each ship, 
 leaving the rest (which is slightly older and more crushed) to the salting plants 
 and meal and oil factories. 

Prices For 1953 Season : The prices received by the winter herring fishermen 
 this season have been 18.50 kroner per hectoliter (1.3 U.S. cents per pound) for 
 "large herring" caught before February 15,1953j and 15.50 kroner per hectoliter 
 (1.1 U.S. cents per pound) for "spring herring" caught after that date. The Norwe- 
 gian Price Directorate has also established a complex system of prices to be paid dur- 
 ing different parts of the season by different classes of processors. The reason 
 for lower prices duringthe latter part of the season isthat the herring when they 
 first arrive off the coast of Norway are extremely fat and full of roe and milt. 
 By the end of the season, after they have spawned and are ready to go back to sea, 
 the herring are lean and less valuable both as a food and as an industrial raw ma- 
 terial. February 15 has been set arbitrarily as the last day of the "large her- 
 ring" season each year. 

Composition of Herring Fleet : The Norwegian herring fleet is composed prima- 
 rily of two types of fishing vessels â€” drift gill netters and purse seiners. The 
 former are smaller and less complex. Although they are in the majority, they ac- 
 count for a smaller proportion of the catch than do the seiners. Furthermore, her- 
 ring caught in drift nets are of lower quality because while being removed from the 
 nets they often become damaged. However, drift netters are at an advantage when the 
 herring are too deep in the water or too elusive to be caught by purse seines. As 
 the season progresses, a drift-net fisherman can put out more and more nets, since 
 the herring become sluggish and are less likely to swim off. A total of 600 large 
 purse seiners and 2,500 drift gill netters, manned by about 30,000 fishermen, oper- 
 ated this year. 

Both the purse seiners (which average 300-400 metric tons of herring a set) and 
 the drift netters (with a daily catch of about 40 tons) make use of echo depth sound- 
 ers to spot the exact location of the schools. Some of the larger vessels are also 
 equipped with sonar. At the present time, nearly 3,000 echo depth sounders are in-
