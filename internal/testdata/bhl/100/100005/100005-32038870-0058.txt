stalled aboard Norwegian fishing vessels. Also, all of the larger and many of the 
 smaller craft feature radiotelephone. 

Pearl Essence Factory Closes : A pearl essence factory, built a few seasons 
 ago by private United States capital, which used scales from the freezing plants, 
 was closing this year because of the extremely poor world market situation. It 
 would sell its present stock, hoping for an improvement next year. The herring 
 scales, which form the basic raw material, are saved by the freezing plants dur- 
 ing the initial washing process.

NEW COD FISHING METHOD TESTED : A new method for catching cod by long lines 
 was tested recently on the Newfoundland and Greenland banks by the Portuguese ves- 
 sel S. Ruy , according to the February 1953 World Fishing , a British fishery maga- 
 zine. Dories were replaced by powered Danish-made pine-and-oak boats similar to 
 powered whaleboats. The boats, with a length of 20 feet, a beam of 6feet lOinches, 
 and a depth of 3 feet, are equipped with a 10 hp. engine and a variable-pitch pro- 
 peller. They have a capacity for 3,960 pounds of fish. 

The boats use three different types of lines. For fishing in depths of about 
 30 fathoms or less, a main line 5,250 fathoms long with 10,500 hooks tied to gangions 
 or branch lines spaced 3 feet apart is used. The gear for depths between 30 to 100 
 fathoms is 10,800 fathoms long with 7,200 hooks and the same number of gangions. On 
 the edge of the fishing banks in depths over 100 fathoms, a 12,600-fathom line with 
 4,200 hooks attached to gangions spaced 3 fathoms apart is used. 

In setting the line, the "iron" and attached buoy are thrown overboard first. 
 Then, as the boat sails, the rest of the gear is thrown out as the fishermen bait 
 the hooks. The line is hauled back aboard by a small line hauler with two horizon- 
 tal pulleys operated by the engine and a line roller. 

Advantages of this new method are primarily in the increased fishing range from 
 the mothership and reduced danger for the fishermen. Further, it would permit the 
 exploitation of deeper fishing banks where it is impossible to haul lines by hand. 

Thailand 

STATUS OF THE FISHERIES , 1950 : Catch : The total estimated catch of fresh- and 
 salt-water fish in Thailand during 1950 amounted to 158,000 metric tons, a slight in- 
 crease over the 154,000 metric tons landed in 1949 (table l), reports a January 12 
 U.S. Embassy dispatch from Bangkok. 

Byproducts : The manufacture of fishery byproducts is practically unknown in 
 Thailand. Some fish meal is produced by primitive methods, but the output is negli- 
 gible. There is no fish-oil industry at present. The Department of Fisheries re- 
 ports that the Ministry of Health is actively considering a project for the extrac- 
 tion of shark-liver oil. 

Consumption : Fish consumption by Thailand inhabitants is estimated by the Di- 
 rector-General of the Department of Fisheries at 18 kilograms (39.6 pounds) a year
