BOX-WASHING MACHINE USED IN SCOTLAND ; Mechanized washing of dirty fish boxes 
 has been pioneered in Scotland by a trawler-owner and fish salesman in his modern- 
 ized plant at The Shore, Grant on. The machine can wash about 1,000 used fish boxes 
 per day, reports the January 17 issue of The Fishing News , a British trade period- 
 ical. Built by a well-known British washing-machine manufacturer, it is the first 
 machine of its kind in Scotland. 

The 
 of processes 

dirty box travels through the washer mechanically, is subjected to a series 
 and emerges thoroughly cleaned at the delivery end. The washing rou- 
 tine is pre-rinse, detergent, and a very hot 
 spray. The box emerges so hot that it dries 
 quickly. Truckloads of dirty boxes are run up 
 to the mouth of the washer and are fed from the 
 truck platform into the machine by hand. An 
 operator at the delivery end examines the wash- 
 ed boxes, checks for defects, and puts clean, 
 whole boxes on a gravity-roller conveyor run- 
 ning at right-angles to the machine. At the 
 end of the gravity run the box is picked up by 
 an elevated rubber conveyor, which takes it to 
 loading bank level. 

Boxmakers and box-pool operators from oth- 
 er Scottish ports have visited the installation 
 at Granton, which also does box washing for a number of other trawler-owners.

NEW FISH OIL-EXTRACTION PROCESS DEVELOPED : A British firm recently developed 
 a new process for extracting oils and fats from naturally occurring cellular mate- 
 rials. These include fish and fish-liver oils. The practical application of the 
 process to these fishery products is being actively investigated, reports the Feb- 
 ruary 1953 World Fishing , a British trade magazine. 

The new method is known as the Chayen cold-rendering process after its chief 
 inventor. It dispenses with heat, which has hitherto been necessary in some form 
 in all rendering processes, and eliminates the inevitable waste and degradation of 
 the products due to heat. 

In fact, this new process is based on the principle of impulse rendering, which 
 consists of passing the raw material, suitably cut up and suspended in a continuous 
 stream of cold water, through a vessel in which the water is subjected to mechani- 
 cal impulses of high speed and frequency. This has the effect of shattering the cell 
 walls and instantly removing their oil or fat content. 

For fish and fish-liver oils, the apparatus is clean and compact, and the pro- 
 duct is of extremely high purity. By the same token, the yield of a fish-meal plant 
 run in conjunction with this new impulse renderer would also be of very high quali- 
 ty. The potentialities of the new process for use aboard trawlers and fish factory- 
 ships are obvious, especially in view of the fact that sea water canbeused for the 
 feed. In fact, according to the manufacturers of the equipment, sea water may have 
 advantages over fresh water for this application.
