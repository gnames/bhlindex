 British fishermen will be denied fishing privileges in a 400-mile coastal fishing 
 area in the Barents and White Seas off the northern coast of Russia commencing in 
 June 1953* The Russian Government recently gave the required 6-months 1 notice to 
 end the Angle— Soviet fisheries agreement. This agreement, signed in May 1930, was 
 to run until either party gave 6-months ' notice of termination. It allowed United 
 Kingdom-registered fishing vessels to fish between 3 and 12 miles from northern U.S.S.R. 
 coasts and their dependent islands. The agreement was intended as an interim meas- 
 ure before the conclusion of a mutually-desired formal convention, reports the Jan-
