DEFENSE MATERIALS SYSTEM TO REPLACE CONTROLLED MATERIALS PLAN : A new materi- 
 als control system, limited to assuring deliveries of enough steel, copper, andaluâ€” 
 minum for the Department of Defense and the Atomic Energy Commission, was announced 
 by the National Production Authority on March 23. Subject to Congressional exten- 
 sion of Title I of the Defense Production Act, the Defense Materials System will 
 govern the defense distribution of the three metals after July 1, 1953, following 
 the June 30 expiration of the more embracing Controlled Materials Plan (CMP). Un- 
 der CMP, the Government has been allocating all steel, copper, and aluminum not only 
 for defense purposes, but also for the entire civilian economy. Under DMS, the Gov- 
 ernment steps out of the civilian side of the materials control picture. 

The National Production Authority simultaneously announced that, effective March 
 23, 1953. controlled materials producers may accept unrated orders for steel, copper, 
 and aluminum for delivery after June 30. However, continuing heavy military demands 
 for nickel-bearing stainless steel require maintaining control of this material for 
 use in both the civilian and military economy after July 1. CMP allotment authori- 
 ty for this material is continued for the third calendar quarter of 1953*

POLICY ON PURCHASES OF FISHERY PRODUCTS : The Quartermaster Corps recently issu- 
 ed a statement on the general policy of the Department of Defense in purchasing fish- 
 ery products for the United States Armed Forces. The statement points out that in 
 accordance with the provisions of the Department of Defense Appropriation Act 1953 
 and the Buy-American Act, the Quartermaster Corps does not procure fishery products 
 from foreign sources for feeding Armed Forces personnel in the United States. Over- 
 seas commands are permitted to procure fishery products for Armed Forces personnel 
 only when the source of supply is indigenous to their command.
