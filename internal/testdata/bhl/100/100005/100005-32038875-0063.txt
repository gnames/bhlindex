. PRICE CONTROLS END : The lifting of all remaining price controls was announc- 
 ed by the Office of Price Stabilization on March 17. This means that there are no 
 price controls on any commodities (including fishery products and byproducts) or 
 services at any level of distribution. 

In Amendment 1 to General Overriding Regulation 44, OPS exempted from price 
 control all sales of all commodities and services. The exemption is applicable in 
 the Continental United States, in the Territories and Possessions, and in the Com- 
 monwealth of Puerto Rico. 

This action is the seventh and final step in compliance with the President's 
 direction for orderly termination of price controls 

Previously, over a period of several weeks beginning February 6, 1953, OPS had 
 issued orders gradually removing from price control a wide range of commodities and 
 services. On March 12, the agency issued General Overriding Regulation 44, which 
 removed price control from all commodities and services except a limited number of 
 items in the chemical and industrial materials field. 

OPS officials emphasized that this latest order has no effect on standing re- 
 quirements calling for the preservation of records of past transactions for speci- 
 fied periods. Business firms need not make or keep records on future transactions 
 but must keep available for inspection whatever records were required by the regu- 
 lations under which they formerly operated. April 30, 1955, has been specified as 
 the latest date beyond which records need not be retained. The period of retention 
 may be shorter for certain businesses and certain records. For detailed information 
 on records-preservation requirements, businessmen are advised to consult the regu- 
 lations which have been covering them. 

For details see: Amdt. 1 (Termination of Price Controls) to GOR 44 (General 
 Exemptions and Preservation of Records) and news release OPS-GPR-1750, both dated 
 March 17, 1953.

FISH MEAL , SCRAP , AND SOLUBLES REMOVED FROM PRICE CONTROL : Price ceilings were 
 lifted from all commodities remaining under control except for a small selected list 
 of items. Among the groups of items freed from controls on March 12 by the sixth in 
 a series of orders carrying out the President's directive for orderly elimination of 
 price controls were soybeans and animal feeds. According to information received 
 from OPS, this action decontrols all marine feeds (fish meal, fish scrap, fish sol- 
 ubles , etc . ) and revokes CPR 39 . 

Because of the relatively small number of commodities remaining under price con- 
 trol, this latest order takes the form of a single overriding regulation (GOR 44) 
 providing that sales of all commodities and services in the Continental United States 
 are exempt except those specifically listed as subject to ceilings. There are no 
 fishery products o'r byproducts among the commodities listed as still subject to ceil- 
 ings. 

Still in effect as far as fishery products are concerned is CPR 51 which estab- 
 lishes ceiling prices for salted cod sales in Puerto Rico.
