GOR 44 also specifies that records required under ceiling price regulations 
 need not be preserved after April 30, 1955. This latest clarification regarding 
 the keeping of records spells out the requirement that certain records be kept for 
 the life of the Defense Production Act and two years thereafter. It makes clear 
 that April 30, 1955, is the cutoff date for the required preservation of records. 
 Sellers of decontrolled commodities and services need not, of course, make or keep 
 records of transactions since decontrol.

FISH OILS INCLUDED IN DECONTROL OF FATS AND OILS : Fish oils were included a- 
 mong a broad range of commodities which were removed from price control at all levels 
 of distribution by an action taken by OPS in carrying out the Directive of the Pres- 
 ident that price controls shall be removed in an orderly manner. This action issu- 
 ed on February 12, 1953, removed price controls on all fats and oils, except oleo- 
 margarine. Decontrol of these items was made effective immediately by Amendment 20 
 to Revision 1 of General Overriding Regulation 7Â» The announcement, however, points 
 out that all fats and oils still remain under control in the Territories and Posses- 
 sions. 

The action specifically revoked, among others, Ceiling Price Regulation6, which 
 covered fats and oils.
