The principal change in the regulations has to do with collection of fees for 
 the inspection service. The cost will be met first from standard monthly payments 
 by all voluntary subscribers and then by supplements to the fund as the seasonprc— 
 gresses, from production deposits based on the cases of oysters packed or the pounds 
 of shrimp received by an establishment . At the end of the fiscal year any excess 
 of money collected over the Food and Drug Administration's total expenses in ren- 
 dering the inspection service is refunded to the subscribers. 

Previously the system of assessing subscribers gave prime importance to the 
 number of cases packet! rather than to the monthly payment. FDA states that this 
 could result in a packer with a very large production having to pay a dispropor- 
 tionate share of the cost of the service. Recognizing this, the revised regula- 
 tions shift emphasis to the fixed monthly charges and make the production deposits 
 secondary. FDA says that this system will more nearly make each individual packer 
 pay for the amount of work actually performed for inspection. 

Inspection extends to plants supplying certain raw materials to the inspected 
 establishments under the revised regulations. The service until a few years ago 
 was limited to canned shrimp, but under the revised regulations the voluntary in- 
 spection service is now available on all types of processed shrimp, including shrimp 
 products requiring the use of raw materials other than shrimp. Inspection of the 
 sources of raw material supply is authorized under the revised regulations. The 
 cost is placed upon the subscriber. 

The types of shrimp products covered are iced or frozen raw headless ; raw peel- 
 ed or cooked peeled (any of which may be deveined) ; iced or frozen deveined shrimp, 
 partially or completely peeled (which may be covered with batter and breaded before 
 freezing) ; and canned shrimp. For oysters only the canned product is covered. 

Processing times and temperatures in the revised regulations have been changed 
 to conform with present-day commercial practices.
