 final cleaning or blanching operation to 
 a temperature not exceeding 50° F. if it 
 is to be packaged immediately, or to a 
 temperature not exceeding 40° F. if it is 
 not to be packaged immediately. If such 
 shrimp are to be frozen, they shall be 
 placed in the freezing compartment 
 within 1 hour after final preparation. 

(i) If batter is employed, it shall be 
 used within 1 hour after it is prepared.

 F., and for wet-pack shrimp in cans 
 502 x 510, a cook of 15 minutes at 250° 
 F. may be approved if adequate provi- 
 sions are made to insure an initial tem- 
 perature of not less than 120° F. in each 
 individual can. For the purposes of this
