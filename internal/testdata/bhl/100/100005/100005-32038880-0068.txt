 5 pounds or more of shrimp per package 
 shall be hard frozen within 24 hours; 
 smaller packages should be hard frozen 
 within 12 hours. Alter freezing, the 
 shrimp shall be stored in such a manner 
 that its temperature does not exceed 0° 
 F.. and shall be handled in such manner 
 as will maintain the hard-frozen condi-

 stored at a room temperature not ex- 
 ceeding 35" P. 

(2) Raw headless shrimp shall be

 ceeding 35° F, except that it may be 
 stored at a higher room temperature if 
 sufficiently iced at all times to prevent 
 spoilage. 

<f ) The inspector shall identify each 
 record on the thermometer chart with 
 the code mark of the lot to which such 
 record relates and the date of such rec- 
 ord. The Administration shall keep 
 such charts for at least 5 years, and upon 
 request shall make them available to the 
 packer. 

(g) The packer shall keep for at least 
 1 year all shipping records covering ship- 
 ments from each lot, and upon request

 tor of the Administration. 

§ 155.10 Examination after process- 
 ing, (a) Adequate samples shall be 
 drawn by the inspector from each lot of 
 prpcessed shrimp and shall be examined 
 to determine whether or not such proc- 
 essed shrimp conforms to all require- 
 ments of the Federal Food. Drug, and 
 Cosmetic Act, amendments thereto, and 
 regulations thereunder. 

(b) The packer shall destroy for food 
 purposes, under the immediate super-

§ 155.11 Labeling, (a) Labels on 
 shrimp packed and certified under 
 §§ 155.1 through 155.14 may bear a mark 
 attesting to such packing and certifica- 
 tion. Depending upon the type of proc- 
 essing, such marks, if used, shall read 
 as follows: 

U) For canned shrimp: "Production 
 supervised by U. S. Food and Drug 
 Administration." 

(2) For frozen shrimp: "Packing and 
 freezing supervised by U. S. Food and 
 Drug Administration. Perishable prod- 
 uct — Not warranted against mishandling 
 after freezing." 

(3) For fresh, iced, or refrigerated 
 shrimp: "Packing supervised by U. S. 
 Food and Drug Administration. Perish- 
 able product — Not warranted against 
 mishandling after packing.'" 

Such marks if used shall be plainly and 
 conspicuously displayed in type of uni- 
 form size and style on a strongly con- 
 trasting uniform background. The 
 marks referred to in subparagraphs (2) 
 and (3) of this paragraph shall not be 
 used on the master carton unless such 
 marks will be defaced by the opening of 
 the cartons. 

(b) Labels on inspected processed 
 shrimp, other than canned shrimp, not 
 bearing the marks referred to in para- 
 graph (a) (2) and (3) of this section, and 
 all master cartons for inspected shrimp 
 other than canned shrimp, shall bear the 
 statement "Perishable — Keep frozen" or 
 "Perishable — Keep refrigerated," which- 
 ever is applicable to the product. 

(c) Two proofs, or one proof and one 
 photostat thereof, or eight specimens of 
 all labeling intended for use on inspected 
 shrimp, or on or within the cases there- 
 for, shall be submitted to the Adminis- 
 tration for approval. If proofs or pho- 
 tostat and proof are submitted, eight 
 specimens of the labeling shall be sent 
 to the Administration after printing. 
 The Administration is authorized to ap- 
 prove labeling for use on or with proc- 
 essed shrimp inspected under §§ 155.1 
 through 155.14; approval shall be sub- 
 ject to the condition that such labeling 
 shall be so used as to comply with the. 
 provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, 
 and Cosmetic Act, amendments thereto, 
 and regulations thereunder. The Ad- 
 ministration is also authorized to revoke 
 any such approval for cause. The Ad- 
 ministration shall not approve labeling 
 for processed shrimp intended for ex- 
 port under the provisions of § 155.12 (e). 

(d) No commercial brand or brand 
 name appearing on labeling approved as 
 authorized under paragraph (c) of this 
 section and bearing the marks described 
 in paragraph (a) of this section, and no 
 labeling simulating any such approved 
 labeling, shall be used, after such ap- 
 proval, on processed shrimp other than 
 that which has been handled, prepared, 
 packed, and stored in compliance with all 
 provisions of §§ 155.1 through 155.14; 
 but this section shall not apply to any 
 packer's labeling not bearing such mark 
 after termination of inspection or with' 
 drawal thereof as authorized by § 155.14 
 or to any distributor's labeling not bear- 
 ing such mark after written notice by the 
 owner thereof to the Administration 
 that the use of such labeling on inspected 
 processed shrimp has been discontinued 
 and will not be resumed. 

(e) Shrimp labeling authorized by 
 paragraph (a) of this section or ap- 
 proved under paragraph (c) of this sec- 
 tion shall be used only as authorized by 
 §§ 155.1 through 155.14. Unauthorized 
 use of such labeling -renders the user 
 liable to' the penalties prescribed by the 
 Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 
 as amended. 

§ 155.12 Certificates of inspections; 
 warehousing and export permits, (a) 
 After finding that the processed shrimp 
 comprising any parcel has been han- 
 dled, prepared, and packed in compliance 
 with all provisions of §§ 155.1 through 
 155.14, bears labeling approved as au- 
 thorized under § 155.11 (c) . and complies 
 with all the provisions of the Federal 
 Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, amend- 
 ments thereto, and regulations there- 
 under, the inspector shall issue a cer- 
 tificate showing that such processed 
 ehrimp so complies. The certificate 
 shall specify the code marks to which 
 it applies, the quantity of the parcel so 
 marked, the place where such parcel is 
 stored, the size of the shrimp, the size 
 and kind of containers, the type of pack, 

the commercial brand name on the la- 
 bels, the quality grade of the shrimp 
 if it is fancy, the condition of trie 
 shrimp if it is broken or if it is sub- 
 standard in fill and the destination of the 
 lot if known. Such certificate shall be- 
 come void if such labeling is removed, 
 altered, obliterated, or replaced, or if 
 mishandling, improper storage, or other 
 circumstances so change the product 
 that it no longer complies with the re- 
 quirements for the issuance of a cer- 
 tificate; but such processed shrimp may 
 be relabeled under the supervision of an 
 inspector and recertified if the inspector 
 finds that, after being relabeled, it com- 
 plies with the requirements laid down 
 by this paragraph for the issuance of 
 a certificate. 

(b) Unless covered by certificate, pro- 
 cessed shrimp shall be moved from an 
 inspected establishment only for storage 
 authorized under paragraph (c) of this 
 section, or for export authorized under 
 paragraph (e) of this section, or for 
 destruction as provided by § 155.10 (b). 
 Cc) Applications to move unlabeled 
 processed shrimp for storage in a ware- 
 house or cold storage plant elsewhere 
 than in the establishment where such 
 shrimp was processed shall be on forms 
 supplied by the Administration. The 
 application shall give the name and lo- 
 cation of the warehouse or cold storage 
 plant in which such processed shrimp 
 is to be stored, and shaD be accompanied 
 by an agreement signed by the operator 
 of such warehouse or cold storage plant 
 that inspectors shall have free access at 
 all times to all processed shrimp so 
 stored and that conditions which will 
 preserve the identity of each parcel of 
 such processed shrimp shall be continu- 
 ously maintained pending issuance of a 
 certificate thereon or removal as author- 
 ized by paragraph (d) of this section. 
 If such application is approved and it 
 appears to the inspector that the proc- 
 essed shrimp comprising any parcel has 
 been packed m compliance with §§ 155.1 
 through 155^14 and conforms, except for 
 the absence of labeling, to all require- 
 ments of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
 Cosmetic Act, amendments thereto, and 
 regulations thereunder, the inspector 
 shall issue to the applicant, on his re- 
 quest, a warehousing permit covering 
 such processed shrimp. Such permit 
 shall specify the code marks to which it 
 applies, the quantity of the parcel so 
 marked, the places from and to which 
 such parcel is to be moved, the size of the 
 shrimp, the size and kind of containers, 
 the type of pack, whether or not it is 
 £ancy grade, the condition of the shrimp 
 if it is broken or if it is substandard in 
 fill, and. if such be the case, that it is 
 Intended for export under paragraph (e) 
 of this section. When any provision of 
 the agreement is violated, the Adminis- 
 tration may revoke any permit issued 
 pursuant to such agrement, and may 
 also revoke its approval of the applica- 
 tion for warehousing or cold storage 
 which accompanied such agreement. 

(d) Unless covered by certificate, 
 processed shrimp stored under the au- 
 thority of paragraph (c) of this section 
 shall be moved from the warehouse or* 
 cold storage plant where stored only for 
 restorage under such authority, or for 
 return upon written permission of the
