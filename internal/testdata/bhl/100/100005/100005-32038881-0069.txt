inspector to the establishment where 
 processed, or for export authorized under 
 paragraph (e) of this section, or for 
 destruction as provided by § 155.10 (b). 
 (e) An application to export processed 
 shrimp under the provisions of section 
 801 (d) of the act shall be accompanied 
 by the original or a verified copy of the 
 specifications of the foreign purchaser; 
 if required by the Administration, evi- 
 dence showing that such processed 
 shrimp is not in conflict with the laws 
 of the country to which it is intended for 
 export; and, if shipment of labeled proc- 
 essed shrimp is specified or directed, 
 eight specimens of the labeling therefor. 
 If processed shrimp prepared or packed 
 according to such specifications is not 
 in conflict with the laws of such country, 
 the Administration shall direct the in- 
 spector to issue to the applicant an ex- 
 port permit covering such processed 
 shrimp comprising any parcel ordered by 
 such purchaser under such specifica- 
 tions, when the inspector finds that such 
 processed shrimp was packed in com- 
 pliance with the requirements of §§ 155.1 
 through 155.14 regarding sanitary con- 
 ditions and processing; is not filthy, de- 
 composed, putrid, or otherwise unfit for 
 food; accords to such specifications; and 
 is labeled on the outside of the shipping 
 package to show that it is intended for 
 export. Such permit shall specify the 
 code marks to which it applies and the 
 quantity of the parcel so marked, and 
 shall show that such processed shrimp 
 was packed under sanitary conditions, 
 is wholesome, and accords to such speci- 
 fications. The applicant shall furnish 
 to the inspector documentary evidence 
 showing the exportation of all such proc- 
 essed shrimp. 

§ 155.13 Inspection tees, (a) (1) 
 Except as otherwise provided by the reg- 
 ulations in this part, an initial payment 
 of $500.00 shall accompany each applica- 
 tion; thereafter, eight additional advance 
 payments of $500.00 shall be made on or 
 before the first day of each month begin- 
 ning July 1 and continuing through Feb 
 ruary 1 for the regular inspection period; 
 except that the Administration may re- 
 quire the full amount of advance pay- 
 ments prescribed by this paragraph to 
 accompany the application of an appli- 
 cant who has defaulted in any payment 
 due for any prior packing season. 

(2) Whenever it is determined, with- 
 out hearing, by the Administration that 
 an establishment having the inspection 
 service has been damaged by wind, fire, 
 flood, or other calamity, to such an ex- 
 tent that packing operations cannot be 
 resumed before the end of the fiscal year- 
 then current, no advance payments fall- 
 ing due after such calamity shall be 
 required from the packer for that fiscal 
 year; but whenever it is determined, 
 without hearing, by the Administration 
 that an establishment having the inspec- 
 tion service has been so damaged by any 
 such calamity that operations must be 
 suspended temporarily, but can be re- 
 sumed before the end of the fiscal year 
 then current, advance payments falling 
 due after such calamity and before the 
 month of resumption of operations shall 
 be postponed until operations are re- 
 sumed, and thereupon shall be paid in 
 equal monthly installments during the 

period between the time of resumption 
 of operations and June 1 of the fiscal year 
 then current: Provided, That in the 
 event of a determination described in 
 this subparagraph the total payments 
 and deposits made by the packer involved 
 shall be charged with the cost of the 
 service made available for the establish- 
 ment without regard to the method pro- 
 vided hereinafter for computing charges 
 against payments and deposits for 
 shrimp received, and the balance of the 
 total payments and deposits for shrimp 
 received remaining after such charges 
 shall be refunded by the Administration 
 to the packer after the completion of the 
 fiscal year. 

(3) Each application for an extension 
 inspection period of 1 month shall be 
 accompanied by a payment of $600.00, 
 and at subsequent monthly intervals 
 thereafter additional payments of 
 $600.00 shall be made; but if the final 
 payment is to cover a period of less than 
 30 days, then such payment shall be at 
 the rate of $20.00 for each day of such 
 period. 

(b) (1) In addition to the payments 
 prescribed in paragraph (a) of this sec- 
 tion, advance deposits based upon the 
 quantity of shrimp received by the sub- 
 scribing establishment shall be made to 
 underwrite adequately the cost of the 
 inspection service. Such deposits shall 
 be paid in advance in amounts of not 
 less than $300.00, unless the Adminis- 
 tration on an estimate of receipt of 
 shrimo authorizes other amounts, and 
 shall be computed at the rate of 20 cents 
 per 100 pounds of whole raw shrimp, or 
 35 cents per 100 pounds of raw headless 
 shrimp, received by the plant. For the 
 purposes of this section, the quantity of 
 shrimp received by an establishment 
 shall be determined by weighing on a 
 suitable scale immediately after such 
 shrimp leaves the initial inspection belt 
 Provided, however, That other arrange' 
 ments for determining accurately the 
 weight of shrimp received may be em 
 ployed if approved in advance by the 
 Administration. A record of such 
 weights shall be maintained and made 
 available to the inspector upon his re- 
 quest. Any advance deposits in excess 
 of those required for actual shrimp re- 
 ceived for the fiscal year (July 1 

through June 30) shall be refunded to tion 

the packer by the Administration after 
 the completion of the fiscal year, 

(2) Deposits for shrimp received as 
 computed under paragraph (b) (1) of 
 this section, together with production 
 deposits prescribed for oysters canned 
 under § 155.28 (b) (1), shall be charged 
 with the balance of the total cost of the 
 inspection service that has not been pro 
 vided for by the combined total payments 
 under paragraph (a) of this section and 
 paragraph (a) of § 155.28, in the case of 
 canned oysters. The balance of the de- 
 posits remaining for shrimp received 
 after such charges have been made shall 
 be refunded by the Administration to 
 the packers after the completion of the 
 fiscal year, in the ratio which each 
 packer's deposits for shrimp received 
 and production deposits for oysters 
 canned bears to the combined total of 
 such deposits for shrimp received and 
 oysters camied by all packers for the; 
 fiscal year 

(3) When inspection service is with- 
 drawn from an establishment as author- 
 ized under § 155.14 (a), the Administra- 
 tion shall not return to the packer any 
 advance payments and/or deposits re- 
 quired to the date of withdrawal of the 
 service. Such payments and/or deposits 
 shall be charged with the cost of the 
 service made available for the estab- 
 lishment, without regard to the method 
 described in this section, and the balance 
 which would have accrued to such packer 
 shall remain to the credit of the Food 
 and Drug Administration in the special 
 account "Salaries and Expenses, Cer- 
 tification and Inspection Services." 

(c) A separate fee shall be paid to 
 cover all expenses, incurred in accord- 
 ance with the regulations of the United 
 States Government, for salary, travel, 
 subsistence, and other purposes incident 
 to inspection described under § 155.4 
 (b) of suppliers of any materials to es- 
 tablishments under the inspection service 
 or for the purpose of issuing a certificate 
 or warehousing or export permit on 
 processed shrimp stored or held at any 
 place other than an establishment to 
 which a sea food inspector is then 
 assigned. 

(d) When the processing plant and 
 the warehouse or cold storage plant of 
 an establishment are located at different 
 points of such distance apart that trans- 
 portation between them is required for 
 the inspector to perform his duties in 
 the establishment, the packer shall fur- 
 nish such transportation or shall pay a 
 separate fee to cover all expenses 
 therefor. 

(e) All payments required by the reg- 
 ulations in this part shall be by bank 
 draft or certified check, collectible at par, 
 drawn to the order of the Treasurer, 
 United States, and payable at Washing- 
 ton, D. C. All such drafts and checks, 
 except those for the payment required 
 by § 155.1 (a) , shall be delivered to the 
 inspector and promptly scheduled to the 
 Food and Drug Administration, Federal 
 Security Agency, Washington, D. C, 
 whereupon after appropriate records 
 thereof have been made, they shall be 
 transmitted to the Chief Disbursing Offi- 
 cer, Division of Disbursement, Treasury 
 Department, for deposit to the special 
 account "Certification and Inspection 
 Services, Food and Drug Administra- 

(f ) All refunds to the packers shall be 
 by check drawn on the Treasury of the 
 United States pursuant to refund vouch- 
 ers duly certified and approved by the 
 designated administrative officers. 

§ 155.14 Suspension and withdrawal 
 of inspection service, (a) The Adminis- 
 tration may suspend and the Adminis- 
 trator may withdraw inspection service 
 in any establishment: 

( 1 ) Upon failure of the packer to com- 
 ply with any applicable provision of 
 §§ 155.1 through 155.14; or 

(2) Upon the dissemination by the 
 packer or any person in privity with him 
 of any representation that is false or 
 misleading in any particular regarding 
 the application to any sea food of the in- 
 spection service provided by the regula- 
 tions in this part. 

(b) When inspection service is sus- 
 pended in an establishment, as author- 
 ized by paragraph (a) of this section, the
