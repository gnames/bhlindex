therefor shall be submitted to the Ad- 
 ministration for approval. If proofs or 
 photostat and proof are submitted, eight 
 specimens of the labeling shall be sent to 
 the Administration after printing. The 
 Administratioa is hereby authorized to 
 approve labeling for use on canned oys- 
 ters inspected under §§ 155.16 through 
 155.29. Approval shall be subject to the 
 condition that such labeling shall be so 
 used as to comply with the provisions of 
 the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic 
 Act, amendments thereto, and regula- 
 tions thereunder. The Administration 
 is also authorized to revoke any such ap- 
 proval for cause. The Administration 
 shall not approve labeling for canned 
 oysters intended for export under the 
 provisions of § 155.27 (e). 

(c) No commercial brand or brand 
 name appearing on labeling approved as 
 authorized under paragraph (b) of this 
 section and bearing the mark described 
 in paragraph (a) of this section, and no 
 labeling simulating any such approved 
 labeling, shall be used after such ap- 
 proval on canned oysters other than 
 those that have been handled, prepared, 
 and packed in compliance with all pro- 
 visions of §§ 155.16 through 155.29; but 
 this section shall not apply to any 
 packer's labeling not bearing such mark 
 after termination of inspection or with- 
 drawal thereof as authorized by § 155.29 
 or to any distributor's labeling not bear- 
 ing such mark after written notice by 
 the owner thereof to the Administration 
 that the use of such labeling on inspected 
 canned oysters has been discontinued 
 and will not be resumed. 

(d) Canned-oyster labeling authorized 
 by paragraph (a) of this section or ap- 
 proved under paragraph (b) of this 
 section shall be used only as authorized 
 by §§ 155.16 through 155.29. Unauthor- 
 ized use of such labeling renders the user 
 liable to the penalties prescribed by the 
 Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as 
 amended. 

§ 155.27 Certificates of inspection; 
 warehousing and export permits, (a) 
 After finding that the canned oysters 
 comprising any parcel have been han- 
 dled, prepared, and packed in compliance 
 with all provisions of §§ 155.16 through 
 155.29; bear labeling approved as au- 
 thorized under § 155.26 (b) ; and comply 
 with all the provisions of the Federal 
 Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, amend- 
 ments thereto, and regulations there- 
 under, the inspector shall issue a 
 certificate showing that such canned 
 oysters so comply. The certificate shall 
 specify the code marks to which it ap- 
 plies, the quantity of the parcel so 
 marked, the place where such parcel is 
 stored, the size and kind of containers, 
 the commercial brand name on the 
 labels, the condition of the oysters if 
 they are broken or if they are substand- 
 ard in fill, and the destination of the lot, 
 if known. Such certificate shall become 
 void if such labeling is removed, altered, 
 obliterated, or replaced ; but such canned 
 oysters may be relabeled under super- 
 vision of an inspector and recertified if 
 the inspector finds that, after being re- 
 labeled, they comply with the require- 
 ments laid down by this paragraph for 
 the issuance of a certificate. 

(b) Unless covered by certificate, 
 canned oysters shall be moved from an 
 inspected establishment only for storage 
 authorized under paragraph (c) of this 
 section, or for export authorized under 
 paragraph (e) of this section, or for 
 destruction as provided by § 155.25 (b). 

(c) Applications to move unlabeled 
 canned oysters for storage in a ware- 
 house elsewhere than in the establish- | 
 ment where such oysters were packed 
 shall be on forms supplied by the Ad- 
 ministration. The application shall give 
 the name and location of the warehouse 
 in which such canned oysters are to be 
 stored, and shall be accompanied by an 
 agreement signed by the operator of 
 such warehouse that inspectors shall 
 have free access at all times to all canned 
 oysters so stored, and that conditions 
 which will preserve the identity of each 
 parcel of such canned oysters shall be 
 continuously maintained pending issu- 
 ance of a certificate thereon or removal 
 as authorized by paragraph (d). of this 
 section. If such application is approved 
 and it appears to the inspector that the 
 canned oysters comprising any parcel 
 have been packed in compliance with 
 §1 155.16 through 155.29 and conform, 
 except for the absence of labeling, to all 
 requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, 
 and Cosmetic Act, amendments thereto, 
 and regulations thereunder, the inspec- 
 tor shall issue to the applicant, on his 
 request, a warehousing permit covering 
 such canned bysters. Such permit shall 
 specify the code marks to which it ap- 
 plies, the quantity of the parcel so 
 marked, the place from and to which 
 such parcel is to be moved, the size of 
 the oysters, the size and kind of con- 
 tainers, and the condition of the oysters 
 if they are broken or if they are sub- 
 standard in fill and, if such be the case, 
 that they are intended for export under 
 paragraph (e) of this section. When 
 any provision of the agreement is vio- 
 lated, the Administration may revoke 
 any permit issued pursuant to such 
 agreement, and may also revoke its ap- 
 proval of the application for warehous- 
 ing which accompanied such agreement. 

(d) Unless covered by certificate, 
 canned oysters stored under the author- 
 ity of paragraph (c) of this section shall 
 be moved from the warehouse where 
 stored only for re-storage under such 
 authority, or for return upon written 
 permission of the inspector to the estab- 
 lishment where packed, or for export 
 authorized under paragraph (e) of this 
 section, or for destruction as provided by 
 § 155.25 (b). 

(e) An application to export canned 
 oysters under the provisions of section 
 801 (d) of the act shall be accompanied 
 by the original or a verified copy of the 
 specifications of the foreign purchaser; 
 if required by the Administration, evi- 
 dence showing that such canned oysters 
 are not in conflict with the laws of the 
 country to which they are intended for 
 export; and, if shipment of labeled 
 canned oysters is specified or directed, 
 eight specimens of the labeling therefor. 
 If canned oysters prepared or packed 
 according to such specifications are not 
 in conflict with the laws of such country, 
 the Administration shall direct the in- 
 spector to issue to the applicant an ex- 

port permit covering such canned oysters 
 comprising any parcel ordered by such 
 purchaser under such specifications, 
 when the inspector finds that such 
 canned oysters were packed in compli- 
 ance with the requirements of §§ 155.16 
 through 155.29 regarding sanitary con- 
 ditions and processing; are not filthy, 
 decomposed, putrid, or otherwise unfit 
 for food; accord to such' specifications, 
 and are labeled on the outside of the 
 shipping package to show that they are 
 intended for export. Such permit shall 
 specify the code marks to which it ap- 
 plies and the quantity of the parcel so 
 marked, and shall show that such canned 
 oysters were packed under sanitary con- 
 ditions, are wholesome, and accord to 
 such specifications. The applicant shall 
 furnish to the inspector documentary 
 evidence showing the exportation of all 
 such canned oysters. 

§ 155.28 Inspection fees. (a> (1) 
 Except as otherwise provided by the reg- 
 ulations in this part, an initial payment 
 of $600.00 shall accompany each applica- 
 tion; thereafter, three additional ad- 
 vance payments of $600.00 each shall be 
 made, as follows: One payment on or 
 before the date of the beginning of the 
 regular inspection period specified in the 
 application for inspection; the remain- 
 ing two payments on or before the first 
 day of each succeeding month, except 
 that the Administration may require the 
 full amount of all advance payments pre- 
 scribed by this paragraph to accompany 
 the application of an applicant who has 
 defaulted in any payment due for any 
 prior packing season: Provided, That a 
 packer who is concurrently receiving in- 
 spection service and making payments 
 under the regulations for the inspection 
 of processed shrimp shall not make any 
 additional payments under this subpara- 
 graph. 

(2) Whenever it is determined, with- 
 out hearing, by the Administration that 
 an establishment having the inspection 
 service has been damaged by wind, fire, 
 flood, or other calamity to such an ex- 
 tent that packing operations cannot be 
 resumed before the end of the fiscal year 
 then current, no advance payments fall- 
 ing due after such calamity shall be re- 
 quired from the packer for that fiscal 
 year; but whenever it is determined, 
 without hearing, by the Administration 
 that an establishment having the inspec- 
 tion service has been so damaged by any 
 such calamity that operations must be 
 suspended temporarily; but can be re- 
 sumed before the end of the fiscal year 
 then current, advance payments falling 
 due after such calamity and before the 
 month of resumption of operations shall 
 be postponed until operations are re- 
 sumed, and thereupon shall be paid in 
 equal monthly installments during the 
 period between the time of resumption of 
 operations and June 1 of the fiscal year 
 then current: Provided, That in the 
 event of a determination described in 
 this subparagraph the total payments 
 and production deposits made by the 
 packer involved shall be charged with 
 the cost of the service made available for 
 the establishment, without regard to the 
 method provided hereinafter for com- 
 puting charges against payments and
