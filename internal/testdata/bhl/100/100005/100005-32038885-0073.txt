production deposits, and the balance of 
 the total payments and deposits remain- 
 ing after such charges shall be refunded 
 by the Administration to the packer 
 after the completion of the fiscal year. 

(3) Each application for an extension 
 inspection period of 1 month shall be 
 accompanied by a payment of $600.00, 
 and at subsequent monthly intervals 
 thereafter additional payments of 
 $600.00 shall be made; but if the final 
 payment is to cover a period of less than 
 30 days, then such payment shall be at 
 the rate of $20.00 for each day of such 
 period. 

(b) (1) In addition to the payments 
 prescribed in paragraph (a) of this sec- 
 tion, advance deposits based upon the 
 Quantity of oysters canned by the sub- 
 scribing establishment shall be made to 
 underwrite adequately the cost of the 
 inspection service. Such deposits shall 
 be paid in advance in amounts of not 
 less than $300.00, unless the Administra- 
 tion on an estimate of production au- 
 thorizes other amounts, and shall be 
 computed at the rate of 15 cents for each 
 case of 48 cans, size 211 x 300. Any ad- 
 vance production deposits in excess of 
 those required for actual oysters canned 
 for the fiscal year (July 1 through June 
 30) shall be refunded to the packers by 
 the Administration after the completion 
 ■of the fiscal year. 

(2) Production deposits as computed 
 under subparagraph (1) of this para- 
 graph, together with deposits for shrimp 
 received as prescribed under § 155.13 (b) 
 (1), in the case of- processed shrimp, 
 shall be charged with the balance of the 
 total cost of the inspection service which 
 has not been provided for by the com- 
 bined total payments under paragraph 
 (a) of this section and paragraph (a) of 
 § 155.13, in the case of processed shrimp. 
 The balance of the production deposits 
 remaining after such charges have been 
 made shall be refunded by the Admin- 
 istration to the packers after the com- 
 pletion of the fiscal year in the ratio 
 which each packer's production deposits 
 for oysters canned and deposits for 

shrimp received bears to the combined 
 total of such deposits for oysters canned 
 and shrimp received by all packers for 
 the fiscal year. 

(3) When inspection service is with- 
 drawn from an establishment as author- 
 ized under § 155.29 (a), the Administra- 
 tion shall not return to the packer any 
 advance payments and/or deposits re- 
 quired to the date of withdrawal of the 
 service. Such payments and/or de- 
 posits shall be charged with the cost of 
 the service made available for the estab- 
 lishment, without regard to the method 
 described in this section, and the balance 
 that would have accrued to such packer 
 shall remain to the credit of the Food 
 and Drug Administration in the special 
 account "Salaries and Expenses, Cer- 
 tification and Inspection Services." 

(c) A separate fee shall be paid to 
 cover all expenses incurred in accordance 
 with the regulations of the United States 
 Government, for salary, travel, subsist- 
 ence, and for other purposes incident to 
 inspection for the purpose of issuing a 
 certificate or warehousing or export per- 
 mit on canned oysters stored or held at 
 any place other than an establishment to 
 which a sea food inspector is then 
 assigned. 

<d) When the cannery and the can- 
 nery warehouse of an establishment are 
 located at different points of such dis- 
 tance apart that transportation between 
 them is required for the inspector to per- 
 form his duties in the»establishment, the 
 packer shall furnish such transportation 
 or shall pay a separate fee to cover all 
 expenses therefor. 

(e) All payments required by the reg- 
 ulations in this part shall be by bank 
 draft or certified check, collectible at par, 
 drawn to the order of the Treasurer, 
 United States, and payable at Washing- 
 ton, D. C. All such drafts and checks, 
 except those for the payment required 
 by § 155.16 (a), shall be delivered to the 
 inspector and promptly scheduled to the 
 Food and Drug Administration, Federal 
 Security Agency, Washington, D. C, 
 whereupon after appropriate records 

thereof have been made they shall be 
 transmitted to the Chief Disbursing Of- 
 ficer, Division of Disbursement, Treasury 
 Department, for deposit to the special 
 account "Certification and Inspection 
 Services, Food and Drug Administra- 
 tion." 

(f ) All refunds to packers shall be by 
 check drawn on the Treasury of the 
 United States pursuant to refund 
 vouchers duly Certified and approved by 
 the designated administrative officers. 

§ 155.29 Suspension and withdrawal 
 of inspection service, (a) The Adminis- 
 tration may suspend and the Adminis- 
 trator may withdraw inspection service 
 in any establishment upon failure of 
 the packer to comply with any applicable 
 provision of §§ 155.16 through 155.29 or 
 upon the dissemination by the packer or 
 any person in privity with him of any 
 representation that is false or misleading 
 in any particular regarding the applica- 
 tion to any sea food of the inspection 
 service provided by the regulations in 
 this part. 

(b) When inspection service is sus- 
 pended in an establishment, as au- 
 thorized by paragraph (a) of this sec- 
 tion, the Administration shall not 
 lengthen the inspection period in such 
 establishment to compensate for any of 
 the time of suspension. 

This order shall become effective 30 
 days following the date of its publica- 
 tion in the Federal Register. 

Notice and public procedure are not 
 necessary prerequisites to the promul- 
 gation of this order, and I so find, since 
 the amendments, in part, adjust the basis 
 of fees which it is necessary to charge 
 in order to provide, equip, and maintain 
 a self-liquidating sea food inspection 
 service as required by law, and make 
 minor changes in previous regulations.
