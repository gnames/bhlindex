HADDOCK FISHING REGULATION S FOR NORTHWE ST ATLANTIC : Regulations (effective 
 June 1-December 31, 1953) affecting the taking of haddock ( Melanogramnus aeglef inus ) 

in the Northwest Atlantic were published by the 
 U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service in the April 
 24 Federal Register . Taking of haddock by trawl 
 nets or nets having a diagonally-stretchedmesh 
 less than 4^ inches when wet is prohibited in 
 the Northwest Atlantic north of latitude 39°CO ' 
 N. and west of longitude 42°00' W. by these 
 Federal regulations. 

The full text of the regulations as they 
 appeared in the Federal Register follows: 

Subchapter I— Northwest Atlantic Commercial 
 Fisheries 

Paht 155 — Haddock Provisions 

Basis and purpose. At its meeting held 
 in St. Andrews, New Brunswick, Canada, 
 June 30-July 9, 1952, the International; 
 Commission for the Northwest Atlantic 
 Fisheries, a body created pursuant to Ar- 
 ticle n of the International Convention 
 for the Northwest Atlantic fisheries 
 signed at Washington under date of Feb- 
 ruary 8, 1949, adopted a proposal recom- 
 mending that the Contracting Govern- 
 ments, in the interest of permitting an 
 adequate escapement of immature had- 
 dock, take appropriate action to prohibit 
 the taking of haddock in Sub-area 5 of 
 the Convention waters with a trawl net 
 having a mesh size of less than four and 
 one-half inches. The proposal recom- 
 mended further the adoption of a spe- 
 cific method of measuring mesh size and 
 the exemption of vessels taking haddock 
 for the purposes of scientific investiga- 
 tion from the proposed mesh restrictions. 
 In its letter of July 15, 1952, which sub- 
 mitted the proposal to the Contracting 
 Governments pursuant to Article vm of 
 the Convention, the Commission drew 
 attention to the experimental nature of 
 the proposed mesh size regulation and 
 outlined a suggested research program 
 to determine the effectiveness of the reg- 
 ulation following its adoption. 

On February 13, 1953 the proposal was 
 accepted by the Governments of the 
 United States and Canada, in accordance 
 with Article VH (7) of the International 
 Convention for the Northwest Atlantic 
 Fisheries and, in accordance with Article 
 vni (8) of the Convention, the propose" 
 will become effective for all Contracting 
 Governments on June 13, 1953. In ac- 
 cordance with section 4 (a) of the North- 
 west Atlantic Fisheries Act of 1950 (64 
 Stat. 1067, 16 U. S. C, 1946 ed., Supp. V, 
 981) regulations proposed by the Secre- 
 tary of the Interior to implement the 
 proposal were submitted to the Advisory 
 Committee to the United States Commis 
 sioners of the International Convention 
 for the Northwest Atlantic Commission 
 on December 2, 1952, at which time the 
 proposed regulations received the unani- 
 mous approval of the members of the 
 Advisory Committee in attendance. 

By notice of proposed rule making 
 published in the Federal Register on 
 December 30, 1952 (17 F. R. 11823), the 
 public was invited to submit written data 
 views or arguments in connection with 
 the proposed regulations to Albert M. 
 Day, Director, Fish and Wildlife Service 
 Department of the Interior, Washington 
 25, D. C, not later than 60 days from 
 the publication of the Notice in the Fed- 
 eral Register. Careful consideration 
 has been given the views, data, and 
 arguments received, and it has been 
 determined that the regulations appear- 

ing below should be promulgated to 
 govern the use of trawling nets in the 
 haddock fishery in the area described in 
 the said regulations.
