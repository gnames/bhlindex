ALASKA FISHING REGULATIONS FOR 1953 ISSUED : The commercial fishing regula- 
 lations for the 1953 season in Alaska were issued "arch 13, by Secretary of the In- 
 terior Douglas McKay. Although a large number of changes have been made, only a 
 few are significant; the remainder being either minor or of an editorial nature. 

Changes include the closing of the Nushagak district of Bristol Bay because of 
 the extremely poor condition of the red salmon runs there. To help alleviate any 
 attendant hardship, the personal-use restrictions 
 have been relaxed and the industry has been re- 
 quested voluntarily to do everything possible to 
 absorb the labor supply in adjoining districts of 
 Bristol Bay where good runs are anticipated. 

Because of a relatively poor escapement in 
 the parent cycle , a small run of pink salmon is 
 anticipated in Prince William Sound this year. 
 Accordingly, a curtailed season extending from 
 July 13 to August 5 has been adopted, along with 
 the temporary closure of 17 trap sites and some curtailment of mobile gear by the 
 industry. The runs will be watched with special care and additional closed time 
 will be applied to field announcement, if such is necessary to secure an adequate 
 escapement . 

All indications point to good pink salmon runs in southeastern Alaska where the 
 odd-year cycle has been rehabilitated and some relaxation in the seasonal restric- 
 tions is possible this year. The seasonal dates have been adjusted to conform with 
 the time of occurrence of the runs in the various districts. An early season from 
 June 2A to July 11 has been provided in the northern part of southeastern Alaska to 
 allow harvesting of the early chum salmon runs. In addition, two more bays have been 
 added to those open for fall fishing.
