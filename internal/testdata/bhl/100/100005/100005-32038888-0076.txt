CIVILIAN DISTRIBUTION CONTROL OF STEEL , COPPER , AND ALUMINUM NOT PLANNED AFT- 
 ER JUNE 30 ; In response to questions regarding the use after June 30, 1953, of the 
 Controlled Materials Plan in the distribution of steel, copper, and aluminum to the 
 civilian economy, the Office of Defense Mobilization issued this statement on Feb- 
 ruary 2k' 

"The Government does not intend to continue to control the distribution of steel, 
 copper, and aluminum in the civilian economy after June 30, 1953, under the Control- 
 led Materials Plan. Thereafter, if the necessary statutory authority is provided, 
 materials controls will be used vigorously to assure completion of the military build- 
 up but general distribution will be directed only of scarce and critical items es- 
 sential to the national defense. Advance allotments of steel, copper, and aluminum 
 under the Controlled Materials Plan for delivery after June 30, 1953 are being re- 
 examined and all such allotments which do not meet the foregoing requirements will 
 be cancelled within the next few weeks. Until cancelled, all allotments continue 
 in full force and effect."

REPORT ON TUNA INDUSTRY : The U. S. Tariff Commission on March 23 issued a re- 
 port (Tuna Fish — Report on Investigation Conducted Pursuant to a Resolution by the 
 Committee on Finance of the United States Senate dated June 26, 1952) on the domes- 
 tic tuna industry. The Senate resolution which called for the study was the out- 
 growth of defeat in the Senate of H. R. 5693 . 82nd Congress, which provided for a 
 temporary duty of 3 cents per pound on fresh or frozen tuna pending studies by the 
 Tariff Commission and the Department of the Interior. H. R. 5693 had already been 
 passed by the House of Representatives (October 15, 1951) and had been reported fa- 
 vorably by the Senate Finance Committee. 

In transmitting the resolution to the Tariff Commission, Chairman Walter F. 
 George of the Senate Committee on Finance stated that "...action of the Senate should 
 probably be delayed until a thorough study has been made... (and) ... that an investi- 
 gation by ...(the Tariff Commission)... would be of great help should any future ac- 
 tion be considered." The resolution directed the Commission to set forth the facts 
 relative to the production, trade, and consumption of tuna in the United States, and 
 to take into account all relevant factors, including the interests of consumers, pro- 
 cessors, and producers. The principal objective of the resolution was to obtainsuch 
 factual information as would "assist the Congress in determining what change, if any, 
 shall be made in the tariff status of fresh or frozen tuna." 

Although the resolution of the Senate Committee on Finance did not request such 
 an investigation by the Secretary of the Interior, six Senators representing the Pa- 
 cific Coast States addressed a joint communication to the Secretary of the Interior 
 asking him to make the investigation that was proposed in H. R. 569 3 » In response
