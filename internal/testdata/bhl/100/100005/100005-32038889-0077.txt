to that request, the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service also made an investigation, 
 but members of the staffs of the Fish and Wildlife Service and of the Tariff Com- 
 mission have consulted with each other with a view to minimizing duplication of 
 effort. 

With reference to the conclusions of the report, Chairman Brossard of the 
 Tariff Commission made the following statement: "I do not approve these 'Conclu- 
 sions 1 as they have been revised by the majority of the Commission. This whole 
 tuna report must be submitted to the Senate Committee on Finance by March 20,1953, 
 which leaves me no time to prepare an adequate dissenting report, but only time 
 to make this statement disclaiming responsibility for this section of the report 
 as it now reads. 

"I suggest to those persons interested in the differences in the opinions of 
 the members of the Commission on the question of whether imports are injuring the 
 domestic tuna industry that they read the Tariff Commission's report of November 
 1952 on Bonito Canned in Oil, and Tuna and Bonito, Canned not in Oil, made under 
 the escape clause provisions of the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1951." 

Some of the leading statements contained in the conclusions follow: 

"1. The difficulties confronting the domestic 
 tuna fisheries and the domestic tuna canneries in 
 recent years have been similar to those confronting 
 many other industries that have been obliged to make 
 postwar adjustments to the resumption or expansion 
 of competition from abroad.... 

"2. ...On the basis of financial returns cover- 
 ing operations of five tuna canneries (which account- 
 ed for over one-fifth of total United States produc- 
 tion in 1951-52), for periods ranging from 4 to 8 
 months of the calendar year 1952, it appears that 
 sales of tuna (including those of tunalike fishes), 
 as well as of other fish packed by tuna canners.will 
 be greater in the fiscal year 1952-53 than they were 
 in 1951-52, and that the profit experience of the 
 tuna packers will be more favorable in 1952-53 than 
 in 1951-52. 

"3. ...domestically caught fish in all postwar 
 years have accounted for two-thirds or more of the 
 total quantity of tuna and tunalike fishes consumed 
 in canned form in the United States. Of the total 
 apparent consumption of tuna and tunalike fishes in 
 all forms in 1952, the domestic catch supplied 340 
 million pounds (67 percent) .imports of fresh or fro- 
 zen fish 69 million pounds (13 percent), and imports 
 of canned fish (in terms of round weight equivalent) 
 101 million pounds (20 percent) . Some considerable 
 part of the last-mentioned class of imports consists 
 of tuna and bonito in brine, which are lower-priced 
 items of which there is no corresponding domestic 
 production. 

"4. The domestic tuna-fishing interests have 
 generally been more concerned with the imports of 
 fresh or frozen tuna.i' all of which enter free of 
 duty, than with the imports of the canned tuna and 
 tunalike fishes, all of which are dutiable. Imports 
 of fresh and frozen tunalike fishes, most of which 
 are dutiable at 1 cent per pound, have been insig- 
 nificant and therefore have attracted little atten- 
 t ion.. .. 

I/VIRTUALLY ALL SUCH IMPORTS ARE FKU/LN. 

"The extent to which the domestic tuna fisheries 
 are exposed to foreign competition is actually govern- 
 ed by imports of both the raw and canned fish. The 
 particular forms in which the imports enter the United 
 States are largely influenced by the comparative inci- 
 dence of the applicable rates of duty, some of which 
 have been changed recently. The existing tariff struc- 
 ture appears to be most restrictive of imports of tuna 
 canned in oil and least restrictive of imports of fresh 
 or frozen tuna and of tuna and bonito canned in brine. 

"The share of the total apparent consumption of 
 all tuna and tunalike fishes in the United States which 
 has been supplied by the domestic tuna fishery ranged 
 between 82 percent and 87 percent in most years during 
 the decade preceding World War II but fell to a low of 
 66 percent in 1933. The ratio rose to as high as 99 
 percent during the war period but declined thereafter, 
 reaching a postwar low of 67 percent in 1952. The ab- 
 solute quantity supplied by the domestic tuna fishery 
 in that year was higher than in any preceding year be- 
 fore 1949, and was almost 80 percent higher than in 
 1939, a year in which the domestic fishery supplied 87 
 percent of the domestic consumption. 

"5. Commercial fishing for tuna and tunalike fish- 
 es involves somewhat greater entrepreneurial risks than 
 most other domestic enterprises. In good seasons, tuna 
 fisheries receive high returns and in poor seasons they 
 may sustain losses . Most domestic tuna fishermen par- 
 ticipate in fishing ventures as entrepreneurs; they do 
 not work for wages. Their income, which is usually a 
 share of the net realization from the sale of fish, con- 
 sequently varies considerably from year to year. Re- 
 turns to boat owners vary even more, since they assume 
 greater financial risks than do crew members. 

"The large amounts of capital invested in the do- 
 mestic tuna fishery and the general reluctance of tuna 
 fishermen to change occupations tends to encourage fish- 
 ing operations even when a given season 1 s prospective 
 earnings will not be high. Vessel owners will operate 
 at a loss over a considerable period rather than sustain 
 the even greater loss that would result from tying up 
 their vessels and losing their crews....
