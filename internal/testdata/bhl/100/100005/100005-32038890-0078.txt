COMMERCIAL FISHERIES REVIEW 

Vol. 15, No. 4 

"6. Whether it would be desirable as a matter 
 of public policy to impose restrictions or addition- 
 al restrictions on imports of tuna and tunalike fish- 
 es in the fresh, frozen or canned forms, is not a mat- 
 ter on which the Commission undertakes to pass. In 
 considering this question, however, the Congress may 
 wish to take into account, among other things, the 
 following facts with regard to the manner in which 
 such restrictions would operate and their possible 
 effects upon the domestic tuna fishery. 

"A sharp curtailment of imports of tuna and tuna- 
 like products , whether through tariff s or quotas , would 
 probably benefit in the immediate future the domestic 
 tuna fishery but might also, by encouraging the ex- 
 pansion of the domestic fleet, contribute to a later 
 recurrence of essentially the same combination of cir- 
 cumstances that brought such distress to the domes- 
 tic tuna fishery in 1951. 

"There are no means whereby the Commission can 
 determine, even approximately, what increase in do- 
 mestic prices for fresh tuna would result from the 
 imposition of a duty of any given height on imports 
 of the raw fish (in conjunction with the aforemen- 
 tioned compensatory tariff adjustments on the canned 
 fish products). Under present conditions, Peru and 
 Japan, which are United States' two principal foreign 
 suppliers, might well absorb some part of a United 
 States duty on fresh or frozen tuna (together with 
 the compensatory portion of the duties on the canned 
 fish products) in order to maintain their tuna fish- 
 ing and tuna canning operations ;2/ these provide em- 
 ployment for their nationals, earnings for their in- 
 dustries, revenue for their governments and dollar 
 exchange for their economies. Both countries are 
 gradually increasing their exports of tuna and tuna- 
 like products to other markets, but at present they 
 still rely principally on the United States market. 
 Host of the tuna and tunalike products which those 
 countries export to the United States are of the spe- 
 cies or qualities processed primarily for the United 
 States market and would not be produced to supply 
 their respective home markets. 

"It follows from what has been said that any de- 
 sired limitation on imports of fresh or frozen tuna 
 by the United States could probably be accomplished 
 much more certainly under present conditions by means 
 of quotas than by duties. The application of quotas, 
 however, would impose difficult problems. Quotas on 
 raw fi3h would probably have to be apportioned among 
 the different foreign suppliers and might also have 
 to be allocated among the various domestic canners. 
 Limitation of imports of the raw fish by quota would 
 probably necessitate the particularly difficult task 
 of formulating the appropriate compensatory duties 
 or quotas to apply to the imports of the canned prod- 
 ucts processed from the aforementioned fishes. 

"7. The domestic tuna canning interests have 
 been concerned about the tariff treatment applicable 
 to imports of tuna and tunalike fishes in all their 
 forms. The measure of tariff protection they receive 
 depends primarily on the spreads between the duties 
 applicable to the raw fish and the various rates ap- 
 plicable to the different packs of the canned fish. 
 Some packers have been fearful of the possibility 

2/THE ABILITY OF JAPAN TO ABSORB AT LLAjT SOME PART OF A 

UNITED STATES DUTY ON FROZEN TUMA,AS WELL AS AN INCREASED 
 DUTY ON TUNA IN BRINE, IS INDICATED BY JAPAn's PRESENT 

need to impose restrictions on the volume and minimum 
 prices of exports of these products to the united states. 
 Peru's corresponding ability is indicated by the exist- 
 ence OF A PERUVIAN TAX ON EXPORTS OF FROZEN AND CANNED 
 TUNA AND TUNALIKE FISHES. 

that a duty would be imposed on fresh or frozen tuna 
 without any compensatory adjustment in rates appli- 
 cable to the canned products. Such action would have 
 a damaging effect on the domestic tuna packers,, par- 
 ticularly those that rely largely on foreign sources 
 of supply for raw fish. Even if no tariff changes 
 were made for the benefit of the tuna packers, they 
 would quite properly expect appropriate compensatory 
 adjustments in the tariff treatment applicable to cer- 
 tain canned tuna and tunalike fishes (notably tuna in 
 brine) to accompany the imposition of a duty or quota 
 on fresh or frozen tuna for the benefit of the domes- 
 tic tuna fishery. 

"The reversion of the United States duty on tuna 
 in oil to 45 percent ad valorem on January 1, 1951 op- 
 erated primarily to lower the aggregate imports of the 
 canned products and to increase the importation of the 
 raw fish. The same tariff action, however, did cause 
 importers to shift from tuna in oil to canned items 
 dutiable at much lower duties, primarily tuna in brine, 
 which is dutiable at 12jt percent ad valorem. A sub- 
 stantial part of the increased sales of tuna andboniâ€” 
 to in brine, of which there is no corresponding domes- 
 tic pack, did not displace equivalent quantities of 
 tuna and tunalike fishes prepared in oil, foreign or 
 domestic. To a considerable degree these imports of 
 lower-priced tuna and tunalike products have created 
 their own market. Restriction of imports of those 
 packed in brine would operate to increase consumption 
 of domestically-packed tuna and tunalike products can- 
 ned in oil, but not to the extent that the imports of 
 the products canned in brine would thereby be curtail- 
 ed. 

"Although the share of the total domestic con- 
 sumption of canned tuna and tunalike fishes which has 
 been supplied by imports has risen sharply in postwar 
 years, domestic output of such canned products reach- 
 ed a record high in 1952, amounting to 179 million 
 pounds. About 17 percent of that total was processed 
 from imported raw fish, but the quantity processed from 
 domestic fish was higher in 1952 than in any earlier 
 year. 

"8. The Tariff Commission only recently had oc- 
 casion to determine whether the domestic industry that 
 packs tuna and tunalike fishes was being seriously in- 
 jured, within the meaning of the escape-clause provi- 
 sions of the Trade Agreement Extension Act of 1951, by 
 increased imports of certain canned products process- 
 ed from such fish. A number- of tuna-fishing and tuna- 
 canning interests filed an application with the Tariff 
 Commission on November 28, 1951, requesting it to con- 
 duct an escape-clause investigation covering tuna in 
 brine and bonito in oil and in brine. The application 
 did not include fresh or frozen tuna or tuna canned in 
 oil, since those products were not the subject of any 
 trade agreement tariff concessions. In that investi- 
 gation, the Tariff Comnission found, with Commission- 
 ers Brossard and Gregg dissenting,27 that the items 
 covered were not being imported in such increased quan- 
 tities, either actual or relative, as to cause or threat- 

3/THE BASIS OF THE DISSENT BY COMMISSIONERS BROSSARD AND 

GREGG WAS NOT THAT IMPORTS OF THE CANNED ITEMS WERE CAUSING 
 SERIOUS INJURY TO THE DOMESTIC TUNA PACKERS AS DISTIN- 
 GUISHED FROM THE DOMESTIC TUNA FISHERY, BUT RATHER THAT 
 SUCH IMPORTS WERE CAUSING INJURY TO THE WHOLE DOMESTIC 
 TUNA INDUSTRY, WHICH IN THEIR VIEW EMBRACED BOTH THE TUNA- 
 FISHING AND TUNA-PACKING INTERESTS. THE MAJORITY OF THE 
 COMMISSION CONSIDERED ONLY WHETHER IMPORTS OF THE ABOVE- 
 DESCRIBED CANNED PRODUCTS WERE CAUSING OR THREATENING 
 SERIOUS INJURY TO THE DOMESTIC TUNA PACKERS. THE MAJOR- 
 ITY FELT THAT FURTHER RESTRICTION OF IMPORTS OF THE CAN- 
 NED PRODUCTS WHICH WERE THE SUBJECT OF THE ESCAPE-CLAUSE 
 INVESTIGATION WOULD OPERATE PRINCIPALLY TO INCREASE IM- 
 PORTS OF FRESH AND FROZEN FISH AND THEREFORE COULD NOT 
 BE OF BENEFIT TO THE DOMESTIC TUNA FISHERY.
