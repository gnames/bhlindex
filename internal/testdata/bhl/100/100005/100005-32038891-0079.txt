en serious injury to the domestic industry producing 
 like or directly competitive products. The onlycom- 
 mercially important canned tuna product not covered by 
 that investigation was tuna packed in oil, imports of 
 which had already declined sharply following restora- 
 tion of the 45-percent duty onJanuary 1,1951. There- 
 fore, even if tuna in oil had been the subject of a 
 trade-agreement concession and had been included with 
 the other items in the escape-clause action, the Com- 
 mission' s finding would presumably have been no dif- 
 ferent from what it was. 

"Since the Tariff Commission made the aforemen- 
 tioned escape-clause finding, the financial position 
 of the domestic industry which packs tuna and tuna- 
 like fishes appears to have improved. Presumably, 
 therefore, less basis exists now than existed when 
 the escape clause investigation was made for increas- 
 ing duties or applying quotas on any imports of can- 
 ned tuna and tunalike fishes in order to prevent se- 
 rious injury to the domestic industry which packs 
 such fish. Even if no tariff or quota action should 
 be taken for the benefit of domestic tuna packers, 
 however, it might be necessary to apply increased 
 duties or quotas on at least some canned tuna and 
 tunalike fishes if duties or quotas should be placed 
 on imports of fresh or frozen tuna for the benefit 
 of the domestic tuna fishery. The scope and nature 
 of the compensatory adjustments on the canned items 
 would depend on the height of the duties, or the size 
 of the quotas, on the fresh and frozen fish. 

"9. To the extent that imports of fresh or fro- 
 zen tuna would be restricted by either tariffs or 
 quotas, the domestic canneries that rely on foreign 
 sources for all or part of their supply of raw fish 
 might be placed at a competitive disadvantage in com- 
 parison with those that obtain most or all of their 
 supplies from domestic fisheries. The domestic can- 
 neries most dependent on foreign sources of supply 

are located in the Pacific Northwest, the Atlantic 
 Coast States, and Hawaii. 

"Overall restriction of imports of the raw fish 
 would also operate to reduce the supply of albacore, 
 available to domestic canneries. The domestic catch 
 of albacore, which varies widely from year to year, 
 is not nearly large enough to meet requirements of 
 domestic canneries for producing their premium packs 
 of white meat tuna. 

"To the extent that the imposition of a duty or 
 quota on fresh or frozen tuna would result in higher 
 costs to domestic canneries , the wholesale prices of 
 canned fish would advance and the retail prices would 
 advance disproportionately more. The cost of raw fish 
 currently averages over 60 percent of the factory cost 
 of producing canned tuna in the United States. 

"10. The tariff treatment applicable to fresh or 
 frozen bonito and yellowtail, tuna canned in brine, 
 and bonito and yellowtail canned in oil or brine are 
 now the subject of tariff commitments under trade a- 
 greements with various countries; but imports of fresh 
 or frozen tuna and tuna in oil are not the subject of 
 any such commitments. Any changes in the tariff treat- 
 ment of imports now subjectto these commitments would 
 therefore require modification of the agreements with 
 one or more of the following countries : Iceland and 
 the contracting parties of GATT, of which Cuba, Peru, 
 Canada, and Chile would probably be the countries prin- 
 cipally concerned. 

"Although the United States has no specific ob- 
 ligations to Japan with respect to the tariff treat- 
 ment applicable to United States imports of tuna and 
 tunalike products , Japan has ah important interest in 
 that matter. The export of frozen and canned tuna 
 and tunalike fishes to the United States by foreign 
 countries, particularly Japan and Peru, provides em- 
 ployment for their nationals, some revenue for their 
 governments, and a supply of needed dollar exchange."

 ery products "by acquiring them and providing for 

their distribution through Federal, State, and pri- 
 vate relief channels." From the total funds, the 
 sum of $750,000 "shall be used to promote the free 
 flow of domestically-produced fishery products in 
 commerce by conducting a fishery educational service 
 and fishery technological and related research pro- 
 grams;" and $250,000 to develop and increase markets 
 for domestic fishery products.
