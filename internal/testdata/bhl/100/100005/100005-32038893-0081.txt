Submerged Lands Act . Senate Report No . 133 . Part 
 1, (March 27, 1953, 83d Congress, 1st Session) , 81 
 p., Printed. This is a report from the Committee on 
 Interior and Insular Affairs to accompany S. J. Res . 
 13 , a joint resolution to confirm and establish the 
 titles of the states to lands beneath navigable wa- 
 ters within state boundaries and to the natural re- 
 sources within such lands and waters, to provide for 
 the use and control of said lands and resources , and 
 to confirm the jurisdiction and control of the United 
 States over the natural resources of the seabed of 
 the continental shelf seaward of state boundaries. 
 Committee recommended passage with an amendment in 
 the form of a clean bill. The only change of sub- 
 stance from the original bill is in section 9, in 
 which the jurisdiction and control of the Federal 
 Government over the natural resources of the seabed 
 of the continental shelf seaward of historic state 

boundaries is confirmed. The report contains the 
 clean bill, a discussion of the purpose of the bill 
 and legislation for the continental shelf, analysis 
 of the bill, Committee amendments, and the history 
 of the legislation. The Committee points out that 
 "the majority is fully aware that in proposing leg- 
 islation applying only to submerged lands inside 
 State boundaries , there remains a large and important* 
 area requiring congressional action, namely, the 
 Continental Shelf seaward of state boundaries." 
 The bill as amended deals "with this vast area 
 only to the extent that it gives statutory con- 
 firmation to the jurisdiction and control of the 
 United States over the resources of the seabed 
 and subsoil of the continental shelf which was 
 asserted in 1945 by the Presidential proclama- 
 tion. It does not attempt to provide for the 
 administration and development of the area and 
 the mechanics of control." An appendix contains 
 the Proclamation by the President of the United 
 States of Sept. 28, 1945, stating the policy of 
 the United States with respect to the natural re- 
 sources of the subsoil and seabed of the conti- 
 nental shelf; Executive Order 9633, Sept. 28, 
 1945, reserving and placing certain resources of 
 the continental shelf under the control and ju- 
 risdiction of the Secretary of the Interior ; text 
 of Supreme Court decisions in various pertinent 
 cases; Senate Report No. 1592 , 80th Congress , 2d 
 Session; and Memorandum Brief by National Asso- 
 ciation of Attorneys General.
