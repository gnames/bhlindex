Offshore Grounds Important to the United States Had- 
 dock Fishery , by Howard A.Schuck, Research Report 
 32, 23 p., illus., printed, 15 cents, 1952. Pre- 
 sents information concerning the areas fished for 

haddock by the United States otter-trawl fleet 
 over a 12-year period, 1938-49. A series of charts 
 is included. One chart shows the relative inten- 
 sity of fishing over the areas fished for the en- 
 tire study period. The most important grounds for 
 the United States haddock fishery are on Georges 
 Bank. About 82 percent of the fishing effort over 
 the 12-year period was spent on this bank, the most 
 heavily fished areas being Northern Edge, Southeast 
 Georges, and the "Corner" between South Channel and 
 Georges Bank proper. The remaining 18 percent of 
 fishing effort was spread among the various Nova 
 Scotian banks, particularly Browns Bank, Emerald 
 Bank, Horseshoe Ground, and around Sable Island. 
 Other charts show the relative intensities in each 
 month of the year. The areas of most intense fish- 
 ing varied in location from month to month. The 
 relative importance of the Georges Bank grounds 
 varied from a low in April when 63.5 percent of the 
 total fishing effort was 3pent there, to a high in 
 October when 94.2 percent of the effort was spent 
 on these grounds.
