(California) Common Marine Bivalves of California . 
 by John E. Fitch, Fish Bulletin No. 90, 106 p., 
 illus., printed. Bureau of Marine Fisheries, 
 Department of Fish and Game, San Francisco, Calif., 
 1953. This bulletin is designed to provide au- 
 thorized names for the more common edible marine 
 bivalve mollusks of California. It covers 60 of 
 the more common clams, mussels, scallops , and oys- 
 ters of the State. It is also an attempt to as- 
 sess the economic importance to the State of these 
 bivalves by recording the extent and location of 
 the available bivalve-producing grounds , and the 
 number and abundance of the edible species. Also, 
 by contributing to a knowledge of their life his- 
 tories, lay the foundation for such protective 
 legislation as may in the future be found neces- 
 sary. It proposes to make available to the ama- 
 teur clam digger and amateur naturalist a means 
 of identifying the more common and important bi- 
 valves. It is meant as a guide for any person 
 interested in bivalve mollusks regardless of his 
 technical knowledge and background. This bulletin 
 includes sections on the names of bivalves; habits 
 and habitats; anatomy; locomotion; feeding and 
 nutrition; growth; reproduction; ecological re- 
 lationships; economic importance; clammingmethods 
 and gear; and preparation and use of clams as food. 
 It also includes a glossary of technical terms; a 
 key to some marine bivalves of California; a list 
 of common and scientific names; and descriptions 
 and illustrations „

 (Available in the United States from John D. Grif-

 able reference on the commercial aspects of the 
 fisheries. Touches upon all phases of the fish- 
 eries of the world— catch, processing, vessels, 
 gear, research, edible products and byproducts, 
 and recent developments and techniques in various 
 countries. Divided into two sections, the first 

part has articles on various phases of the fishery 
 industries and the second part is an extensive di- 
 rectory of firms engaged in the various branches 
 of those industries. The chapter "Around theWorld" 
 is a survey of the fisheries, fish processing, and 
 trade in Algeria, Australia, France, Greenland, 
 Greece, Israel, India, Japan, Malaya, Morocco, Mexi- 
 co, Netherlands, Norway, Persia, Fortugal, Spain, 
 Sweden, South Africa, United States, U. S. S. R., 
 and Yugoslavia. The fishery industries of Great 
 Britain, Denmark, Iceland, and the German Federal 
 Republic are treated more extensively in separate- 
 articles. Other chapters cover refrigeration prog- 
 ress in the fishing industry; the expansion of the 
 smoked salmon trade; world distribution of food 
 fish; and the 1951 annual report of the Internation- 
 al Council for the Exploration of the Sea. Most 
 of the statistics are for 1951. There are articles 
 on English fishery research; fish oils; the use of 
 measuring and controlling instruments ; developments 
 in fishing-vessel construction; and developments in 
 canning techniques. A fish supply calendar is in- 
 cluded, tabulated by type of fish, area of catch, 
 and months of supply. Among the lists are trade 
 journals of interest to the fishery industries; 
 organizations and trade associations; and an index 
 of fishing nets. A dictionary of fish names gives 
 the scientific, French, German, Norwegian, Danish, 
 Swedish, and Dutch names of a considerable number 
 of fish and shellfish. 

The second part of the book consists of a di- 
 rectory divided into industry classifications, with 
 the names of firms grouped by countries • Included 
 are: (1) exporters and curers, quick freezers, trawl- 
 er owners; (2) importers and wholesalers; (3) fish 
 canners and preservers; (4) machinery and equipment 
 for fish processing, refrigeration, etc.; (5) pack- 
 ing machinery, materials, etc.; (6) supplies for 
 fisheries; (7) fish byproducts (meal, oil, vitamins, 
 etc.); (8) cold storage and transport. Although 
 these directories do not list many United States 
 firms, the listings for the other countries seem to 
 be fairly extensive. Also included is a list of 
 trade marks, descriptions of the products merchan- 
 dised under them, and the producers and distribu- 
 tors using them. The last list in the book is a 
 "Buyers' Guide and Classified List of Advertisers." 
 This latest edition incorporates the "World Fish- 
 eries Year-Book," "North Atlantic Fisheries Year- 
 Book," and the "Herring Exporters Manual."
