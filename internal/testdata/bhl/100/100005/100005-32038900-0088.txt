 value and volume of trade with other nations and 
 value and volume of imports and exports of the 
 principal commodities traded with the United 
 States and the rest of the world. The 1950 sta- 
 tistics indicate a recovery over the earlier post- 
 war years in both production and trade by most of 
 the nations. Figures are also given for 1947, 1948, 
 and 1949 wherever available. The new yearbook 
 continues a series which has been issued by the 
 Department of Commerce annually since 1922, ex- 
 cept for the period 1939-47, when the disruption 
 of trade by the war and the subsequent unavail- 
 ability of information on many areas caused a 
 suspension.
