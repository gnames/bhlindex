"The Preservation of Fishing Nets, Trawl Twines and 
 Fibre Ropes for Use in Sea Water," by W. R. G. 
 Atkins and F. J. Warren, article, Journal of the 
 Marine Biological Association of the United King- 
 dom , vol. XXXI, no. 3, PP. 509-13, printed. Cam- 
 bridge University Press, Bentley House, N. W. 1, 
 London, 1953, 31s. 6d. net (US$4. 60). Describes a 
 series of seawater absorption and durabilitytests 
 made on sisal, manila, and coir rope that had been 
 treated with Cuprinol and tar, and on cotton net- 
 ting that had been treated with various copper 
 and aluminum compounds. Treating the different 
 ropes with Cuprinol and tar increased their wet 
 weight only slightly. Less water was absorbed 
 than without the preservative. Cotton netting 
 treated with copper naphthenate preservatives 
 lasted 9 months against 5i months for untreated 
 in clean seawater tests. Manila twine treated 
 with Cuprinol lasted 16 months against almost 9 
 for the untreated.

Review of Kenya Fisheries . 1951 . by Hugh Copley, 78 
 p., illus., printed. The Government Frinter, 
 Nairobi, Kenya. Reviews the Kenya fisheries for 
 1951, with special reference to the river fish- 
 eries, hatchery work, a fish-culture farm, and 
 the marine fisheries. The report on the marine 
 fisheries discusses production, prices, market- 
 ing and distribution, and types of gear. In- 
 cludes a list of the common fishes caught off 
 the Kenya coast (with their scientific, common, 
 and Swahili names) and a list of the poisonous 
 fishes. Also includes statistical data on the 
 yield of trout by river and area for the period 
 1938-51, and fish trap results. 

Western North Atlantic Bluefin Tuna Cooperative Re- 
 search Program . Progress Report No. 4, 53-4, An- 
 nual Report for Year 1952, 4 p. , processed. The 
 Marine Laboratory, University of Miami, Coral 
 Gables, Fla. Summarizes the 1952 activities of 
 the Marine Laboratory staff in the investigations 
 of the life history of the western North Atlantic 
 bluefin tuna ( Thunnus thynnus ). to be continued 
 during 1953. Such things as systematics, anatomy 
 and physiology, distribution, migrations, breed- 
 ing and development, behavior, and air and sur- 
 face observations are covered. Biometric data 
 indicate that there is no wholesale intermingling 
 between bluefin tuna of the western North Atlan- 
 tic and those of the eastern North Atlantic. New 
 records extend the known range of the bluefin as 
 far south as the north (Caribbean) coast of South 
 America, including the entire Caribbean area, the 
 Gulf of Mexico proper excepted. Observations 
 and plankton collections confirmed that the west- 
 ern edge of the Bahama Banks is at least part of 
 the breeding grounds of the bluefin during May 
 and June. Limited work with underwater hydro- 
 phones revealed no evidence of sounds being emit- 
 ted from the schools of tuna. Data were collec- 
 ted from the Caribbean, the Bahamas, New England, 
 Nova Scotia, and Europe.
