"NO- SMEAR" MEAT SAWING MAY BE APPLIED TO FROZEN FISH 

A "smear remover" for use in cutting meat with a power saw was recently de- 
 veloped by the U a So Department of Agriculture. It eliminates the bothersome and 
 time-consuming task of removing the "smear" by hand, and might be of use to fish 
 dealers who steak large quantities of frozen fish. 

"Smear" is bone dust and fat particles left on meat cuts by power saws. An 
 objectionable "sawdust," comparable to this "smear," occurs when large quantities 

of salmon, swordfish, or other 
 fish are steaked. This "smear" 
 or "sawdust" detracts from the 
 appearance of the cuts and can 
 contribute to bacterial growth. 

The "smear remover" con- 
 sists of a series of stainless 
 steel leaf -type springs, each 
 of which has one or more holes, 
 that are used to scrape the 
 outer surface of the meat as 
 it passes by the springs. The 
 holes for horizontally succes- 
 sive rows of springs are off- 
 set to permit scraping the en- 
 tire outer surface of the cut. 

To work properly, it is 
 necessary that the operator 
 hold the meat firmly against 
 the "smear remover" so that all

of the outer surface of the meat rubs against the attachment as the meat is pushed 
 past the saw. For many meat cuts this is said to take no more time than power 
 sawing without the "smear remover." Properly used, the attachment leaves meat 
 cleaner than when a scraper or a cloth is used. Operators have expressed the 
 opinion that it leaves the cut as clean as if made with a knife. 

Tests in two stores indicated that the "smear remover" increased production 
 of their cutting operations 20 to 30 percent on meat cuts requiring cleaning, and 
 saved 3 to 4g man-hours weekly in an average size supermarket. It is estimated 
 that the attachment will cost $60 to $75. Developers of the invention have made 
 their rights in it available to the public on a free-use basis.
