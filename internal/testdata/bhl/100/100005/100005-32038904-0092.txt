Federal regulations require that all 
 mailing lists be circularized periodically. 
 A cireularization letter dated May 15 was 
 sent to all those on the Commercial Fisher- 
 ies Review mailing list. ( Individuals or 
 firms who have requested their names added 
 to the mailing list subsequent to March 1, 
 1953, will not receive a cireularization 
 letter and will be retained on the mailing 
 list , unless the recipient meanwhile requests 
 that his name be removed. ) 

Firms or individuals who do not return 
 the cireularization letter will be dropped 
 from the Commercial Fisherie s Review mail- 
 ing list. The June 1953 issue will be the 
 last one to be mailed to those in the United 
 States who do not reply , and the August 1953 
 issue will be the last one for those in for- 
 eign countries. If you don't want to miss 
 any issues of the Review , return the cir- 
 eularization letter promptly. 

Comments or suggestions regarding the 
 Review will be appreciated by the editors.
