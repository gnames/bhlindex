TUNA FISHING AT TAHITI 

By Wilvan G. Van Campen* 

In February of this year the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service's vessel John R. Man - 
 ning, operating from Pacific Oceanic Fishery Investigations' Honolulu base andTishing 
 a series of tuna long-lining stations across the equatorial current system on 140° and 
 150° west longitude, put in at Papeete, Tahiti, for refueling. Some observations of 
 the Tahitian tuna fishery were made with the primary objective of picking up any infor- 
 mation on fishing methods which might be applicable elsewhere in the Pacific, particu- 
 larly in those United States island possessions which need an augmented protein food 
 supply or which are considered potential locations for tuna-cannery development. In 
 this latter connection, interest in the Tahitian situation was heightened by the fact that 
 on another recent POFI cruise some samples of tuna canned in Tahiti were obtained in 
 the Marquesas, and it was anticipated that Tahiti might prove to be a model of an iso- 
 lated tropical island with a small population and limited technical resources (i. e. like 
 America Samoa) which was nevertheless able to keep a tuna cannery in operation (as 
 Samoa has so notably not been able to do) . 

It vvas found, in fact, that the Tahitian tuna fishery is quite primitive in nature, and 
 that it has not proven capable of supporting even a modest canning industry in normal

times, although it does supply abundant and fairly cheap fresh fish to the Island's people. 
 The information obtained in the course of a brief stay at Papeete is necessarily incom- 
 plete, and is derived more from interviews with local people than from first-hand obser- 
 vation; however, it may be of some general interest in the absence of any more complete 
 accounts.
