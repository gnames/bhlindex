COMMERCIAL FISHERIES REVIEW

The tunas commonly taken at Tahiti are the yellowfin ( Neothunnus macrqpterus ). 
 called "thon" in French and " a' ahi" in Tahitian, and the skipjack ( Katsuwonus pelamis) . 
 called bonite in French and auhopu in Tahitian. No big-eyed tuna, albacore, or little 
 tuna were seen in the market, nor did the persons interviewed appear to recognize 
 descriptions of these species. Some informants spoke of another kind of tuna called 
 va 1 ©, apparently the dog-toothed tuna, which was said to be abundant around the reefs 
 and passes of the Tuamotus, though less common around the high islands. The yel- 
 lowfin and skipjack seen in the market and being unloaded from the fishing boats were 
 of very mixed sizes, ranging from an estimated 5 pounds to about 50 or 60 pounds each 
 in the case of yellowfin and to perhaps 40 pounds each for the skipjack. When the ob- 
 server remarked on the unusually large size (by Hawaiian standards of comparison) of 
 some of the skipjack, he was told that even larger ones — up to 70 pounds--were some- 
 times brought in. Although this might be an exaggeration, it is interesting to note that 
 a news story in the Pacific Fisherman of March 1950 contains a report of three-pole 
 skipjack tuna (75 pounds) taken by a Hawaii-based vessel which fished in the Tahiti 
 area. 

The Tahitian tuna boats are of uniform design, about 18 to 25 feet in length, and 
 very much like small sport-fishing cruisers in general appearance. They are powered 
 with 9 to 18 hp. Diesel engines of French manufacture. They carry no ice. The catch 
 is kept on the floor of the small cockpit. Their only water supply is a bottle filled on 
 the quay, and the only visible concession to comfort is a heap of dried leaves on the 
 roof which is supposed to keep the cockpit cool. Each boat carries three fishermen, 
 and there are said to be about 20 such boats at Tahiti, most of them based at Papeete. 
 The boats are almost all owned by people ashore, and the proceeds are split 50-50 be- 
 tween the owner and the fishermen. The operating radius of the fleet is about 30 miles 
 from Tahiti. The normal schedule is to put out to sea at around 8:00 a.m. and return 
 at anywhere from 5:00 p.m. to midnight. The boats fish all around the island of Tahiti, 
 often cross the 8-mile channel to Moorea, and sometimes go as far as the atoll of 
 Tetiaroa, 25 miles north of Tahiti, where the fishermen sleep on the beach all night. 

The tuna schools are located by sighting the flocks of birds which accompany them, 
 and the fishing is done with pole and line, using pearl-shell jigs of the traditional Poly- 
 nesian type. The poles, of which four or five are carried lashed along the gunwales on 

FIG. 2 - TAHITIAN TUNA LURES. THE SMALLER HOOK (3g- INCHES LONG ) IS OF THE TYPE USED FOR SKIPJACK, THE 
 LARGER (5g INCHES LONG) IS FOR LARGE YELLOWFIN. THE BODY OF THE LURE IS MADE FROM THE THICKEST PART 
 OF A PEARL OYSTER SHELL, THE HOOK IS OF BEATEN COPPER, AND THE TUFT OF PIG BRISTLES AT EACH SIDE OF 
 THE AFTER END IS SUPPOSED TO KEE.P THE JIG IN THE PROPER POSITION AS IT IS TRAILED ON THE SURFACE. 

each side of the boat, are about 12 to 16 feet long, of a light, thin-walled local bamboo. 
 They are perfectly plain, with no serving or wrapping on the grip. The line is slightly 
 shorter than the pole. While fishing, the boat is kept under way and moving with the 
 school at all times, and the pearl-shell jig is slapped and played on the surface in such 
 a way as to attract the tuna. Live bait is never used, nor is there any spray or splash- 
 ing of water over the lure. As in all islands where the Polynesian method of tuna fish- 
 ing is used, it is believed that fine nuances of color in different shell hooks in relation 
 to light conditions and to the color of the natural feed which the tuna are taking have an 
 important effect on the success of the fishing. While on a school, the fishermen change 
 lures frequently in order to find the one which will be most attractive to the fish. Dif- 
 ferences in color and sheen imperceptible to the unpracticed eye may give one hook a 
 very high value while another apparently identical one will be considered almost worth- 
 less. Pearl shells from certain islands, or from certain spots on the reefs of certain 
 islands, are reputed to make especially effective hooks.
