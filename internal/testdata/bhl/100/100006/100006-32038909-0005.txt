COMMERCIAL FISHERIES REVIEW 

In addition to the jigging of fish from surface schools, large tuna and marlin are 
 sometimes hand-lined from canoes at well-known "tuna holes" ('apo'o a'ahi), some of 
 which are quite close to the reef. Trolling appears to be completely unknown as a com- 
 mercial fishing method, but occasionally when a boat is fishing a school and large yellow- 
 fin tuna show up mixed with the smaller fish they are taken onhand lines with cut bait. 

The seasons for tuna fishing at Tahiti are said to be January-March and July- Au- 
 gust, but some fish are taken throughout the year. It was reported that the same sizes 
 of fish are present in Tahitian waters at all times of the year. Unfortunately., the sea- 
 sons of abundance of the tunas coincide with the peak seasons for the atule (big- eyed 
 scad, Selar crumenophthalmus ), which is generally preferred by the Tahitians. Thus, 
 when big catches of atule and tuna come into the market at the same time, the tuna may 
 be sold at give-away prices, or they may even have to be thrown away. No use is made 
 of refrigeration, nor 'of salting or sun-drying, to preserve fish. The market closes 
 at 7:00 p.m. and fish brought there after that hour are simply left to hang in very warm 
 air temperature until the next morning. Fortunately there are remarkably few flies in 
 Tahiti, but nevertheless much of the fish consumed around the island looks far from 
 fresh. It may be because of this general staleness of the raw material that the Tahi- 
 tians prepare most of their tuna or atule by marinating it in lime juice and salt and then 
 serving it in coconut cream. This is the staple fish dish, but large tuna are sometimes 
 baked in the imu or earth oven. 

A good day's catch for a Tahitian tuna boat is said to be 20 to 30 40-pound fish, 
 but from the writer's observations a proportionately larger number of 10- to 20-pound 
 fish would be more usual. The fish are tied by the tails with leaves into bunches of 2

to 8 or 10, depending on the size, hung on a carrying pole, and shoulder- carried about 
 3 blocks from the quay to the market. At the public market (a concrete-floored, open- 
 sided structure extending clear across one city block) the fish are hung up on iron rails 
 and sold by the fishermen or their womenfolk. No scales are used to weigh the fish. 
 They are sold individually for the most part. Smaller ones are sold by the bunch and 
 the larger tuna are halved or quartered. Prices are arrived at by haggling at each sale, 
 and may vary considerably between the opening and closing of the market. A fair aver-
