4 COMMERCIAL FISHERIES REVIEW Vol. 15, No. 10 

age was quoted as 40 to 60 francs(65<* to $1.00)for a 10 -pound tuna. The busiest time 
 at the market is early Sunday morning, when the people who have come into town for 
 Saturday night are purchasing fish and other foodstuffs to take back to the country with 
 them. At such times the market is the scene of extremely spirited activity, and the 
 guards are sometimes hard put to it to maintain order in the surging mob of compet- 
 ing shoppers. Aside from such traffic -directing duties, the chief concern of the mar- 
 ket attendants seem to be to see that all fish are hung off the floor on the iron rails 
 provided for that purpose. 

A small cannery formerly packed tuna at Papeete, and this was the source of the 
 samples obtained by POFI personnel in the Marquesas. The plant was established in 
 1939 in connection with a scheme for a pineapple industry, and when this fruit proved 
 to be unsuited to Tahiti's humid climate, the facilities were converted to the proces- 
 sing of yellowfin and skipjack tuna. The pack was put up in tall salmon cans, and most 
 of it was canned in coconut oil, although some imported salad oil was used. The oper- 
 ator used as much hand labor as possible, since labor is fairly cheap in Tahiti, and 
 worked up to a capacity of about 2 tons per day and an output of 2 to 3 thousand cases 
 per year. The average price paid for the fish ran around $80 a ton. No one connected 
 with the enterprise seems to have had any experience in fish packing, and the product, 
 which was not a solid pack, was probably rather crude and variable, but in the years 
 immediately after World War II, when food of any sort was in short supply in Europe, 
 the business prospered. The bulk of the pack was always sent to France. Only a small 
 amount of skipjack in coconut oil was sold in French Oceania. 

With the return of normal market conditions in France, this unorthdox product be- 
 came less saleable, and the cannery finally ceased operations in 1947. The machinery 
 has been dismantled and stored, and has been up for sale for several years. The for- 
 mer operator ascribes the failure of the enterprise to the irregular and unpredictable 
 supply of fish, the reluctance of jobbers to handle such a small number of cases, and 
 the effects of unsettled world conditions and transportation difficulties on his supply of 
 imported materials, chiefly tin plate. 

The story of tuna canning in Tahiti is in part merely a repetition of the same sad 
 tale which has been heard from other Pacific islands where the development of a tuna 
 industry has been tried â€” "no bait." Without the use of live bait, not enough fish could 
 be taken out of the surface schools to keep the cannery supplied, and the local fisher- 
 men lacked the knowledge and probably the capital to try long-lining. Vessels from 
 Hawaii with experienced live-bait fishermen prospected in Tahitian waters, but were 
 unable to find any adequate source of bait. Whether or not a tuna-canning industry can 
 be supported by long-line fishing in the central Pacific is a question which must wait 
 until someone makes the attempt, but the Tahitian experience seems to indicate that 
 fishing the surface schools by the Polynesian method, without the advantage which live- 
 bait confers, will not give enough return per unit of effort to produce a surplus of fish 
 for canning. 

On the other hand, the existing tuna fishery at Tahiti is evidence of the fact that an 
 adequate supply of fresh tuna for an island population' s needs can be obtained in the 
 ancient Polynesian way even in the absence of a live-bait supply. Islands where the sup- 
 ply of protein food is inadequate, where there are suitable stocks of tunas in nearby 
 waters, and where the natives are willing to exert themselves to catch tuna and to eat 
 them once they are caught, would appear to be promising locales for the introduction 
 (or reintroduction) of this method of fishing.
