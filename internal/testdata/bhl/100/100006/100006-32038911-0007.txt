DEEP-WATER TRAWLING SURVEY OFF THE 
 OREGON AND WASHINGTON COASTS 

(AUGUST 25 -OCTOBER 3, 1952) 
 By Dayton L. Alverson* 

SUMMARY 

A deep-trawling investigation off the Oregon and the Washington coasts was 
 conducted by the Service's exploratory fishing vessel John N. Cobb from August 25 
 to October 3j 1952. The work was carried on in deep water adjacent to the pres- 
 ent commercial fishing grounds of the local otter-trawl fleet. 

Exploratory fishing was confined between Cape Foulweather and Cape Lookout, 
 Oregon, and between Cape Elizabeth and Destruction Island, Washington. A total 
 of 48 otter-trawl drags were made at depths ranging from 100 to 400 fathoms. 

The continental slope off the Oregon coast was found to be rather gentle, 
 having a number of terraces, ridges, and hills. The bottom in this region is 
 mostly free of obstructions and suitable for trawl fishing. Off the Washington 
 coast the continental slope is quite steep, and a number of snags were encountered. 

Three commercially-utilized species of fish (Dover sole, sablefish, and 
 Pacific ocean perch) dominated the catches. Dover sole and Pacific ocean perch 
 were taken from depths between 100 and 240 fathoms. These two species were mixed 
 in catches made off Cascade Head, Oregon. Sablefish were taken over the complete 
 depth range fished; however, those in deep water were small and in poor shape. 

Other fish taken included varieties of red rockfish, arrowtoothed flounder, 
 rex sole, slender sole, hake, and several types of skates. Trash fish such as 
 hake and skates were taken in most drags, but they represented only a small por- 
 tion of the total catch. 

OBJECTIVES OF EXPLORATION 

In a continuation of the program initiated in the summer of 1951> the U. S. 
 Fish and Wildlife Service's exploratory fishing vessel John N. Cobb made a six- 
 week deep-water trawl exploration off the coasts of Oregon and Washington during 
 late summer and early fall of 1952. The objectives of this investigation were: 
 (l) to ascertain the availability and the abundance of marine bottom fishes in the 
 deep waters adjacent to the present commercial fishing grounds of the local otter- 
 trawl fleet; (2) to determine the commercial varieties of fishes inhabiting these 
 deeper waters; (3) to gain information regarding technical problems involved in 
 handling fishing gear in deep-water trawl work; and (4) to obtain catch informa- 
 tion which would be of value in analyzing the practicability of commercial ex- 
 ploitation of these regions. 

AREA EXPLORED 

Exploratory fishing was conducted off the coast of Oregon between latitudes 
 44째47' N. and 45째21' N. and off the coast of Washington between latitudes 47째22' N. 
 and 47째41' N. These areas roughly correspond to the waters between Cape Foul- 
 weather and Cape Lookout, Oregon, and between Cape Elizabeth and Destruction 
 Island, Washington. The vessel left Seattle on August 25, and spent the first
