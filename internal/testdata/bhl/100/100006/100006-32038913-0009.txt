The area explored off the Oregon coast measured 34 miles north and south and 
 extended nearly 40 miles offshore. The continental slopel/ in this region is 
 relatively gentle, having an average gradient of about 2 percent (Shepard 1948). 
 The width of the slope between the 100- and the 500-fathom contour lines varies 
 between 20 and 30 miles, and a number of terraces, ridges, and hills exist along 
 the gentle slope. Bottom samples from this region were predominantly mud; how- 
 ever, gravel and rock were found in a few localized areas. The bottom dragged 
 was mostly free of obstructions and suitable for trawl work. 

The area explored off the Washington coast measured 19 miles north and south 
 and extended 35 miles seaward. The slope characteristic in this region was some- 
 what steeper, with the average width between the 100- and the 400-fathom contour 
 lines being only 10 miles. Trawling bottom between 100 and 300 fathoms was poor 
 and a number of snags were encountered. Below 300 fathoms a small terraced region 
 was located which was free of obstructions. Bottom samples showed mud with some 
 stones or boulders. Several days were spent in an effort to locate favorable 
 bottom on the offshore seamount discovered by the John N. Cobb in 1950 (Powell, 
 Alverson, and Livingstone 1952); however, the fathograms showed only abrupt, steep 
 slopes unsuitable for trawling. 

METHODS USED 

Commercial fishermen familiar with the trawl-fishing grounds along the Ore- 
 gon and the Washington coasts assisted in laying out the desirable areas to be 
 investigated. This procedure minimized the overlapping of areas to be explored 
 with those already under exploitation by the otter-trawl fleet. 

The method of locating suitable trawling bottom was identical to that used 
 in the John N. Cobb's 1951 trawl exploration (Alverson 1951). Navigation charts 
 showing soundings were studied to learn the characteristics of the bottom topo- 
 graphy. Regions which appeared to be satisfactory for dragging operations were 
 sounded with a constant recording-type echo sounder, and if the resultant fatho- 
 gram was relatively uniform a drag was made. 

Trawling methods used were similar to those commonly employed by the Pacific 
 Northwest otter-trawl fleet. The net was set from the stern of the vessel and 
 picked up on the starboard side. Catches were placed into deck bins of known 
 cubic volume and the total weight of the fish was estimated from the occupied 
 volume. Various conversion factors (volumes to weight) used for the several dom- 
 inant species were obtained from data supplied by Seattle fish dealers. 

Drags were made for a period of one or two hours, depending on the depth and 
 type of bottom. Generally the deeper drags were towed for two hours. Positions 
 were determined from loran readings which were taken after the net had been set 
 and again at the time hauling of the gear began. 

TYPE OF GEAR 

All exploratory drags were made with a standard 400-mesh 'western trawl?/ 
 similar to the commercial trawl nets in use in the Pacific Northwest. Ten 8-inch- 
 diameter spherical aluminum floats were attached to the head rope of the trawl, 
 3 on each wing of the net, and 4 across the throat of the net. The 4 floats 
 across the throat of the net were th e "plane-type" with a lifting collar around 

2/the slope leading from the edge of the continental shelf (approximately ioo fathoms) to the 
 greater depths of the ocean.
