the lower portion of the sphere. Recent tests by British investigators (Anony- 
 mous 1952) have shown this type of float to be greatly superior in its lifting 
 ability as compared to other trawl floats of equal static bouyancy. 

RESULTS 

Detailed results of all exploratory drags have been tabulated and are pre- 
 sented in table 1. These drags are diagrammatically illustrated in figures 1 and 

2,3/ which also include areas of special 
 fishing interest, snags, and bottom con- 
 tour lines. The positions given in the 
 fishing log are the starting point of each 
 drag, and the courses are the resultant 
 direction between the starting point and 
 the end of each drag. For best results 
 in plotting drags given in the fishing 
 log, readers are referred to U. S. Coast 
 and Geodetic Survey Chart No. 6002, Colum- 
 bia River to Destruction Island, and No c 
 5902, Yaquina Head to Columbia River. 

Three commercially-utilized species 
 of fish — Dover sole ( Microstomu s pacificus ). 
 sablefish ( Anoplopoma fimbria ), and Pacific 
 ocean perch ( Sebastodes alutus ) — dominated 
 the catches. Dover sole and Pacific ocean 
 perch were taken in fair quantities between 
 100 and 225 fathoms, while sablefish were 
 taken somewhat deeper. The shaded areas 
 shown on figures 1 and 2 indicate regions 
 in which catches of the different species 
 of 500 pounds per hour or greater were 
 taken.

DOVER SOLE : This species was taken 
 off the Oregon coast generally mixed with 
 e best catches of Dover sole were taken west 
 from 200 to 22*2 fathoms. The bottom in this 
 composed of gray mud. Fair catches were also 
 120 to 122 fathoms. Samples of Dover sole 
 Head averaged 15 inches in length, with the 
 approximately equal. For best Dover-sole

SABLEFISH : These fish were taken in small quantities over the entire depth 
 range fished; however, sablefish from depths below 250 fathoms were usually small 
 and had a soft-flesh texture. Drag No. 10 in 300 to 304 fathoms, west of Cascade 
 Head, Oregon, produced 1,000 pounds of sablefish, but only 65 percent of the fish 
 were of marketable size. Fish taken from depths between 100 and 200 fathoms 
 appeared in good shape and averaged from 7 to 9 pounds in weight. 

PACIFIC OCEAN PERCH : This species was found to be the most abundant fish 
 taken during the 1952 deep-water trawl investigation. The best catches of Pacific 
 ocean perch were made between 120 and 230 fathoms. Below 250 fathoms the fish 

was seldom taken. 

Good catches were made off the Oregon coast from Nestucca Bay
