south to Cape Foulweather. Drag No. 39 (not shaded on the chart) produced a good 
 show of Pacific ocean perch, but the bag tie-line broke and the catch was lost. 
 A fair catch of this fish was also made southwest of Destruction Island, Washing- 
 ton, in 100 fathoms.

Practically all of the Pacific ocean perch taken off the Oregon and the Wash- 
 ington coasts were of commercially acceptable size (of several hundred fish exam- 
 ined, no immature specimen was noted). For best Pacific ocean perch catches see 
 drags 13, 16-19, 21-23, 30 and 45. 

OTHER ROCKFISH : A number of other species of rockfish were found commonly 
 associated with catches of Pacific ocean perch. These included the black-mouthed 

rockfish ( Sebastodes crameri ) , the pop-eyed 
 rockfish ( Sebastodes saxicola ) , the black- 
 throated rockfish ( Sebastodes introniger ) , 
 the rosy rockfish ( Sebastodes rosaceus ) , 
 the split-nosed rockfish ( Sebastodes diplo- 
 pros ) , and the round-finned rockfish (Se- 
 bastolobus alascanus ) . Of these species, the 
 pop-eyed rockfish is the most difficult to 
 distinguish and separate from the Pacific 
 ocean perch.

OTHER FISH TAKEN :

setta exilis ), hake ( Merluccius productus ) . 
 and many species of red rockfish were com- 
 mon in deep-water hauls. English sole 
 ( Parophrys vetulus ), petrale sole ( Eopsetta 
 jordani ), lingcod ( Ophiodon elongatus ), and" 
 the varieties of black rockfish taken by 
 trawlers fishing the continental shelfwere 
 almost entirely absent from catches made 
 below 100 fathoms. Trash fish, such as 
 hake and several varieties of skates, were 

taken in the majority of the drags; however, they generally represented only a 

small percentage of the total catch.
