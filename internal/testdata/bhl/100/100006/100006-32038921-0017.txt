CONSUMERS' CANNED FISH PREFERENCES 

Canned salmon, for many years the number one choice of consumers of 
 canned fish in the United States, still held the lead in consumer preference as 
 recently as 1951. This was found in a national con- 
 sumer survey (Fish and Shellfish Preferences of 
 Household Consumers ) conducted during that year by 
 the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Nearly 63 per- 
 cent of those contacted in the survey mentioned salm- 
 on when asked what kind of canned fish they served. 
 Tuna, nearly as popular, was named by 56 percent. 
 Sardines (13 percent) and mackerel (2 percent) fell 
 far behind the two leading varieties. 

The regional pattern of preferences for canned 
 fish was surprisingly varied. The people in areas 
 with a high proportion of rural families had a definite 
 preference for salmon, whereas areas with higher 
 urban populations preferred canned tuna. An exam- 
 ple of this was found in comparing the survey findings in the South with those 
 in the Northeast. In the South, which is considered basically rural, salmon 
 was preferred over tuna by a ratio of 2 to 1 (73 percent used salmon, while 
 36 percent used tuna). In the Northeast, an area with a large urban population, 
 76 percent of the consumers used tuna, compared to 55 percent who said they 
 served salmon. Use of sardines appeared to follow somewhat the same area 
 pattern as salmon, with the largest percentage of sardine users found in the 
 South, and the smallest percentage found in the Northeast. 

IntheWest, which accounts for most of the production of salmon, tuna, and 
 sardines, it was noted that tuna took first place in consumers' preferenceby a 
 wide margin. Almost 70 percent of the consumers in this area used tuna, but 
 only 46 percent reported buying salmon. In the Midwest area, the situation was 
 reversed, since almost 70 percent used salmon but only 50 percent used tuna.
