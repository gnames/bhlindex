REFRIGERATION : Freezing Fish at Sea , Defrosting , Filleting, and Refreezingthe 
 Fillets: VESSEL: Two attempts were made by the research trawler Delaware to carry 
 out full-scale fishing and freezing fish at sea operations. After about 16, 500 pounds of 
 haddock had been caught and brine-frozen, the first of these test cruises (Cruise No. 
 22, completed August 24) was interrupted due to difficulties with the ammonia pumps of 
 the refrigerating equipment. The catch from the 5-day cruise consisted of 14, 000 pounds 
 of scrod haddock and 2, 500 pounds of large haddock. These fish were caught and frozen 
 during about one day of round-the-clock fishing and freezing operations. Two types of 
 chutes, both still in the experimental stage, for moving the frozen fish from the freezer 
 tank to the frozen storage holds were tested. Results obtained with the chutes were quite 
 favorable. 

After 44, 000 pounds of groundfish had been caught and brine -frozen, the second of 
 these cruises was terminated September 4 due to the jamming of the elevator chains of 
 the brine -freezer mechanism. Fishing took place on Western Bank in the area of Sable 
 Island. The catch on this 9-day cruise consisted of 25, 000 pounds of scrod haddock, 
 14, 000 pounds of large haddock, 4, 000 pounds of cod, and 1, 000 pounds of pollock. The 
 haddock and scrod haddock were sold over the New England Fish Exchange to fillet proc- 
 essors, while the cod and pollock were stored in commercial cold storage by the labora- 
 tory for obtaining data on the cold-storage characteristics of these fish. 

During the month the ammonia pumps were repaired and the elevator chains revised 
 to eliminate the difficulties experienced during full-scale continuous operation. Also, 
 additional fuel tanks on the vessel were placed in good condition so as to permit longer 
 test cruises and extended periods of fishing.

NUTRITION: Discoloration in Canned Tuna : The technologist assigned to the project 
 visited the plant and laboratory in Chicago of the can company sponsoring the project to 
 obtain basic information on the manufacture of cans and can enamels, and for current data 
 on the problem of discoloration in canned tuna. A trip was also made on a commercial 
 tuna fishing vessel operating out of a California port. Samples of albacore tuna were ob-
