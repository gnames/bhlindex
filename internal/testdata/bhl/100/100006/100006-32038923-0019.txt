ANALYSIS AND COMPOSITION : Composition of Fish : The proximate composition 
 of individual samples of sheepshead ( Aplodinotus grunniens ) from various areas and of 
 squawfish ( Ptychocheilus grandis ) from the Columbia River was determined. A detailed 
 study is being made of the variation in composition of sheepshead from different areas 
 and for different seasons of the year. The results are as follows:
