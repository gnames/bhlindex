CANNED TUNA GOLDEN ANNIVERSARY 

National Tuna Week will be celebrated November 5 
 of the tuna canning industry. 

to 14, the 50th Anniversary 

Fifty years ago the tuna industry consisted 
 of one cannery in San Pedro, California, sup- 
 plied by a few boats fishing in nearby waters. 
 Thus originated the industry that has made avail- 
 able the canned tuna now so abundant in our food 
 markets. 

For versatility, canned tuna wins the home- 
 maker's vote every time whether it's a full- 
 fledged meal for the whole family or a quick snack 
 for hungry youngsters. Protein- rich tuna is the 
 perfect ingredient for many types of dishes. Nu- 
 tritious salads and cold-weather casseroles are 
 easily made andin short order when several cans 
 of this fine food are handy on your kitchen shelf. 

For a quick snack that the children will love, the home economists of the Fish 
 and Wildlife Service suggest a Tuna Waldorf Salad.
