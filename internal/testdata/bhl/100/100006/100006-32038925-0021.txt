PROGRESS ON FISHERY TECHNOLOGICAL RESEARCH 
 PROJECTS, FISCAL YEAR 1953 

A discussion of the Fishery Technological Research Program for fiscal year 1952 
 (July 1, 1951, to June 30, 1952) appeared in the November 1951 Supplement of Commer - 
 cial Fisheries Review, vol. 13, No. 11a, pp. 2-7 (also reprinted as Separate 294) . A re- 
 view of the progress made in each project during fiscal year 1952 appeared in the De- 
 cember 1952 Supplement of Commercial Fisheries Review, vol. 14, No. 12a, pp. 1-7 
 (Separate 327). The program for fiscal year 1952 was continued for fiscal year 1953 
 (July 1,1952, to June 30, 1953). New projects were added during the year as the old 
 ones were completed or as the need for specific information arose. Progress on each 
 project from July 1, 1952, to June 30, 1953, was as follows: 

REFRIGERATION 

FREEZING FISH AT SEA , DEFROSTING , FILLETING , AND REFREEZING THE 
 FILLETS: Fishing Operations and Overhaul of the "Delaware:" Cruises during the sum- 
 mer and fall of 1952 permitted thorough testing of the freezing and cold-storage facili- 
 ties on the Delaware. Fish were supplied for pilot-plant, laboratory and storage stud- 
 ies, and other phases of the project. Round fish brine frozen at sea were landed at the 
 Boston Fish Pier and sold to producers for commercial processing into fillets. 

The Delaware was drydocked and placed in good operating condition. A ventilator 
 was installed on the main deck aft and forward of the trawl winch to supply fresh air to 
 the refrigeration machinery room. 

Freezing and Storage of Fish Aboard the "Delaware:" Results of modifications in 
 the experimental refrigeration plant and fish-freezing equipment, and expansion of the 
 cold-storage hold were observed during the seven test cruises conducted from June to 
 October 1952. Recent alterations to the brine cooler are expected to increase the fish- 
 freezing capacity from 550 pounds to about 1,200 pounds an hour. 

A new type freezer mechanism is now under construction and has been designed 
 to (a) permit the loading and unloading of the freezer at deck level, (b) increase freezer 
 capacity 50 percent, and (c) increase cold-storage capacity in the hold. 

Unloading , Storing , and Processing Ashore: Some progress was made in develop- 
 ing methods for unloading the vessel and handling brine-frozen fish. Procedures nor- 
 mally employed at Boston for unloading iced fish were modified slightly to provide a 
 partially satisfactory method for unloading frozen fish. From the dock into the cold- 
 storage plant the frozen fish were moved in boxes (of a variety of sizes), on four-wheel 
 hand trucks. Experiments with mechanical conveyors and self-unloading boxes for mak- 
 ing these operations more expeditious are contemplated. 

Large lots (5 to 10 tons) of brine -frozen haddock were held in commercial cold 
 storage and removed at intervals to determine the effect of such storage on the subse- 
 quent handling of the fish and the quality of fillets produced therefrom. Improvements 
 in the preparation or storage procedures, such as glazing or other means of preventing 
 desiccation, appear to be desirable before storage periods longer than two months can 
 be recommended for frozen haddock held in the round. 

Defrosting methods whereby the fish were held in circulating water at 60Â° F. or 
 lower were found to be very satisfactory. Detailed technical information on thawing 
 methods and equipment were made available to the industry. 

Laboratory Tests : The various lots of frozen fillets prepared from round brine- 
 frozen and iced gutted haddock landed by the Delaware have been evaluated for quality by 
 taste panel, chemical, and physical testing. Results of tests made on haddock fillets 
 held for 12 months in frozen storage showed no appreciable differences between the qual- 
 ity of the fillets prepared from round brine-frozen fish and those from iced gutted fish. 
 A consumer taste panel composed of about 125 families in the Boston area has been par-
