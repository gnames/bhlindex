ticipating in a number of tests with various lots of fillets from brine-frozen and iced 
 gutted fish. The fillets, identified only by a code unknown to the panel members, are 
 cooked and served in the home by the housewife. On the basis of several such tests, the 
 results indicate that fillets from round brine-frozen haddock are at least equally as ac- 
 ceptable as those from iced gutted haddock, and in some instances there might be a 
 slight preference for the fillets from the brine-frozen fish. 

Tests of various solutionsfor attaining immersion-freezing temperatures of about 
 -15°F. showed some promise. The suitability of such solutions islimited (l)by the 
 necessity of meeting certain acceptability requirements for food and(2) the needfor ob- 
 taining certain physical properties with existing freezing equipment aboard the vessel. 

Comprehensive tests to determine the degree of salt penetration into the meat of 
 haddock during freezing in brine at various temperatures and brine concentrations are 
 well under way. Tests are also in progress to determine the effect on weight, salt up- 
 take, and drip of fillets dipped inbrine solutions of various concentrations. This infor- 
 mation is particularly desirable in connection with fillets that have beenprepared from 
 brine-frozen fish and which might contain slightly more salt than those from iced fish. 

FREEZING AND STORING ALASKA SHRIMP AND DUNGENESS CRAB MEAT : 
 Alaska Shrimp : Storage tests of frozen precooked shrimp were completed. The effects 
 of brine-cooking procedures, packaging methods, and storage temperatures at 0° F. and 
 10° F. on the keeping quality were determined. Emphasis was given to those factors re- 
 sponsible for toughening of the shrimp during the preparation and storage. Significant 
 conclusions were: (l)the texture of precooked pink shrimp varied widely in any given 
 lot processed under uniform conditions; (2) use of minimum cooking time and low salt 
 concentration in the brine precook process resulted in superior texture and minimum 
 shrinkage of the meats; recommended precook is 1 minute in 5-percent brine by weight; 
 (3) keeping quality wasimproved markedlyby floodingthe shrimp with dilute brine(2 per- 
 cent by weight) or by vacuum packing (18 to 20 inches of vacuum) in hermetically- sealed 
 containers (storage life underthese conditions waslonger than 8 months at 0°F.);(4)use 
 of 0. 3 percent dry monosodium glutamate in dry-packed shrimp meat did not improve keep- 
 ing quality. 

Dungeness Crab Meat : Storage tests are in progress on the effect of storage tem- 
 perature and packaging methods on keeping quality of the frozen meat. Samples have been 
 examined at intervals during 6 months of storage. The highest quality packs with a stor- 
 age life greater than 6 months were: (l)crab meat flooded with dilute brine (2 percent 
 salt by weight) packed in sealed cans and stored at 0° F; (2) vacuum-packed (18 to 20 inches 
 of vacuum) crab meat in cans stored at -20° F.; (3) vacuum-packed crab meat incans stored 
 at 0° F. Crab meat packed in cans under atmospheric pressure or in plastic containers 
 and stored at0°F. was of inferior quality and had a storage life of less than 6 months. 

Frozen Shrimp Cocktail : Tests are in progress on the keeping quality of frozen 
 shrimp cocktail packed in hermetically- sealed cans stored at 0° F. 

PREPARATION OF MANUAL ON THE REFRIGERATION OF FISH : The protracted 
 illness of the original project leader caused considerable delay in the laying of the ground- 
 work for the manual. His death necessitated the reassignment of the project. Advantage 
 was taken, however, of this reassignment to reappraise the scope and coverage of the 
 manual in the light of the information collected by the original project leader. Subse- 
 quently an entirely revised and more detailed outline of the subject matter to be included 
 was prepared and circulated to a number of industry's fish refrigeration specialists for 
 their comments and suggestions. The many helpful comments received were incorpor- 
 ated. The preparation of material for the manual on the refrigeration of fish is goingfor- 
 ward along the lines indicated as most needed and acceptable to the fish-refrigeration 
 industry. 

EFFECT OF STORAGE CONDITIONS ON QUALITY OF FROZEN FISH: No work 
 was carried out on this project. The project was completed during the last fiscal year 
 except for the final phase involving commercial- scale tests. This experiment would 
 require large quantities of fish and it was planned to use any tuna landed by the Service's 
 exploratory vessel John N. Cobb . Due to poor fishing conditions, sufficient fish were 
 not landed to carry out the experiments.
