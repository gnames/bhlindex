QUALITY STANDARDS FOR HADDOCK FILLETS : This project was initiated dur- 
 ing the latter part of the fiscal year to setup criteria for comparing the quality of haddock 
 fillets prepared from fishfrozen at sea with commercially-processedfillets prepared 
 from fish iced at sea. No work was carried out during the fiscal year on this project. 

STUDY OF CAUSE OF TEXTURE CHANGE OF CANNED SALMON PREPARED 
 FROM FROZEN FISH: Studies have shown that the physical destruction of the cell walls 
 of the meat of salmon during freezing and storage is at least partially responsible for 
 the toughening of the product on subsequent canning. Excessive curd formation on can- 
 ning does not appear to be caused by the physical changes during freezing, but does ap- 
 pear to be related to a chemical change in the meat protein which releases the soluble 
 protein fraction causing the formation of a proteinaceous curd during heat processing. 
 Studies have been started on this latter problem. 

Tests with the pretreatment of the cut sections from thawed salmon have shown 
 that curd formation during subsequent heat processing may be minimized by dipping the 
 sections one minute either in saturated NaCl brine or a 5-percent solution of tartaric acid. 
 The acid treatment was more effective in these tests. Analysisof canned salmon treated 
 with tartaric acid showed that the product contained 0. 03 per cent by weight of tartaric acid. 

METHODS OF PRESERVING AND FREEZING SHRIMP ASHORE AND AT SEA IN 
 THE GULF OF MEXICO : Limited tests were conducted at sea and ashore in the Gulf 
 of Mexico to study methods of handling and freezing shrimp. Whole shrimp and shrimp 
 tails were frozen at sea in refrigerated brine (5° F. to 10° F.) and placed in cold stor- 
 age at 0° F. Frozen whole shrimp were thawed ashore, headed, packaged, andrefrozen. 
 All frozen packaged shrimp were glazed. Comparisons of brine-frozen, refrozen, and 
 air-frozen shrimp tails were made during 9 months of storage at 0° F. The results 
 indicate: (1) brine-frozen shrimp which were later thawed, headed, packaged, and re- 
 frozen had excellent appearance, flavor, and texture during 9 months of storage; 
 (2) shrimp (brine- or air-frozen at sea immediately after catching) were free of any 
 black-spot discoloration; (3) no excessive salt absorption was found in fresh whole shrimp 
 frozen in brine at 10° F. for periods less than 4 hours; (4) absorption of salt increased 
 when shrimp were held in refrigerated brine for periods longer than 4 hours; (5) salt 
 absorption was significantly higher in iced shrimp frozen in brine as compared to shrimp 
 frozen in brine immediately after catching; (6) the most important factor causing loss 
 in quality of frozen packaged shrimp during storage was dehydration of surface shrimp 
 after the ice glaze evaporated at the corners and edges of the package. 

COLD - STORAGE LIFE OF HALIBUT : The cold-storage life of halibut stored as 
 dressed (heads off) and as steaks is being determined as a guide to possible future modi- 
 fication of Federal Specifications. After 9 months of storage at0°F. , halibut stored as 
 dressed fish were superior in quality to those stored as steaks. Steaks sliced from 
 dressed halibut that were stored for 6 month sat 0° F. were layer-packed in cartons and then 
 stored at various temperatures for an additional 3 months. The samples stored at 20° F. 
 were rated unacceptable; the steaks stored at 0°F. , -15°F. , and -20° F. were rated ac- 
 ceptable, with the steaks stored at -20° F. showing the least change in flavor. 

COLD - STORAGE LIFE OF KING AND SILVER SALMON : Studies in connection 
 with Federal Specification requirements showed that dressed chinook and silver salmon 
 which were frozen, ice-glazed, stored at 0° F. , and reglazed at 3-month intervals were 
 still of good quality after six months of storage. Steaks cut from similar fish immedi- 
 ately after freezing when ice-glazed and stored in institutional size wax paper-lined car- 
 tons, passed out of the top quality range at the end of 6 months. 

FREEZING , GLAZING , AND THAWING SALMON TO BE CANNED : Studies were 
 made on the feasibility of glazing brine-frozen salmon and on the effect of different thaw- 
 ing technics on the quality of the pack of canned salmon resulting therefrom. 

The salt absorbed by brine-frozen fish interferes with successful ice glazing at the 
 storage temperatures commonly used commercially (0° F. to 10° F.). The glaze taken 
 by brine-frozen Alaska red salmon at 0° F. was not considered satisfactory; however, 
 the glaze taken at -20° F. was good. Since glazing of the brine-frozen salmon does not 
 appear feasible at the storage temperatures now used by the freezerships (about 5° F.), 
 these fish will be more susceptible to dehydration and oxidative deterioration upon pro-
