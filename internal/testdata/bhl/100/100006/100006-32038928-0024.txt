longed storage. Therefore, it is highly important to process these fish as soon after 
 freezing as possible in order to have a good quality canned product. 

In order to compensate for the salt absorbed during brine freezing it was neces- 
 sary to reduce the amount of salt added to each can up to as much as 50 percent of the 
 amount normally added to cans packed from fresh salmon. Different thawing methods-- 
 in running water, in still water, or in air- -did not affect the quality of the canned fish.

INVESTIGATION OF THE TOUGHENING OF FROZEN BLUE CRAB MEAT: Prac- 
 tically no work was done on the problem of identifying the enzymes which may be in- 
 volved in the change of texture of frozen crab meat because a research fellowship stu- 
 dent could not be obtained. 

FEEDING STUDIES WITH GUMS EXTRACTED FROM IRISH MOSS : Gums are 
 being extracted commercially from Irish moss, and derivatives of these are being used 
 in foods and pharmaceutical preparations. Rats and mice have been allotted to 5 com- 
 parable groups and are fed a balanced ration to which has been added 0, 1, 5, 15, and 
 25 percent gum. The animals have now been on experiment for about two years. It 
 is expected that the experiment will be concluded during the summer or early fall of 
 the coming year. The data to date indicate that the product is wholesome. 

CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF FISH AND SHELLFISH PROTEINS : 
 A fundamental study of the water retentivity of the meat of fish, with particular refer- 
 ence to the mechanism of drip formation in frozen fish, is being continued. It was 
 found that the concentration of nitrogen in the drip from rockfish stored at 0Â° F. varied 
 inversely with storage time. The drip produced by gravity was a more sensitive meas- 
 ure of the changes occurring in the fish during frozen storage than was the fluid pro- 
 duced by centrifugation. The studies indicate that ground fish can be used in place of 
 whole fish pieces in drip studies, with a gain not only in the homogeniety of the material 
 but also in the sensitivity of the measurements. Considerable information was obtained 
 on the characteristics of drip formation under various temperature and physical condi- 
 tions . 

THIAMIN AS E CONTENT OF CERTAIN SPECIES OF FISH USED IN FEEDING 
 FUR ANIMALS : Samples of fillet waste from cod, sole, and rockfish, and cannery 
 waste from the various salmon were found to contain negligible amounts of the enzyme 
 thiaminase. The project was terminated during the early part of the fiscal year. 

A STUDY TO DETERMINE THE COMPARATIVE HEMOPOIETIC VALUE OF FISH : 
 An 8-week metabolism study was conducted during the fall in cooperation with the Col- 
 lege of Home Economics of the University of Maryland. A group of 10 girls consumed 
 a basal diet low in protein and adequate in vitamins, minerals, and calories. Five girls 
 received a daily allowance of animal protein in the form of haddock fillets and the other 
 five received theirs in the form of sirloin of beef. Blood samples were taken every 2 
 weeks. During the year, analyses of protein, fat, ash, and iron have been conducted 
 on the samples of foods, urine, and feces collected in this metabolism trial or the one 
 that was conducted year before last. Two master-of-science-degree theses on this work 
 were published during the year. The work will continue during the coming year. 

DEVELOPMENT OF SPECIALTY FOOD PRODUCTS FROM ALASKA FISH AND 
 EDIBLE PORTIONS OF FISH WASTE : Development work has been concluded on the pre- 
 paration of a pasteurized smoked salmon egg spread; canned, smoked, and pickled her- 
 ring specialty products; canned smoked butter clams, and canned smoked shrimp. Stor- 
 age tests of inoculated packs of salmon egg spread are in progress at the National Can- 
 ners Association Laboratory, Berkeley, California, in order to determine whether the 
 product may be stored safely at room temperature. Preliminary tests were made on 
 the utilization of Alaska whitefish. Studies are in progress on the preparation of a can- 
 ned smoked spread from frozen chum salmon and pink salmon trimmings (edible por- 
 tions from salmon cannery waste) .
