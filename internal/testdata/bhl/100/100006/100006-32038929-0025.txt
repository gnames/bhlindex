October 1953 COMMERCIAL FISHERIES REVIEW 23 

ANALYSIS AND COMPOSITION 

CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF FISH : (1) Menhaden : No work was carried out on 
 this project during the fiscal year. 

COOPERATIVE WORK WITH THE AOAC ON THE DETERMINATION OF OIL IN 
 FISH MEAL : Some preliminary work has indicated that the rapid acid hydrolysis-- 
 Mojonnier tube method — which works well for the meat of fish may (by suitable modifi- 
 cation in the hydrolysis procedure) be adaptable to fish meal. Previous tests had in- 
 dicated that only a part of the oil could be recovered from fish meal by this method. 
 Work is continuing on the modification of the hydrolysis step to see whether this simple 
 procedure can be applied to fish meal. 

COMPOSITION AND COLD - STORAGE LIFE OF FRESH-WATER FISH: Proximate 
 chemical composition of the edible portion and waste have been determined for blue 
 pike, yellow pike, yellow perch, whitefish, and sheepshead from Lake Erie; chub and 
 smelt from Lake Michigan; lake trout from Lake Superior; carp, buffalofish, and 
 sheepshead from the Mississippi River; and carp and bullhead from a small lake. 

Samples of the frozen fresh-water fish were placed in cold storage to determine 
 their keeping qualities at 0° F. Blue pike, yellow pike, yellow perch, whitefish, and 
 sheepshead showed some deterioration in quality by the end of the 12-months' storage 
 period; however, all species were judged edible. Lake Michigan smelt and Columbia 
 River smelt had cold-storage life of 6 to 7 months and 3 to 6 months, respectively; 
 both developed off-flavors in the belly flaps after 3 months of storage. The keeping 
 quality of lake trout fillets varied considerably; one fillet was inedible after 3-months' 
 storage whereas other fillets were still acceptable after 8-months 1 storage. 

BYPRODUCTS 

VITAMIN CONTENT AND NUTRITIVE VALUE OF FISHERY BYPRODUCTS: Ex- 
 periments on the Unidentified Growth Factor (s) in Fish: Laboratory procedures have 
 been established for the preparation of fish-liver concentrates containing the growth 
 factor. A microbiological assay has been developed which permits rapid measurement 
 of this growth factor. Studies now under way are directed at correlating the growth 
 response as measured microbiologically with that measured by rat assay. Experiments 
 also are being carried out with the object of obtaining the growth factor in pure crystal- 
 line form. 

Vitamin Analyses : Twenty-three samples (600 bags each) of pilchard meal were 
 analyzed. On a moisture-free and oil-free basis the average for niacin was 84 micro- 
 grams per gram and for vitamin B12, 0.27. Twenty-one samples of individual bags of 
 tuna meal averaged 0. 33 micrograms of vitamin B12 per gram of meal. These tuna 
 meal samples are being analyzed for their riboflavin and niacin content. Meals prepared 
 from menhaden, anchovy, whale loins, mackerel, mackerel offal, herring, and crab 
 were also assayed. 

Biological Assays and Evaluation : a. During the previous year a number of assays 
 with chicks were conducted to determine the vitamin B12 content of fish meals and fish 
 solubles. The Seattle laboratory completed the microbiological assay on the same sam- 
 ples during this year. A limited number of reassays will be conducted during the com- 
 ing year to determine causes of differences noted. Some bioassays of the dried solubles 
 products are contemplated during the coming year. 

b. Due to the relatively large amounts of fish oils available and the comparatively 
 low market value, feeding tests were conducted with broilers to determine the feasibil- 
 ity of adding these oils to commercial poultry and swine feeds. The first series of ex- 
 periments indicated that menhaden oil could be fed at levels of 2 to 8 percent without ad- 
 versely affecting the health, feathering, or color of skin and shanks of the birds. Even 
 the lowest level fed, however, gave a fishy flavor to the meat so it could not be recom- 
 mended. A second series of experiments is now under way feeding oil from to 2 per- 
 cent by 2 percent increments. The results should indicate conservative levels which 
 may be fed without affecting the flavor of the meat.
