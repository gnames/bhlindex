c. A limited number of meals and condensed fish solubles were fed late last year 
 to chicks to determine the nutritive value of the protein. Variable results were obtained 
 which could not be correlated with known differences in raw materials or the process- 
 ing methods used. More extensive tests are expected to be carried out on this project 
 during the coming year. 

UTILIZATION OF VISCERA FROM ROUND ( WHOLE ) FISH FROZEN AT SEA : 
 No work was done on this product due to the shortage of laboratory personnel. 

STUDY OF PHARMACEUTICAL AND OTHER INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS FROM 
 SALMON EGGS : Amino Acid Content of Salmon Egg Protein: The "essential" amino 
 acid content of roe at different stages of maturity from the five species of Pacific salmon 
 has been determined by microbiological-assay methods. The distribution of amino 
 acids in the roe was generally uniform, being significantly altered only by maturity. 
 Most of the amino acids were present in increasing quantities with increasing maturity. 
 The average amino-acid content of mature roe from the five species of salmon in per- 
 centage of protein was: arginine 7.1; histidine 2.8; isoleucine 7.3; leucine 10.0; lysine 
 8.8; methionine 2.9; phenylalanine 4.9; threonine 5. 9; tryptophane 1.0; and valine 7.3. 
 A preliminary report has been submitted for publication. 

The Fatty Acids of Salmon-Egg Oils : The long chain of unsaturated fatty acids 
 present in salmon-egg oil have considerable promise for specialized applications, but 
 basic information is lacking on the fatty acid fractions. A study of salmon-egg oil has 
 been initiated with particular emphasis on the unsaturated fraction. 

DEVELOPMENT OF A DRIED PRODUCT FROM CONDENSED MENHADEN SOL- 
 UBLES QR STICKWATER : This project has three interlocking phases : (a) sample col- 
 lection, (b) analysis of solubles, and (c) preparation and a chemical-physical study of 
 dry "solubles." The field work, determined by the seasonal nature of the fishery, was 
 made as extensive as possible because of the wide variability in the solubles produced 
 from different plants, by different equipment, and in different areas. Eventually, sam- 
 ples were obtained from all but two of the 20 plants which produced solubles duringthe 
 1952 season. 

The analytical work on the solubles supplied background information (completely 
 lacking in the literature) on the physical and chemical properties of the product. This 
 information was essential to the evaluation of the third phase- -the preparation of a 
 satisfactory dry product from solubles. 

A pilot- plant-size drum dryer, with 6x6 inch drum, was ordered in July 1952, 
 but delivery was not made until January 1953. Thus less than six weeks were available 
 for the actual study of the drying operation. In this time, 24 dry samples have been 
 prepared. These include a straight run of almost all of the soluble samples on hand. 
 These dry samples are now being studied as to composition, and especially their hygro- 
 scopic properties. It is expected that differences in both the behavior in the drying op- 
 eration and in water absorption can be related to other properties of the solubles, and 
 that some correlations may be found which will aid in the ultimate object of explaining 
 and controlling the principal difficulty in producing a satisfactory product, namely, ex- 
 cessive hygroscopicity of the dry material.
