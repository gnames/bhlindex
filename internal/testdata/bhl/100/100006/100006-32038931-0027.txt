PROGRAM FOR FISHERY TECHNOLOGICAL RESEARCH, 

FISCAL YEAR 1954 

The program for fishery technological research for Fiscal Year 1954 (July 1, 
 1953, to June 30, 1954) was developed on the basis of recommendations from members 
 of the fishing industry. When the amount of funds allotted to the Section was known, 
 the assignment of projects was made after taking into consideration the location, fa- 
 cilities, and personnel at each of the four technological laboratories. For ready ref- 
 erence all projects assigned for Fiscal Year 1954 are listed by general field of study. 

NUTRITION 

1. Investigation of the Toughening of Frozen Blue-Crab Meat (cooperative project 
 sponsored by the Refrigeration Research Foundation) --continued project: Practically 
 no work was done last year on the problem of identifying the enzymes which may be in- 
 volved in the change of texture of frozen crab meat because a research fellowship stu- 
 dent could not be obtained. The project will be activated as soon as a fellow is avail- 
 able. A technologist will supervise a graduate student on this project. (College Park) 

2. Chemical and Physical Properties of Fish and Shellfish Proteins (continued 
 project): This study is directed toward providing basic information on the toughening 
 of fish and shellfish in cold storage, the nature and control of drip in frozen fish, and 
 the nature of the chemical and physical changes which occur in dried or dehydrated fish 
 and in fish meal. This information might lead to methods of control of undesirable 
 changes and eventually to the improvement in the quality of fishery food products. The 
 phase of the project to be considered during this year will be the mechanism of drip for- 
 mation in fish and shellfish. A study of the drip formed on cooking will also be included. 
 The work will be carried out on a part-time basis by one technologist. (Seattle) 

3. Determination of Chemical Changes in Fish Protein during Freezing and Stor - 
 age (new project): When fish are frozen certain changes take place that may not be at- 
 tributable entirely to physical reactions. The study will attempt to reveal any chemical 
 change that takes place in the fish protein and to apply the results toward methods of 
 improving the quality of frozen fishery products. The study will require the full time 
 of one technologist. (Ketchikan) 

4. Comparison of Nutritive Value of Fish and Meat (continued project): The Uni- 
 versity of Maryland, College of Home Economics, in a cooperative project, compared 
 haddock fillets with sirloin of beef as the animal protein in test diets consumed by two 
 groups of girls. This study is expected to be continued with some additional stress on 
 the calorific values as measured by an improved laboratory procedure. One technolog- 
 ist supervises a graduate fellowship student conducting these studies. (College Park) 

5. Discoloration in Canned Tuna (cooperative project sponsored by the Continental 
 Can Company)â€” new project: Cans used for packing tuna require a special enameling 
 process to prevent inner-surface can discoloration. A study will be made of the mecha- 
 nism of th^'s discoloration reaction. Application of the information obtained may result 
 in less expensive preventive measures. The project will be carried out by one fellowship 
 student on a part-time basis. (Seattle) 

REFRIGERATION 

1. Freezing Fish at Sea , Defrosting , Filleting , and Refreezing the Fillets (con- 
 tinued project): The freezing- fish-at-sea project has as its objectives: (1) raising the 
 over -all quality level of frozen fillets to meet the competition of other animal pKoteinfoods 
 and of other countries marketing fish in this country; and (2) extending the effective 
 range of our vessels to more distant but less depleted fishing areas. Activities on the 
 project have included: (1) The modification of a standard New England trawler for com- 
 mercial-scale freezing experiments at sea. (2) The development, installation, andtest- 
 ing of round-fish freezing equipment and techniques adopted to existing vessels and crews. 
 (3) The development and testing of acceptable defrosting equipment and procedures.
