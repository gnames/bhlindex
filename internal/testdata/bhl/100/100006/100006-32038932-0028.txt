(4) The study of the cold-storage life of round fish frozen at sea prior to filleting, and 
 of refrozen fillets from these stored round frozen fish. (5) Laboratory and consumer 
 acceptance tests of fillets from fish frozen at sea compared to those from iced fish. 

Haddock was the principal species used in this development work. In this fiscal 
 year the economic aspects of freezing fish at sea will be evaluated as compared to the 
 current New England iced-vessel type of operation, again using haddock, Thereafter 
 similar tests are contemplated using the same or suitably modified techniques to obtain 
 information on other important New England species, such as cod, flounder, and ocean 
 perch. Personnel assigned to this project include the fishing vessel complement, one 
 full-time technologist, and the part-time services of two technologists, one chemist, 
 and one refrigeration engineer. (Boston) 

2. Quality Standards for Haddock Fillets (continued project): The quality stand- 
 ards for haddock fillets in use in the industry were developed largely for fillets from 
 fish preserved at sea in ice. Early in the study of fillets from round haddock frozen at 
 sea, variances not found in fillets from iced fish were observed. On this project infor- 
 mation will be obtained essential to the preparation of quality standards for haddock 
 fillets prepared from iced fish (sold either as fresh or frozen fillets) and from frozen 
 round fish (sold as frozen fillets). The availability of fish of known history for this 
 work from the Delaware makes this a logical study to supplement the freezing-fish-at 
 sea project. One technologist will work part time on this project. (Boston) 

3. Preparation of a Manual on the Refrigeration of Fish (continued project): An 
 advisory group of fishery technologists interested especially in iced and frozen fishery 
 products cooperated in the preparation of a subject outline for the refrigeration manual. 
 The object is to compile into one reference the current acceptable methods and equip- 
 ment for preparation, transport, storage, and distribution of refrigerated fishery prod- 
 ucts. Much of the source material was collected late last year. During this year the 
 writing and editing of the manual is expected to be completed. One technologist will be 
 working part-time on the project. (Washington) 

4. Cold - Storage Life of Fish (continued project): Studies have been completed or 
 are in progress on the storage life of rockfishes, salmon, halibut, and various species 
 of fresh- water fish under simulated commercial packaging and storage conditions. The 
 work will be expanded to include other species of marine and fresh- water fish. Those 
 fish showing limited cold-storage keeping quality will be further tested by improved han- 
 dling and packing methods. This information on the cold-storage life of various fish 
 provides a guide for packers and distributors in the handling and marketing of their fish- 
 ery products. It serves, also, as a basis for the requirements in the Federal Specifica- 
 tions which insures government procurement of good quality fishery products. Much of 
 the study will be concentrated on fresh- water species of fish. Because of the location of 
 the Service's technological laboratories along the seaboard, work onthe fresh- water fish 
 has been neglected. However, 150, 000, 000 pounds of such fresh-water fish taken com- 
 mercially each year make up a significant portion of the fisheries production. An under- 
 standing of the cold-storage characteristics of these and of the marine fish, and applica- 
 tion of the findings, would undoubtedly tend to improve market quality and permit wider 
 distribution. The study will be carried out on a part-time basis by one technologist. (Seattle) 

5. Study of Cause of Texture Change of Canned Salmon Prepared from Frozen 
 Fish (continued project): Freezing and storing salmon prior to canning causes undesir- 
 able quality changes in the final product. Among these changes are the toughening of the 
 meat and the development of curd. Previous studies have shown: (l)that the physical 
 alteration of the cell wallsof the meat of the salmon during freezing and storage is at least 
 partially responsible for the toughening; and (2) that the curd formation is probably related 
 to chemical changes in the protein. The current phase of the project will be devoted to 

a study of the mechanism of the effect of brine on the meat of the fish in reducing the re- 
 lease of soluble protein to form the curd. The- information will contribute materially to 
 a fuller understanding of the proper use of brine dips for the reduction of drip in frozen 
 fish. The work will be carried out by one technologist working full time. (Ketchikan)
