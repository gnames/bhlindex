ture. This situation poses serious economic problems for the local residents during 
 the balance of the year. One possible way to augment earnings and extend the period of 
 employment will be the establishment of industries morefully utilizing fishery resources 
 during the "off-season. " Studies will be continued to develop specialty food products 
 from fish and from edible parts of the fish trimmings. The work will be carried out 
 part-time by one technologist. (Ketchikan) 

ANALYSIS AND COMPOSITION 

1. Composition of Fish (continued project): There has been a growing demand by 
 physicians, dietitians, nutritionists, and others for information on the composition of 
 foods, including fishery products. Information is also needed by the fishery industry 
 regarding the chemical composition of various organs and tissues of fish with a viewto 
 the preparation of new products. Much of the work on proximate composition for this 
 year will be concentrated on the fresh-water fish for which there is little available in- 
 formation, and on the underutilized species of fish to promote their greater acceptance. 
 The work will be carried out as a part-time project by one technologist. (Seattle) 

2. Determination of Oil in Fish Meal (cooperative work with the Association of 
 Official Agricultural Chemists) --continued project: The present official method for 
 the determination of oil in fish meal is quite tedious and time consuming. A rapid but 
 accurate method is needed to provide the efficiency needed in transactions involving 
 the marketing of fish meals. Current studies involve adaptation of the Mojonnier-type 
 extraction tube using various chemicals to hydrolyze the meal. The work is being 
 carried out on a part-time basis by one technologist. (Seattle) 

BYPRODUCTS 

1 . Vitamin Content and Nutritive Value of Fishery Byproducts (continued project) : 
 a. BIOLOGICAL STUDIES: Chick assays for vitamin B\ 2 content of fish meals and fish 
 solubles were conducted in 1953. Tests on the feasibility of adding fish oils to commer- 
 cial poultry feeds, also begun last year, will be continued to determine conservative 
 levels which may be fed without affecting the flavor of the meat or eggs. Studies begun 
 late last year to determine the nutritive value of fish meal and fish solubles gave widely 
 variable results not correlated with known differences in raw materials of processing 
 methods used. More extensive feeding tests will be carried out this year on these fish- 
 ery products in an effort to account for the wide differences in nutritive values observed. 
 One technologist works part-time on this project. (College Park) 

b. CHEMICAL AND MICROBIOLOGICAL STUDIES: Lack of information on the 
 nutrient content of fishery byproducts is a serious handicap to the fishery byproducts 
 and feed industries in the marketing and utilizations of these products. Analysis of 
 meals and scrap for the various B vitamins will continue and the study will be broadened 
 to include additional samples from the East Coast, such as solubles and crab meal. 
 Further work on the isolation and identification of unknown growth factors will also be 
 pursued. Two technologists will be assigned to work full time on these studies. (Seattle) 

2. Utilization of Viscera from Round ( Whole ) Fish (new project): The freezing of 
 round fish at sea wiU make available larger amounts of viscera at shore processing 
 plants. Studies are planned to determine the uses for which the various components are 
 suited, both to increase the revenue from fisheries activities and to utilize more effec- 
 tively the viscera now discarded at sea. One chemist will work full time on the project 
 as soon as a qualified man can be employed. (Boston) 

3 . Study of Pharmaceutical and Other Industrial Products from Salmon Eggs (con- 
 tinued project): Millions of pounds of salmon eggs are discarded every year at salmon 
 canneries in Alaska for want of a suitable and profitable outlet. On the basis of pre- 
 liminary work, salmon eggs may be a good potential source of pharmaceutical and other 
 industrial products. During the current year the oil fraction of the eggs will be consid- 
 ered since it is a source for the long chain fatty acids that may be modified for special- 
 ized industrial applications. The study requires the full time of one technologist.
