4. The Development of a Dried Product from Condensed Menhaden Soluble s or 
 Stickwater (continued project): Stickwater samples, collected from practically all the 
 plants in production, were dried, chemical analyses completed, and hygroscopicity 
 studies begun on the dried product during the past year. This year studie s will be made 
 to determined) what constituent or factor in the raw material causes the undesirable 
 hygroscopicity; (2) what changes in methods of manufacture, as the use of additives, can 
 be devised to yield a less hygroscopic dry product; (3) what packaging materials are 
 most satisfactory for the dry product. One technologist is working full time on this project.

5. Chemical Evaluation of Fish Oils and Inve stigation of New Uses (new project): 
 The current domestic surplus of fats and oils makes imperative the need for the devel- 
 opment of new uses for fish oils to broaden the market and increase their value. The 
 initial phase of the project will involve a study of the chemical composition of fish oil, 
 particularly menhaden. This basic information will be used to determine current and 
 new uses for which the various components are best suited. The work will be carried 
 out by one technologist. (Seattle)
