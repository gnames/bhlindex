NOTE: VESSELS HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED TO THE VARIOUf SECTIONS ON THE BASIS OF THEIR HOME PORT. 

In July 1953, 72 vessels of 5 net tons and over received their first documents as 
 fishing craft--17 more than in July 1952. Florida led with 18 vessels, followed by 
 Washington with 12, and Texas and California with 9 vessels each. 

Cans- -Shipments for Fishery Products, January- July 1953 

Total shipments of metal cans for fish and sea food during January- 
 July 195 3 amounted to 61, 818 short tons of steel (based on the amount 
 of steel consumed in the manufacture of cans). Comparative data for 
 1952 is not available, but it is believed that this year's shipments are 
 larger principally because of the larger tuna pack reported by West 
 Coast fish canneries. 

NOTE: STATISTICS COVER ALL COMMERCIAL AND CAPTIVE PLANTS KNOWN TO BE PRODUCING METAL CANS. REPORTED 
 IN' BASE BOXES OF STEEL CONSUMED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF CANS, THE DATA FOR FISHERY PRODUCTS ARE CON- 
 VERTED TO TONS OF STEEL BY USING THE FACTOR: 23.0 BASE BOXES OF STEEL EQUAL ONE SHORT TON OF STEEL.
