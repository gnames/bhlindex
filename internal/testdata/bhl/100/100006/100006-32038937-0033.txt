NO SARDINES OFF COAST : The California Fish and Game Commission has offi- 
 cially acknowledged that there are virtually no sardines (pilchards) off California's 
 coast, reports a September 2 release from the California Department of Fish and 
 Game. The acknowledgement came at the Commission's August 28 meeting. The 
 Commission at this meeting refused to renew any sardine reduction permits. This 
 was merely acceptance of the fact that California's sardine catch, which once reached 
 over a half-million tons a year, has dwindled to practically nothing. 

The Commission has regulatory power over the reduction plants only; it has had 
 no control over the canneries, which take by far the greatest number of the once plen- 
 tiful California sardines. 

The sardine catch for the 1950/51 season, the last good year, was 355,000 tons, 
 of which only 36, 000 tons were used for reduction. In 1951/52 the catch fell to 136, 000 
 tons, and only 1, 000 tons of this was taken for reduction. In the 1952/53 season, a mere 
 3,600 tons were taken- -hardly a single night's haul in the days when California sardines 
 were plentiful, it was pointed out. Only 11 tons of these were used by the reduction 
 plants. 

OCEANOGRAPH1C DATA AS RELATED TO PACIFIC SARDINE COLLECTED BY 
 ' YELLOWFIN " ( Cruise 53-Y-6): Data for determining the oceanographic factors respon- 
 sible for the behavior, spawning success, and survival of Pacific sardine (pilchard) 
 were collected by the California Department of Fish and Game's research vessel Yel - 
 lowfin on an 11-day cruise completed at Los Angeles on June 14. This was a routine 
 hydrographic cruise of the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations to 
 the coastal and offshore area from San Diego to Pt. Conception and around the Channel 
 Islands, reports a July 13 release from the Department. 

The following data were collected on the cruise: 35 hydrographic stations com- 
 pleted; 3 between- station plankton tows taken; hourly BT's (bathythermographs) lowered 
 between offshore stations and half-hourly on the inshore stations; continuous subsurface 
 and surface ocean temperatures recorded; 79 "jog-log" observations (GEK or Geomag- 
 netic Electro Kinetograph) made; fish sampled on one night station; and fish, mammal, 
 and bird observations logged. 

No fish schools were seen except sauries. Weather conditions were not severe 
 enough to hamper oceanographical work, but did limit fish sampling to the first night 
 station.

TUNA TAGGED OFF BAJA CALIFORNIA BY M/V " VIRGINIA R." ( Cruise No. 
 C-2-53): A total of 799 yellowfin and skipjack tuna were tagged by the commercial 
 vessel M/V Virginia R. on a 53-day cruise. off the west coast of Baja California, com- 
 pleted at San Diego on July 31. The vessel was chartered by the State of California De- 
 partment of Fish and Game to continue the experimental tagging of yellowfin and skip- 
 jack tuna with tag types "F" and "G," reports an August 28 release from that agency. 

Almost all of the schools encountered on the cruise consisted of skipjack tuna, with 
 a few small one-pole yellowfin mixed in. In all there were 581 skipjack and 218 yellow- 
 fin tagged. Fishing was generally slow, but the vessel was able to maintain a good 
 average from day to day. The tagged fish were taken from about 80 different schools 
 of yellowfin and skipjack. 

During the first three days of the trip the fish for tagging were caught and passed 
 by a crew member of the vessel fishing in the corner rack on the port side. This proved 
 to be inadquate since by the time the skipjack were picked up from the deck and placed in
