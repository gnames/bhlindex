the tagging cradle most of them had vibrated themselves into such a frenzy that it was 
 practically impossible to tag the fish and release them in good condition. It was de- 
 cided to catch the fish on the starboard side. This proved to work reasonably well. 
 The fish could be dropped in or near the cradle as they were brought aboard. Gener- 
 ally, even the skipjack had a brief period of quiescence and if the tag was inserted 
 within 15 to 20 seconds, the fish could be released in good shape. There were some 
 that vibrated immediately and could not be tagged. Practically all of the fish released 
 after the first 3 days of tagging were in excellent condition. 

By the end of August, 6 tagged skipjack and 1 tagged yellowfin were recovered; all 
 from local fishing grounds.

TgNA TAGGED BY M/V " DEFIANCE " ( Cruise C-3-53): A total of 998 tuna (934 
 yellowfin and 64 skipjack) were tagged by the commercial fishing vessel Defiance on a 

63-day cruise completed at San Pedro on Au- 
 gust 8. The vessel was chartered by the Cali- 
 fornia Department of Fish and Game to continue 
 experimental tuna tagging off the west coast of 
 Baja California, Roca Partida, and Clarian 
 Island, an August 28 release from that Agency 
 states. The cruise was also for the purpose of 
 gaining experience in commercial fishing meth- 
 ods and making incidental collections of post- 
 larval fish with a night light. 

Three different types of tags were used: 
 type "E" (198 tags), 'V' (412 tags), and "G" 
 (388 tags). Eight night-light stations were 
 occupied, but the material is yet to be identi- 
 fied. 

Two tags had been recovered by the end of 
 August: 

One type "G" on a yellowfin tuna caught by 
 a purse seiner on the same day and in the same 
 area as it was released. The other type "E" 
 on yellowfin tuna also caught by a purse seiner 
 after being at liberty for 44 days in which time 
 it grew 19 mm. (f inch). This fish was tagged 
 and released off the east end of Clarion Island 
 and recaptured 38 miles SE. of Cape Tosco, 
 Baja California, a general movement to the N. 
 x NE. of 375 miles.
