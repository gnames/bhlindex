(3) Closed the Salton Sea to the taking of shellfish to permit establishment of a 
 sports fishery there. 

(4) Fifty-four shrimp fishermen were granted an extension of their permits to 
 allow them to continue fishing through September 30 (the end of the regular season) on 
 the shrimp and prawn beds recently discovered by Department of Fish and Game re- 
 search teams. This action takes care of a technicality in the law.

The over -all average price paid for fresh and frozen fishery products by the De- 
 partment of the Army continued to be much lower than last year. In July the average 
 price was 34. cents per pound, compared with 36. 5 cents in June and 48. 1 cents in 
 July 1952. 

In addition to the purchases of fresh and frozen fishery products indicated above, 
 the Armed Forces generally make some local purchases which are not included in the 
 above figures. Therefore, actual purchases are somewhat higher than indicated, but 
 it is not possible to obtain data on the local purchases made by military instaUations 
 throughout the country.

ANOTHER " RED TIDE :" Another "red tide," beginning off St. Petersburg, Florida, 
 on September 3, killed a large quantity of fish in an area 5 to 20 miles from shore ex- 
 tending in patches along 60 miles of the coast from Clearwater to Venice, reports the 
 Service's Branch of Fishery Biology. On September 15 dead fish had washed ashore at 
 several points and local citizens were engaged in removing them from the beaches. Fish 
 were dying over a wide area and no indications of a change of conditions to stop the "red 
 tide" were evident.
