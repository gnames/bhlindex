34 COMMERCIAL FISHERIES REVIEW Vol. 15, No. 10 

A tremendous bloom of the micro-organism Gymnodinium brevis causes "red 
 tides." Metabolism products of this organism are apparently toxic to fish and other 
 marine organisms. When the G. brevis concentration reaches a certain point, fish 
 and other marine organisms die. This results in considerable fish loss and contami- 
 nation if they are washed ashore. 

Cultures of the organism are being observed alive at the Service's Galveston, 
 Texas, laboratory. The Service has been conducting research on "red tide" causes 
 since the large bloom and resultant fish kill of 1947. Water samples from the area 
 most recently infected contained as high as 2, 000 organisms per milliliter of water. 
 It is believed heavy river run-off combined with quiet wind conditions produces en- 
 riched water and conditions conducive to rapid growth of the organism. A theory has 
 been developed for possible control measures by detecting and poisoning small patches 
 of the organism. 

While processing data collected during the November 1952 outbreak of "red tide" 
 off the coast of Florida, the Service's Gulf Fishery Investigations found good evidence 
 that effluents of the Caloosahatchee River are important agents in such blooms. It has 
 been noted that activity of this type is probably due to organic content as well as to 
 physical attributes. Experimental work in tanks has indicated that high light intensity, 
 vitamin B12, and sulfides are some of the requirements for mass growth of dinofla- 
 gellates as well as other organisms. 

Chemical analyses that have been made by the Geochemistry and Petrology Branch, 
 U. S. Geological Survey, show that significant quantities of titanium and zirconium were 
 present in the "red tide" bloom water--and not in other waters such as Lake Okeecho- 
 bee, the surface of Sigsbee Deep, and the tidal lagoon at Galveston. 

Indonesians to Study Modern Fishery 
 Development Management in United States 

Five fishery technicians have arrived in the United States from Djakarta, Indonesia, 
 on Foreign Operations Administration grants for a year's in-service training and ad- 
 vanced instruction under guidance of the Fish and Wildlife Service, Secretary of the In- 
 terior Douglas McKay announced September 1. 

They are the first of a group of 11 Indonesians who will be trained in the United 
 States in various aspects of modern fishery development during 1953/54. 

Three of the trainees will receive instructions in Diesel engineering and refriger- 
 ation at the San Diego Vocational School. The other two will take in-service training 
 in fishery statistics in Washington, D. C, and Gloucester, Mass., and will study sta- 
 tistical theory and practice at the University of North Carolina's agricultural school, 
 for the purpose of improving Indonesia's methods of compiling fishery statistics. 

Lease Bid Received for American Samoa Fish Cannery 

The one lease bid submitted for the fish cannery in American Samoa was opened on 
 September 14 by the Pacific Division of the Office of Territories, U. S. Department of 
 the Interior. The Government of Samoa had requested offers for lease of the fully e- 
 quipped cannery on that Island. 

As required by the invitation, the bid was for an initial five-year lease. The sole 
 bidder offered to lease the cannery for $5, 000 each year, or $2. 50 per short ton offish 
 processed, frozen, canned, or stored for eventual shipment, whichever is greater.
