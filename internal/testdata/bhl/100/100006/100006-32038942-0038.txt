DEAD HERRING OFF COAST : Millions of dead herring, totaling about 300, 000 
 pounds, were found in Love's Cove, Maine, on July 18 and 19 and on July 31-August2, 
 reports the Service's Branch of Fishery Biology. Whiting, harbor pollock, tomcod, 
 and small flounders were dead also. At both kills, 20 to 30 seals were on a ledge at 
 the Cove mouth. Green crabs taken from traps were either dead or lethargic, a con- 
 dition which indicated oxygen depletion near the bottom. 

Disease did not seem to have caused the mortalities. A large school of immature 
 herring (britts), possibly pursued by whiting, pollock, tomcod, and seals, probably 
 entered the Cove on July 18 and 19 on an ebbing tide. Because oxygen was depleted at 
 low tide, most of the fish died. Occurrence of a second kill two weeks later, when the 
 tidal cycle was the same, substantiates this theory. 

New England Tuna Explorations 

POOR TUNA FISHING REPORTED BY " MARJORIE PARKER " ( Cruise No. 2): 
 Only 600 pounds of bluefin tuna were caught in the Gulf of Maine by the Service -chart- 
 ered exploratory fishing vessel Marjorie Parker on a 25 -day cruise. This cruise, the 
 second of the season, was completed on August 25 at Portland, Maine. Adverse weath- 
 er was encountered on part of the trip. 

During the first stages of the trip the vessel operated in the northeastern sector 
 of the Gulf of Maine, working 15 long-line stations at distances from 50 to 150 miles 
 offshore, covering Cashes Ledge, Fippennies Ledge, and the northern edge of Georges 
 Bank. From August 18 to August 25 explorations were carried on in the South Channel, 
 Southwest Georges Bank, and Pollock Rip Lightship areas at distances of 120 to 180 
 miles from Portland, Maine. 

Floating long lines, surface troll lines, and drift trammel nets were fished, but 
 long lines were principally used. Fishing results were poor. Blue sharks were abun- 
 dant, fouling long lines and impeding fishing operations. A total of 210 sharks was 
 captured on the long -line gear. 

Surface troll lines caught four tuna with an average weight of 45 pounds. Only one 
 school of tuna was observed during the trip and a set of 20 baskets (460 hooks) made 
 near the school was unsuccessful. Trammel net fishing at night also failed to produce 
 tuna. A total of 250 baskets (5, 000 hooks) was fished, with an average rate of 20 bas- 
 kets (400 hooks) per station. 

The Marjorie Parker was scheduled to depart Portland, Maine, August 28 on 
 Cruise No. 3, and return on or about September 10. Using long lines, surface troll 
 lines, and drift trammel nets, the vessel was to fish in the offshore waters, southeast 
 of Georges Bank in the area between 65 o 40'-66 o 20' W. longitude and 40°50'-43°00' N. 
 latitude .

HUDSON RIVER SHAD CATCH DECLINED IN 1953 : The 1953 Hudson River shad 
 catch in New York waters amounted to 456, 858 pounds, 17. 5 percent less than the 
 553, 262 pounds caught in 1952, according to preliminary figures supplied by the Serv- 
 ice's Fishery Marketing Specialist in that area. Fishing was conducted under special 
 shad gill-net permits issued by the State of New York.
