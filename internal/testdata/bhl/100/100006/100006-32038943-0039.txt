The breakdown of the 195 3 catch is as follows: 

Stake nets (90 licenses): roe shad 91, 318 
 pounds (22,629 fish); buck shad 50,284 pounds 
 (17, 929 fish). Total value to the fishermen: 
 approximately $26, 000. 

Drift gill nets (109 licenses): roe shad 
 171,636 pounds (42,019 fish); buck shad 143,620 
 pounds (59, 540 fish). Total value to the fish- 
 ermen: approximately $35, 000. 

The appearance of a large quantity of menhaden in the Raritan Bay area was be- 
 lieved responsible for the poor catch of shad in that area. The 1953 catch in the Rari- 
 tan Bay area was considerably under that of a year ago.

The effect of the trawl cod-end cover upon the

 by the Albatross HI , the Serv- 
 ice 1 s research vessel operating 
 in the Northwest Atlantic, on 
 Cruise No. 52. The vessel, 
 which sailed from Woods Hole,
