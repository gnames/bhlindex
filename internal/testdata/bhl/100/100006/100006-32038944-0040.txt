pies in each area photographed. The pictures obtained were clear and sharp with many 
 bottom organisms visible. A line trawl was set 5 times and the one-meter plankton 

net was towed once. 

Ocean perch were collected in depths 
 ranging from 35 to approximately 240 
 fathoms. The smallest ocean perch (30 
 mm.) yet taken was fished from shoal 
 water. Some previous unfished stocks of 
 ocean perch were sampled in deep water; 
 specimens up to 47 cm. in length were 
 caught. 

(ATLANTIC) OCEAN PERCH 
 (SEBASTES MARINUS) 

Numerous notes were made of the 
 W stomach contents of cod, haddock, whit- 

ing, white hake, and ocean perch. An experimental vertical line trawl was fished sev- 
 eral times at night- -whiting and hake were caught, but no ocean perch. 

Efforts to tag ocean perch proved fruitless. Even the ocean perch brought to the 
 surface from shallow depths of 35-40 fathoms were badly blown and unable to return to 
 the bottom.

ZERO - AGE HADDOCK DISTRIBUTION STUDIED BY " ALBATROSS in" ( Cruise 
 No . 54): A 13-day cruise to collect data to determine the distribution and numbers of 
 zero-age haddock in connection with early life history and year-class strength studies 
 was completed by the Service's research vessel Albatross III at Woods Hole, Mass., 
 on September 14. The area covered was Georges Bank and the Gulf of Maine. 

Zero-age haddock were found in a very limited area (South Channel and the Gulf of 
 Maine) while yearling fish of other species were more widely dispersed. No young 
 haddock were found off the bottom. 

Sixty-seven 20-minute tows with a No. 36 trawl were made throughout the area. 
 One -hundred bathythermograph lowerings were made. In addition, at selected stations 
 horizontal tows with a 1-meter ring net attached to the towing warp were made. 

Further analysis of the distribution of zero-age haddock will have to await the com- 
 pletion of a similar sampling of the Southern New England Banks.

SALMON RESOURCES ADJACENT TO ALEUTIAN ISLANDS INVESTIGATED BY 
 " JOHN N. COBB " ( Cruise No . 16): An investigation of the salmon resources in the off- 
 shore waters adjacent to the Aleutian Islands, Alaska, was conducted by the John N . 
 Cobb on an extended cruise which was completed on August 8. The vessel, one of the 
 Service's exploratory fishing vessels, sailed from Seattle on May 18. 

The investigation was part of the preliminary salmon research by the Service in 
 connection with the International Convention for the High Seas Fisheries of the North 
 Pacific Ocean. Objectives were to gain as much knowledge as possible concerning salm- 
 on in offshore waters, and to test and evaluate the effectiveness of various types of fish- 
 ing gear for catching salmon on the high seas. Since it was necessary to obtain samples 
 of salmon from as large an area as possible, the John N. Cobb changed fishing locations 
 frequently. 

Gill nets, trolling gear, floating long lines, and a trap were fished, but only the gill 
 nets proved successful as a means of catching salmon. The gill nets used were 100
