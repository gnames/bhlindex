fathoms to a shackle, 75 meshes deep, and made of 5^-inch (stretched mesh) linen net- 
 ting. As a rule, either 5 or 10 shackles were fastened together and set as a string. 

Fishing operations commenced on June 9 and ended on July 28. From June 9 to 
 July 17 the vessel operated in the Pacific Ocean from Unalaska Island to near Agattu 
 Island at distances from 15 to 60 miles offshore. From July 17 to July 28 operations 
 were carried on in the Bering Sea from Umnak Island to Kiska Island at distances from 
 5 to 45 .niles offshore. During the trip approximately 1, 200 salmon were taken and 
 frozen for additional study in the Service's Seattle laboratory. 

Catches of salmon varied considerably in individual gill-net sets, ranging from 
 to 18 per 100-fathom shackle in Pacific Ocean sets, and from 1 to 28 in Bering Sea 
 sets. Salmon catches consisted of 32 percent red, 3 percent silver, 26 percent pink, 
 and 39 percent chum salmon in the Pacific Ocean fishing; and 2 percent red, 1 percent 
 silver, 3 percent pink, and 94 percent chum in the Bering Sea fishing. 

Weights, measurements, and other information concerning the salmon caught will 
 be determined from the samples brought to Seattle. 

This exploration was carried out as a joint operation by the Service's Branch of 
 Commercial Fisheries and the Branch of Fishery Biology. A biologist from the Fish- 
 eries Research Institute at the University of Washington also accompanied the vessel. 

Ohio's Lake Erie Commercial Fisheries Production, 1952 

The total catch of fresh-water fish by Ohio's commercial fisheries of Lake Erie 
 amounted to 21,246,640 pounds in 1952, a 14 percent increase over the 18,700, 118 
 pounds landed in 1951, reports a recent bulletin from the Ohio Department of Natural 
 Resources (see table). This increase was due mainly to the large rise in blue pike 
 landings and lesser increases in landings of carp and catfish.

In 1952 blue pike was the leading species landed by Ohio's Lake Erie commercial 
 fisheries and comprised 26 percent of the total; followed by yellow pickerel, 22 percent; 
 sheepshead, 17 percent; carp, 10 percent; yellow perch, 7 percent; and catfish, 7 per- 
 cent. The leading item in 1951 was yellow pickerel, 29 percent; followed by sheepshead, 
 19 percent; and yellow perch, 13 percent.
