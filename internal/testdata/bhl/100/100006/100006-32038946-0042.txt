UNEXPLOITED TUNA RESOURCE CLOSE TO HAWAII FOUND BY " JOHN R. 
 MANNING " ( Cruise No . 16)1 Evidence of an unexploited and potentially valuable com- 
 mercial tuna resource close to the Hawaiian Islands was gathered by the research ves- 
 sel John R. Manning on a 6-week cruise completed at Kauai on August 31. The vessel, 
 operated by the Service's Pacific Oceanic Fishery Investigations (POFI), caught over 
 200 yellowfin tuna (about 10, 000 pounds) by a small amount of experimental long-line 
 fishing gear in only 5 days of fishing. The vessel operated along the 155th and 160th 
 meridians in the equatorial region south of Hawaii. Remarkably good fishing for yel- 
 lowfin tuna was found between 2 and 4 degrees north of the equator on 155° W. longi- 
 tude, and in the vicinity of Christmas Island. A number of albacore were also taken 
 and this species would undoubtedly be a profitable secondary product of a yellowfin fish- 
 ery in those waters. 

Several promising innovations in tuna long-line gear were tested during the cruise 
 with the object of developing a type of line more efficient than that now used by Hawaiian 
 and Japanese fishermen. These experiments included the substitution of hemp for the 
 usual more expensive cotton line, variations in the spacing of the hooks along the main 
 line, and a new method of attaching the branch lines to the main line designed to reduce 
 tangling. It was found that tangling, ordinarily a time-consuming and troublesome 
 feature of long-line fishing, can be virtually eliminated, and it is thought that the new 
 method will enable fishermen to operate more gear and catch more tuna. The results 
 of the hook-spacing experiments indicate that the most efficient arrangement is approx- 
 imately 10 hooks to each 1, 000 feet of main line. 

Twelve stations were fished on 155° between 10° N. and 4° S. latitude. In addi- 
 tion, 3 stations were fished between 155° and the vicinity of Christmas Island. At each 
 of these stations 50 to 60 baskets of long-line gear were fished, of which 30 had 6 hooks 
 per basket of gear; and varying numbers (usually 20 and 10) of the baskets had 11 and 
 21 hooks, respectively. The best fishing occurred between 2° and 4° N. latitude inthe 
 oceanic areas, and in the vicinity of Christmas Island. The 5 consecutive stations 
 within these limits yielded the following catches of yellowfin: six-hook baskets 11 per 
 hundred hooks, 0. 6 fish per basket; 11-hook gear, 9 per hundred hooks, 0. 7 per bas- 
 ket; 21-hook baskets, 9 per hundred hooks, 1. 8 per basket. The catches of the 21-hook 
 gear are, however, not comparable to the catches on the other gear as the experiment- 
 al design of this preliminary trial does not permit direct comparison. These catches 
 indicate a very marked concentration of yellowfin tuna, a concentration that should 
 support a United States fishery. 

Fishing was not spectacular along 160° between 3° S. and 9° N. latitude. As on 
 155°, the best fishing occurred in the south equatorial current north of the Equator. 

The catches of the 3 types of gear mentioned indicate that the 11-hook baskets are 
 more efficient than the 6 -hook baskets. Because of the increased hauling time of the 
 21-hook gear, this type does not appear suitable for commercial use. A swiveling ar- 
 rangement that virtually eliminates time and energy-consuming tangles was given a 
 thorough test on this cruise. Its eminent success indicates an improvement that should 
 permit a crew to fish more gear per day, improving the prospects for United States ex- 
 ploitation of the resource. 

Three baskets of gear made of factory-tarred Italian hemp line were fished each 
 day. Towards the end of the cruise this gear became too slick to be pulled with the 
 Japanese line hauler, indicating it is not a suitable material for this type of line fishing. 

Scientific findings of the expedition included the capture of a variety of mackerel 
 shark hitherto known only from the Atlantic, and the discovery of evidence that yellowfin 
 tuna were actively spawning in the area where the best fishing was found. The scien- 
 tists collected samples of scales and vertebrae from over 400 tuna, and will attempt to 
 read the annual rings in these specimens in order to gain information on the age and 
 growth rate of the fish.
