October 195 3 COMMERCIAL FISHERIES REVIEW 41 

Several days were spent at Christmas Island exploring possible sites for the in- 
 stallation of devices to automatically record seasonal changes in the temperature of 
 the ocean around the island, which lies in the heart of the rich equatorial fishing 
 grounds. The results of this reconnaissance will be used in planning the possible fu- 
 ture establishment of a small field station on Christmas Island. 

The seven tons of yellowfin and albacore landed by the John R. Manning were de- 
 livered to a Kauai cannery for processing. POFI scientists will keep a constant check 
 on these fish as they pass through the cannery in order to evaluate their quality in 
 comparison with tuna from Hawaii and West Coast fishing grounds.

" CHARLES H. GILBERT " SCOUTS FOR TUNA IN HAWAIIAN WATERS ( Cruise 
 11 ): Quantitative scouting for surface schools of skipjack and other tuna in Hawaiian 
 waters was carried out by the Charles H. Gilbert, a research vessel of the Service's 
 Pacific Oceanic Fishery Investigations (POFI) on a 34-day cruise completed at Hono- 
 lulu on April 30. The vessel also executed weekly hydrographic sections on a line run- 
 ning north and south between Oahu and Molokai. 

A systematic scouting for surface schools of skipjack and other tunas was carried 
 out in Area I north of Oahu and in Area II south of Oahu. A total of 47 bird flocks were 
 sighted in Area I, a scouting distance of 360 miles, while in Area II 58 flocks were seen 
 in 720 miles of scouting. Several of the schools attended by bird flocks were investi- 
 gated by means of actual live -bait fishing and surface trolling in order to determine the 
 kind of fish schools, the sizes of fish in the schools, and the approximate size of the 
 schools. A few good traces of fish schools were obtained on a depth recorder. 

SKIPJACK TUNA CONCENTRATIONS DISCOVERED OFF HAWAIIAN ISLANDS BY 
 " CHARLES H. GILBERT " ( Cruise 13 ): Many large schools of skipjack or striped tuna 
 (aku) were observed concentrated in areas both to the north and south of the Hawaiian 
 Islands by the Charles H. Gilbert on a 38-day cruise completed at Honolulu July 12. 
 Following a regular search pattern 
 designed to furnish data for estimat- 
 ing the quantities of tuna present in 
 the vicinity of the islands, the ves- 
 sel encountered more skipjack 
 schools per unit of area north of the 
 Islands than immediately to the south , 
 of them, with an especially heavy 
 concentration of fish extending east 
 and west of a point some 50 miles 

northeast of Oahu. Farther to the skipjack tuna 

south, however, two other widely 
 separated areas of tuna abundance were found at 100 and 200 miles south of Honolulu. 
 AU of these concentrations were outside the area regularly fished by the local sampan 
 fleet. 

In contrast, very little activity was noticed in inshore areas to the south of the is- 
 lands, with a notable scarcity of fish schools south of Molokai and Lanai. Generally, 
 the greater numbers of schools were sighted on the scouting runs made in the east to 
 west direction, with lesser numbers on the west to east runs, the latter being caused 
 by less favorable scouting conditions when running upwind or possibly because *of the 
 easterly movement of the tuna schools. The north- south runs showed no significant 
 differences in the number of sightings with the direction of the vessel. 

A part of this cruise was devoted to the testing of chemical and visual attractants 
 at sea, using various combinations of tuna extract and artificial bait on skipjack schools. 
 The tuna extract alone failed to obtain any noticeable response from the skipjack, which 
 appeared to be neither attracted nor repelled by it. Artificial bait of various kinds such
