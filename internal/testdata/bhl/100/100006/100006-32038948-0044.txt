as cellophane strips, tin-foil squares, aluminum -foil strips, and tin strips were tried 
 as possible visual attractants of skipjack. These materials were chummed alone or 
 together with extract. Shiny materials, such as tin-foil squares and tin strips attract- 
 ed the fish momentarily, in some cases even getting the fish away from feeding on the 
 remaining live bait (chumming with live bait was stopped just before chumming with 
 artificial bait). The momentary response was probably caused by the resemblance of 
 the glittering material to live bait, but the fish were seen to turn away from the mate- 
 rial after approaching it once. Stomachs were examined of the fish which were caught 
 from the school on which tin strips were tested, and in 2 out of 17 stomachs, 1 strip 
 apiece was found. 

Chumming of dead bait (nehu) from the forward well deck occasionally brought re- 
 sponse from the fish, which followed the bait as it sank. The skipjack soon returned 
 to the surface when live -bait was chummed. 

No noticeable response was obtained with calcium carbide pellets, which effer- 
 vesced as they slowly sank. In all cases the fish soon departed from the vessel andhad 
 to be rechummed with live bait before further tests could be carried out on them. 

Three weekly hydrographic sections were executed in Kaiwi Channel as a continua- 
 tion of the survey started during Cruise 11 of the Charles H. Gilbert and carried through 
 during Cruise 12. 

Completion of this cruise marks the end of the third month of weekly scouting trips 
 in a research program planned by the Service's Pacific Oceanic Fishery Investigations 
 and the Territory Division of Fish and Game to supply information for the ultimate ex- 
 pansion of the local tuna fishery. The program will be continued by the Hugh M. Smith . 
 The cruises of the Charles H. Gilbert have involved, in addition to fish scouting, week- 
 ly investigations of the physical and chemical changes in the sea water which might be 
 related to tuna abundance.

" CHARLES H. GILBERT " SCOUTS FOR TUNA BETWEEN HAWAII AND WEST 
 COAST ( Cruise 14) : In conjunction with returning the Charles H. Gilbert to the main- 
 land for alterations, observations were made of surface fish schools between Hawaii and 
 the West Coast. Trolling gear was used daily and water temperature data were collected 
 with a bathythermograph and continuous recording thermometer. The vessel departed 
 from Honolulu on July 16, and arrived at San Francisco on July 26. 

Very few scattered birds were seen in the offshore area (50 miles from land) be- 
 tween Honolulu and San Francisco. These were mainly black-footed albatrosses, noted 
 followers of ships. During the five hours of daylight after leaving Honolulu, only three 
 bird flocks (all with tuna schools) were observed. 

No tuna were caught during the ten days of trolling. Three mahimahi (C. hippurus) 
 were caught, the last at 32° N. latitude on 135° W. longitude. The small catch may be 
 partially attributed to the speed of the vessel (average for trip 9 knots) which was con- 
 siderably above the optimum trolling speed of 6 to 6 ^ knots. 

The continuous recording thermograph indicated the passing of about 4 to 6 "fronts." 
 Two, and possibly three, were located in the area between 25°30' N. to 26°30' N. lati- 
 tude on 147° W. to 145° W. longitude. 

GeneraUy the cruise was handicapped by moderately rough seas and complete over- 
 cast on 7 of the 9\ days, limiting the range of visibility. 

The Charles H. Gilbert will be at a California shipyard for the balance of 1953.
