conditions governing the Hawaiian skipjack tuna fishery, was completed on August 26 
 by the Service's research vessel Hugh M. Smith . Oceanographic and biological in- 
 vestigations were carried on in an area of 86, 000 square miles surrounding the Ha- 
 waiian Islands; data were collected which will help to determine seasonal changes in 
 local waters and aid in explaining fluctuations in the local skipjack catch. 

Surface trolling and the direct observation of fish schools were also carried out, 
 and in a further effort to aid the skipjack (aku) fishing fleet, reports of fish sightings 
 were broadcast twice daily by short-wave radio. 

The goal of this POFI program is to obtain sufficient understanding of the habits 
 of the skipjack tuna and the oceanographic conditions influencing their distribution to 
 permit expansion of the present localized and highly seasonal fishery.

States Get Over $4 Million Federal Aid for Fish Restoration 

An upsurge in the purchase of sport fishing equipment during fiscal year 195 3 
 (ending June 30), attributed in part to the growing popularity of spinning tackle, has 
 made the sum of $4, 299, 916 in Federal Aid funds available for apportionment to the 48 
 states for sport fishery restoration projects during fiscal year 1954, the Secretary of 
 the Interior announced recently. This is an increase of $1, 791, 389 over last year's 
 apportionment of $2, 508, 527. 

These Federal funds become available to the states under the terms of the Federal 
 Aid in Fish Restoration Act of August 9, 1950, better known as the "Dingell-Johnson 
 Act. " This program, now in its third year of operation, is enabling the states to create 
 new public fishing lakes, restore many unproductive waters, and put research findings 
 to better use. 

The revenue for the program comes from the 10 percent excise tax on fishing rods, 
 creels, reels, and artificial lures, baits, and flies, paid by the manufacturers of those 
 products. Collections from this source during the year ended June 30, 1953, totaled 
 $4, 556, 615. From this total is taken the annual apportionments of $75, 000 to Alaska, 
 $25, 000 to Hawaii, and $10, 000 each to the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, and the cost 
 of administering the act by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 

To provide a fair distribution of Federal funds, each state's share is based on the 
 relation of the number of its fishing license holders to the total in all States, and the 
 ratio of each state's area (including coastal and Great Lakes waters) to the area of the 
 entire country. The Act also states "that no State can receive less than one percent nor 
 more than five percent of the total apportioned to all States." This provision allows the 
 small States enough working capital to finance comparatively big projects, while the 
 large States will be able to receive only the maximum amount. On this basis California, 
 Michigan, and Minnesota are given the maximum apportionment of $214, 996 each, while 
 Connecticut, Delaware, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New 
 Jersey, Rhode Island, and Vermont will receive the minimum of $42, 999. 

To obtain the benefits of the Federal grants, the states submit project proposals to 
 the Fish and Wildlife Service. Acting for the Secretary of the Interior, the Service re- 
 views these proposals to learn whether they are substantial in character and design, 
 within the meaning of the Act. When a project is approved, the State game and fish de- 
 partments proceed to carry out the plans, spending their own funds. The states then 
 submit reimbursement claims for 75 percent of the costs of the project, either period- 
 ically or at the completion of the work. The remaining 25 percent of project expendi- 
 tures is financed out of regular state funds. All equipment, lands, and structures be- 
 come the property of the states. All project workers are hired by the states and are 
 state employees. 

Apportionments to the 48 states for fiscal year 1954 are as follows:
