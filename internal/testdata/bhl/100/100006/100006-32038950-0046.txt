U. S. Customs Laws Regarding Landings of Fish From Joint 
 U. S. -Japanese Fishing Operations 

The U. S. Customs laws regarding landings of fishery products from joint U. S. - 
 Japanese fishing operations were outlined by the Bureau of Customs in a recent letter 
 to the State Department. The letter comments as follows: 

"Reference is made to your memorandum. . . You ask for the comments of this 
 Bureau with respect to certain of the questions raised. . .the Bureau's comments thereon 
 are as follows: 

"1. Under what conditions can processed fishery products, such as canned 
 crab meat, be landed at an American port if this product has been caught and 
 processed by a United States -Japanese joint fishing company incorporated in 
 accordance with United States laws and regulations? Catcher boats (Japanese) 
 and the mothership (American) would be under United States registry if per- 
 mitted by United States regulations. 

"Section 251, title 46, United States Code, restricts the American fisheries to ves- 
 sels of the United States properly documented to engage in that trade. A vessel which 
 is engaged in the catching of fish is engaged in the fisheries. Such a vessel also is en- 
 gaged in the fisheries when it transports its catch to shore. In addition, where one ves- 
 sel is used to catch the fish and another is used to transport the catch to shore, both 
 vessels are engaged in the fisheries so long as both are under the same ownership or 
 under the same complete control and management. 

"The Bureau assumes, and will so treat the subject, that (1) it is intended that the 
 operations of catching, processing, and transportation to port of fish products thereof 
 are to be conducted by means of vessels which, if not under the same ownership, are to 
 be under the same complete control and management, i. e. , the said United States- Jap- 
 anese joint fishing company, and (2) the mothership is to be so documented under the 
 laws of the United States as to entitle it to engage in fishing. The latter would require 
 the further assumption that the company is a citizen of the United States as defined in 
 the documentation laws. 

"Catcher boats of foreign build or ownership are not entitled to be documented for 
 the American fisheries nor may any undocumented vessel engage in the American fish- 
 ery except one of less than 5 net tons which is owned in the United States, or as here- 
 after stated in this paragraph. The catch of vessels of foreign build, flag, or ownership, 
 except as hereafter stated in this paragraph, will not be regarded as products of an 
 American fishery entitled to free entry under paragraph 1730 (a), Tariff Act of 1930, as 
 amended. The employment by an American fishery of citizens of a foreign country who 
 use their own foreign undocumented catcher vessels does not preclude free entry of their 
 catches under paragraph 1730 (a), supra .
