"If catcher boats built in the United States and owned by a citizen of the United 
 States, as defined in section 802, title 46, United States Code, which may include a 
 corporation organized and existing under the laws of the United States or of a State 
 thereof, the president and managing directors of which are citizens and of which at 
 least a controlling interest is vested in American citizens free from trust or fiduciary 
 obligation in favor of alien interests, are documented under the United States flag, they 
 will be entitled as vessels of the United States to engage in fishing and to land their 
 catches or products thereof at a United States port as products of an American fishery 
 entitled to free entry under the provisions of paragraph 1730 (a), Tariff Act of 1930, 
 as amended. Further, the United States-flag mothership will be entitled to transship 
 from the high seas such catches or the products processed therefrom at sea to a port 
 of the United States as products of an American fishery likewise entitled to free entry. 

"2. Is the entry of products caught and processed at sea by such enter- 
 prise subject to prohibition, restrictions, or import duties at the United 
 States port? These products would be transported from the fishing ground 
 to a United States port by the United States registered carrier. 

"The tariff status of fish not entitled to free entry as products of an American fish- 
 ery may be dutiable or entitled to free entry depending upon the type of fish and the pro- 
 cessing to which it has been subjected. For instance, tuna fish, fresh or frozen, is en- 
 titled to free entry under the provisions of paragraph 1756, Tariff Act of 1930, while 
 tuna, packed in air-tight containers (canned, not in oil), and tuna packed in oil (canned), 
 are dutiable under paragraphs 718 (b) and 718 (a), respectively. Crab meat, including 
 crab paste and crab sauce, packed in air-tight containers, is dutiable at the rate of 
 22^ per centum ad valorem under the provisions of paragraph 721 (a), Tariff Act of 
 1930. 

"No quota is in effect at this time on crabs or tuna fish or canned products thereof. 
 Groundfish, namely, cod, haddock, hake, pollock, cusk, and rosefish, excepting such 
 as are entitled to free entry as products of an American fishery, are subject upon en- 
 try to tariff rate quotas. " 

Wholesale Prices, August 195 3 

WHOLESALE PRICES . AUGUST 1953: Continued light production of edible fishery 
 products caused wholesale prices to again rise from July to August. The over-all edi- 
 ble fish and shellfish (fresh, frozen, and canned) wholesale index for August was 107. 8 
 percent of the 1947-49 average (see table)--5. 1 percent higher than in July and 8.0per- 
 cent above August 1952, the Bureau of Labor Statis- 
 tics of the Department of Labor reports. 

August prices for all varieties in the drawn, 
 dressed, or whole finfish subgroup were higher than 
 a month earlier, except western halibut and yellow 
 pike at New York City which were lower. The larg- 
 est increase (64. 9 percent) was for large drawn off- 
 shore haddock at Boston where continued light land- 
 ings caused ex-vessel prices to rise. The largest 
 price drop (8. 3 percent) was for western halibut at 
 New York City because the supply was liberal. Com- 
 pared with August 1952, all items under this sub- 
 group were priced higher this August except western 
 halibut at New York and lake trout at Chicago which 

were quoted lower. The drawn, dressed, or whole finfish index for August was 19. 9 
 percent higher than the previous month and 19 percent higher than in August 1952. 

Prices in August for fresh processed fish and shellfish were down 2. 1 percent prin- 
 cipally due to a 12. 7-percent drop in shrimp prices at New York City because shrimp
