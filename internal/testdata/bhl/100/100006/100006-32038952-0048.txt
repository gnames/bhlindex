 cent higher than for the same month in 1952. 

The over-all frozen processed fish and shellfish index for August was 10. 2 percent 
 under July and 1. 4 percent below a year ago. Shrimp prices tumbled (20. 2 percent) 
 again from the previous month due to increased production. Ocean perch fillet prices 
 were also down (5. 9 percent), while haddock fillets increased (7. 9 percent) due to light- 
 er landings at Boston. Frozen flounder fillets sold the same as in July. Compared with 
 August 1952, prices of haddock fillets and shrimp were up while those for flounder fil- 
 lets and ocean perch fillets were down. 

Maine sardines, the only canned fishery product item to show a price change from 
 July to August, went up 7. 4 percent; all others remained the same. Compared with 
 August 1952, pink salmon prices were lower, and tuna and Maine sardine quotations 
 were higher.
