FISHING VESSELS SOUGHT : A total of 29 fishing vessels for the Republic of Korea 
 were sought by UNKRA late this summer from shipbuilders and vessel owners in mem- 
 ber countries, according to the Director of that Agency. The closing date for the bids 
 was September 30, 1953. 

The vessels sought were to be either new or used and of the following types: 

Fourteen 75-ton wooden trawlers 
 Ten 30-ton purse seiners 
 Five 50-ton fish carriers 

Bids were received from several of the United Nations countries which indicated 
 wide variations in price and delivery. UNKRA later requested quotations from ship- 
 building industries of interested countries, together with definite plans and specifica- 
 tions of their standard construction vessels to confirm in general with the size and type 
 of boat indicated in the original specifications. 

The general requirements for the wooden trawlers were: 
 tons, powered with slow- turning four-cycle Diesel engines.

ADVISORY COMMITTEE APPROVES KOREAN REHABILITATION PROGRAM: The 
 five-nation Advisory Committee to the United Nations Korean Reconstruction Agency 
 (UNKRA) on August 26 approved the Agency's $130, 000, 000 program of long-range re- 
 habilitation of Korea for the year ending June 30, 1954. The Committee is composed of 
 Canada, India, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Uruguay. The '54 program, 
 which is essentially an extension of the $70, 000, 000 program undertaken by UNKRA last 
 fiscal year, will emphasize capital investment projects designed to provide the bone and 
 sinew of a viable Korean economy. 

In the reconstruction and rehabilitation categories the major expenditures include 
 $18, 000, 000 for agriculture, forestry, and fisheries. 

In the fields of agriculture, forestry, and fisheries, substantial sums will be spent 
 to. rehabilitate the fishing industry, and on irrigation, land reclamation, and river con- 
 trol. 

The Advisory Committee, as in the past, plans to keep the program under review 
 in order to insure flexibility and to enable it to consider modifications that may from 
 time to time be found desirable, after consultations with the Government of the Republic 
 of Korea and the United Nations Command, either to improve its effectiveness or to meet 
 changing conditions in Korea.
