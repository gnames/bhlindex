ANTARCTIC 1953/54 CATCH QUOTA REDUCED : The annual catch limitation for 
 baleen whales during the 1953/54 Antarctic pelagic season will be reduced from 16, 000 
 to 15, 500 blue-whale units, subject to final approval by member nations of the Interna- 
 tional Whaling Commission, according to information published in the August 17 Foreign 
 Crops and Markets of the Department of Agriculture. This action was taken during the 
 fifth Annual Meeting of the Commission held at London, England, June 22-26, 1953, and 
 was regarded as necessary to protect world whale stocks. 

Other amendments to the Schedule annexed to the 1946 International Conventionfor 
 the Regulation of Whaling, and approved by the Commission, included: (1) prohibiting 
 the taking of blue whales in the Antarctic before January 16, 1954, and (2) permitting 
 the taking of humpback whales in the Antarctic on February 1, 2, 3, 4. The opening 
 date of the 1953/54 pelagic whaling season is January 2, 1954. 

The Commission decided to convene its sixth meeting at Tokyo, Japan, on July 19,

BRITISH COLUMBIA PATROL VESSELS SCOUT FOR TUNA : British Columbia 
 fishermen get quick word on the arrival of tuna in northern Pacific waters from the 
 Government senior fisheries protection cruisers operating in the North Pacific area, 
 reports the July 1953 Trade News , a Canadian Government publication. The patrol ves- 
 sels --Laurier, Howay. and Kitimat - -carry trolling gear to use for tuna if certain water 
 conditions occur on their regular offshore patrols. This is one of the summer routines 
 which Canadian Fisheries Department vessels undertake to make sure that British Co- 
 lumbia fishermen are quickly notified when tuna arrive in commercial quantities in 
 northern Pacific waters. 

When these vessels arrive at offshore coastal waters, the fishing fleet is advised 
 and hundreds of radio-telephone receivers are tuned in each day to hear broadcasts 
 from the fisheries patrol boats . Daily broadcasts on whether or not tuna have been 
 found are given on the fishermen's wave band. Should there be a "strike, " fishermen 
 will be the first to know. 

Only one or two boats have ever been built and equipped expressly for tuna fishing 
 in British Columbia, but the halibut fleet (now for the most part idle) and the larger 
 salmon trollers are ready at all times to put to sea in a hurry. 

So far as the British Columbia fishing industry is concerned, albacore tuna are un- 
 predictable. In the early history of the Province they were unknown to the fisheries.
