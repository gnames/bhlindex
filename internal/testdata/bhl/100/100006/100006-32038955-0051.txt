October 1953 COMMERCIAL FISHERIES REVIEW 49 

This may have been due to the fact that in those early daysthe fishing vesselswere not 
 large and sturdy enough to venture far enough out into the Pacific waters where tuna schools 
 occur. In the present century, design and construction of fishing vessels has steadily im- 
 proved and fishermen have pushed farther and farther westward in their search for fish. 
 In 19 39 the first landings of tuna (284, 000 pounds) went almost unheralded, but fisher- 
 men began to look for this good- selling variety from then on . Subsequent landings 
 fluctuated and dwindled. The first big year came in 1945, when 1,428,000 pounds were 
 caught off the B. C. coast and landed in B. C. ports. The catch exceeded the 2, 000, 000 
 pound mark in 1948 for the first time. The following year a record 2, 230, 000 pounds 
 were landed. The tuna taken in 1948 and 1949 conbined put a total of nearly a million 
 dollars into the pockets of British Columbia fishermen, and the fishery was hailed as 
 of ranking importance in the over-all value of the Province's fisheries. 

But in the next and succeeding years the tuna fishery fell off abruptly. Since 1949 
 landings of tuna from catches made off the British Columbia coast have dropped to a 
 trickle. Some of this variety is brought in by B. C. fishermen who have fished off the 
 coasts of Washington, Oregon, and even California, and there have been considerable 
 imports of Japanese-caught tuna for processing in B. C. canneries, but quantities 
 caught directly offshore from the B. C. coast during the past three years have been 
 almost negligible. 

The albacore tuna is a "schooling" fish. Off the coast of British Columbia theyhave 
 been taken relatively close to land and as far out as 100 miles. Apparently they are 
 the offshoots of the big tuna runs which appear more or less steadily off California. 
 Only when water temperatures and feed conditions are favorable do they seek the more 
 northerly latitudes. The Department of Fisheries has never lost sight of the fact that 
 in any year these conditions might recur. 

Since the first landings of tuna in British Columbia, scientists of the Fisheries 
 Research Board of Canada have added the variety to the list of fishes which receive 
 careful and continuing biological study. At the Pacific Biological Station at Nanaimo, 
 a useful store of knowledge has already accumulated; to this has been added knowledge 
 of a practical kind resulting from actual fishing experiences contributed by the admin- 
 istrative branch of the fisheries in the Pacific area. It is now known that the albacore 
 feeds on pelagic fishes and other small marine life, such surface food being present 
 only in waters of certain fairly high temperatures. Masters of fishery protection cruis- 
 ers have noted that sweeps of clear blue water and the presence of certain so-called 
 "tuna birds" are an indication that "tuna conditions" may be favorable.

FISHERMEN'S INDEMNITY FUND GOES INTO EFFECT : The Fishermen's Indem- 
 nity Fund, set up by the Canadian Government to enable fishermen to obtain protection 
 against loss or serious damage to their vessels for a yearly premium of one percent, 
 went into effect on July 6 in the Maritime Provinces and on July 13 in British Columbia, 
 Quebec, and Newfoundland. 

Fishermen are urged to take advantage of this plan, reports the June 1953 Trade 
 News , a Canadian Government publication. It represents a long-term solution to the 
 problem of compensation when losses occur and it permits a fisherman to retain his 
 independence when misfortune strikes. A specially-trained group of Department of 
 Fisheries officers will carry out necessary appraisals of vessels and assume other 
 duties associated with the plan. 

The Fishermen's Indemnity Fund provides protection for fishing vessels ranging 
 in value from C$250 to C$7, 500 for a premium of only one percent of the value of the 
 vessel. It gives an indemnity of 60 percent of the appraised value in the case of total 
 loss. In case of serious damage--over 30 percent of the appraised value--there will be 
 an indemnity of 85 percent of the amount by which the repair bills are in excess of the 
 30 percent minimum.
