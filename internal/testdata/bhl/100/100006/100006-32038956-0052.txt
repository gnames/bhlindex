FISHING INDUSTRY LACKS SUFFICIENT COLD - STORAGE FACILITIES : Lack of 
 cold-storage facilities is one of the greatest difficulties facing the Canadian fishing in- 
 dustry, the Fisheries Minister of New Brunswick told a group of southern New Bruns- 
 wick fishermen at St. John on June 17. 

Public cold-storage plants were being built through funds supplied by the National 
 Harbours Board and Industrial Bank loans supplemented by Canadian Government sub- 
 sidies, he said. In some cases, "outright gifts" of C$10,000 were extended to fisher- 
 men's cooperatives which made the freezing facilities available to the public, reports 
 the August 1953 Ice and Refrigeration .

SASKATCHEWAN STUDIES GREATER FISHERY UTILIZATION OF ITS LAKES : 
 The Saskatchewan Fisheries Branch is undertaking a detailed biological study of lakes 
 in the Buffalo region of northwestern Saskatchewan, which will make possible higher 
 utilization of these waters, the Saskatchewan Fisheries Director said recently. 

A start on the study (expected to be completed in 1956) was made in the summer of 
 1952. Lakes under investigation are Peter Pond, Churchill, Frobisher, and Lac Ile- 
 a-la-Crosse, reports the August 4 Saskatchewan News, a Saskatchewan Government 
 publication. 

The study will determine the safe annual limit of fish which may be harvested from 
 the lakes, and particularly the maximum production figure for rough fish like tullibee. 

Information gained from the study is needed for implementation of a management 
 program "serving the best interests of both commercial fishermen and mink ranchers, " 
 states the Director. Because mink ranching is becoming an important industry in the 
 area, he said, it is essential that production of species like tullibee, used as mink food, 
 be increased.

TAX EXEMPTIONS AND OTHER BENEFITS GRANTED TO FISHERIES : In order 
 to stimulate the Chilean fishing industry, various tax exemptions and other Government 
 aids were granted the Chilean fisheries in Decree No. 208 of July 21, 1953, anAugust 6 
 U. S. Embassy dispatch from Santiago states. 

In the first place, the Decree exempts the fishing industry for a period of ten years 
 from the following taxes: a portion of the income tax; the excess-profits tax; certain 
 taxes on vessels and equipment; the production tax on marine-oil manufacturers; and 
 import duties on equipment and materials employed by the fishing industry. The Decree 
 also establishes under the Ministry of Agriculture a Consultative Council for Fish and 
 Game. 

The most noteworthy of the privileges accorded under the Decree, from the United 
 States point of view, is the exemption of fishing concerns from foreign exchange regula- 
 tions on their exports. Thus, exporters of fish may hereafter convert foreign exchange 
 into Chilean pesos at rates up to and including the free market curb rate. This will
