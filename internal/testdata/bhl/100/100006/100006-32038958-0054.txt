52 COMMERCIAL FISHERIES REVIEW Vol. 15, No. 10 

Colombia's first fish cannery, situated in the Pacific port of Buenaventura, is ex- 
 pected to be completed by the end of 1953 at a cost of 5 million pesos (US$2 million). 
 The cannery is operated with all-Colombian capital. It is expected that several types 
 of fish found in the Pacific coastal waters will be canned on a commercial basis once 
 the plant begins to operate.

U. S. GOOD MARKET FOR DANISH FISHERY PRODUCTS: The situation with re- 
 gard to Danish exports of fishery products to the United States was reviewed recently 
 by the Danish fishery attache stationed in New York, according to a report in Dansk 
 Fiskeritidende (July 24, 1953), a Danish trade paper. The attache stated that the large 
 increase in exports of Danish fillets had been dealt a hard blow by the drastic drop in 
 cod fillet prices in the U. S. , but that the situation had corrected itself insofar as cod 
 was concerned and it was believed that a price increase would occur. He stressed the 
 need for laying great weight on quality because the importers were very particular and 
 competition was keen. 

He also mentioned that Danish exporters must consider other packing methods 
 more suited to U. S. tastes. The export of preserved fish, especially brisling, was 
 thought to have possibilities. There was great interest in Danish fish meal. All fish 
 meal offered had been sold. 

The merchandising of Danish brook trout also had been satisfactory. In 1951 Den- 
 mark exported brook trout to the U. S. valued at Kr. 3, 300, 000 (US$477, 000). In 1952 
 the exports increased to a value of Kr. 5, 500, 000 (US$795, 000). Restaurants were the 
 most important users of Danish brook trout, but there appeared to be a definite possi- 
 bility to increase sales of brook trout by packing them in cartons.

NEW TUNA FIRM FORMED BY U. S. CITIZEN : A new company that will handle 
 frozen tuna has been formed in Ecuador under the managership of a United States citi- 
 zen, states an August 11 U. S. Embassy dispatch from Quito. The company has an 
 authorized capital of 100, 000 sucres (US$6, 600). It is now operating with a provisional 
 permit to purchase fish only, but hopes to work out a contract with the government which 
 will permit it to operate its own boats. The new company now has a freezer boat in 
 Manta harbor which will be used in transporting the fish to Seattle, Washington. 

The firm is now purchasing tuna at the port of Manta. Catches are rather small 
 because the Manta fishermen are experiencing poor fishing conditions for this time of 
 the year, reportedly due to the fish staying farther offshore than usual and beyond the 
 range at which the inshore boats normally operate. 

FISHING FOR GOATFISH BY FOREIGN VESSELS BANNED OFF GALAPAGOS IS- 

5SEI 

LANDS: Fishing for goatfish (cabrilla or bacalaoi/) by foreign-flag boats is henceforth 
 prohibited in Ecuadoran territorial waters around the Galapagos Islands by virtue of 
 Decree No. 950-d published in Official Register No. 283 of August 6, 1953. Reasons 
 for this measure as given in the Decree are that fishing for goatfish in those waters has 
 been too intensive; that the goatfish reserves are menaced with depletion; and that this 
 important food item of the low-income diet might thus become insufficient for domestic 
 consumption. The Decree also refers to the need for guaranteeing continuing employ- 
 ment to Ecuadoran fishermen engag ed in fishing for goatfish. 

J/ THE TERM "bACALAo" GENERALLY REFERS TO SALTED COD, BUT IS COMMONLY USED FOR ALL TYPES OF FISH THAT ARE 
 SALTED.
