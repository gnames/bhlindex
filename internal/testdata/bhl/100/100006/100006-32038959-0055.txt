In addition to prohibiting fishing for goatfish by foreign-flag vessels, the Decree 
 provides that goatfish may not be exported from Ecuador unless the Minister of Economy 
 grants a special license for such exportation after having determined that goatfish re- 
 serves are sufficient to satisfy domestic consumption needs, an August 21 U. S. Em- 
 bassy dispatch from Quito states.,

EAST GERMANY PLACES LARGE FISH ORDERS: The Food Section of the East 
 German Government's Office of Import and Export has concluded an agreement with 
 representatives of the fishing industry at Hamburg, Bremerhaven, Cuxhaven, and Kiel 
 in West Germany, whereby fish valued at DM11, 000, 000 (US$2, 616, 000) will be deliv- 
 ered from those ports to the Soviet Zone. Of this sum, Hamburg and Bremerhaven re- 
 ceived orders totaling DM3, 500, 000 (US$832, 000) each; while the orders for fish from 
 Cuxhaven and Kiel totaled DM3,000,000 (US$713,000) and DM1, 000, 000 (US$238,000), 
 respectively. German officials feel that the amount ordered from Hamburg will be 
 raised to DM7, 000, 000 (US$1, 664, 000), and possibly mayreach ashigh as DM15,000,000 
 (US$3, 567, 000), a July 31 U. S. consular dispatch from Hamburg states. 

An official of the Fish Section of the German Federal Food Office emphasized that 
 fish shipments from these ports to the East are necessary, since the division of Ger- 
 many has adversely affected the West German fishing industry. Before World War II, 
 40 percent of the fish caught at these ports was consumed in the Soviet Zone; whereas, 
 in 1952 only 9, 000 metric tons (1 percent of the total catch) were delivered to that zone. 

To minimize the propaganda value of this trade and to insure that only reliable firms 
 obtain export licenses, the West German Federal Government has established sales or- 
 ganizations which will control the export of fish to the Soviet Zone.

SCOTTISH TRAWLER PURCHASED : The Scottish trawler Goodmar . one of the 
 largest in the Aberdeen fishing fleet, has been purchased by a Greek firm, according to 
 the July 18 issue of The Fishing News , a British trade magazine. The vessel sailed 
 from Aberdeen on July 12 with an Aberdeen crew, who are under a six-months' contract, 
 which might be renewed. 

The vessel (renamed Jason by its Greek owner) has been purchased as an experi- 
 ment. The captain and his crew are to teach the Greeks the Scottish method of trawling. 

At Piraeus, Greece, the vessel will be overhauled and fitted with the latest type of 
 refrigeration plant. This and other machinery was taken on board the vessel at Aber- 
 deen along with modern trawling gear. Thereafter, the trawler wiU proceed to the west 
 coast of Africa, where a type of bream is caught. After gutting and cleaning the fish, 
 they will be quick-frozen and stored until a full catch has been obtained.
