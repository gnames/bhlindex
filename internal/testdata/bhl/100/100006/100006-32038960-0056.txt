TRADE AGREEMENT WITH RUSSIA INVOLVES LARGE QUANTITIES OF FISH - 
 ERY PRODUCTS : A trade agreement between Iceland and the U. S. S. R. involving ~~ 
 large quantities of fishery products was signed in Moscow on August 1, 1953, by the 
 Chief of the Foreign Trade Section of the Icelandic Foreign Office, and representa- 
 tives of the U.S.S.R. Ministry of Trade. The agreement is effective for one year be- 
 ginning July 1, 1953, reports an August 4 U. S. Consular dispatch from Reykjavik. 

The agreement provides for the exchange of the following commodities: 

(1) 21, 000 metric tons (about 46, 300, 000 pounds) of frozen Icelandic cod and 
 ocean perch (presumably fillets) for 200, 000 tons of Russian POL products, including 
 90, 000 tons of gas oil, 80, 000 tons of fuel oil, and 30, 000 tons of motor gas. This is 
 a straight barter. 

(2) 75, 000 bbls. of salted Faxa Bay herring (about 7, 500 tons) with an optional 
 25,000 bbls. additional. 

(3) 50, 000 bbls. of salted North Coast herring (about 5, 000 tons) with an optional 
 30, 000 bbls. additional. 

(4) 2, 600 metric tons of frozen Faxa Bay herring, with an optional 3, 000 tons 
 additional, on a barter basis for rye meal, rice, potato starch, reinforcing bars, 
 galvanized and black pipe, and cement. 

The above-listed Icelandic imports represent the country's annual requirements 
 in most cases. The total value of trade is estimatedat aboutl.Kr. 180 million (US$11 
 million) .

LOANS FROM INTERNATIONAL BANK TO DEVELOP AGRICULTURE AND LES - 
 SEN DEPENDENCE ON FISHERIES : The International Bank for Reconstruction and 
 Development on September 4 made two loans for Iceland in European currencies, ac- 
 cording to a September 4 release from that organization. One (in various currencies 
 equivalent to US$1, 350, 000) will assist in carrying forward a program of agricultural 
 development. The other of L90, 000 (US$252, 000) is to finance the construction of a 
 building to house radio transmitter equipment serving North Atlantic air traffic. 

The agricultural loan, like the one made in 1951, is to further a program begun 
 in 1951 to increase Iceland's agricultural production. The purpose of the program is 
 to restore agriculture to its former place of importance and lessen Iceland's depend- 
 ence on the fishing industry. The program aims to increase agricultural production 
 50 percent by 1965, and should improve Iceland's foreign exchange position consider- 
 ably through import savings and export earnings. 

India 

FISHERIES DEVELOPMENTS : Experiments in deep-sea fishing carried out by 
 the Government of India off the West Coast, and by the West Bengal Government in 
 the Bay of Bengal, indicate that this type of fishing on a commercial basis is econom- 
 ically feasible, and can contribute substantially to the country's food resources. A 
 250-ton Japanese trawler brought in by the Government for exploratory work in the 
 Arabian Sea made a record catch this season and completed operations with a net prof- 
 it. Now that the financial soundness of the venture has been demonstrated, the Gov- 
 ernment hopes that Indian private enterprise will be encouraged to enter the field on 
 its own or in collaboration with Japanese fishing interests, reports the August 22 For- 
 eign Trade , a Canadian Government publication.
