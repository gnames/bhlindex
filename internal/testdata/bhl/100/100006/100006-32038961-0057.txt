COMMERCIAL FISHERIES REVIEW 

55 

The Deep-Sea Fishing Station at Bombay is employing two 100-ton trawlers to 
 drag the ocean bed and two smaller "reckie" boats for surface and mid-water fishing. 
 These vessels will gather information on fishing conditions off the West Coast--such 
 as the types and numbers of fish available at different seasons, the depths at which 
 they are found, and the kind of equipment required to catch them- -and will train fish- 
 ermen in the proper techniques. On the average, 75 percent of the catch made by the 
 trawlers, operating mainly within the 40 -fathom limit, consisted of fish of high food 
 value, including dara, ghol, mullets, pomfret, and eels. The results of the surface 
 and mid-water fishing have been less successful, largely because of inexperience, 
 and the Government has arranged to bring a master fisherman from the United King- 
 dom to supervise operations during the coming season. 

The catches made in the Bay of Bengal by two trawlers purchased from Denmark 
 by the West Bengal Government were also encouraging. The trawlers were manned 
 by Danish crews who will eventually be replaced by Indians. The three Japanese bull- 
 trawlers which the West Bengal and Indian Government will soon acquire in partner- 
 ship will materially expand exploration in the waters off the East Coast. 

Two new cold-storage plants, similar to the large Central Government facilities 
 already in operation in Bombay, are being built by the Madras Government at the 
 West Coast ports of Mangalore and Calicut. Work is also progressing on ten small 
 ice factories and cold-storage plants which are being built with foreign assistance in 
 the states of Saurashtra, Bombay, Cochin, Madras, and Orissa.

TUNA EXPORT LEGISLATION MAKES NO PROGRESS : The proposed bills which 
 would favor the export of canned over frozen tuna did not make any headway in the 
 session of the Diet which adjourned August 10. Consideration of legislation to encour- 
 age the exportation of marine products (including tuna) may be discussed at the next 
 ordinary session of the Diet scheduled to begin in December, reports an August 12 
 U. S. Embassy dispatch from Tokyo.
