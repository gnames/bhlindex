BERING SEA CRAB EXPEDITION COMPLETES SUCCESSFUL SEASON : The 
 Japanese crab expedition to the Bering Sea completed its fishing in Bristol Bay onAu- 
 gust 16, ending a successful season, according to a recent U. S. Embassy dispatch 
 from Tokyo. Preliminary data indicate a total production of 58, 240 cases (48 cans of 
 6j ounces each), consisting of 47, 858 cases of first-grade and 10, 382 of third-grade 
 crab meat. The target catch was originally set by the Japanese Government (April 
 1953) at 50,000 cases, but because of goodfishing was raisedto 57, 000 cases on July 8. 
 The excess of 1, 240 cases is reported to represent the catch of the gear in the water atthe 
 time the canning operation aboard the mothership reached the limit of 57, 000 cases. 

Most of the canned crab meat is expected to be exported to the United States. To- 
 tal Japanese exports of this product in 1952 amounted to 111,492 cases, consisting of 
 85, 236 cases of king crab and 26, 256 cases of other crab. Of this total, 95, 961 cases 
 (84 percent) was shipped to the United States.
