October 195 3 COMMERCIAL FISHERIES REVIEW 57 

preliminary data indicate a pack of 37,427 cases (48 cans of 7 ounces each), con- 
 sisting of 21, 450 cases of red and 16, 977 cases of pink salmon. Canning of some of 
 the catch of the other two fleets will be done at shore facilities in Japan- -about 
 40, 000 cases (10, 000 cases of red and 30, 000 cases of pink) may be packed. 

Much of the salmon catch is expected to be consumed in the Japanese domestic 
 market as frozen, salted, and canned. Exporters are showing interest in increasing 
 exports of canned salmon despite high prices being quoted in the Japanese domestic 
 market. With the recent relaxation of restrictions on imports from Japan by Aus- 
 tralia, expectations are for expanded exports of canned salmon to that country. Tokyo 
 firms have reportedly concluded a contract to ship 20,000 cases (96 cans of 3j ounces 
 each) to Australia in 1953 at US$29 per case for red and US$23 for pink salmon, f. o.b. 
 Japan. Total Japanese exports of canned salmon to all countries in 1952 totaled 
 38, 210 cases (48 cans of 7 ounces each), mostly to Ireland and the Netherlands; Aus- 
 tralia received 2, 072 cases. Shipments to United States and territories were to 
 Guam only (1, 090 cases).

FAQ EXPERTS AID FISHERIES : Expansion of the Liberian fisheries on the At- 
 lantic Coast might now be possible through technical assistance provided by Food and 
 Agriculture Organization (FAO) experts, reports an August bulletin from that agency. 
 FAO has one expert on fishing craft and gear, and another working on fish process- 
 ing. The Liberian assistants assigned to the FAO project were given instruction at 
 a practical fisheries course started by FAO experts. They studied navigation, use 
 and repair of oil engines, fish processing, wire trap making, and net making and 
 repair. 

With the Liberian assistants they have trained, and using their motorized canoe, 
 the FAO motorboat, and nets and other gear manufactured in their school, the FAO 
 men have proved that they can trawl as far as ten miles out and bring in large catches 
 of a wide variety of fish and shellfish. They have sold most of this at low prices- -15 
 cents a pound--to consumers in Monrovia who could not previously afford to eat fish. 

They have also demonstrated that it is feasible to process good quality smoked 
 fish which stays in good condition long enough for transport and marketing in the in- 
 terior.

FROZEN FILLETS STORED AT TRONDHEIM FOR EXPORT TO UNITED STATES : 
 Recently a contract was signed between a Trondheim (central Norway) cold-storage 
 firm and the large Norwegian fish producing corporation in north Norway, whereby 
 large quantities of frozen fish fillets from north Norway will be shipped to Trondheim 
 and await shipment to the United States. In order to meet the stepped -up require- 
 ments, the Trondheim company is building new facilities that will double its cold- 
 storage capacity, according to an August 13 release from the Norwegian Information 
 Service. 

This new era in exporting fillets was initiated on July 14 when a 12, 000-ton U. S. 
 vessel ( Mormacmail ) sailed with a cargo of 130 metric tons of frozen fish fillets and 
 400 tons of herring meal and canned fish for the United States market. Late in July, 
 another vessel ( Lyngenf jord) sailed with a large consignment of frozen fish fillets; and 
 on August 13 a third vessel ( Thalatta ) was due to sail to the United States with frozen 
 fillets.
