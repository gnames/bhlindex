BARENTS SEA COD INVESTIGATIONS : An investigation of the food conditions of 
 cod in the Barents Sea in the Arctic Ocean northeast of Norway is being made by the 
 Norwegian fisheries research vessel G. O. Sars , reports the Norwegian Information 
 Service in a September 3 release. The vessel left the port of Tromso recently. The 
 expedition is headed by a consultant of the Norwegian Fisheries Directorate and two 
 other scientists. 

Interviewed by the newspaper Tromso . the consultant observed that a good deal 
 was known about the mature Arctic -Norwegian cod. It has been established that when 
 the cod are 8 to 10 years old they leave the Barents Sea to spawn on the banks off 
 North Norway, thus providing the basis for the important Lofoten cod fisheries. What 
 the present expedition will look into are the conditions of the cod before they start 
 spawning. As the Lofoten cod shoals fluctuate in size from year to year, Norwegian 
 scientists are inclined to believe that these variations are related to conditions pre- 
 vailing in the Barents Sea. 

In an effort to throw light on this moot subject, the researchers aboardG. O. Sars 
 plan to study the food supplies available to the Arctic -Norwegian cod, as well as other 
 factors that could influence the annual fish migrations to the Lofoten banks. They al- 
 so hope to determine how far north the cod go in the Barents Sea. To do so, they will 
 measure the temperature and the salt content of the ocean water all the way to Franz 
 Josef Land. It has previously been observed that cod are found only in water with a 
 temperature of over 35Â° F.

TUNA CATCH POOR : Only about 600 metric tons of tuna had been landed inNorway 
 towardtheendof July, or about one -tenth as much as at the same time in 1952, according 
 to a report in Fiskaren (July 29) , a Norwegian trade paper. The quality of the fish landed 
 was good and sales contracts were being sought in the United States and in Italy.

FISHING REGULATIONS AMENDED : The Panamanian Minister of Agriculture on 
 August 5 issued Decree 172 effective immediately, which: (1) prohibits commercial 
 fishing "within waters of the continental shelf of the Republic" except by persons pos- 
 sessing a second-class commercial license; (2) "until the Executive Organ dictates an 
 organic law on this subject, commercial fishing will be permitted only by" Panaman- 
 ian-built vessels, but the vessels already imported for this purpose are excepted from 
 this provision. The preamble states that the purpose of the Decree is to protect na- 
 tional marine life against exploitation and to develop local shipbuilding. Bait fishing 
 by ocean-going vessels is not affected by the Decree and will be governed by special 
 provisions, an August 6 U. S. Embassy dispatch from Panama City states. 

Significantly, the Decree implements the Panamanian claim to the continental shelf . 
 Also, for the first time a specified commercial license is required (costing US$10 
 yearly) which can be bought only by Panamanian and American citizens.

COMMERCIAL FISHING ESTABLISHES RECORD YEAR : During 1952 a total of 
 4, 527, 060 pounds of fish and shellfish, with a value of $1, 051, 999, was taken from the 
 Gulf of Panama (Pacific side) as revealed by official data supplied by the Panamanian 
 Office of Statistics. During 1951, a total of 1, 892, 075 pounds was caught, valued at 
 $373,100, reports a recent U. S. Embassy dispatch from Panama.
