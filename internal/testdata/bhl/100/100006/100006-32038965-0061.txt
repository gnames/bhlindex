SHRIMP SHIPPED TO U. S. : For the first time there has been a shipment of 
 frozen shrimp from Spain to the United States, reports the U. S. Consulate at Seville. 
 Late in June a firm in Huelva shipped five tons of frozen shrimp to a Puerto Rico firm 
 for reshipment to the continental United States. It is predicted that the shipment of 
 frozen shrimp from Spain to the United States will become an important item in future 
 trade. Negotiations are now under way to supply large quantities of shrimp from the 
 new freezing plant in Cadiz which is due to open soon.
