The people of Thailand have not been undernourished; but they have been mal- 
 nourished, because their basic diet was not filled out with enough proteins. Tilapia, 
 introduced into Thailand by the FAO, and multiplying at a phenomenal rate, is rapid- 
 ly becoming the standard protein supplement to the standard carbohydrate diet of the 
 ordinary people of Thailand. 

The farmers of Thailand call the Tilapia "The mad fish of the Orient. The fish 
 that eats like mad, grows like mad, and reproduces like mad. " Tilapia are mouth 
 breeders. They protect their eggs during the incubation period and their young in 
 moments of danger by guarding them in their mouths.

CANNED FISH EXPORTS TO U. S. INCREASED : Approximately 300, 000 cases 
 (48 1 -pound cans) of canned pilchard and jack mackerel (maasbankers) have been sold 
 for delivery to the United States, reports an August 11 U. S. consular dispatch from 
 Cape Town. This represents about 35 percent of the 1952 production of canned pil- 
 chards and maasbankers. 

Because of the disappearance of the California sardine, these purchases of can- 
 ned fish are to be used primarily by United States firms to maintain their positions 
 in various world markets. In fact, it is believed that most of the 300, 000 cases were 
 purchased by a representative of one of the largest of the California fish canning com- 
 panies. 

South African fish canners are also taking an interest in the Philippine market 
 where the absence of California sardines has created a strong demand for the South 
 African product.

FISHERMEN'S TRAINING SCHOOL : Beginning in 1954, young men wishing to be- 
 come fishermen will receive a special training course at the South African Naval 
 Gymnasium at Saldanha Bay. This course will be open to medically fit Europeans be- 
 tween the ages of 16 and 22 possessing a Standard VH certificate. Training will take 
 a year and 30 trainees will be admitted in 1954, reports the July 1953 South African 
 Shipping News and Fishing Industry Review . 

This vocational training scheme represents the culmination of more than 20 years 
 of effort by Dr. Cecil von Bonde and other leaders in the fishing industry to develop 
 schools for fishermen. 

The practical or vocational school would provide competent and well-trained fish- 
 ermen for the vessels. The trainees would receive instruction in navigation, seaman- 
 ship, engine maintenance, signalling, tending nets, and in several other aspects of 
 fishing. 

In a longer and more detailed schooling, young men could be trained for work a- 
 shore. The latter would take a comprehensive course which would include such sub- 
 jects as fisheries science, plant operation, accounting, fisheries economics, etc. This 
 fisheries school or university course would correspond to the instruction provided in 
 the various agricultural colleges. 

The detailed course is still to come, but beginning in 1955 the South African fish- 
 ing industry can count on a trained nucleus of young fishermen. Not only will they have 
 been well-grounded in fishing practice, but they should also show the benefits of a full 
 year under naval discipline; for the 30 trainees are to be accepted as full-time cadets 
 for one year in the South African Navy.
