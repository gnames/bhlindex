This will provide the Navy with a valuable reservoir of trained men for use in 
 an emergency. The 30 fishing trainees are to receive free board and lodging at the 
 Gymnasium, they will get free medical treatment, free uniforms, and, instead of 
 having to pay for their training, they will receive Navy rates of pay for full-time 
 service. In addition, the fishing course exempts the recruit from normal part-time 
 military training.

WHITE FISH AUTHORITY TO SURVEY OPERATING COSTS OF DISTANT - WATER 
 TRAWLERS : At the suggestion of trawler owners in Hull, Grimsby, and Fleetwood, 
 the "profit and loss" accounts of nearly 300 distant-water trawlers are to be exam- 
 ined as part of a nationwide survey by the White Fish Authority (WFA) into the oper- 
 ating costs of Britain's fish industry, states the August 15 Fish Trades Gazette , a 
 British trade magazine. The trawler check will cover the two years ending Septem- 
 ber 30 this year, and when completed will give the WFA a complete picture of the 
 trading operations of an important section of the fish-catching industry- -a section 
 that catches half the white fish landed in the United Kingdom. 

The three -page questionnaire to be sent to trawler owners represents the first 
 attempt by the WFA at tabulating the accounts of the distant-water section of the in- 
 dustry, for the trawlers concerned do not come within the Authority's subsidy scheme. 

Owners will be asked for each trawler to give the value of landings during the 
 last two years, the number of voyages made, and the number of days spent at sea. 
 Questions on expenses will include the cost of fuel, provisions, repairs and gear, 
 marine insurance, and the wages of officers and men.

PREFABRICATED REFRIGERATED WAREHOUSES : A London firm is soon to 
 market a prefabricated refrigerated warehouse, reports the July 25 issue of The 
 Fishing News , a British trade magazine. It is claimed that this type warehouse will 
 cut the capital cost in half as compared with the conventional cold-storage buildings, 
 and also greatly re- 
 duce labor costs. A 
 scale model of this 
 warehouse was ex- 
 hibited in London re- 
 cently and attracted 
 much attention from 
 refrigeration experts, 
 representatives of the 
 fish industry, and oth- 
 ers interested in cold 
 storage . 

SCALE MODEL OF PREFABRICATED 
 COLD-STORAGE WAREHOUSE. 

The construction 
 of the warehouse is 
 simplified by covering 

the roof with continuous aluminum sheeting, secured by clip-on rolls. It is claimed 
 that this method eliminated horizontal joins and consequent leakage. 

It was also claimed that the high cost of manual labor in loading and unloading- - 
 (a serious economic problem to all large-scale cold-storage operators)-- was greatly 
 reduced in the new prefabricated design by its clear, pillarless working space, some 
 18 ft. high, in which it is possible to operate an electric pallet -stacking truck handling 
 large quantities of goods with only one operator. At the same time, the high volume-
