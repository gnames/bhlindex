to-area of insulation ratio reduced capital cost and the power consumption of the re- 
 frigeration plant; while because of the design of the warehouse the refrigeration plant 
 itself necessitated less cost. 

The storage plant costs L30, 000 (US$84,000) without the refrigeration plant, and 
 is to be supplied- -with its own engineroom and reception bay--in standard parts, 
 ready for quick and simple erection. The inside dimensions of the smallest unit are 
 65 x 62 x 18 feet, providing 73, 000 cubic feet of storage space. Larger units with a 
 clear span of up to 200 feet, by any length, will be supplied. The engineroom section 
 can be made larger to hold other processing equipment. 

Another model was shown also. This is a pipe-frame cold-storage warehouse 
 and smaller than the other type described above. In this unit no structural steel is 
 used, the building frame being made from standard refrigeration pipes. This design 
 is not yet commercially available, but it is proposed to make it available in the form 
 of standard truss sections (20, 30, or 40 feet wide) to be assembled in units to form 
 plants of varying widths and lengths. Insulation will be provided by standardized in- 
 sulation blocks to form an envelope over the building. Besides saving labor, this 
 warehouse is estimated to save 60 percent in capital cost. 

Also on show was an insulated transit container, described as the cheapest and 
 lightest made, and suitable for shipping frozen fish. The medium size (1-f cubic feet) 
 weighs only 32 pounds. The container is very durable, and its cost ranges from 
 L5 10s. (US$15.40) for the 1-cubic foot size to L9 10s. (US$26.60) for the 2^-cubic 
 foot size.

UNDERWATER TELEVISION CAMERA VIEWS SEA BOTTOM : Trials with under- 
 water television have provided new information about the sea floor, says the British 
 Institute of Oceanography, giving details on equipment developed by the Admiralty on 
 the Royal Research ship Discovery II. The trials show that the technique could develop 
 into a valuable oceanographical instrument, especially if used in conjunction with other 
 gear, reports the July 25 issue of the Fishing News, a British trade magazine. 

The camera was first installed on the Discovery D. last summer. A modified TV 
 receiver was used as the main monitor, and pictures displayed on the camera control- 
 unit monitor were photographed when required by a camera attached to the unit. The 
 unit in its present form is cumbersome, however, and its scope is limited by its 
 weight, making it unsafe to use except in calm water, and difficult to lower to any 
 great depth. But these objections are likely to be overcome. 

So far the television has been most successful in views of the sea bottom, and the 
 Institute regards the pictures taken as of permanent value. Shoals of fish have been 
 seen on several occasions; also plankton organism--these mostly as spots of light, 
 though occasionally the type of organism could be identified. 

Observations on the sea bottom were made in about 33 fathoms off Falmouth, in 
 60 fathoms near the mouth of the English Channel, and in about 80 fathoms near the 
 edge of the continental slope; also off Portugal on the Gettysburg Bank, and on the 
 rocky sea bottom around the Azores. 

RUSSIA ORDERS TRAWLERS : Orders for the building of fishing trawlers for Rus- 
 sia have been received by two British firms --one in Aberdeen and the other in Lowes- 
 toft, reports the August 29 issue of The Fishing News , a British trade magazine. The 
 proposed orders are under consideration by the Board of Trade, said an official of the 
 Board "because it is always a feasible argument that fishing trawlers could be con- 
 verted to minesweepers. "
