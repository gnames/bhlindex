October 1953 COMMERCIAL FISHERIES REVIEW 63 

This statement followed questions sent to the President of the Board of Trade by 
 a member of Parliament who said he was told by the Aberdeen Trades and Labour 
 Council that the Russian Government had made approaches "to a number of British 
 shipbuilding firms with a view to placing large orders for building trawlers and fish 
 factoryships. " He asked whether it was true that difficulties had been placed in the 
 way of acceptance. He urged the Minister to take steps to remove such difficulties 
 "in the interests of international trade and employment in British shipbuilding yards." 

Later information indicates that 40 trawlers and fish factoryships worth about 
 L8, 000, 000 (US$22, 400, 000) are involved. Russia needs these vessels to develop its 
 fishing industry. A British Admiralty committee is considering whether the vessels 
 could be converted into minesweepers; the availability of steel; and effect of the or- 
 ders on other vital shipbuilding.
