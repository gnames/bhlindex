HEARING ON PACIFIC OYSTER STANDARDS : A hearing to amend definitions and 
 standards of identity for raw Pacific oysters was held on October 21, 1953, in Washing- 
 ton, D. C. , and was announced in the September 18 Federal Register . The hearingwas 
 called by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, and held for the purpose of 
 receiving evidence on proposals of the Pacific Coast Oyster Growers Association to a- 
 mend the standards of identity for Pacific oysters. Evidence was restricted to testi- 
 mony and exhibits relevant and material to the proposals. 

The proposals would amend Sections 36. 17 to 36.20, inclusive, of the regulations, 
 which fixed and established definitions and standards of identity for raw Pacific oysters. 
 As amended the section would provide that: 

1. Large Pacific oysters, large raw Pacific oysters, large shucked 
 Pacific oysters, are of the species Ostrea gigas and conform to the defini- 
 tions and standards of identity prescribed for oysters by Sections36. 10 and 
 are of such size that 1 gallon contains not more than 64 oysters, and the 
 largest oyster in the container is not more than twice the weight of the small- 
 est oyster therein. 

2. Medium Pacific oysters. . . and are of such size that 1 gallon con- 
 tains more than 64 oysters and not more than 96 oysters, and the largest oys- 
 ter in the container is not more than twice the weight of the smallest oyster 
 therein. 

3. Small Pacific oysters. . . and are of such size that 1 gallon con- 
 tains more than 96 oysters and not more than 144 oysters, and the largest 
 oyster in the container is not more than twice the weight of the smallest 
 oyster therein. 

4. Extra small Pacific oysters. . . and are of such size that 1 gallon 
 contains more than 144 oysters, and the largest oyster in the container is 
 not more than twice the weight of the smallest oyster therein. 

The proposed amendments for consideration at the hearing are subject to adoption, 
 rejection, or modification by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, in whole 
 or in part, as the evidence adduced at the hearing may require.
