"Changes in the Commercial Fishery on the Alabama 
 Fortion of the Tennessee River," by Paul Bryan 
 and Lawrence F. Miller, article, pp. 75-77. 
 (From The Progressive Fish Culturist . vol. 15, 
 no. 2, April 1953, processed, annual subscrip- 
 tion $1.25 domestic, US$1.65 foreign.) Describes 
 the commercial fishery of the Alabama portion 
 of the Tennessee River; early post-impoundment 
 fishing, 1936-45; later post-impoundment fish- 
 ing, 1945-52; rebirth of the mussel industry; 
 and discusses the present trends in relation to 
 the sport fishery. Statistical data show the 
 commercial fish catch for Guntersville , Wheeler, 
 Wilson, and Pickwick Reservoirs from 1943 to 
 1952. Also includes statistical data on the 
 annual harvest of mussel shells in north Ala- 
 bama Tennessee Valley reservoirs for the years 
 1945 to 1951. 

Dingell-Johnson Quarterly (For the Period July 1, 
 1951, to June 30, 1952), vol. 1, July 1953, 79 
 p., processed. This is the first of a series 
 of publications reporting on the Federal Aid in 
 Fish Restoration program which is designed to 
 help the states solve their sport-fishery prob- 
 lems. Achievements of general interest are pre- 
 sented for the first year of the program from 
 investigations, development, and land and water 
 acquisition projects. Federal Aid in Fish Res- 

toration became a reality with the passage by Con- 
 gress and approval by the President of the Federal 
 Aid in Fish Restoration Act, August 9, 1950 (64 
 Stat. 430). The achievement of this goal was the 
 result of many years of effort and planning on the 
 part of conservationists who envisioned a program 
 designed to benefit sport fishing in the same way 
 that the Pittman-Robertson program has benefited 
 wildlife restoration. In substance, the above Act 
 makes the 10-percent Federal excise tax collected 
 on sport-fishing equipment available for apportion- 
 ment to the states and territories annually under 
 the general administration of the U. S. Fish and 
 Wildlife Service. The states are responsible for 
 the selection, design, and execution of projects, 
 and expend their own funds for project operation. 
 Upon presenting evidence of satisfactory progress 
 or completion, the state is reimbursed to a maxi- 
 mum of 75 percent of costs incurred. Federal Aid 
 in Fish Restoration is designed to supplement rath- 
 er than supplant the usual state sport-fisheries 
 program.
