Presents the results of the first complete sta- 
 tistical survey made of the United States and 
 Alaska fishery industry since 1931. Previous 
 complete surveys of the U.S. fisheries were 
 made only in 1908 and 1931. In recent years 
 canvasses of the fisheries of most sections of 
 the country were made annually. However, no 
 data on the fisheries of the Mississippi Rivef 
 area were assembled since 1931, and since 1940 
 only partial surveys were made of the fisheries 
 of the Great Lakes, South Atlantic, and Gulf 
 States. This sourcebook is the latest in a se- 
 ries of annual statistical reports which contain 
 data on the catch of fishery products and its 
 value, employment in the fisheries, quantity of 
 gear operated, and the number of fishing craft 
 employed in the capture of fishery products. 
 Information on the quantity and value of the pro- 
 duction of manufactured fisher;- products and by- 
 products i3 also shown. For the first time since 
 1945, data on the catch and operating units by 
 counties are shown for the entire Atlantic and 
 Gulf coastal areas, except Maryland. Where a- 
 vailable, summary information from 1880 — when 
 the first comprehensive statistical survey of 
 the fisheries and fishery industries of the Unit- 
 ed States was made— to date is included. Out- 
 standing developments during 1950 were the re- 
 cord landings of tuna and tuna-like fishes; the 
 continued high production of menhaden; and the 
 expansion of the shrimp fishery in the Gulf area. 
 A total of 161,463 fishermen, 11,496 vessels of 
 5 net tons capacity or greater, and 80,814 boats 
 were employed in the commercial fisheries of tha 
 United States and Alaska in 1950. During this 
 year the catch of fishery products in all sec- 
 tions of the United States and Alaska totaled 
 4,884,909,000 pounds, valued at $343,876,000 to 
 the fishermen. This was an increase of 2 per- 
 cent in quantity and 1 percent in value compared 
 with the partially estimated production of 1949. 
 The average price of all fish to the fishermen 
 decreased 3lightly from 1949 to 1950, although 
 the values were generally variable and the prises 
 of some species increased. San Pedro, Calif., 
 continued to be the Nation's leading fishing 
 port, both in quantity and value with landings 
 of approximately 940 million pounds, valued at 
 $43.5 million to the fishermen. Gloucester, 
 Mass., was in second place, with approximately 
 196 million pounds , followed by San Diego, Calif. , 
 with approximately 190 million pounds. The per- 
 capita consumption of fishery products in the 
 U. S. in 1950 totaled 11.5 pounds, edible weight. 
 During the previous year the per-capita consump- 
 tion was 11.4 pounds. This was considerably 
 above the wartime level of approximately 9 pounds 
 when a large portion of the canned pack was al- 
 located to the Armed Forces and to lend-lease 
 distribution. The 1935-39 average was 11.1 
 pounds. Fishery statistics of the U.S. and 

Alaska are compiled and published annually to 
 make available information on both the economic 
 and biological aspects of the domestic commer- 
 cial fisheries.

Spawning of Yellowfin Tuna in Hawaiian Waters, by 
 Fred C. June', Fishery Bulletin 77 (From Fishery 
 Bulletin of the Fish and Wildlife Service, Vol- 
 ume 54), 21 p., illus., printed, 15 cents, 1953. 
 This paper deals with the spawning of the yellow- 
 fin tuna ( Neothunnus macro uterus ) in Hawaiian wa- 
 ters, with particular reference to the reproduc- 
 tive process. Frequency distributions of the di- 
 ameters of ova from 112 yellowfin tuna, captured 
 by long-line gear in Hawaiian waters during 1950, 
 demonstrate that several developmental groups of 
 ova are' present in the ovaries of this species 
 during the breeding season. Based on the position 
 of the mode of the most mature group of ova pres- 
 ent in the ovaries, 11 arbitrary stages of matu- 
 rity are defined which trace the development of 
 the ova from the immature or resting stage through 
 the spawning stage. A simple ovary-weight to 
 fish-weight relation is given whereby spawning 
 and, nonspawning fish may be distinguished without 
 laborious ova-diameter measurements. Over the 
 size range of fish examined, 36.3 to 94.3 kilo- 
 grams (80 to 208 pounds), the ovary-weight to 
 fish-weight relation was found to be linear for 
 ovaries in the immature, or resting, stage and 
 in one of the maturing stages. However, the 
 slopes and levels of the two regressions were 
 significantly different. The calculated number 
 of ova produced at a single spawning by individ- 
 ual yellowfin tuna, over the size range 47.2 to 
 88 kilograms (104 to 194 pounds) , increased with 
 fish size and ranged from 2,370,000 to 8,590,000. 
 Spawning of the yellowfin tuna in Hawaiian waters 
 during 1950 took place between mid-May and the 
 end of October, and coincided with the period of 
 best long-line catches of the species.
