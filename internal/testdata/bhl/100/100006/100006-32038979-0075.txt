"The Future of Echo Detection," by R. E. Craig, 
 article, World Fishing , August 1953, vol. 2, no. 
 8, pp. 303-7, illus., printed, single copies 2s. 
 6d. (35 U. S. cents). John Trundell (Publish- 
 ers) Ltd., London, E. C. 4, England. Some of 
 the possibilities in the development of echo- 
 sounding apparatus are surveyed in this article. 
 The effectiveness of frequencies rather higher 
 than those used in the British commercial fish- 
 eries, means of increasing the signal to noise 
 ratio, method of presentation of paper recording, 
 and methods of counting oscillators horizontally 
 for fish finding are discussed. 

The Gulf of Mexico Sponge Investigation , by Charles 
 E. Dawson, Jr., and F. G. Walton Smith, Techni- 
 cal Series No. 1, 28 p., illus., printed. Marine 
 Laboratory, University of Miami, Coral Gables 34, 
 Florida, 1953. Report on a survey of the Florida 
 commercial sponge beds from Dry Tortugas to Pana- 
 ma City during 1947 and 1948. Studies were made 
 of the oceanographic conditions and fauna at 38 
 stations. No commercial sponges were found in 

depths over 10 fathoms. Commercial sponges were 
 found at 12 stations in depths between 3 and 10 
 fathoms . Abnormal biological conditions were ob- 
 served at only one station. Although evidences 
 of recent damage to individual commercial sponges 
 were noted at several locations, no recurrence of 
 the 1939 sponge disease was indicated. Oceanogra- 
 phic conditions were generally within the range 
 common to inshore Gulf of Mexico waters, and at no 
 station did they deviate sufficiently to be con- 
 sidered detrimental to the bottom-living organisms. 
 Few sponges of commercial size were found at any 
 locality, and the scarcity of small commercial 
 sponges precludes the early recovery of the Flor- 
 ida sponge industry. The authors point out that 
 since 1948 the number of diving boats working the 
 Florida sponge beds has steadily declined. A re- 
 cent inquiry at Tarpon Springs showed that there 
 are now fewer than 20 diving boats operating full 
 time in the Florida sponge fishery. This situa- 
 tion will prove beneficial and hasten the recovery 
 of the beds, state the authors. The reduction in 
 fishing intensity will permit the remaining sponges 
 to reach maximum size. In conjunction with this 
 effect, a widespread seeding of the depleted grounds 
 with small sponges is to be expected. Assuming 
 that there is no further mass mortality, this new 
 growth of sponge should be available for commercial 
 exploitation in fran 7 to 8 years. The authors re- 
 commend that the State of Florida enact legisla- 
 tion and establish sound procedures for the strict 
 enforcement of the five-inch minimum size limit.
