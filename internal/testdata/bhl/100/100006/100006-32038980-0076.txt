habits of seals on commercial fisheries . On the 
 Skeena River, British Columbia, Canada, it has 
 been estimated that a seal population of 450 de- 
 troyed approximately 10 pounds of fish each daily — 
 a serious threat to the salmon fishery there — 
 while salmon fishermen at Whitby, England, have 
 been given permission to destroy seals which, 
 it is claimed, are wreaking havoc with their 
 livelihood. This article deals with the rela- 
 tion between seals and the commercial fisheries 
 in various parts of the world, and describes the 
 four British seals . 

Refrigeration in America by Oscar Edward Anderson, 
 Jr., 355 p., printed, illus., $6.00. Princeton 
 University Press, Princeton, N. J., for Univer- 
 sity of Cincinnati, 1953. The subtitle "A His- 
 tory of a New Technology and Its Impact" is an 
 accurate summary of the book. There is compiled 
 an exhaustively detailed and referenced account 
 of refrigeration both from ice and mechanical 
 equipment. Beginning with the harvest and use 
 of natural ice, the author traces its applica- 
 tion to food preservation in the United States. 
 Mechanical refrigeration is likewise followed 
 through the early developmental period and into 
 the subsequent applications. Some of the other 
 fields covered in the book include the ice in- 
 dustry and domestic refrigeration, refrigerated 
 transport, the cold-storage plant's struggle to 
 attain recognition, impact of refrigeration on 
 food supplies and habits, heme and locker-plant 
 applications, and miscellaneous other industrial 
 applications. The bibliographical note is an 
 excellent resume of recommended sources for in- 
 formation on the many fields of research and 
 development that have contributed to the advance 
 of refrigeration to its present importance in 
 the United States. The extensive footnotes are 
 very worthwhile to further highlight the points 
 made in the text.

"Status of the Fishery for Sea Mullet ( Kugil cepha- 
 lus Linnaeus) in Eastern Australia," by J. M. 
 Thomson, article. Australian Journal of Marine 
 and Freshwater Research , May 1953, vol. 4, no. 
 1, pp. 41-81, illus., printed, 7s. 6d. per issue 
 (US41.05). Commonwealth Scientific and Indus- 
 trial Research Organization, 314 Albert Street, 
 East Melbourne, C. 2, Victoria, Australia. Var- 
 ious shortcomings of the statistical systems in 
 vogue in the fisheries of the eastern States of 
 Australia are discussed from the viewpoint of a 
 biologist. It is impossible to compute an esti- 
 mate of the catch per-unit-of -effort involving 
 a time factor. The annual mullet catch for the 
 whole eastern seaboard has remained substantial- 
 lyabout 11,000,000 pounds for the past lOyears, 
 but the total caught in any subdivision of the 
 area has fluctuated widely. The Clarence River, 
 Fort Kacquarie, Maryborough, and Wallis Lake 

areas are the most important producers. There 
 is a high degree of correlation between the fluc- 
 tuations in the mullet catch and those in the 
 total catch of estuarine fish. The size and age 
 composition of the mullet catch have shown only 
 slight variation over the last 10 years, and 
 there is no significant variation in this re- 
 spect from the composition in 1903. The fluc- 
 tuations in catch and catch per man are not incon- 
 sistent with theories of overfishing nor with those 
 of natural population cycles ; but the only theory 
 which receives confirmation independently of the 
 curves of catch and of catch per man is an econom- 
 ic one. Competition from both the trawling indus- 
 try and the import industry has been responsible 
 for the characteristics of the estuarine catch 
 curves. It is estimated that the weight of meat 
 to be gained from recent changes in the management 
 of the fishery could at best be considerabley less 
 than the amount of annual variation in the catch. 

(United Kingdom) Herring Industry Board . Eighteenth 
 Annual Report for the Year Ended 31st December 
 1952 , Cmd. 8840, 41 p., printed, Is. 6d. net (21 
 U.S. cents). Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 
 London, England, 1952. A report of the British 
 herring fisheries, with data on marketing, re- 
 search and development, and the herring fleet. A 
 discussion of the commercial and statutory arrange- 
 ments between or concerning the Herring Industry 
 Board, the catchers, and the shore-based sections 
 of the industry is presented. The statistical 
 tables in this report cover total catch, utiliza- 
 tion, exports, and prices of herring. The market- 
 ing problem and the program for constructing re- 
 duction factories are also discussed. 

"Use of Chilled Sea Water in Place of Ice in Trans- 
 porting Fish," by A. W. Lantz, article, Progres s 
 Reports of the Pacific Coast Stations , No. 95, 
 July 1953, pp. 39-44, illus., processed. Fisheries 
 Research Board of Canada, Pacific Fisheries Exper- 
 imental Station, Vancouver 2, B. C. Describes a 
 study which involves the mechanical chilling of 
 sea water in a fish storage tank and maintaining 
 the. water at 29°F.to30°F. for transporting fish 
 aboard a fishing vessel. An illustration shows 
 one proposed application of this system for the 
 hold of a troller vessel, using eutectic plates 
 spaced to provide chilled sea water in each of six 
 compartments. These compartments or sections re- 
 place the fish pens in conventional fish-hold con- 
 struction. An outstanding feature of the system 
 is that it can be installed in wooden fishing craft 
 without insulating the hull. It also eliminates 
 the carrying and handling of ice, thus reducing 
 operating and labor costs. Another illustration 
 shows a further modification of this system in 
 which the supporting walls or lateral bulkheads 
 replace the eutectic plates; a bank of refrigerat- 
 ing coils is placed at one end and circulation of 
 the sea water is obtained by a pumping system. The 
 equipment can be adapted to any type of boat.
