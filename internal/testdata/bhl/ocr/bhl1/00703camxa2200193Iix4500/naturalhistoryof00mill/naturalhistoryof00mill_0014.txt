VI PREFACE. 

such an undertaking, and one which, if less consistent with its beauty 
 as a work of art, might yet, it was observed, bestow an additional 
 degree of fidelity and precision on its anatomical details. 

I did follow this advice, and it is to the kind exertions of the same 
 friends that I stand chiefly indebted for the highly respectable list of 
 Subscribers Avho have sanctioned this work by their patronage. Great, 
 however, as is the encouragement I have derived from this circum- 
 stance, I still feel how much I must require the indulgence of the 
 Public, in venturing to appear before it as anauthor and an artist, and 
 especially on a subject so imperfectly understood as the present. 

I trust, however, that I may fairly consider myself as having 
 pointed out characters which throw a new and not ununportant light 
 on the class of beings under consideration, which mark with precision 
 the natural arrangements of their Genera and Species, and ilkistrate 
 many of the most essential features of their organic structure ; and 
 since the elucidations hence resulting, offer in many and material 
 instances new analogies, which may be usefully applied to the inves- 
 tigation of the other families of that important and hitherto imperfecly 
 understood natural division, the radiated Echinodermata, I am 
 willing to flatter myself that my researches may be considered as 
 adding a useful, though humble, contribution to the now rapidly 
 increasing stock of accurate Zoological knowledge. 

Since the progress of these inquiries had brought to light numerous 
 â–ºSpecies hitherto unknown or incorrectly ascertained, it became 
 necessary to adopt, in part at least, a new nomenclature ; from this 
 consideration, and not liom any desire of capricious innovation, 
 which must, wherever it is superfluous, prove also detrimental to 
 science, 1 have suffered myself to be swayed in this subject. 

In the nomenclature I iiave thus proposed, I have therefore 
 retained the old and iamiliar derivation of the classic name from the
