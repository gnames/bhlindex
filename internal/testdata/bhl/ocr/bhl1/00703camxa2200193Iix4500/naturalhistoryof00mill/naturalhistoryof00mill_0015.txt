PREFACE. VII 

Greek kpinos, a lily ; prefixing for the name of each genus another 
 descriptive term from the same language ; thus hoping to produce an 
 association of ideas which a simple generic appellation could not 
 have conveyed, and which might become more readily impressed on 
 the memory of the student. 

I still, however, regret that it was not possible for me to avail 
 myself of the very appropriate name Stylastritae (from sttaos, a 
 column, and aztpon, a star, i. e. a stellated animal, supported on a 
 column) proposed by Mr. Martin (the author of a work on the 
 fossils of Derbyshire) in his outlines on the knowledge of extraneous 
 fossils. This name happily describes not only the general resemblance, 
 but also the place which this family should occupy in the natural 
 arrangement of organized beings ; but being a compound term, would 
 not have conveniently entered into any further combinations, and 
 therefore would have failed in the object above specified. I cannot 
 however pass it over without notice. 

I have avoided imposing names on imperfect fragments which did 
 not yield a clearly distinct specific character, since this would only 
 have uselessly swelled the already voluminous nomenclature of 
 natural history. 

The anatomical descriptions are, in every instance, drawn up from 
 actual and minute examination ; and it has been highly satisfactory 
 to me, to have been able to verify and confirm the results obtained 
 from the examination of fossil species, by comparison with the recent 
 Pentacrinus, and to have found myself materially assisted by the 
 analogies thus afforded, in investigating the allied genera Marsupites 
 and Comatula. 

As a native of the once free Hanseatic town of Dantzig, I felt 
 myself long embarrassed by that imperfect knowledge of the peculiar 
 idiomatic forms of English composition, which must be supposed
