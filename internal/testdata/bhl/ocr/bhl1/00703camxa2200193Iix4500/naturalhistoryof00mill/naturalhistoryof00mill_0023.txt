the order as laid down by hina, 'â€¢ Many Polypi united to an elongated free 
 fleshy living body, containing an inorganic axis" does not apply to the genus 
 Encrinus, and the definition he gives of this genus itself is also erroneous, 
 in stating that " The branches forming the umbel are filled with Polypi in 
 rows." These errors of M. Lamarck's are omitted in M. Cuvier's Regne 
 Animal, where, however, he gives no new generic character, but only places 
 the genus Enckinus after the Asterle, in the division Zoophytes, class 
 EcNiNODERMEs and order Pedicelles. I must acknowledge I do not know 
 why M. Cuvieb should have suppressed the name Vermes applied by 
 LiNN^us to the sixth class of animals, and preferred the term ZoopHyxEs, 
 adding " Ou Animaux Rayonnes," the Greek word so translated means 
 Plantlike Animals. The Swedish Naturalist used it, I think with propriety^ 
 to denominate his fourth order of Vermes containing the Polypi of Lamarck, 
 because their own figure and that of their Polyparia bore a great resemblance 
 to plants; but I cannot see the reason why it should be thus extended to 
 designate a division containing the Echini, Intestinal wokms, Infusoria, &c.
