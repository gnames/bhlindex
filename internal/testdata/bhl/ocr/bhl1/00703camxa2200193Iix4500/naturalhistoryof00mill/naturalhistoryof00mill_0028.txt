This last quality may account for the enlargement of the alimentary canal in the 
 cokinms of the Actinocrinites, Cyathocrinites, &c. as the animal increased 
 in size. 

On the summit of the column are placed series of ossicula, which, from 
 their position and uses may be termed the pelvis, scaputa, costal, and inter- 
 costal joints or plates, varying in tlieir number, and partly wanting in some 
 genera. These form (with the pectoral and capital plates) a kind of subglo- 
 bnlar body, having the mouth in its centre, and containing the viscera and 
 stomach of the animal, from which the nourishing fluids are admitted through 
 a sphincter muscle to the alimentary canal in the column, and also carried to 
 the arms and tentaculated fingers. 

These ossicula, w hen possessing a short and thick figure, and connected by 
 regular articulating surfaces, as in Apiocrinites, or occasionally perhaps, an- 
 chylosing together, as in Eugeniacrinites, I have denominated joints; when 
 they assume a thinner and flatter form, and adhere only by sutures, lined by the 
 muscular integument, as in Actinocrimtes, I have termed them plates. 

The diflerence of these modes of structure have enabled me (o form four 
 divisions of the family of Crinoidea ; and as the number of plates or joints on 
 which the scapula rests, as also the number of fingers and arrangement of 
 linger bones varies, tliese, with the shape of the column, offer good characters 
 to foini genera and determine species. 

The food of the Crinoidea we may conjecture to have consisted in animals 
 !ess solid than themselres, probably infusoria, polypi, medussE,&c. Thisintleed 
 is rendered more certain by their possessing in their numerous tentaculated 
 fingers, such an admirable net-like apparatus for the detention of minute sub- 
 stances, since it is a rule in nature to suit always in its organic formations 
 the mechanism to the wants. The small mouth capable of elongating into a 
 kind of proboscis, also aids in confirming this conjecture. 

I apprehend that the Crinoidea propagated by eggs only, their complicated 
 organic construction (so widely differing from that of the SxELLERiDiE} not per- 
 mitting increase by separation of parts of the animal, or by buds, as is said to 
 be the case in Polypi, whose young are said to push forth from the sides of the 
 gelatinous contractile body. The inference drawn from this alleged f\ict,
