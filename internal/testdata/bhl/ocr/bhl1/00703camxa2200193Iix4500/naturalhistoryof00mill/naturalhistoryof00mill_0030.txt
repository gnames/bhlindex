Division and Classijication of the Crinoidea. 

In the proposed arrangements of the members of this family tliey will be 
 classed under four principal divisions, comprising altogether nine genern, each 
 containing several species, as p articularized in the annexed table. 

It is almost unnecessary to observe that a previous perusal of the detailed 
 account of the genera and species will be requisite, in order to furnish a clear 
 understanding of the synoptical and abridged view of their characters pre- 
 sented in the following table. The employment of letters of the same type, 
 and references of the same figure, to denote in every instance the characters 
 taken from the same parts, proceeds exactly upon the plan adopted by M. 
 Lamarck, and will be at once understood by those familiar with his mode of 
 arrangement.
