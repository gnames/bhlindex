secure adhesion to extraneous bodies. We may thence conclude that here the 
 office of this laminar ring-like concretion, was to repair an injury sustained 
 by the column. 

The suPKRiOR ENLARGED COLUMNAR JOINT (T. IV. fi«. \3. and 19.) resem- 
 bles in its inferior surface those preceding it. but as its centre commands the 
 entrance to the alimentary canal, it is provided with a sphincter muscle capa- 
 ble of close contraction, as is proved by a specimen, perhaps unique, in my 
 possession, (T. iv. fig. 13. to 15.) where the folds produced by the action of 
 this muscle are distinctly seen. Its upper surface has five ridges diverging 
 from the centre, the space between which is, more or less, concave. The cir- 
 cumference of the superior margin is still somewhat greater than that of the 
 inferior, and the outer surface of the joint swells out in a trifling degree towards 
 the middle, being slightly contracted towards either margin. Sometimes the 
 upper surface of this joint is peculiarly convex (T. iv.lig 16. and 18.) in which 
 case, generally, both these margins appear much compressed ; this is evidently 
 a result of contraction, and an additional proof of the original unindurated state 
 of the exterior part of the joint. 

Before we proceed to examine in detail the separate pieces composing 
 the body, and completing together with the upper enlarged,(Columnar joints 
 just described, the pyriform shape that characterises the superior portion of 
 this animal, it will add much to the clearness of the ensuing description, to 
 state in a concise manner, although at the expense of some repetition, the ge- 
 neral form and relations of this part and its constituent members. (See the 
 plate illustrating generic characters j. 

In each of the four rows w hich succeed the upper enlarged columnar joint, 
 the circumference of the body becomes divided into five distinct and similar 
 joints; which although necessarily undergoing much subordinate variation of 
 figure, to fit them for their respective places and combinations, have yet many 
 general points of analogy in all these rows. They all have a wedge-shaped, or 
 rather truncated pyramidal form, being arranged round the central cavitv of the 
 body, like the blocks of masonry which compose the courses of a cupola, present- 
 mg their broader ends or bases towards the exterior circumference, their nar- 
 row end or truncated apex towards the interior. Hence, in descrihiiig these 
 joints, we have always six surfaces to take into consideration; the £XT£riou
