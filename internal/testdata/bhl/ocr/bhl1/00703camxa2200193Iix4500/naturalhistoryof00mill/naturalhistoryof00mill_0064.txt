thence into the funnel-shaped cavity. This has suggested to me the idea that 
 it might have led to an ovary having five ducts, somewhat similar to that of the 
 echinus. 

Externally the superior portions of this animal are frequently marked with 
 minute indentations (Pl. i. fig. 2.) the points of adhesion probably of the epider- 
 mis, or rather periosteum, which secreted their calcareous matter, la some in- 
 stances I believe I have detected traces of this epidermis in a fine overlaying 
 pelicle. 

If the periosteum of any single joint received an injury, the further secre- 
 tion in that part was discontinued, and the periosteum of the neighbouring 
 parts filled the vacancy thus occasioned ; this produced a wedge-like interpo- 
 sition and deformity of the joints of the column, which thereby appear as 
 if formed of several parts ; a similar distortion of the pelvis, &c. â€” Pl. vii. 
 fig. l.to6. 8. to 10. 

Although the whole skeleton of the animal is now changed into calcareous 
 spar, still, as has been observed, the diflerence of colour not unfrequently points 
 out the gradual formation of its various parts: hence we may, perhaps, reason- 
 ably conclude that the original colouring matter has been retained through all 
 the changes the substance underwent. In fine specimens this is a beautiful dark 
 purple, varying in a most elegant manner into a pale red purple, and to a more 
 or less dark gray, as may more particularly be seen in sections of the base. 

These colours, however, appear only to have been retained in those speci- 
 mens which either were, or had very recently been, living at the period of their 
 becoming enveloped in the strata which now preserves them. Those wliich 
 had been at that period dead for some time, must have already from various 
 evident causes, lost much of the vividness of the original colours before they 
 were thus inhumed. This appears to me to have been the case with those 
 specimens which so frequently occur, having an uniform gray colour, becoming- 
 tinged by further decomposition with yellow, and gradually converted into a 
 kind of ochre. 

The calcareous particles which have filtered into the alimentary canal and 
 the various cavities between the joints (if these were free of extraneous matter) 
 often form there a nucleus of foliated spar, and sometimes occur as casts'
