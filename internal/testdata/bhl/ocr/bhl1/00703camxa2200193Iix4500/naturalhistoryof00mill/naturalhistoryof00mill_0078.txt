tinuation through a considerable length of the column, before it becomes eon- 
 fined to a more limited flexibility. 

From the fine specimen figured by Knorr, it is obvious that the animal 
 had no auxiliary side arms, and as the superior part is less ponderous tharh 
 that of Apiocrinites, we may easily account for its being sustained without 
 them on a longer column. 

The Base (Pl. i. fig. 2.) Rosinus Harrenberg, Walch, and Mr. Parkin- 
 son, suggest the idea that the animal was permanently afli.xed by exuded cal- 
 careous indurating secretions, and figure specimens found in the same places 
 where the lily-shaped superior portions of the animal occur. Although I have 
 not myself seen any of these bases, yet from these representations much resem- 
 bling the attaching laminar portion of Apiocrinites rotundus, I cannot hesitate in 
 admitting the accuracy of the observations of the authors above quoted. Hence 
 it is easy to explain the manner in which several of the encrini adhered together, 
 having early commenced life near each other, and become enclosed at the base 
 by the exuded calcareous matter as (hey grew up, yet without forming one 
 animal as Walch suggests. 

Superior Extremity. (Pl, ii.) This part in the number and disposition 
 of its jomts, presents many general analogies to the corresponding portions in 
 the preceding genus Apiocrinites which have been already largely described, yet 
 with consideralile suhoidinate variations of form, priucipally arising from the 
 upper joints of the column continuing of the same size with the lower, and the 
 consequent narrow area occupied by the pelvis, which in this species forms the 
 commencement of the swelling part, exhibiting a calix-like figure; hence the 
 contiguous parts are obliged to undergo such modification as may accommodate 
 them to this figure. 

The First Columnar Joint (Pl. hi. fig. I.) is of a pentangular form, and 
 one of those of larger dimensions which alternate in tiie superior part of the 
 column it articulates, by its striated exterior rim, like the other joints, and has 
 in its centre the pentapetalous entrance to the alimentary canal probably 
 guarded by a sphincter muscle. 

The Pelvis (Pl. hi. tig. 2. to 4.) is formed of five depressed rhombic joints,
