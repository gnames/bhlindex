cimens, in which, if finely preserved, the muscular ])lica! of the external 
 integument may frequently be traced, extending over the former, this, and the 
 following joints. At its inner truncated point it has an elegant lip-like pro- 
 cess, similar to that noticed on the former joints, the plicae of both assuming 
 a perfectly conformable disposition, it has at its lower surface the transverse 
 perforated ridge, which also appears to exist at its superior surface. How- 
 ever, this last fact I can only advance hesitatingly on the appearance of a single 
 specimen, and beg to observe, that it does not accord with the organization 
 noticed in the Apiocrinites rotund us, to which I have found (speaking in general 
 terms) the present species strictly conformable in this point. 

The scapulse (Pl. hi. fig. 9. to 11.) rest on the subconcave surfaces of the 
 second costals, and being destined to support a row in w hich the division of 
 pieces is doubled, the upper surface is forn)ed into an angular ridge, and the 
 lateral surfaces, in old specimens, are scarcely perceptible; so that in the ex- 
 terior circumference the margin of each joint is nearly triangular. At the in- 
 terior truncated point it is excavated, having in the centre a projecting pointed 
 process, on each side of which another excavation exists, behind which the sub- 
 triangular perforated ridge is placed in a slanting transverse direction. At 
 the lower surface a ridge also exists of a subtriangular figure, all the 
 angles are drawn in, and hence the joint has here again a convex form. The 
 scapulse evidently have lost all their analogy to the Apiocrinites, and point out 
 clearly in their formation a transition of organization to the next genus. 

On the five scapulas rest the ten first arm joints (Pl. ii. 1. and 2.) two of 
 them articulating to each scapula, viz. one on either slope of its superior angular 
 ridge, the outer circumference of each arm joint terms a parallelogram con- 
 tracted and drawn in at the angles, and hence has not unfrequently in young 
 specimens a tubercular elevation. 

To the first arm jcjint succeed several thinner joints, externally oblong, 
 straight on the lateral surfaces, and nearly flat on the upper and lower surfaces; 
 they are of a horse-shoe shape, and provided with tcntacula on alternate sides. 
 Their number varies from six to eight, according to the age of the individual. 

The following joints which 1 should feel inclined to call those of the 
 FiNGEus (Pl. II. fig. 1.) have sloping surfaces, and thin oil' on the opposite
