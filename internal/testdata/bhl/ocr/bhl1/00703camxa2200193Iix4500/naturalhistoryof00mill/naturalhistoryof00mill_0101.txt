rise to a further subdivision. Tins I shall call the first cuneiform joint of the 
 hand, designating the lateral branch which proceeds from it, as tlie first fino-er, 
 and the continuation of the main series of joints, as the second series of the hand 
 joints. This second series, consisting of abo\it twelve joints, terminates by a 
 cuneiform joint (the second cuneiform joint of the hand) which gives rise to the 
 second and third finger. Each of the fingers with its tentacula, bears a close 
 resemblance to the vane of a quill, becoming at its superior extreiuitj highly 
 muscular. 

The Joints of the Hand and Fingers e.xactly resemble those of the arms, 
 only that they become gradually smaller as they approach to (he point of the 
 fingers, and send off, like them, tentacula from the alternate sides. 

The Tentacula. (Pl. ii. fig. 5. to 7. and 23) The tentacular series of 
 the arms, hands, and fingers, near the cuneiform joints in full grown specimens, 
 consist of about twenty joints gradually tapering to a point, but decreasing in 
 number and size near the apex of the finger, where they are formed of only one 
 or two joints terminating in muscular undeveloped points; proofs of their con- 
 tinuing growth through the whole life of the animal, and of their possessing a 
 greater power of action at these extremities. The joints of the tentacula are 
 nearly horse-shoe shaped, having the side where their series folds upwards 
 somewhat compressed, and less protruding. 

The circumference of each tentacular joint, but particularly of those to- 
 wards the point of a series (Pl. ii. fig. 5. and 25 ) is smaller, or contracted 
 near the base; an admirable contrivance to assist motion, and also contributing 
 much to give this part of the animal an elegant and finished appearance. The 
 articulating surfaces present transverse ridges, pierced in the centre by the 
 canal of the nourishing vessel. 

The Plated Integument. (Pl. ii. fig. 8. and 9.) The sides of the second 
 costal joints and scapulae are tied together by an integument, strengthened and 
 jjrotected externally by immerous calcareous angular plates, which extend over 
 the funnel-shaped abdominal cavity, having in its centre, probably, the minute 
 aperture forming the mouth, which in the present shrivelled state of this part 
 in the late Mr. Tobin's specimen, it was impossible to ascertain. When 
 the animal was alive, this integument, probably, was capable of having its cen- 
 tral part elongated and protruded by the action of its muscles, so as to form ^
