sort of proboscis for the sucking in of food. It spreads over the snicated part 
 of the arms, hands, fingers, and tentacnhi, conceahng under it nourishing ves- 
 sels, which may be sometimes traced spread in;^ into the muscular integuments 
 between the fingers. The arrangement of its calcareous plates is peculiarly 
 elegant in the tentacula (Pl. ii, fig. 6. and 7.) where they form two series an- 
 gularly pointed at their inuer edge, thus producing a serrated line of insertion 
 tetween each other. Their minuteness may be conceived from the observation, 
 that from ten to twelve are necessary to cover the excavated canal of a single 
 tentacular joint, which, taking the amount of these, would require about 200 
 plates for each full grown tentaculum. 

I have in vain endeavoured to trace apertures at the terminating points of the 
 fingers and tentacula, although Gue takd alleges, that here orifices existed serv- 
 ing as mouths to the animal for the taking in its food. It appears probable to me 
 that from this assertion M. Lamarck derived his generic character of En- 
 CRiNus. " The branches forming the umbel are filled with polypi in rows," 

The late Mr. Tobin's specimen, is in another point highly instructive. 
 The animal must have suffered material mutilation previously to its having been 
 taken from its marine abode, and hence affords a striking illustration of its 
 power of reproducing lost parts, to which I alluded when speaking of the auxi- 
 liary arms ; the most surprising instance of this, is, that the animal has rejiro- 
 duced from one of the scapula two new arms (Pl, i.) each having its two hands 
 and six fingers, but as yet not an eighth part the size of the full grown ones. 
 They are highly muscular, and prove the gradual developement and formation 
 of the calcareous joints in the manner which I have endeavoured to explain, 
 when speaking of the superior portion of the column and the formation of the 
 auxiliary side arms. The pointed termination of the fingers is coiled, which 
 demonstrates the greater sensibility and flexibility of this part during the life of 
 the animal. The new formed arms protrude from near the inner concave or 
 channelled margin of the scapula over the central perforation, leaving the 
 rest of its slanting surface covered by a conspicuous yellow brown epidermis. 
 In a few other instances, new formed fingers proceed from the cuneiform joints 
 in different stages of growth, sometimes almost assimilating in size with those 
 whose place they now supply. In one case two joints of a finder have been 
 broken transversely on one side, tlieir parts somewhat displaced, anil the frac- 
 turehealed by new secreted matter. The eflecls of an injury sustained by tiie 
 investing membrane of the column, and the consequent irregularity of the
