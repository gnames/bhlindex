column, an auxiliary side arm proceeds, formed of numerous minute round 
 joints, depressed above and below. These side arms lia\ e, probably, a greater 
 number of columnar joints ititervening, the furtlies' they are distant from the 
 )elvis. Their points of insertion are not disposed as in the precedinj>' species, 
 directly over each other, but alternately approach the opposite sides of the 
 space between the angles, so as to form a double series. One or two colum- 
 nar joints above each point of insertion is grooved, for the purpose of admit- 
 ting a closer adhesion of the side arms to the column, when the animal is in 
 a state of contraction or rest. 

In the P. Caput Medusa, the round side arms near the pelvis are short, 
 aud as they lengthen, the distance between the series increases, there')y allow- 
 ing free motion without any other provision. In P. Briareus, they are very 
 numerous and long, but in order that thej may divide tlie space correctly with- 
 out infringing on the column or creating confusion, they are Iozen;^o-shape(l ; 
 therefore when folding around it by packing together with the flattened sides 
 towards each other, many will go in a small circumference, and when extended, 
 the longest diameter of the lozenge being horizontal, a greater surf ice lor the 
 purpose of detention is produced. In the present species they are again routid, 
 but in more frequent series than in P. Caput Medusae ; hence theii arrangement 
 in double rows, becomes necessary, and as they occupy more room, and intrude 
 on the angles of the colunmar joints, the provision of a groove in tliose over them, 
 as noticed above, becomes necoisary to enable them to adhere closely to the 
 column when contracted. 

In a fine specimen of the superior portion of this animal, of an apparently 
 nearly full grown size, which I have had opportunity to examine, the first 
 COSTAL JOINTS (Pl. I.) are acutely angular, and do not overlay so many of the 
 subjacent columnar joints. 

The arms and hands resemble those of the former species, but the fentacula 
 set off rather diflerently. The first joint of each tentaiuliim is not only (as in 
 the former species) received into a depression of the finger jt)int above that 
 from which it proceeds, but also occasions a depression in the base of the third 
 finger joint above it, and from the upper part of which again another tentacuUmi 
 proceeds, thus producing a scale-like overlaying appearance. As stated be- 
 fore, the specimen from which my observation is taken, deuionstrates consiiier- 
 able maturity ot growth, and hence shows throughout a close strucluj-e, and
