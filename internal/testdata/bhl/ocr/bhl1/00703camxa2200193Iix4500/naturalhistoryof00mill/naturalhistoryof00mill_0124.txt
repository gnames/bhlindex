CRINOIDEA SEMIARTICULATA. 

Character of the Division. 

J. HE plate-like joints resting on the superior columnar joints and forming 
 the cup containing the viscera, articulate by transverse processes, having a mi- 
 nute central perforation. 

Observation. 

Although I am acquainted with but one species strictly possessing the cha- 
 racter assigned to it (viz. that which serves me as the type for the genus 
 Poteriocrinites) yet I thought it advisable to constitute the division Semiar- 
 TicuLATA, to mark in a more conspicuous manner the transition from regularly 
 articulating joints to plates adhering only by muscular sutures.
