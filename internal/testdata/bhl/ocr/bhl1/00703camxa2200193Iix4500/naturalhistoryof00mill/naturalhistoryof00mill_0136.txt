tion and articulation resembles the corresponding; joint of the Pentacrinites. 
 Its length, not unfrequently, exceeds its thickness six times, whence it bears a 
 distant resemblance to a split os humeri of a very small si/e. 

Finger Joint. â€” From its summit proceed the first joints of two fingers, 
 (fig. 24. and 25.) they are equally slender, adhering near the base laterally to 
 each other. On these the following finger joints (fig. 23. and 23.) are inserted 
 in single series, they are much excavated at the inner surface, and by the 
 alternately inclining angle of their superior surface, indicate that the tentacula 
 came off alternately from the broader portion of every joint. The specimen 
 in my possession does not display the tentacula, nor have I been able to trace 
 their place of insertion on the finger joints, but I apprehend that these being 
 so thin, and not ofiering a safe point of attachment, a muscular adhesion 
 existed in this species. I have also found minute plates indicating that the 
 cup-like abdominal cavity, and the excavated sulci in the arm and fingers 
 have been protected by a plated integument, similar to that noticed in other 
 Crinoidea.
