Description. 

The Column (Pl. ii. fig. 1. 18. to 20.) of this animal is formed of numer- 
 ous elliptical joints, which near the pelvis are of an almost round figure (Pl. ii. 
 fig. 1. to 3.) and are for some distance from it placed alternately, so that a 
 larger and thicker joint succeeds a smaller and thinner. The articulation of 
 the pelvis with the column in this species (Pl. ii. fig. 1. and 2.) affords an in- 
 teresting example of the manner in which the ordinary structure of the parts of 
 animals is changed, whenever the circumstances are such as to require a new 
 mechanism ; for tlie mode of articulation between the joints throughout the 
 rest of the column, is by means of a transverse ridge only, that mode 
 being most fitted for their elliptical form ; but since the upper columnar joint 
 has to support a pelvis composed of three pieces, which could not, from their 
 mode of construction, be affixed to a single ridge, this plan is here abandoned 
 and a new one introduced, which consists in the joint assuming a round figure, 
 having at its upper surface a margin marked with radiating striae, on which the 
 inferior striated surface:* of the three pelvis plates are applied in the usual man- 
 ner ; and the transverse ridge is here very faintly exhibited. Similar marginal 
 radii are seen, but more and more faintly, in several joints below (Pl. ii. fig. 3. 
 to 15.) and soon totally disappear, when the joints become of a true elliptical 
 form and thicker. The transverse ridge on the superior and that on the inferior 
 surface of the joint have (even when these are not thicker than a piece of writing 
 paper) a decided tendency to assume a direction oblique with respect to each 
 other, which is still more conspicuons when the joint is larger (Pl. ii. fig. 10. and 
 1 1.) This appcarince has led me to suppose, that in a living state the inferior 
 and superior surfaces of each joint with their articulating ridge, were alone truly 
 calcareous, having a yielding muscular or cartilaginous substance interposed 
 between them. In consequence of the adhesion ot the superior surface of each
