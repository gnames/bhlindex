Description. 

The Rev. Professor Buckland kindly allowed me to examine the Crinoidal 
 remains in the Ashmolean collection at Oxford, many of which once belonged 
 to Lluid. Among these I discovered the superior portion of this animal (fig. 
 1. and 2.) which I consider entitled to specific distinction; and although I am 
 well aware that the characters as above given, are scarcely sufficient to establish 
 this claim, yet I cannot doubt but that future researches will prove the correct- 
 ness of this suggestion.
