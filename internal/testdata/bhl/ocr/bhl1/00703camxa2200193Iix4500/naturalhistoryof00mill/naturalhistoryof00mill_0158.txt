nites, and hence the assertion that, species of that genus occur in mountain 
 and transition iinie-stone. But the absence of the pentapetalous seniistriated 
 articulation of the columnar joints, atid the different formation of the pelvis and 
 plates resting on it, must remove them at once from this class, and place 
 them in their respective genera. 

The Columnar Joints (fig. 8). are alternately thicker and thinner, but dif- 
 fer very little in their width from each other ; they are externally smooth, flat, 
 and acutely angular. At the articulating surface they are surrounded by a 
 striated margin slightly arched, inwardly enclosing a smooth area perforated in 
 the centre by a pentagonal canal, whose points extend to the intervening spaces 
 between the angles of tlie circumference. In some of these joints the sphinc- 
 terlike contraction of the muscle near the alimentary canal, its adhesion to the 
 points of the pentagon, and its connection with the joints next below it by longi- 
 tudinal fibres, has produced a five-fold depression. 

The Pelvis (fig. 3.) formed of three plates is cup-shaped, sustaining five 
 long scapulas (fig. 5.) each having a small horse-shoe-shaped depression at its 
 summit for the insertion of the arms. In one of my specimens (fig. 2. 6. and 7.) 
 the lateral sides of the scapulae bend in considerably, thereby producing an an- 
 gular indentation, and giving the sunnnit a stelliform figure. In tliis specimen 
 may be traced the plates belonging to the integument that covers the abdo- 
 minal cavity. 

An Arm (fig. 1.) proceeds from each of the scapula, formed of four horse- 
 shoe-shaped, and one cuneiform joint.
