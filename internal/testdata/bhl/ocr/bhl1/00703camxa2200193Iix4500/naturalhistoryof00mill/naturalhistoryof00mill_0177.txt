are directed to the space between them. The sphincter muscle, which pro- 
 bably exists near the canal, having points of adhesion at each of its five cor- 
 ners, sends off its dividing fibres across the smooth area to adhere to the stri- 
 ated rim, thereby effecting the movement of the column : hence the striae at the 
 outer margin do not incline to the centre. 

The Auxiliary Side Arms (fig. 3. and 8.) are formed of numerous round 
 joints, proceeding at irregular intervals from the spaces between the angles of 
 the larger joints. 

The Cup-like Portion (fig. 1.) on the summit of the column is formed by 
 plates resembling those of Cyathocrinites Planus, except that the lower sur- 
 face of the pelvis, where it articulates to the column, is somewhat pentagonal. 

The Five Arms are formed of one-arm joint and a cuneiform one, sup- 
 porting two hands, each composed of two joints, and a cuneiform one sending 
 off a finger, and probably also another series of the hand joints.
