characters. A simple contraction produces on every plate a nearly pointed star- 
 like figure, each ray being directed towards the sides. A partial contraction 
 extends the points of the rays, and a -very powerful one forms a continuation 
 of the rays of the star on one plate, extending with an equal thickness to 
 the adjoining plate. It is this degree of contraction which permits our tracing 
 the direction which the muscles pursue in acting on the arras and capital plates, 
 as may be fully seen in a fine specimen in my collection. (Pl. ii. fig. 1.) The 
 divided action from the tlnee adhering joints of the pelvis produces two folds, 
 directed to the centre of the first costal plates, (resting upon the lines of their 
 sutures); here it unites and proceeds over the second costal to the centre of the 
 scapula, where the muscle divides and attaches to the first joint of each hand. 
 Another fold extends laterally on each side from the centre of the first costals 
 across the intercostalsnear it, to the first fingers of the opposite arms, each again 
 dividing at the second intercostals, and sending branches to the pectoral plates. 
 Other rays decisively point out lateral action. Another specimen in my col- 
 lection, shows the ridges produced by contraction slightly waved, (Pl. ii. fig. 3.) 
 whilst a third specimen (Pl. ii. fig. 4.) exiiibits two or three ridges, according 
 as the costals traversed by them are inserted over the suture of the pelvis, or 
 over the middle of its plates, sending double folds to each of the two lateral 
 angles, and producing a corrugation in the centre of the costals. 

The Pectoral Plates (Pl. ii, fig. 7. to 14.) do not contract into a simple 
 tubercle, but form an elongation dividing at its summit into several points. 

The first Finger sets off from the outside of the cuneiform joints of the arm, 
 and the continuation of the hands consists of two or three series, each contain- 
 ing two common and one cuneiform joint, and terminating in tln-ee or four 
 fingers. 

The proboscis-like mouth, is capable of very considerable elongation, as is 
 shown in the fine specimen figured by Luwvd : b}' the obliging kindness of the 
 Ilev. Professor Buckland, I have been enabled to examine and refigure 
 it(PL.i.fig.2.) with a more careful attention to those anatomical details to which 
 I have particularly directed my inquiries in investigating the history of these 
 animals. 

I am indebted to the polite attention of the Rev. R. Halifax, (with whom I 
 made aa excursion to the Mitcheldean Limestone Basin) for several detached
