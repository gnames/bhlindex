we shall find beneath the cluster formed by the latter, an abbreviated column 
 from which they proceed. 

On dissection, we find that the Comatulae have series of calcareous secre- 
 tions or ossicula exactly similar in their general plan and arrangement to the 
 Crinoidea, and especially to the genus Pentacrinus, intended like theirs to 
 sustain muscular action. 

Pentagonal Plate. At the base of the subglobose body of the Comatulae, 
 exists a pentagonal unperforated plate, slightly convex externally, and concave 
 on the inside. It is analogous in situation to the first columnar joint of the 
 Crinoidea, but as it is not required to transmit the passage to the aliuu ntary 
 canal (no prolongation of the column existing in this animal) it is without 
 central perforation. 

The Pelvis. On the margin of the pentagonal plate, rests an annular 
 plate, resembling the rim of a basin, and forming with the former a basin-like 
 cavity. It appears to occupy the place of the pelvis of the Pentacrinite, it is 
 consequently necessary that it should increase in proportion with the contained 
 viscera, without altering materially its basin-like form ; yet as it is not formed 
 of separate plates, and cannot therefore increase laterally their margins, 
 another mode has been adopted, as I shall explain in proceeding. At 
 the upper edge this pelvis-like plate is pentagonal, having between each 
 of the angles a horse-shoe-like impression for the insertion of the first costal 
 joint. Externally numerous auxiliary side arms proceed from the pelvis-like 
 plate, which when they are broken off or removed, show the exterior surface 
 of the plate marked with concave impressions (the points of their insertion) 
 each surrounded by a hexagonal rim more or less perfect, according as their 
 situation is near the central or marginal circumference of the plate. 

Auxiliary Side Arms. Across the middle of each of the concave im- 
 pressions on the pelvis-like plate, is a transverse ridge slightly perforated in 
 the centre on which the first joint of the auxiliary side arm is attached. These 
 arms, the formation of their joints, and their hook-like termination, resemble 
 in every particular those of Pentacrinus caput medusas, only that they are 
 much shorter, and formed of a less number of joints.
