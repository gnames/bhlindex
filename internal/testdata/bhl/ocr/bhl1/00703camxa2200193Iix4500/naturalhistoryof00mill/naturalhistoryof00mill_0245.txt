the second costal joint of Pentacrinus caput medusas in general figure, yet here 
 the first costal joint is externally so much overlaid by the second, that it is only 
 visible at its lateral margins. <Â»> 

The Scapulae resemble also those of that Pentacrinite, but are much more 
 angularly pointed at their superior surface, and are also tied laterally together 
 by an integument. 

From each of the scapulae in the diflierent species proceed either two arm- 
 like fingers, or two arms ; each of the latter formed of a common and cunei- 
 form joint, from which, on one side the first finger, and on the other side a con- 
 tinuation of the arm sets oft", which, again, by the intervention of cuneiform 
 joints, divides into two or more fingers, and thus forms a hand like in other 
 Crinoidea. Each joint of the arms and fingers sends off from alternate sides a 
 tentaculum formed of many articulated small joints, resembling in formation 
 those of Pentacrinus caput medusje. 

An integument extends over the abdominal cavity, the groove in the arms, 
 fingers, and tentacula, and is, like that in Pentacrinus, also protected by 
 numerous minute calcareous plates. In some species of Comatula, this integu- 
 ment extends laterally in a fimbriated manner, connecting the tentacula, and 
 sometimes portions of the arms and fingers near their origin, together. In these 
 cases the integument is here excessively thin and transparent, having at the 
 margin of its fimbriae a few minute plates probably to add to its strength. I 
 apprehend that this lateral extension of the integument may probably have 
 existed in some of the Crinoidea. but it is almost impossible that we should 
 expect to detect so fine a membrane in a fossil state ; should it however, 
 favoured by peculiar circumstances, ultimately be detected, I feel confident it 
 would furnish a good specific character, and perhaps lead to the distinction of 
 species at present apparently similar. 

An insufficient supply of specimens, and want of opportunity to examine dif- 
 ferent species, hasprevented me from ascertaining whether the groove in the 
 arms and fingers extends also along the tentacula. In the fimbriated Comatulaj 
 I should apprehend it does not, since each of the joints forming the tentaculum 
 in those which I have seen has only a concave impression near the base, where the 
 fimbria is attached more firmly than above this depression. Hence I appre-
