liend that the vessel passing along the groove in the tentacula of the Crinoidea, 
 and probably also in the unfimbriated Coniatulae, is in these placed near the ex- 
 terior margin of the fimbriae, Avhere it is protected by the minute plates noticed 
 before. 

I have not been able to examine the Comatulse while alive, but the observa- 
 tions made by M. Perron as stated by M. Lamarck in his Animaux sans 
 Vertebres, are so satisfactory that I feel no hesitation to subjoin them in this 
 place, more especially, as that naturalist made them unprepossessed by any 
 idea of the resemblance which they bear to the Crinoidea. He notices the 
 power which the animal has of extending its mouth into a kind of proboscis, 
 which, reasoning from analogy, confirms the idea which I have before expressed 
 on the probability of a similar extension of the mouth of Pentacrinus caput 
 ruedusÂ£B. He also states that the animal suspends itself by its auxiliary side 
 arms from fuci or branches of polyparia, watches for its prey and detains it 
 with its spreading arms or fingers, guiding it to its mouth with its auxiliary 
 side arms. 

Lamarck has described eight species.which will require a new specific cha- 
 racter in conformity to the generic one furnished above ; but as his descrip- 
 tions are not sufliciently detailed, to enable me to draw from them that inform- 
 ation requisite to remodel them in this manner, as the major part were procured 
 by M, Perron and le Sueur, and hence exist only in the French museums, 
 which I have no opportunity of seeing, I wave entering for the present 
 further on the subject. 

I have had only an opportunity of examining a few specimens of a species 
 which occurs in Milford Haven, and which I have named 

COMATULA FIMBRIATA. 

Specific Character. 

A Comatular animal with an orbicular depressed body, provided with 
 numerous auxiliary side arms, and ten finger-like arms surrounding the mouth 
 which is in the centre. The arms and tentaculae are fimbriated, and in part 
 tied together by a thin transparent membrane, bordered at its outer margin with 
 minute scales.
