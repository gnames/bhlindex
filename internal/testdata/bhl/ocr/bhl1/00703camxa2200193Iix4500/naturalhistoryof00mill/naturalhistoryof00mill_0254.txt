In each of the horse-shoe-like depressions traversed by a perforated ridge 
 atthesiunmit of the scapul.x, is inserted the first A km Joint, of similar con- 
 tour to the depression, to whose superior surface adheres a Cuneiform Joint, 
 (considered by Mr. Mantell as analogous to the os humeri) and indicating 
 that the arm htre divides, and sends otf fingers in a manner analogous to what 
 Ave observe in the Crinoidea. 

The space between the superior angles of the scapulae, is occupied by 
 numerous small polygonal plates, analogous to those noticed in the genus 
 Actinocriiiites ; these indicate that, as in those animals, an integument protected 
 by numerous plates containing in its centre the mouth, extended over the abdo- 
 minal cavity containing the viscera. This is the more strongly confirmed by a 
 fine specimen in Mr. Mantell's possession, and engraved for his work, Pl. xvi. 
 fig. 6. which also suggests the probability that the animal was capable of con- 
 tracting this integument into the form of an imperfect proboscis. 

In two specimens which I have had an opportunity of examining, the 
 angular points of two of the costal plates where adhering to the central piece, 
 are, as well as the latter, truncated and otherwise distorted, admitting an 
 additional plate, the result of injury and restoration. But, even in this 
 instance, nature has not interrupted the general principle of muscular action, 
 continuing it over the interposed plate which is marked with ridges similar to 
 the costals. 

The remains of this species as already observed, occur only in chalk-pits, 
 and show on fracture, that they are now converted into calcareous spar, thus 
 resembling the appearance of the fracture of Pentacrinites, Asteria, and 
 Echini, found in similar strata, and thereby proving the analogy which the 
 calcareous concretions or ossicula of these animals bore originally to each 
 other. 

I entertain the hope that the parts of tl)is animal of which I have been my- 
 self unable to speak with certainty, will be fully defined by Mr. Mantell, who, 
 by his vicinilj to the clialk-pits where it occurs, has every opportunity of 
 obtaining information and following up his inquiries. 

I cannot omit to remark that there exists a considerable analogy in the 
 arrangement of the plates forming the cup-like portion of Marsupitts and
