expected between it and the cup-like })Oition of the Criuoiciea inarticuiata, the 
 Comatula, Marsiipites, and Euiyale, became apparent. 

The five plates at the bottom of the cup thus presented, pierced for the 
 passage of the oviducts, appeared to represent the pelvis, on which tlie plates 
 forming the area and areolai are arranged in series analogous to costals and 
 intercostals of the former, and from these (the scapulae and arms being deficient 
 in this order) a plated integument extends across the abdominal cavity inclos- 
 ing in the centre the mouth ; this, however, is armed with five teeth, inserted 
 in a complicated ossicular apparatus, a character which, as far as my know- 
 ledge extends, does not appear to have been possessed by any of the Crinoidea. 

It is evident that the original texture of the ossicular plates of the Crinoidea, 
 Stellerida^, and Echini, must have been similar, since the same peculiar struc- 
 ture of calcareous spar is exhibited in the fossil remains of all these substances. 

As the muscular integument over the plates does not extend over the whole 
 t^hell in an uninterrupted line as in the Crinoidea, where it is intended to eflect 
 the movement of the arms, but is limited to short spaces from tubercle to tu- 
 bercle, each muscle having for its office the erection of a single spine, a similar 
 conspicuous appearance cannot be expected. 

In recent specimens of Cidaris iniperialis, we notice slight radiating 
 ridges on the areas surrounding the mamills, evidently the result of the depres- 
 sion of the calcareous matter during secretion, in consequence of the frequently 
 repeated contracting action of ihe fibres of the radiating muscle. 

In fossil specimens of a similar Cidaris occurring in the coral rag, and 
 figured in Parkinson's Organic Remains, Vol, ni. Pl. i. fig. 9, we trace some- 
 times immediately below the mamilla a radiating marking. Is this not the 
 muscle in a petrified state ? 

The corrugation of the muscular membrane investing the regions round the 
 vent, and the undeveloped spines near it, is, I apprehend, the cause of the sin- 
 gular appearance exhibited by some fossil specimens of a Cidarites from Wilt- 
 shire,a8represented by Mr. PAiiKiNSON,inhisOrg Remains, Vol. iii.Pl i.fig.1.3.
