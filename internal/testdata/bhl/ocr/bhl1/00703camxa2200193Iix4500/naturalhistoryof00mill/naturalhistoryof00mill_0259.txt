The first requisite in plates illustrative of subjects in natural history is, 
 undoubtedly, that they should represent with fidelity the object under inves- 
 tigation, convey a corri^ct idea of the whole, exhibit in a marked manner the 
 generic and specific characters, and display the anatomical details in difterent 
 points of view. The faithful execution and accomplishment of these objects, 
 will generally plead an apology in the estimation of those whose object is 
 scientific knowledge, for the Avant of that peculiar delicacy and finish in exe- 
 culion which is within the reach of the practised artist alone. 

In the plates representing the geneiic character of the Crinoidea, I have 
 endeavoured by figuring separately the several parts of the cup-like portion of 
 the animal, yet preserving them in their natural series, to convey an idea of the 
 manner in wiiich they are placed over and near each other in the living 
 animal, the dotted lines directing the eye to their points of adhesion and 
 insertion. In all these generic plates I iiave shaded, and in the Crinoidea 
 inarticulata also coloured differently from the rest, those plates or joints essen- 
 tial to the generic character, endeavouring by this means at once to direct the 
 eye to these parts. This, I believe, is a mode of representation not hitherto 
 attempted in plates on natural history, the public will judge of its eflfect. I 
 have applied it to other subjects of natural history, and found it very useful 
 where the character of the genus or species is well defined, where this is not 
 the case, it has frequently led me to a further examination of the subject I have 
 wished to represent, and thus furnished some interesting results. 

I have supplied from the combination of numerous specimens, a restored 
 figure of some of the Crinoidea, such as I conceive them to have been when 
 living, venturing, however, to indulge no further in this conjectural process.
