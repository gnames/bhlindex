than the results derived from my inquiry into their organic formation would 
 lully warrant. I have in some instances, particularly in the representations of 
 the tentaculated fingers, figured specimens as perfect, where well preserved 
 poi^tions furnished me with data sufficiently clear and demonstrative, and thus 
 enabled me to save the reader the irksomeness and trouble of deciphering for 
 himself mutilated fragments. I have in most instances omitted the represen- 
 tation of the surrounding matrix, as unessential to a history of the organic 
 formation of the animals. 

I have followed in all these points M. Cuvier, who, in arranging the bones 
 of the Paris bason, was enabled by his great knowledge of comparative 
 anatomy, to appropriate each single bone to its proper species and place, and 
 thus to re-unite and restore perfect skeletons from the scattered members dis- 
 persed in various separate blocks. By pursuing this method, he has enabled 
 every one tolerably acquainted with the subject, to form a general and correct 
 idea of the form of these long extinct species, and to assign to them their true 
 places and stations in the systematic order of nature, purposes whicli must 
 obviously have been accomplished in a far less satisfactory manner, even if tliey 
 had not entirely failed, had he contented himself by figuring each separate 
 slab, a process by which the most essential features would have been lost, and 
 buried beneath the accumulation of unessential details. 

1 would indeed generally remark that I must always consider the repre- 
 sentations of mutilated fossil specimens imbedded in their mineral matrix, 
 prejudicial to the advancement of a real knowledge of organic remains, when- 
 ever sufficient certainty can be obtained to efiect a perfect restoration of the 
 object without risking conjectural additions. This practice, at best, aflbrds 
 only a fairer opportunity to the artist for the display of his art, while it mate- 
 rially detracts from the information which the representation is calculated to 
 afibrd to the physiological inquirer, who by a general figure acquires at 
 once an idea of the whole animal, and is at the same time enabled to jud^e 
 of its correctness, by referring to the representations of the anatomical details 
 and to those general laws of organization which belong to the classes most 
 nearly approximating in stiucture to the individuals under examination. 

In pursuance of the plan adopted in modern publications on natural 
 history, by M. Cuviek, M. SAVicNy, &c. I have used letters and signs denoting
