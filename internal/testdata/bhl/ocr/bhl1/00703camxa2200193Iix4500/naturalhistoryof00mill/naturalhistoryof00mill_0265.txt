* I regret, when describing Pentacrinites tuberculatus, not to have stated particularly that 
 its columnar joints when not fully formed, are like those of other Pentacrinites, considerably 
 thinner than at a subsequent stage of gro>Yth, and alternately larger and smaller. I should also 
 have further observed, that the exterior surface of the joints which, in the older specimens, as 
 represented in the plate, is studded with irregular tubercles, has in these young and thinner ones 
 only a single row of such tubercles ranging regularly round the middle. The cause of this appears 
 to be that as these tubercles arise from the contraction of the investing muscular membrane, they 
 are therefore more regular and distinct in the earlier and non-cartilaginous state of the joint.
