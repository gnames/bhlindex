The Microbe as a Whole 7 

much more refined explanation. Even the mechanism of 
 enzyme action through electron transfer is by no means as 
 well understood as, for example, the reaction mechanisms 
 between diatomic molecules. Probably, more attention 
 gradually will be devoted to such problems, and as long as 
 microorganisms promise to be useful for the isolation of 
 hitherto unknown enzymes or for a more fundamental 
 study of the mechanism of enzyme action, it would be inde- 
 fensible to discourage the use of microorganisms in enzyme 
 studies. 

Nor am I concerned with the question of whether these 
 should properly be called biochemistry or microbiology; 
 I have little interest in definitions and delineations of fields 
 of scientific endeavor. But I should like to emphasize that 
 the microbe is potentially significant also for the study 
 of phenomena that are not directly associated with either 
 disease or enzymology, of phenomena that present prob- 
 lems far less clearly defined or definable but nonetheless 
 equally fascinating. Such problems can perhaps best be 
 indicated by referring to that realm of complexity of or- 
 ganization where a collection of chemical compounds ex- 
 hibits the properties of a living organism. Again, I shall 
 not attempt to define where the distinction between "liv- 
 ing" and "nonliving" should be drawn; in the long run 
 this may become the task for academicians desirous of 
 formulating a useful dictionary type of definition of these 
 terms. What I am concerned with is the attainment of a 
 better comprehension of manifestations of matter on a 
 level of complexity such as characterizes a microbe, imply- 
 ing organization, growth, and responses to environmental 
 factors through irritability, variability, and adaptation, 
 all of which may be combined in the term "individuality." 
 I do not mean to express a belief that such phenomena 
 cannot ultimately be explained on the basis of physico- 
 chemical events. But in view of the record of the history 
 of scientific developments, I am inclined to think that these
