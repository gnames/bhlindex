8 Perspectives in Microbiology 

manifestations themselves could not be inferred from stud- 
 ies on isolated fragments of the organism. The mere fact 
 that several examples have recently accumulated to show 
 that an organism cannot use a particular substrate, al- 
 though its enzymatic composition is such as to justify the 
 conclusion that it should, is a simple case in point. At 
 present this anomaly is attributed to permeability barriers 
 or to enzymatic organization; it must, however, be realized 
 that this explanation does not constitute a satisfactory one 
 in terms of better comprehended mechanisms, but actually 
 is hardly more than a paraphrase of the underlying observa- 
 tions. Let me emphasize that the point at issue is not that 
 our current knowledge of permeability problems is still 
 woefully incomplete, but that the mere detection of the 
 irregularities was the result of studies with living organ- 
 isms as well as with isolated enzyme extracts. Similarly, 
 the occurrence of adaptations and mutations could not, 
 I believe, have been surmised from experiments with crude 
 or crystalline enzyme preparations, but had to be estab- 
 lished by investigations with cell populations. 

So far as we can perceive at present, the basis of life is 
 matter, and the scientist must aim at an ultimate inter- 
 pretation of the manifestations of life in terms of mech- 
 anisms that govern the behavior of the elementary par- 
 ticles of matter. To achieve this, we must know the mani- 
 festations, however, and it is my contention that we can 
 discover them only by studies on living organisms. The 
 greater the complexity of the latter, the more difficult will 
 be the analysis of particular vital functions. Hence the 
 microorganisms, in view of their relative simplicity, appear 
 to provide promising material for further studies on the 
 fundamental aspects of life. 

Much has already been accomplished here, and there are 
 signs of increased activity along several lines. The rela- 
 tively recent developments demonstrating, for example, 
 that bacteria in general represent organized units com-
