prophage. If lysogeny were just the power to produce 
 phage, things would be relatively simple. Instead, they are 
 relatively complicated — though more fascinating — because 
 the prophage not only confers on the microbe the power 
 to manufacture phage but also may modify some of the 
 bacterial properties. The prophage modifies the response 
 of the microbe to infection by homologous and sometimes 
 heterologous phages. And sometimes the prophage may 
 endow the bacterium with properties that are, so far as 
 we know, without any relation to phage development 
 proper. 

Before discussing metapoietic integrations, it may be 
 well to summarize the essentials of lysogeny. The life cycle 
 of a temperate bacteriophage comprises three main phases: 
 first, the infectious phase, during which the phage is in 
 the form of the mature phage particle; second, the patho- 
 genic, vegetative phase, during which the specific struc- 
 tures of the phage are produced and finally organized; 
 third, the lysogenic phase, during which the power to pro- 
 duce phage is perpetuated by the lysogenic system. During 
 these three phases the genetic material of the bacterio- 
 phage, namely, the germ of the phage particle, the gono- 
 phage of the vegetative phase, and the prophage of the 
 lysogenic phase, must necessarily be the same in so far as 
 main architecture or organization is concerned. But the 
 germ is inert; the gonophage is multiplying rapidly, and 
 phage proteins are produced as a result of its activity; the 
 prophage is apparently just replicating harmoniously and 
 synchronously with the bacterium, as if it were a normal 
 bacterial gene. 

A number of experimental data have led to the conclu- 
 sion that prophage is the genetic material of the phage as 
 modified by its attachment to a specific locus of a bacterial 
 chromosome. In turn, the prophage modifies the proper- 
 ties of the bacterium as if it exerted an effect on bacterial 
 genes. Thus the properties of a lysogenic bacterium appear
