Metapolefic Integrations IS 

to be the result of the integration of the genetic material 
 of the bacterium and of the bacteriophage, an integration 
 which produces modifications and will therefore be called 
 "metapoietic" (generating changes). 

A few examples will be given to exemplify the notion of 
 interaction of the genetic materials of the two partners of 
 the lysogenic system. Then, some typical cases of meta- 
 poietic integrations will be described and the theoretical 
 implications of the phenomena discussed. 

Inducibilify 

In some lysogenic systems the development of phage from 
 prophage is initiated by an appropriate treatment, such 
 as irradiation with ultraviolet light. In other systems the 
 probability of phage production cannot be, or at least has 
 not yet been, modified. In other words, some systems are 
 inducible; some are not. Thus, Bacillus megaterium 
 899[1+] ^ is inducible, as are the lysogenized strains 
 Mox[I+] and M[l + ]; on the other hand, B. megaterium 
 17 [2] and the lysogenized strains Mox[2] and M[2] are 
 not inducible. 

In the double lysogenic B. megaterium 17 [2], [1] â€” in- 
 ducing agents elicit the development of phage 1 only. It 
 was therefore concluded (6) that inducibility was a genetic 
 property of the prophage, a conclusion which, as will be 
 seen, is at the same time true and untrue. 

In the course of the study of B. megaterium, a defective 
 inducible strain, B. megaterium 91 [1 + ], was obtained by 
 lysogenization. The bacteria of this strain undergo lysis 
 after irradiation with ultraviolet light but do not produce 
 bacteriophage. The defective strain retained its induci- 
 bility for two years. During the third year inducibility 
 disappeared. Moreover, instead of producing the original 
 phage 1+, this strain now produced two phages, GC (G
