for great, and C for clear) and IGT (T for turbid), both 
 being temperate. And it turned out (see Table I) that 
 lysogenic strains M[1GT] and Mox[lGT] were inducible, 
 whereas M[1GC] and Mox[lGC] were not. Then, from the 
 noninducible, defective lysogenic strain, a nonlysogenic 
 variant was isolated which will be called 9 IB. This strain, 
 when lysogenized with phages 1+, IGT, or IPT (P for 
 petite), gave rise to noninducible systems only, whereas 
 the strains M and Mox, lysogenized with the same phages, 
 gave rise to inducible systems.

Thus a given phage may produce an inducible system in 
 a given bacterial strain and a noninducible system in 
 another. 

When strains Mox and M were lysogenized with the 
 phage produced by any of the noninducible lysogenic 
 strains 91B[1 + ], 91B[1PT], 91B[1GT], only inducible
