20 Perspectives in Microbiology 

Both bacteriophages 4 and 8 are temperate. But the pres- 
 ence of a given prophage can also prevent the develop- 
 ment of a virulent phage. Thus the lysogenic Shigella 
 dysenteriae perpetuating the prophage P^ does not allow 
 the development of the phages T^, T3, and T7, whereas it 
 allows the development of T2, T4, T5, and Te (2). The 
 situation is the reverse for the lysogenic P2, which allows 
 only the development of T2, T4, T5, and Te. None of the 
 T phages is able to mature in the double lysogenic P1-P2. 
 This block in the reproduction of T phages is suppressed 
 by the action of various inhibitors of the metabolism (7). 
 It is, therefore, due not to the prophage as such, but to an 
 alteration of the bacterial metabolism brought about by 
 the presence of prophage. 

It is interesting to know that Escherichia coli B[P2] 
 allows the development of phage T2, T4, T5, and Te (7). 
 Thus the prophage P2 does not exert the same effect on 
 the bacterial metabolism in E. coli as in 5. dysenteriae. 
 Here again, it seems clear that the properties of a lysogenic 
 system are not "produced" by the prophage, but are the 
 result of the interaction of the genetic material of the pro- 
 phage and of the bacterium. The nonspecific action of a 
 given prophage depends on the genetic constitution of the 
 bacterium. 

Another example of dysgonia has recently been discov- 
 ered {\). E. coli K12 allows the development of phage T2r^ 
 whereas the infection of E. coli K12(X) is not followed by 
 phage production. Moreover, phage T2r does not develop 
 in the lysogenic bacteria in which the development of 
 phage X has been induced by irradiation with ultraviolet 
 light. This is true even if the infection is performed 40 
 minutes after irradiation, that is to say, after the onset of 
 the vegetative phase of phage h The conclusion is that the 
 altered response of the lysogenic bacteria is due not to the 
 prophage as such, but to a modified state of the bacterium 
 brought about by the prophage. 

The presence of a given prophage may also block the
