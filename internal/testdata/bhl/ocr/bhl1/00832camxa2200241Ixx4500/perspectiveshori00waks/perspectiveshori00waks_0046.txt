Genetic Transduction 

We now depart from mechanisms that should be familiar 
 to every student of general biology, and must deal with a 
 unit not previously recognized in genetics: the hereditary 
 fragment that defines genetic transduction. In 1928, Grif- 
 fith transformed the capsular specificity of rough pneu- 
 mococci by heat-killed vaccines of smooth types (16). One 
 is again forced to acknowledge the fortuitous success en- 
 joyed by some irrationally designed but well-executed 
 experiments. Although not cited by Griffith, the literature 
 of the preceding decade (26) carried many accounts of 
 paragglutination, whereby a superficial attachment of 
 heterologous antigens to bacterial cells was misconstrued 
 as hereditary alteration. Griffith, however, soon realized 
 (as some of his successors have not) that the transformation 
 could not concern merely the capsular polysaccharide, but 
 must involve the machinery for its formation, as we would 
 now say, a "genetic" or metapoietic factor. Griffith also 
 conceded the theoretical qualification that his vaccines con- 
 tained residual bacteria not revealed by conventional 
 sterility controls, but resuscitated in the experimental mix- 
 tures. This caution has often been overlooked and can be 
 disposed of only with the help of strains differentiated by 
 several markers (23, 24), as was eventually done with the 
 pneumococcus also (4, 20). 

Unfortunately, the occasional notice taken of Griffith's 
 work by genetically minded workers was often confused 
 by the prescription of "directed mutation" and perhaps 
 by the indiscriminate use of "transformation" for any 
 species of change; it was not for another twenty years that 
 this transformation was again generally accepted (36) as
