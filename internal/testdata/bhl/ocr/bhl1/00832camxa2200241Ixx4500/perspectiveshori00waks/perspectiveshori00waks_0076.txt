62 Perspectives in Microbiology 

which even superficial examination shows that much re- 
 mains to be done. 

A glance at the history of microbiology shows that the 
 development of knowledge of bacterial metabolism has 
 passed through several more or less distinct but overlapping 
 phases, characterized by differences in the objectives, the 
 points of view, and particularly the experimental methods 
 of the investigators. 

The first phase can be described as that of exploration. 
 Led by such pioneers as Pasteur, Winogradsky, and Bei- 
 jerinck, studies in bacterial metabolism were concerned 
 with the role of bacteria in a great variety of naturally oc- 
 curring chemical processes like the souring of milk, the 
 formation of nitrate in the soil, and the accumulation of 
 hydrogen sulfide in Dutch canals. During this period many 
 bacteria were discovered, and most of the basic and now 
 familiar facts of bacterial physiology were established. The 
 more obvious nutritional requirements of bacteria were 
 determined; the existence of aerobic and anaerobic, auto- 
 trophic and heterotrophic, chemosynthetic and photosyn- 
 thetic types of metabolism was demonstrated. Most of the 
 presently known physiological groups of bacteria were 
 recognized, and their main substrates, catabolic products, 
 and environmental requirements were established at least 
 qualitatively. 

The exploratory phase of microbiology, of course, did 
 not come to a sudden close, but has continued with decreas- 
 ing activity to the present time. Within the last twenty-five 
 years, numerous notable contributions have been made. As 
 illustrations, I shall mention only the brilliant studies of 
 van Niel and his associates on the photosynthetic bacteria, 
 and of Hungate (11) and of Sijpesteijn (22), independently, 
 on the cellulose-fermenting bacteria of the bovine rumen. 
 These and other studies have shown that the exploratory 
 phase of microbiology is by no means past, although it no 
 longer occupies the center of interest.
