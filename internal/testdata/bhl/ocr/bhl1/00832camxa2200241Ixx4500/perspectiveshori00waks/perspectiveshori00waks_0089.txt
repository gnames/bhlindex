lated as the crystalline sodium salt and identified as 2-keto, 
 3-desoxy, 6-phosphogluconate (Figure 5). This substance is 
 then split enzymatically to pyruvate, which is derived from 
 carbon atoms I to 3 of glucose, and 3-phosphoglyceralde- 
 hyde, derived from carbon atoms 4 to 6. The same reactions 
 occur in Pseudomonas fluorescens (14). 

A closely related sugar decomposition mechanism has 
 been detected in a fermentative bacterium, Pseudomonas 
 lindneri, by the tracer method. This organism carries out 
 a typical alcoholic fermentation in so far as the products 
 are concerned. The experiments of Gibbs and DeMoss (5)

show, however, that the carbon dioxide is derived from 
 carbon atoms 1 and 4 of glucose; the carbinol group of 
 ethanol comes from carbons 2 and 5, and the methyl group 
 from carbons 3 and 6 of glucose (Figure 6). This carbon 
 distribution pattern is completely different from that ob- 
 tained with yeast and is sufficiently similar to that observed 
 with Pseudomonas saccharophila to suggest that both organ- 
 isms use the same mechanism for converting glucose to 
 three carbon units. But further work with cell-free extracts 
 will be necessary to establish this possibility.
