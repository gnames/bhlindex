Molds as Metabolic Models 91 

discovered. Worth mentioning here are a few mold models 
 that many years ago augured developments which today 
 we regard as fundamental throughout the biological king- 
 dom. For example, how much earlier might have been de- 
 veloped our knowledge of transmethylation and one-carbon 
 metabolism in biosynthesis had the remarkable discovery 
 made by the Italian, Gosio, in 1891, in relation to death 
 of humans by arsenic poisoning, been systematically in- 
 vestigated. Gosio showed that in the rooms where poison- 
 ing recurred, volatile compounds of arsenic were liberated 
 into the atmosphere by fungi growing on the wallpaper 
 when moisture conditions were suitable. The arsenic com- 
 pound, Gosio gas, originated from arsenic-containing pig- 
 ments used for the designs on the wallpaper. Numerous 
 pure cultures of filamentous fungi were proved capable 
 of volatilizing inorganic arsenic, the outstanding organ- 
 ism in this respect being Scopulariopsis hrevicaulis. 
 Thought originally to be diethylarsine, the garlic-odored 
 Gosio gas later was shown to be trimethylarsine by Chal- 
 lenger (2) and his colleagues at Leeds. The extensive work 
 of Challenger on the methylation of arsenic, as well as 
 selenium and tellurium compounds, has recently cul- 
 minated in the demonstration (3) that the process is in 
 fact a one-carbon transfer. The methyl group of methio- 
 nine, and probably of choline and betaine, is donated to 
 the inorganic arsenious acid to produce trimethylarsine, 
 via monomethyl and dimethyl intermediate stages. Radio- 
 active formate carbon also is a precursor of the methyl 
 carbons of trimethylarsine, dimethylsulfide, and dimethyl- 
 selenide, as shown by the Challenger gioup. Thereby the 
 evidence was completed that methylation of the metals is 
 indeed a special case of the universal biochemical pattern 
 of one-carbon transfer in which the usual methyl donors 
 transfer the one-carbon group to an unusual methyl ac- 
 ceptor â€” arsenic. Functionally, however, the arsenic is like 
 the usual methyl acceptors. Fantastic as it seems, the curi-
