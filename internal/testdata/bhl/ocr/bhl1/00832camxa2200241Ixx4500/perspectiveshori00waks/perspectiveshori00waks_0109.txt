Molds as Metabolic Models 95 

Although this instruction has been available in the area 
 of mold metabolism for more than a half-century, it should 
 not be inferred that capitalization to the highest degree 
 possible has already been accomplished with the fungi 
 themselves. Nevertheless, I am confident that the principle 
 of high substrate concentration as practiced with fungi 
 will, when properly manipulated, stand with other ac- 
 cepted means of obtaining vital information relative to 
 the pathways of oxidative breakdown of virtually any 
 soluble compound by microorganisms. 

Two notes of caution seem desirable, to anticipate re- 
 sults inconsistent with this thesis. First, it should be recog- 
 nized that the initial organism tested on the particular 
 substrate may not display a useful performance. Whereas 
 the biochemist might conclude that that finished it, the 
 microbiologist simply moves in with a magical bag of tricks 
 peculiar to his profession — an inexhaustible series of dif- 
 ferent strains and species of microorganisms. The second 
 note relates to satisfying the oxygen demand of organisms 
 developing in media of high substrate content. As methods 
 for achieving this are adequately documented in numer- 
 ous literature sources, it is only necessary to comment here 
 that the problem is particularly acute in mold cultures 
 because of the tissue-like nature of the growth. 

Cafabolic Mechanisms of Fungi 

■ Among living things, by and large, the fundamental 
 differences in metabolism appear to be those concerned 
 with the procurement of energy, that is, the catabolic ac- 
 tivities. To put it another way, and excluding autotrophic 
 forms, the oxidative degradation of each of the infinite 
 variety of single organic compounds existing in nature 
 furnishes the energy and building blocks for at least one 
 species of microorganism; otherwise, during the course of 
 geologic time the particular compound would have ac-
