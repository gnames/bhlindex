 characteristic (4, 6, 9, 12, 17). 

But in leaving this second case history, once again note 
 that the apparatus used was one that was practically dic- 
 tated by the fashion of the period, and certainly something 
 like it would have been constructed by anyone embarking 
 on the proposed study. But such a method inevitably led 
 to use of hydrogen as an ''inert" gas, and once this choice 
 was made, the discovery of its inhibitory action was only 
 a matter of time. Had we originally employed the more 
 sensitive microrespirometer technique, this finding might 
 have been overlooked, as it certainly was by the investi- 
 gators using that technique at that time (2). 

Case History III, Chemical Infermediafes by

The year 1939 marked the end of an era in the research 
 on the chemical and enzymatic pathways in biological 
 nitrogen fixation. By this time exploitation with the two 
 major tools that had been employed so assiduously during 
 the past decade had just about reached the point of di- 
 minishing returns. At a meeting of the Third Commission 
 of the International Society of Soil Science held at New 
 Brunswick in early September, representatives of the two 
 schools summarized once more the chief findings revealed 
 by application of the two methods (14, 19) and then en- 
 gaged in a rather pointless and futile argument as to which 
 approach — the "organic chemical" one of Helsinki or the 
 "physical chemical" one of Madison — would be the more 
 powerful for new revelations. 

The beginning of World War II within a few days all but 
 stopped research in this field. By the time full-scale experi- 
 mentation was resumed in the late 1940's, powerful new 
 techniques resulting directly or indirectly from the acceler- 
 ated research of the war period were available for applica-
