142 Perspecf'ives in Microbiology 

more acute form. An impressive beginning on these was 
 made with the sugars by Avery and Goebel, who showed, 
 among many other things, that the mere rotation of a 
 single carbon atom in the chain through 180Â°, as in carbon 
 4 on passage from glucose to galactose, was capable of caus- 
 ing a profound change in specificity when these sugars 
 were coupled to proteins. And I shall tell of some more re- 
 cent experiments with polysaccharides from our own labo- 
 ratory. But knowledge of the fine structure of the proteins 
 is in its infancy, and so we know nothing of the chemical 
 basis of species or organ specificity or how, if at all, an 
 antibody differs chemically from the corresponding normal 
 globulin. 

A major subproblem is concerned with the chemical 
 differences between the blood groups. So far, the hapless 
 victim of improperly matched bloods can tell the difference 
 far more certainly than the immunochemist, who has recog- 
 nized mainly similarities. But the studies of Morgan and 
 of Kabat are beginning to disclose subtle distinctions 
 among the blood group substances. I shall refer to these. 

How does complement "fix" to antigen-antibody systems, 
 and how does complement mediate the lysis of sensitized 
 cells? Is complement or one of its components an enzyme? 
 What is allergy, and how is it related to immunity? I might 
 multiply examples indefinitely. But let us return to the 
 antibodies and consider the gaps in our knowledge of 
 them. 

Antibody Formation 

In what organs, or in what cells, are antibodies made? 
 The earlier workers implicated the cells of the reticulo- 
 endothelial system, for it is by these cells that inert parti- 
 cles and bacteria are taken up and removed at least tempo- 
 rarily from the blood stream. Florence Sabin, in 1939, with 
 an antigenic dye prepared in our laboratory gave circum-
