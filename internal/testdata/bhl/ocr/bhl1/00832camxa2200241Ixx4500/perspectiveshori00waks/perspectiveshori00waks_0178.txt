160 Perspecf'ives in Microbiology 

At inhibitory concentration, the compound has no effect 
 on the oxidative metabolism of the host tissue and only a 
 slight effect on cellular proliferation in tissue culture (38). 
 These findings may be taken as indications of some selec- 
 tivity in action. But the nature of the biosynthetic process 
 affected by the compound has not yet been identified, and 
 efforts to block the inhibitory effect with a variety of possi- 
 ble metabolites, including vitamin B12 or its corresponding 
 riboside moiety, as well as various purines and pyrimidines, 
 have been unsuccessful. 

A simpler compound, but not such a potent inhibitor of 
 influenza virus reproduction, is 2,5-dimethyl benzimidazole 
 (35, 36, 37). Like the chloro-substituted riboside, this sub- 
 stance inhibits the intracellular reproduction of influenza 
 viruses but has no effect on extracellular virus particles or 
 their adsorption. In contrast to the dichlororibofuranoside, 
 however, the inhibitory effect is not limited to an early 
 stage in the reproductive process. Although the degree of 
 inhibition is inversely related to the time of addition of 
 the compound, definite inhibition can be obtained during 
 the last part of the latent period (35). This substance also 
 fails to diminish tissue respiration at inhibitory concentra- 
 tion but does restrict cell growth in tissue culture (38). 
 Both the restriction in cell proliferation and the inhibition 
 of virus reproduction are reversible and disappear on re- 
 moval of the compound. Whether the inhibition of in- 
 fluenza virus reproduction produced by either of these 
 benzimidazole derivatives provides a positive advantage for 
 the functions of the infected cell remains to be demon- 
 strated. 

The results obtained thus far with inhibitory derivatives 
 of benzimidazole raise the possibility that a number of 
 processes that lead to the production of new virus particles 
 may be inhibited. The reduction in soluble antigenic ma- 
 terial (39), presumably chiefly protein, appears not to be 
 greatly different from the reduction in the yield of virus
