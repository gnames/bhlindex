Anfibiof'ic Research 177 

Physiological Significance fo Producing Organisms 

Waksman and his associates have stressed yet another 
 important and neglected area of antibiotic research. What 
 is the physiological significance of the antibiotics to the 
 organisms that produce them. We assume there is but little 
 reason to believe that the antibacterial action of anti- 
 biotics gives a selective advantage to the producing organ- 
 isms in the particular environment in which these organ- 
 isms occur in nature. There is a reasonable possibility that 
 if some of the time and effort now spent in the screening 
 of tens of thousands of mold filtrates for antibiotic ac- 
 tivity were diverted into a study of the metabolic reactions 
 by which these biologically and chemically unique com- 
 pounds are produced, information of practical as well as 
 academic interest might accrue. 

Chemofherapeufic and Microbiological Horizons 

I am afraid this presentation has emphasized some nega- 
 tive aspects of antibiotic research, rather than its striking 
 positive accomplishments. F'or the physician and for the 
 drug house, the horizon with respect to antibiotics is de- 
 scribed in terms of new agents, with an even broader spec- 
 trum of activity and an even lower order of toxicity; in 
 other words, in terms of prospective cures for diseases not 
 now susceptible to treatment. Large resources of personnel, 
 facilities, and funds are now dedicated to that end, and 
 usually involve the mass screening of mold filtrates. Over 
 the last ten years, that empiric approach has been enor- 
 mously rewarding. But what to do when the rich treasure 
 lode of the Streptomyces has been exhausted? At least with 
 respect to antibacterial agents, that prospect is already 
 upon us. When a new mold is now found to produce a 
 nontoxic antibiotic, that antibiotic almost invariably
