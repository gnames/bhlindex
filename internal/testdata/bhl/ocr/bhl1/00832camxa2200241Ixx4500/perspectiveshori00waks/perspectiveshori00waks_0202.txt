acid (EDTA), and part in a solution containing iron, the 
 iron was mobilized, whereas in the absence of EDTA it 
 remained largely immobilized in the roots as ferric iron. 
 The production of chelating agents by microorganisms in 
 soil and the significance of these compounds in the metal 
 nutrition of plants are still in the area of speculation. 

Although plants can absorb certain organic compounds, 
 the extent of this absorption under natural conditions is 
 uncertain. But soil organic matter may be a source of 
 organic as well as mineral substances for plants. Miller 
 (24) found that tomato plants could satisfy their entire 
 sulfur requirements from the amino acid methionine. 
 Various antibiotics are absorbed by higher plants, as are the 
 auxin indolylacetic acid, various plant growth regulators 
 and herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides. The uptake 
 of certain of these compounds is cause for concern because 
 such compounds may affect the quality of the plant and its 
 acceptability as food for man and domestic animals. 

The possibility that many organic substances of mi- 
 crobial origin in soil, particularly in the rhizosphere, are 
 absorbed and affect the plant, or its food value, favorably 
 or unfavorably is still to be evaluated. 

There is still another manifestation of the effects of 
 organic materials of microbial origin on plant develop- 
 ment. Cholodny (4) reported that plant roots, when ex- 
 posed to soil gases, showed abnormalities indicative of 
 effects produced by some volatile organic substance of 
 microbial origin. The possibility that this was due to gase- 
 ous hydrocarbons gains support from recent experiments 
 of Davis and Squires (8). They grew mixed cultures of 
 microorganisms from cow manure and from sewage sludge, 
 as well as a culture of the fungus Penicillium digitatum, 
 in substrates containing carbohydrates or salts of organic 
 acids. In addition to methane and ethylene, the products 
 contained the hydrocarbons ethane, propane, and pro- 
 pylene, not previously reported as being formed by micro-
