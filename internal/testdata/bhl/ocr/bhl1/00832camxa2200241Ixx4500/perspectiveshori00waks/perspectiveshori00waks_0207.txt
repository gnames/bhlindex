Parasitism 

Mycotrophy has been interpreted by some investigators 
 as parasitism, but, if so, development of the parasite is 
 limited and is controlled by the host. Extreme parasitism, 
 resulting in diseases of plants, is a characteristic of many 
 microorganisms, including various bacteria and filamen- 
 tous fungi. Although the number of pathogens is large, 
 it is not evident why the number is not greater and why 
 there is such specificity between parasite and host. Al- 
 though the surface structures and other anatomical char- 
 acteristics of plants may provide some protection, it is 
 unreasonable to believe that these barriers are the principal 
 means whereby plants are protected from destruction by 
 microorganisms. The fact that the resistance of some varie- 
 ties of plants is correlated with anatomical differences, 
 such as epidermis composition or thickness, has limited 
 significance in explaining the general basis of plant re- 
 sistance (46). In this connection, Orton (27) said: "It is 
 hard to understand why a thick cell wall should protect 
 from infection a leaf which has many thousand openings 
 as breathing pores through which a fungus might enter 
 . . ." Furthermore, mention has already been made of 
 both intracellular and intercellular penetration of plant 
 tissues by microorganisms where the degree of penetration 
 has been controlled apparently by something other than 
 physical structures. 

It is particularly difficult to understand how plant roots 
 remain vigorous when they are coated with cells of micro- 
 organisms, including types able to decompose the various 
 substances of which the roots are composed. These root 
 structures should be ineffective barriers against penetra- 
 tion by such soil microorganisms. Certain organic sub- 
 stances such as tannin, catechol, protocatechuic acid, other 
 phenolic substances, alkaloids, organic acids, and esters may 
 serve to protect specific tissues, but it has not been shown
