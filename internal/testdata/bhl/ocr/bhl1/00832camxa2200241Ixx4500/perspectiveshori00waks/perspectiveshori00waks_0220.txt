Microbiology Takes the Stage

 Direcfor, Institute of Microbiology 

The first institute devoted primarily to 
 microbiology was named after Louis Pasteur. It was dedi- 
 cated two thirds of a century ago, November 14, 1888. At 
 the time of its organization, the staff consisted of Pasteur 
 as the director; Duclaux, in chars^e of s^eneral microbi- 
 ology; Chamberland, concerned with microbiology in re- 
 lation to hygiene; Roux, studying microbiological methods 
 in their medical applications; and Metchnikoff, working 
 in the general field of morphology of lower organisms and 
 comparative microbiology. 

These investigators were interested primarily in the rela- 
 tion of microorganisms to human health and the causation 
 of disease. General microbiology, systematics of micro- 
 organisms, and microbial physiology and biochemistry oc- 
 cupied only a secondary place. Microbial genetics and 
 cytology were hardly considered. The broad aspects of the 
 role of microorganisms in the cycle of life in nature and in 
 soil processes and the wider problems of chemotherapy 
 were not yet contemplated.
