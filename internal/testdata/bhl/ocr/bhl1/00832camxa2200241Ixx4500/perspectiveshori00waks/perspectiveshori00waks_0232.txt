to Queen's College, was born in New York. But the name 
 Rutgers — unpronounceable for the Anglo-Saxon tongue — 
 leaves not the slightest doubt regarding the origin of his 
 ancestors. Even nowadays descendants of the patrician 
 family Rutgers enjoy great esteem in Holland. 

Apart from the university's name, there is also the dona- 
 tion made in 1927 by the Holland Society of New York: 
 the fine statue of William the Silent on the campus, which 
 testifies to the fact that also in later years the university 
 has been fully aware of the important part Dutch settlers 
 played in its foundation. I need scarcely say that it gives 
 me the greatest satisfaction to speak before the repre- 
 sentatives of a university in which the Father of my Father- 
 land, this great champion of tolerance and defender of 
 freedom, is held in such high esteem. 

Both the university's name and the statue are, however,

 Netherlands. A more convincing testimonial to this bond 
 can be found in the fine history of Rutgers College pub- 
 lished in 1924 by your former president, William H, S. 
 Demarest. The first chapters, dealing with the origin of 
 the college, solidly document the fact that the initiative 
 for its foundation was taken by settlers of Dutch descent, 
 in close consultation with the Dutch Reformed Church. 
 Demarest says, regarding these settlers, "The college is a 
 child of their fine tradition, their zeal for education, their 
 devotion to the faith, and of the compelling circumstances 
 in their new American life." 

I feel fortunate that I can quote from such an authorita- 
 tive and unbiased source, since a perusal of the book has 
 taught me that not all my fellow countrymen have under 
 all conditions been favorably disposed to the idea of found- 
 ing a new center of learning in the New World. Particu- 
 larly, the Classis of the Dutch Reformed Church at Amster- 
 dam seems to have opposed the project rather vigorously,
