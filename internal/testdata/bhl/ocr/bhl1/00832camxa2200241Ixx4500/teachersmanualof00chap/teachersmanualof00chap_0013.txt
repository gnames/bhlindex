ject of both cultivating and directing tlio student's 
 powers of observation. In order, however, to give 
 him some idea of the bird's place in Xature, the sub- 
 jects of relationships and classification have been 
 touched on brieflv- Then follow a series of objec- 
 tive, seasonal lessons which are the main feature of 
 the book. The advantages of studying birds under 
 seasonal groupings are two-fold. First, by elimi- 
 nating species which are absent, it greatly simplifies 
 the question of identification. Second, it is more 
 real. If the student can be told that a certain spe- 
 cies will doubtless arrive from the south the same 
 day on which he is reading about it, his interest in 
 the subject will be at once increased ; it becomes a 
 matter of contemporary history. Furthermore, by 
 studying the birds with the seasons, we learn in the 
 beginning to properly associate them with certain 
 accompanying natural phenomena, and their com- 
 ings and goings become significant events in our 
 calendar. 

As w^e become familiar with birds, and learn to 
 recognize them, the question of identity will no 
 longer remain a bar to our better acquaintance, and 
 our interest in them will deepen. ^Ye shall begin 
 to inquire into the questions of form and habit, 
 color, migration, song, nesting, etc. ; and as a guide 
 to observations of this character, there are given a 
 series of lessons treating of the philosophic or sub- 
 jective side of bird-study, the wide scope of which 
 will be readily appreciated.
