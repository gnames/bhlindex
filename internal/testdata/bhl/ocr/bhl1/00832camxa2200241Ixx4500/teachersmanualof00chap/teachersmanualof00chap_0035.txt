EVOLUTION OF BIRDS. 15 

modified forms, is accepted by most naturalists. As 
 originally presented, it assumed tliat the continued exist- 
 ence of any animal depended upon its adaptation to its 
 manner of life. Among a large number of individuals 
 there is much variation in size, form, and color. Some 
 of these variations miglit prove favorable, others unfa- 
 vorable. Those which were favorable would give to the 
 individual possessing them an advantage over its fellows, 
 and, by what is termed Natural Selection^ it would be 
 preserved and its favorable characters transmitted to its 
 descendants. But the less fortunate individuals, which 
 lacked the favorable variation, would be handicapped in 
 the race for life and be less likely to survive. 

"Without necessarily opposing this theory, the follow- 
 ers of Darwin's predecessor, Lamarck, attach more im- 
 jiortance to the direct action of environment on the ani- 
 mal â€” that is, the influence of climate, food, and habit. 
 The effect of the first two 1 will speak of in treating of 
 color ; the last we may use to illustrate the difference in 
 these two theories by asking the question, " Is habit due 
 to structure, or is structure the result of habit ? " Has 
 !N'ature, acting through natural selection, preserved those 
 variations which would best fit a bird to occupy its 
 place in the world, and are its habits the outcome of 
 the characters thus acquired, or have the changes which 
 during the ages have occurred in a bird's home, forcing 
 it to alter its habits, been followed by some consequent 
 change in structure, the result of use or of disuse ? For 
 my part, I answer " Yes " to both questions, and turn to 
 our stiff-tailed, spear-tongued Woodpecker to explain 
 my reply. I can readily understand how the shape of 
 these tail-feathers is the result of habit, for the same or 
 similar structure exists among many birds having no 
 close relationship to one another, but all of which agree 
 in their peculiar use of the tail as a prop ; the Creep-
