20 FORM AND HABIT: THE WING. 

of fliglit, and that as their wings, throiigli disuse, became 
 functionless, their running powers correspondingly in- 
 creased. This, however, is theory, but tliere are birds 
 which have become flightless through some apparently 
 known cause. They may be found among such widely 
 separated families as Grebes, Auks, Ducks, Kails, Galli- 
 nules. Pigeons, and Parrots. 

One of the characteristic water birds of our Xorth 
 Atlantic coasts is the Razor-billed Auk. It is a strictly 
 aquatic species, nearly helpless on land, which, as a rule, 
 it visits only when nesting. Its egg is laid in the crevice 
 of a rocky cliff, frequently at some height from the sea. 
 During the winter it migrates southward as far as Long 
 Island. Flight is therefore a necessary faculty, and we 
 find the bird with well-developed wings, which it uses 
 effectively. We can, however, imagine conditions under 
 which it would not be necessary for the Pazor-bill to 
 fly. It might become a permanent resident of isolated 
 islands, laying its egg on accessible beaches. Already 
 an expert diver, obtaining its food in the water, it would 
 not be obliged to rise into the air, and, as a result of dis- 
 use, the wings would finally become too small to support it 
 in aerial flight, though fully answering the purpose of oars. 

Apparently this is what has happened in the case of 
 the Razor-billed Auk's relative, the flightless, extinct 
 Great Auk. The Razor-bill is sixteen inches long and 
 its wing measures eight inches, while the Great Auk, 
 with a length of thirty inches, has a wing only five and 
 three fourths inches in length. Aside from this differ- 
 ence in measurements these birds closely resemble each 
 other. So far as we are familiar with the Great Auk's 
 habits, they agreed with those of the hypothetical case I 
 have just mentioned, and we are warranted, I think, in 
 assuming that the bird lost the power of flight through 
 disuse of its wings.
