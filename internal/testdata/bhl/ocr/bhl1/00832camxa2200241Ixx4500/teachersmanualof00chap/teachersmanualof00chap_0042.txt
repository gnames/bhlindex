22 FORM AND HABIT: THE WING. 

aquatic Grebes and Ducks, protected by the nature of 
 their haunts and habits, lose all their wing-feathers at 
 once, and are flightless until their new plumage has 
 grown. 

It might then be supposed that permanently flightless 
 forms would be found among the Grebes and Ducks. 
 But these birds are generally migratory, or, if resident, 
 they usually inhabit bodies of fresh water where local 
 conditions or droughts may so affect the food supply that 
 change of residence would become necessary. However, 
 on Lake Titicaca, Peru, there actually is a Grebe which 
 has lived there lons^ enou2:h to have lost the use of its 
 wings as flight-organs. 

Rails are such ground-lovers, and fly so little, that we 
 should expect to find flightless forms among them when 
 the surroundings were favorable for their development. 
 In New Zealand, that island of so many flightless birds, 
 the requirements are evidently fulfilled, and we have the 
 flightless "Wood Hens. Here, too, lives the flightless 
 Gallinule, Notornis^ and in this family of Gallinules, 
 birds not unlike Coots, there are at least four flightless 
 species inhabiting islands â€” one in the Moluccas, one in 
 Samoa, one on Tristan d'Acunha, and one on Gough 
 Island. The last two islands are about fifteen hundred 
 miles from Cape Good Hope, and have evidently never 
 been connected with a continent. There seems little 
 reason to doubt, therefore, that the ancestors of the 
 Gallinules now inhabiting these islands reached them 
 by the use of their wings, and that these organs have 
 since become too small and weak to support their owners 
 in the air. Other cases might be cited ; for instance, 
 the Dodo of Mauritius among Pigeons, and the Kakapo 
 {Stringops) of New Zealand among Parrots ; but if the 
 illustrations already given have not convinced you that 
 disuse of the wings may result in loss of flight, let
