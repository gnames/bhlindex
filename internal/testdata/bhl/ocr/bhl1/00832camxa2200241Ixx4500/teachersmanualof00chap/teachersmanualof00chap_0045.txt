rulLM AND HABIT: THE TAIL. 25

Tlie Tall. â€” Except when sexually developed, the 
 shape of the tail is largely governed by the character 
 of its owner's flight. Male Lyre-birds, Pheasants, Fowls, 
 Hummingbirds, and many others furnish well-marked 
 instances of the tail as a sexual character. Indeed, as 
 the least im2-)ortant to the bird of the four external 
 organs we are speaking of, the tail is more often sexually 
 modified than any of the other three. 

The main office of the tail, however, is mechanical, to 
 act as a rudder in flight and a " balancer " when perch- 
 ing. Short-tailed birds generally fly in a straight course, 
 and can not make sharp turns, while long-tailed birds can 
 pursue a most erratic course, with marvelous ease and 
 grace. The Grebes are practically tailless, and their 
 flight is comparatively direct, but the Swallow- tailed 
 Kite, with a tail a foot or more in length, can dash to* 
 right or left at the most abrupt angle. 

Among tree-creeping birds, which always climb up- 
 ward, the tail is used as a brace or prop. This character, as 
 has been said, is possessed by all Woodpeckers, by the quite 
 different Woodhewers of South America, the Brown Creep- 
 ers of temperate regions, and other birds (see Figs. 3 and 4). 

The two middle feathers in the tail of the Motmot, 
 of the American tropics, end in a racket-shaped disk, the 
 result of a unique habit. Similarly shaped feathers are 
 found in the tails of some Hummingbirds and Old World 
 Kingfishers, l)ut in the Motmot this peculiar shape is due 
 to a self-inflicted mutilation. The newly grown feathers, 
 as shown in the accompanying figure, lack the terminal 
 disk, but as soon as they are grown, the birds begin to 
 pick at the barbs, and in a short time the shaft is de- 
 nuded, in some species for the space of an inch, in others 
 for as much as two inches.
