30 FORM AND HABIT: THE BILL. 

these birds are largely ground-haunters, and most of them 
 inhabit regions whei'e the snowfall is heavy, the toes in 
 winter acquire a comblike fringe on either side. Practi- 
 cally, therefore. Grouse don snowshoes in the fall, and 
 wear them until the following spring. 

The Bill. — Of the four organs we are considering, 
 the bill is beyond question the most important. We 
 have seen that a bird may be wingless and practically 
 tailless, and may almost lose the use of its feet; but 
 from the moment the bill breaks the eggshell and 
 liberates the chick, the bird's life is dej)endent upon its 
 services. The variety of offices performed by the bill, 
 and the correspondingly numerous forms it assumes, are, 
 doubtless, without parallel in the animal world. 

The special modification of the fore limbs as flight- 
 organs deprives birds of their use for other important 
 services, and consequently we have a biped which, so far 
 as their assistance goes, is without arms or hands. As a 
 result, the duties which would naturally fall to these 
 members are performed by the bill, whose chief office, 
 therefore, is that of a hand. 

Occasionally it is sexually adorned, as in the Puffins, 
 several Auks, Ducks, and the "White Pelicans, which, 
 during the nesting season, have some special plate, knob, 
 or color on the bill. "With the Woodpeckers it is a 
 musical instrument — the drumstick wath which they beat 
 a tattoo on some resounding limb. Owls and some other 
 birds, when angry or frightened, snap their mandibles 
 together like castanets. But it is as a hand that the 
 bill gives best evidence of adaptation to or by habit. 
 Among families in which the wings, tail, and feet are 
 essentially alike in form, the bill may present great vari- 
 ation — proof apparently of its response to the demands 
 made upon it. 

All birds use it as a comb and brush with which to
