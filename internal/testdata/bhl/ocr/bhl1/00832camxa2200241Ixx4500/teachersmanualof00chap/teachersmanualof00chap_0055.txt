COLORS OF BIRDS.* 

The almost endless range of variation in the colors 
 and pattern of coloration of birds' plumage has attracted 
 the attention of many philosophic naturalists. Why, for 
 example, should birds from some regions always be 
 darker than those from other regions ; why should 
 ground-inhabiting birds generally wear a dull or neutral 
 tinted costume ; and why should the male, with few ex- 
 ceptions, be brighter than the female ? 

For answer I will outline some of the leading facts 
 and theories in connection with this interesting subject. 
 In the first place, however, it will be necessary for us to 
 have some idea of the extent of individual change in 
 color, that is, the various phases of color, which a bird 
 may pass through during different periods of its life.f
