46 COLOR AND SEX. 

In explanation of tliese remarkable differences of form 
 and habit, we have first Darwin's theory of " sexual se- 
 lection." This is based upon the ardor in love, the cour- 
 age and rivalry of the males, and also upon the powers 
 of perception, taste, and ^vill of the female. 

The spurs of the male, for example, are supposed 
 to have been developed through the battles of the males. 
 At first a mere knob, they were an advantage to the, bird 
 possessing them, enabling him to defeat his rivals. The 
 successful male would be more likely to have offspring 
 who would inherit the tendency of their father to have 
 spurs, and thus, by selection, the unspurred cocks would 
 gradually be replaced by those better armed. This is 
 known as the " law of battle." 

But the bright colors and gay plumes of the cock 
 have originated, under this theory, through the taste of 
 the female, who, it is assumed, would be more likely to 
 accept the attentions of a bird pleasing in her eye than 
 one who was less strikingly adorned. This has been 
 termed by Lloyd Morgan '' preferential mating." 

Wallace has accepted the law of battle as an effective 
 agent in producing certain characters, but considers it 
 natural, rather than sexual selection, and he denies the 
 existence of any important evidence proving female selec- 
 tion. He therefore attributes many secondary sexual 
 characters to a surplus of vital energy, which, because of 
 a bird's perfect adaptation to the conditions of its exist- 
 ence, can expend itself in the production of bright colors 
 and ornamental plumes without injury to their owners. 
 That is to say, Wallace ascribes to the action of natural 
 selection any secondary sexual character which is of prac- 
 tical use to the male in conflicts with a rival, but denies 
 the female any part in the matter of pairing. Darwin, 
 as I have said, attributes to the female an aesthetic 
 taste which renders the brilliant colors or display of the
