0])servati()Tis of tliis kind sliould be made in Septem- 
 ber, when the fall migration is at its height. On the 
 night of September 3, 18S7, at Tenafly, New Jersey, a 
 friend and myself, using a six-and-a-half-inch equatorial 
 glass, saw no less than two hundred and sixty-two birds 
 cross the narrow angle subtended by the limbs of the 
 moon between the hours of eight and eleven. Observa- 
 tions made several years later, in September, from the 
 observatory of Columbia University, yielded closely simi- 
 lar results. 

This nocturnal journey of birds may also be studied 
 from lighthouses. On September 26, 1891, I visited tlie 
 Bartholdi Statue of the Goddess of Liberty, in 'Sew York 
 Bay, for this purpose. The weather was most favorable. 
 The lirst bird was observed at eight o'clock, and for 
 the succeeding two hours others were constantly heard, 
 thuugh comparatively few were seen. At ten o'clock it 
 began to rain ; and almost simultaneously there was a 
 marked increase in the numl)er of birds about the light, 
 and within a few minutes there were hundreds where 
 before there was one, while the air was tilled with the 
 calls of the passing host. 

From the balcony which encircles the torch the scene 
 was impressive beyond description. We seemed to have 
 torn aside the veil which shrouds the mysteries of the 
 night, and with the searching light exposed the secrets 
 of Nature. 

By far the larger number of birds hurried onward ; 
 others hovered before us, like Hummingbirds before a 
 flower, then flew swiftly by into the darkness ; and some, 
 apparently blinded by the brilliant rays, struck the statue 
 slightly, or with sufticient force to cause them to fall dead 
 or dying. At daybreak a few stragglers were still wing- 
 ing their way southward, bat before the sun rose the 
 flight was over.
