ORIGIN OF MIGRATION. 59 

tance in scarcli of a place where they may conceal their 
 nests. 

Many species of tropical sea birds resort each year to 
 some rocky islet, situated perhaps in the heart of their 
 range, where they may nest in safety. This is not migra- 
 tion as we understand the word ; but, nevertheless, the 
 object is the same as that which prompts a Plover to 
 travel to the arctic regions ; moreover, the movement is 
 just as regular. These sea birds pass their lives in the 
 tropics, their presence or absence in any part of their 
 range being largely dependent upon the supply of food. 
 But, as in the case of the Warbler which migrates from 
 South America to Labrador, they are annually affected 
 by an impulse which urges them to hasten to a certain 
 place. This impulse is periodic, and in a sense is com- 
 mon to all birds. There is a reo:ular nestins^ season in 
 the tropics, just as there is a regular nesting season in the 
 arctic regions. 

There is good reason, therefore, for the belief that 
 the necessity of securing a home in which their young 
 could be reared was, as it still is, the cause of migration. 
 It must be remembered, however, that birds have been 
 migrating for ages, and that the present conditions are 
 the result of numerous and important climatic changes. 
 Chief among these is doubtless the Glacial period. In- 
 deed, Dr. Allen has stated, and the theory has been gen- 
 erally accepted, that the migration of birds was the out- 
 come of the Glacial period. That their journeys were 
 greatly increased and the habit of migration extended 
 during the ice age is apparently undeniable, but, although 
 previous to the Glacial period a warm temperate climate 
 prevailed nearly to the northern ]'>ole, there nuist even 
 then have been sufficient difference between winter and 
 summer cUmate to render a certain amount of migration 
 necessary. Furthermore, there is a well-detined migra-
