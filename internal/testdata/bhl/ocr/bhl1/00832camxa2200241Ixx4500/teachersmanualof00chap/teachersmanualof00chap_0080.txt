60 OEIGIN OF MIGRATION. 

tion in the southern hemisphere, where no evidences of 
 glaciation have as yet been discovered. 

As I have said, the existing conditions are the result 
 of changes which have been active for ages. 'No species, 
 therefore, has acquired its present summer range at one 
 step, but bj gradually adding new territory to its breed- 
 ing ground. For example, certain of our Eastern birds 
 are evidently derived through Mexico, and in returning 
 to their winter quarters in Central America, they travel 
 through Texas and Mexico and are unknown in Florida 
 and the West Indies. Others have come to us through 
 Florida, and in returning to their ^dnter quarters do not 
 pass through either Texas or Mexico. This is best illus- 
 trated by the Bobolink, an Eastern bird which, breeding 
 from New Jersey northward to Nova Scotia, has spread 
 westward until it has reached Utah and northern Mon- 
 tana. But — and here is the interesting point — these birds 
 of the far AVest do not follow their neighbors and migrate 
 southward through the Great Basin into Mexico, but, 
 true to their inherited habit, retrace their steps, and leave 
 the United States by the roundabout way of Florida, 
 crossing thence to Cuba, Jamaica, and Yucatan, and win- 
 tering south of the Amazon. The Bobolinks of Utah 
 did not learn this route in one generation ; they inherited 
 the experience of countless generations, slowly acquired 
 as the species extended its range westward, and in return- 
 ing across the continent they give us an excellent illustra- 
 tion of the stability of routes of migration. 

They furnish, too, an instance of one of the most 
 important factors in migration — that is, the certainty 
 with which a bird returns to the region of its birth. 
 Tliis is further evidenced by certain sea birds which 
 nest on isolated islets to which they regularly return 
 each year. 

Of this wonderful " homing instinct," which plays so
