CHAPTER YIIL 
 A FIELD KEY TO OUR COMMON LAND BIRDS. 

When you have seen a bird witli sufficient definite- 
 ness to describe its color, form, and actions, reference to 
 the following key will often prove a short cut to its 
 identity. This key is based only on adult males, who, 
 because of their song, often brighter colors, and greater 
 activity, are far more frequently observed than the 
 females. But, knowing the male, you ^vill rarely, during 
 the nesting season, be at loss to recognize his mate. 

In order to simplify the key, the water birds, Hawks, 
 and Owls are omitted, in the belief that they will be 
 more readily identified by reference to the plates. 

The use of the key may be illustrated by the follow- 
 ing example : Let us imagine that you see a Chipping 
 Sparrow (Plate XLY) feeding about your doorstep. 
 You note his size, chestnut cap bordered by white, black 
 bill, brownish, streaked back, and grayish white, un- 
 marked under parts. Turning now to the key, you will 
 see that by exclusion the bird belongs in " Section Y " 
 of the " Third Group," and that it should be placed in 
 subsection " 1 " of this section, which includes birds hav- 
 ing the " under parts white or whitish, all one color, icith- 
 mct streaks or spots." You have now two subdiN'isions to 
 choose from â€” "A. Back witho^tt streaks or spots," and 
 " B. Back brownish, streaked." Your bird falls under 
 " B," where again you have two subdivisions, " a. Crown 
 rufous or chestnut, without streaks," and " h. Cro^vn not 
 rufous or chestnut." Your bird should be referred to 
 " a," where you will at once find it described under " a^ " 
 as the Chipping Sparrow.
