94 KAILS AND COOT. 

generally distributed species being our Sora or Carolina 
 Kail, so well known to sportsmen. This bird passes 
 qqj.^ us in the spring in April and nests from 

Porzana Carolina. Massacliusetts uorthward. It returns 
 Plate \ II. jj-^ August and hngers in our wild-rice 

marshes until October. During the nesting season it 
 has two calls â€” a whistled, ker-wee, and a high, rolling 
 whinny. In the fall it utters 2, 'kuk or -peep when dis- 
 turbed. 

There is no sexual dilference in color in this species, 
 but birds of the year lack the black about the base of 
 the bill and on the throat, and have the breast washed 
 with cinnamon. 

Our other species of Rail are the King, Yellow, and 
 Little Black Rail, all of which are rare ; the Virginia Rail, 
 Clapper Rail which is more common, and the Clap- 

Raiius crepitans. per Rail or Marsh Hen, an abundant 
 Plate \ III. species in some of the salt marshes 

alons: our coasts from Lono- Island southward. It is a 
 noisy bird with a peculiar cackling call which it utters 
 in a way that suggests the sound produced by some auto- 
 matic toys. 

Its nest is made of dried grasses, the surrounding 
 marsh grass being slightly arched over it. Eight to 
 twelve buffy, speckled eggs are laid, a number which, 
 in connection with the abundance of the bird, has led to 
 the persistent robbing of its nests by men who sell the 
 eggs for food. As a result of this practice the birds 
 have greatly decreased in numbers during recent years. 

The Coot, Mud-hen, or Crow-duck differs from the 
 Rails in having lobed toes (see Fig. 12) and in being 
 American Coot, ^lore aquatic. ^ In fact, it is more like 
 Fuiica awericana. a Duck in habits than like a Rail, but 
 Plate VIII. i^g pointed, white-tipped bill will pre- 

vent its being mistaken for one.
