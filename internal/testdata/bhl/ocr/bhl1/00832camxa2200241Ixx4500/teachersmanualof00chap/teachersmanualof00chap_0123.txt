TURKEY VULTUKE. 103 

remaining until November. In April we may hear its 
 soft, sweet call, voo-o-o, ali-coo-o-o — coo-o-o — coo-o-o^ as sad 
 as the voice of the wind in the pines. 

Although the bird is as beautiful in appearance as it 
 is graceful in flight, it is a surprisingly poor housekeeper. 
 Its jilatf orm nest of a few twigs is about as flimsy as any- 
 thing worthy the name can be, and one wonders how 
 even two eggs are kept on it long enough to hatch. In 
 the "West the nest is placed on the ground ; in the East, 
 on the lower branch of a tree. 

Like all the members of their family. Doves immerse 
 the bill while drinking, and do not withdraw it until 
 the draught is finished. The young are fed on softened 
 food regurgitated from the parent's crop. 

BIRDS OF PREY. (ORDER RAPTORES.) 

American Vultures. (Family Cathartid^.) 

There are but eight Vultures in the western hemi- 
 sphere, and only two of these, the Black and the Turkey 
 Vulture, are found in the eastern United States. The 

Turkey Vulture, former is not often seen north of North 
 Cat hart, s aura. Carolina, but the Turkey Vulture, or 

Piute Lxxviii. Turkey Buzzard, as it is more frequent- 
 ly called, comes each summer as far as Princeton, N. J., 
 and occasionally strays farther north. 

The Turkey Buzzard is one of Nature's scavengers, 
 and, as such, is one of the few birds whose services to 
 mankind are thoroughly appreciated. There are others 
 of equal or even greater value who daily earn their 
 right to the good will wdiicli we stupidly and persistently 
 refuse to grant them ; but of the Turkey Buzzard's assist- 
 ance we have frequent convincing proof, and the decree has 
 gone forth that injury to this bird is punishable by fine.
