reptiles, batrachians, and insects. Indeed of 220 stomachs 
 which were examined of tliis so-called " Chicken " Hawk, 
 only 3 contained remains of poultry ! Of the rest, 12 
 contained birds ; 102, mice ; 40, other mammals ; 20, 
 reptiles; 30, batrachians; 92, insects; KJ, spider:i ; 7, 
 crawfish ; 1, earthworms ; 2, offal ; 3, fish ; and 14 were 
 emptj."^ The usefulness of this Hawk is therefore obvi- 
 ous, and in killing it we can readily see that we not only 
 liarm ourselves but render an important service to our 
 enemies. 

Fortunately, this valuable ally is one of our com- 
 monest Hawks, and is with us throughout the year. Its 
 loud scream, Tcee-you^ Icee-you, as it sails about, high in the 
 air, is a familiar summer sound. The " red " shoulder is in 
 reality a rich, reddish chestnut on the lesser wing-coverts, 
 and serves to identify the bird in both immature and 
 adult plumage. The Red-shoulder's nest, like that of 
 most of our Hawks, is constructed of sticks and twigs, 
 with a lining of cedar bark, moss, or some other soft 
 material, and is situated in a tree thirty to sixty feet 
 from the ground. Apparently the same pair of birds re- 
 turn to a locality year after year, sometimes using the 
 same nest, at others building a new one. The eggs are 
 about as large as those of a hen and in color are dull 
 white, more or less sprinkled, spotted, or blotched with 
 cinnamon-brown or chocolate. They are laid early in 
 April, most of the Hawks being early breeders. The 
 young are born covered with white down, but are help- 
 less, and are reared in the nest. 

The Red-tailed Hawk is also known as the Hen Hawk 
 or Chicken Hawk,, but has almost as good a record as
