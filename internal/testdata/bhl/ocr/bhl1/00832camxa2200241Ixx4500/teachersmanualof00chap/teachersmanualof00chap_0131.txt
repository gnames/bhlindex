BARRED OWL. HI 

tions of Dr. A. P. Chadbourne apparently show tliat the 
 Screech Owl may pass from one phase to another without 
 chantije of plumage." 

We do not think of Owls as being insectivorous birds, 
 but Dr. A. K. Fisher tells us that of 225 Screech Owls' 
 stomachs examined, 100 contained insects. As 91 of the 
 remaining 125 contained mice, and poultry was found 
 in only one stomach, the farmer may well consider the 
 Screech Owl a bird of good repute rather than of ill 
 omen. 

Kext to the Screech Owl the Barred Owl is doubtless 
 our most common representative of this family, but its 

Barred Owl fondness for deep woods prevents its 

Syrniuia luhniosutn. being kuown to many who recognize the 
 Plate XXI. Screech Owl's mournful song. 

In both voice and appearance the Barred Owl seems 
 the most human of our Owls. Its call is a deep-voiced 
 questioning whoo-whob-iohoo^ who-whob^ tb-whOO-ah^ 
 which may be heard at a distance of haK a mile. It 
 echoes through the woods at night with startling force, 
 and the stories told of its effect on persons who were 
 ignorant of its source are doubtless not without foun- 
 dation. 

Other calls are a long-drawn who-o-d-d-dh, and rarely 
 a thrilling, weird shriek. "When two or more Owls are 
 together, they sometimes join in a most singular concerted 
 performance. One utters about ten rapid hoots, while 
 the other, in a slightly higher tone, hoots about half as 
 fast, both birds ending together with a whOO-ah. At 
 other times they may hoot and laugh in a most remark- 
 able and quite indescribable manner. 

The Barred Owl feeds largely on mice, and 40 of 100 
 stomachs examined contained remains of these rodents.
