 alike in color distinct species may be. In size, however, 
 the difference is more noticeable, the Plairy being nearly 
 three inches the longer. 

In life the Hairy is a somewhat shier bird, fonder of 
 the forest than of the orchard. His j;^^A' note is louder 
 and shar23er than that of the Downy, and his rattling call 
 suggests that of the Kingfisher.

The Flicker is less of a carpenter than are others of
