The Xighthawk, or Bull-bat, as he is called in the

Tlie Xighthawk is a bird of the sky. He passes the 
 day perched motionless on a limb in wooded regions, on 
 the ground in treeless regions, or even on a house top, 
 when, as sometimes happens, he makes his home in a city. 
 Probably he will not change his perch during the day, 
 but as night approaches and his day begins, he will 
 spread his long wings and fly away heavenward to 
 course far above the earth in his search for insect 
 food. 

The Xighthawk, unlike most members of its family, 
 has limited vocal powers, its only note being a loud, nasal 
 'peent uttered as it flies. But it has musical talents in 
 another direction. Sometimes in May or June, if you 
 happen to be where Xighthawks are found — for they are 
 rather local in distribution when nesting — you may hear 
 a strange booming, rushing sound ; you will vainly seek 
 its cause until you chance to see a Xighthawk with set 
 wings diving earthward from the sky. It is a reckless 
 performance, and you may suppose the bird's object is 
 suicidal, but, when within a few yards of the earth, it 
 will turn suddenly upward. At this moment you will 
 hear the loud, humming sound, doubtless made by the 
 air passing through the bird's stiffened wing-quills. 

Xighthawks, being insect-catchers, are of course 
 highly migratory. They come to us early in May, and 
 return to their winter quarters in South America in Oc-
