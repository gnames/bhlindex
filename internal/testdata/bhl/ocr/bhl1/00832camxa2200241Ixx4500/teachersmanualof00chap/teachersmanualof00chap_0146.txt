12G WOOD PEWEE. 

Pewee. As so often happens among birds, their voices 
 are in keeping with their temperaments. The soft, 

Wood Pewee dreamy pee-a-wee or pee-a-wee peer of 
 Coidopus vircns. the Peweo is as well snited to its char-

 victory are to the Kingbird's. 

The Pewee is the last of our more common Fly- 
 catchers to come from the South, arriving about May 10, 
 and, like the Chebec, remaining until October. It is less

 It is a coarser structure, composed of fine grasses, rootlets,

 Usually it is saddled on a limb from twenty to forty feet
