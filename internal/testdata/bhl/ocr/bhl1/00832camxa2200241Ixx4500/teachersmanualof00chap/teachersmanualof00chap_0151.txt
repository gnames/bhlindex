BALTIMORE ORIOLE. 131 

Tlins the Kobin is not a Robin but a true Tlirusb, 
 the Meadowlark is not a Lark but a Starhng, and the 
 Orioles are not Orioles at all, but members of a distinc- 
 tively American family having no representatives in the 
 Old World. This family contains one hundred and fifty 
 species, of which nearly one third belong in the genus 
 Icterus. The j^revailing colors of the birds of this genus 
 are orange and black, hence their resemblance to the true 
 Orioles (genus Oriolics) of the Old AYorld.

 burst into blossom, and at no other time does its beauti-

 against a background of white flowers. To the charm of 
 beauty it adds the attraction of song, a rich, ringing 
 whistle, which can be more or less successfully imitated, 
 when the bird immediately responds, challenging the 
 supposed trespasser on his domain. 

The Baltimore's nest is a bag about five inches deep 
 and three inches in diameter, woven of plant-fibers, 
 thread, etc., and suspended from the terminal portion of 
 a limb, generally of an elm tree. The four to six eggs 
 are white, singularly scrawled with fine black lines, and 
 with a few spots or blotches. 

The Orchard Oriole is neither so common nor so 
 gayly dressed as his brilliantly colored relative, and, being 
 fonder of orchards than lawns and elm-shaded highways,
