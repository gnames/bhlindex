tliousand miles to his winter quarters soiitli of tlie Ama- 
 zon. 

The start is made in July, when he joins flocks of 
 his kind in the northern wild-rice {Zizania aquatica) 
 marshes. Late in August he visits the cultivated rice 
 fields of South Carolina and Georgia, and it is at this sea- 
 son we so often hear the metallic tinh of passing migrants. 
 The rice is now in the milk, and the Hicebirds, or Orto- 
 lans, as they are called in the South, are so destructive to 
 the crop that it is estimated they directly or indirectly 
 cause an annual loss of ยง3,000,000. Some birds linger 
 as far north as Xew York until October 1, but by this 
 time the leaders of the south-bound host have reached 
 Cuba, where they are called Chamhergo. From Cuba 
 they pass to the coast of Yucatan, and thence southward 
 through Central America or to the island of Jamaica, 
 where, l)ecause of their extreme fatness, they are known 
 as Butterbirds. From Jamaica they go to the mainland, 
 either of Central America, or by one continuous flight of 
 four hundred miles to northern South America, thence 
 traveling southward to their winter home. 

The northward journey is begun in March or April, 
 and about the 25th of the latter month the vanguard 
 reaches Florida. It is composed only of males, now 
 called Maybirds, all in full song. Let any one who 
 knows the Bobolink's song imagine, if he can, the effect 
 produced ])y three hundred birds singing together!. 

About May 1 Bobolinks reach the vicinity of Xew 
 York city. Tlie females soon follow the males, and 
 early in June the birds are nesting. This is the glad 
 season of the Bobolink's year. For ten months he has 
 been an exile, but at last he is at home again, and he 
 gives voice to his joy in the jolliest tinkling, rippling, 
 rollicking song that ever issued from bird's throat.
