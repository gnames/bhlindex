COWBTKD. 137 

Occasionally Cowbirds are seen dnrinin^ the -winter 
 near New York city ; but, as a rule, they retire farther 
 Cowbird south at this season, and are first ob- 

Moiothrus ater. scrved there in the sprincj about March 
 Plate XL. 20. They do not come in large flocks, 

but singly or in small bands. The male may now be 
 seen perched in an exposed ])osition on a treetop, calling 
 his long-drawn-out, glassy Muck, tse-e-e. Later, when 
 wooing the female, he utters a curious, gurgling note, 
 resembling the sound made by pouring water rapidly 
 from a bottle, and accompanying it by motions which 
 suggest extreme nausea. AYe often see these birds feed- 
 ing near cattle in the pastures, always in small flocks, for 
 they do not pair nor even construct a nest, the female lay- 
 ing her egg in the nest of another and generally smaller 
 species. Few birds seem aware of the imposture, and 
 not only do they incubate the egg but they may attend 
 to the demands of the young Cowbird at the expense of 
 their own offspring, who sometimes die of starvation. 
 Even after leaving the nest the young parasite continues 
 its call for food, and when seeing a Maryland Yellow- 
 throat, or some other small bird feeding a clumsy fledg- 
 ling twice its size, one wonders it does not detect the de- 
 ception. The better we know birds the more strongly 
 are we impressed with their individuality. To one who 
 has no friends in feathers it seems pure fancy to endow 
 some insigniflcant " Chippy " with human attributes ; but 
 in reality there are as clearly defined characters among 
 birds as among men. To be convinced of the truth of 
 this statement we have only to compare the Cowbird, a 
 thoroughly contemptible creature, lacking in every moral 
 and maternal instinct, with the bird who constructs a well- 
 made nest, faithfully broods her eggs, and cares for her 
 young with a devotion of which mother love alone is 
 capable.
