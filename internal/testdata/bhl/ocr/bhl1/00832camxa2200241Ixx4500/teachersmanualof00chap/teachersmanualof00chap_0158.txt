138 SONG SPARROW. 

Sparrows, Finches, etc. (Family Fringillid^.) 

This, the largest family of birds, contains between five 
 hundred and fifty and six hundred species, and is repre- 
 sented in all parts of the world except the Australian re- 
 gion. Sparrows are the evergreens among birds. When 
 the leaves have fallen from the chestnut, oak, and maple, 
 the hemlock, pine, and cedar are doubly dear. So, when 
 the Flycatchers, Warblers, and Thrushes have left us, the 
 hardy Sparrows are more than usually welcome. Feed- 
 ing largely on seeds, which their strong, stout bills are 
 especially fitted to crush, they are not affected by the 
 changes in temperature which govern the movements of 
 strictly insectivorous birds. 

Some species are with us throughout the year, some 
 come from the South in early spring and remain until 
 snow falls, others come from the far ]N"orth to pass the 
 winter ; so that at no season of the year are we without 
 numbers of these cheery birds. Fortunately, some of our 
 best songsters are members of this family. Their music 
 is less emotional than that of the Thrushes, but it has 
 a happier ring â€” the music for every day. 

It is the Song Sparrow who in February opens the 

Song Sparrow, season of song, and it is the Song 

Meio^piza fasciata. Sparrow who in Xovcmbcr sings its 

Plate XLI. closing notcs ; nor, except during a part 

of August, has his voice once been missing from the choir. 

His modest chant always suggests good cheer and 
 contentment, but heard in silent February it seems the 
 divinest bird lay to which mortal ever listened. The 
 magic of his voice bridges the cold months of early 
 spring ; as we listen to him the brown fields seem green, 
 flowers bloom, and the bare branches become clad with 
 softly rustling leaves.
