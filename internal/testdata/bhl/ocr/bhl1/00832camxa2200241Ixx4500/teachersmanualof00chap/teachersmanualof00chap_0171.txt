tie wavs and sweet disposition are never-failinp: antidotes 
 for discontent. One can not he loni^ near a tiock of 
 these l)irds witliout heinu: impressed bj the refinement 
 which seems to mark their every note and action. They 
 show, too, a spirit of contentment from which we may 
 draw more than a passing lesson. Hear me, hear me, 
 dearie, they call as they feed among the weeds or on the 
 birch bnds, ani], no matter how poor the fare, they seem 
 thankful for it. The seeds of the dandelion, thistle, and

 singing has been abandoned. Each bird has become an 
 inspired soloist, who, perched near his home or fiying in 
 broad circles about it, pours forth a flood of melody. It 
 is an exceedingly attractive song, sweet and varied and 
 suggesting a Canary's, but still is no more like it than a 
 hothouse is like a tropical forest.
