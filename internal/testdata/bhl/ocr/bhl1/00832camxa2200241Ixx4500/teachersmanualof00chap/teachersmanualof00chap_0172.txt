150 PURPLE FINCH. 

forest tree, he utters a low, wild, questioning whistle. 
 With crown-feathers slightly erect he seems alert and 
 restless, and before we can fairly see him is off again to 
 parts unknown. 

Purple Finches, in small companies, may often he 
 seen feeding near the ground with Goldfinches, but if 
 alarmed they soon return to the tree tops. The old males 
 may he known by their j^inkish red color, which is bright- 
 est on the head and breast, and fades to brownish on the 
 lower back and tail and white on the belly. The young 
 males and females are Sparrowlike in appearance, the 
 upper parts being dark grayish brown, the under parts 
 white, streaked with dusky. A whitish line passing over 
 the eye is a characteristic mark. 

During the winter Purple Finches are irregularly dis- 
 tributed throughout most of the Eastern States, but in 
 summer they are not found south of northern [New Jer- 
 sey. They now become more social and may nest in our 
 gardens. Generally a coniferous tree is selected, and the 
 nest of twigs, grasses, and rootlets is placed at a height of 
 about twenty feet. The eggs, four to six in number, are 
 blue, spotted with dusky about the larger end. 

Count yourself fortunate if a Purple Finch makes his 
 home near yours. He may appropriate a few buds and 
 blossoms, but he will repay you with music and leave you 
 his debtor. His song is a sweet, flowing warble ; music 
 as natural as the ripphng of a mountain brook. 

Some morning early in May you may meet the Rose- 
 breasted Grosbeak, just returned from a winter's sojourn 
 in South America. Perhaps his fame
