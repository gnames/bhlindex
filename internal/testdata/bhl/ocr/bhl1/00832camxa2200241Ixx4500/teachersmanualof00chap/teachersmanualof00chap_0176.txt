154: LARK FINCH. 

York city. It is, however, a permanent resident through- 
 out its range, and to one who associates it with magnoUas 
 and yellow jessamine it seems strangely out of place amid 
 snowy surroundings. 

The Cardinal builds its nest about four feet from the 
 ground in thickets, laying three or four eggs, which are 
 white or bluish white, speckled and spotted with grayish 
 or reddish brown. 

In the Mississippi Yalley and westward there are sev- 
 eral members of this family who are rarely found east 

Lark Finch ^^ ^^^® Alleghanies. Prominent among 

Chondestes them is the Lark Finch, a handsome 

grammacus. \^]^^^ about six and a quarter inches 
 long, with ear-coverts and sides of the crown chestnut, 
 the back grayish bro^vn streaked with black, the outer 
 tail-feathers tipped with white, and the under parts 
 white, with a single black spot in the center of the 
 breast. 

This is a migratory bird, arriving in southern Illinois 
 about the middle of April and remaining until September 
 or October. Mr. Ridgway, in his Birds of Illinois, says 
 that its favorite resorts are " fertile prairies and meadows 
 adjoining strips or groves of timber. In Illinois it evinces 
 a special fondness for cornfields,, in which it builds its 
 nest at the foot of the stalks, while the male sings from 
 the fence or the top of a small tree by the roadside." 

Its song, the same writer continues, is " composed of 
 a series of chants, each syllable rich, loud, and clear, in- 
 terspersed with emotional trills. At the beginning the 
 song reminds one somewhat of that of the Indigo-bird 
 {Passeriiia cyanea\ but the notes are louder and more 
 metallic, and their delivery more vigorous. Though 
 seemingly hurried, it is one continuous gush of sprightly 
 music ; now gay, now melodious, and then tender beyond 
 description — the very expression of emotion."
