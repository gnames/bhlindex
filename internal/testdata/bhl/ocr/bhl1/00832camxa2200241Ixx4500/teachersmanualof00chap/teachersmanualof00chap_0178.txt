mingbirds. The male Scarlet Tanager, with fire -red body 
 and jet-black wings and tail, is the most brightly plum- 
 Scarlet Tanager, aged of our birds. Seen against a

 PiateLXXXV. ^Xq from his glowing feathers. But 
 the female, clad in dull olive-green, is so in harmony 
 with the color of her surroundings that she is not easily 
 discovered. The young male at first resembles his mother, 
 but has blackish wings and tail, and does not acquire the 
 full scarlet and black plumage until the following spring. 
 After the nesting season is over the male exchanges the 
 nuptial dress, which has rendered him so conspicuous, for 
 a costume similar to that worn by the young male. 

The Scarlet Tanager spends the winter in Central and 
 South America with his numerous relatives, and in the 
 spring reaches the latitude of I^^ew York city about May 
 5, remaining until October. It frequents both high and 
 low woods, but prefers rather open growths of white oak. 
 Its nest is usually placed on the horizontal branch of an 
 oak limb. The three or four eggs are pale greenish blue, 
 with numerous reddish brown markings. 

The Tanager's call-note is a characteristic cMp-churr ; 
 his song is not unlike the Eobin's, but is not so free and 
 ringing. Mounting to the topmost branch, often of a 
 dead or partially dead tree, he sings. Look-up^ way-up, 
 look-at-me^ tree-top^ and with frequent pauses repeats the 
 inWtation. 

Swallows. (Family Hirundinid^.) 

Primarily, Swallows are remarkable for their power 
 of flight. Their long, bladelike wings show how well they 
 are fitted for life in the air; their small feet, on the 
 other hand, are of little service except in perching, and 
 give evidence of the effect of disuse (see Fig. 6).
