The Lou^gcrhead Shrike is common in the Southern 
 States and Mississippi Valley, whence it has apparently 
 extended eastward through central New York to Ver- 
 mont and Maine. It nests in these States, but southward 
 to Maryland is known only as a rare migrant â€” a uni(pie 
 case in distribution. It dilfers from the Northern Shrike 
 in being an inch and a quarter smaller, in the absence of the 
 wavy bars on the breast, which is pure white, and in hav- 
 ing jet-black lores and a narrow black line across the fore- 
 liead at the base of the bill. Its song is creal'y and un- 
 musical, but the song of the Northern Shrike, as de- 
 scribed by Mr. Brewster, is " really pleasing," and '' not 
 unlike that of the Thrasher, but more disconnected and 
 less loud and varied." 

ViREOs. (Family Vireonid^.) 

Vireos are gleaners, and are to be distinguished from 
 other tree-inhabiting, greenish l)irds of the same size by 
 their habit of carefully exploring the under surface of 
 leaves and various nooks and comers in the bark and 
 foliage, while the more active AVarblers are flitting about 
 the terminal twigs and the Flycatchers are swinging out 
 in aerial loops at passing insects. 

They are highly musical little birds, having songs and 
 call-notes which may be quickly recognized once they 
 are known. The nests and eiriiTs of our four summer- 
 resident species are so much alike that they are to be 
 known only when accompanied by their owners. The 
 AVhite-eyed Vireo iidiahits thickets and, as a rule, builds 
 nearer the ground than the arboreal Red-eyed, Yellow- 
 throated, and AVarbling Vireos. The nests are small,
