Md\ and Septenil)er are the niontlis for AVarhlers. 
 Some sj)eeies arrive in April, hut they are most numer- 
 ous hetween ^lay 5 and 15, when the woods are 
 thronged with their flitting forms. Less than half <»f our 
 thirty-live species remain to hreed ; the others go to their 
 summer h^meo in the coniferous forests of the Xorth. 
 These noi-thern birds return in the latter part of August 
 and abound in September. Many of the Warblers seen 
 at this season are immature birds wearing plumages so 
 different from those of the adult birds seen in the spring, 
 that their identity is not suspected, and, in effect, they 
 are new birds to us. 

To the field ornithologist Warblers are therefore the 
 most difficult as well as the most fascinating birds to 
 study. Long after the Sparrows, Flycatchers, and Yireos 
 have l)een mastered, there will be unsolved problems 
 among the Warblers. Some rare species will be left to 
 look for — it may be a member of the band flitting about 
 actively in the branches above us — and in the hope of 
 finding it we eagerly examine bird after bird until our 
 enthusiasm yields to an aching neck. 

Acquaintance with more familiar birds will d ubtless 

arouse the enthusiasm necessary to a successful pursuit of 

Black and White Warl)lers, but in the meanwhile I will
