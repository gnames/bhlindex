REDSTART. 10 9 

back is grayish brown, but this Warbler may always be 
 known by its four patches of yellow and its characteristic 
 call-note of tchip. 

The Redstart belongs to the group of fly-catching 

"Warblers, and, as an indication of its manner of feeding, 

Eedfltart ^^^ ^^^^^ ^^ much broader and flatter than 

Sftojjfutga ruticilia. Is usual in tliis family. The Kedstart is 

Plate LXII. j^Q^ gQ patient and methodic a flycatcher 
 as the birds to whom this name rightly belongs. They 
 sit quietly until some insect comes within reach, and then 
 with unerring aim launch out at it, returning to their 
 perch to devour it at leisure. But the Redstart darts 
 here and there, falls and rises and spins about, catching 
 an insect at every turn and at the same time displaying 
 his bright colors to such advantage that he seems the 
 most beautiful as he is the most animated bird of the 
 ■woods. As he pirouettes from limb to limb, with drooped 
 wings and spread tail, he sings ser-wee swee^ swee-ee^ a 
 simple but merry httle jingle. 

The Redstart's bright colors, like some mark of 
 special distinction, are not acquired at once. The young 
 male must pass through a period of probation before he 
 is worthy to wear the orange-red and black. In the 
 meantime he appears flrst in the costume of the female, 
 and by successive changes reaches the full dignity of 
 Redstart estate at the age of three years. He nests, 
 however, the first year, when his plumage closely re- 
 sembles that of his mate. The nest, of fine strips of 
 bark, plant-down, and other materials, is built in the 
 crotch of a sapling ten to twenty feet from the ground. 
 The eggs are grayish white or bluish white, spotted and 
 blotched, chiefly at the larger end, with cinnamon and 
 olive-brown. They are laid about May 28 — four weeks 
 after the bird's arrival from the South. 

All the Warblers thus far mentioned are tree-inhabit-
