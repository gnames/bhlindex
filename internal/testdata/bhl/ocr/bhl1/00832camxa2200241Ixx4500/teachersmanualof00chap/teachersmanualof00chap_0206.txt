upper parts, faintly spotted breast, and particularly by 
 its notes. 

The Yeery's characteristic calls are a clearly whistled 
 wliee-o or whee-yott^ the first note the higher, and a some- 
 what softer tdo-tohee or teweu^ in which the first note is 
 the lower. Its song is one of the most mysterious and 
 thrilling sounds to be lieard in the woods. Elsewhere I 
 have described it as "a weird, ringing monotone of 
 blended alto and soprano tones. ... It has neither 
 break nor pause, and seems to emanate from no one 
 place. If you can imagine the syllables vee-r-r-hu [or 
 vee-ry] repeated eight or nine times around a series of 
 intertmning circles, the description may enable you to 
 recognize the Yeery's song." 

The Wood Thnish is a more southern bird than the 
 Yeery, breeding from as far south as Florida, north- 
 Wood Thmsh ward to southern Vermont and Minne- 
 Turchis musteiinus. sota. It wiutors in Central America 
 Plate Lxxiv. ^^^ reaches us in the spring, about April 
 30, and remains until October 1. Its nest is built about 
 the middle of May, and is generally placed in a sapling 
 some eight feet from the ground. The eggs are greenish 
 blue. 

The Wood Thrush is not such a recluse as the Yeery. 
 He is, it is true, a wood lover, and shares with the Yeery 
 his secluded haunts, but he seems equally at home in 
 maples and elms about our houses, or even in the more 
 quiet village streets. He is therefore more often heard 
 than his mysterious relative, and, as a voice, is familiar to 
 many who do not know the singer's name. 

The call -notes of the Wood Thrush are a liquid quiH 
 and sharp pit-jnt. The latter is an alarm note, which, 
 when the bird fears for the safety of its young, is uttered 
 with much increased force and rapidity. It can be closely 
 imitated by striking two large pebbles together.
