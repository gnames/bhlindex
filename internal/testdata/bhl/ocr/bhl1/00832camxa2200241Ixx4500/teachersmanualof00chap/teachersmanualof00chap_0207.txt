HERMIT THRUSH. 185 

The song of the Wood Thrush is wholly unlike 
 that of the Yeerj. It opens with the flutelike notes, 
 and is sung disconnectedly, l)eing broken 
 by pauses and by low notes, audible only

The Hermit Thrush is a more northern bird than 

either the Yeery or the AVood Thrush. It rarely nests at 

TT •.. rri. 1. sea level south of Yermont or northern 
 Hermit Tnrasn, 

Turdus ao?iaiaschh^ Michigan, but in the higher portions of 
 paikmL Massachusetts and on the crests of the 

Catskills and Alleghanies in Pennsyl- 
 vania, it is also found breeding. It winters from south- 
 ern Illinois and JS^ew Jersey southward to the Gulf, it 
 being the only member of its genus to inhabit the east- 
 em United States at that season. Its spring migrations 
 occur between April 5 and May 10, and in the fall we 
 see it from October 15 to November 25, while occasion- 
 ally it may winter. 

During its migrations the Hermit Thrush usually fre- 
 quents woodlands, where it may often be seen on or near 
 the ground. Like the Yeery, it is a ground-nester, and 
 its eggs, though slightly lighter in color, resemble those 
 of the Yeery and Wood Thrush in being plain, bluish 
 green. When alighting, the Hermit has a characteristic 
 habit of gently raising and lowering its tail, and at the 
 same time uttering a Ioav chuck. Sometimes it sings 
 during the winter, in Florida, and also while migrating : 
 but if you would hear this inspired songster at his best, 
 you must visit him in his summer home. The Hermit's 
 song resembles that of the Wood Thrush in form, but 
 it is more tender and serene. O spheral, spheral ! O 
 holy, holy ! Mr. Burroughs writes the its opening notes, 
 and there is something about the words which seems to 
 express the spirit of heavenly peace with which the bird's 
 song is imbued.
