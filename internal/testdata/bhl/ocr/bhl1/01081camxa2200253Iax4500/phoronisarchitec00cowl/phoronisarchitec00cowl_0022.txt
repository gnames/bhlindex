We had confidently expected to find in the larva of the .stage represented in tig. 21 some 
 indication of the mesentery between the collar and the trunk. but were disappointed. Although 
 the ciliated tract along which the tentacles are to arise has made its appearance and extends 
 obliquely around the body proper of the larva, indicating a line just a little above the line of 
 separation of the cavities of the trunk and collar in the older actinotrocha, yet examination 
 of sections does not show the least sign of the mesentery or its fundament. 

Ikeda (9) has found mesoderm cells connecting the nephridial canals with the splanchnic 
 walls, and he thinks they are the first indication of the septum between the collar and trunk 
 cavities. We have not been able to find the paired masses of ''hypoblast cells' 1 which 
 Masterman (16) says give rise to the trunk cavities, although it is true that mesoderm cells 
 were found lying on the dorsal wall of the intestine. Masterman does not follow the fate of 
 those masses, but in the larva with three pairs of tentacles he speaks of "the two mesocceles 
 pushing dorsallv, their walls forming a pair of conspicuous mesenteries with the walls of the 
 ' metacceles" (p. 395). 

As has been said, the masses of cells that Masterman (16) speaks of have not been found, 
 but we do not deny that the condition which he describes may exist in the larva of Phoronis 
 hnsl.ii with three pairs of tentacles. 

" Nephridial pit" (Ikeda). A structure of the larva of Phoronis which has given rise to 
 considerable controversy is the "nephridial pit" ("posterior, anal, ectoblastic pit," "posterior 
 diverticulum"). It seems safe to assume that such a structure exists in the young larvae of all 
 species of Phoronis. It has been seen by Caldwell (3a) in /'. howalt vsMi, by Ikeda (9) in /'. ijimai, 
 by Longehamps (12.) in P. himili mkii, by Masterman (16) in /'. buskii and /'. hippocrepia, and by 
 us in /'. architecta. Although Roule (20) has not observed the pit in J', sabatieri, it seems 
 probable that such a structure will be found there on further investigation. It is difficult to 
 believe that Roule's understanding of the origin of the nephridia from two cell masses of 
 somatopleure symmetrically placed at the sides of the larva is correct. As stated above, we 
 consider the pit to be of ectodermal origin (tig. 21). Further study of the structure leads us 
 to agree with Ikeda that it divides into two lateral branches, each of which becomes a nephridial 
 canal of the actinotrocha (tigs. 25, 26, 27, 28). In tig. 25, which is a drawing made from a living 
 larva, the canals, which in a little younger stage were practically the same diameter throughout 
 their length, have become tipped at their distal ends with a bunch of cells which, we believe, 
 are later to form the excretory cells of the nephridium. 

No positive statement concerning the origin of these cells can be made, since it is difficult 
 to obtain many larvae of /'. architecta which are old enough to show these bunches of cells in the 
 process of formation. The sections examined afford no evidence that they are formed by free 
 mesoderm cells attaching themselves to the internal ends of the nephridial canals, and we are 
 rather inclined to consider them as arising from the cells of the internal blind ends of the 
 nephridial canals (tigs. 25-28). Ikeda's description (9) of the way the nephridial tubes arise 
 from the ectodermal pit i. e.. by the " reexamination of the distal unpaired portion of the 
 nephridia] pit" seems to be correct. Longchamps's (12) interpretation of the change in form of 
 the "ectodermal pit" agrees quite closely with Ikeda's description. 

"Medullary />/</t< " (Roule). When the young larva of Phoronis architecta has reached the 
 two-tentacle stage cross sections show that there is a definite ventral ciliated band extending from 
 the mouth to the ciliated tentacular band (tigs. 2'.), /-. c, </.,) This ventral ciliated band has 
 been observed by Roule (20) in the larva of /'. sabatieri, but it has not been described for any 
 other species. Koule has homologized it with the medullary plate or medullary groove of the 
 annelid larva. 

" Trunk cavity" Longehamps has drawn attention to a figure of an Actinotrocha published 
 in Ilatschek's" Lehrbuch der Zoologie." In this figure are represented two ccelomic sacs sur- 
 rounding the intestine, llatsehek does not describe the origin of these sacs, but Longehamps 
 ip. .">.">.') proposes the question, "Si les canaux ne derivaient pas des expansions laterals du 
 divertieule ectoblastique, ehacun des canaux restant en rapport avec l'exterieur par mi orifice
