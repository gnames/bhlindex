in the position in which Masterman finds the atrial grooves." In those cases in which the hood 
 remains in its normal position we have seldom found Masterman's so-called 'atrial grooves," and 
 even in a few cases when' the hood is turned upward they have been absent. 

The ventral wall of the hood just as it passes into the wall of the oesophagus not infrequently 
 shows a pair of bilaterally situated grooves which are similar to those found on the ventral collar 
 wall.

"Sub-neural sinus" (Masterman). Another organ which Masterman (15) has described is a 
 sinus immediately below the nerve ganglion, caused by the want of contiguity between the 
 raesoblastic walls of the preoral cavity and the collar cavity. This sinus, he claims, is closed 
 except for a fissure which leads eventually into the dorsal blood vessel. He compares this sinus 
 to the heart of Balanoglossus. 

Menon (19), as far as we know, is the only other worker on the Actinotrocha who claims that 
 there is a definite vesicle beneath the ganglion and he has discovered no connection between its 
 cavity and the dorsal blood vessel. 

Roule, Longchamps, and Ikeda do not find this organ, but the latter recognizes the existence 
 of a space ("posterior recess") free from mesenchymatous fibres, which is the posterior part of 
 the preoral lobe. This, however, he says, does not connect with the dorsal blood vessel. 

From the study of the early development of Phoronis architecta and the origin of the 
 mesentery between the hood and the collar, we have come to the conclusion that no vesicle is 
 formed in that species between the two layers of the mesentery (if two layers exist). The 
 mesentery which forms the posterior wall of the preoral lobe cavity is found attached just back 
 of the ganglion in the median line and there is not the least sign of a vesicle other than the 
 cavity of the preoral lobe (tig. -M). 

In neither Actinotroclm Species A. nor Actinotrocha Species B. have we found a vesicle below 
 the ganglion, although in both cases there is a space such as Ikeda (9) has seen, free from mesen- 
 chymatous fibres. The anterior boundary of this space is rather sharply defined and occasionally 
 among longitudinal sections a fibre with a nucleus is seen running vertically from the dorsal to 
 the ventral wall of the hood, giving the appearance of an anterior wall to the space. These 
 tibres, however, are very much more delicate than the wall of the collar lobe septum, and what is 
 more, they occur only occasionally and are evidently not sections through a membrane. 

In the Actinotrochse,, which we have examined, there does not exist any vesicle beneath the 
 nerve ganglion nor any structure which could be likened to the heart vesicle of Balanoglossus. For 
 the supposed relation of the dorsal blood vessel to the "subueural sinus," see Blood system. 
 "Stomach Diverticula 1 '' (Ikeda, Longchamps, and Menon). 
 " JVbtochords" (Masterman and Roule). 

Ever since Johannes Midler (19) saw the paired "blinddarme" in Actinotrocha branchiata 
 nearly all of those who have studied Actinotrochse have observed the same structures. Some 
 have considered them to be liver diverticula, others have described them as dark masses with 
 globules and as brown specks. Wilson calls them "glandular lobes of the stomach." 

Ikeda (9), Longchamps (12), and Menon (17) speak of them as "stomach diverticula," but 
 they do not ascribe any function to them. Masterman (15) and Roule (20) look upon them as 
 rudimentary notochords. Roule, Ikeda, and Longchamps have studied larvae in which the 
 diverticulum was not paired and lateral, but unpaired and medio-ventral. The latter investigator 
 has observed larvae of both t\ \<. 

We find that in Species A. the diverticulum is undeveloped even at the time of metamorphosis 
 while in Species B. the diverticulum is paired, well developed, and ventro-lateral. 

Longchamps has very justly objected to Masterman's use of the name " Diplochorda" nndei 
 which the latter includes the Phoronidse and Cephalodiscus. 

The diverticula of Species B. do not show the regularly arranged vacuoles which Masterman 
 has described for the Actinotrocha from St. Andrews Bay. In fact, we agree with Longchamps's 
 (12) observations in finding the histological characters absolutely different in Species A. and B. 
 from the histology of notochords, and there is not the least indication of supporting tissue.
