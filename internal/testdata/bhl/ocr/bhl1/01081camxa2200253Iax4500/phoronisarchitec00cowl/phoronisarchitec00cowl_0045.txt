Kowalevsky (11), Cori (4), ami Torrey (22) have all found the nerve ganglion, while Benhain 
 (_') denies its existence in /'. avstralis. It undoubtedly exists in /'. architecta, is situated at the 
 base of the anal papilla between the anus and the mouth, and lies above the nerve cord between 
 the anal papilla and the nerve ring (fig. 84). 

The ganglion consists of nerve fibres and nerve cells and the latter have at least two 
 processes. While it is a definite structure back of the anal papilla, on the sides it diminishes in 
 size until its cells become indistinguishable from those of the nerve ring. In fact, all of the 
 ectoderm forming the sides of the groove between the anal papilla and the base of the lophophore 
 is rich in nerve fibres and cells. 

The nerve line' follows the base of the lophophore on the outer side throughout its extent, 
 and in the inner part of the horseshoe it is quite rich in nerve cells whose processes can be seen 
 penetrating into the mass of fibres (figs. 67 to 74). This ring represents the collar nerve ring of 
 the Actinotrocha. 

There is a definite tract of nervous tissue running up the inner side of the tentacle, but we 
 are not prepared to say that it is a nerve running from the ring, although it is nervous tissue 
 which is undoubtedly continuous with that of the nerve ring. 

Cori (4) has carefully studied the anatomy of the lophophoral organ of /'. psammophila and 
 we have nothing to add to his description at present. We are also unprepared to say whether or 
 not the second layer of the lophophoral organ consists of nerve cells. As he has described, they 
 have long prolongations which extend from the cells of the inner layer to the outer, and these 
 processes form a rather marked layer just below the epidermis on the outer surface of the organ. 
 At the base of the lophophoral organ these prolongations seem to be intimately associated with 
 nerve fibres which can be traced to the nerve ring. 

Throughout the body wall of the trunk there is a subepidermal layer of nervous tissue. 

Nephridia. We have nothing newto add concerning the adult nephridia, but our observations 
 on P. architecta confirm those of Benham (2) for P. austraUs. The nephridial canals lie embedded 
 in the ectodermal wall in the region of the rectum. Each opens to the exterior through a pore 
 at the side of the anal papilla. Following the canal from the nephridial pore, we see that it 
 passes downward i. e., posteriorly for a short distance and then bends upon itself running 
 upward parallel to the descending arm. A short distance above the bend it opens by one funnel 
 into the lateral body cavity (tig. 72) and by another into the rectal body cavity (tig. 70). 

Reproductivt <>r<i<iin<. Ikeda's recent paper (10) on the reproductive organs of Phoronis 
 gives a good account of the anatomy and development so we shall not enter into a description of 
 them. We are able to confirm Andrews's observations that the male organs develop at a different 
 time from those of the female. 

Ciliated ridgt oftTu alimentary canal. Andrews has described a ridge running along the 
 inner wall of the oral branch of the alimentary canal (fig. 81). H. B. Torrey has found the 
 same structure in P. pacifica, and we can confirm Andrews's observation for P. architecta. This 
 ridge does not seem to have any rudiment in the Actinotrocha, and it is not present just after 
 metamorphosis. 

SUMMARY. 

The male and female reproductive organs do not develop at the same time in /'. architecta, 
 and the indications are that it is a protandrous animal. 

Fertilization is external and the eggs are not held in lophophoral masses by the tentacles. 

Segmentation is holoblastic and equal, but cleavage does not occur simultaneously in all the 
 blastomeres. During the division of the four-cell stage into the eight -cell stage, the upper four 
 blastomeres rotate in the direction of the hands of a watch. The sixteen-cell stage arises from 
 the eight-cell stage by a meridional division of each blastomere. 

The blastopore is eccentric from the beginning of gastrulation and the ganglion of the 
 Actinotrocha makes its appearance at this time. As development proceeds, the blastopore gradu- 
 ally closes up from the posterior end toward the anterior end of the larva until finally it becomes 
 a transverse >lit.
