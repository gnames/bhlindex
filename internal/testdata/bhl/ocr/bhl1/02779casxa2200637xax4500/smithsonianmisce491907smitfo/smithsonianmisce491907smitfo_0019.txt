On page 124 " and in Dr. Stein's memoir (Trudi Mineral, Obs. 
 CII, 1830, pp. 382, 383) it is stated that somebody, probably a 
 Promishlenik (a trader), found Mammoth tusks and molar teeth 
 on Unalaska Island in 1801." On pag3 190 " Mammoth tusks were 
 found on the island of St. George (Pribilof group) in the year 
 1836 according to Veniaminoff." ' 

It may thus be seen that Grewingk makes no distinction between 
 the terms Mammoth and Mastodon and apparently is not satisfied 
 that the fossil elephant of Alaska is the typical Elephas primigenius 
 of Siberia. 

Later Dall ^ appears to accept this latter view of Grewingk and 
 mentions that Wossnessenski collected tusks, teeth, and bones of the 
 Elephas primigenius and Elephas columbi near Topanika Creek, 
 Norton Sound. We think the identification of E. columbi needs 
 verification before it is assigned to Alaska. M. T. Obalski * mentions 
 the occurrence of the Mastodon in the placer gravels of the Klon- 
 dike region, but this statement, which the writer understands is not 
 based on the identification of specimens, appears to be an error. 
 Obalski makes another statement that does not appear to be founded 
 on fact. He says ivory tusks 6 meters (19.6 feet) long occur in 
 the Klondike gravels. This statement is an exaggeration. The 
 longest tusk so far reported from Alaska is one 12 feet 10 inches 
 (about 4 meters), measured along the outside of the curve. Re- 
 mains of the rhinoceros have not been reported with those of the 
 mammoth in Alaska, as in Siberia, and it also appears that the re- 
 mains of the mammoth in Alaska are not in as fresh a state of 
 preservation as those found in Siberia, which points to the surmise 
 that the mammoth became extinct in Alaska before the last of the 
 species succumbed in Siberia. Associated with the mammoth were 
 herds of large bison and horses. This species of horse may have 
 been the last native to North America, the rear guard of the last 
 migration of these animals across the region of Bering Straits to 
 Asia before the land connection disappeared. There was a species 
 of musk-ox together with sheep and bear. Descendants of these 
 last three forms have by adaptive changes survived in these northern 
 regions down to the present time.
