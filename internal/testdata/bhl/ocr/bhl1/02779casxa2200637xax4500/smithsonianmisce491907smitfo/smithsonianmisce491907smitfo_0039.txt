Horizon of Mammoth in Alaska 25 

with a tooth from Whidby Island, Washington, and now in the 
 U. S. National Museum, to Elephas columbi and not to the true 
 Mammoth (Elephas primigenius). Several additional occurrences 
 of scattered mammoth remains within the general limits of glacia- 
 tion are the part of a tooth found in the drift about six miles above 
 Edmonton, Alberta, Canada," and on Snow River, at the head of 
 Lake Kenai, Kenai Peninsula, Alaska.'" 

In Science ^ under the heading " Geographical Notes," an 
 anonymous writer mentions that Lieut. H. T. Allen observed re- 
 mains of mammoth, presumably, on the Copper River, Alaska. 
 This appears to be an error, for Lieut. Allen ^^ makes no reference 
 to such remains having been seen on the Copper River, but he says, 
 that on the Koyukuk River, which flows into the Yukon from the 
 north, six miles above the mouth of the Allenkakat River, a tribu- 
 tary of the Koyukuk, he found the os pubis of a mammoth. He 
 also makes a note on his map No. i, of " Ice banks â€” Mammoth 
 remains " at the mouth of a stream he names the " Atutsakulaku- 
 shakakat" that flows into the Yukon from the south about eighteen 
 miles below the mouth of the Tozi River. This is the general 
 locality of the Palisades already mentioned. 

V. Horizon of Mammoth in Alaska 
 I. remains carried out on lakes by floating ice 

The lowest horizon in Alaska to which Mammoth remains may 
 be referred are the lacustrine facies of the " Yukon Silts " or the 
 " Kowak Clays." "'^ 

These deposits form an extensively developed Pleistocene feature 
 in Alaska. Scattered through them occur fragmental remains of 
 mammoth skeletons, isolated teeth, tusks, and bones, which are ex- 
 posed where the streams vmdermine the silts by lateral cutting.
