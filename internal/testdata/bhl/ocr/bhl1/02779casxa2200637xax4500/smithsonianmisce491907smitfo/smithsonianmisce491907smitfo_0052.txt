The sequence of events accompanying the period of elevation and 
 drainage cannot be traced in detail with the facts at hand. They 
 are mentioned here to show there is no necessity for calling in " un- 
 usual accumulations of snow throughout successive years " to ac- 
 count for any of the phenomena under consideration. 

6. elevation and deformation at close of the pleistocene 

It has already been stated that the Pleistocene silts of x\laska 
 are thrown up into broad open folds. These undulations appear 
 best developed where there are the largest areas of silts or through- 
 out the basin areas of the former lakes. The deformation appears 
 to have developed during the period of elevation that marked the 
 close of the period of Pleistocene deposition. This folding was 
 gentle and formed comparatively small shallow lake and pond 
 areas over the drained bottoms of the former extensive lakes. 

7. PROBABLE change OF CLIMATE 

Accompanying this elevation was a change from comparatively 
 mild, temperate conditions, which there is every reason to say ex- 
 isted — for the fauna and flora as far as known demand moderately 
 temperate conditions — to the climate that prevails in these regions 
 today. 

As a better idea of the situation may be presented by quoting 
 from one who has given considerable attention to the subject the 
 following is appended from Sir Henry Howorth "' in an article 
 entitled " The Mammoth Age was Contemporary with the Age of 
 Great Glaciers; " he says: " It is a remarkable fact that if we limit 
 ourselves to the plains of northern Siberia, there is no evidence 
 that a period of severe cold other than that now existing has 
 marked the climate of Siberia since the Mammoth was extinguished. 
 The existence of carcasses in their flesh point to the age they rep- 
 resent having been the last one, the climate having become more 
 and more severe since the Mammoth age. This means, if evidence 
 is to go for anything, that the Mammoth age in Siberia and north- 
 east Europe, which was its last epoch, was contemporary with the 
 Great Glaciers." He quotes Geikie as saying "the IMammoth and 
 the Woolly Rhinoceros may have survived in northern Asia down 
 to a comparatively recent date " "^ and continues : " I cannot see how 
 the conclusion can be avoided, in fact, that in Siberia the ?\Iammoth
