tures : Arctic Vegetation," summarizes as follows : " In attempting 
 to picture to ourselves the conditions which obtained during the Gla- 
 cial period, it is frequently forgotten that a very low temperature is 
 not of that importance which it is often considered to be in bringing 
 about an Ice Age. 

"Wallace"' and many others have laid stress on the necessity for 
 a concurrence of several conditions in order to render possible an 
 abnormal extension of snow and ice. 

" Whitney "^ in his comprehensive monograph on the climatic 
 changes of later geological times, has argued for the possibility of the 
 former extension of snow and ice without any violent changes in 
 climatic conditions. 

" After considering the question at length he remarks, ' The 
 entire body of facts presented brings out most clearly the true con- 
 dition of things, namely, that the Glacial epoch was a local phe- 
 nomenon, during the occurrence of which much the larger of the 
 land masses of the Globe remained climatologically entirely un- 
 affected.' As illustrating the possibility of glaciers existing in 
 places whose mean temperature differ by several degrees we may 
 notice some observations given by Woeikof."" He shows clearly 
 how other conditions than merely a low temperature are essential to 
 ice extension. Comparing the temperature taken at the lower ends 
 of glaciers in East Siberia and the west of New Zealand, there 
 is found to be a difference of more than 20° ; at Irkutsk in East 
 Siberia the temperature recorded being — 10.2°, in New Zealand 
 10°. Glaciers occur in the latitude of Nice and Florence extend- 
 ing to 212 meters above the sea level having at their lower ends 
 a mean annual temperature corresponding to that of Vienna and 
 Brussels, and warmer than that of Geneva and Odessa, with a 
 winter temperature higher than that of Florence. 

" There is the often-quoted case of the Tasman glacier descending 
 towards the West coast of New Zealand ; here the terminal face of 
 the ice is 705 feet above sea level, and is ' hidden by a grove of Pines, 
 Ratas. Beeches, and arborescent Ferns in the foreground.' 

" All these facts show us that the idea of the coexistence in the 
 same region of vegetation — in some cases of an almost tropical 
 facies — and ice fields is not so inconceivable as one might suppose.
