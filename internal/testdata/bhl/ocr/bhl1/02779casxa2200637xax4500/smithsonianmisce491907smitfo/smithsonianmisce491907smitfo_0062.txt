40 Smithsonian Exploration in Alaska in 1904 

Cape Halkett, one of the most prominent promontories along this 
 part of the coast (pi. x, D), terminates in an ice cliff rising thirty 
 feet above tide level, and is overlain by a foot or two of muck, 
 which in turn is carpeted by a nap of moss and grass at the surface. 
 Judging from the topography, the ice at this locality may extend 
 inland several miles. Its thickness is not known, since its lower 
 limit lies below tide level. As shown in the view, the cape is being 
 rapidly cut back by wave action, which undermines the cliff at tide 
 level until by its own weight the ice breaks off in large blocks and 
 is ground up by the surf. 

" Of the Kowak clay containing Pleistocene vertebrate remains, 
 referred to by Doctor Dall in connection with the ground ice, but 
 little was seen by the writer. Observation, however, has been suf- 
 ficient to suggest that, if present along the coast between the Col- 
 ville and Chipp (Ikpikpuk) River, they are not only far from con- 
 tinuous, but are probably of very limited occurrence. Along the 
 northwest part of the coast, the only locality at which what seems 
 with certainty to be the Kowak clay was observed, is at Woody 
 Inlet, about fifty miles southwest of Point Barrow. As this inlet is 
 not far from the seventy-first degree of north latitude it is thought 
 that the deposit may be near that in which Captain Beechey's party 
 obtained elephant remains." 

4. PRESENT DRAINAGE FLOOD-PLAIN ICE 

All the rivers of Alaska present along their valleys two distinct 
 classes of unconsolidated deposits. One consists of the low banks, 
 which are only ten to twenty feet above the river and which are 
 composed of fine dark alluvium alternating with layers of vegetable 
 matter. Here buried logs and the upright stumps and trunks of 
 trees are frequent, while their surfaces have often a covering of 
 fresh mud, deposited by the spring floods. Lenticular masses of ice 
 are frequently exposed in the banks of these flood-plain alluviums. 
 The other class are the older deposits of higher and lighter colored 
 silts without vegetable matter, which are cut by the rivers more 
 rarely. These vary from fifty to two hundred feet in height. 

The newer flood-plain ice occurs unconformably with alluvium 
 and humus. Russell '* amplifies on the formation of " Stratified 
 Ice in the Tundra " as follows : 

" The great number of lakelets on the surface of the tundra ren-
