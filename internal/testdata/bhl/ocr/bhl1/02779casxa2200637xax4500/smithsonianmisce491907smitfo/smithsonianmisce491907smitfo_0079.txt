Tohnatschozv's Vicn's on the Ice of the Beresowka River 

An abridged translation from the report (in Russian) of O. F. 
 Herz, chief of an expedition sent out by the St. Petersburg Acad- 
 emy of Sciences to investigate the finding and excavating of re- 
 mains of a mammoth, partly in the flesh, in a frozen state, on the 
 banks of the Beresowka River, a tributary of the Kolyma, in north- 
 eastern Siberia, is published in the Smithsonian Report for 1903, 
 pp. 611-625, pis. i-ix. Herz gathered some pieces of ice, along with 
 other specimens from the formations associated with the mammoth. 
 These materials were taken back to St. Petersburg, where he placed 
 them together with his field notes and sketches in the hands of I, 
 P. Tolmatschow to report upon from a geological standpoint.^" 

These accounts of Plerz and Tolmatschow are of particular inter- 
 est because they throw much light on the circumstances surround- 
 ing the occurrence of such remains. Unfortunately the position in 
 which the carcass was found, was secondary to its place of original 
 interment, and leaves doubt about one important point â€” whether 
 the mammoth died and became entombed before or after the thick 
 bed of ice, forming the terrace feature along the bank of the river 
 at this place, was formed ; or while it was forming. There appears 
 to be no evidence at hand to settle this question and place the time 
 at which this particular animal died and thus give us an authentic 
 record of the occurrence of the mammoth in its true geological 
 (stratigraphical) horizon. 

Tolmatschow says : " The difficult task of the expedition, i. e., 
 the taking of the mammoth carcass to St. Petersburg in the best 
 possible condition, the short time at its disposal, and the cold winter 
 with much snow, did not permit of the pursuit of geological re- 
 searches as completely as would have been desirable. Besides this 
 the chief of the expedition, O. F. Herz, is not a geologist, but an 
 old zoologist, and was not at all prepared to make geological ob- 
 servations because there was a geologist, Herr Sevastianofif, 
 among the members of the expedition. (For some unstated rea- 
 son this member did not accompany Herz to the mammoth re- 
 mains on the Beresowka, but after reaching Mysova, within 
 eighty-five miles of the mammoth, returned to Sredne- 
 Kolymsk.) " 

Tolmatschow devotes most of his article to a discussion of the 
 properties of ice as a mineral, its crystallographic forms and the
