Land Ice of Arctic and Sub- Arctic Regions 53 

bubbles of air are not so many, they are round or egg-shaped, and 
 they are irregularly distributed. Upon melting, this ice also divides 
 into rounded polyhedral grains of an average diameter of 5 mm., 
 and altogether they are smaller than those of the first samples (A). 
 Under the microscope we see the same images as before. The air 
 contained was 50 cu. cm. per kilo of ice, the remains of clay 0.24%, 
 i. e., 2.5 grams per kilo. The specific weight was 0.878. 

" The first conclusion we may arrive at from these observations 
 is that the ice just described cannot have been formed directly from 
 water. Ice coming from the surface of water, for instance from a 
 pond, shows a parallel increase of long-stalked crystals, whose 
 optical axes are perpendicular to the freezing surface. A section 
 taken from such ice shows under the microscope all the properties 
 of a crystal. When melting, such ice divides into a series of irregu- 
 lar prisms some decimeters long The freezing of water is 

much more complex than might appear when we observe an already 
 formed piece of ice. But this relates only to the first phase of the 
 formation of ice. Later on the freezing goes on in a much simpler 
 and more regular way, so an ice is formed which in its principal 
 mass is characterized by its prismatic structure and thereby can be 
 easily distinguished from snow ice, as has been known for a long 
 time, and recently once more clearly shown by Prof. E. Drygalski *^ 
 in his study of the materials of the Greenland expedition. The 
 large quantity of air of the ice coming from the Beresowka differen- 
 tiates it also from ice coming from ordinary freezing of water, and 
 confirms its snowy nature, as is shown by the great number of 
 observations carried on chiefly on ice of glaciers. 

" The well-known works of Agassiz and Nicolet have shown that 
 one kilo of snow on changing into neve contains 64 cu. cm. of air ; 
 one kilo of white glacier ice 15 cu. cm. and one kilo' of blue ice 
 I cu. cm 

" It is easy to see that the quantity of air contained in the ice 
 of the Beresowka approaches that of white glacier ice and even to 
 neve ice, especially for the first sample (A). 

" Its structure, which we have described above, resembles that of 
 glacier ice, though in comparison to the ice of the Alpine glaciers, 
 the grains are very minute. But in comparing it with the ice of the 
 interior of Greenland, we do not notice this difference so much." 

" The characteristic structure of neve ice — a conglomerate of ice 
 grains kept together by an ice cement formed of very small grains —
