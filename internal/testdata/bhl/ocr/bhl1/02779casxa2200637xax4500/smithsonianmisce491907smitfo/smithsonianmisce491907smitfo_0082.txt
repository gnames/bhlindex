54 Smithsonian Exploration in Alaska in 1904 

has completely disappeared from the samples we have described. 
 Herz does not say anything about the sheets of the principle mass 
 of ice, he mentions only thin sheets of ice which appear in the layer 
 of earth which covers the main body of ice. We can therefore say 
 that the division of the main ice mass into layers either does not 
 exist at all, or has been obscured by the secondary process of melt- 
 ing and erosion, and this last is the most likely thing to have 
 happened." 

The writer cannot agree that " the secondary process of melting " 
 has obscured any stratified appearance of the principal ice mass on 
 the Beresowka. Herz more probably failed to note such structure 
 because it did not exist. However, he suggests that a more or less 
 secondary and superficial process of melting partly accounts for the 
 ice with large gas content such as Tolmatschow's samples exhibit 
 and also for its granular structure. Granting all the theoretical 
 considerations of ice Tolmatschow asks for, and granting without 
 hesitation that his samples are snow ice, we are no nearer an expla- 
 nation of the true origirt of the fundamental bed of ice on the 
 Beresowka. The characters of his samples fail to prove that the 
 bed of ice in the terrace of the Beresowka has an origin from con- 
 solidated beds of drifted snow. 

There appears to be two distinct kinds of ice associated with the 
 mammoth on the bank of the Beresowka. One of fundamental, 
 the other of superficial position and arrangement ; one of stable and 
 the other of transitory aspect. The writer considers the samples 
 gathered by Herz and examined by Tolmatschow were from that 
 kind of ice which is superficial in position and more or less transi- 
 tory in its origin and occurrence ; that therefore it is of no weight 
 whatever in demonstrating that the fundamental ice feature of the 
 Beresowka is of snow origin. 

To explain: Tolmatschow's samples {A), two small pieces, 
 came from a little ditch excavated imder the mammoth 1.9 meters 
 deep; {B) a large piece came from the lower part of the ice wall 
 which is situated on the upper edge of the terrace on the bank of 
 the river 55 meters above its level. 

In brief, samples {A) came from the sliding talus slope and may 
 well be of snow origin as the winter snows accumulate, pack down 
 in crevices, and together with thaw water percolating through the 
 interstices of the frozen talus blocks, become consolidated into ice. 
 This appears to account for all the ice immediately associated with 
 the mammoth's carcass as described and figured by Tolmatschow. 

Sample {B) may also be of snow origin for snow accumulates
