and solidifies against ice escarpments as readily as elsewhere. Tol- 
 matschow's results and conclusions in regard to the ice of sample 
 (B) may have been different if the sample had come from higher 
 up on the ice face, or better still, if it had been taken more from 
 the interior of the mass. As it is, the sample coming from the 
 lozver part of the surface may, even if not admitted to be of snow 
 origin, readily have been modified " by the secondary process of 
 melting and erosion" of water ice and must be admitted to be of a 
 superficial nature and not a criterion by which to judge the origin 
 of the mass of the ice bed. 

It must also be borne in mind that those who think some ice de- 
 posits are of water origin, i. e., are frozen from water and not

 same as that of the freezing of an open, unobstructed expanse, like 
 a lake or pond, that when once frozen it is suddenly covered over 
 its whole area and preserved so that the normal crystallographic 
 structure of the ice will be retained. The process is far different 
 from this. True the pond or lake freezes over every winter, but
