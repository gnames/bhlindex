58 Smithsonian Exploration in Alaska in 1904 

" Now to consider the geological structure of the terrace more 
 closely, (i) Above is to be found an earthy layer, covered with 
 moss, 30-52 centimeters (12-20 inches) thick. (2) Under this a 
 layer from 2-4 meters thick composed of layers of clay with coarse 
 shingle corresponding, petrographically, to the rocks of the nearby 
 mountains. With the shingle in this layer was also found pieces 
 of wood, bones, etc. Through this clayey and loamy deposit be- 
 sides the stones, roots, and pieces of wood, were lamellar layers of 
 ice up to 15-18 centimeters thick, stretching through the mass. 
 (3) Underneath this alluvial layer there is a vertical wall of ice 
 five and even seven meters thick. With this ice wall the section 
 closes, because below it comes the sliding talus to be found every- 
 where along the slope of the terrace. Under the place where the 
 mammoth lay Herz dug to the depth of 2.25 meters. At first the 
 excavation passed through deposits of earth alternating with thin 
 layers of ice, but at a depth of 1.90 meters a compact mass of ice 
 was found, which was not passed through at 2.25 meters depth." 

Tolmatschow reviews the several suppositions that may be drawn 
 about the thickness of the fundamental ice bed, for it appears in 
 the Beresowka section the lower surface of this ice was hidden by 
 talus. He does not think that it extends down to the level of the 
 Beresowka as Herz thought,*'^ and it is not represented that way in 
 the profiles given, because in this case the structure of the bank 

would be quite different Tolmatschow says : " The large 

dimensions of the sliding mass make me suppose that under the 
 ice wall and high above the level of the Beresowka are to be found 
 other deposits of clay and loam. The photographs (pi. viii) and 
 the sketches made by Herz give the sharp contrast between the 
 vertical ice wall and the slope of the bank. If the thickness of the 
 ice was greater there could not be such a contrast." 

The writer can state that in apparently analogous cases observed 
 in Alaska the ice rests on top of considerable thicknesses of homo- 
 geneous Pleistocene clays such as appear to form the body of the 
 terrace on the Beresowka. 

" By the washing away of these deposits the ice sheet above is 
 undermined, the layers become loosened so that they fall and slide 
 little by little with all that is to be found on them. Only in this 
 way it seems to me, can be explained the singular fact that the 
 mammoth, which lay in a sliding place, therefore in a secondary 
 deposit, was found nevertheless in such a way, that there can be 
 no doubt left about the place and position from which it has fallen."
