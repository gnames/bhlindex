Land Ice and the Mammoth 63 

mammoth are of snow origin or occur interstratified with the Pleis- 
 tocene silts are based on misinterpretations of the facts as they exist. 
 The erroneous conclusions drawn have passed down in literature 
 and become so firmly fixed in the minds of some that it will no doubt 
 take time to shake their belief. The evidence afforded by the ex- 
 posures on Eschscholtz Bay is insufficient to support a claim that 
 any of the ice-beds we know of in Alaska, excluding glaciers, are 
 of Pleistocene age or existed before the mammoth became extinct. 

The latest supporter of the snow-ice supposition — Tolmatschow — 
 gives what he calls a " schematic representation " of the formation 
 of the Beresowka ice from snow as follows : " The large lake 
 through which the Beresowka flowed was filled with silt through 
 which the river now cuts its bed. In winter the whole basin was 
 covered with a thick bed of snow, which in summer disappeared 
 except in those parts which are protected by a layer of loam. For 
 the thinnest layer of such deposits, whether coming from the over- 
 flow of the river, or from the water melting from the mountains, 
 affords a good protection from the summer sun. In our climate 
 (Russia) the snow remains under such conditions up to the middle 
 of summer, it will therefore remain more easily in northern Siberia. 
 In certain cases the snow can remain until winter without any pro- 
 tection, i. e., when it accumulates in great quantities, and this can 
 happen easily in such basins, where not only the fallen snow accu- 
 mulates but also that blown from the nearby mountains. After 
 short summers long winters come again and again. 

" These beds increase, come into contact, melt together, and in 

a long series of years form a thick cover of snow For this 

explanation we need not make any supposition about oscillation of 
 climate, the age of ice, etc., and we may very well suppose that the 
 process is also going on in Siberia now.*^ There is no doubt, that 
 under the present day .conditions of the climate of northern Siberia 
 ice as it has been found on the Beresowka can remain undisturbed 
 for thousands of years if we only exclude the action of its being 
 washed away by the river." 

From his various suppositions about the formation of the Bere- 
 sowka ice Tolmatschow draws the same conclusions as before, i. e., 

" One of the weak points of the snow origin of ice is just this : Why do we 
 not find the process transpiring today? Also, why is the elevated ice only 
 found associated with the Pleistocene lacustrine silts? Why not at varying 
 levels, and resting upon surfaces of different geological formations, etc. 
 The snow ice phenomena we do find today are altogether different from those 
 ice deposits associated with the elevated Pleistocene silts.
