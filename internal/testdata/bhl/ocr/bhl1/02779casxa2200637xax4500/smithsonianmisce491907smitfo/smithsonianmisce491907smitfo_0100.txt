" The cliff in which these fossils appear to have been imbedded is 
 part of the range in which the ice formation was seen in July. Dur- 
 ing our absence (a space of five weeks) we found that the edge of 
 the cliff in one place had broken away four feet, and in another two 
 feet and a half, and a further portion of it was on the eve of being 
 precipitated upon the beach. In some places where the icy shields 
 had adhered to the cliff nothing now remained, and frozen earth 
 formed the front of the cliff. By cutting through those parts of the 
 ice which were still attached, the mud in a frozen state presented 
 itself as before, and confirmed our previous opinion of the nature of 
 the cliff. Without putting to this test, appearances might well have 
 led to the conclusion come to by Kotzebue and 'W. Eschscholtz ; more 
 especially if it happened to be visited early in the summer, and in 
 a season less favorable than that in which we viewed it. The earth, 
 which is fast falling away from the cliffs — not in this place only, 
 but in all parts of the bay — is carried away by the tide. * * * 

" In consequence of this shallow water there was much difficulty in 
 embarking the fossils, the tusks in particular, the largest of which 
 weighed 160 lbs." 

September 25, 1826, page 329. " In another excursion which I 
 made along the north side of the sound, I landed at a cape which had 
 been named after the ship (Blossom), and had the satisfaction of 
 examining an ice formation of a similar nature to that in Eschscholtz 
 Bay, only more extensive and having a contrary aspect. The ice 
 here, instead of merely forming a shield to the cliff, was imbedded in 
 the indentations along its edge, filling them up nearly even with 
 the front. A quantity of fallen earth w-as accumulated at the base 
 of the cliff, which uniting with the earthy spaces intervening be- 
 tween the beds of ice, might lead a person to imagine the ice formed 
 the cliff, and supported a soil two or three feet thick, part of wdiich 
 appeared to have been precipitated over the brow. But on examining 
 it above, the ice was found to be detached from the cliff at the back 
 of it ; and in a few instances so much so, that there were deep chasms 
 between the two. These chasms are no doubt widened by the tend- 
 ency the ice must have towards the edge of the cliff; and I have 
 no doubt the beds of ice are occasionally loosened and fall upon the 
 beach, where, if they are not carried away by the sea, they become 
 covered with the earthly materials from above, and perhaps remain 
 sometime immured. In some places the cliff was undermined, and 
 the surface in general was very rugged ; but it was evident in this, 
 as in the former instance, that the ice was lodged in the hollow places 
 in the cliff."
