also brought the carcasses of reindeer, and have stranded them on 
 the shores where their horns were found. 

" The agency of the same currents to which I have referred the 
 drifting of the carcasses of reindeer into Eschscholtz Bay will also 
 equally explain the presence of recent bones of the musk-ox in this 
 bay on the same shoal with the bones of elephants that had fallen 
 from the cliff. I have already stated that the condition of the skull 
 and horns of a musk-ox, which were brought home with the fossil 
 bones, is so very recent, and differs so essentially from the condition 
 of all the bones of elephants from this place, that it is impossible it 
 can have been buried in the same matrix with them ; for, in such 
 case, all would have been nearly in the same state, either of preser- 
 vation or decay, 

" It is stated by Cuvier," that a similar doubt is attached to the 
 heads of musk-oxen described by Pallas and Ozeretzkovsky, as 
 found near the mouth of the Ob, and at the embouchure of the 
 Yana, and that there is yet no sufficient proof of the existence of 
 any fossil species of musk-ox that may be considered of the same 
 age with the fossil elephant, or which can be brought in evidence 
 as to the question of the climate of the polar regions when these 
 elephants were living. Of the very few remains of musk-oxen 
 which have yet been found, it does not appear that any have been 
 buried at a great depth. 

" There is nothing peculiar to Eschscholtz Bay in the occurrence 
 of bones of horses with those of elephants ; from the number of 
 localities in which their teeth and bones have been found together, 
 in diluvial deposits, it appears that more than one species of horse 
 was co-extensive with the fossil elephant in its occupation of the 
 ancient surface of the earth. Wild horses are at present almost un- 
 known, except in warm or temperate latitudes. 

" We may now consider how far the facts we have collected re- 
 specting the bones in Eschscholtz Bay are in accordance with simi- 
 lar occurrences, either in the adjoining regions to the north, or in 
 other still more distant parts of the earth, and in different latitudes. 

" It is stated by Pallas in the I7lh volume of the New Commen- 
 taries of the Academy of Petersburg, 1772, that throughout the 
 whole of northern Asia, from the Don to the extreme point nearest 
 America, there is scarce any great [607] river in whose banks they 
 do not find the bones of elephants and other large animals which 
 cannot now endure the climate of this district, and that all the fossil
