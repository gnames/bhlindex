Ice-beds on Eschscholtz Bay 91 

the preservation of the carcass in ice : had it been gradual, it might 
 have caused the extinction of the mammoth in the polar regions, 
 but would afford no reason for its equal extirpation in lower lati- 
 tudes ; but if sudden and violent, and attended by a general inunda- 
 tion, the temperature preceding this catastrophe may have been 
 warm, and that immediately succeeding it intensely cold ; and the 
 cause producing this change of climate may also have produced an 
 inundation, sufficient to destroy and bury in its ruins the animal? 
 which then inhabited the surface of the earth."

Kotzebue Sound [p. 169]. — "The bounding shores of Kotzebue 
 Sound for the most part rise by perpendicular cliffs, either directly 
 from the waters or from a shelving beach. In some places the 
 land is remarkably low, and only so much raised as to render the 
 idea probable, that it is an alluvial formation, the result of the accu- 
 mulated mud and sand brought down by large rivers and thrown up 
 by the sea. The cliffs are in part abrupt and rocky ; others are 
 made up of falling masses of mud, sand, and ice. The first, or 
 rocky cliffs, predominate to the southward of a line drawn from the 
 northwest side of Eschscholtz Bay to the southeastern part of the 
 Bay of Good Hope. The second, or diluvial cliffs, complete the re- 
 maining northeast side of the sound, and take in part of the south 
 side of Eschscholtz Bay. Low grounds chiefly border the Bay of 
 Good Hope, and form the land of and around Cape Espenberg. 
 The history of these mud cliffs, and of the remarkable organic re- 
 mains contained in them, has been given in vol. i. Appen- 
 dix [p. 173]. Cape Beaufort, viz., about 300 feet above the level 
 of the sea. This cape seems to constitute a boundary between the 
 hilly ranges above described to the southwest, and the low plains, 
 intersected with lagoons and lakes, which extend to the northeast 
 of it as far as the eye can reach [p. 174]. These plains are the 
 commencement of a country of diluvial formation, that extends 
 from Cape Beaufort to Icy Cape, Reindeer Station, and Wain- 
 wright Inlet. Beyond that Mr. Elson has described the coast and 
 country to be a continuation of the same formations, and at Cape 
 Smyth, near his extreme point, in lat. 71° 13' N., long. 156° 45' W., 
 he observed icy cliffs presenting their fronts under the like circum- 
 stances as at Cape Blossom and in Eschscholtz Bay."
