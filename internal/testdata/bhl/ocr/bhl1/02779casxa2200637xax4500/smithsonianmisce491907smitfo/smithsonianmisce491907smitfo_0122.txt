length of time. The depth to which, in northern countries, the sum- 
 mer thaw penetrates, varies with the nature of the soil, but, except 
 in purely sandy and very porous beds, it nowhere exceeds two feet in 
 American or Siberian lands lying within the Arctic Circle. The 
 influence of the sun's rays is not perceptible at this depth until to- 
 wards the close of summer, which occurs at a varying period of from 
 five to ten weeks from the time that the surface of the earth was 
 denuded of snow by the spring thaw. During the rest of the year, 
 even in the forest lands, though not so long there as in the open 
 barren grounds, or tundras, the soil is firmly and continuously bound 
 up in frost. The thickness of the permanently frozen substratum is 
 more or less influenced by its mineral structure, but is primarily de- 
 pendent on the mean annual temperature of the air acting antagonis- 
 tically to the interior heat of the earth. Unless the mean heat of 
 the year in any given locality falls short of the freezing-point, there 
 exists no perennial frozen substratum in that place. It is not neces- 
 sary that we should here endeavor to trace the isothermal line of 32Â° 
 Farh., as the reader may obtain a correct idea of its general course 
 by consulting Baer's charts. It will suffice to say, that on the con- 
 tinent of America it passes some degrees to the southward of the 
 sixtieth parallel of north latitude, and that while it undulates with 
 the varying elevation of the interior, it has a general rise northwards 
 in its course westerly. 

" Where the permanently frozen subsoil exists it is a perfect ice- 
 cellar, and preserves from destruction the bodies of animals com- 
 pletely enclosed in it. By its intervention entire carcasses of the 
 extinct mammoth and tichorhine rhinoceros have been handed down 
 in arctic Siberia from the drift period to our times, and, being ex- 
 posed by land-slips, have revealed most interesting glimpses of the 
 fauna of that remote epoch. Conjecture fails in assigning a chron- 
 ological date to the time when the drift and bowlders were spread 
 extensively over the northern hemisphere : the calculations that have 
 been made of the ages occupied in the formation of subsequent allu- 
 vial deposits are founded on imperfect data ; and we merely judge 
 from the absence of works of art and of human bones, that the drift 
 era must have been antecedent to the appearance of man upon 
 earth, or at least to his multiplication within the geographical limits 
 of the drift. Whatever may be our speculations concerning the 
 mode in which the carcasses in question were enclosed in frozen 
 gravel or mud, their preservation to present time in a fresh condi- 
 tion indicates that the climate was a rigorous one at the epoch of 
 their entombment and has continued so ever since. Moreover, as
