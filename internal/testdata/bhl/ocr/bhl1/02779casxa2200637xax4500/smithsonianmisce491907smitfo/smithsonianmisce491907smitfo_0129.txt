Ice-beds on Eschscholtz Bay ioi 

still covered with from seven to ten feet of soil. Water was flowing 
 copiously from these walls of ice, and they were transparent, without 
 admixture of earth, while the soil which capped them was dry and 
 friable. In the slope of this ruined cliff most of the fossils obtained 
 on this occasion were found, a few small fragments only having been 
 gathered from the soft mud at its foot. Some were collected from 
 the surface of the slope, others were dug out at places where the tips 
 of the tusks protruded through the soil. 

" A deep valley through which a stream of water flows divides the 
 sixth hill from the preceding one. Portions of this hill had subsided 
 from the melting of the icy foundation, but in one part a solitary 
 block of ice about twenty feet square rose above the surface, retain- 
 ing a thin layer of soil on its summit. From the vicinity of this 
 block the hill rose abruptly on all sides ; its declivity descended 
 without break to the beach, and its soil, except in the section that 
 had sunk, did not appear to have been ever disturbed. The beach at 
 this place was not composed of muddy detritus, like that which 
 skirted the bases of the other cliffs. A mammoth tusk, having been 
 noticed protruding above the surface of the hill, w^as traced down- 
 wards by digging to the depth of eight feet, and the skull with a 
 quantity of hair and wool were found lying on a thin bed of gravel, 
 beneath which was solid transparent ice. Enveloping the bones there 
 was a bed of stiff clay several feet in thickness, and mixed with them 
 a small quantity of sticks and vegetable matter. The superficial 
 soil was loose and dry. A strong, pungent, unpleasant odor, like 
 that of a newly opened grave in one of the crowded burial places of 
 London, was felt on digging out the bones, and the same kind of 
 smell, in a less degree, was perceptible in various other places where 
 the cliffs had fallen. From the same pit out of which the mammoth's 
 skull was dug the bones of some smaller animals (scapula, tibia, etc.) 
 were taken and were duly labelled at the time, but in the course of 
 their transfer from one public department to another, after reaching 
 London, the labels have been lost, together with the specimens of the 
 buried wood, gravel, and other matters found associated with the 
 bones. Dr. Goodridge says that this eminence was the last exam- 
 ined, the approach of night having prevented the party from explor- 
 ing another [p. 8] hill lying between it and Eschscholtz Bluff. That 
 hill, however, was covered with luxuriant vegetation and no icy cliffs 
 showed themselves. 

On Choris Peninsula,' says the same gentleman, ' frozen soil 
 was found at the depth of four feet at the end of September, after 
 an unusually warm summer, and a cask full of flour deposited by
