" July 12, 1884. At half past two p. m. a series of ice-cliffs, like 
 those of Eschscholtz, was observed, composed of a solid mass of ice 
 extending three-quarters of a mile along the left bank, covered by a 
 thin layer of dark-colored earth, and rising to a height of a hundred 
 and fifty feet. Trees were growing on the surface. Up to this 
 point, and for some distance farther, not a single stone or pebble was 
 to be seen, and the silence was frequently disturbed by the fall of 
 large masses of the soft earthy banks vmdermined by the strong 
 currents. * * * At half past four p. m. (July 24th) a remarkable 
 clay bluff, three-quarters of a mile long and a hundred and fifty feet 
 high, was reached on the left bank of the river. Quantities of mam- 
 moth tusks were observed in this clay and its debris where under- 
 mined by the stream."

" One of the most remarkable, in fact the only remarkable feature 
 of the lower river, is the ice formation in the high black bluffs. The 
 recent heavy rains had caused the river to rise to an unusual height, 
 and I observed in many places where the erosion of the flood had 
 exposed vast masses of ice, which had escaped my notice formerly. 
 Change is the order of the day here, and it is no uncommon thing to 
 see, soon after a flood or freshet in the river, masses of earth, upon 
 which trees thirty or forty feet high have grown, suddenly break 
 away and fall with a tremendous roar into the river. I obtained 
 sketches and photographs of these broken bluffs, but no picture can 
 adequately portray the feeling of utter desolation which this destruc- 
 tive work of the ever-rushing river conveys. 

" The constant falling away of the soft earth, leaving the solid 
 ice bare in many places, has given rise to many curious and fantastic 
 formations.
