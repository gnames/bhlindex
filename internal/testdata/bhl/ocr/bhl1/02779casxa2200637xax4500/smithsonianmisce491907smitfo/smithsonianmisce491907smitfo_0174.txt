6 SMITHSONIAN MISCELLANEOUS COLLECTIONS 

the carapax are rather tubercles than spines. In color the body is 
 light reddish above, mottled with white ; below white ; feet whitish, 
 annulated with red. The figure given by Milne Edwards in the 
 "Regne Animal" is less characteristic of our specimens than that of 
 Guerin.

The species of the genus Doclea have great resemblance to each 
 other in the shape and convexity of the carapax and in general 
 appearance. The distinctions rest chiefly on the length of the feet 
 and the proportional size of the lateral and posterior spines. 

In D. gracilipes the body is covered with a short but dense villous 
 coat, while the feet are less villous than is usual. The carapax, 
 when this coating is removed, presents a deep suture or groove sepa- 
 rating the stomachal, genital, and cardiac regions from the hepatic 
 and branchial portions, and passing around behind the cardiac, 
 separating this from the intestinal region. This groove is very 
 deep where it passes the stomachal and genital regions. The me- 
 dian dorsal line is armed with six sharp tubercles, increasing in size 
 posteriorly. The anterior three on the stomachal region are very 
 small ; one at the summit of the genital is larger ; that on the cardiac 
 becomes spiniform ; and the posterior one, on the intestinal region, 
 is still larger, though stout, blunt, and only one-tenth as long as the 
 carapax. Of the four teeth usually described to be on the antero- 
 lateral margin of the carapax, the anterior one belongs to the margin 
 of the pterygostomian region, being at a lower level than the rest; 
 in our species it is somewhat larger than the two following or inter- 
 mediate ones ; the posterior one, forming the extreme lateral spine, 
 is very long (equaling in length more than one-sixth the width of 
 the carapax), sharp, and curved forward. Besides the spines and 
 teeth already mentioned, there are seven or eight slight tubercles on 
 each side at the stomachal and branchial regions, only to be seen 
 after the removal of the villous coat. The postero-lateral slopes are 
 entirely smooth. The rostrum is but little longer than broad, slit 
 for half its length, the horns being sharp. It is longitudinally
