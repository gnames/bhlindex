14 SMITHSONIAN misce;llane;ous collections 

tooth lies close beneath the prseorbital tooth, and helps to form the 
 deep tubular orbit, which encloses the eye as in a sheath. The edges 
 of the rostrum and of the external antennse are, as usual, ciliated; 
 and there are some few crispate setse on the prominent parts of the 
 carapax anteriorly and at the sides. 

In the feet of the anterior pair the carpus and meros are sparingly 
 spinulose above. The ambulatory feet are almost smooth ; those of 
 the first pair in the female are scarcely as long as the carapax. The 
 abdomen in the female is tomentose. 

Two specimens only of this species were found, both females. 
 The dimensions of the largest are : Length of the carapax, 0.79 ; 
 breadth, including spines, 0.57 inch. 

This species occurred at the islands of Ousima and Tanegasima, 
 of the southern Japanese chain.

The Japanese specimens of this species are said by De Haan to 
 differ from the original specimens of Cancer thalia, described by 
 Herbst, in wanting the two spines on the posterior margin of the 
 carapax, and in having a spine on the meros of the ambulatory feet, 
 near its superior extremity. On all of our specimens from the Chi- 
 nese Sea the characters are the same as those found in De Haan's 
 figure and description, while none present the above-mentioned char- 
 acters of C. thalia. Nor do they agree with the description of 
 Herbst's specimen given by Gerstsecker in the Archiv fiir Naturge- 
 schichte, vol. xxii, p. 109. Under these circumstances we have been 
 led to consider the species distinct and to propose a new name for 
 De Haan's crustacean. 

M. thalia Krauss, which inhabits the coast of South Africa, seems 
 also distinct from the Herbstian species.

Body depressed; proportions of the carapax, breadth to length, as 
 I to 1.3; upper surface uneven, crowdedly tuberculated and setose.
