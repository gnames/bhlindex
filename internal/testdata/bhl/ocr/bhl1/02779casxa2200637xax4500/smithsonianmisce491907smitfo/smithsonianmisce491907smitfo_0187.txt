extremities. There are three spines on the median line, two of 
 which are on the gastric region, and one, the largest of all, on the 
 cardiac. A large spine on each side on the branchial region, between 
 which and the postorbital tooth, on the lateral margin, there are 
 nine spines, irregular in size and distance. Posterior margin spin- 
 ulose, three or four spines near the middle being larger than the 
 others. Rostrum inclined at an angle of 45°, and bent at its extrem- 
 ity into the vertical plane ; it is dilated at the extremity, the corners 
 being broadly rounded and minutely crenulated ; at the middle there 
 are two diverging teeth. Ocular peduncles rather short, in length 
 little more than twice their diameter. Orbit with two fissures above, 
 the inner one closed, the outer open, separating the postorbital tooth. 
 The pterygostomian regions are full convex, tuberculated, and not 
 setose. The third joint of the outer maxillipeds is greatly expanded 
 at its antero-exterior angle; the second joint is marked with a longi- 
 tudinal furrow near its outer margin. The basal joint of the outer 
 antennas is very broad; its anterior tooth short, with nearly smooth 
 margin ; second joint oblong, compressed, with the margin ciliated 
 with long hairs. Chelopoda equaling the carapax in length, smooth 
 and glossy, fawn-colored, with white bases ; carpus and hand minutely 
 and obsoletely granulated ; fingers with black tips. Ambulatory feet 
 compressed, thickly hairy ; the meros with a small terminal spine 
 above. Color of the body pale reddish, rendered indistinct by an 
 accumulation of sordes retained by the setae. Dimensions : Length 
 ■of the carapax, 0.75 ; greatest breadth, 0.59 ; distance between tips of 
 postorbital teeth, 0.45 ; length of first pair of ambulatory feet, 0.86 
 inch. 

Specimens of this species w'ere dredged on a muddy bottom in six 
 fathoms, in the harbor of Sidney, or Port Jackson, Australia.

The following description is drawn up from specimens preserved 
 in spirits ; it may be useful, as Dana's specimens were dried. The 
 "body is moderately depressed; carapax minutely and somewhat un- 
 ■equally tuberculated above, without spines, except a small one at the 
 branchial region on each side, and a marginal one in front of this ; 
 these are continuous with the series of teeth on the antero-lateral 
 margin. The posterior margin is denticulated with granular tuber-
