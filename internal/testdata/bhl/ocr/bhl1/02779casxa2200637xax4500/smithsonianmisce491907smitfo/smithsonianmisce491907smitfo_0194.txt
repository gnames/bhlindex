longitudinal, minutely nodulose ridges on its upper surface ; between 
 them there is a small tooth or point projecting downward, formed 
 by the emargination. In our specimen the postorbital tooth seems 
 less strong than in Milne Edwards's figure (Hist. Nat. des Crust., 
 pi. XV, figs. 15, 16), and there are no warts on the gastric region.

 The following description is taken from an adult male : Carapax, 
 triangular; proportion of breadth to length, 1:1.8; regions suffi- 
 ciently prominent ; surface smooth and slightly pubescent, without 
 spines. A small, flattened, wing-like projection at the hepatic 
 region. Rostrum as long as broad, with bilobate extremity ; its 
 upper surface two longitudinal convexities corresponding to the 
 deeply excavated fossae below. External antennae hair-like, longer 
 than the body. Peduncles of the eyes smooth. Chelopoda very 
 large, resembling considerably those of Myctiris; they are somewhat 
 longer than the body ; meros much swollen and larger than the hand, 
 with two granulated ridges below and one above, the latter bearing 
 also two small spines ; carpus with a -small tubercle or spine at the 
 summit near its articulation with the meros ; there are a few rather 
 long hairs at the inner angles of the carpus and meros ; hand some- 
 what curved, with the fingers small, slender, compressed, and curved, 
 touching each other throughout the length of their denticulated inner 
 edges. The chelopoda are separated below at their bases by a wide 
 depressed space. Ambulatory feet exceedingly slender ; those of the 
 first pair longest and nearly three times as long as the body. Feet 
 of the last two pairs with much-curved falciform dactyli ; the penult
