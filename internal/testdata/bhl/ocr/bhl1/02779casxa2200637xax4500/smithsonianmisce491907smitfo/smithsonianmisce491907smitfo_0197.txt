CRUSTACEA NORTH PACIFIC EXPLORING EXPEDITION 2T, 

not concealed beneath the rostrum ; basal joint lateral, or in a vertical 
 plane, with a small spine at the inferior face. Antennulary fossze 
 large and wide. Eyes saliant, with a sharp minute spine at the 
 summit. Chelopoda in the female and young male hairy and some- 
 what spinous ; meros with a long spine at the summit ; carpus with 
 two spines ; hand much curved, fingers forming half the length of the 
 hand and denticulated within. Ambulatory feet slender, rather 
 smooth, with a few scattered hairs ; a strong spine af the summit of 
 the meros in each pair. Dactyli of the posterior two pairs of feet 
 falciform, as in the genus Achceus. Color, brick-red. Dimensions 
 of a female : Length of carapax, 0.61 ; breadth, 0.35 ; length of ros- 
 trum, 0.19; of first pair of ambulatory feet, 1.75 inches. 

It has considerable resemblance to S. phalangium in many of its 
 characters, but the two large dorsal spines at once distinguish it. 
 The term'.nal j:iits of ths \\^'i two p .irs of feet are falciform, a 
 character not to be found in diagnoses of the genus, but we may ob- 
 serve a strong approach to this form in the posterior dactyli of 
 S. phalangium and some other species. 

Taken among sea weeds, etc., in 12 fathoms, on a sandy bottom, in 
 Simons Bay, Cape of Good Hope.

This species was dredged in 30 fathoms ofif the south side of 
 Madeira. It is found on the shores of Florida and the West Indies, 
 and is said by Brulle to occur at the Canary Islands.

 fig. I. 

Our specimens agree well with those of Dana, except that in the 
 male the pincers are much smaller and less gaping, while the size of 
 the carapax is the same ; this may, however, result from a difiference 
 of age and development. 

Taken from branches of Madrepora, found below low-water mark 
 near Hilo, Island of Plawaii.
