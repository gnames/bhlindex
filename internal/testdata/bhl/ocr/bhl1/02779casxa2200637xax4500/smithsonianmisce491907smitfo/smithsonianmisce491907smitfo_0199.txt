This species would seem scarcely to differ from M. monoceros, 
 judging from Riippell's figure, which is a fair representation of 
 some of our Chinese specimens. But the members of this genus are 
 greatly variable and a great number of specimens is required for 
 their accurate determination. 

It was taken by the expedition at Hongkong, China, and at the 
 Amakirrima Islands. 

It is also reported from the Philippine, Fiji, and Samoan Islands.

This species has much resemblance to M. subserratus, but the Idt- 
 â– eral teeth and the tubercles of the dorsal surface are much more 
 prominent than in any specimens of that species which have come 
 under our notice. The following description is taken from an adult 
 male: Proportion of breadth of carapax to length, i : 1.5. Depres- 
 sions between the regions deep. The cardiac region is very prom- 
 inent and ample, occupying one-third the width of the carapax. 
 Lateral teeth sharp and subtriangular ; the two teeth on the antero- 
 lateral margin prominent, projecting well over the sides of the cara- 
 pax, and bilobate, wnth the anterior lobe smallest. The two tubercles 
 on the gastric region are sharply protuberant and covered in front 
 with crispate setae. The surface is elsewhere clean, with the excep- 
 tion of a slight pubescence on the sides and a dense pilosity on the 
 rostrum. Interorbital space rather harrow, very smooth and flat, 
 with the exception of the bituberculate anterior extremity of the gas- 
 tric region. Rostrum rather long, curving a little upward toward the 
 extremity. Praeorbital teeth very long, pointing forward in a longi- 
 tudinal direction. Chelopoda large ; the hand rather compressed ;
