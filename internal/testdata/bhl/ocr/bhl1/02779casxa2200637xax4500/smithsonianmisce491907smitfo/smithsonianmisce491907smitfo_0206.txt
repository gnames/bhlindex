30 SxMlTHSONIAN MISCELLANEOUS COLLECTIONS 

concave above ; rostrum subtriangular and pointed, with its sides a 
 little concave. Surface of hectognathopoda and of the pterygos- 
 toniian regions roughly granulated. Chelopoda with strong, acute, 
 granulated teeth along the keels; teeth varying in size, eleven on 
 the outer and ten on the inner keel of the hand ; upper surface of 
 meros and hand also with two intermediate rows of granulated 
 tubercles, either subspiniform or rounded. Infero-interior surface 
 of chelopoda also tuberculated ; the tubercles small, flattened, ar- 
 ranged in three or four longitudinal rows. Ambulatory feet very 
 small and weak, compressed, and spinous above ; spines in three 
 rows, one at each edge and one along the middle of the upper sur- 
 face; dactyli smooth. Dimensions of the single specimen found, a 
 male : Length of carapax, 0.66 ; breadth between tips of lateral teeth, 
 0.8; breadth excluding these teeth, 0.67; between elbows of chelo- 
 poda, 1.8; length of hand, 0.8 inch. 

The species is found living in company with L. laciniatus, to 
 which it has considerable resemblance, but the character of the very 
 numerous tubercles on the surface of the carapax and arms will 
 serve to distinguish it. 

Taken in 15 fathoms, on a bottom of shelly mud, near Hongkong, 
 China.

In this species the carapax is smaller, with less lateral expansion 
 and greater convexit}^ than in any yet described. These and other 
 points in its general appearance indicate an approach to Lanibrus. 

Carapax triangular; proportion of length to breadth, 1:1.45. 
 Lateral angles truncated. Front concave along the median line ; 
 rostrum of the usual form, and nearly horizontal, but blunt and 
 smoothly rounded at the extremity. The antero-lateral margin is 
 concave behind the orbit, there being a slight contraction at the 
 hepatic region ; behind this point the margin is waved to o. minute 
 tooth at the anterior end of the lateral truncation, and crenulated, 
 the crenulations about nine in number. The posterior margin is 
 straight and obsoletely crenulated. 

The upper surface of the carapax is strongly convex across the 
 branchial regions, the posterior slope being nearly perpendicular 
 and covered on the sides with depressed tubercles. Cardiac region 
 convex, but not rising so high as the branchial region on either side.
