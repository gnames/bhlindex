The large basal joint (basiocerite) of the external antenna in this 
 genus is not soldered to the adjacent parts, but is movable as in 
 Ccratocarcinus. This adds another character to those mentioned by 
 De Haan as approximating it to the Parthenopidse. The two genera 
 are also similar in their short and broad epistome, and the ridges of 
 the palate. Future researches may indicate that they, with one or 
 two other genera, form a group distinct from both Parthenopidcc 
 and Cancridcc.

Genus CERATOCARCINUS Adams and White 

Dana was the first to give the essential characters of this genus,, 
 and to point out the remarkable fact that the basal joint of the an- 
 tennae is not soldered to the adjacent parts, as in other genera of 
 Parthenopidge, and, in fact, almost all Brachyura. This observation: 
 we are enabled to confirm from examination of full-grown speci- 
 mens. The joint is flattened, and, fitting closely in the cavity which 
 receives it, does not interrupt the general surface ; so that it is only 
 by the application of force that its mobility is discovered. The 
 "coxocerite" containing the organ of hearing is very small and placed 
 close below the basal joint. The eyes are retractile. 

Harrovia of Adams and White agrees in all essential characters 
 with Ceratocarcinus. In the orbits, antennse, gnathopoda, and in 
 general appearance they are nearly the same. In their diagnosis of 
 Harrovia the authors do not even mention the characters which arc 
 of most importance in a generic point of view, their description 
 being confined to details of shape, granulation of surface, dentition 
 of margin, etc. Why they should place the crab among the Lciico- 
 sidce it would be difificult to decide.
