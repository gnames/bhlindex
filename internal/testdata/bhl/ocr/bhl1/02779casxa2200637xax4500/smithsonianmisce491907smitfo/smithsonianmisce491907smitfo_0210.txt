 221 [28]. 1857- 

This species is of a soft structure and somewliat translucent in 
 life, the shell being very thin. Surface everywhere pubescent. 
 Color yellowish-brown. 

It is verv closely allied to O. araiica De Haan, but seems to differ 
 in the more slender penultimate joints of the first and second pairs 
 of ambulatory feet ; the hair on the feet generally is much longer ; 
 the rostrum is more deeply emarginated, and the carapax is more 
 expanded at the hepatic regions behind the eyes. From O. iicptitnus 
 Adams and White it differs in the more slender terminal and pciuil- 
 timate joints of the ambulatory feet. 

The dimensions of a male are : Length of carapax, 0.48 ; breadth 
 posteriorly, 0.36; length of ambulatory foot of first pair, 1.45 inches.

Geniis CAXCER (Linmeus) Leach 

The reasons given by r>ell- for following Leach in applying the 
 Limiaean name for all crabs to the group called Platycorciinis by 
 Milne Edwards are good, and the name is thus used bv most recent 
 carcinologists. 

The geographical range of the genus is in the cold temperate zone, 
 and not the "hotter parts of America," as stated by Bell. The spe- 
 cies are mostly American, two being found on the northeastern coast 
 of the United States, four on that of Oregon and California, and 
 three on that of Chili. Of the two other known species, one in- 
 habits the shores of Great Britain, the other those of New Zealand.
