CRUSTACEA NORTH PACIFIC EXPLORIN'G EXPEDITION' 'i^J 

lateral margin with five teeth, including the angle of the orbit ; teeth 
 rather prominent, with small, sharp apices ; interspaces granulated. 
 Chelopoda of moderate size, nearly smooth ; upper surface of carpus 
 and hand somewhat rough in the female ; a small tooth at the inner 
 angle of the carpus. Ambulatory feet compressed, and thickly 
 fringed with hair on their edges ; terminal joints rough, w^ith spini- 
 form granules, especially on the outer surface. Dimensions of a 
 male: Length of carapax, 0.57; breadth. 0.84; of a female, length, 
 0.64 ; breadth, 0.92 inch. 

It is allied to E. Iccvlmanus of Randall and Dana, but is smaller, 
 with the carapax more convex and the ambulatory feet more hairy. 
 In our species the process from the basal joint of the antennae quite 
 reaches the orbit, while in H. lavimanns this is almost entirely ex- 
 cluded from the orbit. 

Found at Simoda. Japan, under stones and among gravel in the 
 littoral zone.

Found at Tahiti. Tliis and some other large kinds of Crustacea 
 are taken by the natives on the reefs at night. The light of a fire 
 placed at the end of a long beam which projects from the bow of the 
 canoe enables the fisherman to see the crabs out on their nocturnal 
 predatory excursions. During the daytime they remain quiescent 
 in their hiding places among the rocks. 

According to Dana this species occurs also at the Paumotu, Rar- 
 aka, Xavigators, and Philippine Islands.

The coloration is the same in all of the numerous specimens col- 
 lected by the expedition, and differs from that represented in Dana's 
 figure in the deeper hue of the reddish clouds, which also extend to 
 the margin. There are two conspicuous deep red blotches on the 
 gastric region, which are confluent behind and send oflf a branch on 
 either side reaching to the orbit. A red patch on the hand, one on
