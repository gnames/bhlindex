Var. e, TYPICUS 

A variety which may be considered typical, agreeing perfectly 
 with Milne Edwards's original description, and showing in a mod- 
 erate degree nearly all the characters which are excessively de- 
 veloped in other varieties. It differs from the var. latifrons in its 
 narrower front and somewhat gaping pincers. 

Found at Ousima, and at other islands in the Chinese and Japanese 
 seas-

 strongly projecting and acuminate (i. e., with concave sides), the 
 anterior ones sharper than usual. Front narrow, not much pro- 
 truded, deeply sinuous, almost quadridentate. Chelopoda stout, 
 rugulose; fingers black, somewhat gaping, not strongly toothed 
 within. Ambulatory feet as in var. pictus, but more hairy- Dimen- 
 sions : Length, 0.532; breadth, 0.8 inch.

Var. g, CUPULIFER 
 Pl.\te VI, Fig. 8 

Carapax as in var. acutidcns except that the edges of the areolets

Pl.ate VI, Fig. 9 

Carapax very broad. Antero-lateral teeth strongly prominent,

 lated. Surface smooth posteriorly. Areolets not prominent ; their 
 surfaces minutely granulose and sHghtly hairy. The transverse 
 raised line connecting the lateral teeth is distinct, and strongly 
 granulose at the point where it bifurcates to form the supplementary 
 tooth. Front narrow, strongly sinuous, or quadridentate ; somewhat 
 protruded. Chelopoda transversely rugulose, and minutely granu-
