CRUSTACEA NORTH PACIFIC EXPLORING EXPEDITION 57 

are broad, very slightly projecting; the posterior two angular with 
 their posterior sides six times as long as their anterior sides. Front 
 of moderate width; the interorbital breadth being more than half 
 the width of the carapax. Surface of chelopoda minutely rugulose. 
 Pincers black ; the black color of the thumb not extending on to the 
 hand ; teeth of inner margins strong. /\mbulatory feet as in the 
 typical variety of C. exaratus, but less hairy. The abdomen is also 
 as in the last mentioned species. 

Color light reddish. Dimensions of a male : Length of carapax, 
 0.43 ; breadth, 0.65 inch. 

The description is taken from a Chinese specimen. Those from 
 the Japanese islands agree more exactly with Dana's description, 
 and a comparison with the original specimens shows them to be the 
 same. 

This may finally prove to be a smooth variety of C. exaratus. 
 The specimens all show a system of rugosities upon the chelopoda 
 of the same kind as in that species, although so nearly obsolete that 
 the surface appears smooth. But the present indications, partic- 
 ularly the want of prominence in the antero-lateral teeth, lead us to 
 consider the form specifically distinct. 

It was taken by us on the coast of China, near Hongkong, under 
 stones on coarse sand, at low- water mark; also at Ousipia and 
 Kikaisima. 

76. CHLORODIUS CAVIPES ' Dana 

Chlurodins cavipcs Dana, U. S. Exploring Expedition, Crust, i, 212, pi. 
 XII, fig. I. 

In some of our specimens the superior crest of the meros in the 
 ambulatory feet is bifurcated near the outer extremity, enclosing an 
 additional small triangular cavity. 

This species approaches Act codes in form, and is one of the con- 
 necting links between the Chlorodinze and the Zozymin?e. It might 
 well be generically separated from a genus containing such forms as 
 C. ungulatus and monticulosus. 

Taken at Port Lloyd, Bonin Islands. 

Genus PILODIUS Dana 

In this genus the outer margin of the orbit is more nearly entire 
 than in any other belonging to the group.
