58 SMITHSONIAN MISCELLANEOUS COLLECTIONS 

77. PILODIUS NIGROCRINITUS Stimpson 

Plate VI J, Fig. i 

Pilodiiis nigrucrinitits Stimpson, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila.. x, p. 34 
 [32], 1858. 

The entire upper surface of the body and feet is covered with 
 short setae, among which many of a black color are conspicuously 
 distributed; there are also longer ones of a yellow color sparingly 
 interspersed. Carapax broad, well areolated ; separating grooves 
 deep. Surface of areolets somewhat scabrous. Antero-lateral mar- 
 gin convex, teeth slightly prominent, rounded and denticulated. 
 The front is less prominent than usual and its median emargination 
 is inconspicuous. In the chelopoda the carpus and hand are rough 
 with spiniform granules. In the ambulatory feet the meros is ser- 
 rated above. 

One specimen only was taken, a female, the dimensions of which 
 are: Length of carapax, 0.28; breadth, 0.41 inch; ratio, i : 1.46. 

It is closely allied to P. pilmmwidcs, but is broader ; the antero- 
 lateral margin is convex instead of concave, and its denticulated 
 teeth are rounded, having no central principal denticle, and there is 
 no tooth at the inferior extremity of the penult joint of the feet. It 
 is not improbably the same as P. pilunDioides Dana, but cannot be 
 that of Adams and White. 

Taken at Simoda, Japan. 

78. PILODIUS GRANULATUS Stimpson 

Plate VII, Fig. 2 

Pilodius grannlatus Stimpson, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., x, p. 34 [32], 
 1858. 

Carapax broad ; proportion of length to breadth in the male, 
 I : 1.5. Antero-lateral margin a little shorter than the postero- 
 lateral. Upper surface of carapax well areolated ; surface of areo- 
 lets strongly granulated or tuberculated and pubescent. Teeth of 
 the antero-lateral margin four in number, excluding the angle of the 
 orbit. They are small, denticulated, and acute (particularly the first 
 one), the median denticle in each being sharply prominent and 
 curving forward. Front, orbits, etc., nearly as in P. pnhcscciis and 
 pilnmnoides. Chelopoda tuberculated ; carpus armed with sharp 
 tubercles rather larger than those of the hand, and with two small, 
 very sharp teeth or spines at its inner angle ; hand with tubercles
