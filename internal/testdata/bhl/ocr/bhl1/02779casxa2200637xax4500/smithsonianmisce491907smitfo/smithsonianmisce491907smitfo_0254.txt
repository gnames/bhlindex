70 SMITHSONIAN MISCELLANEOUS COLLECTIONS 

The carapax of the specimen taken at Ousima is more swollen 
 than that of the others, and less hairy ; there are a few tufts of long 
 hairs, 4 or 6 to each tuft ; two on the gastric region are most con- 
 spicuous. 

De Haan's description of his P. viintitiis (Fauna Japonica, Crust., 
 p. 50) applies very well to our species; but his figure (pi. iii, fig. 2) 
 is by no means a good representation of it. The body in that figure 
 is smooth, the feet very slender and little hairy. The postero-lateral 
 margin is represented as convex, while it is rather concave in our 
 species. 

Dredged in the Northern China Sea, from a shelly bottom in 
 twentv fathoms. Also found among dead corals taken from a sandy 
 bottom in 30 fathoms of the east coast of Ousima. A single speci- 
 men probably of this species was taken at the Bonin Islands.

Body and feet pilose above and below ; hairs soft and flex- 
 ible, entangling sordes ; feet more densely covered than the carapax. 
 Carapax transverse; proportion of length to breadth, i: 1.3; areo- 
 late, areolets not protuberant ; surface glossy except at the rough- 
 nesses from which the hairs arise. Surface above the front covered 
 with minute asperities. Postero-lateral surface granulated. Antero- 
 lateral and supraorbital margins raised or crested, the former with 
 three teeth besides the angle of the orbit, the first of which is largest 
 and less acute than the others. Median lobes of front very broad 
 and even, not projecting. Outer and upper surface of hands, be- 
 neath the pilose covering, rugose with minute asperities and gran- 
 ules ; carpus less rough ; a small tooth at inner angle of carpus in the 
 smaller chelopod. Dimensions of a male : Length of carapax, 0.275 J 
 breadth, 0.355 inch. 

Found at Loo Choo.

This globose species has almost the aspect of a Droniia, the short 
 feet of the posterior pair being turned up over the back, fitting into
