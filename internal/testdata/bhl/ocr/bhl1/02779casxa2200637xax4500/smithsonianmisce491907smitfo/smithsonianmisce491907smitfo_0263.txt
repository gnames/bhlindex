Carapax convex : proportion of length to breadth in the male, 
 I : 1.8. Superior surface pubescent, and transversely marked with 
 raised, granulated lines or narrow ridges. Three of these lines 
 cross the gastric region ; the foremost interrupted at the middle ; the 
 second traversing the whole extent of the region ; the posterior 
 one shortest, and placed in the same line with the foremost ridges of 
 the branchial region. Two short ridges on the posterior portion of 
 the branchial region. Cardiac region somewhat prominent, with an 
 interrupted transverse ridge, behind which its surface is granulated. 
 Antero-lateral margin with nine sharp teeth, including the angle of 
 the orbit ; posterior tooth about twice as long as the next. Frontal 
 margin with a median fissure, and four equal subtriangular teeth, 
 the median ones very slightly more prominent than the lateral ones. 
 Eyes very large, globular. Upper margin of orbit with two fissures, 
 with an inconspicuous tooth at the outer one, which is considerably 
 removed from the outer angle of the orbit. Inferior fissure of orbit 
 very large. Chelopoda pubescent, elongated in the male ; meros 
 broad and thick, narrowing toward the carpus, its upper surface 
 scabrous, with a longitudinal ridge parallel to the posterior margin : 
 anterior margin of meros with four teeth or spines, posterior margin 
 with two spines the outer one terminal, inner one placed far within 
 and connected with the longitudinal ridge ; carpus slender, two- 
 spined ; hand very slender with prominent longitudinal granulated 
 ridges or costae and three sharp spines above, two of which are
