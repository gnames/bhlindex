 Thalamita sima AIilne Edwards, Hist. Nat. des Crust., i, 460. 

The description of T. sima given by Milne Edwards is very short, 
 and it is by no means certain that the species here referred to is the 
 same. 

The following description is taken from a large male, one of the 
 very numerous specimens collected by the expedition at Hongkong. 
 The proportion of length to breadth in the carapax is i : 1.65. Upper 
 surface moderately convex at the middle and posteriorly, pubescent 
 and marked wath several transverse granulated lines. Interorbital 
 front equaling half the width of the carapax and simply emarginated 
 as in T. admete, but advanced a little at the median notch. Antero- 
 lateral margin more or less oblique and armed with five sharp teeth, 
 including the angle of the orbit; the fifth or posterior tooth larger; 
 the fourth a little smaller than the rest. Hectognathopoda and ptery- 
 gostomian regions pubescent. Chelopoda large, strongly spinose 
 and squamose ; the subsquamiform transverse ridges, with granu- 
 lated and pubescent margins, are shorter and more irregular above
