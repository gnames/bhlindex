who compares it with T. admctc, to which species Dana's crab ap- 
 proximates much more closely than that of Riippell. 

The German naturalist seems to have priority in the use of the 
 term crciiata, for, although he refers to Latreille for the name, we 
 can nowhere find a description by the latter author.

Easily distinguished from T. crcnata by the granulous and costate 
 outer surface of the hand and the more deeply cut teeth of the front. 
 It approaches more closely T. crassiiiiaiia Dana (pryinna De Haan). 
 The crest of the basal joint of the antennae projects beyond the 
 frontal margin. 

Color in life dark purplish-red or brick-red above, much lighter 
 below. 

Found under stones on coarse sandy ground, above low-water 
 mark, in the harbor of Hongkong, China.

This is a small, prettily-colored species, of which two specimens 
 only were obtained. The proportion of length to breadth in the 
 carapax of the male is i : 1.58. Upper surface pubescent and 
 marked with transverse raised lines arranged as in T. dance, the lat- 
 eral lobes of the anterior set of lines on the gastric region being 
 behind the median ones, and not in the same range as in T. crassi- 
 mana. Antero-lateral margin a little oblique, five-toothed, including 
 the angle of the orbit, the fourth tooth much smaller than the fifth, 
 which nearly equals the third in size. Frontal margin a little promi- 
 nent at the middle and deeply crenated, with six lobes (excluding the 
 prgeorbital teeth), the median two lobes small and rounded, the next 
 ones broad, the external ones small and pointed. Basal joint of ex- 
 ternal antennae with a short, sharply compressed, smooth-edged 
 laminiform crest, the middle portion of which projects beyond the 
 front. Chelopoda squamose and pubescent above ; spines nearly as 
 in T. dancv; spine at inner angle of carpus very long; hand costate
