abundant than adults, and were taken with the dredge in 4 fathoms, 
 weedy sand. 

In the time of Steller a species of Cheirogoniis was so abundant 
 in Avatcha Bay (Kamchatka) that it formed a common article of 
 food among the inhabitants. At the present time, however, it has 
 entirely or nearly disappeared, as we did not succeed in obtaining a 
 specimen ; nor do the naturalists of Beechey's voyage mention having 
 found it. 

Genus NAUTILOCORYSTES Milne Edwards 

The name Dicera, proposed for this genus by De Haan and re- 
 tained by Krauss and Dana, was published before that of Milne 
 Edwards. The name given by the latter naturalist is, however, 
 retained, as Dicera was several times preoccupied as a generic term 
 in zoology, and once among the Articulates.

Genus PILUMNOPLAX Stimpson 

This genus was instituted for a group of small Carcinoplacidse 
 having much the aspect of Piluuinus in their shape and frequent 
 setose covering, but easily distinguished by the depressed form and 
 great posterior breadth of the carapax as well as by the character of 
 the male organs. The antero-lateral margin is very short ; the eyes 
 and orbits very small and rounded. The facial and oral members 
 are nearly as in PiUimnns. The basal joint of the antennae is mov- 
 able, and does not reach the frontal margin. The meros-joint of the 
 external maxillipeds is nearly square. The palate is on each side 
 divided by a ridge more or less distinct. The chelipeds are generally 
 short. The ambulatory feet are long and slender, those of the pe- 
 nultimate pair usually the longest; the dactyli flattened, and in the
