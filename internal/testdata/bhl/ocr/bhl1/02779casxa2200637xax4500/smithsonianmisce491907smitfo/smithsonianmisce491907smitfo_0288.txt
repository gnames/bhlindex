 Macrophthahnus scrratus \\'hite, Voy. Samarang, Crust., p. 51. 

Our species agrees pretty well with White's description of his M. 
 serratus, but as no figure of that species is given and as the descrip- 
 tion itself is short and unsatisfactory we do not consider the identifi- 
 cation as certain. 

In our specimens the carapax is broader posteriorly than at the 
 angles of the orbits. Proportion of length to breadth, i : 1.4. Sur- 
 face granulose, with the exception of a smooth space at the middle 
 of the gastric region. Lateral margin quadridentate, the small 
 fourth or posterior tooth being only the anterior extremity of a 
 slight crest which margins the posterior third of the side. Ambula- 
 tory feet not pectinated, but villous, the hair short and soft. It dif- 
 fers from M . siuipUcipcs in the want of tubercles on the carapax, and 
 from M. affinis in being narrower anteriorly and having a more 
 strongly dentate margin. Living specimens were brownish or dust- 
 colored above, white below. The dimensions of a male are: Length 
 of carapax, 0.85; breadth, 1.19 inches. 

A small Lepas is found in considerable numbers upon the feet of 
 this species. 

It was dredged in abundance on muddy bottoms, in 4 to 10 fath- 
 oms, in and near the harbor of Hongkong.

Macrophthahnus dcntatus Stimpson. Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila.. x. p. 97- 
 [43]. 1858. 

Carapax broad, length to breadth as i : 1.67. Upper surface naked,, 
 uneven, but smooth and glossy, except toward the postero-lateral 
 angle, where there are two slightly raised, plicated longitudinal ridges. 
 Lateral margin armed with teeth nearly throughout its length ; teeth 
 four in number, small, except the anterior one, which forms the angle 
 of the orbit and is long and acute. Front very narrow. Eyes long,, 
 but falling short of the extremity of the orbital angle. Chelipeds 
 angular, but everywhere smooth and glossy ; fingers short ; immova- 
 ble finger very short, armed within by a large triangular tooth at the 
 middle, which bears a denticle on its anterior side ; dactylus with a 
 tooth at the base and another small but well-separated one near the
