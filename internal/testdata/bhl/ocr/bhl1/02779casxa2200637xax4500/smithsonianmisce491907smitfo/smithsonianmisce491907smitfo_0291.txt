CRUSTACEA NORTH PACIFIC EXPLORING EXPEDITION 97 

base. Ambulator}' feet smootb, scarcely at all hairy; meros with a 
 small spine near its superior extremity. 

The color in life is bluish-gray with darker mottlings ; below white. 
 Dimensions of the carapax in a male: Length, 0.31 ; breadth between 
 tips of orbital angles or teeth, 0.52 inch. 

This crab, like some of its congeners, feigns death when caught, 
 remaining perfectly quiescent, with its feet outstretched, as if in 
 asphyxia. 

It is found on mud bottoms, in 6 fathoms, in the bays near Hong- 
 kong.

Macroplitliahnus convexus Stimpson, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., x, 
 p. 97 [43], 1858. 

Carapax broadest at the external angles of the orbits, convex, 
 especially posteriorly; length to breadth as i : 1.74. Surface smooth 
 and glossy, except toward the lateral margins, where it is somewhat 
 granulose. Regions distinct. Two granulous protuberances in a 
 longitudinal line on the branchial region near the postero-lateral 
 corners of the carapax. Sides crested, with two emarginations an- 
 teriorly, the posterior one inconspicuous. Tooth forming the angle 
 of the orbit sharply prominent. Orbits somewhat oblique ; inferior 
 margin serrated. Hands and fingers pilose within. The fingers 
 each bear a tooth on the inner margin near the base, as in M. paciH- 
 cus. Ambulatory feet smooth ; tooth near summit of meros very 
 small. Male organs long and slender. 

Dimensions of the male specimen, which is perhaps immature : 
 Length of carapax, 0.34 ; breadth, 0.59 inch. 

Found at Loo Choo.

Found at Loo Choo. 

Genus CH^NOSTOMA Stimpson 

The chief character of the genus CIcistostonia. as understood by 
 Dana, is found in the large relative size of the meros-joint of the ex- 
 ternal maxillipeds, which nearly equals the ischium in length. Li
