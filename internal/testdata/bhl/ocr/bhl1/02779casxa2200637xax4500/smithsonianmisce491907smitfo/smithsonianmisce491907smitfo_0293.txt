filled by the palpi of the outer maxillipeds. There is no piliferous 
 crest on the outer maxillipeds, which are rather broad and gaping, so 
 as to leave a rhomboidal space between; the meros- joint is but little 
 longer than broad. Chelipeds robust, smooth externally, hairy 
 within ; hand very thick, and about three-fourths as broad as long, 
 with glossy outer surface ; fingers short, acute ; dactylus armed with 
 a strong tooth at the middle of the inner edge ; immovable finger 
 minutely crenulated on the inner edge. Ambulatory feet compressed, 
 slightly canaliculated above, nearly smooth ; meros- joint very hairy, 
 the other joints almost naked. Abdomen sufficiently broad, oblong, 
 not much tapering, seven- jointed; third joint swollen on each side of 
 the median line. Dimensions of carapax : Length, 0.26 ; breadth, 
 0.341 inch. 

The above description includes some generic characters, but is 
 given in full for the better illustration of the genus. 

A single specimen was taken at Loo Choo.

One specimen only, a male, of this species was collected, of which 
 the following is a description. Carapax small in proportion to the 
 length and size of the limbs. Proportion of length to breadth, 
 I : 1.33. The greatest breadth is across the middle. Surface some- 
 what uneven, but glossy and punctate about the middle and anterior 
 portions. There are two conspicuous areolets on each side, marked 
 off by transverse depressions arising from the lateral fissures. On 
 the postero-lateral slope the surface is pubescent and marked with 
 two strise or raised lines proceeding from marginal fissures ; the an- 
 terior stria transverse, the posterior one oblique. Front very broad. 
 Frontal region deeply and broadly excavated longitudinally along the 
 middle. Lateral margin three-notched, the first or anterior notch 
 very deep, separating a strong tooth, which is somewhat turned up ; 
 the other notches very slight. Eyes stout, of moderate length. Infra- 
 orbital margin seven-lobed, lobes rounded, smooth, glossy, decreasing 
 in size outwardly, the innermost lobe being the largest and most pro- 
 jecting, somewhat curving downward. Epistome ample, convex. 
 Antero-inferior regions granulated and sulcated near the mouth, 
 pubescent near the lateral margins. Beneath the infraorbital margin 
 the sulcus is very deep, and under the internal lobe of this margin 
 there is a deep cavity. External maxillipeds rhomboidally gaping, 
 profoundly sulcated, making the inner oblique piliferous crest very
