CRUSTACEA NORTH PACIFIC EXPLORING EXPEDITION Id 

acute raised line or crest, which bifurcates at about the middle, the 
 inferior fork, which is most prominent, passing to the base of the 
 second pair of ambulatory feet, while the superior fork, which is 
 more distinctly setose, passes to the base of the last pair. The sur- 
 face of the carapax is indistinctly areolated, smooth and glossy along 
 the median line, but toward the lateral margins somewhat uneven, 
 with transverse tuberculated and setose lines ; the tubercles not very 
 conspicuous, but more so in some specimens than in others. Frontal 
 region longitudinally furrowed at the middle. The corners of the 
 front are dilated a little beneath the bases of the eye-peduncles. 
 Latero-inferior regions not sulcated, but evenly covered with fine 
 setiferous granules. Chelipeds rather large ; hand smooth ; fingers 
 deflexed. slender, as long as the palm and curved inward as in 
 Hclcccius, with somewhat excavated extremities ; dactylus with a 
 strong tooth near the middle. Ambulatory feet partly tomentose 
 and setose above: meros-joint in the first and second pairs denselv 
 tonientose on the posterior face. 

Color dark brownish-olive above, bluish-white below ; feet paler ; 
 chelipeds reddish ; fingers in the male white. Dimensions of a male : 
 Length of carapax, 0.27; breadth, 0.415 inch. 

Found at Whampoa, China, along the banks of the Canton River 
 (brackish water), living in holes in the mud, exposed at low water.

Genus DOTILLA Stimpson 

The name Doto, originally proposed for this genus by De Haan, 
 was previously used, as long ago as 181 5, by Oken for a genus of 
 nudibranchiate mollusks. A new designation was therefore pro- 
 posed in the Proceedings of the Philadelphia Academv for April, 
 1858.

The chelopoda in this species are greatly elongated. The com- 
 pressed meros-joint of the ambulatory feet is dilated and bears a very 
 large oblong tympanum or membranaceous disk. The fourth joint 
 of the male abdomen has an abrupt, setose extremity, somewhat like 
 that of the penult joint in Myctiris. 

Our specimen was taken in Caspar Straits by Mr. Squires, of the 
 steamer "John Hancock."
