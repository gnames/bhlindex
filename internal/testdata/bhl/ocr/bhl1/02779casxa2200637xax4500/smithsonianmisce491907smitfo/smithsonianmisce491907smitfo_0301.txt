CRUSTACEA NORTH PACIFIC EXPLORING EXPEDITION I05 

the frontal sulcus is deeper and the orbits more oblique. Length of 
 the carapax to its breadth as i : 1.57. Antero-lateral angles very 
 sharply prominent. Outer extremity of the crenulated inferior mar- 
 gin of the orbit angular. In the large cheliped the superior margin 
 of the meros- joint is spinulose or denticulated at and near the sum- 
 mit, but there is no sharp conical tooth, as in G. vocans. The greater 
 hand is well developed ; outer surface of palm granulated or small- 
 tuberculated ; crest on the inner surface nearly as in G. vocans, but 
 less prominent ; fingers neither very broad nor much compressed, 
 their external surface marked with a longitudinal sulcus, their inner 
 margins irregularly denticulated, with two or three larger conical 
 teeth. ]\Ieros-joint of ambulatory feet rather broad; dactyli as in 
 G. vocans. Dimensions of a male: Length of carapax, 0.522; 
 breadth, 0.82; length of great hand, 1.22; breadth, 0.44 inch. 

This species differs from G. acntns in the more distinct regions of 
 the carapax. the less distinct marginal lines, and in the compressed 
 and hairy dactyli. It is perhaps the same as G. forcipafus Adams 
 and White (\oy. Samarang, Crust., p. 50), but that species is de- 
 scribed as having very distinct marginal lines on the sides. 

It was found at Loo Choo in the usual station of the genus.

Carapax convex, very broad anteriorly and much contracted be- 
 hind. Length to breadth as i : 1.72. Front as broad as in G. tctra- 
 gonon and not dilated below. Antero-lateral angles acute. Surface 
 smooth and nearly even ; regions indistinct. Marginal lines very 
 well marked. Inferior margin of orbit crenulated only toward its 
 angular external extremity. A convex protuberance on the floor of 
 the orbit at its inner extremity corresponds to the "lobe sous- 
 orbitaire interne" of Milne Edwards. Beneath the infraorbital mar- 
 gin, separated by a smooth furrow, there is another distinct crest, 
 nearly parallel to it. Large cheliped of the male moderately devel- 
 oped ; outer surface of carpus and hand prominently granulated. 
 Hand well armed within, the crests not very prominent, but tuber- 
 culated ; fingers short, no longer than the palm, both sulcated exter- 
 nally, their inner margins rather strongly denticulated, teeth nearly
