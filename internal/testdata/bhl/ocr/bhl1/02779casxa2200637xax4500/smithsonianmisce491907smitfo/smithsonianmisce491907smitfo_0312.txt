 jecting, broad, lightly undulated, luargin not at all angular over the 
 antennas. Postero-lateral surface striated transversely ; striae about 
 eight in number. Subhepatic region tuberculated behind the orbit ; 
 tubercles somewhat irregularlx- arranged, small, subequal, and 
 angular. Chelipeds minutely rugate transversely ; a small spine on 
 the meros and one on the carpus. Meros- joint of ambulatory feet
