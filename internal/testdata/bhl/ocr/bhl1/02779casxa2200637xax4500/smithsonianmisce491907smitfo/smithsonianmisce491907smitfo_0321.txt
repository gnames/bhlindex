Our largest specimen, a male, has the following dimensions: 
 Length of carapax, 0.74; breadth, 0.79 inch. It is, therefore, not 
 "beaucoup plus longue que large," as stated by jNIilne Edwards. 
 The tooth behind the orbital angle is often nearly obsolete. 

It is common on floating logs, seaweed (Sargassum), etc., in the 
 North Atlantic between the 20th and 36th parallels of latitude. We 
 did not observe it in the South Atlantic.

Plate XVI, Fig. i 

XautilograpsHs angusfatus Stimpson, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., x, p. 
 103 [49]. 1858. 

Carapax smooth, narrow ; proportion of breadth to length, i : 1.14. 
 Branchial regions lightly striated transversely. Gastric lobules 
 sufficiently distinct, but not prominent. Front narrow, much ad- 
 vanced, its margin lightly sinuated. Frontal region concave. Lat- 
 eral margins nearly straight, parallel ; a single small tooth behind 
 the orbital tooth ; margin acute between the teeth and for a little dis- 
 tance behind the posterior tooth, terminating at a slight oblique 
 sulcus on the branchial region, perhaps indicating a third, obsolete 
 tooth. Behind this point the margins are obtuse. Ambulatory feet 
 rather less broad than in other species of the genus. The dimen- 
 sions of our unique (female) specimen, which is probably immature, 
 are: Length of carapax, 0.24; breadth, 0.21 inch. 

It differs from .V. [^usilliis in its less prominent second marginal 
 tooth ; from .V. cyanens in its more advanced front and less smooth 
 surface. From both these species, and from A', in in it tits, it differs 
 in its narrower carapax. 

It was taken in the North Pacific Ocean, in latitude 34° N., longi- 
 tude 151° W.
