a dactylopodites tres allonges, coniprimes et epineux. â€” Alers de 
 Chine." 

Our crab agrees pretty well with this description. The hand is, 
 however, rather tuberculated than verrucose, and the armature of 
 the dactyli consists rather of very stiff setse than spines, as they are 
 flexible, and jet black in color. 

The carapax is considerably flattened above, and less uneven than 
 is usual. The anterior margins of the epigastric lobules are in the 
 same straight line. The feet are slender, with narrow meros- joints. 
 Color yellowish brown, mottled. 

Found on marshy shores in the harbor of Hongkong, China. 

224. SESARMA BIDENS (De Haan) Dana 

Pachysoma bidcns De Haan, Fauna Jap., Crust., p. 60, pi. xvi, fig. 4, and 

XI, fig. 4. 
 Sesarma bidens Dana, U. S. Expl. Exped., Crust., i, 353. Milne 

Edwards, Mel. Carcin.. p. 151. 

Inhabits muddy estuaries. Taken at Simoda and at Hongkong. 
 From the former locality we have but one specimen, a female, in 
 which the oblique superior crests of the hand are scarcely pectinated, 
 and there are only small tubercles on the superior edge of the mova- 
 ble finger. 

The- Hongkong specimens agree in every respect with De Haan's 
 species except that the meros-joints of the walking feet are some- 
 what less dilated and the carapax less abundantly setose anteriorly. 

225. SESARMA DEHAANI Milne Edwards 

Pachysovia quadratum De Haan, Fauna Jap.. Crust., p. 62, pi. viii, fig. 3. 
 Sesarma dchaani Milne Edwards, Mel. Carcin., p. 150. 

Color in life yellowish, clouded with black anteriorly and with 
 olive posteriorly. Beneath yellowish-green ; meros of chelipeds red- 
 dish. Hands lemon colored. In specimens from Whampoa the 
 hands were white externally and the eyes bright yellow. The cara- 
 pax is sometimes bright purplish anteriorly. 

Of this species the largest and finest specimens (in some of which 
 the carapax measured 1.83 inches in length and 1.95 inches in 
 breadth) were found at Port Lloyd, Bonin Islands, where they live 
 in holes in the banks of fresh-water streams near their embouchure. 
 It is a very courageous animal, defending itself successfully from 
 the attacks of small dogs. It also occurred in brackish water at 
 Whampoa. China, and at Simoda. in Japan.
