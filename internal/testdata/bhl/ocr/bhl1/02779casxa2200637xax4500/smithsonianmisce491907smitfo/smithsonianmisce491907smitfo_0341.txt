CRUSTACEA NORTH PACIFIC EXPLORING EXPEDITION I39 

as complete a general description of the crab as the number and na- 
 ture of our specimens would admit. Of these there are five, only 
 one of which is a male, and that a young individual. From the 
 largest of the females the following measurements were taken: 
 Length of carapax, 0.265; breadth, 0.32 inch. Proportion, i: 1.21. 
 The color in life was brownish-gray 

They were dredged from a muddy bottom at the depth of six 
 fathoms, in bays of the coast near Hongkong, China. 

ASTHENOGNATHID.^ 

Genus ASTHEXOGXATHUS Stimpson 

This genus is described from a female specimen, the only one 
 which we were fortunate enough to discover. In the form of the 
 carapax and the relative size of the feet it has considerable resem- 
 blance to Piiiiiixa. The carapax is transverse, very broad pos- 
 teriorly, subtruncate anteriorly, with the antero-lateral angles, how- 
 ever, obtuse. The margins are entire. Surface very smooth and 
 even, but seen under the lens to be granulated. The facial region 
 occupies half the width of the carapax. Front deflexed. of moderate 
 extent. Eyes small, movable, with thick peduncles ; orbits not very 
 deep. Internal suborbital lobe almost obsolete. Infraorbital crest 
 sufficiently remote from the suborbital margin, prominent and 
 smooth. Antennulae transverse, situated in deep fossettes. Antennae 
 sufficiently long, very slender, traversing the inner hiatus of the orbit. 
 Epistome of moderate extent. Palate smooth, with no median sep- 
 tum. Buccal area of moderate size, arcuated in front. External 
 maxillipeds slender and weak, gaping so much as to be considerably 
 remote from each other, with not even the palpi in contact ; exognath 
 exposed ; ischium of the endognath larger than the meros ; meros 
 subquadrate, lightly grooved or excavated on outer surface ; palpus 
 exarthroid rather than prosarthroid ; dactylus minute, ciliated. Chel- 
 ipeds small, meros with a setigerous protuberance on the middle of 
 its upper edge ; hand moderately compressed, slender, acute above, 
 margined below with a crest ; fingers acute, compressed, sulcated, a 
 little longer than the palm, their inner edges scarcely toothed. Am- 
 bulatory feet of the second and third pairs very thick, as in Pinnixa: 
 those of the fourth pair slender, scarcely overreaching the meros- 
 joint of the preceding pair. Sternum broad, covered by the female 
 abdomen except at the margins and the postero-Iateral angles. 
 Terminal joint of the abdomen small rhomboidal.
