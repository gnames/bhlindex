CRUSTACEA NORTH PACIFIC EXPLORING EXPEDITION I45 

row linear sulci, somewhat as in Desmarest's figure of H. orbicnlare 
 (Consid. sur les Crust., pi. xxvi, fig. i). The anterior three areo- 
 lets are very large, and occupy most of the surface; postmedian 
 areolet protuberant at its middle; posterior two areolets very small, 
 much broader than long. The hepatic areolets are also small. 
 Rostrum slender, elongate-triangular, pointing obliquely upward at 
 an angle of 45Â°. There is a small elevated prseorbital tooth on 
 either side at the base of the rostrum. The two teeth at the infero- 
 exterior angle of the orbit are sharp, and there is a small but promi- 
 nent lateral tooth or spine on the surface of the hepatic region be- 
 hind the orbit, behind which there is a smooth excavation, and be- 
 hind this again a granulated protuberance. Posteriorly the inferior 
 margin of the carapax forms two prominent projections or teeth, 
 the base of the abdomen lying in the sinus between them. The 
 outer maxillipeds are very slender, with the ischium-joint nearly as 
 long as the meros and not as broad. Chelipeds clavate, granulated 
 above like the carapax ; hand short, with inflated, subglobose palm, 
 which is smooth and glabrous exteriorly ; fingers short ; dactylus one- 
 toothed near the middle within. Ambulatory feet very long and 
 slender, those of the second pair twice as long as the carapax. The 
 feet are sparsely provided with fine, inconspicuous hairs. The dac- 
 tyli are very slender, not flattened, and taper to a fine, almost hair- 
 like extremity. 

The color in life is reddish. Dimensions of the male: Length of 
 carapax, 0.318; breadth at bases of first pair of ambulatory feet, 
 0.318; greatest breadth of dorsal area, 0.24; length of ambulatory 
 feet of second pair, 0.66 inch. 

This species is certainly distinct from H. orbicitlarc, if the pub- 
 lished figures and descriptions of that species are to be relied upon. 
 Besides less important characters, the sharp lateral teeth on the 
 hepatic region and the slenderness of the ischium-joint of the outer 
 maxillipeds will be sufficient to distinguish it. Unfortunately we 
 have no specimens of the true H. orhicularc upon which to found a 
 comparison, as the examples which were taken at the Cape, and iden- 
 tified with that species at the time, were all lost by accident. 

Our specimen was dredged from a sandy bottom in twelve fath- 
 oms, in Simons Bay, Cape of Good Hope. 

Genus HALICARCIXUS White 

The epistome in this genus is sufficiently well defined. The new 
 species discovered by us seems to form a passage to Elcimciic. from 
 which Flolicarciiiits would seem to be best distinguished by the want
