LEUCOSIDEA 
 Genus LEUCOSIA (Fabricius) Leach 

The species of this genus which have recently become known are 
 very numerous, and although the distinctive marks are generally so 
 slight as to be determined with difficulty from descriptions or fig- 
 ures, they are nevertheless perfectly plain and satisfactory when 
 seen in the specimens themselves. The doubts thrown upon the 
 validity of some of the numerous species of Bell by certain German 
 authors are entirely unfounded; for several characters of a kind 
 which, in other genera of Brachyura, are merely indicative of variety 
 or individual peculiarities, here become of specific importance. 
 Color, for instance — usually and very properly disregarded as being 
 variable and of no specific value in most crabs- — is in the genus Lcn- 
 cosia a constant and important character. 

In Lcucosia the plane of the chelipeds is much more oblique to 
 the plane of the carapax than in most crabs, so that in their usual 
 position the anterior extremity is much elevated. They have usually 
 been delineated in this position, so that the post-brachial angle of the 
 inferior lateral margin cannot be seen. In our drawings we have 
 endeavored to represent the carapax in its own plane. 

In the larger pair of male abdominal appendages the spiral is .well 
 marked, and shows in the different species a number of turns vary- 
 ing from one and a half to eight or ten.
