Our specimens agree much better with De Haan's figures than 
 Avith those of Mihie Edwards in the ihustrations to the recent edition 
 of Cuvier's "Regrie Animal." In the young female the abdomen is 
 scarcely wider than in the male. The color in life is pale brick red 
 above, clouded with bluish ; below whitish. 

It is common on mud and shelly-mud in five to twelve fathoms, in 
 Hongkong- Harbor ; also taken in twenty-five fathoms, sand, in the 
 China Sea, near latitude 23Â° N.

A young female specimen referable to this species is found among 
 our collections, in which, however, the surface is but little granu- 
 lated, as in M. fugax. to which it is very closely allied. Rut the 
 teeth at the posterior extremity of the carapax are obtuse, and the 
 middle one is short (perhaps worn). 

The specimen in life was of a dusky brick-red color above ; sides 
 and feet paler and variegated with white ; beneath white. 

It was dredged from a shelly bottom in twenty fathoms, in Kago- 
 sima Ba}', Japan.
