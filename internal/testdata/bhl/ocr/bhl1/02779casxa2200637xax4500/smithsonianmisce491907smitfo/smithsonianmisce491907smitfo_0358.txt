De Haan's figure does not show the marginal granules, which 
 are, however, mentioned in his description. The surface of the 
 carapax, besides being punctated, is seen under the microscope to be 
 granulated, most conspicuously so posteriorly. The color in life is 
 a clear dark bluish-gray above, white below.
