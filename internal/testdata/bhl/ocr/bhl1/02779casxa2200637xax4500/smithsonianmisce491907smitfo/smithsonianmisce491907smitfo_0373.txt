The so-called teeth of the abdomen in this species are large, round, 
 glossy tubercles, of a bright orange color, and very conspicuous 
 among the rough hair\- coatings which cover the general surface of 
 the body. The bare surfaces of the last two joints of the chelipeds 
 and long ambulatory feet are also of a deep orange color in life. 
 Beneath the naked parts are white. 

In the examination of a considerable number of specimens we find 
 that the eyes in the young are very long, reaching beyond the tips 
 of the extra-orbital spines, while in full-grown individuals they do 
 not reach even to the extremities of these spines. 

Dredged in six and eight fathoms, on gravelly-mud bottoms, in
