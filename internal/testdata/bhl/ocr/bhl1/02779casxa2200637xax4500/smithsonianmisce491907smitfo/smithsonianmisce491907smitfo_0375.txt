superior fissure or notch deep ; inferior fissure occupied bv a tooth. 
 Eyes small and protractile, as in the Leucosidea. Antennul^e sufii- 
 ciently long, without fossettes, and situated in the large inner hiatus 
 of the orbit. Antennse short, placed in the lower angle of the orbital 
 hiatus, beneath the antennulse. External maxillipeds verv much 
 elongated, slightly gaping, but accurately fitting the margins of the 
 buccal area and anteriorly concealing the apices of the inner maxil- 
 lipeds; exognath very narrow, and barely overreaching the ischium 
 of the endognath anteriorly ; meros of endognath broader than the 
 ischium, longitudinally sulcated along the middle and much pro- 
 duced anteriorly, its pointed apex reaching the front ; palpus con- 
 cealed as in the Leucosidea. Ambulatory feet as in Dorippe, but 
 with the dactyli scarcely falciform and non-costate. Abdomen 
 nearly as in Dorippe, but sexarticulate, and with the last joint 
 ■dilated. The male verges are in the coxae of the last pair of feet. 

In the shape of the carapax this curious form resembles Hoiiwla. 
 In general appearance and the structure of the feet, the posterior 
 two pairs of which are turned up over the back and prehensile, it is 
 closely allied to Dorippe. Ikit the character of the external maxil- 
 lipeds and the position of the afferent branchial openings would far 
 remove it from this latter genus, and even entitle it to rank as a 
 ■distinct familv.

Carapax nearly as long as broad, conspicuously areolated, the sur- 
 face minutely granulated. Sides convex, tridentate, the first tooth 
 at the summit of the hepatic region, the other two somewhat smaller 
 than the first, and placed rather close together on the branchial re- 
 gion. Teeth of the front small but sharp, the two median ones most 
 projecting. Chelipeds of the male rough with granules and spinules 
 and some short setse ; a strong spine at the summit of the carpus ; 
 hand short and high ; fingers large, longer than the palm, concave 
 within. Ambulatory feet very slender. 

Color above bluish-gray in life, below dirty light brownish.
