Crvptodroniia canaliculata Stimpsox, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., x, 
 " p. 240 [78], 1858. 

Carapax convex, uneven, and distinctly channeled parallel to the 
 frontal and antero-lateral margins, the channel being rather broad 
 and rendered more conspicuous by being nearly destitute of the 
 pubescence which covers the rest of the surface. Transverse sulcus 
 deep between the gastric and cardiac regions. Front much project- 
 ing ; median tooth and the two next prominent, acute ; pr^eorbital 
 teeth much smaller and less prominent ; external angle of orbit acute. 
 Antero-lateral margin three-toothed, including the posterior or sul- 
 cus tooth ; the first tooth is much the strongest and sharpest, and 
 between this tooth and the angle of the orbit there is a ridge concave 
 in outline. A strong concavity on the subhepatic region is well cir- 
 cumscribed by this ridge and another ridge, which extends between 
 the strong subhepatic tooth and the second lateral tooth. The sub- 
 orbital tooth is also very prominent. Feet much pubescent and stout- 
 hairy; chelipeds nearly as in C. tiunida, but with the longitudinal 
 ridges on outer surface of hand more strongly defined ; fingers much 
 compressed. Ambulatory feet of the first and second pairs very 
 angular and subverrucose, but not tuberculated ; upper side of carpal 
 joint depressed, almost concave. Abdomen smooth, that of the 
 male with a deep sinus on each side at the penult joint. This species 
 is of a dirty buff color. Length of the carapax in a female, 0.31 ; 
 breadth, 0.36 inch. 

One individual was found carrying upon its back a piece of sea- 
 weed (Pad ilia) ; the others all used compound ascidians. 

Inhabits rocky shores, among seaweeds, in the lowest division of 
 the littoral zone. Taken in Caspar Strait by Captain Rodgers ; also' 
 at Loo Choo and Kikaisima by other members of the expedition. 

Cenus DROAIL\ Fabricius 

This genus as restricted will contain those species like D. vulgaris, 
 D. niuiphii, and D. lator. in which the palate is smooth, and the ster- 
 nal sulci of the female are not approximated,- and produced only to 
 the fourth sternal segment, between the bases of the second pair of 
 feet. The carapax is transverse, convex, and pilose. The front is 
 rather narrow and prominent. Hepatic regions not excavated.' In
