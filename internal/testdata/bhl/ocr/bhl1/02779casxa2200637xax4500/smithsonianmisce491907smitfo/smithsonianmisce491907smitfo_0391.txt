As this curious crustacean is not fully described in the work above 
 cited, some of its more important characters will be noted here. The 
 antennas are nearly as in Raiiilia. The eyes are seated at the ex- 
 tremities of very long compressed peduncles, somewhat dilated 
 toward the base, and retractile backward into oblique orbits, reaching 
 to the antero-lateral angles of the carapax at the level of the middle 
 of the outer maxillipeds. The whole outer surface of these maxil- 
 lipeds is squamose or roughened with arcuated and ciliated lineolse; 
 but there is no oblique ciliated crest on the ischium, as in Ranilia and 
 iXotopKs; meros-joint as long as the ischium ; exognath sufificiently 
 broad and reaching a little beyond the tip of the ischium. Sternum, 
 as in Ranilia, narrow between the bases of the second pair of feet. 
 Last joint of abdomen in the female free. 

The carapax was of a palish brick-red color in life, with a median 
 line of white. Feet and inferior surface white. 

Our 'specimen of this species was caught with the "deep-sea 
 clams" on a sandy bottom in ninety fathoms, off the northeast ex- 
 tremity of Formosa, eighty miles from land.

Genus PETROLISTHES Stimpson 

Carapax depressed, subovate, not broader than long. Front trian- 
 gular, with a more or less undulated margin, which may be either 
 smooth or dentated. There is often a small tooth or lobe on each 
 side at the base of the triangular main body of the front. Eyes 
 rather large. The coxal joint of antennae is small, not reaching the 
 superior margin of the carapax, and often concealed beneath the 
 corner of the subhepatic shield, but sometimes its inner angle is ex- 
 posed in the form of a tooth beneath the eye. The movable part of 
 the antenna is thus not excluded from the orbit, but works freely in
