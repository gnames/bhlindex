Porccllana dispar Stimpson, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., x, p. 242 [80], 
 1858. 

Carapax somewhat uneven, but glabrous ; sides pubescent ; lateral 
 margin acute, forming a prominent angle and turning inward a little 
 just behind the lateral notch, and armed with some minute teeth 
 near the middle ; a small tooth or spine above at the insertion of the 
 second joint of the antennae. Orbital margin less concave than in 
 most species. The front, as seen from above, is straight or slightly 
 convex, but in the front view is seen to be acutely sinuated or de- 
 flexed at the middle. Chelipeds very unequal, the greater one with 
 a smooth surface ; carpus angular or ridged in the middle and with 
 its anterior margin undulated ; hand broad, smooth, not twisted, 
 naked, fingers punctate; dactylus curved, one-toothed within. In 
 the small cheliped the median ridge of the carpus is prominent and 
 its anterior margin bidentate ; the hand is very angular, with median 
 ridge acutely prominent, the outer margin pubescent and the fingers 
 twisted into a vertical plane, much curved, excavated and lanose 
 within. Color in life pale brick-red ; fingers dark purplish. Length 
 of carapax in the male, 0.24; breadth, 0.22; length of greater hand, 
 0.38; breadth, 0.18; length of smaller hand, 0.29; breadth, o.i inch. 

Found under stones in the fourth subregion of the littoral zone at 
 Garden Island, in Port Jackson, Australia.

Porcellana latifrons Stimpson, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., x, p. 243 [81], 
 1858. 

Carapax subquadrate, longer than broad, slightly convex, smooth ; 
 lateral margins acute, but not projecting, and armed with three or 
 four minute spines near the middle, and a larger spine, very sharp 
 and directed forward, above the insertion of the external antennas. 
 Surface at the frontal region minutely rugate, rugae transverse. 
 Front very broad, projecting, laminiform, trilobate; median lobe 
 largest, quadridentate, and scarcely more projecting than the lateral 
 lobes, which are bidentate; thus the entire frontal margin is eight- 
 toothed; teeth acute. Eyes large, directed sideways. First joint of 
 external antennae much produced ; flagellum nearly naked. External
