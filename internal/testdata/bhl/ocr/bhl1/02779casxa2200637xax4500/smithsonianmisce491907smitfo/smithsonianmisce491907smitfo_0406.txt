192 SMITHSONIAN MISCELLANEOUS COLLECTIONS 

This species, when Hving. is of a deep blood-red color, which is 
 seen under the lens to consist of crowded dots or punctse, less numer- 
 ous on the dorsal surface, where it is consequently lighter. Length 
 of the carapax in the male, 0.23; breadth, 0.215; length of greater 
 hand, 0.39; breadth, 0.16 inch. 

This species is common in from six to twelve fathoms on sandy 
 bottoms in Simons Bay, Cape of Good Hope. 

It differs from P. dchaani Krauss, also from the Cape, in its naked 
 carapax, broader front, with a less prominent median tooth, and 
 non-denticulated superantennary margin.

Carapax rather convex, with an even surface, apparently smooth, 
 but seen on close examination to be for the most part minutely and 
 closely lineolated in a transverse direction. Lateral margin regularly 
 though slightly convex, expanded with a refiexed laminiform crest. 
 Front very much projecting and laminiform. tridentate ; median 
 tooth mudi the largest, triangular, and acutely pointed ; lateral teeth 
 small, acute. External angle of the orbit acute, minutely serrated. 
 Flagellum of external antennae almost naked, joints oblong. Latero- 
 inferior regions somewhat concave. Chelipeds rather small and 
 slender ; angle at summit of meros very prominent ; upper surface 
 of carpus and hand with a median longitudinal ridge ; a single tooth 
 on the front margin of the carpus ; hand triangular, slender at the 
 base, its outer margin nearly straight, acute, ciliated, inner margin 
 forming a ridge continuous with that of the dactylus. Ambulatory 
 feet sparsely provided with plumose setae ; meros minutely serru- 
 lated above; dactylus half the length of the penult joint. The 
 meros-joint of the posterior or abnormal feet is short. The colors 
 in life are as follows: Carapax bluish-brown, often with a white 
 median dorsal line ; feet brownish clouded, darkest at the middle of 
 each joint ; basal joints white. Length of carapax in the female, 
 0.24 ; breadth. 0.23. Only two specimens were found, both females. 

Dredged from a muddy bottom in six fathoms, in Hongkong 
 Harbor.
