dilatation of the last two joints of the external maxillipecls. The 
 abdomen, as described for H. mcrtensii, is in some points dififerent 
 from that of H. dentatus and H. cavicauda, in which two species it is 
 more nearly as described for Dermaturiis. Although the greater 
 part of the abdomen in the male is soft and coriaceous, yet the seg- 
 ments can be traced, and each segment is indicated by a small, round, 
 indurated piece on each side. The female abdomen is unsymmetri- 
 cal, as in Lithodcs, with its segments on the left side a little indu- 
 rated, corneous, and smooth. 

This genus is peculiar to the Northern Pacific Ocean.

It is extremely abundant on the shores of Hakodadi Bay, Island 
 of Jesso, inhabiting weedy and stony shores just above low-water

Carapax convex, strongly swollen or tumid just behind the front, 
 which is contracted. The surface of the anterior or gastric region 
 is sparsely granulated anteriorly ; posteriorly the granules become 
 more numerous, sharp, and setigerous. Branchial regions not much 
 projecting, their lateral margins nearly straight. Eyes much pro- 
 jecting, minutely granulated above, and with the apex sharply pro- 
 jecting, forming a right angle. Ophthalmic scales sharp, not
