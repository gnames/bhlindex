331. CLIBANARIUS PACIFICUS Stimpson 

Clibanarius [^aciftcns Stimpson, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., x, p 247 
 [85], 1858. 

This species approaches so closely to C. aquabilis that a long ex- 
 amination was necessary before any specific difference was apparent. 
 The feet are. however, more hairy than in that species, the dactvli 
 of the ambulatory feet are somewhat longer, and the lower surfaces 
 of the hands generally smoother. When the hands differ in size, as 
 they sometimes do slightly, the right is generally the larger. Our 
 species is of a very dark bluish-olive color ; ambulatory feet bright 
 yellow ; fingers of the hand red. It is littoral, and thus dift"ers much 
 both in color and station from C. ccquabilis. Our largest specimen 
 is a male, one and a quarter inches in length. The length of the 
 carapax in the median line is 0.39; breadth of front, 0.16 inch. 

It differs from Pa gurus iucrqualis De Haan in its equal and more 
 spinous hands. 

Found among rocks in the lowest subregion of the littoral zone at 
 Tanega-sima and Ousima. 

Genus PAGURISTES Dana 

It is remarkable that a form so distinct as Paguristcs should 
 have been so long suffered to remain in the old genus Pa gurus, 
 while the peculiarities of its external generative apparatus, in both 
 male and female, were well known. We have here the only hermit 
 crab in which the first two pairs of abdominal members are devel- 
 oped into organs subservient to generation. In the male these are 
 adapted to the purposes of generation, as in the Brachyura. though 
 their form is more like those of Astacus, and they have a similar 
 position on the lower surface of the abdomen near its base. In the 
 female the anterior pair of appendages is small and situated at the 
 base of the abdomen, and there is a broad, oblique expansion or sac 
 on the left side of its soft body formed by a folding of the integu- 
 ment at the posterior margin of the fourth segment, enclosing a 
 pouch which serves to contain the eggs. 

The other essential characters of the genus may be stated as fol- 
 lows : Eyes long. Antennre short ; acicle robust. Chelipeds similar 
 in shape and generally subequal ; commissure of the hand vertical ; 
 fingers moving in a horizontal plane. Feet of the fourth pair not 
 subcheliform. 

It has a wide geographical distribution, species being found in all
