Bupagurus megalops Stimpson, Froc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., x, p. 248 
 [86], 1858. 

Carapax naked : anterior region smooth, glossy, and flattened. 
 Median lobe or tooth of front broad, obtuse, and less prominent than 
 the lateral teeth. Eyes rather remote from each other, shorter than 
 the peduncle of the antennae by one-third the length of the latter, 
 and with the cornea greatly swollen, so that its diameter is nearly 
 twice that of the peduncle at its base. The acicle of the antennae is 
 slender from its base, slightly ciliated, and reaches the extremity of 
 the eye; the flagellum is naked, and reaches beyond the ambulatory 
 feet for a fourth of its length. Chelipeds ciliated on the margins ; 
 the right one a little shorter than (that is, overreached by) the ambu- 
 latory feet; carpus oblong, one-half longer than broad, above sharp- 
 granulous and setose, the setae short and arising from the anterior 
 bases of the granules ; hand broader than carpus, but scarcely more 
 than half as broad as long, tapering and depressed, but convex along 
 the middle ; upper surface of the hand roughened with sharp gran- 
 ules smaller than those of the carpus, and very sparsely scattered, 
 there being very few on the convex middle portion of the hand, but 
 more at the sides ; fingers hairy, much shorter than the palm, and 
 with calcareous, hooked tips. Left cheliped slender ; carpus trig- 
 onal, superior keel spinulous and separated by a longitudinal groove 
 from another keel situated to the right and beneath it ; hand as long 
 as the carpus of the right cheliped : palm convex and obsolctely
