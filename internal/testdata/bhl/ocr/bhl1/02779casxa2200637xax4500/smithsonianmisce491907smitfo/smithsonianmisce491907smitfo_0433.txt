CRUSTACEA NORTH PACIFIC EXPLORING EXPEDITION 21/ 

bicarinated. caringe granulated; fingers elongated, depressed, and 
 somewhat curving downward. The whole upper surface of the 
 hands, excepting the fingers, is sometimes pubescent. Beneath the 
 chelipeds are uniformly and crowdedly granulated, and often pubes- 
 cent. Ambulatory feet nearly naked ; upper surfaces smooth, glossy, 
 and punctate; upper margins spinulose; dactyli contorted, longer 
 than the greater hand, extremely slender, sulcated longitudinally on 
 the inner surface, and ciliated above near their extremities. In the 
 third foot of the right side the penult joint is twice as long as the 
 one preceding it. Length of a male specimen, 1.7; length of cara- 
 pax, 0.36; breadth of front, 0.2 inch. 

This can scarcely be the Pagiirus conformis of De Haan, who, in 
 his description of the chelipeds of that species, says, "Pedis minoris 
 carpo non spinoso." It is closely allied to B. gracilipcs, but the eyes 
 are larger and the hands ciliated. 

It was dredged from a sandy and shelly bottom at twenty-six 
 fathoms, in the North China Sea, under the twenty-third parallel of 
 latitude.

Rostriform point large, strongly prominent, and acute. Eyes 
 very short and thick, shorter than the acicle, and but little over half 
 as long as the peduncle of the antennae ; cornea much inflated ; base 
 of the peduncle contracted. Flagellum of the antennae naked ; acicle 
 rather small, with flat upper surface, and both edges somewhat 
 hairy. Right cheliped long and slender, but considerably shorter 
 than the ambulatory feet ; carpus oblong, proportion of breadth to 
 length, 1 : 1.5, with the surface subspinulose, as in B. bernhardus ; 
 hand much depressed, thin, elongated-ovate, half as broad as long, 
 convex in the middle, but concave near the thin margins ; nearly 
 smooth above, but sparsely ornamented with minute depressed gran- 
 ules ; outer margin of the hand somewhat expanded and crenulated ; 
 fingers smooth, depressed, with hooked calcareous tips crossing each 
 other; dactylus carinated at the superior margin. Ambulatory feet 
 as in Â£. bernhardus, but with more slender dactyli. General length, 
 1.8; length of carapax. 0.35 ; breadth of front, 0.19 inch. 

It dififers from B. splciidcscciis and B. mcrtensii in the longer am- 
 bulatory feet, the terminal joints of which reach much beyond the 

^ Pagurus gracilipcs (Stimpson).
