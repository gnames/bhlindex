cheliped, and in the shape of the hand, which is, however, usually 
 tapering toward the fingers, so that the immovable finger is narrow, 
 with a nearly straight outer margin. 

The rostriform point is smaller and less prominent than in Dana's 
 figure, but sharp and distinct. The right cheliped is elongated, does 
 not reach to the extremities of the right ambulatory feet ; the gran- 
 ules of its upper surface are distinct and well separated, though not 
 generally very prominent ; those of the carpus are sharper or scabri- 
 form, and always setose at their bases ; the dactylus is ornamented 
 with a row of granules parallel to its outer margin, not represented 
 in Dana's figure. The small cheliped is convex and distinctl}' 
 grooved longitudinally above, particularly on the carpus, where the 
 groove is defined on either side by a spinous crest, the superior crest 
 being by far the most prominent. Fingers of the smaller hand not 
 gaping, and not over a third or half longer than the palm. Beneath 
 the meros-joint is hairy in both chelipeds. In the small cheliped the 
 sides of this joint are prominent and denticulated with subequal 
 teeth; the surface is granulated. In the larger cheliped this joint is 
 sparsely granulated, one granule or tubercle situated near the apex 
 of the ischium being larger than the rest, but not projecting. 

Neither the shape of the anterior part of the carapax nor the gran- 
 ulation of the chelipeds is well represented in the figure taken from 
 the U. S. Exploring Expedition specimen. 

It diflfers from B. puhcsccns in the armature of the hands, which 
 are not spinous, but granulated, and in the shorter dactyli of the 
 ambulatory feet, which are very little longer than the penult joint, 
 and show a longitudinal red stripe on each side. 

It is found at Hakodadi, in Japan, in the same abundance as on 
 the opposite shore of the North Pacific.

Closely allied to E. hirsutiusculus. The rostriform point is slen- 
 der, sharp, and distinct in some specimens, but generally obtuse or 
 hidden by a tuft of setae. The feet are hairy, but much less so than 
 in hirstitinsculus ; chelipeds usually naked. On the lower surface of 
 the meros-joint in the chelipeds there is a remarkably prominent 
 tubercle, sometimes sharp, but usually blunt, situated near the mid-
