Upon the anterior region of the carapax there are the usual two 
 series of setose pits extending on either side, from the base of the 
 eye to the middle of the lateral suture. Rostriform tooth acute, 
 prominent; lateral teeth of front acuminated. Eyes stout, shorter 
 than the acicles ; cornea a little dilated. Apex of ophthalmic scales 
 elongated and slender. The greater cheliped reaches to the tips 
 of the walking feet; surface granulated and covered with a short 
 pubescence; inner margin with a deep sinus at the juncture of the 
 carpus and the hand and another at the juncture of the dactylus with 
 the hand ; carpus subtriangular, sparsely spinous above, with a 
 smooth strip in the middle and a spinose inner margin ; hand broad 
 in the female, with a median, and marginal rows of subspiniform 
 granules larger than the rest ; dactylus above armed with a median 
 series of sharp tubercles. Small cheliped subtrigonal, hirsute, and 
 granulated; carpus with a spinous edge and a longitudinal smooth 
 channel above; hand not spinous, but with a blunt carina running 
 from the base to the immovable finger. In both chelipeds the meros 
 is deeply excavated beneath, with the margins long-ciliated ; the right 
 margin spinose. Ambulatory feet hairy, but not spinose above ; 
 tarsi rather broad, not twisted, and armed with corneous spinules. 
 Color of alcoholic specimens reddish. General length of a male 
 specimen, 2.2 ; length of carapax, 0.6 ; breadth of front, measured as

 [89], 1858. 

Eyes rather remote from each other, and pretty large and stout, in 
 length about equaling the peduncle of the antennae, but overreaching 
 the acicle ; cornea considerably dilated ; peduncle constricted at base. 
 There is no distinct median or rostriform point to the carapax, but 
 the bracteole or interocular plate of the ophthalmic ring is consider-
