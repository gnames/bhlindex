THE SCIENTIFIC WORK OF SAMUEL PIERPOXT 
 EANGLEY. 

BY PROF. E. C. PICKERING. 

The Chief Justice: I am gratified, ladies and gentlemen, to 
 present a gentleman, with whose reputation yon are all well ac- 
 quainted and who was associated years ago in eclipse expeditions 
 with Mr. Langley â€” Professor Pickering, Director of the Harvard 
 Observatory. 

Professor Pickering: Mr. Chief Justice, ladies and gentlemen: 
 In comparing the paper we have just heard with that I am about to 
 read to you, you will probably be impressed, as I have been, with 
 the manner in which two minds, in dealing with the same facts fr6m 
 wholly different standpoints, have arrived so closely at the same re- 
 sults. Possibly this coincidence may justify us in the belief that these 
 facts are really the most important in Langley's career. The fact that 
 they should have impressed one whose mind has been occupied by 
 such different lines of work from those of Langley I think also 
 justifies me in the very high degree of value I attach to them 
 in the paper which I am presenting to you. Possibly when you have 
 heard my paper you may suspect that in some respects Doctor White 
 and I have interchanged the subjects which were assigned to us. 

The scientific work of Samuel Pierpont Langley extended over a 
 period of forty years, and occupied his entire strength and energy 
 during a large part of this time. It is evidently impossible to do 
 justice to such a subject in the time allotted to me this evening. 
 Fortunately, he lived to publish his most important work and thus 
 make it known to the world. Admirable reviews of it have also 
 recently appeared in the technical journals, recalling it to the pro- 
 fessional physicist and astronomer. It remains for me to tell you 
 how it appears to one who knew him well during nearly this entire 
 period, who prized long discussions with him regarding his work 
 during his earlier years, and whose affection and friendship for him 
 never waned and were interrupted only by his death. 

His work in science naturally divides itself into two parts, one 
 while Director of the Allegheny Observatory, and the other while 
 Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. Each of these extended 
 over a period of about twenty years, and was conducted in surround- 
 ings differing in almost every respect. His remarkable skill as a
