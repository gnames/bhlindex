to abandon his active scientific work, and he accepted only with the 
 condition that he should also continue his work at Allegheny. This 
 however, proved to be impracticable; but the establishment of the 
 Astrophysical Observatory in Washington enabled him to devote a 
 part of his time to research. A new problem now confronted him— 
 executive work on a large scale. Here he encountered the difficulty 
 that comes to almost every man who undertakes the charge of a 
 large scientific establishment— a difficulty that will probably harass 
 his successor as it did him. This is the large portion of the income 
 absorbed by current expenses. It is like a boat forcing its way 
 against a rapid stream. Much energy may be expended and no 
 progress made. Now add a little more power, and the gain will be 
 very great. It is the same with any industrial or commercial estab- 
 lishment — after expenses are met, all additional income is clear gain. 
 In almost all active scientific establishments, a slight increase in in- 
 come will represent a large increase in results. I well remember 
 discussing this matter with him. I pointed out how little of the 
 income was used for the "increase of knowledge among men"^ — • 
 scientific research — and I hoped that by reducing expenses he v/ould 
 greatly increase the output. "My dear Pickering," he replied, 
 "you have no idea how, in a venerable institution like this, we are 
 tied down by precedents and traditions. Every attempt I make to 
 reduce current expenses is met by insuperable obstacles." The rem- 
 edy came largely by additional appropriations by the Government, 
 and by outside aid, like the Hodgkins fund. When we consider the 
 liberal conditions under which the Smithsonian Institution can 
 become a trustee, it is surprising that rich men have not more 
 freely availed themselves of this opportunity to secure a wise 
 administration of their gifts to science. Langley tried hard to 
 aid departments of human knowledge other than those in which he 
 had always been personally interested. It was a great disappoint- 
 ment to him when such unselfish aims were criticized adversely. 
 The National Zoological Park is an excellent illustration of his 
 energv in carrying through a plan having no relation to his own 
 scientific work. The establishment of the Astrophysical Observa- 
 tory, as stated above, enabled him to continue, under much more 
 favorable conditions, his work begun at Allegheny. His other 
 duties, however, compelled him to delegate it largely to others, and 
 he was most fortunate in establishing here a corps of assistants who 
 developed his methods and extended his work with remarkable suc- 
 cess. Not to mention those who assisted him at Allegheny and 
 ^^'ashington, and are now living, tor have produced an astronomer
