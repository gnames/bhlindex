like the late James E. Keeler, director of the Lick Observatory, 
 was an achievement of which any man might well be proud. 

While much of the work of the Astrophysical Observatory has 
 consisted in repeating and extending the earlier work of Lang- 
 ley, many new problems have been undertaken. A matter in which 
 he was greatly interested during the last years of his life was the 
 variation, if any, in the solar constant. This means possible changes 
 in the heat of the sun itself, which from observation with the bolo- 
 meter appeared to take place rapidly and irregularly, and to be real 
 and not due to changes in the atmosphere of the earth. It is diffi- 
 cult to estimate the commercial and industrial importance of the 
 effect of such changes, if they exist. The pecuniary value of a study 
 of them, if it led to a means of determining their laws so that they 
 could be foreseen, would be almost incalculable. 

The work of Langley may be summed up as that of an eager 
 searcher after truth, a careful and persevering investigator, and one 
 whose life was directed to the extension of human knowledge, not 
 only in lines of theoretical interest, but in those which, if successful, 
 would have the utmost practical value.

The Chief Justice : I will now introduce, my fellow-citizen, the 
 very distinguished engineer, Mr. Octave Chanute, of Chicago. 

yir. Chanute : Mr, Chief Justice, ladies and gentlemen : I have 
 been asked to refer briefly to the late Secretary Langley 's contribu- 
 tions to aerodynamics. 

Doctor Langley said that the subject of flight had interested him 
 as long as he could remember, but that it was a communication read 
 at the Buffalo meeting of the American Association for the Advance- 
 ment of Science, in 1886, which aroused his then dormant interest 
 in the subject. The explications of flight then given were so evi- 
 dently erroneous and there were so many conflicting theories on the 
 subject, that Langley determined to find out for himself, and in his 
 own way, what amount of mechanical power was requisite to sus- 
 tain a given weight in the air and make it advance at a given speed ; 
 for this seemed to him an inquiry which must necessarily precede 
 any attempt at mechanical flight, which was the very remote aim of 
 his efforts. Up to that time there had been a vast amount of specu-
