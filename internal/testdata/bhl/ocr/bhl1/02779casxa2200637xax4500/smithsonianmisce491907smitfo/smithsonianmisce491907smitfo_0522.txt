Oakland; 12:1.3:35 p. m. The big clocks of the city were stopped at 
 thirteen minutes after the hour of noon today by as violent an 
 earthquake as ever visited Oakland. The shock probably lasted 
 seven seconds, although it seemed much longer. It was followed 
 by another decided tremor, which, however, was not comparable 
 with the first. The excitement for a time was great. People ran 
 out of their houses and into the middle of the street. In all the 
 big churches of the city the congregations were attentively listen- 
 ing to sermons, and the shock abruptlj"^ ended several of these 
 services. As far as can be learned, there were no windows broken 
 or other actual damage done, although many are complaining that 
 valuable china and glass ware were knocked from tables and 
 shelves and ruined. The seismograph at the Chabot Observatory 
 shows that there were three distinct tremors. The direction of 
 the first was from northwest to southeast, while the others were 
 from northeast to southwest. The successive tremors lasted a trifle 
 over eight seconds and the time recorded at the observatory is 

. 12h. 13m. 35s. The quake was distinctly felt in Berkeley, Alameda, 
 and other towns in the vicinity.
