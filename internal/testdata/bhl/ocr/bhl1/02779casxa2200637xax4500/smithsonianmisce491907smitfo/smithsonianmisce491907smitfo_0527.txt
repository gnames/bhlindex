EARTHQUAKES ON THE PACIFIC COAST 13 

Mills College; 11:5 p. m. 

Alameda. Mr. Perrine's seismograph gives a record of an extensive 
 shock. Waves clearly marked into east and west, north and south, 
 and southeast and northwest. 

College Park; 11:10:39 p. m. 

Berkeley. Ewing seismograph records only one shock although 
 two were felt by many persons. ' ' The disturbance commenced 
 with minute vibrations in all three components, which gradually 
 increased in the north-south and the east-west components, reach- 
 ing a first maximum in the east-west direction at thirty-seven 
 seconds (reckoned from the beginning), and a second and principal 
 one at seventy-two seconds. The principal disturbance in the 
 north-south direction commenced at about thirty-two seconds and 
 lasted to the fiftieth second. During this interval the intensest 
 vibration occurred at forty-nine seconds, almost exactly from 
 south to north. . . ." "By treating the displacement as be- 
 longing to a simple harmonic motion, the actual velocity of the 
 ground at forty-nine seconds is found to be 0.47 inch (12 mm.) 
 per second, and its actual acceleration 1.29 inches (33 mm.) per 
 second. . . . The velocity of the greatest westerly displace- 
 ment is 0.13 inches (3 mm.) and acceleration 0.32 in. The greatest 
 displacements were north-south 0.34 inch; east-west 0.10 inch." —
