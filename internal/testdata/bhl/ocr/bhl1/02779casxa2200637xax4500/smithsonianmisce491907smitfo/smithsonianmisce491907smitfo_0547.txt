 the shock, as viewed by me from an elevation of 4.500 feet were 
 very peculiar.— A. W. Sehorn.)

Oakland; Chabot Observatory. Observers, C. B. and S. W.; 10:-49:29 
 a. m.; duration, 31 seconds; direction, south to north, east to west; 
 intensity IV. There were two distinct shocks. The first, south to 
 north, lasted about 20 seconds; then, after a quiet interval of 
 3 seconds, a shock from east to west lasted 8 seconds. Stopped

1903. August 2; Lick Observatory. R.-F. VII or VIII. The most severe 
 shock since the establishment of the Lick Observatory occurred 
 on the night of Sunday, August 2, 1903. The time of beginning 
 of the first shock was recorded by various observers as follows: 
 10:49:21—3 p. m.— Aitken; 10:49:21— Yogt; 10:49:15— Perrine. 
 Smaller vibrations lasted a few seconds, followed by 15 or 20 
 seconds of very violent shocks, generally in an east-west direc- 
 tion. Strong vibrations continued 10 seconds longer. This shock 
 proved too severe for the seismometers of the Lick Observatory. 
 The duplex recorded the earlier vibration, but was thrown out 
 of adjustment by the heavier shock. The Ewing plate failed 
 to rotate, but the indicator moved about, practically with the 
 result that the east-west pen was thrown entirely oif the disk. 
 The motion of the earth seems to have been about half an 
 inch. None of the astronomical instruments suffered damage. 
 Beyond numerous cracks in plastering, nothing will remain to 
 betray the intensity of the disturbance. Several chimneys on 
 brick houses toppled over. Evidence points to Hall's Valley as 
 the probable center of seismic activity. As in the case of the 
 shock of 1868, minor vibrations have been recorded at small in- 
 tervals as follows: August 2, 11:36:30 p. m. R.-F. IIL Light 
 shock, lasting 1 or 2 seconds. August 3, 3:22:41 p. m. R.-F. TI. 
 Single vertical jolt. August 8, 4:17:14 p. m. R.-F. I; duration.
