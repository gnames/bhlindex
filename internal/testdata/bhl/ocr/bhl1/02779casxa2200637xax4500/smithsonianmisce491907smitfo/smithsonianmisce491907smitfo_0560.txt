in California occurred apparently without any relation to pres- 
 sure distribution. It was noticed, however, that some earthquakes 
 occurred during the passage of a marked ' ' high ' ' across the 
 northern portion of the coast. While any relation of this charac- 
 ter must be obscure and indefinite, it is conceivable that in a 
 region where quakes and tremors of tectonic origin are frequent — 
 that is, a region where strata are in unstable equilibrium — the 
 passage of an area of high pressure may directly or indirectly 
 affect the stresses at critical times. The relation is involved and 
 is alluded to here only because at Manila and Tokyo microseismic 
 phenomena bear some relation to approaching typhoons: The 
 thought suggests itself that the installation of seismographs on 
 the Pacific coast may lead to the detection of advancing pressure 
 areas. 
 The earthquake, as timed by the writer, began at 5:13:05 a. m., 120tli 
 meridian time. The disturbance lasted for about 40 seconds. The 
 main shock was followed by others. The times are:
