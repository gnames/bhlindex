of the plate later. East-west record eoutiniious, though the 
 swing carried pen over edge of plate a number of times. Vertical 
 weight was thrown off its pivots by the violence of the horizontal 
 motions and in consequence shows no displacement after the 
 very start. Barograph seems to have been quite strongly dis- 
 turbed in the vertical. Duplex seismograph pen was found off the 
 plate on the west side. It seems likely therefore that the duplex 
 recorded only the first 10 or 15 seconds of the shock, if so much as 
 that. Comparison with duplex records from Oakland and Carson 
 bears this out. — J. D. Maddrill. 

1906. April 18; Los Angeles; moderate shock at 5:16 a. m., lasting be- 
 tween 5 and 10 seconds. — U. S. Weather Bureau. 

1906. April 18; Southeast Farallon Island, Cal. (26 miles due west of the 
 beach at San Francisco; solid rock rising from the sea; the 
 Weather Bureau building is located 15 feet above sea level). The 
 direction of motion, from the east. A stone weighing about one 
 hundred pounds slid six inches west by south and was rotated 
 slightly in a direction opposite to the hands of a clock. There 
 were two maxima. No vertical motion. No damage done ex- 
 cept a crack across the entire front of the fireplace. Two rorii 
 slides of about one hundred tons each occurred on west end of 
 the island. 
 "At 10:06 a. m., April 18. two distinct vibrations were felt. These 
 were felt by Mr. Legler, observer of the Weather Bureau at 
 Point Reves, distant directly north twenty miles. He was talking 
 to me over the Weather Bureau cable and the vibrations were 
 noted by him 3 seconds before they were felt on the island." —

Santa Eosa; the damage at this point was extensive and the loss 
 of life heavy, owing to the destruction of several hotels. Many 
 brick walls collapsed, chimneys were generallj^ demolished, and 
 frame buildings thrown from their supports. 

Petaluma; the damage was considerable; but compared with the 
 destruction at Santa Rosa, distant only a few miles, the loss was 
 small. 

Palo Alto; much damage was done Ijy the shock to the newer build- 
 ings of Stanford University. The oldest buildings withstood 
 the shock much better. One life was lost.

According to my office clock, and ink mark on barograph sheet, 
 the shock occurred at 5:11 o'clock in the morning (Pacific time). 
 It was the most severe shock of earthquake of which there is any
