EARTHQUAKES OX THE PACIFIC COAST 51 

record. It lasted 47 seconds and the vibrations wrre from south- 
 west to northeast. There were no preliminary tremors, the shock 
 being sudden and the vibrations continuous, with the maximum 
 intensity toward the end. Buildings shook to an alarming degree 
 and several were slightly twisted. One frame building moved 
 about 12 inches to the west. Many chimnej^s toppled over and 
 several hundred panes of glass were broken.' There was no loss 
 of life and the loss to property did not exceed $8,000. The 
 chimneys fell in all directions, but most of them towards the west. 
 The statue of Minerva on the dome of the Court House tipped 
 toward the south until it leaned at an angle of 43 degrees. 

North of Eureka the shock was slight, and reports indicate that the 
 seismic disturbance did not extend more than thirty miles north- 
 ward, but south of Eureka the earthquake was more severe. At 
 Ferndale, 22 miles south, several buildings were demolished and 
 many others badly twisted. Naturally there were wild rumors 
 about crevices, upheavals, and depressions in the earth, but upon 
 investigation it was found that such reports could not be verified. 
 With the exception of a few cracks in the subsoil, and possibly 
 a slight depression in some made land, there were no evidences of 
 an earthquake. All the towns along the coast between Eureka and 
 San Francisco were badly damaged. The nearer they are to San 
 Francisco the greater is the damage. 

Summing up the situation in Eureka and throughout Humboldt 
 county, the earthquake did not do any considerable damage in 
 the aggregate. The sections to suffer the worst were those on low 
 or filled-in land. I am of the opinion that if our buildings had 
 been higher, or the maximum intensity of the vibrations had lasted 
 20 seconds longer, the damage in Eureka would have been much 
 greater. 

A second shock of earthquake occurred on April 18, at 5:22 a. m. 
 and another was felt at 12:25 p. m. These shocks were slight 
 and of short duration. Slight shocks of earthquake also occurred 
 in eai'ly morning of April 19; 3 a. m., 20; 6:07 a. m., 23; 10:30 a. m., 
 27, and at 11:10 p. m., 30. There was quite a severe shock on 
 April 23, at 1:10 a. m., lasting about 14 seconds. The vibrations 
 were from southerly to northerly, being of sufficient violence to 
 shake buildings and stop clocks in different parts of the city. 

1906. April 18; American steamer "Mackinaw," coal laden, from Wash- 
 ington to San Francisco, at 5:10 a. m., while in lat. 38° 23' and 
 long. 123° 24', experienced heavy shock as if ship had struck 
 bottom three distinct times and then slipped over a shoal. Weather 
 calm, sea smooth, no disturbance of sea. — F. S. Meady.
