 extent supersede one acquired abroad, and afford his

To Correspondents. 

Verbal alterations and corrections will be made in 
 printing communications, unless their authors desire 
 them to appear as written, and they will be occasion- 
 ally condensed when it can be done without altering 
 the sense. 

One of our correspondents will observe that we have 
 omitted an article in which he enters upon the ques- 
 tions discussed by our friends Skinner and Carey. — 
 We have done so because we do not wisli to encroach 
 upon the special ground of " The Plough, the Loom 
 and the Anvil," and l^eoause we are not disposed to 
 admit theoretical articles upon political questions 
 which are ably discussed upon both sides by the 
 Whig and Democratic papers. The Farm Journal is 
 intended for readers of all political parties, without 
 being an advocate of the peculiar views of any. 

As a general rule we prefer that contributors would 
 allow their name and place of residence to accompany 
 their articles. When modes of culture are detailed, 
 the nature of the soil should be stated.

This "light" seems to have been named In accord- 
 ance with an etymology formerly given, which derived 
 the latin word lucus a i/roi'c from luceo to gire litjlit, 
 because groves are usually dark. AH who have pre- 
 tended to explain the new light have left some point 
 in darkness, so that tlio public know as little about 
 the matter as they did before the fourth of July .1850, 
 when the whole world was to have an ocular demon- 
 stration of the discovery. 

According to the Paine assertion, water is not com- 
 posed of oxygen and hydrogen, but is a simple ele- 
 ment which he can convert into the condition of oxy- 
 gen or hydrogen at pleasure. 

A person named G. Q. Colton, who claims eight 
 years of chemical experience, gives an explanation 
 and figure of the apparatus used, under date of Janu- 
 ary 2d, 1851. Among other things he tasted the wa- 
 ter in the jai', to satisfy himself " that it was water." 
 But a chemist of eight years standing should have 
 tasted the water in the 'bell-glass,' and above all, that 
 in the ' tumbler,' as the former may have been acidu- 
 lated, and the latter may have contained some sub- 
 stance intended to take up the oxygen through the 
 ' positive' wire, which mayliavebeenhollow, although 
 stated to be flat. A chemist would not have allowed the 
 " electrode box" to pass without examination, and ho 
 might have examined it when he tasted the loatcr in the 

Jar. He does not inform us why the jar did not burst 
 with the pressure of the gas before the stopper was 
 removed to let out the atmospheric air ; nor why the 
 mouth of the outer jar must be closed ; and being 
 closed, how he procured the water which he drank. 

The great power of the machine is said to depend 
 upon the wire of the coils being tubular, and contain- 
 ing half a pint of water, which increases the power 
 10,000 times. The following assertion is cautiously 
 made with regard to Faraday: — " I tJiink, he says, 
 that a single drop of water will contain as much elec- 
 tricity as a thunder cloud — sufficient to burst off the 
 gable end of a house." Some of the newspapers in 
 commenting upon this article have fallen into the 
 trap, and take it for granted that Faraday did make 
 such an assertion. lie may have asserted that it re- 
 quires a great power to separate water into its consti- 
 tuents, which does not help Mr. Paiue's theory ; and 
 were the machine made as stated, the water would 
 actually diminish the effect rather than increase it. 

If one drop of the water in the wire has power to 
 burst out one wall of a house, four drops would de- 
 stroy the house, and four thousand would destroy a 
 town of a thousand houses, so that forts, armies and 
 ships could be destroyed, rocks blasted, and moun- 
 tains leveled. Evil disposed people would have little 
 engines made of three or four drop power to destroy 
 property, and burglars would have smaller ones, of 
 one-twentieth of a drop power, and as large as a tooth- 
 pick, but strong enough to force doors and iron safes. 
 These shonld not be encumbered with the jars and 
 water, because the latter are really not essential to 
 the production of power and light by the electro-mag- 
 netic machine. 

The Paine light wa.s flickering upon a sickly repu- 
 tation, when a new act of the plot appeared in the 
 shape of a letter (in the Boston Transcript of Jan'y 
 30) from one Geo. P. Paine, detaiUng some difficulties 
 in the management of this half a pint of condensed 
 thunder, owing to the occurrence of " nine severe ex- 
 plosions in as many months," none of which however, 
 " burst out the gable end" of the house, although in 
 one case the hydrogen in the decomposing jar is sta- 
 ted to have exploded with a report like that of a six 
 pounder. The final explosion will probably be so 
 gradual that no one will be disturbed by it except the 
 stockholders. 

Obituary. 

We regret that we have to announce the deatli of 
 the distinguished and energetic editor, Joun S. Skin- 
 N'ER, who has been identified during a great part of a 
 long and useful life, with the agricultural improve- 
 ment of the country, first in connexion with the Ainer- 
 i):an Farmer, and at the time of his death with The 
 Plough, the Loom and the Anvil. He was at one time 
 Postmaster of Baltimore ; and previous to commeno*
