Hiiits to Agricultural Writers. 

In the establishment of an Agricultural Journal, 
 you have entered upon a field •where your labour may 
 be turned to a most profitable account. We do not 
 derogate from the character of the farmer, when we 
 assert that they have much to learn of the business in 
 which they are engaged. Agriculture as a Science, 
 to understand it thoroughly, calls into requisition a 
 most extended circle of knowledge, and deniamls an 
 expanded degree of thought and study, which is- in- 
 compatible with the every-day avocations of a farmer. 
 His opportunities and mode of life, forbid tlie appli- 
 cation of his time to such pursuits : ho must deal with 
 practical results attained by others, whoso better o\>- 
 portunities have enaljled them to prosecute the study 
 of scientific knowledge, and i-educe its elements to 
 practical conclusions. This view of the subject seems 
 to point out to you the plan upon which an Agricul- 
 tural Journal should be conducted. To render it 
 valuable it should treat of subjects, and be couched 
 in such language as will be easily understood by that 
 class of readers whom you hope to benefit by your 
 labours. AVhcn we reflect that «very operation on 
 tlie farm is based upon some substantial reason ; that 
 every implement used is formed upon certain fixed 
 mechanical principles, and how little either enters in- 
 to the consideration of the operator, how delightful a 
 task it is to treat of such subjects, and communicate 
 to the farmer in a plain and iutelligiljle phrase- 
 ology the reasons for the work in which ho is en- 
 gaged, or the principles upon which his implements 
 should be constructed. lie knows from experience 
 that certain causes produce certivin results, but how 
 few know why such results are produced, although 
 the reason for each may be a plain simple trutli,' a 
 result of scientific knowledge, easily communicated 
 and as easily understood. Wo can not better illus- 
 trate our views than by referring to certain examples. 
 The experience of every farmer has taught him that to 
 plough land when wet is exceedingly injurious to it: 
 but has the circumstance itself caused him to inquire 
 why it is so 1 Is it too simple a truth to teach that 
 the cultivatei earth has a capacity to feed upon 

that nourishment with whicli it is constantly supplied 
 by the natural elements : — that light and heat are as 
 essential to its capacity for yiroduction as they are to 
 the vitality of the animal body : and that the ofiect of 
 ploughing land when it is wet, is to shut up those 
 mouths and lungs, and make it impervious to ligiit 
 heat and nourishment, and for the want of them it 
 dies ? This idea would give to many farmers a sub- 
 ject for thought, and induce them to carry their re- 
 flections into the whole suljject of ploughing, and wliilo 
 actually engaged in the work, the naturally vigorous 
 mind would expand into the inquiry how it may al- 
 ways be done well. Knowing then, that the object 
 of ploughing is to put the gi'ound in that loose pliable 
 condition, in which it will the )nore readily receive 
 all these advantages which it naturally requires, he 
 will take another step, and inquire into the charac- 
 ter of the plough he uses. Does it make that miscall- 
 ed beaulij'td work, where the ploughed ground is 
 turned over as hard as a pressed brick, over which, 
 you may walk without making a foot print, or does it 
 leave it in the condition which we liave before de- 
 scribed, ready to receive tlie nourishment which so 
 increases its capacity for production. 

This is but one of the thousand plain suggestions 
 which may be ofiered to the intelligent mind of the 
 farmer, calculated to produce thought, excite an in- 
 terest in the business in which he is engaged, and 
 ultimately produce new and practical results. 

Whilst we would not exclude entirely from the 
 columns of your journal, the description of learned 
 theories which pertain to agriculture as a Science, 
 yet its editor should never be unmindful how com- 
 paratively few of his patrons will either read or un- 
 derstand that which is expressed in a phraseology as 
 unintelligible as if it were Greek. 

It will be your province, too, to instill into the 
 minds of farmers a high toned feeling of self respect : 
 that their occupation may not fall below the rest of 
 mankind, in taking rank in that laudably ambitious 
 context, which, in this age, seems to urge the world 
 forward in the race of improvement. Their condition 
 is an isolated one, and they hare a corresponding 
 difFerenee, which restrains them in their intercou/se 
 ■with their fellow men, whilst there is in their occu- 
 pation a subject of thouglit ; an intermingling of the 
 order and beauties of nature, and an indispensable 
 importance in its olijcet design and results, which 
 claim for it that high degree of respect which is al- 
 ways awarded to a well instructed mind. 

Upon the character of your Journal will depend ita 
 usefulness, and its success will be measured by the 
 impression it will make in this particular.

Notwithstanding the great press of private engage- 
 ments, which at the present claim my utmost excr-, 
 tions, and which, like my daily bread, can neither be 
 postponed nor remitted ; yet such are my sympa- 
 thies, that I cannot refuse lending you a helping hand, 
 though the extra job should prove never so hai-d or 
 jading. 

You tell me you are about publishing an Agricul- 
 tural -lournal, and are pleased to think that a few 
 lines from under my hand, might prove serviceable to 
 the undertaking. — Thanking you for the compliment, 
 it becomes me to say however, that my compliance 
 with your request is superinduced by a better feeling 
 than that which moved the crow in the fable, who, on 
 being praised for a fine voice, rendered herself ridicu- 
 lous by attempting to sing — a feeling, that never 
 fails to move me, however indifferently gifted, and
