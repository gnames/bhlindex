■while here he is a constant companion ; there they 
 liave incessant humiility, while here our rain, though 
 more abundant, is less frequent, and rapidly removed. 
 These create great differences in modes of culture, 
 though we have seen but three obstacles to keeping 
 our best grazing grounds in permanent jiasture ; the 
 one is liable to drought; another liability, thesmallsize 
 of the farms; the third, the neglectof manuring. For 
 the first there is no remedy luit the plough, as a long 
 cijutinued drought, such as we had in 1838, repeated 
 in 1844, does so much mischief, that weeds supplant 
 the grasses, and oblige us to farm the ground. A small 
 farm, such as are most of those within thirty miles 
 of the city, also forces the farmer to the plough, or 
 else to a frequent turning up of the same fields, which 
 will inevitaljly do him a great injury, unless he go to 
 the expense of heavy manuring. The third obstacle 
 we have enumerated ; a neglect of manuring is one 
 that has its remedy if the farmer has means, or thinks 
 it will be profitable to employ them in keeping up his 
 grass land. It is no doubt true, that pasture manures 
 itself, that is, the constant decay of vegetable matter, 
 and the droppings of the cattle, form a somewhat 
 slow but still a gradual enrichment of the soil, yet if 
 small portions of lime are occasionally applied, now 
 and then a top dressing of some kind, a really strong 
 ground will put at defiance any punishment from 
 drought, and only give way to the over stocking of 
 some cruel and avaricious master. Any farmer who 
 has a certain number of aci'es well set with natural 
 grasses, cannot be wise in ploughing them. If he 
 grazes, he is sure every year of an investment that 
 will yield him some return without regard to season, 
 he is rid of all anxiety as to crops, and their precari- 
 ousness; and if he be a good judge of stock, and is 
 wary as to his time of selling the crop he has to offer 
 of rich sweet meat, is sure to bring him a good return. 
 There are but two ways iu those portions of this 
 state near the city (where land is dear,) of making 
 it give a good interest for the outlay, or in the 
 value of the farm the dairy and grazing. In either 
 of these, permanent pasture is important, as on such 
 land the milk is considered richer, and the animal 
 fattens far quicker. This we believe is the opinion of 
 all experienced men. To both of these, tillage is dia- 
 metrically opposed, and belongs to another department 
 of agriculture. If carefully managed, the longer land 
 is in grass the more it improves by the formation of 
 vegetable mould. This cultivation and the growing of 
 grain exhausts, so tliat pasture land once put under 
 the plough, may be years in being restored to its 
 original fertility. A. L. Elivyn.

Corn Planting. 

Lancaster, March 15, 1851. 
 Mr. JJdttor: — In regard to the communication 
 wliich you have understood was made to our Agri- 
 cultural Society, I beg leave to explain, that it was 
 read, rather for the purpose of illustrating a plan, or 
 proceeding which had been recommended, than for 
 the value the facts were supposed to po.ssess. An im- 
 portant object of the County Societies, is to bring 
 together and preserve the scattered information ex- 
 isting in the many separate neighborhoods of the dis- 
 tricts in which the societies are formed. Experiments 
 arc often successfully made and useful results obtain- 
 ed, which, for want of means or opportunities of pub- 
 lishing the facts, benefit no one but the experimenter. 
 Varieties of seed, and their preparation, modes of 
 cultivation, manures and fertilizers, choice breeds of 
 cattle and stock, implements of husbandry, fruit trees 

and fruits, are often introduced and approvcil in ono 
 township, of which the ni^xt township knows nothing. 
 But where an agricultural society is in operation, this 
 state of things cannot continue. Each member will 
 bring the contributions of his knowledge and experi- 
 ence to the general fund, which rapidly accumulates 
 for the advantage of all. To promote that object, the 
 members of our Association had been, by a resolu- 
 tion of a former meeting, requested to present at the 
 subsequent meetings, subjects and ciuestions that 
 might occur to them, and which, leading to investi- 
 gation and discussion, might elicit useful facts and 
 very desirable information. As an example of what 
 may be done in this way, the brief paper you referred 
 to, was read to our Society at its last meeting. It 
 related to a method of preparing seed corn for plant- 
 ing, wliich had been communicated to me a short 
 time before, and of which I made a memorandum. 

One of the most discouraging incidents, in the cul- 
 ture of that invaluable ci-oji — Indian Corn, — is the 
 frequentnecessity of extensive re-planting, occasioned 
 by insects preying upon the roots, or birds plucking 
 up and devouring the young plant. 

Mr. M. Zahm informs me, that many years ago, 
 when he tilled some lots in the N. W. section of this 
 city, Mr. R., who owned adjoining fields of similar 
 soil, used to say to him — " IIow is it, that your corn 
 looks so much greener than any other in the neigh- 
 bohood ?" Mr. Z. states that this was a very obvious 
 fact, and he accounts for it in the following manner : 
 When he was about to pilant, he put his seed corn into 
 a vessel, and having dissolved a small quantity of 
 saltpetre in water, poured the solution over the corn 
 until it was covered. lie suffered the grain to con- 
 tinue covered with the water, until it swelled almost 
 to bursting, when it was taken out and planted. lie 
 mentions the following as the effects: — 1. The corn 
 has a deeper and richer green during its growth ; 2. 
 It springs or comes up with more certainty, and 
 grows more vigorously ; 3. Worms, ants, and other 
 insects will not touch it ; 4. Birds avoid it ; 5. It re- 
 (luircs no re-planting ; and G, It ripens two weeks 
 earlier. 

When I asked him particularly about the quantity 
 of saltpetre he used, he said there were two cents 
 worth — just enough to make the water taste of it. — 
 lie also mentioned, that when the corn had come 
 through the ground, he sometimes uncovered the 
 plant and observed numerous minute drops or parti- 
 cles collected upon the roots or small fil^res. He had 
 seen the birds occasionally pull up a plant and im- 
 mediately drop it, without eating any portion of it ; 
 from which he inferred that the saltpetre had impart- 
 ed something that was distasteful to them. To the 
 same cause he ascribes the fact, that the cut-worm 
 which annoyed liis neighbors, never molested his 
 crop. 

He moreover confirms the results of his experience 
 by that of a friend, who adopted his plan of treating 
 his seed corn, and was successful beyond his expecta- 
 tions. 

From the remarks wliich were occasioned by the 
 reading of the foregoing communication, it would ap- 
 pear that this method of preparing corn for planting, 
 although of excellent use in a warm spring, might be 
 prejudicial in a wet and cold one. A gentleman pre- 
 sent, said he had tried it two years, iu one of which 
 it answered well, being followed liy most of the good 
 effects above described, particularly that of repelling 
 birds and insects ; but, in the second year which was 
 Cold and wet, much of the corn rotted in the hills 
 where it was dropped.
