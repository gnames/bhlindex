should be familiar, to enable them to discriminate 
 between those insects " that are their friends, and 
 those that arc their worst enemies." Geology, Min- 
 erology. Botany, — who will pretend that a knowledge 
 of these and various other branches, are of no use to 
 the tiller of the soil ? But the reader may ask, how 
 are farmer's sons and daughters to acquire so much 
 learning ? These things are not taught in our com- 
 mon schools! True, most true, — and never will be, 
 nntil farmers themselves take the matter in hand, and 
 refuse to employ the many ignorant pretenders, and 
 inexperienced boys, who are too lazy to work, and who 
 turn pedagogue as naturally as a tad-polo turns into a 
 frog, because, it is so much more pleasant and con- 
 genial to their natures to set in a -warm room, than it 
 ■would be to go out in the snow and storm to chop 
 wood — besides, many teach school for a few years at 
 the expense of the tax payers merely to qualify them- 
 Bolves for higher branches, careless of their charge, and 
 the consequence is, children go to school year after 
 year, and are none the wiser in the end. 

If farmers would only combine, concentrate their 
 efforts in the right direction, (there is now a fair chance 
 of doing so through the State and County Agricultu- 
 ral Societies,) they would soon find that their influence 
 has more weight than they ever imagined — that they 
 are of some consequence in the body politic, and not 
 as now the mere pack horses, to be used by politi- 
 cians to ride into office. Again, farmers are remiss 
 in not asserting their rights in another direction. — 
 Millions of money are yearly expended by the Na- 
 tional and State Governments for purposes of no util- 
 ity to the farming community, while literally nothing 
 has ever been appropriated towards encouraging ag- 
 riculture, yet the cultivators of the soil are the main 
 stay of all governments. 

Then combine your own efforts for present advance- 
 ment, and educate your children for future usefulness. 

I will add an extract from another publication, for 
 the purpose of showing at a glance, the numerical 
 forces engaged in the various professions, and the in- 
 fluence supposed to be exerted by some of those 
 classea. 

EDfCATION OF THE F.\RMER. 

"It is calculated that the divisions of the occupations 
 of men of the United States, is nearly in the following 
 proportion : — 

Number engaged in Internal Navigation, - 33,076 
 Ocean, " - 56,021 

" " Learned Professions, - 05,255 

" " Commerce, - - 119,607 

" " Manufactures, - - 791,749 

" " Agriculture, - - 3,719,951 

Thus it will be seen that those who are engaged in 
 agriculture, are three and a half times greater in 
 number than those in the other divisions. The agri- 
 culturists consequently have the physical and numer- 
 ical power, and can at any time control every govern- 
 ment in the United States, and give tone to public 
 opinion. But do they? No indeed ; for howeverpow- 
 erful they may be in numbers, they are weak in influ- 
 ence, and this arises from the want of a proper edu- 
 cation. 

The sixty-five thousand two hundred and fifty-five 
 eno-afed in the learned professions are intellectually 
 stronger than the three millions seven hundred ninety 
 one thousand nine hundred and fifty-one, engaged in 
 agriculture, and therefore rule them. If it were not 
 BO, seven-eighths of the offices in the country would not 
 be' held by lawyers and doctors ; nor would all the 
 colleges and high schools bo endowed principally for 
 the benefit of the learned professions. 

Farmers, when will you arouse yourselves to the 
 dignity and importance of your calling, and educate 
 yourselves to the height of intelligence which will 
 make you the rulers instead of the ruled of the other 
 profession ? There is surely nothing to prevent this 
 if you will only be true to 3'ourselves."
