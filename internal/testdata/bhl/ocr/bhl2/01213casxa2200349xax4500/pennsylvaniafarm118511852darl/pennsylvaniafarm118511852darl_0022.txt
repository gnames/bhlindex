familiar to all. Some forms of vegetable life increase 
 their size by a series of deposits on the interior. The 
 cane is an example of this. Others by a succession of 
 layers on the out side. The oak is an example of this. 
 The concentric rings of the oak making these successive 
 annual layers or deposites, counted, will tell the age of 
 the oak, so that there is a connection between the for- 
 mation of such a ring, and the annual motion of the earth 
 around the sun. The relation of vegetable life to differ- 
 ent kinds of soil, is manifest to all. One plant inits na- 
 ture is adapted to a sandy soil ; another to a wet marshy 
 location ; one to a mountain region; another to a low- 
 land country. One requires an excess of sand in the 
 soil ; another an excess of lime. 

Vegetable life has an equally important relation to 
 geographical localities ; one requiring greater warmth, 
 another more cold. In passing from the Equator to the 
 poles, every stage of vegetable life is seen ; and this cor- 
 responding to the altered conditions of climate. Near 
 the Equator the tropical forests, and tropical vegetation 
 are seen ; passing North, the region of the sugar cane, 
 the orange, the cotton, the peach, the apple, the wheat, 
 and the pasture lands, successively appear, and fiir to- 
 ■ward the South, the region of moss shows itself In 
 passing from a flat country in tropical regions, to the 
 top of a high mountain, every stage of vegetation, from 
 tropical plants, to the mosses of northern regions, will 
 appear. To understand this relationship between vege- 
 table and animal life, and the globe, two things are 
 necessary ; first a knowledge of the laws governing ani- 
 mal and vegetable life ; the second, the laws governing 
 the changes of the earth's surface. It should be the 
 province of Agricultural Geology, to investigate these 
 relationships in their several branches, especially the 
 connection between vegetable life and the earth.

Importance of Ventilation, Cleanliness and Drain- 
 ing, for the i«-eservatiou of the Health of Domestic 
 Animals. / 

Brute animals, like the "human race, are subjeet to 
 sickness, and this often to such a fatal extent as to cause 
 great loss to individuals. This difference, however, ex- 
 ists — that human subjects generally recognize their ail- 
 ments on the slightest premonitions, and are thus often 
 led to a timely withdrawal from the sources of mischief, 
 or the adoption of means for arresting its further pro- 
 gress, whilst dumb animals when they once show their 
 sickness, are generally in very desperate conditions. 
 Hence the very large proportions of those attacked with 
 sickness that die, and the great necessity of removing 
 the causes and preventing the occurrence of disease. 

Districts of country which prove unhealthy to man, 
 are equally so to the inferior animals, until these have 
 become acclimated. The symptoms will of course be 
 modified by the differences of organization, and they will 
 therefore vary greatly from those developed in the human 
 family from the action of similar agencies. Thus we 
 often hear of horses having the " Blind Staggers," or 
 the " Yellow Water," or of the prevalence of the " Hol- 
 low-Horn" among neat cattle, the first named affection 
 being a brain fever or malignant typhus, whilst the two 
 last are forms of bilious fever. 

Whenever we find epidemic diseases prevailing amongst 
 the human family, it denotes a condition of the atmos- 
 phere which will exert a malign influence equally upon 
 animals, especially among that most delicate and valua- 
 ble one, the Horse. Greater care than usual should at 
 such times be taken, to avoid the night aii-, and all ex- 
 posm-e to cold and wet, just as we would act for the pre- 
 servation of health within our noble selves. But in 
 housing animals for protection against the inclemencies 
 of the weather, they are often exposed to great dangers 
 from the arrangements of the stables and other buikliugs. 

Dr. T. Southwood Smith, has devoted great attention 
 to the exploration of the causes of sickness, and the 
 means of determining these in England, and from the 
 minute reports made through their complete system of 
 E^gistration, 'wliieh has enabled him to identify sickly 

and healthy localities, with great precision. "When- 
 ever" says he " fever is frequent, there is uniformly a bad 
 drainage, bad sewerage, a bad supply of scavengers, and 
 a consequent accumulation of filth." If a map be drawn 
 or coloured so as to designate the places where fevers pre- 
 vailor have prevailed to a great extent, and showing 
 also the localities where di-ainage has been effected by 
 the Health Commissioners, appointed to attend to this 
 public dutj', it -nill be found that where the commission- 
 ers of sewers have not been, there fevers are still pre- 
 valent ; but wherever they luxve been, there, fevers are 
 comparatively absent. 

Filth and moisture conjoined with heat are the greatest 
 enemies of health. The foul products resulting from the 
 combination of these elements and agents are detrimental 
 to the health of all that breathe the air with which they 
 become blended. 

The addition of lime and plaster to compost heaps, 
 tends to arrest the too sudden decomposition of vegeta- 
 ble and animal matter, that would otherwise, by sur- 
 charging the air, operate injuriously upon the health of 
 animals confined in stables or cattle yards. Hog Pens 
 are perhaps the most frequent generators of foul and pes- 
 tilential air, since they are the common receptacles of 
 every kind of vegetable and animal refuse, with abund- 
 ance of moisture to cause their rapid decomposition. — 
 We very often hear of hogs suddenly dying, in apparent- 
 ly high health, and whilst rolling in fatness. Their loss 
 is generally ascribed to something eaten, of a noxious 
 quality. But the noxious influence which operates in 
 nine out of ten such cases, is the foul air emanating from 
 the reeking collections of filth which are but too often 
 found in and about pig-styes. The losses from this soui'ce 
 if they could be ascertained and estimated, would make 
 an aggregate that would much sm-prisc many who have 
 overlooked this matter. And we may say the same in 
 regard to the pecuniary losses to individuals, — and of 
 course to the coimtry at large, — from diseases and mor- 
 tality among other domestic animals, attributable to 
 causes generally overlooked, and in most instances read- 
 ily removable, through the adoption of proper means to 
 secure ventilation, di'ainage and cleanliness, topics upon 
 which I may again have occasion to trouble you in an- 
 other number of your useful work. 

As one actual occurrence will go farther than fifty un- 
 backed assertions to establish any important fact. AVe will 
 refer to a case which we find in the last edition (1851) 
 of the " Farmer's and Planter's Encyclopoedia." It is 
 there stated under the head of Ventilation — a long and 
 deeply interesting article,— that a farmer had a large 
 number of sheep housed to feed on Mangel Wurtzell, a 
 great number of them sickened and died, killed as he 
 supposed by the food supplied to them. A Veterinary 
 Surgeon who was consulted, and who happend to be 
 well informed upon the subject of the benefits of ventila- 
 tion, pointed out the remedy — a better circulation of 
 fresh air among the over-crowded sheep-fold, after the 
 adoption of which there were no more deaths, and tho 
 sheep throve well. 

One of the greatest safeguards against the generation 
 of noxious airs from putrefaction, is dryness. For, with- 
 out the presence of a certain degree of moisture no de- 
 composition can take place. Sufficient dryness can gen- 
 erally be secured by additions of straw and litter from 
 time to time. Dryness about the manure heaps may by 
 some, be thought to prevent that proper stage of decom- 
 position necessary to bring it into the best state to exert 
 its fertilizing action. This, however, is a topic which 
 may perhaps be taken up separately on some other oc- 
 casion. Meanwhile, we recommend as an essential point 
 for the preservation of health, especially in the latter 
 part of summer and in autumn, the most perfect removal 
 of all stagnant ponds of water from the vicinity of places 
 where horses or any kind of farm stock are accustomed 
 to be kept. £•
