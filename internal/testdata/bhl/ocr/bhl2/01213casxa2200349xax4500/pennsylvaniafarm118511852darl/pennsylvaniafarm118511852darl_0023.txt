Agricultural Schools iu Europe. 

Last year Mr. Hitchcock, President of Amherst 
 College, Mass., -went to Europe, probably on some 
 mission of science, but without any Agricultural do- 
 sign. Soon after his arrival in England, he was in- 
 formed that he was appointed a Commissioner on the 
 subject of Agricultural Schools, and was requested to 
 examine all such institutions in the ditferent nations 
 of Europe, and report thereon to the Legislature of 
 Massachusetts. I have this report before me, and 
 propose the giving to your readers such an abstract 
 of it, as will tell them, how much has been done, by 
 what we call Despotic Europe, and will at the same 
 time, disclose to them how much has to be done, by 
 Republican America. It seems, that in those coun- 
 tries, where our people are taught to believe that the 
 Governors arc all tyrants, and their subjects all 
 brutes ; there are three hundred and fifty-two Schools 
 pf Agriculture, and that the nation most benighted, 
 as wo suppose, has the most, excepting France. 

" Within a few years past, the government of Rus- 
 sia has been much awake to the subject of Agricultu- 
 ral Schools. No less than sixty-eight of these have 
 been established." 

" Since 1845, not less than fifty inferior schools 
 have been established in connection with model farms. 
 Some of them have a four year's course, on farms va- 
 rying from 1,375 to 2,220 acres, with from 100 to 200 
 pupils. They are really of a higher grade than the 
 farm schools of other countries." 

This is the spirit of savage Liberia. The country 
 next to Russia, in the number of its schools, is the 
 one with which this country has more sympathy than 
 with any other, and which we are daily told, is dull 
 and degraded Ireland. She has sixty-three Agricultu- 
 ral Schools. France, has the credit of having been 
 the first country in which an Agricultural School was 
 established, and though now she has 75, yet all, or 
 nearly all, were founded under her Kings. After the 
 guillotine had destroyed a host of her citizens, the 
 sword came into action, while the plough was thrown 
 iuto contemptuous neglect. The chief duty of farm- 
 ers, from the opening of the revolution, during the 
 republic, and under the Empire, was to rear sons 
 f jr the field of battle. A long peace, or rather a par- 
 tial peace, has opened upon the Governors of nations, 
 the absolute necessity of employing and educating, 
 the natural if not intense activity of mind, among 
 those they govern, and the plough is gradually, but 
 surely, making its way, even in despotisms, to a po- 
 sition, a million fold more useful, and quite as exalt- 
 ed as the sword. 

Of all the schools that Mr. Hitchcock visited, or 
 heard of, those of Ireland, appear to have been the 
 most efficient, and the most useful. There are two 
 grades, " Model Agricultural Schools" and " Ordin- 
 ary Agricultui-al Schools." The pupils in the latter, 
 usually quite young, if distinguished, pass into the 
 former, and are fitted to become teachers. In all 
 these schools, of every grade, literary instruction is 
 combined with agricultural ; and indeed, the ordinary 
 schools, are only elementary schools, in which agri- 
 culture is taught." An impression exists, among the 
 people of this state, that every thing like agricultural 
 education, is a mere inculcation of theories. From 
 this, it may be supposed, that it is meant, that a fai'- 
 mer is not to be educated at all, that as the larger 
 part of his work is done by his hands, he has no use 
 for his head, that all science connected with his oc- 
 cupation is worthless, and that a knowledge of the 

principles of the art by which he lives, is a kind of 
 fanciful refinement, beneath his notice. This report 
 shows us how such ideas have been broken up in 
 Europe. 

" It is a most important fact to be noticed respect- 
 ing all the agricultural schools of Ireland, and indeed 
 of all Europe, that are sustained by the government 
 (excepting perhaps in a few colleges) that a farm 
 larger or smaller, is always connected with the school, 
 so diat the theories taught are there tested and ex- 
 hibited in practice. Indeed on the continent in some 
 places, unless the attached farm can lie made to ex- 
 hibit a state of cultivation fully equal to any around 
 it, the government withdraws its support. In these 
 facts we see that the objection so often urged in all 
 countries against agricultural schools, that they teach 
 mere theory, is done away with ; for here, unless the 
 instructors can show the truth of their tlieories in 
 practice, they lose all patronage." 

Institutions like these might be established in this 
 country, with the same results, that we are informed 
 have been brought about in Europe, and they will be, 
 when the people are more fully awakened to their im- 
 portance. A. L. ELWYN.

 Agricultural Schools. The subject is attracting much

Michigan Double Plough. 

Mr. Spongier : — Permit us to call the attention of 
 Farmer's to tbe Michigan Double Plough. We gave it 
 a thorough trial, with three of the best patterns of 
 ploughs in our neighborhood, having spent a full day in 
 testing its qualities in loam, heavy clay and strong soil, 
 and have no hesitation in saying that in any soil the 
 work is more thoroughly and better done, than by any 
 plough we have seen in use. The surface has more the 
 appearance of being spaded than ploughed, and the fur- 
 rows are scarcely distinguishable. 

For the satisfaction of those who have not seen the 
 plough or a draft of it, we give the description of the 
 Patentee. " The plough consists of two ploughs, plac- 
 ed one before the other, on the same beam. The for- • 
 ward one takes a furrow from 3 to 6 inches deep, separ- 
 ating the roots of the grass or vegetable matter, and 
 lays its slice surface down in the bottom of the previous 
 furrow : and the hind one furrows from 5 to 6 inches 
 deeper, and raises and deposits its slice on the top of the 
 former one." 

We thought before trying it, there might be a difficul- 
 ty iu the hinder mould-board raising the ground suffic- 
 iently to mellow, and at the same time to clear the first 
 furrow slice, and leave a clean furrow for the next 
 round. We were agreeably disappointed. The second 
 furrow in the subsoil, by the construction of the mould- 
 board is raised sharply, and broken and mellowed, and 
 spread loosely and evenly over the first furrow ; then 
 leaving a fine and clean soil on which to plant or drill ; 
 and burying grass, sorrel or weeds at a depth we think 
 sufficient to destroy vegetation. 

Although we had not the Dynamometer in the field, it 
 was the opinion of all, that the draft was no greater than 
 the lightest running plough tried in competition The 
 one we tried was right-handed, while ourselves, our men 
 and horses were accustomed to left hand, a disadvantage 
 to the Double Plough in a trial of quality, that will be 
 realized by every farmer. 

Left hand ploughs on the same principle are now be- 
 ing manufactured by Mr. Henry Gilbert of Harri^burg, 
 and if got up as true as the one we tried, they must, 
 both as a sod and stubble plough, supersede the best in 
 use in our neighborhood. A. 0. Hikstkr,
