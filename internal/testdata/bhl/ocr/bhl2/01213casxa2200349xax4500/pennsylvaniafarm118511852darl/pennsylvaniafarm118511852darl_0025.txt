1. Principal Crops. — ^IMieat, corn, pork, oats, clover- 
 eeed, barley, rye, timothy seed, hay, potatoes, butter and 
 cheese. 

2. Wheal. — The usual average product per acre is 1.3 
 bushels. The varieties most approved are AVhite, Blue- 
 etem, Asbridge, Jlediterranean and Valley wheat. The 
 gi-eatest difference in the weight of wheat, in the aggre- 
 gate, is 23 lbs — the poorest weighing 45, the best 68 lbs. 
 The two first named varieties have precedence to all 
 others with which I am acquainted, either from experi- 
 ence or from inquiry — exhibiting, generally, a plump 
 white grain ; their bran and bald head, which render 
 them far more pleasant to handle than bearded varieties, 
 and under favorable culture, and suffering no casuaUties, 
 will yield 30 bushels to the acre. The Mediterranean is 
 sown extensively on account of enduring the winter, and 
 being fly proof, thus measurably escaping two great in- 
 jm-ies. ' The objections to it, by some farmers, are, first 
 — its reddish, brown, color ; second — yielding less than 
 many other kinds ; third — is liable to be prostrated by 
 sliglit winds. This variety is a bearded red chaff. There 
 are many other kinds — stubble, pea, river, white flint, 
 club, &c., all of which possess some one, two or three 
 peculiar characteristics, which render them cither favor- 
 able or objectionable to the farmer. The last named has 
 two high commendations : first, that of enduring a storm 
 that would prostrate aU other varieties ; second, growing 
 erect and yielding well on rich bottom land. The white 
 wheat, astjridge, white, bluestem, white flint, are the 
 varieties from which superfine flour is generally made. 
 There is but little difference in time of ripening, winter 
 kill, rust and and fly, between the last mentioned, (ex- 
 cept the Asbridge, which ripens a few days earlier) than 
 any other kind. Any variety will ripen from two to five 
 days earlier on the north side of land bounded there by 
 wood land, or about the same diffei-enoe occiu's with a 
 field having a southern inclination. 

During the harvest of 1848, there occuiTed frequent 
 rains and and cloudy days, which caused much wheat to 
 sprout just before cutting, so that in the markets it was 
 named forked wheat ; but the .\sbridge was water proof 
 in that respect, haviDg a bright smooth chaff, entirely 
 enclosing the berry. 

The laud best adapted for wheat has a gravelly loam, 
 with ckay sub soil, and is sufficiently undulating to con- 
 duct off all superabundant water. Barn yard manure, 
 well rotted, measurably answers the necessity for lime, 
 as it is a fact noticed by every observing farmer, that 
 our wheat, under a favorable growing season, and suffer- 
 ing no casuaUties, is plump, and yields from 25 to 30 
 bushels to the acre. Lime would be best adapted for 
 rich bottom land, to give solidity to the straw, while 
 barn yard manure would be worse than nothing. The 
 best system of culture is to plow, deep in lauds, 16 feet 
 wide, sowing as near the 20th of September as possible, 
 and harrowing twice the same way. Some fields have 
 been put in with the cultivator and look well. The 
 wheat drill would be the greatest implement of husban- 
 dry that could be introduced into this county. The kind 
 of injuries to which our wheat is most liable, according 
 to their relative extent, is first, fly, drouth, winter kill, 
 rust, &c. The rust was the most extensive injury with 
 us last harvest, extending all over the county. We can- 
 not prevent its ravages, but measurably escape them, by 

sowing on the first of September to ripen early; but in 
 that very attempt we may give license to the fly. The 
 aggregate amount produced this year, is about 45,000 
 bushels. The usu.al yearly average is about 600,000, 
 and from 3 to 400,000 bushels are annually exported. 

3. Corn. — The usual average yield per acre is 50 
 bushels ; this year 65. The varieties are numerous — 
 some of which are the large yellow, white flint, small 
 yellow, and an indiscriminate mixture of various kinds. 
 The large yellow grows very tall, has long large ears, 
 and ripens tolerably early, and is much esteemed by 
 some fanners. The white flint (so called bccaused it is 
 a very hard solid white grain) has a short thick ear, ia 
 hard to husk, and hard to thresh. It moulds easily in a 
 wet husking time, but when well dried weighs CO pounds, 
 and makes excellent fine white meal. The small yellow 
 grows short, has a small red cob, ripens earlier than any 
 other kind, is less Uable to damage by wet weather than 
 any other kind — may be planted early, or as late as the 
 first of June, with great success — producing roasting ears 
 in six weeks. This variety has been grown iunured to 
 in this climate for twenty years, is remarkably easy to 
 husk or sheU, and j'ields more good corn with less labor 
 than any other variety. Of this variety I raised in the 
 year 1847, 133J bushels to the acre, without hoeing. It 
 was checkered and planted two feet ten inches apart, 
 three grains in a hill. The whole crop averaged 110 
 bushels per acre, including a portion of land rather wet. 
 In the year 1848, I introduced a Kentucky variety which 
 averaged 159 bushels per acre, and the best square rod 
 measuring mid way between the rows yielded at the rate 
 of 180 bushels, 1 peck, quarts. It bears some resem- 
 blance to the gourd seed, but it is more soUd. 

4. Oats. — The usual average yield is 30 bushels per 
 acre. The past season 25. The varieties grown are the 
 Native, the English, and Side oats. The native oats is 
 more extensively grown. It yields more in bulk to the 
 acre than the English, but probably not in weight. The 
 former weighing 32, the latter 38 pounds per bushel. 
 The Side oats yields from 5 to 10 bushels more per acre 
 than either of the others, but ripens 8 or 10 days later. 
 The English is the earliest. 

5. Rt/c Sf Barhy. — The usual product per acre is 20 
 bushels. The supposed amount annually raised is, bar- 
 ley 15,000; rye 10,000 bushels. Of the latter, a short 
 variety has been introduced, but as to its character, I 
 know but little ; also spinless barley, which yields weU 
 on rich land. The usual prices are from 40 to 45 cents 
 per bushel. 

0. Grass 4- Hay. — The most approved variety for 
 meadow is timothy, making incomparably more whole- 
 some h.ay than clover, for horses. Clover pasture is ex- 
 cellent for horses and cattle, but in hay it is quite objec- 
 tionable for its great tendency to produce heaves in 
 horses. Its product per acre is one ton — timothy one 
 and a h,alf ton. 

7. Root Crops. — The usual average j'ield of potatoes is 
 40 bushels. This year's growth has been less liable to 
 the rot than usual, though the yield seemed more defici- 
 ent from the quantity planted, owing probably to the 
 drjTiess of the season. The varieties most approved for 
 yield and stock are the large red cudgels, quality for 
 table, the Neshanoch, and pinkeyes. The Neshanock has 
 been the most liable to disease. The best mode of cul- 
 ture is to plant on a loose porous gravellj' loam, plowed 
 8 inches deep, checkered for hills 2 feet 10 inches asun- 
 der, and 3 inches deep. This would leave a loose sub- 
 stratum of 5 inches below the tuber, which is so highly 
 necessary, through which all unnecessary water can 
 reailily filtrate. Lime alone, for manure, is found better 
 than any other one species for potatoes. Lime and 
 ashes have been used to prevent rot, but without benefit. 

Turnips are raised abundantly for table use, but little 
 or no root crops are raised for sale. 

8. Fruit. — The character of our gi-afted fruit is excel- 
 lent, having nearly or quite all the varieties of good
