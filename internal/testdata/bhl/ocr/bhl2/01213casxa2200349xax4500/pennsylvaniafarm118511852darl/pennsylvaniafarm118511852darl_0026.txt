grafted fruit, except peaches, wliich are nearly all seed- 
 ling, and many of them worthless. More than -1-5 of our 
 apples are seedlings, and our grafted fruit is obtained 
 mostly from grafts put on seedlings about 10 years ago, 
 and it is a wonder to every enterprising farmer that 
 thousands of worthless trees are yet standing unrenovat- 
 ed, occupying room where grafted fruit might grow. 
 Fruit is but little exported, either green or dried state, 
 being mostly used for home consumption. 

9. Seeds — The quantity of cloverseed annually pro- 
 duced, is 7000 bushels ; timothy, 4000 ; flaxseed, 1.5,000. 
 The usual average yield per acre is, flaxseed, 10 bushels, 
 worth 80 cts.; cloverseed, 2 J worth $3; timothy, 8 
 bushels, worth $1 37} per bushel. 

10. Other Crops — Flax, but not hemp, is raised to a 
 considerable extent for the fibre ; one acre will yield 1.50 
 ordinary bundles, worth 6J cents, each, when thi-ashed ; 
 when scutched, each bundle yields 5 lbs., worth 8 cts 
 per lb , equal to 52 dollars per acre. Now any man 
 can calculate the expense of harvesting, thrashing, 
 spreading for rotting, turning 3 times, gathering up, 
 drying, breaking, top dressing and scutching, for the 
 amount of the expenses depends much upon the extent of, 
 and convenience of the preparations for getting it out. 
 Tobacco is raised "only for home consumption to a very 
 limited extent. — Field beans, hops, mustard seed, mad- 
 der and mint-oil, command little or no attention. 

11. Dairy Product . — The probable amount of butter 
 manufactured for export is 700,000 lbs. worth 9 cts. per 
 lb. Cheese, 000,000 lbs., worth 5 cts.; the greater part 
 of which is made in the northern part of this county, 
 where the soil is better adapted for the dairy than for the 
 crops. There has been some marked improvement in 
 the quality of cheese and butter, and there are thous- 
 ands of lbs. made here equal to some of the best that was 
 ever offered to an agricultural society. So far as I can 
 ascertain, our native breeds of cows are preferred for 
 dairies, as many of them are extraordinary milkers ; one 
 which I saw, yielded, when at her best, a bushel of milk 
 a day. 

The average yield of butter per cow, is three pounds 
 per week ; cheese seven pounds. Some neat Dui-hams 
 have been introduced by Mr. Stude, of Sullivan, and 
 others. They are represented as more valuable for beef 
 than our native cattle. I am not prepared to state their 
 relative merits for the dairy with our native breeds. 

12. Skcep and Wool. — The aggregate amount of wool 
 is about 200,000 pounds a year. I am informed by an 
 extensive wool merchant and manufacturer, that the 
 quality ranks equal, if not superior to any county in this 
 State. Clearcreek township alone yields 20,000 lbs. fine 
 wool ; 15,000 of which sold for from thirty to thirty seven 
 ajid a half cents, the average is twenty-five cents per 
 pound. 

There is a great increase in the number of sheep, and 
 a great improvement in the character of the flocks. The 
 Dickinson sheep are preferred for their lengthy and fine 
 staple, heavy fleeces and robust constitution. The Saxon- 
 merinoes for the extreme fineness of fibre, and therefore, 
 selling at the highest prices. The South Downs are be- 
 coming numerous on account of their large size, heavy 
 fleeces, fatting ea sily , and are therefore of ready sale to 
 the butchers. So each variety has its own important 
 peculiarity, which renders it diflicult to decide what kind 
 is most preferred. 

13. Pork^ — The supposed aggregate products of pork 
 in the county is 15,000 barrels. Its value here will av- 
 erage $2,75 per hundred. — The hog stock has retrograd- 
 ed for the last eight years, owing to the indifl'erence of 
 farmers in that department. Fourteen years ago, a num- 
 ber of Bcrkshires and Chinas were introduced, and a 
 cross of these were the neatest and most profitable ever 
 raised. There are a few left, and farmers are improving 
 upon them. There are some grass breeds here which 
 grow large, and appear well when fat, but they are hard 
 to keep or fattea. Upon the whole, a perfect cross of 

the Berkshire and China is preferred as the most profit- 
 able, as they fatten very easily at any age. If pigged 
 in March, they may be butchered in November, weigh- 
 ing 200 lbs. They are much noted for their harmless 
 and docile disposition ; and we consider that kind of a 
 hog is the best which will produce the most pork in the 
 shortest time with the least possible expense. 

14. Beef. — The number of cattle annually raised in the 
 county, is 7000, of these, 3000 are used for home con- 
 sumption, and the rest exported. The average value of 
 each, at 3 years old, is 15 dollars. 

15. Horses and Myites — The number of horses annually 
 exported, is about 2,500. This county has always been 
 noted for its great number of good horses, and great ex- 
 ertions are made by our farmers to raise good draught 
 horses. They generally range from a medium to a large 
 size, and frequently sell at 125 dollars a head. The av- 
 erage value at 3 years old, is 75 dollars. The number of 
 mules is very small, and farmers have no inclination to 
 raise them ; probably on the ground of their ill appear- 
 ance, without considering their relative merits. 

16. Implemcnls. — The only implements or machinery 
 introduced, are threshing machines, and clover hidlers of 
 the best kind, a few rollers and some good plows. A 
 wheat di'ill from New York, and a drain plow from Indi- 
 ana, were exhibited here, but no sales were effected. 

17. Other Improvements. — There have been no experi- 
 ments in the renovation of the soil worth naming, except 
 with barn yard manure. Lime is obtained from a dis- 
 tance, at too great an expense to apply it profitably to 
 our soil. Our creek bottoms are almost inexhaustably 
 fertile. I htive a piece now iu corn which has been un- 
 der cultivation for 13 years in succession, with but one 
 manuring and 2 years in clover, and yet the tenth crop 
 yielded 133 J bushels of shelled corn to the acre without 
 hoeing. This year it yielded 70, with the same cultm-e, 
 thoiigh planted June 4th, (rather late. ) 

Drainage is eS'ected to some extent with plow and 
 spade, and to great advantage. There is nothing at 
 present in the whole process of agriculture, from which 
 farmers would derive greater profits from a small amount 
 of labor or capital, than by draining the thousands of 
 fertile acres iu different parts of this county, grown over 
 with wild grass, and covered several months of the year 
 with water. To render such land most profitable with 
 the least expense, is to cut drains in a dry time, mow off 
 the wild grass, and sow timothy, either in July or August, 
 or early in the spring ; and in a few years the timothy 
 will entirely usurp the growth of wild grass, and yield 
 2} tons per acre, or 10 or 15 bushels of seed. 

18. Minerals. — There have been no discoveries of min- 
 erals worth naming. There is considerable of what we 
 call bog ore, some of which bears a close resemblance to 
 iron ore, and it is said, would yield 75 per cent, proba- 
 bly of good iron ; a sample of which 1 will deliver in 
 Ashland for investigation. 

19. Mills, 4-c. — There are 36 grist mills, 57 saw mills, 
 10 carding machines, 5 foundries, and 1 woollen factoi-y. 
 This factory is situated in the heart of Ashland, and the 
 whole superstructui-e, including engine tpd internal ma- 
 chinery, is entirely new and fitted up in the most skil- 
 ful style; is now in complete operation; is capable of 
 manufacturing 40,000 lbs. of wool a year ; and is not to 
 be surpassed in all Northern Ohio for the execution of 
 neat work. And here I must add, that the proprietors, 
 Messrs. Northrop, Reznor & Co., are entitled to much 
 respect and patronage by the farmers of Ashland coimty, 
 for this exhibition of enterprize and skill. Immediately 
 adjoining is a splendid mill, now being erected by the 
 same company. It wiU also be driven by steam ; will 
 have three run of stone, and the internal aiTangements 
 are also intended to be fitted up in complete style, and 
 when completed in connection with the factory, will have 
 cost $20,000.
