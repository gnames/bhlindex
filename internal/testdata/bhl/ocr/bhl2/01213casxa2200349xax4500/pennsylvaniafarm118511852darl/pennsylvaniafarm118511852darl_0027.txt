Report of the Joint Committe of the Senate and House 
 of Representatives of Pcnnsylcania, on the piiblica- 
 iion of the Geological Surveys. Uarrisburg, Maxell 
 1851, pp. 16. 

The delay in puWishing the Geological surveys of 
 Pennsylvania has been a matter of regret among the 
 friends of science, and those having mining and agri- 
 cultural interests throughout the state. The survey 
 ■was well conducted through a series of years, and 
 Trhen nearly ready for publication it was stopped, 
 ■whilst other states, with fewer resources, and com- 
 mencing similar undertakings about the same period 
 (or even subsequently) have given their results to the 
 ■world. Thus in a geological map of the United States, 
 Pennsylvania, with its well known wealth in coal and 
 ores, and possessing some of the most interesting fea- 
 tures in the geology of the country, remains a blank. 
 We have reason to believe, from the language used 
 by Mr. Bigham in this well 'va-itten Report, that these 
 valuable materials will be no longer kept from the 
 citizens of the state ; and when given, we hope the 
 necessary maps, drawings, and other illustrations, 
 will be published in fuU. 

The following estjacts from the Report, place the 
 connexion between geology and agriculture in a clear 
 light. 

To that groat leading interest agriculture, a geological 
 survey is both directly and indirectly beneficial, to an 
 extent -which -well deserves the careful consideration, not 
 only of every farmer, but of the Legislature. It con- 
 duces directly to this interest by pointing out the sources 
 from whence the various soils of the region are derived, 
 and the belts of country where the same soils prevail, 
 so that the agricultm-al experience of separate localities 
 upon identical soils may be compared together. It 
 analyses the strata, and sho^ws which layers are fertiliz- 
 ing and which not, and ti'aces on the geological map 
 SQch as are natural manures, discriminates between the 
 pvire limestones and the maguesian ones, between those 
 which possess the all-powerful element of phosphorus 
 and such as do not, and indicates what shales and other 
 constantly decomposing strata are already naturally 
 calcareous or gypseous, and are competent of themselves, 
 by proper mechanical treatment, to replenish the soil 
 eufl&cieutly with lime and plaster, and what others are 
 destitute of these essential elements, and yield soils 
 which reqmre their artificial introduction. It calls at- 
 tention furthermore to, and furnishes in fact much 
 knowledge indispensible to any right system of drainage. 

An improved and truly economical culture of the soil 
 must be found upon an exact knowledge of the materials 
 of which the soil is composed, and this indispensable 
 knowledge can only be procured through a careful study 
 of the rocks or strata out of which the soils are derived. 
 Jlence it is, that Geology is now universally regarded by 
 the professional teachers, scientific writers, and the most 
 Bkilful men of practice in agriculture, as eijually funda- 
 mental with chemistry, in its relations to sound methods 
 of cultivation. Of this no better proof need be asked 
 than the titles and scope of all the treatises, both com- 
 prehensive and abridged, of one who is perhaps the ablest 
 expounder of the principles of this great art now living, 
 Trofessor James F. W. Johnston, of England, who has 
 devoted the labors of a lifetime to the production of 
 works expressly on " Agricultural chemistry and Geolo- 
 gy." In a recent "Report on the .agricultural capabili- 
 ty of the Province of New Erunsis'ick," he illustrates in 
 various ways, how "the possession of a good geological 

map is of much importance to a State, as an aid in de- 
 termining the cultural value of its surface, of what it is 
 capable, and how its capabilities are to be developed." 

A little consideration of a few fundamental facts in 
 agricultui-e and geology, will render obvious the advan- 
 tages which the intelligent farmer may derive from a 
 knowledge of the strata of the district where he dwells. 

The first practical problem which the agricultm-ist in 
 any region must study, is the adaptation of the crop to 
 the soil, the climate, and the market. But to know its 
 adaptability to the soil, he should have a clear conception 
 of the nature and composition of the sti-ata around them ; 
 for without this knowledge he can get no ti-ue insight 
 into the chemical and mechanical properties of the soil, 
 which is nothing else than the substance, in whole or 
 part, of those rocks in a decomposed or decayed condi- 
 tion. 

The whole art of preserving or improving the fertility 
 of a soil, consists in replenishing it with those elements 
 which the crops are ascertained to abstract, and in the 
 proportions suitable to repair the waste, and to meet the 
 indispensable demands of vegetation. But how can these 
 proportions be known, unless we previously ascertain 
 what the decomposing rocks themselves supply, and 
 what they fail to furnish. When it is understood that a 
 soil to be truly fertile, must consist of at least the fol- 
 lowing substances, some of them in large and some in 
 minute quantities, and that they are all equally necessa- 
 ry to its productiveness, the importance of a con-ect 
 geological knowledge, indicating their presence or ab- 
 sence in a particular locality, will be plainly perceived 
 — silica, alumina, lime, magnesia, oxide of iron, potash, com- 
 mon salt, and pkospltm ic acid — and this will be stUl more 
 distinctly seen wlien the inorganic elements in any of the 
 ordinary crops are shown in comparison. In the case of 
 red clover hay, as an example, there are silica, lime, mag- 
 nesia, oxidof iron, sulphuric acid, pliosplwric acid, potash, soda, 
 and chlorine, in all one hundred and twenty-nine and a- 
 half pounds in a ton of hay. As the abstraction from 
 the soil of either of these ingredients wUl greatly impair 
 its suitableness for this particular crop, it is manifest 
 that it behooves the farmer, as a fii-st step to the skilful 
 culture of his land, to learn from the composition and 
 geological origin of the rocks which have produced and 
 are stiU producing his soil, whether these various con- 
 stituents, indispensable to his purpose, are naturally 
 there and Ukely to be renewed, and which of them he 
 must himself suppl}'. 

The animal which cannot thrive without a due propor- 
 tion of lime and phosphorus in its bones, can by ranging 
 widely for its food be almost sui-e of those ingredients ; 
 but the plant is rooted to one spot, and if these and the 
 other earthly elements, not less indispenstible to its nu- 
 trition, are not immediately within its reach in the soil, 
 the farmer must iutroduce them. But how can he possi- 
 bly know what it is thiit is deficient, until the chemical 
 geologist makes it clear to him, from a previous study of 
 the composition of the rocks and of the soUs into which 
 these rocks decay. 

It may be stated as an undeniable truth, that without 
 an acquaintance with the local geology of his vicinity, 
 the agriculturist can never avail himself of the whole of 
 his natui-al resources, or make due and gi-ateful acknowl- 
 edgements in his industrial practice of the bountiful 
 sources of wealth which the beneficent Creator, with 
 lavish kindness, has spread beneath his feet. To till the 
 earth and call forth her fruits, is the happy destiny as- 
 signed to the great mass of mankind, but through it 
 there would seem to be in reserve a destiny still nobler, 
 the cultivation of his own faculties and powers, result- 
 ing from his eagerness to convert to human uses, by in- 
 crease of knowledge, the quaUties of common things. In 
 studying the very commonest of these, if they be but the 
 crumbUng clods of stone that strew his fields, he sees 
 everywhere that the physical laws are divine appoint- 
 ments.
