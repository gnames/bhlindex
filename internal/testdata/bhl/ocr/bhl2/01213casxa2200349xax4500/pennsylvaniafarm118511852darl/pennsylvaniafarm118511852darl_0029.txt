Praclical Mineralogy, assaying and mining t^-c. by Fred- 
 erick Overman, Mining Engineer. Pliiladelphia, 
 Lindsay and Blalsiston 1851. pp. 230. 
 This is a useful work, tlie scope of wliich is thus ex- 
 plained. " It has always teen the desire of the author, 
 to place before the public the characteristics and uses of 
 minerals in a popular style, and clothed with a popular 
 language. For this reason he has endeavored to avoid, 
 as far as possible, the use of any scientific and technical 
 terms, as having a tendency to embarrass, rather than 
 to enlighten the reader." 

It is not by any means " generally agreed that granite 

is the oldest of the rocks." p. 14. The statement as to 

its " everlasting durability" must be acted upon with 

caution, as some apparently good granites decompose. 

Granite is composed of quartz, felspar, and mica, so that 

it is not correct to say that mica " is sometimes found to 

be one of its elements." When hornblend replaces the 

mica, the rock is syenite, and when the rock is composed 

of quartz and felspar alone, it is named granilite.

A large unclassified collection with many useful things, 

containing portions which encourage quackery and the 

manufacture of adulterated articles. A few medical 

directions for emergencies are proper, but domestic 

meddling with arsenic and other active medicines, and 

with serious diseases,is not to be recommended. Of course 

many of these nostrums will do as little harm as good. 

The Farmer's and Planter's Encyclopedia of rural 

affairs ; embracing all the most recent discoveries in 

Agricultural chemistry, etc. by Cuthbert W. Johnson, 

Esq., F. R. S. adapted to the United States by Gouv- 

erneur EmersMi, Philadelphia. Lippincot, Grambo, 

& Co. 1851. pp. 1179. 

This is a new edition of a large and valuable work 
 which every farmer should have at hand as a book of 
 constant reference, for which its alphabetical arrange- 
 ment well adapts it. It is illustrated with numerous 
 plates of domestic animals, implements, grain, weeds, 
 noxious insects, &c. 

The present edition contains a new article on soil, an 
 extended one on ventilation, especially as regards the 
 health and food of animals, various tables are given of 
 the constituents of food and its money value and bearing 
 upon the fattening of animals ; and the influence of heat 
 and cold in connexion with food is satisfactorily ex- 
 plained. 

Another important addition entitled American Wine 
 making, particularly as it is made at Cincinnati, where 
 Mr. Longworth manufactures it so successfully that it 
 can be brought into competition with the best foreign 
 wines, bis champagne being worth from twelve to fourteen 
 dollars a dozen. This wine is called ' Sparkling Catawba,' 
 YOL. I. â€” E, 

being made of the native Catawba grape, wliich Messrs. 
 Longworth and Buchanan have found to be the best 
 adapted for wine making in this country. To arrive at 
 this result many years were spent in experiments upon 
 a large scale, and many thousand plants were imported 
 from the best wine bearing regions of Europe, carefully 
 cultivated, and finally rejected as not adapted to our 
 climate. The cultivation of the grape and the process of 
 wine making arc detailed in this Encyclopedia. 

A Treaties on the Ilistory and manarjement of ornamen- 
 tal and domestic Poultry. By Her. Edmund Saul 
 Dixon, A. M. With large additions by J. 3. Kerr 
 M. D. Illu,strated with niany original portraits, 
 engraved expressly for this work. Philadelphia, 
 E. U. Butler & Co. 1851. pp. 480. 

This work enjoys a higli reputation in England, 
 and the American edition has much new matter 
 adapting it to the present state of knowledge upoa 
 the subject in the United States. It is from the se- 
 cond English edition, which bears the date of Feb- 
 ruary 1851, so that the author's latest additions are 
 included. 

The volume is full and practical upon rearing, man- 
 agement, eggs, coops, and varieties and qualities of 
 the various breeds of chickens, and it includes ac- 
 counts of the pea-fowl, pheasant, turkey, guinea-fowl, 
 swan, geese, and ducks. The engravings are accu- 
 rate, and well executed, many of them from original 
 figures drawn by Croome from fine living Americau 
 examples. 

The American editor has done well to introduce 
 figures of the wild breeds from which the domestic 
 races of chickens have been derived; and to guarantee 
 the authorit}- of the originals ho had drawings made 
 from specimens in the magnificent ornithological col- 
 lection of the Academy of Natural sciences of Phila- 
 delphia. He has inserted various letters from his cor- 
 respondents, among whom David Taggart of Nor- 
 thumberland, Pa., E. R. Cope of Philadelphia, and 
 Geo. P. Burnham of Melrose, Massachusetts, may be 
 mentioned. 

Mr. Dixon has ventured to discuss various quea 
 tions relating to the origin of domestic races, and ha 
 solves one in a very summary manner by the theory 
 that those domestic animals (and few would be ex- 
 cluded from this grasping generalisation) which can- 
 not be readily referred to wild forms, are the descend- 
 ants of species now extinct ; whilst certain varieties 
 are believed to have been at all times as distinct as 
 they now are ; but we are not aware that the author 
 possesses a sufiicient knowledge of technical zoology 
 to make him a competent judge in these questions, 
 which are now under investigation by Dr. Samuel 
 George Morton, and the Pvev. John Bachman. He 
 does not think it necessary to give scientific names, 
 and when he does, the adjective or trival part of the 
 name is improperly written with a capital letter.
