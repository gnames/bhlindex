Egg Poke. — Tliree eggs, a quart of corn flour, a 
 largo tablcspoonful of fresh butter, a small tea-spoon- 
 ful' of salt, a half pint (or more) of milk. Beat the 
 eggs very light, and mix them with the milk. Then 
 stir in, gradually, the corn flour ; adding the salt and 
 butter. It must not be a batter, but a soft dough, 
 just thick enough to bo stirred well with a spoon. If 
 too thin, add more corn flour ; if too stiff, thin it with 
 a little more milk. Beat or stir it long and hard. 
 Butter a tin or iron pan. Put the mixture into it : 
 and set the pan immediately into an oven, which 
 must be moderately hotat first, and the heat increas- 
 ed afterward. A Dutcli oven is best for this purpose. 
 It should take an hour and a half or two hours, in 
 proportion to its thickness. Send it to table hot, and 
 cut into slices. Eat it with butter or molasses. 

Poisonous Vessels. — Vessels of copper often give 
 ri.se to poisoning. Though the metal undergoes but 
 little change in a dry atmosphere, it is rusted if mois- 
 ture be present, and its surface becomes covered with 
 a green substance — carbonate or the protoxide of cop- 
 per, a poisonous compound. It has sometimes hap- 
 pened, that a mother has, for want of knowledge, 
 poisoned her family. Si>urkrout, when permitted to 
 stand some time in a copper vessel, has produced 
 death in a few hours. Cooks sometimes permit pickles 
 to remain in copper vessels, that they may acquire a 
 rich green color, which they do by absorbing poison. 
 Families have often been thrown into disease by eat- 
 ing such dainties, and may have died in some instan- 
 ces, without suspecting the cause. De. Thompson. 

IIow TO Cure a Cold. — Of all other means of cur- 
 ing colds, fasting is the most effectual. Let whoever 
 has a cold eat nothing whatever for two days, and his 
 cold will be gone, provided he is not confined in his 
 bed — because by taking no carbon into the system by 
 food, but consuming that surplus which caused his 
 disease by breath, he soon carries off his disease by 
 removing the cause. This will be found more eficc- 
 tual if he adds copious water drinking to protracted 
 fasting. By the time a person has fasted one day and 
 night, he will experience a freedom from pain and a 
 clearness of mind, in delightful contrast with that 
 mental stupor and physical pain caused by colds. 
 And how infinitely better is this method of breaking 
 tip colds, than medicines, especially, than nolent 
 poisons. 

Barley Soup. — 3 oz. of barley ; IJ oz. of stale 
 Ijread crumbs ; salt, and parsley. Wash and steep 
 the barley for 12 hours, in J pint of water to which a 
 piece of carbonate of soda (the size of a pea) has been 
 added ; then pour off the water not absorbed, and add 
 the crumbs of stale bread, 3 quarts of boiling water, 
 and the salt. Digest these in a salt-glazed covered 
 jar, in the oven or (boil them slowly in a well-tinned 
 covered pan,) for from 2 to 4 hours, adding the chop- 
 ped parsley and a little pepper, 30 minutes before the 
 expiration of the time for boiling. 

Cheap Oil for Kitchen Lamps. — Let all scraps of 
 fat bits left on the dinner plates, and all drippings be 
 set in a cold place. Put the fat in an iron pot, filling 
 it half-way up with fat ; and pour in sufficient cold 
 water to reach the top. Set it over the fire, and boil 
 and skim it till the impurities are removed. Next 
 pour the melted fat into a large broad pan of cold 
 water, and set it away to cool. It will harden into a 
 cake. — Then take out the cake and put it away into 
 a cool place. When wanted for use, cut ofi' a suffic- 
 ient quantity, melt by the fire till it becomes liciuid, 
 and then fill the lamp with it, as with lard. It will 
 give a clear, bright light, quite equal to that of lard, 
 and better than whale oil ; and it costs nothing but 
 the trouble of preparing the fat. 

Barleu Water. — 1 oz. of pearl barley and 2 pints 
 of water. Boil the barley in the water till it is re- 
 duced to 1 pint; then strain, and sweeten, flavoring 
 ■with the essence of lemon, rind of lemon, raisins, or 
 current jelly. Although the additions to the barley 
 water render it more agreeable, they, however, lessen 
 its diluent properties. — Vegetarian Messenger. 

White-wash. — Take two quarts of skimmed milk ; 
 two ounces of fresh-slacked lime ; two pounds whit- 
 ing ; or the same proportions for any large quantity. 
 Put the lime into a stone vessel, and pour upon it a 
 sufficient quantity of milk to make a mixture reseml)!- 
 ing cream ; then add the remainder of the material. 
 When this is done, crumble and spread the whiting 
 on the surface of the fluid, in which it will gradually 
 sink. It must then be well stirred, or ground, as 
 any other paint. By the addition of any coloring 
 matter, you may make it suit your fancy. It must 
 be put on with a paint brush, and when dry, a second 
 coat should be given. The quantity named, is sufli- 
 cient for twenty-five square yards. 

Moulded Barley: — 6 oz. of pearl barley, 3 J pints 
 of water, and sugar. Steep the barley for an hour ; 
 drain it, and pour the water boiling upon it, let it 
 stew quickly in the oven in an earthenware jar, cov- 
 ered, until perfectly soft, and all the water is absorb- 
 ed. When about half enough, add the sugar, and 
 essence of lemon, to the taste. Pour it into a mould, 
 previously dipped in cold water, and let it stand to 
 set. When boiled quickly, the above quantity re- 
 quires 2 J hours, and is a much better color than when 
 it is longer in preparation. When the barley flour is 
 used, no steeping is required. 

Beef Tea. — Cut a pound of lean beef into thin 
 slices, put it into three pints of cold water, set it over 
 a gentle fire where it may become gradually warm, 
 let it be well skimed, cover the saucepan close, and 
 boil gently for two hours ; strain it and let it stand to 
 settle, and then pour it off clean. One onion, a few 
 peppercorns, and a little salt, may be added if re- 
 quired. 

Mutton Broth. — Put into a two-quart saucepan 
 one pound of mutton chops, cleared from fat, one 
 onion, a few corns of black pepper, and three pints of 
 cold water ; let it warm gradually ; when it boils, 
 .skim it, cover the pan close and set it over a gentle 
 fire till the chops are cooked, which will be (if the 
 meat is not too fresh,) in three-quarters of an hour. 

To MAKE Liquid Glue. — One quarter of a pound 
 avoirdupois of shellac, dissolved in three ounces apothe- 
 caries' measure of naptha ; put the shellac into a 
 wide-mouthed bottle, and pour the naptha upon it ; 
 cork it up, and stir it with a piece of wire two or three 
 times during the first 36 hours. It can be made with- 
 out any measurement, by adding shellac to naptha 
 until it becomes of the consistency of cream. When 
 the shellac is thoroughly dissolved in naptha, it forms 
 a liquid glue always ready for use.
