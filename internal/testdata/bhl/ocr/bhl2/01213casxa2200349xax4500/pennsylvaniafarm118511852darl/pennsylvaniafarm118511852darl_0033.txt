Short-Horned Cattle. 

From the earliest periods the counties of Durham 
 and York have been celebrated for their Short-horns, 
 but principally, in tlie first instance on account of 
 their reputation as extraordinai-y milkers. In this 
 particular, it may be asserted, that as a breed, they 
 Lave never been equalled. But, while excellent 
 milkers, they were found to be slow feeders, and con- 
 sequently slow fatteners, producing an inferior meat, 
 nut marbled or mixed with fat and loan, and income 
 cases the lean was found of a particularly dark hue. 
 To retain tlieir extraordinary milking properties, and 
 at the same time make good fatteners of them was 
 an object long sought, and at length found. 

The Yorkshire cow, which now almost exclusively 
 occupies the London dairies, is an unanswerable proof 
 of the possibility of uniting the two qualities to a 
 great degree of perfection, but not at the same time : — 
 they succeed to each other, and at the periods when 
 it suits the convenience of the dairyman that they 
 should. Years ago the Yorkshire cow was, compar- 
 ed with other breeds, as great a favorite in the Lon- 
 don market as at present. She yielded more milk, in 
 proportion to the quantity of food consumed, than 

could be obtained from any other breed ; but when 
 the dairyman had liad her four or five years, she be- 
 gan to fall ofi", and he dried her and sold her. It 
 took a long time to get much flesh upon her ; and 
 when he calculated the expense of bringing her into 
 condition, he found that his cheapest way was to sell 
 her for what she would fetch, and that seldom ex- 
 ceeded bl. 

By degrees, however, the more intelligent of the 
 lireeders began to find that, by cautiously adopting 
 the principle of selection — by finding out a short-horn 
 bull whose progeny were generally milkers, and 
 crossing some of the old Y'oi'kshires with him, — but 
 still regarding the milking properties of the dam, and 
 the usual tendency to possess these qualities in the 
 offspring of the sire, — they could at length obtain a 
 breed that had much of the grazing properties of the 
 short-horn in the new breed, and retained, almost un- 
 diminished the excellences of the old breed for the 
 pail. Thence it has happened that many of the cows 
 in the Loudon dairies are as fine specimens of the im- 
 proved short-horns as can possibly be produced. They 
 do not, perhaps, yield quite so much milk as the old 
 ones, but what they do yield is of better quality ; and 
 whether the dairyman keeps them a twolvemontli or 
 longer — and this is getting more and more the hal)it 
 of tliese people — or whether he milks them for three 
 or four years — as soon as he dries them, they fatten 
 as rapidly as the most celebrated of the high bred 
 short-horns.

THE YORKSHIKE COW. 

We give a fair specimen of one of these cows : the 
 character of the Ilolderness and the short-horn beau- 
 tifully mingling. A milch cow good for the pail as 
 long as wanted, and then quickly got into marketable 
 condition, should have a long and rather small head ; 
 a Large-headed cow will seldom fatten or yield much 
 milk. The eye should be bright, yet peculiarly placid 
 and quiet in expression ; the chaps thin, and the horns 
 small. Tlie neck should not be so thin as common 
 opinion has given to the milch cow. It may be thin 
 towards the head ; but it must soon begin to thicken, 
 and especially when it approaches the shoulder. The 
 dewlap should be small ; the breast, if not so wide as 

in some that have an unusual disposition to fatten, 
 vet very far from being narrow, and it should project 
 before the legs ; the chine, to a certain degree fleshy, 
 and even inclining to fullness ; the girth behind the 
 shoulder should be deeper than it is usually found in 
 the short-horn ; the ribs should spread out wide, so 
 as to give as round a form as possible to the carcass, 
 and each should project farther than the preceding 
 one to the very loins, giving, if after all the milch 
 cow must be a little wider below than al)Ove, yet as 
 much breadth as can possibly be afforded to the more 
 valuable parts. She should be well formed across the 
 hips and on the rump, and with greater length there
