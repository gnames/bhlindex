cold enough to freeze the ground, and taken off in 
 mild pleasant weather. They may be protected in 
 this way until they are high enough to bush, and en- 
 joy all the advantages of rain and sunshine where 
 they are to grow. If the storm is heavy, they may 
 also be protected from it, by replacing their covering. 
 As the spring advances, the hot and dry nature of 
 the manure might, under ordinary circumstances, be 
 injuriously to the plants : but this we provide against. 
 When our peas come up, they are an inch perhaps 
 below the surface, and the earth taken from the trench 
 is some of it yet remaining to supply the deficiency. 
 So when the peas are high enough, and the weather 
 growing milder, we replace the earth until the trench 
 fs level'with or higher than the adjoining surface. — 
 This gives strength and firmness to the plants, utter- 
 ly destroys all weeds which may be starting from the 
 manure, and prevents the heat and dryness of the 
 soil which is incident to placing hot and fermenting 
 manures near the surface. We speak of this method 
 which we have found in our case to be a very good 
 one, and leave for others to adopt or reject as they 
 choose. Yours truly, AVm. Bacon.

 Planting Strawberry Beds. 

If you wish the largest and finest fruit, you must 
 make the soil deq) and rich. The best manure for 
 the strawberry, is either Poudrette, {we can recom- 
 mend that of the Lodi Manufacturing Co., New 
 York,) or decomposed stable manure. If you have 
 these, trench the soil two feeet deep, mixing in ve- 
 ry liberal dressings of either of these manures, 
 throughout the whole depth. Supposing, as is too 
 often the case with beginners, that you have nothing 
 but frest stable manure, then, when you are treneh- 
 ino-, bury this stable manure in the lower spit, ( i. e., 
 the'lowcr of the two feet trenched.) To give it a good 
 manuring, you should trench in as much stable ma- 
 nure as will be equal in bulk to one-third of this 
 lower foot of earth. The reason for trenching it 
 among the lower spit is, that it may be decomposed 
 before the roots of the strawberries reach it. If mix- 
 ed with the top spit, it would do more harm than 
 good. 
 Having thus trenched and manured the sou, form it 
 into beds three and a half feet wide. Draw three 
 lines lengthwise through the beds, and set the young 
 plants along these lines, about 4 inches apart. Dur- 
 ing the summer, the beds must be kept stirred with 
 the hoe, and all runners should be cut off, that ex- 
 tend more than a couple of inches beyond the lines, 
 Y'^ou will thus have three roios of strawberries about 
 ten inches apart — between which, the next season, 
 you can lay straw or tan-bark, which will both keep 
 down the weeds, and keep the fruit clean. This straw 
 or tan may thereafter keep its place — the runners 
 must be kept clipped, and a little additional straw 
 or tan laid over the plants at the approach of winter, 
 and removed again in the spring. 

In this way — digging in a top-dressing of sj^ent 
 manure or poudrette between the rows every spring, 
 your strawberry beds may be kept in good condition 
 for four years — at the end of which time they must 
 be abandoned, and new ones planted to take their 
 place. 

If, however, you do not wish the trouble of culti- 
 vating the plants so carefully, then plant them in the 
 same way, and allow the runners to cover and occu- 
 py the whole bed. This they will do the same sea- 
 son, and the next year wil, give you an abundant 
 crop — the fruit not so large as in the first case, but 

perhaps rather more in quantity. But the bed will 
 only last one year, and you must make a now one 
 every spring, to supply the place of the old one. 

As to sorts, if you are to plant but three, let them 
 be Large Early "Scarlet, Burr's New Pine, and IIo- 
 vey's Seedling. If four, add Kival Hudson ; if five, 
 Svvainstone Seedling. There are many other good 
 sorts, but this selection will probably prove most val- 
 uable to you. The Whiie-wood is a nice, delicate, 
 small fruit, and bears a long time, and is a pretty 
 contrast in a dish of red strawberries. 

Agricultural ilTcctiiig. 

Lancaster County Agricultural Society. 

We present the following synopsis of the proceed- 
 ings of this Society, at its last meeting at the Me- 
 chanics' Institute, in Lancaster city, on the 10th of 
 March, 1851. 

Hon. A. L. Hayes, Chairman of the Delegation 
 from the Society to the State Convention, read a re- 
 port relative to the State Agricultural Society. A 
 committee consisting of A. L. Hayes, John Miller and 
 Dr. Eli Parry, was appointed to take into considera- 
 tion the propriety of procuring an analysis of the 
 soils of Lancaster county. 

It was deemed inexpedient by the Society to hold 
 an exhibition the present year, and a resolution to 
 that effect was offered by IMr. Eshelman and adopted. 

Mr. Baughman, moved the appointment of a com- 
 mittee to ascertain what inducements held out by the 
 citizens of Lancaster, were requisite to procure the 
 holding of the Pennsylvania State Agricultural Ex- 
 hibition at Lancaster city, in October next. John 
 Baughman, J. B. Garber, and J. H. Horshey, com- 
 pose the committee, with powers to act in tlie premi- 
 ses as they may deem expedient. 

An informal discussionwas then had by the mem- 
 bers, on the subject of Guano, as a fertilizer, and the 
 mode of its application, during which some interest- 
 ing facts were elicited. 

Tlie following preamble and resolutions were of- 
 fered, and unanimously adopted : 

Whereas, It has been represented to this Society, 
 that our fellow citizen, A. M. Spangler, contemplates 
 issuing a Monthly Agricultural Jovirnal at Lancaster, 
 to be called the "Pennsylvania Farm Journal." 

And Whereas, It is the opinion of this Society that 
 a Journal of this character, issued from the Agricul- 
 tural County of Lancaster, would excite increased in- 
 quiry, and attract in a greater degree public atten- 
 tion to the cause of Agriculture in our own county 
 ajid elsewhere ; and as no exclusively Agricultural 
 paper or Journal is now published in Pennsylvania. 
 Therefore, 

liesalrcd, That this Society hereby urge upon Mr. 
 Spangler, the execution of his contemplated enter- 
 prise, as one in our opinion much needed in Pennsyl- 
 vania, and believing that it will advance the cause of 
 Agriculture here and throughout the entire State, 
 hereby cordially recommend the proposed " Farm 
 Journal" to the support of the members of this Soci- 
 ety, and citizens generally of the county. 

Some fine specimen of American and English pip- 
 pin apples were then presented by J. H. Ilershey, of 
 West Hempfield township, for which he received the 
 thanks of the Society.
