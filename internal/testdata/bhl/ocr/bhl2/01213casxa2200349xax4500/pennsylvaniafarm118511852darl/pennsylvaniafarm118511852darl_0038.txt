FARM JOURNAL. 

April, 

obviated, and every article ■will be found under its 
 appropriate head. 

In the various departments of Horticulture, Agri- 
 cultural Chemistry, Geology, Botany, &e., some of 
 our most distinguished men have kindly tendered 
 their services, so that all these important branches 
 Tvill be conducted with ability. 

In vievr of these facts, shall The Farm Journal be 
 sustained, or shall its fate be that of every other Ag- 
 ricultural Journal attempted to be established in 
 Pennsylvania ? For the honor of our noble Common- 
 wealth, and for the sake of Agriculture, we ask that 
 it may be supported and that oue and all will lend a 
 helping hand. 

To Contributors. 

Our contributors will confer a special favor by send- 
 ing in their communications as early in the month 
 as possible. This is absolutely necessary, to enable 
 us to place the different articles under their appro- 
 priate heads. 

Acknowledgements. 

Our Agricultural cotemporaries have our thanks 
 for the readiness with which they have complied with 
 our request to exchange, in advance of the publica- 
 tion of our first number. Nearly all of them have 
 furnished the whole of the back numbers of the pre- 
 sent volumes, which greatly increases our obligations. 

Our brethren of the Press generally, throughout 
 the State, will accept our thanks for the flattering 
 manner in which they have noticed our contemplated 
 enterprise. We will cheerfully reciprocate whenever 
 an occasion offers. 

We are indebted to C. M. Saxtox, Agricultural 
 Book Publisher, No. 123 Fulton street. Now York, for 
 a number of fine volumes, and other favors. The 
 books will be noticed in our next. 

The Beauty of the Title Pajs^c of the Coyer of the 
 Farm Journal. 

As some of our contributors may feel desirous of 
 knowing where they can have fine wood cuts execu- 
 ted on moderate terms, we take pleasure in referring 
 tliem to Messrs. Scatteroood & Howell, Inquirer 
 Buildings, South .3d street, Philadelphia. The beau- 
 tiful Engravings on the Cover of the Journal, as well 
 as the Heading of our first page, were both designed 
 and executed by these gentlemen. 

Proceedings of County Societies. 

The Corresponding Secretaries of the different 
 County Agricultural Societies in the State, will con- 
 fer a favor by furnishing us with any matters of in- 
 terest and importance, that may be transmitted from 
 time to time. We feel desirous of rendering the 
 •Journal a faithful transcript of what is doing amongst 
 the farmers in every section of the State. 

To Correspondents. 

S. G. of Columbia, will find his inquiries about the 
 Paine light answered. Tlie value of the opinion in 
 its favor, by another eye-witness, Mr. Elizur Wright, 
 an editor of Boston, must depend upon the value of 
 his opinions upon other subjects ; and it may possi- 
 bly be found that he is as familiar with galvanism as, 
 ■with any other subject of study. 

A variety of illustrations intended for this num- 
 ber ■were received too late for insertion, but they will 
 appear next month. Among them are some figures of 
 noxious insects, and a vie-w and details of a Villa Farm 
 house. 

DEUTScnER Kataloo der Garten-Samereiek, v. S. 
 w. — Piivid Landreth's garden seeds, with German 
 and English catalogues, are to be had at No. C5 Ches- 
 nut street, Philadelphia. 

Manuring. 

All applications of manure, which do not look to 
 the permanent improvement of the soil, but merely 
 to the growth of a single crop, are wasteful. It should 
 be the policy of all agriculturists, in applying manure, 
 to so concentrate their efforts, as that each field should 
 receive such a dressing, with the aid of lime, marl, 
 or ashes, when cjilcareous m.atter may be needed, as 
 would not only carry it through a course of rotation, 
 but leave the land at the end of such rotation in an 
 improving condition. This may involve a necessity 
 for decreasing the area of cultivation, but that should 
 not interrupt the system which we commend, as less 
 than one-half the land, if well manured, would in- 
 crease the quantity of product, at a great reduction 
 of labor, and improve the ability of proprietors to 
 carry on and extend their efforts at melioration, until 
 the whole of their arable lands were permanently im- 
 proved. All fields improved on this plan, must neces- 
 sarily, be got into clover, or grass, at the earliest pos- 
 sible period after the application of the manure, in 
 order that, at the end of the rotation, a body of vege- 
 table matter may be upon the soil, ready to be turned 
 in at the commencement of the succeeding line, to 
 supply the place of the abstracted portion of the nu- 
 trient principles afforded by the manure applied pre- 
 viouslj'. And it may be well here to impress these 
 fiicts upon our readers : — Lime, marl, or ashes, must 
 lie at the foundation of every improvement of the 
 soil looking to permanency ; — Every soil requires 
 mould to make it productive, as without the presence 
 of mould, or the materials for its formation, the ef- 
 fects of lime, marl, and ashes, must be circumscribed 
 as neither contains the principles of nutritive ma- 
 nure, which we maintain arc essential to the perfec- 
 tion of every plant grown by man : — The food of 
 plants must consist of organic, as well as inorgania 
 substances, or a liigh state of productiveness cannot 
 be expected. If we reflect, that wJuit is termed the 
 organic part of a plant, comprises about 97 parts of 
 the 100 which forms its whole, and that these parts 
 are not to be found in mineral bodies, but partly in 
 the atmosphere, and more in putrescent manures, the 
 necessity for keeping up a full supply of mould in 
 the soil, will appear obvious to all reflecting, ■well 
 'judging minds.
