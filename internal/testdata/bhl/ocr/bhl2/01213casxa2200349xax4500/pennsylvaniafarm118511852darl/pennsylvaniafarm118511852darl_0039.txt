Action and method of using Guano. 

In answer to the inquiries of our friend of " Notley 
 Hall," Va., in regard to the action of Guano ou "poor 
 vrorn-out land," we have to reply ; that, on such lands 
 its action should be most manifest — most beneficial 
 ■ — containing as it does, in a state to be availed of, 
 those substances which plants need, which such land 
 is mostly deficient in, and without a supply of which, 
 tlioy cannot grow in luxuriance and perfection. The 
 non-action of the guano upon all the kinds of veget- 
 ables, with the exception of one to which he applied 
 it, arose no doubt from the cause assigned by our 
 observant friend, viz: the drought of the summer. 
 Guano, like all other kindred manures, requires moi.s- 
 ture to bring out its virtues ; nor can the plants avail 
 themselves of any food which may be in the ground, 
 no matter how good and congenial it may be, until 
 that food, through the agency of water, be reduced to 
 a liquid, or gaseous form, as it is one or the other of 
 these forms which imparts to the rootlets of plants 
 the power of feeding. 

With regard to the mode of using guano, we give 
 it as our opinion, which wo advanced from the be- 
 ginning, and have never seen any cause to change it, 
 that Guano never should be applied without being 
 mixed with Plaster, to /ix and prevent the escape and 
 waste of its ammoniacal constituents. Before being 
 used, 25 lbs. of Plaster should be mixed with every 
 100 lbs. of Guano. "This mixture should be broad- 
 easted over the ground and ploughed, or spaded in. 
 We believe that any manure of the concentrated 
 nature of guano, abounding as it does in the elements 
 of ammonia in almost every state, can but rarely be 
 used safely, except as a broadcast dressing, and that 
 it cannot advantageously be used in the hill or drill, 
 except when mixed with a large proportion, say 
 twenty U) one, of mould or some other substance of 
 similar nature, and even then, that such compost 
 sliould be placed so deep as that the seed, setts, or 
 plants should not come in immediate contact with it. 

If we were going to apply it to potatoes in the hill, 
 if we did not use it composted with a large body of 
 mould as above, we would use it thus — after mixing 
 the guano with plaster, we would strew the mixture 
 on the bottom of the furrow or drill, and then cover 
 that with an inch or so of wood's-mould, or other 
 kindred substance, and upon this plant the potato 
 setts, and cover the whole over. 

In using it on watermelon hills, we would act thus ; 
 at the point for forming the hill, we would make a 
 hole with the hoe, there deposit the mixture of guano 
 and plaster, mix it in with the earth, and raise the 
 hill upon it from the surrounding mould, or we would 
 mix 200 lbs. of Guano with 50 lbs. of plaster, and 
 then compost it with 3 loads of wood's-mould, marsh 
 mud, or like substance, place a shovelfull at the bot- 
 tom of every hill we might raise. By either of these 
 modes the vines would drive all the benefit from the 
 virtues of the guano, without any injury. The vola- 
 tile portions would ascend and feed the rootlets of the 
 melon plants, while the roots would descend and feast 
 upon those of the constituent elements of guano tliat 
 are not volatile. 

A solution of guano might be made in the propor- 
 tion of 1 lb. of Guano, and 10 gallons of water, with 
 which the melon plants might be very advantageously 
 watered in times of drought Such a solution would 

Erove doubly useful, first, in protecting the vines 
 om the effects of drought, and secondly, by afford- 

ing to them direct food — food of a nature adapted to 
 their wants, as the water would decompose the am- 
 monia of the guano, deprive it of the power of harm, 
 and prepare it to be taken up as pabulum. 

We will add another remark, in order to answer a 
 question from another quarter. We believe the best 
 way to apply guano to tobacco, is to sow it broadcast 
 over the ground and plough it in — and that, if applied 
 to the hill, it should be mixed with one-fourth its 
 weight of plaster, and for every 100 lbs. composted 
 with it. In Peru, guano is applied to the crops at 
 each time of working ; but all such applications are 
 followed by immediate irrigation ; the water of which, 
 by decomposing the ammonia of the manure, pre- 
 vents all resulting injury, and ensures benefit to the 
 growing plants. 

Where a wheat crop is to follow the tobacco, we 
 would, by aU means broadcast and plough the guano 
 in. If treated to plaster and ploughed in, we have 
 no question but that the good effects of the guano 
 would be visible during the ordinary period of a rota- 
 tion. — American Fanner. 

Butter. — By the census returns of five counties 
 adjoining Philadelphia, it appears that they produced, 
 in 1850, 11,383,182 pounds of butter. The average 
 price of butter in the Philadelphia market, on which 
 these counties supply, is about 20 cents per pound. 
 The money value thejefore of this single product is 
 over two millions and a quarter of dollars, ($2,276,- 
 030.) A good dairy, well and economically manag- 
 ed, cannot but be profitable in the neighborhood of 
 the city, at the prices which butter, cheese and milk 
 always command in our markets. 

Prfming Stone Fruit Tbees. — It has been but a 
 few years since the cultivators of fruit have been ia 
 habit of pruning peach trees at the extremities of the 
 branches, instead of cutting off limbs at the trunk. 
 This system of shortening-in, as it is called, is gain- 
 ing ground, and it is a great improvement. The rea- 
 sons for this mode of pruning are evident on examin- 
 ation. Most kinds of stone fruit grow rapidly, and 
 bear the greater part of their ou new wood, which is, 
 of course, near the ends of the limbs. In this way a 
 tree spreads over much land, and naked branches 
 near the trunk ; and pruning at the trunk causes the 
 gum to ooze out, which sometimes endangers the 
 health of the tree. 

On the contrary, by pruning at the ends of the 
 branches, the tree is confined to a small space, the 
 wounds have no unfavorable effect, or only affect the 
 twigs, and not the trunk, and much now wood is pro- 
 duced for the production of fruit. 

To Bake a Ham. — Unless when too salt, from not 
 being suificietly soaked, a ham (particularly a young 
 and fresh one) eats much better baked than boiled, 
 and remains longer good. The safer plan is to lay 
 it into plenty of cold water over night. The follow- 
 ing day soak it for au hour or more in warm water, 
 wash it delicately clean, trim smoothly off all rusty 
 parts, and lay it with the rind downwards into a 
 coarse paste rolled to about an inch thick ; moisten 
 the edges, pinch them tiigether, and fold them over 
 ou the upper side of the ham, taking care to close 
 them so that no gravy can escape. Send it to a well- 
 heated, but not a fierce oven. A very small ham will 
 require quite three hours baking, and a large one five. 
 The crust and the skin must be removed while it is 
 hot. When part only of a ham is dressed, this mode 
 is better than boiling.
