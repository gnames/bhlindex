CuLTCRE OF Celery. — For early use it should bo 
 started in hot-beds ; but for later use, it may be sown 
 out in April. When the plants are of suitable size, 
 transplant into a rich deep soil. Set in trenches 2J 
 feet apart, and 15 inches deep. Put a few inches of 
 mellow manure into the bottom of the trench, and as 
 much good loam, and mix intimately together. Set 
 the plants six inches apart. If convenient take up a 
 ball of earth with each, and transplant in the even- 
 ing, or in damp weather. Stir the soil frequently, 
 and as the plants grow, earth up gradually, until the 
 trench is nearly filled, leaving only a small depress- 
 ion to catch the water.

Large Sales of a Large Work. — " Dr. Webster's 
 Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language, 
 published by Messrs. Merriam, of Springfield, is sell- 
 ing at a rate unprecedented, we believe, for so large 
 a work. Almost 3000 copies have been distributed 
 among the school Districts in Massachusetts, during 
 the past year, in conformity with an act of the Legis- 
 lature of the State. The demand from other sources 
 has also increased to the amount of several thousand 
 copies be3'ond that of the preceding year. Many 
 copies are now sent to distant parts of the world where 
 the people speak, or are learning the English Lan- 
 guage, for Missionary, Commercial and other pur- 
 poses. The Dictionary would bo an inestimable trea- 
 sure not only in every School District, but in the 
 family. Young children may be taught to resort to 
 Webster, as the arbiter of disputes, as a safe and satis- 
 factory guide, and as a storehouse of invaluable in- 
 formation. In this respect as well as others. Dr. 
 Webster and his Editor, Prof. Goodrich, are benefac- 
 tors to the country." — Biblioiheca Sacra, Jan. 1851. 

"A Dictionary is the last book which a scholar

At a meeting of the Teacher's Association, of Vei'mont, 
 held at Moiiipdier, Oct. 16, 1850, the following reso- 
 lution was adapted : — 

" Resolved, That in the opinion this Association, 
 the placing a copy of Webster's Quarto Dictionary in 
 each of our District Schools and higher literary Insti- 
 tutions, as a book of reference, both for teachers and 
 pupils, would be of incalculable benefit to the cause 
 of education by the influence it would exert in creat- 
 ing habits of investigation and accuracy as to the use 
 of language, as well as by placing before our youth 
 an amount of information which can be found in no 
 other uninspired volume. 

' ' A good Dictionary is an article of school apparatus 
 that ought to be regarded as indispensable. It is not 
 enough that the teacher should be skilled in English 
 lexicography ; the book should be at hand so that he 
 can refer to it for authorities, and illustrations of nice 
 shades of meaning. It should lie on the desk, so that 
 the scholars can themselves consult it." — Vt. Chron. 

A Dictionary is the last work which a scholar ever 
 wants to have abridged, the process being sure to cut 
 off the very matter which he most values. — Boston

" In revising and publishing an enlarged edition of 
 this invaluable work at so cheap a rate as to bring it 
 within the reach of almost every family, you have 
 rendered an essential service to mankind."
