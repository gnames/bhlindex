 PLOW. 

THIS Plow, in the language of the Roport of Committee on the 
 preat trial of Plows in June last, appoinled by the New Vork 
 State Agricultural Society, (by whom it was awai-Jed a spkcial 
 pcetmium); •' We regard tbi.-: implement as a most useful present 
 from the mechanic to the farmer, and in our opiniou will effect a 
 great improvement in the tillage of land. It pulverizes f/i^ soil in 
 an esceUent manner, which, to be fully appreciated, must be seen; 
 and it accomplishes this pulverization with an amount of power 
 which, in reference to the work performed, is certainly not large. 
 It buries the sod completely, and covers it with a coating of loose 
 earth which makes a seed bed almost &s perfectly as a spade."' 

At Boston, last season, this Plow was awarded a Gold Medal. 
 and at every County Fair in the State of New York, at which it 
 was exhibited, the Proprietor received a Premiiun.

IMPORTANT TO 
 Farmers & Threshing Machine Makers 

THE subscriber respectfully begs leave to inform the public 
 that he has lately perfected a new Threshing Machine and 
 Horse Fowkr, which in point of strength, durability, lightness of 
 draft and convenience in moving, is not surpassed or equalled by 
 any machine in the United States. He also confidently aflSrms 
 that no machine of its strength and durability can be afforded as 
 low. The invention of this machine has been the result of several 
 years experience and hard study. We do not claim to have dis- 
 covered any new principle in philosophy, but we d>"i claim to have 
 discovered a plan by which old philosophical principles are more 
 correctly and advantageou.sly applied than on any other machine. 
 The invention is secured by a caveat. 

These Machines can be had at Israel W. Groff's Machine 
 Shop, at retail or by wholesale, on the most reasonable terms. 

The Power weights 600 pounds. It is made entirely of Iron 
 with steel journals, aud is warranted to hold 8 horses, should it at 
 any time be necessary to use so many From 2 to 4 are a suffl- 
 eiont number for common threshing. We are about getting up 
 one much lighter for shop, purposes, that will be the cheapest and 
 inn.st convenient thing in use; it might also be used with two or 
 three horsesfor threshing. The Powers andcylinderand concave, 
 can be had by the Machine makers throughout the country, on 
 the most reasonable terms. 

All orders directed to the subscriber, at Lancaster city, will bo 
 thankfally rccoived and promptlT attended to.
