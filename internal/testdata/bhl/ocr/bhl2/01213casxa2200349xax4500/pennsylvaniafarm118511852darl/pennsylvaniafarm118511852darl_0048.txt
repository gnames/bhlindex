Accurate Experiments. 

The uiilify of accurate experiments, and the advantages 

of an early harvest of the wheat crop shown. 
 Mr. Editor: 

In the practice of Agriculture witli a view to its 
 improvement, tliere is no matter of greater moment, 
 than tlio right method of conducting experiments. — 
 Without entire accuracy and the utmost care in such 
 proceedings, tliore can neither be satisfaction in the 
 conclusion which one would attain, nor any certainty 
 in the evidence he would desire to afford of the re- 
 sults of his operations. In order that an experiment 
 may constitute a basis for safe practice or correct 
 reasoning, every circumstance and condition of time, 
 locality, space, quantity, quality, climate, and tem- 
 perature, should be duly observed and considered ; 
 nothing that can be weighed or measured should be 
 guessed at; and all the processes, as well as the re- 
 sult, should bo faithfully recorded. Unless this be 
 done, it is impossible that the experimenter himself, 
 much less others, should be able to repeat the expe- 
 riment, so as to determine whether the result bo true 
 or not. But the result is the essential fruit, and an 
 experiment is barren, when it cannot be verified by 
 repitic>n. It is obvious, therefore, that its chief value, 
 must depend upon the minute accuracy of its details 
 and the clearness and veracity of the report. The 
 reflection is often, indeed, forced upon us, that much 
 of the influence of useful knowledge is lost by vague 
 and imperfect description; which, obscuring the truth, 
 fails to excite attention or inspire confidence. Hence 
 important discoveries are allowed to sleep for years ; 
 and many improvements, after being laid aside, are 
 in a subsequent age, brought again, as if by accident, 
 into use, and regarded as inestimable. Hence inven- 
 tions employed and prized in one country, are often 
 either unknown or without just appreciation in a 
 neighboring State. 

In this connection may be mentioned the want of 
 suitable means and appliances among our farmers to 
 pursue their inquiries or record, their experience with 
 due correctness. There is not one farm in a hundred, 
 vchose fields have been surveyed, so as to defino their 
 precise arable contents. How few farmers keep a set 
 cf weights and measures, and the proper instruments 
 for making accurate investigations relative to their 
 farms or their produce! Still fewer use such means 
 as thoy have, and write down their observations for 
 the benefit of others. The difiiculty may have oc- 
 curred to many, as it has to myself, of obtaining a 
 satisfactory statement of the greatest quantity of 
 wheat grown, per acre, on any farm or field in any 
 one year. You m.ay not, indeed, fail to receive prompt 
 answers giving specific quantities ; but upon a close 
 examination, you find the quantities depend upon con- 
 jectural estimates ;— either the number of acres was 
 not ascertained, — the whole product was not mea- 

sured, — or the amount was derived from the sales, 
 with an estimated addition for what was used in the 
 family and retained for seed. 

On recurring to the discussions of many subjects, 
 (that of lime among the number,) which are spread 
 over the pages of our agricultural journals, we sec 
 how contradictory, rambling, unsatisfactory, and in- 
 conclusive they are, chiefly for want of correct pro- 
 cesses of investigation, proper experiments, and dili- 
 gent investigation. 

As a model of accuracy, and at the same time as 
 furnishing important information on a point of great 
 practical utility, the experiments of Mr. Ilannam, of 
 Yorkshire, England, made in 18-iO, to ascertain the 
 best time for cutting wheat, are worthy of the careful 
 attention and study of all farmers. I am persuaded 
 that the commencement of our wheat harvest is gen- 
 erally too late, and that there would be an improve- 
 ment in the quality as well as a prevention of waste, 
 by beginning a week earlier than usual to reap or 
 .cradle our wheat. The superior brightness and 
 strength of our summer sun, ripen the grain more 
 rapidly than it is matured under the cooler and more 
 cloudy sky of England, and proportionally diminish 
 the intervals noticed in Mr. Hannam's experiments. 
 Mr. James Porter, who was an excellent farmer of 
 Lancaster County, mentioned an instance in his own 
 experience, which fortifies the opinion just advanced, 
 in favor of an early harvest. He was induced in or- 
 der to accommodate a purchaser, who wanted the 
 immediate use of the field, to cut his wheat whilst it 
 still was apparently so green, that ho had much mis- 
 giving as to the result, and his neighbors freely ex- 
 pressed their belief that he would lose the crop. — 
 Not only, however, was the yield good, but the qual- 
 ity of the flour manufactured out of this wheat, was 
 unsurpassed by any that he had ever produced. — 
 Other instances of the same sort are doubtless within 
 the recollection of many; — and in relation to the 
 waste, every one must remember occasionally to have 
 observed, immediately after harvest, enough of the 
 grain shelled out and lying among the stuTiblo, to 
 furnish seed for another crop: — but, to the experi- 
 ments. 

Mr. Ilannam selected for them a field of red icheat; 
 and on the 4th of August, 1840, he cut a sheaf. "At 
 this time it was quite green, i. c. both straw and ears 
 were in full vigor and full of sap. Though the grain 
 appeared perfectly formed the chaff still adhered so 
 firmly to it, that it was scarcely possible to separate 
 them by friction in the hands. When separated it 
 was large and pliunp, but so full of milk that the 
 slightest pressure reduced the whole of it to a juicy 
 consistency or pulp." • 

This sheaf stood in the field for a fortnight, whon 
 it was housed. On the same d.ay, the eighteenth of 
 August, he cut another. The wheat was yet green, 
 being what farmers in England commonly term rair; 
 "that is, the straw, though appearing at a distance
