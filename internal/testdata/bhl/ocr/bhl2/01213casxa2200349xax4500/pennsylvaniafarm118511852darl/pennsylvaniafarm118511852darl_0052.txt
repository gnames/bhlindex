bus'.iels to the aero is not a largo quantity. I would 
 not exceed that quantity upon any land, )jut for the 
 first di-ossing would graduate it from twenty to one 
 hundred, according to the nature of the soil. 

Now as to the mode of its application. Generally, 
 it is put upon a ploughed field in heaps, and spread, 
 and afterwards ploughed under. I regard this as a 
 most pernicious mode of liming. In the first place, 
 the spots where the heaps are, receive too large a 
 quantity, and in the nest place by ploughing it under, 
 the lime gets too deep to act successfully upon the 
 Tcgotable matter in the soil— consequently its benefi- 
 cial effect is lost. Lime is heavy, and its tondonoy is 
 to sink. The great object is to keep it as near the 
 surface as possible. For several years I have adopted 
 the method of spreading it upon the sod, and this 
 furnishes the most successful mode of renovating an 
 old meadow. It is spread from the wagon, and it 
 requires but little experience to graduate the quan- 
 tity according to your wish. In a short time the 
 lime sinks into the spungy sod, and decomposes all 
 dead vegetable matters, which at the same time nour- 
 ishes the roots of the grass and causes the blades to 
 spring up with extraordinary vigor. I have had old 
 meadows double their usual quantity of hay the first 
 year after this process. 

Then again, when you desire to plough the same 
 meadow, the lime having sunk into the sod is still 
 upon the surface, and ready to act as a decomposer of 
 the sod, and manure in case the land should require 
 it. If the ground should be left in meadow, it will 
 found that successive crops of grass will be greatly 
 increased. 

I might extend this communication to a much 
 greater length, but as you will often hear from me, I 

am desirous of consulting brevity.

Kural Taste. 

Mr. Editor : I have just received and read with 
 great satisfaction, the first number of the Pennsylva- 
 nia Farm Journal. 

Pennsylvania Farmers are -wisely careful in ven- 
 turing the support of new enterprises ; but no one ac- 
 (piaintcd with the qualifications of Professor Ilalde- 
 man, or with tlie character of his accomplished 
 correspondents, can ask a more rclialde guarantee for 
 the character and worth of the paper, or hesitate for 
 a moment to give himself the benefit of its society, 
 whatever personal preferences ho may intcrtain for 
 other papers or editors. 

The most intelligent agricuturist can never say 

"I have learned all." Old farmers know this; only 

the merest beginners, or those who, like the poet's 

ploughman, " go whistling along for want of 

thought," suppose that they know everything. One 

must learn much before learning what is to be 

learned. 
 As to the farmer, no occupation or profession what- 

ever, emljraces so wide and deep a range of knowledge 
 as his. Indeed it seems impossible for any one man 
 ever to become accomplished in the whole range of 
 agi'icultural suljjects ; fon men who have given undi- 
 vided attention to a single branch — as, for example, 
 the rearing of cattle, the arrangement of crops, tho 
 art of improving lands, whose heads are grey and 
 some skill eminent, all freely own that they find 
 theirthing to learn continually. 

But as the farmer must know something of every 
 branch of his business, his knowledge of each ia 
 necessarily supeifieial, and as he cannot see or con- 
 sult with Doctors of agricidture face to face, how can 
 he do better than to communicate with them through 
 the medium of a paper, wliich is the common chan- 
 nel of the whole agricultural intelligence of the com- 
 munity, and which, if it contains some that may not 
 bo applicalde to his peculiar situation, yet affords 
 seasonable hints, and timely lessons of instruction. 

It was a fine saying that " God made the country, 
 and man made the town." But in making the coun- 
 try the Almighty has left it to the exercise of man's 
 ingenuity to use the exurberance of materials every- 
 where _ready to his hand. Man must clothe and 
 shelter himself, and he can do this either neatly and 
 comfortably, or wretchedly and as a sloven. 

In nothing are country dwellings more generally 
 deficient than in the arrangement of the gardens 
 and fruit yards immediately around them. In a new 
 country, a whole generation is fully engaged in clear- 
 ing the wilds, and growing bread ; and the art of 
 producing a supply of various and delicious fruits, 
 and of making home to smile in Nature's best adorn- 
 ments, becomes almost lost and forgotten. But a 
 taste for such serene enjoyments is natural to every 
 desoendent of gardner Adam, and no information 
 that your columns can render, I venture to say, wiU 
 be more gladly received through the villages and 
 country homes of Pennsylvania than some first les- 
 sons in Horticulture. 

The magnificent Ijarns of the Pennsylvania farmers 
 are objects of general admiration, and it is by no 
 means for want of will that the owners of these 
 structures do not render their own dwellings as cosy 
 and as snugly sheltered as comfort and fuU enjoy- 
 ment seem to require. AVe see, quite too often, the 
 rickety skeletons of dead shrubbery and shade trees, 
 (and very often, too, tho living skeletons) to procure 
 and plant which a sufficient amount of trouble was 
 incurred, all resulting in dead and discouraging fail- 
 ure tlirough want of a little knowledge of the art 
 (simple when understood) of selecting, planting, train- 
 ing, ami arranging tho leafy decorations of the earth. 
 A general diffusion of correct information on this 
 suliject of screening, shading, carpeting, and garland- 
 ing' the farmers fruitful and happy homo, would I 
 doulit not, enliven thousands of our rural homesteads; 
 and add immensely to the enjoyment of their occu- 
 pants. W. G. Waring.
