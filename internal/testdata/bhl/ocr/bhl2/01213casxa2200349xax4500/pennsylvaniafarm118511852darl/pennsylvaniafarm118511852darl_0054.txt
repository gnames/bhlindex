Agricultural Chemist of Maryland and his Report. 

Mr. Editor : There is a slight error in your first 
 number, -wherein you say, that the State of Virginia 
 lias recently taken a step far in advance of her neigh- 
 bors, by providing for an Agricultural Chemist.* 
 Maryland, by an Act of her General Assembly at 
 tlie Session of 1847, '48, created the office of Agri- 
 cultural Chemist, with a salary of ?1500 per annum, 
 . and an allowance of ?200 for the first year, and not 
 exceeding §50 for each succeeding one, for the pur- 
 chase of chemical instruments and materials. " Honor 
 to whom honor is due." Virginia deserves commen- 
 dation for her liberal and wise policy in this respect ; 
 but our noble sister, still nearer to us, has taken the 
 lead. Under the Act above mentioned, Dr. James 
 Higgins, was appointed Agricultural Chemist for 
 Maryland, and as soon as ho could procure the ne- 
 cessary apparatus, tests, and re-agents, entered upon 
 his duties. He was required to make an annual re- 
 port to the House of Delegates, of his proceedings ; 
 and ho accordingly at the ensuing Session, submitted 
 his first report, 10,000, copies of which have been 
 printed by order of the General Assembly. It occu- 
 pies 92 pages octavo, and is replete with tie most 
 valuable and interesting matter. 

The State of Maryland, is. divided into throe 
 " Gubernatorial Districts ;" and the State Chemist is 
 required to spend one year in each of these, analyz- 
 iu"- the soils, marls, and other vegetable and mineral 
 deposits, and delivering public lectures in the several 
 counties. His report is chiefly devoted to the first 
 of those duties, and details the results of his nume- 
 rous examinations of the soils of a portion of the 
 Eastern Shore of Maryland — the part of the State 
 which lies East of the Chesapeake Bay, and of the 
 remarkable deposits which are diffused through that 
 district, and destined to renovate and enrich it be- 
 yond calculation. 

As practical utility was the prescribed aim of his 
 instructions, it is interesting to observe the manner 
 in which he viewed this business of Analysis, and 
 what he deemed to be its appropriate objects and 
 uses. He considers his duty to be, to analyze the 
 varieties of soil in order to determine the presence or 
 absence of the necessary constituents of crops — 
 whether those existed in sufficient quafitities — and 
 what particular substances would most economically 
 supply deficienccs, so as to render barren soils fertile, 
 and retain the fertility of those which are already 
 productive. The necessary constituents of crops are 

. * The passage in question should have read, " a 
 step far in advance of some of its neighbors." — 
 The State geologist of Alabama includes agricultu- 
 ral chemistry in his course of instruction at the uni- 
 versity. The importance of the subject was insisted 
 upon at tlie organization of our own geological sur- 
 Tey, to which a chemist was attached ; and when 
 connected with the survey we collected specimens of 
 soils for analysis. — Ed. 

the substances, which are always present in plants, 
 in all climes and under all circumstances, and which 
 those that administer to the sustenance of the hu- 
 man body, must contain, to furnish the proper ele- 
 ments of its nutriment and growth. Having attained 
 a knowledge of what plants require, we thereby ar- 
 rive at the necessary constituents of soils. For the 
 food of plants, is derived from the soil and the air 
 which surround them. A certain portion of the ele- 
 ments of plants, from their natui-e, cannot exist in 
 the atmosphere, and, if not present in the soil, vege- 
 tation cannot be produced. As it can be perfectly 
 ascertained, what substances are necessary for plants 
 that are used for food, from our knowledge of the 
 matter in the human body, which is supplied with 
 that food, so we can perfectly ascertain what are the 
 necessary constituents of soils from a knowledge of 
 the material which these plants require for their com- 
 plete devclopement. The best proportions necessary 
 to constitute a fertile soil, can only be determined by 
 chemical analysis of a large number of fertile soils. 
 With each examination, one certain step is gained in 
 the solution of this great question. When examina- 
 tions become more numerous, the minimum quantity 
 that will produce the largest yield, will be discovered ; 
 and then tlie perfection of Agriculture will he attained. 
 All necessary substances, to constitute a fertile soil, 
 must be present, for the excess of any one cannot 
 compensate for the absence or deficiency of another. 
 Those substances are lime, humus, magnesia, potash, 
 soda, phosphoric acid, animal and vegetable, or or- 
 ganic matter, chlorine, sulphuric acid, alumina or 
 pure clay, silica or sand, iron, as per-oxide. But 
 soils very productive, particularly for wheat, may 
 contain small proportions of any one of the necessary 
 constituents, the rest being present in proper propor- 
 tions. 

To retain the fertility of a soil already productive, 
 it is necessary to add to it a quantity of fertilizing 
 matter, equal to that which is taken off liy the crop, 
 allowance being made for what may be lost by per- 
 colation through the soil. By doing this, we can al- 
 ways maintain soils at whatever point of production 
 they may have, and even increase their productive- 
 ness. A soil which, from its texture, is particularly 
 good for wheat, may thus be kept in a condition to 
 produce a crop every year, without any rotalian. — 
 The same is true, with regard to corn or any other 
 crop. 

The following remarks on the suliject of lime, ex- 
 plain its action as a fertilizer. Lime exists in the 
 soil most generally as a silicate, that is, chemically 
 united to silicic acid or sand. In the human body, 
 in union with phosphoric acid, it forms a very large 
 part of the bones. It exists in combination with dif- 
 ferent acids in the root, stalk, blade and grain of all 
 plants. 

" Besides the necessity of its presence to form the 
 structure of plants, it performs many otlier impor-
