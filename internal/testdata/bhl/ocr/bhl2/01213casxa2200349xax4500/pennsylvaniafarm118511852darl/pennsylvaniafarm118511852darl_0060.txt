SHEEP— DOMESTIC ECONOMY.

the tapering face, small muzzle, anrl full eye! The 
 arched nose always possessed by the black faced ram, is 
 Baid to denote boldness and courage. The legs, like the 
 face, are coTcred with mottled or black hair ; the horns 
 are highly picturesque, and will bring to the remem- 
 brance of many of his old guests, one that was kept filled 
 Tvith snutf of the most exquisite perfume, always lying 
 on the counter of the bar of the City Hotel, Baltimore, 
 in the life-time of " King David," who boldly led the 
 way in teaciiing the proper structure and philosophy of 
 hotel keeping. 

The wool of the black-faced sheep is long and coarse, 
 which renders it of little value in manufacturing. The 
 carcass, however, is well formed, carrying its depth 
 forward to the brisket, better than the Cheviot ; yet the 
 entire body being narrow, owing to the flatness of the 
 ribs, gives too much lightness, or want of what is called 
 substance, to the whole carcass. 

The flesh is said to be fine-grained, high-flavored, and 
 highly esteemed. This breed too, is very hardy, fro- 
 quetsting the highest parts of the heath-clad mountains 
 of Scotland, and requires little care from the shepherd.

 and most accomplished " gentleman of the old school,"

The reader may observe that in these cases one is 
 called a tup, and the other a ram. These names are 
 synonymous ; but there are technical names employed 
 in all English agricultural writings, according to the 
 age and sex of sheep, with which every liberal-minded 
 reader who is not, would like, once for all, to be made 
 acquainted. At some more convenient moment that 
 shall be done. At present we have not an atom of time 
 or space to spare. Yet in all times and circumstances, 
 ■we have no ambition, in constancy and force, like that 
 which would lead us to add even one item of useful in- 
 formation to the stock of those who are to look for their 
 bread to the cultivation of the soil. — Flough, Loom

Currants — Raspberries. — Set these liushes in good 
 Boil, and manure them liborp.lly with a good compost 
 of forest leaves, rotten wood, ashes, salt, lime, hone 
 dust and muck. 'No fermentable manure should bo 
 applied. Let the soil be kept open and frco from 
 weeds, and the surfiioo covered with straw, and fruit 
 will be produced in almost any quantity desired. —

CnARCOAL IN Cisterns. — A writer in the Horticul- 
 turist says, that six quarts of charcoal, nicely pulver- 
 ised, and put into a cistern of the capacity of fifteen 
 hogsheads, will make the water perfectly sweet at any 
 time. Well worth its trial.

DAIRY 5IANAGEMENT. 

We could never admit any excuse as sufficient to jus- 
 tify any man who keeps even one cow in not having an 
 abundance o? milk at least, if not of butter, for a family 
 of moderate size. Every Farmer should provide, if only 
 for a few of his best cows, a good u-nrni shelter, abun- 
 diiuce of litter for a clean dry bed, and of suitable food. 
 The cow that won't pay, with such shelter and keep, for 
 a quart of corn-meal a day, and a few turnips, or cab- 
 bages, or carrots, or beets, made into a good warm mess, 
 to be given twice a day, with an abundance of cut 
 straw — such a cow is not worth keeping; and he who 
 has such an one, or two or three or more, and will not 
 so provide for them, is not worthy to be called a Farmer, 
 and deserves to have his table served without milk or 
 butter, and, what is still worse, with a dirty table cloth 
 and a dull carver. 

As I believe the management of milch cows to be su- 
 perior here to that in any part of England, it may be 
 interesting to tell you how I manage mine, and the 
 quantify of produce I obtain weekly. I liave a boiler 
 containing about 40 gallons, and into it I put about .50 
 lbs. of turnips, a considerable quantity of water, and 
 about 12 lbs of straw cut into chaff, and this is boiled 
 for about two hours, when it becomes a dark nasty 
 looking mess ; one half of this is taken out into two 
 tubs, and whilst warm 1^ lbs. of bean or pea-meal is 
 stirred into each, and then given to each cow at about 
 110 deg, of heat. That which is left in the boiler re- 
 mains till morning, and if well covered up is still warm 
 enough for use; it is then mixed with the pea or bean- 
 meal, as before, and given to the cows at break of day. 
 This, with hay quantum s7/^., constitutes their daily 
 diet; and I get about BJlbs. of butter from each cow. — 
 I omitted to say I have only two cows. The butter pro- 
 duced in this way has no taste of turnips, and the avidi-» 
 ty with which the cows eat this boiled mess is a good 
 criterion of its value. "When given to the cows, it should 
 be thin and sloppy. — Mark Lane Express. 

Horse Shoeing. — The following remarks are from 
 the jien of Mr. Miles, Veterinary Surgeon to the 
 Queen of England's Life Guards and author of serer- 
 al valuable veterinary works. 

The shoos of the horse should be of equal thickness 
 throughout, with a flat ground surface, as those with 
 high heels, which asinine smiths make in imitation 
 of their own, are dangerously absurd. The toe which 
 ought to bo raised is thus lowered, and nature's plan 
 reversed, which elevates the point in order to avoid 
 obstructions. The web should be wide, and of the 
 same width throughout, instead of being pinched in, 
 because the Vulcan operator likes to sec the shoo well 
 sot ofi" at the heels. This is both unphilosophioal 
 and detrimental ; it deceives the oyo of man, and in- 
 jures the foot of the horse. Tho outer edge of the 
 foot rests on the inner edge of tho shoe, and the re- 
 maining width of tho web projects beyond tho hoof; 
 so that tho master who thinks his horse has a good 
 open foot, only has to be proud of a bad open shoe, 
 wliieh both conceals deformities underneath, and in- 
 vites with open arms a bad road to come and do its 
 worst. The heels are made bare just where the 
 navicular joint is mo.st exposed; and if that be in- 
 flamed, what must the agony be when the unprotect- 
 ed foot treads on a sharp flint? The horse foils sud- 
 denly lame, or drops as if ho had been sliot — phrases 
 in much too common use to require explanation; and 
 small is the pity which the suffering animal meets 
 with from man, who, having iirst destroyed the use 
 of his victim's feet, abuses him because ho cannot go, 
 and imputes "grogginess" to him as a crime, as if he 
 wore in liquor Uko a groom, and not in agony.
