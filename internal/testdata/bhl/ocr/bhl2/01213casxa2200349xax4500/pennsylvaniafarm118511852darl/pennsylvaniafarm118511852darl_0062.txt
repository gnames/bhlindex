State, \7e -ivill only mention, at this time, Uullng's 
 Superb, a cling of fine flavor and large size, — the 
 Gen. Hand, one of the largest of all pluma, — and the 
 Cloavinger, a Ijluo, free, oval plum, of fair flavor, and 
 some six inches in circumference. A single Penn- 
 sylvania peach, only, will lie named, the Susquehan- 
 na, a native of Ilarrisburg; it is a free, yellow, Sep- 
 tember fruit of good flavor, and sometimes measuring 
 a foot in circumference. Specimens of this noble 
 peach, preserved in spirits, are in the possession of 
 Mr. Cloavinger, Superintendent of the Public School, 
 at the N. E. corner of 12th and Locust sts., where 
 they may bo seen. Pennsylvania has also produced 
 a number of apples, some of vfhioh are of much ex- 
 cellence. In the list are included the Brenneman, 
 Crawford, Fallenwalder, Jefferies,Klaproth,Laequier, 
 Miller, Republican Pippin, Smokehouse, Summer 
 Sweot Paradise, Townsend, Winter Sweet Paradise, 
 &c. 

From investigations recently made in the vicinity 
 of Pliiladelphia by the Fruit Committee of our Horti- 
 cultural Society, it is believed there are many valua- 
 ble fruits in this State, entirely unknown beyond their 
 original locality. These, it is to be hoped, the Farm 
 JooRi^fAL will be the means of bringing into notice. 
 To aid in accomplishing the same object, the Penn- 
 sylvania Horticultural Society would also be happy, 
 at all times, to receive, by the most expeditious con- 
 veyance, scions and specimens of any valuable native 
 fruits from the different sections of the State. 

Scions of sis new Pennsylvania apples and two 
 new pears hrve just been sent from Berks county, 
 through Jlr. Robert Kilaington, of this city. The 
 fruit I have not yet seen; specimens, however, will 
 probably bo forwarded during the present season.

Mr. Si'angler: — We hail with ecstacios and de- 
 light the very handsome aspect of the Penn'a Farm 
 Journal. There is not a State in the Union so cele- 
 brated for the intellectual capacity of its Farmers, as 
 tlie Keystone '.State, and we doubt not that your 
 field of contributors will yield to your readers a 
 golden harvest. As there may be some of your read- 
 ers that would relish a well supplied table of articles 
 differing from beef, broad, potatoes and shangb.aes, 
 we venture to throw out a few hints for the improve- 
 ment of the Garden. The name itself associates with 
 it pleasing anticipation, and from its culture properly 
 attended you will realize a tenfold return. 

Those who have been actively engaged in the gar- 
 den have now all their early crops above ground, and 
 BTO preparing ground for Lima beans, that should 
 be planted in rich, light, mellow soil in hills 4 feet 
 apart. Plant the bean on its edge, with the eye 
 towards the ground; cover lightly, choose dry warm 
 weather for the planting, give them poles from 8 to 

10 feet high. For market purposes they are a very 
 profitable crop. 

Plant Snop short, or bush beans early in May, and 
 every two weeks thereafter, till the middle of July. 
 Sow a fuU crop of beets for the table and a full crop 
 of mangold wurtzcl for the winter stock. The best 
 garden beets for winter use, are the long blood and 
 the raddish beet. The latter has obtained the first 
 premium at the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society 
 the past three years in succession. Plant in drills 
 18 inches apart and the seeds dropped every 4 to 6 
 inches in the row. When they are up, thin them out 
 to 6 inches apart — mangold wurtzel to 9 inches 
 apart. 

Sow a full crop of carrots. We prefer keeping tho 
 seed in moist sand two days before sowing; it thereby 
 vegetates at once for family use. The Horn carrot 
 is the richest. For field culture the Long orange for 
 light soil, and the Altringham for heavy soils are to 
 be preferred. 

Parsnips are an indispensable vegetable, being in 
 perfection during the early spring months, when 
 other vegetables are scarce. They produce a very 
 heavy crop and are readily eaten by cows and pigs. 
 Our stock of that description, now have them daily, 
 and some to spare to our neighbors. Every gardener 
 should sow half an ounce at least, of Salsify or vege- 
 table oyster. Sow in shallow drills 9 inches apart, 
 and thin out the plants to 3 inches in tho row. 

JEarly corn is a very important auxilliary to tha 
 Table. Plant at once, Adams extra early for a first 
 crop, and the early sugar, eight rowed for the second 
 and succeeding crops. Sow Bi-ocoli of tb.e early pur- 
 ple and early white sorts. Transplant them about 
 the end of June or first week of July for heading. 
 Cut in the fall and early in tho winter. 

Melons are a very agreeable luxury. Sow a patch 
 of the netted citron; and of the water melon, sow 
 the mountain sprout, a very superior variety. Pro- 
 pare rich ground for egg plant and tomatoes which 
 may be planted safely about the middle of May. — 
 Many fail in growing their egg plant seed and tha 
 failure is attributed to bad seed. That may occasion- 
 ally be so, but not always. The greatest error is in 
 sowing deep. I have seen two men sow seed out of 
 the same bag, on the same day, and in the same hot- 
 bod. The one vegetated finely, and the other did not 
 produce one plant for twenty seeds sown. Nature does 
 not dig a hole and deposit her seeds, they arc all sur- 
 face sown — merely covered and pressed down with 
 rain or the snow of winter. The great secret of suc- 
 cessful planting consists in plunging the roots into a 
 puddle of clay or mud made to the consistency of 
 thin mush, and in this state plant them. With such 
 treatment if the plant is alive and has root it will be 
 sure to grow. 

Flowers. — There is no embellishment that so much 
 adorns a residence as these emblems of purity and 
 innocence. The columns of the portico and piazza
