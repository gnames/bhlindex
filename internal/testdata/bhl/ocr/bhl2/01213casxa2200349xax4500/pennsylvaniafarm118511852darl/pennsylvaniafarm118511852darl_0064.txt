Proceedings of the Pennsylvania Horticultural So- 
 ciety. 

The stated monthly meeting of this Society oc- 
 curred on Tuesday evening, April 15th, 1851, and\Yas 
 held in the Chinese Soloon, Philadelphia. 

The President in the chair. These periodical oc- 
 casions arc of such a character, that individuals of all 
 dispositions, — the aged or youthful, the sedate or gay, 
 the more plain and fashionable can meet and admire 
 the beauties of nature in her most attractive attire; 
 and generally speaking, the Hall is crowded Tvith tlie 
 elite of the city; but owing to the unfavorable state of 
 the weather, at this time it was less so. Yet those in 
 attendance expressed themselves highly pleased with 
 the beauty of the exhibition, indeed it would be sur- 
 prising if they failed to be so, when the choicest flow- 
 ering plants of six green houses and the culinary 
 productions of many hot beds, contributed to their 
 gvatiflcation. 

A few only of the most interesting plants from each 
 collection will be noticed. Among those from the 
 collection of Frederick Linnig were the Gardenia 
 StanUijana of recent introduction — a plant of pros- 
 trate habit and symmetrical form, throwing up slender 
 flowers from iive to six inches long, of a dark red 
 color, expanding into a trumpet shaped limb of a 
 light pink hue, delicately striped with dark red. — ■ 
 Iranciscea hi/dranr/ecp formis a species bearing ftue 
 clusters of blue flowers in the axils of the branches ; 
 and Columnca Scheidiand, presenting many stems, 
 with numerous speckled fuscous personate flowers, 
 arranged singly at the axils of the leaves. Of those 
 from the green house of Peter Mackenzie — were 
 Silenc rosea gracea and Crepis Drummondn, new and 
 shown for the first time, plants of a delicate habit and 
 interesting; beautiful Pansies and a fine display of 
 Camelias. Of the latter — a flower of his seedling of 
 this year, called "Jenny Lind," a gem of pure white 
 distinctly striped with rich pink, petals round and 
 entire full to the centre, was deservedly admired. Of 
 those from Robt. Buist's green house were — a fine 
 specimen of a new and undescribed plant in full 
 bloom, from California, allied to Arbutus Pimelia

 nobilis bearing large blue bell flowers along its
