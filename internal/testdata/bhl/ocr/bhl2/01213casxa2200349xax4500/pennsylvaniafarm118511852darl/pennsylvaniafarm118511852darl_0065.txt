THE DORKING FOWL. 

For those who wish to stock their poultry yards 
 with fowls of most desirable shape and size, clothed 
 in rich and variegated plumage, and, not expecting 
 perfection, are willing to overlook one or two other 
 points, the Dorkings are the breed, above all others 
 to be selected. They are larger-bodied, and of better 
 proportions, according to their size, than any other 
 variety I have yet seen, their bodies being rather 
 long, plump, and well-fleshed ; and the breeder, as 
 well as the housewife, generally beholds with delight 
 their short legs, full, broad lireasts, little waste in 
 offal, and the large quantity of good profitable flesh, 
 the flavor and appearance of which is inferior to 
 none. 

The cocks are magnificent. The most gorgeous 
 hues are frequently lavished upon them, which their 
 large size and peculiarly square-built form display to 
 great advantage. The original Dorkings are said to 
 have been white, but such are now seldom to be seen. 
 During all my rambles, in various parts of the coun- 
 try, only on one or two occasions did I meet with 
 Eure-white birds. In all, however, as far as my 
 nowledge extended, when pure-blooded, more or less 
 white prevailed; but the cloudings, and markings of 
 the plumage were unlimited. Many were marked 
 ■with bands, or bars, of ashy-grey, running into each 
 other at their paler margins. Some had the hackles 
 of the neck white, with a tinge of yellow, and the 
 body of a darker or brownish-red, intermixed irregu- 
 larly with white; while others were be.autifully vari- 
 egated with white, black, green, and brown, or were 
 nearly uniform in their shades from a light-cream 
 color to almost black. 

Both the cocks and hens are usually short-legged' 
 thickly-feathered, having fine, delicate heads, with 
 single, double, or large, flat rose4ike combs, which, 
 when they are in high health, add very much 
 to their appearance, particularly if seen in the bright 
 rays of the sun. Their legs are invariably white, or 
 flesh-colored, each often armed with one or more toe- 
 like claws ; and, instead of four toes to each foot, a 
 fifth one protrudes from the same root as the heel toe 
 in the common varieties, which is generally regarded 
 as a distinguishing mark of the breed. 

The weight of the Dorkings, at maturity, variea 
 from five to eight pounds, and full-grown capons have 
 been known to weigh ten or twelve. Their eggs are 
 usually of a clear white, but sometimes of an ashy- 
 grey color, rather large in size, very much rounded 
 at both ends, and of an excellent flavor. The hens 
 are not '-everlasting layers," although they produce 
 eggs in reasonable abundance, but at due or conve- 
 nient intervals they manifest a desire to sit, in which 
 they often most strenuously persevere. In this re- 
 spect, they are steady and good mothers when the 
 little ones appear. They are better adapted than any 
 other fowl, except the great Malay, to hatch supera- 
 bundant turkey's eggs. Their size and bulk enable 
 them to afi'ord warmth and shelter to the turkey 
 poults for a long time. For the same reason, spare 
 goose eggs may safely be entrusted to their motherly 
 care. Their young, in this country, have thus far 
 proved very hardy and easy to rear. The chicks 
 are generally brownish. yellow, with a broad, brown 
 stripe down the middle" of the back, and a narrow 
 one on each side.
