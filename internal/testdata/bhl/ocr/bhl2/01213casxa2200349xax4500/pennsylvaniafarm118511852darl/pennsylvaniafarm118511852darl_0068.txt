struck with amazement, when he first saw the variety, 
 abundance and beauty of the apples, which were 
 brought to our market. In addition to these matters, 
 specimens of our native timber, planed to show the 
 grain, indigenous plants and herbs, remarkable for 
 medicinal qualities, or their elegance — the products 
 of household industry and magnificence, may be cu- 
 rious and interesting objects at the exhibition. 

But we would extend this appeal to other counties. 
 Our State Society, in this material and important 
 measure, must be sustained — not awkwardly, but 
 zealously and with correspondent spirit. The whole 
 agricultural interest of the State, is deeply involved 
 in it. The first State Agricultural Exhibition in 
 Pennsylvania, will constitute an epoch. Neighboring 
 States will send their delegates, in no small numl)er, 
 to visit our Agricultural Fair. Think how mortify- 
 ing to every Pennsylvanian, would be their disap- 
 pointment on finding a deficient and meagre exhi- 
 bition ! Again ; consider what a chilling effect, it 
 would have upon the ardour of the friends of agri- 
 culture throughout the State. Fi-om the assembling 
 of the State Convention to the present time, the cause 
 has advanced with a full and flowing sail. If the 
 step just taken by the executive committee be met as 
 it should, throughout the Commonwealth, then the 
 cause is safe ; but if every thing be left to the efforts 
 of one, two, or three counties, and the exhibition turn 
 out a failure, who would answer for the result ? It 
 pains us to think of the possibility. The friends of 
 the cause, must be up and doing. Wo are assured, 
 that nothing will be omitted at Ilarrisburg, to make 
 the arrangements for the exhibition complete, by the 
 selection of the most suitable grounds, the construc- 
 tion of the proper enclosures and shelters, and the 
 adoption of useful regulations for the convenience 
 and comfort of all who may attend as visitors or con- 
 tributors. It remains for the farmers and those who 
 feel an interest in the improvement of agriculture, in 
 every part of our State, to begin and continue their 
 preparations for this grand exhibition. AVith an ear- 
 nest effort on their part, we feel safe iu predicting 
 that the fair will redound to the credit of our good 
 Commonwealth, and give a wonderful impetus to the 
 cause of Agriculture within her borders. 

Enclosing Receipts. 
 We designed enclosing a receipt in each number 
 of the Journal sent to subscribers, but have since 
 been informed that this cannot be done without sub- 
 jecting the person receiving it to heavy postage. In 
 order to obviate the difficulty in part, we shall always 
 forward receipts to the persons sending club lists, &o. 

The April Number. 

In anticipation of an extensive circulation, a very 
 largo edition of our first number was printed. New 
 subscribers may therefore confidently rely upon being 
 supplied with it. 

Farmers! Write for the Journal. 

We herewith extend a cordial and hearty invitation 
 to practical farmers to favor xis with communica- 
 tions upon all subjects pertaining to Agriculture, 
 Horticulture, &a. One fact is worth a dozen theo- 
 ries ; and if the Farm Journal is destined to prosper, 
 it can only do so through the assistance of those who 
 are able to communicate the results of their own ob- 
 servation and experience. The fact that an important 
 truth is presented in plain language, does not in the 
 slightest degree detract from its value, and no reader of 
 sense will reject it because of the simplicity of style with 
 which it is written. So far from being an objection, 
 an easy, familiar style is most to be desired, and for 
 this reason it has been a special object with us to 
 avoid learned technicalities as far as possible. 

For these and other reasons which might be given, 
 we earnestly request our practical farmers to write 
 for the Journal. Through them, alone, can we hopo 
 to render it the true exponent of Pennsylvania farm- 
 ing, an object of primary importance ; and the lead- 
 ing one with us. 

Thanks.

 handsome Chib lists. Hon. G. R. McFarland, Ilolli-

 of our enterprise, follow their example. A very 
 trifling amount of effort will secure like results wher- 
 ever put forth. AVith the honest consciousness that 
 we are laboring for the general good, we respectfully 
 solicit the aid and influence of every friend of agri- 
 culture in the State. 

Delay. 

In consequence of disappointment by our paper 
 maker, the publication of our present number has 
 been delayed several days later than we intended. — 
 Our arrangements arc now such, that we hope to bo 
 able to have the subsequent numbers ready by the 
 first of the month; a fact to whicli we ask thes2>ecial 
 attention of our correspondents. 

Advert isemeuts. 

To accommodate our advertising friends without 
 encroaching upon the space devoted to reading mat- 
 ter, wo have added two extra pages, to the advertise- 
 ments to which we ask the attention of our readers.
