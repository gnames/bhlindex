Seventeenth Animal Report of the 'Superintendent of 
 Common Sfhools. By A. 'L. Russell, Superinten- 
 dent: Ilarrisburg, 1851. pp. 75. 

The Governor of Pennsylvania, with a just appre- 
 ciation of the wants of the State, reeommendcd the 
 formation of a State Agricultural Department in his 
 annual message, and the Secretary of State takes an- 
 other step in the same direction in recommending the 
 formation of a State Agricultural Institution upon a 
 plan which he sketches at some length, but which vro 
 will not follow in its details. According to this plan, 
 there is to be accommodation for five hundred pupils, 
 of which three hundred are to be selected from the 
 public schools, and educated at the expense of the 
 State, during a period of six years from the age of 
 twelve. 

One thousand acres of land are proposed for the 
 institution, affording "a sufficient area for the practice 
 of tillage, after deducting space for woodlands, orch- 
 ards, pleasure grounds, yards and buildings. Its 
 surfiico should be diversified by hill and meadow, 
 adapted, in its several points, to the best culture, not 
 only of grain, but of vegetables and fruits, and to the 
 raising of aU kinds of stock." A library, and cabinets 
 in the various departments of science are included in 
 the plan. 

Eight professors are proposed for the following sub- 
 jects : 

1. English Literature and Mental Philosophy, ex- 
 officio President of the Faculty, with two assistants. 

2. General Uistory and PoUtical Economy, with 
 one assistant. 

3. Blathematics, with two assistants. 

4. Practical Farming and Rural Architecture, with 
 sis assistants. 

5. Agricultural alid general Chemistry, Geology, 
 and Botany, with two assistants. 

6. Natural Philosophy, Mechanics, and Engineer- 
 ing, with two assistants. 

7. Comparative Anatomy, and Physician. 

8. German Language, with one assistant. 

The assistants amount to sixteen, sis of wliich 
 "should be females." 

In the second grade of French schools, according 
 to Prof. Hitchcock's Report, there are six professors 
 as follows: — 1, Rural Economy. 2, Agriculture. 3, 
 Zootechny, or economy of animals. 4, Sylviculture 
 (forest trees) and botany. 5, Chemistry, Physics, 
 and agricultural Geology. 0, Rural Engineering. 

In the French Agronomic Institution, there are 
 nuic professors, of the following subjects: 1, Rural 
 economy and legislation. 2, Agriculture. 3, Zoo- 
 techny. 4, Sylviculture. 5, Rural engineering, lev- 
 eling, roads, architecture, and mechanics applied to 
 implements. 6, Terrestrial physics, (geology, &c.,) 
 and meteorology. 7, Agricultural Chemistry. 8, 
 Botany and vegetable physiology. 9, Applied Zoo- 
 logy. There are in addition, a Prefect of studies; a 

curator of the collections ; a librarian ; and an over" 
 seer of studios. 

Of the German schools, one at Brunswick has 
 lliirteen professors as follows: — 1, Physics and "-eno- 
 ral chemistry. 2, Pure mathematics, geometry and 
 linear drawing. 3, Mineralogy and zoology (geo- 
 logy?) 4. Architecture. 5, Transcendental mathe- 
 matics. 6, Rural economy. 7, Applied chemistry. 
 8, Mechanical technology. 9, Natural history. 10, 
 Raising horses, diseases, &c., of domestic animals. 
 11, Veterinary medicine. 12, Forest science. 13, 
 Architecture. (There are two professors in this 
 branch.) There are extensive cabinets, laboratories, 
 a museum, botanic garden, &e. 

The plan proposed by President Ilitchcock for the 
 State of Massachusetts, is worthy of attention, as it 
 is based upon an extensive examination of European 
 models. For a farm of moderate size he recommends 
 from 100 to 200 acres, with six professors of the fol- 
 lowing subjects: — 1, Horticulture, sylviculture and 
 rural legislation, who should be chairman or presi- 
 dent. 2, Agriculture. 3, Elementary and agricul- 
 tural chemistry. 4, Natural history, geology, and 
 curator of the collections. 5, Anatomy, phy.siology, 
 and veterinary medicine and surgery. 6, Mathema- 
 tics of agriculture, such as farm accounts, irrigation, 
 draining, surveying, leveling, roads, bridges, <S;c. — 
 " This appears to me to be the smallest number of 
 professors with which an institution can be respecta- 
 ble and useful, even at its commencement. Two 
 years is named as the duration of this course. 

The least learned and most inefficient member 
 of a college is often made its president, a rule which 
 should ba departed from in an agricultural iustitu- 
 tion, because there is no reason why this officer should 
 instruct in one branch rather than in another ; and it 
 might happen that the professor of Agriculture or 
 Chemistry would have better administrative talents 
 th<iu the professor of Literature or Rural economy. 

Mr. Russell omits zoology and the veterinary art, 
 and he assigns comparative anatomy to the physician, 
 insteading of dividing it (with physiology) between 
 the two former branches; because the general sub- 
 ject of these sciences is connected with zoology, whilst 
 their special application belongs to the economy, hy- 
 giene, and diseases of domestic animals. 

If a modification of Mr. Russell's plan were adopt 
 ed, the best pupils of the common schools would be 
 admitted, so that the lower grades of instruction 
 would not be included ; and if German and French 
 were well taught in the literary course, and a diplo- 
 ma granted to the graduates, a large number of col- 
 lege students would prefer it. German and French 
 are more useful than Greek and Latin, and as much 
 knowledge ai the latter might be acquired in a 
 course extending through six months, as would be 
 useful for etymological purposes. 

It is a humiliating fact, that in nine-tenths of the 
 American Colleges, notwithstanding their pretensions
