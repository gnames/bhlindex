even tliis amount of Greek and Latin is not taught, 
 it being extremely rare to find a graduate who can 
 deduce anything beyond the most obvious words. 

As an agricultural course of education in its vari- 
 ous ramincations would be adapted to the wants of 
 the population ; and as it would include studies which 
 are not appreciated in the literary colleges ; it would 
 exercise a wholesome influence upon the latter, and 
 compel them to teach modern science; whilst the 
 medical colleges would be under the necessity of in- 
 cluding studies which are deemed essential to the pro- 
 fession of medicine in Europe. 

The American Beeheepers' Manuel ; being a practical 
 treatise on the history and domestic economy oj^ the 
 Jioney bee, embracing a full illustration of the 
 s^lhjccf, loitli the most approved methods of manag- 
 ing this insect through every branch of its culture. 
 By T. B. Miner. Embellishell by 35 fine engravings, 
 New York: C. M. Saston, 1851, pp. 350. 

This is the fourth edition of one of Mr. Sastou's 
 useful publications, and the more worthy of attention, 
 because it is the most extensive American work on 
 the subject, founded upon practical observation. It is 
 rather strange that there should be so few observers 
 of the habits of bees in this country, the subject be- 
 ing an interesting one wliioh has attracted much atr 
 tention in Europe. This is evident from the fact that 
 at the death of the distinguished entomologist. Pro- 
 fessor Audouin, his libr.ary was found to contain 74 
 different treatises on the honey-bee, and at least 150 
 on the silk-worm and silk culture. 

We have no practical knowledge of bees, having 
 been prevented from getting thera on account of kial- 
 mia (commonly called laurel) growing in our vicinity, 
 a plant which produces poisonous honey. Wo can- 
 not therefore vouch for the practical part of Mr. 
 Miner's book, although he writes like one who under- 
 stands his subject. Some of his information will 
 not be appreciated, as when he announces his ability 
 to " look as far into a millstone as any man," — p. 
 143 ; and asserts that the antennae of bees are " the 
 organs of smell ;" — p. 339 ; and that "the eyes are 
 situated upon the upper surface of the head," — these 
 organs being upon the sides of the head, the three 
 stemmata being above. The notion that the black 
 bees sometimes seen owe their color to age, is not 
 Bupportcd by the general facts furnished by the in- 
 sect world. Insects require light to give them their 
 natural color, but old individuals are very apt to 
 fade. 

Mr. Miner states that there is " not the slightest" 
 organic diSference between the various kind of work- 
 ers, wliilst Ilubcr asserts that the wax-workers have 
 the abdomen more dilated. The labors of the fath- 
 ers of apiculture should not bo rashly condemned 
 as our author is inclined to do on p. 56. Among the 
 authors there mentioned are Hunter, one of the dis- 
 coverers of the origin of wax ; and Schirach, the dis- 

coverer of the mode of forming a queen out of the 
 larva of a worker. 

Discrepancies are to be found in the accounts of 
 various authors, some of which are to be accounted 
 for by differencs of country temperature, or location. 
 Mr. ]Miuer agrees with those who assert that the bee 
 moth enters the hive, whilst one of the Patent Ofiice 
 Eeports states that the eggs are laid in external crevi- 
 ces, and that the larva enters the hive after being 
 hatched. Both parties may bo correct under certain 
 circumstances. 

In works of this kind a list of the best authorities 
 should be given, with the title and dates of the books 
 published, and the names of the principal discover- 
 ers should be stated. It is especially desirable to 
 have American publications and reprints mentioned, 
 including articles in the periodicals. 

The American Poultry Yard ; comprising the origin, 
 history aiul description of the breeds of Domestic 
 Poultry; loitJi complete directions for their breeding, 
 crossing, rearing, fattening, dr., by D. J. Browne, 
 author of the Svlva Americana. New York: C. 
 ]M. Saxton, pp. 324. 

If our author's reputation were to rest upon his 
 botanical compilation (Svlva america^a) under a 
 borrowed title, or upon the value of his pages devoted 
 to scientific disquisition, we might recommend that 
 his book should be placed with those of authors am- 
 bitious of enlightening the public upon subjects the 
 principles of which they do not understand. The 
 publisher states that from Mr. Browne's "intimate 
 knowledge of the history and habits of our domestic 
 animals, having devoted, probably, more attention to 
 the subject, as a whole, by reading and observation, 
 than any other individual in the country, the task of 
 preparing this work was assigned to him." From 
 this amount of knowledge we might have expected an 
 original work, but this is not so much a compilation 
 of materials as a wholesale adoption of the labor and 
 composition of others, particularly the work of the 
 Rev. E. S. Dixon, whoso name should have stood upon 
 the title-page. The aSected candor in mentioning in 
 his Preface the names of the authors of whom he has 
 made "free use" will hardly excuse him with those 
 who know the extent to which he has transcribed 
 many pages of history, observations, facts, and even 
 theoretical views without credit. He asserts that he 
 possesses the rare book "Ortus sanitahs" in the 
 very words used by Dixon in stating that 7te has it. 

The volume is illustrated with figures of the va^ 
 rious fowls described, and as many readers will not 
 caro about knowing who the authors of the va- 
 rious incorporated parts may be, it will answer their 
 purpose, as the selections are carfuUy made. Sev- 
 eral representations of the chick in the egg are given, 
 and the author states that this "has been so fully 
 described by many writers, from Aristotle down to 
 Reaumur, that I need merely refer the reader to
