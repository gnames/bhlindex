thorn." Yet this subject was in its infancy until a 
 recent period. 

Samuel Allen adds an Appendix, in which he treats 
 of the comparative merits of different breeds of fowls; 
 profits of poultry raising ; the egg trade and poultry 
 statistics. 

Apart from the defects we have pointed out, tliis is 
 a useful volume, which may be much improved in an 
 anotlier edition. 

Came. Bi/ W. Youatt and W. C. L. Martin; 
 being a treatise on their breeds, Management and 
 Diseases, comprising a- full history of the i-a7-ious ra- 
 ces, their origin, breeding, and inerits ; their eajiaci- 
 iy for beef and milk ; the nature and treatment of 
 their diseases, &c., d-c., with 100 illustrations. — 
 Edited by A. Stevens, New York : C. M. Saxton, 
 1851, 1);). 470. 

The names of Youatt and Martin are a sufficient 
 guarantee of the value of their writings, the former 
 having been eminently practical as well as possessing 
 a sound judgment upon farm animals, whilst Mr. 
 Martin stands high as a naturalist. 

The American editor has added the homeopathic 
 treatment as adopted by Gunther ; and although this 
 does not detract from the intrinsic merits of the book, 
 it will be douljtless hard to find a calf suiSciently 
 imaginative to be benefitted by it. 

We are favored by Mr. Saxton with a number of 
 the illustrations of this work, one of which, with the 
 article it illustrates, was given upon p. 21, although 
 the credit due in such cases was inadvertantly omitted.

Tlie Great Michigan PLOW. 

FOR SOD AND SUB-SOIL. 

THIS Plow, in the language of the Report of Committee on the 
 great trial of Plows in June last, appoin'.ed by the New York 
 State Agricultural Society, (by whom it was awarded a speciai, 
 pnEM.UM): ■• We regard this implement as a Most inr/a; m-esent 
 from the mechanic to the farmer, and in our opinion will effect a 
 greaL improvement in the tillage of land. Itjmh-erixes the soil in 
 an excellent manner, which, to be fully appreciated, must be seen- 
 and it accompUshes this pulveriz.ation with an amount of power 
 which, in reference to the work performed, is certainly not large 
 It tunes the sod completely, and covers it with a coating of loose 
 6,-u-th which makes a seed bed almost as perfectly as a spade " 

At Boston. Last season, this Plow was awarded a Oold Medal 
 and at every County Fair in the State of New York, at which it 
 was exhibited, the Proprietor received a Prenjium

IMPORTANT TO 
 Farmers &. Threshing Machine Makers 

riiHE subscriber respectfully begs leave to inform the public 
 J. that he has lately perfected a new Threshing Machine and 
 Horse P.wer. which in point of strength, durability, lightness of 
 draft and convenience in moving, is not surpa.sscd or equalled by 
 any machine in the United States. He also confidently affirms 
 that no machine of its strength and durability can be afforded aa 
 low. The invention of this machine has been the result of .several 
 years experience and hard study. We do not claim to have dis- 
 eovercd any new principle in philosopbv. but we do claim to have 
 discovered a plan by which old philo.sophical principles are more 
 correctly and advant.agcously applied than on any other machine. 
 The invention is secured by a caveat. 

These Machines can be had at Israel W, Grofi's Machine 
 Shop, at retail or by wholesale, on the most reasonable terms. 

The Power weights 000 pounds. It is made entirely of Iron 
 with steel journals, and is wtirranted to hold 8 horses, should it at 
 any time be necessary to use so many From 2 to 4 are a sufS- 
 cient number for common threshing.' We are about getting up 
 one much lighter for shop, purposes, that will be the cheapest and 
 most convenient thing in use; it might also be used with two or 
 three horses for threshing. The Powers andcylinderatid rnncavo 
 can be had by the Machine makers throughout the country, on 
 the most reasonable terms. 

All orders directed to the subscriber, at Lancaster city, will b« 
 thankfully received and promptly attended to.
