IMPORTANT TO FARMERS 
 And Thresliin^ Macliiuc Makers. 

THE subscriber respectfully begs leave to inform the publio 
 that he has lately perfected a new Threshing Machine and Horse 
 Powt-r, which in point of strength, durability, lightness of draught 
 and convenience in moving is not surpass(;d or cqualh'd by any 
 Machine in the United States; he also confidently affirms that no 
 Machine of its strength and durability can be afforded as low. — 
 The invention of this Machine has been the result of several 
 years experience and hard study. We do not claim to have dis- 
 covered any new principle in philosophy— but we do claim to have 
 dLscovered a plan by which old philosophical principles are more 
 correctly and advantageously applied than on any other Machine. 
 This invention is secured by a caveat. 

These Machines caube had at Israel W. Groff's Rlachine Shop 
 and at Prime & Colestock's Sash F'actory in North Duke street. 
 Lancaster city, at retail or by wholesale on the most reasonable 
 terms. 

The Power weighs 600 pounds. It is made entirely of Iron with 
 Steel Journals, and is warranted to hold 8 Horses should it any 
 time be necessary to use so many. From 2 to 4 Horses are a suffic- 
 ient number for common threshing. We are about getting up 
 one much lighter for Shop purposes that will he the cheapest and 
 most convenient thing in use; it might also be used with 2 or 3 
 Horses for threshing; the Powers and Cylinders and Coucuve can 
 be had by the Machine makers throughout the country on the 
 most reasonable terms. 

t)jS=, All order.=: directed to the subscriber at Lancaster city will 
 be thankfully received and promptly attended to.

HAVE been ditvtributcd throughout the Union. The concern 
 has been in successful operation for upwards of Sixty Years, 
 and may be said to have grown up with the City of Philadelphia, 
 where it was at first located. It has been gradually euP.rged to 
 meet the growing wants of the public, and is now, as it ever has 
 been, the most extensive of its kind in this country. The grounds 
 in cultivation being ten-fold greater than those of any similax 
 concern in the United States. 

As the Seeds sold by the proprietor are (with slight exception) 
 of his own raising, he is. consequently, enabled to ^^J^ Warrant
