Clttcs robini.e. — In Pennsylvania in the month 
 of June, this handsome insect may be met with upon 
 locust trees (Robinia pseudacacia), in the branches 
 of which they lived as a 
 larva. Its length (fig. 1) 
 varies from half an inch to 
 nearly nine-tenths of an 
 inch. The color is black, 
 with transverse yellow 
 bands, those upon the ely- 
 tra being somewhat irregu- 
 lar. The under parts are 
 varied with yellow, the 
 legs are reddish, and the 
 antennae reddish brown. 
 The female deposit* her eggs in the irregularities 
 of the bark, and the young when hatched, penetrates 
 into the interior to feed upon the wood. 
 The smaller branches are generally at- 
 tacked, and presence of the larva may be 
 known by the wood-dust about the aper- 
 ture where it entered, the cuttings being 
 for some time' ejected here. But the most 
 prominent is the swelling of the branch 
 at the [point of attack, which becomes 
 weakened, and is often broken off by 
 storms ; or dies, so that new shoots must 
 be thrown out below. From those causes 
 the tree becomes disfigured and material- 
 ly injured. The annexed figure (2) re- 
 presents a fragment of a locust branch 
 attacked by this insect.

 burrows of the larvoe, and their place of exit through 
 the bark. A plug of woody fibres is observable in one 
 of the burrows, similar to those made by the Elaphi.

Dr. T. W. Harris, in his "Insects injurious to Ve- 
 getation," states on the authority of Gen. Dearborn, 
 that the grubs of this species are full grown by the 
 20th of July, and the perfect insects leave the tree 
 early in September, in Massachusetts. From this it 
 is evident, that as they appear at different times in 
 various parts of the country, the proper season for 
 cutting wood infested by them must vary. Hoop- 
 poles should be cut before the eggs are laid, or they 
 should be soaked some time in water. This would 
 kill the larvse, not only of Clytus, but of another and 
 much smaller insect, which burrows beneath, and 
 loosens the bark, and penetrates and destroys the 
 wood of hoops, long after the barrel has been finished 
 and applied to its proper use. 

Dr. Harris recommends whitewashing the trunks 
 of trees to prevent the insects from affixing their eggs; 
 he also recommends catching the adults and drowa-
