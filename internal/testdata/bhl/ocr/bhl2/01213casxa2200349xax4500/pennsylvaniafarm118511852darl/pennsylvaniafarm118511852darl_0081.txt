- Agricultural Education. 
 Mr. Editor : — I shall again try my hand at turn- 
 ing another furrow of the old, stiff sod we have been 
 attempting lately to break up, and shall begin by 
 iterating the appeal I made in my last, to the friends 
 of agriculture, in behalf of providing a suitable edu- 
 cation for the rising generation — the youth of the 
 Rural Districts, who are to occupy the same places 
 we now fill, to till the same fields in which we have 
 tolled, and on whose capaljilities will mainly depend 
 the position Pennsylvania is to hold among her sis- 
 ter States of the Union. Would that I could impress 
 upon all, even but a portion of the concern that for 
 years has weighed upon me in regard to the imports 
 ance of a measure fraught with^influences so pervad- 
 ing as to effect every individual in the community, no 
 matter to what class he belongs. Let any one try to 
 reason himself into a belief that he is independent of 
 the consequences, whatever be the condition of the 
 yeomanry, whether enlightened or unenlightened, and 
 if he does not find, on the issue being fairly made, 
 that it is in vain to escape being directly or indirect- 
 ly within their influences, he is one in a thousand, or 
 rather should say, ho is without the pale of well-re- 
 gulated society. It cannot be denied, however, that 
 the farmers themselves have the most direct interest 
 in the education of their sons, and should be held re- 
 sponsible for the measure, yet it is the duty of all, as 
 well as the interest of all, to see that the means be 
 provided and the end attained — to see in full, that 
 the landed interest is cherished and promoted, not 
 incidentally, but specially and primarily, as the first, 
 great leading and permanent interest of the common- 
 wealth. 

If agricultural education be left to the farmers 
 alone, it will, I fear, be retarded, if at all promoted ; 
 this is certainly to be regretted, but the apprehonsion 
 is no less plain than painful to my mind. Their un- 
 obtrusive habits, their constant labor and isolated po- 
 sition, stand in the way of even making the discovery 
 that any improvement is needed in farming, as well 
 as unfit them for pushing on a reform, if they per- 
 ceived the necessity of a change. They, in general, 
 are content to leave things as they are ; they follow 
 the same practice in tillage and husbandry that their 
 fathers pursued, and think it good enough for the 
 observance of their sons. Tliis apathy, or content, 
 if you will, is the perpetual bond or chain that binds 
 them to a hard and monotonous servitude at mere la- 
 bor from boyhood to old age — a condition, did they 
 permit themselves to think rightly about, they would 
 try to avert, in view of the comfort and prosperity of 
 their offspring. 

Who among us but must regret the want of science 
 and skill in the varied operations of farming ? Have 
 we not toiled with but indifferent success for the want 
 of an agricultural education, and has not the little we 
 have achieved been won by dint of unceasing toilj 

tlirough many a long and weary day of plodding 
 drudgery, that depressed the spirit while it bowed 
 the body ? AVhat father, though by his practice he 
 may have added to the acres ho inherited, or at first 
 began upon, would not desire that with the land, his 
 sun should inherit also an education, which, if it did not 
 abridge his laljors, (as I aver it would,) would throw 
 around it intellectual rays to brighten his path thro' 
 every scene and season — a mind so cultivated that not 
 only the dews and rains of spring, the fervid heats of 
 summer, but the frosts and snows of winter, would 
 furnish subjects for interesting research and investi- 
 gation ; while his manures, soils, seeds, crops and 
 stock would serve as material for analysis and expe- 
 riment in his vast laboratory, the farm. Let no one 
 tell me that a farmer so constituted could not raise 
 better crops at less expense, fill his barn and stables 
 from less land, and increase his wealth easier and 
 faster than he who depends solely upon the force of, 
 persevering toil, in a system that discards science, 
 provided both were alike honest and faithful. Should 
 not every patriotic citizen, as well as the farmer, aid 
 in providing the means and devising a plan for pro- 
 motJng agricultural education in Pennsylvania ? 

Having, on a former occasion, suggested farm col- 
 leges at appropriate localities, with buildings and 
 farms suitable for the accommodation and training 
 of one hundred to one hundred fifty students to each, 
 I deem it more necessary now, to show the necessity 
 for such institutions, than to discuss the merits of 
 arrangement. The expediency of the measure claims 
 precedence, when that shall be conceded, it will then, 
 be in place to treat of suitable sites, buildings, teach- 
 ers and systems of instruction. 

Of the necessity of instituting agricultural schools 
 or colleges, wherein shall be taught the theory and 
 practice of tillage and husbandry, upon rational and 
 deducible principles, to supersede the wasteful, un- 
 productive system that so universally prevails, a few 
 observations on the abstract operations of farming 
 must for the present suffice. To attempt showing in. 
 detail all the errors, mistakes, misapplications and 
 hap-hazards of farming, as it is, would require much 
 time and more space than can be allotted to an article 
 for a monthly. It would fill a volume to treat even 
 cursorilj', of the manure heap, stables and stock, of 
 breeding and feeding, hay, mow and granary, crop- 
 ping and seeding, garden and orchard, dairy, pasture 
 and soiling, breaking up and laying down with graia 
 and grass. 

The neglect to husband manure properly, is almost 
 universal. There are but few, comparatively, who 
 give sufficient attention to the matter, or who under- 
 stand this important point in husbandry. Suppose 
 the stock on a farm be judiciously fed and attended — 
 the horses and cattle as workers, the cattle, sheep 
 and swine, in view of dairy, breeding, slaughtering, 
 &c. — how much would the whole cost of feeding be
