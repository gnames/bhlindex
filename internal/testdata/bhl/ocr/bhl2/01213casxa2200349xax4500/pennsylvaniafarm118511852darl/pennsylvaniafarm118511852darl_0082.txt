Teducod under the management of a skilful husband- 
 man, through his attention to the special matter of 
 manure, with a given stock, on a medium sized farm, 
 than if the careless and -wasteful practice prevailed as 
 regards manure, though the same quantity of feed 
 should be consumed ? Not less than twenty-five per 
 cent. To arrive at this conclusion, it will be only 
 necessary to observe how the stables and pens are 
 littered and cleaned, whore and in what manner the 
 manure heap is kept, to look at the quality as well as 
 the quantity when applied to the land, then to follow 
 up the results on the forthcoming crops, and particu- 
 larly the condition in which the land is left when the 
 crops are removed; and no intelligent farmer can be 
 at a loss to decide with me, that the estimate I have 
 made in favor of good management, in this single 
 Tbranch of husbandry, is not overrated, If a thorough 
 investigation was made as to the unproductiveness of 
 the land through the want of manure, and the sink- 
 ing of the value of the land through severe and ill- 
 judged cropping, incapacitating it to maintain a due 
 proportion of stock, with the consequent loss in dairy 
 products, beef, mutton, pork, lard, wool, &c., it would 
 fall but little short of one million of dollars annually 
 in Pennsylvania. Take for instance, the average 
 yiold of wheat, which has been stated by some to be 
 no greater than twelve bushels to the acre, and sup- 
 pose this average can be increased three bushels, 
 which would raise it to fifteen, here then, we have the 
 million of dcllars in one product, wheat; but I go 
 farther, and say, that with a prudent management in 
 manure, and a proper application of it to the soil, the 
 average can easily be raised to eighteen bushels to the 
 acre. If the torturing and impoverishing system of 
 breaking up such breadth of land 3'early to seed, 
 without affording it sufficient manure to sustain it 
 against exhaustion, is not timely arrested, much of 
 our light soils will, ore long, be doomed to utter ster- 
 ility.. 

Another evil worthy of noting, is injudicious crop- 
 ping, I do not use not use the word in the sense of 
 seeding. I mean by cropping, the proper adaptation 
 of the crop to the quality and character of the soil. 
 The want of knowledge in this particular is attended 
 with serious disappointment to the unskilful farmer, 
 and untold loss to the public. For, be it remember- 
 ed, the public is made to suffer through every failure 
 in crops, and whether tho failure be owing to blight, 
 or to malpractice, it is a calamity equally to be de- 
 plored. 

There is, perhaps, no one operation on the farm 
 ■where want ol judgment is more palpable than in a 
 misapplication of crops. Almost every common hand 
 upon the farm can plow, plant and sow ; reap, gear, 
 haul and spread manure, but how few of those could 
 bo found capable of adapting a crop to the soil, or of 
 conducting a judicious rotation? Vei-y few indeed. 
 Not to be irreverent, "Do men gather grapes of thorns 

or figs of thistles ?" Skilful farmers look to the cha- 
 racter as well as the condition of the soil before they 
 seed it, and speculate not only upon the remunerating 
 crop, but upon the effect it will have exerted upon the 
 land after it shall have been taken off. It is incalcu- 
 lable, the loss sustained yearly in the waste of land, 
 seed and labor on crops not worth gathering, by rea- 
 son of their being raised on a soil uncongenial to their 
 growth or production. To inustra,te this: I have seen 
 wheat and timothy sown on a light dry soil, high ex- 
 posure, while a cold, wet, clayey field on same farm 
 was being seeded to rye and clover — clover alone for 
 moioing and paMuring. I have seen barley sown on a 
 piece of wet, low land, having a subsoil better adapt- 
 ed to raising bricks than barley, while the high gra- 
 velly part of same land was actually being sown to 
 oats. The result of these croppings was, as might be 
 expected, a failure. The wheat and timothy should 
 have been put to the field in which the rye and clo- 
 ver were put; and the rye and clover in the field 
 sown to wheat and timothy. The barley, if there ex- 
 isted a necessity for sowing it, should have had the 
 place of the oats, and the oats the place of the barley. 
 The rye lodged, not on account of its weight, for there 
 was scarcely a well filled head in tho whole field. — 
 The barley lay an iinsightly green mass at the time 
 barley generally was being harvested, without one 
 well filled ear. The fact was, the soil was not calcu- 
 lated to afford the properties required to give strength 
 to the stem or straw, much less to fill the head with 
 seed — tho same remark applies to the rye, while the 
 clover suffered as much as either from being out of 
 place. What there was of it, was of bad quality, while 
 the quantity was not one-third of a crop, for the cold, 
 wet ground it stood in, affected so injuriously as it 
 was with tho frosts in vi'inter, which made the whole 
 field one continuous board of frozen mud, on be- 
 ing thawed in the spring, left the roots of the clo- 
 ver to be spewed out, high and dry upon the surface. 
 Here there was some twenty acres of fine land put to 
 a worse use than had it been thrown out as a common 
 for stray cattle to range in. Now, if much of tho land 
 in Pennsylvania is so managed, who can count the 
 loss, and who will not be ready to conclude that it is 
 high time the school master should be abroad — I 
 mean the Agricultural School Master ? 

Time will not permit me going farther into this 
 subject at present, else I would show how much we 
 lose in dairy products, and root crops, through neg- 
 lect and bad management. The census of 1840 shows, 
 I think, that we fall short of Now York in the pro- 
 ducts of the dairy, some seven millions of dollars an- 
 nually, and in jjotatoes twentj' millions of bushels. — 
 Is not this a reproach to Pennsylvania ? 

Let any reflecting man look at this matter through 
 all its bearings, and he cannot but perceive the vast 
 accession of wealth that is within our reach, through 
 a well-ordered and judicious system of Eural Econo
