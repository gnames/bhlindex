my; and then ask himself, -would the endo-wraent of 
 agricultural seminaries or colleges be expedient? I 
 take leave to answer for him, tliat as a mere financial 
 scheme, a better has never been devised at the Capi- 
 tol in Harrisburg. The outlay upon agricultural 
 colleges ■would, in a few years, be returned to the 
 State in the increase of products ten-fold, increasing 
 and increased fifty, aye one hundred fold ! But, be 
 it noted, this is only the forming item — the cash ac- 
 count. The influences which such institutions would 
 exert upon the intelligence of the community, is of 
 vastly more moment, and rises superior to every other 
 consideration. Respectfully,

Plautuig Hedges—Hawtlioru vs. Osage Orange. 

Mr. Editor : — The enclosing of plantations by 
 hedges, or live-fences, is a desideratum which has at- 
 tracted the attention of most of the intelligent agri- 
 culturists of the country, during the past twenty 
 years, induced by the growing scarcity, and conse- 
 quent high price of fencing materials. 

Tourists have spoken ^vith rapture of the " neat 
 clipped hedges of Old England," and certainly the 
 live-fence has been nearly perfected in that country. 
 The hawthorn is tlie plant best adapted for defensive 
 hedges ; in the British Isles, where its use is almost 
 uuivcrsal,and properly trimmed it is truly formidable. 

Frequent attempts to cultivate the Hawthorn in 
 hodgeforms have been made in this country, but the 
 result has been invarlaljly a failure, as regards both 
 the native and foreign varieties. The cause of fail- 
 ure is owing mainly, to the depredation of the grub 
 (Saperda bivittata.) The attack commences, as in all 
 the Pyrus family at the surface of the ground, the 
 worm perforating the diameter of the tree in all di- 
 rections, eventually destroying it, and no efficient 
 remedy has yet been discovered, although nostrums 
 in abundance have been proposed. Another frequent 
 cause of failure, is a want of judicious cultivation, 
 indeed a want of cultivation at all — for it appears to 
 be generally understood, even among men claiming 
 to be intelligent, that it is simply required to plant 
 the tree and tliat in the shortest possible period of 
 time, without regard to Its wants and eapabllitles — 
 thenceforth it is expected to cultivate itself. Certainly 
 this is the only inference that can be drawn, from the 
 manner in which hedge plants are too frequently 
 treated. 

These causes have induced the inquiry : What is 
 the best defensive hedge plant, adapted to our cli- 
 mate, and free from depredation ? 

The Osage Orange (Madura aurantiaca) or Bois 
 D'Arc of the Southwest, is found indigenous in Ar- 
 kansas and Texas, and during the past five years an 
 immense quantity of the seed has been collected in 
 those countries and distributed over the eastern sea- 
 board, the facility with which it germinates, its easy 

culture, great hardihood, and the rapid growth com- 
 mending it to the planter, besides it is '' fully armed 
 for batttle " being provided with numerous, short 
 rigid thorns, that man or boast declines coming in 
 contact with. The whole plant is embued with a 
 lacteous fluid, slightly acrid, and adhesive, which 
 prevents cattle browsing on it. It also retains its fo- 
 liage, which is a beautiful light green, until sever- 
 frosts. It has no enemy of any account — in some 
 situations where the ground mice abound, the young 
 plants are liable to be injured. 

Experience points to this plant as the best adapted 
 for defensive hedges, in this country ; it is also high- 
 ly ornamental. 

The Madura is dioecious : that is, the male and 
 female flowers are produced on separate trees. A 
 wonderful display of the power of the pollen or im- 
 pregnating virus was manifested the past season on 
 the grounds of the Old Landreth nursery. A fe- 
 male JIaclura tree produced an abundance of flowers. 
 I procured male flowers -from a point foiu- miles dis- 
 tant and scattered them freely over the female tree, 
 the result was the enornloxis return of forty bushels 
 of fruit, containing sixty-two quarts of sound seed, 
 worth in the Philadelpliia market the past -winter, 
 four dollars per quart, or §250. In connection with 
 the above, I should have remarked that the particles 
 of the pollen are so minute, that the naked eye cannot 
 detect them. 

To cultivate the Madura successfully in hedgeform 
 it is not requisite to highly manure the ground in- 
 tended to be planted— average wheat land is sufficient. 
 The plants should be removed from the nursery with 
 care, (the roots where mutilated with the spade, cut 
 clean with the knife,) and planted ten to twelve inch 
 es apart, the ground having been pre-viously dug deep 
 and some two feet in breadth. Immediately after- 
 planting, the top of each plant must be cut off to 
 within six inches of the ground, which forces the plant 
 to throw out numerous branches. When the brandies 
 have attained the height of six or eight inches, cut 
 off all the tops of said branches, which forces out an- 
 other set of branches which must be treated precise- 
 ly in the same manner, using strong hedge shears. — 
 In case a dry season follows the transplantation, an 
 application of manure or litter to the surfoce sur- 
 rounding the plant will greatly benefit and prevent 
 evaporation. Tlie Madura to form a perfect hedge 
 requires clipping twice during tlte summer, never 
 adding to its height at any one clipping more than 
 six inches. It also requires a close clipping in Slarch, 
 or earlier, of the wood grown after the last summer 
 clip— the object of all this clipping is to render the 
 hedge compact by checking its rapid growth.
