Organization of the Honey Bee, &c. 

Mr. Editor : — Though doubtless as little disposed 
 as yourself to regard the "Atnerican Beekeeper's 
 Manual " with special admiration, permit me to say 
 that IMiner is correct in the statement that there is 
 "not the slightest difference in the organic structure 
 of the worker bees ;" nor are specific duties assigned 
 permanently to different classes of workers. Recent 
 observations and experiments, carefully made, have 
 shown that all woi'kers are, by nature, equally quali- 
 fied for every branch or subdivision of labor required, 
 and in tiirn perform it as occasions arise. There is 
 certainly a division of labor during the working sea- 
 son ; but there are no gangs of laborers, peculiarly 
 organized for particular branches or departments, to 
 •whom the appropriate work of each branch is as- 
 signed, as a distinct business or duty for life, or even 
 for the season. Even the famous hlach-hees, which 
 have attracted so much notice, and were often de- 
 scribed as possessing peculiar characteristics, prove 
 in the end to be organized in no respect differently 
 from their congeners, the common workers. Dr. 
 Alefeld, a distinguished German apiarian and ente- 
 mologist, lately subjected these bees to minute micro- 
 scopic examination, and the result was a clear con- 
 viction that, in bodily organization, tbeyare precisely 
 similar, in all respects, to the ordinary workers — 
 difference in color constituting the sole distinction. 

You are under an erroneous impression, also, when 
 you mention Schirach, as "the discoverer of the 
 mode of forming a queen out of the larva of a work- 
 er." Schirach never professed to have made the dis- 
 covery ; nor is it known by whom it was made. In 
 Lis treatise on the subject, published in the year 1770, 
 lie states that the process has been known for more 
 than twenty years, in Upper Lusatia, but having 
 been kept a secret, it was practiced only by a small 
 number of apiarians. All the merit he claimed was 
 that of having promulgated the discovery, after veri- 
 fying it by experiment, and simplifying the process. 
 Swammerdam, in his ^^ Bible of Kature," published 
 in 1752, at Leipzig, says that a then living and very 
 intelligent apiarian possessed and had communicated 
 to him, the art of producing queen bees from worker 
 eggs or larva. Ho also describes the process very 
 minutely and states most of the conditions requisite 
 for its success. Though by some German writers it 
 has been alleged, that the art was known and prac- 
 ticed as early as the year 1735, yet Swammerdam's 
 account appears to be the earliest published notice of 
 it, and corroborates Schirach's statement that it had 
 been known for more than twenty years before the 
 time at which he wrote. Schirach himself regarded 
 the discovery as accidental, and as having been made, 
 almost simvdtaneousl}', in different districts. 

The discovery itself is undoubtedly one of much 
 interest and importance ; but as the principles on 
 which success depends were not fully understood un- 
 til within the last twelve or fifteen years, the process 

has not, till quite recently, been availed of in prac- 
 tice, on an extensive scale, with beneficial results. — 
 But since the publication of Dzierzon's " Theory ami 
 Practice," by 'which most of the mysteries which 
 so long shrouded the natural history of this insect 
 are elucidated and removed, the process has become 
 an essential part of modern improved practical bee- 
 culture, as regulated by scientific principles. 

Permit me to say, also, that Miner is not far wrong, 
 in stating that the eyes of the bees " are situated on 
 the upper surface of the head." Those organs on the 
 sides of the head which have usually been called 
 eyes, are undoubtedly such; but they are not the only 
 organs of vision. The recent microscopical investi- 
 gations of Professor Barthe, of EiohstUdt, one of 
 the editors of the "Bienenzeiiung"' demonstrate that 
 what are commonly called siemmata, and which are 
 differently placed on the heads of the worker, drone 
 and queen respectively — are in reality eyes, designed 
 and used for specific purposes of vision, in accord- 
 ance with the peculiar habits and wants of the insect. 
 In the "Bienenzeitung" for January 1, 1851, this 
 question is finally disposed of. 

The organs of smell, however, which Bliner, singu- 
 larly enough, supposes may be found in the antennre, 
 are situated in the face of the bee, below these latter 
 members. The two foramina serving for nostrils, 
 pass through the outer corneous skin ; immediat-ely 
 behind which there is spread out a faushaped corru- 
 gated expansion of the true skin, reticulated by nu- 
 merous nervures — an arrangement or contrivance 
 evidently constituting the insect's organs of smell. 

Without entering on a critical examination of Mi- 
 ner's book, as a work " worthy of being called a full 
 practical treatise " on bee-culture, I may advert to 
 a few particulars wherein I conceive his statement to 
 be deceptive or erroneous. 

It remains to be proved, for instance, that the 
 queen bee ever deposits the egg in a royal ex-queen 
 cell ; or that the larva in such colls are supplied v.'ith 
 food other or more pungent than that furnished to the 
 worker brood. According to the more recent obser- 
 vations, the probabilities are against these positions 
 or assumptions. There is reason to believe that the 
 size and perhaps the position of those cells, together 
 with their peculiar construction, allowing entire free- 
 dom and perfection of developement, are the sole 
 cause why the larva bred and matured therein, 
 emerge as queens, which would have come forth 
 workers if bred in the narrower horizontal colls. 

Again, — Mr. Miner alleges that "the two kinds of 
 eggs — for worker and drone bees, namely — are ger- 
 minated in perfectly distinct and separate bodies, 
 no organic separation exists in the formation of the 
 ovary, as has ever yet lioen discovered." This is in 
 direct variance with the results of the latest physio- 
 logical examinations of 'the insect. From these it 
 seems to be pretty well settleii that the eggs of the 
 queen, as developed in her ovaries, arc all originally
