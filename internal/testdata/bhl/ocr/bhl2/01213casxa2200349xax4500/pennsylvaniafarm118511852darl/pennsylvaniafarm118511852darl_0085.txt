of the same kiud or charoxter; and that every un fe- 
 cundated queen, if productive, 'will lay eggs producing 
 drones only. The eggs of a fecundated queen, on the 
 other hand, may — as, indeed, far the greater number 
 of them do — in their progress through the oviduct, 
 become impregnated by the seminal fluid, as they 
 pass the orifice of the sac or gland containing it, 
 •which opens into the oviduct. If they be so impreg- 
 nated, and be then deposited, as they naturally — 
 perhaps nfcc3sarily — ^vrill be, in -worker cells remain- 
 ing such, or into worker cells which are subsequent- 
 ly ti-ansformed into royal cells, they are capable of 
 becoming developed into either workers or queens, 
 according to the kind of cell in which they are bred 
 and matured. But, if, in their passage through the 
 oviduct the eggs be not thus impregnated, each will 
 produce a drone — smaller or larger — as it may hap- 
 pen to be deposited in a drone or worker cell. A 
 fecundated queen, vigorous and healthy, wiU not — 
 probably cannot — deposits a drone-producing egg in 
 a worker cell; and it yet remains to be ascertained 
 whether the drones produced from the eggs of an un- 
 fecundated, or of a superannuated and enfeebled 
 queen, possess virility, or are in fact true drones. — 
 In the present state of our knowledge of this matter, 
 it seems probable that the size or diameter of the cell 
 determines whether the egg deposited therein by a 
 healthy fecundated queen, shall produce a worker or 
 a drone — a narrow or worker cell causing such a 
 compressing of the abdomen of the queen, when in 
 the act of laying, as results in an emission or effusion 
 of seminal fluid from the sac or gland containing it, 
 into the oviduct, as the egg passes its orifice or mouth : 
 and a wider or drone cell permitting the egg to be 
 deposited without such compression of the abdomen 
 and consequent emission of fluid. It would follow 
 of course, also, that the queen never deposites an egg 
 in a royal cell ; but that every such cell is construct- 
 ed after the egg has been deposited in a worker cell 
 — by removal of material, remodelling it, and totally 
 changing the arrangement and position. Ilowever 
 this may be, the fact appears to have been demon- 
 strated that every healthy fecundated queen deposites 
 worker and drone eggs, respectively, in their appro- 
 priate cells; and that every unfecundated queen, if 
 fertile, deposites drone eggs alone, in either class of 
 cells indiscriminately. Generally, however, such 
 queens are sterile. 

It is to bo regretted that Mr. Miner indulges so 
 frequently in sneers at the blindness and imputed ig- 
 norance of Iluber. Blindness was Huber's misfor- 
 tune, entitling him to our sympathy; while his valu- 
 able contributions to natujral science, made under such 
 unfavorable circumstances, challenge our admiration 
 and deserve our praise. That he was ignorant of 
 many things pertaining to his favorite branch of 
 study, which are now well known, is not surprising 
 and reflects no discredit on him: — the same is true 
 of Sir Isaac Newton. Yet, I will venture to say that 

Iluber was more fully posted up in all things relating 
 to the science and practice of apiculture, as it existed 
 in his day, than Mr. Jliner is, in reference to the 
 same topics, as they now exist. Nay, that he was, 
 on some important points, far in advance of his age 
 — which Mr. Miner cannot claim to be, on any.

[We are much obliged to our correspondent for his 
 remarks upon this subject, and hope he will occasion- 
 ally favor us with articles upon this or any other 
 subject suitable to the -Journal. 

As we remarked in our review of Miner's Manual, 
 we have no acquaintance with the subject of bees, 
 having never had them on account of the kalmia or 
 "laurel" being abundant in our vicinity. The few 
 remarks we made therefore, were general, and found- 
 ed upon the observations of others, and Schirach was 
 credited on the authority of others. The discrepancy 
 between Miner and Huber was mentioned to call at- 
 tention to the subject. 

Ancient observers are not the only ones likely to 
 be in error — for example, a correspondent in the 
 Boston Cultivator denies the whole theory, or rather 
 fact — of ruminating animals chewing their food after 
 it has been once swallowed. This should lead us to 
 extreme caution in a subject as difficult as that of 
 bees. AVe have known a person somewhat versed in 
 insects who could not discover the difierence between 
 a male and female insect placed before liim, although 
 really not difficult to perceive, and many parallel 
 cases will probably be detected in the histories of 
 bees. 

It must be remembered that various species of bee 
 are cultivated for the honey, in different parts of the 
 world, and consequently, it is unsafe to deny the 
 statement of one observer, until we learn whether the 
 species observed by him is identical with such as fur- 
 nish different results. 

The subject of bees has been treated by so many 
 observers that writers who do not make themselves 
 acquainted with the observations of their predeces- 
 sors run the risk of announcing old discoveries as 
 now ones. Thus, during the appearance of the 17- 
 years Cicada in 1834, a description of its singing 
 organs was given before a learned society, although 
 this had been done and a figure given in a work pub- 
 lished at Ferrara in the year 1600. Who knows 
 therefore what may not be said in the volumes of 
 Aalliorg, published at, for example, Copenhagen in 
 1G39 and 1042. 

The assertion as to the antennre being organs of 
 smell is as fiir from being proved as the counter as- 
 sertion that they are ears — and one German and one 
 English author go as far as to call them cars. 

jNIiner's assertion about the eyes being upon the 
 top of the head is about equivalent to saying that the 
 hair of a bear is upon the top of the head, the head 
 of some insects being nearly all eye, although the 
 stammata occupy but a small space. That the late- 
 ral eyes are the normal organs of vision in insects, 
 there can be no doul^it. — Ed.]
