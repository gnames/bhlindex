Farmers Sons and the teamed Professions. 

It has long been a general complaint that while 
 Agriculture is one of the oldest, and certainly most 
 commendable pursuits of life, it has never occupied 
 the prominent position it should have done, but has 
 ever been one of the most neglected and backward 
 of all sciences. This is certainly to be deplored at a 
 time like the present, where so much valuable infor- 
 mation upon every department of the subject may be 
 had at so comparatively trifling an expenditure of 
 time and money. Tliis state of things is attributable 
 to several causes, only one of wliich I shall refer to 
 in my present communication. 

Among the sons of our farmers, are found as fre- 
 quently as amongst any other classes of the commu- 
 nity, young men of rare natural endowments. No 
 sooner are their abilities discovered, than an itching 
 to see them lawyers, doctors, or preachers, takes pos- 
 session of the parents, or some ambitious friend or 
 relative. Thus, in nine cases out of ten, an excellent 
 farmer is spoiled ; and the learned professions as 
 they are termed, crowded with hungry applicants for 
 fame and fortune. By this, I do not desire to be un- 
 derstood as speaking disrespectfully of professional 
 men. Far from it. I merely wish to show that pa- 
 rents and young men are often misled by the inju- 
 dicious kindness and flattering of friends, who assume 
 the task of advising them in regard to their future 
 course in life. 

To do away the impression that farming is not a 
 disreputable pursuit should be the oliject of every 
 parent who really desires the happiness of his chil- 
 dren, although it is a humiliating thought that any 
 young man possessed of good common sense should 
 require any such teaching. There is certainly no 
 calling in life more dignified and truly independent 
 than that of the flirmer ; while it cannot be denied 
 that it is certainly one of the most pleasant and en- 
 nobling. If, instead of the silly desire of some pa- 
 rents to make professional men of their sons, they 
 would teach them to love and respect farming as a 
 science, and would endeavor to lead them to imbibe 
 a love for Scientific Agriculture, we should soon find 
 that instead of being regarded by many as a pursuit 
 fit only for the unlearned and rude, it would be ele- 
 vated to its proper dignity. 

It is with pleasure I behold evidences of a dispo- 
 sition to commence the good work. The young men 
 tliemselvos are taking hold of it in good earnest. — 
 Agricultural Societies are springing up in almost 
 every County in Pennsylvania ; and foremost in this 
 laudable reform, we find the young men. It is to be 
 hoped that their own self-respect will induce to press 
 forward the work with all their vigor, and to persevere 
 until they have accomplished all that is necessary to 
 place farming where it properly belongs — in the 
 front rank of the Sciences.

Hedging. 

Mk. Editor: — 

From the numerous advertisements in our leading 
 horticultural and agricultural journals, it appears 
 there are an abundance of seeds and plants of the 
 Osage Orange (5Iaclura aurantiaca) for sale : and if 
 the demand equals the supply, many of your readers 
 are among the purchasers, looking forward to the end 
 of three years to behold what? Their verdant fields 
 surrounded by an impenetrable living fence? No! 
 But to sad breaches in the continuity of their rows 
 and their consequent failure and mortification. Al- 
 low me through your Journal to give my short ex- 
 perience. 

Three years since some good seed was procured, 
 soaked and planted. It grew finely. The ends ol 
 the young plants suflered but little by the frosts of 
 the following winter, and in the spring were trans- 
 planted in double rows according to the method de- 
 tailed in the Ilorticulturist, vol. 1, p. 3-33. Their 
 vigorous growth and beautiful appearance during that 
 season was all that the most ardent could desire. — 
 The following spring when heading in (cutting them 
 oif six inches from the ground) you may judge of my 
 mortification to find that whole yards of hedge were 
 completely destroyed by mice ; the plants cut off se- 
 veral inches below the surface, and the roots eaten. — 
 These breaches were repaired only to be renewed 
 during the past winter. Lot it be distinctly under- 
 stood that these hedge-rows were cultivated on both 
 sides, the grass and weeds kept down. Indeed, in 
 many places where the ground was cultivated in corn . 
 and potatoes, kept entirely clean during summer and 
 autumn, it was in winter filled with tliis species of 
 mouse (Arvicola santhognatus). Some have sup- 
 posed that plants aro destroyed by moles (Scalops 
 canadensis) but I have frequently traced their ridges 
 in the immediate proximity of the roots, without a 
 fibre being eaten. 

Where those little destructive creatures are no 
 found so plentifully, or kept in check by cats, dogs or 
 hawks, and the hedges' are clipped thrice in the pro • 
 per season, a good barrier may be grown. 

In the first number of the Western Horticultural 
 Review, Dr. Warder, who has a splendid hedge of 
 this plant, gives his method of management — thi 
 best that I have yet seen. J. K. Eshleman.

Rice is being cultivated as an experiment in Cali- 
 fornia, on the San Joaquin. With rice along the river 
 banks, and wheat and barley growing in the back 
 country, California will yet be able to establish her- 
 self as a land of agricultural wealth. 

The consumption of beer in Munich for thj year 
 1850 was 39,000,000 of quarts. The city lays a tax 
 of i krcuzer on a quart; this tax nearly pays thj 
 whole municipal expenses.
