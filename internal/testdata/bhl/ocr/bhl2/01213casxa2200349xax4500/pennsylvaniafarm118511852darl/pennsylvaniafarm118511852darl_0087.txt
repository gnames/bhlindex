Shade as a Fertilizer, 

JIb. Editor : — In conversation ■with you a fotv 
 davs since, I incidentally mentioned, that I had made 
 the experiment of covering a grass field ■svith straw. 
 I at the time considered such matter as entirely too 
 insignificant to fill up the pages of your valuable 
 Jom-nal. You, however, appeared to think other- 
 yrisc — said you -wanted facts and desired that I would 
 give an abstract of the plan for your paper. I will 
 therefore comply with your request. 

Having a large quantity of wheat straw for which 
 I had neither use, nor room for storeage, I, in last 
 January concluded to draw it on a field that had 
 been laid down to grass, timothy and clover, two 
 years previously. The field contained about ten acres, 
 and we spread over the ground as evenly as we could, 
 some 12 or 15 two-horse loads. It was regarded at the 
 time by many persons, as a novel mode of disposing 
 of the surplus straw, yet generally believed to be ad- 
 vantageous. This spring it could plainly be seen to 
 have the effect of starting the grass earlier than in fields 
 adjacent, and causing it to grow with greater vigor. I 
 am fully convinced, that straw spread over the ground 
 at the commencement of winter, would in a great 
 measure prevent the frost from heaving, or lifting the 
 soil, which from the alternate freezing and thawing, 
 frequently occasions the destruction of wheat, clover 
 &c., the frost drawing the plants out of the ground, 
 and leaving them exposed on the surface. A light 
 covering of straw would in a great measure prevent 
 this. 

The practical fanner will eay, there is nothing 
 new in this, and it is not worth the room it occupies 
 in your Journal — and we partly agree with them. — 
 However, when this simple experiment is, taken into 
 consideration in connection ■n-ith, or rather in confir- 
 mation of 5Ir. Baldwin's theory, — that shade alone 
 will fertilize the most barren soils — or considered in 
 the light of mulcldng, it becomes a question of great 
 importance to the farmer and gardener, and in this 
 light may possibly be interesting to some of your 
 readers. 

The shadin* or covering the ground from the in- 
 fluence of GUI- burning sun, and drying winds — ^with 
 any decomposable substance, such as straw, leaves, 
 coarse litter, tan bark, and other materials, is well 
 known to be of great and manifest advantage to new- 
 ly planted trees — to beds of Raspberries, Strawber- 
 ries, Vine borders, and in fact it is believed that all 
 plants grow more vigorously by having a covering 
 over their roots. "We might refer to the forest for a 
 confirmation of these facts. The trees grow much 
 more rapidly and larger in those localities, where an 
 anual layer of leaves is left to shade the ground. 

By covering the soil with any refuse matter, it re- 
 mains in a more equable state, both as regards 
 temperature and moisture, the roots of trees and 
 plants find a more congenial medium to extract nour- 
 ishment from a cool and moist soil, and grow with 

far greater vigoi- — remain in a more healthy and 
 flourishing condition and consequently boar larger 
 and better crops. 

If you think the above worthy of a place in the 
 Journal, give it an insertion ; if not, consign it to tho 
 fire. Respectfully,

The Crows and Pigeons defeated— Swede Turnips. 

JIb. Editor — Last year the crows and my neigh- 
 bor's chickens and pigeons luxuriated on my newly 
 planted corn crops. I was determined to defeat them 
 this season, and h:ive succeeded admirably. I have 
 dipped the whole of my seed corn in gas tar and then 
 dried it with plaster. The early corn, and the first 
 planting of late is now up and not a hill has been 
 disturbed. 

Swede Turnips. — ^We obtained last year a very 
 heavy crop after hay, using about two cords of street 
 manure and 35 cwt. of guano to the acre, well incor- 
 porated together and carefully put into the • drills, 
 covered iip and instantly sowed the seed. Another 
 olservition is worthy of note, that new American 
 seed comes away quicker than the impoi'tod and out- 
 grows the attacks of the fly. K. Buisx.

The Ashes of Anthracite Coal. 

BY JONATHAN B. BUNCE, OF TAI.E COLLEGE LABORATORT. 

Coal, now so common an article of fuel in all bur 
 cities, leaves but a small quantity of ashes, yet when 
 we take into account the number of tons consumed 
 in a single year this amount becomes very considera- 
 ble; hence, it becomes a matter of interest to know 
 whether it can be considered of economical value. — 
 With this purpose in view, two samples of coal were 
 selected, the white and red ash varieties, and the 
 quantities soluble both in water and acid determined 
 with the foUovring results, viz: 
 White ash in water 3.74 I Red ash in water 3.35 
 White ash in acid 17.07 | Red ash in acid 18.65 

The following analysis is the mean of two determi- 
 nations of the portion soluble in acid. 

W. a. var. R.a.va. 
 Soluble silica 790 8.621 
 Alumina 35.201 29.575 
 Iron 29.643 40.614 

Lime 18.055 1.108 

Magnesia 1.730 13.992 

Total, 99,448 100.091 
 The results obtained in these two analyses seem to 
 justify the extensive use of coal ashes for agricultural 
 purposes; they are very valuable on account of the 
 sulphates of lime and magnesia which they contain, 
 and also from the phosphoric acid and alkalies. — 
 Hundreds of tons which are now wasted might thus 
 bo brought iuto use. — Proceed. Am. Assoc. 1851.
