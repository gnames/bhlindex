THE BREMEN GOOSE— DOMESTIC ECONOMY.

rapidly. In between three and four months from tlio 
 time of leaving the shell, they will be full-grown and 
 ready for the spit. They do not bear to be shut up 
 to fatten so well as common goe.se, and therefore 
 those destined for the table are the better for profuse 
 hand-feeding. Their flesh is well-flavored, short, and 
 tender: their eggs are good for cooking purposes. 

The Bremen Goose. — As quality of flesh, combined 
 with weight, is a main consideration, I wish to men- 
 tion, regarding the former, that the flesh of the Bre- 
 men goose is very diflerent from that of any of our 
 best domestic varieties. It does not partake of that 
 dry character which belongs to other and more com- 
 mon kinds, but is as tender and juicy as the flesh of a 
 ■wild fowl : besides it shrinks less in the process of 
 cooking, than that of any other fowl. Some of the 
 keenest epicures have declared that the flesh of the 
 Bremen goose is equal, if not superior, to that of the 
 celebrated canvas-back duck. There is assuredly 
 some comfort, not uncombined with ease, in carving 
 a bird that weighs seventeen pounds, and taking a 
 slice from the breast, so long as to be obliged to cut 
 it in two, that one-half may cover no more than the 
 ■width of a common dinner plate. 

The Bremen goose inclines to commence laying at 
 an earlier period thanHhis northern latitude "favors, 
 ■which is in the latter part of February. To give the 
 young fair play, it is not advisable that hatching 
 should be finished before the first of June. The 
 mode of prevention used by my father is as follows: 

The whole of the breeding stock, male and female, 
 are put into a dark room — say about the twentieth 
 of February — and kept there until about the tenth day 
 of April. When in durance they are well fed once a 
 day •with corn, and allo"n'ed sufficient ■n'ater all along 
 to drink. Once a week they are allowed to get out 
 for one hour, to wash and plume themselves, and arc 
 then shut up again. While thus confined, they lose 
 the inclination to breed, and do not assume it while 
 they are kept shut up ; but in eight or ten days after 
 they are set at liberty, the disposition returns, and 
 they commence laying. 

When first hatched, the goslings arc of a very deli- 
 cate and tender constitution. My father's general 
 practice, is to let them remain in the bos in which 
 they were hatched for twenty-four hours after they 
 leave the shell ; but he regulates this liy the weather, 
 ■which, if fair and warm, may tolerate the letting the 
 goslings out an hour or two in the middle of the day, 
 ■when they may wet their little bills and nibble at the 
 grass. They ought not to be out in rain at any time 
 during the first jnonth. A very shallow pool, dug in 
 tiie yard, with "bucket or two of water thro'wn into 
 it, to suit the temporary purpose of bathing, is sufli- 
 ciont during the period named. 

The practice of feeding my fother follows is, not to 
 give the goslings any grain whatever, after they are 
 four days old, until snow falls, when they require to 
 be fed on corn for a time. He thinks, however, that 
 if well fed on grain from the time they were hatched, 
 they might weigh from 4 lljs. to 7 lbs. more than by 
 leaving them to grass-feeding alone. 

By feeding his geese until they are four days old, 
 and then literally "sending them to grass," the weight 
 of my father's geese, at seven to eight months old, 
 has averaged from 17 to 18 lbs. each, after the feath- 
 ers had been cleanly picked ofi'. lie has no doubt 
 tliat 25 lbs. could be easily attained by a little atten- 
 tion to feeding ■nith grain. 

The breeding-boxes mentioned above are made in 
 the fashion something like a dog-kennel, with a roof 

pitched botli ways. They are 30 inches long, by 24 
 inches, and are 24 inches in height. The door is in 
 the end, and is covered by a sliding panel, which 
 moves upwards, when egress or ingress is sought, and 
 may bo shut down at pleasure. For the first month, 
 the geese and goslings are all shut up in the boxes 
 at night, in order to protect them against rain and 
 vermm. — Dixon and Kerr's Ornamental Poultry.

Advantages of Systematic Arrangement. — It is 
 well known that in domestic economy, good house- 
 keepers do actually derive this incidental advantage 
 from a day of rest through the week: — One day is 
 devoted to washing; one to ironing; one to cleaning 
 liouse; one to mending; one to baking; so that by 
 Saturday night everything is brought to a comely 
 state. None of those things are left for the approach- 
 ing week. Everything is arranged and in order, e . 
 if she did not expect to live another week. Men 
 should do the same on their farms. If they did they 
 would thrive and prosper. — Blake's Fanner's Every 
 Day Dook. 

To Make Green Salve. — Take freshly-gathered 
 white lily flowers, broad-leaved, common plantain, 
 ohiokweed, each, as much as can be grasped in a 
 man's hand; one pound of newly-churned butter 
 without salt; one pound of mutton suet, melted and 
 strained; one pound of bees-wax; and one pound of 
 rosin. Melt the suet and butter together, and boil in 
 them the herbs, xjntil thojuice is all extracted ; then 
 strain through a cloth, and add the rosin and wax. — 
 When melted and well mixed, strain again into a 
 queensware or earthen pan, and stir till cold, to pre- 
 vent separation. An excellent cooling and healing 
 salve for wounds and burns. 

To Kill Cockroaches. — Mix equal quantities of 
 red lead and Indian meal with molasses, making it 
 about the consistency of paste. It is known to be a 
 certain exterminator of roaches. A friend who was 
 trouliled with thousands upon thousands of them, rid 
 his house of them liy this mixture in a very few nights. 
 Put it upon pilates and set it where the vermin are 
 thickest, and they will soon help themselves. Be care- 
 ful not to have any articles of food near by where 
 you set the mixture. 

Bei>bugs. — There is a long article in the Yallcy 
 Far7}ier, by which it is cstaljlished beyond question 
 that sweet oil occasionally rubbed over bedsteads, 
 chair boards, &c., will eff'ectually prevent the appear- 
 ance of bed-bugs. We think it unnecessary to pub- 
 lish the evidence of the cfilcieucy of this cheap and 
 agreeable preventive of the nuisance in question. — 
 The reader wiU take our word that it is conclusive. 

To Clean Rusted Iron Work. — Cover over tho 
 work with oil and let it stand for five or six hours. — 
 Then wash it off with strong soap-suds and a goo 1 
 brush. The brush must bo long in the bristles. Iron 
 work should never be left wet any length of time. 

Cure roR Corns. — Pare off the hard part of the 
 corn with a sharp knife, not so as to cause it to bleed; 
 apply the inner part of an onion, mashed fine; keep 
 it on during the night, and a very few applications 
 will effect a cure.
