The Raspberry. * 

Our indigenous Raspberries, it is generally con- 
 ceded, are inferior in quality to those of European 
 origin. Over the latter, however, they possess one 
 advantage — that of hardiness. The foreign kinds, not 
 l>oing able to withstand the sudden vicissitudes of our 
 variable climate, are generally killed nearly or quite 
 to the ground, unless recourse is had to artificial 
 means of protection. All attempts to acclimate them, 
 however perseveringly continued, have failed. It is 
 therefore desirable that some other effort should be 
 made to obtain varieties, equalling them in size and 
 flavor, and possessing a more hardy constitution. 

It is a well known fact that all plants usually suc- 
 ceed best in their native land. To accomplish then 
 the improvement of the Raspberry, and indeed all 
 other kinds of fruit, we should raise seedling varie- 
 ties. In doing this, two modes present themselves 
 for our cousidera^on. In the one case, seed, artifi- 
 cially fertilized, is used; — in the other, that which 
 has been fertilized naturally, or without the interven- 
 tion of man. 

The first, commonly termed "cross impregnations" 
 is the most certain way of forming valuable varieties 
 and is conducted on precisely the same principle as 
 that pursued by our agriculturists in improving their 
 breed of cattle. A fine specimen of each sex, posses- 
 sing certain good qualities not common to both, is 
 usually selected, and a combination of their good 
 qualities may be expected in the offspring. 

The manner of performing the operation of cross 
 impregnation will not be described at present; but on 
 a future occasion it will probably be made the sub- 
 ject of some remarks. 

The other mode of producing new and valuable va- 
 rieties of raspberries suited to the peculiarities and 
 necessities of our climate, n.amely: by planting seed 
 which has' not been subjected to artificial fertilization, 
 also promises favorable results. The seed selected 
 should bo of the finest sorts, such as the True Red 
 Antwerp, Yellow Antwerp, Franconia, Fastolf, and 
 Kneaett's Giant, which are all of foreign origin, and 
 emanate from a species that has been under cultiva- 
 tion, in Europe, for many centuries. Seedlings from 
 theac varieties, like the progeny of many animals and 

VOL. I E. 

vegetables which, for a series of generations, have 
 been placed under the meliorating influences of arti 
 fioial culture, will be found to vary, in several re- 
 spects, from the parent. It is important tliat no pro- 
 tection should be given to the plants raised from seed; 
 they should bo subjected to severe exposure, in order 
 that all the tender ones may be killed off. We require 
 hardy varieties. 

The seed of the rospberry, even when planted im- 
 mediately after the fruit is ripe, will scarcely ever 
 vegetate till the following spring; differing in tliis 
 respect from the strawberry seed, which generally 
 germinate the same season they are planted, and fre- 
 quently fruit the following season. It is perhaps not 
 generally known, that raspberry plants, raised from 
 seed sown in the spring, will occasionally bear fruit 
 in the summer of the following year. This will more 
 certainly be the case, if the seed be planted in a pot 
 or box and placed in a warm room with a southerji 
 exposure, in February or March. 

Seedlings raised from foreign varieties will often 
 be found to sport considerably in foliage, and in the 
 form and color of the berry. From the seed of the 
 Fastolf, a crimson variety, I have raised plants, some 
 of which bear light cream-colored, some straw-colored 
 and some crimson fruit. From a seed of Dyack's 
 seedling, another crimson variety, originated the 
 orange raspberry, the fruit of which is neither red 
 nor yellow, but of a bright orange color. From seed 
 of the Col. Wilder, a cream-colored variety, and a 
 seedling of the Fastolf, I have raised a number of. 
 plants, the fruit of some of which is red, and of others 
 yellow of different shades. Having artificially fertil- 
 ized a blossom of the Fastolf with pollen from the 
 Yellow Antwerp, all of the seed contained in the 
 berry formed by this operation were planted. Many 
 of them vegetated ; but so tender were most of the 
 plants, that all save one perished. Tlie survivor, 
 (named the French as a compliment to my highly 
 valued friend the Hon. B. X. French, of Massachu- 
 setts,) bears a crimson fruit and seems to possess 
 more constitutional hardiness than either of its pa- 
 rents. One object in making the preceding cross 
 between a red and a yellow fruited variety was to as- 
 certain whether the fruit of the offspring would pre- 
 serve the separate color of one or the other parent, or 
 consist of a blending of the two.

Comparative cost of swords a.vd ploughsjiare?. — 
 It is estimated that the agricultural labor done in 
 England, in 1847, cost £18,200,000, and oflScial re- 
 turns show that the cost of her naval and military 
 establishments for the same year was £18,500,000, 
 that is £300,000 more than for all her golden har- 
 vests. 

TnE prospect of a bountiful harvest was never 
 more flattering than now. From every section of the 
 State we have the mo»t cheering accounts.
