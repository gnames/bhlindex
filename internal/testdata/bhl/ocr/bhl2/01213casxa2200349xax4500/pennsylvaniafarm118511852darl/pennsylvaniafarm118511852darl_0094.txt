Transplanting Pear Trees. 

Mr. Editor : — As you have expressed a desire that 
 farmers should communicate facts for your Journal, 
 I herewith offer one, -which though familiar to some 
 of your readers, may be new and valuable to others. 
 I have frequently heard persons complain of their 
 repeated failures in transplanting fruit and other 
 trees, but especially the pear tree. Having at various 
 times had occasion to transplant)- several fine young 
 pear trees, and knowing how repeatedly others had 
 met with ill luck, I was induced before attempting 
 the first one, to take counsel from a friend (whose 
 success was almost certain,) as to the plan to be pur- 
 sued. His advice was, first, to prepare the hole des- 
 tined to receive the tree, of a size not less than from 
 three to four feet in diameter, and from eighteen inch- 
 es to two feet in depth ; the depth and diameter de- 
 pending upon the size of the tree. The earth in the 
 bottom of the hole was well loosened to the depth of 
 four or five inches ; while that taken from it was 
 thoroughly pulverized, and when occasion required it, 
 enriched with manure. 

The nest thing to be done was to take up the tree, 
 about which too nuich care could not be exercised. — 
 The delicate fibres of the roots through which the 
 tree receives its food, were carefully protected from 
 injuries ; and no pains spared to preserve them as 
 entire as possible. To accomplish this more effectu- 
 ally, the digging was commenced at a suflicient dis- 
 tance from the body of the tree to enable the trans- 
 planter to ascertain how far the roots had extended 
 themselves, so that having ascertained this, he could 
 ■work to better advantage. After having loosened 
 the roots, and before removing the tree, a mark was 
 made upon the bark, in order that it might lie placed 
 in its ne-w homo, in precisely the same position in rela- 
 tion to the points of the conqMss, it formerly had. A 
 iufficient quantity of the enriched and well pulve- 
 rized earth was next filled into the hole to cause the 
 tree to stand at exactly the same depth as before. — 
 The roots were then nicely adjusted, so that every 
 fibre was brought in contact with the soil, in order 
 to effect which the hand was used, instead of the 
 spade. Some of our most distinguished horticultu- 
 rists recommend the plunging of the roots into a pud- 
 dle of thin clay or mud, but my experience as well as 
 judgment, advise a different course. One of the es- 
 eontial requisites to success in transplanting is, that 
 the delicate fibres of the roots be so arranged as to 
 take up nourishment from as large an amount of 
 •oil as possible. This can be done only, by separat- 
 ing them. Plunging them into a puddle of clay or 
 mud has the effect of causing them to cling closely to- 
 gether, and thus defeats the very object it is intended 
 to promote. If a bucket of water is poured in after 
 the roots are covered with soil, the same end to be 
 accomplished by puddling will be secured, with this 
 difference in favor of the former plan, that the fibres 

of the roots will be separated instead of adhcriiig to 
 each other in masses. 

After filling the hole, the soil should not be 
 pressed in too tightly, but a few days given it to set- 
 tle, and if occasion requires it, more soil may bo 
 added from time to time so as to keep the surface 
 even with the ground around it. 

By pursuing this simple plan, and talcing special 
 care to have the trees placed in their new p)Osition with 
 particular reference to the marlis on the bark, I have 
 been uniformly successful in transplanting. Several 
 of my friends have tried it with the .same success ; 
 and I am firmly impressed with the belief that if 
 this system .were generally adopted, there would be 
 fewer failures in this important department of Hor- 
 ticulture. 

I will merely add that I have always selected the 
 middle of April as the time for transplanting, though 
 Autumn would perhaps prove equally propitious. I 
 have also been careful in selecting, when practicable, 
 a dry situation, with a good loam soil, finding it best 
 adapted to the pear tree.

Destruction of Birds & Increase of Noxious Insects. 
 Mr. Editor : — It is a well known fact that thirty 
 years ago, our apples were, as a general thing, more 
 sound and perfect than now — our peach trees suffered 
 less from destructive insects — the ravages of the cur- 
 culio were scarcely worth mentioning, while many of 
 the injuries now inflicted upon our fruit and forest 
 trees were almost unknown to the Tarmer. It is an 
 equally well established fact that thirty years ago, 
 thousands of insectivorous birds were to be found on 
 our farms, where scarcely a single one is now to be 
 seen. Every tree and bush was alive with their 
 presence and the whole country made vocal with 
 their delightful warblings. Now, compare these tw© 
 facts, and what is the legitimate inference to be 
 drawn from them. Why, that the increase of noxious 
 insects has been in an exact ratio with the decrease 
 of the birds. Is not this subject worthy the atten- 
 tion of the farmers, and should they not combine 
 their efforts for the purpose of preventing the de- 
 struction of these useful and harmless little birds, 
 by lazy gunners ? 

In a former number of the Farm Journal, I ob- 
 served an article in which the use of chickens wai 
 highly commended as preventive of the increase of 
 the eurculio. Believing the suggestion an excellent 
 one, I have arranged my yard so as to enable me t« 
 keep a number of chickens in the vicinity of mj 
 plum trees. If chickens are the enemies of the eur- 
 culio, and can be made useful in preventing their in- 
 crease, why should the farmers permit the little bird* 
 to be destroyed, when it is well known that they are 
 the most effectual means of preserving his fruits and
