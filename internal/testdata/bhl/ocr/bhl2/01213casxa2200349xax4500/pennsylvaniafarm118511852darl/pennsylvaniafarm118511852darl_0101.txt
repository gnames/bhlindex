three general heads. The Jirsf, is a large, short- 
 legged, strong, exceedingly hardy sheep, carrying a 
 heavy fleece, ranging from medium to fine — free 
 from hair in properly bred flocks — somewhat in- 
 clin«d to ihruatiness, but not so much so as the l-lam- 
 bouillets — In-ed to exhibit external concrete gum in 
 Bome flocks, but not commonly so — their wool long- 
 ish on both Ijack and belly, and exceedingly dense — 
 wool whiter within than the Rambouillets — -skin the 
 same rich rose-color. The ram is a good specimen of 
 this variety, though his age is not sufficient to give 
 liim the substance and compactness of an older ani- 
 mal, and the apparent want in these particulars is 
 Lightened by recent shearing. His first fleece of 
 well-washed wool, at thirteen months old, was 8 lbs.; 
 was of beautiful quality, and entirely destitute of 
 hair. At throe years old he would have sheared 
 from 10 to 12 lbs. of well-washed wool. — Bandall's

Cicadi septeudecim. 

The seventeen-year cicada (or locust) is now (May 
 20,) appearing in Eastern Pennsylvania, and as it 
 appears in different years in various parts of the 
 country (sometimes twice in seventeen years, by two 
 regions bordering and overlapping) it is important 
 that the regions over which it extends should be 
 noted, that they may be marked upon a map, and 
 thus presented at a single view. We therefore re- 
 quest all editors to aid in collecting information upon 
 the subject. 

Maps should be constructed for each year in which 
 these insects appear, because as they are likely to 
 emigrate, or to be driven by storms beyond their for- 
 mer limits each time that they appear, they must 
 finally cover the whole country like the other species, 
 which, though they appear every year, are in aU pro- 
 bability seventeen years in coming to maturity. 

Miss M. A. Morris has discovered that the larva 
 of the insect in question does not penetrate the soil 
 to a great depth, but attaches itself permanently to 
 the roots of trees, enclosed in a kind of cocoon made 
 of clay. She made the discovery by examining the 
 roots of some peach trees which were in an unhealthy 
 condition, when she found the larvas as described, 
 with the rostrum piercing the bark of the tree, and 
 thus withdrawing its juices. 

We regret that in our last number, it was uninten- 
 tionally forgotten to credit the articles on the Dork- 
 ing Fowls, as well as the Devon Ox, to their 
 proper sources. The first was from " Brown's Ame- 
 rican Poultry Yard," and the latter from Youatt & 
 Martin's celebrated work on Cattle. Both of these 
 books are published by Mr. C. M. Saxton, 123 Fulton 
 street, Xew Y'ork, to whom we arc indebted for the 
 cuts and other favors. 

In our notice of the new medal of the Pennsylva- 
 nia Horticultural Society, in our last number, it was 
 forgotten to state, that it was a gift to the Society, 
 by the President, Caleb Cope, Esq., and that the cost 
 of preparing it was several hundred dollars.
