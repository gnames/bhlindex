PROCEEDINGS. 

Agreeably to a series of resolutions passed recently 
 by the Philadelphia Society for Promoting Agricul- 
 ture, proposing a ploughing match between this and 
 several neighboring counties of the State, a meeting 
 was lield yesterday morning, at the room of the Phi- 
 ladelphia Society, to make preparations for tlie ob- 
 ject in view. The following gentlemen were present 
 as delegates, to wit: Thomas Warner and AVilliara 
 Stavcly, of Bucks county; Hon. A. L. Hayes, -Jacob 
 T. Ilerr, and Andrew M. Spangler, of Lancaster co.; 
 Hon. Wm. Henry, William Hammill, Edwin Moore, 
 Samuel Roberts, and Thomas Knox, of Montgomery 
 en.; Dr. A. L. Elwyn, P. 11. Freas, James S. lluber, 
 Peters Hulmo, A. T. Newbold, George Blight, Saml. 
 Williams, John Lardner, and Owen Sheridan, of 
 Philadelphia county. 

The meeting was organized by the election of the 
 lion. A. Hayes as chairman. 

It was resolved that each county participating in 
 the proposed contest, shall be at liberty to select such 
 plough or ploughs as it may prefer, and that a gene- 
 ral invitation be extended to the manufacturers of 
 ploughs, every where, to send their respective ploughs 
 for trial on the occasion, 

It was further resolved that the ploughmen who 
 are engaged in the contemplated contest shall come 
 from, or belong to, one of the several counties be- 
 tween which the match is made. 

Norristown, in Montgomery county, was designated 

... • 1 J i-r • -J „ „r as the locality at which the match shall take place, 

seriptions received, and are gratifying evidences ot j »i £ ^ V j r r\ ^ \ V i ' 

i^ ' » J o L and the first Tuesday of October was fixed upon aa 

the general interest felt throughout the State in be- 
 half of the Journal. But from some of our finest ag- 
 ricultural districts, we have not had much encour- 
 agement. Will not some friends in Washington, 
 Westmoreland, Fayette, Bucks, Susquehanna, York, 
 &c., send us on clubs. Will not Lancaster give us a 
 stronger evidence of her regard. We look for much 
 from Lancaster County, and hope before the issue of 
 our next number to be able to state that she too has 
 come up to the good work, with the spirit that will 
 convince her sister counties, that the "garden spot" 
 is thoroughly awake on the subject. 

Grand Ploughing Match. 

By a reference to the proceedings of the convention 
 given below, it will be seen that the ploughmen of 
 Bucks, Lancaster, Montgomery and Philadelphia 
 counties are to have a fine opportunity of testing their 
 skill with the plough. Such trials cannot but have a 
 most salutary effect, and we trust that each one of 
 these great counties will be well represented in the 
 contest. 

For the information of manufacturers of ploughs 
 not residing in any of the above named counties, we 
 will state, that if they desire to compete for the pre- 
 miums, they can do so only by having their ploughs 
 entered by ploughmen residing in the above counties. 
 This is important to be understood, as it is a matter 
 of great moment to have a plough introduced into 
 the contest by a person well skilled in the use of it. 

Newspapers friendly to this laudable contest will 

the time. 

It was also resolved that the contest shall be con- 
 fined to the ordinary plough, excluding the bill-side 
 and subsoil ploughs. 

Throe grades of premiums were provided for 
 ploughs, and three for ploughmen, as follows: 

The judges for the occasion are to be appointed by 
 each county for the agricultural society thereof, and 
 it was resolved to recommend to each county or 
 county society concerned in the match, to raise re- 
 spectively a proportionate share of tie money to be 
 distributed in jjremiums. 

The judges of the contest are to be empowered to 
 make the rules and regulations for its decision, and 
 arc to publish the same at a suitable time, antecedent 
 to that at which the match is to take place. 

The committee of arrangemnts for the occasion is 
 to be appointed by the Montgomery Agricultural So- 
 ciety. 

As soon as the judges are appointed in each coun- 
 ty, the fact is to be communicated to the Pliiladelpfc'a 
 Society, which is authorized to call a meeting of the 
 judges at such time and place as maybe deemed ex- 
 pedient. After settling some other less important 
 preliminaries, the meeting adjourned. — North Ame-
