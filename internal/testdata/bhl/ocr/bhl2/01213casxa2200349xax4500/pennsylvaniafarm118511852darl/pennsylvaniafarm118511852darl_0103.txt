Peysson's Deodorizer. 
 A. S. Roberts, Esq. will please accept our thanks 

for a copy of the report of " the Committee appointed 
 by the Pliiladelphia Society for Promoting Agricul- 
 ture to examine the method and propositions of Jlr. 
 Peysson for the disinfecting and cleansing of cess- 
 pools, and the manufacturing of chemical manure." 

We regret that we have not room for the entire re- 
 port, as it is an able document, and the subject one 
 of the highest importance. AVe give the most impor- 
 tant parts of it. 

" The disinfection of cess-pools and the purification 
 of the atmosphere affected thereby, have long engaged 
 tlio attention of the scientific ; while the economical 
 application of the fecal and, other matters of large 
 cities is of primary importance, especially to a com- 
 munity like ours, surrounded by an agricultural 
 country, the soil of which requires constant replen- 
 ishing to sustain its productive powers. 

In the city of Paris more successful modes have 
 been adopted than elsewhere ; and the result is high- 
 ly promotive of cleanliness and health, while the 
 profit is represented as being very large. This may 
 readily be admitted, when, according to Liebig, 
 Dompsey, and others, the nitrogen resulting from 
 any amount of population is equal to the supply re- 
 quired for two pounds of bread per diem for every 
 one of its memljcrs; and the total manuring matter, 
 solid and liquid, produced in a town are, as compu- 
 ted by G. D. Dempsey, C. E., equal in weight to one 
 ton annually for each inhabitant. 

In London, the subject of sewerage, drainage and 
 cleaning of cess-pools is engaging increased attention, 
 and various means have been proposed to the Metro- 
 politan Commission of Sussex for collecting and ap- 
 plying to the improvement of the soil and the vast 
 amount of animal and vegetable substances that is 
 constantly drained into the river Thames. 

The jealousy and care with which night soil is hus- 
 banded throughout almost the whole of Europe, is 
 one of the best evidences of the high value placed 
 upon it. The Chinese preserve it with the greatest 
 care, and after mixing it with a rich marl and form- 
 ing it into cakes it becomes a regular article of traf- 
 fic. The committee proceed to say: 

There are, however, iu our large city, immense 
 quantities of animal and vegetable matter suffered to 
 go to waste, and the collection and useful conversion 
 of which are embraced in the plan of Prof. Peysson, 
 in addition to an entire change of the present rude 
 and offensive cess-pool constructions, which it is 
 hoped "may soon be reckoned amongthe obsolete mis- 
 takes of our forefathers." Such is the care bestowed 
 on the Collection of fertilizing substances in Paris, 
 that nothing capable, through the agency of the 
 chemist, of being converted into manure, is suffered 
 to waste. The abattoirs, or public slaughter houses 
 of that city, contribute largely to the preservation of 
 health, economy and comfort of the inhabitants ; our 
 public authorities would do well to estalilish similar 
 regulations in the city and county of Philadelphia. 

The same remarks will apply to every town and 
 village in the State and elsewhere, for in addition to 
 its value as a manure, in a sanitory point of view it 
 becomes highly important. 

Sir. Peysson's method of disinfecting and convert- 
 ing fecal matter into manure, more particularly en- 

gaged our attention as the proper inquiry for an 
 Agricultural society. 

Ilis process, or the materials used, we were appre- 
 hensive might effect destructive decompositiiin, and 
 deteriorate the fertilizing properties of the substances 
 acted on. 

A close and careful examination, however, satisfied 
 Prof. Boyo that the fertilizing principles of his chem- 
 ical manure are not impaired, and that he can, by 
 the proper application of the materials used, disinfect 
 or deodorise fecal and offensive substances. 

We understand from Mr. R., one of the committee, 
 that since the publication of the report, experiments 
 have been made on the farm of James Gowcn, Esq., 
 at jVt. Airy, to de-oderize in the presence of one of 
 the committee the contents of an old cess-pool, and 
 that the result was highly satisfactory. It remains 
 now to be seen whether its value as a fertilizer will 
 be lessened. The use of quick lime will destroy the 
 offensivencss of night soil,'but has the effect to drive off 
 the ammonia, and hence impairs its value for manur- 
 ing purposes. Whether by Mr. Peysson's method, 
 this difiiculty will be obviated, we shall learn at some 
 subsequent period, from Mr. Gowen, who has prom- 
 ised us the result as soon as ascertained. 

Mr. Roberts, appropriately remarks, that the quan- 
 tity of valuable manure that is annually "cast into 
 the sea" is immense, and if but a tithe of it were 
 saved, we might well dispense with the importation 
 of Guano — that a concentrated manure more appli- 
 cable to general purposes than Guano might be pre- 
 pared, and cheaply too, wherever a dense population 
 exists, I have not the remotest doubt, and hope a 
 practical .demonstration will soon be made. 

Newland's Mammoth Alpine Strawberry. 

We are indebted to Mr. Newland's agent in Phila- 
 delphia, Mr. T. B. Phelps, N. E. corner of Third and 
 Chesnut streets, for one hundred of these fine plants. 
 They come highly recommended and we cannot but 
 think them a very superior variety. Mr. Newland 
 says: 

"These strawberries differ from many other varie- 
 ties, viz: flavor, bearing and cultivation. The flavor 
 is much sweeter, though rich and delicious. The 
 bearing continues about two months, (most others 
 only two or three weeks,) an«l begin to ripen about 
 the first of June. The cultivation is easy, the plants 
 being hardy, and producing perfect fruit set alone, or 
 fertilised liy other varieties. With proper cultivation 
 (for which printed directions will be given) the plants 
 will Ijecome large hills in one season, and continue 
 bearing three or four years without being re-set. — 
 The season of 1849 in the city of Providence, one 
 plant, one year old, produced 2G8 ripe berries by 
 the 16th of July, and measured 28'r "inches across, 
 and one plant tliree months old produced 205 Ijcrries. 
 Some of the fruit has measured three inches in cir- 
 cumference." 

We have placed the plants in good hands and ex- 
 pect to be able to present our readers with a good 
 account of them at some future day. As many per- 
 sons think the season too far advanced to set out the 
 plants, we will state that they have been purposely 
 retarded for lute settiny, and that they have been set 
 out with great success even in tlie month of June. 

We shall take pleasure in forwarding any orders 
 to the agent for these plants.
