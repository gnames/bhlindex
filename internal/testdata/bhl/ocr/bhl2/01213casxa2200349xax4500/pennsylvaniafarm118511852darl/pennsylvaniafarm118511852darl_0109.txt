BY THE EDITOR. 

The annexed figure represents a species of the 
 genus Carahus, Tvhich is there presentative of an ex- 
 tensive family [carahiJcu) of 
 voracious insects ■which de- 
 stroy vast numbers of the 
 larvre that feed upon plants. 
 The insects of this family 
 are therefore useful to the 
 /^' f'^^^M ^ "X former and gardener, and 
 ^ 1 ^'S^ j Q^p figure will enable them 

to be recognized without 
 much difficulty. They gen- 
 erally hide themselves dur- 
 ing the day under stones and rubbish, coming forth 
 at night to seek their prey, when they frequently en- 
 ter houses attracted by the light. They run with 
 agility, their feet are slender and their jaws strong, 
 when caught they generally emit a dark liquid from 
 the mouth, and many of them have a disagreeable 
 od«r. Their size varies from that of the figure (or 
 considerably larger) to an eighth of an inch or less. 
 Calosoma scrutator is larger than the figure, of a vio- 
 let color, with the elytra of a beautiful green. We 
 translate the following valuable remarks of a French 
 observer, who has made use of the natural enemies 
 of noxious insects to destroy them. 

" A multitude of noxious insects, after having, for 
 several years committed ravages upon our property, 
 disappeared suddenly, without our being made ac- 
 quainted with the cause. In looking more closely 
 into these matters, one might be assured, in most 
 eases, an enemy of the insect which has disappeared, 
 has produced the happy result. I can furnish some 
 proofs in support of this opinion. 
 " The thick foliage of a fine avenue of poplars, was 

TOt. I — F. 

all at once attacked by an immense quantity of tha 
 caterpillars of Bombyx dispar. I thouglit of giving 
 them the Calosoma sycophanta for company: as liko 
 them, it passes its life upon the trees, feeding upon 
 the caterpillars which it meets, and even deposits its 
 eggs in their nests, that its voracious progeny can 
 procure nojjrishmcnt more easily, and in greater 
 abundance. This insect multiplied itself with a ra- 
 pidity truly astouisliing, and the caterpillars disap- 
 peared without those who were witnesses to the de- 
 struction, having the least idea of the causes whicli 
 produced it." The author then gives it as his opinion, 
 that the neighborhood of the city of Toulouse is not 
 ravaged by the Melolontha vulgaris which is so de- 
 structive in other parts of France, because the Cara- 
 bus auratus is very common in the fields, meadows, 
 and gardens. It is known, he remarks, that the Ca- 
 rabus auratus seizes and devours the Melolontha pre- 
 vious to the deposition of its eggs ; and that it is more 
 fond of these, than of any part of the insect. 

"One would be much deceived in believing that it 
 is always easy to make an advantageous use of this 
 means of destruction, a profound study of the man- 
 ners of insects, being often indispensable to arrive at 
 the end proposed. The most robust of our Carabi, 
 the Procrustes corlaceus Lin. had served me admira- 
 bly in the centre of France, to destroy the little insects 
 which attack the plants in gardens. Here (in the 
 south) this insect does not destroy the same specus; 
 and although very common, it is unknoivn, or hardly 
 ever met with. The reason is, that in the centre, the 
 west, and probably the north of France, this Procrus- 
 tes is diurnal, requiring only cool and shady places. 
 With us (in the south, under a warmer climate) it in, 
 on the contrary, essentially noctnrnal, and therefore 
 destroys such insects as are, like itself, nocturnal; or 
 which remain within its reach, during the obscuritjr 
 of night. 

" In transporting into my garden twenty of th« 
 Carabus auratus, I had thought to destroy the coUeo- 
 tions of Forficula which had chosen it for the theatre 
 of their ravages." To his great astonishment, th«
