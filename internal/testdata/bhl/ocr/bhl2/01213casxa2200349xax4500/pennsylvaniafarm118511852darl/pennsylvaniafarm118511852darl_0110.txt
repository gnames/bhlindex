Carabi, which will actually destroy the Forficula, 
 were either found starved to death, or left the place: 
 and the latter continued their devastations! The rea- 
 son o-iven is, that the Forficula are essentially noctur- 
 nal ; and during the day keep themselves hidden in 
 crevices, into which the Carabi cannot follow them. 
 These latter, too, are only active during the middle 
 of the day, and in the heat of the sun. But the re- 
 sources of this persevering entomologist wore not yet 
 exhausted; his next expedient being to introduce a 
 smaller carnivorous insect common in France, the 
 Staphyliuus olens, which, he remarks, "filled all the 
 necessary conditions for the destruction of the Forfi- 
 cula." 

" You see, then, gentlemen," says M. Boisgiraud, 
 in conclusion, " that it is indispensable to study the 
 manners and habits of destructive insects, that their 
 instinct and address may be successfully employed 
 for the destruction of the species able to do us injury. 
 Then in place of barbarously crushing the useful spe- 
 cies which have the misiortune to be not always or- 
 namented with the rich colors of the butterfly or the 
 Buprestis, wo will endeavor to protect tlfcm and pro- 
 pagate their race. We will find auxiliaries in them 
 the more valuable, as they increase with our adver- 
 saries; and as they alone are able to rival the cun- 
 ning of these ingenious enemies." 

Medical (Quackery. 

A child has recently been killed in Philadelphia 
 by the ignorance of an incompetent practitioner of 
 medicine, who in giving a prescription for castor oil 
 (oUum ricini) did not know how to spell the medical 
 name, and wrote it ol. resini. From the indistinct- 
 ness of ordinary writing, c may be taken for an o, and 
 in for m, so that the boy who gave the medicine na- 
 turally read ol. rosm. as an abbrevation of oleum ros- 
 inarini {oil of rosemary,) there being no drug known 
 as ol. resini (or resince) the oil (or spirits) of turpen- 
 tine being known under the name of ol. terehinthina:. 
 Nevertheless, as the doctor's ignorance was sufficient 
 to induce him to write ol. resini had he wanted oil 
 of turpentine, the druggist had to choose between the 
 two medicines to which the prescription came nearest, 
 but neither of which was intended, and the result has 
 been that the boy who prepared the mixture was im- 
 properly discharged for following a proscription, in- 
 stead of the doctor being indicted for homicide or 
 manslaughter, his practice under the circumstances 
 being unlaivful. 

The doctor in his testimony made use of a supposed 
 word comatious, probably meaning the common medi- 
 cal term comatose, which is another example of the 
 kind of medical education he has received, if he ever 
 received any — and if he has, it is due to the reputa- 
 tion of the respectable medical schools, that they clear 
 themselves of the stigma of having graduated him. 
 The doctor states that ho has spelt "resini" for thirty 
 years, and we are curious to know what he supposed 

was in the bottle marked OL. RICINI in the drug 
 stores; and in that marked ol. chenopodii (worm-seed 
 oil,) as he wrote the latter in English. 

We caution our readers not to employ irregular 
 practitioners, nor such as have graduated in schools 
 of questionable standing, nor to purchase advertised 
 pills, tonics, syrups, sarsaparilla, cherry pectorals 
 (like that of Ayer, which is backed by a, forged certi- 
 fcate of Professor Silliman) and mixtures made to 
 practice chiefly upon the supposed credulity of the 
 country population. Let them avoid in particular, 
 any secret medicine with accounts of wonderful cures, 
 especially when certified by venal clergymen, who 
 not only prostitute their sacred calling, but have the 
 audacity to name the church where they officiate, in 
 defiance of the decent portion of their congregations. 
 Clergymen who place D.D. after their name, are es- 
 pecial favorites with the compounders of secret medi- 
 cines, and are probably worth fifty dollars a pieco 
 more than the ordinary kind, in the certificate mar- 
 ket. 

Clerical certifiers have seen their best days, and 
 some quacks as the cure-lying Koback, will not con- 
 descend to use them, his best friend probably being 
 the mayor, who may find him a useful medium be- 
 tween thieves and the police, in the recovery of stolon 
 goods. 

Some suppose that medical names should be writ- 
 ten in English, which is an absurdity, not one-tenth 
 of them liaving English terms, as in natural history, 
 where half a dozen wevils may have them, among 
 ciglit thousand without them. English names in eith- 
 er case would add to the confusion, and it would be 
 wrong to ask thein struotcd physician and pharmace- 
 utist to lower themselves to the level of quacks and 
 homicides, and helow that of school boys and girls, 
 who, in studying botany, are not satisfied unless they 
 know the botanical name of a plant, which is always 
 in Latin. Such dictation would compel physicians 
 to compound their own medicines, as they are com- 
 pelled to do in country practice. 

The advocates of " English names to let people 
 know what they are taking," are inconsistent in be- 
 ing satisfied that any amount of advertised medicines 
 should be swallowed, the composition of which is 
 neither known nor ascertainable — and wliich may 
 vary from month to month. 

Three-cent pieces. — As the word five is the basis 
 of one of the names of a small coin, fip, three may 
 suggest that of thrip. 

At Genoa, it is said', every attorney takes an oath 
 to undertake no cause which he does not consider 
 just; and at Rome there is a society which afibrd« 
 legal aid to the poor, free of cost.
