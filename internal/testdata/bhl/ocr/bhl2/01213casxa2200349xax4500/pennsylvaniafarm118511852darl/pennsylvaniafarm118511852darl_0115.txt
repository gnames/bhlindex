and wickedness of individuals attributed to the igno- 
 rance of their mothers ? 

If, then, so much depends upon the kind of teach- 
 ings a mother is capable of imparting to her children, 
 how important does the education of the ftirmcrs' 
 daughters become, and with what solicitude sliould 
 parents endeavor to prepare them for the highly re- 
 sponsible stations of wife and mother, which they 
 may be caUed to fill ? 

Although my remarks will apply with equal force 
 to all classes of society, my olvject is, to draw the 
 special attention of the farmers to this subject, be- 
 cause 1 think it has been less seriously considered 
 by them than it deserves to be. Now-a-days, almost 
 every farmer possessed of the means, appears desirous 
 of giving his sons a liberal education. This is highly 
 commendable; but at the same time it should not be 
 forgotten that his daughters liave an equal claim upon 
 his regard. It is, with me, a question, which of the 
 two — the education of the son or the daughter — is the 
 most important. But leaving this question for the 
 present, it is enough for us to know, that the pros- 
 perity and happiness of the individual, the family 
 and the nation, demand that where it is practicable, 
 the blessings of education should be extended to all. 

Almost every farmer who has given his sons a li- 
 beral education is convinced of its utility. If eduea- 
 cation is beneficial to the son, why not to the daugh- 
 ter? Are her duties any less important than his? — 
 Has she not the moulding of the character of future 
 generations? Should not the mother be competent 
 to instruct her offspring in many of those branches 
 of education in which her gentle care and afiection 
 make her the most fitting instructor? None but 
 those who have never known the inestimable value 
 of a kind mother's teachings will dissent from this. 

But my remarks are growing too lengthy ; I shall 
 therefore conclude them for the present, promising to 
 renew the subject in future numbers of your valuable 
 Journal, should you deem them of sufficient import- 
 ance to present to your readers. Yours,

New Water Cdment. — It is said that a very strong 
 and valuable water cement has been made by Gen. 
 Pasley, of the British anny, consisting merely of four 
 parts by weight of chalk and five of blue clay. Ac- 
 cording to the experiments made to prove its strength, 
 it must possess extraordinary tenacity. 

To KEEP preserves, apply the white of an egg with 
 a suitable brush to a single thickness of white tissue 
 paper, with which cover over the jars, overlapping 
 the edges an inch or two. No tying is required. — 
 The whole will become, when dry, as tight as a drum. 

Good Advice. Do not begin farming by build- 
 ing an expensive house, nor erecting a spacious barn, 
 till you have something to store in it.

Mr. Editor: — Whoever had occasion to travel north 
 fiom Lenox, forty-fire years ago, found himself on a 
 highway, twice the width <if ours, pursuing a straight 
 line without regard to hills, and upon attaining an 
 unusual elevation within a few miles of Pittsfield, the 
 village in full sight, he might observe below him, at 
 the right, a mansion-house of some pretension, in 
 good architectural taste, in the midst of pleasant 
 grounds. Outspreading around it were well cultiva- 
 ted fields, and a little distance in the rear, one of 
 those beautifid sheets of water, three to six miles in 
 circumference, which abound in that region, and 
 from which the Ilousatonic takes its rise. It was a 
 choice spot which had been early selected by one of 
 the wealthy adjoining Knickerbockers; still retain- 
 ing the name of the Van Schack place, and if we mis- 
 take not, then oecupiod by one of that family. 

It soon after passed into the hands of Elkanah 
 Watson, who may be justly styled the father of agri- 
 cultural societies among our farmers. Pittsfield, 
 where the society was formed, which has since been 
 honored by the title of "Parent Society," was the re- 
 sidence of men distinguished in their day and gener- 
 ation. Among these were " Parson Allen," familiar- 
 ly so called, of Bennington battle memories ; a cJiap- 
 lain, fiimous alike in the desk and in the Jield — Dr. 
 Timothy Childs, eminent as a physican and politi- 
 cian, and the father of some who have since attained 
 to like eminence in the varied walks of life — Col. 
 Simon Lane, high sheriff of the county for many a 
 long year, the same who afterwards commanded the 
 "bloody ninth," so greatly distinguished at Lundy's 
 Lane, and whose son it was that every one admired 
 as a pulpit orator — Col. Joshua Danforth, postmaster 
 of Pittsfield, the father of an eminent preacher, known 
 to us all — Chandler Williams, Thomas Gold and John 
 W. Hulbert, men of marked character and great dis- 
 tinction at the bar, and as citizens. Mr. Williams, 
 a man of wealth and refined tastes, cultivated his 
 gardens and grounds to the delight of every beholder 
 — John W. Hulbert was an orator and a wit — prompt 
 at reply, ready in debate, and of never-failing moral 
 courage, he attained to celebrity in Congress among 
 the greatest men of the day — Thomas Gold occupied 
 the most beautiful situation in the most beautiful 
 town of the valley of the Ilousatonic, and amidst the 
 cares of his profession, gave great attention to agri- 
 culture and the adornment of his grounds. His sur- 
 rounding fields present themselves at this moment, to 
 our early memories, as the perfection of landscape 
 "•ardening. We may add, that it was there that one 
 of the doers of good in our own day, Nathan Apple- 
 ton of Boston, found an accomplished wife, and ad- 
 vert to Mr. Gold more emphaticallj-, because, when 
 thirty years ago, the writer found himself in Chester 
 County, surrounded by intelligent farmers, and en 
 joying a portion of their confidence, the first idea of
