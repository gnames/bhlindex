the ovipositor and thus facilitate the operation of pe- 
 netrating the bark or sap -n-ood. A more plausible 
 reason for their choosing the smaller branches and 
 Toung shoots, is to be found in the fact that they are 
 more tender and afford less resistance to the oviposi- 
 tor of the insect. ^Tho incisions in which the eggs are 
 deposited are always made in the direction of the 
 fibres of the wood and generally penetrate some depth 
 into the sap wood, thereby injuring, if not killing the 
 branches by cutting oif the supply of sap. The fluid 
 eliminated at the time of depositing the egg, may 
 possess poisonous properties tending to the same re- 
 sult. 

The grooves are made by a curious instrument 
 consisting of three pieces, tlie centre one of which is 
 fixed in the bark and remains stationary, while the 
 side pieces, which partake of the nature of the rasp 
 and saw, are alternately thrust up and down into the 
 wood in an' oblique direction, detaching small fibres 
 which afford a kind of pi-otection or covering to the 
 eggs when deposited. The eggs are deposited in 
 these grooves in pairs, obliquely, and from ton to 
 twenty eggs may usually be found in a groove. This 
 operation is repeated in the adjoining limbs until 
 four or five hundred eggs are deposited by the parent, 
 after which they soon languish and die. 

Three or four weeks after the eggs are deposited in 
 the branches, they will bo ready to hatch, and they 
 are so transparent that by means of a good glass the 
 form of the included insect can be readily seen. The 
 young insect as soon as it escapes from the egg, is 
 very lively, being about the size and possessing the 
 rapidity of motion of the smallest ant. Their instinct 
 soon prompts them to reach the ground, and running 
 to the side of the limli, they deliljerately loosen their 
 hold and let themselves fall to the ground, which, 
 owing to their inferior specific gravity, they general- 
 ly reach in safety. They at once begin to bury them- 
 selves in the earth, and in a brief space of time they 
 will be found attached to the roots of plants or trees 
 in the act of imbibing the sap, their appropriate food, 
 as discovered by Miss Margaretta II. Morris, of Ger- 
 mantown, a lady whose knowledge of entomology is 
 only equalled by her ardor in its pursuit. 

The failure of many of our fruit trees over twenty 
 years old to produce fruit, was attributed by Miss 
 Morris, to the constant drain of sap to nourish so 
 many grubs. Acting under this theory she caused 
 the earth to be removed from a pear tree that was 
 declining for many years, and the result was, to use 
 her own language, " the discovery of countless num- 
 bers adhering by their beaks to the roots, twenty- 
 three were found on one root a yard long and one inch 
 in diameter. They were found on aU the roots that 
 grew deeper than six inches below the surface. The 
 root.s were unhealthy and bore the appearance of ex- 
 ternal injury from small punctures. On removing 
 t-he outer bark this appearance increased, leaving no- 

doubt as to the cause of the disease. Tlie larvie were 
 enclosed in a compact cell of earth, with no outlet 
 except that in immediate contact with the root, and 
 as there were no galleries or holes leading from these 
 cells, I infer that the grubs never leave the roots they 
 first fasten on, which may account for the great dif- 
 ference of size, the small ones being starved speci- 
 mens of the same brood." 

On a subsequent occasion, the same lady presented 
 the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, 
 with specimens of the Cicada septendeeim that were 
 taken along with several hundred others from the 
 roots of another pear tree that was examined, leaving 
 room for the inference that many failures of a fruit 
 tree to produce a crop may justly be attrHjutod to the 
 presence of the larva of this insect. Possibly the 
 failure every other year of the crops of shellbarks and 
 chesnuts may be the result of a similar cause. These 
 insects are subject to many accidents, and have many 
 enemies, all of which tend to diminish their numbers 
 and thereby keep them in check. Hogs are very 
 fond of them, and you may see them daily turning 
 up the ground in the search for the clirysalis. Bird* 
 and poultry of all kinds destroy vast numbers of them 
 in all stages, from the egg to the perfect insect. The 
 various insectivorous animals as the skunk, possum, 
 shrews, and moles, also feed upon them. Miss Mor- 
 ris found numerous burrows made by the last men- 
 tioned animals to and from the roots of a tree con- 
 taining larvÂ« of the Cicada, most of which had dis- 
 appeared, while the roots of neighboring trees were 
 filled with the insects that the moles had not yet dis- 
 covered. The various rapacious insects also contri- 
 bute their share in the destruction of the eggs and 
 larva; soon after they are hatched. The Indiana are 
 very fond of the larvos when fried; and when the 
 disgTist which they at first excite is overcome, they 
 are esteemed quite a luxury by those who have had 
 experience in the matter. 

The males only of all the species of Cicada possess 
 the power of emitting sound. The instruments by 
 which it is produced consists of a pair of organs 
 which may be said to resemble kettle drums, one of 
 which is placed on each side of the body. These 
 drums are formed of thin convex membranes covered 
 Ijv numerous fine ribs, and are acted upon by muscles 
 fastened inside of these drums. When these muscles 
 contract or relax (which they do with great rapidity) 
 the drum heads are tightened, and loosened recover- 
 ing their natural convexity by their own elasticity. 
 The effect of this is to produce a rattling sound re- 
 sembling that caused bj' a succession of quick pres- 
 sures upon a slightly convex and elastic piece of tin. 
 The large convex valves beneath the abdomen tend to 
 increase the sound by rendering it louder. 

S.\L volatile or hartshorn will restore color taken 
 out by acids. It may be dropped on the silk without 
 doing any injury.
