THE HORSE. 

Ill 

Bions, proportiouate -with other parts; no joint, in 
 fact, is too large, providing the bony prominences 
 be distinctly seen with the naked eye, and its liga- 
 ments perceptible under our fingers. I need not, 
 therefore, farther enforce this truth in speaking of 
 these organs. Knuckling over in the fetlocks is a 
 sign of original malformation, such as uprightness in 
 the pasterns, or else is the result of hard work; and 
 the tottering atfection of the limb, accompanying this 
 state, is caused by local debility and excessive irrita- 
 bility in the nervous system. The pasterns always 
 deserve much of our attention ; wlien good, their 
 length is proportionate with that of other parts, and 
 they incline, with much obliquity, downward and 
 forward to the foot, should thoy approach the perpen- 
 dicular, they are almost always short, and are said to 
 be straight or upright ; but when they approximate 
 to the horizontal, they are long, and called, though 
 erroneously, oblique ; for they are not so obliquely 
 placed, under these circumstances, with regard to the 
 leg, as they are when properly constructed. Perhaps 
 no part of thcvhorse exhibits the wisdom of nature 
 more, in regard to the adaptation of it, in point of 
 structure, to the purpose for which the animal was 
 designed, than this: in the racer, for example, the 
 pasterns are lengthy, and incline to right angles with 
 the legs, whereby more weight is imposed upon the 
 hinder parts of the fetlock and hoof, in which situa- 
 tions are placed pieces of mechanism which by their 
 elasticity serve as so many springs in diminishing 
 the eSects of concussion so requisite in this animal, 
 which was intended to perform swift and sudden 
 movements; but in the cart-horse, whoso action is 
 slow and powerful, the pasterns are short and nearlj' 
 upright, so that most of the weight is thrown upon 
 the main bones of the foot, and thereby his springs, 
 which have less play than the Arabian or thorough- 
 bred, are not so much acted upon ; consequently less 
 provision is made against concussion, for strength, 
 and not elasticity, is sought for in the construction 
 of this powerful animal. Horses with very oblique 
 pasterns are more likely to break down, and for this 
 reason they ought never to be shod with thin-healed 
 shoes : on the other hand, if they are very short and 
 upright in these joints;, they are seldom or never sure- 
 footed, and will soon become stilty and groggy from 
 work. 

The hoof next engages our notice, and this is a 
 part of which we should be more than commonly 
 scrupulous and nice in our inspection: " Xo foot, no 
 horse," is a trite but very true adage, and one that is 
 not kept sufficiently in view by the purchasers of 
 horses, or they would not have so frequently to la- 
 ment their hard fate in having gone to market for a 
 screw. First, we .should look to the size of the hoof: 
 a small foot is not only objectionable in itself, even 
 though it be a natural formation, but is often a cha- 
 racteristic of disease; but a small and upright foot is 
 a morbid structure, and is scarcely over seen in any 
 one but a dancing-master, or light-timbered tit. â€” 
 White hoofs are to be eyed with suspicion ; they are 
 really weaker, and more liable to disease than dark 
 or black ones, and if a horse has one white and the 
 other dark-colored, and ho is lame, in nine cases out 
 of ten it is the white foot that is affected. So much 
 with regard to the foot before it is taken up. Other 
 considerations now engross our attention. Is it 
 contracted? i. e. is its circularity destroyed by nar- 
 rowness at the heels ? A good hoof is circular in the 
 tread, or nearly eo, measuring as much from side to 
 side as from toe to heel; but we frequently find those 
 tliat are morbid measuring as much from toe to heel 
 as twice the lateral diameter. On the other hand, the 

wall of the hoof which should, at all times, be per- 
 fectly smooth and free from ridges, (the contrary in- 
 dicating disease,) may bo very oblique, in which case 
 it is not only circular, but spreads out, even to a 
 morbid degree, in the tread. Large, heavy horses, 
 such as are bred in low, marshy situations, are most 
 subject to have this kind of foot, in which parts of 
 the country it is preferred by many people, who con- 
 tend that their hunters derive advantage from it. As 
 the strong and upright foot is likely to become con- 
 tracted, so is this subject to a disease called fleshy 
 soles ; indeed, in the former, the sole is concave ; but 
 in the latter it is fiat, on which account the two re- 
 quire different modes of shoeing. 

The body, or carcass, may bo subdivided into the 
 chest, belly, and loins. So far as reganls the consti- 
 tution of the horse, his stamina, or his bottom, no 
 part is of more consequence than the chest; but, like 
 that of many other parts, no particular construction 
 of it is the best for all kinds of horses. That of tho 
 cart-horse should be circular, broad in the bosom, and 
 large in the girth ; that of tho thorough-bred more 
 circumscribed, but not flat-sided, very deep, and also 
 extensive in tho girth; so that the two differ more 
 in width than in depth. Had the racer possessed a 
 broad, circular chest, his shoulders must have been 
 thick, and his fore legs far apart; and no horse so 
 made can gallop well or fast, though many such are 
 ridden as hackneys; they are apt to have a rolling 
 gait, and an awkward mode of going altogether, per- 
 ceptible at all times to the connaisseur in horse-flesh ; 
 but we must be careful, even in choosing racers, not 
 to run into the other extreme ; for, if both legs come 
 out of one hole, or he be flat-sided, he cannot endure 
 much fatigue, is very probably a bad feeder, and cer- 
 tainly predisposed to disease of the chest. A full 
 and prominent bosom is a fine point; and the ribs 
 should stand out with sufficient curve to aflbrd space 
 enough within ; for which reason, some, as we before 
 remarked, prefer a thickish shoulder, if it be an obli- 
 que one; and another advantage accompanying such 
 conformation is, that we have something between our 
 legs when mounted, a property, certainly, that every 
 horse ought to possess. As to the belly, its shape 
 will depend much upon that of the chest and loins. 
 A narrow-carcassed horse can never do much work, 
 readily loses his condition, and with difficulty recov- 
 ers it, being very commonly, but a queer feeder. We 
 should have something to kick against, and unless ho 
 carries his dinner with him, his bread-basket cannot 
 be said to be of the best description. 

The back should be perfectly straight; a hollow 
 back is a sign-of want of strength ; but it is often ex- 
 tremely pleasant to the rider. A roach-back, the re- 
 verse of a hollow back, is by no moans handsome, 
 though some argue that horses having such are 
 stronger; one objection to it is that it is apt to chafo 
 from the saddle. The loins are a point that we should 
 always be nice about. A hollow back and a narrow 
 loin are generally indicative of natural weakness; but 
 the latter is far more exceptionable than the former : 
 a horse so formed can seldom carry much weight, 
 soon knocks up, and often proves a bad feeder; his 
 constant hollowness in the flank, and his lank appear- 
 ance altogether, after a day's hunting, demonstrate 
 how incapable ho is of bearing the exertions required 
 of him.

IIoRSB collars filled with air instead of hay have 
 been invented by T. M. Coleman, of Penn.sylvania. 
 They will not chafe the horse like those now in use.
