AVe have for years coutondetl, that the fruits grown 
 in Lancaster city and county would compare favora- 
 bly with those of any other section of the State. In 
 this opinion we were supported by a few, but the ma- 
 jority was against us. To satisfy others, wo called 
 upon several of our citizens — Dr. Parry, M. Ehrman, 
 and Emanuel W. Carpenter — and procured from each 
 specimens of the different varieties of cherries grown 
 by them. These were carefully boxed up and sent 
 to Dr. William Brincklc, chairman of the fruit com- 
 mittee of the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society. — 
 We give below the Dr.'s acknowledgment of the re- 
 ceipt of the cherries, and s'omo observations upon 
 them, to which we invite the attention of those who 
 were skeptical in regard to the high character of the 
 fruits grown in the vicinity of Lancaster. Such com- 
 mendation, from so high a source, is certainly gratifv. 
 ing and wo trust that others who cultivate fine fruits 
 will give us an opportunity of placing them before 
 the committee over which Dr. B. presides, in order 
 that our Lancaster horticulturists may assume their 
 proper position amongst their brethren elsewhere. 
 Our candid impression is, that the fruits of almost 
 every kind grown in this neighborhood are equal in 
 every particular and superior in many, to any others 
 grown in the State. For proof of this, we invite all 
 to attend the exhibition which is to be held some time 
 during the coming fall. 

PuiLADELPHiA, June 10, 1851. 

Ml/ Dear Sir — Your esteemed favor without date, 
 accompanying a bos of most magnificent cherries was 
 received this afternoon. Please to accept my warm 
 acknowledgements for your kind attention. 

Your cherries are something to boast of and evince 
 the fine progress you are making in Horticulture in 
 Lancaster. One of the cherries, " the Cumberland 
 seedling," is quite new to nie. I presume it is the 
 same that is called the " triumph of Cumberland," at 
 Carlisle, of which Mr. David Miller sent me buds last 
 summer, with a description of the fruit. 

The " yellow Gr.aflon" is the Bigarreauor Graffion 
 ^the Amber of Coxe; under the last name it is 
 usually known here, and took the first premium at 
 our Horticultural meeting on Tuesday evening last. 

The Napoleon Bigarreau is correctly named, and 
 the specimens truly splendid. 

The " Doubtful " looks very much like the Black 
 Tartarian, and cannot, from its external appearance, 
 be distinguished from the Cumberland. But Mr. 

Miller informs mo that the trees of the Triumph of 
 Cumberland and the Black Tartarean are essentially 
 different in their growth. 

The f)ur remaining varieties I think are all the 
 same variety— the English morello, and the finest spe- 
 cimens I have ever seen. lias there not been a mis- 
 take in the May Duke? The Kentish is a small 
 cherry, and is known here as the Early Richmond. 

I have not yet tasted any of the cherries, as I wish 
 our fruit committee to see them. 

Nine or ten varieties of my now raspberries are 
 now ripe— they are very large and fine, could not 
 you, Jlr. Carpenter, Dr. Parry, and Jlr. Ehrman, 
 make a flying visit to Philadelphia to sec them ? 
 Very truly youi's, 

"W. D. Brin-ckle. 

Chester Co. Horticultural & Industrial ExhibitioD, 

Held at West Chester on the Vlih, Vith and 14th insi. 

Mr. Editor: — This exhibition came off, on the 
 above days, and, to an observer visiting the borough, 
 evinced a rather extraordinary amount of go-ahead- 
 itiveness on the part of the citizens of West Chester, 
 and the county, and was encouraging to adjoining 
 counties to go and do likewise. Here was a Horti- 
 cultural Society, established but a few years since, 
 which had built for itself a capacious hall, (said to 
 be the second one only in the country built especially 
 for horticultural purposes,) and holding besides re- 
 gular monthly meetings, two semi-annual exhibitions 
 attended by some thousands of people. 

It was calculated that the number of visitors on 
 the last day of the exhibition was from two to three 
 thousand. 

The printed schedule of premiums for this season 
 of the year, is not confined to horticultural objects, 
 but embraces all kinds of manufactures made in the 
 countj', such as .agricultural implements, coach and 
 harness work, dentistry, cabinet work, every variety 
 of mechanical ingenuit)', and articles for domestic 
 use, needle work and embroidery, &c. All classes of 
 the community are thus interested, which accounts 
 for the very large attendance and interest manifested. 

The numerous boquets and floral embellishments, 
 and the large display of green house plants, roses, 
 verbenas, &c., from the two nurseries of the borough, 
 occupied considerable space in the hall and attracted 
 much attention. One of the nursery firms, that of 
 Pasohall Morris & Co. have connected with their es- 
 tablishment a large agricultural and horticultural 
 warehouse, and displayed on this occasion a large 
 assortment of implements for the farmer and garden- 
 er, including the new improved patterns of ploughs, 
 harrows, wheat and other drills, horse rakes, com 
 shellers, &c. This establishment promises to be of 
 great use to the farmers of Chester and adjoining 
 counties. Obseryek. 

Don't delay the cutting of your grain until it is 
 dead ripe. As soon as the strjiw immediately be- 
 neath the head becomes yellow, then commence your 
 harvest.
