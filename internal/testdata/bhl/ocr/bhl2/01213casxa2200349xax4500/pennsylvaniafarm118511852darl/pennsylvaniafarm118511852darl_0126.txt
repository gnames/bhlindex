Dwarf Pear Trees. 

Mr. Editor: — So much has i-eoently been fuhlish- 
 ed about the advantage, economy, and beauty of 
 dwarf trees, pear, apple, and cherry, that one might 
 fancy every six feet square, in certain regions, teem- 
 ing with golden Bourre's, golden Rinett's and sweet 
 Montmorcncies. 

You, Mr. Editor, have ever been ready to expose 
 Immbug in other departments ; and I hope, as head 
 iif our Farm .Journal you will assist us in arriving at 
 agricultural and horticultural truth. 

Is it not unfortunate, that unsuccessful experiments 
 are not more frequently recorded ? 

If want of success in the following experiment, be 
 owing to the bungling manner of its performance, the 
 deception of others, or inherent, let us try to get at 
 the truth. 

Five years since a number of pear buds were in- 
 serted on common orange quince stalks. The nest 
 season they grew from three to five feet. The follow- 
 ing spring transplanted and headed back. They have 
 all died since without producing fruit. Aljout that 
 time much discussion arose as to the variety of quince 
 best adapted for stalks. A majority seemed to decide 
 the Portugal. One thousand of these were ordered 
 by the worthy President of your society, {Mr. Frantz,) 
 from Elhvangor & Barry, of which, as a novice, I 
 procured one hundred. (They proved not to be Por- 
 tugal.) These were planted in the autumn of 1848, 
 grew finely the next season, and were budd )d. Last 
 season they grew from two to four feet well branched. 
 This season, without removal they were mostly head- 
 ed in. Their leaves expanded and soon they com- 
 menced to bloom ? No ! But die. Now two-thirds 

are entirely dead, and still they die. So much for 
 my experiment. Let me add something from obsei-- 
 vation and the experience of others. By the way, I 
 most sincerely hope the gentleman before alluded to, 
 will let us have the benefit of his extensive experi- 
 ment, with his hundreds: and the ricli crops obtained 
 from the Jargc trees purchased at a dollar per piece 
 from Prince & Co. 

A short time since, I had the pleasure of a walk in 
 (lie gardens of one of our most enthusiastic practical 
 amateurs, whose vegetable, fruit, and floral depart- 
 ments, arc mi fait. Ilis dwarf pear trees were eight 
 to ten feet high, well branched, and cultivated with 
 the greatest care. My inquiry for fruit of the pro- 
 prietor. Dr. Thomas, was answered — " Humbug ! 
 They have been nursed for half a dozen years and 
 Hcaroely produced as many good pears!" 

That pear trees on quince roots do in some in- 
 stances and situations, or on some varieties of quince, 
 succeed well, and are very productive, we have abun- 
 dant evidence of the highest character. 

Such men as Perkins and Wilder who speak of 
 gathering barrels of the finest pears from dwarf trees, 
 are beyond suspicion. That we, in this section of 

the State will be equally successful is considered very 
 doubtful by others than your bungling experimenter.

[Will our friend Frantz comply with the request 
 of our correspondent, aud favor us with the result of 
 his experiment? We hope he will, and at the same 
 time we shall be glad to hear from others who have 
 attempte 1 to cultivate the pear tree on the quince 
 stalk, whether successful or otherwise. — Ed.]

THE FRUITS OF THE SEASON. 

Louisa. — Oh, come and see my strawberries first, 
 uncle. They are not so fine as Edwin's, and I want 
 you to tell me why. 

Uncle Pliilip. — Edwin's plants are, certainly, the 
 most luxuriant and the most productive. 

Louisa. — Yet they are the same varieties, planted, 
 too, on the same day, in the same garden. Edwin 
 divided with me those fine plants of new sorts which 
 you sent us last August, and we each took a share 
 of the staminates, necessary, you said, to secure pro- 
 ductiveness. 

Uncle. — Was the soil of the beds In like condition? 

Ednnn.—^ma was. an onion bed from which we 
 had just taken the crop. It was very mellow; it had 
 been covered with very rotten chipdirt in the spring. 
 I merely dug the ground and sot out the plants in the 
 manner you directed. John dug her bed well, and 
 put in plenty of manure from the horse-stable. 

Uncle. — Here lies a difference. Plants do not like 
 rail) food, it must bo decomposed. Edwin's was well 
 cooked or composted, while yours, Louisa, was too 
 rank. Did your plants become yellow ? 

Louisa. — Yes, they did, while Edwin's were beau- 
 tifully green and flourishing. But ho manured his 
 in October or November. 

Edwin. — Yes, I heard uncle speak of that last year, 
 and I wrote a mcmor.andum of it in my pocket book. 
 See, here it is : in "October. Now strawberry bed^ 
 should manured and dressed." 

Louisa. — ^But why did not that manure injure Ed- 
 win's? 

Uncle. — At that time growth had nearly ceased, 
 and the small amount taken up by the roots during 
 winter was invigorating, while tlie straw served to 
 protect the tops. 

Louisa. — So, I see that in order to excel in grow- 
 ing strawberries I must not wait till spring to make 
 preparations. 

Edioin. — Father explained to me this morning 
 what is meant by " fallowing ^" the principle seems 
 in part the same. Our teams are now busy preparing 
 land for seeding nest fall, consequently for next 
 year's growth of grain. 

Louisa. — Edwin's note-book, too, lias proved of 
 service. I must record what I have learned now, 
 and next year at the proper season it will occur to
