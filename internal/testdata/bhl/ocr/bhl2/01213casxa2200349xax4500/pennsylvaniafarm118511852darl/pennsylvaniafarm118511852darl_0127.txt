me, and I shall avoid so much of error. When cou- 
 sins came the other day to see us, I could scarcely 
 give them a berry, -while Edwin supplied them with 
 as many as they could cat from one or two hills, and 
 such splendid fruit, too. I was ready to blame Pro- 
 vidence for partiality, for I did not think that I had 
 injured my plants myself by injudicious kindness. — 
 Now I see tliat error too. As I become a better gar- 
 dener I .shall become a better girl. I see the force 
 of the saying, that the tiller of the soil is a co-worker 
 ■with the Almighty. 

Uncle. — Courage and faith, Louisa, are noble attri- 
 butes which you seem to possess. Come and eat 
 some pears from my trees until these become strong 
 enough to bear perfect fruit. 

J^ Louisa. — Thank you, uncle, yet I shall look for- 
 ward with desire for the fruit from the trees I have 
 tended. One eats it with such relish, to say nothing 
 of the pleasure of sharing it with friends. It occurs 
 to me now that I have seen directions to pinch off 
 buds of roses, alpine strawberries and raspberries in 
 spring when it is desired to liave a crop in autumn. 

Ediciii. — Is your plum-garden still safe ? Cousin 
 Henry complains that the cureulio has stung his 
 plums in spite of pigs and poultry. He has hi.s plum- 
 yard enclosed and has kept a number of pickers and 
 grazers constantly engaged in it since early spring. 

Un^. — He will not see the full result of this sim- 
 ple d||t excellent plan until after one season. 

Louisa. — There is a fine shower coming; it will 
 swell up your Hoveys and Hudsons to their full size. 
 If you will pick some, Edwin, I will gather some of 
 these nice White Hearts and Eltons ; their fair com- 
 plexions will contrast finely with your red strawber- 
 ries. There seems no bound to the enjoyments we 
 derive from horticulture, and they are so varied that 
 it is impossible to tire of one object before another 
 attracts attention. We have become acquainted with 
 many curious insects and birds, even every change 
 of the weather is a source of interest. Do not these 
 shi'ubs and flowers show well on that .smooth close 
 grass. Edwin mowed it three times for me this 
 spring, and see how neatly he has trimmed the hedge. 
 I suppose he wished to console me for the loss of my 
 strawberry crop. 

Uncle. — Your bed may be the strongest nest sea- 
 son, as it is not exhausted by fruiting. W.

To COOK THE PIE' PLANT. — Much of the usefulness 
 of this pleasant vegetable is frequently lost from the 
 waste of time in cooking it. Many people suppose 
 every stalk is to be skinned or peeled before it is fit 
 to be used. This is all thrown away labor. The 
 stalks are not a whit better after being peeled than 
 before. All that is necessary is to cut them in slices 
 and proceed as usual. 

Proceedings of tlic Penusylvauia Horticultural So- 
 ciety. 

The stated meeting of this association was held as 
 usual in the Chinese Saloon, on Tuesday evening, 
 June ITth. The President in the Chair. The dis- 
 play was very fair for a summer month, when green 
 house plants generally are out of lilocim and but lit- 
 tle fruit matured. The Hall was crowded with 
 visitors. 

Of the object.s shovrn, those only of interest will 
 be noticed. In Eobert Buist'.s collection of plants 
 were Ja.^miimin tenuifolium of recent introduction, 
 and shiiwn fur the first time, a beautiful delicate spe- 
 cies of that favorite genus — two Seedling Gloxinias, 
 superlj — No. 1, flowers of a delicate blush with ,t, 
 white throat. — No. 2, Scarlet, throat white edged with 
 crimson — MaynoUa JSxmoziihie,a dwarf plant bearing 
 very large flowers — ten choice Pdaroonia, as many 
 select Gloxinias and a variety of other plants. Jas?. 
 Dundas' gardener exhilated three plants of Ccrcus 
 (irandiftorus or night blooming Cereus, each bearing 
 expanded flowers — Lilies, Gloxinias, etc. Thomas 
 Meohan, gardener to A. M. Eastwick (Bartram's 
 garden) sent fine seedling Calcolurias, beautiful 
 Gloxinias, Fuchsias and other plants with three spe- 
 cimens of Chrysanthemums in flower, which he by 
 management has bloomed in the summer season, — 
 the mode of culture by which he effected this result, 
 he detailed to the Society in an interesting commimi- 
 cation. 

On the fruit tables were six pots of Grape vines, 
 grown from single eyes, one year old, in full bearing, 
 from the houses of C. Cope (president), of the Black 
 Hamburg, white and Grizzly Frontignac, white Con- 
 stantia, white Sweet Water and Lashmere's seedling 
 varieties, forming an attractive spectacle : from the 
 same source was a very large specimen of La Mer- 
 cier Cherry. Dr. Brinckl6 cxhiljited fine specimens 
 of nine varieties of his new Raspberries, several 
 of which were of great merit. Isaac B. Baxter— the 
 Col. Wilder (Brinckle's) Raspberries ; large Goose- 
 berries, and Cherries of Guigne noir, June duke and 
 Portugal varieties. John R. Brinckle presented a 
 beautiful display of Cherries of the following kinds 
 — Amber, Bigarreau gros Coeuret, Black Tartarian, 
 Barr's Seedling, Downton, Napoleon Bigarreau, Rcinc 
 Hortense and a Seedling. By Geo. W. Earl, fine 
 Amber Cherries ; Black Eagle and Tartarian, by 
 Thos. Meehan ; and a number of varieties, by John 
 Perkins. Anthony Felton, Jr., exhibited a fine spe- 
 cimen of Ilovey's Seedling Strawberry ; and James 
 Powell presented five Seedling varieties of Raspber- 
 ries. There were four extensive tables well spread 
 with fine vegetables.
