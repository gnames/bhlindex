Observations on ilie Culture of Chri/sant7icnninis, 
 with the object of obtaining bloom from them in the 
 Summer months : 

Sir: In the regulations of the Society, it is sug- 
 gested that where the mode of cultivating any fruit 
 or flower exhibited before the Society is peculiar, a 
 few short observations accompanying it would be de- 
 sirable. In the collection of flowering plants which 
 I have exhibited this evening are some Chrysanthe- 
 mums in bloom. As I have never succeeded before 
 in any experiment to induce this plant to flower out 
 of its usual season, and as within my knowledge no 
 such experiment has ever succeeded before, I beg to 
 lay before you the details of the treatment which has 
 effected this result. When I first took charge of this 
 establishment, last 3'ear, and after I had attended to 
 matters of more immediate importance, it was too 
 late in the season to raise a stock of Chrysanthe- 
 mums by the usual means of slips or cuttings. I had 
 one strong plant of the variety triumphans in the 
 open border, and had its flower stems laid down into 
 10 inch pots, when well rotted these layers were ta- 
 ken off, and the treatment given to them which 
 Chrysanthemums usually get. They bloomed better 
 than plants which I had on other occasions raised 
 from cuttings in the usual way. This produc- 
 tiveness of bloom in the layered plant, suggested its 
 fitness for an experiment on flowering them again ac- 
 cordingly as soon as the flowers were fairly faded. I 
 cut down six plants, reduced the balls, and replaced 
 them in fresh earth in smaller pots. Thoy were then 
 placed in a cool part of a green-house and their 
 shoots suffered to grow up without any pinching 
 back. In May they began to show their second crop 
 of buds, when they were again repotted and soon af- 
 ter flowered. 

It will be observed that the flowers on each plant 
 are not so numerous as we generally see them in the 
 fall. Had the success of the experiment been antici- 
 pated, and consequently more attention been paid to 
 reporting and high cultivation this defect would not 
 exist. 

As it is said that in " a multitude of counsellors 
 there is wisdom " so in practical gardening a multi- 
 tude of experiments reveal new truths, and this com- 
 munication is made in the hope that others may be 
 induced by the partial success of this almost random 
 experiment to try what improvements can be made 
 upon it. I am, sir, yours most respectfully, 

Thomas Meehan. 

A letter of acknowledgment from Prof. S. S. Hal- 
 deman in reply to a notification from the correspond-
