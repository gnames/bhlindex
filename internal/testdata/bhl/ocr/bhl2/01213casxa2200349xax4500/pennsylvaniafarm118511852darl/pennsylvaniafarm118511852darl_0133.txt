Enterprise of English and American Farmers. 

The New -Jersey Medical Reporter refers to the dis- 
 covery at Hurdstown, Morris county, by Dr. Jackson 
 of Boston, of a rich bed containing 92 4-10 per cent. 
 of pure phosphate of lime, yielding 46} per cent, of 
 ph jsphorio acid and 20 per cent, of phosphorous. 

In connection with the above we learned a few 
 days ago that not an ounce of this valuable fertilizer 
 has been applied to American soil ; but that ship load 
 after ship load has been sent to England to enrich 
 her lands. Is not this a fact that should arouse our 
 farmers to a true sense of the value of -these phos- 
 phates? The English agi'iculturists understand and 
 fully appreciate them, as is evidenced by the fact 
 above mentioned. 

From the same source we learned that almost eve- 
 ry bone gatherer in our large cities, is an agent of 
 some English company, and it is next to an impossi- 
 bility to procure a ton of bones for any consideration, 
 this side of the Atlantic. Bones for the English 
 market have been gathered from the very interior of 
 our State and sent to Philadelphia by canal. And 
 now a ((ucstion of deep importance suggests itself. — 
 If the phosphates of New Jersey and the bones gath- 
 ered in various parts of the United States, can be 
 shipped to England, a distance of three thousand 
 miles, and yet be considered highly profitable fertil- 
 izers, should not American formers avail themselves 
 of the opportunity aiforded them of enriching their 
 lands, when the material in abundance is at their 
 very doors ? We pause for a reply. 

A voice from the West. 

Although not written for publication, we take the 
 liberty of making a few extracts from a letter vrritton 
 to the Editor by Dr. John C. Kennicott, of The 
 Grove, Northfield, Illinois. It will be remembered 
 that Dr. K. is one of the ablest friends of agriculture 
 in the West, and commendation from such a source 
 is certainly flattering: 

Editor of the Farm Journal — Dear Sir — I thank 
 you for the three numlfcrs of your new Pennsylvania 
 paper, and assure you, that I feel the compliment 
 contained in your request. But sir, I am an unlet- 
 tered farmer — born in a log house, and sooth to say, 
 occupy one yet, notwithstanding the M. D. attached 
 to my name. That title came by chance, and neces- 
 sity, rather than choice, — and yet I am not a little 
 proud of it; for medical men are taking an honorable 
 lead in the art and science of modern agriculture, 
 and especially horticulture. This is the natural con- 
 sequence of their love of all the works of nature, and 
 their especial studj- — the laws of vitality. 

Up to the present day, if a poor young farmer felt a 
 desire to enquire into the operations of nature, and to 
 gather some available notions of science, (which 
 ought to be as familiar to all who own farms, as the 
 history and principles of our religion to those en- 
 gaged in its ministry, ) there was no source, so acces- 
 sible to his means as medical colleges. ■ Success to 
 "the schools of medicine;" and may many of the 
 principles taught therein, soon find their way to the 
 "public schools" of the country. 

To say that I am pleased with these specimens of 
 your new enterprise, in an old field, would be saying 
 too little — I am more than pleased — I am gratified 
 and encouraged — I like the tone and character of 
 your journal. It may be only that it is fresher, and 
 therefore makes a newer impression ; but to my mind, 
 there certainly appears to be a straight-forward bold- 
 ness — full of truth and meaning — on subjects con- 
 necting the progress of agriculture with the stand-still 
 policy of legislation — a very little ahead of some of 
 the old agricultural papers — and among your corres- 
 pondents I recognise some of the most reliable pens 
 in the country. God speed you. 

The Keystone State has been rather tardy in es- 
 taljlishing a permanent agricultural journal ; but you 
 seem determined to make ample amends for the de- 
 lay, by going strait to the root of the matter at once, 
 and advocating the only true, liberal and legitimate 
 plan, promising certain, permanent and universal 
 results, commensurate to cur necessities and our d3- 
 sires. 

General and particular agricultural organization, 
 and specific and universal agricultural education, are 
 the true points on which hinge the perfection of agri- 
 culture as a science, and the intellectual elevation, 
 general prosperity and happiness, conventional stand- 
 ing and political influence of over " three-fourths of 
 the people" of this great nation.
