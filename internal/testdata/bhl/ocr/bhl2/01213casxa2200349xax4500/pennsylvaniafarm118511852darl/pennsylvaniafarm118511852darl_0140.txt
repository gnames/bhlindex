 be insensible to common gratitude, if they failed to express their 
 prolound acknowledgments tor the constant and increasing de-

"Wc keep constantly on hand this valuable manure. Bones, 
 with a proper portion ot the l?ulphate of Ammoni.a, dis.'^olved in 
 Sulphuric Acid. The Chemists nf this country and Europe have 
 been pressing this mode of using hone-dust upon the atten- 
 tion of farmers, with great zeal and abilify of recent years. Ev- 
 ery experiment lias confirmed the truthfulness of their theory; 
 end we hazard liut little in saying that in a very brief time it

COMBINATION OF GROUND PLASTER AND 
 POTASH. 

This is a preparation made for soil deficient in Potash, of which 
 deficiency there is. unfortunately, too many instances in much of 
 our Maryland laud. For this compound we are indebted to the 
 Buggestion of an accomplished Agriculturist of Prince George's 
 county, who may at some future day present the result of hia ex- 
 periment. The price of this is !f 2 60 per barret. 

DIRECTIONS. 

The mode of using the Kenovatnr is simple, inexpen-oive, and 
 requiring but little labor. The farmer must bear in mind, that 
 in the preparation of his soil he shares an equal responsibility in 
 testing the merits of any manure. Lnud negligently or badly 
 euUivated gives no manure a fair chance. How to put laud in or- 
 der he ought to know better than we can teach liim; and if he 
 don't know, should Uarn as speedily as possilde. The land, then, 
 in order— if one barrel to the acre is used— and this quantity de- 
 pends upon the quality of the land— it should, for grain bo sown 
 broad cast, and slightly harrowed in. 

If two barrels are used, one as stated above, and the other afl a 
 top-dressiDg upon the wheat or rye, enrly in the spring at the 
 commencomont of the first thaw. Upon grass it should be sown 
 broad-cast upon the timothy or clover. Un corn, either broad- 
 east or in the hill. Where two barrels are used, one each way
