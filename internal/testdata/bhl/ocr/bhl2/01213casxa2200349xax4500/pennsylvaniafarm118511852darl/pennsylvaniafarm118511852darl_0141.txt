Eriosoma lanigera — (by some named Friosoma 
 malt.) — This destructive enemy of apple trees is 
 known as the American hUijlit in England, where it 
 is believed to be of American origin — erroneouslv in 
 the opinion of Dr. Harris (Noxious Insects, p. 193). 
 From its numbers, and the extent to which it is 
 spread, in Europe, that seems more likely to be its 
 native country. Here it is still comparatively rare, 
 and Dr. Harris having seldom seen it in Massachu- 
 setts. 

The generic name Erisomu raaa-az xooolh/ body, and 
 the trivial name lanigera means tcool-beariiig, the in- 
 sect having been considered an Aphis by Hausman, 
 a German observer, who named it Aphis lanigera in 
 1801. Plot, a French observer, gave it, in 1830, the 
 French name of Mi/zoxyle du pommier, 
 the first name moaning wood sucker, and 
 the last of the apple tree, and some au- 
 thors have attempted to give a latinised 
 form of this priority over the regular 
 scientific name of Eriosoma. 

Apple trees may be entirely destroyed 
 by this insect, and its progress is so gra- 
 dual and its presence so likely to be un- 
 observed, that it may be .pretty widely 
 spread before the cultivator is aware of 
 its presence. 

The small and more tender branches 
 of the tree are chiefly attacked, present- 
 ing unsightly wounds, as if the bark had 
 been cut off in spots or strips, and grown 
 over and partly or entirely healed, whilst 
 twigs will be bent and distorted. An 
 examination will disclose little white 
 masses apparently of wool, cotton, or 
 Fig.l. cobweb, as in Pig. 1, which represents

an infected branch from one of our own trees. If 
 the woolly mass is examined, it wiU be found to arise 
 from the body of a colony of small oval wingless in- 
 sects less than the tenth of an 
 inch long, with younger indivi. 
 duals down to one-fiftieth of an 
 inch in length. Fi.f/. 2, is a 
 magnified view of the insect, 
 with an antenna and the ros- 
 trum on the right. The natural 
 P,„. color of the insect is reddish, 

with the segments distinct, the antenniB are short and 
 generally inclined outwards and backwards, the feet 
 weak and slender, and the rostrum more than half 
 the length of the body, apparently three jointed, and 
 adapted for piercing the bark. i 

The young individuals have but little wool, but it 
 grows with its growth, especially upon the posterior 
 part of the body, so that they are finally entirely 
 covered with it, a colony presenting nothing but a 
 mass of wool, which is often half an inch thick. — 
 They are sjuggish in their motions, young and old 
 generally remaining quietly attached to the place 
 upon which they are located, with their rostrum 
 stvick in the bark. 

These insects are easily wafted upon their downy 
 covering from tree to tree by the wind. Some ob- 
 servers say that they never acquire wings, whilst 
 Plot, already alluded to, says that the males have 
 them. These are found in autumn, and are smaller 
 than the females. 

When the Eriosoma gets old, it loses most of its 
 down and gets a more sombre color. Dead ones of a 
 black color are frequently found fastened to the 
 branches, and in many cases a small perforation may 
 be seen upon the upper surface of the posterior ex- 
 tremity, which has given exit to a small parasitic 
 enemy which destroys a great many of them. Not 
 having met with a description of this parasite, we 
 propose to name it EriopMhts malt. The Eriosoma 
 is also devoured by the larva of a species of fly of the 
 genus Syrphus, which also attacks aphides.
