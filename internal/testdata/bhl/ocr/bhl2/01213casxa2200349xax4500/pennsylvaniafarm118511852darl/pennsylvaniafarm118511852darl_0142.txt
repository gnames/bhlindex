In Europe apple trees are sometimes so full of this 
 insect as to present the appearance of being covered 
 with cotton, anil in such a case nothing can 1)0 clone 
 to save them, so tliat they had better be cut down 
 and burnt, and if a whole orchard is thus affected, it 
 ghould be sacrificed, and a new one planted at a dif- 
 ferent place, ill a dry and airy location, care being 
 taken to examine the young trees from time to time, 
 to detect the first appearance of the insect, when they 
 may be crushed with the hand, which is our own 
 practice. 

When the number of affected places is considera- 
 ble, they may be rubbed with a hard brush, or wash 
 ed with oil, white-wash, soft soap, tobacco water, oil 
 of turpentine, lye, or potash water, the old bark being 
 first removed, as well as suckers and small branches 
 which have been attacked. As the insect descends 
 to the roots, the treatment adopted must extend to 
 these, the earth around the base of the trunk being 
 removed for the purpose, and the cavity afterwards 
 filled with sand. 

M. Plot recommends grafting upon stocks of harsh 
 and bitter kinds of apple, as the insect is apt to avoid 
 these for the trunks of the sweeter kinds — to give the 
 trees as little shelter as possible — to allow considera- 
 ble space between them — to keep the branches thinned 
 by pruning — and to allow neither grass nor suckers 
 about the trunk. 

Trogus fulvus. — This hymenopterous insect is the 
 size of the figure, of a fulvous or fox color, except the 

antennae and wings, 
 which are black. It 
 appears in Pennsylva- 
 nia in May and .June, 
 and belongs to the fa- 
 mily of Ichneumonidaa 
 being closely allied to 
 Ichneumon. All the 
 members of this fami" 
 ly are parasitic, parti- 
 cularly in caterpillars, 
 of which they destroy vast numbers. The Ichneu- 
 mon pierces the skin of the catterpillar or other larva 
 and inserts its egg or eggs. AVhen there is not much 
 difference in the size of the Ichneumon and the cater- 
 pillar, but one egg is inserted, but when a small Ich- 
 neumon attacks a large caterpillar, forty or fifty eggs 
 may be inserted. 

A curious fact in the economy of the larva; of the 
 Ichneumon is, that whilst they feed within the body 
 of the caterpillar, and upon its internal parts ; the 
 organs upon which the life of the latter depends are 
 left untouched, as the premature death of the cater- 
 pillar would cause that of the parasites. When near- 
 ly ready to enter the pupa state, these parasites some- 
 times devour the entrails of the caterpillar, and in 
 many cases this is able to form a cocoon and enter 
 the pupa state, so that the cocoon of a butterfly may 

have the appearance of giving tiirth to an Ichneu- 
 mon. In some cases the parasitic larvre perforate the 
 skin of the caterpillar and form their cocoons upon 
 the outside; but in general they come forth in their 
 perfect state. 

The Ichneumons are very active on the wing and 
 on foot, and their antennas are kept in a constant 
 tremor. Some members of the family have a slender 
 thread-like ovipositor several inches long, with which 
 they pierce and convoy their eggs into larvic buried 
 in their burrows in wood, and it is difficult to account 
 for the ability to accomplish this, as the insect must 
 operate from the outside, both in discovering the 
 presence of the larva, and in depositing its eggs. 

E. Blanchard, a French author, states a fact which 
 shows the extent to whic'.i caterpillars are destroyed 
 by ichneumons; namely, out of Itco Inindred cater- 
 pillars which destroy cabbage, and which were taken 
 to ascertain the number of them which would become 
 butterflies, but three produced them, the remaining 
 one hundred and ninety-seven being destroyed by a 
 small parasite of the genus Microgaster. 

Some parasitic Hymcnoptera are so small that ther« 
 is room in the egg of a butterfly for several of them, 
 and they are deposited here, instead of in the cater- 
 pillar. The Ichneumon family is not tho only one 
 which is parasitic, other families of Hymcnoptera 
 having the same general habits. 

Eriophilus MALI. — The new generic name (mean- 
 ing tvool-loving) is given in allusion to Eriosoma, upon 
 which this insect is parasitic ; and the trivial name 
 mati has reference to the apple tree, upon which it i« 
 found. Observing the dead and black specimens of 
 Eriosoma with the body plunp, but hollow, and a 
 small perforation posteriorly, we examined other in- 
 dividuals without the perforation, and found them to 
 contain the naked pupa of a minute hymenopteroui 
 insect, which, before it left the larva state must ha\'« 
 bored through the belly of the Eriosoma and affixed 
 it to the branch. 

This insect belongs to the family of Chalcididcr, 
 and has the following generic characters. Head free, 
 transverse, eyes large and set with short stifle hairs ; 

antennae ( see the 

additional figure, ) 
 with short pile el- 
 bowed, with six ar- 
 ticulations, the first 
 long (in the male), 
 the 2d obconical, th« 
 3d and 4th short and 
 equal, the 5th sub- 
 cylindrical, and th« 
 Eriophilus mali. 6th fusiform; in th« 

female the flagellum is fusiform, (see the left hand 
 figure) the 2d and 5th joints short, and the wingi 
 ample, the anterior one with the subcostal vein straight, 
 the stigmal branch very short, and difficult to distin-
