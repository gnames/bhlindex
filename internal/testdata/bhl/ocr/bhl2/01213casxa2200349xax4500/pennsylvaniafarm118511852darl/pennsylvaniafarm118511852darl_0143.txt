guish ; basal portion of the disk without pile, anterior 
 and exterior margin short ciliate; posterior wing ci- 
 liate witli long hairs. Feet slender, pentamerous, 
 adapted for leaping; medial tibial spine long, ante- 
 rior one curved. Abdomen sessile, and rather long, 
 having a sharp slender essertile sting or ovipositor in 
 the female ; Pupa without a follicle. 

Specijic cliaracter. Length one twenty-fifth of an 
 inch, expanse of the wings about twice this amount. 
 Body shining black, with a few hairs; front vertical- 
 ly impressed upon each side of the middle for the 
 antennM ; eyes violet, scabrous, short pilose ; anteniuu 
 (except the first and base of the second joint) white. 
 Wings with two straight linos of pile running at an 
 acute angle from the end of the subcostal vein across 
 the disk, which is densely pilose exterior to them. — 
 Base of the abdomen yellow, followed above by seve- 
 ral indistinct brownish transverse bands. Anterior 
 feet lohife, the femora (except the apex) black; medial 
 femora black, base and apex ivhite, tibise black with 
 the apex and the tarsi, wJtitc. Posterior femora, and 
 tarsi (except the base) white. Leaps with agility.- — 
 The genus seems to have some affinity with Agonion- 
 curus. 

For the purpose of condensing the figure the wings 
 of the left, and the feet of the right side have alone 
 been represented — a mode frequently resorted to in 
 entomological works. 

The assertion that the young pierce the bark of 
 pine trees and cause a frothy secretion, is incorrect, 
 as these leave the tree :is soon as they are hatched. 
 The insect which causes the secretion in question, 
 belongs to the genus Aphrophora, which bears some 
 resemblance to the cicada, but is much smaller. 

Cicada septendecim. 

In our la.st number (p. 99) we detailed some expe- 
 riments upon the seventeen year cicada, which we 
 now continue. The male and female stated to have 
 been alive upon the birch branch on the 18th of 
 June, died, the male on the 20th, and the female on 
 the 21st. 

Of the single female and male living on the apple 
 branch on the 17th, the male died on the 19th, and 
 the female upon the 22d. 

A discrepancy will appear in the number of insects 
 used in the experiment, which amounted to four 
 pair, three of which were upon the apple branch. 

This experiment shows that the male may live ten 
 and the female eleven days, after the period of im- 
 pregnation. The period through which the brood 
 h.as extended in L.incaster county has been about a 
 month and a half, say from the 20th of May to the 
 4th of July. 

Mr. Peter A. Browne informs us that he pierced 
 his skin with the ovipositor so as to bring blood, with- 
 out experiencing any evil effect, and we found the 
 hausiellum or snout too weak to pierce the skin. 

One newspaper account which represented a boy 
 as having been stung, probably referred to a hornet, 
 as the insect was not stated to have been examined ; 
 and the statement about the poison turning the ap- 
 plied flesh of several fowls black, is iv mere stretch 
 of the imagination. 

To Correspondeuts. 

Ti/pographical errors have been much too frequent 
 in the pages of the Journal, and unfortunately they 
 are not confined to technical or unusual words, Jteep 
 in one place standing for head. In the Horticultural 
 department we find errors like calcolularia instead of 
 calceolaria, which renders a refference to names of 
 plants nearly worthless. Technical words and proper 
 names should be written with the greatest care, the 
 safest way being not to join the letters, and to make 
 n and u conform to print, or they cannot be distin- 
 guished with certainty in a strange word. 

The editor lives in the country at a distance from 
 the office, so that he seldom has an opportunity to 
 correct the proofs, but endeavors will be made to give 
 less occasion for complaint in future. 

No one in particular is responsible for the scraps of 
 a few lines in length which are selected from news 
 papers to fill space at the bottom of short columns 
 had we seen that on lard candles on page 100, we 
 would have ommitted the last sentence. 

The potato was not a native of Virginia at the pe- 
 riod of its discovery, nor did Raleigh introduce it 
 from there into England, as most books on the sub- 
 ject assert. It is a native of South America, where 
 it is still found wild, with numerous other plants be- 
 longing to the same natural order. 

Farming, without science, is like quackery in the 
 practice of medicine and surgery — a little experience 
 goes a great ways, and quacks sometimes hit right, 
 and so do uneducated farmers, and nature does the 
 rest. A good constitution and a slight aflectiou may 
 do well in the hands of a medical quack, and a rich 
 soil, until exhausted, yield fair crops to hereditary or 
 traditional tillage. 

There may be some excuse for medical quackery, 
 or good reasons why more than the ignorant tolerate 
 it. The science of medicine, though one of the old- 
 est, is not perfect, and its great truths have heretofore 
 been locked up in the Schools— a sealed book to the 
 million — and those who have just dipped into the 
 surface of a science have more faith therein than he 
 who has searched to the bottom. Man loves mystery 
 and delights in the marvellous , and in sickness meii 
 have little reason and much credulity. 

But there is no excuse for quackery in the cultiva- 
 tion of the earth. The eternal truths of this science 
 are as palpable as the rocks from which our soils 
 are derived, or the nature of the plants which they 
 sustain. We should not tolerate quackery, and yet 
 nine-tenths of our practice is empirical. Our sons 
 are born farmers much as " the seventh son " is sup- 
 posed to be " a doctor." — Dr. J. A. KamicoU.
