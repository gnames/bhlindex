Gentlemen of the Union toionsliip Agricultural Club: 
 Your flattering resolution places too high an esti- 
 mate on the remarks I liave just made. So long an 
 article would be a great imposition to the pages of 
 the Farm Journal. But, if notes of the most impor- 
 tant part of my address -will be of any use to you, 
 you are welcome to them, to be disposed of in any 
 ■way you deem proper. Truly yours, 

J. M. McMiNN. 

Notes of an Address 
 Delivered before the Union township Agricultural Club, 
 on Saturdai/ evening, June 28ih, 1851. 
 The uses of manures are obvious, and their appli- 
 cation, if directed with scientific skill, always pay 
 well. Different kinds of soil require different kinds 
 of manure. It is obvious then that a careful com- 
 parison of the composition of your soils, and an ana- 
 lysis of the different plants that you wish to grow on 
 them are necessary. Our soils are extremely various 
 and every farm has some peculiarities. Our books 
 tell us, that plants are principally composed of gum, 
 sugar, starch, gluten, extractive, lignin, tannin, color- 
 ing matter, and wax. Gum is composed of three sim- 
 ples, known by the name of carbon, oxygen and hy- 
 drogen. Carbon in a pure state constitutes diamonds, 
 and charcoal is almost pure carbon. It is also dif- 
 fused in great abundance throughout the world — it 
 constitutes about one part in the hundred of the air 
 of the atmosphere — united with oxygen it forms a 
 gas called carbonic acid gas: this gas is also called 
 "fixed air," "choke damp,'' and by a variety of other 
 names. This gas in quantity, is destructive to both 
 animal and vegetable life. It often destroys life in 
 mines and in wells, and sometimes in a tight room, 
 ty being produced by burning charcoal in an open 
 furnace. Oxygen is an Eeriform fluid, like common 
 air, and has neither taste nor smell. It constitutes 
 twenty-one parts in the hundred of the atmosphere 
 and like carbon it is widely diffused throughout the 
 world, but urdike carlion, it is respirable even in its 
 pure state, and is eminently conducive to the support 
 of animal and vegetable life; indeed, without its 
 presence, all organic life would cease to exist. 

Hydrogen is also an iEriform fluid. It has no color, 
 but a very disagreeable smell, and is the lightest of 
 all ponderable bodies, being sixteen times lighter 
 than oxygen. It is one of the elements of water ; 
 that body being composed of two parts of hydrogen 
 and one part of oxygon by volume or bulk. It is in- 
 jurious when breathed. This is the gas used in 
 filling balloons.

Since the atmosphere contains carbon and oxygen, 
 they are always at hand for the use of the plant, and 
 all plants are constructed to decompose these gases, 
 and prepare them for their use. Hydrogen comes 
 from the decomposition of water. 

Gluten is composed of three substances, called by 
 chemists gliadine, mucine, and zimome, this last is 
 the principal of leaven or yeast. The insoluble part 
 is called gliadine, or vegetable albumen. 

Extractive, is a mixture of various vegetable ingre- 
 dients and includes the whole of the soluble matter 
 obtained from vegetables, reduced by careful evapo- 
 ration to either a pasty or solid consistence. It dif- 
 fers much in different plants, and is not a single 
 principle. 

Lignin. If a piece of the stem of an herb, shrub, 
 or tree is taken and well dried, and afterwards di- 
 gested, first in water, and then in alcohol, or such 
 other solvents as shall produce no violent effects upon 
 the solid parts, and if the digestion is continued till 
 the liquor is no longer colored, and dissolves no more 
 of the substance of the plant, there vrill remain be- 
 hind a sort of skeleton, which constitutes the basis 
 of the vegetable structure and amounts to about 
 ninety-six or ninety-eight per cent, of the different 
 kinds of wood, and this i3_called lignin, ligneaux, or 
 woody fibre, which is composed of carbon 52, oxygen 
 42.4, and hydrogen 5.6. 

Coloring matter. All varieties of color in flowers, 
 or their parts, are owing to the different degrees of 
 the oxidation of their pulp, called chromule. It is 
 entirely the result of the action of the sun on the con- 
 tained juices. 

Wax is composed of from seventy to eighty per 
 cent, of a substance called cerine, and from twenty 
 to thirty per cent, of a substance called myricino. — 
 The cerine is white and resembles wax. The two 
 substances differ merely in their degree of fusibility 
 and solubility in alcohol. Wax may be regarded as 
 nothing more than a fixed oil rendered solid by the 
 atjsorption of oxygen in the process of vegetation: 
 hence it may be expected to occur in a great variety 
 of states, according to its degree of oxigenation. 

A very small proportion of vegetable matter is de- 
 rived from the soil ; at least ninety-nine parts out of 
 (Mcry hundred are obtained from the air and water. 
 This is manifest, when it is considered that when ve- 
 getable matter is submitted to the action of fire, but 
 a very small part remains. Still this minute quanti- 
 ty is Indispensable to the growth of the plant, and if 
 ithe soil does not contain them, they must be supplied, 
 [and this is the true secret of manuring. To supply
