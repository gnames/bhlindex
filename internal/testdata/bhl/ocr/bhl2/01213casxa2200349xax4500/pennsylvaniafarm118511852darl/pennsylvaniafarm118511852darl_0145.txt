these things, and render them soluble, should be the 
 study of the farmer, for every thing must be dis- 
 solved to enter into a plant, and it takes many un- 
 seen chemical processes to reduce all these manures 
 to a fit condition to bo absorbed by the roots.

The stalks and the seed generally contain different 
 amounts of these ultimate constituents ; it is, there- 
 fore, frequently necessary to apply a manure that u-il' 
 proinote tfie growth of the seed, and retard the growth 
 of 1}i£ stalk. 

How shall these constituents be applied ? Potash 
 is obtained from vrood ashes. Oak yields about 1-5 
 parts potash to the 100. Ashes are therefore a cheap 
 and convenient manure — ashes also neutralize acids, 
 and render sandy soils more tenacious. 

Soda exists in common salt, and in glauher salt, and 
 is a useful application to some soils, although most 
 slate rocks contain salt in some form. 

Lime is an abundant and useful manure. It acts 
 differently on different soils. This is principally ow- 
 ing to the amount of animal and vegetable matter 
 contained in the soil. Heavy clay soils contain less 
 vegetable and animal matter than sandy or slaty soils, 
 and consequently, lime exhibits more beneficial effects 
 on the latt(a- than on the former kind of soils. It 
 quickly decomposes all vegetable and animal matters, 
 and renders them soluble. Wet soils ploughed deep- 
 ly and well limed are rendered dryer and better adap- 
 ted to vegetation. 

Magnesia occurs in nearly all our limestones. Ep- 
 som salt is a sulphate of magnesia. Magnesia must 
 be used sparingly, for notwithstanding it enters into 
 the composition of many plants, large quantities have 
 an injurious effect ; however, after two years its 

hurtful influence seems to become exhausted when 
 over applied iu lime. 

Phosphorus is seldom found pure in nature. It ex- 
 ists in large quantities in bones, and the use of bone 
 dust has been found to be of great value in Europe, 
 whore bones are imported in prodigious quantities 
 for manure. Every farmer should use it on his land. 
 Phosphate of lime occurs in large deposits in Morris 
 county, N. J. It is chiefly exported to Europe. It is 
 found sparingly in Nittany valley, and is of far more 
 value as a manure than plaster of parig. 

Chloride of Sodium is rock salt, and has been 
 found highly beneficial as a manure. I have a work 
 addressed to the farmers and graziers of G. B., on the 
 use of salt, but science is transcended as usual, and 
 ths matter is over dons, and consequently, salt is con 
 damned as an " impoverisher." Barnyard manure 
 will in some measure supply the plant with this in- 
 gredient, but many vegetables require a considerable 
 quantity, and will not thrive luxuriantly without it 
 is supplied from some other source. 

Sulphuric Acid is applied in the form of plaster of 
 paris, this mineral being a sulphate of lime. Its ef- 
 fects are known, though generally overrated and 
 wastefully applied. 

Silica, is the principal portion of the hard stones 
 which compose the crust of the globe, such as rich crys- 
 tal, agate, quartz, Jlint, &c., and always exists iu this 
 neighborhood in sufScient quantity in the soil, for the 
 nutriment of the plants. In heavy clayey soils it is 
 often necessary to apply it in the form of sand. 

Carbonic Acid exists in the air, and in charcoal, as 
 I have before intimated, and it is probable that plants 
 do not often languish for the want of this acid. 

Some plants require other principles to supply them 
 with food, but I will not now attempt to follow them 
 further. 

Air and water are the great machinery by which 
 all the substances of which plants are composed, are 
 acted upon and prepared. They reduce to gases or 
 liquids all the various ingredients that enter into the 
 structure of vegetables. It is the bussiness of the 
 agriculturists, to not only supply the soil with all de- 
 ficiencies that exisits iu it, but also to assist in de- 
 composing and assimilating the same. 

Stable manure contains the principal part of the 
 mineral elements for the nurture or food of plants. — 
 AlkaVme phosphates are, however, wanting in this 
 manure, and several of the salts exist only in small 
 quantities. Next to stable manure is Guano ; it is, 
 however, placed at the head of manures, but I cannot 
 see why it should be so. It contains 45.4 Phosphate 
 of magnesia; 1.7 Carbonate of magnesia ; 0.6 Alka.- 
 lin salts; 26,0 Organic matter; 2.8 Ammonia: 16.4 
 water, 6.2 sand, (fee. It appears from some analysis 
 that guano yields seventeen per cent, of ammonia, but 
 it is probable that the principal part of the efficacy of 
 guano is owing to the large proportion of phosphate
