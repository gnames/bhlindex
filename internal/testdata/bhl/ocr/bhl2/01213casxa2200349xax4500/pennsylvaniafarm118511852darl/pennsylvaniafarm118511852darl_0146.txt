it contains. The solid excrement of Swine, ho-wevei-) 
 yields move phosphate of lime than guano. It also 
 anpears that guano is defective in alkalin and on a 
 soil defective in alkaline it would not produce very 
 great effects, unless the defect ^yas supplied. 

Next on the list is charcoal. It is the most power- 
 ful alisorbcnt known. It takes from the air, oxygen, 
 hydrogen, ammonia, &o., and holds them for the supply 
 of the plant -while the weather is dry. During rain 
 it absorbs eighty per cent of water and releases the 
 gases to act upon the earth, and when the weather 
 becomes dry,it parts with the water, and absorbs from 
 the air the gases again, and thus it goes on acting as 
 a great vegetable laboratory. 

Lime is a valuable manure, but it is often wildly 
 ■used. Many farmers expect lime to do every thing, 
 as indeed, every different kind of manure has its ad- 
 vocate. Some select plaster, some salt, others guano, 
 and others lime, and they use their favorite fertil- 
 izer, until the soil is exhausted of every thing else, 
 when they abandon that as an "improvisher," and 
 their land suffers almost irreparably, because of their 
 ignorance. Lime decomposes dead animal matter and 
 putrescent manures, and is of great service in this 
 way ; it reduces vegetable matter and makes it solu- 
 ble, thus preventing it from laying in the soil in a 
 dry and useless condition — it absorbs a small quanti- 
 ty of moisture from the air, and enters itself into the 
 composition of plants; but it is very caustic, and if 
 there is a want of decomposable matter in the soil, it 
 often burns as it were, every thing up. Most of our 
 Centre County limestone contains a good deal of 
 Magnesia, which is, in large quantities, destructive to 
 most vegetaliles, therefore different kinds of limestone 
 produce different effects. 

A rational use of stable manure, guano, lime, plas- 
 ter, common salt, rock salt, bone dust, phosphate of 
 lime, charcoal, composts, ashes, and barn yard ma- 
 pure, used as the soil may demand, will never fall to 
 make a fertile and productive field, and any one of 
 them save stable or barn yard manure, or charcoal, 
 used excessively, will diminish the fertility of most 
 soils, and if conlinuod, will ultimately impoverish 
 them. 

Diversity ot Crops~Cotton~Coffee and Tea~Flax. 

The interests of Agriculture are directly promoted 
 by diversifying its productions, so that the prosperity 
 of any district will generally be in proportion to the 
 variety of profitable crops, which are cultivated by 
 its farmers. This is shown by the flourishing con- 
 dition of agriculture in the vicinity of our large cities, 
 where the markets invite the cultivation of many 
 vegetable productions, which are not grown at a dis- 
 tance from such localities. 

There are very many agricultural plants, for thg 
 produce of which we pay large sums, importing 
 from abroad, what may just us well be reared in our 

country. Neither the sugar cane, rice, tobacco, nor 
 cotton plant is indigenous ; and yet these are all 
 grown with unequalled success in the United States, 
 and constitute by far the greatest amount and value 
 of our exports. 

The quantities of coffee and tea consumed in this 
 country, are prodigious. It has been ascertained that 
 we imported, in one year, 46,070 tons of coffee, when 
 the quantity imported into rrance,was but 20,050 tons, 
 and that imported into the United Kingdoms of Eng- 
 land, Scotland, and Ireland, but 16,250 tons. We are 
 assuredly the greatest coffee drinkers in the world. — 
 On the other hand, the English consume more tea than 
 we do. It is with them a universal beverage. Still 
 the use of this article in the United States, is very 
 great and is increasing. Now both the tea and coffee 
 plants may be cultivated to any extent in our coun 
 try — the coffee tree in Florida and Texas, and the 
 tea plant much further north. The green teas are 
 raised in the Northern provinces of China, where the 
 snow is said to be on the ground and upon those 
 shrubs for days together. They might doubtless be 
 grown in our middle and "Western States. It is for- 
 tunate for our Southern friends, that their soil and 
 climate are so well suited to those valuable plants ! 
 for as to their great staple, cotton, the days of their 
 monopoly are numbered. England cannot much 
 longer submit to the danger of having but one ade- 
 quate source of supply, and that an independent one. 
 Already the production in Asia and Africa, — not to 
 speak of the magnificent regions of Brazil — has in- 
 creased to such an extent as to show, that she will 
 very soon derive a greatly augmented supply from 
 those quarters. Besides the experiments on flax, de- 
 monstrate that an important competition with cotton 
 is likely to spring up from the improved manufactui'o 
 of that material : of which the northern, middle and 
 western states, will be able to grow enough, to supply 
 the world. 

With respect to coffee and tea, there is a certainty 
 of their continuing to be articles of diet, without any 
 chance or change from the caprice of fashion. Fash, 
 ion did not introduce them, nor can it lay them aside, 
 any more than dispense with the use of sugar. It is 
 very remarkable that these two productions, orig- 
 inating in far distant countries, should have come in- 
 to such general use and acquired so permanent a 
 hold upon the taste of mankind. Recent chemical 
 analysis satisfactorily explains it, by developing the 
 surprising fact, that the essential principle of coffee 
 is identical with that of tea. Cafeine and iheine, the 
 names applied to these substances respectively, pos- 
 sessing exactly the same chemical constituents. It 
 is also proved that the beverages made from these 
 plants, so far from being a slow poison, (as was 
 once supposed.) are as wholesome as they are palp- 
 table. A. L. Hayes.
