Mr. Editor : — Having made a call on the practical 
 farmers to contribute to your Journal tlic experience 
 they may have in agriculture, I comply with your 
 request. Having to write in a language which is 
 not my own, (I had to study the English at the age 
 of thirty years,) I hope all due allowance will be 
 made. I will have to enter into a short biogra" 
 phical sketch to define my position. 

Thirty-six years ago, when the fall of Napoleon 
 carried me, together with thousands of others, an ex- 
 ile to this country, I entered into the mercantile bu- 
 siness, but soon found that the sedentary habits and 
 anxiety of mind which follow it, were injurious to 
 that physical energy, (so necessary in this country,) 
 to which a military life had accustomed me. I mar- 
 ried what a city miss calls a " country girl." Though 
 I had to renounce the enjoyment of that refined in- 
 tellect, the fruit of a careful education, I was fully 
 compensated by enjoying that comfortable home — 
 that fireside bliss, so well understood in this country. 
 Being scant of funds (exiles seldom bring money 
 along) I could only buy a cheap property. An op- 
 portunity presented itself — a worn out farm situated in 
 Lykens Valley, Dauphin county, whereon a mill was 
 erected which had been condemned by millers and 
 millwrights as unfit to do good work. Mill and farm 
 rented for $125 a year; I bought it for §4400. Drilled 
 at a military school, I still retained some knowledge 
 of hydraulics, and though not a miller, I discovered 
 that the mill could be made good. After having 
 made the alterations, I found myself indebted S-200, 
 the interest of which was higher than what the pro- 
 perty had rented for. The mill could do more than 
 double the work it did before. This was a little help, 
 yet I had to work hard and go through all the handi- 
 work of a farmer to discharge my debt. 

While my children were growing up, a difiiculty 
 arose for which I was not prepared. Living in a 
 German settlement I was compelled to leave my farm 
 and remove to Pottsville in order to have them edu- 
 cated under my own eyes. After residing there for 
 some years, I was glad to see that my sons had not 
 lost their taste for rural life. I sold the property in 
 Lyken's valley for $10,000, and bought the one on 
 which I now reside for §5000. It was in the same 
 jJoor condition I found the first property. The land, 
 one hundred and six acres, was considered worthless. 
 There was attached to it thirty-six acres of good 
 woodland, and a mill entirely out of order. The pro- 
 perty is now in thorough repair and would command 
 a rent of ?700. I have retired from business and 
 given it into the hands of my sons, the one being a 
 practical farmer and the other a practical miller. 

A difficulty which appears to be overlooked, is the 
 peculiar position of Pennsylvania. Nearly one half 
 of its farming population is of the Teutonic race — 
 only one in ten can read an English agricultural 

journal, so that nine-tenths do not participate in its 
 benefits.* Is it not absolutely necessary, if a really 
 patriotic zeal animates the community, to preparo 
 those nine-tentlis to take a proper interest to promote 
 an art that is the fundamental wealth of the nation? 
 It may be asked, why don't the Germans take ad- 
 vantage of the school law and educate their children ? 
 Ay, there's the rub. If, Mr. Editor, you will open 
 your columns on that subject, I will give my opinion 
 as to the cause and its remedy. 

The German Pennsylvania farmer stands pre-emi- 
 nent as an agriculturist, and it is of the highest im- 
 portance to induce him to take an interest in the efibrt 
 which is now making to promote agriculture — to 
 make him understand the great discoveries in 
 geology and agricultural chemistry. 

Having been appointed a member of the executiva 
 committee of the State Agricultural Society, for thu 
 congressional district in which I reside, I thought it 
 my duty to attend its meeting, when I stated mj 

opinion on the subject of agricultural education. — 
 According to request I have prepared a plan for agri- 
 cultural schools and experimental farms, which I sent 
 some weeks ago, to the gentlemen composing tho 
 committee. When it is presented to the executive 
 committee for consideration, I shall state my opinion 
 at large. 

Excuse the long preamble I have made, and my 
 digression from agricultural subjects, but they may 
 serve to illustrate future communications.

* Facts will not sustain this assertion of our cor- 
 respondent. Although there are many German farm- 
 ers in Pennsylvania, the proportioh is not near so 
 great as he makes it. We venture to assert that two- 
 thirds of the Pennsylvania farmers understand and 
 read the English. This, however, may not be the 
 case where our correspondent resides, his district 
 containing more German farmers than, perhaps, any 
 other section of the State. — Ed.] 

The Cucumber Bug. 

Observing an article on this troublesome bug by 
 .J. S. Keller, in the last number of the Journal, I send 
 him below, a receipt which he will find more effectual 
 than eithfir "lime dust, ashes, black pepper, plaster, 
 flour of sul]ihur, &c." As it is not original with me, 
 I shall also make over to him, without cliarge, all my 
 claim to the §50 premium, for " the pers<jn who dis- 
 covers an effective remedy. 

Apply, through the rose of a watering pot, the 
 holes of which will have to be made larger than com- 
 mon, whitewash of such a consistence as to adhere to 
 the leaves, and leave a thin coating. This will not 
 prevent their growing, and will be found an effectual 
 antidote to the bug, who does not fancy the trouble 
 of going through the lime to get at its food. Thu 
 a;ii lication may be repeated if necessary.
