SHEEP BREEDING. 

[August, 

England cannot raise the fine wool required for 
 manul'acturinjz broadcloths. Lest we might bo sus- 
 pected of prejudice, hear what is written by one of 
 her own sulijccts. 

In "the industrial I'osources of Ireland." by Robert 
 Kane, M. D. Honorary member of the Koyal Dublin 
 Society, &c., we find the following: " The woollen 
 manufacture has been, at all periods, considered as 
 of high importance in this country, [Ireland;] so that 
 at certain times, it was deemed necessary [by Eng- 
 land] to take measures to moderate its prosperity [!]* 
 A very large quantity of wool is grown in Ireland. — 
 The total number of sheep being 2,091,199. A great 
 deal ot this sent to France, where it is manufactured 
 into 'mousseline de laine.' ". After noticing the dif- 
 ference between wool that will felt and full, and fleece 
 [hair] Avhich will not, he proceeds thus: '"In moist, 
 cold climates, such as the British Islands, the natural 
 wool is, universally, long staple and unjit for feedinrj; 
 whilst in dry climates, with hot summers, the wool is 
 short stapled and felts strongly. The wool is pro- 
 duced not merely in Ireland, but in England, also, is 
 thus cxeliislrely adapted to the worsted trade. For 
 woollen cloths and similar goods the wool is imported 
 from the Continent. It has often been an object with 
 the English wool growers and landed proprietors to 
 jirodiiee this fellini/ wool, in Unr/land, and thus got 
 rid of the necessity of purchasing abroad ; but it h.\s 

BEEN FOUND I.MPOSSIBl.E, AFTER THE MOST E.XPENSIVE 

EXPERIMENTS, in iniportinij sheep of partieular foeks. 
 It has been found that in two or three generations, of 
 even the pure breed, the influence of the climate and food 
 totally ehani/ed the ehararter of the wool, and brought 
 it to the same quality as that of the native animals." 
 AVo repeat, then, without fear of contradiction, 
 " England cannot produce the fine wools required for 
 manufacturing broadcloths," liut she will continue to 
 manufacture these cloths as long as she can find sale 
 for them ; consequently she must import fine wool 
 from some other country. Why should not this coun- 
 try be the United States? AV'hy not Virginia? Can 
 any one give a reason? If we can produce as fine 
 wool as any other country, why may she not import 
 our wool as she does our cotton^ How will it be if 
 we can produce j^rtc/' wool than any other country? 
 And we can produce finer wool than any except 
 Saxony. 

One portion of the art of sheep breeding consists in 
 selecting the ])roper breed of sheep for the partieular 
 location of the farmer. "VVe have already seen th.at 
 neither England nor Ireland can raise the fine woolled- 
 sheep. Doctor Kane says that it has been found to be 
 impossible, after the most expensive experiments. — 
 He attributes the failure to climate and food. The 
 natural food dcponils upim the soil and climate; so 
 that ho might have said "soil and climate." If it de- 
 pends up(jn eliinatc it is fortunate for us, that in this 
 widely extended continent we have almost every 
 Tariety of it; but still, it is a most important point 
 for the farmer to know which breed of sheep will 
 thrive best and produce tlie finest wool, in the par- 
 ticular district where Providence has cast his lot. — 
 And we confess that upon turning over the leaves of 
 the volume of the Cabinet of American Wools, we 
 were forcibly struck with the correctness of the re- 
 mark first made at the late Pennsylvania Agricultur.al 
 Convention, that two parallel lines might be drawn 
 over the map of the United States, including within 
 them the geographical (and perhaps the geological) 

* This puts us in mind of British writers talking of 
 the arrofjance of New England in attempting to 
 manufacture. 

district best calculated for rearing the fine-icoolled 
 sheep. We also remarked that there was another ex- 
 tensive district of our country, easily pointed out, 
 which is admirably calculated for raising the fleece, 
 which, in England, is called "long wool," but which 
 is properlj' 'hair." If this information turns out to 
 be correct, (if it is so, only to a limited extent,) then 
 my collection of wools, made for a different purpose, 
 will have shed more light upon the connexion of 
 climate and soil with wool growing, than all the 
 learned disquisitions and opinions that have ever made 
 their appearance before the public. Two things, we 
 think, are certain; 1st. That the wool staplers and 
 manufacturers will find it their interest to consult this 
 record, for the best information, where they may find 
 the finest fleece; and 2d. The new beginner in .sheep 
 breeding may also there learn where to apply for the 
 best breeds. 

But, perhaps, after all that has been said, some 
 persons may believe, that while this inlbrmation may 
 be well enough for the sheep breeder and wool mami- 
 facturer that to the public, in general, it is compara- 
 tively useless. But the true patriot, particularly if 
 he be a politician, (in the proper sense of that word,) 
 is deeply interested in knowing what are all the great 
 and leading interests of his country. 

The author of the " Industrial Record," speaking 
 of Thoiupsonville, in Connecticut, says that they 
 manufacture carpets, annually, to the amount of 
 480,000 yards. Te enable them to do this, they use 
 1,(.)00,000 and upwards of pounds of wool, all of which 
 is, he says, imported from either the Mediterranean 
 or South America. But I contend, (and you agree 
 with me in this opinion,) that every pound of tuis 

WOOL OUGHT TO BE RAISED IN OUR SOUTHERN StATBS. 

The shecq) that produces that fleece thrives iJiere, and 
 its lireeding and raising, from Delaware to Georgia, 
 would be a source of immense profit. But here we 
 feel called upon to notice an error into which the 
 editor of the work above quoted has, inadvertently, 
 fiillcn. He asserts that the importation of the Medi- 
 terranean and South American wool, at seven centa 
 a pound; does not interfere, in the slightest degree, 
 with the domestic wool grower, who, (he says,) can- 
 not afford to raise wool at so low a price, when, with 
 the same food and expense, he can raise fleeces worth 
 on an average, thirty cents a pound. But he seem? 
 to have been entirely unaware of the fact, that the 
 places where these hairy fleeces can be grown, are 
 unfit for the breeding and raising of the fme wooled 
 sheep. He seems also to have lost sight of the fact, 
 that the sheep, whose wool is worth (as he says,) 
 thirty cents a pound, produces, on an average, only 
 three pounds of fleece; whereas of the hairy fleeces, 
 bred in the United States, I have in my cabinet speci 
 mens that produced ITJ lbs. Now a schoolboy can 
 cypher this out, to show that this latter wool is th« 
 most profitalde. 

5 lbs. of fine fleece at 30 cents, $0 90 

17^ lbs. of hairy fleece at 7 cents, 1 22.'. 

Balance in favor of the hairy fleece, |0 32V 

To raise one million of pounds of fleece at 3 lbs. a 
 sheep would require 333,333 sheep. 

But to raise one million of pounds of hairy fleece, 
 at 17i lbs. per sheep, would require only 57,140 sheep. 

Difference 7(i,193 sheep, the feeding and taking 
 care of which, would cost $171,420. 

Our brethern of the Eastern parts, of the Southern 
 States, should, therefore, turn their attention to 
 breeding and raising the hairy sheep; and Congress 
 should encourage them to do so, by laying a duty on 
 foreign wool, though woi'th only seven cents a pound.
