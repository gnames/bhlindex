Cultivation of Flowers. 

One of the best evidences which can be given of a 
 refined taste and gentle nature, is a fondness for 
 flowers. Tl^ere is something in the appearance of a 
 window well filled with fine plants that at once pre- 
 possesses us in favor of the lady who cultivates them. 
 It may also be set down as a fixed fact, that a want 
 of fondness for flowers, is a pretty sure indication of 
 a morose and seloish disposition. Presuming, how- 
 ever, that there are few of our lady reader-s who be- 
 long to the latter class, we present an abstract of 
 valuable hints, for window gardening, which we com- 
 mend to their especial attention. 

Plants grown in pots require more attention than 
 those grown in almost any other way. They are 
 generally kept in the house, and most frequently in 
 those apartments which the family regularly occupy. 
 The disadvantages attending their position are such 
 as to require the utmost attention to counteract them. 
 The air of the family room is generally dry, and as 
 a plant derives its nourishment from the leaves as 
 well as the roots, this kind of an atmosphere is pecu- 
 liarly unfavorable to them. Tlic pores of the leaves 
 become filled with dust, and hence fail to act with 
 their natural energj-. It should therefore be a fixed 
 rule to give the plants the benefits of fresh air when- 
 ever practicable. The leaves, which have sufiered 
 from the dust and dryness cf the sitting room, should 
 be well syringed, so as to clean them thoroughly of 
 the particles of dust, and restore the pores to their 
 naturally healthy condition. 

Water should never be permitted to stand in the 
 saucers for any length of time, as the effect of the 
 stagnant water in the winter season, is to chill the 
 roots and thus injure the healthiness of the plant, 
 besides, the water will cause the Spongioles of the 
 roots to become rotten. 

Pluck off and throw away all the decayed and de- 
 caying leaves, aa both the family and the plants will 
 be benefitted by their removal. The decaying vege- 
 table matter destroys the beauty of the plant, as well 
 as the fragrance of the flower. 

Give the' plants the benefit of light and air, both 
 heing essential to their growth and health. Do not 
 keep them too warm. We see the importance of this 
 when plants cultivated in a green house are suddenly 

brought into a warm room. The leaves shrivel up — 
 flower buds fall off without expanding — and the plant 
 becomes sickly, and either loses its leaves or dies. 

By attention to the hints thus briefly thrown to- 
 gether, every lady may cultivate as many handsome 
 plants as will fill her windows. In conclusion, we 
 would say, that if many young ladies would devote 
 one half the time tb the cultivation of flowers, they 
 give to novel reading, they would not only be more 
 admired, but they would render themselves much 
 wiser, healthier and happier. In these days when 
 green houses abound in almost every little village, a 
 beautiful rose bush, or some other handsome plant, 
 may be had for the price of a trashy novel. What 
 lady of taste would not prefer the plant to the novel? 

How to Propagate tlie Raspberry. 

Philadelphia, July 7, 1851. 

My Dear Sir: — Your favor of the 4th inst. was re- 
 ceived on Saturday. I shall be pleased to see you 
 when you come to the city; will you do me the favor 
 to bring with you a few buds of the General Hand 
 plum. 

In the Ja\y number of the Farm Journal, you have 
 given me a position in the Pennsylvania Horticultu- 
 ral Society, to which I am not entitled. Though a 
 member of the fruit committee, I am not the chair- 
 man. This honor was conferred on E. W. Keyser, 
 Esq., in 1840, three years before I became connected 
 with the society; and so highly have his services 
 ever been appreciated, that he has continued to re- 
 ceive this mark of approbation and confidence every 
 successive year since his first appointment. On re- 
 vising the constitution and bj'-laws, in 1844, among 
 the amendments adopted was one creating a " com- 
 mittee for establishing the names of fruits." My 
 name being placed first on that committee has pro- 
 bably ocassioned the erroneous impression referred to 
 above, and which has several times appeared in print. 
 Having been instrumental in disseminating this error, 
 I trust j-ou will do me the favor publicly to correct it. 

I now proceed to make a few more remarks on tho 
 raspberry. 

The usual mode of propagating the raspberry is by 
 suckers. As however but few of these are sent up 
 annually to supply the place of the old canes which 
 always perish after having matured the fruit, it must 
 necessarily take a considerable time to multiply tha 
 variety to any extent. 

It may also be readily propagated by layering. — 
 Cuttings strike with much difficulty. 

But the best and most expeditious mode of multi- 
 plying the raspberry is by division of the roots. In 
 this way it may be propagated with as much facility 
 as the Morus multicaulis, or PauUinia imperialis. — 
 By pursuing this plan, I have, in one year, from a 
 small plant, raised forty or fifty; and if I mi take 
 not Mr. Robert Buist and 5Ir. James D. Fulton ha„„
