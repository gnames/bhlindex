Evergreen Trees aud Shrubs. 

The demand for evergreen trees has increased so 
 rapidly within the last two years, (having been the 
 present season, perhaps, unprecedented,) that I pro- 
 pose to notice some of the ■n-oU known, as well as 
 more rare varieties, as a matter of interest to many 
 of the readers of the Farm Journal ; including those 
 of more recent introduction from abroad, and giving 
 promise of being valuable additions to our pleasure 
 grounds and arboretums. 

Of the beauty and value of ornamental trees and 
 shrubs as appendages to a dwelling — of their intria- 
 sic worth in enhancing the value of property to those 
 who regard only dollars and cents — but little need bo 
 said. The time has gone by when shade trees around 
 a dwelling to shield it from the sun, and to increase 
 its attractions, were considered as superfluous addi- 
 tions which might be attended to or not at pleasure. 
 Without these, a place can now rarely be sold ; with 
 them, and where the space allotted is large, and the 
 selection and arrangement judicious, the value is 
 greatly increa^-ed. 

The persistent foliage of evergreens at a season 
 when aU else is bare, their variety of growth, and 
 shades of color; from the stiff and sombre yew, to the 
 lively tints and graceful habit of the hemlock or 
 cedar* make them especial favorites: and first, a 
 few words with respect to transplanting them. That 
 there are more failures with these, than with other 
 trees, is most certain; and it perhaps is equally true 
 that there need not be. With the exception of three 
 or four months, we hear occasionally of evergreens 
 being moved at all seasons of the year with success. 
 But while one swallow does not make a summer, so 
 neither does the fact of moving them in the fall or 
 winter, prove this to be the best time. Much in these 
 cases may depend on the severity or otherwise of the 
 winter. My experience is, that rather late in the 
 spring, or just as the roots are commencing to throw 
 out new fibres, and starting in their new growth — 
 evergreens may be transplanted with about as much 
 certainty as other trees. It is, however, all import- 
 ant, that after being taken cut of the ground, the 
 roots should not be allowed to become dry. Their 
 newly formed extremities or spongelets are easilj- 
 closed up from this cause, and they differ from decidu- 
 ous trees in not readily again opening to absorb their 
 food. They have not the same elasticity, and death 
 ensues to the tree from the cutting ofT of the supplies. 
 Where it is an object to remove them of a large size, 
 it can safely be done in winter, by digging a trench 
 a few feet from the body of the tree at any open spell 
 of weather, and allowing the mass of earth within to

become frozen, when the whole can be got under and 
 moved off on a low truck or sled, the hole being pre- 
 viously prepared to receive it. Trees of twenty or 
 more feet in height can be moved in this way, with 
 but little perceptible cessation of growth. In addi 
 tion, observe the same general rules in planting as 
 with other trees, to place them at about the same 
 depth as before, to dig large holes, so as to leave at 
 least one foot, and the more the better, between the 
 extremities of the roots and the solid ground, mulch 
 them the first season and water in dry weather, and 
 failures will rarely occur. 

I shall now give a list of some of the best foreign 
 varieties of evergreen trees and shrubs which have 
 been found well adapted to our county, naming them 
 as they occur, without any botanical arrangement, 
 and intending, in the description, more for the gene- 
 ral planter al)uut to ornament his grounds, than for 
 the botanist or nurseryman, who are, of course, fa- 
 miliar with them. 

First and foremost, on account of its intrinsic worth 
 and the great demand for it, is the Abies cxcelsa or 
 Noncatjfr. This tree is a native of northern Europe, 
 and from its entire hardiness and great beauty, is a 
 universal favorite. It will grow either in the shade 
 or in an exposed position; is easily transplanted; 
 improves with age, becoming more dense and com- 
 pact, which makes it valuable on the exposed side of 
 a house; and is a rapid grower, its leading shoot 
 often making three feet in one season. The branches 
 have a pendent or drooping habit, giving it a stately 
 as well as exceedingly graceful appearance. Trees 
 with this tendency, which is a mere accidental pro- 
 perty, are much enquired for. 

The Nonvay spnice [or Jir) has been tried in some 
 parts of Europe for hedging, and where a heavy and 
 impenetrable screen is wanted, would answer well ; but 
 its comparative scarcity, and the great demand for it 
 as an ornamental tree, is a difficulty at present. In 
 its own country, it reaches one hundred and fifty feet 
 in height and grows freely in all soils and situations. 
 Our common black spruce, Abies nigra, is often sold 
 for the Norway, and is even found occasionally among 
 it in importations by nursorymon. It is an inferior 
 tree in every respect, and not always easy to detect 
 when small, but it soon shows its inferiority. Its leaves 
 are considerably shorter, and lie closer than the other, 
 and it is also a slow grower. 

Ihe Abies picea, or European silver fir is, in our opin- 
 ion, very little, if any, inferior to the preceding, and 
 it is surprising that it is not more generally planted. 
 It is a majestic tree when large, and although rather 
 slow in creeping up, yet after reaching six or more 
 feet it grows strong and vigorously and retains its sym- 
 metry as it advances ; in this particular differing from 
 our own balsam fir, which very frequently loses part 
 of its foliage and displays bare and unsightly branch- 
 es. It has also a more horizontal growth, covering a
