ing rows, westerly, should be placed the apple trees, 
 May duke and other cherry trees of low growth. — 
 Then should follow pear trees, and cherry trees of 
 taller growth ; and if any nut trees are set out, they 
 should be placed in the westernmost row, ncaiest the 
 fence or hedge, where their shadows will be least in 
 jurious. There will thus be a regular gradation in 
 tlie size of the trees ia the several rows; and they 
 will all, as far as possible, equally enjoy the benefit 
 of the morning sun. 

When transplanting a tree, the pruning knife must 
 be freely used, if a handsome head ia to be produced. 
 The branches must all be shortened down to from 
 two to five buds each, according to the number and 
 condition of the roots. If a young tree have many 
 branches, all the smaller ones, and such as are not 
 desiralily placed, must be cut off' close and smooth ; 
 suffering only three or four of the finest and best 
 placed limbs to remain, and shortening these down 
 to from three to five buds. It must be borne in mind 
 that each bud allowed to remain, is intended to pro- 
 duce a limb ; and that the beauty of the future head 
 or crown will depend entirely on the arrangement 
 and distribution now adopted. The sap naturally 
 pushes with most force towards the upper buds, not 
 unfrequently passing the lower by, and allowing them 
 to remain dormant or inert. If many buds are suf- 
 fered to remain, the result of an inadequate supply, 
 or too great diff"u9ion of the sap, will be the produc- 
 tion of feeble and sickly branches, which set fruit 
 prematurely, and retard the growth or prevent the 
 developement of the tree. Apple trees, moreover, 
 should be so pruned as to produce a hollow or open 
 crown. 

The necessity of pruning trees freely when trans- 
 planting them arises, furthermore, from the fact that 
 during the subsequent year their roots are to be re- 
 newed or reinvogorated. Delicate roots, the spongi- 
 oles of which are yet to push their way in the ground, 
 and then form and spread lateral fibres for the collec- 
 tion of nutriment, cannot of course send up such 
 abundant supplies of sap, as the limbs and branches 
 received before removal. Ojnsequently, if the same 
 number of these be permitted to remain, without due 
 pruning or straitening, the roots may indeed supply 
 sap sufficient to maintain life, but will themselves 
 sustain injury from the eSiirt; and the tree will long 
 languish, and perhaps ultimately perish, from thus 
 overtasking the roots. A grown tree, which has al- 
 ready borne fruit, is almost certain to be destroyed, 
 if thus transplanted; and this fact alone shows the 
 expediency of using the knife freely, even in the case 
 of young trees. The larger the tree, the greater 
 should be the quantity of wood taken off' — particular- 
 ly, if the roots be few in number and small in extent, 
 or have unavoidably suffered much in the removal. 
 Larger roots, which have been cut or broken off', 
 should have the lacerated parts trimmed smooth; and 

smaller roots that have been lacerated or crushed, 
 should be carefully cut oflT. 

When young trees are transplanted in the fall, it 
 is not advisable to ])rune off" at once all the branches 
 which are designeil to be removed, or oven to shorten 
 fully those which are intended to remain. It is bet- 
 ter to delay the operation till March, when there is 
 no longer danger that severe frost will penetrate the 
 cut ends of branches and destroy the upper buds. 

Orchards may be regularly manured, if it be done 
 at the right season and in the proper manner; but 
 nurseries should not be manured — or very slightly, 
 if at all. Trees in the latter ought to be so treated 
 as to secure their hardiness and durability in any 
 soil or situation in which they may subsequently l)e 
 placed. Those in an orchard, on the contrary, will 
 occasionally need some fertilizer, to promote their 
 due growth and developement and insure the produc- 
 tion of liberal crops of fruit. 

A piece of soft flannel or piece of old woolen sock 
 dipped in water, may with great advantage be wrapped 
 around the main root of a tree, which proves to be 
 very deficient in smaller roots, when taken up for 
 transplanting. It will long retain moisture, and pro- 
 mote the speedy exsertion of fibrous roots. Trees 
 which would otherwise almost certainly fail to grow, 
 may be preserved by this simple application.

GcAXO. — We again request that some of our cor- 
 respondents who have tested its value, will favor us 
 with their observations and experience with Guano. 
 We could readily transfer to our columns able arti- 
 cles on the subject, from writers in other sections, but 
 we are very desirous of presenting the experience of 
 some of our own farmers, f.nd therefore repeat the 
 request made in our last number. AV'e hope some of 
 correspondents will take up the subject. 

Work for August. — Dig under old rows of straw- 
 berry plants, or make new beds. Raspberry canes 
 may bo cut away when the fruit is gathered frer-i 
 them. Summer prune vines and trees. Hoot prune 
 too luxuriant dwarfs. Bud all sorts of fruit trees.— 
 Preserves, wines. Sec, may be made, but require care 
 in kceeping. Dry spare fruits that are liable to de- 
 cay. — Warinr/'s Hand book. 

Rose Insects. — If our lady readers are desirous of 
 keeping their rose bushes free from the small green 
 vermin that so frequently infest them, the following 
 remedy will be found a most effectual one : To 3 gal- 
 lons of water add one peck of soot and one quart of 
 unslacked lime. Stir it well — let it stand for twenty- 
 four hours, and when the soot rises to the surface, 
 skim it off. Use a syringe for applying it. 

Winter IIerhs. — The best time for gathering herb* 
 for winter use is when they are in blossom. If left 
 till they are in seed, the strength goes to the seed. — 
 They are best picked from the stalks, dried quickly 

I (but not burnt) before the fire, and rubbed into pow- 

jder, then buttled.
