Pennsylvania Barns> 

However much before us in agricultural improve- 
 ments generally, the Farmers of the States North and 
 East of us may perhaps be, we claim for Pennsylva- 
 nia the distinction of being the only State in the 
 union in which the building of good, substantial, con- 
 venient and spacious barns is understood and prac- 
 ticed. Properly speaking, in other States, they have 
 no barns — they don't know what a real gdod barn is 
 — a stable or collection of stables, sheds and out- 
 houses being their make-shift substitutes for them. — 
 This is a little singular, but is nevertheless true. A 
 journey through New York and New England, will 
 confirm our remarks. There is hardly a real barn to 
 be seen. Evidences of plenty there are, and of ex- 
 cellent farming. You see good houses, beautiful 
 shrubbery, admirable fences, clean and smooth 
 fields, splendid cattle, plenty of hay and grain stacks 
 — and lots of sheds and staljles ; but no barns. They 
 will have to come into Pennsylvania, and take a pat- 
 tern from some of our mighty bank-barns, looming 
 out in the horizon like doubled-dccked men-of-war be- 
 side sloops, or like churches beside log huts. As in 
 our war vessels, so in our barns also, we have botli 
 single and double-deckers, the latter being tremendous 
 affairs, that would make our eastern bretheru open 
 their eyes in astonishment. Above we present an en- 
 graving of one of the single-deckers — a most supurb 
 new Bank Barn, called a " Switzer" Barn, which was 
 recently erected upon the farm of the lion. A. 0. 
 llErsTER, on the Susquehanna, about three miles above 
 Ilarrisburg. 

This barn is one of the best and most convenient 
 on the Switzer plan, in this vicinity. It is about one 
 hundred feet in length, by about sixty feet in width, 
 and pioportionably high. It is built on a small hill 
 side, so that the front or barn floor is on a level with 
 the ground ; while the hill is dug away and the sta- 
 bles placed beneath. The rear of this stabling is 
 likewise on a level with the ground, though some ten 
 feet below the front level. The cut represents this 
 rear view only. As will be perceived, the barn has 
 an overshoot of seven feet, the stone-wall being 
 brought out flush the entire width, which is an im- 
 provement. The walls are eighteen inches thick, and 

rise ten feet up to the front level. The following is a 
 plan of the ground or stable floor :

The stone work is represented in the above plan, 
 by parallel lines. B is a false breast wall three feet 
 deep, a foot or two before I, the real front wall. F is 
 the feeding cellar, 10 feet by 20, where the feed for 
 the horses is mixed and prepared. P is the potatoe 
 cellar, 10 feet by 20, on the left hand. II. is the sta- 
 ble for the Farm Horses only, and A is a double 
 stalled division of the same, shut off from the rest of 
 the stable by a lattice door, intended as an hospital 
 or lying-in room for mares, the whole being about 
 15 J by 42 J : a and a are the feeding aisles or passag- 
 es.six feet wide. H on the right hand is another 
 Horse stable, containing six stalls. Here strange 
 horses are stabled. It is 15J feet by 42^ ; and the ox 
 and cow stables on the right hand side, marked 
 and C, are of like dimensions. G is a little room 4J 
 by 15}, where harness is kept. S is the straw room 
 from which the cows in C can be directly fed. is 
 the stable for stock cattle, p is the passage to the 
 turnip cellar. It is 7 feet wide, and separated from
