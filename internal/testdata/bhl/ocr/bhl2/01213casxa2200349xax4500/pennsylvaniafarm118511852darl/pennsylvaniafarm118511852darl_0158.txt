 ■well fjrouted — that is, stones are broken fine, evenly 
 spread, and liquid lime poured over them, which 
 makes them rat-proof. The stable floors are treated 
 in the same way. In each of the aisles marked a, 
 there is a continuous range of feeding lockers, on 
 one side, in which oats, corn, or prepared feed may 
 be kept ready for feeding at any time. In the pass- 
 age marked p, are steps to ascend to the second floor.

AN ESSAY ON THE EXTERNAL FORMATION OK 

STRUCTURE OF THE HORSE, AND ON THE 

DISORDERS ORIGINATI.\G THEREIN. 

G and 6, are the granaries. D, D and D, are the 
 barn doors, extending from ground to roof, F, F and 
 F, are the threshing floors. M and M, are the hay 
 or grain mows. The partitions dividing the floors 
 and the mows are 43^ feet long, extending across the 
 barn to within 7 feet of the rear wall, and commenc- 
 ing 3.5 feet from the front : s. ■?, represents the stair- 
 ways into the stables below. The turnip cellar below, 
 is tilled through the traps in this barn floor. The 
 Granaries have an area about the same as the Potatoe 
 and Feeding cellars below. The indentation between 
 the granaries, up to the barn doors, is about 6 feet. — 
 The roof overshoots this recess about 3 feet. 

The cost of this barn was about $1,500. It is 
 weather-boarded on the outside — painted white — fur- 
 nished with ventilators, lightning rods, and every 
 minor improvement. 

[The double wall (B) is necessary to prevent the 
 great pressure of the bank from causing the inner 
 wall to give way. The advantage of three thrashing 
 floors is, that the two lateral ones may at first be filled 
 with the unthrashed grain, the central one being first 
 used for its proper purpose in thrashing from the side 
 floors, which, in their turn, are used for thrashing 
 the grain stored in the side mows (these being seldom 
 filled with hay) or in the loft over the floora. — ^Ed.]

The tail, in regard to the manner in which it is 
 set on, is not to be overlooked: a horse that carries 
 two good ends, (of which the head forms one, and tail 
 the other,) always looks grand — is a perfect gentle- 
 man in his appearance. Above all others, the char- 
 ger should possess this point in perfection, to coin- 
 cide with the grandeur of his carriage in the ostenta- 
 tious parade of a field-day. Ilinc bellator cquus 
 campo scse arduus infcrt. The tail, in most horses, 
 should form, when elevated, a straight line, or nearly 
 so, with the back. A gentle declivity of the croup, 
 however, from the summit of the rump, denotes tho 
 blood-like quarter, and adds much grace to this part 
 in the thorough-bred: should this line decline very 
 much, the horse is said to be droop-arsed, and the 
 quarters lose much of their beauty as well as their 
 natural power. Nothing is so ugly in a full quarter- 
 ed horse, as to see the tail set on low down, issuing 
 abruptly from the rump, as if a broomstick had been 
 stuck in the place. The dealers who indiscriminately 
 fig all, often spoil tho sale of a horso of this descrip- 
 tion by curling the tail upward with a dose of ginger. 
 Some liorses carry a good tail naturally — others, by 
 means of art, having undergone the operation called 
 nicking. Gingery or peppery hackneys seldom re- 
 quire nicking : indeed, hackneys are often called, 
 from this circumstance, cock-tails, in contradistinc 
 tion to thorough-breds, who seldom or never carry 
 any but a drooping-tail, better known by the name 
 of blood-tail ; a cocked-tail would be incompatible 
 with a blood-quarter; hence it is that blood horse.s 
 should never be figged or nicked. 

The quarters may be full, small, or fine and blood- 
 like. Full quarters arc such as are possessed by 
 cart-horses, large machine-horses, and hackneys able 
 to carry great weight. These horses are wide in tho 
 hips, though their hips are but indistinctly marked, 
 in consequence of being enveloped by large, coarse, 
 flabby muscles. People are too apt to regard wide 
 hips as an objectionable point, from their giving to 
 the horse that appearance called ragged hips, which, 
 indeed, are not only ugly, but denote bad conforma- 
 tion, though, of themselves, they denote good make; 
 for the fact is that ragged hips are produced by a 
 bad loin, and a lank, flat and weak quarter. Were 
 these parts well formed, we should pronounce the 
 hips to be of the best description. The small quarter 
 is one that is often seen in a horse of this form; 
 though the general contour of it may be regular and 
 uniform, it is altogether disproportionately small 
 when compared with the carcass: if it grows narrow 
 toward the hinder part, the animal is often said to bo 
 goose-rumpe<l. But, of all other structures, the blood- 
 like quarter is the liest adapted for speed: in it tho 
 tail is set on high up, and the hips are high and pro- 
 minent, but not ragged ; so that many of our racers 
 arc higher behind than before, the spaces between 
 them and the points of the quarters great, as are also 
 those between the latter parts and the stifles ; the 
 haunches want the plumpness and roundness of the 
 full quarter; but, so far from being either lank or 
 thin, are striped with bold and prominent muscles, 
 which, being free from adipose and cellular substance 
 that constitutes the flabbiness of those of the fall
