quarter, are so distinet, even through the skin, that 
 we can distinguish where one ends and another be- 
 gins. The stifles should project boldly forward, and 
 have a perceptible irregularity of surface. The thighs 
 are good, when long, thick and muscular; little hil- 
 locks, or rotundities, upon them, mark the course of 
 muscles, and always denote great power; the nearer 
 tlie angles which they form with the parts above and 
 below approach to right angles, the more force the 
 muscles can exert ; ergo, the more powerful the 
 horse. The hock, of all other parts is in the racer 
 of the utmost importance ; it should be broad, flat, 
 and of large dimensions. The propulsion of the ma- 
 chine is effected chiefly by those muscles that are at- 
 tached to the point of the hock ; so that the more 
 projecting this is, the greater the force they can exert, 
 simply on the principle of the lever: as a man with 
 a long oar can row with more facility and eft'ect than 
 he who uses the short one, or scull, so can a horse with 
 broad, projecting hocks get over the ground with 
 comparative ease to himself, and pleasure to his rider. 
 The advantages the half-bred horse with good hocks 
 possesses as a hunter, are of no less moment than 
 those a good hock confers upon a racer: his great 
 propelling powers will enable him to clear his rasp- 
 ers* with so much grace that the rider will find it a 
 difficult matter to pound hira,t and empowers him to 
 make such play in the mud as will soon sew up his 
 lank-thighed and straight-hocked competitors. The 
 point of the hock cannot stand out too much ; indeed, 
 the greater its dimensions, altogether, the better, pro- 
 vided it be not gummy, or that its various bony pro- 
 jections and sinewy parts be distinctly seen or felt. 
 If the hock is narrow, its point round, and not well 
 defined, it is said to be straight, and from being very 
 liable to curbs, is often called a curby-hock : should 
 it« point be directed inward, and the toes turned out- 
 ward, the horse is cow-hocked or catrhammed. As 
 this is a part very liable to defect, as well as to origi- 
 nal malformation, the nicest examination is required 
 to detect all that may prove disadvantageous or inju- 
 rious to its function, the proper performance of which 
 is of so much importance that the propulsion of the 
 whole machine depends chiefly upon it. 

Remarks ox the purchase of a Horse. — Having 
 selected a horse who.se make pleases us, our next 
 consideration is his soundness; for though the horse 
 dealer may declare that he is as sound as a bell, we 
 are to take the phrase as one having various mean- 
 ings, and not to be deterred from examining him, 
 and narrowly, too, on that account. Sight, wind and 
 limb, must be the uppermost objects of inquiry; for 
 nine hundred horses out of a thousand are defective 
 in one of these particulars. First, then examine his 
 eyes, and do this before he comes out of the stable. 
 Having placed him so that the light may fall upon 
 the eyes but in one direction, see that they are 
 of the same size, and equally full ; that the haws are 
 not prominent, and that one does not project more 
 than the other : that the eyes are perfectly clear and 
 transparent; and that the pupils, or apples of the 
 eyes, are exactly alike in size as well as color. A 
 sunken eye, or one over which the lids are partly 
 closed — a pnjecting haw — an opaque or semi-opaque 
 frontj — a pupil dilated or a white or clouded one — 
 are so many omens of disease, for which we should 
 reject the prad as a cupid,| or, what is often worse, a 

blinker, who will shy at all he meets with, and break 
 your neck at the first poser* you ride him at. Hav- 
 ing satisfied yourself in regard to his peepers, have 
 him pulled out, and next pioceed to examine his 
 pipes. If good and sound, on being nipped in the 
 gullet, he will utter such a sound as cannot fail to 
 strike the ear as the emission of a good pair of bel- 
 lows; but if his lungs are touched, and he is a piper, 
 (that is, broken-winded, or having no wind at all,) he 
 will give vent to a dry, husky, shcrt cough. Should 
 a horse be suspected of bad wind, however, the pur- 
 chaser cannot do better than direct his attention to 
 the flanks, which, under such circumstances, will 
 work either much quicker than ordinarily, or heave 
 deeply, and with great irregularity; they will be con- 
 siderably longer in contracting themselves, in order 
 to squeeze the wind out.f than in falling to let it in,t 
 which they do, if he is a poser, quite suddenly. But, 
 though not a piper, he may be a whistler, or what is 
 worse, a roarer: the first may bo known by the pecu- 
 liar wheezing he is addicted to when put to sudden 
 or long-continued exertion ; the latter, by blowing his 
 horn clamorously under similar circumstances; and 
 either may be made to display itself, by the purcha- 
 ser giving him a smart cut, or even feigning to do so 
 with his bit of ash. 

Thirdly, and lastly, as to the limbs. If, in passing 
 your hand down his legs, we find any unnatural pro- 
 tuberance or puffiness, or if, in feeling first one leg 
 and then the other, we find any difference between 
 them, disease, more or less, is present; he may not 
 be lame, but he is not clean upon his legs. Splents, 
 windgalls, and ringbones may be present without oc- 
 casioning lameness, but they are all unnatural, are 
 considered blemishes, and are all to be regarded with 
 a suspicious eye, as cither denoting past hard work, 
 or betokening future evils. On the same principle, a 
 horse may have a spavin, and be only stiff from it at 
 starting, or he may have a curb, or a thorough pin, 
 and be perfectly sound ; but these are still blemishes, 
 and as such detract from the intrinsic value of the 
 animal. In explaining the advantages resulting from 
 good conformation, we are naturally led to make re- 
 marks en passant, on the disadvantages from bad; in 
 pursuance whereof 1 have shown why such a struc- 
 ture is bad, a question that necessarily entails upon 
 us the mention of the disorders originating therein ; 
 i. e. the diseases to which such parts, in consequence 
 of being malformed, are predisposed. Inofes.

To THE Editor of the Farm Journal — Dear Sir : 
 I have a fresh Cow that gives her quantum of milk 
 in the evening, and falls off in the morning, not giv- 
 ing more than half a pint. I may here state, that 
 so far as can bo discovered, she has not got it to give 
 It is not taken from her either by herself or by other 
 visible means, as measures have been taken to detect 
 them if any such existed. This state of things has 
 continued for one week previously to which all was 
 right. Can you or any of your subscribers account 
 for it? The Cow apparently is in good health. 

Yours, respectfully, A Subscribkr. 

[The cow is probably not in perfect health. Let 
 her be fed when being milked. See Mr. Morris's re- 
 medy in our laat number. — Ed.]
