How to double the circulation of the Karm Journal. 

We once read an article, (where, we do not remem- 
 ber,) in which the writer laid down certain rules, by 
 which to get subscribers to an agricultural paper. — 
 Some of the suggestions struck us so forcibly that the 
 impressions made upon us have not yet been forgotten, 
 and we now give them to our readers, with the hope 
 that they will act upon them in behalf of the Farm 
 •Journal. 

When you meet a neighbor who does not take an 
 agricultural paper, instead of discussing some of the 
 unprofitaV)le topics of the day, introduce the subject 
 of agriculture — the improvements making every day 
 in farming, and let your neighbor know how much 
 of this spirit of progress is attributable to "book 
 farming." 

If in reading the Farm Journal, you chance to find 
 something not exactly adapted to j'our soil and loca- 
 tion, do not on this account condemn the whole work, 
 but remember that everything contained in it is not 
 intended to benefit yourself only. Your neighbors' 
 interests must be looked to a little. Sit down and 
 read the whole of it carefully, and our word for it, 
 you will find something to interest and perhaps ben- 
 efit you, and if in reading you chance to meet an ar- 
 ticle that will be of service to your non-subscribing 
 neighbor, read it to him, or lend him the number that 
 he may read for himself. 

Should you meet with a valuable suggestion (and 
 every farmer will meet with many such) and put it 
 into practical use ; when you have seen and tested 
 the value of it, do not keep it a secret, but let your 
 non-subscribing neighbor know what it is, and that 
 you learned it in the Farm Journal. 

If you feel desirous of getting up a club for the 
 Farm Journal in your vicinity, take the subscription 
 paper in your hand— head the list with your own 
 name — when you meet a neighbor tell him of the 
 advantages of agricultural papers — point to the im- 
 provements those farmers are making who subscribe 
 for and read them — tell him of the advantage they 
 will be to his family— if he is a Pennsylvanian, ap- 

peal to his State pride — make him aware of the fact 
 that the Farm Journal is the only strictly agricultu- 
 ral journal published in the State — that its articles 
 are written principally by practical men, familiar 
 with the soil of Pennsylvania and the proper modn 
 of its culture, and be careful to impress upon his 
 mind that by making one of your club list, ho will 
 receive the Journal fur one year at a cost of only 
 seveniy-five cents, and in a form fit for binding, and 
 that at the end of the year he will have a volume of 
 three hundred and eighty-four pages, replete with 
 valuable and interesting information. By this meaiw 
 four out of every five will subscribe, and in a little 
 while your club will be fall. 

Perhaps, good reader, jou will ask, "why should 
 we take so much trouble on ourselves ?" To speak 
 candidly it would not pay you very well. But, kind 
 friends, remember, that we should not live wholly for 
 ourselves. Our neighbors have a claim upon our re- 
 gards — the great agricultural interests of our noble 
 State are not yet half developed — Pennsylvania does 
 does not occupy the position she should, and it is 
 your duty, as we feel it to be ours, to labor for her 
 advancement. AVill j'ou not assist us? After the 
 first j'ear you will have no difficulty, for the day is 
 coming when scientific agriculture, or "book farm- 
 ing" as it is called, will so fixr take the precedence 
 of the old, worn out practice, that few men will hesi- 
 tate to subscribe. 

Fine Wool. — AVe were shown, a few days since, a 
 sample of wool, which for fineness exceeds any that 
 we have ever seen. It was taken from the fleece of 
 an imported German buck, the property of Dr. J. 
 Trissler, of Vienna, Ontario county. New Y'ork. The 
 entire fleece weighed ten pounds four ounces. Dr. 
 T. imported the buck himself, and paid for him |300. 
 As we understand it is the Dr.'s intention to remove 
 to Lancaster county, we hope he will make it a point 
 to bring this valuable animal with him. 

A Generous Offer. — Mr. Samuel Pelton, a gentle- 
 man who feels a deep interest in horticultural pur- 
 suits, has authorized us to say that during his stay 
 in the Gennesse valley, where he now is, he will make 
 arrangements to have forwarded to Lancaster, cut- 
 tings and scions of the finest fruits of that region of 
 country; and that they will be furnished to those de- 
 siring them, at the mere cost of transportation. This 
 is very liberal on the part of BIr. P. and we hope the 
 oflfer will be embraced by many of our fruit growers, 

A band of emigrants from Sweden, numbering one 
 hundred and eighteen, passed through Boston lately 
 on their waj' to the west, where they intend to en- 
 gage in agricultural pursuits. The procession was 
 led off by thirteen wagons filled with baggage, wifh 
 the women and children on the top. The men fol- 
 lowed, many of them with their guns.
