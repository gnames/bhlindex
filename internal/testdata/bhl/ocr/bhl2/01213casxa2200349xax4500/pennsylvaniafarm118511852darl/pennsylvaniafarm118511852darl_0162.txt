Coustitutlou of the Peiiiisylvauia State Agricultu- 
 ral Society. 

N We publish bolow the Constitution of the State 
 Society, and the names of its officers. We vrould at 
 at the same time, press upon those who liave not al- 
 ready done .so, the importance of becoming members. 
 If Pennsylvania is ever to assume her rightful posi- 
 tion in an agricultural point of view, she can do so 
 only through the medium of such an organization. — 
 We are not among those who are continually under- 
 rating the skill of our formers and artisans ; our con- 
 fident belief being, that Pennsylvania farming will 
 compare favorably with that of any of her sister 
 States. It has not been the want of thorough and 
 practically applied knowledge of farming and its 
 kindred pursuits, that has given our State a reputa- 
 tion for being somewhat less advanced in agriculture 
 than Now York, Massachusetts and others, but it is 
 the fact that the yeomanry of Pennsylvania have not 
 toasted so loudly of their proficiency. Were the im- 
 mense yields of some oi our noble farms as faithfully 
 recorded, the portraits of our fine stock as frequently 
 given, and the principle of putting " the best foot 
 foremost" as generally adopted as by our northern 
 neighbors, there would be less cry about the back- 
 wardness of Pennsylvania agriculture. 

It is for the purpose of convincing the world that 
 such is the case, that the Fair or Exhibition to be 
 held at Harrisburg, under the auspices of the State 
 Society, has been proposed, and it is the earnest hope 
 of every friend of agriculture, that our formers and 
 mechanics will propcr'y appreciate the opportunity 
 afibrded them of rebuking those who have sneeringly 
 pointed to Pennsylvania as greatly behind the age. 
 We predict, that if any thing like a fair representa- 
 tion of the agricultural and mechanical skill of our 
 citizens (to say nothing of the taste and ingenuity 
 of our ladies in all that relates to household economy) 
 be given, that hereafter there will be fewer fault- 
 finders. It is with a deep, longing desire, therefore, 
 to have the farmer.s of the Keystone, placed in their 
 rightful position before the agricultural world, that 
 we urge one and all to prepare their contributions 
 for the coming exhibition. Ample preparatioas have 
 been made for the accommodation and display of all 
 that may be brought, and nothing will be left undone 
 to render the whole affair one that will reflect credit 
 upon all concerned. 

Then let the hands of the State Society be strength- 
 ened, and its efforts ably and cheerfully seconded. — 
 Let the yeomanry come to the rescue, and the 23d, 
 24th and 25th days of October, will be a proud era 
 in the history of Pennsylvania.
