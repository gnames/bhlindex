Education and tlie Agricultural Press. 

The following truthful remarks on the subject of 
 agricultural education and the importance of the 
 agricultural press, we copy from the admirable ad- 
 dress of Dr. J. A. Kennicott, of Korthfield, 111., de- 
 livered before the American Pomological Congress, at 
 'iinclnnati, on the 3d of October, 1850. We regret 
 that we have not space for the whole of the address, 
 as it abounds in useful and interesting information. 

The first and last thing wanted by the farmer, is 
 I'dvcation — knowledge. In this we can assist him — 
 and what we can do we should do in this connection. 
 Agricultural and horticultural societies, have done 
 much towards waking up and encouraging all who 
 labor for bread — the mechanic, as well as the farmer 
 and pomologist. At the shows of these societies, our 
 bretfiren see what others have done, and what science 
 may do. And the people of the " universal Yankee 
 nation," are very apt to believe, that " what man has 
 done, man can do again." Thousands are annually 
 startled from their old routine practice, by what they 
 see at these exhibitions, and try to imitate or excel 
 the products of the farm, or the work-shop, which 
 have thus excited their professional emulation. 

Let us therefore lielp to establish county and State 
 societies throught the land, and let us add one fea- 
 ture to them, which most of those in existence now 
 lack — not exactly lectures, but brief observations on 
 every new or extraordinary subject. This may be 
 done, by a system of familiar questions put to every 
 exhibitor, by the proper officers of the society, ancJ 
 publicly answered. 

I have read reports of such public conversations, 
 in the proceedings of the American^Institute, New 
 "York city, and some other societies. This mode of 
 conveying information, though not always as clear 
 and reliable as written statements, possesses many 
 adv.antages. Let it be generally adopted, and much 
 good will result therefrom, and the persons who can- 
 not or will not read, may possess themselves of a few 
 tacts on which to base their own experiments. 1 have 
 heard of the adoption of this plan in small neighbor- 
 hoods, without shows, and with the happiest and most 
 encouraging results. 

But after all, our principal engine, is the agrimil- 
 tural press. The press may have been brought into 
 existence by the societies', though that admits of 
 doubt. The press is, however, tlie organ, and the 
 very soul of the associations. Man is a vain animal, 
 and loves to see himself "in print," and he often 
 works hard, and effects much good, with that power- 
 ful, that unacknowledged desire. 

The agricultural press must be sustained. Public 
 opinion is the true sovereign of the Anglosaxon ; 
 and he will give even money, (which is too often his 
 (Jod,) to propitiate it. Say what we may about the 
 press being but the mirror of public opinion, it cer- 
 tainly creates as well as reflects that mighty power. 

Let us sustain then our agricultural journals. If 
 wo cannot give money, as puliticians do to theirs, we 
 can give a little time. Many of us have influence 
 and powers of persuasion. Let us exert those with 
 our neighbors, and procure legitimate subscriptions 
 — knowing as we do, that for every dollar we induce 

our brethern to disburse, they will receive the value 
 of ten, in useful knowledge. 

The agricultural press is now the most efficient and 
 legitimate advocate of common school and specific ao-- 
 ricultural education ; and this is a subject of more 
 general and vital importance, than all the agricultu- 
 ral bureaus and societies in the world. 

The farmer's son must be educated for his profes- 
 sion — the mechanic for his calling, and the voter 
 for the perpetuation and extension of our free insti- 
 tutions, and "the manifest destiny" of the Anglo- 
 Saxon race. 

And better than our sons, should we educate our 
 DAUonTERS. If " the boy is f;ither to the man," the 
 MOTHER not only bends the twig, but her infiuenoe for 
 good or for evil, is often the joint product of both 
 parents, or the future career of the son, as palpable 
 as the successful graft of the pippin on the crab, or a 
 melting pear on a native thorn. 

Do not for a moment, suppose that I believe the 
 mind of man like this paper, on which I can write 
 what thoughts I please. Men are as different in men- 
 tal organization as in features. And yet, even id- 
 iots are susceptible of some education ; and pippins 
 will sometimes grow when inoculated on crabs, and 
 pears on thorns, though not on hemlocks or black 
 jacks. 

Scientific education can do much towards redeem- 
 ing a bare or sterile mind ; and it can do every thing 
 with that on which God smiled at its inception and 
 developement. But without education, this child of 
 the deity will be but as the statue in the block of 
 marble, or this paper, before it was blotted by my 
 uneducated speculations, and chance thoughts, which 
 the very system I advocate, might have converted in- 
 to gems of beauty and usefulness. 

Agricultural education may be thought, (as some 
 who live by agriculturists have said,) "one of the 
 humbugs of the ago." Still it is a principle that I 
 hope to see tested before I die. I would ask no larg- 
 er hold on fame, than I could rest on the broad re- 
 sults of such a system as I advocate. But. alas, my 
 powers in this, as in most things, are far below my 
 enthusiasm and my appreciation of the great thoughts 
 of other men. But, thank God, great men and men 
 in power see this matter in its true light, and have 
 dared to countenance and sustain it, even against self- 
 nominated legislators, who neglect our interests, and 
 self-constituted manufacturers of public opinion, who 
 underrate or slight them. 

A First Rate Drill. 
 We take pleasure in commending to such of our 
 readers as may desire a first rate drill, those of 
 Moore's patent, manufactured by Messrs. Lee, Pierce 
 & Lee, of Ercildoun, Chester county. They are su- 
 perior in all that constitutes a good drill, and cost 
 only a little more than half the price of the drills 
 heretofore used. Their simplicity will at once re- 
 commend them, apart from the fact that the work 
 performed by them is fully equal to that of any other 
 with which we are acquainted. 

Blue Rose. — The horticulturists of Paris, says a 
 correspondent of the N. Y. Express, have succeeded 
 by artificial crossings in obtaining a natural rose of 
 a blue color, which is the fourth color obtained by 
 artificial means — the yellow, or tea rose, tlie black, 
 or purple rose, and the striped rose, being all inven- 
 tions, and the result of skilful scientific gardening.
