 tilizing gases are absorbed, fixed, and are given out to vege- 
 tation only as It requires them. No rot, mildew, worm, tly oc 
 other insect can approach it: an iiiportant consideration tofarmers 
 generally, but particularly in potato planting It will be admirably 
 adapted to the renovation, restoration and fertilizing of such lands 
 as have been worn out. 

It m;(y be used broadcast, after the ground is ploughed, and then 
 harrowed in with the seed. Tt is also valuable as a top dressing.

 Wheat, Tobacco, Garden Vegetables, Rye, Oats, Green House
