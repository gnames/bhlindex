IMPORTANT TO FARMERS 
 And Tliresbiii^ Iflacliine Makers* 

TF1E subscriber respectfully big.s leave to inform the public 
 that he has lately perfected a new Threshing Machine and Horse 
 Power, which in point of strength, durability, lightness of draught 
 and convcuience in moving is not surpassed or equalled by any 
 Machine in the United States; he also confidently affirms that no 
 Machine of its strength and durability can be afforded as low — 
 The invention of this Machine has been the result of several 
 years experience and hard study We do not claim to have dis- 
 covered any new principle in philosophy — but we declaim to have 
 discovered a plan by which old jihilosnphical principles are more 
 correctly and advantageously applied than on any other Machine 
 This invention is feeured by a caveat. 

These Machines can be had at Israel \V. GrofTs Machine Shop 
 and at Prime & Colestock's Sash Factory in North Duke street, 
 Lancaster city, at retail or by wholesale on the most reasonable 
 terms. 

The Power wigbs 600 pound*. It is made entirely of Iron with 
 Steel Journals, and is warranted to hold 8 Horses should it any 
 time be necessary t(j use so many. From 2 to 4 Horses are a suffic- 
 ient number for common threshing. We are about getting up 
 one much lighter for Shop purposes that will be the cheapest and 
 must convenient thing in ut^e; it might also be used with 2 or 3 
 Hor.scs for threshing; the Powers and Cylinders .and Concave can 
 be had by the Machine makers throughout the couutry on tho 
 most reasonable terms. 

tJF5=- -^11 orders directed to the subscrilier at Lancaster city will 
 be thank fully received aud promptly attended to,

 has been in successful operation for upwards of Sixty Ytars, 
 aud may be said to have grown up with the I'ity of Philadelphia, 
 where it was at first located. It has been gradually enl'rged to 
 meet the growing wants of the imltlic, aud is now, as it ever has 
 been, the most extensive of its kind in this country. The grounds 
 in cultivation being ten-fold greater than those ol any similar 
 concern in the United States.
