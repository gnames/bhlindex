These Horse Powers and Threshers are favorably Known where- 
 cver they liave been used or exhibited. They have taken premi- 
 lums at many different State and County Agricultural Kurs. in 
 different States in the Union, and also in Curotiiia, never having 
 competed for a prize unsuccessfully. 

The accompanying Cut gives a side view of a Two-Horse Ma- 
 chine at work, with the hands necessary to attend it, and keep it 
 in full operation, and will thresh from 100 to 200bushelsof Wheat, 
 or twice thiit <iuantity of Oats, Buckwheat or Barley, per day.— 
 The One-Horse or Single Machine will thresh half as last as the 
 douole fines 

Thk Overshot Thresher takes the grain from a level feeding 
 table (of a proper height to allow the feeder to stand erect and 
 feed without annoyance from dust,) by means of the Separalion. 
 The Straw, as it comes from the machnie, is thoroughly separated 
 from the grain.

Kettlevrell & Davison's Salts against 
 Guauo. 

A CHALLENGE ! ! ! 

THE deep intcrept now taken by Agriculturists in all descrip- 
 tions of manure, would seem to justify any expedient, by 
 which fair nud unprejudiced experiments may be made of the va- 
 rious descriptions of manure at thi.s time attractin(; the attention 
 of the public. In view of this, and the undersigned honestly be- 
 lieving that the Chemical Compound, manufactured by them, ie 
 the bi'et manure of which any knowledge is had for a Corn Crop; 
 challenges Guano to the test upon the following condition: — He 
 will forfeit One Hundred Dollars, to be presented to the Maryland 
 .Agricultural Society, if any advocate of Guauo will do the same, 
 that the Renovator compounded by Ketth-well & Davison, will 
 produce upon any soil, the largest crop ot weighed corn, without 
 regard to the si'/.a of the .«talk. provided the President of the State 
 Agricultural Society will select some person, in his judgment 
 qualified, to superintend the experiment The nature of the soil 
 to be described, so that each party can direct the mode ol appli- 
 cation; two barrels of the Salts to be used per acre, costing J6, 
 and 300 lbs. of the Guano, costing $7 20. the psirty making the 
 experiment to receive the manure tree ot cost. And the same 
 amuuut against auy manure as a top dressing upon timothy or 
 clover. John Kettlewell. 

Kettleioell .J- Dart ion again call the attention of Agriculturists 
 to their various Chemical Manures — and in 80 doing, they would 
 be insensible to common gratitude, if they failed to express their 
 profound acknowledgments for the constant and increasing de- 
 mand, which tlows in upon them for their simple and compound 
 manures. Each season has greatly increased their sales, extend- 
 ing as far south as South Carolina. 

'I'hey can give no strongej evidence of their faith in the vir- 
 tius ol their manure, as the best known for a corn crop, than the 
 tenders they make above ; and the certificates which they here- 
 with i)refent. In the offer of a test, it is not the amount involT- 
 cd. but the willingness to challenge result, that speaks their in- 
 tegrity and confidence. We could add any amount to the testi- 
 mony we publish; but if the names we refer to. do not command 
 confidence, no additional number could. We have never boasted 
 of the quality of our article, we have been content to leave a de- 
 cision to time, demand and experiment, that has been in our fa- 
 vor—hoping, if we have less ol " Bi-phospbates," the public would 
 discover it, as they would if it was found we had more of ' sand ■' 
 than any thing elsi*. Kkttlkwkll, k 1>.\tison.

Bl-PHUSPHATES. 

We keep constantly on hand this valuable manure. Bonep, 
 with a proper portion of the Sulphate of Ammonia, dissolved in 
 Sulphuric Acid. The Chemists of this country and Europe have 
 been pre.-^sing this mode of using bone-du.st upon the attcrf- 
 tion of farmers, with great zeal and ability of recent years. Ev- 
 ery e.Kperiment has confirmed the truthfulness of their theory; 
 and we hazard hut little in saying that in a very brief time it 
 will be used in no other way. It is prepared so as to be sown sim 
 ilar to the salts, at the rate of one or two barrels to the acre — 
 The price of this article is $4 per barrel. Let the farmer who 
 doubts, try it at a less expense than the old mode of using bone- 
 dust.

We have constantly on hand Chemical Residiums of every

COMBINATION OF GROUND PLASTER AND 
 POTASH. 

This is a preparation made for soil deficient in Potash, of which 
 deficiency there is. unfortunately, too many instances in much of 
 our Maryland land. For this compound we are indebted to the 
 suggestion of an accomplished Agriculturist of Prince George^s 
 county, who may at some future day present the result of his ex- 
 periment. The price of this is $2 50 per barrel. 

DIRECTIONS. 

The mode of using the Renovator is simple, inexpensive, and 
 requiring but little labor. The farmer must bear in mind, that 
 in the preparation of his soil he shares an equai responsibility in 
 testing the merits of any manure. Land negligently or badly 
 cultivated gives no manure a fair chance. How to put land in or- 
 der he ought to know better than we can teach him; and if he 
 don't know, should learn as speedily as possible. The land, then, 
 in order— if one barrel lo the acre is used— and this quantity de- 
 pends upon the quality of the land — it should, for grain be sown 
 broad cast, and blightly harrowed in. 

If two barrels are used, one as stated above, and the other aj; a 
 kop-dressing upon the wheat or rye, early in the spring at tb« 
 commencement of the first thaw. Upon grass it should be sown 
 brond-caiit upon the timothy or clover. On corn, either broad- 
 east or in the hill. Where two barrels are need, one each way
