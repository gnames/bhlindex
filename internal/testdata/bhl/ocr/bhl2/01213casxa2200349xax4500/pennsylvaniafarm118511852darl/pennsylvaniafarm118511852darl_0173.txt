The coleopterous insects termed Lamellicornia have 
 the end of the antennce thickened, and the joints of 
 this part formed of three or more fiat plates closing 
 apiinst each other like the leaves of a book. 

Some of these insects are very destructive to vege- 
 tation, by eating the roots, leaves and flowers. The 
 roots are eaten by the larvse, which are grubs, and 
 are well known as thick white worms bent in a semi- 
 circle, which causes them to lie upon one side. Va" 
 rious kinds are formed in dung, both in the larva and 
 perfect state, some are formed in decaying vegetable 
 matter, and others attack roots when larvae, and leaves 
 and flowers in their perfect state. 

Some of these larvEc are 
 very destructive to pastures 
 and growing grain, from the 
 extent to which they destroy 
 the roots. This may be 
 judged from the fact that in 
 England two men collected 
 eighty bushels of the perfect 
 insects during ths short pe- 
 riod of their appearance. 
 In this country various 
 species of Pliyllopliaga are found, most of which are 
 hurtful. They are generally of a chesnut or brown 
 color, and may be recognised from the figure. In 
 digging or plowing in April, they are frequently met 
 with, ready to make their exit. 

It is possible that early spring, or late fall plowing, 
 by throwing the grubs within reach of the frosts, 
 when too helpless to bury themselves deeper, would 
 de.stroy a great many of them. Various birds, as the 
 crow and blackbird, follow the plowman to feed upon 
 them ; and it is probable that molea devour them, as 
 these little animals feed upon food of this kind.

Hand picking, with burning or scalding, is the 
 best mode yet known to destroy these insects in their 
 perfect condition. They are generally inactive in the 
 morning, when they be shaken from the fruit trees 
 and vines, without inducing them to fly. Being noc- 
 turnal, this inaction may arise from full feeding, and 
 a disposition to rest after a night of acti^^ty. 

Iiotteries. 

Various States of the Union passed laws against 
 lottery gambling, even before it was ascertained that 
 these contrivances could be conducted in such a man- 
 ner as to convert them into swindling engines of the 
 first class, and make lottery dealers more dangerous 
 members of society than counterfeiters or professed 
 gamblers. 

Among the means adopted for protecting the po- 
 pulation, the law of Pennsylvania forbids the adver- 
 thimj of lotteries, because it was foreseen not to do 
 this, was merely to change the scene of the plunder 
 from Pennsylvania Vo a neighboring State. 

These remarks are made in consequence of havinf 
 received through th» mail, two documents, one of 
 which is a sheet called Semi-monthly Couranf, pub- 
 lished by nobody and ostensibly at Jersey city. I n- 
 dcr the garb of a newspaper, it is a trap baited with 
 lottery advertisements by one Carroll, who has a dtn 
 in Courtlandt street. New York, whence he annojs 
 the citizens of Pennsylvania. The other document 
 comes as a letter and is of a similar character. It 
 purports to be from one Leary, of Frederick, Mary- 
 land. Although there is said to be honor among 
 *******, neither of these favors was prepaid. 

We caution our readers against encouraging lot- 
 teries, even as an experiment. If any one can spare 
 the amount necessary to buy a ticket, he had better 
 bestow it in charity. The entire system is criminal ; 
 the ticket_^seller instead of showing himself openly 
 like an hopest man doing an honest business, cur- 
 tains his window, and his deluded victim skulks be- 
 hind a screen to hide himself from the passers by.
