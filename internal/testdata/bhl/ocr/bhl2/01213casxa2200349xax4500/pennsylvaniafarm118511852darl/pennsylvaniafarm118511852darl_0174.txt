Congress institutes or permits lotteries, and higher- 
 law virtue never protests; probably because it has 
 discovered the perfect morality and honesty of the 
 lottery system ; like the newspapers of Washington 
 city, in which the drawings are advertised and sent 
 into the anti-gambling States.

We are gratified to inform our readers that the 
 trustees intend to found an agricultural professorship 
 in this institution, which should be a strong argument 
 in favor of the college in Lancaster county, the pro- 
 posed seat of its new location. We hope therefore 
 that the citizens of the county at large will feel suf- 
 ficient interest in this important undertaking to in- 
 duce them to subscribe liberally towards its accom- 
 plishment. 

In what state should liime be applied { 

W. II., of Bedford, wishes to know, " whether lime 
 should be plowed under in a caustic state, rather 
 than being exposed to the atmosphere previous to the 
 plowing down?" The most satisfactory answer wc 
 can give to this query will be found in Johnson's 
 Agricultural Chemistry, from which valuable work 
 we copy the following: 

The form and state of combination in which lime 
 ought to be applied to the land depend upon the na- 
 ture of the soil, the kind of cropping to which it is 
 subjected, aud on the special purpose which the lime 
 is intended to efiect. The soil may be heavy or light, 
 in arable culture, or laid do-n-n to grass, and each of 
 these constitutes a difierent mode of procedure in the 
 application of lime. So the lime itself may be intend- 
 ed either to act more immediately or to be more per- 
 manent in its action — or it may be applied for the 
 purpose of destroying unwholesome herbage, of quick- 
 ening inert vegetable matter, of generally sweetening 
 the soil, or simply of adding to the land a substance 
 which is indispensable to its fertility. The skilful 
 agriculturist will modify the form and mode of ap- 
 plication according as it is intended to serve one or 
 other of these purposes. 

Fiom the considerations already presented to you 
 (' 3) in regard to the changes which quick-lime un- 
 dergoes in the air, it appears to be expedient, 

1°. To slake lime quickly, and to apply it imme- 
 diately upon clay, boggy, marshy, or peaty lands — 
 upon such as contain much inert or generally which 
 aoouud in other forms of vegetable matter. 

2°. To bents and heaths which it is desirable to 
 extirpate, it should be applied in the same caustic 
 state, or to unwholesome subsoils which contain 
 much iron (sulphate of iron), as soon as they are 
 turned up by thi- plow. In both those cases the un- 
 slaked lime-dust from the kilns might be laid on with 
 advantage. 

3°. Where it is to be spread OTer grass lands with- 
 out destroying the herbage, it is in most cases safer 
 to allow the lime to slake spontaneously, rather than 
 in a covered pit. It is thus obtained in an exceed 
 ingly fine powder, which can be easily spread, and, 
 while it is sufficiently mild to leave the tender grasses 
 unharmed, it contains a sufficient quantity of caustic 
 lime to produce those chemical changes in the soil 
 on which the efficacy of quick-lime depends. 
 4°. Where hme is appUod to the fallow, ia plowed 

in, well harrowed, or otherwise mixed with the soil, 
 it is generally of little consequence in which of the 
 above states it is laid on. The chief condition is, that 
 it be in the state of a fine powder, and that it be well 
 spread and intimately mixed with the soil. Before 
 these operations are concluded the lime will be very 
 nearly in the state of combination in which it exist« 
 in spontaneously slaked lime, whatever may have 
 been the state of causticity in which it has been ap- 
 plied. 

You will understand that the above remarks apply 
 only to localities where burned lime is usually or 
 alone used for agricultural purposes. 

Sbould manure be immediately plowed down t 

W. II., of Bedford, Pa., asks, whether it is better 
 to plow down manure immediately after it is taken 
 from the compost heap or barn yard, than to let it 
 be exposed to the influences of the air, wet weather, 
 heat, &c., on small heaps, {as is usually done,) some- 
 time before plowing under. 

Although much has been said and written in favor 
 of surface manuring, we cannot but think the prac- 
 tice a bad one. The virtue of bam yard manure, it 
 is well known, is greatly lessoned by being exposed 
 to the action of the sun and atmosphere, on small 
 heaps as is usually the case. When the manure is 
 spread, and permitted to lie exposed any length of 
 time on the surface, the effects are still worse. The 
 rich juices which constitute the chief value of ma- 
 nures, are exhaled by the sun, or washed away by 
 rains, leaving a residuum, the fertilizing principles 
 of which have been greatly lessened, if not almost 
 wholly destroyed. Slanure should be spread and 
 plowed under as soon as possible after being taken 
 from the barn yard. 

We shall be glad to have this question thoroughly 
 discussed, and therefore hope that some of our cor- 
 respondents will take up the subject. 

Plums and the Curculio. — The editor of this pa- 
 per succeeded last year in having an abundance of 
 plums where they had year after year previously, all 
 dropped off. Vials of sweetened water were hung in 
 the trees, and insects which had stung the fruit were 
 mostly attracted by the sweetened water. The ^als 
 were repeatedly emptied of the water and insects, 
 and re-filled with sweetened water during the time 
 from the flowering of the trees, till the ripening of 
 the fruit. The fruit did not all escape, but the trees 
 were well loaded with sound and well ripened fruit 
 although much dropped off prematurely. These 
 trees stand Ln a dark sandy loam soil, on a S. E. ex- 
 posure, in a peach orchard one hundred and fifty feci 
 above the valley. — Western Agriculturist. 

Some of the articles under the names of chocolate, 
 cocoa flakes, &c., consist of coarse dirty sugar, ground 
 with potato starch, rough bran flour, tallow or grease, 
 and ground musty biscuits, with sometimes an intro- 
 duction of red brick-dust. 

Let it not be forgotten that the best tilled land 
 is always more moitt, and bears drouth better than 
 land of the come qusJity when poorly tilled.
