struggle and obstinate resistance — especially when 
 the adoption of them involved material changes in 
 existing practices and habits. Moreover, the course 
 pursued by tlie advocates of science was not always 
 the most judicious, or the best calculated to make 
 proselytes. It was inconsiderate and rash, for in- 
 stance, on the part of Theory, to sot down her sup- 
 positions and conjectures as undoubted and undenia- 
 ble truths, without having previously subjected them 
 to the test of rigid experiment. It was wrong, in 
 her, to deduce general conclusions from isolated facts; 
 and it was unwise to spurn and contemn the experi- 
 ence of practical farmers, instead of using it, wherever 
 it could be availed of, for the advancement of knowl- 
 edge. Above all it was arrogant for Theory to as- 
 sume a pompous bearing as a science, while yet una- 
 ble to claim a minute acquaintance with existing and 
 prevalent practice — nay, while haughtily and disdain- 
 fully professing the most entire independence there- 
 of and separation therefrom. But, in general, the 
 practical farmer committed a similar unfortunate 
 mistake. Thus, it was presumptuous in him to con- 
 demn without trial, or after a few imperfect trials, 
 the legitimate inferences and conclusions of science. 
 It was unjust in him to require from a science yet in 
 her infancy, the steady and stately stoppings of ma- 
 ture age and experience; and when, instead of prin- 
 ciples, he demanded specific facts and proved pre" 
 soriptions — clear directions and plain precepts, in- 
 stead of hints, suggestions and considerate advice, he 
 asked for what he could not reasonably expect to re- 
 ceive. In short, it was irrational to exact, what it is 
 not the proper province of science to furnish. But 
 here, precisely, obstacles oppose themselves to pro- 
 gross of chemical research, which greatly enhance 
 the difficiilty of ascertaining the true condition of 
 tilings, or of discovering and establishing truth by 
 crucial experiments. The operator is not hero occu- 
 pied with processes purely chemical, but must first 
 ascertain, by close and vigilant attention what varia- 
 tions or deviations are superinduced by the inherent 
 vital forces of plants and animals. He has not here 
 ' to deal exclusively with constant magnitudes and un- 
 changing circumstances; but, whilst seeking to de. 
 monstrate the correctness of his views and conclu- 
 sions, he is just as dependent on varieties of soil, 
 diversities of climate, and vicissitudes of weather, as 
 the practical farmer himself. And, finally, it is not 
 always in his power to institute, as promptly and as 
 frequently as he might desire, those crucial experi- 
 ments which are so satisfactory in their results; but 
 is ofttimos constrained to wait patiently months or 
 years, for opportunities which enable him to arrive 
 at reliable oonclusions. Viewed in this aspect, it is 
 manifestly unfair to judge of chemistry solely from 
 her achievements in the comparatively brief period 
 that has elapsed since she began to turn her attention 
 seriously to the nature of soils and the processes of 
 rural art. It would be more just and equitable to 

defer pronouncing judgment in her case, till it bo 
 seen whether the numerous buds and blossoms, which 
 — especially under the impulse imparted by Liebig 
 and Boussingault — have sprung forth in the last few 
 years, wither and fall, or flourish and mature. — 
 Though many of these may drop abortive, others will 
 doubtless, in due season, produce valuable fruit. 

Chemistry will, however, reach the desired goal 
 the more speedily and the more surely, the more she 
 withdraws from the school and the lecture room, to 
 mingle actively in the practical operations on the 
 farm and in the field. Then also will the working 
 farmer more readily and more cordially extend to 
 her a welcoming hand, and peace and harmony fol- 
 low transient dissension, distrust and estrangement. 
 It is gratifying to perceive that the necessity and ad- 
 vantage of a thorough recouciliatic^n and union arc, 
 of late, felt more and more by both parties ; and that 
 the one-sided position hitherto occupied by many 
 practical men, as well as by theorists, is gradually 
 being abandoned. Even now, chemistry is availed 
 of by many farmers, though they are scarcely aware 
 of the fact, or still reluctant to admit it. When the 
 farmer proposes to lime his land, he takes counsel 
 from chemistry. If he buy gypsum or ashes, analy- 
 sis alone can assure him that the article he obtains 
 is genuine and pure. If he purchase guano, chemis- 
 try must be invoked to determine whether it is free 
 from adulteration and retains the due amount of fer- 
 tilizing elements: and the same is true in scarcely 
 less degree, when bone-dust is procured for the ame- 
 lioration of the soil. If the farmer would manure his 
 land with muck, he cannot tell until the substance 
 has been analysed, whether it do not contain som« 
 deleterious ingredient. If ho would dross a boggy 
 meadow with earth, or mix this with litter for his 
 cattle, chemistry again teaches him to select with 
 certainty that which is best suited to his purpose. — 
 If he design to subsoil his land, he learns from che- 
 mistry whetlier the operation would benefit or injure 
 the particular kind of crop he intends to cultivate. — 
 In short, it is chemistry always, in her proper sphere, 
 which saves or succors the farmer from harm, and 
 comes to his aid with safe and reliable counsels, 
 whenever, in the course of practical culture, he finds 
 himself in a dilemma or encounters a difBculty. 

IIoMEOPATHV. — Old Matthew Maule was executed 
 for the ci-ime of witchcraft. He was one of the mar- 
 tyrs to that terrible delusion which should teach us 
 among its other morals that the influential classes, 
 and those who take upon themselves to be teachers 
 of the people, are fully liable to all the passionate 
 error that ever characterised the maddest mob. — 
 Clergymen, judges, statesmen, the wisest, calmest, 
 holiest persons of their day, stood in this inner circle 
 round about the gallows, loudest to applaud the work 
 of blood, latest to confess themselves miserahhj de- 
 ceived. — Hawihoi-ne.
