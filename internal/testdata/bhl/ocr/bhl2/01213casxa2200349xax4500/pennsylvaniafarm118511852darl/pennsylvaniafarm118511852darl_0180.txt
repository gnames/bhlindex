Animal Heat, &c. 

Mr. Editor: — One of the most interesting develop- 
 ments made through recent scientific investigation is 
 the source of animal heat, hitherto regarded as one of 
 the most inexplicable mysteries of the animal economy. 
 How such a discovery can be brought to bear upon 
 practical husbandry may be difficult to comprehend 
 by some persons, although it can be substantiated by 
 the money test, one which few will be able to reject 
 as insufficient. 

Dr. Piayfair, who has recently examined this sub- 
 ject and thrown much light upon it, observes, that 
 the average temperature of the bodies of our cattle is 
 about 100° of Fahrenheit, which is some two or three 
 degrees above that of our own bodies, a temperature 
 much higher than the mean of our seasons, especially 
 that of winter. But both summer and winter the 
 heat of the bodies of most animals with red blood 
 remains the same. It is evident that more heat must 
 be taken off during the winter than in summer, and 
 hence, as the increased quantity demanded must 
 come from the food, more of this or a change in its 
 ' quality, will be required to meet the exigencies of 
 the season; just as more fuel must bo put into the 
 stove in the coldest weather. It is a well known 
 fact, that the proportion of food consumed is very 
 much greater among the inhabitants of the polar 
 circle than in the tropical region. 

Dr. Piayfair gives an explanation of the phenome- 
 na connected with the origin of animal heat which 
 cannot fail to interest every one who has the least 
 curiosity to look into causes and effects. " The fuel," 
 he says, " consists of those ingredients of food from 
 which nitrogen is aljsent; they all contain carbon 
 and the elements of water. We know that oxygen is 
 continually inhaled in the air we breathe, and that it 
 18 never again expired — as such. Expired air con- 
 sists of carbonic acid, a gas composed of carbon and 
 oxygen. In the body, therefore, the oxygen has uni- 
 ted with carbon; or it has produced the very gas which 
 is obtained hy burniur/ a piece of charcoal in the open 
 air. Now the heat generated by the combination of 
 the carbon in the body must be exactly equivalent to 
 that produced by bul-ning the same amount in the 
 atmosphere." 

Experiments have taught us, that the average 
 quantity of carbon in the food of an adult man 
 amounts to fourteen ounces daily. By the combus- 
 tion of this quantity 197,477 degrees of heat are pro- 
 duced, and this is amply sufficient to account for the 
 heat of the human body. 

The experiments of Boussingault show that a cow 
 breathes out about seventy ounces of carbon daily, 
 and from this we calculate that 987,385 degrees of 
 heat must bo produced in the body of a cow in the 
 space of twenty-four hours. These calculations will 
 at once prove that there is little difficulty in ac- 
 ceuntiug for the heat of the animal body. A benefi- 

cent Providence has arranged the products of differ- 
 ent countries so as to meet the demands of their 
 various climates. The fruits, and vegetable products 
 upon which the inhabitants of warm countries love to 
 feed contain only twelve per cent, of carbon, while 
 the train oil enjoyed by the inhabitants of arctic re- 
 gions contains above seventy per cent, of the same 
 element of animal heat. The animal body is there- 
 fore aptly compared to a furnace which requires to 
 be supplied with more or less fuel according to the 
 temperature of the external air. 

Now if we wish to turn these interesting facts to 
 practical account in the feeding of cattle, the first 
 point to bo accomplished is to place these under 
 circumstances favorable to the healthy play of 
 their vital functions, and during winter this demands 
 that the heat of their bodies should be kept up to a 
 point of comfort. Where the bodies are not sufficient- 
 ly protected from cold more food (fuel) must be fur- 
 nished to the stock. Thus during winter, warmth is 
 an equivalent for food, and, to a certain extent, food 
 an equivalent for shelter. But in hot weather it is, 
 evidently a great object to provide cattle with shade 
 or shelter from the heat of the sun as they will other- 
 wise have so little demand for animal heat as to in- 
 duce them to take very little food and thus the supply 
 of fuel being diminished the elements which contri- 
 bute fat and muscle must both be deficient and the 
 weight fall off. These interesting deductions have 
 been practised upon, with results which appear con- 
 firmatory. The following experiment was tried by 
 the Earl of Ducie at Whitefield farm. 

One hundred sheep were folded by tens in pens, 
 each of which was 22 feet in length by 10 feet in 
 breadth, and possessed a covered shed attached to 
 it of 12 feet in length by 10 in breadth. They were 
 kept in these from the 10th of October to the 10th of 
 March. Each sheep consumed on an average twenty 
 pounds of Sweedish turnips daily. Another hundred 
 were folded in pens of a similar size, but without 
 sheds attached. They were kept during the same 
 time, and their daily consumption of turnips amount- 
 ed to twenty-five pounds each. Here the circum- 
 stances were precisely similar with respect to exer- 
 cise, the only difference being that the first hundred 
 sheep had sheds into which they might retire, and 
 thus be partially protected from the cold. 

This partial protection was therefore equivalent to 
 a certain amount of food, and consequently we find 
 that the sheep enjoying this protection consumed one- 
 fifth less food than those sheep which were left en- 
 tirely exposed to the cold. In the last case the con- 
 sumption of the additional food arose wholly from 
 the necessity of adding more fuel (food) to the fur- 
 nace of the body, in order to keep up its natural de- 
 gree of warmth. This was proved from the circum- 
 stance that those which enjoyed the protection had 
 increased three pounds each, more than those left un-
