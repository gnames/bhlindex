K. E. that the extravagant statement of the Rev. S. 
 A. Bumstcad, .surprised us, as much as it did him, 
 and we gave it a place in the Journal, only because 
 wc could not with proprietj doubt the veracity of the 
 reverend gentleman, particularly when endorsed by 
 another; (the author of the work from which the ex- 
 tract was made.) Wo have written to Mr. Bumstead, 
 and hope to receive a reply which will satisfy our 
 correspondent. — Ed.] 

The Arboretum. 

Mr. Editor: — In looking over the two last num- 
 bers of the Farm Journal, I received much pleasure 
 from reading the appropriate remarks of your lady 
 correspondents, which I hope will bo continued, and 
 induce other ladies to communicate with your valua- 
 able periodical. 

The love of the beautiful is a prominent trait in 
 ■woman's character, and is worthy of the most assidu- 
 ous cultivation, as a means of enjoyment. Aside 
 from moral and patriotic motives, I know nothing 
 more likely to develope tliis trait than flowers and 
 rural scenery. I therefore append a list of hardy 
 flowering shrubs, chiefly exotic, of early culture and 
 adapted to the embellishment of " home, sweet home," 
 hoping to continue it monthly, and occasionally 
 planting a few beautiful trees and vines, among the 
 shrubbery just to fill up the outlines. 

Wicgela Rosea. — This truly beautiful shrub is new 
 to most of your readers. It is of recent introduction 
 into this country, having been sent to Europe from 
 the north of China, by Mr. Fortune, during his re- 
 cent botanical tour through that country. It pro- 
 duces in profusion, clusters of delicate rose-colored 
 flowers, of a tubular form ; it is quite hardy in all 
 the middle States, and is a splendid addition to the 
 shrubbery. 

Spirae prunifolia plena. — This unique shrub was 
 found in the Japanese gardens, and introduced into 
 Europe by that indefatigable collector. Dr. Siebold. 
 It has a most graceful appearance when in flower, 
 and grows to the height of about eight feet. The 
 flowers are pure white, not larger than a dollar gold 
 piece, and perfecibj dotihle. The petals of the flowers 
 are very numerous and beautifully imbricated. The 
 flower resembles in miniature a double ranunculus. 
 It is beyond doubt the handsomest shrub of recent 
 introduction, and as it is perfectly hardy in the most 
 exposed situations, is entitled to a niche in everj- 
 garden. 

AzaUa cakndulacea^— Is a native of the mountains 
 of Georgia and produces in groat profusion corymbs 
 of flowers, varying in color from light yellow to bright 
 flame, presenting a beautiful display during the 
 month of May. It is perfectly hardy and prefers a 
 damp shaded situation. Pursh says, " it is without 
 exception the handsomest shrub in North America." 

Cedrus deodara. — This splendid evergreen tree is 

a native of the Himalayas, and attains a gigantic 
 size; the habit of the tree is pendant and compact, 
 and from the glaucous coloring of the leaves present* 
 a silvery hue, contrasting beautifully with our dark- 
 leaved evergreens. It is quite hardy. We cannot 
 perceive that this tree bears any resemblance to the 
 Cedar of Lebanon, as has been asserted. In conse- 
 quence of its recent introduction into this country all 
 the specimens are small. James D. Fulton.

Mortality among the Poulfrj-. 

Mr. Editor: — For the past few months there has 
 been a very great mortality amongst the poultry in 
 this county ; so great as to destrijy more than two- 
 thirds that have been brought into existence this 
 summer. Failing in my attempts to discover the 
 cause of this vast havoc, I have embraced this mode 
 and opportunity of awaking up some intellio-ent in- 
 formation upon the subject, and if possible arrest the 
 disease that is prevailing amongst them. An intelli- 
 gent and practical farmer within a mile or two of this 
 place has just informed me that out of one hundred 
 young chickens he has lost eighty-five by this prevail, 
 ing though unknown disease. Our poultry when 
 hatched look exceedingly well, until they are about 
 four to six weeks old, when they begin to droop and 
 hang their heads ; refusing all kinds of food and ap- 
 parently die instantaneously. The only perceptible 
 change that can be observed with regard to color, is 
 about the head, which is a very deep purple, and 
 when that change does take place, I find it utterly 
 imjroesible for them to recover. When I first discov- 
 ered that they were dying so rapidly I was compelled 
 to think the difficulty lay in the kind of food I o-ave 
 them, but I changed their food several times, and I 
 find that such is not the case. Can any of vour sub- 
 scribers account for this singular, though destructive 
 disease, and a remedy for the same? 

Very truly yours, Jno. I'. T.vggart.

Bots lu Horses. 

Mr. Editor : — All know, perhaps, that this disease 
 is caused by worms in the stomach. When thi- 
 worms begin to eat the stomach, it causes great dis- 
 tress, and the animal will lie down and roll in agonv, 
 and if relief is not obtained, the worms eat through 
 in a short time, and the horse inevitablv dies. 

A few days since a fine horae was Ivinf in our 
 street, the owner exceedingly frightened not knowing 
 what to do. 

One of our neighbors saw the animal, and his dis- 
 tress, and that of his master, and promptly ordered a 
 pailful of salt and water and a quantity of dry salt. 
 tie poured the salt and water upon the" small of his 
 back, and put the salt in his mouth, and in a few 
 moments the horse was perfectly restored. As soon 
 as he swallowed the salt, the worms ceased eating, 
 and thus the life of a noble animal wa.s saved which 
 but for this simple remedy, must have died.
