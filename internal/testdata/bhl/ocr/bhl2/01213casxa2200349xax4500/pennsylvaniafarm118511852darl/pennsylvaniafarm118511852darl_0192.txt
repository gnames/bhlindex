The stated meeting of this association for the month 
 of August, was held in the Chinese Saloon, on the 
 19th. The President in the Chair. The hall was 
 immensely crowded. The object which brought to- 
 gether so much of the beauty and fashion of the city 
 was the announcement that it was expected a fine 
 specimen of the Victoria rejia might be seen, as a 
 bud which had appeared above the surface of the wa- 
 ter on Monday morning, grew so rapidly and had 
 become so enlarged, that the proprietor (our worthy 
 President) felt confident that it would have been ex- 
 jiauded by the time of the meeting. In this he was 
 disappointed, and therefore the bud remained uncut. 
 The immense leaf, however, was brought in, much to 
 the gratification of the visitors. Its diameter is six 
 feet four inches, or nineteen feet in circumference, 
 peltate and of circular form, emarginate at that por- 
 tion of the leaf which had been the point when it first 
 appeared, and also notched at the opposite margin 
 where the lobes have Ijccorae united by a suture. — 
 The leaf at first is sagittate, and as it grows and ex- 
 pands, the lobed portions of the margin, forming its 
 arrow head shape, unite by tlie suture, and the leaf 
 becomes peltate and circular; and in its prime is sal- 
 ver-formed, the edge being turned up one and a half 
 to two inches. Tlie venation is remarkably promi- 
 nent, and of such symmetry and firmness, that it 
 first conveyed the idea of great strengtli in its con- 
 struction to Mr. Paxton, the architect of the great 
 Crystal Palace, therefore adopted it as a model in the 
 formation of the frame work of the roof of that extra- 
 ■ ordinary structure. The petiole is large, round, and 
 rope-like, and of considerable length. It is, as also 
 the whole of the reticulate veins are, beset with sharp 
 spines. The entire under surface of the leaf is of a 
 beautiful purple tinge. A representation of a llower 
 of the Victoria rcji'a, in wax, obtained by A. Kimber 
 in Europe, was exhibited. This model was taken 
 of a specimen sometime after expansion: The flower 
 is more beautiful when it first opens in its cup-like 
 appearance than as represented by the model shown. 
 As the plant is in a flourishing condition and is show- 
 ing a succession of buds, no doubt flowers will be ex- 
 hibited at the grand autumnal display commencing 
 on the I7th of September. 

In the fruit department there was numerous dishes 
 of the various kinds of the season. On the tables were 
 seen superb bunches of Black Hamburg grapes, from 
 the institution of the Insane, and fine specimens of
