BY MRS. L. C. ABELL. 

If it could bo really arranged as some would have 
 it, that woman should have the right to go to the polls 
 and contend with man in political faction and strife ; 
 could she be privileged to become the skilful operator 
 in surgery, lay bare the lacerated flesh, and see the 
 severed limb, as dismembered from the body; could 
 she attend our civil courts, and meet with the vulgar- 
 ity and roughness, be assailed with the coarse jeer 
 and profane epithets to which man is daily accus- 
 tomed, how long would she be characterised by re- 
 finement and delicacy ? 

Woman is naturally impulsive, tender a.nd yielding. 
 These qualities lovely in her character, and the very 
 soul of domestic comfort might not answer quite so 
 well, in the just and stem decision of a criminal case, 
 where the omnipotence of the law demands the life 
 of the offender ! 

To Young Men who read the Farm Journal. 

I have been looking on, and listening to the voice 
 of the world, and the question is — What are we com- 
 ing to ? what shall we do for young men of worth, 
 of character, of sobriety? 

There is in our land, so much of the spirit of row 
 dyism, intemperance and their accompanying vices 
 that some have taken the alarm, and enquire, " what 
 shall we do ?" Intelligent sons of farmers, and all 
 others who have strength of mind, and principle 
 enough to withstand the tide of temptation, and mo- 
 ral delinquency, your time is coming. Go on in the 
 ways of virtue and intelligence — lay a sound and 
 thorough foundation, and a beautiful temple of re- 
 spectability and character will be reared»thereon ! 

Despair not of ultimate success, even though now 
 unknown. The time is coming as sure as days pass 
 away, when you who pursue the right, will be want- 
 ed ! What a flood tide of the young dissolute ones 
 will in a few years more be swept from the earth, or 
 be mere hangers on to the outskirts of society. Then 
 you will be needed, in the strength and beauty of a 
 pure and upright manhood, with an eye clear with 
 beaming intelligence, and a heart shining out in the 
 beauty of goodness, to give consistency to action and 
 integrity to principle. Yes, you will be needed in our 
 halls of legislation, to be our councillors, our law 
 makers and protectors. 

Spare no labor or expense in education — cultivate 
 all your faculties^be earnest, true and faithful for 
 the time is coming.
