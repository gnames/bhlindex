STewland's Strawberry Humbug. 

The editor of the New England Farmer speaking 
 of Newland's strawberry, which he pronounces a 
 '■ humbug," says: 

We see by a late number of the Pennsylvania Farm 
 ■Tournal, that the editor has received a present of 
 some vines from Newland's agent, and before waiting 
 to give them a trial he is commending them to the 
 public ; thus aiding this imposter in deceiving the 
 farming community. We think notice should be 
 given of the imposition throughout the country in or- 
 der to put a stop to the operations of this impostor. 
 Editors should check, rather than aid him. 

We did speak well of the plants sent us, but cer- 
 tainly not with the intention of aiding Mr. Newland 
 in imposing upon the public. We merely gave Mr. 
 Newland's own statement and referred to the recom- 
 mendations given them by a number of persons. If 
 any persons were induced to purchase them on the 
 strength of what we said, we deeply regret it. We 
 never have. Knowingly, and never will lend our col- 
 umns to the cause of imposition. Our object is the 
 dissemination of valuable truths, and if, as in the 
 case above referred to, we ourselves are sometimes 
 deceived, we hope that it will not be regarded as an 
 evidence of a disposition on our part to deceive oth- 
 ers. 

Correction. — In the third paragraph and fifth line 
 of Mr. P. Morris' article on " Evergreen Trees and 
 Shrubs," in our last number, the word " deodar " 
 should have preceded that of " cedar." The acciden- 
 tal omission of it in the Copy, drew from us a small 
 note which places Mr. M. in the awkward position 
 of calling the common red cedar a tree of "lively tints 
 and graceful habits." We make t'le correction with 
 much pleasure. 

State Agricultural Exhibition. 

We have issued a supplement to the Journal con- 
 taining a " List of Premiums and Rules & Regula- 
 tions for the first Cattle Show and Agricultural and 
 Horticultural Exhibition, to be held by the Pennsyl- 
 vania State Agricultural Society." To this premium 
 list we earnestly invite the attention of every friend 
 of agriculture in our State. The ensuing State Fair 
 will be an event fraught with the highest importance 
 to the prosperity of Pennsylvania. Not only are her 
 farmers deeply interested in rendering it a creditable 
 affair, but the interests of every mechanic and pro- 
 fessional man within her borders will be more or le»s 
 affected by it. Let the Farmer, the Mechanic and the 
 professional man go hand in hand, and shoulder to 
 shoulder help on the good work. From every hill, 
 valley and plain, let the products of honest industry 
 be brought, until the thousands who assemljle at 
 Harrisburg will be taught to know that the full Ex- 
 tent of the resources of the Keystone State have never 
 been thorougly understood. If, as we anticipate, out 
 farmers manifest a proper degree of interest, we pre 
 diet that the display will be one that will cause a 
 thrill of honest pride in every Pennsylvanian's heart, 
 and will lay the foundation for future exhibitions that 
 will be surpassed in excellence by no other in the 
 Union. 

Our exchanges throughout the State will confer a 
 special favor upon the cause of agriculture by pub- 
 lishing the premium list at length and calling atten- 
 tion to it. 

Enamelled Iron Milk Pans. — We are indebted to 
 Messrs. Savery & Co., of Philadelphia, for a nest of 
 iron milk pans, for which they will please accept our 
 thanks. These pans are beautifully enamelled on 
 the inside, and are of a form admirably adapted for 
 cleanliness and prevention of rust. Although more 
 costly than the common earthenware, or tin pane, 
 they are cheaper than the glass and have the advan- 
 tage over the latter of being less liable to be broken 
 by a fall or a blow. Their strength was satisfactori- 
 liy tried in our presence by the manufacturers, who 
 threw them a distance of several feet on a hard floor, 
 without breaking. We have not yet had an opporta- 
 nity of proving their value as milk pans, and can 
 therefore only speak of their form and material, leav- 
 ing it for the dairymen to test their true merits. 

Pennsylvania Tobacco. — In our last, we spoke of 
 the unusual quantity of tobacco growing in our State 
 the present season, and of the unfavorable appearance 
 it at that time presented. Since then, refreshing 
 rains have fallen, and although many fields have not 
 nor are likely to recover fully from the effects of the 
 drouth, the general appearance of the crop has been 
 much improved. Many large growers claim a full 
 crop, and as prices promise to be nearly equal to 
 those of last year, their profits will be large.
