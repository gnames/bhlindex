Peach Culture. 

" Why is not more attention given to the culture 
 ofthe peach in Pennsylvania?" was inquired of us 
 by an ardent friend of fruits, a day or two since. — 
 The query had frequently before presented itself to 
 our mind, as one of great interest and importance. — 
 That the soil in very many sections of our State is 
 peculiarly adapted to the cultivation of nearly all 
 the stone fruits, is unquestionable. The gratifying 
 success which has attended every well directed effort 
 should satisfy the most skeptical, that Pennsylvania 
 is a region especially favored in this particular. Our 
 climate, too, is all the peach grower could desire, so 
 that tlie almost total indifference on the part of her 
 people alone, prevents our State from becoming as 
 famous for choice peaches, as she has long been for 
 fine grain. It makes a New Jersey man's heart ache 
 to look upon our noble peach trees, from one limh of 
 which, at least three fuUy matured Jersey trees could 
 be made. And then the difference in duration. A 
 Jersey fruit tree generally comes to full maturity in 
 three years. Four years at farthest is sufficient to 
 complete its growth and then having thoroughly im- 
 poverished the soil, it literally dies of starvation. A 
 Pennsylvania peach tree, on the other hand, bears 
 equally as much and decidedly richer flavored fruit 
 at three years, and then continues increasing in size 
 vigor, producing with each successive year larger and 
 better crops for fifteen or twenty years successively 
 Wherever properly attended to, it thrives and bears 
 •well for at least fifteen years, and without any culti- 
 Tation at all, the bearing life of our peach trees on 
 oar mellow loam soils will average ten years. 

In the face of all these facts, New Jersey for many 
 years held the immense profits of the peach crop, sup- 
 plied to the Philadelphia and New York markets, 
 almost entirely in her own hands. Recently, little 
 Delaware has put in a claim for the spoils, and the su- 
 periority of her peaches has nearly driven our Jersey 
 friends from the Philadelphia market. Hundreds of 
 thousands of dollars have thus, for a long period, 
 been annually paid for fruits which.with comparative- 
 ly trifling cost and labor, our citizens might have 
 grown themselves, and that too of a size and flavor 
 infinitely superior to those brought from New Jersey 
 and Delaware, and for which they pay most exorbi- 
 tant prices. 

Very few persons are aware of the difference be- 
 tween the flavor of peaches grown upon our stronger, 
 heavier soils, and those cultivated in the light sands 
 of Jersey. This is attributable not to a want of 
 taste on their part, but to the fact of their rarely 
 having an opportunity of comparing the merits re- 
 spectively of the two kinds. While the former is 
 richly flavored and possessed in perfection of all the 
 qualities which gives the peach its pre-eminence as a 
 fruit, the other is generally watery and insipid, or 

impregnated with acidity to such a degree as to ren- 
 der it almost unfit for eating. 

We venture the assertion, bold as it may appear, 
 that in Lancaster county may now be found a larger 
 variety of superior peaches — superior in size, and 
 richness of flavor — than can be produced in any three 
 counties in New Jersey, and that there are now grow- 
 ing in her soil, trees in full, luxuriant vigor, which 
 have borne heavy crops of delicious peaches for twelve 
 successive years, and one of which will produce more 
 fruit in a single season than two average sized Jer- 
 sey trees wiU produce during their whole life time. 
 The same may doubtless be said of peach trees in the 
 counties of Chester, Montgomery, Bucks, Delaware, 
 Philadelphia, or in fact any of the old counties of the 
 State. 

Looking at the subject, then, in a money point of 
 view alone, does it not assume an important aspect? 
 Should not our own people give their attention to the 
 culture of a fruit than which is none more delicious 
 or profitable. If a correct estimate could be made 
 of the amount paid by Pennsylvanians for New Jer- 
 sey and Delaware peaches, it would doubtless awaken 
 a deeper feeling of interest. 

Protect Yourselves and Y'our Propertt. — The 
 past season has been full of warning to our farmers. 
 Never within our recollection has there been in any 
 one summer so many accidents from lightning. Al- 
 most every day, accounts of the awful destruction of 
 lives and property have reached us, and in every in- 
 stance where these accidents have happened to dwell- 
 ings or barns, the usual protection of lightning rods 
 was wanting. Now, when it is remembered that 
 every farmer lias it in his power fully to guard against 
 these accidents, does not his neglect to do so render 
 him highly culpable. We think so. A comparative- 
 ly small amount expended for lightning rods ensures 
 the safety of the family and property, and during the 
 prevalence of storms, relieves the mind from the dread 
 and anxiety usually felt by those who are without 
 these important appendages to their buildings. AVe 
 therefore say to every farmer, put up lightning rods 
 at once, and while you are about it, put up those of 
 the most approved kinds. The magnetic lightning 
 rod, patented and manufactured by Thomas Armi- 
 tage. Vine street, Philadelphia, is pronounced by 
 scientific men the best in use, and we commend it to 
 the attention of our readers. 

TuE Corn Crop. — The refreshing rains which 
 fell in our vicinity during the middle and latter part 
 of August, in a measure revived the drooping corn, 
 and assisted materially in filling the ears. It now 
 looks vigorous and healthy, and a tolerable fair crop 
 may be anticipated, though not so large as it promis- 
 ed to be, earlier in the season. We are pleased to 
 learn that nearly every section of the State enjoyed 
 the blessings of fine showers about the time we re- 
 ceived them.
