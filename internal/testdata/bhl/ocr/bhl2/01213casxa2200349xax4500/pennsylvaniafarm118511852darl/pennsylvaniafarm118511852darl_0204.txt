IMPORTANT TO FARMERS 
 And Threshing >lachine Makers. 

THE subscriber respectfully begs leave to inform the public 
 that he haslately perfecteda new Threshing Machine ond Horse 
 Power, which in point of strength, durability, lightne.^s of draught 
 and convenience in moving is not surpassed or equalled by any 
 Machine in the United States; he also confidently affirms that no 
 Machine of its strength and durability can be afforded as low. — 
 The invention of this Machine has been the result of several 
 years experience and hard study. We do not claim to have dis- 
 covered any new principle in philosophy — but we do claim to have 
 discovered a plan by which old philosophical principles are more 
 correctly and ndvautageously applied than on any other iMachine 
 This invention is secured by a caveat. 

These Machines can be had at Israel W. GrofTs Machine Shop 
 and , at Prime &. Colestock's Sash Factory in North Duke street. 
 Lancaster city, at retail or by wholesale on, the most reuaonable 
 terms. 

The Power weighs GOO pound.5. It is made entirely of Iron with 
 SteelJournals, and is warranted to hold 8 Horses should it any 
 time be necessary to use so many. From 2 to 4 Hnr^-es are a suffic- 
 ient number for common threshing. We are about getting up 
 one much lighter for Shop purposes that will bo the cheapest and 
 must convenient thing in use; it might also be used with 2 or 3 
 Horses fur threshing; the Powers and Cylinders and Concave can 
 be had by the Machine makers throughout the country on the 
 most reasonable terms. 

ttB^ All orders directed to the subscriber at Lancaster city will 
 be thankfully received and promptly attended to,

HAVE been distributed throughout the Union. The concern 
 has been in successful operation for upwards of Sixty Years^ 
 anil may be said to have grown up with the City of Philadelphia, 
 where it was at first located. It has been gradually enbtrged to 
 meet the growing wants of the public, and is now, as it ever has 
 been, the most extensive of its kind in this country. The grounds 
 in cultivation being ten-fold greater than those ot any similar 
 concern in the United States. 

As the Seeds Sold by the proprietor are (with slight exception) 
 of his own raising, he is. consequently, enabled to IL/' Warrant 
 them, a matter of importance to the purchaser of au article, the 
 quality of which cannot be determined by the eye. Descriptive

 which for durability and easy of draft is yet unequalled. 

The great advantages these Plows possess over all others, are
