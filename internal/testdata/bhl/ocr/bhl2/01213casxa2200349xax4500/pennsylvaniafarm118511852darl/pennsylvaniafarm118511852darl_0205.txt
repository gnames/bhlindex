 AVm. Hartley, Bedford. The specimens sent by 
 mail include three distinct species. The larva is the 
 meal-worm which produces an insect named Teyiehrio 
 ■ntolilor, which is often found in mills, and is one of 
 the species destructive to flour. The smallest brown 
 specimen among the wevils, about an eighth of an 
 inch long, is not a wevil, but the Silvanus surinamen- 
 813, which attacks grain. It is readily distinguished 
 by a row of six spines on each side of the thorax, as 
 represented the agricultural part of the Patent office 
 Report for 1849, pi. 2, fig. 24. 

The remaining specimens are true wevils, and 
 seem to be Sitophihis granarius, which is widely 
 spread in Europe, and occurs also in Java. It is fig- 
 ured in the before mentioned volume, pi. 2, fig. 21, 
 and described in nearly a hundred different works. — 
 Schoenherr's description is but four lines long, and 
 not sufficient for the identification of the species, and 
 we have not time to make further comparisons the 
 present month. In the mean time we enumerate 
 some of the modes of counteracting its ravages. 

Kiln drying the wheat' destroys the insect, larvae 
 and eggs. Mr. Wilkinson had a large chamber capa- 
 ble of holding eight hundred bags of wheat at a time, 
 which was heated by means of hot water pipes to 135 
 degrees Fahrenheit, a heat sufficient to kill the in- 
 sect, without preventing the grain from germinating. 
 Wevils do not like to be disturbed, and may there- 
 fore be driven from heaps of wheat by frequent shov- 
 eling, or passing it through a fan or smut machine. 
 If at the same time small heaps of wheat are left un- 
 disturbed for some time, many will be attracted by 
 them, and destroyed by scalding or other application 
 of heat. 

As the grain is generally attacked a few inches 
 below the surface of the heap, sprinklings of turpen- 
 tine, or bottles of it, (uncorked, but covered with

gauze,) if sunk in the heaps, might cause them to 
 leave, as this substance is obnoxious to most insects. 
 The French recommend unscoured wool to be laid 
 upon infected wheat, as they are said to enter it and 
 die there. 

A. L. II. The insect which destroys the stalk of 
 the Antwerp raspberry is the Ayrilus rxiJicolUs, of 
 which we gave an account (accompanied by a figure) 
 in the Quarterly Journal of Science and Agriculture 
 in 1846. 

The Agricultural Fair. 

Extensive preparations are making to render this 
 an exhibition of much interest, and we learn that 
 various matters are in preparation of an instructive 
 and pleasing nature which will well repay a visit, 
 even from the adjoining States. The New York ex- 
 hibitions have become so popular that tliey attract a 
 crowd of 100,000 persons, and there is no reason whv 
 our own should not be of equal Interest. 

We hope that the suggestion of the Hon. A. 0. 
 Iliester, (see page 107) will be acted upon, and a 
 strong petition be sent in to the next Legislature in 
 favor of one or more agricultural colleges, which we 
 regard as the chief means not only of advancing agri- 
 culture, but of elevating the general standard of aca- 
 demical and collegiate education amongst us. Our 
 own views may be learned to some extent from our 
 notice of Mr. Russell's plan on page 59, and if we 
 have admitted articles containing different ideas, it 
 was that both sides might be heard. We expect to 
 return to this subject in a future number. 

The Potato Blight.— The potato crop in New 
 York State is suffering from the blight. Accounts of 
 disease have already been received from nine coun- 
 ties, viz: Madison, Ontario, Erie, Livingston, Gene- 
 see, Wyoming, Onondago, Oswego and Courtland. — 
 In the three latter, the Syracuse Journal says, the 
 rot is extensive, and the farmers are generally digging 
 and sending to market.
