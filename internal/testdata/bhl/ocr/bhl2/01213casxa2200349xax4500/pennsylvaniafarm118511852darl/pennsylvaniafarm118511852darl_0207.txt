 Having thus slio^vn the importance and direct in- 
 fluence of chemistry in agriculture, we sliall proceed 
 to present a concise view of agricultural chemistry 
 itself. 

Vegetable bodies in general consist of two classes 
 of substances, of which the one is termed the organic 
 or combustible, and the other the inorganic or incom- 
 bustible elements of plants. Of these constituent 
 parts, the organic are in all vegetables the more 
 abundant in quantity — composing fiom 90 to 99 per 
 cent, of their entire weight. The organic portion, 
 again, comprises yarious elements. By the term 
 dements, or fundamental substances (sometimes also 
 called original or simple substances,) wo understand 
 those bodies which are regarded as simple, because 
 liitherto, science has not succeeded in decompounding 
 them — though it seems probable that the decomposi- 
 tion of many of the substances now called simple, 
 wiU yet be effected. The present number of such 
 elements, or simple substances, is fifty-eight. Of 
 these four are ceriform or gaseous, two are semi-liquid, 
 fifty-one are solid, and one has not yet been reduced 
 to its true form. The organic portion of vegetables 
 consists of the four following elements — oxygen, ni- 
 trogen, hydrogen and carbon; though all of these are 
 not present in all plants. 

The most important of these elementary substances 
 is oxygen — sometimes called vital air. This is a pe- 
 culiar kind of gas, contained in the atmosphere and 
 in water, and having a tendency .to unite and com- 
 bine with almost every other substance, whether so- 
 lid or fluid, and thus assuming a variety of forms. — 
 From this disposition to combine with other sul> 
 stances, results its property of conditioning and sup- 
 porting combustion; because during the process of 
 combustion, it unites with the component elements 
 of the burning substance. Oxygen also is that pecu- 
 liar kind of air, or portion of the atmosphere, which 
 is taken up by the bodies of animated creatures in 
 the act of breathing. Oxygen unites with all the 
 metals, forming various grades of combination, which 
 are termed osids, protoxids, peroxids, ifco. Oxygen 
 performs a highly important part in vegetable eco- 
 nomy, being absorbed by the plants and converted 
 into food or pabulum. Oxygen constitutes nine parts 
 in ten of common water; one in five of the atmos- 
 phere; and about one-third of the crust of the earth. 
 For the production of oxygen, chlorate of potash 
 is most usually employed. One-tenth part of pure 
 oxid of manganese is mixed with a convenient portion 
 of chlorate of potash, in a small glass flask or tube- 
 less retort, to which a bent glass tube is fitt«d by a 
 cork. The tube serves to conduct the gas beneath 

tHe water in the pmjumatie trough {fig. 1.) into the 

Fig. 1. 
 invei-ted receiver, which is filled with water. The 
 flask or retort is then cautiously heated by means of 
 a spirit lamp [fig. 2.). When the heat has expelled 

Fig. 2. 
 the atmospheric air from the retort, and the oxygen 
 begins to be developed as the salt becomes decomposed, 
 the pure gas is freely given off, passes through the bent 
 tube, and displaces the water in the receiver in which 
 it is collected for preservation. For the production of 
 very pure oxygen, oxid of mercury may be employed. 
 The arrangement of the apparatus, for this purpose, 
 is shown \)yfig. 3. The oxid of mercury is placed 

Fig. 3. 

in a small glass retort or flask, which is connected by 
 a glass tube with a reservoir having two openings, 
 from which another glass tube conducts the gas to 
 the inverted receiver in the pneumatic trough. At a 
 dull red heat the oxid of mercury becomes decompos- 
 ed into its elements, mercury and oxygen, both of 
 which pass ofi' in a gaseous state. The mercury con- 
 denses in the interposed reservoir, while the oxygen 
 passes on and is received in the air-jar. 

Niirogw is a gas difiering very essentially from 
 oxygen. In pure nitrogen, animal life is iBStan'a-
