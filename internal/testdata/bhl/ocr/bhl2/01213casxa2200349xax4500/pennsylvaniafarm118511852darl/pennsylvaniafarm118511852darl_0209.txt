■rrcat importance in the vegetable economy. In all 
 I "^s of combustion, or the putrefactive decomposition 
 of . .als or plants, and in every act of respiration 
 by li' .ng creatures, carbon and oxygen comliino and 
 i':JOape into the atmosphere in a gaseous form, as car- 
 bonic acid. Not the smallest plant can grow and 
 thrive, unless it imbibe and appropriate a portion of 
 this acid, decomposing it into carbon and oxj'gen 
 and using the carbon as its chief clement. 

Other elementary substancas likewise are contained 
 by various plants, and are of essential importance. — 
 S;ieh are : — 

1 ) Chlorine. As a simple substance this is pro- 
 curable only in the form of gas. For tliis purpose 
 six parts of muriatic acid are poured on one part of 
 pulverized peroxid of manganese, in a flask, vidiich i; 
 to be then heated in a small Ijath. The chlorine gas 
 ileveloped is ■washed by passing it through a second 
 jar called tln^ "wash-bottle," C./7,'/. S.) containing vva-

 tor, and is then collected in vessels containing Itril. 
 v,-atcr. As chlorine is much heavier than atmosphe- 
 ric air, it maj' be collected by passing the conducting 
 tube down nearly to the bottom of the receiving jar 
 (fij. 9.). Willie the chlorine gas enters liclow, the 

;itmospheric air is discharged above. When the jar 
 !ir buttle is full, which may be known from the green- 
 ish color of the gas, it should be closed tightly with 
 a greased stopper. Chlorine is one of the heaviest 
 of the gases, 100 cubic inches weighing 7Ci grains. 
 Hydrochloric acid is produced by means of " Woulfe's 
 apparatus," (Ji;j. 10.). Chlorine never occurs pure 
 in plants, but always in coniljination with other sub- 
 st.ances. It readily combines with other bodies, and 

supports the combustion of many. It is a constituent 
 of a large number of plants, and is indispensable to the 
 "rowth of those in which it is found. It is the most

efficient agent for disinfecting apartments or places 
 containing offensive odors and miasms, and is much 
 used during the prevalence of contagious or infectious 
 diseases. From its property of destroying vegetable 
 colors, it is also very valuable and much used for 
 bleaching linen and cotton cloth. Seeds which have 
 lost their vegetating power, regain it if immersed in 
 water containing a small portion of chlorine, on being 
 exposed to the rays of the sun — which seems to indi- 
 cate that the oxygen of the decomposed water is the 
 active cause. Many marine plants exhale chlorine, 
 and tliis is probably the reason why the atmosphere 
 in the vicinity of the sea frequently contains so great 
 a proportion of hydrochloric acid as to corrode the 
 leads of houses — the exhaled chlorine uniting with 
 the aqueous vapors of the .air. 

2) Svlplmr. This substance is found in many 
 plants and in various forms, but always in a state of 
 minute subdivision, and is essential to their thrifty 
 growth. • Sulphur combines readily with oxygen, 
 forming sulphuric acid, wliich acts an important part 
 in agriculture. Sulphur, as a simple substance, is 
 never found in soils; though it is met with abundant- 
 ly in cliemical union with other substances, and will 
 unite with all the simple bodies, except nitrogen. — 
 Pulverized sulphurhas been employed as afertilizer or 
 stimulant in the cultivation of clover, and produced 
 nearly the same effects as gypsum. Tlie efficacy of 
 this substance being thus ascertained, it follows that 
 it would be injudicious to calcine gypsum by fire 
 previous to its application to the crops or soil, be- 
 cause the sulphur it contains would tliereliy be vo- 
 latilized and dissipated in the air. The application 
 of dilute sulphuric acid to growing crops has never 
 been found beneficial, but when applied directly to 
 soils containing much carbonate of lime (common 
 limestone) its action is favorable, resulting in the 
 production of gypsum, which can be slowly taken up 
 by the succeeding crops. 

3) rhosphonis. This substance is somewhat simi- 
 lar to sulphur, but much more inflammable, having a 
 strong affinity for oxygen — which it is constantly
