of what I shixU term common yields, and shall do it 
 with the hope of drawing into this broad field of la- 
 bor a greater number of farmers similar in character 
 to myself. This will open an acquaintance with 
 practical formers in every portion of our State, so that 
 when we meet each other at our State Fairs, we shall 
 feel that though strangers in fact, we know each oth- 
 er as comrades in the columns of the Farm Jonrnal.

[We like the suggestions of our correspondent, and 
 will endeavor to improve upon them. At the same 
 time we commend his plain, common sense way of 
 speaking to every reader of the Journal. From the 
 start we have striven to enlist the interest of the mass 
 of farmers and thus far have succeeded, we think, in 
 presenting a rich and varied store of practical agri- 
 cultural information. Our purpose has ever been to 
 give the Journal such a character as will commend 
 it to every friend of agriculture. We have combined 
 the practical with the theoretical and scientific, and 
 with the aid of such good men as our correspondent 
 above, hope to render it still more valuable and in- 
 teresting. — Ed.I 

Deterioration of Pennsylvania soUs and Agricultu- 
 ral Education. 

Mr. Editor: — So much has the subject of agricul- 
 tural education been harped upon by the agricultu- 
 ral press, that farmers generally might be supposed 
 to be fully awake to the importance of the subject. 
 That a deeper interest than has ever before mani" 
 fested itself in regard to this important point, is felt 
 through the agricultural community generally, is very 
 apparent : but it is equally apparent that, unless this 
 interest becomes more deeply seated, but little good 
 will ever result from it. Unless the fathers of the 
 rising generation take the matter in hand, and ener- 
 getically and perseverlngly press it onward, but little 
 hope exists, that Pennsylvania agriculture, as well 
 aj5 the agriculture of the United States generally, 
 will for a century at least be emancipated from 
 the thraldom that now enslaves it. My honest con- 
 victions are, that Pennsylvania is the best farmed 
 State in the Union, but it is an undeniable fact, that 
 with each successive year the fertility, and conse- 
 quently, the value of her lands is lessened. The 
 same " skinning" system pursued so largely in Vir- 
 ginia, Maryland, New York and elsewhere, is in. 
 dulged to a hurtful extent here, and unless super- 
 seded by a better one, we shall find that our soil, like 
 that of Virginia, will be thorougly impoverished and 
 our farmers be compelled to seek new homesteads.— 
 This is truly a startling assertion and one that will 
 perhaps meet with but few believers ; but it is an 
 assertion that is sustained by stubborn facts, and a 
 truth which sooner or later the formers of this com- 
 monwealth will be called to realize. 

What else is to be expected where lands are crop- 
 ped from year to year, with scarcely an interval of 
 rest, and what is more, with not enough manure to 
 restore to them a tithe scarcely of the fei-tilizing con- 
 stituents which these successive crops take from it. — 
 Is it a matter of surprise that under such a system 
 of tillage 'our lands should deteriorate in quality — 
 that lands which forty years ago yielded thirty bush- 
 els of wheat to the acre now yield scarcely the half 
 of it ? Not at all. It is a legitimate consequence 
 flowing from a system of farming which may answer 
 very well for a few years on new land, but which will 
 as certainly exhaust them eventually, as that the sun 
 shines in the heavens. Take up the census report 
 of 1850, and select for the experiment the oldest and 
 best farmed counties in the State — say Lancaster, 
 Montgomery and Chester— and " figures that will not 
 lie" will satisfy you that a comparison of the yields 
 of the same number of acres now, with the number 
 cultivated forty years ago, will show a diminution in 
 quantity of nearly one-half. If the evil were arrested 
 here and an effort made to retrieve the position we 
 have lost, there would remain a bright hope; but un- 
 fortunately it is still progressing. And now the 
 question comes up, shall we, as farmers, continue 
 this ruinous course, until, through absolute necessity 
 we shall be compelled to abandon our lands and seek 
 homes elsewhere. Every thinking farmer will at once 
 reply, not so long as there exists a remedy. But 
 where is the remedy and how shall we apply it ? 

I answer, the aid of agricultural science must be 
 invoked. We must comljine more science with our 
 farming. We must prepare ourselves to analyse our 
 soils in order that wo may know precisely what ele- 
 ments of fertility they have lost, and the most effec- 
 tual and cheapest mode of restoring them. The sci- 
 ence of economical manuring must be more thorough- 
 ly understood and practised. Valuable manures 
 which are now wasted in reckless profusion by the 
 generality of farmers must be husbanded with that 
 jealous care which characterises the farming opera- 
 tions of Europe. 

But many of our older farmers will say, we have 
 no time for such studies — our lands will last anothor 
 generation, and let those who come after, adopt the 
 plans recommended. It is not expected that the old 
 farmers will take hold of scientific studies ; but this 
 does not prove that they are not deeply interested in 
 the advancement of agricultural science. It is thj 
 duty of every farmer who has a son, to give him such 
 an education, as will enable him to repair the evils 
 which have resulted from the want of it in his parent. 
 Every young man destined for agricultural pursuits, 
 should have such educational facilities as will fit him 
 to become not only a practical, but a scientific far- 
 mer. 

Do not, brother farmers, let the word scientific 
 alarm you. There is nothing in it to terrify. Agri-
