cultural science is only a familiar acquaintance vrith \ sooner the better. If old formers will not devote at- 
 the constituents of the soil you cultiyate, its wants j tention to scientific pursuits, the young ones must ; 
 and adaptation to the growth of particular crops. It and if the parents will not educate their sons proper- 
 is, in fact, uothino- more than a friendly acquaintance I ly, the sons must take hold of the matter themselves, 
 with nature's operations — a study of the manner in j Excellent books in almost every department of agri- 
 which she replenishes the earth so as to perpetuate ! culture may now be had for small sums. Ten years 

itfi fertility — a practice of the economy she adopts. 

Here again, however, another important query is 
 suggested. How shall our sons be taught without a 
 teacher? Teachers they must have, and in order to 
 procure them, it is only necessary for the farmers of 
 this great commonwealth to knock at the doors of our 
 legislative halls and demand them. Denial need not 
 -be feared, for so little has been asked by and granted 
 to the farmers, that with the consciousness of de- 
 manding only their rights, they may insist upon the 
 establishment of agricultural schools and colleges. — 
 Here, then, is a remedy — will the former apply it ? 
 Will he put forth an effort to restore to the soil of 
 Pennsylvania its original fertility, er will he permit 
 the present ruinous system still to be continued, un- 
 til that which would now prove an effectual remedy 
 will fail to be efficacious. Let them take warning by 
 the examples around them before it is too late.

 West Chester, September 10, 1851. 

[There are many important truths contained in E. 
 P.'s communication, although we are not prepared to 
 endorse all he says. His view of the " skinning" pro- 
 cess now so much in vogue is undoubtedly correct, 
 and the deplorable results he anticipates, will certain- 
 ly follow if it is persisted in ; but we do not believe that 
 Pennsylvania lands have deteriorated to such an ex- 
 tent as he represents. The census report may show 
 a falling off in the yield, but E. P. must remember 
 that within a few years past many of the poor lands 
 of our State, which for a long period wore considered 
 unfit for cultivation, have been taken up by enter- 
 prising farmers, and are fast being brought into fine 
 condition. Lancaster county furnishes clear proof 
 of this. (See article in the June No. of the Journal, 
 page XII. entitled "Progress in Farming.") The 
 yield of these!lands, although double that of five years 
 since, is still unequal to that of the better lands. A 
 few years more will tell a different tale, and then 
 only can a correct estimate be made. 

"We also agree with our correspondent that Penn- 
 sylvania is the best farmed State in the Union. This 
 has always been our impression. The editor of the 
 Horticulturist, (pretty good authority, by tlie way,) 
 in speaking of the greater increase of the rural po- 
 pulation in Pennsylvania than in New York, attri- 
 butes it to the fact that the former State is better 
 farmed tlian the latter. 

And finally, we agree with our correspondent that 
 it has become the imperative duty of every farmer to 
 give his sons a good education. A scientific system 
 of agriculture must sooner or later be adopted ; the 

ago, such was not the case. The young farmer, there- 
 fore, is also without an excuse, if he does not unite 
 the scientific with the practical. And so far as agri- 
 cultural schools and colleges are concerned, let that 
 subject be agitated until the desired object is secured. 
 It only wants a vigorous, combined effort. Right is 
 on the side of the farmers, so that they may with a 
 clean conscience ask for their establishment. — Ed.] 

Wayne County. 

A correspondent from Wayne county, writes us as 
 follows : It is gratifying to me to inform you that 
 away up here in little Wayne, with our high hills 
 and stony valleys, we have an agricultural society 
 that has been existence four years and is now in a 
 flourishing condition. Our farmers are not as far be- 
 hind those of the more southern counties as our lo- 
 c ition would indicate. We have a good portion of 
 reading farmers; but many of them prefer the news 
 of the day to valuable agricultural information. They 
 are unwilling to spend a dollar to make themselves 
 familiar with the experience and experiments of oth- 
 ers. But a better day is coming and with the aid of 
 the Farm Journal, I hope soon to see better things. 
 If our farmers, however, are backward in subscribing 
 for agricultural papers, it is because Pennsylvania 
 has, until you started the Farm Journal, had no pa- 
 per of her own. Now that you have made so good a 
 start and are furnishing us monthly with so much 
 valuable and interesting matter, nothing but total in- 
 difference on your part can prevent it from having a 
 tremendous circulation. What I can do in our noble 
 little county shall be done in its behalf, and I hope 
 to send you a large list of subscribers soon.

CoKKECTiox. — Mr. Spangler : — Several errors crept 
 into my communication on Guano, which was pub- 
 lished in the September No. of the Journal. In the 
 third paragraph, the word andhetove the words "when 
 the corn was up" should have been omitted. I meant 
 to say, "put on when the corn icas tip." The other is 
 near the end of the last paragraph. After the word 
 " condition" should have been inserted, " the differ- 
 ence in" meaning that the difference in yield was not 
 so great as the difference in the appearance of the 
 corn during its growth. Jno. Miller.

Seed. — Where seed is wished to be saved, the sorts 
 must be grown apart, as far as practicable, for they 
 are very susceptible of mixture, if even within fifty 
 vards of each other.
