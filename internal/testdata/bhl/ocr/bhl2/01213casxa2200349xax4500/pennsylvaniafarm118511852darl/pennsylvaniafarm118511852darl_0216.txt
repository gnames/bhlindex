A word on JVIaii\iriiig. 

Mr. Editor : — An inquiry is made by W. 11., of 
 Bedford, wliethcr it is bettor to plow down manure 
 immediately after it is taken frum tlie yard, than to 
 let it be exposed to the influences of the sun some 
 time before plowing under. 

My little e.xperienoe may not be considered as alj- 
 solutely worthless amidst the boundless stock of 
 knowledge on the subject. 

The great aim of the farmer should bo to make his 
 supply of manure sufficiently enrich as many acres 
 as possible : in order to do this, a pound should not 
 be needlessly wasted. In the saving of these com- 
 posts, after liaving been completely manufactured, I 
 consider lies the great economy in manuring. In the 
 outset, the yard should be so lormed that none of the 
 juices can escape into the neighboring fields, but be 
 retained in the straw, woods, loaves, &e. By top 
 dressing, or surface manuring, I am led to believe 
 that only in a few instances are we able to retain 
 more than a small proportion of the fertilizing quali- 
 ties of the manure in the soil, and those few instances 
 are, when it is put upon light sandy, or loose gravel 
 land, just before a long wet period of time — light 
 showers and hot sun, being as destructive to it as to 
 well seasoned hay. 

The system of manuring which I follow is better 
 ;idapted to my circumstances, than any which I liavc 
 yet been able to settle upon. 

Taking into consideration that it is a leisure season 
 for the teams on the farm, and the stage of the de- 
 composition of the straw manure, the month of No- 
 vember is the time for drawing. If the ground is to 
 be plowed in the fall, one team is phiwing, while two 
 t^jams are drawing from the yard at the rate of about 
 thirty-five loads per day ; and if the land requires it 
 a day's work covers one aero, evenly spread and turn- 
 ed under as soon as possible after the arrival at the 
 field. If the land is not to bo plowed until spring, I 
 station a man in the field whose special duty it is to 
 level off the place where each heap is to lie, assist in 
 unloading, and cover each pile- — which consists of 
 half the load — with a layer of earth about six inches 
 in thickness ; which when finished resembiles a small 
 potato heap covered for the winter. This coating of 
 earth not only retains all the aciils which are so es- 
 sentially valuable, but protects it from the rains and 
 snows of winter, which, if the manure is left exposed, 
 carries a great portion of the juices into the earth 
 immediately under it, enriching the spot to a much 
 higher degree than is desired. Those rains at the 
 same time taking possession of the compost, render- 
 ingHit as much the Ic-s valuable as the quantity of 
 water is increased. These heaps are put in straight 
 rows across the field, that the plow may follow as 
 closely after the spreading as possible. Some may 
 question the economy of incurring this extra labor, 
 but if they will consider the value of a load of ma- 

nure prepared for use in the field, and then feel that 
 during a few weeks the sun and wind are stealing 
 away nearly half its virtue, there will be but little 
 hesitation in protecting it, in part, from the reach of 
 tliose " thievish elements." 

If any of your correspondents have a. more econo- 
 mical mode in the manp.gemcnt of yard manures, in- 
 formation concerning it, would be received with gra- 
 titude no doubt by many, as it is a very important 
 portion of the work of a farm. W.

Fruit Stealing, «&c. 
 Mr. Editor or Farm Journal: — In the last No. 
 of the Journal, you request " some of your readers 
 versed in the philosophy of morals, to define the dif- 
 ference in criminality between robbing a man's orch- 
 chard and robljing his house." You say, " v'ou are 
 aware the law makes a broad distinction between the 
 two," but contend that "this is a distinction without 
 a difference." Verily, if there is any difference the 
 heinousness of robljing a man of his fiuit, in my es- 
 timation at least, is far greater than roljbing his hen- 
 roost, his smoke house, or even his pockets. The lat- 
 ter crimes are mere matters of dollars and cents, and 
 which a little economy will repair — ^Ijut the rolibing of 
 choice fruit and mutilation of trees, money alone will 
 not replace, it r. quires time: years of labor and toil. 
 As I do not at this time intend to inflict on you 
 and your readers a thesis on moral philosophy defin- 
 ing this position, I will merely state a fact bearing 
 on the question, and which will show the enoi-mity 
 of the crime, (I can give it no other name) that c/en- 
 ilcrnai sometimes thjughtlessly commit. 

It is vrell known to all readers of agricultural pub- 
 lications, that the late Judge Buel, of Albany, N. Y., 
 devoted much of his time and eminent talents to the 
 improvement and elevation of agriculture and horti- 
 culture. Among other of his pursuits ho euiplo3-od 
 many of his leisure hours in improving our fruits — 
 following the theory first promulgated (if I mistake 
 not) by the late Andros Knight, president of the Lon- 
 don Horticultural Society — by impregnating the stig- 
 ma of one flower with the farina from another of a 
 dllferent variety. This course Mr. Buel pursued with 
 the hope of originating something superior — by im- 
 pregnating the stigma or pistil of a ciioico variety of 
 cherry with the pollen of anotlier fine variety, and 
 carefully protecting the flower operated upon with 
 gauze, to prevent the adventitious intermixture of 
 pollen from another variety, by bees, -(Wnd, &o. — 
 When the impregnated fruit became ri|ie, the stone, 
 or pit, was carefully planted — a young tree raised — 
 and from one year to another carefully nurtured and 
 watched, and after ten years of ceaseless care the 
 Judge's long anticipated hopes were aliout to be real- 
 ized by the tree showing flowers, and a single cherry, 
 the first fruit of the experiment, was swelling towards
