maturity. You may well suppose this cherry was 
 watched ami guarded with extra care, and visited 
 daily, day hourly, by the Judge, as it was about ri- 
 pening. 

One morning while the Judge was engaged in his 
 libr.ij'y, two gentlemen, intimate friends of his, called 
 upon him, and as he could not at the moment attend to 
 them, his friends made free to take a walk round his 
 grounds, and probably, by mere chance, happened to 
 pass by .a young cherry tree with a single fniit on 
 one of the twigs. One of the gentlemen at once reach- 
 ed up his hand and thoughtlessly plucked the fruit, 
 which soon vanished from sight, tho gentleman re- 
 marking, that it was a most excellent cherry I After re- 
 turning to the house, Sir. Buel had got through with 
 his business, and at once offered to accompany the 
 gentlemen over his grounds. lie was particularly 
 pleased that they had called upon him at this time, is 
 he wished them to test and examine with him the 
 merits of a new cherry now fully ripe, and which he 
 had originated, and for ten years of his life looked 
 forward to, to see the result of his experiment. The 
 Judge led his friends towards the identical cherry 
 tree from which his friend had plucked the fruit but 
 a few moments before. But on coming to the tree 
 and finding his favorite cherry gone, his chagrin and 
 mortification may be more easily imagined than de- 
 scribed. And what were the feelings of the gentle- 
 man who so heedlessly destroyed the Judge's long 
 cherished expectations? I will lot the reader judge. 
 The gentlemen soon took their leave, and the one 
 who committed the act afterwards stated, that if mo- 
 ney could have replaced the fruit on the tree, he 
 would have considered a thousand dollars a mere tri- 
 fle towards rectifying the error so inconsiderately 
 committed, and the distress of mind which he suf- 
 fered. 

Some of your readers no doubt will say this is an 
 extreme case. So it is: yet the crime is none the 
 less, when a man, for instance, devotes his land, his 
 money, and his time, to colbcting and cultivating 
 ciioiee varieties of fruit, and after ten or fifteen years 
 of anxious solicitude, w^cn his trees may commence 
 bearing, and he is about being rewarded for his labor 
 and his pains with a crop of fruit, to find that gentle- 
 men with aogs and gnns, take the liberty of free in- 
 gress and egress to his fruit trees, " taking the best 
 and destroying the rest." It is a crimo of far "deep- 
 er dye" and should be so considered in the " eye of 
 the law." 

Hoping that the necessary steps will be taken to 

remedy this crying evil, I remain yours,

Lime in Old Gardens. — Old garden soils which 
 have been very liberally manured, sometimes be- 
 come sour for want of an alkali, and in such cases the 
 use of lime, and even of quick lime, is judicious. 

Mr. Editor. — I was much pleased at observing an 
 article in your last .Journal, condemning the practice 
 of fruit stealing, which has become so prevalent al- 
 most every where. Your sentiments on that subject 
 coincide entirely with my own, and there is no doubt 
 that every honest person in the community will sus- 
 tain you in the position you have taken, and the es- 
 timate you have placed upon the character of the 
 pilferer of his neighbor's fruit. 

For years 1 have given considerable attention to the 
 cultivation of fruits, and have succeeded in raising 
 some of a very superior character; but when this is 
 said, all is said, -i have cultivated the fruit, but have 
 scarcely had even the poor privilege of tasting or see- 
 ing it ripen, my peculating neighbors having invaria- 
 bly appropriated it to their own purposes. So dis- 
 couraging have these frequent thefts been, that I 
 have almost determined to cut down every fruit tree 
 upon my premises, unless the future promises some 
 hope of protection through legislative aid. 

Why should the farmer and fruit grower not be 
 protected in their rights. No other class of the com- 
 munity suffer more from dishonest persons, while 
 none are so poorly protected. Every thing belonging 
 to the merchant is carefully guarded by the law, while 
 the farmer is left to the mercy of plunderers on all 
 sides, and in many cases without any redress. Not 
 only is our fruit stolen, but our farms are invaded at 
 every point. Fences are torn down, our growing 
 crops trodden down by idb hunters, and very oft«n 
 our corn fields are pillaged. If a word of remon- 
 strance is offered, a volley of insolent abuse from 
 these marauders is all the return wo get. Several 
 of my neighbors have, in addition to their fruits, lost 
 large numbers of chickens, young turkeys, &(;., and 
 they inform me that it is as much as a chicken's life 
 is worth to stray one hundred yards from the dwell- 
 ings. Is not this a most deplorable state of affairs, 
 and does it not demand redress ? I think so. 

Provision, I am aware, was made by our legisla- 
 ture last winter, against injury done to fences, and so 
 far as that law goes it is an excellent one ; but it is 
 not comprehensive enough to protect the farmer in 
 all his rights, and it is not only mine, but the earn- 
 est wish of all with whom I have conversed, that a 
 vigorous effort will be made during the coming ses- 
 sion of the egislature to procure the passage of a law 
 that will effectually remedy these evils.

Seedless apples. — Mr. E. A. Graham, of Portland, 
 Conn., writes us that seedless apples are produced in 
 his neighborhood by raising the trees from layers. A 
 branch of a young grafted tree is bent down and a 
 portion of it covered with earth, where it remains till 
 it has taken root, when it is cut away from the pa- 
 rent tree and planted out. We do not believe that 
 the absence of seeds in the fruit is attributable to the 
 mode of propagation. — Gennesee Farmer.
