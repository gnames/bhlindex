 Cedrus Dcodara, Deodar Cedar.— So named from 
 its bein"- used by the Hindoos in its native mountains 
 as incense wood and accounted sacred; is, in our 
 opinion, the first in gracefulness and beauty of all 
 foreign coniferous trees, which have been found adap- 
 ted to our climate. Differing entirely in appearance 
 from the deep hues and bold and heavy outlines of 
 some of the more stately pines and firs, its character- 
 istic features convoy the impression of something 
 light, airy and graceful. The foliage of the deodar 
 approaches a silvery color, more than any other ever- 
 green, its branches are beautifully pendent, and it 
 has the great merit of being quite a rapid grower.— 
 To produce its best effect, it should be planted singly 
 and somewhat apart from other trees. Its native 
 locality is the Hymal.ayan mountains in Asia, where 
 it is found of immense size at an elevation of eight to 
 ten thousand feet. Ifaving been introduced into 
 England and this country, within comparatively a 
 few years, it cannot yet be obtained of very large 
 size. The oldest specimen in England is but twenty- 
 five to thirty feet in length. In the Queen's gardens, 
 at Kew, there is a wide avenue, two thousand eight 
 hundred feet long, lined with deodars. 

Arancaria Imbricata, or Chili Pine, offers the most 
 striking contrast to the preceding, that can well be 
 imagined. It is stiff, formal and altogether unique, 
 and has been most aptly compared to a " gigantic 
 specimen of deep green coral from the depths of the 
 ocean." It is a native of the Cordilleras in South 
 America, where it attains a height of one hundred 
 and fifty feet. Its peculiarity is its pillar-like trunk, 
 which, as well as the horizontal branches, are cover_ 
 ed with scale-like foliage, closely overlaid or imbri. 
 eated. The branches spring out from the trunk, in 
 whorls or circles, and bear at their extremities im- 
 mense globular cones the size of a man's head, and 
 containing numerous nutritious and excellent nuts, a 
 single fruit contains two to three hundred kernels, 
 which arc used as food by the Indians. They are 
 eaten either fresh or roasted, and it is said the women 
 prepare from them a kind of pastry. The fruit of 
 these trees form the regular harvest of some of the 
 native tribes of the Andes. From their not being 

found north of thirty-sis degreed south latitude, foars-- 
 were at first entertained that it would not prove hardy 
 in the United States, but the experience of various 
 partsof the country has settled this question. M't 
 have had it in our nursery rows, during the wintrr 
 without protection, and it has stood out, further north 
 with the mercury several degrees below zero. AV c 
 have found it to suffer rather more, especially tlie 
 first season of being moved, from the hot sun, than 
 extreme cold. With this, as well as many other ex- 
 otics, when transplanted to a new climate and a new- 
 soil, it seems only fair, they should receive protection 
 the first year, both summer and winter. A few ce- 
 dar branches placed around as a shield from ex- 
 tremes of weather, till they become acclimated in 
 their new homes, is a small trouble most amply re- 
 paid, and which would save many a plant and shrub 
 from condemnation, as too tender. A portion of 
 sand should be used in preparing soil for the aranca- 
 ria, and there should be thorough under drainage U> 
 prevent the water from settling about the roots. 

Cryptomeria Japonica or Japan Cedar, is one of the 
 valuable discoveries of the agent sent out by the hor- 
 ticultural society of England. He found whole for- 
 ests of it on the mountains of Japan, at the height of 
 one thousand feet, and like most of the other trees 
 and shrubs from that country, is believed to be per- 
 fectly hardy here. It was only introduced into Eng- 
 land about three years since, and is there called tlie 
 " queen of evergreens," and is considered quite :i 
 rapid gi-ower. One great recommendation in accord- 
 ance with the prevailing taste of the day, for any 
 thing in the shape of a tree that droops, is tliat thii* 
 tendency is one of its striking peculiarities. With a 
 very straight stem, which reaches one hundred feet, 
 beautiful foliage, and very pendent branches, the Ja- 
 pan cedar is probably, going to be as great a favorite 
 in the United States as any other yet introduced.^ 
 The wood is said to be very hard and elastic, " and 
 withstands the most terrific winds or monsoons which 
 devastate that coimtry." The soil recommended for 
 this tree is a sandy loam. , 

Cedar oj" Lebanon, everywhere known by its histo- 
 rical associations, and its frequent use in scripture 
 imagery as a symbol of grandeur and magnificenei'. 
 is a tree perfectly hardy in our middle States, and is 
 of course necessary in every good collection of ever- 
 greens. In its great longevity, its immense horizoil- 
 tal growth of branches which is not so observable in 
 young trees, as when more advanced, and in general 
 massiveness of appearance it is not equalled by any 
 other tree. The largest specimen in England is sev- 
 enty-two feet in height, eight feet in diameter at the 
 trunk, and the diameter of the branches at the head 
 one hundred and seventeen feet. A taller specimen, 
 but not so large, is at the seat of the Duke of Wel- 
 lington, one hundred and eight feet high. The oldest 
 specimen in the United States is said to be in West
