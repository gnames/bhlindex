Chester county, N. Y., about fifty feet high, and 
 planted upwards of forty years ago. The cedar of 
 Lebanon is rather a slow grower, varying from six to 
 twelve inches a year, and perhaps more, according to 
 soil and cultivation, neither is it when small, particu- 
 larly beautiful. It accommodates itself readily to 
 most soils, and there is no difficulty with it after be- 
 ing once established. In its native mountains, the 
 coldest parts of Mount Libanus and Taui-us, travellers 
 assert it is comparatively scarce, and that there are 
 fewer trees to be found there at this time than in 
 England. It is believed that the forests have never 
 recovered from the operations of Solomon's four score 
 thousand hewers. 

Pinus Piiiester or Cluster Pine, Pinus Sylvesiris 
 or Scotch Pine, and Pinus Ausiriaca or Austrian 
 Pine, all resemble each other in habit and gen- 
 eral appearance, and are all well worthy of cultiva- 
 tion and perfectly hardy. The iirst is a great favor- 
 ite in its native country, the south of Europe, and is 
 distinguished by its very long leaves. We have found 
 it difficult to transplant, except when quite small, and 
 find it safer to import in pots, which admits of easy 
 shifting into open ground. When once well rooted 
 requires no special care. The Austrian and Scotch 
 Pipes are more generally known, are of erect and ra- 
 pid growth, and the latter has short, stiff foliage, of 
 rather peculiar green hue. Its timber, which is ex- 
 tensively used, is the deal of the north of Europe.

Shrubs for Hedges. 

The subject of live hedges for enclosures is, as I 
 believe, entitled to more attention in this part of the 
 country than it is now receiving. The great anxiety 
 that was felt fifty or more years ago on account of 
 the prospect of scarcity of wood for fuel or fencing, 
 has very much subsided, the discovery of coal and its 
 general use having released us from fears on account 
 of fuel ; and the great facility and small expense of 
 transporting fencing timber by canal, river, and rail- 
 road, furnishes the supply in market, without diffi- 
 culty or increased price, so that we scarcely give at- 
 tention to its rapid diminution. But it is evident that 
 the continued conversion of wooded lands to cultivated 
 fields, diminishes the supply, and the increase of 
 fences from diminishing the size and increasing the 
 number of fields and plantations, increases the quan- 
 tity required. On the subject of hedges, the first 
 question generally asked is, " What tree or shrub is 
 best suited for the purpose?" This can only be an- 
 swered conditionally, having reference to the purpose 
 for which the hedge is wanted, whether to restrain 
 men, horses, cattle, swine or other animals, or only 
 some of those named â€” the place where it is to grow, 
 upon high or low, wet or dry, fertile or sterile lands, 
 for we see in natural woods that each tree or shrub 
 appears to have a particular soil and exposure favor- 
 able to ite growth, and that in some localities it is 

not found. These and other considerations which 
 may be enumerated, will lead us to believe that a great 
 variety of shrubs and trees may be used for hedging, 
 varying, as the purpose, soil and exposure varies. 

The properties of trees or shrubs requisite fur it 
 hedge, seems to be these among others, viz: 

1. Stiff unyielding stem and branches, the direc- 
 tion of which can not be easily changed by so much 
 force as they are likely to be exposed to, and an ad- 
 ditional advantage would be, in their being armed 
 with thorns to prevent pressure from being applied 
 forcibly. 

2. Great capacity for life, not only that the dura- 
 tion may be long, but that it may not suffer under 
 hedgers discipline, which permits so much life that 
 the hedge may not die, and so little that it shall grow- 
 only very slowly. 

3. Suitable size, either naturally or by trimmini: 
 or clipping; so that the soil shall not bo much ex- 
 hausted by the support of the hedge. 

4. Suitability of the species to the soil, exposure 
 and climate, where the hedge is to be made. 

Of the species having thorns, the Crataegus oxycaii- 
 iJia or English white thorn has been more used in 
 England than any other, and a few hedges Jiave 
 been made in this country; but it has not answered 
 the purpose here so well as our native species, of 
 which we have so many that Cratayns may be alm()sr 
 ranked as an American genus. The populifolia or 
 Washington thorn has been more extensively propa- 
 gated than any other in eastern Pennsylvania, but 
 some hedges of the Cms galli or Cockspur thorn giie 
 reason to suppose that it will have some advantages 
 over the former. Its very repulsive armature togetii- 
 er with its spreading habit of growth will supersede 
 tlie necessity of so close planting as the populifolia 
 requires, especially if swine are not to be guarded 
 against. Eaton, in his Manual of Botany, describes 
 seventeen species of American thorns, nine of which 
 are common in the northern States, and I would 
 suggest that as all of them are thorny in a greater 
 or less degree, it would be worth the attention nf 
 those who desire hedges, to gather fruit of each of tlu- 
 species found in their respective neighborhoods and 
 subject them to direct experiment by forming hedges 
 of each kind, it being I believe certain, that a hedge 
 sufficient to turn cattle, may bo made of any of our 
 native species, some of which, however, are of low 
 growth, and would require no mutilation to abate 
 their growth, but only so much side trimming as t(i 
 keep the hedge from taking too much room. Tht 
 difficulty of raising the young thorn plants or quicks, 
 has done much to prevent the introduction of hedges. 
 The following method has succeeded well : Gather 
 the fruit when ripe ; crush the berries so as to break 
 them that the seeds appear, mix the seeds and broken 
 husks of the berry with an equal portion of very fine 
 sand, put the whole in a heap and cover with six
