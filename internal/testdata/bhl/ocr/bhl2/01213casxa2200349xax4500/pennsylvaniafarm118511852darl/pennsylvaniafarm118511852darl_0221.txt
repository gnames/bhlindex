Americau Association for the advaucemeut of 
 science. 

This body held its annual mooting at New York, 
 in August. The attondanfc of members from various 
 parts of the United States was large, and the sessions 
 drew together large and interested audiences of both 
 sexes. 

The citizens of Albany sl-.owed the members every 
 attention, and they will lonp; remember the hospital- 
 ity and kindness with which they were greeted in the 
 Empire State, which has done more for the cause of 
 science than any other State. In fact, the Natural 
 History survey has already cost about half a million 
 of dollars, and is still progressing. 

Professor L. Agassiz was president of this year's 
 meeting and in his opening remarks ho advised the 
 American cultivators of science to look less to Eu- 
 rope for credit and support, standing upon their own 
 merits and the correctness of the views advanced 
 upon this side of the Atlantic. He recommends the 
 establishment of local museums of the natural objects 
 of diiferent parts of the country — an important hint, 
 but one which cannot be efficiently acted upon until 
 our educational institutions have a better appreciation 
 of general science infused into the bodies which con- 

also ashes and salt, are proper manures for these 
 melons. The analysis both of soils and the plants 
 they are intended to produce cannot bo too much in- 
 sisted upon, for although the theories founded upon 
 such analyses may be at tim ;s erroneous, the facts 
 remain from which more accurate theories and a 
 more correct practice may be based. 

An interesting essay was read by Dr. -J. L. LeConte 
 of New York, recently returned from California, on 
 the geographical distribution of animals in that coun- 
 try. 

Professor E. N. Horsford, of Cambridge, (Massa- 
 chusetts), read a valuable chemical pa]ier on the So- 
 lidification of the rocks of the Florida reefs. 

Professor W. Hackley, of Columbia College, N. Y. 
 presented his mathematical investigations on the pro- 
 per Geomettical form of the Mouldboard of the Plow, 
 one of the results of which is the necessity for a long 
 share. 

Whilst the mere mechanical vanity of this country 
 received a deserved check at the World's fair; we 
 find that wherever mind and science were concerned, 
 America could compete on equal terms with any part 
 of the world. Another example of this truth was 
 given at the Albany meeting where the Committee 
 on microscopes decided that Spencer'.s American in- 
 struments were not excelled by those of any European 
 constructor, although the demand which the exten- 
 sion of microscopic science lias made for instruments 
 of the very best kind, has called much mathematical 

trol them. 

There was not much matter of special interest to I and mechanical talent into this branch of manufac- 
 thc agriculturist brought forward, as this generally ture. 
 finds its way to the agricultural societies and the pe- 
 riodicals devoted to this subject. Dr. J. H. Salis- 
 bury, Chemist to the State Agricultural Society of 
 New York, presented an analysis of the water melon^ 
 and muskmelon, with full details of the various ele- 
 ments which enter into their organisation. Both 
 have marked quantities of phosphoric acid and soda, 
 with lime, carbonic acid, and chlorine. Other ele- 
 ments occur in smaller proportions. It results from 
 these analyses that animal matter, or bones and flesh,

Whilst in Albany we visited the rooms of the State 
 Agricultural Society, where there is a good display 
 of implements, including materials for a history of 
 the plow, such as old forms which, if not thus pre- 
 served will not be known in future generations. — 
 Some of these are very curious, as the awkward two 
 wheel plow used in Canada. 

People too proud to work are much rarer than those 
 who are too Iczy.
