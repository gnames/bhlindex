5) Polassutm. This is the metallic base of common 
 potash. It (loos not exist pure in nature, but is fre- 
 quently met with in combination with a salt. In the 
 form of a chloride, it ia found in small quantity in 
 eea water, more abundantly in the ashes of most 
 plants, and frequently in the soil. It is one of the 
 principal constituents of felspar, by the decomposition 
 of which soils are supplied with it, whence it is taken 
 up by growing plants. Soils contain it in the form 
 of silicates, carljonates, muriates, aitrates and phos- 
 phates ; and in vegetables it is usually found as a 
 carbonate, phosphate, sulphate, or nitrate. Potash 
 is an indispensable element of vegetables. Of the 
 cultivated plants, potatoes, turnips, rape, maize, clo- 
 ver, lucerne, esparcette, beans, peas, vetches, and 
 buckwheat, require liberal supplies of it; and so like- 
 wise, among forest trees, do the elm, the beech, the 
 asli, the hornbeam, the linden, and the willow. 

G) Sodium. This is never found free, but occurs 
 plentifully in nature, in various combinations. As 
 chloride of sodium it exists abundantly in sea water, 
 from which it is obtained by evaporation as common 
 sea salt. It is also found in masses or beds, as rock 
 salt, at considerable depth in the earth, in various 
 countries. Sodium in combination with oxygen forms 
 common soda, which has a powerful affinity for acid. 
 We may properly infer that soda is indispensably re- 
 quired by plants, and we find it in the ashes of most 
 of them ; and many will thrive well only in soils con- 
 taining it in abundance — such as the Salicornia and 
 Salsola, the Glaus maritima, the Pod maritima, &c. ; 
 and hence those plants are found only in the vicinity 
 of salt springs and on the seacoast. Of the inland 
 plants, those which are very nutritious — such as the 
 dandelion, the clovers, lucerne, esparcette, and the 
 cabbages — are found to contain much soda, and doubt- 
 less owe their great nutriciousness to that circum- 
 stance. Such plantsare not only devoured greedily by 
 cattle, but are highly conducive to health and the 
 production of fat. 

7) Calcium. This is a silver-white metal, which 
 Vjy union with oxygen, forms lime. It is not found 
 in an uncombined state, but in its various combina- 
 tions is of the greatest importance in practical agri- 
 culture. Calcareoue earth combined with carbonic 
 acid, constitutes common limestone and marble; with 
 sulphuric acid, it forms gypsum; and in combin.ation 
 with phosphoric acid, it is found in several minerals 
 — such as apatite and phosphorite — in marls, in soils, 
 and in bones of animals. It is also found combined 
 with silicic acid, not only in minerals, but in the soil 
 and marls of alluvial districts ; and the ashes of ma- 
 ny plants contain it in excess, in combination either 
 with phosphoric, sulphuric, silicic, or carbonic acid. — 

It is a well ascertained fact that calcarious earth, is 
 indispensably necessary for the growth and due de- 
 velopment of nearly all plants ; but great diversity 
 of opinion prevails as to the proportior al quantity 
 which soils should contain to be very fertile. From 
 three to four per cent, is the usually assumed propor- 
 tion, through Sprengel states that most of the soils 
 celebrated for their productiveness, which were anal- 
 ized by him, contained only one-half of one per cent. 
 But he fouud the calcareous earth in these invariably 
 in combination with substances wliich rendered it 
 readily soluble and thus facilitated its absorption and 
 assimilation by the plants. But in such cases a ra- 
 pid diminution of the quantity of lime in the soil fol- 
 lowed the cultivation of crops ; because, in addition 
 to what was taken up by the plants, much was leached 
 out and carried off by rain water. Sulphate of lime 
 is present in many soils, and is found in the ashes of 
 many cultivated plants. It is employed, in the state 
 of powder, as a means of increasing the fertility of 
 land, and is found to promote the growth of those 
 plants especially which require both lime and su!- 
 plmr. Spring water containing it, may be advantaf o- 
 ously applied for the irrigation of meadows. 

8) Aluminum. This is the basis of clay, which is 
 very abundant in nature and forms a large portion 
 of the crust of the globe. Though belonging to their 
 chemical constituents, plants contain only a Terj 
 small qi»intity of aluniinous earth. Soils which con- 
 tain a large portion of it are difficult to work ; and 
 the most fertile soils usually contain comparatively 
 little of it — not exceeding from two to four per cent. 

9) Iron. In its combination with oxygon, this sub- 
 stance exerts a very important influence on vegetable 
 life; and in this state it exists abundantly in natarc. 
 The first, or protoxid is rarely found in soils, except 
 in combination with an acid. The second, or perox- 
 id, is much more common, and imparts the reddish 
 color observable in many soils. 

10) Manganese. This is a metal, but is never 
 found in a pure state, being always in combination 
 with oxygen or sulphuj. As it is found in almost all 
 parts, it seems essential to their growth. But it is 
 not yet ascertained whether it acts on them directly, 
 per se, or whether it is absorbed, merely in conse- 
 quence of its intimate connection with iron, of which 
 it is a faithful associate. 

From the foregoing enumeration, it is obvious that 
 very few of these simple substances occur naturally 
 in a pure state, but are found in various combina- 
 tions and forms, in the soil. The chief cause of these 
 combinations appears to be in the powerful tendency 
 of oxygen to unite with the several elements, — though 
 there are some combinations in which oxygen bears 
 no part. Furthermore, oxygen is present in very dif- 
 ferent proportions in most of those combinations; 
 and thus numerous bodies possessing various proper- 
 ties are produced. When oxygen unit-es with another
