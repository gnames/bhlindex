top-dressing by way of sheltering and protecting the 
 tender blades and rootlets from the intense frosts and 
 relaxing thaws of the approaching season, and to 
 quicken them into action so soon as the earliest breath 
 of spring breatlies upon them, so as by rapid growth 
 they make up for their backwardness in the fall, and 
 mature in season to escape blight. To this end I re- 
 commend a top dressing of unrotted litter, forked 
 from the barn yard and stable manure, to be carted 
 on and spread evenly and lightly over the grain, so 
 soon after the first frost shall have frozen the ground 
 sufficiently hard to prevent the wheels from cutting 
 into it. The first rain or snow afterward will flatten 
 it do'ivn, close over and around the roots, protecting 
 them in a great degree from the intensity of succeed- 
 ing frosts, and affirding to them invigorating warmth 
 and nourishment for an early start in the spring. — 
 If the ground has been well manured previous to 
 seeding, care must be taken to carry out as little of 
 the ' short dung with the litter as possible; this can 
 easily bo managed by shaking off extraneous matter 
 in forking. If sufficient litter is not at hand, at first, 
 to topdress the whole, whatever accumulates after- 
 wards should occasionally be spread through the ear- 
 ly part of the winter, as opportunity may occur, until 
 all the grain has been dressed. The short straw fre- 
 quently loft in the barn yard from the threshing ma- 
 chine, though not saturated by the cattle or horses, 
 may, if early applied, prove highly advantageous. 
 Let no one be deterred from applying the litter or 
 straw upon their grain fields through fear of encour- 
 aging the fly, or be so solicitous as to the appearance 
 the litter, when dry, in spring, will present, for the 
 young wheat and grass plants will soon push through 
 it, and it will in a short time sink to the surface as 
 it becomes moistened with the dew and rain, and 
 ■will moreover, exert a beneficial influence on the 
 wheat, and insure well set grass in the stubble when 
 the grain is reaped. 

Permit me to add, that experience in top dressing 
 late sown grain, qualify me to bear testimony in fo- 
 vor of its great utility. I have practised it every 
 year on grain sown on potato land, which from the 
 lateness of the seeding, caused by the delay in gath- 
 ering the potato crop, rendered the practice of top 
 dressing, in my judgment, indispensable. Through 
 a series of years I never failed in reaping a first rate 
 crop of wheat under this practice. In 1842 I gather- 
 ed over 440 bushels of fine Mercer potatoes to the 
 acre, field culture, and actually reaped the next har- 
 vest, from the same land, quite fifty bushels of white 
 wheat to the acre : the seed of which I had from my 
 esteemed friend, Capt. John Steele, of Paradise, Lan- 
 caster county. Last harvest, of wheat so treated, top 
 dressed, I must from appearance have reaped not 
 loss than forty bushels to the acre from three to four 
 acres of land, from which a crop of potatoes had been 
 gathered the previous season. Many I fear will 

think the practice here recommended too trouble- 
 some. To such I take leave to say, they should not 
 hesitate to take a little additional pains to secure a 
 remunerating crop for the labor already bestowed 
 upon it, which present appearance, without some fur- 
 ther effort may prove labor lost. A poor crop of 
 grain at harvest, with badly set grass, are circum- 
 stances that every farmer must deprecate. What 
 prudent man but would give a trifle to insure that 
 which might be deemed at risk or in jeopardy.

Agriculture in Pennsylvania. 

Mr. Editor : — Much has been said of late about 
 the agricultural progress and standing of Pennsylva- 
 nia, and comparisons have been drawn between her 
 and other members of the Union, rather derogatory 
 to our own State. 

Now, Mr. Editor, I have repeatedly contended that 
 Pennsylvania is in advance of other States, in agri- 
 cultural improvement, — at least in the cultivation of 
 the soil and the condition of farms generally. 

In riding along our railroads, turnpikes, and pub- 
 lic avenues, these facts must be evident to those who 
 have traversed ours and other States sufficiently to 
 institute a comparison. They will see in Pennsylva- 
 nia finer fields, cleaner and more completely tilled ; 
 fences of better style and in neater condition ; the 
 system of rotation more closely observed and prac- 
 tised; the returns of field crops equal to, if not ex- 
 ceeding, generally, those of other States, while our 
 farm buildings, at least our barns and stabling, are 
 greatly superior to those seen elsewhere. 

Having said thus much for our fields and our 
 farms, the superiority of which I think should be 
 conceded, it may be well to turn for a moment to the 
 other side of the picture and note the " short comings" 
 and deficiencies of our good citizens. AVhen our 
 farmers visit the agricultural .shows and fairs of the 
 Eastern States (which they do quite too i-nrelv) 
 surprise is excited at the great display made l.iy dis- 
 tricts that appear inferior to their own, in the means 
 of producing, whether of quality or kind, the variety 
 concentrated in their show grounds. The surprise is 
 still greater when on visiting the best markets north 
 and east of us, they are not found to equal our own, 
 and especially that of Philadelphia. 

What, then, is the reason, that they so far excel us 
 in the annual display of their agricultural products ? 

Several causes may be assigned for this, in some 
 respects real, in others apparant superiority. Not- 
 withstanding we have more highly cultivated farms, 
 and finer barns, aifording more abundant food and 
 better shelter, with a climate unsurpassed for the 
 rearing of stock, our cattle, horses, sheep and swino 
 are in the aggregate inferior to tliose of New York 
 and the New England States. In the breeding of
