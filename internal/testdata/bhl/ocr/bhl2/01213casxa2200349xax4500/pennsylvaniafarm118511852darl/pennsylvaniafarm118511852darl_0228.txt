stock with very few exeeptiona our farmers are ex- 
 ceedingly deficient; and equally so in orchard fruits 
 of nearly all descriptions. We should seek for better 
 kinds, and when we have them should make it known 
 by bringing them out on public occasions as do our 
 eastern neighbors. 

Even this inferiority of stock is overcome by the 
 fruitfulness of our soil and the skill of our graziers 
 as is shown by our unrivalled shambles, while the 
 butter, the milk, the field vegetables and the finer 
 products of the garden have given to the markets of 
 Philadelphia a high reputation the wide world over. 

Now, with the advantage of a fine climate and our 
 superior farms which pour their wealth so profusely 
 into the pockets of our hardy yeomen, why is it that 
 we fail in some important particulars? Is it not 
 mainly owing to the want of that free and social in- 
 tercourse which distinguishes the citizens of the 
 northern and eastern States. 

Unlike them, our farmers are reserved and recluse 
 in their manners and habits ; they seldom' mingle to- 
 getlier in societies or associations, and of course have 
 not the benefit resulting from frequent interchange 
 of opinions. Some of the happy results of assembling 
 together for discussion and social conversation, are 
 the desire given to. communicate knowledge; the in- 
 formation imparted or received; gradually acquiring 
 the means of communicating our ideas and thoughts 
 to others, and in a word rapidly promoting the habit 
 of inquiring, reasoning, thinkiiiy— that thinkiny which 
 gives to the yankee his cuteness, or rather his great 
 intelligence. 

In travelling through a rough and poor district of 
 Massachusetts where the people might starve if they 
 depended on the soil alone for sustenance, but where 
 their houses and homes looked comfortable, I was 
 asked by a fellow passenger what they lived upon. 
 The very natural reply suggested itself to my mind 
 that " they lived upon their wits." 

These people owe their wit as we call it, or the 
 knowledge by which they live and prosper where 
 others would starve, to attendance in the first place 
 at their excellent pulilic schools, and then by becom- 
 ing members of agricultural and other societies, and 
 by reading books which treat on the business and 
 ■ pursuits of life. It does not take such men long to 
 understand that a good horse or cow or sheep costs 
 no more to raise than one of inferior kimi, while it 
 will when ready for market sell higher, and they 
 therefore seek for the best. If we can induce our 
 Pennsylvania farmers to form in every neighborhood 
 agricultural societies or clubs and especially to sub- 
 scribe for and read such works as the Pa. Farm Jour- 
 nal they would not be long in discovering wherein 
 there is room to improve their condition and pros- 
 pects. 

Our fine fields would never be covered with 
 "mountain scrubs" when a better race could be 

found, and our farm stock like our crops would vie 
 with the best of any land. Farming implements 
 would by the same means be improved even beyond 
 their present high standard and the character of 
 Pennsylvania as an agricultural State of the first or- 
 der would be sustained and promoted.

How should young farmers spend their winter 
 eieiiiiigs. 

Winter is approaching, — the long evenings are at 
 hand, and the holiday of the farmer is near. Young 
 man, you, I mean, who purpose devoting your life 
 to agricultural pursuits, have you determined upon 
 any plan of spending yuur winter evenings? If you 
 have not, let me suggest one. 

Are you familiar with the great principles upon 
 which the noble science to which you purpose devot- 
 ing your life, is based? Perhaps you will answer, 
 yes ; but before you do so, pause a moment and re- 
 flect. I do not desire to know whether you can plow, 
 or reap or mow, or pei'form any or all of the duties 
 of the farm ; but whether you are conversant witli 
 those broad principles which lie at the foundation of 
 agriculture, and without a knowledge of which you 
 can never become a true farmer ? Or, to make mat- 
 ters plain, if not familiar with them, are you endea- 
 voring to become so ? If you are not, you have an 
 important duty to perform — a duty you owe to your- 
 self and your profession ; and that is, an immediate 
 attention to those branches of study, which if pursued 
 with a proper spirit, will make you a better farmer, 
 and a wiser and happier man. 

The long winter evenings are approaching, and 
 delightful evenings they will be, if properly improved. 
 You are probably aware that chemistry is the foun- 
 dation stone of agriculture. It performs an import- 
 ant part in almost every process in which you en- 
 gage, and it enables you to understand the various 
 uses of the materials you work with, or produce. — 
 A thorough knowledge of agricultural chemistry, will 
 assist you in overcoming the host of difficulties that 
 stand in the way of the mere working farmer. It will 
 teach you the character and requirements of your 
 soils— the proper application of manures — the most 
 economical mode of feeding your stock — the manage- 
 ment of your dairy — the true value of the crops you 
 grow ; in fact it is the only thing that can enable you 
 to know to a positive certainty, whether the system 
 of farming you are pursuing is the most economical, 
 as well as the most profitable. I might cite a thou- 
 sand instances in which chomis^y has removed mis- 
 apprehensions, and dispelled erroneous theories ; this 
 however, is not necessary. If you have an earnest 
 desire to become a thorough farmer, a bare reference 
 to the advantages to be derived from even a partial 
 knowledge of it will be sufficient. 

Now for my plan. Procure a copy of Liebig's 
 Agricultural Chemistry, and if you can aflbrd it, get
