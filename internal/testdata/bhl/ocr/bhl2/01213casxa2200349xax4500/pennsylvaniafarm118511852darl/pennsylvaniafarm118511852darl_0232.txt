spicioug time for sowing or harvesting. Certain lo- 
 calities have those peculiarities of atmospheric con- 
 ditions, which afford data for estimating changes in 
 the weather to a greater extent than others. The 
 barometer affords the greatest assistance in these 
 prognostications, and no well ordered farm should be 
 without one of these useful instruments, well observed^ 
 Such is becoming the progress of knowledge, and 
 its application to the practical business of life, that a 
 certain amount of education, and an active and 
 thoughful habit of life, are indispensable to success. 
 Every new improvement in agriculture, places its 
 possessor in a situation above his neighbors, in point 
 of facilities, which will enable him to excel those who 
 do not adopt it ; for here, as in manufactures, it is 
 as idle to attempt with the hand rake, and flail, the 
 hoe, and the sickle, to compete with the horse rake, 
 and threshing machine, the cultivator, and the cra.- 
 dle or harvesting machine, as for the housewife to at^ 
 tempt to outdo with her spinning 'wheel, and hand 
 loom, the machinery of the woolen factory. It is true 
 that a multitude of the modern im):Jements offered 
 for agricultural use are no improvements, — many ac- 
 tually worse than useless, and hence appears the ne- 
 cessity of a cultivated habit of discrimination, to en- 
 able one to select the valuable and avoid the worth- 
 less. 

Having dwelt upon the necessity of a habit of 
 careful and constant observation in the farmer, in or- 
 der to enable him to adapt the means to the end, with 
 the greatest success, it remains to Numerate some 
 of the measures best calculated to ensure this end. 

The reason why men differ in their habits of ob- 
 servation, is much the same as that which makes two 
 fields under similar natural circumstances differently 
 productive. AVe often see a field of grain of great 
 luxuriance, by the side of an open and naked com- 
 mon, or a garden teeming with every delicacy of the 
 season, in the midst of an arid district, overgrown 
 with thorns and useless weeds. 

The great secret of success may be embodied in 
 one word,^cuUivatioii. Let a person cultivate in 
 himself a method of noting evcrj- circumstance around 
 him, of reflecting upon its cause, and of following it 
 to its consequences, and he will assuredly acquire 
 this habit so indisponsaljle to success. Let him no- 
 tice the effects of different manures upon soils, the 
 Talative productions and profit of the same grain 
 upon different soils, or different manui-es, and of the 
 same soil with diffiM-eut grains, or under a different 
 system of tillage, or in different seasons, or with dif- 
 ferent preparation. 

Let him watch the effects of fertilizers, the influ- 
 ence of the weather, the habits of insects injurious to 
 his crops, the relative econonij' of diflerent modes of 
 culture, and above all, the better to ensure the con- 
 tinuance of these without interruption, and for future 
 reference, let him acquire the habit of recording, in a 

journal kept for the purpose, a register of his daily 
 observations. 

In no department of daily observation can this be 
 done with greater benefit than with the weather. — 
 If it were for no other purpose than to acquire a ha- 
 bit of observation, this would repay one for the time 
 required, but these records possess an intrinsic value 
 to science, as they enable us to study the laws which 
 govern the origin and progress of atmospheric changes 
 — of infinite practical importance to the farmer and 
 the mariner. 

Efforts are now being made to collect these obser- 
 vations from every part of the continent; and every 
 one who is disposed can have the opportunity of as- 
 sisting in this great work. Printud forms and blanks 
 are furnished without expense by the Smithsonian 
 Institution at Washington, to every one wishing to 
 observe, and in addition to these, those who report 
 receive from time to time publications of great inter- 
 est. 

Another method if adopted, would prove of great 
 service to the farmer, by affording him the data from 
 which to measure not only the success of different 
 systems of tillage, but also his own progress in the 
 science of agriculture, as applied in his labor. This 
 is in the keeping of a, farm hook, in which is record- 
 ed the time and kind of plowing, sowing, and har- 
 vesting his different fields ; — the amount and kind of 
 fertilizers employed, and how and when applied, the 
 quantity of seed used, and the amount, value, and 
 nett profits of the crops. 

It might contain memoranda of the products of his 
 flocks, and dairy, the prices of produce at different 
 seasons, and the relative profits of the different de- 
 pai'tments of his labor. To render this at all useful 
 for ready reference, a regular system of entries shoulil 
 be employed, every subject should be kept by itself 
 and easy reference secured by an index at the end of 
 the volume. 

A tabular arrangement would secure the greatest 
 benefit with the least trouble, and the records of suc- 
 cessive years standing side by side would afford at a 
 glance the most satisfactory information in relation 
 to the past history of his farming opsrations. 

Should one desire to acquire a habit of order and 
 regularity which weuld contribute greatly to success, 
 two books might be kept. In the first he might en- 
 ter the several facts worthy of notice, in the order of 
 their occurrence, in the same manner as accounts arc 
 entered in a day book. A neatly kept volume pro- 
 perly ruled in tables, and furnished with an index, 
 would serve like the ledger to collect in their proper 
 plac&s for instantaneous referehce, the essential facts 
 contained in the former volume. 

Tho time required for those purposes would be in- 
 considerable, as the records might be made at odd 
 moments, while the transcribing into the tabular ar-
