Now, taking a'l those facts into consideration, is it 
 not tlic part of the wise farmer or dairyman, to keep 
 only improved stock. They may cost a- little more 
 in the beginning, but in the end they -vvlll prove the 
 cheapest. The same amount of feed is required for 
 the common cow, tlie same attention is also necessary, 
 while the return she makes, is not half as much as 
 that of one of the improved breeds. If I had the 
 choice, I would rather pay a handsome price for a 
 good Devon, than take a common cow as a gift. 

The cow aljovc referred to is a deep red, and weighs 
 12G9 lbs. As I intend keeping a regular account of 
 the butter we make from her the coming season, and 
 as I hope to increase the amount somewhat, I will 
 give you a full and fair account hereafter.

Maijnolia coiiync-ita — Is a native of the district of 
 Yulam, China. It is perfectly hardy in all the mid- 
 dle States. Tlie tree is of a beautiful conical form 
 and rapid gi-owth ; it attains an altitude of about for- 
 ty feet; when covered with its tulip-like white flowers 
 it is a very attractive object, and as it blooms previous 
 to the expansion of the leaves is one of the earliest 
 harbln;i-ers of spring. It is entirely free from attack 
 by insects, and is unsurpassed as a lawn tree. 

Madura auniiiiiaca, Osage oranije. — This magnifi- 
 cent deciduous tree is found in abundance in Texas 
 and all tlic soutlnvestern States. It is not suffioicnt- 
 ly appreciated as an ornamental shade tree ; very ap- 
 propriate to the park and lawn. Tha tree is of very 
 rapid growth, very graceful in its outline, and has 
 tlie excellent quality of retaining its rich glossy green 
 leaves until extreme frost. It is entirely free from 
 attack by insects. As a hedge plant its merits arc 
 fully appreciated, and in that form is being rapidly 
 difl'used over our country. 

Acacia jxdibrissim. — The "silk tree," of the south, 
 is hardy in liglit soils south of New York. It is a 
 mo::t beautiful slu-ub, producing in clusters numerous 
 tufts of straw colored flowers. The leaves are beau- 
 tifully compounded, very graceful, and of a light sea- 
 green color; the contrast of the flowers and foliage is 
 ry striking. 

IMesia tdraptcra. — The "silver boll" or snow 
 drop of South Carolina, is a beautiful tree, quite 
 hardy in all the middle States and growing to the 
 height of forty feet. The form of the tree is compact 
 and when covered with its innumerable bell-shaped 
 silvery flowers, produces a fine effect. If permitted 
 to branch low, it is quite unique in the landscape. 

Rims cotinus — Vcnitian shumace, smoke tree, mist 
 tree, and brown fringe tree, for by all these names 
 it is known, is a first class shrub, very singular in 
 appearance when in bloom; when in clumps with 
 other shrubs of same size and different foliage it hat 

a fine cfiect and ought to be more extensively culti- 
 vated. James D. Fllton.

Temper iii the family. 

BY MRS. L. G. ABELL. 

None, perhaps, have so many provocations to ? 
 hasty temper as these families where business hur 
 ries and drives from morning till night, and where 
 so much depends on each one performing tlieir part 
 in the right way and right time and place. 

But a little consideration, and care, and watchful- 
 ness over the feelings and words, will do wonders, 
 and tlie sunshine of happiness, and flowers of kind- 
 ness and afl'ection, shall reward with their light and 
 sweetness all efforts to cultivate them, in the heart 
 and liome. 

A bad temper, long indulged, gets at length the 
 entire mastery of the mind, and roots out all the bet- 
 ter propensities, destroys the pleasures of domestic 
 and social life, and is often a source of deeper an- 
 guish than the heart can conceive or pen describe. 

The moral in man should overtake the precedence 
 in all things ; let his business be what it ni.ay he 
 should not forget that he has a capacity for enjoy- 
 ments above those of sense. 

Retioction for one moment, will often cool the 
 risings of a hasty temper. Remember that your 
 own inadvertence and unintentional offences have 
 been mistaken for malice, and you will soon learn to 
 be as lenient to others as you would have them to 
 you. Think of friendships destroyed, wounds made, 
 distress occasioned, alienations produced, by one 
 paroxysm of arger and you will soon become master 
 of so dangerous an enemy. 

If you even receive an injury, or an insult, lot that 
 person know that you are governed by higher motives 
 than to repay him in the same, or to allow the base 
 conduct of another to disturb your own happiness 
 and equanimity. " Overcome evil with good " and it 
 will bring comfort to the injured breast and bo there 
 as afuuniain of perpetual jjeace.

Mr. Editor: — There may be some of your readers 
 who are so unfortunate as to have their potato crop 
 affected with rot in the cellar, which was my misfor- 
 tune in 1850, in one portion of the crop to a great 
 extent. AVhen discovered, I at once turned them 
 over, removing all that were affected ; but that did 
 not arrest its progress. We again turned them and 
 took at the rate of one bushel air slacked lime and 
 two bushels charcoal dust to the hundred bushels of 
 potatoes, and liberally sprinkled them when turning. 
 Us effects were magical; the whole atmosphere of the 
 cellar was purified, the disease arrested and even the 
 partially decayed parts dried up. We feel assured 
 that any who try it will arrive at the same happy re- 
 sults. Yours truly, R. BuisT.
