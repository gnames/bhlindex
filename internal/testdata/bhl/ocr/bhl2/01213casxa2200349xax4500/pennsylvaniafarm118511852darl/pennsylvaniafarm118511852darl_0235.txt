Montgomery County Exhibition. 

The annual exhibition of the Montgomery county 
 society was held at Springtown, two and a half miles 
 from Norristown, on the first and second of October. 
 We embraced the occasion to spend a few pleasant 
 days with our agricultural friends in Montgomery, 
 and arc free to state that a more agreeable visit we 
 have never paid. Wo reached the grounds at an 
 early hour on the morning of the first, l)ut found that 
 there were " earlier birds" than ourselves; as the en- 
 closure was rapidly filling with visitors, and quite a 
 number of fine cattle, and a large variety of agricul- 
 tural implements, produce, &c., were in their appro- 
 priate places. As the day promised to be an exces- 
 sively hot one, we availed ourselves of the coolness 
 of the morning to examine the handsome arrange- 
 ments of the society, which we think far superior to 
 those of any other society whose grounds we have 
 visited. 

The grounds contain five acres, surrounded with a 
 most substantial board fence, six feet high. The 
 whole of one side is occupied by sheds and stalls for 
 cattle. A large portion of another side is devoted to 
 pens for sheep, hogs, &c., and about two-fifths of the 
 whole enclosure is appropriated to the showing of 
 horses. Suitable places are assigned to the display 
 of agricultural implements, machinery, &c. 

In the centre of the enclosure is a very handsome 
 building, 85 by 35 feet. The whole of the lower part 
 of the building is in one room, which was well filled 
 with agricultural produce, specimens of mechanical 
 skill, &o. The centre room up stairs is 50 by 35 
 feet and is occupied by the ladies, who, on this occa- 
 sion, made a most creditable display of their handi- 
 work. At each end of the building, up stairs, is a 
 room used for committee purposes. The buildings, 
 eheds, stalls, fence, &c., are handsomely whitewash- 
 ed, giving the whole a neat and cleanly appearance. 

The use of the grounds is given to the society free 
 of charge for twelve years, by the owner of the pub- 
 lic house directly opposite. If, at the end of that 
 time the society desire to remove to any other place, 
 they have the privilege of removing the buildings, 
 but not the fence around the enclosure. The fact 
 deserves to be mentioned that the proprietor of the 
 grounds also contributed the handsome sum of §400 
 towards the erection of the fence. 

All these improvements have been made within a 
 few years. Ttie society is free from liabilities, and 
 in a highly prosperous condition. And now a word 
 in regard to the exhibition. 

The display of cattle, all things considered, was 
 very good. There were not many varieties, but those 
 exhibited, were generally in good condition and evin- 
 ced careful treatment. Our limits will not permit us 
 to particularize. 

A number of horses were exhibited, amongst which 

wo observed several fine stallions, and quite a goodly 
 number of mares, colts, young horses, &o. 

The display of agricultural implements, was, we 
 understood, not so large as that of last year, it being 
 confined mainly to those kinds manufiictun^d in the 
 adjoining counties, yet it was creditaljle and attract- 
 ed much attention. 

Samples of excellent corn, wheat, and other pro- 
 duce were exhibited in the lower saloon of the main? 
 building. There were but few vegetables, the exces- 
 sive drought having injured them greatly. We ol> 
 served s<ime superior potatoes as well as cabbages, 
 beats, &c. Quite a number of household articles 
 were also exhibited in this apartment. 

In the upper saloon, the ladies had it all to them- 
 selves, and as usual, by their good taste and skill 
 succeeded in keeping their apartment crowded with 
 visitors during the whole time of the exhibition. 

On the afternoon of the same day, the annual ad- 
 dress was delivered to a largo and attentive audience 
 by the Hon. Wm. D. Kelley, of Philadelphia, and 
 did infinite credit to that gentleman's head and heart. 
 As we hope to be able to present it to our readers at 
 some future day, we defer further notice. 

The number of visitors was very larn-e, and all 
 seemed delighted with the exhibition. In concluding 
 this hasty sketch. We cannot but tender our most 
 sincere thanks for the many gentlemanly courtesies 
 extended us by the officers of the society as well as 
 many other gentlemen. The yeomanry of Jlontgo- 
 mery, gave us in addition, a most tubstantial evi- 
 dence of their appreciation of our efl^Virts to aid the 
 cause of agriculture, by adding several hundred 
 names to our subscription list. 

Worth Knowing.— A young lady of this city, says 
 the Philadelphia Evening Post, wliile in tlie country, 
 some years ago, stepped on a rustv nail, which ran 
 through her shoe and foot. The "inflMininuUiou and 
 pain was of course very great, and lock-ja^v appre- 
 hended. A friend of the family, however, recom- 
 mended the application of a beet, taken fresh from 
 the garden, and pounded fine, to the wound. It was 
 done, and the effect was very beneficial. Soon the 
 inflammation began to subside, and by keepino- on 
 the crushed beet, changing it for a frcsii one as its 
 virture seemed to become impaired, a speedy cure 
 was effected. Simple but effectual remedies like this 
 should be known to every one. 

Red Antwerp Raspberry. — The American Agri- 
 ctil/urisf says, we hear of magnificent ri-turns of la- 
 bor, land, and capital devoted to this splendid fruit. 
 Oni? horticulturist, in Connecticut, realised SSOO for 
 his last year's crop, on half an acre, wliile tlie huck- 
 ster to whom he sold them gained nearly as much 
 more. 

,_ AU roots should be excluded from the light 
 during the winter, and kept in as low a temperature 
 as can be made convenient without danger of freez- 
 ing.
