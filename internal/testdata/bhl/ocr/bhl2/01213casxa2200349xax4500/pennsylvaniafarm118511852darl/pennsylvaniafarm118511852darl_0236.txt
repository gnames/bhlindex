The Alderneys. 

The Normandy cattle are from the French conti- 
 nent, and are larger and have a superior tendency to 
 fatten ; others are from the islands of the French 
 coast; but all of them, whether from the continent or 
 the islands, pass under the common name of Alder- 
 neys. 

They are found mainly in gentlemen's parks and 
 pleasure-grounds, and they maintain their occupancy 
 there partly on account of the richness of their milk, 
 and the great quantity of Ijutter which it yii^lds, but 
 more from the dimunitivc size of the animals. Their 
 real ugliness is passed over on these accounts ; and 
 it is thought fashionable that the view from the l)rcak- 
 fast or drawing-room of the house should present an 
 Alderney cow or two grazing at a little distance. 

They are light red, yellow, dun or fawu-rolored ; 
 short, wild-horned, deer-necked, thin, and small 
 boned ; irregularis', but often very awkwardly shaped. 

Mr. Parkinson, who seems to have a determined 
 prejudice against them, says that "their size is small, 
 and they are of as bad a form as can possiljly be de- 
 scribed ; the bellies of many of them are fourfifths of 
 their weight; the neck is very thin and hollow ; the 
 shoulder stands up, and is the highest part; they are 
 hollow and narrow behind the shoulders ; t!ie chin is 
 nearly without flesh; the bucks are narrow and sharp 
 at the ends; the rump is short, and they are narrow 

and light in the brisket." This is about as bad a 
 form as can possibly be described, and the picture is 
 very little exaggerated, when the animal is analyzed 
 point by point; yet all these defects are so put togeth- 
 er, as to make a not unpleasing whole. 

The Alderney, considorino; its voracious appetite — 
 for it devours almost as mum as a short-horn — yields 
 very little milk. That milk, however, is of an extra- 
 ordinary excellent quality, and gives more butter per 
 quart than can be obtained from the milk of any oth- 
 er cow. Some writers on agricultural subjects have, 
 however, denied this. The milk of the Alderney 
 cow fits her for the situation in which she is usually 
 placed, and where the excellence of the article is re- 
 garded, and not the expense; but it is not rich 
 enough, yielding the small quantity that she does, to 
 pay for wliat she costs. On the south coast of Eng- 
 land, there is great facility in obtaining the Alder- 
 ney cattle, and they are great ftivorites there. 

One excellence it must be acknowledged that the 
 Alderneys possess ; when they are dried, they fatten 
 with a rapidity that would be scarcely thought posi- 
 ble from their gaunt appearance, and their wants of 
 almost every grazing point, while living. 

Some have assigned to the Norman or Aldqrney 
 cattle a share in the improvement of the old short- 
 horns ; but the fact does not rest on any good autho- 
 rity. — Ybttatt <£' Martin on cattle. 

THE ALDERNEY BULL. 

Mice in Barns. — A writer in the Rural Keiv-York- 
 rr. who has suffered greatly by these pc^ls to the 
 fai-mer, states that he has found that hay-mows having 
 sp:\irmint in them, were free from rats and mice, 
 while others, in the same barn, having none of this 
 herb scattered about, were nearly destroyed^ by thorn. 
 Other experienced farmers concur in the opinion that 
 spearmint is a complete antidote against their opera- 
 tions. This is an easily tried remedy, and our farm- 
 cr.^, suffering from the same cause, are recommended 
 to apply it. 

To Bone a Fowl. — Clean the fowl as usual. With 
 a sharp and pointed knife begin at the extremity of 
 the wing, and pass the knife down close tn tlie bone, 
 cutting all the flesh from the bone, and preserv- 
 ing the skin whole ; run the knife down each side 
 of the breast-bone am! up the legs, keeping close 
 to the bone ; then split the back half way up, and 
 draw out the bones ; fill the places whence the bones 
 were taken with a stuffing, restoring the fowl to 
 its natural form, and sow up all the iucisions made 
 in the skin.
