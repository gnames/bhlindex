Credit. — The article on Tobacco, which appeared 
 in our last Xo., should properly h.*ivc been credited 
 to the Southern Planter, from which excellent Jour- 
 nal it was copied. 

"Our absence at the State Fair, and the unu- 
 sual pressure of business which preceded it, must be 
 our appology for the want of proper arrangement of 
 articles in our present number. 

State Ag' icultural Exhibition. 

The first Exhibition of the Pennsylvania State 
 Agricultural Society was held at Ilarrisburg on Wed- 
 nesday, Thursday and Friday, Oct. 20, .30 and 31. — 
 It was an event looked forward to with the deepest 
 anxiety by the friends of agriculture throughout the 
 State, as upon its success or failure depended greatly, 
 the position Pennsylvania would in future assume in 
 regard to her great leading interest. Many conjec- 
 tures were hazarded as to the result of the enterprizc, 
 and not a few of those who most sincerely desired its 
 complete success, were fearful that it would prove a 
 failure. For our own part, we never for an instant, 
 indulged a doubt. We have ever contended that the 
 agricultural resources of our own State are superior 
 Ut those of any other in the Union, and while some 
 have endeavored to create the impression that our 
 farmers were wanting in intelligence and enterprise, 
 we have ever taken the opposite ground. We are 
 now rejoiced to see that the honest yeomanry of 
 Pennsylvania have taken the matter into their own 
 hands, and nobly have they vindicated their charac- 
 ter. It was not the amount of stock, the quantity of 
 agricuUnral productions or the number of implements 
 exhibited that are to be regarded as an attempt on 
 the part of the farmers to place themselves in a right 

position before their agricultural brethren elsewhere ; 
 but it was the immense outpouring of the multitude, 
 and the hopeful spirit that pervaded all. There was 
 no spirit of bravado manifested, but an honest con- 
 viction that Pennsylvania could do better, and a spi- 
 rited determination to establish that fact beyond per- 
 adventure at the next annual exhibition. Our farm- 
 ers are proverbially modest and unassuming in their 
 character, and it required such an exhibition as that 
 held at Ilarrisburg to convince them of the fact that 
 they are possessed of all the material necessary to get 
 up a display inferior to that of no other State. We 
 are neither a prophet, nor the son of a prophet, but 
 we venture the prediction that the next Fair of the 
 Society will equal in every particular those of N. York 
 and far exceed those of Maryland or Ohio. The spi- 
 rit that has so long quietly slumbered in Pennsylva- 
 nia has at length been thorouglily aroused — a proper 
 feeling of State pride has been awakened, and we 
 look forward with a deep and abiding confidence to 
 the day when the people sliall again be invited to bring 
 forward for exhibition the rich agricultural resources 
 of our noble State. 

And now a word in regard to the arrangements. — 
 Our limits will not permit us to say as much as wi; 
 could desire, nor will it be in our power to particu- 
 larize; we must reserve our notices of stock, imple- 
 ments, &c., for a future number. 

The grounds were beautifully located on the east- 
 ern bank of the Susquehanna, about one mile north 
 of Ilarrisburg, and finely adapted to the purpose. — 
 Notwithstanding the rain which fell before and dur- 
 ing the exhibition, no inconvenience was suffered 
 from mud or moisture, every paxt of the enclosure 
 being in a condition fit for a lady's promenade, i 

The fencing, sheds, &c., were erected under'the 
 superintendence of Daniel Wilt, Esq., of Ilarrisbur". 
 The reception and disposition of articles and stock 
 was also entrusted to him, and it is but justice to say, 
 that his multifarious duties were discharged in the 
 most satisfactory manner. 

The tents were furnished by Mr. C. Williams, of 
 Rochester, N. Y., who with his assistants, were on 
 the ground during the whole time. Mr. W. also fur- 
 nished the tents for the N. Y. State Fair. Ilis ar- 
 rangements were most excellent and we are indebt<Ki 
 to him for many courtesies. 

The President, Hon. F. Watts, arrived at Harri.«- 
 burg on Monday, and continued there during the 
 whole week. A world of praise is due Judge Watts 
 for the dignified yet energetic manner in which he 
 discharged his arduous and responsible duties. 

Various members of the Executive Committee were 
 also present rendering good service, and assisting 
 materially in completing the arrangements. 

The Committee of arrangements were untiring in 
 their efforts to provide every thing that could con- 
 duce to the comfort of the animals and convenieDce
