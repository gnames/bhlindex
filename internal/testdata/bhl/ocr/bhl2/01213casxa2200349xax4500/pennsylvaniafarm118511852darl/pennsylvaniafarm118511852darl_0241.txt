Rogers' improTed Subsoil Plow. 

The advantages arising from subsoiling have been 
 so clearly proven, that the attention of farmers is be- 
 ing drawn to it novr in a greater than at any former 
 period. AVe occasionally, it is true, hear a dissenting 
 voice, but this appears to be the result not of any 
 want of faith in the use of the subsoil plow, but of a 
 desire to di-aw out writers upon the subject. Not" 
 withstanding all that has been said in regard to sub 
 soiling, there are still many farmers who do not un- 
 derstand its advantages. It is a well known fact that 
 whore land has been plowed to a certain doptia for 
 Kiany years, the bottom or pan becomes so hard and 
 solid as to prevent the water from penetrating to a 
 greater depth than the pulverized soil, say five or sis 
 inches. In some soils the water may sink to a great- 
 er depth, but it requires a longer time tlian it should. 
 jVs a consequence of this hard pan, the roots and 
 fibres of growing plants are also checked in their 
 search for food. Instead of penetrating to their pro- 
 per depth, it will be found upon examination that 
 their roots curl round, just as though a stone wall 
 liad been encountered by them. This, of course, 
 leaves them in an unhealthy, because an unnatural 
 condition, and the farmer is often led to wonder what 
 can be the cause of the sickly appearance of his crops. 
 Now, whore the subsoil plow is u.sed, this pan is well 
 loosened to a depth of from six to twelve inches. The 
 water which hitherto has been confinoJ to a depth of 
 five or sis inches, now penetrates twice that distance; 
 the roots follow, and the delighted farmer beholds a 
 fine crop, where formerly, the yield had been next 
 thing to failure. 

Science has proven tliat subsoiling is one of the 
 great sources of phosphate of lime. For thousands 
 of years this valuable fertiliser has been accumulating 
 in the hard soil beneath the plowed ground, and 
 there it will remain forever, unless the subsoil plow 
 is brought into use, to dcvelope this rich mine for the 
 farmer. The atmosphere is another great fertilizer, 
 and the land upon which the subsoil plow has been 
 properly used, receives with open mouth the rain and 
 dews, and retains them for use in dry seasons. No 
 one will deny that a deep tilled soil will resist drought 
 much better than one that is shallow tilled, and there- 
 fore, the farmer who after having plowed to the depth 
 of six or seven inches, follows that plowing with the 
 subsoil to the depth of eight or ten more, has a deci- 
 ded advantage over his neighbor who rejects the use 
 of it altogether. In wet seasons, subsoiling acts as 
 a drainer, and in dry seasons it absorbs moisture 
 largely from the atmosphere, and retains it for a 
 much longer period, than where the land is plowed 
 as it is ordinarily done. 

The above cut represents a new cast steel extend- 
 ing point subsoil plow, the invention of C. B. Rogers, 
 of Philadelphia. It will be observed that this imple- 
 ment differs from any other in use, in having but a 
 single handle. This, we are informed by several gen- 
 tlemen who have tried them, is a decided improve- 
 ment, enabling the plowman to work with much 
 greater ease than by the old plan. We saw the plow 
 in operation at Norristown, and could not butadmiie 
 the effectual manner in which it loosened the hard 
 subsoil to a depth of ten or twelve inches, leaving it 
 in a finely pulverized condition. Those farmers who 
 cannot afford to purchase guano or other expensive 
 fertilizers, can certainly afford to purchase one of 
 these, or some other good subsoil plow, and for sur 
 part w:? should greatlj' prefer the use of the subsoil 
 plow to tiic guano even at the same price. 

Lancaster County Ploughing Match. 

The first Ploughing Match ever held in Lancaster 
 Countj', came off on Monday September 29th, on the 
 farm of Mathew Paulding, Esq., in the South West- 
 ern limits of Lancaster city. There were nine com- 
 petitors, evei-y one of whom proved himself a master 
 ploughman. The very unfavorable condition of thi^ 
 ground, led us to believe that it would be impossible 
 for them to do themselves justice ; but with the aid 
 of their splendid teams, excellent plows and superior 
 skill in their management, they succeeded most ad- 
 mirably. The furrows were plowed to the depth of 
 full seven inches, and the ground, all things consid- 
 ered, well pulverized. We doubt whether better 
 plowing could have been done under the circumstan- 
 ces. 

The attendance of spectators was large, amongst 
 whom were a great number of the best and most in- 
 fluential farmers of Lancaster county, all of whom
