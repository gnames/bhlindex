 m mures. miner;tls. ashes, aniinal ami vegetable substances. At:. — 
 Full courses are given in each of these departments, and alS(» in 
 general Chcinislry, boih organic and inorganic. 

Sliideiits can IJuis fit themselves to become inslrnctor« in the 
 various brani-hes of Chemistry, »tr to apply so much of that and 
 kindred aeiences as may lie necessary to the praetn-;il pursuit oi 
 agriculture or irianuluclnnng. The demand for teachers and prn- 
 fessors III the various brandies of cheuiistry, espeeialU agricultu- 
 ral, is MOW great and increasing, so that this is a fair fietdVur those 
 who liave a taste f<pr such pursuits. 

A ctmrseof LeciuresonScieiitific Agriculture, by Professor Nor- 
 ton, commences in Janiiiry of each year, aaU continues for two and 
 a half months. This course is designed especially uir the practical 
 fanner, and has given great satisfaction to tliose who have altenrt- 
 ed it in previous years. It embraces a plain c<nineeted outline of 
 tlie leading pmnts in unproved agriculture, treating in succession 
 of the cinnpiisition (tf the sml, the plant am! tue uiiiinal ; of their 
 connections witii each other, and of all the improvements in culti- 
 vation, manuring, feeding, and fattening, which have been adopted 
 in the bett asricultiirat regions This ctiurse is made so plain and 
 practical, that the farmer who attends itcan understand the whole, 
 and apply it la his own experience. 

More can be learned by attendance upon such lectures, by read- 
 ing in connection with them, and liy associating with others whi* 
 are also desinuis of ohtiiining a better knowledge of their profts- 
 sion thiin in years awayfromsuch advantages Tlieyouiig farmer 
 learns to think for himself, lo see that n practice is not necessnrilv 
 riglit because it is old, to uiulerst.and tlie reasons for all that tie 
 does, and with tins increase of knowledge is better able to make 
 farming profitable as well as interesting. 

Board and lodging may he procured at from S'^ to S3 per week. 
 and the Ticket for the Lectures is SIO.

 ures, marls, Ac . in . a simple way. and to make many eleineniarv 
 examinations of a highly useful character. The charge ivt this 
 cemrse is S'25.
