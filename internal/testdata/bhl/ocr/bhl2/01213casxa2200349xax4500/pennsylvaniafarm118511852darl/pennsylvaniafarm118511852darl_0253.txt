FIRST ANNUAL ADDRESS. 
 Mr. PresidcHi and Gentlemen of the AgricuUural So- 
 ciety: 

"Whilst I am gratefully .sen.sible of the distinguish- 
 ed honor ^vhich you have conferred in selecting me 
 as your organ upon this occasion, I have not the va- 
 nity to suppose that I am indebted for it, by any 
 means, so much to any personal merits of my ovra, 
 as to the accidental circumstance of having been 
 placed, a short time ago, at the head of the Agricul- 
 tural Society of my otto State — an appointment cer- 
 tainly of distinction and honor, but one which, on my 
 part, was as unsought and unexpected, as I feel it to 
 have been unmerited. In accepting tlie invitation, 
 therefore, to deliver tlie Annual Address of your So- 
 ciety, I beg you to do rae the justice to believe, that 
 I was influenced much more by a desire to gratify 
 the -wishes of my agricultural friends and visit this 
 portion of your noble State, than from any impression 
 of peculiar fitness to discharge the duty which your 

VOL. I — J. 

kindness has imposed upon me; and while I am fro*' 
 to admit that this duty is one in harmony with all 
 my feelings and opinions, I must yet say, that I should 
 have been more gratified if it could have fallen upon 
 some other individual more competent and worthy 
 than I am to do justice to the great cause in which 
 we are engaged, and fulfil the just expectations of 
 your Society. But having yielded my assent, and 
 put my hand to the plow, I cannot recede, and I am 
 here to redeem my pledge, in the manner I deem best 
 and most acceptable to you. Allow me, however, in 
 advance to say, that my situation is one of a .some- 
 what novel and embarrassing character. Personallv 
 unknown, with a few excejitions, to the vast croAvIl 
 that surrounds me, might I not say that I stand here 
 to day in the midst of an entire stranger? but I will 
 not, because lought not to say it — for when v,-as it 
 that a Virginian in Pennsylvania, or a Pennsylva- 
 nian in Virginia, was ever regarded as a stranger in 
 a strange land? For more than three quarter.? of a 
 century the States of Pennsylvania and Virginia. 
 amongst the oldest and most distinguished of"" tl:e 
 good old thirteen," have stood by each other, and 
 been united not only in law, but iri hearts and affec- 
 tions — united by conmion benefits, supported by the 
 accomplishment of e((ual and mutual rights — the 
 only union that can best secure liberty and happi- 
 ness. In peace as well as in war — in'every thinp: 
 connected with the interests, prosperity and ha]^ 
 pinessof a common country, Pennsylvania and 
 Virginia have been one and indivisible. And who is 
 there who would wish to see this sacred bond of sym- 
 pathy and afiection broken — dissolved — destroyed? 
 If there be one, let the spirits of the mighty dead, by 
 whose blood and treasure this Union was cemented, 
 rise up and rebuke him! I feel then, Mr. President! 
 that in coming here to mingle in your councils, to 
 interchange opinions and sentiments with your dis- 
 tinguished and enlightened agriculturists — to aid, if 
 I can, in the glorious cause which has brought you 
 together, and to pay the tribute of my afi"ectionato 
 homage, as a Virginian, to old .and patriotic Pennsyl- 
 vania, I am, in truth, no stranger in her land ; but 
 feel that I am entitled to all the kindred rights of 
 brotherhood and hospitality — and liberally they have 
 been showered upon me ! Indeed, since I entered 
 the limits of your St.ate, my reception has been one 
 of continued kindness and hospitality, the memory- 
 of which I shall carry back with me to my home, and 
 cherish to the latest moment of my life.

 heart was not largo enough to cherish at the same
