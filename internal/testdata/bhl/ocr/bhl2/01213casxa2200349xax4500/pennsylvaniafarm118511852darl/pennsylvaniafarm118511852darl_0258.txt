AGRICULTURAL ADDRESS. 

[December, 

steamboat was launched in 1807 or 8 — and now how 
 many thousands are traversing; the waters of Ameri- 
 ca" 

? In 1808, tliere was not a single railroad in the 
 world ! The fire horse will travel in as many hours 
 now, a distance which some years ago, it took as 
 many days and weeks to accomplish. A few years 
 :igo, it took weeks to communicate between the At- 
 lantic cities and New Orleans, which is now accom- 
 plished in a few minutes by the electric telegraph. 

Eleetrotyping was but lately discovered, and a 
 press, capable of pirinting 10,000 cojjies (I believe it 
 has gone up to 20,000) in an hour. 

Gas light was unknown fifty years ago, and now 
 every city and town is lighted with it, and we hear 
 of a still greater discovery, Ijy which light, heat, and 
 motive power can bo produced from water, with little 
 cist. Daguerreotype and Phototype and a hundred 
 i>th(?r types with all their beautiful inventions are the 
 work of the last ten years ; and Gun Cotton and Chlo- 
 roform are of .still more recent discovery. And As- 
 ta-onomy, has come in and added a number of new 
 Planets to the Solar System. 

And yet, Mr. President, depend upon it, that with 
 :t.U our knowledge and improvements of the age, both 
 scientific and practical, there are even Ijetter ways 
 than those now in use, in relation to our field indus- 
 try, and the operation of mechanics. AVho imagines 
 tliat in this immense repository in which we live, the 
 whole of its contents have been exhausted, or a ma- 
 jor part of them ? Why the very discoveries in art 
 and science show that even now in this age of fan- 
 cied maturity, knowledge and science are yet in their 
 infancy. The land that now teems with such splen- 
 did designs and enterprises for the benefit of man, 
 has scarcely yet seen the dawn of that improvement 
 in art and science which awaits it. Who will pre- 
 scribe to knowledge boun-daries, or restrain tha insa- 
 tiable curiosity of man ? AV'ho attempt to set limits 
 to the march of human improvement? 

lias tlie spirit of Philosophical enterprise yet ex- 
 hausted its discoveries in common, or atmospheric 
 elexitricity ; in explosive or physical forces — in atmo- 
 spheric pressure, or electrometers, with all their sul> 
 tlety and power, their excitability, rapidity, and in- 
 tensity of action ! 

Does any one im.agine that the secrets of the ele- 
 ments are "yet exhausted? Tliat the bowels of the 
 earth may not yet teem with unknown treasures ? — 
 That fire and water are not yet to be applied to pur- 
 - poses not less wonderful than that of making the 
 very billows of the ocean conquer themselves ? 

Is it not wonderful to suppose that plants which 
 are now trodden heedlessly under foot may not be- 
 CAjme important objects of commerce, and form new 
 sources of national wealth ? That undiscovered pla- 
 nets may not now be tracing their silent and eternal 
 course in the heavens, whos<i rays ere long may burst 
 upon our sight and renew the vigils of tha astrono- 
 mer? 

Let the bold and rapid course of knowledge and 
 improvement within tlie last half century answer 
 these interrogatives. 

And now, Mr. President, for the application of 
 what has been said to your own State, whicli I ven- 
 ture to say would derive greater benefits from the 
 lights of practical science, the establishment of Agri- 
 cultural Societies, and the diffusion of correct infor- 
 mation as to the best mode of cultivating the earth, 
 than any other State in the confederacy, every thing 
 considered. Mark that ! For who is there that now 
 expects, vrith all the energy and industry of man, 
 that the agriculture of any of the old States, and es- 

reach a high state of improvement, without the aid 
 of agricultural knowledge, and the benefits of modern 
 science, to say nothing of political influence and pow- 
 er? Why sir, as well may we expect to reap without 
 sowing, or the plants that are reared for human sus- 
 tenance, would yield their fruits without human la- 
 bor, as that the theory or proctice of agriculture can 
 be brought to any perfection, or be made to approxi- 
 mate towards it in any very profitable degree, unless 
 those engaged in it can be induced to act more in a 
 body and more in concert, in regard to their great 
 and best interests. And here suffer mo to glance for 
 a moment to the condition of Pennsylvania, and the 
 means she possesses for the highest state of improve- 
 ment, as well in relation to her agriculture, as to 
 other sources of national wealth ; and to see to what 
 extent she is obnoxious to the charge of unscientific 
 and unproductive husliandry. What she ha.s done 
 for agriculture, and wliat she has fi^iled to do. And 
 with all her improvements, and they certainly have 
 been far superior to most of her sister States, and do 
 her honor, who can look through her wide domain 
 and her vast resources, and not be struck with the 
 fact that her agricultural condition is still far, very 
 far below that point of elevation that slie ought to hold 
 in the scale of high farming — -and whilst it will lie 
 readily admitted that in many parti of the State an 
 improving and flourishing system of cultivation pre- 
 vails, tliat has restored in a high degree the produc- 
 tiveness of large portions of her land — yet is it not 
 equally true that these hold but a small proportion 
 of the State? and what is still more surprising is, 
 that where deterioration prevails it is in those parts of 
 the State where the choicest adv-intages for success- 
 ful improvement have been most bountifully shower- 
 ed by a beneficent Providence. I shall not particu- 
 larize lest it might bo thought invidious, and compa^ 
 risons are always odious ! But may I not ask, and 
 I do it in a spirit of perfect kindness, whether there 
 is one land holder or farmer in your State, who is not 
 satisfied that by a different and more improved sys- 
 tem of cultivation than that which now exists, his 
 land would not only be more productive, and his la- 
 bors more successful, but that the value of his pro- 
 perty would be enhanced in a much higher degree. 
 Nor would it, I hope, be considered any disparage- 
 ment of the fixrraers of Pennsylvania, if I were to 
 hazard the conjecture, there is now about nearly eve- 
 ry farming establishment throughout the State, oven 
 the best and most improved, some defect, some mis- 
 management, for the want of skill and attention, over 
 which the eye of the owner has wandered a thousand 
 times without discovering, or, if discovered, without 
 either amendment or ch.ange — -and if we extend the 
 examination to the tillage, draining, enclosures, farm 
 houses, meadows, and various kinds of stocks, I dars 
 vouch enough would be found to occupy the powers, 
 be they what they m.ay, of the most industrious and 
 skilful agriculturists in the State. 

Why, sir, have you not amongst you still a goodly 
 number of that class of cultivators who may be de- 
 nominated the unscientiflcs. and belonging to Miss 
 Edgeworth's celebrated family of tho^'good enoughs," 
 who are so infuriated as to sit down with folded arnii 
 and contented minds, without ever spending a thought 
 or moving a finger towards the modern improvement 
 of the first and best of human occupations, except, 
 indeed, in what they regard as the " good old way." 
 Indeed, h.ave you not men of intelligence and respec- 
 tability, engaged in agriculture professionally, who 
 still imagine that agriculture is all sufficient to takf 
 care of itself, single handed and without concert or 

pociaJly Penr.sylvania and Virginia, can over again co-operation amongst its followers, and that the sin-
