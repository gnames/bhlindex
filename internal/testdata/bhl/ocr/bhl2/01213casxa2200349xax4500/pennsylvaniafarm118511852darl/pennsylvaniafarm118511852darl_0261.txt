domestic animals. We see this exemplified in her improving agricul- 

The remaining eight millions of acres of the twelve, [ ture ; in the increasing numher of her railroads, ca- 
 arc in the hands of about three hundred thousand | naif, turnpikes and bridges, and the increasing facil- 

porsons, who still adhere to the " good old way " of 
 their fathers, in farming or rather in sinking the land 
 and extracting from the virgin soil all it will yield, 
 and returning to it little or nothing in aid of the pro- 
 ductive powers of the land. 

Kow what proportion and in what degree of these 
 three classes Pennsylvania and Virginia can claim, 
 neither you, sir, nor I, will venture an opinion, but 
 f it was put to ajury of enlightened and good farm- 
 ei's to decide, I fear there would be a great predomi 
 nance found in favor of the third class, whom I need 
 not say, belong to the " unscientifics," and that afore- 
 said family the " good enoughs." 

And, in what ratio, Mr. President, do you suppose 
 these farms in ?Cew York have deteriorated in half a 

ities for internal and exlernal communication. The 
 value of her lands, according to the report of her 
 chief magistrate, has increased nearly 30 per cent, 
 in her entire landed property, and many portions of 
 the State, which 20 years ago were barely inhabited, 
 are now filling up with an industrious population, 
 and well cultivated. The Fire Ilorse is busily at 
 work in ^'irginia, traversing every part of her do- 
 minion and his whistle, it is to be hoped, will not on- 
 ly rouse up the " Deer and Eagle of her Mountains," 
 but her hardy and gallant sons from that lethargy 
 and " glorious inactivity " which has so long kept 
 this old commonwealth in the back ground of im- 
 pruvcment,and paralized those energies and resoureoR 
 which were more than sufficient hmg since to have 

century ? AVhy the fact is hardly to be credited, that I placed her in the front rank of national improvement 
 less than seventy years ago they yielded in wheat 1 and greatness ! But her destiny is onward, and God 

from twenty to thirty bushels, aud now only from five 
 to eight! 

From a treatise on "American Husbandry," pub- 
 lished at the close of the revolution, the following 
 statement is made: — " That many parts of New York 
 yield a larger produce in wheat than is common to 
 England. Upon good lands about Alliany where the 
 climate is the coldest in the countrj-, thej' sow two 
 bushels and better to an acre, and reap twenty to 
 forty; the latter quantity is not often had, but twenty 
 to thirty are common, and that with such bad indus- 
 try as would not yield the like in England, aud much 
 loss in Scotland. This is owing to the richness and 
 fertility of the lands." 

And now let us see what is the present yield of the 
 same lands, according to the State census of New 
 York, of 1845. From this it appears that the county 
 of Albany produces 7h bushels to the acre, although 
 the farms are on tide-water and near the capitol of 
 the State, with a good home market and every facil- 
 ity for producing th e most valuable fertilizers. — 
 Duchess county, also on the Hudson, yields an aver- 
 age of only 5 bushels; Columbia, G bushels; llensel- 
 laor, 8; and West Chester, 7. 

To renovate these eight millions of acres would 
 cost a hundred millions of dollars, aud the aggregate 
 loss to New York and the world is estimated at up- 
 wards of seven millions of dollars annually! 

And this state of things, ceteris ])aiihu!<, is as ap- 
 plicable to Pennsyl'. aiiaand Virginia,aud the South, 
 as to New York. 

And then comes the question, wluit escape is there 
 from all this, but to improve aud enrich the lauds by 
 high cultivation, or abandon them and emigrate ? To 
 educate and elevate the agricultural classes ! 

And yet New York, vrith all her wealth and en- 
 terprise, and all her eflbrts to render her agriculture 
 profitable, has done nothing towards a system of 
 ijeneral A;/rii-iilhiral education ! 

With her numerous societies aud associations, she 
 is yet without an Ayrictd/itral School on a scale wor- 
 tliy of her wealth and enterprise. Nor is there one, 
 it is believed, in the United States ! 

How long will it be before this reproach will be 
 wiped out, it must be for New York or Pennsylvania 
 to answer ! 

We, of the Old Dominion, Mr. President, can no 
 longer, I fear, hope to le.td, but must be content to 
 learn, and follow, at least, a while longer. I rejoice, 
 however, in believing that she too is fast yielding to 

speed her success. 

And then again we have another stumbling Idock 
 to all agricultural improvement, which is probably t'l 
 be mot with in Pennsylvania, to an extent quite as 
 great as in some others of her older sisters, and that: 
 is in deep rooted attachment to the old modes of cul- 
 tivation, and in old habits and prejudices descending 
 from father to son, always the most powerful enemy 
 of all new systems of imjirovemonts, and in a great 
 measure, I regret to say, confined to cultivators of 
 the soil. I need not tell von, Mr. President, nor en- 
 lighten this enlightened luidience. how slowly and 
 reluctantly they are yielded by even the most intelli- 
 gent and candid. Ilmice it is that from generation 
 to generation men pass in the track of their prede- 
 cessors, and to conquer this propensity, and the evils 
 which flow from it, is the eftbrt of and one of the 
 best results of modern science connected v>'ith agri- 
 cultural improvement. In vain may tlie tongue or 
 press be emploj'cd to satisfy the practical and unsci- 
 entific farmer of errors and habits which a life of l.i- 
 bor and toil may have confirmed I Hois either deaf 
 or blind to such appeals ? He laughs at all book 
 learning, and sticks to the good old ways which havt? 
 come down from some of his great grand-fiithers ! — 
 There is but one remedy, and that is to make the ex- 
 periment, explain the method, and exhibit the suc- 
 cessful result, and then ho may yield and follow in 
 the foot steps of successful experiment. But even 
 then, as I have before said, most rchu'tantly. [Mr. 
 Stevenson related one or two very striking and amus- 
 ing anecdotes both in relation to England and Amer- 
 ica, to show the force and folly of this inveteracy of 
 habit among farmers, and the prejudices which some- 
 times exist between the two countries as to their 
 modes of farming, living, &c.] 

Nor is this all that the agriculturists have to bear, 
 as a class they are often not only underrated, but sup- 
 posed not to stand upon the s;uue platform in public es- 
 timation, with the learned and liberal professions. 

Now, Mr. President, this is a matter which I re- 
 gard as vastly more important than is generally sui>- 
 posed, and another of the evils to an improved stat« 
 of agriculture. Will you pardon mo for a moment 
 while I say a few words upon the agricultural classes 
 in a country like this, and the nature of their calling. 
 And if it Ijc true, that laljor, occupation, difficulties 
 to absolve, obstructions to overcome, and the lialanc- 
 ing between hopes and fears, constitute the true ele- 
 ments of man's nature, where so much, as in the 
 cultivalion of tlie earth, is to be found the foodful
