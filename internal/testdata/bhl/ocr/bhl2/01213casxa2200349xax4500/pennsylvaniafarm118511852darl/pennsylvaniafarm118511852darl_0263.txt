decorum, .and in a friendly and bcmovolont spirit. — 
 Would not such scenes be well calculated, Mr. Pres- 
 ident, to gladden the heart of every wise and good 
 man ? If there be one who doubts it, I only wish he 
 could have been present at the exhibition in Balti- 
 more, during last week, or been for the last three 
 days here. 

Nor will the benefits of agriculture be the only of- 
 fect of all I have been endeavoring to impress upon 
 our agricultural friends. When regarded in a polit- 
 ical point of view and tho prespority and permanen- 
 cy of our free institutions, what strong inducements 
 we have, not only to uphold, and maintain the rights 
 and power of these glorious old states to whom we 
 are indebted not only for the blessings of our liberty, 
 constitution and Union, but to whom we are too look 
 in tlie hour of peril, for their preservation and perpe- 
 tuity. For let no uian deceive himself in the belief 
 that they can ever be preserved in any other man- 
 ner than in that spirit of compromise and mutual 
 affection in which they were founded by our fathers. 
 To the federal government must be yieldeil the ex- 
 clusive and energetic exercise of all external and na- 
 tional powers secured to it by the constitution. To 
 tlie state governments must be secured the mass of 
 powers which relate to the external and domestic af 
 fairs of the confederacy. 

The rights secured to tho states and the people 
 nrust be preserved inviolable upon the basis of the 
 constitution, then will our glorious Union in the lan- 
 guage of tho Father of his country, "become the 
 main pillar in the edifice of our real independence; 
 of tranquility at home and peace abroad ; of our safe- 
 ty, and prosperity, and of that liberty which we prize 
 so much." Then, and then only, Mr. President, will 
 our Union become immortal. 

These are some of the views which I have felt it 
 my duty to present on this occasion, and which I 
 only regret are not more worthy of the cause, and 
 the consideration and favor with which they have 
 been received by you and the distinguished assembly. 
 One more word, and I shall have done. If, Mr. Pres- 
 ident, we arc to succeed in the scheme in which we 
 are engaged, of restoring and improving the lands 
 and agriculture of our respective states, we must be 
 not onlj" zealous and untiring, but united as a class. 
 Vre must tr\ist in the integrity of our cause, and in 
 the intelligence and enterprise of our people ! 

And if it be true that the price of liberty is eternal 
 Tigilance, not less so is it as to successful agriculture. 
 You, sir, and those who are in high places, must be- 
 come the Warners upon the wall to rouse up and 
 warn farmers of tlie true state and condition of 
 tilings, and of the dangers that beset them, and point 
 ou the means of escape from the breakers upon 
 wlu .'h our agricultural ship has been of late years 
 t03 lapidly driving : and then if they heed not the 
 •warning, Ijut are determined to perish, their blood 
 Will not be requited of the watchmen ! For one, 
 hav. ever, I have no fears of the result, if we are true 
 to ourselves. And why shall we not succeed ? AVhy 
 sit clown in despair ? Our cause is not tho cause of 
 tin great and wealthy of any particular system of 
 pii'.tics, or any party, but the cause of the country! 
 Let us then persevere, and should wo triumph, as I 
 feel confident we shall, then will a new era open 
 upon these old, and venerated, and beloved common- 
 wealths, which, in spite of every difficulty, will carry 
 them through a long course of liberty and honor to 
 the farthest goals of wealth, prosperity and hoppi- 
 ncss.

 Agricultural Chemistry, No. 1. 

We come now to consider the compound substances. 

Atmospheric air is formed by a mixture of one-fifth 
 oxygen with four-fifths nitrogen. As no living crea- 
 ture can exist without atmospheric air, so it is indis- 
 pensable to the growth of plants, and they are fur- 
 nished with peculiar vcs.scls for absorbing it. Bui 
 the soil likewise requires atmospheric air; and hence 
 the groat benefits wliich result from loosening and 
 stirring the ground; as well as tho injury sustained 
 when the land becomes bound and comjiact, or is cov- 
 ered with a crust, so as to be nearly impervious to 
 the air. Atmospheric air is not merely the medium 
 or vehicle by which oxygen is conveyed or .supplied 
 to plants, but it contains al.so other feriform sub- 
 stances, though in minute proportions, which are ab- 
 sorbed in part by the .•^oil and in part by the growing 
 crop or natural vegetation. Impalpable particles of 
 substances not really volatile are also contained in it, 
 which serve as nutriment for plants. Thus during a 
 protracted droiight a large quantity of substances not 
 properly belonging to the atmosphere is taken up and 
 becomes mixed with it, and are then again precipita- 
 ted by rain. The consequence is a more striking and 
 more rapid growth of vegetation, than is observed 
 when rains arc frequent and of long continuance, and 
 the atmosphere is not allowed time to become stored 
 with such fertilizing particles. A further valuable 
 property of atmospheric air, is its capacity to receive 
 and retain the vapor of water, as it rises from the 
 earth. The warmer tlie air is, the greater is the quan- 
 tity of water it will take up; but wheu its tempera- 
 ture is reduced, as during cold nights, i'. part.s again 
 with a portion of the moisture it contains, which is 
 then precipitated in the form of dcAc. The fertilizing 
 effects of dew flow not ahmo from the moisture it 
 supplies, but also from tho gaseous and other minute- 
 ly divided substances deposited with it. Hence the 
 benefits which result from stirring tho .soil during the 
 prevalence of drought, as will bo hereafter noticed. 

Oxygen and nitrogen serve to form other combina- 
 tions also, among which nitric acid is of importance 
 to the farmer. In its pure si:ate this acid acts corro- 
 sively on vegetation; but when converted into a salt 
 Viy means of an oxyd, it acts as a fertilizer in conse- 
 quence of the nitrogen it contains. Hydrogen in 
 combination with nitrogi^n forms -icatcr, without which 
 no living body can grow or thrive. Water operates 
 in a two-fold manner, mechanically and chemically. 
 Its mechanical operation consists in conditioning and 
 promoting action and reaction among bodies. In a 
 dry state different substances may lie side by side fer 
 years without perceptibly affecting one another. But 
 no sooner do they become moistened by water than a 
 reciprocal action commences between them. If tlic
