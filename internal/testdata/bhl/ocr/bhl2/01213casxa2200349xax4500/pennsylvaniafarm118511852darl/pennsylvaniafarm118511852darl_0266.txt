In peculiar circumstances, it is decorapogod and 
 taken up as food by plants, which require large quan- 
 tities of it for the formation of their solid parts — as, 
 for instance, the stalks, grasses, reeds, &c. 

Silicious earth is seldom found pure in sand, but 
 ^r'ncrally in combination with other substances, as 
 |)>tash, soda, lime, iron, &c., forming silicates with 
 them. But carbonic acid has a much greater affinity 
 l(.r these substances than they have for silicious acid; 
 and one consequence thereof is, that, when in combi- 
 nation with water it conies in contact with them, the 
 union between them and the silicious acid is dissolved 
 and the formation of earhonafes is the result — the 
 silicious acid meanwhile remaining uncomhined, is 
 taken up in its soluble state by the water and thus 
 made available as food for plants. 

Oxygen in combination with potassium forms an 
 ctyd which is called jfo/a.v/f. 'When pure or uncom- 
 combiued with an acid, it is caustic and corrosive; 
 but it never occurs in soils in this condition, for the 
 potash unites w-ith carbonic acid and forms a salt— 
 the carbonate of potash — which is a very soluble sub- 
 stance and a principal constituent of most plants. — 
 I'otash is also found in combination with sulphuric 
 acid, and then possesses great fertilizing properties. 
 With nitric acid it forms saltpetre; and as a silicate 
 of potash it constitutes a salt, which is not readily 
 soluble, but may be decomposed by carbonic acid. 

As potash is a principal ingredient of many plants, 
 the farmer should be careful that it occurs in a solu- 
 ble condition in those of his fields in which crops re- 
 quiring large supplies of this substance are intended 
 to bo grown. This may be effected in various ways. 
 If the soil contain much clay, it also contains potash, 
 and it is only necessary to remler the latter soluble, 
 which is accomplished by the frequent use of the 
 plow, thereby loosening the soil and enabling it to 
 absorb greater quantities of carbonic acid. It thus 
 becomes disintegrated, and the potash is rendered 
 soluble. Again, the potash may be incorporated with 
 the manure, and thus be caused to pass through a 
 process of circulation similar to that of the phospho- 
 ric acid. Straw also contains much potash, which 
 is returned to the soil in the manure. The soil may 
 also bs supplied with potash by moans of unleached 
 ashes, and by the cultivation of tap-rooted plants, to 
 be plowed h.\, in a green state — Ijccauso the salts of 
 potash, being highly soluble, are readily carried into 
 tho subsoil by rain water, and may be advantageous- 
 ly restored to the surface by means of tap-rooted 
 plants, grown and plowed in green. 

Chlorioe of Sodium.— Common Salt. The expe- 
 rience of almost every farmer will now confirm the 
 benefit derived from the mixture of salt with tho food 
 of cattle. It appears to be the natural and universal 
 stimulus tei the digestive organs of animated beings. 
 In this place, however, its medicinal power alone% 
 the subject of consideration. It is a purgative second 
 to the epsom salts. 

Tlie necessity of increasing the fertility of our soil

Mr. Editor:— In the able addre.33 delivered at the 
 State Agricultural Exhibition, we have a striking 
 picture of the ruinous effects of exhausting tillage, a* 
 exemplified in some of the finest portions of our coun- 
 try. Nothing can present a louder call on the atten- 
 tion of the pah-iot, or appeal more directly to the 
 pride and interest of the agriculturist. A general 
 survey of our oldest States in regard to their present 
 productiveness would doubtless result in the conclu- 
 sion that wherever the land has been under cultiva- 
 tion for half a century or more, its fertility is much 
 diminished. Who has not seen fields which will 
 hardly yield ten bushels of wheat to the acre, bat 
 which when newly cleared, produced forty bushels'? 
 The fact is, that from the first settlement of the coun- 
 try, the spendthrift process of cultivation, which takes 
 all from the soil and returns nothing, has been adopt- 
 ed; and the quality of the land unrler tillage in the 
 Atlantic States has consequently been impaired to an 
 extent, which it is painful to think of. In many 
 parts of the country the price of lands has been great- 
 ly depressed by this cause, whilst in others, the same 
 result ha« only been prevented by improvement,s, 
 public or private, which have communicated an ex- 
 traneous value. 

Whether under any circumstances, it is right to 
 take successive crops from the soil without restoring 
 any thing to it, may be left to tho casuists to consider; 
 but stern necessity will teach tho Pennsylvaniao, 
 that such a course of tillage can no longer be pur- 
 sued. The numerous canals and railroads hav« 
 opened the fertile regions of the great A7est to our 
 Atlantic markets, and at the same time have opened 
 to us such a prospect of competition, as makes it evi- 
 dent that nothing but the most skilful cultivation, 
 will enable us to profit by our position. We have 
 the advantage of proximity to tin' market and a small 
 freight ; but this is counteracted by the higher price 
 of our land and its inferior fertility. Our next west- 
 ern neighbor and young sister, Ohio, produces seve- 
 ral millions of bushels more wheat than we do every 
 year, and twice thi> quantity of Indian corn. Indi- 
 ana, Michigan and lUiuois, and Kentucky and Ten- 
 nessee, are ijnmense producers of breadstuffs; awl 
 they all can, and all do forward their produce to the 
 seaboard, east or south. The effect, is to reduce the 
 prices. Now— our farmers, if they can succeed in 
 doubling their crops, may do as m'oII, or better than 
 they have heretofore done by raising half the quanti- 
 ty and selling it for d.Hible the price. It is believed, 
 that Uiey may accomplish this result, by an improved 
 system of culture. 

It is fortunate, that the effect of the cultivation, 
 upon which we have animadverted, though perni- 
 cious, was superficial. The injury done, is, in general, 
 by impoverishing the soil to the depth of six or eight 
 ' inches : below which, in most cases, the earth wil
