of manures than has heretofore been };iven to the sub- 
 ject. Combined 'nith proper depth of plowing, and 
 a suitable application of fertiliKing constituents to the 
 crops according to their nature, it is confidently be- 
 licvel, that the care and slcill of the farmer thus em- 
 ployed, ^Tould be immediately rewardeil by the great- 
 est yield, at the smallest cost: wbich nuist ever be 
 the aim of the highest cultivation. 
 ■ Should it be thought desirable to pursue the sub- 
 ject, it may hereafter be inquired what is the best 
 plan for economizing the manures which may be 
 made upon the farm — with reference to quantity, 
 quality and expense. A. L. II.

The genus was established by Tourneforte ; it now 
 contains about sixty species, six of which are natives 
 of the United States, and two or three foreign ones 
 have been introduced. The name is derived from the 
 Greek LHhos, a stone, and sperma, a seed, from the 
 atony hard appearance of the seeds. 

The one under consideration is a native of Europe, 
 but is extensively naturalised, and in this county it 
 is a very serious nuisance. It Ijclongs to the 5tli 
 class Pentandria, and 1st order Monogynia, in the 
 Artificial system of Linn;eus, — to order Ileliotropea^ 
 of Endlicher, and Boragiuaeere in Gray's Botany of 
 tixe Northern United States. 

The stem grows from six to eighteen inches high, 
 usually much branched, and covered with bristle-like 
 haii's. The leaves are from one to one and a half 
 inches long and from one-third to half an inch wide, 
 the widest part above the middle tapering gradually 
 to the stem, both si les covered with hairs. The flow- 
 ers are small, of a funnel form, in the axles of the 
 leaves generally near the top of the stem, yellowish, 
 or white. The seeds are four naked, rough, long nut- 
 let 1, at first milk white but brownish when mature. 

This plant often almost covers the wheat fields in 
 May, and seems to be peculiarly desti'uctive to wheat, 
 and when it once gets into the ground it is quite diffi- 
 cult to exterminate. It is never very bad, if it does 
 not get a start in the fall, but early sowed wheat of- 
 ten suffers seriously. 

Once ploughing, and that quite late, has been tried 
 with success. But rotation of crops and constant cul- 
 ture will bring the seeds near the surface when they 
 quickly germinate, and thus, in a few years, the seed 

may be exhausted, provided the plant is kept from 
 producing a fresh supply. In harvesting the wheat, 
 it should be cut above the top of this weed, if not, it j then the last hope is in legislative aid. 

Birds and Insects. 

Mr. Editob: — In a former number of your .Jour- 
 nal, I observed a communication, calling the atten- 
 tion of readers to the importance of formers prevent- 
 ing, as far as possible, the wanton destruction of in- 
 sectivorous birds. At the time the article appeared, 
 I was deeply impressed with the importance of the 
 subject, and subsequent reflection has strengthened 
 my impressions. 

Why birds should be made the sulyect of such an 
 extermiuating warfare as is now waged against them, 
 and why formers will permit this work of destruction 
 to be carried on, upon their farms, is to me a matter 
 of great astonishment. Surely, no farmer, who values 
 sound fruits, fine vegetables, or even good timber will 
 permitthcse inroads of gunners upon his premises. 

I am very well aware that many formers consider 
 the, destruction of birds a small evil, while others, al- 
 though convinced of the importance of the matter, 
 good naturedly permit it, rather than drive from their 
 farms the lazy fellows who invade it for this purpose. 

To those who consider the evil one of small magni- 
 tude, I would say, that the reading of the able arti- 
 cles on Entomology which have recently appeared 
 in your -Journal, ought to satisfy them that nosbus 
 insects are alarmingly on the increase, and that un- 
 less a cheek be put upon the destruction of birds, we 
 shall soon be overrun by insects to such an extent as 
 will set all our efforts to get rid of them at defiance. 
 Already we have complaints from every quarter. — 
 The ravages of the corcullo are ssen every where, 
 and experiments are making in evejfy direction for 
 the purpose of ascertaining some method by which to 
 get rid of them. Twenty years ago, it was not known 
 as a dangerous enemy to fruit growers, and even 
 now, comparatively few persons know what insect it 
 is that stings their choice fruit and causes it prema- 
 turely to decay and fall to the ground. More atten- 
 tion to this spbject is imperatively demanded by the 
 exigencies of the case. 

To the farmer who is too good natnred to drive 
 from his premises the lazy fellows who prowl around 
 them, destro3'ing the little birds, breaking down the 
 fencing, and very frequently carrying away every 
 thing they can lay hold of, I would saj', cease to be 
 good natured in this particular. By permitting such 
 work to go on, you are inflicting a serious evil upon 
 yourselves and upon the community. You are en- 
 couraging idleness and wanton cruelty. Let public 
 warning notices be given. This can be done at -a 
 comparatively trifling cost, where eight or ten farm- 
 ers club together, and if tliis will not prove effectual. 

We must 

will be necessary to destroy the straw, for if the j have a law to protect the birds, or wo shall shortly 
 seeds are carried into the barn yard, there is but a I 
 poor prospect of getting rid of the plant on the farm.
