American Seedling Pears. 

Mr. Editor:— Of coun^e you and I arc unacquaint- 
 ed, except throush the columns of the IlortkuUurisf, 
 where I frequently see yfiur name. I observe that 
 ^ou pay considerable attention to pears and especial- 
 ly American seedling pears. For some time I con- 
 ducted an Ohio nursery, but I am now located on a 
 large tract of thin chcsnut land, or rather land with 
 s great mixture of timlier including several varieties 
 of oak, hickory, pr.plar, dogwood, &c. The laud is 
 broken into ridges which rise over two hundred feet 
 ftbore the valley of the Walhoundiiig, in which is the 
 canal of that name. On the summits of these ridges 
 fruits seldom fail, and my young orchard had a mo- 
 derate crop this year, one of gieat failure in the west. 
 I have been thus full in order to show you that so 
 fer as land is concerned, I am admirably situated for 
 planting largo orchards, and my old profession of 
 nurseryman enables me to hope I am nut wholly in- 
 e-ompetont to the task. Situated as we are on the 
 canal which connects with all the railroads of the 
 State, I am much in hopes the planting may be pro- 
 fitable, and I am certaiu it affords me iucfetimablc de- 
 light. 

Being so favorably situated, with so much cheap 
 laud, Mr. Ilumeriehhouse. of Coshocton, a western 
 smateur planter, the other day asked me tfl accept ! ^yjjije 
 •)f him a numb::r of trees to set out on trial, for which 
 he had not room. This has suggested to me that 
 many persons about cities and town may be similarly 
 sitnated and that they plight take pleasure in origi- 
 nating seedling pears and presenting the most pro- 
 mising to a person who, like myself, had plenty of 
 room and who would take the trouble to mark them 
 and inform them of the result. Or to furnish small 
 packages of seeds from the choicest varieties, but es- 
 pecially from the very best American seedlings, on 
 condition that I should grow the seeds in each pack- 
 age sepaxatelj', marked with the name of the contri- 
 butor, and if any one or more of them should prove 
 fine, call it after him or members of his family. 

When it is recollected the time and culture neces- 
 sary to produce a bearing state, it seems to me I offer 
 to make the honor of originating fine fruits to city 
 amateurs very cheap. 1 have as yet only about thirty 
 acres in orchard, but I have room for more than fivt' 

// undrcd acres of the host fruit ridges I have seen be- 
 tween the great lakes and the Mississippi, and I in- 
 tend to plant three hundred acres as soon as nir 
 means will permit, and I expect after this year to sJ 
 about thirty acres per annum. 

The seedling pear trees which I shall continue to^ 
 grow for myself, and which I may receive from oth- 
 ers, 1 shall set out when of proper size without bull- 
 ing and leave all that promise well to grow and bear 
 until fully proved: budding them just as fiist as they 
 demonstrate themselves unv.-orthy. Those seedlin"T= 
 which give only moderate promise, I shall bud at 
 high standard height and leave a single limb to prow 
 the seedling. 

Bi-lieving it possible that you or some of your hor- 
 ticultural friends might take interest in this matter 
 and send me small trees or seeds, I have addressed 
 you this note. The trees should be only one year".< 
 growth, and of these only the highly promising. 1 
 wish pears only, as I have very numerous varictie.' 
 of peaches and apples bearing, from which I am col- 
 lecting and planting seeds. I have many pears ais.i 
 from seeds. 

I will state to you a few <jf my speculations and 
 practices, forgetting perhaps, the many opportunities 
 you have of many interesting conversations, while I , 
 am so circumstanced that on the subject of fruit cul 
 tivation my converse is chiefly with trees as thev 
 grow in the nursery, or as tiiey are to be removed 
 from the primeval forest — giants to be made to give 
 way to the pigmies I have reared. A great whirl 
 wind, however, twenty-three years ago, did most of 
 the giant work for me, and I have to contend chicay 
 with a dense young growth which sprung up after 
 the storm, which left not a tree in the main lino of 
 its course. It threw the tops from either side inward, 
 and twisted numerous hickories of considerable size, 
 say from twelve to twenty inches, as a man would a 
 Xow for the practices and speculations. 
 1. I decidedly prefer to grow all the hardier varie- 
 ties of the apple, pear aud peach on their own roots. 
 I believe the trees are longer-lived and the fruit more 
 perfect, and beside, in the event of any injury a sprout 
 even from the root may rapidly and conveniently re- 
 place the tree. For a congenial soil, no root is so 
 perfect for any tree as its own. I am not prepared 
 to say trees sometimes may not flourish bettor where 
 the soil or climate are very uncongenial, on a stock 
 better suited to such climate or soil ; hut, in ray opin- 
 ion, the cases are very few, and rarely if at all with 
 the attention of the market orchardist. Ajiplcs, root 
 grafted so as the graft may take root, do perfectly 
 well, or raised fiom layers do equally well. Pears 
 would do equally well, but the graft in seven oasea 
 out of ten rots, and very frequently the stock dies. — 
 To meet this difficulty, I bud the stock and then lay- 
 er the bud when about a foot long, the first summer. 
 If the stock is strong. I insert several buds and whou
