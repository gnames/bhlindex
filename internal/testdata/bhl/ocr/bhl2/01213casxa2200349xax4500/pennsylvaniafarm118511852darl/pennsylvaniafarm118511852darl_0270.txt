HORTICULTURAL. 

[December, 

lU'- Imds aro about foot long bring tho whole under 
 ;;:imnd bj' cuttinj: the stork about two-thirds off and 
 >i:a.ving it off to the root so as to bend over easily and 
 vTithout breaking. But when I liavc once attained 
 a variety on its roots, I can multiply it both by lay- 
 era and by divisions of the roots. I must confess, 
 however, they are sometimes tardy ingrowing. The 
 most successful mode I have tried, is to shave down 
 tii3 stalk about six inches above the ground so as to 
 bend handsomely, then at a point which will allow 
 the layer to go the proper depth into the ground, cut 
 it halfoff as if tongueing it and shave tho layer side 
 of the upper divi.sion so as it will beud snugly, and 
 then insert it in the ground in an upright position — 
 .sometimes first tying a leather string right in the up- 
 per part of the open split, so as to check and finally 
 cut off tho circulation between the layer and root, and 
 tSiereby force it to form its own roots. '^Vith peaches 
 and apples this is almost certain to be successful the 
 first year, but pears are often refractory. 

2. Next (for my sheet is almost full) I have ob- 
 served that chance trees grow finely when they spring 
 lip in places where there is considerable decaying 
 brush bones, &o. Following tliis idea up I have tried 
 throwing brush around young trees so thick as to 
 keep the weeds and grass dowu — in other words, to 
 mulch with brush with the leaves on. It answers 
 well. Pursuing the same idea still further, I am 
 having holes dug four feet in diameter right through 
 a portion of the brushwood or fallen ti)n))er, of which 
 I spoke, in which I intend planting peaches, apples 
 and pears, and when the leaves are fully developed 
 in June, I shall cut the brush down, trim it and pile 
 around tho trees which •n'ill give each tree quite a 
 handsome quantity, so as to keep the roots moist and 
 cool for a considerable distance, and the decay of tho 
 h/avos and brush, I hope, will act as a manure and 
 keep the ground so loose as to render plowing and hoe- 
 ing unnecessary. I will try only a few acres this 
 year. Will it do ? May it not prevent blight and 
 make trees longer lived, from tlie absence of wounds 
 f'.'ora plowing and digging. Straw and manure, lime 
 and ashes can be superadded. Nature manures .alto- 
 gether on top. Yours, E. Nichols.

[The above communication, not originally intend- 
 ed by the writer fer publication, was handed to us 
 by a friend to whom it was addressed. AVe most 
 cheerfully give it a place, and at the .same time, ask 
 for it tlie attention of thsse who feel an interest in the 
 propagation of seedling fruits. The offer on the part 
 of Mr. Nichols, is certainly a liberal one, and if em- 
 braced to any extent, might result most advantage- 
 ously to the fruit growing interest of the country at 
 large. — Ed.] 

Renovating Outcasts. 

Mr. Editor: — In a cotemporary work is a Ion:; 
 article with extended remarks bj' the editor recom- 
 mending confidently a method of " renov.iting out- 
 casts,"* closely followed in the following experiment 
 which — though unsuccessful — is at your disposal. 

In the autumn of , forty-nine trenches, thre<> 

feet wide and two feet deep, were dug around two 
 pear trees, — butter pear of your county (Doyenni 
 blanc). The earth, except a few inches of the top 
 was carted away. All roots encountered smoothly 
 cut off. Tho trenches were filled vrith this top earth 
 and swamp muck which had been exposed to frost 
 and sun ; carefully mixed with charcoal and ashos 
 one-tenth, potash, sulphate and oxide of iron, and pul- 
 verized ))oncs of each about one pound.J The follow- 
 ing spring the trees were severely headed in, at the 
 same time inserting, in some branches, grafts of thi.v 
 Bartlett. These scions as well as the original stock 
 grew vigorously but the pears produced, on the lat- 
 ter, were cracked and worthless. Looking with in- 
 terest for a crop last autumn you may judge of my 
 disappointment to find them worthless as before. — 
 But what is strange yet not new, the Bartlett pcar» 
 grown on the engrafted limbs were perfect. Now 
 until it is demonstrated by chemical analysis, that; 
 Doyenn6s contain elementary constituents which Bart- 
 lett's do not, we must be allowed to dissent from th» 
 entire chemical theory, as well as this system of re- 
 novation. J. K. EsnLEMAX.

Germinatiou of Clover Seed. 

Mr. Editor : Conceiving that it might be of prac- 
 tical benefit to perhaps a few of the readers of the- 
 Farm Journal, I will state a plan of securing the- 
 germination (or as some term it) the taking of Clo- 
 ver Seed. It is a well known fact that with old land* 
 which have undergone a continued cour.se of cultiva- 
 tion for a number of years, grass seed, especially- clo- 
 ver, is not apt to take well. To remedy this, I con- 
 cluded in the spripg of 1850, to try a plan which I 
 had heard several times recommended as being of 
 great utility in securing the germination of Clover. 
 It is simply this. Take a very light one-horse iron- 
 toothed harrow with the teeth protruding about .> 
 inches below the under side of the frame or bars ; let 
 this follow directly after the sower. The frame should 
 be made as light as possible with the teeth a little 
 closer than the ordinary large harrow. It should be 
 hinged in order to avoid scraping or rubbing out th» 
 wheat on the ridges and also to lap in the furrows. — 
 There need be no fear of injuring the wheat but on 
 the contrary it would be of benefit to it. I have pur- 
 sued the above plan and it has overreached my most 
 sanguine expectation. Charles Mtkrs.
