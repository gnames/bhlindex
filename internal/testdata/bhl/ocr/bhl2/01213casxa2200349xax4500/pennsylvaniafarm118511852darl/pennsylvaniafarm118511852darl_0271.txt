The stated meeting of this Society was held in the 
 Chinese Saloon, Philadelphia, on Tuesday evening, 
 November l^, 1851. The President in the ohair. — 
 This being the show night for Chryaanthemums, there 
 ■were eight collections presented ; in which were ma- 
 ny of the choicest kinds : the contributors were 
 Robert Buist, James Bisset, gardener to Jas. Dun- 
 das; (jeo. North, Maurice Finn, .John Lambert's gar- 
 dener; Alexander Parker aud Jno. Ellis, gardener 
 to Caleb Cope. The collection by the latter consisted 
 of those new and beautiful varieties called the Lili- 
 jrutiati which has but recently been imported, and 
 for the first time shown ; and are decidedly the pret- 
 tiest of this tribe of plants. A collection of plants 
 in pot.s by Maurice Finn, gardener to .Jno. Lambert 
 was interesting. The President's gardener exhibited 
 another of those exquisitely beautiful baskets of cut 
 flowers which has graced the tables on former occa- 
 sions, containing the choicest llowers of his houses. 
 of which many were from air plants : but as hereto- 
 fore the crowning flower was the Vicloria rcgia, the 
 24th production of the plant, although of smaller 
 proportions than those borne by the plant when in 
 lull vigour, still it was a perfect gem, and much ad- 
 mired. Among the fruits were three tempting bunch- 
 es of Black ILamburg Grapes from IL VV. S. Cleve- 
 land, Burlington, and beautiful specimens of Pears, 
 some luscious in taste, which came from H. W. S. 
 Cleveland, Isaac B. Baxter, N. W. Roe of Woodbury, 
 A. M. Eastwick, J. P. Cushing, Mass., the Dix ; and 
 a specimen of the pound Pear which weighed -'1 
 ounces, from the late State Fair at llarrisburg. Se- 
 veral dishes of apples were also shown, and from 
 David Miller, -Jr., Carlisle, the Fallon walder, I^itts- 
 burg pippin, Bettcr-than-good and Jlerman'.s favorite; 
 from Jas. ]L Watts, of Rochester, the Northern Spy ; 
 Chas. Lee, Pcnn Yan, N. Y., the Wagener ; Mathew 
 Makie, the Clyde beauty. Of Vegetables, Anthony 
 Fulton, Jr., exhibited extensive tables ; and Maurice 
 Finn, gardener to John Lambert, John Gallagher, 
 gardener to Miss Gratz, and Thos. Meehan, ganiener 
 to A. M. Eastwick, verj' creditable displays, indeed.

 the seeds of this Victoria) which was read, in which

 tivation of the Victoria. He also remarked that he 
 had sent seeds of the plant to Calcutta and the West 
 Indies, and that plants had grown in (he open water*

Mr. Editor: — As some of your readers may have 
 chickens suffering with a disease .similar to that which 
 I am about to describe, tlie moans by which I suc- 
 ceeded in relieving ihine, may not prove uninterest- 
 ing to them. 

A few weeks since a favorite hen of six months old, 
 began to droop, and soon after I observed her gas}i- 
 iug in such a manner as led me to believe that she 
 was troubled with the fasciolae, the small parasite 
 worm, which sometimes adheres to the inner mem- 
 brane of young chickens' windpipe. I'nder this im- 
 pression I administered turpentine, !>ut with no other 
 perceptible effect, than to increase the hen's illness. 
 A slender wire, and subsequently a small feather di- 
 vested of its web, except at the farther ou J, were used
