to dislodge the -vvorms, but without success. A mix- 
 ture of lilack pepper and fresh butter was nest given 
 her, and this, like the other two remedies, proved in- 
 ctual. At this time the condition of the hen was 
 truly pitiable. The disease had so weakened her, 
 that she could scarcelj walk, and I began to think 
 her a " gone case." A white foam completely cover- 
 ed both her eyes, so that it was impossible for her to 
 see. She refused food and drink entirely and gave 
 every indication of being upon her last legs. Unwil- 
 ling to lose her without another efibrt, I procured 
 two calomel pills containing one grain each, and gave 
 them to her. It was with but faint hopes of seeing 
 her alive the nest morning that I placed her in a 
 comfortable coop. Much to my surprise, in the morn- 
 ing, when I opened the coop, there stood my hen, her 
 eyes perfectly clean of foam, and the gasping nearly 
 gone. I offered some food, which she devoured with 
 much apparent relish. She also drank water freely 
 and from that day she has continued improving. — 
 Whether the cure is to be attributed to the calomel 
 or to some other of the other remedies, I will not pre- 
 tend to say, leaving that point to b« decided by those 
 tetter versed in the art of chicken-doctoring. 

These are the facts, and I submit them for what 
 they arc worth. S.

[The disease referred to by our correspondent is 
 evidently the roup, an affection of the head, which 
 generally proves fatal, or permanently weakens the 
 fowl attacked vrih it. Calomel is not a new remedy, 
 it being recommended by English fowl breeders. It 
 is asserted by some that the roiq> is contagious, and 
 thatthe bestmeausof preventingits spreadingthrough 
 the entire flock, is to chop off the heads of those first 
 affected. There may bo truth in this, although we 
 cannot sul>scribe to it in full. Fowls are rarely at- 
 tacked with it until they are six months old, at which 
 tmie, they are not in full plumage. Exposure to the 
 chilling rains and cold winds of autumn and winter, 
 during which seasons it most generally prevails, acts 
 powerfully upon their scantily protected bodies, and 
 the result is cold, which settles in the head and throat, 
 causingjthe discharge from the nostrils and frequently 
 the eyes — great difficulty in respiration, and such in- 
 flammation of the throat as makes swallowing pain- 
 ful. We have never known a case of roup, where 
 the fowls have not suffered from exposure, although 
 it is proper to say that our opportunities for observa- 
 tion have not been very extensive. Our friend Tag- 
 gart, of Northumberland, or some other of our 
 correspondents will do us a favor by furnishing more 
 satisfactory information upon this subject. — Ed.] 

It is said that there is a plant, growing in the hot 
 springs in Iceland, which not only flowers, but bears 
 seeds, in water hot enough to boil an egg. 

We don't believe it. 

The Banquet. 

[cOXCLrOED.] 

We siilijoin a few of the volunteer toasts, with a 
 brief synopsis of the remarks made by the gentlemen 
 (^specially complimented. 

Mr. Williamson, of Huntingdon, proposed the 
 health of the lion. Frederick Watts, President of the 
 Pennsylvania State Agricultural Society. 

To which Judge Watts responded. He said that 
 when elected President of the Society he was absent 
 on professional duties, which prevented his attending 
 the farmer's convention last January, when the So- 
 ciety v\-!ts organize L He spoke of the tinijiistakable 
 evidence ol Providence having, in a peculi;ir n>annor,. 
 favored the efforts of^the society so far, and of his en- 
 tire confidence in its approving smiles and abiding 
 protection. His remarks were listened to with pro- 
 found attention, and inspired all present with ths 
 same cfmfidcnce, in a long and useful career of use- 
 fulness, in the good work, so well begun, and carried 
 on, since the society had been instituted. 

Col. Frazer, of Lancaster, made a few pertinent re- 
 marks on the patriotism and friendship that so hmg 
 had united, in sentiment, the Old Dominion and 
 Pennsylvania, and gave — 

Hon. Andrew StevensoD, of Virginia: — The orator 
 of the day. 

Mr. Stevenson having previously retired, Benjamii* 
 B. Hush, Esq., of Philadelphia, rose and begged tlir- 
 company not to think him presumptuous in under- 
 taking to speak the thanks of Mr. Stevenson ; who, 
 were he present, could so much better discharge the 
 duty himself. But inasmuch as he had the honor 
 of acting under the distinguished st.'itesman of Vir- 
 ginia, while representing the Unite«l States at the- 
 Court of St. James, he was'constrained to improve- 
 the moment by thanking the company for the honor 
 they had done his friend in drinking his health. 

The President then gave — The pioneer of the 
 Pennsylvania State Agricultural Society. And af- 
 terwards enjoined, he alluded to Mr. Gowen. 

Mr. 0. being called upon said, that when the toast 
 was proposed, he did not think it referred to ^im. — 
 He felt somewhat embarrassed, if not overwhelmed, 
 bv the flattering position in which it placed him. — 
 The Philadelphia Society for promoting agriculture 
 of which he was for years a zealous member, and 
 now its President, was the pioneer of the Pennsylva- 
 nia, and all other agricultural societies in the United 
 States. Ho stated that as far back as some fifty or 
 sixty years, a committee of the Philadelphia Society, 
 consisting of Judge Peters, George Clymcr, Timothy 
 Pickering and John B. Bordley, made report to that 
 society on the expediency of a State institution, which 
 report suggested the principles and provisions embo- 
 died in every State agricultural society's constitution 
 ho had road ; therefore, he said, these patriotic wor- 
 thies, or the Philadelphia society, was the pioneer in
