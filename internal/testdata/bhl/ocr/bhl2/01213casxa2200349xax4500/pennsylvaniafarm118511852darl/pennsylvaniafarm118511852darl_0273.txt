this connexion. But, Mr. G. said, ho could not but 
 -claim some credit, as an individual, in bringing about 
 the nevei'-to-be-forgottcn farmor's convention at Ilar- 
 risburg, which happily resolved itself into the Pcnn- 
 «ylv.ania State Agricultural Society. lie then made 
 some remarks as to tlie gratification it atForded him 
 <m witnessing such a noble assemblage of farmers as 
 tnot in convention at Ilarrisburg, in January last, 
 and at the agricultural exhibition just closed. He 
 had a few }"ears back participated in several of the 
 New York Agricultural Exhiljitious, and ever im- 
 pressed with a high sense of the wealth, spirit and 
 intelHgcnce of the agriculturists of New York — espe- 
 cially of Western New York — but not even they, nor 
 any body of farmers he had ever seen elsewhere, 
 could suqiass in those attributes collectivelj', the 
 farmers of Pennsylvania. These had met in conven- 
 tion — had met at their firet State Eshiljition — luid 
 conjointly put th«ir " hand to the plow," and wlio 
 could believe that such men would ever '■ look back?" 
 He congratulated the society on the success of the 
 <txhibition thoy had just made, and the prospect it 
 shadowed forth, for farming in Pennsylvania in the 
 fature. Ifis remarks were applauded. 

Mr. Gowen again rose to say that when last up he 
 had intended to propose tlie health of a gentleman 
 from Lancaster on his right, and begged leave to re- 
 pair the omission. Lancaster, he said, was the place 
 tie had ever contemplated, while meditating a State 
 Society, for holding its first exhibition, but Ilarris- 
 burg had nobly carried off that honor, lie then gave 
 The health of Col. Reah Frazer, of Lancaster. 
 To which Col. F. responded in his usual happy 
 style. 

The health of Gen. Cameron was proposed to wliich 
 tiiat gentleman responded. 

A. S. Roberts, Esq., of Philadelphia, proposed the 
 health of tlie Board of Canal Coraniissiotiers. 

CoL Painter, President of the Board, returned 
 thanks for himself and colleagues, lie took occasion 
 to say, that he was sorry to find that complaints had 
 been made of the want of facilities on tlie State road 
 for the forwarding of passengers and stock to the ex- 
 hibition, which if well founded, he greatly regretted. 
 That if suitable means had not been provided, the 
 Board of Canal Commissioners was not responsible 
 for the omission, having control only of the motive 
 power on the road, which had been ordered, in due 
 time, to bo ready to any extent retjuired. If the in- 
 etructions of the Board had not been fully complied 
 with, in that particular, it would be matter of deep 
 concern to himself and coUeaguos. He said he was 
 a farmer, and whether as a public functionary or pri- 
 vate individual, he would be found ever ready to pro- 
 mote, as far as in his power, the objects of the Socie- 
 ty. He concluded by saying, that the progress mak- 
 ing in the public works, would soon overcome the 
 barrier that separates western from eastern Pennsyl- 

vania, which, when fully accomplished, would enable 
 the farmers of both sections of the State to co-oporat« 
 more efficiently in promoting the cause of agi-icul- 
 ture.

Make Uome Beautiful. 

BY MRS. L. G. ABELL. 

Those who live in cities and compact villages can 
 do little to make a residence attractive, otherwise 
 than a fine display of architecture, but those who 
 live in the country can make the lowliest dwelling a 
 place of enchantment and beauty. 

The neat white cottage or even log cabin with its 
 green vines hanging about the eaves, and trained 
 around the windows, with its simple beds of flowers 
 adorning the walks, and filling the air with fragrance 
 is a refreshing sight even to the eye of the traveller, 
 to whose mind is presented an idea of happiness and 
 beauty sweetly blended together. 

The landscape scenery of our country might be 
 greatly improved if the various owners of each farm 
 made his o-\vn place and home attractive with neat 
 fences and ornamental trees, walks and flowers. It 
 would not only enhance the value of individual pos- 
 sessions, and increase the actual worth and price of 
 a farm, but as " a thitiff of beauty, is a joy forever!'' 
 Who can estimate the comfort and delight of a taste- 
 ful home! Every tree, and shrub, and flower, has a 
 blessing for the heart which soothes and refreshes 
 the weariest hours. 

There is no mind so dull and insensible, but will 
 secretly admire the cultivated grounds, and pleasant 
 domains of a man of taste, and even wish his means 
 were sufBcieutly ample to own such a home! Does 
 not every farmer in our land possess means amply 
 sufficient to make his own home beautiful and valua- 
 ble and something to be desired? There are many 
 spare hours, and if applied to laying out a neat yard, 
 setting out trees which shall answer the treble pur- 
 pose of fruit, shade and ornament, bordering a walk, 
 and making and enriching a bed for flowers, he is 
 not idling or wasting his time, but doing that which 
 shall Ije to his own heart and that of his wife and 
 children a continual feast of is;^oyment while he lives, 
 and adds dollars and cents to its real value, besides 
 being a public blessing and improvement. Who likes 
 to travel through regions that are merely inhabited, 
 without being enlivened with one spot of beauty or 
 of taste to cheer the lonely and weary heart. The 
 English tourist pictures to our minds the green 
 hedges and smooth verdant lawns, and vine clad cot- 
 tages, and all the common landscape scenery as 
 charming to the eye as a cultivated garden. Why 
 may not American farmers have some reference to 
 beauty as well as use ? If all should do so, how soon 
 would the scene be changed, and the neglected spot 
 " bud and blossom as the rose."
