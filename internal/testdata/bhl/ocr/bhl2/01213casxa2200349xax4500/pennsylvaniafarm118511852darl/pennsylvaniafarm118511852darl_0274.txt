Late in tho fall any tree or shrub can be trans- 
 plaiitoil, as long as tho ground remains unfi-ozen. — 
 The suckers that come up from the roots, will make 
 nice trees, and flowering shrubs when set out well in 
 the fall, will put out leaves in the spring, and soon 
 gain an independence of growth that will be quite sur- 
 prising. From these, one can cover up unsightly 
 places, and provide themselves as much fruit and 
 shade and ornament as they choose with little trou- 
 ble and time. Let nothing bo lost of this kind, but 
 give it a place, and it will more than repay all your 
 trouble. The females of a family can aid in these 
 matters, and their taste will often bo found a valua- 
 ble regulator and safe guide — they love tho flowers, 
 neatness and order, and some homes would possess 
 little of charm or of beauty were it not for their skill 
 and effort. 

The contrast we hare all seen. Tho great house, 
 large farms, rough fence, weedy yard, and treeless 
 premises, and not even a rose-bush under the window 
 or by the door — or what is still worse, the old neg- 
 lected abode, loaning fences, promiscuous growth of 
 2,11 sorts of things that choose to grow, making for 
 all tho inmates a cheerless, desolate home, witliout 
 external beauty, or any thing to cheer the heart 
 within.

tongworth's Sparkling Catawba. 

Our esteemed friend Dr. Brinckle has laid us un- 
 der obligaticms for a bottle of this truly delicious 
 wine. DiKtrusting our own judgment in the matter, 
 we called in a few friends who had a reputation that 
 way, to assist us m pronouncing upon its merits. — 
 The first sip, however, satisfied us that our precau- 
 tions were unnecessary, for although not a habitual 
 wine drinker, we had no hesitation in pronouncing 
 it decidedly the finest champagne wo had ever tasted. 
 Our friends agreed with us unanimously, and we con- 
 gratulated Sir. Longworth upon tho happy success 
 which has attended his efforts to introduce its manu- 
 facture into tho L'^nitcd States, and that too, from our 
 native grape. In a recent article in the Western Hor- 
 ticitUural Review, Mr. Longworth saya : 

" We are soon destined, not only to supply the 
 United States with wine, but to export it largely. — 
 Most persons say, that they would not be willing to 
 run over their earthly couree. I would willingly do 
 it again, even if I had but one change. The fore- 
 thought, earlier in life, to commence the raising of 
 seedling grapes, from our best native varieties, and 
 ft mixture between them and the best foreign. I, 
 this season raised a few thousand of the former cha- 
 racter, and of one superior variety, have 800 plants 
 of extra growth, and shall be disappointed if i have 
 not grapes of black, white and red color among them, 
 equal in the size of the grape and the bunch, to the 
 Black Hamburg, and its rival in quality. Two or 
 three years will test the question. I add this to in- 
 duce otliers to follow the example." 

The following paragraph, which we copy from one 

of our exchanges, shows to what extent wine growing- 
 is already carried on by JMr. Longworth and others 
 in the vicinity of Cincinnati : 

"In Cincinnati and neighborhood not loss than one 
 thousand acres of land are devoted to the culture of 
 the grape for making wine. A writer in the news- 
 papers says that on a visit to Mr. Limgworth he saw 
 75,000 bottles of sparkling Catawba, and almut 40,000 
 gallons of wine in casks, varying from 40 to 'lO gal- 
 lons in each. This cellar is 120 feet long, 40 feet 
 wide, and 40 feet deep; and it is th(^ intention of the 
 owner to increase it to double this size during tlie 
 coming spring. Besides Mr. Longworth, tlu^re are 
 many other persons in Cincinnati, and the neighbor- 
 hood, engaged in the cultivation of the grape." 

Seedling vs. Budded Peaches. 

Beasons ishy budded peaches are tenderer than seed- 
 lings. 

Ist. About nine out of ten of our finest budded 
 sorts are foreigners, many of which are not well 
 adapited to our soil and climate, whereas our seed- 
 lings arc mostly natives. 

2nd. Our fine sorts, gencrall}', say nine-tenths of 
 them have small flowers. About the same proportion 
 of the seedlings have large flowers.which protect them 
 very much against late frosts. 

3d. The wood of almost every first rate sort of 
 peaches, as well as apples, pears, pilums. cherries 
 and grapes, is more plethoric and consequently more 
 tender than ordinary seedlings. This is not caused 
 by budding, but a common or natural defect in a 
 great majority of our very finest fruits. The sama 
 rule will hold good when applied to animals, vegeta- 
 bles, flowers, or grasses and grains. 

4th. A large majority of our finest sorts of peaohe5, 
 whether seedling or grafted, have large fruit buds, 
 much more prominent than ordinary seedlings, which 
 render thi^m moie liable to be killed by severe coW 
 weather than tho inferior sorts. 

5th. Bnddcd or grafted trees are generally better 
 cared for than ordinary seedlings, which has a ten- 
 dency to produce a forced growth, and conse(iuentJy 
 renders the wood more spongy and loss hardy. 

6th. The budded or grafted trees forms fruit bud» 
 when much younger than seeillings. All know that 
 the fruit on very young trees is much more easily 
 killed than on old ones. — Western Horticultural Rt- 
 view. 

[Last season it will be remembered that there wew 
 scarcely any peaches in Lancaster city or the im- 
 mediate vicinity, (the severe late frosts having dc^ 
 stroyed them) while at the distance of a few miles in 
 every direction, there was an abundance of them. — 
 This at first seemed strange, but a little reflection 
 solved the difiiculty. Nearly all of the peach troeg 
 in the city and vicinity are budded or foreigners, 
 whilst those a few miles from the city are, generally 
 speaking, seedlings. Of course there were excei)tions; 
 a few budded trees, being well filled with fruit; bnt 
 as a general thing, the budded crop was a failaie, 
 while the seedlings were laden with fruit. We could 
 not but regard it as a strong argument in favor of 
 the superior hardiness of tJie seedling or native var 
 rieties. — Ed.]
