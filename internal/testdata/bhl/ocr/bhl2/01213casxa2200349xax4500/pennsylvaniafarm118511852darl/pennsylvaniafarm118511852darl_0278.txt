Wcfiern Hoytu-uUiiral Review. — We have foi" some 
 time past been in receipt of this excellent monthly, 
 and always welcome it to our table with sincere plea- 
 sure. Its pages arc fdled with valuable contributions 
 from able pens and we are glad to learn that the un- 
 tiring eftbrts of its indefatigable editor. Dr. Warder, 
 meet with the encouragement they so richly deserve. 
 The Review is published monthly at Cincinnati, at 
 three dollars per annum, and is, we think, well worth 
 the m.oney. Should any of our friends desire a sigtrt 
 of it, the can be gratified by calling at our office. 

SI.'.xrRrxG Fruit Trees. — This is the season for 
 the amateur to look over his fruit trees — especially 
 tlioso which have failed to produce good crops for 
 want of nourishment in the soil. Carefullj- open a 
 trench at the very ends of the roots — throw out a 
 Uiird of the poorest of tlie soil, and replace it witb a 
 mixture of manure and ashes. I use a cart-load of 
 barn-yard manure — no matter if it is fresh — to a 
 bushel of asiies, and I find it never to fail in bringing 
 tip the tree. If I wait till spring before I apply this 
 • stimulus — I find it to do just half as much good as 
 if I put it on the soil in October and November. It 
 is quite surprising how old fruit trees can be brought 
 to by this simple dressing — barn-yard manure and 
 iwihes, applied in the fall of the jiia.T.—Doiciuni/'s 
 Ilo^iictdtiirisi. 

Hydropathic Encyclopedia. — No. •), of tlii-; han(?- 
 some work, published by Fowlers & Wolls, of New 
 York, is on our table. Its design is to present in a 
 condensed and pr.ictical form all the important facts 
 and principles in medicine and the collateral science* 
 pertaining to the water cure treatment. To those 
 who desire a familiarity with this .system, the work 
 will be valuable. The typography is beautiful, and 
 each number abounds with well executed illustrations-. 
 Eight numbers of one hundred pages each will com- 
 plete it. Price 25 cents a number. 

To F.\TTEN Poultry. — Shut them up in the dark 
 — give them a little light two or three times a day, 
 long enough to fill themselves with food, and thoa 
 shut them up quite dark, and keep them there ton or 
 twelve days at farthest.
