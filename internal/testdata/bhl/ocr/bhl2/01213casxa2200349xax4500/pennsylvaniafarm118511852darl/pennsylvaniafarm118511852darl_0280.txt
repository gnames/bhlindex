EDITORIAL. 

[December, 

Faimer, is, wo presume, still greater. Kemember ! 
 these are not the only Agricultural papers publishoil 
 in Oliio and New York. There are more than a doz- 
 I'.n nthei-s of excellent character, nearly all of which 
 are in a flourishing conditien. 

The Farm -Journal, is the only strictly Agricultu- 
 ral Periodical published in our State, and may we 
 not ask that Pennsylvania will extend to it, a sup- 
 port as liberal as that extended to the Ohio or Al- 
 bany Cultivator? IIow easily this might be accom- 
 plislicd. A few hours effort on the part of our jjres- 
 ent subscribers would do it, and with such a patron- 
 age, what a noble and useful work we could offer. — ■ 
 Friends of Agriculture is it not worth the effort? — 
 Is it not worth an hour or two's labor, to be able to 
 say, that Pennsylvania sustains her Agricultural 
 Journal as liberally as New York or Oliio, sustain 
 theirs ? And why should she not ? As a State she 
 ranks first in Agricultural and Mineral wealth — her 
 farmers arc acknowledged superior to those of other 
 States, while her population is second to New Y'ork 
 only. "With such r:;sour!es, such a character, and 
 such a population, wliy should we not have ten or 
 liftcen thousand subscribers ? Sh.all wo have them ? 
 Shall wo enter upon the year 1852 with tjje pleasing 
 consciousness that our sphere of usefulness is largely 
 increased — that our Journal is diffusing more widcl}', 
 its valualtle Agricultural truths, and that it is awaken- 
 ing the farmers of our good old Commonwealth to 
 the advantages which science oflers. 

Friends — those who have stood by us so faithfully, 
 we ask another efibrt. It will not cost nmch, and if 
 you succeed in doubling our present list, with what 
 more [ileasing thoughts would you desire to begin the 
 New Year, than that you have aided in building up 
 the agricultural reputaticn and interests of Pennsyl- 
 vania. January is the month in which subscriptions 
 to monthly periodicals are generally commenced, so 
 that now is the time for successful action. 

Notices of the Newsi'apeb Prkss. — AVc would bo 
 doing violence to our own feelings, as well as gross 
 injustice to our cotemporaries of the newspaper press 
 throughout tlie State, did we not acknowledge our 
 heavy indebtedness to them for tlie many kind no- 
 tices given t!ie Farm Journal. Although our limits 
 will not enable us to rc-ciprocate these valuable fa- 
 rors, it may be a source of satisfoction to our edito- 
 rial brethren to know, that they have been largely 
 instrumental in bringing our Journal before the pub- 
 lic, and in doing this, have, we trust, aided in awa- 
 kening a deeper interest in the cause of agriculture. 
 Our earnest and lieartfclt thanks must therefore be 
 received as pay, having nothing better to offer.

Wo give above, an accurate represontaticm of a 
 highly valuable portable instrument, designed for 
 fumigating Green Houses, Frani'es, Dwellings, Ships, 
 Closets and "Wardrobes ; also Shrubs, Kusos and out- 
 door plants, in the open air without tho slightest 
 injury to those of the most delicate character. Its 
 use and value will be undi-rstond from the follow- 
 ing : 

" The instrument is availalile for fumigating Api- 
 aries, or houses and ships during the prevaleuce of 
 Cholera, or otlier epidemic Diseases, or when infested 
 by insects ; with it, also, Rooms and Closets may be 
 scented by burning Lavender or otheraromatic Herbs. 
 The Instrument is of most easy application, the sub- 
 stance to be used for fumigation being placed in the 
 magazine at top and ignited with a match or paper, 
 in precisely the same manner as an ordinary smoking 
 pijie ; it is so light that it can be carried about and 
 used by a Lady without inconvenience. All that is 
 necessarj" is to introduce the nozzle into an aperture 
 in the door or glass of a Groen-house, and by turning 
 tho handle it will soon be filled with smoke ; nor is 
 the Machine less offcctivein the open air,for thosmokc 
 being concentrated to a point, and made to issue in 
 any requireci direction, the whole force of the Instru- 
 ment can be brought to bear on any particular affect- 
 ed part. A great deal of Tobacco may be saved by 
 placing the Plant under a paper tent shoot, or some 
 other temporary covering, during the operation." — 
 It is mauufacturod and sold by 11. Buist, Seedsman 
 of Philadelphia.
