 The Importaucc of Agricultural Education. 

BY JOHN L. BLAKE, D. D. 

What is agricultural education ? The question is 
 here propounded that a reply may be given . for the 
 masses of the agricultural community do not seem to 
 know what it is, although it has been a common topic 
 of declamation in the annual agricultural addresses 
 and orations for more than a score of years. Indeed 
 mure than half a eenturj- since, "Washington incul- 
 cated the necessity of it. For a long succession of 
 years, the zealous and talented Mr. Garnett, of Vir- 
 ginia, labored to promote it. No small part of the 
 long life of the yctcran Skinner, beginning his labors, 
 in Maryland and ending them in the Keystone State, 
 ■vrere consecrated to it. The ever to be lamented 
 Judge Buel, of New York, devoted to it the best pow. 
 era of his accomplished mind. If we look farther 
 north and eastward for kindred labors, we shall find 
 that the venerable Timothy Pickering, the companion 
 of Washington, was as much distinguished for his 
 efforts in the cause of agricultural education as he 
 was in the science of sovernment and the political 
 history of his country. And the venerable John 
 Lowell, of Boston, one of the most accomplished 
 scholars of his time, spread an undying halo around 
 rural literature and agricultural science. And the 
 recently deceased I^aac Hill, of New Hampshire — 
 first, an humble printer, then Senator in Congress ■ 
 afterwards Governor of that State — spent the last ten 
 years of his life, in advocating agricultural education, 
 and the great interests of rural life, and yet the mas- 
 ses of our farmers seem at a loss to know what all 
 this can m"an ; do not seo-m aware that farmers need 
 education. 

To us, the apathy and the want of apprehension on 
 this subject, among the masses of our agriculturists 
 is a paradox. We know not how to account for it. —

Both instinct and reason seem opposed to it. Inter- 
 est too is opposed to this apathy ; and, we might 
 seemingly with as much success apply to our legisla- 
 tures, for half a million of dollars to make balloons 
 to go to the planet Jupiter, as to expend it in organ- 
 izing our colleges and common schools for the purpo- 
 ses of agricultural education. Why is this? Is it 
 because the multitudes of our farmers think it unne- 
 cessary ; think that the being born on a farm is suf- 
 ficient for the labors of agriculture ; that with those 
 being so born, there is as much of an instinct for 
 these labors, as there is with the newly dropped calf 
 or colt for finding the natural food yielded by its dam? 
 So far are they from supposing that books and study 
 are needful to the successful prosecution of these la- 
 bors, that they imagine all may be learned in a com- 
 paratively short period of personal observation during 
 the season of tillage. Is it not a fact, that we might 
 suppose they think the merchant may at any moment 
 forsake his ledger and his bank books, the blacksmith 
 his anvil and bellows, the physician his saddle bags 
 and his nostrums, the sailor his quadrant and his log 
 book, the tailor his press board and shears, and the 
 shoemaker his bristles and his lap stone, although so 
 ignorant of tillage and agricultural implements and 
 their use, as not to know whether a fanning mill i 
 designed to drive away rausquitoes and flies, or foJ 
 some other purpose, may forthwith, without the aid 
 of study or books become first rate agriculturists ? — 
 Xo disrespect is intended to our agricultural breth- 
 ren. Surely we feel none. For them we have great 
 regard. Their unwearied devotion to manual labor 
 is proverbial. Their habits of economy are worthv 
 of universal imitation. And in natural intelligence 
 they are below no class of men ; for it is a well known 
 truth, that most of our great men at the bar, in the 
 pulpit, in the healing art, upon the bench, and in the 
 legislative halls are from the ranks of rural life. Still 
 in the particular we are discussing they are sadly de- 
 ficient and blind to their own interests. 

What then is agricultural education ? Let us ask 
 in turn what is medical education ? What 13 legal
