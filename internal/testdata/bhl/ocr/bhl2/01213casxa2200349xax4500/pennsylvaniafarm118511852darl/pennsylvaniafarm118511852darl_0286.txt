cdueaticin ? What is theological education ? What 
 is mercantile education ? What is mechanical edu- 
 cation ? ]\Iost of our farmers, although in the common 
 acceptation of language, illiterate, would have a pretty 
 just apprehension of the answers to be given to these 
 interrogatories. They might not indeed give written 
 definitions to them of grammatical purity, but the 
 substance of such definitions would be well under- 
 stood by them. They well know, that a medical ed- 
 ucation embraces a knowledge of the numerous dis- 
 eases to which we are subject, the gradual develope- 
 ment and all the diversified types of these diseases ; 
 and, above all, the antidotes and remedies known to 
 exist and constituting the mysteries of the healing 
 art. They well know thit a theological education 
 embraces a familiar knowledge of ancient languages, 
 particularly those in which our sacred books were 
 originally written, with a history of ancient usages 
 and customs, having relation to them, and with the 
 well established and authorized interpetation to these 
 books. They wellknowthatalegal education embraces 
 a thorough knowledge of the acknowledged principles 
 of justice in the diversified ramifications of business 
 and property, as understood by common usage, and as 
 settled by our courts of jurisprudence. They well 
 know that a mercantile education embraces a knowl- 
 edge of trade in all its departments — the various 
 kinds of merchandize — whence they are obtained — 
 where they will be wanted — what is their present 
 or prospective value — together with every fact con- 
 nected with judicial and monetary operations, wheth- 
 er of interest or exchange. And they well know that 
 a mechanical education embraces a knowledge of the 
 raw materials requisite in the formation of any pre- 
 scribed object ; of the various tools necessary in pro- 
 ducing such formation ; and, especially of a familiar 
 habit and experience in using them. 

Are not our farmers familiar with all this ? Do thej' 
 not generally act with all requisite wisdom and 
 shrewdness in regard to it ? They surely do. If they 
 have a son, designed to be a physician, do they sim- 
 ply furnish him with his saddle bags, his nostrums, 
 aad his pocey, and send him direct from the plough, 
 on missions for the curing of fevers, for performances 
 in obstetrics and for the amputation of limbs ? If 
 they wish to make him a divine, do they send him 
 direct from the plough to the pulpit with no prepara- 
 tion but a suit of black clothes ? If they wish to make 
 him a lawyer, do they send him immediately from the 
 manure heap to the bar, with no preparation but a 
 green bag and a quantum of impudence, the offspring 
 of ignorance ? Or, if they wish to make him a mer- 
 chant do they not place him for a due period of time 
 in a counting house of established reputation ? Or, 
 if they wish to make him a mechanic do they not 
 place him as an apprentice for five, six or seven years, 
 \fith an artist well skilled in his particular vocation? 
 It is all so. This is as it should bo. This is the way 

to make young men respectable in their several pro- 
 fessions, and to enable them to become cmiueut. — 
 This is the secret why so many young men from rural 
 districts become so distinguished in the learned pro- 
 fessions, in merchandise, and in the mechanic arts. 

It would seem that with such an array of facts be- 
 fore us, there would be no diiSculty in telling the pro- 
 cess for an agricultural education ; and that farmers 
 would be prompt in providing it for their sons who 
 are to succeed their fathers in tilling the ground. — 
 The soil like every material object is suljject to change; 
 like an animal form, from use it becomes enervated 
 and unfit for its legitimate functions. Man from ex- 
 cessive or protracted labor and from want of due at- 
 tention to the use of food, becomes feeble and some- 
 times sickly. What is then done ? Why a physician 
 is broiight to his aid ; regimen is prescribed for him, 
 medicine is administered to him ; and, if the case has 
 not been too long neglected, the invalid is restored and 
 he again is in a condition to perform the labors of life. 
 Who does not know that the soil becomes enervated 
 and sickly from long or injudicious use, much as a 
 man may become bilious, feverish and consumptive ? 
 Else why is it that hundreds and tliousands of farms 
 once verdant, productive and lucrative, in the Atlan- 
 tic sections of our country, have become sterile and 
 worthless, and have been abandoned ? And, why is 
 it that in multitudes of cases, the crops arc now not 
 what they once were by half? Tliere can but one an- 
 swer be given. The exigency admits of no evasion. 
 The siin shines with its enlivening influences upon it, 
 as it has done from the time when tlie morning stars 
 sang and shouted that all was perfect. The dews of 
 heaven descend and refresh itwith the regularity that 
 they descended upon the ancient hills of Hcrmon and 
 Zion. The rain, either in gentle showers or in copi- 
 ous torrents, has not failed any more to satisfy it, 
 when parched and thirsty, now, in the nineteenth cen- 
 tury, than when the Puritans were spreading them- 
 selves over New England, or William Penn and his 
 followers were applying the plouglishare about the 
 Delaware, the Schuylkill and the Susquehanna. The 
 truth is, the soil has become sickly andnceds medicine. 
 To apply the restorative process to the soil, there 
 should be an agricultural physician — a chemist. He 
 will tell at once how it can be done, as well as the 
 regular practitioner in the healing art, can tell how 
 to purify and replenish tlie blood, or to remove bile or 
 fever from the human system. Agricultural educa- 
 tion teaches the process for restoring a worn out soil; 
 the best process of tillage ; the best kinds of animals 
 to remunerate the owner ; the best rotation of crops 
 to prevent exhaustion of the soil ; the best implements 
 in rural culture ; and, indeed it teaches whatever is 
 connected with the amelioration and profits of agri- 
 cultural labor. Agriculture should as much be taught 
 in all our schools as arithmetic, or grammar, or geog- 
 raphy. Till this is done, every farmer must depend
