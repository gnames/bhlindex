Oil change of Seed. 

JIr. Editor: — As you live in a county remarkable 
 ior its good cultivation, and especially for its crops 
 of wheat, can you, from some of your well-informed 
 farmers, get any satisfactory- practical information as 
 to the following points ; 

1st. Whether a frequent change of seed, is a cor- 
 rect and judicious proceeding, and whether, on good 
 soil and under good cultivation, we may not sow the 
 same seed on the same farm, so long as those two 
 conditions continue. I am aware there is a prejudice 
 in favor of frequent changes of seed, and I am also 
 certain that I have suffered, from yielding to this 
 prejudice. My observation, is decidedly against it, 
 but my experience has not been sufficiently long to 
 authorize me to be very decided and dogmatic. 

About once in two or three years, the farmer, or 
 some farmers, think it necessary to try the seed from 
 the farm of some one else. It does not seem to be 
 of much consequence, whether it comes from a neigh- 
 boring place, or one at a distance, or from another 
 State, or from another part of the world, the object 
 seems to be the excitement and novelty of new seed, 
 without regard to circumstances. 

Is this prejudice and this action upon it, right? or 
 is not one_ of those ill digested and unreflecting im- 
 pulses, that act on men, some times nearly as strong- 
 ly in serious matters, as in frivolous. It is very na- 
 tural, in an art so precarious as agriculture, that men 
 should be liable to the forming of hasty conclusions. 
 A man finds that his crops are bad, that he raises 
 less, than a neighbor. He does not like to charge 
 himself, with this ill-fortune — as the result of his 
 ignorance, or of his negligence — but prefers assum- 
 ing, that his brother farmer has better luck, with- 
 out admitting the possibility of better cultivation, or 
 of more intelligence on the part of his neighbor. 

Admitting this to be the state of feeling with many 
 farmers, how are we to decide, that their action is 
 proper, and worthy of being followed ? 

Let us consider what are the conditions, that make 
 seed worth the sowing. In the first place, it should 
 be perfectly ripe or matured, and then carefully pre- 
 served, so that it may not suffer the slightest deterior- 
 ation, before being put into the ground to i eproduee. 
 It is a matter of common observation that imperfect, 
 badlv matured seed, will germinate, and sometimes 
 produce healthy plants, but the chances are the other 
 way, and the disposition, no matter how favorable 
 the circumstances, is unquestionably to disease. As 
 a practice, therefore, the sowing of unhealthy or im- 

perfect grain, is a bad one and leads inevitably to a 
 failure of the crop. There are very few seasons in 
 which for reasons very difficult to get at, the wheat 
 is not laid. Sometimes it is ascribed to Hessian fly, 
 sometimes to the ground being too highly manured, 
 and the stem being weakened by overgrowth ; but 
 throwing aside the causes which we can only conjec- 
 ture, we have the important question to solve, wheth- 
 er grain from plants that have been laid, and which 
 necessarily is an imperfect seed, is fit to be sown. It 
 may, as we have said, germinate, but can we assure 
 ourselves of a good crop or a healthy fruit. We be- 
 lieve every experienced agriculturist, has decided 
 this point, and against the sowing of seed that is in 
 the slightest degree imperfect. But much the larger 
 portion of farmers reserve this bad grain without a 
 question, and have we not in this practice an excel- 
 lent reason for the failure of crops of which there is 
 every year so much complaint, and does not this 
 make necessary a change of seed, which under other 
 eircumstances,would be of little importance — a change 
 derived directly from the Ijad, slovenly management 
 of the farmer himself; and is it not from this source 
 too, that much of the land in the country has be- 
 come gradually unfitted for the raising of large crops 
 of wheat, of which at one time the country could 
 boast ? In this way, we have the f;irmer playing into 
 the hands of his o\vn ruin. 

The rule should be the same in sowing seed, as in 
 breeding animals, none but the best and most perfect 
 should be used for the reproduction of its kind, and 
 we are convinced that if this rule were adhered to, 
 there would be less necessity for this frequent change 
 of seed, which is now considered almost essential. — 
 "We are perfectly aware of the greater nicety, care, 
 attention and labor required, if we are to bring any 
 practice in agriculture to much refinement, we know 
 full well the devotions, the anxiety, as well as toil, 
 that every farmer must give to his art, if he wishes 
 to have eminent success in it, or desires to improve 
 it. But it is the same with every occupation, both 
 the soul and mind must engage in the work, or the 
 individual and his pursuit, will be stationary. A 
 man should do something more than like a chicken, 
 merely scratch over the earth to collect his morning 
 worm — he has, or should have, a purpose and a de- 
 sign higher than to gratify the mere animal wants of 
 his nature. 

On this seemingly insignificant point, of which we 
 are speaking, depends vastly more than would be 
 disclosed upon a superficial examination. It has mo- 
 ral as well as physical results. There is deep disap- 
 pointment and mortification in a failure : there is 
 waste of time, labor and land ; there is perhaps an 
 abandonment of the soil, a change of pursuit, or a 
 L-hange in the crop, and the mode of farming. All 
 these may follow on the w?nt of care, the want of ob- 
 servation, the want of reflection, and too hasty yield-
