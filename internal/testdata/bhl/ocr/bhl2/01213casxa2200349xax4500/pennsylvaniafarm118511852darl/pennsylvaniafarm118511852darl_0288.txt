ing to the opinion of others, and to the forming of 
 prejudice. 

But we will .suppose that the farmer has acceded 
 to the supposed necessity of a change of seed, and 
 has made his purchase ; what is the evidence that it 
 is better than his own ? Does it look better, or does 
 it weigh more, or has he gained any thing, but the 
 simple change ? Does he know the soil where it 
 grew, the mode of cultivation by which it was raised? 
 He cannot answer, perhaps, one of these questions ; 
 yet he has not hesitated to make a vague and uncer- 
 tain experiment, under the impulse and influence of 
 an opinion that has but a feeble foundation, and 
 vrhich has forced him into the strong tide of a bad 
 custom, while the truth is, that it is his want of in- 
 telligence or industry that causes his inferiority as 
 an agriculturist, and that he who sells him the grain 
 is superior from greater care, zeal, labor and atten- 
 tion. It may bo that the nature of the soil differs so 
 much in the place where the seed is to be sown, from 
 that whence it was selected, that the experiment can 
 but be unfortunate. Yet 'this is not considered, nor 
 is the equally important circumstance of climate, at 
 all regarded ; two elements, it might be supposed, 
 of essential importance, in our decision. Two ques- 
 tions, would naturally come into every cautious farm- 
 er's mind, when on the point of executing what may 
 be to him so serious a matter, as a change of seed. 
 First, is the person from whom I intend to purchase, 
 a worse or a better farmer than I am, and is his soil 
 the same or different? Then he would also consider 
 the climate, if it were at a distance from his own re- 
 sidence. But we have never known these questions 
 to be asked, and whether the grain came from New 
 York, Virginia, Europe or Egypt, seemed to be of 
 little consequence, it was put in the ground upon hit 
 or miss principle, and if it succeeded, he flattered 
 himself that it was the result of judicious farming 
 operations ; and if it was unsuccessful, he did not 
 disparage or blame himself, but vented his sensibili- 
 ties on the seed or the season. Now, we are disposed 
 to believe, that in no case will a good crop be made, 
 excepting where the seed is of an inferior character, 
 and brought from a soil and climate, not as well cal- 
 culated for its development, as that into which it is 
 to be transferred. For instance, let the golden drop, 
 or some other of the celebrated wheats, be brought 
 from the moist climate and cultivated soil of England, 
 and sown here, in our hot and dry atmosphere, and 
 xindcr an inferior cultivation, would it not immediate- 
 ly deteriorate ? It would be the same with grain 
 brought from France. But the IMediterranean is an 
 example of the opposite kind. When first brought 
 to this country, it was by no means of a promising 
 appearance, but a milder climate, and a better soil 
 than that of its original home, has almost metamor- 
 phosed it into a grain of a fine quality. Is it possible 
 then, to lay down any fixed rules, in this matter ? — 

We cannot venture to do it, and should like the ex- 
 pression of an opinion from some experienced and 
 observing farmer. There is another point on which 
 we should like to hear something. Is it a good or 
 bad practice to re-sow the grain that you have just 
 harvested ? It has this objection, you cannot toll 
 whether you are or are not putting in the ground, 
 much bad or imperfect grain, whereas that of the 
 year before has given some evidence of its vitality. — 
 As these are points of importance, it would bo doing 
 a great favor to the agricultural community, if an ex- 
 pression of opinion were freely given.

 Small potatoes vs. large potatoes for seed — The rot. 

Mr. Editor : — As the season for the selection of 
 seed potatoes is past, and the generality of farmers 
 have already made up their minds in regard to the 
 kind of potatoes they intend using for seed next sea- 
 son, it will perhaps be useless for me to offer any 
 suggestions to your readers in regard to the matter. 
 However, as there may be a few, who would like to 
 hear a suggestion, and try a small experiment, I will 
 offer the one, and give them a chance to try the 
 other. 

Many years ago, I was induced to believe that in 
 sowing or planting seeds, the best and most perfectly 
 developed, were the kind to be used. Experience has 
 satisfied me that my belief was correct. A number 
 of experiments, with large and small potatoes for seed, 
 always resulted largely in favor of the former. The 
 difference in yield has been so great, that I would 
 rather pay a dollar a bushel for large potatoes for 
 seed, than take small ones as a gift, and my reasons 
 are these : There is every ground for presuming that 
 the largest potatoes are generally the most thorough- 
 ly ripened — that they have imbibed a larger propor- 
 tion of the life of the plant, and are, consequently, 
 better fitted to reproduce tubers of the same quality. 
 Small potatoes, it is true, may sometimes be equally 
 well ripened, but it is very evident, that they are 
 products of the last remaining elements of life in the 
 plant. 

Again : Small potatoes are very frequently of se- 
 cond growth. It is well known to those who grow 
 potatoes, that the first growth is a'ways the most vi- 
 gorous and decidedly the largest, so that the second 
 or small potato growth, does not seem to possees, in 
 as great degree, the re-productive properties requisite 
 to the perfection of the plant as the first. 

Again : The first growth of potatoes being the 
 largest and most perfectly developed, and at the same 
 time, fully matured, before the small ones can have 
 an existence, I make it a point always to select my 
 seed from those hills where no second growth has 
 taken place. If any of your readers are curious
