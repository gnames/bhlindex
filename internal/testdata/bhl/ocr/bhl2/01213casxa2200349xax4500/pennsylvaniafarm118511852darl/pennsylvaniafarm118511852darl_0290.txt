tirely -within your own control. But there is an other 
 advantage, of which our experience enables us to 
 speak, that of harrowirg wheat in he spring as ear- 
 ly as the condition of the ground will allow. We 
 have practised this for several years with decided ad- 
 vantage, not only because of the benefit which the 
 growing wheat derives from it, but of the admirable 
 condition in which it puts the ground for the recep- 
 tion of t'lC clover-sccd which is usually sowed at this 
 period. If the ground be harrowed, the clover-seed 
 be then sowed, and a roller of considerable weight 
 passed over the whole, it will be an extraordinary and 
 unfavorable season if your stubble after harvest be 
 not well set with clover. 

But I must not drop the subject, even at the risk of 
 being tedious, without some remark upon the subject 
 of the four cornered harrow, which is in common use 
 and which is a very inefficient implement for this, as 
 it is for all other purposes. The harrow which we 
 use, is composed of two parts, being connected in the 
 middle by hinges, so that it may conform more per- 
 fectly to the inequalities of the ground, and having 
 in each part sixteen teeth of the usual length and 
 seven-eights of an inch square. It will be found that 
 in the operation of harrowing wheat, the common har- 
 row will do very little work ; it will be required to 
 go over the ground more than once to put it in the 
 condition that a single stroke with a good implement 
 would do. If a harrow-tooth be properly made, by 
 hammering inch and a quarter square iron, without 
 intense heating, down to seven-eighths of an inch 
 square, you will find the smaller tooth to be stronger, 
 stiffer, more duraljle, and of course as you may mul- 
 tiply the number, much more efficient than the large 
 clumsy one which has had no other work upon it 
 than that which was necessary to draw it to a point at 
 a white heat. There need be no fear of disturbing 
 the roots of the wheat by this operation. We use a 
 1 eavy, sharp harrow with thirty two teeth, which pro- 
 duces no other eScct than that which is entirely ben- 
 eficial. Fred'k. Watts.

 Select Good Seed, &c. 
 Mr. Editor : — Having duringthe past summer and 
 fall suffered somewhat in the products of my garden, 
 by the selection of bad seed, it has occurred to me 
 that a few hints thrown out to your readers, might 
 serve to save them fi-om the same unpleasant conse- 
 quences. It is with seed precisely as it is with cat 
 tie. As the finest animals will almost invariably- 
 piroduce the best progeny, so will choice seeds pro 
 duce the most thrifty plants. The only difiiculty in 
 the matter is to know where to procure the best. So 
 many establishments for the raising and sale of gar- 
 den seeds have been opened in every direction within 
 the last few years, that there is no want of places 
 where to purchase, and as a consequence of this ri- 

valry in the business, many seeds that are wholly 
 worthless, are sold to the unsuspecting, It was 
 through one of these establishments that I received 
 the seeds to which I referred above, Some would not 
 vegetate at all, although the most careful attention 
 was paid them, while others turned out to be any 
 thing else than the labels on the packages represented 
 them to be. To blame the person who sold the seed, 
 for all these defects, might seem a little unfair, and 
 yet I do not know where the blame should attach if 
 not to him, unless it would be to my own want of 
 judgment. Perhaps it was the latter, and therefore 
 in order to guard against any such mishaps in future 
 I have determined to purchase no seeds unless I am 
 perfectly satisfied that the seedsman from whom I 
 purchase them, is not only honest, but a competent 
 judge ot the article he is selling. 

While on the subject of seeds, I will remark that 
 too much care cannot be exercised in putting them 
 into the ground. Some contend for deep covering, 
 others for shallow. I prefer the latter for several 
 reasons. Nature never plants but always sows, and 
 than this good old mother of ours, there is no better 
 gardener. Adopting therefore natural principles, I 
 cannot but think that the proper depth for seed is^ 
 such a covering of earth as will enable the tender 
 stem of the plant to reach the surface, and at the 
 same^time protect the germ from destruction by heat. 
 Another important matter in putting in seed, is 
 the condition of the ground. I well remember how 
 when I was a boy, we always waited until after a 
 shower to plant our garden seeds, and I remember 
 also, tliat although the soil had previously been well 
 pulverized, by the time we were done, it was nearly 
 the consistency of mortar, and as soon as the sun 
 shone upon it, became a hard crust. Of course the 
 young plant would have great difficulty in making its 
 way through this crust, if it succeeded at all. My 
 plan is, to sow my seeds in dry weather or when 
 practicable, when there is a prospect of a shower. — 
 By this I do not mean that the best time for sowing 
 seed is, when the earth is very dry, but when the soil 
 is in such a condition that it will readily pulverize, 
 so that it can bo brought in contact with the smallest 
 seed. If the expected shower comes, so much the 
 better, as it brings the earth still closer round the 
 seeds and thus promotes early and vigorous germina- 
 tion. A little attention to the selection of seed, and 
 the time and manner of putting them in the ground 
 is vastly important. E. L. F.
