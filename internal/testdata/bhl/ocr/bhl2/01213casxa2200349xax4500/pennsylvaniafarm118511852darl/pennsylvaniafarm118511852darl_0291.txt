competition with the farmers of Ohio, Indiana, and 
 other Western States. It appeared to me, in reading 
 A. L. H.'s truthful article, that he did not attach 
 sufficient importance to that fact, as to me it seems 
 to he one that should claim earnest and early atten- 
 tion. 

The difference between the price of our best wheat 
 growing lands, and lands of the same quality in the 
 West is so great, that our market facilities are al- 
 most counterbalanced by it. An Indiana farmer as- 
 sured me the other day, that wheat could be raised 
 profitably, in that State, at fifty cents a bushel. — 
 With us, wheat is not worth raising if it will not 
 command a dollar, and even at that price, but little 
 money is made. Now, if an Indiana farmer can 
 raise wheat profitably at fifty cents per bushel less 
 than the Lancaster county farmer, it leaves him fifty 
 cents to pay the freight on that bushel of wheat to 
 the Atlantic seaboard. Will that sum pay the freight? 
 Now, perhaps, not ; but so soon as the great Central 
 Railroad is completed to Pittsburg, (which will be, 
 in less than a twelvemonth,) it certainly will. — 
 When there is a continuous line of railroad from 
 Philadelphia to the heart of the State of Indiana, 
 wheat can be transported to the former place, at less 
 than fifty or even thirty cents, and how will afliiirs 
 then stand ? It is very apparent that unless our far- 
 mers are prepared to grow wheat at less than eighty 
 cents, they must turn tlijir attention to something 
 more profitable, unless, adopting A. L. H.'s sugges- 
 tion, they set to work in good earnest and compensate 
 for the decrease in price by the increase in yield. — 
 If they can double their present crop, at the present 
 outlay of labor and money, well and good, but if they 
 cannot, wheat growing must be abandoned, at least, 
 it cannot be continued as the staple crop of the lime- 
 stone lands. 

In reflecting upon this subject, it has occurred to 
 me that corn, under any circumstances, is a more 
 profitable crop than wheat. Of course forty bushels 
 of corn to the acre will not pay as well as twenty- 
 five or thirty bushels of wheat ; but why should not 
 our excellent land produce eighty or ninety bushels 
 of corn as well as forty ? There are farmers in Lan- 
 caster county whose yields of corn are rarely less in 
 a favorable season than eighty bushels, and there is 
 no good reason why every farmer upon the good 
 lands should not realise as much. 

I am not prepared to state the difference between 
 the cost of cultivating an acre of corn and an acre 
 of wheat, but I am satisfied, that it would not be as 
 great as the difference in the value of the two crops. 
 I have written the above, more with the hope of awa- 
 kening attention to the subject, than with any desire 
 to intrude my crude article upon your readers.

For the Farm Journal. 
 The Importance of Commuuicating Facts. 

Mr. Editor : Some time since in looking over my 
 weekly papers, I came across an article which inte- 
 rested me very much, and in which the triumph of 
 Science in Agrieulture was so clearly shown, that I 
 could not but feci how immensely important such 
 knowledge must be to the practical farmer. I refer 
 to the restoration, or renovation rather of the farm 
 of Reverdy Johnson of Baltimore, which, when ho 
 purchased it was apparently so completely exhausted, 
 as not to produce more than a single peck of corn to 
 the acre, but by the application of a single ingredi- 
 ent ("biphosphateof lime") was made to yield twenty 
 nine bushels to the acre, the first season after it was 
 applied. The story at first appeared a little incredi- 
 ble, but when I observed that it was sustained by the 
 very best authority, and that unerring science had 
 proven the want of this particular ingredient only, 
 to render the soil productive, my own common sense 
 taught me that there was no mistake about it. Being 
 a practical man myself, and having for many years 
 stood opposed to any other than the "good old way," 
 of farming.you will not be surprised at my indulging 
 a doubt in regard to this experiment. I have always 
 contended against the innovations of theorists and 
 mere experimenters, honestly believing that they 
 were doing serious mischief, not only to themselves 
 but to thousands of others who were induced to 
 adopt their suggestions. So deep rooted was my 
 prejudice that I have never permitted an agricultu, 
 ral journal to come into my house, and there are 
 thousands of others like me. But after reading that 
 article I sat down to reflect upon it, and the more I 
 thought about it, the more fully was I convinced of 
 the fact that I had been standing in my own light. 
 I began to have a little faith in "book farming," and 
 for the first time in my life regretted that I had not 
 expended a dollar or two each year for one or two 
 good agricultural papers. If Reverdy Johnson's 
 farm needed the application of but a single ingredient 
 to redeem it from utter barreness to a fair degree of 
 fertility, might not some of my own land be in pretr 
 ty nearly the same condition and would not the ad- 
 dition of perhaps a single fertilizing element enable 
 me to largely increase my crops. I just then remem- 
 bered that my crops had been lessening in quantity 
 every year for the last five or six years, notwithstard 
 ing all my exertions to keep up to the average yield, 
 This rather alarmed me. It never appeared half so 
 serious before, and I resolved at once to inquire into 
 the matter ; but where to begin or how, I was at a 
 loss to know, I would have paid any price to be en- 
 abled to tell what the constituents of my soil were, 
 but that was out of the question, unless I could se- 
 cure the services of some chemist, who would anal- 
 yse it for me. And now Mr. Editor, having under- 
 stood from a neighbor who takes your .Journal, tli»^*
