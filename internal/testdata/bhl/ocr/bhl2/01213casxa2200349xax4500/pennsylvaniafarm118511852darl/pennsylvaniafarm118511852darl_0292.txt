[Januaet, 

you propose having soils analysed, will you be kind 
 enough to write to me, and inform me liow I shall 
 proceed, and at the same time, send me the Farm 
 Journal, the subscription money for which you will 
 find enclosed. I am determined henceforth, to know 
 what science is doing for the farmer, and though I 
 I cannot hope to become a scientific farmer myself, I 
 foel that I shall lose nothing by becoming familiar 
 with what is going on in the agricultural world, while 
 at the same time, my boys will have a chance of im- 
 Inbing a taste for valuable agricultural reading. 

Very Respectfully, A. II.

[We commend the above common sense letter to 
 those of our readers who do not think it worth their 
 while to communicate facts for the Journal. If the 
 hoarded up experience aud![observation of our practi- 
 cal men were given to the public, what immense be- 
 nefits would result. As A. II. remarks, "there are 
 thousands of others like him!" and all that is neces- 
 sary to root out their long cherished prejudices, is 
 some striking fact presented to them in a form calcu- 
 lated to arrest their attention as in the case of A. II. 
 himself. — Ed.]

Oxygen in combination with sodium forms natron 
 or soda — which is a resulting product of the conver- 
 sion of common salt into carbonate of soda. For 
 this purpose common salt is treated with sulphuric 
 acid in a rcverboratory furnace, (tis. 14,) the salt be-

 ing first spread evenly in the rear division of the 
 furnace, and sulphuric acid being thou poured there- 
 on from above by means of a funnel. When the ev- 
 olution of gas ceases, the dry mass is freed from its 
 excess of sulphuric acid by heat, in the interior part 
 of the furnace, and dry sulphate of soda remains. 

Soda is never found in a pure state, but always in 
 combination witli an acid, for wliicli it possesses great 
 affinity. In such combinations it serves as a substan- 
 tial aliment of plants. But animals likewise require 
 soda, and hence they must regularly and frequently 
 be supplied with salt, which is a combination of soda 
 and cldorine. It is in consequence of tlie extensive 
 consumption of salt Ijy men aud animals that soda is 

almost every where found in the soil, and usually in 
 quantities adequate to the wants of plants and culti- 
 vated crops. But where a deficiency of this ingredi- 
 ent of the soil becomes apparent, it can be supplied 
 by a dressing of common coarse salt, sown broadca it. 
 Of the various combinations of soda with acids, the 
 sulphate of soda, or Glauber's salt, is interesting to 
 the farmer as an excellent fertilizer or stimulant. It 
 is obtained as a resulting product in the preparation 
 of Salamoniac, aud in the manufacture of muriatic 
 acid from common salt. Sprengel says that numer- 
 ous experiments resulted in demonstrating the value 
 of sulphate of soda in promoting vegetable growth, 
 especially when applied to the clovers and legumin- 
 ous plants in general. Its efiicacy, like that of gyp- 
 sum, probably results from the sulphuric acid it con- 
 tains. Owing to its great solubility in water, it can 
 be applied safely only in small quantity ; and it can 
 only be ascertained by repeated trials, how much each 
 particular kind of crop requires, or will bear, on a 
 given area. The application of it to fruit trees, is al- 
 so alleged to be highly beneficial in increasing their 
 productiveness ; though no reliable experiments have 
 been published. Wherever this article can be pro- 
 cured at a low price, as in the immediate vicinity of 
 chemical works, the farmer will find the judicious use 
 of it advantageous. 

Another very important, as well as frequent com- 
 bination of oxygen, is that with calcium, producing 
 calcareous earth or liyne. In its pure state calcareous 
 earth is a very caustic white powder, but it loses its 
 causticity as soon as it combines with an acid. Cal- 
 careous earth is most commonly found in combination 
 with carljouic acid, constituting common limestone, or 
 with sulphuric acid, forming gypsum, or plaster of 
 Paris — both of which contain a certain quantity of 
 water in chemical combination. If this water and 
 the carbonic acid be driven off from common lime- 
 stone by means of fire, we obtain burnt lime — which, 
 if left exposed to atmospheric air, will again absorb 
 carbonic acid therefrom, after it has become slaked 
 by imbibing moisture or water. In consequence of 
 of the action of the carbonic acid of the atmospheric 
 or calcareous earth, traces of it are found in most 
 soils, and spring water usually holds it in solution, 
 whence results the fertilizing property of such water. 
 This solubility of calcareous earth is a quality of gi-eat 
 importance in agriculture, as many plants require 
 large proportions of lime for their due developement 
 and growth ; and it can readily be ascertained wheth- 
 er a soil contains much lime by placing a small quan- 
 tity of it in a vial and pouring some dilute sulpijuric 
 acid thereon. If effervescence and disengagement of 
 gas ensue, the presence of lime is certain. To sup- 
 ply the soil with calcareous eartli, it is dressed with 
 marl or caustic lime. The latter combines with the 
 acids in sour soils, rendering those acids harmless by 
 converting them into a neutral salt.
