part, was forty bushels, and from the decided supe- 
 riority of the part composted, I cannot Ijut think the 
 yield from it amounted to sis or eight bushels more. 
 We put it in wheat again the following year, the crop 
 being fully equal to the last. We then sowed it in 
 grass, (clover and timothy mixed,) and finer grass I 
 never saw. The difference between the composted 
 and non-composted part was plainly apparent. On 
 the former it was lodged early in the season, and we 
 had considerable difficulty in mowing it. It lay in 
 grass for four years, until last spring, when we 
 again plowed it down and put it in corn. The yield 
 was so heavy that I had purposed measuring it, and 
 reporting it to the State Agricultural Fair, but was ' 
 prevented by a particular circumstance. I 

I mention these facts for the purpose of showing the j 
 permanent advantages of lime as a fertilizer.as the ben- 
 efits derived from composting as above show. It is 
 proper t.i state that at the time of applying the compost 
 to the acre and a half, the other part of the field was 
 heavily manured with barn-yard manure, and al- 
 though the yield on it was large and fine, it did not 
 equal that where the lime and loam was applied. I 
 now consider it in such prime condition that I purpose 
 putting it in corn next spring, without any additional 
 fertilizer ; but I shall enrich that part on which the 
 farm-yard manure had been applied with a dressing 
 of the same kind, reserving the acre and a half for the 
 purpose of testing thoroughly the length of time that 
 will elapse before it will require any additional fer- 
 tilizer. J. F. H.

 Keep your cattle comfortable. 

Mk. Editor: — There are many errors in {arming 
 which are the result, not of a want of disposition to 
 correct them, but of a want of knowledge of the fac- 
 that they are errors. One prominent amongst them 
 is, the poor shelter generally afforded to farm stock 
 in winter. We often see cattle exposed to the biting 
 blasts and chilling rains, even whei'e the o vner has 
 all the conveniences and room for keeping them warm 
 and comfortable. In this, as in many other particu- 
 lars, the old system is retained, and cattle presumed 
 to be capable of bearing any degree of exposure, with- 
 out injury. Did those who thus inconsiderately treat 
 their animals so cruelly, but understand as every 
 farmer should, the advantages of affording to them 
 not merely shelter, but comfortable shelter, we should 
 soon hear different accounts of the character of our 
 farm stock generally. Let them look at the jealous 
 care of the English farmers in this particular, and 
 when they have noted the superiority^, generally, of 
 their stock, let them compare them with the majority 
 of ours, and the disparity between the two will he so 
 great as to convince even the most skeptical, that the 
 expense of warm shelter and generous food will al- 
 ways be repaid by the increased value of the cattle. 

It is asserted by those who have investigated the 
 subject, and I am satisfied of the truth of it, that the 
 prevention of the escape of animal heat, is in a de- 
 gree, a substitute for food ; or in other words, the 
 quantity of food required to keep up the proper de- 
 gree of animal heat, where the animal is exposed to 
 cold and chilling weather, would, if it were kept 
 warmly sheltered, be converted into fat and muscle. 
 On the score of economy, then, to say nothing of hu- 
 manity to the poor cattle, whose only mode of com- 
 plaint is their shivering and wasting forms, is it-Jiot 
 well for the farmer to provide comfortable laces for 
 his stock. I have tried it, and find myself largely 
 the gainer, not only in the strength and fatness of 
 my cattle, but in the satisfaction I feel in- knowing 
 that the creatures under ji y care are properly pro- 
 vided for. E. Levering.

 Fattening Calves. 

Mr. Editor : — As the majority of calves are given 
 to the butcher, it becomes a matter of considerable 
 interest to the farmer to know how to put them in 
 the best condition before handing thsm over to be 
 slaughtered. Having tried various plans of feeding 
 in order to secure this object with the least possible 
 expense, I have at length found the following to be 
 the most economical : 

It is well known that during the first two weeks of 
 a calf's life, its growth is mainly in the bouos and 
 muscles. To promote this growth as much as possi- 
 ble, is the object first to be attained. Milk being its 
 natural food, the calf should of course have a portion 
 of the quantity its dam yields. As all of my cows 
 yield on an average from four to five gallons a day 
 while (resh, I found that one third of that quantity 
 mixed with the meal of beans, was as effectual in 
 forming bone and muscle, as the whole of its dam's 
 milk, or the quantity it would suck from her during 
 the day and night. 

As my calves are always sent to the butcher at four 
 weeks old, at the close of the second week I change 
 the food and instead of the bean meal, give them lin- 
 seed meal mixed with milk, of which they readily 
 partake, and fatten on it so rapidly that at the expi- 
 ration of four weeks I have them in fine condition for 
 market, and invariably get a better price, than when 
 I gave them the unlimited use of their dam's milk 
 and nothing else. It is proper to state that I never 
 permit them to have much exercise, as I have found 
 them much more difficult to fatten than when they 
 have not a chance to range much. 

I was induced to adopt this plan, from having seen 
 somewhere, an article on feeding cattle, in which the 
 muscle and fat-forming properties of different kinds 
 of food were discussed, and the practical value of 
 scientific knowledge to the farmer clearly shown. —
