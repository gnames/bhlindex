By this means I have secured a substitute, which en- 
 ables me to use the milk from my fresh cows several 
 ■weeks earlier, while my calves are, I think, finer than 
 before, and on calculating the expense, I find a con- 
 siderable balance in favor of the substitute for the 
 cow's milk. E. T.

 Thorough Tillage. 

Mr. Editor : — One fiict should ever be borne in 
 mind by the husbandman, and that fact is, that there 
 is something wanting beside manure, to secure remu- 
 nerating crops. There are those who conceive it suf- 
 ficient for all useful purposes, to stir their ground 
 with the plow, to a depth of four or five inches — -ap- 
 ply manure in such quantity as to them appears 
 necessary, and leave the rest to Providence. Some 
 go even farther than this, and one in particular, sume- 
 wheres "away down east," urges as an efiectual rem- 
 edy for the " potato rot" an abiding trust in Provi- 
 dence. Now this is all very well, and I cheerfully 
 agree with the " down easter," that our confidence in 
 Providence .should always be strong — that as He con- 
 trols the wind and the storm, in Him should our faith 
 be placed ; but at the same time, while He has prom- 
 ised that there should always be a seed time and a 
 harvest, He has also required that the means necessa- 
 ry to bring al)Out these seasons should be used. The 
 farmer therefore who does his work but half, and 
 consequently fails of success, is grossly irreverent in 
 attributing his failure, not to his own wretched sys- 
 tem of tillage, but to the seasons and to Providence. 
 I have said that there is something necessary to suc- 
 cessful farming, besides manure, and that something 
 is thorough tillage. 

One of the great elements of fertilization in soils, is 
 the perfect loosening of them, so that the different 
 ingredients composing them, be thoroughly incorpo- 
 rated, and brought to the surface, and thus receive 
 the advantages of exposure to the sun and atmosphere. 
 None but a simpleton would pretend to doubt the 
 value of manure, or assert the possibility of growing 
 good crops for any length of time without it, but he 
 is scarcely wiser who believes (and manifests his be- 
 lief in his daily practice,) that his crops will be abun- 
 dant where his tillage is meagre. Show mo the hus- 
 bandman whose plowing is shallow — whose breaking 
 of the clods preparatory to seeding is imperfectly 
 done — whose fields arc strangers to the roller, and 
 look very much as though the harrow or cultivator 
 had never been used upou them, and I will show you 
 poor yields — yields thatwill scarcely pay for the labor 
 and expense, much less leave any profit behind. 
 "Why, is it not the simplest matter in the world to un- 
 derstand the advantage which a deep and well work- 
 ed mellow soil possesses over a shallow, hard one ? If 
 there is any advantage at all to be gained by breaking 

up the soil, will not the benefit be greatest, when the 
 pulverization is most effectually done ? 

Why are our gardens more productive than our 
 fields ? Because we spade them twelve or fourteen 
 inches deep, and so thoroughly break up the soil that 
 we would be ashamed to have the beds show a lump 
 the size of a hazle nut. Do garden seeds require 
 more thorough tillage than wheat ? Sow wheat in 
 your garden, and your vegetables in your wheat 
 fields — give the former the same attention usually 
 given the latter, and let the result be your answer. — 
 A more satisfactory argument in favor of thorough 
 tillage will not be needed. When next you prepare 
 your grounds for seeding, set apart half an acre, plow 
 it nine inches instead of five, pulverize it well. In- 
 stead of permitting it to lie in large clods, use the 
 harrow and roller till this is accomplished; give it of 
 course, the same quantity of manure you give the 
 other parts of the field, and watch the result. It will 
 surjjrise you. There is no necessity for abating your 
 confidence in Providence ; but with tlie same trustful 
 heart, that induced you to believe that He would give 
 good crops with liad tillage, try the other plan, and 
 if you are disappointed, it will then be time enough 
 to condemn thorough tillage. J. Redmond.

Mk. Editor: — There is no heavier burthen resting 
 upon the shoulders of the farmer than fencing. Hav- 
 ing had a considerable quantity of fencing to put up 
 within the last twelve months, my attention has been 
 drawn more closely to the subject, and reflection has 
 satisfied me of the fact that it is not only one of the 
 most expensive items in farming, but that the day is 
 coming when wo shall be compelled to resort to some 
 substitute for the present mode of fenc'ng. It re- 
 quires but a moment's thought to satisfy any person 
 that our forests are rapidly disappearing, and with 
 them, the materials for rails. 

Frequent attempts to construct a durable fence 
 with wire have been made, and I have read more than 
 a dozen different articles giving directions for their 
 construction. But wherever these directions have 
 been followed, the result has been next thing to a 
 failure. We of course should not desjjair of arriving 
 at such knowledge on the subject as will enable us to 
 construct a wire fence that will be as effectual as the 
 present wooden ones, but that day maybe distant and 
 possibly never arrive. 

Hedging has strong claims upon the farmers atten 
 tion, and might unquestionably be made to answer 
 the purpose fully. The only objection to the hedge 
 is, that it requires too much attention to suit the in- 
 clinations and tastes of the generality of f\irmers. — 
 Nothing beautifies a landscape more than fine hedg- 
 es, but at the same time the labor and skill required
