to keep them in order, are greater than would be given 
 to them, and as a consequence we should soon hare 
 most unsightly aflfairs. With men of taste and per- 
 severance they would succeed admirably, but with 
 the careless farmer they would soon be worse than 
 the wire fence. In many parts of Europe, we are 
 told, that fencing has been wholly abandoned. — 
 Where large flocks or herds are kej^t, herdsmen are 
 employed to watch them, and it has been found that 
 this svstem works admirably. Xow if it is less ex- 
 pensive in Europe than the plan we are following, 
 why not adopt it here? It may be answered that the 
 great scarcity and consequent high price of fencing 
 material, compelled the Europeans to this. Admit 
 it, and we shall soon find, for the very same reasons, 
 we shall sooner or later be compelled to follow in their 
 footsteps. But as it will be wholly impracticable to 
 induce our farmers to employ herdsmen now, I would 
 suggest another plan, which my own experience jus- 
 tifies me in recommending, and which I know can be 
 profitably adopted. 

Instead of turning my cattle into pasture during 
 the summer, I keep them in my cattle yard, where 
 sheds have been erected to protect them from the 
 heat of the sun, and the rain, iScc. Twice a day, 
 morning and evening, a suificient amount of grass is 
 cut and carried into a shed, from which it is divided 
 out to the cattle. The advantages are two fold. — 
 First, a saving of pasture, as I find that a little more 
 than one half will answer the purpose, while the cat- 
 tle are in just as fine condition as when permitted to 
 run in the fields. Second, the manure is all kept to- 
 gether in the yard, and as I make it a point to have 
 it all collected every morning and thrown under a 
 shed erected for the purpose, I find immense advan- 
 tage in this particular. 

It appears to me that this plan might be adopted, 
 and by means of it obviate the necessity of at least 
 one half of the fencing now absolutely required upon 
 our farms. The expense of cutting, carting and feed- 
 ing the grass will be repaid by the smaller amount of 
 pasture required, and the great advantage of having 
 the manure during the hot months under shed, in- 
 stead of being exposed to the wasting influences of 
 8un, rain, &c. Besides this, the saving in the amount 
 of fencing is a large item. Take for instance, a farm 
 of one hundred acres, divided into fields of ten acres 
 each. No other fencing would be needed than the 
 dividing fence between neighbors. I have made a 
 rough calculation of the amount saved upon a hun- 
 dred acre farm divided as above, and find that it 
 amounts, at SI, 25 per pannel, to the handsome sum 
 of dei-en hundred and fifty dollars. This supposes 
 the fencing to be good post and rail. With this view 
 of the case and fully convinced that it is the best plan 
 that can be adopted, I have determined never to re- 
 new the fencing on my farm. So soon as it needs 
 repairs I will remove it entirely, thereby saving not 

only in the particulars already enumerated, but also 
 in the use of the land occupied by the fences, which 
 is another item of importance. 

If any of your correspondents can suggest a better 
 plan, it is to be hoped they will do it, as the suliject 
 is one of much importance. E. L. T.

Me. Editor : — I find in the Constitution of the 
 State Agricultural Society, a clause making it the du- 
 ty of the officers to furnish information in regard to 
 the agricultural condition of their own district. In 
 compliance with the above, I would say, that so far 
 as our (the 13th) district is concerned, farming is in 
 a prosperous condition. Our many large and commo- 
 dious bank barns, and comfortable dwellings, all in- 
 dicate comfort and abundance. Some portions of the 
 district are too hilly and mountainous for farming, 
 these portions however, are covered with fine timber 
 and abound in minerals. Water power to any requi- 
 red extent may be had, so that the want of adapta- 
 tion of these portions to agricultural purposes, is well 
 compensated for in these other respects. I presume 
 there are no better lands in Pennsylvania, than our 
 river bottoms and valleys. They possess many great 
 advantages, prominent among which is, the abund- 
 ance of limestone of excellent quality, and convenient 
 to almost every farm in the district. Coal is brought 
 to us at such reasonable rates, that lime can be pur- 
 chased at six cents per bushel, and much cheaper 
 where it is burned in stacks on the ground. The lat- 
 ter plan is much practised here. 

Our farmers use lime very liberally on their lands, 
 the quantity per acre varying from fifty to four hun- 
 dred bushels. The average quantity is about one hun- 
 dred bushels. 

One case in which 400 bushels were applied to the 
 acre is deserving of mention. The field was spouty, 
 and entirely too wet for cultivation. Under-draining 
 was first resorted to, after which it was plowed as 
 deep as a very large plow and four horses could do 
 it. The lime was then put on at the above rate per 
 acre, and with it ten four horse loads of stable ma- 
 nure additional. The result was, that this field which 
 was worthless before, became as productive as any 
 of our best river bottoms. 

The same person applied 300 bushels per acre on 
 a gravelly soil which previously yielded good crops. — 
 The result in this case was just the reverse of the 
 former. Foi six or eight years nothing would grow 
 upon it. It is however, improving now, and will I 
 presume ultimately realize the expectations of the 
 owner. From this, it is very apparent that some soils 
 will bear more lime than others, a fact with which 
 every farmer should be familiar, as it enables him to 
 make a judicious application of it and thus realize 
 the best returns. Lime, stable manure and clover 
 are the principal fertilizers in use in the district, al- 
 though occasionally others are used on a limited scale.
