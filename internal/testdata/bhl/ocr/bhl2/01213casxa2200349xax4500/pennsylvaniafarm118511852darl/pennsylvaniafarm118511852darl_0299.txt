 Curing of Corn I^'oddcr. 

Mr. Editor : Since the old practice of blading and 
 topping corn fur fodder bas been superseded by the 
 better one of cutting off the stalk witliin a few inch- 
 es of the ground, the value of fodder as provender 
 has claimed more attention. Much, however, remains 
 to be done to secure corn fodder so as to render it 
 most palatable to cattle. While the present practice 
 of cutting off the stalk near the ground is, for several 
 reasons preferable to the old one, there are yet some 
 objections to it, which, however, a very little care 
 ■will effectually obviate. 

The practice which now generally prevails, is to 
 cut oil" the stalks, and immediately bind them togeth- 
 er in close shocks, where they are permitted to re- 
 main until the corn is ready to be husked from them. 
 They are then drawn to the vicinity of the barn and 
 stacked for use during the winter. A writer in the 
 Maine Farmer, in a brief article condemns tl:e imme- 
 diate binding and shocking of stalks in the field, 
 urging as an objection to it, the fact that the free cir- 
 culation of air, so essential to the sweetness of the 
 fodder is prevented by it. lie contends that corn 
 fodder should bo cured by laying it on loose heaps 
 immediately after cutting, with the butts liighcr than 
 the tops. This plan causes the rain which may fall 
 W'hile the fodder is in the field, to run off, instead of 
 saturating the bladeand stalk, by penetrating between 
 them, as is the case when the stalks are placed in 
 shocks. Besides, it gives the air a chance to circu- 
 late and thus cures the fodder in the best condition. 
 There is good sense in the suggestion if we only 
 knew how to arrange the stalks so that the butts 
 would lay highest. This he proposes to do by laying 
 the butts " on the corn." If by this we are to un- 
 derstr.nd that the corn is to be pulled from the stalks 
 and thrown in heaps on the damp ground, to form a 
 resting place for the butts of the stalks until dry 
 enough to be taken to the barn or stack, the damage 
 the corn would be likely to sustain, would more than 
 outweigh the advantages to the fodder. 

Again, if the stalks are laid at full length upon the 
 ground, with the butts sufilciently raised to cause the 
 rain that may fall,to run from them, it brings a large 
 portion of the blades, whicli are the most valuable 
 part, indirect contact with the damp ground. This is 
 another objection to Sir. Burns' method, and a very 
 serious one. 

His plan of putting them when thoroughly cured 
 on the top of the hay, after it has settled, may do 
 very well, where the corn crops are small, but would 
 scarcely answer where the fodder from twenty or 
 thii-ty acres of corn is to be taken care of. The 
 question then is, how shall our fodder be secured 
 when taken from the field, so as to keep it from the 
 ruinous effects of moisture and consequently, musti- 
 ness. My plan is, to load the fodder as it is cut, 

draw it to the Ijarn floor and sheds, where such quan- 
 tities are stacked as we can find room for, and permit 
 it to remain there until the corn is fit for husking — 
 We cure the remainder by laying rails four or five 
 wide, on the ground, raising the outside one, by 
 means of blocks or stones. The butts of the stalks 
 are placed on the raised rail, which is sufficiently high 
 to cause any rain that may fall to run off from the fod- 
 der. Four or five lengths of rails, arranged in this 
 way will be sufficient for a large quantity of fodder ; 
 and the advantages of this method over that of Mr. 
 Burn's are, that the whole of the stalks arc kept 
 clear of the ground, while the air has a much better 
 chance to circulate through them. 

After the fodder is well cured, and when it is free 
 from moisture, we stack it convenient to the barn 
 yard, in the following manner : A strong platform 
 running North West and South East, is made, two 
 rail-lengths in width, raised in the middle suf5ciently 
 high to compensate for the difference in size between 
 the butt and the top of the stalk. The fodder is then 
 stacked butt outwards, care being taken to keep the 
 middle of the stack the highest. This precaution is 
 necessary if we wish to prevent the rains and melting 
 snows from running towards the centre of the stack. 
 We cap the whole with long straw, and always com- 
 mence using it at the South West end, by this means 
 pr .tecting the open end from the driving North West 
 Storms. Snow is never permitted to lay on the stack 
 and melt. By this means the fodder is cured sweet 
 and clean, and the cattle eat it as readiij- as hay.and 
 (with an occasional change,) with as^iiuch apparent 
 advantage.

Mr. Editor : — Somebody has said, 
 " The more we hoe. 
 The more we grow." 

A volume of truth in a few words. If cultivators of 
 the soil appreciated as they should the advantafes 
 of stirring the soil frequently and well, seasons of 
 drought would neither be so much dreaded or felt, 
 as they now are. During the last summer, we suf- 
 fered more from drought, than for many years pre- 
 vious. Vegetation suffered greatly, and what was 
 very unusual, there was a long spell of dry -weather 
 in almost every section of the United States. 

During the month of August, when almost every 
 green thing was wilted and drying for want of mois- 
 ture, I was much struck with the fresh appearance 
 of the vegetables in a small garden, belonging to a 
 very industrious old lady, a neighbor of mine. So 
 strong was the contrast between this garden and the 
 adjoining fields, that I one day stopped, and inquired 
 the cause, presuming of course that water had been 
 plentifully supplied to it. What was my surprise, at
