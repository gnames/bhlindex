learning that not a single drop of water had been 
 given it, but that the healthy appearance of the ve- 
 getables -was attributable solely to the regular ivork- 
 ing "which it reooiN cd. " My garden never needs any 
 water," remarked the old lady, "although my neigh- 
 bors gardens do, and the reason is a very simple one. 
 1 always keep down the weeds by hoeing the ground 
 as deep as I can without injuring my vegetables. — 
 This gives the roots a chance to spread themselves in 
 every direction, and I find where I keep the ground 
 well loosened, that it never becomes as dry, as when 
 it is permitted to remain hard and rough. This is 
 the whole secret. Your garden would be in as good 
 condition as mine if j'ou would follow the same 
 plan." 

There was truth in every word the old lady spoke. 
 Her garden showed it, and reason sanctioned it. I 
 learned an important fact, which I shall endeavor to 
 improve upon hereafter, that is, to stir the soil deeply 
 and thorovQlihj." E. Spanoler.

For the F.irm Jnurnal. 
 What will Pennsylvania farmers do without their 
 Journal ! 

You see, 5Ir. Editor, I have slightly altered the 
 caption of one of your articles in the December No. 
 of the Journal, and although I cannot subscribe my- 
 self a farmer, I am, however, what every Pennsylva- 
 nia farmer ought to be, a friend of the " Farm Jour- 
 nal ;" and to prove it, I send you a new subscriber. 
 This, I will presume to say, may be (with little exer- 
 tion) in the power of all your patrons. 

Allow me to ask one more favor of those who, with 
 myself are daily trying to bring more out of the mo- 
 ther earth, and that is to make a note of it, and send 
 it to the Journal. Your highest estimate does not 
 half approximate to the amount of benefit you will 
 confer to the State, by the diifusion of sound practi- 
 cal intelligence on the cultivation of the soil — the 
 rearing and feeding of stock — the right sort of imple- 
 ments to use, and how to use them — the best seed, 
 the most beneficial manner, (regarding cost) and the 
 quantity of produce from the acre. IMy good sir, it 
 is a fact, that ten acres well worked, manured and 
 cropped will produce as much as thirty (I was going 
 to say fifty) under the ordinary culture, and cost less 
 labor in hay time and harvest. No standard short 
 of three tons of hay — thirty-five bushels of wheat — 
 eighty bushels of corn — with four to six hundred 
 bushels of carrots, parsnips and mangold wurtzels — 
 and six to eight hundred bushels of turnips, per acre, 
 should satisfy us. Ouly think, $200 per acre for car- 
 rots and turnips in the Philadelphia market, and a 
 market at the door. It is many years since I was 
 favorably impressed with the benefits of subsoil 
 plowing, but the past season put a climax on all my 
 former experience. Land that was subsoiled was 
 more moist, the crops of a better color, and more lux- 

uriant, so much so, that I have determined to double 
 plow ten or more acres of my land every year. Ko 
 time to be lost with the farmer, horses to feed and la- 
 bor to pay. R. BniST.

For the Farm Journal, 
 Influence ot the Moon. 

Dear Sir: It has been written that Error is in all 
 eases, a worse enemy to Science than Ignorance — and 
 as your Journal justly claims to be an advocate of 
 Truth and Knowledge, you will indulge me in a few 
 brief hits, at one of the most obviovs popular delu- 
 sions of the times. I would scarcely arrogate to my- 
 self the right to assail any but such as arc too egre- 
 gious and transparent, to bear di oussion. 

It was once almost universally believed, and still 
 credited by many, that the Moon, not content with 
 her proper and pre-ordered functions keeps watch up- 
 on the Earth, for the purpose of regulating the growth 
 of cabbage and other matter of equal oreven greater 
 importance. These things, she is supposed to effect 
 by her changes. 

As mere sciolists, standing at the threshold of the 
 Temple, let us humbly inquire what these changes 
 are. It is taught by the vast science of astronomy, 
 that since the first dawn of creation, the Moon has 
 never changed ; that she has looked down on the tran- 
 sient and varying fortunes of mankind, with the 
 same unpitying face "since the morning stars first 
 sang together for joy." No man ever has seen, and 
 no man ever shall see, but one half of her surface, — 
 and that forever the same half. Thus she rolls on, in 
 her boundless pathway, equidistant, undiminished 
 and unchangeable. 

But she does change, eays the untutored observer 
 of the Heavens. Sometimes she is full — sometimes 
 half — sometimes quarter, and sometimes, not at all. 
 No, Sir ! She is always, and ever shall be, till the 
 Power that created, shall uncreate. Though the 
 Moon presents always the same face to the Earth, 
 she permits the Sun to shine on every side of her, by 
 turns. And as the Sun can illumine but one half at 
 a time, it follows that we do not always behold the 
 " lighted" portion of her, or the whole of it. This 
 makes the apparent difference in her surface. Yet 
 she is all there, and forever full, to him who could 
 choose the point of his observations. 

We hear men of sense, and occasionally learned 
 men, speak of the next change of Moon, and proph- 
 ecy " a spell of weather " or something else, as a 
 consequence. When does it change ? (I allude to its 
 apparent mutations.) Does it jump suddenly from one 
 quarter to another ? Or does it vary as much one in- 
 stant as another, gradually, constantly, and eternal- 
 ly ;' Most undoubtedly the latter. Then how can 
 its variations affect the weather — the garden-truck — 
 the fence-rails — the shingles on the roof — the manure 
 on the grass — the apples in the cellar — the dinner in
