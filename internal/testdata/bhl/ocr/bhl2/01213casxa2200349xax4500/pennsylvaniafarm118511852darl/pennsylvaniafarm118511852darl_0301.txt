the poi, and multifarious other little things, more 
 yesterday than to-morrow ? Once upon a time, a cho- 
 leric old fellow, who had stimulated his organ of 
 combativeness, by imbibing something sti'ongev than 
 moon-sliiiic, called the subscriber both a fool and a 
 rascal for attemp'ingto disprove to him the infallibil- 
 ty of these signs. As this mofle of argument is cal- 
 culated to lead to still greater differences of opinion, 
 it may be properly set down as one of the troubles to be 
 contended with, in confuting these delusions — partic- 
 ularly as the disciples of Falsehood are generally 
 both pertinacious and pugnacious. Another trouble 
 is, a believer in signs is always satisfied, if they hold 
 good once in two or three times, whereas, there should 
 be no variations, if they be, in reality, laws of Nature. 
 For laws of Nature are imperative and inevitable, 
 and wiiosoever outrages any one of them shall suffer 
 the penalty prc-ordered by the Great Creator. Yet 
 these laws of moonshine are verified or fail, alter- 
 nately. They could not reasonably be expected to 
 fail oftener. 

But says the man of signs, the MoBn affects the 
 tides, and therefore it must influence t^^.Sooliing of 
 my pork and sour-crout. This is the sort of logic, 
 that establishes the all pervading power of Luna, 
 over meat-tubs, crout-barrols and cream-pots. Be- 
 cause Dr. Quack-Donkey's JIagical Pain Extractor 
 will draw a bile to a head, it docs not necessarily 
 follow that it can draw a load of wood, equal to a yoke 
 of oxen — yet the one sequence is about as rational 
 as the other. By a great natural law, called gravi- 
 tation, the Moon and Sun attract the waters of the 
 earth in different a degree, according to their 
 positions, with a certainty, that wuuld admit perhaps 
 of mathemetical calculation for millions of ages into 
 the Future. And with equal certainty and precis- 
 s;on would every other real influence be felt. 

Two years ago I hired a man to gather apples. — 
 He very gravely assured me, they v.'ould rot in a 
 short time, if taken then, because it was the wrong 
 sign. I r3qucste<l him to proceed with his work as 
 diligently as possible, that the apples might all be 
 picked, before the sign came right. In spite of my 
 skeptical audacity,they lasted longer and better than 
 I ever knew them to last before. What a most 
 incontrovertible proof of the sign, if somebody else 
 had gathered their apples at the same time, and lost 
 them ! 

If a certain quailer must produce rain or snow, or 
 clear weather, as an unavoidable result, why does 
 not one sort of weather pervade the whole eai'th, at 
 • jtfee same time? For certa'nly at the same instant, a 
 sign of the Jloon will prevail equally in Terra del 
 Fuego, and in Kamschatka, in Greenland and in 
 Borneo. And as these quarters must occur within 
 seven days of each other, "no spell of weather" 
 can commence more than three and a half days from 

any change. And I know, Sir, believers are willing 
 to conclude even greater variations. 

When we reflect that the Globe we inhabit is but 
 an atom — a (jrain of dust in the stupendous systems 
 of which it is a portion, we shall be forced to believe, 
 that the vast and infinite worlds, that surround us, 
 have more important functions, than the control of 
 the humble destinies of Earth and her feeble child- 
 ren. 

I trust, Mr. Editor, this short imper|fect article 
 will bring out some more practised and skilful pen 
 to the support of Truth. There is no error too ab- 
 surd to be combatted, nor too insignificant to be 
 overthrown. Truly yours,

Indellible Ixk roK markixg labels for trees, 
 SHRUBS AXD FLOWERS. — Mf. Editor: — I am so much 
 pleased with an article of ink for writing on zinc, 
 made by Mr. IIenrt H. Kellet, No. 288, N. 2d st., 
 Philadelphia, that I am induced to inform you of it, 
 that you might publish itfor the benefit of your readers. 

It is a black ink, writes beautifully on zinc, and 
 will bear exposure to the weather for many years. 

It can be obtained of Mr. Kelley, at §1,00 per pint. 

I know oi no method of labeling trees so econom- 
 ical as to cut small cards of zinc, mark them with this 
 ink, and attach them to trees by a loop of copper wire.

 Seed Potatoes, 

Mr. Editor: — Now is the time to select and look 
 over ycur seed potatoes. Spread them out thin on 
 the cellar floor, turn them frequently, do not allow 
 them to sprout, the frequent turnings prevent it and 
 reserves the energies of the tuber to make a healthful 
 growth as soon as it is deposited in its destination in 
 the soil. Tills is no theory. It is a solid practical 
 fact for every gardener and f^irmer.

Partridges and Weeds. 

Mr. Editor: — Do you not think the destruction of 
 Partridges, one of the most prolific sources of weeds? 
 It is well known that these birds are granivorous, and 
 that when their favorite food becomes sc;irci\ they 
 readily eat the seeds of many of the plants that are 
 exceedingly troublesome to farmers. How many days 
 of hard labor are required on farms generally, to de- 
 stroy the weeds which spring from seeds that would 
 have been eaten by Partridges, had gunners not been 
 permitted to destroy them ? Birds of all kinds are 
 friends of the farmer and deserve his protection, arid 
 the farmer who permits them to be destrnyeil should 
 not complain if his fruits are wormy. A\ is.
