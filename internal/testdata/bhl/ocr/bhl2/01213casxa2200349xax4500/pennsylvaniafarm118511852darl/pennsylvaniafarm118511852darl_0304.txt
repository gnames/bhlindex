of a " greater size and richer quality." Ah, indeed ! 
 Is it so remarkable that large hens, housed and nursed 
 ■with care commensurate with price, fed abundantly, 
 •wit.1 the best of food, even wheat occasionally, should 
 produce large eggs ? Do not the quality of the flesh 
 of animals and their secretions, as well as the eggs 
 and flesh of birds depend upon their food ? Does not 
 the Vallimeria spiralis, give the desiralile flavor to 
 the flesh of the cauvassback duck ? "Who has not 
 early in spring, when other green food is scarce, per- 
 ceived the flavor of garlic in eggs, as well as the milk 
 and butter of cows, and indeed beef? 

Does not chemistry teach, that no new elements 
 are formed in the animal? If so, then of course the 
 quality of the egg will depend upon the food and the 

health of the individual properly to elaborate it. — 
 Depend upon it, quality and quantity of eggs depend 
 more upon quantity and quality of food than is dream- 
 ed of in 's philosophy. 

The only benefit, therefore, which can result from 
 this chicken speculation, will be more careful obacr- 
 servation with regard to productiveness, and desira- 
 bleness of form, in particular individuals, and their 
 preservation lor breeding. 

By this course we maj', my word for it, have very 
 good proliflc chickens of different colored mongrels,

THE MALAY FOWL— SOMETIMES (tuough erroneoos'lt) CALLED CHITTAGONG 

THE MALAY FOWL. 

This is a majestic bird, and is found on the Penin- 
 sula from which it derives its name. Its weight, in 
 general, exceeds that of the Cochin China, the male 
 weighing, when full grown, from eleven to twelve, or 
 even tliirteen pounds, and the female from eight to 
 ten pounds; — height, from twenty-six to twenty-eight 
 inches. They present no striking uniformity of p u- 
 mage, being of all shades, from black to white ; the 
 more common color of the female is a light reddish- 
 yellow, and I have observed a mere suspicion of dun- 
 nish-bhie, especially in *he tail. The Cock is frequently 
 of ft ycllowish-red'color, with black intermingled in 
 the breast, thighs, and tail. Ua has a small, but thick 
 comb, as seen in the portrait, generally inclined to one 
 gide ; he should be snake-headed, and free from the 
 slightest trace of top-knot ; the wattles should be ex- 
 tremely small, even in an old bird; the legs are not 
 feathered, as in the case of the Shanghaes, but, like 
 tliem and the Cochin Chinas, his tail is small compa- 
 red with his size. In the female, there is scarcely any 
 show of comb or wattles. Tlieir legs are long and 

stout ; and their flesh is very well flavore ', wlien they 
 have been properly fattened ; and their Eggs are so 
 largo and rich, that two of them are equal to three 
 of those of our ordinary Fowls. The Malay Cock, in 
 his perfection, is a remarkably courageous and strong 
 bird. I lis beak is remarkably tliick, and he is a for- 
 midable antagonist when oifended. His crow is loud, 
 harsh, not prolonged, as in the case of the Cochin 
 China, but broken off' abruptly at^ the termination ; 
 this is quite characteristic of the bird. 

CHITTAGONG FOWL. 
 In and around Philadelphia, we have a large Fowl, 
 to which the above name has been incorrectly given, 
 as, on further acquaintance, it has proved to be a mon- 
 grel, and, like most mongrels, comparatively worth- 
 less. Until within a short time, it went under various 
 names, as Ostrich Fowl, the Turkey breed, the Big 
 breed, tl o Booby, the Bucks County Fowl, and even 
 the Malay. It is difficult to trace its history. Som« 
 forty years ago, several large Fowls werelirought hith- 
 er from different parts of China, the Eait Indies, and
