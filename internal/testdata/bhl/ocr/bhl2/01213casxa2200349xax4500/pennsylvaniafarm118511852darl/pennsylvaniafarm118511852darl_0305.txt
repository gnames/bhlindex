MR. D. TAGGART'S CHITTAGONG FOWLS. 

the adjacent isles ; subsequently and within a few 
 years, ethers were added. These all, except in a few 
 cases, have been mixed, and breed indiscriminately : 
 and the result is tlie Fowl to which, according to the 
 people, the above names have been applied. It is of all 
 colors, from black to white, frecjuently speckled, some- 
 times red and black, and again dun. When bred, it 
 will generally produce its like in point of size, but 
 rarely in point of colour, showing it, unquestionably, 
 to be a mixture of several original breeds. They are 
 not very good layers, though their Eggs are very 
 large and rich. Their legs are sometimes lightly 
 feathered, not always, and vary in colour from yellow 
 to a dark or bluish hue. I once had a Ptdld of this 
 kind which weighed eleven and a quarter pounds; the 
 uaual weight for full grown males, is from ten pounds 
 and|a half to twelve pounds ; females, from eight to 
 ten pounds. They are generally (juite leggy, stand- 
 ing some twenty six inches high, and the Hens twenty 
 two inches. A first cross with the Shanghae would 
 make a ret-y large and valuable bird for the table, not 
 for breeding from. 

Mr. Taggart, of Northumberland, Pa., is disposed 
 to think favorably of some Chittagongs he received 
 from me, with a pair of Shanghaes. They are all yet 
 quite young. He says : 

" Of all large breeds, it strikes me the Chittagongs 
 are most prolific. My Brown Pullet began to lay on 
 the lOtli of October, when not much over five months 
 old. In twenty two days she laid eighteen Eggs, (or, 
 I may say nineteen, for one was double,) and then 
 began to sit. Iler laying was after this fashion; 3, 3, 
 4, 3, 5. No doubt 1 could have kept her at it, by 
 changing her nest from time. Itisextraordinary that 
 a Pullet of her age should lay so fast at this time of 
 year. After incubating a week, she grew very sick, 
 and I was forced to break her Eggs and take her off. 
 When she began to lay she weighed six and three- 
 quarter pounds, now only five pounds. But she is 
 recovering." 

[We are indebted to D. Taggart, Esq., of Northum- 
 berland, for a pair of his Chittagongs. We do not 
 know their precise age, but from their appearance, 
 presume they are not more than six months old. — 
 The cock is a fine looking bird, very large and well 
 formed. The pullet we think equals in form ' ' any 
 of our best Shanghaes. In point of size she exceeds 
 them, and her laying qualities equals theirs, with this 
 in favor of her eggs, that they are much larger. M'e 
 propose testing the comparative value of the two 
 breeds, by giving both the same food and lodging. — • 
 Mr. T. has our best thanks for the fowls. — Ed.]
