 Evergreen Trees and Shrubs, No. 4. 

Many of the new Evergreens of recent introduc- 
 tion into the United States are yet of so small a size 
 as to give but little chance to judge of their habits 
 and future value in the aboretum. New species are 
 being rapidly brought into notice, and a disposition 
 seems to exist among foreign nurserymen, to multiply 
 mere varieties, founded upon exceedingly slight differ- 
 ences, and only serving to add to our already burden- 
 ed catalogues. Excepting where, as a matter of cu- 
 riosity and reference, the object is to make a complete 
 collection, many of these varieties may readily be 
 dispensed with. We shall notice such, as among our 
 own importations, we have observed to offer sumo stri- 
 king characteristics and will probably prove decided 
 acquisitions. 

Taxodiwm Sempervirens is one of the new discov- 
 eries from California, and from accounts of it in its 
 native wilds, may f;\irly be placed at the head of all 
 coniferous Trees. It has been found of the almost 
 incredible heighth of 300 feet, and measuring 55 
 feet in circumference at G feet from the ground. Even 
 in dense forests it has been found to average 200 feet. 
 The bark is represented as exceeding thick, 6 to 12 
 inches. The timber is of a beautiful rod color, close 
 grained and light, and is exceedingly valuable â€” largo 
 quantities being exported. It is called by the Amer- 
 ican settlers red wood or bastard cedar. Specimens 
 of this tree may be obtained at the nurseries,2to 3 ft. 
 high, but wc do not know that it has yet been tested 

through the winter in the open ground. It is greatly 
 to be hoped it may prove hardy. The f. liage is of a 
 dark rich green, and its growth and habit quite dis- 
 tinct. 

Abies Morinda or Himalayan Spruce is a very 
 beautiful tree from the Himalayan Mountains, which 
 we have tested in open ground, and found to be per- 
 fectly hardy. It resembles the Norway Spruce in 
 its foliage and wood, but comes more up to the pros" 
 ent fashionable standard, in Arooping at all stages 
 its growth. It will probably attain in our climate a 
 heighth of GO or more feet. 

Picea Pinsapo or Mount Atlas Cedar, is also per- 
 fectly hardy here, and so far as one can judge from 
 specimens about 18 inches high, promises to be equal 
 in beauty to any other. It has attracted considerable 
 attention in our grounds the past season. The leaves 
 are very dark and sharp pointed, and grow all around 
 the branches. The new growth at the extremities 
 differs in the colour and length of the leaves, and in 
 general appearance from that of the preceding yeax, 
 making it altogether unique. Its growth would ap- 
 pear to be slow, with branches thickly set, and of up- 
 right habit. In its native place it reaches a height 
 from 60 to 70 feet. We think this tree will prove a 
 great favorite with the public. 

Abies Douglasii or Douglass' Spruce, from the 
 north west coast of America, is one of the largest 
 trees known in the world, growing to the height of 
 150 to 200 feet. A stump was found at Fort George, 
 near the mouth of the Oregon, (150 feet without 
 branches, still remains,) which measured 48 feet in 
 circumference, 3 feet from the ground. The habit 
 of this tree is conical and erect, the leaves narrow 
 and dark green above, silvery beneath. There arc 
 no specimens yet to be obtained in the United States 
 but a few inches high. 

Cupressus Tondosa or Twisted Cypress, is a spe- 
 cies from the Himalayan Mountains, perfectly hardy 
 here, graceful and beautiful. It is found in the Nepal 
 ranges at an altitude of about 8000 feet, and about 
 40 feet high, pyramidal in shape, with numerous flex- 
 ible branches. Its wood is fragrant and burned by 
 the natives as incense wood. This tree has developed 
 sufficiently in growth and habits here, to prove it 
 a decided acquisition. Its foliage is light green. 

Juidpei'us Excelsa, Fall Juniper is found in about 
 the same ranges as the preceding, and is equally 
 hardy, and also whole forests of it in the Islands of 
 the Grecian Archipelago. Its height is about 30 feet. 
 Out of fifteen species of Junipers we have growing, 
 we consider the Excelsa the most beautiful. Its habit 
 is strictly erect and pyramidal, very regular in its out- 
 line, with foliage of light green colour and very glos- 
 sy. Juniperus is a prolific genus, thirty seven species 
 being enumerated in our foreign catalogues. 

Picea Grandis, and Picea Nohilis, are two of the 
 invaluable acquisitions from California and Oregon
