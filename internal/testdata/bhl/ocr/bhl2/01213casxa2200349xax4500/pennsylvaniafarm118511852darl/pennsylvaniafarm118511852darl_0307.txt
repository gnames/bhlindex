for which we are indebted to the enterprise of Doug- 
 lass, their first discoverer. Neither of them are yet 
 to be obtained in the U. S. but a few inches high. — 
 They are doubtless perfectly hardy here. Picea no- 
 bilis, was found by hira near the cataracts of the Co- 
 lumbia in extensive forests, and is described in En-; 
 thusiastic terms "as combining in itself all that is ma- 
 jestic in form and stature, beautiful in outline and 
 majestic in proportion. Attaining in its native 
 forests the stupendous height of 180 feet, it throws 
 off at equal intervals its horizontal branches in whorls 
 of such uniform order and arrangement, that each 
 gories forms a beautiful dense circular platform of 
 the deepest verdure, liroader at the base, and gradu- 
 ally narrowing their radius as they ascend. Neither 
 is there the least approach to stiffness in this unifor" 
 mity. On the contrary from the fine incurvature,! 
 both of the dense foliage and the lateral shoots, impart" 
 ing a feather like softness to the branches, the entire 
 tree is invested with a grace to which no description 
 can do justice." 

Picea Grandis was found by him in great luxuri- 
 ance in the humid valleys of northern California, 
 attaining there the height of 170 to 200 feet, and is 
 conspicuous no less for its great stature, than the rich 
 bright verdure of its foliage." It is not so valuable 
 as a timber tree. Paschall Morris.

Lancaster County Agricultural Societt. — The 
 regular annual meeting of this society will be held 
 at the Mechanics' Institute, on Tuesday, January 
 13th, at 10 o'clock, A. M., at which time various bu" 
 siness matters of great importance will claim the at' 
 tention of the members. In the afternoon, the an- 
 nual address will be delivered by James Gowen, Esq. 
 of Philadelphia county. The readers of the Journal 
 are familiar with the high practical character of Mr. 
 G's. writings, and we trust that he will be welcomed 
 by a large audience. We are requested distinctly to 
 state, that all are invited 1o be present, whether 
 members of the society or not. With the feeling 
 that at present animates the ftxrmers of this great 
 county, the meeting above mentioned should not onlv 
 be a full one, but it should be the occasion on which 
 the future prosperity of the society should be estab- 
 lished beyond the contingency of a doubt. 

The Model Architect No. 5, has been received. We 
 are glad to observe that each succeeding number gives 
 marked evidence of improvement upon the last. The 
 designs are not only well conceived, but beautifully 
 executed, and the specifications, &c., accompanying 
 them are fuU and complete. The present number 
 contains a representation of a villa in the Norman 
 style of architecture, giving not only full front, side 
 and rear view, but also a very large number of litho- 
 graphs illustrating the details of the building. We 
 again commenl this valuable work to the attention 
 of our readers.

Our January Number. — We ofier no apology for 
 calling attention to the character of the present num- 
 ber of our Journal. In answer to our request to con- 
 tributors, a number of excellent communications have 
 been received, the value of which -w ill be understood 
 by every reader. Why can we not have such num- 
 bers for all time to come ? We trust an appeal to 
 those who have been in the habit of corresponding 
 for agricultural publications, as well as to those who 
 have not, will receive attention, and induce every friend 
 of agriculture to put his hand to the work. 

Almost every day we meet with farmers who have 
 had the advantages of many years practical exper!- 
 encef, and yet, who, in answer to our repeated requests 
 to communicate a small portion of that experience 
 for the benefit of our readers reply, "AVe will, so 
 soon as anything occurs worth publishing." Many 
 of these requests are made of men, who have been till- 
 ing the soil for twenty or thirty and even fifty years. 
 Can it be possible that they have been engaged in 
 agricultural pursuits for so long a time and not learn- 
 ed something worth communicating for the benefit of 
 their fellows. Wo met one of this kind a few days 
 since, a most excellent practical farmer. The usual 
 reply, " I know nothing worth writing about," was 
 given, and yet, before ten minutes had elapsed, he 
 gave us, in conversation, the results of several highly
