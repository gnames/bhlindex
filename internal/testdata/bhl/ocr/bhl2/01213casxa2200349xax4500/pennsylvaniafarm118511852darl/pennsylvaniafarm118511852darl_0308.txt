interesting experiments. Sitting at our desk while 
 he was relating them, we took notes as he went along 
 and when ho left our office, put the notes in the form 
 of a communication. He returned shortly afterwards 
 and was not a little surprised to find that one of his 
 experiments formed the basis of one of the best prac- 
 tical articles in our present number, and he left us 
 far better satisfied than when he entered our office. 
 He felt that he had done something which might be 
 valuable to others. The ice was broken, and we have 
 not a doubt that this little incident will be the means 
 of calling out other facts equally valuable. Are there 
 not thousands and tens of thousands such in Pennsyl- 
 vania ? There are, and they are wanting in duty to 
 themselves, and those who are to succeed them, if 
 they permit valuable truths to die with themselves. 
 " Believe that you can do a thing, and it is half done 
 already," was a favorite saying with one who was 
 never known to fail in any thing he undertook. We 
 say to those who hesitate abeut writing for the Jour- 
 nal, believe that you can do it, if you don't succeed, 
 it will then be time enough to say you cannot. 

enable him to do fair work with it, and thus impose 
 upon th^ judgment of the committee. Diiferent 
 plowmen should hold them in different soils, and to 
 the plow most easily managed and performing the 
 best work, should be awarded the first premium. 

In speaking thus, we design, no reflections upon 
 the decisi ns of the Committee at the Sate Fair Plow- 
 ing Match, for we believe they were made with strict 
 reference to the merits of the different plows. The 
 high character of the gentlemen composing that com- 
 mittee was a sufficient guarantee that their decisions 
 would be made in accorda ice with the strictest prin- 
 ciples of justice to the contending parties. We ad- 
 vert to the suljject, merely for the purpose of calling 
 attention to it, with the hope that it will be deemed 
 sufficiently important to call forth at the next State 
 fair, a new set of regulations in which more time and 
 better opportunity will be afforded the committee to 
 make their decisions and a fair chance to the different 
 manufacturers to exhibit the commendable points of 
 their implements. 

The first premium v\ as awarded to Jesse Pawling 
 of Montgomery county. At several plowing matcliea 
 we attended during the fall, we were favorably im- 
 pressed in regard to the Pawling's Plow. The ease 
 with which it was operated, the apparent lightness 
 of drafl, and the character of tlie work performed 
 by i^ were all in its favor. It is a centre draft, and 
 constructed upon nearly the same principles as Prout- 
 ty's. It does not appear to be well adapted to heavy 
 or stiff soils, but having never seen it tested in such, 
 it would be unfair to give an opinion concerning it 
 in this particular. 

The second premium was awarded to Geo. Brindle 
 of Cumberland county. We have no recollection of 
 a plough having Mr. Brindle's name as maker. Our 
 impression was, that the second premium was award- 
 ed to Plank's Cutter Plow, made in the same county. 
 If we are mistaken, we will cheerfully correct the 
 error. The first premium in duplicate, was awarded 
 by the Committee on Implements, before trial, to 
 Prouty & Mears, No. SJ, and to Plank's Cutter Plow, 
 No. 57, and we may have gleaned our impressions 
 from this fact. 

Proiity & Mear's No. 5i was awarded the third 
 premium. This plow has acquired a celebrity which 
 renders an extended notice by us unnecessary. In 
 many sections of the country it is considered the 
 ne 2Ji'us ultra of plows, and for adaptation to light 
 soils, we think it an admirable implement. Whether 
 it will compare in lightness of draft with Pawling's 
 we had no opportunity of ascertaining; but if the 
 condition of the teams may be regarded as a criteri- 
 rion, the odds were evidently in favor of Pawling's. 

The fourth premium was taken by Jonathan F. 
 Garrard of Allegheny county, for his Sod plow,No.Il, 
 Our attention having been drawn to this plow before 

The State Fairâ€” The Plowing Match. 

We could not but regret that the great variety of 
 plows entered and the necessarily limited time allowed 
 for trial, prevented us from examining as minutely 
 as we desired and intended, the character of the work 
 performed 1 ly each. There may be those whose supe- 
 rior judgment, and perfect familiarity with the imple- 
 ment, enables them to pronounce upon the merits of a 
 plow at first view. We confess that we are none of 
 these; and therefore require a sight of the plow when 
 at work, in order to judge of its merits. Neither is 
 the turning of half a dozen furrows in soil of the 
 same character, a conclusive criterion by which to 
 judge of the value or worthlessness of a plow. Some 
 plows from their peculiar construction are best adap- 
 ted to light soils, others, to stiff heavy ones, and 
 therefore, to decide upon the merits of the two, from 
 a trial in soil of the same character is manifestly un- 
 fair to one or the other. Again, however competent 
 the gentlemen who compose a ploughing committee, 
 it appears to us utterly impossible for them to de- 
 cide properly upon the value of four or five out of 
 twenty ploughs, when the regulations are such as 
 usually govern ploughing matches, viz ; compelling 
 all the plowmen to start their teams at the same mo- 
 ment and complete the amount of work alloted to be 
 done, within an honr. An hour we should think lit- 
 tle time enough for the trial of a single plow, much 
 loss twenty, and as the agricultural community is 
 looking for an implement best adapted to general 
 use, it would seem next to impossible, to decide up- 
 on its character in this respect, when the trial of it 
 is confined to only one kind of soil. It should be 
 tried in different kinds of soil, and by different plow- 
 men. The skill which a man may acquire in the 
 use of a very inferior implement, may be such as to and during trial, we were not disappointed in the
