 the crowd of visitors. 

" Admitting, as we do, the importance of these con- 
 siderations, -we are still not prepared to give them as 
 much weight as some do ; and when compared with 
 the arguments on the other side, they have but little 
 weight on our mind. 

" And first, it should be borne in mind that the ob- 
 ject of the State Board, and the State Fatrs, is to ben- 
 efit the State at large — not one particular portion. — 
 Now it is easy to see that a Fair held in any one 
 place, is very little benefit to the farmers generally, 
 except those residing within 50 or 60 miles around. 
 It is true that a few of the more wealthy and enter- 
 prising will attend from more distant parts, but it is 
 only the very fen\ while the mass, and those who 
 most need the stimulus to improvement which such 
 Fairs afford, are not reached or benefitted, because 
 they have not the means or disposition to attend.- — 
 The same is true in regard to mechanics, though not 
 quite to the same degree. This argument alone is, to 
 our mind, of suflicient weight to counterbalance all 
 those on the other side. 

" Again, it is not only important that the people of 
 all parts of the State should be able to witness these 
 Fairs, but also that they should all have opportunity 
 to exhibit their most approved stock, implements, 
 manufactures and productions ; and who that has 
 attended such exhibitions, does not know that nearly 
 all the agricultural part of the show comes in from 
 not over 50 miles around ? Very few farmers are 
 willing to drive or transport catttle, sheep, swine, &c., 
 for such purposes, even though they attend the Fair 
 themselves. Hence if we desire to see and compare 
 the fiirm stock and productions of the State at large, 
 it must be done by holding the Fairs alternately in 
 diflferent parts of the State. 

" Lastly, there is every reason to suppose, that these 
 Fairs, would in a very few years become " an old 
 story," lose their interest and fail of success, if held 
 each year in the same location, where the same grounds 
 and arrangements would meet the eye, and generally, 
 the same people, animals, machinery, productions, 
 &c., or so nearly the same, that all the novelty and 
 zest of the occasion would be lost, and even the offi- 
 cers and citizens who now contribute funds, and labor 
 so cheerfully and efficiently at a Fair without fee or 
 reward, would soon feel it to be sore drudgery, or a 
 tax which would only be borne by those who expect- 
 ed to be directly benefitted in return. 

" In view of these considerations and they are the 
 same that have always been acted upon by the New 
 York State Society — we believe that once in three to 
 five years it as often as the State Fair should be held 
 at any one place ; though, of course, a central local- 
 ty might very properly be chosen somewhat oftencr 
 than any other. In this way we believe Fairs would 
 conduce to the greatest good of the greatest number, 

and would continue to do so for the longest time. — 
 But if any of our readers think otherwise, and will 
 point out the defects in our arguments, we will cheer- 
 fully give them space in our columns.

TnE following books have been laid on our table. — 
 Want of space compels us to delay a more extended 
 notice of them until our next : The United States, its 
 power and Progress, Mrs. Bliss' Practical Receipt 
 Book, from Lippinoott, Grambo & Co., Philadelphia. 
 Catechism of Familiar Things, Mathias' Legislative 
 Manual, Agriculture in Schools, and Schcnck's Prac- 
 tical Gardener, from Lindsay & Blakiston, Philadel-

 Arithmetic, Class Book of Prose and Poetry, and 
 Greenleaf's Primary Arithmetic, from R. S. Davis cic 
 Co., Boston. 

Webster's Dictionary, Unabridged. — Every man 
 should have a Standard Dictionary of his own lan- 
 guage, always at hand — a dictionary to which he 
 can refer with perfect confidence. Every scholar 
 knows the value of such a work, and every farmer 
 should know it. Those who have never been the po- 
 sessors of a work like Webster's, cannot conceive the 
 many benefits derived from it. To the general read- 
 er, it is not only of inestimable value, but absolute- 
 ly essential. There are few so well versed in the 
 English language, that they do not occasionally meet 
 with words, the precise meaning of which is strange 
 to them, and the want of a good dictionarj-, to which 
 to refer with the certainty of finding a satisfactory 
 definition, is not only felt at the moment, but its ef- 
 fects are plainly apparent in the thousands of s\i- 
 perficial readers met with at almost every point — 
 readers, who, having no reliable authority to consult, 
 are content to pass over words and remain in igno- 
 rance of the meaning. Such authority is Webster's 
 great Dictionary — a work that has stamped a high 
 character upon our literature, and which every 
 American should feel proud to regard with ardent 
 enthusiasm as one of its noblest monuments. We 
 have used it for a number of years, and would rath- 
 part with every volume on our shelves than it. To 
 those of our readers who have not secured a copy, 
 we would say, do not hesitate between it and others. 
 There is no other dictionary so complete and compre- 
 hensive, and consequently no other so valuable. See 
 advertisement on last page of cover. 

The Snow Flake, a Christmas, New Year and Birth 
 Day Gift, for 1852. E. H. Butler & Co., Philada. 
 The reputation the Messrs. Butler have for years 
 sustained as publishers of elegant annuals, is well 
 supported in the beautiful book before us. The illus- 
 trations are, we think, superior to those of former 
 volumes, while the contents are fully equal in jioint 
 of merit. The favor the Snow Flake has received
