The Iris, an Illuminated Souvenir for 1851. Edited 
 by John S. Hart, L. L. D., Philadelphia. Lippin- 
 cott, Grambo & Co. 

This beautiful Annual is unquestionably one of the 
 most elegant ever issued from the American Press, 
 and the enterprising publishers have surpassed them- 
 selves in the number and gorgeousness of the illus- 
 trations and the neatness of the typography. The 
 designs -which are entirely original, are printed in 
 colors in Duvall's best style, and so happily has the 
 artist succeeded, that they resemlile paintings rather 
 than prints. The whole of this superb volume is de- 
 signed to illustrate one of the most interesting depart- 
 ments of American history — Indian life ; the literary 
 portion being a collection of legends and traditions 
 woven into tales and poems by a number of distin- 
 guished writers, and the illustrations from a series 
 of original drawings of some of the most striking and 
 remarkable objects connected with these legends and 
 traditions, furnished by Captain Eastman. " The 
 Iris" is American both as to subjects and authorship, 
 and as such commends itself to those who desire the 
 progress of literature and the fine arts in our coun- 
 try. We know of no more chaste or elegant presen- 
 tation book, as it deservedly ranks amongst the first 
 of American Annuals. 

The Dew Prop, a fribiife of affection. Philadelphia. 
 Lippinoott, Grambo & Co. 

A handsome volume, displaying excellent taste both 
 in the character of its literary matter and illustration. 
 The engravings, nine in number, are on steel and 
 possess much beauty, and the contributions to its pa- 
 ges are from some of our very best writers, and have 
 been selected with the design of giving the book a 
 character suited to its name. The Dew Drop is a 
 new candidate for public favor, and one wcU calcula- 
 ted to deserve and merit it. 

The Star of Bethlehem, or Stories for Christmas. 
 Philadelphia. Lindsay & Blakiston. 

This is a very elegant little volume, designed as a 
 Christmas present for the young. Its appearance at 
 once commends it to favor, and as the contents are in 
 keeping with its title, it furnishes a most appropriate 
 present for those whose minds should always be train- 
 ed to the contemplation of subjects at once calculated 
 to gratify and benefit. The illustrations, six in num- 
 ber, are very beautiful, and its general appearance 
 highly creditable to the publishers. 

The Monthlies. — Graham's MagazineioT 3 a,nuaxy 
 is a gem in all that relates to that particular class of 
 literature to which it is devoted. The illustrations 
 are numerous and beautiful, and if the number be- 
 fore us is to be regarded as a criterion by which those 
 remaining to complete the volume are to be judged, 
 it will require active energy on the part of its rivals 
 to equal them. Terms §3 per annum.

 guished cotemporary Graham, hie hold upon the good 
 will of the community at large is a strong one. — 
 Terms -53 per annum.
