IMPORTANT TO FARMERS. 

JESSE ROBERT'S PATENT UNITED STATES 
 GRAIN AND SEED FAN. 

TO wniCU WAS AWARDED THE 

FIRST PREMIUM 

At the Pennsylvania Agricultural Fair, after atrial the fairness of 
 which eoutd not be disputed. These Kans, the iiiventur confident- 
 ly asserts, arethe only ones now ill use entirely adequate to the 
 wants of the farmer. The object of the inventor was not directed 
 alone, to ihe purpose of cleaning grain, but of cleaning it and 
 saving at the same time the farmer the trouble of gathering it 
 from the flonr, thus iu)t ouly avoiding labor, but keeping tlie grain 
 from the dirt on the floor. In addition to this, these Fans, possess 
 greatiT advantages than those constructed upon the old plan. — 
 These advantages are as follows : 

First. The arrangement is such, that a quick shake can be ob- 
 tained bv turning slowly, thus securing when desired, a less quan- 
 tity of for small seeds. 

Second. When necessary a slow shake can be secured, by rapid 
 turning. This is of immense advantage, as it adapts the fan, to 
 the cleaning of all kinds of seeds. 

Third. A new method of adjusting the riddles aud screws. This 
 gives the operator the advantage of placing them in any pcisiti'in 
 bes'. adapted to accomplish the purposes of a grain Fan. Kvery 
 riddle and screen has a separate adjustment, so that each one can 
 be fixed at any angle without the uecessity of taking them out 

Fourth, The grain, instead of falling <ui the floor, as is usually 
 the case, is discharged, by means of a small trough, into the half 
 bushel, or other measure that may be placed under it. By this ar- 
 rangement the grain is all measured, by the time it is cleaned, 
 thus saving not only labor, but time, and consequently expense, as 
 well as keepins the grain from contact with the dust and din on 
 floor. For this reason; the fan, can be put in opt-ratiou anywhere, 
 with as little trouble as the common fans can be used in a barn 
 floor. 

Fil"tfi, Tlie simplicity of their constructions renders them less 
 liable to get out of repair than other mills. 

For the above reasons, we confidently recommend our Fans to 
 public p;ilroiiage. Privileges to manufacture will be granted on 
 reasonable terms. Satisfactory information can be promptly had 
 by addressing post paid , the subscriber at Norristown, Montgome-

NEW HARDY CLIMBEU. ' 

CALYSTEGIA PUBESCENS. 

This new and beautif al climber, recently introduced from China 
 by Mr. Fortune, proves perfectly hardy in New England, having 
 stood in the grounds here two winters without protection. Train- 
 ed to a single pillar, say^ten feet in height, it is very striking and 
 beautiful object from June till cold weather, during which time it 
 is covered with a profusion of its large double flowers of a delicate 
 rose color. It is very ornamental planted in patches like Verbe- 
 nas; makes an admirable screen ; and is very eff^ective in young 
 plantations, belts or shrubberies, trailing prettily on the surface, 
 and running among the lower branches of the trees in a very pic- 
 turesque manner. Its culture is very simple, and it will thrive in 
 common garden soil. If required in considerable quantities the 
 tubers may be divided into single eyes, planting each in a four inch 
 pot of good light Cftmpoit, in February, under glass, or in hot beds 
 111 the spring ; or larger pieces containing several eyes may be 
 planted in the open ground iu May. Plants &3 per dozen. Tubers 
 for 100 plants S3, which may he sent by mail or express, to order.
