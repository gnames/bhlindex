The persons who have already used these GRAIN FANS have 
 not only spoken in tiattering terms of them, but preler them to all 
 others rhey have used— anil very many of the be&t Agticulturists 
 have given their certificates that the lact of these machines screen- 
 ing the grain twice by one and the same opeTatmn is the very im- 
 provement they have long desired. Uur faimers will now have 
 tlie mist perfect wmnowing machine, which spreads the grain 
 over the upper .s'-reeii more perfectly than any <ilhers now in use. 
 This iinprovement is so valuable as to have induced the inventors 
 and maimrac-tur.Ts to maKe application fr.r Letters Patent.
