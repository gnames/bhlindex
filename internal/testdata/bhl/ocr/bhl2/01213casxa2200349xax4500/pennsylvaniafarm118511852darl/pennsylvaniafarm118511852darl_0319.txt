 It has one very great advantage over barn yard ma- 
 nure in containing no detrimental seeds. The es-

Three hundred pounds to the acre is considered a 
 good application for ordinary cropping. Seven hundred

 a proper medium would be five hundred pounds. —

 Draining. 

Mr. Editor : — In my last communication, I stated 
 tJiat the greater part of the land I had purchased 
 was considered worthless, and wholly unfit for win- 
 ter grain, corn or grass, being springy or what is 
 generally termed spouty. In reconnoitering the 
 land before I purchased, I found it stony on the top. 
 but not so at the depth of a few inches. As it in- 
 clined to the south, and being generally intersected by 
 a strata of stiff clay, I felt assured it would be in my 
 power to convert it into good arable soil. Spouty 
 hind, it is well known, contains in thojspring, a su- 
 perabundance of water, the springs approaching near 
 the surface. The wafer, on inclining ground will 
 find its way without disturbing the surface, where 
 the soil is gravelly or porous limestone, but where it 
 meets a strata of stiff clay, it cannot penetrate it, and 
 is consequently forced to the surface, and finds egress 
 at every possible .pening, conveying the impression 
 tliat the land abounds in springs, when in fact there 
 irt but one. To ascertain th.e location of the main 
 .spring, it is only necessary to mark, in wet weather 
 the different places where the water is forced out. — 
 When the dry season arrives, and the water sinks 
 gradually away, that spot where the temperature of 
 the water is coldest, is the seat of the principal 
 spring. 

I commenced operations, by digging, at the foot of 
 the declivity, a ditch, three feet in depth and two feet 
 wide at the bottom, increasing the width to f.ur feet a* 
 the surface, and three hundred and twenty cubic yards 
 long. From that ditch I started what is called French 
 drains, in different directions, to break through the 
 stiff clay towards the main springs, the whereabouts 
 of which I had previously .ascertained. The French 
 grains, were dug two feet wide at the top and bot- 
 tom, and two feet deep, then filled with stones, to 
 !eave-an opening ot about two inches wide, that the 
 watQT might have a free passage to escape. I then 

covered the stones with leaves or long straw, and filt 
 ed the trench again with the excavated ground. Tla 
 leaves or straw were so laid as to prevent the earth 
 from falling through the stones and filling up the 
 passage for the water. In this way I have made 
 750 yards of dr.ains, all emptying into the ditch at 
 the foot of the hill, and by this means have effectual- 
 ly drained nine main springs. 

For the benefit of those who are disposed to regard 
 draining as too formidable an undertaking, I annex 
 below a statement of expenses. 

320 cubic yards of ditch at 12 cts. per yard, .$ 38 40 
 750 yards, digging, laying the stones and fill- 
 ing up again, 6 cts. per yard, running mea- 
 sure, 45 00 
 The gathering of the stones, hauling them, 
 to the drain, which was done by my hired 
 man with a horse and cart, having the 
 double advantage of clearing the land of 
 stones and applying them to a good and 
 profitable use, 16 60 

?100 00 
 By this operation, I have reclaimed thirty-six acres 
 of land at an expense of one hundred dollars, within 
 twenty miles of a good market (Pottsvillo), and by 
 liming and good management, it now produces from 
 twenty to twenty-five bushels of good wheat, forty to 
 forty-five bushels of corn, forty to fifty bushels of 
 oats or one and a half to two tons of clover or timo- 
 thy hay per acre. 

Many of our farmers are selling off their property 
 .and moving to the west, leaving the homes of their 
 youth and the graves of their fathers, to begin a now 
 life in the wilderness, while thousands of acres oi 
 land in Pennsylvania, can be reclaimed as easily as 
 mine has been, and with as great market conveni- 
 ences. 

Is not this subject worthy consideration. The a<l- 
 vautages of draining only require to be understocd to 
 be adopted, and it has been -p-ith the hope of inducing 
 others to take hold of their pens in support (if it, that 
 I trouble j'ou with the above,

 Influence of the 31oon. 
 In a spirited and sensiljle article upon this subject, 
 published in your last number, some good arguments 
 arc given by Mr. Taggart against the popular belief 
 in lunar influence, as capable of producing changes 
 of weather and affecting the durabili y of wood, ge»- 
 minatiou of seeds, [reservation of fruit, meats, &e. 
 It is one thing to assert disbelief in the existence of 
 such an agency, and quite another, to demonstrate 
 its fallacy. Perhaps one of the strongest demonstra- 
 tions of the incapacity of the moo i to effect changes 
 in the weather, is to be found in the rich pages of 
 the Farmer's Encyclopedia, a work which should be 
 with'n the reach of every one anxious to be posted
