On motion of David Mumraa, Jr., the Sccrntary 
 was oriiered to have printed with the proceedings, 
 the eonstilutiou and aet of incorporation of this so- 
 ciety. 

The committee to inquire into the expediency of 
 memorializing the present Legishiture in relation to 
 the appointment of a State Agricultural Chemist, beg 
 leave to r( port, that, after consultation, they unani- 
 mously recommend to this society the selection of a 
 committee, whose duty it shall be to draft a memorial 
 to the present Legislature, asking the appointment of 
 a State Agricuhural Chemist. It is not considered 
 necessary to enter into a labored argument to prove 
 the necessity of such a step, it being deemed suflicient 
 merely to advert to the fact that wlierever a State 
 Chemist has been appointed, the very best results 
 have followed. [Signed.]

The following preamble and resolutions were taken 
 up and adopted : 

Whereas, It is now an admitted fact that in no 
 way can a nation increase in wealth and power so 
 fast, as by encouraging and securing a rapid improve- 
 ment in the science of agriculture. All admit, that 
 whilst manufactures improve, commerce gi\es value, 
 and labor and capital stimulate, it is agriculture alone 
 that originates : the earth is the parent of them all — 
 all equally derive their origin from the cultivation of 
 the earth, and all must be equally dependent upon it 
 for subsistance. Regarding it then as the basis of 
 all other arts, it justly clainjs pre-eminence over all 
 others ; and such is tiie connection with all the com- 
 forts of the human race, that it may .justly be said 
 that agriculture is the only firm and stable foundation 
 of national greatness. And the various State socie- 
 ties have already demonstrated the fact that in no 
 way can this great and valuable science be so sul> 
 stantially and rapidly improved, as by organized and 
 concerted action, and it is therefore a seli-evidentfact 
 that the formation of a National Agricultural Society 
 is at this time a matter of great moment and impor- 
 tance; therefore, lor the purpose of forming such so- 
 ciety, be it 

Resolred, That we recommend the calling of a con- 
 vention of agricult'.irists of the United States, to meet 
 at the city of Washington at such time as may be 
 fixed upon, as SOI .is i J is ascertained that a sufficient 
 numlier of Sta*.l gl this Union have approved of the 
 plan to warrai e] ■! undertaking. 

ReJioh-ed, T.- •?.■ *)iis society will elect one delegate 
 from each Congressional district of the State, who 
 shall be a memlier of tliis society, to represent this 
 society in said proposed national convention. 

Resolved, That this society expects and earnestiv 
 requests the co-operation of every State in tl'.e Union 
 in this matter. 

Resolved. That all State! or State .societies willing 
 to co-operate v;ith us in this laudable enterprise, are 
 requested tt> inform the President of this society of 
 such fiict: and so soon as five States have so signified 
 their willingness to act in the matter, then the Presi- 
 dent of this society shall immediately after .ascr^rtain- 
 ing, (by corresponding with the several State socie- 
 ties upon the subject.) the most suitable time for 
 calling such convention, fix on a time for the meeting 
 of said convention, of which he shall give notice in 
 as many papers as may be necessary. 

Resolved, That the Secretary of this society shall 
 forward a copy of this preamble and resolutions to 
 the President or Secretary of every State Agricultu- 
 ral society in the United States ; and also furnish ,■» 
 copy to the National Intelligencer and W.ashington 
 Union, for publication. Adjourned.
