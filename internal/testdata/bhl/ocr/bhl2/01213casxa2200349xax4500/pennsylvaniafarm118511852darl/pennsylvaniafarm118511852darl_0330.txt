I hand you herewith Dr. Brincklc's "Remarks on 
 Entomology" for publication in the Farm Journal. — 
 One word of explanation. 

Dr. Brinckle was called on by the Agricultural 
 Convention last winter to prepare an article on this 
 subject. In December last the Dr. placed the article 
 in my hands in Philadelphia, with a request on his 
 part and a promise on mine that it should be laid be- 
 fore the Society, I urged the Dr. to come to Harris- 
 burg and read it himself, but this he peremptorily 
 declined, and expecting at that time to be present at 
 the annual meeting, 1 received it from him for the 
 purpose of submitting it to the Society. But the 
 snow banks delayed my arrival here till after the So- 
 ciety had held its meeting and finally adjourned. I 
 then consulted the officers of tlie Society whom 1 
 iound here as to the disposition to be made of the es- 
 say, and 'oy their advice I place it in your hands for 
 publication and accompany it with this note of ex- 
 planation, as due, not only to the Sofdety, but to the

REMARKS ON ENTO.MOtOGY 

Chief 1/ ill reference to an Ayruulliiral benefit. 

liY Vf. D. BRINCKLE, M. D. 

In compliance more with the spirit than with the 
 letter of a resolution passed liy the Pi-nnsylvania State 
 A'n-icultural Convention held at llarrisburg, in .Jan- 
 uai'y, 1851, I present, at this time, for your consider- 
 ation, some remarks on ENTOMOLoiiV. Had, however, 
 a copy of the resolution reicrred to, reached me prior 
 to the adjournment of the Conveiuion, the prolferred 
 honor would have been respectfully declined, and the 
 name of a gentleman* suggested, who is infinitely 
 more competent to the task than myself, and whose 
 entomological fame has passed lieyond the confines of 
 our own State and our own country. And sliould an 
 Entomologist be required to draw up a I'vport on the 
 voxioiis ('«.s'i i.'/.v of I'tnnsjjlvania, no one more amply 
 ([ualified could be selected. 

Ento.moi.ogv is that branchof Zoology which treats 
 of Insects. The term has its origin in two Greek 
 •words fr-fojitoii 7.oyos, literally signifying insect — his- 
 tory. This department of Natural Science exercises 
 an" important agency in the economy of the physical 
 world, and is intimately connected with the welfare 
 and happiness of our race. To enter fully into its 

consideration, would require volumes instead of th« 
 few pages to which we are now restricted. Our lin>- 
 ited space will, therefore, only allow us to present a 
 very concise general view of the subject, with a brief 
 and condensed outline of such of its charaoterifitie 
 features as have an agricultural bearing. 

In regard to the extent of this branch of Zoology, 
 no little diversity of opinion has prevailed among na- 
 turalists. By some it has been made to include all, 
 or nearly all, of the articulate or invertebrate ani- 
 mals: snch as crabs, lobsters, earth-worms, leeches, 
 spiders, centipedes, &e. Others confine its limits to 
 the winged insects (Ptilota) of Aristotle; thus, very 
 properly, avoiding the unnatural a isociation of groups 
 possessing such incongruous characters. In accord- 
 ance with this view, an Lvsect, from the Latin insee- 
 ta, cut or divided, is an articulate animal with a body 
 insected or divided into three chief portions — thehead, 
 the thoiax, .and the abdomen, — and to the thoi-asare 
 attached six legs, and ordinarily two or four wings.* 

This definition, however, of insects is only applica- 
 ble to tliera in their final or perfect state. But before 
 they can arrive at this state, and acquire this strue- 
 ture, they must necessarily pass through various won- 
 derful changes and transformations called their me- 
 tamorph(jses. 

In their final or perfect insect form, tlio prominent, 
 and in many instances, the only object of their exis- 
 tence, is the perpetuation of their kind, bj' reprodue- 
 tion. Soon after pairing, the female, guided Ijy an 
 inscrutable instinct, deposites her e^'gsf in some suit- 
 able place, J where the appropriate Ibod of the young 
 is at hand. The great purpose of life being now ac- 
 ccnnplished, both the male and female usually die. — 
 Occasionally, hov.'eve;-, the provident care of the pa- 
 rent is necessary to the support a:id sustenance of 
 their offspring. When this is the case, and in some 
 instances where no such necessity exists, their life 
 for a time is prolonged. 

After the lapse of daj'S, weeks or months, the egg 
 hatches, and becomes a caterpillar, grub, or maggot. 
 This is the insect's first state of existence; and in 
 this state it is termed a larva. Except in a few Or- 
 ders in which the metamorphosis is incomplete, the 
 larva does not possess the slightest resemblance to 
 the insect in its final or perfect form. No sooner does 
 it emerge from the egg, than it commences eating vo- 
 raciously; and in a few days, the epidermis or ext«- 
 rior tunic becomes stretched to its utmost extent, pro- 
 venting the further growth of the larva. A new epi- 
 dermis is now formed beneath the old one, which 
 then splits open, and the larva by its contortions casts 

*Frofeieor S. S, Haldeman. 

♦Tiiese three portions of the body are subdivided into joints or 
 rings termed segmeiilB. The head constitutes the first segment — 
 the tliurHX contains three, which are called thoracic segments — the 
 abdominal segments vary in imralier in tlic ditl'erent onlers, and 
 sometimes It IS not uniform in the sexes of llie same species: lu 
 tlie butter dies and mollis (Lepidoptera) it is usually nine, in beetles 
 (Coleaptena) SLX or seven. 

■f Insects are oviporous. To this general law there .ire some ap- 
 parent exceptions ; thus the plant-house, (Aphis) at certain sea- 
 ions of the year, and the Flesh-Fly (Careopliaga cariiaria) and a 
 few others, give birth to lavvci ; the young of the Forest-Fly 
 (HippoboBCa) and congeners are retained within the matrix of the 
 parent till thev have completed their larval life, where they enter 
 the world in the pupa state. In these instances, howaver, the lar- 
 va IS not developed ma uternus and nourished through the medi- 
 um of a placenta, as is the case with the embryo of vivaparous an- 
 imals ; but the egg is haUlud in the body of the mother. 

JMany of the beetles (coleoptera) bugs (Hemipetara) grasshop- 
 pers, &c., (Orthoptera) deposit their eggs in the earth— most of the 
 buiterliies and moths (I.epidoptera) especially those that are hel- 
 biverous in the larva state, and many of the predacious insects as 
 the lady bird hemerohius and syrphus, exclude them on the foliage 
 — some insects lay them in fruits, nuts, aud grain—the 17 years lo- 
 cust and many others, m fissures made in the wood with their ovi- 
 positor—the dragon-fly (Lilellnlu) and other insects aquatic in their 
 larva state, on -water plants — and the parasites, lu the eggs and 
 larva of other insects.
