REMARKS ON ENTOMOLOGY. 

[FeBKUARY; 

unaequaintod with some of their characteristic ana- 
 tomical and physiological pecularities. 

All insects receive their food cithtr by chewing or 
 by suction. The former are denominated Maudibii- 
 late insects, the latter llaustellate or Suctorial. The 
 BtruT-ture and configuration of their oral organs, 
 taererure, are indicative of the nature and consis- 
 tonco of the nourishment onwhica they feed. No 
 insect provided with a suctorial apparatus can sub- 
 sist on solid food; nor can those with a manducatory 
 mouth live oti liquids. If, then, you observe a plant, 
 the leaves of which have boon much eaten, and you 
 find on it insects with a haustullate mouth, you have, 
 in thiir oral structure, conclusive evidence that these 
 insects did not commit the depredation on the foliage. 
 One of the most remaikable peculiarities of insect- 
 life is their mode of breathing. In them, the func- 
 tion of respiration is performed by an organism dif- 
 fering in its arrangement and position from that of 
 most other animals. Instead of communicating with 
 the mouth, the external respiratory organs are found 
 on the surface of the body, in one of three forms, viz: 
 spiraeles, air-tubes, or bronchia3. 

Spiracles are simple incisions or'circular openings at 
 the sides of the segments of the body. Air-tubes are 
 csseulially the same as the preceding, being spirac es 
 elongated so as to project beyond the surface. They 
 do not always occupy the same position as the former, 
 but are usually placed at the first or last abdominal 
 segment, and are only found in some insects that are, 
 in their larval state, denizens of the water. Branchias 
 or Gills are processes of the epidermis or skin ; and 
 are confined to aquatic larv;B. Their ordinary form 
 is that of hair or leaves, which are filled with delicate 
 little air-pipes, thatimljibe, from the water, the air it 
 contains, and convey it to the main tubes, through 
 which it is transmitted to every part of the body. 

The internal respiratory organs are tubes called 
 trachea;. The}' commence at the spiracles, air-tubes 
 or root of the branchia?, and ramify in all directions, 
 thus lurnishing to the blood the oxygen it requires 
 for the support of life. 

In regard to the Senses, there are strong grounds 
 for believing that insects possess them all ; though 
 sight is the only one that can, with eertaint_ir, be re- 
 ferred to a particular organ. Various considerations, 
 however, favor the opinion, entertained by many en- 
 tomologists, that the antenme are the organs of hear- 
 ing — the palpi of feeling — the tongueof taste — and the 
 mucous or living membrane of thetracheoe of smelling. 
 The Eyes of insects dift'er from those of other ani- 
 mals in their immobility. The- are of two descrip- 
 tions, simple and composite. The composite eye is 
 placed on each siile of the head ; and though appa- 
 rcntlj' a single organ, it is composed of a great num- 
 ber of very minute hexagonal facets, every one of 
 which is, in reality, a separate eye. These facets or 
 lenses are computed to amount, in some insects, to 
 many thousands. The simple eyes (ocelli or stem- 
 meta) are generally three in number, of small size, 
 hemispherical in form, and placed triangularly on 
 the crown of the head. The eyes of larvw are simple 
 ocelli arranged in groups. Simple as well as compo- 
 site eyes are usually met with in insects in their 
 •winged form. Some insects are entirely blind, at 
 least in one stage of their e."5istence, having neither 
 simple nor compound eyes. This is the case with the 
 maggots of flies, (Uiptera) the larva of the diiferent 
 gpecies of Syrphus, and of some minute beetles, (Co- 
 leoptera) and the grubs of the cockchafer (Melolon- 
 tha) as well as the grubs of the rest of the Petalo- 
 cerous division of the Lamellicorues. 
 Until a comparatively recent date, it 'vras generally 

believed that insects were destitute of a circulatorj 
 system. Its existence, however, has been fully es- 
 tablished by the investigations of Carus, Comparctti, 
 Bowerbank, Burmiester, and others. A heart, in all 
 respects analogous to that of the higher orders of ani- 
 mals, it is true, they do not possess. Nevertheless 
 this name has been applied to a longitudinal tube 
 consisting of a congonies of chambers, and extending 
 the whole length of' the body, b( neath the dorsal in- 
 teguments. It is readily distinguished by its con- 
 tractions and dilatations. The fluid contained in 
 this vessel, differs in color and temperature from the 
 blood of the vertebrate animals ; being cold, and co- 
 lorless, j'ellowish, or of a greenish tint. Nor is it 
 distributed to the various parts of the system, as in 
 the vertebratiB, by means of arteries and veins. By 
 the contraction of the heart-chambers, it is propelled 
 along the dorsal tube to the head, where it is poured 
 out, and forced, by the viti a tergo, into the crevices 
 and interstices of every part of the body, penetrating 
 even the legs, wings, and antennae. After uniting 
 with the nutritive juices that transude through the 
 parietes of the intestinal canal, it is again drawn 
 into the dorsal chambers or reservoirs by their ex- 
 pansion. The air-tubes extend their multitudinous 
 ramifications in all directions through this fluid, and 
 convey to it.as you have already be eninformed.the sup- 
 ply of oxygen so necessary to theexistenceof the insect. 
 The digestive system of insects does not present 
 any characteristic peculiarities requiring special no- 
 tice. In them its power is commensurate with their 
 voracity. Many herbaceous substances that are poi- 
 soinous to other animals, are devoured by some of 
 the herbivorous insects with impunity. Not only is 
 every plant subject to their attacks, but each part of 
 it liecomes the favorite food of one or more tribes. — 
 While some subsist entirely on the root, the appropri- 
 ate aliment of others is the blossom, fruit, seed, leaf, 
 bud, pith, bark, albumen, or even the solid wood itr 
 self. Of those that obtain their nourishment from 
 the foliage, soma only extract its juices, as the Plants 
 Louse, and Hessian Fly ; othera cat the parenchyma 
 alone, as the mining caterpillar; not a few prefer the 
 under surface, ae the leaf rollers ; many select the 
 upper surface, as the slug ; while the caterpillars of 
 most of the butterflies and moths eat the whole leaf. 
 Of those that obtain their food from flowers, some 
 subsist on the petals, others on the pollen, and a still 
 greater number on the honey in the nectarines. With 
 their transformations, a eh.ange of food generally 
 though not invariably becomes necessary. The cat- 
 erpillar, the maggot, and the grub, require, usually, 
 a very difierent kind of food from the moth, the fly, 
 and the beetle. The grub of the cockchafer (Melo- 
 lontha) lives on roots, the beetle on leaves. Animal 
 food is the aliment of the larv» of the ichneumons, 
 while in the imago or perfcet-insect form their sus- 
 tenance is obtained from the juices of flowers. Some 
 insects, after the completion of their final metamor- 
 phosis, take no food whatever; such are the day-flies* 
 (Hemerobii), the caddice-flies (Phryganese), and the 
 may-flies (Ephemiraj). 

The amount of food consumed by insects is almost 
 incredible ; consequently the injury done b" them to 
 vegetation, must at times be exceedingly great. 

You are all familiar with the appalling account* 
 of the devastation committed by the Locusts of the 
 East. Occurring, as they often do, in cloud-like 
 swarms so dense as to obscure the light of the sun, it 
 is not surprising that they should, in so short a period, 
 destroy every vestige of vegetation where they alight; 
 and that their course should frequently be foUowe
