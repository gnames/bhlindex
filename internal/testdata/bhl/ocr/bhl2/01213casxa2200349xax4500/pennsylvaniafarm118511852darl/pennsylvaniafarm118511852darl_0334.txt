lest individuals ; the rival couples moping in corners, 
 and renewing their battles on obtaining the first ray 
 of light." The game Eggs are rather smaller tlian 
 common, but finely-shaped and extremely rich and 
 delicate. The weight of this Fowl is from 3J to SJ 
 lbs., though I have heard of 8 lbs., and my friend, 
 Wm. Wistar, Esq., near Germanto\vn, assures me 
 that ho has a Game Cock, thorough-bred, that novr 
 wei'^hs 9'- lbs. The practice of fighting Cocks is sup- 
 supposed to be of Grecian origin. It was adopted by 
 the Romans about 470 years before the Christian era. 
 " There are evidently two varieties of the Game 
 Fowl, if not more. (Assuredly.) The first, occa- 
 sionally seen in the yard of the farmer, is a bird over 
 the average size, and rather heavily formed ; rather 
 too much comb ; breast quite black ; neck, back and 
 ■wings of a very deep red; tail, glossy green. The 
 Hen plain brown, with a lighter-coloured neck, some- 
 times a little streaked with ochre ; legs light-coloured 
 or white. 

" The other variety, which I much prefer, and now 
 possess, is a smaller Fowl, of a peculiarly light and 
 elegant make ; head very small and flue ; neck, light 
 orange-red ; breast richly spotted, as are, also, in a 
 degree, the wings ; back, very rich red ; tail, glossy 
 greenish black ; legs, dark. liens, brown of various 
 shades, the feathers being streaked with pale ochro 
 down the middle, the same as Pheasants ; comb, in 
 the Cocks very small, and ncit very large in the 
 Hens. 

" These are most spirited birds, and will soon gain 

the ascendancy of any yard. The eggs are slightly 
 tinged with yellow-buff, rather small, and long in 
 shape. Hens, good layers and sitters. Chicks, when 
 first hatched, exceedingly pretty, being marked with 
 a deep brown streak on the head and neck, that con- 
 tinues down the back. They are hardy littlo things, 
 and easy to rear. — Dixon tfc Kerr's Ornamental and

MR. WISTAR'S SEABRIGHT BANTAMS. 

THE SMOOTH-LEGGED BANTAM. 

The small White, and also the coloured Bantams, 
 whose legs are heavily feathered, are sufiBciently well 
 known to render a particular description unnecessary. 
 Bantam-fanciers generally, with Sir John Sebright 
 at their head, prefer those which have clean bright 
 legs, without any vestige of fepthers. 

The rule with fanciers is, that a thorough-bred Cock 
 should have a rose comb ; a well-feathered tail, with- 
 outthe sickle leathers, however ; full hackles, a proud, 
 lively carriage, and ought not to exceed a pound in 
 weight. The nankeen-coloured and the black arethe 
 general favorites. 

They are said to have been imported, by the late 
 Sir John Sebright, from India. For perfection of 
 model, and beauty of plumage, nothing can exceed 
 them. The pair portrayed on the opposite page are 
 in the possession of Mr. Wistar, of Cfermantown, and 
 were procured for him by a friend in England. — 
 They are, as may be seen in the portraits, beautifully 
 marked ; the ground of the feathers being a rich or- 
 ange bi own or cream-colour, and each feather pencil- 
 led round the edge with black, with the greatest uni- 
 formity. They are sometimes called the " Sebright 
 Fowl." They are bred in and about London, also in 
 Tarious parts of England and Ireland, with the most 
 scrupulous care. In London there are stated times 

for the exhibition and sale of these birds ; and Mr. 
 Nolan tells us that " the regulations of the Society 
 of London Amateurs, require that each exhibitor shall 
 offer his birds for sale, after the exhibition, and may 
 bid himself, and put on a prohibitory amount of pur- 
 chase-money. It is on record that Sir John bid up 
 one of his diminutive Hens to £29, and bought her 
 in at that price. And it is recorded in the Illustra- 
 ted London News, of 20th February, 1S47, that so late 
 as that date, two Hens and a Cook, of these beauti- 
 ful emblems of pride and consequence, sold for £50 
 and Is., being a shilling more than the amount put 
 on them by their owner. At the sale of the late la- 
 mented baronet, the golden grounded birds averaged 
 £5 a brace, and the silver spangled £8 a brace ; al- 
 though they are becoming comparatively abundant, 
 they still keep up a high price in the London market, 
 if well marked. There has been lately offered here, 
 some fine specimens, from Sir -John's own stock, at a 
 very low figure. I do not think any thing could ex- 
 ceed their perfection of feather. A lady near Shrews- 
 bury, has procured some fine specimens of both gold 
 and silver spangled, from this neighborhood ; if she 
 still retain them, I think she may challenge England; 
 as far as I can judge, they are quite superior to those 
 that took the prize in London. Someladiesin Queen's 
 County, have procured fine specimens from the late
