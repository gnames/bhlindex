baronet's stock ; I have no doubt, but under their fos- 
 tering care, the breed will be kept up with as much 
 ardor as during the lifetime of the great poultry-pa- 
 txon Sir John, and that we will be breeding them, as 
 in the baronet's lifetime, "to a single feather," and 
 retain their character of the "prettiest of domestic 
 birds." The male birds should stand about twelve 
 inches high : the standard weight being twenty-two 
 ounces ; the plumage as above described, (the rose- 
 comb is preferred ;) the wattles are moderately long- 
 face and throat bare; no top-knot or ruff on neck; as 

free as possible from hackle ; tail without the plume, 
 or what is called hen-tailed ; perfectly cluan-logged."

THE SPANGLED HAMBURG FOWL. 

This beautful variety is distinguished from other 
 members of the same family, liy their large top-knots 
 being coloured instead of white, and the l:>lack and 
 conspicuous muffle or ruff on the throat and under 
 the beak. There are two kinds, the golden and sil- 
 ver spangled ; the ground of the feathers of the gol-

den spangled being a rich yellow, approaching to an 
 orange-red, with black spots or spangles. The silver 
 Bpanglod differs from the preceding, by the ground of 
 the feathers being silvery white. The comb, as in 
 other highly crested Fowls, is quite small ; the wat- 
 tles are also diminutive ; legs generally Ijlue ; skin 
 and flesh white ; Eggs a moderate size, but abundant ; 
 Chickens easily reared. In and aljout New York, a 
 few years since, this Fowl abounded — both the golden 
 ftnd silver varieties. They may weigh, say, three and 
 s, half pounds, for the female, and from four and a 
 half to five and a half for the male. The Cock stands 
 more than twenty inches high, and the Hen about 
 eighteen inches. — Dixon & Ken's Ornamental and

For the Farm Jonrnal. 
 Mixing Plaster with Stal)le Manure. 

Mk. Editor:— In the December number of your 
 aluable Journal, I find an article over the signature 

of A. L. H. on the subject of deep plowing, economis- 
 ing manures, &c., to all of which I heartily assent, 
 and have no doubt if the farmers of the State would 
 adopt the suggestions, they would b(? amply remune- 
 rated. It is very apparent that if A. L. H's. sugges- 
 tions were carried into practical effect, that the crops 
 of Pennsylvania would be increased at least one-third 
 over the present yield. It becomes a matter of se- 
 rious duty with our farmers to discard the present in- 
 different and wasteful manner of farming, and adopt 
 a system which will not only prove beneficial to our- 
 selves, but to the interests of agriculture at large. — 
 The grand requisite for the accomplishment of so de- 
 sirable an end, is the advancement of intelligence 
 amongst the farming community. Your Journal frir- 
 nishes one of the means required, and its general cir- 
 culation, containing as it does, so much valuable in- 
 formation relating to the advancement of agriculture 
 should be encouraged by all.
