 The Circle of Fruits. 

A few years since, Nursery catalogues were gorg- 
 ed with hundreds of names of good, bad and indif- 
 ferent fruits, and the novice in fruit planting was 
 completely bewildered by the array of hard words 
 set before him " whence to choose." Public atten- 
 tion was called to this evil, and so well was it shown 
 up, that as a consequence, we have now the other ex- 
 treme : — one thinks half a dozen sorts quite enough, 
 and another avers that there are not many more first 
 rate varieties of any fruit (pe.arsfor example) known 
 to promologists. An old gentleman remarked In my 
 hearing the other day, that he could not see any use 
 in planting more than three or four sorts, some for 
 summer, and some for winter. This man has no idea 
 of over-indulging himself evidently, his appearance 
 proves it. Although owner of hundreds of rich acres, 
 he was out on a " raw and gusty day " without mit- 
 tens or boots, or even a comfortable coat. Unthank- 
 ful, grudging, niggardly acceptance of God's boun- 
 ties is a wilful afirout to Divine Beneficence. 

Health demands a free supply of ripe and season- 
 able fruit. A friend remarked the other day that he 
 felt a want in the evenings which he could not for 
 some time account for. He missed his evening dish 
 of apples, and the loss affecting his digestion, rend- 
 ered him uncomfortable during the day. One of the 
 oldest and ablest physicians of our county says that 
 apples and abstinence have been the only medicines 
 he has used himself for many years. 

It is natural to man to desire change. Variety is 
 the spice of life. There are hundreds of palatable 
 flavors of fish, flesh, fowl and vegetable, but there is 
 not one among them, nor any half dozen to which 
 we would bo wholly confined. Much more, and more 
 safely may wo partake of every fruit " pleasant to 
 the eye, and good for food," their flavors are mingled 
 by the hand of Nature, and the more acceptable to 
 the palate, the more wholesome they are. Only un- 
 ripe, unseasonable fruits, are injurious, in the free 
 and constantuse of others there is no danger of excess. 
 But how to hare a constant supply. Summer fruits 
 arc transient. Many desirable kinds last but a few 
 days, and we must accept these or go without for a 
 time, deprived of the relish of their peculiar quali- 

ties. Many like to see a variety of colors, forms and 
 flavors on the same dish, and choose to sip of this, 
 and then of that, and there is no reason why this taste 
 may not be indulged. To begin with Spring — who 
 would not rejoice to have the benefit of a supply of 
 refreshing, cooling, astringent cherries, during the first 
 heats of summer, and who would prefer to wait for 
 the latest, or having enjoyed the earliest would have 
 none of the latest ? Who would not choose to have 
 some acid enough to stew, as well as some to eat from 
 the tree ; and who that has room to grow them would 
 object to having two or three sorts glowing and 
 laughing from the tree at one time ? Besides that, in 
 this case, there is a triple chance for an annual sup- 
 ply of one sort, if not of all. 

As to cherries then ; on account of the transient na- 
 ture of individual sorts, and of the pleasure and en- 
 joyment arising from variety and plenty, a cherry- 
 grove should contain at the least, 12 different sorts, 
 forming a succession from the last of May till Au- 
 gust, and, when these are all in bearing, the posses- 
 sor will rather add to the list other kinds than strike 
 out. Of apples, pears, plums, which extend 

any 

over a longer season and have greater diviersity of 
 flavor and of uses, a still greater variety will be de- 
 manded. 

It requires some skill and care to select a suit of 
 varietiesjudiciously, each one must consult his own pre- 
 ferences for certain qualities of the fruits, and choose 
 trees adapted in hardiness to his location. The 
 Iland-Book advertised in your Journal gives a Table 
 of maturity from which a list may be very conveni- 
 ently fi'amed. It should then be corrected by refe- 
 rence to the description of each particular sort.

 Gooseteiry. 

Mr. Editor : — Some years since I saw an article 
 in some publication, how to treat gooseberry bushes 
 to procure largo and fine fruit. Having tried many 
 different plans, but always without success, I natu- 
 rally had verj' little faith in this new recommenda- 
 tion. Last spring, however, I made trial and the re- 
 sult, I must confess, disappointed my expectations 
 most agreeably. I had large and fine fruit, free from 
 mildew. Though I had been cvdtivating the goose- 
 berry for more than twenty years, I never succeeded 
 in procuring the fruit free from the mildew. The 
 plan simply is, to transplant the lushes every spring. 
 It ought to be done early, as the gooseberry is one 
 of the earliest growers, and the ground should be 
 made rich. In a year or two the roots become mat- 
 ted together, and the plants can be lifted with a ball 
 of earth, attached to the roots, the same as if taken 
 out of a pot. Whether this plaa will continue to 
 succeed, I am not at present prepared to say, from a 
 single year's trial, yet it is sufficiently encouraging 
 to persevere in the same course. If any of your read
