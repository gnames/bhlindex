ers have gooseberry bushes (and no doubt there are 
 many) the fruit of which is annually destroyed by 
 mildew, I would suggest that they take a few of them 
 on trial this spring, and report the result for the 
 Journal. I will give the result of my experiment

 Asparagus. 

From the kind of stalks served up to Pittsburgh 
 tables, and called " asparagus," one would naturally 
 conclude our gardeners never read, and so there is no 
 use talking to them: but somebody who does read, 
 and likes this excellent vegetable, might take the 
 trouble to tell them to salt their beds. Asparagus 
 beds never require weeding, for there should be just 
 as much salt put on them as to kill every vegetable 
 except asparagus. The weeds should all be kiUed 
 with salt ; and then the soil is in proper order, if rich 
 enough, to bear asparagus like hoc-handles. We this 
 spring put half a peek of salt, and three or four 
 inches deep of well rotted stable manure, on a bed 
 two feet and a half square. The stalks shoot up 
 there about as thick as an ordinary candle, — a dozen 
 of them about every two days. They will not bear 
 more than ten minutes' boiling : fifteen reduces them 
 to a pulp. The asparagus is entirely free from that 
 bitter pungent taste which resembles bad salad; and 
 has that delicious flavor peculiar to itself. 

Me. Spaxgler. — The above is taken from the 
 Pitlshurg Saturday Visiter, edited by Mrs. Swisshelm 
 — You will perceive that she is no novice,jeven in the 
 garden. That she handles the hoe as well as the pen, 
 you have an instance in the above paragraph. 

Now, who is not a lover of asparagus, and who 
 would not admire it placed on the table " like hoe- 
 handles," instead of the kind of stalk generally seen, 
 tough as leather three-fourths of their length? — 
 The fact is, asparagus is a marine plant, and natural- 
 ly grows near the sea-shore, where the soil is strongly 
 impregnated with salt. But who ever before placed 
 " half a peck of salt, and three or four inches of well 
 rotted stable manure on a bed tvro and a half feet 
 square ?" Well, she is generally right, and I intend 
 to try her plan, and would advise you, Mr. Editor, 
 as you are going into the gardening line, to experi- 
 ment on a part of your large bed, and give us the 
 result through the Journal. J. B. G. 

Pennsylvania Horticultural Society. 

The stated meeting of this Society was held in the 
 Chinese Saloon, Philadelphia, on Tuesday evening, 
 January 20th, 1852. E. W. Keyser, V. P., in the 
 chair. Notwithstanding the severity of the weather, 
 a number of objects were shown. .iVnother beauti- 
 ful flower of the Victoria regia, the thirty-eiglith pro- 
 duced by Jlr. Cope's plant. The bud was cut and 
 brought in carefully protected from the intense 
 cold, and when taken out, it expanded handsomely, 
 and was a perfect specimen of smaller dimensions 
 than those shovra at recent meetings. A moss cov- 
 ered Urn displaying fine flowers and a large basket 
 of choice varieties among which were a raceme of 
 fragrant flowers of the Stanhopea mandata a rare 

orchid and Cypripedium I'CTjasfaOT from the President's 
 hot houses. And three boquets from other sources.

 riety from W. V. Pettit; the "caster beurr^" from II. 
 W. S. Cleveland, and a winter Pear from N. Lott, Rea-

 J. J. Thomas, Macedon, N. Y., and the "Keim" vari-

The Library Committee presented their annual re- 
 port on the condition of the library and a statement of 
 its receipts and expenditures; and by which it appears 
 there are now upwards of nine hundred and fifty 
 volumes on appropriate subjects. 

The special committee on nominations submitted a 
 ticket of oflicers to be voted for at the annual meeting, 
 and a report descanting fully onthesubject of thePres 
 ident's determination to decline a re-election, announ- 
 ced a year ago, expressing regret thereat, and setting 
 forth his meritorious services and showing the ad- 
 vantages he, by his liberality, has rendered to the 
 cause of Horticulture in this community: likewise al- 
 luding to the course pursued by the Society on its 
 profuse expenditure of means in its awards, and an- 
 ticipating a hope that an association so useful may 
 yet become the recipients of donations and legacies 
 to enable it to establish what was originally contem- 
 plated, a Botanic Garden, ending with a recommen- 
 dation, that a committee be appointed to devise some 
 suitable testmionial to Mr. Cope in appreciation of 
 the good he has eifected. 

A communication from R. Robinson Scott was 
 read, the subject of his remarks was in relation to 
 the award made to him of premiums at the last

 pursue the subject on some future occasion.

 ning by the committee on plants and flowers :
