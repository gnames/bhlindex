Our Office. 

Those having business to transact with us will 
 please call at the Book Store of W. H. Spangler, in 
 North Queen street, Lancaster, where we or our re- 
 presentative will at all times be in attendance. 

To old subscribers. 

Frequent inquiries have been made of us recently, 
 whether old subscribers will be permitted to renew 
 their subscriptions at club prices. As a general re- 
 ply to these inquiries, we answer, most assuredly. — 
 Our terms now, are the same as formerly, and we 
 indulge the belief that not only shall we retain our 
 old friends, but that our club lists (with large addi- 
 tions of new names) will bo renewed. 

Back Numbers. — We repeat the notice given in 
 former numbers, that we can supply any or all of 
 the back numbers of the first volume. If any of our 
 subscribers have failed to receive them regularly, we 
 will, if advised of it, cheerfully supply any deficien- 

To Correspondents. — ^We have on file a number 
 of excellent communications, which have boon una- 
 voidablv crowded out by a press of other interesting 
 matter. We are led to indulge the hope, that our 
 readers will avail themselves of this season of leisure 
 to the farmer, to write out facts for the forthcoming 
 numbers of the Journal. Every man's experience is 
 Taluablo, and every farmer in the State is competent 
 to furnish something to enrich our columns. We 
 care not how plainly these articles may be written, 
 as we ask not for polished essays, but for plain facts. 
 Give us the facts in your own language, and we will 
 prepare them for publication. 

Valuable Farm for sale. — The attention of those 
 desirous of purchasing Virginia lands, is directed to 
 the advertisement of Mr. Boiling, of Petersburg, Va. 
 who offers Sandy Point farm for sale. This is said 
 to be a most valuable and desirable property. 

Dr. Brinckle's Essay on Entomology. — We ask 
 the earnest attention of every reader of the Journal 
 to the able and at the same time highly valuable and 
 interesting essay of Dr. Brinckle on Insects. The 
 importance of this subject to the farming community 
 generally, has not heretofore claimed the attention it 
 should have done. We are led to hope, however, 
 that the familiar, yet scientific manner in which the 
 able author has treated it, will induce many who 
 have hitherto regarded it as of trivial importance, to 
 study it more closely, and by their observations, aid 
 in the extermination of what is a rapidly increasing 
 foe to the farmer. We can only regret that the late 
 hour at which the essay was received, prevented us 
 from giving it entire in the present number. 

A Word to our friends. 

With the next number closes the first volume of 
 the Farm Journal. In retrospecting the events of 
 the past year, we cannot repress a feeling of honest 
 thankfulness for the very cordial and encouraging 
 support extended to our undertaking. We entered 
 the field almost alone. All commended the enter- 
 prise, but few had faith in its ultimate success. All 
 agreed that Pennsylvania farmers ought to support 
 an agricultural journal of their own, but few believed 
 they would. Encouraged by a small number of con- 
 fident friends, we launched our craft, and trusted to 
 the generosity of the friends of agriculture through- 
 out the State, to save it from being wrecked. With 
 the issue of the first number came new friends. The 
 skies brightened. Words of good cheer from good 
 men encouraged our hearts, and with each succeed- 
 ing effort to win for it an honorable position amongst 
 the agricultural periodicals of our country, came re- 
 newed and multiplied expressions of favor, until at 
 length we felt that we had sufficient support to insure 
 its permanency. 

Another number closes our first volume and we as- 
 sure our readers that we shall enter upon the second 
 with a hopeful though trembling heart. A thousand 
 vague fears besot us. Has the Farm -Journal met 
 the expectations of those who have kindly aided in 
 giving it an existence ? Will the efforts of those who 
 interested themselves in its behalf when in its infancy 
 and so essential to its future prosperity, be again put 
 forth, or will they be relaxed, and we compelled to strug- 
 gle on with the cheerless prospect of a bare existence 
 before us. Ours has never been a desponding spirit. 
 We may not have succeeded in making the Journal 
 what it should be, although we did all we could ; but 
 we are consoled by the idea that "the world was not 
 made in a day," nor should it be expected that in a 
 single year it is possible to give our publication the 
 high character at which we aim. Believing, and be- 
 lieving confidently, that those who stood by us in the 
 beginning will not forsake us now, we appeal to them 
 again for their generous aid. WiU not those who
