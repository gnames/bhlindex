furnished us with club lists, do so again ? AVe do 
 do not like to promise much, fearing our ability to 
 fulfil ; but if enlarged experience, increased facilities, 
 and the assurance of strong support for our columns 
 from a host of excellent men will be taken as a guar- 
 antee, wo think we may safely promise that the next 
 volume of the Farm Journal will approximate a little 
 more closely to the standard of excellence we desire 
 it to attain, than that which is about closing. Is this 
 sufficient? If so, friends of agriculture, commence 
 the good work. Let us enter upon the new volume 
 knowing that we shall be sustained. Let us feel 
 tliat we have your approbation, and though we real- 
 ize nothing more than the mere expenses of publica- 
 tion, we shall have the consciousness that our efforts 
 to build up the character of Pennsylvania agriculture, 
 if not profitable to ourselves, may have been so to 
 others. 

Culture of the Upland Cranberry, 

A correspondent asks, " whether the Cranberry 
 may not be successfully cultivated on upland." The 
 practicability of growing the Cranberry on high land 
 has been satisfactorily shown, by the success which 
 has attended the effort wherever properly made. In 
 the New England States, great attention has been 
 given to the subject, and the result has settled the 
 question beyond a doubt. INIr. Sullivan Bates of Bel- 
 lingham, Massachusetts, gathered 400 bushels from 
 a single acre, and other cultivators have been equal- 
 ly successful, though we do not believe that this quan- 
 tity is to be regarded as an average yield, nor indeed 
 is it necessary that it should be in order to render 
 the culture of the upland Cranbery a matter of pro- 
 fit. Cranberries command from §1,50 to S3 per bu- 
 shel, and as those grown on upland are said to be 
 much larger than the Swamp berries, and equally 
 well adapted to culinary purposes, there appears to 
 be a decided advantage in cultivating the former. 

The culture of the Cranberry is simple, and at- 
 tended with but slight expense. A clay soil mixed 
 with a sufficient quantity of sand to prevent its ba- 
 king, seems best adapted to its growth. Any soil that 
 is suitable for the Strawberry will answer for the 
 Cranberry, and as it is propagated both by runners 
 and seed, there is little difficulty in growing them, if 
 a proper begining is made. 

The land intended for Cranberries should be plow- 
 ed, and if a quantity of swamp muck is applied so 
 much the better. It should then be thoroughly har- 
 rowed, and the plants set out in drills from eighteen 
 to twenty inches apart. vSome hoeing will be neces- 
 sary the jirst season, after which they require no 
 cultivation. A very rich soil is not necessarj\ Mr. 
 Bates contends that the soil should be so poor, that 
 nothing will grow upon it to obstruct the growth of 
 the Cranberry, and to accomplish this he recom- 
 mends the removal of the top soil. 

We have frequently seen the Cranberry growing 
 wild, Ijut never under cultivation, and are compelled 
 therefore to glean our information in regard to the 
 proper mode of culture fi'om other sources. We have 
 however, not the slightest doubt that they will suc- 
 ceed well on upland, and would be glad to see them 
 introduced into Pennsylvania, as we regard it as a 
 valuable and delicious fruit. 

Rockland. — Wo are pleased to state that in our 
 next number we shall present our subscribers with a 
 handsomely engraved portrait of the first premium 
 Durham bull " Rockland," the property of James 
 Gowen, Esq., of Mount Airy, Philadelphia county. 
 Rockland is perhaps one of the finest animal.? in the 
 State, and we hope to follow up his portrait with oth- 
 ers of a similar character. 

Fanning Mills. — Among the many excellent Ag- 
 ricultural implements exhibited at the State Fair, was 
 a large variety of Fanning Mills, manufactured in 
 in our own and the adjoining States, embodying all 
 the recent improvements. The display was large, 
 and no portion of the implement department attracts 
 ed so much attention. A fau' and impartial trial was 
 given each, and resulted in the award of the first 
 premium to Jesse Roberts, of Norristown, Slontgom- 
 ery county. Pa. This mill possesses mauy excellent 
 qualities and attracted great attention, in regard to 
 the simplicity and completeness of its machinery, as 
 well the excellence of the work performed by it, — 
 For a more particular description we refer our rea- 
 ders to Mr. Robert's advertisement. 

Bamborough's celebrated mills were alsa on exhi- 
 bition, and were awarded a diploma, the committee 
 considering them of almost eqiial excellence with 
 Robert's. The same compliment was paid to Grant's 
 mill, exhibited by Messrs. Prouty & Barrett. A num- 
 ber of other Mills of high merit were on the ground, 
 which the committee mentioned as worthy of praise. 
 These were exhibited by Whitman & Co.. of Balti- 
 more; Montgomery & Bro., Lancaster; Lanphear 
 & Jeffries, Lancaster ; S. N. Lacy, Wyoming co. : 
 C. Schrciner, Cumberland co. ; J. Behel, Juniata, 
 and E. Watkins, Washington county. 

Lancaster County Agricultpral Society. — The 
 annual meeting of this society was held on Tuesday, 
 January 13th. The attendance was large and re- 
 spectable, and a deep interest manifested by all pre- 
 sent. The annual address was delivered by James 
 Gowen, Esq., and is said to be a most valuable con- 
 tribution to the cause of agriculture. It is shortly to 
 be published in pamphlet form by the society, when 
 we will be able to speak more fuUy of its merits. — 
 JIuch to our regret, the blocking up of the .lil roads 
 by the snow, prevented us from reaching home in 
 time to hear it delivered.
