Lessons in Modern Farming, or Agriculture for 
 Schools ; containing scientific exercises for recita- 
 tion and elegant extracts from rural literature, for 
 academic or family reading, bi/ Rer. Jno. L. Blalce, 
 D.D. Mark 11. Newmivn & Co., New York. For 
 sale by Lindsay & Blakiston, Philadelphia. 

The importance of agricultural education has been 
 so much dwelt upon of late, that it is scarcely neces- 
 sary for us to point out its claims now. The convic- 
 tion that the son of the farmer should receive an edu- 
 cation analogous to that provided for young men de- 
 signed for the liberal professions, is daily strengthen- 
 ing. There are those, and perhaps the greatest 
 number, who advocate the establishment of agricul- 
 tural colleges. While we heartily second their efforts 
 and trust that the day will come when such institu- 
 tions will abound, it is very evident to us that the 
 day has not yet arrived. There are certain prelimi- 
 nary steps necessary, whieh have not been taken. — 
 However fiivorable public opinion may be to the es- 
 tablishment of such institutions, it is apparent that 
 to put them into successful practical operation will 
 require mightier energies than can be brought to bear 
 upon them now. To the rising generation — the youth- 
 ful yeomanry of the land — we must look for help, 
 and in order to interest them sufficiently, it is neces- 
 sary that the importance of scientific agriculture bo 
 inculcated into their minds at an early age, and the 
 means to be used for the accomplishment of so de- 
 sirable a result, must be placed within the reach of 
 all. If it be asked how this may be done, we answer, 
 tlirough the Common Schools of the Commonwealth. 
 Agriculture must be made a branch of study, so that 
 every youth in our State who is destined to become a 
 farmer, may have the great leading principles of his 
 intended profession instilled into his mind at an early 
 age. If it be urged, that competent teachers could 
 not ba procured, we meet the objection by asserting 
 that so soon as it is ascertained that a general knowl- 
 edge of the principles of agriculture is a necessary 
 qualification of a teacher in the pulilic schools, just 
 80 soon will teachcis make it a study, as they are 
 compelled to do the diflbrent branches of arithmetic, 
 grammar, &c. The work before us is eminently cal- 
 culated to promote this object, and we indulge the 
 hope that those who have charge of our public schools 
 will see the importance of giving to this subject the 
 attention it so richly deserves. 

Address of Peter A. Browne, L.L.D., before the Agri- 
 cultural Society of Bucks county. Pa., Oct. 1, 1851. 

This is a well prepared and useful address by an 

author well known to agriculturists by his writings 

upon wool. It traces the rapid growth of the flour- 

hing county of Bucks ; contrasts the condition of 

^'\) American farmer with the system of " white sla- 

very" practised by the English in Ireland, gives va- 
 rious statistical and historical facts of much interest 
 to the citizens of the county, and includes some sug- 
 gestions for the advancement of agriculture. The 
 extent to which matters of local interest are treated 
 is worthy of imitation on similar occasions, when the 
 local audiences of county societies are addressed. 

Woman in her variotis Eclations, containing practical 
 rules for American females, d'c, by Mrs. L. G. 
 Abell, author of " Skilful Honseicife," " Gems by 
 the Wayside," d-c. William Holdredge, Nexo York. 

The readers of the Journal will recognise in the 
 author of this neat volume, one of our most esteemed 
 contributors. We have examined its pages with feel- 
 ings of deep interest, containing as they do, a mass 
 of valuable hints upon subjects with which every wo- 
 man should be familiar. It is designed to bring be- 
 fore the women of our country, in their true colors, 
 the weight and importance of the duties and respon- 
 sibilities resting upon them, and with such a noble 
 mission in view, we wish this excellent book God 
 speed, earnestly hoping that the well directed efforts 
 of its gifted author may be properly appreciated, and 
 produce their desired results. 

A Catechism of Familiar Things; their history, aiui 
 the events which led to their discovery. With a short 
 explanation of some of the principal natural pheno- 
 mena, &c. Lindsay & Blakiston, Philadelphia. 

A most excellent volume containing a mass of 
 valuable and reliable information upon subjects which 
 enter into the daily concerns of life. AVe have ex- 
 amined its contents, and with honest sincerity recom- 
 mend the volnme to the attention of our readers in 
 general, and of parents and teachers in particular. — 
 It is just such a work as every man who desires a 
 general knowledge of useful things without the fa- 
 tigue of wading through large volumes to find it, will 
 need. 

The United States, its Power and Progress, by Guil- 
 laume Tell Poussin, late Minister of the Republic of 
 France to the Uniled Slates. First American from 
 the third Paris edition. Translated by E. L. Du 
 Barry, M. D., Surgeon TJ. S. Navy. Philadelphia. 
 Lippincott, Grambo & Co. 

Every thing relating to the advance of our national 
 greatness, is a matter of interest to the American 
 reader. The author, for many years a resident of 
 the United States, had ample opportunities for obser- 
 vation and inquiry, the result of which is the volume 
 before us, embodying much valuable information in 
 relation to the progress we, as a nation have made in 
 agriculture, commerce aud manufactures, and the 
 degree of power we have reached. It abounds in sta- 
 tistical information of much importnnce to the gene- 
 ral reader, as well as many interesting observations 
 on the practical working of our republican institu- 
 tions.
