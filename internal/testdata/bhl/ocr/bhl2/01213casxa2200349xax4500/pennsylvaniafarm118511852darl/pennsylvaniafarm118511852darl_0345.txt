FARMERS PROTECT YOUR HOUSES & BARNS. 

So many accidents )iave happened from lightning during the past 
 Slimmer, thiit every prudent and careful farmer should at once 
 adopt such means as will be most eifectual in preventing tliem — 
 When it is remembered that certain safety may be secured at a 
 very tritliiig expense, it becomes tlie duty of every farmer and 
 good citizen to avail himself tlie proffered means By so doing, 
 he not only secures his property fr<trn fire by lightning, but pro- 
 tects also his family and tho le around him. These are important 
 (umsulerations and should have great weiglit. Those who desire a 
 a Lightning Rod, p'-onounced by the first Scientific men in our 
 country, the very best in use, will find it on application to THOS.
