Not described in the work of F. Andrew Michaux, containing all the Forest Trees discovered in the Rocky

BY THOMAS NUTTALL, F. L. S., 

Slcmbcr of American Philosophical Society, and of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia,^&c. 

[The Whole complete in Six Volumes, Royal Octavo, with 277 plates.] 

The figures in these three additional volumes comprise one hundred and twenty-one plates, fine color- 
 ed, mostly of new subjects, or such as have not been before published in the Sylva, executed with the strict^ 
 est fidelity to nature, under the eye of the Author. Additional remarks on the uses and economy of the 
 Forest Trees of the United States will also be given, so as to complete, as far as possible the requisite infor- 
 mation on this important subject. 

It is quite unnecessary to say anything in praise of MICHAUX'S magnificent work on the Forest Trees 
 of our country — the well established reputation of NUTTALL, the author of the additional part of the 
 work, is a sufficient guarantee for its accuracy and the style of its execution. The platesare finely and care- 
 fully coloured equal to French editions ; and the two works form the most splendid series ever published 
 in America. 

The persons who possessed the former edition of MICHAUX'S work can procure the three addi-ional 
 volumes by NUTTALL separately, and thus complete their copies. 

CONDITIONS. 
 The whole work in six volumes, Royal Octavo, in gilt edges, and gold stamped cloth, or in stamped 
 sheep, will be furnished for forty-five dollars. 

Or in extra full turkey gilt, for fifty-five dollars.
