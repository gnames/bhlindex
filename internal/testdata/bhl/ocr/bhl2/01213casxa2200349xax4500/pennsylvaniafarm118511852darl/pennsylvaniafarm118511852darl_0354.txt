tod by this Lunar influence, possesses in larger pro- 
 portions, the properties on which they subsist. — 
 Animal life is hardly less dependent upon atmospher- 
 ic stimulus than are vegetable productions ; conse- 
 quently -whatever influences the atmosphere, affects 
 animated as well as vegetable nature. I have known 
 three of that unfortunate class of '. insane persons, 
 known as lunatic. In each of the three — the insane 
 despondency, regularly at every full moon, became 
 raging madness. I have also known monomaniacs, 
 whose hallucination,-;, obviously "waxed and waned 
 with the moon." Some corporeal chronic diseases also 
 present the same phenomena. I therefore, at the risk 
 of being classed with the unfortunates referred to 
 above, assert my earnest faith in the venerable doc- 
 trine of Lunar influence, not as exerted upon " meat 
 tubs, crout barrels and cream pots," but upon every 
 living thing which breathes atmospheric moonshine 
 either by means of lungs, or green leaves. 

My belief is not a theory ; but a conviction founded 
 upon long observation and repeated experiment. I 
 am certain of it. It is a generally received fact, and 
 obvious to all observers, that the full Moon does pow- 
 erfully dispel the clouds or watery vapours. Even 
 !Milton sang, 

'' And from before the brig]itiie83 of her face, 
 White break the clouds away." 

Jloon gazing is exceedingly injurious to the eyes, or 
 rather to the nerves, on which depend the power of 
 vision. May not the other nerves, and through them 
 the brain, suffer from the same injudicious practice? 
 Did you ever know an habitual Moon gazer, who did 
 not betray spots of moonshine in his intellect? — 
 I would quietly remind your Correspondent that 

•' There are more things in Heaven and earth, 
 Than are dreamed of in your philosophy." 

I shall next expect to read some wise man's assertion 
 that the mineral known as loadstone, does not attract 
 iron ; and that there exists no influence of attraction, 
 for the needle, to the pole. 

There are few great truths that are not more or 
 less clouded by superstitions, the murky exhalations 
 of the human mind. But we should not attempt to 
 overthrow, or extinguish the Truth, in order to dispel 
 the superstition — inasmuch as superstition is always 
 better than infidelity. Although the Almighty Crea- 
 tor has given to Nature "imperative and inevitable 
 laws," it does daily appear that the acting and 
 counteracting of these laws, one upon the other does 
 produce multifarious, and contradictory effects, upon 
 ephemeral objects— and as far as my observation ex- 
 tends, winds and clouds, and consequently weather, 
 are subject to no special regulation or restriction, still 
 that they are influenced by the Sun and by the Moon, 
 no candid student of Nature will deny.

But the farmer must not content himself with per- 
 mitting the plants he cultivates to appropriate to 
 themselves the alimentary matters merely with which 
 nature has supplied the soil. His efforts must be 
 constantly directed to provide seasonably, additional 
 supplies, not only to replace those of which the grow- 
 ing crops have deprived the soil, but steadily to in- 
 crease the fertility of his laud. This brings us to 
 the subject of manures — with which it is primarily 
 important that the farmer should acquaint himself 
 and be able to avail himself of the'processes which 
 nature herself adopts and pursues for enriching 
 the soil. Thus, in order to furnish the needed 
 supplies of gaseous nutriment, the farmer should pro- 
 vide substances readily convertible into carbonic acid 
 and ammonia ; as he must likewise supply the requi- 
 site substances for the production of the more solid 
 and incombustible matters. Now, in order to secure 
 a constant supply of the incombustible elements, we 
 find in nature a continual reciprocal action and reac- 
 tion of substances on and among themselves, result- 
 ing in their gradual disintegration and solution. — 
 These processes are facilitated and improved by fal- 
 lowing, and by repeatedly stirring the soil. But as 
 nature is constantly varying the kind of plants she 
 produces on the same soil, so that all the various nu- 
 tritious matters contained in it may successively be 
 consumed, she thus plainly intimates to the farmer 
 the utility of making similar changes with the plants 
 ho cultivates, or, in other words, to introduce a sys- 
 tematic rotation of crops. 

In manuring land we should have constant refer 
 ence to the following principles, which have been 
 well established by experience. 

1. Plants in general require nearly all those sim- 
 ple substances which we have enumerated and de- 
 scribed in the former part of this treatise. 

2. They derive their elementary substances in part 
 from the air, and in part from the soil. 

3. Though all plants contain nearly all the sub- 
 stances enumerated, still particular plants require a 
 greater proportion of one of these substances than of 
 another, and on the presence of this greater quantity 
 in an available state, depends the full and thrifty de- 
 velopement of the plant. 

In this view, systematic manuring might be conve- 
 niently arranged under three subdivisions: 1, ma- 
 nuring for the general improvement of the soil: 2, 
 manuring to remedy some particular defect of the 
 soil : 3, manuring to supply merely the special wanta 
 of particular plants or crops. 

Manuring for general improvement is resorted to 
 for the renovation of exhausted land, so as to re-es- 
 tablish its fertility and productiveness. For this pur- 
 pose, stable or barnyard manure is unquestionably 
 cheaper, more generally available, and superior to 
 any other. There are various kinds and qualities of
