tors of our race, although many of them arc so mi- 
 nute as scarcely to be risible to the naked eye. Some 
 of them puncture, with their ovipositor, the eggs of 
 the noxious wheat insects above alluded to, and place 
 in them an egg of their o'\vn which soon hatches, and 
 the little internal egg-parasite there lives, feeds and 
 grows, till it has completed its larval and pupal sta- 

ges, when it emerges a little winged ichneumon. — 
 ther species of ichneumon lay their egg within 
 the larva and pupa of the Hessian Fly and its allied 
 wheat midges, where it hatches, feeds and passes 
 through its several transformations. Although these 
 internal parasites do not kill the larva while feeding 
 on the adipose tissue contained in their bodies, yet 
 they eventually either deprive them of the power of 
 completing their final metamorphosis, or cause them 
 to pass through it in such an enfeebled condition as to 
 be incapable of perpetuating their kind. These im- 
 pediments to the multiplication of the noxious wheat 
 insects must necessarily prevent their increase in a 
 ratio equal to that of their iclmeumon foes. Conse- 
 quently the latter will gain the ascendancy, and then 
 the sudden disappearance of the former is the natu- 
 ral and inevitable result. 

On seeing these ichneumon parasites in great num- 
 bers in wheat iields infested with different species of 
 Oecidomyia, many persons have very naturally at- 
 tributed to them the destrnction of their crop. This 
 conviction, they conceived, was corroborated by the 
 f\ict that these ichneumons have been seen to emerge 
 from the eggs and pupa of the Ilessian Fly and its 
 allied wheat midges. But the remarks already made 
 will give you the true explanation of this adventitious 
 occurrence. 

Immense numbers of butterflies, moths, grass-hop- 
 pers, borers, plant-lice, and a great variety of other 
 insects injurious to vegetation, are, in this way de- 
 stroyed by these parasites. 

Besides the ichneumons, certain other insects of 
 the Hijmenopierous Order are also parasitical. 

Nor are the insect parasites confined to the Ilyme- 
 noptera. Some of the two-winged flies (Diptera) 
 possess the same habits ; hatching and feeding with- 
 in the bodies of various kinds of caterpillars until 
 they are about to complete their final metamorphosis. 

The Predaceous Insects constitute another class 
 that are exceedingly beneficial to the Agriculturist. 
 Among these are' many of the beetles, the sand-wasps; 
 the dragon-flies, the Earwig (Forficula Auricularia) 
 but more especially the Lion of the Aphides, (Chrysopa 
 perla,) several varieties of the Lady Bird (Coccinella,) 
 and some of the Syrphiau. The three last-mentioned 

Sredaceous insects while in the larva, and the Lady 
 iird even in its imago state, prey exclusively on the 
 different species of plant-lice. In conjunction with 
 one or two minute varieties of ichneumon, they are 
 the natural enemies of the Aphis; and where they 
 abound, prove amply sufficient to secure vegetation 
 against its exhausting ravages, notwithstanding the 
 extraordinary rapidity with which it multiplies. 

The Aphis or plant-louse is probably the most pro- 
 lific of all insects. A single female, in the fifth gen- 
 eration, may have a progeny of five thousand million; 
 and sometimes there are fifteen or twenty generations 
 in a year. A most remarkable fact in relation to the 
 propagation of the plant-house, is the sufSciency of 
 one copulation to cause the female descendants of ev- 
 ery subsequent brood, for a twelve-month, to continue 
 the re-production of the species. In the autumn, the 
 sexes pair, and the female lays her eggs ; after which 
 the races for the time becomes extinct. In the spring 
 the eggs are hatched, and the young are all females 
 and wingless. They very soon arrive at maturity, 

and continue to re-produce their kind, not by laying 
 eggs, but by bringing forth their ofispring alive. — 
 Generation thus succeeds generation, without the 
 agency or even existence of a solitary male until au- 
 tumn ; when a brood is hatched eentaining winged 
 individuals of both sexes ; and then the anomalous 
 mode of perpetuating the species, jnst- alluded to, 
 terminates for the season. 

The fecundity of many other insects is also truly 
 wonderful. The Queen Bee lays forty or fifty thou- 
 sand eggs in a year ; — the Ant between four and five 
 thousand ; — the Silk-worm four or five hundred ; — 
 the Wasp three thousand : — and some species of Moth, 
 in the third generation, increase to more than a 
 million. 

When we contemplate the immense number of spe- 
 cies of insects, the countless individuals embraced in 
 each, and their amazing powers of re-production, we 
 cannot wonder at their being every where so abund- 
 ant, and at times so operative in controlling our des- 
 tiny. The earth, the air, the water, teem with innu- 
 merable tribes. The food on which we subsist, the 
 clothes we wear, our mansions, our furniture, our 
 books, all the productions of the vegetable kingdom, 
 in fine every form of organic matter however dimi- 
 nutive or however colossal, are subject to their depre- 
 dations. And though individually so small and 
 insignificant, collectively they are capable of accom- 
 plishing results of vast moment for good and for evil. 
 Suchindeed is theirwonderfulvoracitj'andprocreative 
 powers, that, without the intervention of counteract- 
 ing influences, vegetation would be utterly destroyed. 

In the construction of the L^niverse, the Divine 
 Architect, whose creative conceptions and consummate 
 arrangements display the perfection of wisdom, form- 
 ed it a harmonious whole, amply provided with well 
 regulated checks T;nd balances. So long as these ad- 
 justing powers were not disturbed by extraneous 
 forces interposed by human agency, an inordinate 
 increase of noxious insects was restrained, chiefly by 
 the physical operation of the elements, and by the 
 instinct and natural propensities of certain insectiv- 
 orous animals. Among the latter, may be enumerated 
 many of the smaller quadriqjeds* reptiles,! insectiv- 
 orous birds, J bats, our domestic poultry and the par- 
 asitic and predacious insects to which we have already 
 alluded. The harmony of creation, however, has 
 been interrupted by the wanton destruction of birds 
 and reptiles, and by the intervention of other causes. 
 In consequence of this derangement in the economy 
 of nature, the inseot-vegetable-feeders have become 
 more abundant, and necessarily more destructive. 

To counteract the increase of noxious insects, it is 
 necessary that artificial appliances should be called 
 into requisition. But to employ them successfully, 
 the insects that produce such wide-spread devastation 
 should be known to us, not only in their perfect form, 
 but in every stage of their being. We should know 
 on what food they subsist, whether they take it by 
 suction or mastication — the duration of their larval, 
 pupal and imago periods — and their habits. We 
 should know the size, form, color, and usual number 
 of their eggs — the season of the year when laid, — 
 their usual locality and arrangement, as well as the 
 length of time required for hatching. Finally, we 
 should know their natural enemies, especially those 
 belonging to the insect class. 

How all this information is to be obtained by the 
 farming community, is a question of no little impor-
