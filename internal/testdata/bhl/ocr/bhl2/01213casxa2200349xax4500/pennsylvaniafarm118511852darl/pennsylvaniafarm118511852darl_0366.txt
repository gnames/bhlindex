 The Evergreens of our Capitol. 

Mr. Editor : — Will you be kind enough to suppress 
 your smile at the novelty of the subject of my com- 
 munication, and allow me to say, that it is not to the 
 evergreens within the capital that I refer, but to the 
 evergreens that ornament the grounds around it. 

The fine commanding elevation of these grounds, 
 gives them attraction, which has been benefitted by 
 the ornamental trees that are distributed along their 
 walks, and within their lawns. ■ The ornamental trees 
 of these grounds are mostly deciduous, and of course, 
 have little beauty in winter. But among these trees 
 are a few species of our native evergreens, which do 
 much to enliven the winter scene, and render cheer- 
 ful and attractive, grounds which are occupied at a 
 season when other trees are stripped of their foliage, 
 and only have the feathery flowers of frosts and snow. 

The evergreens of these grounds are comprised of 
 but four species; and these are all natives of our 
 State. The largest of these trees is the White spruce 
 {Abies alba) and the only one of its species or genus 
 which ornaments capitol hill. Where are its fellows, 
 the Black spruce, (A. nigra) with its thick dark 
 shade, and the Hemlock spruce {A. catiadensis) with 
 its light and graceful foliage ? These, too, are natives 
 of our State, and equally ornamental. The hemlock 
 is the tree of the north, and no winter scene is com- 
 plete without it. Pennsylvania may be said to be 
 its southern boundary, and from her high hills to the 
 frozen north, it characterizes nearly every landscape. 

Nearly resembling the spruce, but entirely distinct 
 from it, is the Balsam Fir, (Abies balsamce). This is 
 the dark conical evergreen with resinous terminal 
 buds, that shows to such advantage from the steps of 
 the capitol. There are perhaps a dozen trees of this 
 species here. It is a beautiful tree as an ornament, 
 and is interesting as affording the resin called Cana- 
 dian balsam. 

There is another evergreen with a thick dark head, 
 composed of fan-like branches. This is the White 
 cedar [Cupressus thyoides). In its appearance it re- 
 sembles the Arbor vitoe of the north, and is often mis- 
 taken for that tree. The white cedar is also a native 
 of our State, but is not generally distributed. It be- 
 comes a beautiful tree by cultivation, but is wanting 
 in those graceful airy forms, which distinguish many 
 of our native evergreens. 

The last tree to be found of our evergreens in these 
 grounds is the Savin, [Juniperus sabina.) The singu- 
 larly thick fastigiate branches of this tiee, with its 
 berries clustered among its prickly leaves and matr 
 ted branches, will distinguish it from any other 
 tree on these grounds. It is, however, wanting in 
 stately form, and holds its place as a connecting link 
 between the lofty trees and the lowly shrubs. No 
 other species of the Junipers, or of the Pines, or the 
 Larch, Yew, the Laurel, or the Rhododendron 

are found on these grounds, calling familiar scenes 
 to the minds of those whose homes have been made 
 cheerful by their shade. Might not every species of 
 the evergreens of Pennsylvania bo appropriately 
 grouped on the enclosure that contains our State 
 buildings, giving cheerfulness to the winter scene, 
 and if grouped with the deciduous trees of our native 
 growth, give a panoramic view of the forests of Penn- 
 sylvania. 

If it is a subject of interest to your readers, I will 
 give in some future numbers.a catalogue and descrip- 
 tion of the native forest trees of Northern Pennsylva- 
 nia. Yours, S. Hatden.

Pennsylvania Horticultural Socictj-. 

The stated meeting of this Association was held in 
 the Chinese Saloon, Philadelphia, on Tuesday even- 
 ing, February 17, 1852. 

Gen. Patterson, on assuming the chair, took occa- 
 sion to indulge in some very appropriate remarks, 
 tendering his sincere thanks to the Society for having 
 elected him unsolicited, their presiding officer. Ob- 
 serving that he could forsee tlie many obstacles that 
 would be presented by following in the footsteps of 
 no ordinary man ; that the standard for efficiency in 
 office was now placed so high, and he, from his long 
 absence, being in a great measure, a stranger in the 
 community, hoped that his administration would be 
 looked upon with a lenient eye — that it should be his 
 aim to perform the duties to the best of his abilities, 
 and that until he should become fully acquainted 
 with his new position, he would claim the indulgence 
 of the Society towards any errors of commission or 
 omission that might occur in tho performance of 
 them. 

The display was excellent, for the season, and con- 
 sisted of a large collection of Plants — fine specimens 
 of Azaleas Spirseas, Ericas, Cinerarias, Stocks, etc., 
 from Joseph Lovering's houses. Six large and very 
 handsome Camellias, in half-flower, from Frederick 
 Lennig's collection. A number of select rare plants 
 — the Illiciumreligiosum,Salviagesneriacflora, (choice 
 long bloomer) Camellia j. var. CoUetii, Metrosideras 
 semperflorens, &c., by K. R. Scott, gardener to J. F. 
 Knerr. A large oblong stand of four elevations, cov- 
 ered with moss in which grew luxuriantly some fifty 
 Hyacinths, exhibited by Peter Reabe, was an attrac- 
 tive object. 

The designs of cut flowers and boquets were very 
 creditable. A tall vase-shaped design formed of the 
 finest ilowers, was shown by James Bisset, gardener 
 to James Dundas. A large beautiful cone boquet 
 crowned with a bud of the Victoria, tho forty-sixth 
 from the same place, and a handsome basket of cut 
 flowers, by Thos. Meehan, gardener to Caleb Cope. 
 A fine basket and hand boquet by Thomas Mcghran, 
 gardener to E. Cornelius, and another basket and bo- 
 quet by Alex. Burnett, gardener to Joseph Ripka. 

Collections of cut Camellias were exhibited by 
 John Sherwood, Robert Buist, James Ritchie, John 
 Pollock, gardener to F. Lennig, and Benj. Gullip. 

Fruit — ^Thomas Hancock, Burlington, brought the 
 " Eschasserie" and "Easter Beurre" Pears, and 
 Wm. V. Pettit, the "Niles" Pear. Amost beautiful 
 Apple of good quality, brought from Paris, was pre- 
 sented by Charles Crugan. 

Two large tables of vegetables were shovm by Thos. 
 Meghran, gardener to K. Cornelius, and John Gal-
