 AGENT for Birkiiibines Patent Improved Hydraulic Ram, 
 Force Pumps, Street Stops, Fire Plugs, and Hydraulic Machinery 
 in general. 

The superiority of these Rams over afl others is the great 
 amount oi water thrown to that wasted, the large size they can be 
 constructed, the durability of them, as well as the small amount 
 of attention and repairs they require— many running at present for 
 4 and 5 years, without any repair. At the present time there are 
 in the United States, Cuba, Mexico and South America, about 
 2000 in successful operation. 

The town of Naples in the State of New York is supplied with 
 water by one of these Rams, throwing 20,00(1 gallons a day. Many 
 more could be mentioned if space would permit. 

Persons wishing Rams sent to them by measuring the amount of 
 w^ater their brook or spring affords, per minute, the head and fall 
 they can procure, the elevation to be overcome, and distance to be 
 conveyed, can have the proper Ram and Pipe sent them, with di- 
 rections for putting up. 

T he expense, in most cases, is smaller than a well and pump, — 
 Letters post-paid, will meet with prompt attention. When desired 
 an experienced person will be sent to put them at a small addition- 
 al expense. Lead and Iron Pipe for sale. These Rams are wa 
 nted in every respect. (Jan. 1852. t~

 competition with many others, and they have also received the first 
 (or a monied) Premium at all the County Fairs ^vheiever they 
 have been exhibited for Premium in the State of Pennsylvania, and 
 numerous premiums in other States. To show the public that 
 these Machines are none of the humbugs of the age,

IMPORTANT TO FARMERS! 

JESSE ROBERT'S PATENT UNITED STATES 
 GRAIN AND SEED FAN. 

TO WHICH WAS AWARDED THE 

FIRST PREMIUM 

At the Pennsylvania Agricultural Fair, after a trial the fairness of 
 which could not be disputed. These Fans, the inventor confident- 
 ly asserts, are the only ones now in use entirely adequate to the 
 wants of the farmer. The object of the inventor was not directed 
 alone, to the purpose of cleanmg grain, but of cleaning it and 
 saving at the same time the farmer the trouble of gathering it 
 from the floor, thus not only avoiding labor, but keeping the grain 
 from the dirt on the floor. In addition to this, these Fans, possess 
 greater advantages than those constructed upon the old plan. — 
 These advantages are as follows : 

First. The arrangement is such, that a quick shake can be ob- 
 tained bv turning slowly, thus securing when desired, a less quan- 
 tity of for small seeds. 

Second. When necessary a slow shake can be secured, by rapid 
 turning. This is of immense advantage, as it adapts the fan, to 
 the cleaning of ail kinds of seeds. 

Third, Anew method of adjusting the riddles and screws. This 
 gives the operator the advantage of placing them m any position 
 bes; adapted to accomplish the purposes of a grain Fan. Every 
 riddle and screen has a separate adjustment, so that each one can 
 be fixed at any angle ^vithout the necessity of taking them out. 

Fourth, The grain, instead of falling on the floor, as is usually 
 the case, is discharged, by means of a small trough, into the half 
 bushel, or other measure that may be placed under it. By this ar- 
 rangement the grain is all measured, by the time it is cleaned, 
 thus saving not only labor, but time, and consequently expense, as 
 well as keeping the grain from contact with the dust and diit on 
 floor. For this reason; the fan, can be put in operation anywhere, 
 with as little trouble as the common fans can be used in a barn 
 floor. 

Fifth, The simplicity of their constructions renders them less 
 liable to get out of repair than other mills. 

For the above reasons, we confidently recommend our Fans to 
 public patronage. Privileges to manufacture will be granted on 
 reasonable terms. Satisfactory inf"rmation can be promptly had 
 bv addressinff poitpaid, the subscriber at Norristown, Montgome-

WHERE the subscriber has ooened an extensive assortment of 
 GRASS AND GARDEN SEEDS, of his own raising, OT recent impor- 
 tation, and warranted to be as represented. 

He IS, also, manufacturing all the most approved Agricultural 
 Implements, among which he would call the attention of Farmers 
 to a new article of Plow, of his own invention, called Cast-Steel, 
 Extending Point, Self-Sharpening, Surface and Subsoil Plows, 
 which for durability and easy of draft is yet unequalled. 

The great advantages these Plows possess over all others, are 
 their peculiar construction and the substitution of Cast-Steel inthe 
 place of Cast-Iron, which only wants to be seen to be appreciated; 
 all of which will be sold on the most reasonable prices by
