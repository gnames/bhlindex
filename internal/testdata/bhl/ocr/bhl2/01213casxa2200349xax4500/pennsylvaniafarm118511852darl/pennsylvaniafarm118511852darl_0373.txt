 rests flat upon the front part of the apron B. Ihe gram puEses 
 aloii^ the curved apron B and through the aperture of tne door C 
 and falls upon the 'screen D underneath. The apr.m is carried 
 over the screen D on to the screen underneath, whilst the screen- 
 ings pass through the screen D into tne shoe G underneatn, and are 
 ea°rried alon" the bottom ot the shoe G to the cenlle, wherea spout 
 H receives the screenings and carries them down behind into a

 others ihev have used— and very many ol the best Agriculturists 
 have "iven their certificates that the fact of these machines screeli- 
 in» th^e grain twice by one and the same operation is Ihe very im- 
 provement they have long desired Our farmers will now have 
 the most perfect winnowing machine, winch sircads the gram 
 over the upper screen more perfectly than any "thers now in use. 
 This improvement is so valuable as to have induced the inventors 
 and manufacturers to make applicntion f,ir Letters Patent.
