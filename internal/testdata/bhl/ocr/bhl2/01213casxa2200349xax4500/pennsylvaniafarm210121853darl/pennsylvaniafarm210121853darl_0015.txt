Fruit Culture iu Pennsylvania. 

It is said to be a trait more peculiar to Farmers as 
 a class than others, to be generally indisposed to va- 
 ry from the beaten track of their profession, and slow- 
 to adopt innovations varying from their accustomed 
 routine. While it will bo admitted that this hesita- 
 tion has often saved from trifling loss,it will be found 
 still oftener to have delayed great pecuniary advan- 
 tage. What, with the merchant may often be called 
 a hazardous speculation, involving the loss of fortune, 
 ■with the farmer who introduces a new implement, 
 or some unusual rotation of crops, the disappoint- ticularly of Fruit culture, as we believe there 

portant articles of commerce. The rapid extension 
 of Railroads and the Telegraph, the great increase 
 of steam power both on land and water, the continu- 
 ed and unprecedented Increase of population, partic- 
 ularly in our Large cities, has given an impulse to 
 business, and occasioned a change in the relative 
 sources of supply and demand as regards agricultur- 
 al productions, which it will be well for the farmer 
 to consider and adapt his business to the new state 
 of things. In a very short time there will be a contin- 
 uous Railway communication between Philadelphia 
 and St. Louis, through the heart of our Commonwealth. 
 Already, fat cattle, who used to travel from Indiana 
 and Ohio, to the Atlantic cities, at great expense, and 
 loss of time, and loss of weight, are brought down in 
 cars built for the purpose, and can be rushed in, by 
 a telegraphic communication, advising of a rise in 
 the market, at a few hours notice. Recently thirty- 
 five car loads of live hogs arrived in Philadelphia 
 from the West. It strikes us that the natural course 
 of things, very soon, when our main lines are com- 
 pleted, and intersected as they will be by laterals in 
 all directions, will be to create a competition in the 
 heavy articles of farm produce, such as beef, pork, 
 grain, flour, &o., unfavorable to the farmer near the 
 Atlantic coast where land is from $50 to §150 per a- 
 cre, and that our farmers, particularly in Eastern 
 Pennsylvania, should avail thomslves of their prox- 
 imity to Philadelphia,now with a population of half a 
 million, and devote more attention than hitherto to cei- 
 tain perishable articles, which do not so well bear long 
 carriage, such as fruits, vegetables, dairy products, 
 butter, milk, Poultry, &e. We believe these to be far 
 more profitable now, than f;ittening cattle or raisin f 
 grain. We wish to speak, however, at present, par- 

ment from the experiment, if there is any, 
 but trifling inconvenience, and often no loss whatev- 
 er. The channels and pursuits of business are con- 
 tinually changing. New markets and means of com" 
 munication are opening. Commodities unthought of 
 some few years since, now constitute active and im- 

product of the soil, in which the supply is eo far 
 short of the demand at this time and for some years 
 past, and which will so well repay, for interest on 
 cost of land, labor and expense of marketing, as the 
 eultiv.ation of cfioice Fruit. We speak of all kinds of 
 Fruits, apples, pears, peaches, plums, quinces, che
