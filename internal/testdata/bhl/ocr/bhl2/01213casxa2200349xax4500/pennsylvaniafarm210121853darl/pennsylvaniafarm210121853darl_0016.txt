ries, raspberries, strawberries, blackberries, gooseber- 
 ries, lie. Not that wo recommencl every farmer to 
 go into the cultivation of all these, but only that they 
 will all pay a handsome profit, and that each one 
 must judge for himself, from his soil, location and 
 facilities of access to martet, which or how many of 
 them it will be most profitable to cultivate. They 
 v.ill always sell in Philadelphia, and in many of our 
 inland towns, there is a better market, the supply be- 
 ing poorer and the prices higher than in the city. — 
 We speak now of cultivating fruit as a regular branch 
 of business, giving it the same attention as corn or 
 potatoes, selecting the best varieties of each, and pur- 
 suing it properly and scientifically, from the planting 
 of the tree, the care of it,which involves judicious 
 pruning, manuring and cultivating of the soil, to the 
 final preserving, gathering and marketing the crops- 
 It is customary now to see the orcliard, and fruit gar- 
 den consisting together of one-quarter or one-half 
 an acre, the most neglected part of the farm. Ap- 
 ples are apples, and a tree from a nursery crammed 
 into a small hole, and often planted in a tough sod, 
 and allowed to take its chance, if it has escaped be- 
 ing broken down by the cattle, at the end of ten or 
 twelve years is at last visited by the owner, and if 
 he finds no fruit, or perhaps some knotty, knurly 
 specimen, calculated to set one's teeth on edge to look 
 at, — Fruit culture is pronounced at once unprofitable, 
 and that there is nothing like the good old rotation 
 of corn, oats and wheat. While hundreds of acres 
 have been, and are being planted out in New York 
 and the Eastern States, and many thousands of bar- 
 rels of apples have been shipped the present fall 
 to Europe, the systematic cultivation of fine fruit as 
 a material item in the business of the farm, may be 
 said hardly to have commenced in Pennsylvania. — 
 We believe our soil and climate as favorable for it as 
 elsewhere; our different Horticultural Exhibitions 
 prove' this and show what can be done. To he profitable 
 however, it must be attended to properly, not only 
 the varieties to be of the best, but the specimens as 
 large and fine as can be produced. The price of Pen- 
 nook and Grindstone apples, the Hedge and Bell and 
 Choke pears, and hard Cling peaches, must not be 
 considered evidence of the profits of fruit culture. 
 We have seen this season in Philadelphia, Duchesse 
 d'Angouleme and Bartlett pears selling from 18 to 25 
 cents each, Beurre Diels 12J cts., fine Seckles 3 cts., 
 ■while inferior varieties were dull at 75 cts. to §1 00 
 per bushel, and the same relative prices will hold 
 good with apples and all other fruit. We have nev- 
 er known the time when really fine fruit would not 
 sell well, and believe that more can be realized from 
 a few acres occupied in this way — in many instances 
 than from the whole produce of a farm, with any 
 ordinary rotation of crops. There is no danger of 
 the eating of luscious fruit going out of fashion. Not 
 only is our domestic consumption very great and con- 

tinually increasing, but there is also increasing rap- 
 idly a large demand for export, and the coast trade. 
 Hundreds ot barrels of apples have been shipped 
 this last fall from Philadelphia, for Charleston and 
 Savannah in the steamers, now plying regularly, and 
 our exchanges inform us that over 6000 barrels 
 went to Europe in three of the steamers from New 
 York, and which brought, (the best quality) from $6 
 to §9 per barrel, the freight charged being only §1 20 
 each. Baldwin apples and White Doyenne pears have 
 been shipped to the East Indies, and arrived in fine 
 condition; and also apples, peaches, and even straw- 
 berries to the West Indies. The introduction of 
 steam on the ocean, and the ice house, have removed 
 the obstacles to transporting fruits safely to foreign 
 countries. In respect to choice pears, it seems use- 
 less to speculate about a foreign demand, when we 
 are not half supplied at home, and will not be for 
 years; but there is no doubt that their exportation, 
 particularly to England, will become an item of great 
 profit and importance. The English climate is unfa- 
 vorable to many kinds of fruit; apples, pears, and 
 peaches, especially, being too moist to develop and 
 mature those saccharine juices, on which its excel- 
 lence so much depends. The regular quotation of 
 pears in Convent Garden markot,London, is for peara 
 ?1 to S3 per dozen. Peaches 6 to 8 cents each. — 
 Fruit culture, like any other business, requires to 
 be successful, judgement, intelligence, and energy in 
 its management. Not only must the best varieties 
 be selected and properly cultivated, but a supply in 
 season and out of season must be furnished for the 
 market, and for this a properly constructed and well- 
 ventilated Fruit room or cellar is absolutely necessary. 
 The merchant does not force his goods to sale on a 
 dull and falling market; but with wise foresight antici- 
 pates the season of comparative scarcity, and realizes a 
 four-fold profit. So it must be with the cultivator of 
 Fruit. Apples a few weeks ago were selling for 
 SI 25 per barrel, now they will bring that much per 
 bushel. Winter Nelis, Glout Morcean, Beurre d'A. 
 remberg pears will sell now at almost any price. 

With the view of showing what has been done else- 
 where, and to give some idea of what may be done in 
 Pennsylvania, we have collated below a few statistics 
 of Fruit culture. One small township in Massachu- 
 setts, has raised, the present season, 14,000 barrels of 
 apples, which sold at an average of |2 per barrel. 
 An apple orchard, chiefly of the Rhode Island Green- 
 ing, of one acre, in Wayne county, New York, pro- 
 duced, in 1847, 200 barrels of selected Fruit. Anoth- 
 er one in the same county of 3J acres. 650 barrels. 
 Robert L. Pell, of Ulster county. New York, has rais- 
 ed from 4 to 6000 barrels of Newtown Pippin apples 
 in one season, which have brought, in New York, $6 
 per barrel, and in London, from SIO to §12. Dr. Un. 
 derhill of New York, has a vineyard on the Hudson, 
 of 20 acres, and sends some thousands of baskets of
