PRIZE ESSAY— ON ABORTION IN COWS. 

[concluded rROM PAGE 276.] 
 III. Camrn which, influencing the system or a part 
 of it, act through it on tlie uterus. — In many parts of 
 the country, a bolief exists that abortion i:j coxtaicious. 
 Fruni extensive observation and inquiry, we find tliis 
 opinion founded on the fact, that when abortion once 
 commences in a herd of cows, it frequently affects 
 them in considerable numbers. Whilst we must re- 
 member that this is net invariably the case, we are 
 at the same time bound to confess that unless abor- 
 tion be clearly dependent upon some temporary or 
 accidental cause, it very frequently befalls a number 
 of cows in the same stock the same season. In this, 
 however, there is nothing to establish its coiitn-ious 
 character, for many diseases well-known to be di'sti- 
 tute of contagious properties will occasionally prevail 
 very extensively among various kinds of animals. 
 Much more than the simple extensive prevalence of 
 a disease is required to prove its contagious nature : 
 we must show, 

a. That animals subjected to its supposed influ- 
 ence are affected in greater numbers than others ; 
 thus, on introducing an animal or animals affected 
 with a disease among healthy ones, the latter to a 
 gr eater or less extent, within a certain time, are af- 
 fected by the same disease. 

h. That the separation of diseased from non-dis- 
 eased animals has a perceptible effect in arresting ex- 
 tensions of the malady. 

c. That those animals earliest and most closely 
 connected with the sick, are first affected. 

d. That large numbers of animals remain unaf- 
 fected so long as they do not mix with those which 
 are diseased, although they live in the same building 
 or neighborhood inhabited by those among whom the 
 disease existed. 

Now, admitting that abortion in its ordinary occur- 
 rence is adisease, and although, as ims been stated, 
 it may be induced by causes of various kinds (some 
 of which have been named,) yet, having once occur- 
 red among a stock of cows, its further extension 
 among them, does, at first view, seem conformable to 
 the conditions here laid down as proving the charac- 
 ter of diseases to be contagious. For cases can be 
 adduced to show that when one or two cows in a herd 
 have, from whatever cause, cast their calves, others 
 pregnant will do the same : and that on a careful and 
 early separation of those first aborting from others 
 still pregnant, the latter remain unaffected. 

There are, however, other considerations to be en- 
 tertained here. In contagion, we assume, that mat- 
 ter in some tangible form, or minutely and invisibly 
 diffused in a, gaseous condition, emanating from a 
 diseased animal, passes to some absorbing surface in 
 the body of a healthy one, and there becoming fur- 
 ther developed, produces disease also. We think the 
 strongest advocate of contagion, in the present in- 
 stance, is not prepared to assert that the discharge 
 incident to abortion can be transmitted from the body 
 of one cow to another in the ordinary course oi things; 
 and even if such transmission could be effected, we 
 can hardly imagine how abortion could be induced 
 thereby. It is, however, said that the odor attendant 
 upon these discharges, on being smelled by pregnant 
 cows, causes them to abort. But surely this smell 
 cannot act directly upon the uterus, for this organ in 
 itself possesses no power of detecting varieties of 
 odor. We do know, however, that cows are especial- 
 ly acute in detecting, by the sense of smell, when 

one of their companions has calved, either prema- 
 turely or at the full time of gestation. If a birth 
 take place in the pasture, the cowi will collect round 
 the locality at the time, and for many days, even 
 weeks subsequently, will visit and smell at it with a 
 degree of apparent curiosity and pleasure. If a cow 
 calve in the house, other cows are at once aware of 
 the fact, as is shown by their looking about them, 
 snufiing their noses, and by making the fondling 
 noise usually uttereil touards their young. It is, al- 
 so, interesting to uotioo that if a cow at or near her 
 full time of gestation, calve among a number of her 
 pregnant companions, several of them will usually 
 bring forth their young very soon afterwards,although 
 appearances and record might have led us to 
 suppose that their times of parturition would have 
 b>ru deferred, instead of so closely corresponding. 
 S'"in;i: then that cows are aware of the parturition 
 ■ it tlieir companions, how do they become so? From 
 noticing them at ttie time, and for various other 
 reasons, we believe that the organ of small is the 
 cli.annel or medium through which the impression or 
 sense is communicated. 

It remains, then, to inquire whether the sensation 
 produced by a peculiar smell or odor can, by "influ- 
 encing the system, or a part of it, act through it upon 
 the uterus," so as to cause abortion. Preparatory to 
 this short inquiry (and as illustrating the kind of ac- 
 tion to which wo would refer) we may observe, that 
 in the animal body, we often find a cause of disease 
 acts through one part of the system upon another. 
 For instance, a person with an irritably constituted 
 stomach is seized with nausea or vomiting on smell- 
 ing a peculiar odor or on seeing some disgusting ob- 
 ject; here the eye becomes first cognizant of a cause 
 which operates subsequently upon the stomach. A 
 person with irritable bowels becomes^affected with 
 purging on "taking coM," or from having wet feet. 
 Here cold, as a cause, acts first on the external sur- 
 face, and operates subsequently on the bowels. Al- 
 most every animal has some part of the body more 
 susceptible than the rest, and especially liable on 
 that account to become affected by the causes of dis- 
 ease. On this depends the difference of constitution 
 seen in the human being, and also in the lower ani- 
 mals. At the same time, we must remember that 
 the various organs of the body, when in a state of 
 health, act in obedience to certain stimuli ; air is the 
 stimulus to part of the respiratory action, and food 
 is the stimulus to the digestive organs. If such stim- 
 uli are unnatural in amount or quality, they induce 
 disease ; impure air causes affections of the lungs, 
 and food undue in amount or bad in quality produces 
 diseases of the stomach and bowels. 

The uterus and ovaries of the young virgin female 
 of any animal, are organs of comparatively small 
 size, and not being concerned in the performance of 
 functions essentially necessary to the vitality of the 
 body, they receive but a small supply of blood and 
 nervous influence. At the adult period of life these 
 organs, having attained their full development, exer- 
 cise upon the system an influence of the most impor- 
 tant kind. In the cow, at periods of oestrum, they 
 receive a greater amount of blood, and their nervous 
 susceptibilit'' is greater than heretofore. If she be 
 allowed intercourse with the male, conception fol- 
 lows ; the presence of the foetus maintains a stimu- 
 lus in the uterus which is continued till the time of 
 parturition ; the quantity of blood determined to it 
 is enormous, and the peculiar kind of nervous influ- 
 ence required to take cognizance of its functions pro- 
 gressively increases as gestation advances. The gra- 
 vid uterus then is the seat of a healthy excitement.
