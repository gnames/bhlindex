ABORTION IN COWS. 

Jancart, 

If the liquor amnii has been partially evacuated, 
 and the animal, by arching her back and tail, by ly- 
 ing down and suddenly rising again, (as Tvell as by 
 exhibiting other usual symptoms,) seems actually in 
 labor, the treatment just advised would not only be 
 useless, but highly injurious also. Matters in this 
 case must take their course, for it is only in the ab- 
 sence of the symptoms of immediate labor that blood- 
 letting and the other means recommended can be 
 employed. 

_ It abortion takes place at an early stage of gesta- 
 tion, the premonitory symptoms are rarely noticed, 
 the foetus with its membranes, will be expelled with- 
 out occasioning much inconvenience to the cow, and 
 cestrum will occur a few days afterwards. The ani- 
 mal, however, should not be allowed access to the 
 male, for her organs of generation are in a state of 
 morbid excitement, and connection with the bull un- 
 der such circumstances is seldom followed by concep- 
 lion. The cow should be tied in the house until 
 the oestrum has disappeared, and should be carefully 
 watched for its next recurrence, which, if taking 
 place at the natural period, she may be put to the 
 bull and kept perfectly quiet a few days longer. If 
 a ;cow has irregular periods of oestrum, such as at 
 every ten days or a fortnight, she is almost always 
 the subject of some ovarian or uterine disease, and 
 on no account should such an animal be allowed to 
 have connection with the male, or to be in company 
 with pregnant cows, or cows which are taking thebuU 
 in ordinary regularity. Such beasts mostly go bel- 
 lowing about the pasture for days together, they grad- 
 ually grow thick and coarse in the head and neck, 
 and their outer organs of generation lose much of 
 the natural appearance ; they are hurtful nuisances, 
 and should be fed if they will feed, or disposed of it 
 some other way, being utterly worthless for breeding 
 purposes. 

When the cestrum returns in a cow regularly eve- 
 ry three weeks, and she takes the bull each period 
 without conception following, and we have reason to 
 believe that no sexual deficiency exists in the male, 
 she may be put under treatment which will ensure 
 pregnancy. She should not be allowed connection 
 with the male until the latter part of the period of 
 heat, and after taking the bull she should be bled 
 freely, and confined several days after oestrum has 
 disappeared. During the time of being kept up, a 
 moderate amount of her usual food must be allowed: 
 no medicine of any kind is needed, but, if the owner 
 please, he may from time to time throw a pailfull of 
 cold water on the hinder parts of the animal, especi- 
 ally over the organs of generation. No cow after ta- 
 king the bull, and while still in heat, should be allow- 
 ed in pasture with other pregnant cows ; her society 
 unsettles them, and by smelling at her they receive 
 impressions whif S act injuriously. When an indis- 
 position to conceive, or, aa it is sometimes termed, 
 "breaking bull," exists extensively in a stock, and 
 the cows in numbers are continually coming in heat, 
 they should all of them be confined in the house till 
 cestrum is about going off, then be put to the male, 
 and confined for a day or two more. If the farmer 
 thinks proper he may bleed them; this, beyond less- 
 ening their milk for a few days, will do no harm. 
 The medicines which farriers and old women some- 
 times recommend to make cows "hold to the bull," 
 or conceive, are unworthy of dependence. 

A cow which has cast calf several times in succes- 
 sion, acquires such a habit, (if it may so be termed,) 
 of doing so, that it is exceedingly difficult to over- 
 come. Notice should be taken of the period of each 
 abortion, and in her nest pregnancy, a fortnight or 

so before the accession of this period, she should be 
 bled, tied up, and treated as before advised for pre- 
 vention. She should bo confined for some time, so 
 ensure the utmost quietness. If such measures 
 are not effectual towards promoting what is desired, 
 it is best to feed or sell the animal. Such cows as 
 this, on being taken to another farm or fresh herd, 
 will very often take the bull and carry their calves 
 to the full period of gestation. 

In those unhappy instances where abortion to a 
 destructive extent occurs in a stock of cows ioryears 
 successively, and seems rather to increase than to di- 
 minish in prevalence, we have to contend with the 
 pest in its most formidable character. A breeder or 
 farmer does not like to sell animals to which he at- 
 taches great value, yet by separating the affected from 
 the non-affected cows, and by adopting every other 
 remedial and preventive plan of treatment, which 
 his own experience or professional knowledge can 
 suggest, he sees matters becoming worse season after 
 season. We believe, that under the circumstances, 
 nothing short of changing his afiected stock, by feed- 
 ing or selling them oflf, will be of any service. He 
 may do so at a great sacrifice, but it will be less than 
 the one which from appearances he will in all proba- 
 bility incur, by having every year a number of cows 
 supplying neither calves, nor much amount of milk. 
 The longer this decisive step is delayed after fairly 
 trying other methods of prevention, the worse mat- 
 ters usually become; and hence the importance du- 
 ring two or three years, when abortions are few in 
 number, and confined to much the same cows, of 
 feeding or otherwise disposing of these animals. 

If abortion be confined mainly to animals in high 
 condition, it is generally fair to infer that over-feed- 
 ing is the predisposing cause, and the other cows 
 still pregnant may, at all events, be more limited in 
 diet, li, on the other hand, it seems to depend on 
 poverty in condition, a more liberal supply of food 
 is the obvious remedy. When it is owing to the irri- 
 tation or exhaustion caused by other diseases, such 
 as consumption, dysentery, murrain, &c., there is lit- 
 tle probability of any preventive measures being at- 
 tended with success, even if it were worth while to 
 employ them. 

2. Remedial Treatment. â€” It has been stated, that 
 when abortion occurs during the first few weeks of 
 gestation, it does not seem to occasion much inconve- 
 nience or constitutional disturbance to the cow. At 
 this period, as the foetus is of small size, the mem- 
 branes are also in a rudimentary state of develop- 
 ment, and are not so firmly attached to the uterus aa 
 they ultimately .become ; on this account they are 
 readily expelled with their contents. Little treat- 
 ment is required in cases of this kind, beyond keep- 
 ing the afi'eoted cow from her companions, and also 
 from the male. 

Abortion occurring subsequently to the ninth or 
 twelfth week, is a more serious matter. Here the pre- 
 monitory symptoms may also have escaped notice, and 
 the foetus may have been expelled without any diflS- 
 oulty, but the placenta is almost always retained, 
 and becomes an oifeusive source of annoyance to the 
 cow and her attendants. There is sometimes very 
 little of it hanging from the vulva, and a slow decom- 
 position, attended by discharge of a very peculiar 
 and most offensive odor, is established in the protru- 
 ding portion, as well as that retained in the uterus. 
 Decomposition is commenced in some cases before 
 abortion takes place, and little or none of the cleans- 
 ing will make its appearance for some days after the 
 expulsion of the foetus. The presence of this now 
 foreign body in the uterus and vagina induces an
