Portal)le Grain Mills. 

Now that horse-powers have become so common, 
 we think a good and not too expensive portable mill 
 for grinding and mixing grain for horses, cattle, 
 hogs, (Sec., and which could be used on the barn floor, 
 ■would find a ready sale. The one-tenth toll, and the 
 loss of time of teams and men in going some miles, 
 makes an item well worth saving. Such a macliine 
 might also embrace the making flour and meal for 
 family use. If they are in use any where we should 
 be glad to have a cut and description for tlie Fai-m 
 Journal. 

J. S. L. is received. A better plan would be to mow 
 the weeds down after harvest, before they have gone 
 to seed and exhausted the ground. By "sleet time" 
 the mischief is all done. 

Analysis of Sjils, 

That the inorganic constituents of OHr cultiv.ited 
 crops as developed in their ash must be derived from 
 the soil, and that where it is defective in these, a de- 
 fective crop is the necess.-try result, are facts which, 
 though not new, are only beginning to be fully ap- 
 preciated by the generality of our farmers. As rea- 
 sonable is it to expect a mechanic to manufacture 
 his wares without giving him the maicriah of which 
 they are composed, as to expect a crop of wheat, In- 
 dian corn or potatoes whore the soil is destitute of 
 phosphoric acid, potash, magnesia, and other elemen- 
 tary constituents which analysis has proved to enter 
 largely into their composition. Agricultural chem- 
 istry has shown us what most of our cultivated crops 
 are composed of, and all that is wanting to an en- 
 lightened system of cultivation, is for the practical 
 farmer to make himself acquainted with the compo- 
 sition of his soil so as to adapt the one to the other, 
 and thus be able to apply such food for plants ia the 
 shape of manures, and such only as are wanting, or 
 may result from chemical combinations therein. 

One invariable rotation of crops, the uniform ap- 
 plication of the same manures, prevails in this dis- 
 trict of country, and in most others through Penn- 
 sylvania, Barn-yard manure applied to the wheat 
 crop in the fall of tlie year, after being exposed fur 
 nine or ten months to the weather, and an occasional 
 drossitigof lime and pi aster .are the three great specifics 
 for all kinds of crops and all soils. That this system 
 often results in large products of corn, oats, wheat, 
 DOtatoes, &c., is an evidence of the natural fertility 
 and absorbent power of the soil, and of the value of 
 these materials, but it does not prove that their in- 
 discriminate application, in the way they are u.sed, 
 is, in all cases, the most profitable one. Nothing ia 
 more common than to hear practical farmers dif- 
 fer in opinion as to the use of lime and jilaster. 

One has told us that after using the latter for sev- 
 eral years, he had entirely abandoned it, never hav- 
 ing observed the least benefit. Another, within a.
