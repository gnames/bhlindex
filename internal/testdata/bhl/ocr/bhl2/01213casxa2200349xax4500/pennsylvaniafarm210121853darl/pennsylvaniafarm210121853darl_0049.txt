illustration of the great advantages of cutting food 
 for stock. Such evidence of what has been done, is 
 worth pages of theory in convincing farmers of the 
 great loss they sustain in feeding hay and fodder un- 
 cut. Not only will one-half or two-thirds in quanti- 
 ty be .sufficient, but there is a great saving in respect 
 to waste. Those of us who have been used to feed- 
 ing cattle in barn-yards, out of cribs, know that not 
 less than about one sheaf to each animal is a suffi- 
 cient allowance, and that when either corn-fodder or 
 hay is fed whole, a considerable portion is dragged 
 out over the yard and lost. 

Hay is now worth from $18 to $25 per ton, and by 
 this plan of feeding corn-fodder, a saving of some 
 tons and the price of several machines may be effected 
 in one winter. We have found, in our own experi- 
 ence, that when cirn-fodder is fed, merely cut, with- 
 out crushing, a very considerable amount is left un- 
 eaten. The sharp and tough edges of the stalk do not ad- 
 mit of proper mastication, and, indeed, is apt to make 
 sore mouths. The machine used by Enos Smedley 
 is of Potts' patent. Urmy's patent is said to be able 
 to cut and crush from sixty to one hundred bushels 
 per hour. Our readers will find in another place an 
 excellent article, from the Michigan Farmer, on sow- 
 ing corn for fodder broad-cast or in drills. We have 
 tried this ourselves, and found it a most valuable 
 food, especially for cows and young stock. We 
 consider it preferable to hay. When not allowed 
 to go to ear, the stalks abound in rich saccharine mat- 
 ter, and by the experiments of William Webb, 
 of Wilmington, Delaware, who manufactured sugar 
 from it, it would appear to be equal in this particular, 
 to the sugar cane. 

Agricultural Societies. 

One of the most cheering evidences of the progress 
 of agricultural improvement in Pennsylvania, may 
 be found in the very great increase in the number 
 of these within two or three years past. In a large num- 
 ber of counties they have been established within that 
 time, and have held spirited and and satisfactory an- 
 nual exhibitions. Where county associations have 
 been found to be impracticable, we observe agricul- 
 tural clubs, for local districts or townships have been 
 formed, which promise to be highly useful. One of 
 these latter has been lately organized in Tredyffrin 
 township, in this county, through the public spirit of 
 our friend, Dr. Walker. They meet at stated times, 
 and have a room in a central location, supplied with 
 agricultural periodicals and standard works on 
 agriculture and horticulture, and propose forming a 
 cabinet of specimens of newly introduced field and 
 vegetable seeds for inspection and distribution among 
 farmers. The interchange of views, and discussions 
 on practical subjects, comparisons of modes of culti- 
 vation and general farm management which will ne- 
 cessarily result from such clubs, can but be highly 

useful, and we hope to see them multiplied in differ- 
 ent directions through the State. They answer an 
 excellent purpose in the different townships as auxil- 
 iaries to county societies. 

We are desirous to obtain a list of the various 
 county agricultural societies in Pennsylvania, for 
 publication in the Farm Journal. We think it im- 
 portant on seveial accounts, such a list should be 
 made out. It will bring more fully to view the rela- 
 tive condition of agriculture in different sections, and 
 the progress of improvement, and bo valuable for re- 
 ference in obtaining statistical information. 

We shouldjbe much obliged if the secretaries or 
 other persons who have the means of correct informa- 
 tion, will forward us an account of their county soci- 
 ety ; the year it was established, the number of ex- 
 hibitions which have been held, and a list of the 
 president, secretaries and other officers. 

Salt for our Domestic Animals. 

BV LEVI BARTLETT, WARNER, N. H. 

Farmers in the same neighborhood differ widely 
 in their views upon the most common farm opera- 
 tions, such as the depth of ploughing; the width 
 and angle of the furrow slice ; the application of ma- 
 nures whether it should be spread upon the land be- 
 fore ploughing, or after this operation, &c., &c. It 
 is less strange that they should entertain different 
 opinions in regard to other rural matters, not so pal- 
 pably visible. Thus, while one farmer uses many 
 bushels of salt annually for his farm stock, another 
 scouts the idea of its use in either large or small do- 
 ses. Some farmers practice salting their hay at the 
 rate of one bushel of salt per ton. Mr. Pell, of Ul- 
 ster Co., N. Y., several years ago, gave, in some ag- 
 ricultural paper, an account of his method of curing 
 hay ; which was, to get it in very green, and sprinkle 
 on it one bushel of salt to each ton of hay. This 
 statement called out several farmers in reply ; and 
 one of them pronounced "his practice actually cruel" 
 to thus compel his cattle to eat such a quantity of 
 salt. Some farmers use but two, others four quarts 
 to the ton of hay, while, perhaps, a very large ma- 
 jority use none upon their hay, at the time ol stor- 
 ing it in their barns. Thus, practical farmers disa- 
 gree. How are we to decide the question, whether 
 cattle should bo supplied with salt, or not ? Reason- 
 ing from the instincts of our domestic animals, and 
 tlie researches in animal physiology, I can come to 
 no other conclusion than this : that the health and 
 thrift of our farm stock, in many sections of the 
 country, depend much upon a full supply of salt, 
 and that the pecuniary interests of the farmer require 
 that he should, in some form, afford this supply. 

The Creator has given to man reasoning powers 
 and speech, by which he can communicate his wants, 
 his likes land dislikes, and orally express them. To 
 animals he has given instinct, which guides them in 
 the selection of their food, and, in a good degree, 
 teaches them to avoid that which is hurtful or poi- 
 sonous. The almost universal relish our domestic 
 animals manifest for salt, indicates most clearly, I 
 think, the necessity of their being supplied with it ; 
 and this desire for salt is not confined to our domes- 
 tic animals alone. The salt licks of the west were 
 formerly much frequented by the buffalo, elk, deer, 
 and the huge mastodon and other animals, for th '
