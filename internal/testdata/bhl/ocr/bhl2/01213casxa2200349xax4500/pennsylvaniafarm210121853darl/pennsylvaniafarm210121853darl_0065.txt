John Shenli, of Manor township, Lancaster county, 
 supposed to be from the Virgalicn or Butter. J. B. 
 Garber, page 197, present vol. of Farm Journal, to 
 whose article the reader is referred, says, "the tree 
 is a vigorous and strong grower, ftxr out grovj'ing the 
 old butter pear, and in comparison with that fine old 
 and now almost extinct variety, is superior in every 
 respect; the tree is large and more thrifty, the fruit 
 larger and if possible more luscious, and the tree a 
 great bearer in a favorable soil and situation. It ri- 
 pens from the middle of August to the middle of 
 September, according to the season. 

Fig. 2, Chancellor. This is a fine variety, which 
 has been exhibited for several seasons at tlie exhi- 
 bition of the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society, 
 Philadelphia. The original tree, we visited last fall, 
 on the premises of W. Chancellor, on School House 
 Lane, near Germantown, is of large size, and appears 
 healthy and vigorous. It has probably stood there 
 for the last 50 years, and is said to bear abundant- 
 ly. We annex description by Dr. Brinkle : 

"Fruit large, nearly four inches long by three in 
 widtli ; form obovate, or obovate-pyriform ; skin 
 green, covered with minute brown specks, and some I 
 russet blotches, with occasionally, though rarely, a I 
 faint speckled brown cheek ; stem one inch Ion", !
