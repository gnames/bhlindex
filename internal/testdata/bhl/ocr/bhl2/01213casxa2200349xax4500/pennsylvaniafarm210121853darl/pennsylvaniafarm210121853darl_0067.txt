child, a practical gardener of eminence, mentions he 
 has had the same roots blow again in four years time, 
 Und particularly recommends that care should be 
 taken to prevent the leaves being bitten by the frost, 
 and by no means to cut them off which weakens the 
 plant so much that thej may bo kept twenty years, 
 and never produce a fljwer. Miller recommends for 
 their roots, the following compost: Take a third 
 part of fresli virgin earth from a pasture ground 
 which is light; then put near an equal part of sea 
 sand, to which should be added rotten dung; and 
 sifted lime rubbish, of each an equal quantity. The 
 great business in the culture of this flower, next to 
 a proper soil and situation, seems to consist in giving 
 the plant iis much air as possible, and in preserving 
 the foliage in winter from being injured by the frost. 
 They are grown in this Island in beds of many hun- 
 dreds together, requiring but little care; the flower- 
 ing bulbs, as soon as the buds make their appearance, 
 are sent to England in great quantities; packed in 
 boxes with moss, when, upon their arrival, they are 
 planted in pots of sand or light loam; they blossom 
 in September, the flowers continue about a month 
 . in perfection, and though inodorous, make up for 
 that deficiency, by the resplendent beauty of their 
 colors. The description given by Dr. Douglas ac- 
 cords so well with this superb flower, I cannot do 
 better than give it in his own words: "Each flower 
 when in its primo,looks likeafiuegoldtissue wrought 
 on a rose-colored gi'ound; but when it begins to fade 
 and decay, looks more lik':- a silver tissue, or what 
 they call a pink-color. When we look upon the 
 I flower in full sun shine, each leaf appears to be 
 • studded with thousands of little diamonds, sparkling 
 I and glittering with a most surprising and agreeable 
 i lustre; but if we view the same by candle light, 
 these numerous specks or spangles, look more like 
 ' fine gold dust." In Guernsey, the same bulb is of- 
 j ten known to flower two succeeding years, but this 
 does not generally happen. It is mentioned both 
 by Kaempper and Thunburg that the Japanese re- 
 gard the root as poisonous.

It 18 a common complaint among the ladies in our 
 neighborhood, that they bave no success in raising 
 annuals from seed. The reason we would assign for 
 the failure is, that they are too late in sowing them; 
 perhaps, a few practical hints on the subject would 
 bo acceptable at this time. The plan we find 
 m^st successful is to. get a common garden frame 
 or box sometime in March, place it sloping towards 
 the south. Seeds of the following varieties we have 
 found very suitable for small gardens: Candy tuft,Rose, 
 Purple & White, Sweet Alyssum, Mignionette, Phlox; 
 Drommondi, Nemophila Insignis Maculata, Dwarf 
 French Marigold, Gorman Aster, ten weak stocks- 

Linnia Elegans, Balsams, Marvel of Peri.. Fill some 
 flower pots within an inch of the top with light rich 
 soil, sow the seed and cover it lightly with tine soil, 
 place them in the frame, keep t e sash closed till 
 the seeds germinate; if the surface of the soil anpears 
 dry, give a slight watering when the plants have 
 grown two or throe inches, fill the frame with good 
 soil to six inches from the glass, plant out the seed- 
 lings two or throe inches apart, give them a watering, 
 close the south end, shade them for a few days till 
 they have taken fresh root, then give them plenty of 
 air on clear days. By this means, good strong plants 
 will be obtained for early blooming. For climbing 
 varieties, we would recommend Sweet Peas, Cypress 
 Vine, Morning Glory, Ipomea Creulea and Coccinea, 
 as very showy and easily obtained by sowi g the 
 seed in the open ground. There arc other things 
 easily obtained and worthy of cultivation, and will 
 remain much longer in bloom than annuals, such a.i 
 Verbenas, of various colors. Petunias, do., Helio- 
 trope, Scarlet Geranium, Scarlet and Blue Sage. It 
 is common to see all things planted together in beds 
 or borders, but they are much more attractive if 
 planted in beds or masses, each kind by itself, con- 
 trasting the colors as much as possible. AVe would 
 also recommend for edgings of flower beds, the Sweet 
 Scented Violet, the Garden Daisy, Dwarf Blue Iris, 
 Thrift or Sea Pink, as very suitable. No garden 
 should be without some Perreniuls, such as Dahlias, 
 Ilolyhocks, Phloxes, Chrysanthemums, Sweet Wil- 
 liams, Pinks and Carnations, Primrose an d Polyan- 
 thus, Snap Dragon, Campanala, Foxglove, and, as 
 yet, nothing has been said about Roses. We will 
 name a few remarkable as free bloomers, Souvenir 
 do Malmason, Mrs. Bosanquet, Pale Blush changing 
 to White,Hermoia,Pink,Monthly Cabbage, Deep Rose, 
 •Julia Fmtenelle, Dark Red, Aggripina, Crimson La 
 Heine, Rose Lilac, Marquis Bocella, Light Pink; the 
 above are hardy bush Roses growing four feet high; 
 for running Roses, we would recommend for cover- 
 ing arbours. Queen of the Prairies, Pink, blooms once 
 a year; for ever blooming varieties, Lady Washing- 
 ton, Pure White, Jaune Desprez, Rosy Buff, Souven- 
 ir de Ausalem, Bright Red, Glorie de Rosamcne, 
 scarlet. In addition to Roses, we would add the dif- 
 ferent varieties of Ilonysuckles, and some flowering 
 Shrubs, especially the following: Woigelia Ros.a, 
 Spire as, Rovesii and Prunifolia are well worthy of 
 room in every flower garden. If these rough notes 
 should be acceptable, perhaps we may oflTor a few re- 
 marks about those beautiful Tulips, Hyacinths, Nar- 
 cissus, Crocus, and Snowdrops, that appear .as soon 
 as the snow is gone.
