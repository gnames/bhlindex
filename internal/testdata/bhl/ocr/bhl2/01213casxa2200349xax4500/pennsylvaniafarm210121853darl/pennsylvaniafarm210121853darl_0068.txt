Mr. Editor: — 

In your last number, I see some 
 very excellent remarks on the culture of fruits, flow- 
 ers and vegetables. Should you think the following, 
 (in my opinion.) necessary accompaniments, to se- 
 cure in the first formation of a place, regularity in 
 the shape of a pleasant landscape, or of a neat flow- 
 er garden worthy of a place, you are welcome to 
 them. To accomplish thisis one thing and to desire it 
 is another. How often do we see owners of property 
 in the country, not to speak of the suburbs of our 
 towns, at a great cost, employing inexperienced men, 
 calling themselves Gardeners, vrho go to great lalior 
 in mard^ring nature, turning that into a stiff, un- 
 Feemly mass, which in the hands of skilful workmen, 
 would have been advantageously and economically 
 made pleasant to the eye, as well as saving money in 
 the purse. 

The most striking success in ornamental Garden- 
 ing, is where the effjrt has been to take advantage of 
 nature and turn her to good account, not to produce 
 Bomothing grotesque and unnatural. Let the pro" 
 prletors of land about improving their grounds, ap- 
 ply to nurseymen, and make them responsible. These 
 often have experienced men in their employ, or can 
 refer to them, by which plan, work would be more 
 judiciously done, and the responsibility lay where it 
 could be borne. 

There are three distinct styles of Gardening, each 
 differing in besign. City or Street Gardening, Subur- 
 ban, and the Landscape style, adapted for country 
 seats. For the first of these I will not travel out of 
 your goodly B.^rough. It is the prevailing practice 
 to have a grass plot interspersed or rather dotted 
 with ruses, chrysanthemums, &c. I like to see these 
 miniature lawns, gveeii, which is always pleasing.but 
 to have the natural beauty of it destroyed, by these 
 strange dottings of plants here and there, with little 
 circles of earth, rising round their roots like mole 
 hills, is certainly not in good taste, and only wants 
 to be noticed to be exploded. 

Do not let me be understood, as wishing to see 
 lawns without such furniture. Nothing is more de- 
 sirable than to have choice and well assorted vari- 
 eties of plants, on these little lawns,alongour streets, 
 but let beds be formed for them, cut with neatness 
 out of the grass, and on these beds clvmp the flowers 
 together. Thus do we secure the grand object, 
 namely, a flower Garden in its proper place, alike 
 proper for the culture of the flowers, and also free 
 from the Gardener's scythe, when mowing the lawn- 
 In a future number I shall take up the proper for. 
 mation of a suburban Garden, and may perhaps ap- 
 approach to the more difficult and wider field for a 
 Landscape Gardener, in the formation, planting and 
 laying out the Grounds for a country seat.

Roses. 

The following remarks on the classification of the 
 rose, with a description of their signs of distinction, 
 may perhaps be of some interest to your readers. 
 They are from the Garten und Blumen Zeitung:— 

M. Carriere divides Roses into seven main classes; 

1. Perpetual or Portland Roses. 

2. Hybrid Perpetuals from Portland. 

3. Hybrid Perpetuals from Bourbon. 

4. Bourbon Roses. 

5. Noisette Roses. 

6. Bengal Roses, 
 v. Tea Roses. 

Signs of Distinction. 

Class 1. — Perpetual or Portland Roses have fine 
 short thorns, which appear very clo.se together, cover 
 the branches almost entirely, and give them a brown- 
 ish appearance. The branches grow erect. The 
 flower-stalks are short and stiff, and each of them 
 supports usually one flower, which has a somewhat 
 lengthened calyx. For example: Duehesse de Ro- 
 han, Julie, Krudner, Bernard, Favorite, and others. 

Class 2. — Hi/bridPerjKtuals, from Portland — These ■ 
 produce erect growing branches, and are covered 
 with hard thorns, which vary in size and strength. 
 They assume the same growth as the Portland Rosea, 
 have likewise a lengthened calyx, but on the top of 
 the branches there are sometimes one, three, or seven' 
 flowers, forming a stiff and erect boquet. Rose de 
 Quatre Saisons may be taken as the type of their 
 srrowth and their flowers ; also. La Reine, Baronne 
 Prevost, Jaques LafBtte, Madame Laffay, Duchess of 
 Sutherland, Am.andine, Louis Bonaparte, Clementine 
 Seringe, Gloire d'Angers, Comt de Montalivet, &c. 

Class 3. — Hi/hrid Perpetiialse, from the Ile-Bour- 
 bon — It seems that plants of this class keep the bal- 
 ance between Perpetual and Bourbon kinds; they 
 approach, however, in appearance, more to the lat- 
 ter. The sepals of the calyx are generally very 
 strongly fimliriated. The rounded form of the calyx 
 is also another sign by which they may be distin- 
 guished from the Portland hybrids. An irregular 
 and intricate position of the branches gives them a ' 
 peculiar appearance. Examples are Clementine De- 
 val, Conite deBobinski, Ernestine deBarantc,Colonel 
 Foissy, GSant des Batailles, Vicomtesse do B-elleval, 

Class 4. — Bourbon Roses — The wood of these 
 smooth ; tlfeir branches are sometimes short, termi- 
 nating with a single flo ■ er. But the buds of some 
 kinds are strong, and produce vigorous shoots, on tliB 
 tops of which appear from three to twelve flowers. 
 The thorns at the base are strong, curved, and placed 
 at some distance from each other. The sepals 
 oval, rounded, strong, fimbria' ed, smooth and dark- 
 green. The calyx is rounded. It often happens thai 
 the branches of some kinds in this class grow hor 
 zontally. Examples : La Reine des He Bourbon, 
 Madame Desprez, Charles Souchct, Paul Joseph, 
 Souvenir de la Malmaison, Souvenir du 4 Mai, 
 mond, Mrs. Bnsanquet, &c. 

Class 5. — Noisette Roses — Their foliage has much 
 resemblance to that of the Tea Roses, but their 
 branches are more %igorous, much longer, and termi- 
 nated with numerous flower buds. The bark i)( the 
 branches is smooth and thorny. Examples : La- 
 raarque, Ophyrie, Aim^e Vibert, Rose Mille Ecus. 
 Noisette Desprez, &c. 

Class 6. — Bengal Roses — In this class the branch- 
 es are nearly without thorns, the bark is smooth, the 
 sepals are more or loss prolonged and fimbriated, the 
 branches seldom boar more than one flower. The ca-
