 important particular the i;reat olijoet we have in view, 
 the advaneeiuant of the agricultural prosperity of the 
 State. 

The Committee report that there are four appli- 
 cants for premiums on Corn, who conform to the re- 
 quirements of the Society, viz:

♦Honry A. Carpenter, Lancasteroounty, one-fourth 
 acre Sug.ar Beets: one-fourth acre Rufa Ba-^a. 

*J. II. Smith, Lancaster county, one-fourth aero 
 field turnips. 

The Committe regret that in so large a Common- 
 ■wealth, and such an extensive field for competition, 
 thei-e were not more applicants, although it was to 
 have boon expected, that one or two seasons would 
 elapse before farmers would feal sufficient emulation 
 to accurately survey .and measure an entire crop for 
 su small a premium as is awarded. 

The .written statements of competitors are very 
 satisfactory for first reports, many of tham being fufl 
 and specific upon every point, except it be the nett 
 cost per bushel or per aci-e. Wo have no doubt this 
 defect will be corrected in future. The Committee 
 deem the rules of the society to have been complied 
 with by most of the competitors, and we find no diffi- 
 culty in making the awards. After a carefu' examin- 
 ation and comparison of the different statements and 
 samples, which are herewith submitted to the Soci- 
 ety for examination and distribution, the Committee 
 award as follows: 

Goo. Walker, first premium for best five acres cf 
 corn, i^l^) 00.

SECRETARY'S REPORT. 

The closing of the second year of the Pennsylva- 
 nia State Agricultural Society, furnishes the evidence 
 that its organization has been for good, and that it 
 has received attention from its friends, commensurate 
 with the imiiortaiico to be attached to an institution 
 intended to F)ster and improve Agriculture, Horti- 
 culture and the Domestic and Ilouseliold Arts. It 
 has also afforded sufiicient proof that there does exist 
 in Pennsylvania, all the elements required to carry 
 forward and foster successfully a State Agricultural 
 Society. 

Tlie" proceedings of the year, -which are those of 
 the Executive Committe, have been nearly altogether 
 of a business nature, and are made up from the min- 
 utes of said committee, which has been in session 
 eight times since' the last annual meeting of the So- 
 ciety. A very considerable amount of time and la- 
 bor is required from, and has been cheerfully given 
 by the membei-s.of the Executive Committee, upon 
 whom has devolved all the business of the associa- 
 tion. 

The following resolution was passed by the Exe(!u- 
 tive Committee, at their mooting on the 10th of De- 
 cember, 1S52: 

" Resolved, That exnerienco has shown that our 
 Annual Exhibitions have heretofore been lu'ld too 
 late in the season, and that our next Annu.al Exhibi- 
 tion and Cattle Show .'^h all be held on Tuesdny.Wed- 
 neadav, Thursday and Friday, the 27th, 28th, 20th 
 and 30th days of September next." _ 

In accordance with the Constitution of the United 
 States Agric'iltural Society, which makes pi-ovision 
 for the establishment of a" Board of Agriculture, to 
 be apoointed bv the respective State AgricuUuralSo- 
 e^pfii'fi.tlic Ex^'eutive Committee has a'lpointeJFred'k 
 Watts. John II. Ewing, and 11. W. M'Allister, mem- 
 bers of the said Board of Agrieultnre. 

It was also resolved that the thanks of the Society 
 j be tendered to the Agricultural Society of Lancaster 
 ' county, for the industrious attention whioli they have 
 1 given'to the jnterests,of the State S iciety during its 
 exhibition, and especif Uy to tlieir E.xecutlve officer, 
 1 Daniel Rhoads, for his untiring energy in executing 
 the orders of the Committee of Arrangement. 

The Committee appointeil to receive proposals from 
 places competing for the next Annual Exhibition, 
 reported projress and had leave to report at the next 
 meeting of the Committee. 

The Committee anpointod to a\idit the accounts of 
 the Treasurer, reported and certified to the correct- 
 ness of the same. 

It is to be regretted that none of the difi'erent coun- 
 ty Airrieultural Societies in the State, have complied 
 with the Act of Incorporation of the State Society, 
 which rcrpiires that they shall annually transmit in 
 the month of D.-ccmber," to tlie Executive Committee, 
 "all such reports or returns as they are required to 
 demnnd and receive from applicants for premium*, 
 with an abstraetof their proceedings during the year." 

An adlierenee to that part of the law requiring 
 them to make rc-i— t ,,r (!„.|i- yearly proceedings, 
 would enable the S*:i* '■'.:•' lo airquire a great 
 store of agrieultui- il ■;[ im- n. from the vari<mg 
 districts, and a soIm ; : > " i . -^-oltural statistics to 
 warrant the L"gishiturc ia toll.iwing the worthy ex
