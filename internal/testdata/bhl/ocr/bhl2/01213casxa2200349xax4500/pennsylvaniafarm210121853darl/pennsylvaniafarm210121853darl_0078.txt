 Leave only four or five stalks t:) eaoli plant, llasp- 
 b3rriei mast b3 \v;ll minureJ to b? prodnotive, and 
 mivei to a new place at least once in five years. If! 
 frost should be out of ground by last of m )nth, straw- 
 berry beds may be raked over, and short manure dii;^ 
 in between rows. A good coat of ashes .should be 
 spreal over tlie whole bad. ; 

Fdwes Gardsv. — See directions for previous 
 months. j 

VB-jeTAUi.E Garde;?. — Manuresshould nowbecom- 1 
 posted and prepared for frames. Turn over occasion- 1 
 ally to allow hot steam to pass off. From tlio middle ! 
 to the last of this month, frames may bo set up, and j 
 some cahba;;e, lettuce, rarlish, tomatoes, ogjf-plant 
 and pepper-seed sown for eavly^planting. The two 
 lafiter require rather more heat than the others, and 
 should have a separate frame, and never allowed to 
 beoom? chilled. Sjleot a sheltered place for hot beds 
 on the south side of a huildinji; or tight fence. 

After seed is sown, constant attention is required. 
 Cover with straw mats in nights and in cold weather, 
 and give air occasionally on fine days. 

Should it be necessary to Ifet off steam, cover with 
 something to keep out cold, and prevent a check to 
 bod or plants. 11 idish and Beet seed.early v.arieties, 
 may be sown on a rich warm border in open ground, 
 for early use, as soon as frost is out of the ground. 
 Cover with straw in severe weather. 

By latter part of month. Extra Early Peas may bo 
 planted in rows for early crop, and also • Potatoes, 
 Rhubarb may bj forced by covering plants with a 
 b.arrel, and flUiug up with manure. C(mtinue to give 
 air on fine days to plants of last years sowing, in 
 cold and forcing frames. 

By last of month, if weather is,"open,fork in manure 
 on asparagus bo<ls, and give a plentiful dressing of 
 salt.

Rakes to Gsaix IIarvestf.us. — By J"ai-um At- 
 kins, of Ch'^lsea, 111.:- I do n )t confine mys'It to the 
 exact m"clu\nical di^vices and arrangem »uts des.'rih- 
 ed, for operating the l-ako. as th.-y may be modified, 
 or others substituted for them. 

I claim the combination of thT crane post, rock- 
 shaft, and crank, to operate the jointed arm and 

hands, which o:)llect the grain in gavels, and depos- 
 it in rear of the harvester, as specified, as the ma- 
 chinery moves forward, when applied to machines 
 for harvesfiiig any grain which requires to be col- 
 lected and denosit''d, the combination bting connec- 
 ted by gearing with the driving wheel of the harves- 
 ter, and operating through m.iohanical devices, sub- 
 stantially as described, as an automaton, to perform 
 the above specified operations. 

Straw Cl-tters. — By AVarren Gale, of Louisville, 
 Ky. : I claim constructing the rotating cutting cy- 
 linder, substantially as d-^sr.rihed, with a series of 
 parallel annular grooves and riiiges, and a series of 
 cutting arms or knives, in combination with a series 
 of fixed knives, so arranged that they enter the 
 jjrnoves and interlock or lap past the annular ridges 
 oh the cylinder, and thereby pi-evont the stalks of 
 straw. &c., from descending between the fixed knives 
 and cylinder, without being cut, substantially as set 
 forth. 

Plows-— By Wm. A. Gates, of Mount Comfort, 
 Tenn. : I claim the rhomboidal plate, bent oa one 
 of its diagonals, and constructed and arranged sub- 
 stantially as described, so that either leaf can bo 
 used as a land-side or share, at pleasure, the edges 
 of the snare becoming, when the plate is reversed, 
 the edges of the land-side, and those of the land- 
 side, the edges of the share, in the manner and for 
 the purposes specified. 

Grai?* Threshers and Cleaners. — By J. Jones 
 & Al,;x. Lyle, of Richester, N. Y. : We claim the 
 oom'jination of the upright threshing and separating 
 cylinders with the uprigiit concave and cylindrical 
 sieves operating in the manner set forth. 

Maize II irvesters. — By J. L. Ream, of Mount 
 Pulaski, 111: I claim the arrangement of the shaft 
 of the receiving arms, with one end resting upon the 
 cutter bar piece, thereby dispensing with an inter- 
 mediate platform, so that the cut stalks will fall d'- 
 rectly upon the receiving arms, and be thence dis- 
 charged in bundles upon the ground as set forth. 

FiTLLixr. Mills.— By AVm. E. Underwood, of Mid- 
 dlefield. Mass : I claim the combination of the stop, 
 mechanism or its equivalent, with the screw pulley 
 and the elastic band leading to the pulley on the up- 
 per roller, whereby the whole machine is stopped, 
 when the motion of the cloth is arrested in the man- 
 ner described, and ceases to impart motion to the up- 
 per ndler. 

WisN'owiv! Macuixes. — By Samuel Canby, of 
 Ellicott's Mills, Md. : I claim the combination of the 
 pistim, rack-rods, pinion, valves and eccentric pul- 
 ley, in connection with a conducting chest and blow- 
 er, for the automatic graduation or government of 
 the blast through the spouts, of a winnowing ma- 
 chine, arranged and operating in the manner and for 
 the purpose set forth. 

Heckling Flax and IIejip.— By J. P. Arnold, of 
 Louisville, Ky.: I do not confine myself to any par- 
 ticular form or arrangement of the parts, so long as 
 the machine is so constructed that it will operate as 
 set forth. 

1 cliiiio tlv m 'thud cif h 'ckling hemp by subject-

 set forth.- 

Also, a rest, having a narrow slot open at one end 
 in combination with a concave projecting beyond
