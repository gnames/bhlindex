"its peculiar mechanical action in the attachment of 
 "particles." 

We are here told by the learned Professor that lime 
 loosens a sandy soil that is composed of round sand, 
 because it has a tendency to take the polish from the 
 surface of the sand. In the first place, I deny that 
 lime applied in the caustic state at the rate of fifty 
 bushels to the acre, can or will do any thing of the 
 kind. Caustic lime applied to a loose sandy soil, 
 such as is here described, would not long remain 
 caustic, but would soon be a carbonate ; long before 
 it could bo so intermixed with such an overwhelm- 
 ing amount of sand as to cause any sensible eSect. 
 The quantity of lime would be too small to have any 
 effect on the sand, even if it did not become a carbo- 
 nate without delay. Caustic lime does not speedily 
 combine with silex, atthe ordinary temperature. And 
 last but not least, I deny that the roughening of the 
 surface of such sand would hinder it from packing, 
 or render the soil composed of such sand more loose. 
 But the efieot of a dose of lime might easily be ex- 
 pected to do wonders in a mechanical way when we 
 are told that plaster, of which so little is usually 
 sown at a time as scarcely to be perceptible on the 
 ground, materially benefits sandy soils by its peculi- 
 ar mechanical action in the attachment of particles. 
 The more we consider these mechanical effects 
 that are attributed to lime, the more absurd they will 
 appear to us. 

The only mechanical effect that can fairly be at- 
 tributed to lime, is the result of a chemical phenom- 
 ena that takes place in the process of decay. We 
 have seen that in the course of decay of the vegeta- 
 ble matter found in the soil, vegetable acids are form- 
 ed which have more affinity for lime than carbonic 
 acid has. When the carbonate of lime yields its 
 ( carbonic acid in favor of one or the other of these 
 acids, the carbonic acid is set free in the gaseous 
 state. This carbonic acid occupies a much larger 
 space in it? gaseous state than it did when combin- 
 ed with the lime, and by its expansion has a tenden- 
 cy to rend asunder the earth in which this phenom- 
 ena takes place. In other words, it lightens it in 
 the same way that it lightens a loaf of bread. 

I believe that in this way only is the soil mellowed 
 by the presence of lime, and that, in no instance, 
 does it render it more compact. As to the other 
 chemical and mechanical effects that are attributed 
 to it, I believe that none such can be substantiated.

 The Wheat Fly. 

On new-years day, 1853, an intelligent farmer, in 
 the vicinity of West-Chester, brought to tab a quan- 
 tity of chair, which had been blown ofl in winnowing 
 his wheat, in which were a great number of little, 
 tawny, cocoon-looking bodies, or ywpae evidently be- 
 longing to some insect which had materially injured 

the size and quality of the grain. The same gentle- 
 man afterwards, at my request, brought to me some 
 unthreshed spikes, or ears of wheat, in which were 
 many of those ^mjjac deposited on, or nestling round 
 the grains, within the chaff of the florets. Not being 
 an Entomologist, I could give no account of the inju- 
 rious little animal; but, for the satisfaction of my in- 
 quiring neighbor,I forwarded specimens to Miss Mar- 
 GARETTA II. MoRRis, of Gerreantown, a lady distin- 
 guished for her attainments in that most important 
 department of Natural History, who promptly hon- 
 ored me with the following sketch of tlie character 
 and career of the insect; and, at my request, has 
 kindly consented to its publication. If what is known 
 of the history of the michievous little creature, shall 
 induce intelligent observers to prosecute the inquiry, 
 and thereby enable them successfully to counteract 
 the evil, the subject may be well worthy the attention 
 of the agricultural community, and entitled to a dis- 
 cussion in the Farm Journal. 

Germantown, January 7th, 1853. 
 "JIany thanks, my dear Sir, for the pupae of the 
 Wheat Fly, Cecidomyia Triiici, [not the "Hessian 
 Fly"â€” which is a different species, called Cecidomyia 
 deslracior,] that famous, or rather infamous insec>,80 
 well known in New York, and now gradually spread- 
 ing through Pennsylvania. Your farmer friends may 
 well dread its approach; for no insect need be more 
 feared. It feeds in the blossom of the wheat, where 
 the eggs are deposited. According to Harris, the 
 eggs hat^^h in about eight or ten days;the little yellow 
 maggots may be found within the chaffy scales of the 
 grain, and do not exceed one eighth of an inch in 
 length. From two to twenty are to be found in a sin. 
 gle husk of a grain;and sometimes on e\ery grain in 
 the ear. Grain is always more infested by them,whcB 
 grown two years in succession on the same ground 
 they pass their cliange in the ground, where they 
 all winter, unless, as in this case,the crop has 
 been late, and they were not sufficiently advanced to 
 leave their early home. These maggots prey on the 
 grain in the milky state; and tlicir ravages stop when 
 the grain becomes hard; ttey do not burrow into the 
 kernels; but live on the pollen, and on the soft mat. 
 tor of the germ at the base of the grain. Toward 
 the end of July, and the beginning of August, the 
 full-grown m<iggots leave off eating, preparatory to 
 moulting their skins. The torpid state lasts only a 
 few di'.ys; after which the insect casts off' its skin_ 
 Gr^at numbers of the cast skins are to be seen, im. 
 mediately after the moulting is completed. Some- 
 times the maggots descend and moult in the ground. 
 The late broods are often harvested and carried into, 
 the barns. It is not usually till June, that they are 
 transformed mia pupae. The latter part of Juuc,and 
 in July, the perfect insects may be seen rising from 
 the fields where the parent wheat had been grown. 
 Tlieir progress is about twenty or thirty miles a year.
