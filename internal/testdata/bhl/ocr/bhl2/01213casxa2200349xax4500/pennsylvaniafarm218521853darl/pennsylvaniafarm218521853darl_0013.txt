Protection to Sheep against Dogs. 
 The following extract from a letter received by u's 
 from an intelligent farmei" of Fayette county, forci- 
 bly addresses itself to every friend of the Sheep 
 grovring interest in Pennsylvania. We should like 
 to see the suggestions of our correspondent carried 
 out, believing that a law taxing dogs would be high- 
 ly acceptable, to those portions of the State at least 
 adapted to Sheep raising. As remarked by the wri- 
 ter, there is poor encouragement to enterprising men 
 to pay large prices for fine Sheep, and run the risk of 
 having them destroyed by hungry curs. We have 
 been the friend of the dog, and should ragret any le- 
 gislative action that would in any way defraud him 
 of his rights ; but a Sheep-killing cur has no claim 
 upon our sympathies. Every possible encourage- 
 ment should be extended to those counties of our 
 State, where the soil &c., is adapted to the raising of 
 Sheep. If fostered as it should be, wool growing 
 will become one of our most important interests. — 
 It has been demonstrated beyond a doubt that large 
 portions of Western Pennsylvania, possess all the 
 requisites for successful Sheep husbandry. We trust, 
 therefore, that those who are ready and willing to 
 invest their capital in this direction, will be afforded 
 such protection against dogs, as will effectually pre- 
 serve their flocks from destruction. 

With one of the best counties in the State for 
 growing wool, we have, I think, but two large flocks 
 in our county. Judge Ewing's and Asbury Struble's. 
 Our farmers have been driven from the sheep busi- 
 ness by the repeated severe losses they have sustain- 
 ed from dogs. Many of our farmers rear none, 
 many others a sufficient numl)er only for domestic 
 use. Messrs. Ewing and Struble have both suffered 
 severely by dogs ; the latter estimates that his loss,

at a low calculation, has not been less than twelve 
 hundred dollars. Can there not be some mode devis- 
 ed to rid the State of so great a nuisance ; as they are 
 almost, if not entirely, a useless animal. It is gen- 
 erally the case that the poorer the man, the more 
 dogs he thinks it necessary to keep to guard him and 
 his property. Almost every negro family is entitled 
 to a full pack of half-starved creatures, forced in self- 
 preservation to prey upon something. Would not 
 our State considerably increase her revenue, and 
 confer a groat benefit on our citizens, both the sheep 
 grower and the poor man, by levying a heavy tax on 
 dogs. A benefit to the poor (if h« disposes of his 
 dogs), because he could make two hundred pounds 
 of pork for his family, with the food it takes to feed 
 his dogs ; and to the wool grower because it saves 
 him his flocks. It is a poor stimulus to invest money 
 in fine bucks and ewes at from two to five hundred 
 per head: ""'ith the chances that the increase will not 
 equal the loss by dogs. Can you not, through your 
 Journal, call the attention of the farmers to this sub- 
 ject, that there may be a vigorous and united effort 
 for their expulsion. As the practical, scientific and 
 progressive leader in our State among farmers, can 
 you not devise some plan which will legislatively pro- 
 tect this great interest. It should be a State, not a 
 county regulation. A tax say of $3,00 when a man 
 keeps but one dog ; ^5,00 for the second, &c., would 
 bring to the treasury with the present rtumber of dogs 
 a large amount. A man whose dog was of use to 
 him, could pay three dollars, if he was of no use, he 
 should thank the State for causing him to dispense 
 with an expensive and useless animal. 

ExperimkntalFarm. — The University of Toronto, 
 has granted lands to the Board of Agriculture, of 
 Upper Canada, for an Experimental Farm. Thus it 
 is we are surpassed in our indolence. 

To Farmers. — To double the crops on most farms, 
 about all tliat is necessary is for our agriculturists to 
 sell off one-half their land, and with the proceeds buy 
 manure for the other. The larger a farm, the less a 
 man grows to the acre.
