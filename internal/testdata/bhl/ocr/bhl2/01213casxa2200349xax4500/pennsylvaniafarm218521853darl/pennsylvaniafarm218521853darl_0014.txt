As regards special manuring, a chief object is to 
 supply the eoil with one or more ingredients, of which 
 it has been ascertained to be wholly or in part defi- 
 cient. In this connection it is proper to call atten- 
 tion primarily to a great and very prevalent abuse, 
 which is a source of very serious loss to most farmers. 
 When a field begins to be unproductive, very few 
 think of doing anything else than to supply it again 
 with a full dressing of barnyard manure. It never 
 occurs to them to inquire whether the diminished fer- 
 tility may not result from causes which can be re- 
 moved at little cost by the supply of some particular 
 ingredients which the soil needs. Yet when such is 
 the case, the application of mineral manure is down- 
 rio-ht extravagance and waste, because we thus sup- 
 ply probably only one or at most but a few of the 
 deficient ingredients which could be furnished more 
 cheaply by some other substance. A few examples 
 will serve to elucidate this. When a black crumbling 
 soil contains no silicic acid, or its humus has become 
 carbonized, or sour, we may indeed supply the need- 
 ed silicic acid by a dressing of barnyard manure, since 
 it is contained in the straw which is used for litter. 
 A portion of the carbonized humus, also, will be de- 
 composed alike by the ammonia developed, and the 
 more rapid decomposition of the manure which en- 
 sues from the stirring and loosening of the soil. — 
 But the remaining ingredients of the manure serve 
 no other present purpose but to increase unnecessa- 
 rily the quantity of similar substances already con- 
 tained in the soil. It were much better and cheaper 
 to dress such land with silicious earth, fine quartz 
 sand, or marl, or unslacked lime. In other cases, a 
 similar application may be made of liquid manure. — 
 It often happens that a soil rich in humus, has be- 
 come exhausted of the incombustible elements re- 
 quired by plants ; and it is customary to dress such 
 land with barnyard manure, though a supply of li- 
 quid manure would be much more serviceable, as it 
 holds in solution a large amount of fixed salts. If 
 sulphuric acid have occasionally been mixed with the 
 liquid manure, it will prove all the more efficient, 
 because its ammonia has thereby been neutralized, 
 and it is no longer in a caustic state. Again, if we 
 have land which is deficient in humus, but which, 
 judging from its composition — being clayey — may 
 be presumed to contain a store of incombustible ele- 
 ments, the usual practice is to dress it with barnyard 
 manure, though it would conduce much more to ren- 
 der it speedily productive, if it were dressed with 
 muck or swamp mud and liquid manure, or lime. — 
 When soil otherwise good is unproductive from want 
 of calcareous earth, we dress with fresh slaked lime, 
 or with marl,, and eoon realize bett«r results than 

would follow from a dressing of manure alone. A 
 light and sandy soil may be rendered v( ry produc- 
 tive by a dressing of clay, the constituent elements of 
 which are in part rendered soluble and serve as nu- 
 triment for the crop. If a soil be deficient in phos- 
 phoric acid, as is the case when the grain produced 
 is small, ill-formed, and imperfectly filled, a dressing 
 of blue or potter's clay, in combination with muck 
 or swamp mud, or ef bonedust mixed with dilute sul- 
 phuric acid, will not fail to produce excellent results. 
 If the soil be sour, a dressing of fresh slaked lime, of 
 marl, or of ashes, will be much more serviceable than 
 the application of barnyard manure. 

In the last place, we have to consider that mode 
 of manuring which is designed to produce in perfec- 
 tion certain specific crops which we desire to culti- 
 vate. Plants and vegetables, in accordance with the 
 idea that they are always able to absorb from the at- 
 mosphere, in sufficient quantity, the gaseous elements 
 to be derived therefrom, have been subdivided into 
 three classes, according to the composition of their 
 ashes — namely, alkaline plants, in the ashes of which 
 potash predominates ; calcareous plants, the ashes of 
 which contain principally lime, and silicious plants, 
 the ashes of which are composed chiefly of silica. — 
 As the alkaline plants require large supplies of pot- 
 ash, they thrive best in soils containing most clay, as 
 also In land freshly manured. On the other hand, 
 calcareous plants require lime, whilst for silicious 
 plants, sand or quartz earth is indispensable. But, 
 in addition to these ingredients, the soil must con- 
 tain also a due proportion of the other alimentary 
 substances heretofore enumerated. Thus a plant 
 will not thrive though it find in the soil an abund- 
 ance of the particular ingredient required by the 
 class to which It belongs, if the other ingredients be 
 not present also, and the character of the soil be not 
 propitious — as when it is too compact, too wet, or too 
 dry. It is therefore more correct to say that each 
 plant must find in the soil an ample supply of the 
 peculiar ingredients or elements required by its class, 
 whether they be naturally contained in It or have 
 been introduced in the course of tillage. It is un- 
 doubtedly safest, however, to assume in general, first, 
 that a soil must contain in due proportion and quan- 
 tity all the substances required for the growth of cul- 
 tivated plants ; and, secondly, that it is well, never- 
 theless, to introduce in increased quantity the parti- 
 cular substances which the plants we design to cul- 
 tivate are known to require ; unless we are assured 
 that they already exist in the soil in adequate quan- 
 tity. These propositions harmonize perfectly with 
 the current practice. Thus it is customary to culti- 
 vate crops which require certain substances for their 
 thrifty growth and full development, in soils which 
 we have ascertained contain an abundance of those 
 substances. And if a plant do not thrive in a parti- 
 ticular soil, we usually manure the land and endea-
