For the Farm Journal. 
 Mr. Gowen's Address. 

Tliero are few individuals in this country entitled 
 to more praise for the aid rendered the agricultural 
 community than my respected friend, James Gowen, 
 Esq., the venerable President of the "Philadelphia Co. 
 Agricultural Society ;" and he is so well known as a 
 model farmer an 1 the rearer, at great expense, of 
 some of the finest cattle in our country, that any at- 
 tempt at eulogy on the part of so humble an indivi- 
 dual as myself would be a work of supererogation. — 
 His Address delivered before the "Lancaster County 
 Agricultural Society," is a work of no inconsiderable 
 merit, and will impart much useful information to 
 the farming interest. I have read it carefully and 
 with lively satisfoction. 

I must be permitted, however, to dissent from one or 
 two statements contained in t. e Address, where he 
 speaks so lightly of the use of lime and in condemnation 
 of the practice of plowing down green crops. Ou page 
 20, Mr. Gowen says: — "Inthegeneral,LiME is so waste- 
 ful and ravenous a cook, that he sometimes consumes 
 more than he furnishes to the family of plants it is 
 intended he should provide for." . . . " Light sandy 
 micacious or isinglass, red shale and slaty soils, may 
 in general be benefitted by dressings of lime ; but on 
 clayey limestone soil, I should deem its application 
 unnecessary, if not injurious." 

1 do not pretend to possess much information in 
 regard to agriculture, but the little I have obtained 
 is rather of a practical character. I take most of 
 our agricultural periodicals, and read considerable 
 upon the subject ; but, after all, I find the farmer is 
 much of his time vmrking in the dark, and that, with- 
 out ^;raci!(caZ knowledge, he will not be likely to attain 
 the object of his calling. During my ten or twelve 
 years pupi'age as a farmer,! have striven to improve 
 my soil by the use of such fertilizers, as would, in the 
 end, produce the greatest results, with the least out- 
 lay of capital. One of the cheapest and best fertil- 
 izers I have found is Lime, and I have used it with 
 complete success upon llmostont as well as other 
 soils. More than two hundred acres of my land are 
 limestone, and much of it " clayeij limestone soil." 
 Twelve years ago, a considerable proportion of this 
 soil had been so much reduced by successive croppino-s, 
 principally of rye, that it was incapable of producing 
 scarcely twenty bushels of corn per acre. It viU 
 now produce, in a good season, three times th^t 
 amount; and I attribute this improvement in the 
 soil mainly to liming and plowing down clover. On 
 the poorest of this soil, in the twelve years referred 
 to, one hundred and fifty bushels of lime per acre 
 have been applied, at three different periods, at the 
 rate of fifty bushels per acre at each dressing, and its 
 efiicacy is perceptible to the dullest intellect. The 
 applications of lime have increased the hay crop 
 three fold, and (as I sell no hay but feed it all on the 

farm) the grass of course has so much improved the 
 manure heap, that where I formerly had one load of 
 manure,! now have at least /w«% And this too from 
 limestone soil. ! admit that lime in general is more 
 beneficial to other soils than limestone, because na- 
 ture has supplied the latter with this ingredient to 
 some extent ; but to deny its wholesome influence 
 upon limestone soils altogether, is to deny that I can 
 see. An excessive or injudicious use of lime upon 
 any soil will be attended with injurious consequences, 
 A superabundant application of stable m.anure will 
 also defeat the hopes of the farmer. Land, in gene- 
 ral, like the human stomach, is more healthful with- 
 out over-feeding. 

It may not be inappropriate to refer to the advan- 
 tages of lime to lands in England. I extract from a 
 work by Fessenden. " On the Mendip lands in So- 
 merset, by the application of lime, the value of land 
 was raised from four shillings to thirty shillings per 
 acre ; and dung, which previous to liming had no 
 sensible effect, opeiated after its application as on 
 other lands. Macclesfield forest in Cheshire, and vast 
 tracts in the northern and more elevated parts of 
 Derbyshire, and adjacent districts, have been aston- 
 ishingly improved by the same process. In maiden 
 soils of a tolerable quality, the richest manure will 
 not enable them to bring any crops, but those of oats 
 or rye, to maturity ; whereas, if they receive a suffi- 
 cient quantity of lime, crops of peas, barley or wheat 
 may be raised to advantage. The benefit resulting 
 from the use of lime has been indisputably proved in 
 the same form ; for the richer parts that were left urt' 
 limed were uniformly inferior in produce to the poorer 
 that had heeyi limed, during a period of not less than 
 twenty-one years, under the same course of manage- 
 ment." 

The usual custom in this community to some ex- 
 tent now, is to apply lime mostly as a top-dressing, 
 late in the fall on stubble after wheat, at the rate of 
 from thirty to fifty bushels per acre, and to repeat 
 the application once in six or eight years ; but in no 
 case to apply lime and stable manure at the same 
 time. With this process our lands are annually im- 
 proving, and a constant increase in the quantity of 
 grain and grass is the result. 

There are a few farmers living in Buckingham val- 
 ley (a limestone valley) who think that they can pro- 
 cure no article, for the same amount of money, to 
 benefit their lands so much as lime ; and without be- 
 ing at all invidious, challenge a comparison of soil 
 and farming with any of the successful farmers of 
 Philadelphia county, with all their advantages of ac- 
 cess to market for all sorts of manures. Our lime has 
 raado the " solitary place to blossom as the rose." — 
 Land& that were hardly worth cultivating in parts 
 of this county and the adjoining State of New Jersey, 
 are now making their owners rich mainly by the ju- 
 dicious use of lime. I am no chemist or geologist,
