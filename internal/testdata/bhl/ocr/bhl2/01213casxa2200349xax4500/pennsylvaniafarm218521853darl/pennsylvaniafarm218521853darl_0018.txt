were sold for $12.75, averaging little less than Ill- 
 cents per dozen. None were sold over 15 cents per 
 dozen, and some as low as 8 cents per dozen. We 
 raised 27 chickens, the rats killing or carrying off all 
 the others when small. Three of the old stock died, 
 which when replaced out of the young ones, left but 
 24 to dispose of, which brought on an average, 18| cts. 
 each, on account of extra size and quality; the common 
 price being 12^ cts. each. Theeggs of those fowls were 
 larger than common, twelve of them generally Weigh- 
 ing as much as fifteen or sixteen of the common kind, 
 but we could not sell them any higher on this account, 
 as an egg appears to be an egg large or small. The 
 whole account sums up in this manner:

I forgot to mention that they had a constant sup- 
 ply of water. The manure was saved and mixed 
 with a quantity of wood ashes and plaster, and ap- 
 plied as a top-dressing to our corn, by scattering about 
 a gill of the mixture around each hill, after the corn 
 came up. The crop was good, but I cannot say 
 whether it was any better on account of the manure 
 applied ; but hope to ascertain more satisfactorily 
 next season. Yours, &c., T. W. M.

For the Farm Journal. 
 Applying Bone Dust to Indian Corn Crops. 

To the Chairman and memhers of the Executive Com- 
 mittee of the Montgomery County Agricultural So- 
 ciety: 

Gentlemen: â€” Having at the last meeting of our 
 Society, been requested by our late much esteemed 
 President, to favor him with my views as to the best 
 mode of applying bonedust to the Indian corn crop: 
 in order that others may have the opportunity of be- 
 nefitting by any information in my power to impart, 
 I have chosen to make it the subject of a communica- 
 tion to this committee. If, in your estimation, it 
 contains any matter that could prove useful to the 
 Society, or to the farming public at large, it is at 
 your disposal. 

In discussing the attributes of an artificial manure, 
 and dilating on its merits, too little attention is gen- 
 erally paid to the fact, that no one salt (or metalic 
 oxide combined with an acid,) is of itself more than 
 a specific. In agriculture, as well as in medicine, 
 wherever we attempt to cure all diseases with one 
 remedy, we must meet with signal failure. Bonedust 
 has been extolled by those who have used it success- 
 fully, into something that has all the attributes of 
 " the mother's milk ;" and many have been led to 
 lelieve, that it contains all that is required to render 

the most barren land fertile. But such is not the 
 case ; it is far from being a panacea. 

Many necessary ingredients to form a good soil 
 might be absent, that would not be supplied by 
 bone-dust, no matter in what form we present 
 it to the soil. Bones contain about G6-100 of 
 earthy or inorganic matter, the balance is organic 
 matter, rich in carbon and nitrogen. If we pul- 
 verise the bone and use it in its natural state 
 sowing it broadcast on the ground in sufficient quan- 
 tity, time will decompose it, and k fur et it mesine 
 as the organic matter undergoes petrefaction, it will 
 furnish nitrogen to the plant, and the phosphate of 
 lime no longer protected by this covering, will dis. 
 solve in the water impregnated with carbonic acid, 
 always to be found in a rich soil. In this way it would 
 for a length of time, furnish phosphoric acid to the 
 plant, and we would have the benefit of the organic, 

as well as the inorganic matter contained in it. 
 But any effort to make our soils, by artificial means, 

as replete with the mineral substances as those of 
 Ohio, (100 parts of which contain If of phosphate of 
 lime) would be very expensive. To avoid this diffi- 
 culty, as far as possible, it has been devised to pre- 
 sent to the plant the phosphate of lime in that state, 
 in which it is most easily and speedily absorbed by 
 the roots, and thus, with much less in quantity of 
 material, offering to the plant the same amount of 
 surface for its roots to act on. To this end, it is dis- 
 solved in sulphuric acid, and applied to the grovmd 
 in a liquid state. You will easily perceive, that 
 when applied in the liquid state, that all parts of the 
 substance are presented immediately to be acted upon, 
 and that when applied in pieces of considerable size, 
 enveloped as it is, each particle being covered with a 
 coating of gelatine and fatty matter, substances of 
 slow decomposition, much less opportunity is afford- 
 ed to the plant to absorb it. By these means we will 
 be able to dispense with, to a great extent, so large 
 an outlay at one time, and still be able to effect our 

object. 

It has been recommended by some gentlemen of 

considerable attainments and research into these mat- 
 ters, to dissolve the bones without any further prepa- 
 ration than grinding. Of this I do not approve, on 
 the score of economy. I would prefer dispensing 
 with the grinding, and in lieu thereof, after having 
 dried them, by the addition of a small quantity of 
 light wood, burn out all the inorganic matter. This 
 leaves the bone pervious to liquids and easily attack- 
 ed by the acid. It also saves the trouble of grind- 
 ing, while in many localities it is an operation not 
 easily procured to be done. 

Bones we have seen consist of about 34-100 of or- 
 ganic matter, rich in carbon. "When sulphuric acid 
 is brought in contact With organic matter, containing 
 carbon, mutual decomposition ensues ; and the result 
 is, that carbonic acid and sulphurous acid are formed 
 at the expense of the carbon of the organic matter
