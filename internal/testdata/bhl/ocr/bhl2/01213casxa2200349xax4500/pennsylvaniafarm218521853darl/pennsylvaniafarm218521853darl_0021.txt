depth is exposed to view and will exhibit to some ex- 
 tent the cause of the great variety of soils which 
 chequer the surface. It is copied from the last edi- 

tion of " Lyell's Elements," and illustrates well a 
 considerable variety of formations as they exist in 
 the island of Arran, in Scotland. 

GENERAL SECTION OF THE ISLE OF ARRAN FROM NORTH TO SOUTH. 

1. Metamorphic or Hypogene Schists, the oldest 
 formations in Arran. 

2. Coarse-grained granite, sending veins into the 
 Schists, No. 1. 

3. Old Red Sandstone and Conglomerate, contain- 
 ing pebbles exclusively derived from the rocks, No. 
 1, without any intermixture of granitic frapnents. 

4. Carboniferous strata & red sandstone, (newred.) 

Bj this sketch it may be perceived that the uphea- 
 val of a mountain by volcanic or other subterranean 
 action will bring to light the deepest rocks, and thus 
 we have granite, gneiss, horubleade and other prima- 
 ry rocks on the surface, the stratified formations 
 which originally covered them being denuded or 
 washed off. 

These latter too, where remaining, are thrown out 
 of their horizontal position, and form an angle with 
 the surface, or dip from the horizon — where rivers 
 cut their way through these various layers or strata, 
 making gorges or valleye, they afford excellent op- 
 portunities to study their structure and materials. 

To the formation of mountains and valleys, we are 
 indebted for the origin of rivers and lakes or inland 
 seas, and to the same causes at other periods, lakes 
 have been drained and their beds which had been 
 the receptacles of the denuded uplands, formed large 
 and fertile districts. 

By a process of this nature it is believed was form- 
 ed a larger portion of the immense valley of the Mis- 
 sissippi, the most extensive alluvian deposit known to 
 man. 

According to Sir Charles Lyell, the delta and allu- 
 vial plains of the Mississippi consisting of sedimen- 
 tary matter, extends over an area of 30,000 square 
 miles, and is known in some parts to be several hun- 
 dred feet deep. 

The agents which have been since the formation 
 of our globe, producing the great changes that now 
 mark the exterior, are still in operation though prob- 
 ably with less activity than at some former periods, 
 and under modified circumstances. Volcanic irrup- 
 tions ma}'^ not be, and probably, are not so frequent 
 as in past ages, and the quantity of water flowing 
 on the surface of the earth may not be so great now 
 as formerly, owing perhaps to the increased depth 
 of the present oceans ; to a large amount held in 
 suspension by the atmosphere, by absorption, chrys- 
 talization, and other causes, but that changes are 
 yet taking place becomes evident on a little reflectioa 
 and observation. 

5. Trap, over lying and in dikes passing occasion- 
 ally into Syenites of the Plutonic class. 

6a. Fine-grained granite, associated witli the over- 
 lying trap No. 5. 

Gb. Similar fine-grained granite sending veins into 
 the older granite No. 2, and cutting off the trappean 
 dikes, c. d. 

Every freshet or heavy rain that occurs, carries 
 from our fields and forests immense amounts of their 
 component parts, which becoming intermingled with, 
 are transfered by the force of the currents to new 
 locations, where in the course of time deltas are 
 formed, and new fields drive back the line of the 
 ocean waters. Whether these transforming agents 
 are as active now, as at earlier periods, is a subject 
 of speculation and conjecture which has occasioned 
 much discussion among geologists, but is not mate- 
 rial to our present purpose. That those parts of the 
 earth which now form dry land, were at one time, 
 covered with water, becomes evident to such as will 
 carefully examine and observe, the indications which 
 almost every where abound; and that after the retir- 
 ing of the waters, the rivers were much larger than 
 at the present day Is rendered probable, by the sandy 
 beaches ; alluvial deposits ; higher benches or shelves; 
 the wearing of the rocks, and other indications which 
 may readily be detected by the eye of the Geologist. 

The action of wi'ter is made evident almost every 
 where over our own State by the round form of the 
 pebles, by the sllicious conglomerates or pudding 
 stones, by the worn surfaces and corners of many 
 rocks ; by the regularly stratified forms which exist 
 In numerous locations, and particularly by the fossil- 
 iforous Impressions, both vegetable and animal, which 
 abound in many formations.

 should have done so sooner, had I not felt so morti-

 not failed to breed a small flock every year for the

 was an Irish buck and ewe that was imported by 
 Capt. James Jefferies. They were purcliased by him
