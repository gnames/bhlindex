This practice of late years has been pursued exten- 
 sively and profitably by Messrs. Ellman, Grantham, 
 Todd and others. Two years previously to this the 
 Emperor of Russia bought two of Mr. Ellman's Rams 
 to try the efiPect of the cross on the Northern Sheep. 
 The Duke of Bedford at the request of Mr. Ellman, 
 put a price upon them, observing that he did not wish 
 to charge a foreign sovereign, who had done him so 
 much honor, more than any other individual. The 
 price fixed by the Duke was 300 guineas for the two, 
 and he purchased two more for himself at the same 
 rate." 

Now I would ask, do those western breeders who 
 produce those " Landpikes," desire those heavy long- 
 wooled breeds, that require rich pastures, and are 
 unable to stand long journeys to market, or the Me- 
 rinoes that are worth but little when brought there ; 
 or the hardy South Downs that produce a quality of 
 wool, the most suitable of all for domestic clothing ; 
 capable of traveling the greatest distance to market 
 on the least food, and being the most highly valued 
 by mutton eaters when they arrive there?

P. S. — As an indication of the want of spirit among 
 Sheep breeders, I may add, I met with but one pur- 
 chaser at Ilarrisburg, who is an Englishman, by 
 name Jesse Garrard, of Allegheny county. Pa., and 
 to him I sold a yearling Buck of pure Down blood.

 Fruit Trees—Planting Seeds—Budding, €&c. 

Mr. Editor: — The following views, regarding the 
 culture of fruit trees, some of which are the result 
 of the writer's own observation and experience, and 
 the residue condensed from various sources, may per- 
 haps be of use to some of your readers, they are there- 
 fore at your service. 

As regards the rearing of seedling apple trees, the 
 seeds after being washed from the pomace should be 
 sown immediately, or if spring sowing be preferred, 
 they should be mixed with sand and exposed to the 
 weather until the arrival of that season, when they 
 should be sown in drills, two feet apart, and the 
 plants thinned to three inches. When two years old 
 they may be taken up and the roots grafted. This 
 may be done in February or March, after which they 
 may be packed in boxes, in clean sand, having a pro- 
 per degree of moisture to preserve the vitality of the 
 plants, until the season of planting, which is gener- 
 ally from the middle of April till about the same time 
 in May, according as the season may be ; when they 
 should be planted in nursery rows, four feet apart, 
 and the grafts seven or eight inches asunder in the 
 rows. They should afterwards be treated somewhat 
 similar to a crop of corn, the ground being kept per- 
 fectly clean, till they are of three years growth, when 
 they are ready for market. 

When peach, plum or cherry trees are wanted, the 
 stones should be buried in thin layers near the sur- 
 face of the ground, as soon after maturity as possi- 
 ble, for if they become very much dried they will not 
 germinate, and left to remain thus until spring ; 
 when they should be taken up and the peach and 
 plum stones should be cracked, (care being taken not 
 to crack the kernels,) which will ensure their growth, 
 the first season. After which they may be planted 
 in the nursery, the same distance apart as that re- 
 commended for the apple grafts, and cultivated in 
 like manner. The greater part of the peach, with 
 some of the plum trees, may be budded the same sea- 
 son; the plums towards the latter part of Juno, and 
 the peaches at any time during the months of July 
 or August, and in some seasons during the early part 
 of September. 

The cherry may be budded the second year, and 
 as they are more difiicult to bud successfully than 
 most other kinds, they should be worked just as the 
 terminal buds of the stocks commence forming. — 
 This varies according to the season. 

It is better to work each variety of fruit upon 
 stocks of the same variety, yet the plum, nectarine, 
 and apricot work very well upon peach stocks, though 
 such trees are shorter-lived than Avhen upon their 
 own stocks. When apricots or nectarines are intend- 
 ed to be planted in low or moist ground, they should 
 be worked upon plums; but if on high or sandy 
 ground, the poach stock is to be preferred. When 
 plums, apricots, or nectarines, are worked upon peach 
 stocks, they may be budded at the usual season of 
 budding the peach. 

And-for the benefit of those of your subscribers 
 who may not have the book at hand, I will insert a 
 short extract from Downing's " Fruit and Fruit 
 Trees," on the proper time and method of grafting 
 the grape vine. The author says : " Cut your scions 
 during winter, keeping them partially buried in a 
 cool, damp cellar till wanted. As soon as the leaves 
 of the old vine or stock are fully expanded, and all 
 danger of bleeding is past, say about the tenth of 
 June, cut it off smoothly below the surface of the 
 ground, and split the stock and insert one or two 
 scions in the usual manner, binding the cleft well 
 together, if it docs not close firmly. Draw the 
 earth carefully around it, leaving two or three buds 
 of the scion above the surface. If the root of the 
 stock be a strong native grape, the graft will fre- 
 quently grow ten or fifteen feet during the first sea- 
 son, and yield a fair crop of fruit tlie second. The 
 vine should never be grafted above ground till the 
 leaves are nearly expanded."
