MR. GOWEN'S ADDRESS. 

[April, 

Mr. Goweu's Address. 

At the request of a large number of our readers, 
 we give in the present number the first part of the 
 Address delivered by James Govren, Esq., before the 
 Lancaster County Agricultural Society. It will be 
 seen that several of the positions taken by Mr. G., 
 are in direct variance with the received opinions of 
 the day, and will doubtless meet with some opposi- 
 tion. The stand he takes in regard to Lime and 
 green cropping, is certainly a bold one, and will open 
 the way for discussion. So soon as the whole ad- 
 dress appears, we shall offer our own views upon the 
 subject, if not anticipated by some of our correspond- 
 ents, one of whom (Mr. Stavcly) has already given 
 us an article on the subject.

 Lancaster, January 13, 1852. 
 Dear Sir — By unanimous vote of the Lancaster 
 County Agricultural Society, we have been instruct- 
 ed to request a copy for publication of your able, 
 practical and useful Address, this day delivered. In 
 obeying the instructions of the Society, we can with 
 perfect truth assure you that the request which we 
 now make is not a mere compliment to you, but that 
 your compliance will he the means of spreading be- 
 fore our farming community a mass of information 
 which we believe will bo at once pleasing and profit- 
 able to them. 

Very respectfully, your friends, 

Abraham Kauffman,

 Gentlemen — The motive that urged you to ask for 
 the publication of the Address, was the same that in- 
 duced me to deliver it, and I therefore most cheerful- 
 ly comply with your request. Permit me to add, that 
 it will afford me the liveliest gratification should your 
 laudable intention be properly appreciated, and your 
 anticipations of usefulness be fully realized, through 
 its reception by "our farming community." 
 With great respect, 

I am, gentlemen, 

Your obedient servant, 

James Gowen.

ADDRESS. 

Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Lancaster County 

Ayricultural Society: 

Had I been called upon to address an assemblage 
 of citizens of Lancaster upon any subject other than 
 one falling within _ the purview of your Society, I 
 should, from conscious inability, have shrunk from 
 the performance of a task that could not fail, if at- 
 tempted, to place me in a position of great embarrass- 
 ment — an embarrassment not to be overcome by any 
 resolution I could summon to sustain me, under the 

pervading sense of my insufficiency to even measura- 
 bly acquit myself before so enlightened an audience 
 as Lancaster can, on all occasions, present to the ap- 
 prehension of one acquainted as I am with the cha- 
 racter of its citizens. Nay, even on the subject of 
 Agriculture, I cannot but distrust my competency to 
 fulfil the expectations naturally suggested by the call 
 you did me the honor to make upon me, inferring, as 
 I may, the estimate you put upon my services from 
 the standard of your own reputed excellence, in the 
 theory and practice of Agriculture. 

Yet, notwithstanding these apprehensions, I shall, 
 with due deference and to the best of my aljilities, 
 attempt to improve this occasion, the first anniversa- 
 ry of your Society, by adverting to the expediency 
 of Agricultural Societies ; the characteristics proper 
 for membership in view of usefulness ; the apathetic 
 condition of farmers, and the means best calculated 
 to enlist their sympathies in behalf of improvement 
 — subjoining some brief remarks on the practice of 
 farming. 

The Advantages of Agricultural Societies have, 
 from experience and observation, been impressed 
 upon my mind for a series of years. Wheresoever 
 I sojourned in Pennsylvania, and with whomsoever 
 I conversed capable of properly appreciating the ex- 
 pediency of establishing them throughout the State, 
 my influence was directed to that object. These So- 
 cieties I considered not only as necessary to the im- 
 provement of the husbandry of the localities where 
 they might be formed, but to further the grand ob 
 ject of a State Agricultural Society, embracing and 
 commanding the combined talent and experience of 
 the County Associations, and capable of diffusing a 
 spirit of improvement in culture and husbandry 
 throughout the whole length and breadth of the 
 Commonwealth. The effect of such an organization 
 I believed would be, primarily, to increase the pro- 
 ducts of the soil, and to elevate the character of the 
 husbandman ; and, secondly, to be a means of im- 
 proving the financial concerns of the State, by ena- 
 bling the tax-payers, the farmers, to bear their bur- 
 dens with greater ease and convenience, from Increase 
 of profits, groAving out of a condition of improved 
 practice in farming — which improvement, in my 
 mind, could only be effected by a combined effort, 
 through the medium of a State Society. The Impulse 
 thus to be given, would tend to bring under profitable 
 culture the waste or neglected lands, to the advan- 
 tage of their owners as well as the public — enhance 
 their value to a highfold state — capacitate them to 
 proportionate taxation, and, by this means, diminish 
 the rate to the payers on old improved lands, by rea- 
 son of the addition of the newly-improved lands be- 
 ing subjected to taxation on an increased value. This 
 increase, and increasing operation of the material to 
 be taxed, while it lessens the rate, by dividing indi- 
 vidual burden, seemed to me the safest and surest 
 basis of revenue to be relied upon by the Common- 
 wealth for the extinguishment of its debt, compatible 
 with progressive prosperity to all industrial classes. 
 In contemplating the benefits to accrue from a 
 combined effort in favor of Agriculture, and the means 
 by which it could be effected, the wealth and influ- 
 ence of Lancaster county, so proverbial at all times, 
 could not fail to lead me to regard its moving in the 
 cause as essential to success. Hitherto, "The Phi- 
 ladelphia Agricultural Society for Promoting Agri- 
 culture," had labored singly and alone in the work, 
 and having its shoulder at the agricultural wheel, 
 could, with a good grace, call upon others for 
 help to move it from the rut of apathy in which 
 it had so long been imbedded. That call was
