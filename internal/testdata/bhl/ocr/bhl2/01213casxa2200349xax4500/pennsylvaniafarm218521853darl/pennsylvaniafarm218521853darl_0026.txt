MR. GOWEN'S ADDRESS. 

[April, 

tive in the works of true benevolence and genuine 
 hospitality, and in the exercise of the best sympathies 
 of our nature, intuitively kept in play by its own gen- 
 erous disposition. 

The seemingly dissimilar points of character of 
 these respective classes gradually became modified 
 thro' contact and association, and inspired confidence 
 in each other, whi.e every joint effort to promote the 
 cause for which they had associated, imbued all with 
 a better understanding of the principles of rural 
 economy — making of one, amateur agriculturists, 
 of the other, enlightened practical formers — each 
 class contributing, in their respective spheres, to the 
 advancement of the theory and practice of agricul- 
 ture. This conventional feeling led to individual in- 
 timacy, highly beneficial to their improvement. The 
 professional or mercantile gentleman would make 
 visits to the dwellings of his fellow-members, the 
 farmers, where he was received with kindness and 
 becoming hospitality. Here the love of rural pur- 
 suits, imbibed at the meetings of the Society, was 
 heightened by all he saw around him. The unpre- 
 tending and commodious farm-house — the noble barn 
 — the well-kept garden — the ample orchard — the 
 shady trees — the beautiful meadow — the finely culti- 
 vated fields — the rich pastui-es, with the sheep and 
 cattle, could not but call forth the oft-repeated ex- 
 pression, that "God made the country and man the 
 city," and lead him to contrast the peaceful scene be- 
 fore him with the bustle, din and dust of the throng- 
 ed mart, from which he had escaped to breathe, but 
 for a short space, a purer atmosphere ; and to deter- 
 mine, whenever fitting opportunity occurred, to quit the 
 city, with all its conventional rules and artificial 
 modes, to spend the remainder of his days in the en- 
 joyment of the quiet and simple habits of country 
 life. And thus have many wealthy and influential 
 citizens been merged in the great family of agricul- 
 turists, adding weight, character and influence to the 
 profession. The taste, enterprise and public spirit 
 of these gentlemen, led to making large outlays in 
 improving land, experimenting in culture, erecting 
 tine buildings, ornamenting grounds, importing choice 
 breeds of cattle, sheep and swine, and patronising 
 agricultural journals. These investments inured 
 more to the beuefit of the country than to the indivi- 
 duals by whom they were made, and were mainly 
 undertaken in the spirit of a lofty and generous pa- 
 triotism. The man most entitled to praise, in this 
 connection, in Pennsylvania, is John Hare Powell. 
 Had his efibrts been properly appreciated, and his 
 example followed in the selection and breeding of 
 cattle, it would have added to the value of the live 
 stock, beef and dairy products of the State some mil- 
 lions of dollars annually. 

The illustration, so feebly sketched as it has been, 
 in reference to the benefits accruing to the cause, 
 through an union of individuals of different callings 
 and pi'ofessions, will serve, however, I trust, to show 
 the propriety of some effort on the part of those who 
 think the promoting of agriculture commendable, and 
 whose tastes, talents and patriotism fit them for the 
 work. 

In view of the great necessity for such combina- 
 tion, it is only recessary to glance at the condition 
 of the working farmer, and the impediments that na- 
 turally prevent him from devising or pushing forward 
 any plan promotive of increase of profits with less 
 toil, or the elevation of his obscure or humble voca- 
 tion ; for be it remembered, however poetry may gild 
 or invest his calling with charms, it is, in plain and 
 truthful prose, one of depressing drudgery — excluding 
 the mere farmer, from habit, as well aa from the pre- 

judice of fashionable society, from taking rank with 
 members of many other professions in the scale of 
 gentility. This position I would fain ameliorate, if 
 not avert — and to that end I would invoke the aid of 
 every able and generous mind around me. 

The isolated position of farmers generally deny to 
 them the opportunities and advantages of social in- 
 tercourse and means of improving enjoyed by almost 
 every other industrial class. The mechanic, with 
 entire ease and convenience, may and does associate 
 daily in the same shop, or weekly or monthly in the 
 society room, with his fellow-artisans, in any village, 
 town, or city. So of the manufacturer. The lawyer 
 and physician, from the nature of their functions, are 
 ever within or under each other's eye and that of the 
 public, while struggling for distinction, which serves 
 to stimulate to renewed effort, should they pause for 
 a moment in their emulous career. The counti-y 
 trader is kept ever lively waiting upon his customers, 
 while his skill is tasked in the selection of supplies 
 suited to their wants, and to yield a fair profit. The 
 merchant is relieved from the tedium of the counting 
 house by appearing on ' change, among the enter- 
 prising class that daily crowd that animated scene 
 of commerce and speculation. All have means and 
 incentives peculiar to their pursuits, which instruct, 
 inspire, and gratify ! Not so with the unpretending 
 habitant of the farm, whose constant and unremit- 
 ting labors confine him wholly to the barn, the sta- 
 ble, and the field. He has but few opportunities of 
 associating even with those of his own calling, much 
 less with others better versed than himself in the 
 ways of the busy world. Each day so spent lessens 
 the desire to look abroad, or ^change in any respect 
 his practice or routine, and thus he settles down in a 
 state of apathy, apparently insensible to the necessity 
 of improvement, till Time, with its witherings, num- 
 bers him ■« ith the clods — with which, while living, 
 he seemed little more than a fit associate. 

In drawing this sketch, let me not be understood 
 as designing to disparage the calling of the farmer, 
 or to impute to the simple and inoffensive swain 
 aught that would cast a shadow on his brow, or a 
 blemish on the spotless integrity of his unsophisti- 
 cated nature: far be it from me. A worthier motive 
 moves me to call your attention to the condition of 
 the thousands that uncomplainingly toil on, day after 
 day, bowed in body and spirit by incessant, and in 
 general unremunerating labor — shifting, when no 
 longer able to bear it, the same undiminished burden 
 on the shoulders of their sons, which had been cast 
 by their fathers upon themselves. It is to lighten 
 this load, that I thus appeal to the generous sympa- 
 thies of their more enlightened brethren, the enter- 
 prising and intelligent farmers of Pennsylvania, of 
 whom I am certain she holds within her rich and 
 beautiful domain as many noble specimens as any 
 State in the Union can boast. To them 1 would es- 
 pecially appeal to advance the character of their pro- 
 fession, and promote the influence of the landed in- 
 terest, ard to place the husbandman in the position 
 he should o ^cupy in the scale of intelligence, and in 
 the consideration due to him morally, physically and 
 politically. 

It may be asked, how can this be done ? I answer, 
 by educating liberally tlie rising generation ; by en- 
 couraging and patronizing the Agricultural Press, 
 thereby sowing broadcast, as it were, the seed of in- 
 formation, 80 that every farmer may be provided with 
 a crop, if not for reaping, at least for reading ; and 
 by holding Agricultural Exhibitions, in which all 
 should participate, either as contributors or specta- 
 tors. But these plans cannot be carried out without
