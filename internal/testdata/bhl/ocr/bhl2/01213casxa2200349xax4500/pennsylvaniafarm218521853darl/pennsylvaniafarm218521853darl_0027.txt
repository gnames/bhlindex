a combined effort through County Associations and a 
 State Society. The State Society is formed, but so- 
 cieties such as yours should be maintained by every 
 county. When every county shall have its Agricul- 
 tural Society represented in the State Society, it will 
 then be easy to carry out the necessary plans for the 
 improvement of the whole. 

The most feasible and practical plan to arrest the 
 attention of the farmers of the present day, and call 
 them forth from their solitude to mingle in the in- 
 teresting and stirring scenes of competition and dis- 
 flay is the Agricultural Exhibition and Cattle Show, 
 t was held by the venerated Judge Peters, already 
 alluded to, that one good Agricultural Exhibition 
 was of more avail in stirring vip the dormant ener- 
 gies of the careless and indifferent farmer, than all 
 the essays ever written. In this, every intelligent 
 man, having experience, in such matters, must con- 
 cur. How can those be reached who will not read — 
 who, from habit, would deem it a harder job to turn 
 over a few pages than as many furrows? When, 
 therefore, precept fails to be available, we must rely 
 upon example. The Agricultural Fair and Cattle 
 Show are as cabalistic words, operating magically 
 upon the curiosity of the farmer — impelling him and 
 his family to go, where everybody is expected to go, 
 to see such sights of horses, cattle, sheep and swine, 
 agricultural products and implements. What book 
 or essay could be half so interesting and instructive 
 to such a man, as the broad and varied page present- 
 ed to him in the imposing tableau of a well arranged 
 exhibition ? Here are living pictures of animals that 
 breathe and move — aye, speak in tones and language 
 more eloquently and forcibly to his comprehension 
 and appreciation, than anything you or I could say 
 or write. These noble horses, of various degrees of 
 excellence in action, blood, bone and sinew, rivet his 
 attention, and bring him to think and compare them 
 with the dull unsightly beasts upon his farm, that 
 consume so large a portion of his corn, oats and hay, 
 without an equivalent, and his conclusion will be, 
 that the next colt he raises shall be an animal worth 
 looking at, worth his feed, and worth money when he 
 wants to part with him. Then there are the bulls, 
 cows, heifers and calves, of various breeds, under his 
 eye and within his reach — Durhams, Ayreshires, De- 
 vons and Alderneys — each challenging comparison 
 in size, beauty, handling, feeding and milking. He 
 examines, compares, and ventures an opinion upon 
 respectives ones, and anxiously awaits the award of 
 the judges, to learn whether he is anything of a judge 
 himself through their decision, should it or should it 
 not tally with his opinion as affecting his favorites 
 in the matter of premiums. lie turns to the sheep, 
 swine, poultry and implements, which serve to keep 
 tip the interest he felt on entering the show grounds. 
 He is astonished, not bewildered, because he knows 
 the use and meaning of every thing. He is only sur- 
 prised that animals and things so common and famil- 
 iar to him, should have been brought^ to such per- 
 fection — should have undergone such extraordinary 
 change, and he should not have known it sooner. 

What effect may it besupposed this lesson will exert 
 upon his future practice? None other than a beneficial 
 one. The emulation implanted in the breast of every 
 right-minded man will inspire him to make an effort 
 to produce things equal to what ho has seen, so far 
 as stock is concerned, and to hope that at some not 
 distant period he will return to such a scene, not only 
 as a mere spectator, but as a contributor and compet- 
 itor. Once this resolve is made, a new era dawns 
 upon the condition of his farm — for who would have 
 fine cattle, sheep and swine, but would naturally de- 

sire to have fine pastures, well-tilled fields, good 
 fences, comfortable stables, large manure heaps, and 
 heavy crops, all of which being compatible and in- 
 dispensable to the position he designs in future to 
 hold among his spirited brother farmers ; and hence 
 bo will become a useful man in his neighborhood, 
 stirring up by his example the apathetic and careless, 
 who, witnessing the results consequent upon his skill 
 and energy, cannut fail of being stimulated to adopt 
 a similar practice. Here, then, is one of the many 
 advantages resulting from Agricultural Exhibitions, 
 one which my own experience and observation have 
 fully confirmed. What has rendered the agriculture 
 of New York of late years so prominently conspicu- 
 ous among her sister States, but her well established 
 Agricultural Societies — which, through a spirited ef- 
 fort made at first by a few notable and patriotic indi- 
 viduals, persevered in under many discouraging cir- 
 cumstances, proved so successful, that there is not a 
 county I believe in the Empire State that is not im- 
 pressed with the seal and attestation of the beneficial 
 effects of Agricultural Associations — while the whole 
 United States views the Annual Exhibition of the 
 New York State Agricultural Society more in the 
 light of a national affair, in which all feel a just 
 pride, than a mere State institution. Ohio, our west- 
 ern neighbor, is following with rapid strides the ex- 
 ample New York has set. So with Maryland, who 
 has entered the field, determined to wreathe her 
 brows with a leaf from the palm of distinction. 

With these animating examples before her, it 
 would have ill become Pennsylvania, with all her 
 acknowledged capabilities to compete with the great- 
 est and the best, to fold her giant limbs and look on 
 unmoved, an unconcerned spectator of this race of 
 progress, and not make one invigorating bound to 
 keep them in condition, or by way of showing that 
 neither one or many States could gmake a patriotic 
 demonstration, without Pennsylvania participating 
 in it. State pride, and every enobling impulse that 
 nature in her finest mood puts in play, could not but 
 urge her to contend, now, as ever, for precedence in 
 whatever can exalt, dignify, or adorn ! Impelled by 
 these aspirations, she stood nobly forth at lier capital 
 the beginning of the last year, and entered the field 
 of competition, under the title of "The Pennsylva- 
 nia State Agricultural Society," and in the name of 
 "Virtue, Liberty and Independence." Her Agricul- 
 tural I^shiljition last fall showed she was perfectly 
 in earnest ; and if it d d not prove her in advance of 
 her sister States, it demonstrated she was not far be- 
 hind those who had gone the farthest. The cause 
 which has been cherished for ages by the most en- 
 lightened nations is worthy of Pennsylvania ; and it 
 should be our ardent desire, that for the character of 
 the State, the honor and prosperity uf her citizens, 
 our good old Commonwealth should gain for herself 
 an imperishable name, in raising to the highest rank, 
 through a generous and liberal policy, the peaceful 
 and interesting pursuits of agriculture — that she 
 may bo the victor in the race now being run, and be 
 crowned with a cliaplet, more to be prized, than ever 
 decked the brow of the most successful warrior of 
 the tented field ! 

From the rank which it was my pride to aspire to, 
 and to which I may in some degree claim <o have at^ 
 tainod among those who have la])0red to promote ag- 
 riculture, it may bo expected that I should speak of 
 the principles of scientific culture in connection with 
 chemistry; but were I competent to the task, it would 
 be of doubtful expediency to investigate or refine up- 
 on principles of science on an occas on lik;; the pres- 
 ent. But a mere pertinent reason may bo given, a
