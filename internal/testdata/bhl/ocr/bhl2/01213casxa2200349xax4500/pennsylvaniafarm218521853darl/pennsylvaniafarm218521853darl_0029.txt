IIEN-COCK GAME FOWL. 

The following letter from Mr. D. Taggart to Dr. 
 Kerr, in relation to the peculiar variety of Game 
 Fowls in his possession will be read with interest : 

Accidental qualities may be transmitted from pa- 
 rent to child, as the following will show. 

A friend of mine, the late Robert Grant, owned a 
 fine large breed of Game Fowls — shawl neck, or Irish 
 grays ; the Cocks weighing seven pounds. One of 
 his roosters, when a mere chicken, stepped into the 
 fire, and roasted off his toe-nails. He hardly ever 
 got an offspring that did not, more or less, show his 
 parentage, by defective toes. I procured a couple of 
 his progeny, and have the Hen yc>t. Her Chickens 
 and grand-chickens have the same signs. Is it not 
 wonderful that a mere accident should thus mark at 
 least four generations ? 

Two years ago, I purchased, from a gentleman in 
 Bloomsburg, a very odd-looking Chicken, a Pullet 
 four or five months old. Though very small, weigh- 
 ing now not more than two pounds, (see Portrait,) 
 she has the appearance and characteristics of Dr. 
 Bennett's "Wild Indian Game Hen, except the vast 
 difference in size. I was struck with the resemblance. 
 She is firm-flcshed, short-feathered and almost comb- 
 less ; and has the most peculiar gait I ever saw. — 
 Her pertinacity in sitting is most extraordinary. I 
 will try to send you her portrait. Her mother, no 
 larger than herself, was imported from Calcutta. — 
 And, though my Pullet is the result of crossing with 
 an ordinary Game Cock, the breed is so strong that 
 she resembles her mother in all respects, and her sire 
 in nothing. You may form some estimate of her 
 fighting blood, when I tell you, that Cocks out of her, 
 by a Booby, (the meanest of all gallinaceous athletes) 
 or other Dunghill Fowl, are a full match for our best 
 Game Chickens. — Dixon & Kerr's 0. & D. Poultry,

V BOLTON GRAY, OR CREOLE FOWL. 

The Bolton Gray or Creole Fowl is sometimes call- 
 ed Dutch E very-day-layers, Pencilled Dutch Fowl, 
 Chittaprats, &c. They were originally imported from 
 Holland to Bolton, a tovra in Lancashire, England, 
 whence they are named. The ground color is pure 
 white, minutely shot or touched with black, except 
 on the neck, giving rise to the name Pencilled Fowl, 
 and from the frequency of their being brought over 
 to London, by Rotterdam steamers, they are called 
 > " Dutch Pencilled Fowl," or " Dutch Every-day- 
 layers." A good Cock uf this breed may weigh from 
 four to four and a half pounds, and a lien from 
 three to three and half pounds. I found them 
 good layers, but have thought the Eggs to be watery 
 and^innutritious. 1° wrote to a friend who knows the 
 Fowl well, having kept the variety for several years, 
 and his reply is,—" Of the richness of Creole Eggs, 
 compared with those of less prolific breeds, I am 
 scarcely able to speak. Though I have owned Cre- 
 oles for a dozen years, I have never made any care- 
 ful comparison. But, from analogy, I would infer 

that an Egg would prove rich in proportion as it was 
 small, compared with the Hen that produced it, cceto- 
 ris paribus. A Cow, nearly dry, generally gives much 
 richer milk than one that yields abundantly. 

" The superiority of a Creole Hen does not consist 
 as much in rapid as in continued laying: She may 
 not produce as many Eggs in a month, as some other 
 kinds, but she will lay more months in the year than 
 probably any other variety. I have had Creoles sev- 
 en or eight 3'ear8 old, tliat never became broody, and 
 which have laid, in that time, at least six hundred 
 Eggs in this fashion : — First year, one hundred and 
 eighty or two hundred. Second, one hundred and 
 fifty. Third, one hundred to one hundred and twenty. 
 Fourth, seventy or eighty. Fifth, forty or fifty. — 
 Sixth, eighteen or twenty. Seventh, almost total bar- 
 renness. This statement shows the extreme folly of 
 keeping Hens after the third, or even the second year. 
 For, besides the great falling off in Eggs, they are 
 apt to prove infertile, when laid by superannuated 
 Hens." — Dixon & Ker/s Ornamental and Domestic 
 Poultry.
