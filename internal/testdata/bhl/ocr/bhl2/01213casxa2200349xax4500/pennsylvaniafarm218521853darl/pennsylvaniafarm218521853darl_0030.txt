The following, from that excellent work, " Buist's 
 Rose Manual," will doubtless prove interesting to our 
 lady readers; 

Budding, within these few years past, has greatly 
 increased in nursery practice, and multiplied the 
 plants to a wonderful extent ; it is the favorite mode 
 with the French growers, and on the stock which they 
 use, plants will grow for half a century. I have seen 
 them in the neighborhood of Paris, like large trees, 
 with stems six inches in diameter, and heads thirty 
 feet in circumference. To cultivate them in such 
 perfection they use every kind of enriching matter, 
 which they freely apply every year. Almost every 
 rose can be propagated by budding; indeed, I may 
 say, that every variety can be multiplied in that way, 
 and form handsome plants, when on strong stocks, in 
 one year. For some of the kinds it is the only re- 
 sort, as they are difficult to manage by either layer- 
 ing or grafting. Some of the Perpetual Roses rarely 
 form roots when laid, but bud freely. Budding may 
 be easily described so as to be understood by the ini- 
 tiated, but as it is to the unpractised hand that we 
 pretend to give our feeble instructions, we will en- 
 deavor to omit no detail, even at the risk of being too 
 minute. The operation may be performed with any 
 sharp thin-bladed knife, though one called a " bud- 
 ding-knife," with a thin ivory handle, is best for the 
 purpose. It should be inserted about half an inch 
 above the bud, and passing about one-third of the 
 way through the wood of the shoot, come out again 
 about the same distance below it, the cut being as 
 clean as possible. The portion of the bark in the 
 centre of which the bud is situated, is called the shield 
 and when removed it contains a portion of the wood, 
 which is to be carefully removed with the point of 
 the knife, as shown in figure I;* if the wood is dry, 

*The Bengal, Tea, Bourbon, and some other free growingkindg) 
 may be suceeBsfully budded without removing the wood; in such 
 cases it is better to cut the bud a little thinner, and not so long ; in 
 this way they have been known tcyraake a growth and flower 
 within six weeks after the operation. 

and does not separate readily, it is a sign the bud is 
 too old, and it should be rejected. When the wood is 
 too old or too young, the shield may be taken off only 
 about one-quarter of the way through the shoot, and 
 inserted into the stock without removing the portion 
 of the wood it contains ; this method, particularly 
 with very young shoots, is very successful. If it is 
 necessary to transport the buds some distance, this 
 may be safely done by cutting a portion of the shoot, 
 and after stripping off the foliage, wrap it up in damp 
 moss, a few large leaves, or wet paper, and it may 
 then be kept for three or four days. In applying the 
 bud to the stock, an incision is to be made lengthways 
 through the bark (but not so as to injure the wood,) 
 about an inch in length, and this is to be diagonally 
 crossed at the top by another incision, as shown in 
 fig. 2. The thin ivory handle, or back of the knife, 
 should then be used to raise the bark, as shown in 
 fig. 3, and the shield inserted within, gently pressing

it to the bottom of the perpendicular incision ; when 
 it is properly placed, the portion of it above the dia- 
 gonal cross should be cut off as in fig. 4, and great 
 care should be taken that it is in close contact with 
 the wood of the stock. When this is done, bind up 
 with damp matting, or cotton twist, all except the 
 bud, (see fig. 5,) which must be left free to the air,
