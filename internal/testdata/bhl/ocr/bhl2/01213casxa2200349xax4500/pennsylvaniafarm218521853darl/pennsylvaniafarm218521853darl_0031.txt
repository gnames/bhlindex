In eight or ton days the success of the operation will 
 be known, and in two or three weeks the bandages 
 must be loosened, though not entirely taken away. 
 From June to the middle of September budding may 
 be done, choosing always cloudy weather ; or a few 
 days after a heavy rain ; but for limited operations 
 any evening may be chosen, always following the in- 
 dication of the free parting of the wood from the 
 bark, for if the bark does not rise with facility the 
 buds are liable to perish for want of a due supplj' of 
 nourishment. The buds should always be selected 
 from vigorous young wood that has never flowered. — 
 About the end of October the plant should be cut 
 down to within a foot of where the operation has 
 been performed, which will greatly tend to strength- 
 on both the tree and buds that have taken. In the 
 following spring all the stocks should be deprived of 
 their superfluous wood; observe, however, to leave 
 one bud or eye above the inserted bud, which will 
 greatly assist its growth till it has made a few leaves, 
 and is fit to perform the functions of vegetable life, 
 when the natural shoot must be cut oif. As the new 
 plant grows have it carefully supported, for one gust 
 of wind in a moment of time, will decapitate the most 
 cherished object. 

Cultivation of Strawberries. 

The following practical directions in regard to the 
 cultivation of the strawberry, and the selection of the 
 best varieties, we copy from the horticultural depart- 
 ment of the Genessee Farmer: 

1st. The ground (if not done last autumn) must be 
 trenched eighteen inches or two feet deep, as soon as 
 it is dry enough to work, turning in a liberal supply 
 of old well decomposed manure — say at least a cart 
 load to a square rod. When the ground has been 
 trenched thus, it should all be turned over again, so 
 as to pulverize it and mix well all parts of the soil and 
 manure. "When this is done, rake off and level the 
 surface, and it will be ready for the plants. 

2d. Procure good, strong, well rooted runners, or 
 transplanted runners of last season. Plant in rows, 

say three feet apart, the 
 plants eighteen inches 
 apart in rows, for all 
 the sorts with large fo- 
 liage ; the wood straw- 
 berries {Alpines) may 
 be six inches closer 

3. Keep the 
 clean and well hoed as 
 an onion bed all sum- 
 mer, and cut off all run- 
 ners as fast as they ap- 
 pear, unless wanted to 
 increase the variety, 
 burr's new fine. Fig. 1 and then only two or 
 three should be allowed on each plant. In the au- 
 tumn the plants will be luxuriant and large, covering 
 half the ground, and in a fine condition to give a 
 good crop next season. In dry seasons, mulching 
 with a little tan bark, saw-dust, or old manure, will 
 assist their growth very much. 

4th. Wintering. — In 

Insects Injurious to the Rose. 

Brown's Fumigator is a very simple portable instru- 
 ment for the destruction of Green-fiy, so prevalent 
 amongst roses ; the whole force can be brought to 
 bear upon any plant in any situation by covering the 
 plant with a sheet, if against a fence, or when fully 
 exposed, all round ; place a covering over it in the form 
 of a tent, then introduce the nozzle under the cover- 
 ing, and by a simple turn of a handle, the tobacco 
 smoke is delivered cool in a dense mass, and with the 
 greatest safety in the hands of any operator. The 
 implement is also indispensible in fumigating green 
 houses, wardrobes, ships or dwellings during epidemic 
 diseases. It can be used as well for purposes of per- 
 fuming with lavender, cinnamon, or other aromatic 
 herbs. The Rose Bug is another very destructive en- 
 emy, which can be kept under by handpicking; they 
 are found upon the flowers as soon as open. There 
 is also the worm that destroys the bud before it opens. 
 We seldom observe tliis in the country, but in some 
 seasons it abounds in the city or town gardens, and 
 must be extirpated by the hand. — Rose Manual.

 very useful, greatly

 or and productive- 
 ness of the planta- 
 tion the following 
 season. We always 
 do it here in Roches- 
 ter. 

5th. Treatment of the plants during the bear- 
 ing SEASON. — Attend to the culture of the soil as on 
 the first season, keeping it clean and friable ; keep 
 down runners ; and provide for a liberal supply of 
 water in case of drjuth. The greatest drawback in 
 strawberry cuUure, with us, is dry weather at the 
 time of the swelling of the fruit ; and if wc want them 
 large, we must apply water fredy — let it flow over 
 the plants in torrents three or four times a week. — 
 Weak liquid manure, occasionally, will be a great 
 aid in giving size. The result of all our o])?crva*a<m8 
 at home and abroad, in regard to strawberry culture, 
 if, that great size and heavy crops can only be ob- 
 tained by a liberal supply of moisture in connection 
 with deep rich soil. We have no space now to quote 
 examples in support of this, but the fact is unques- 
 tionable, and it will be well to bear it in mind.
