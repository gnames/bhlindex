 0:i the Culture of Indian Corn. 

Mr. Editor: — Indian corn being the most valua- 
 ble of the cereal crops now produced by the farmer 
 in Pennsylvania, as also in contiguous States, the best 
 mode of cultivation, or the mode of cultivation by 
 which the best results can be obtained, is a question 
 of the greatest importance to the farmer. The corn 
 crop is the more valuable to the farmer, because it 
 yields twice, thrice, or quadruple the quantity the 
 wheat crop yields in fair average seasons. It is not 
 liable to the attacks of the many enemies to which 
 wheat is exposed — the fly, frost, mildew, blight, smut, 
 etc. — and being better adapted for, and more largely 
 used, than any other grain, as the food of the various 
 animals and stock of the farm, it is emphatically ilic 
 crop. It is upon this grain, comparatively speaking, 
 that all stock prepared for the market by the feeding 
 of grain, is fed; and there is no grain upon which 
 the graminivorous animals and fowls pertaining to 
 the farm, delight so much to be fed, or can be so eco- 
 nomically fed, as Indian corn, besides furnishing one 
 of the most wholesome and nutritious articles of diet 
 for men. The question then arises what is the best 
 mode of cultivating the crop, or by what system can 
 the greatest result be obtained. Different qualities 
 of soil will doubtless require different modes of treatr 
 ment, and no set of general principles can be laid 
 ■down that will apply equally to all varieties of soil 
 and situation. It is, however, a trite saying among 
 practical men, that in the cultivation of the corn crop, 
 if it starts well, it will almost invariably produce 
 well, and if it does not start well, a poor crop may 
 almost as certainly be anticipated. If this, then, be 
 true, as an axiom or principle, it will be seen at a 
 glance the necessity of a system of tillage, calculated 
 in the best manner to stimulate and promote the 
 growth of the plant in the first stages of its existence, 
 as well as a system that will insure its perfect de- 
 velopement as it advances to maturity. 

In treating upon the cultivation of Indian corn, 
 the subject naturally presents itself under a number 
 of heads, or subdivisions, as plowing, manuring, 
 planting, &c. 

On Plowing. — In plowing for corn the mode and 
 depth must be determined by the natural properties 
 of the soil, and subsoil. In hard-pan and shale for- 
 mations, impervious to water, on which, in seasons 
 of a superabundance of rain, water is liable to lay 
 upon the surface until it is evaporated, and vegeta- 

tion thereby suffers from a surcharge of that element, 
 in which also, in seasons of drought, vegetation is 
 liable to suffer from the want of a supply of moisture, 
 by the impossibility of it arising to the surface from 
 beneath, the method of plowing most certain to in- 
 sure a good crop would be the ridge system — that is, 
 to ridge or throw the furrow slices together for every 
 row of corn, thus leaving the openings between the 
 rows to receive the superabundance of water in rainy 
 seasons, as well as to accumulate the soil in rows, 
 thereby to retain a greater amount of moisture in 
 time of drought. In permeable soils, however, ridge 
 plowing should ever be avoided. 

In limestone soils, underlaid by a stratum of clay, 
 experience has proven that if plowed to a depth suf- 
 ficient to turn the clay upon the sui-face, corn will 
 not start well — hence the necessity in this variety 
 of soil of not plowing so deep for corn as to turn 
 the clay upon the surface, otherwise to insure a good 
 crop, manure will be indispensably necessary to sti- 
 mulate it at the start. This variety of soil, however, 
 with sufficient pains and care in the tillage to put the 
 crop in a condition to start well, yields abundant 
 crops. 

In open gneiss and limestone soils, free alike from 
 clay, hard-pan, or shale, deep plowing is always com- 
 mendable. The decomposing strata beneath, posses- 
 sing highly fertilizing properties, acts as a manure, 
 besides affording more ample space for the ramifica- 
 tion of the roots of the plants, absorbing also the su- 
 perabundance of water in rainy seasons, as well as 
 allowing a larger supply of moisture to arise from 
 beneath in time of drought. 

The time of plowing for corn is also a subject of 
 diversity of opinion. Some farmers prefer to plow in 
 autumn, some early in the spring, while others prefer 
 leaving it as nearly as possible to the season of plant- 
 ing. Plowing in the autumn is resorted to as a re- 
 medy against the grub or cut-worm, and is perhaps 
 as efficacious in its destruction as any other means 
 that can be devised. Autumn plowing, however, if 
 the winter is open and rainy, and admitting of the 
 growth of grass during the winter and spring, leaves 
 the soil heavy and solid and by no means in the best 
 condition to promote the growth of the crop requiring 
 also an additional amount of labor in its cultivation. 
 Early spring plowing, as tested by experience, proves 
 to be nearly or quite as efficacious in the destruction 
 of the grub or cut-worm as autumn plowing, leaving 
 the soil, from the action of the late frosts, in an open 
 and porous and more favorable condition for the 
 growth of the crop than when plowed in the fall, re- 
 quiring also less labor in the subsequent cultivation. 
 Late plowing, or leaving it as nearly as possible to the 
 time of planting, may be as favorable to the growth 
 of the erop as earlier plowing, but in soils, or of sea- 
 sons, that grubs abound, the farmer may certainly 
 expect the annoyance and mortification of seeing the
