tender plants of his future hope preyed upon by these 
 pests, and l)o subjected to the inconvenience of sub- 
 sequent plantings, besides having his crop materially 
 injured. 

Manuring. — The quantity of land in this State 
 wherein the corn crop vrould not be benefitted by a 
 judicious application of manure is exceedingly lim- 
 ited. Corn, with all other artificial products of the 
 farm, may be greatly benefitted by the application 
 of barnyard manure, lime, plaster, ashes, or any oth- 
 er of the long catalogue of mineral, vegetable, or ani- 
 mal manures, which either stimulate the growth, or 
 furnish the elements of plants, and a judicious appli- 
 cation of manure will increase the crop from thirty to a 
 hundred per cent. In the present system of rotation 
 of crops, except In the vicinity of cities and towns, 
 where a supply of manure may be purchased, farm- 
 ers seldom have a sufiiclent quantity to give their corn 
 crops a dressing of stable manure. I now wish to 
 direct the attention of farmers to a system whereby 
 they may Increase their crop on an average forty per 
 cent, without additional expense, and with a large 
 retmuneratlon for the additional labor bestowed — that 
 Is, by the compost heap. If farmers would collect 
 the various substances, which are powerful manures, 
 and which otherwise are lost, and deposit them In 
 the compost heap, viz : the excrement of cattle drop- 
 ped about lanes and other places where they frequent; 
 the soil of rich spots about buildings devoted only to 
 the growth of troublesome weeds, ashes, poultry ma- 
 nure, the debris of wood-piles, and many othor sub- 
 stances which abound about the farm, a heap of com- 
 post would be obtained, yearly, sufficient if applied 
 to the hills of corn, to manure the usual quantity 
 planted in the system of rotation of crops now gener- 
 ally adopted, and Increase the crop from thirty to 
 forty per cent. Two men with carts will manure 
 three acres per day. The advantage of this quality 
 of manure over stable manure applied to the hills of 
 corn, is, that stable manure Is of a heating and dry- 
 ing quality, and is injurious rather than beneficial In 
 dry seasons, while the compost manure will retain 
 moisture equal to the earth Itself, In addition to Its 
 fertilizing properties. This manure Is within the 
 reach of every farmer who chooses to avail himself 
 of it, and tons are allowed to waste annually. Gyp- 
 sum Is reckoned to be beneficial to the growth of suc- 
 culent plants, and if the farmer wishes to try the ex- 
 periment of any of ih.Q fancies, as guano, poudrette or 
 bone dust, he may perhaps be rewarded for his labor 
 and expense. 

Preparing the ground for planting. —Tha ground 
 should be thoroughly pulverized by the use of the 
 harrow, and if it should fail in reducing the clods, 
 the roller may be advantageously used in connection 
 with the harrow. As an axiom, it Is impossible that 
 any plant can obtain nutriment from a clod, which 
 the feeders and spongloles of the roots cannot pene- 

trate. The marking out for planting should be In 
 transverse directions as nearly as convenient at right 
 angles. This will admit of more thorough cultiva- 
 tion, and efi'ectual destruction of weeds and grass, 
 and Insure greater regularity and certainty in the 
 quantity planted. As to the direction the rows should 
 run. It is a matter of little importance under our al- 
 most vertical sun. The distance of the rows from 
 each other is a matter of greater importance. The 
 growing plant of necessity requires a certain amount 
 of air and sunshine, as well as a certain extent of 
 space for the expansion of Its roots, and if deprived 
 of these requisites, will fail in producing as large a 
 crop as would otherwise follow, If allowed sufiiclent 
 space. There Is a maximum number of stalks to a 
 certain space that will yield the largest crop, and if 
 that number is exceeded the crop necessarily sufiers 
 from want of space to admit of its perfect develope- 
 ment, and not enough of stalks to a certain space im- 
 plies a waste of ground. That this maximum has 
 ever been arrived at with the certainty of a mathe- 
 matical calculation the writer has yet to learn. Cer- 
 tain customs, however, have been adopted which may 
 approximate very near to the point, and with the ad- 
 vantages of thorough cultivation afforded by marking 
 out four feet by four feet each direction, with four 
 stalks to the hill, may be very nearly the number of 
 stalks to a given space that will yield the largest 
 crop. 

Time and method of planting. — The time of plant- 
 ing should be varied according to the nature of the 
 soil. In open and friable soils corn may be plant- 
 ed advantageously much earlier than in ^wet or clay 
 soils. In the former variety of soil the seed may lay 
 In the ground for a considerable time, and the sur- 
 face of the ground be frozen, and sufier no injury, 
 and start as vigorously as soon as the genial rays of 
 spring may call it forth, as if it had not been com 
 mitted to the earth until the sun had reached its sum- 
 mer solstice. In wet or clay soils, prudence would 
 dictate not to commit the seed to the earth until it 
 had acquired sufficient warmth to cause it to germi- 
 nate Immediately, otherwise it would be In danger of 
 rotting In the ground. Corn, In all cases when 
 planted, should be well covered with pulverized earth 
 to the depth of from two and a half to three inches. 
 When covered the foregoing depth, if cut off in the 
 start by frost or grubs, it will again put forth with 
 but little appearance of injury, and if attended by 
 drought, will be much better enabled to withstand 
 Injury from that source. To insure success in the 
 cultivation of the corn crop, varieties should be chosen 
 best adapted to the different varieties of soil. In 
 soils admitting of early planting, late ripening varie- 
 ties, or such as require a long season to bring them 
 to maturity may be advantageously adopted, as it is 
 these varieties that generally yield the largest crops > 
 In wet or clay soils not admitting of early planting.
