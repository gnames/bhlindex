A challenge to the wool growers of the U. States. 

• We make the following extract from a letter re- 
 ceived from A. L. Bingham, of West Cornwall, Ver- 
 mont. Those who attended the State Fair, at Harris- 
 burg, -will remember the fine French Merino Sheep, 
 exhibited by Mr. B., to which were awarded the first, 
 as well as an honorary premium, by the committee 
 on sheep. Mr. Bingham's challenge is a broad one: 
 and we shall be glad to learn that there are other 
 ■wool growers in the United States, whose flocks are 
 of such a character as to induce them to accept his 
 proposition. We shall take pleasure in giving our 
 readers the result of Mr. B's. shearing, as well as of 
 any other that may be furnished us. 

" I propose on the 18th and 19th days of May next, 
 to make a public shearing of my French Merino 
 Sheep for the express purpose of giving the public 
 an opportunity of judging whether these sheep carry 
 any wool on their backs or not. I shall shear from 
 50 to 100 against a similar number from any 
 one man's flock in the United States, in an unwashed 
 state. I say unwashed, because it is the fairest way 
 of testing the merits of the different breeds. The 
 whole shearing will be under the special direction of 
 a committee appointed at the meeting. The weight 
 of fleeces and carcasses shall be most carefully ascer- 
 tained, so that there may be no doubts as to the ac 
 tual result. 

I will at the same time dispose of a few yearling 
 bucks just imported ; also a few ewes, and exhibit 
 some specimens of crosses of the French on the Span- 
 ish ewes, and some cattle and horses of improved 
 breeds. The attendance of yourself and friends would 
 be highly gratifying. 'Yours, 

A. L. Bingham.

Errata. — Several vexatious blunders crept into 
 our first form, in consequence of the unavoidable ab- 
 sence of our proof-reader, at the time of sending it to 
 press : 

For " mesine" in eleventh line, second column, on 
 page 6, read messure; and for "Hydro-feno cyanite" 
 in fourth paragraph first column page 7, read " Hy- 
 dro-/erro cyanite." 

The second paragraph of the article on corn, on 
 page 7, should read as follows : For the last six years 
 I have been experimenting, for the purpose of ascer- 
 taining the best mode of growing corn, and have come 
 to the conclusion that one great error into which our 
 farmers fall, is that of planting too close ; from three 
 feet to three feet six inches being the distance usually 
 allowed between the rows each way. 

New Clubs. — As we hoped and anticipated, new 
 Club lists are flowing in upon us, and old ones with 
 handsome additions are following them. Press on 
 the good work friends, and we will do our part. 

Cochin China Fowls. — Those desirous of purchas- 
 ing fowls of this variety, are referred to the adver- 
 tisement of Mr. Sampson, of West Roxbury, Mass. 

Shangh^s. — We are requested to state that Aaron 
 Clements, Cedar Street, above Ninth, Philadelphia, 
 has on hand a number of superior Shanghses which 
 are offered for sale on reasonable terms.

The Boole of the Farm, detailing the labors of the far- 
 mer, steioard, ploioman, hedger, cattle-man, shepherd, 
 field-worher and dairyman, hy Henry Stephens, with 
 450 illustrations. To lohich are added explanatory 
 notes, remarks, etc., by John S. Skinner, Editor of 
 the Farmers' Library. 2 vols. New York: CM. 
 Saxton, Agricultural book publisher. 
 These noble volumes devoted to the interests of 
 the farmer have been laid on our table, by the 
 publisher. It is not necessary that we should 
 more than refer to this book. The high character of 
 the author, as well as the American editor, (the late 
 John S. Skinner, the pioneer of American agricul- 
 ture,) should at once commend it to public favor. — 
 However much we may boast of the progress we are 
 making in husbandry, it is not to be denied that Eng- 
 lish agriculturists are far in advance of us. Hence, 
 the experience of those familiar with the English 
 system, cannot fail to prove beneficial to the Ameri- 
 can farmer, and more especially, when the genius of 
 a man like Skinner has been brought into requisition 
 to adapt the work to our own country. It is hand- 
 somely printed, abounds in valuable and well exe- 
 cuted illustrations, and can be purchased on the most 
 reasonable terms. 

Rural Homes, or Sketches of Houses, suited to Ameri- 
 can country life, toith original plans, designs, &c., 
 hy Gervase Wheeler. New York : Charles Scrib- 
 ner, 145 Nassau st. 

We are indebted to the publisher for a copy of this 
 beautiful volume, and have examined its contents 
 with no ordinary feelings of pleasure. It is precisely 
 such a volume as has long been needed by the Ameri- 
 can farmer; having for its leading object, the embo- 
 diment of a fixed principle in rural architecture." — 
 Every variety of home usually needed, will be found 
 embraced in it, with plain, yet complete and accurate 
 details in relation to the site, model, expense, warm- 
 ing, ventilation, selection of furniture, &c., with 
 practical directions to the inexperienced builder in 
 relation to contracts, specifications, &c. The whole 
 work is admirably adapted to the diffusion of more 
 refined taste in the erection of country houses; com- 
 bined with utility and economical expenditure. A 
 specimen of beautiful typography, abounding in il- 
 lustrations of masterly execution, and furnished at 
 the low price of $1.25, it should at once find a place 
 in every man's library, who is desirous of improving 
 the character of American rural architecture.
