other a rolling, instead of sliding frittion ; this kind of teeth, 
 on account of their round«d form, work much deeper into 
 each other, and have little or no inclination to lift out of gear. 
 The last cut shows the construction of tke truck wheels, 
 which are 1^ inches larger in diameter, and revolve on larger 
 circles at the ends of the power — giving them an advantage 
 over the smaller wheels. A section of a link is shown with 
 the end of the flooring attached ; these planks are all one 
 inch wider, and consequently ^vearup by use much closer, 
 before bending or breaking under the weight of the aniraali. 
 As a Rack and Pinion Power, the latter haseveryad vantage 
 over the common kind in use; is manufactured at a less cost; 
 is equally strong and durable, and is more easily handled, as 
 its weight is some two hundred pounds less. 
 Either of the above kinds of poweis are offered to the public, 
 each upon its own merit, with a full warranty as to workmanship, 
 material and operation, (and witli a guarantee of right of using in 
 all parts of the United States,) subject to be returned within three 
 mouths — and purchase money refunded. For prices, &,c., see Illus- 
 trated Catalogue, furnished gratis on application, or by mail. 
 ) The first on the list is the highest in cost, and is found preferable 
 t in all cases, and under all circumstances. The pov/er of the re- 
 I volving platform being applied to the main shaft, by means of reels 
 ■with larger diameters than the pinions used in the Rack and Pin- 
 ixi Powers, the stress upon the several parts is in no way as great 
 — and the liability of wear or breakage, froni use or accident, is 

■ removed. The whole of the gearing consists of less than one ser- 
 I enth the number of cogs in the Rack and Pinion Power ; and these 

are wholly removed from under the horses to the outside of the 
 po.ver — free from dirt, dust, &c., and always easily kept in order 
 or cleaned, which is an advantage over all Rack and Pinion Pow- 
 ers. This power has also the advantage of the changing of force 
 and velocity to accommodate it to any variety of work, without 
 any additional cost or danger to the gearing or other parts. When 
 the main shaft runs but fifty six revolutions per minute, the diame- 
 ters of the gears are such as to increase or decrease the velocity 
 to two hundred and twenty-four, or as slow as fourteen revolutions 
 per minute, when the animal, (either horses or oxen,) walk but two 
 miles perhour — being about two thirds the travel which is neces- 
 sary with the Raekand Pinion Power, to produce the same effect. 
 This last fact is one of its principal features, and of the greatest 
 importance to the farmer. The gearing, as well as puUies and 
 1 couplings, allagree, and can instantly be transposed — each to each, 

■ and side to side In this power the centers of motion of the gears 
 are always in the same position to each other — requiring no guard 
 or binding truck over the chain above the pinions, to keep the 
 gears together, as is absolutely necessary with all rack powers, 
 and which serve to check the force of the power ; and as the dri- 
 ving faces of the teeth on the rack become worn off, the loss of 
 force increases, until they eventually stop, break, or slip by each 
 other. The length of the sections or linksof the chain, as also the 
 width of the planks of the flooring, are same as in the Improved 
 Rack Power last described. With the above advantages, toRccher 
 ■with the epicycloydal formof teeth, adopted this season in its con- 
 struction, the superiority of this power is readily seen. 

This power isadmirably adapted for driving Threshing Machines, 
 Circular Saws, Cotton Gins, as also Machine Shops, Elevators 
 Ferry Boats, Discharging and Loading vessels, Pile driving. Cross 
 cat sawing, Pumping, Grinding Grain, Churning Butter. Cutting 
 Hay and Stalks, Shelling Corn, Grinding Apples, &c. The angle 
 of elevation necessary to operate this power, is never greater, but 
 often less than either of the others here described, and which is 
 inside of one^and a half inches to the foot, with horses weighing 
 1000 pounds each, and without any h.nrness. It has also an admi- 
 rable arrangement for adjusting and tightening the chain, not pos- 
 sessed by either of the others — together with an improved brake for 
 stopping the whole instantly — all within the power and independ- 
 ent of the band and pullies, and does not require to be chanijed, 
 ■when gears and putlies maybe. The pulley used for threshing, 
 with this power, is but three fset diameter, to effect the same as a 
 four feet wheel ■with the rack and Pinion Power. 

In all cases the shafting of all machinery mmufactured byus is 
 made to run in Babbetted Boxes, tliey being the most durable and 
 perfect box in use— and not generally used by other manufacturers
