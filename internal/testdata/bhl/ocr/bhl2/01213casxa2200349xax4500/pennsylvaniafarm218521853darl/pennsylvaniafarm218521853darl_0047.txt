Disparagement of the Farmiug profession. 
 A very common and most pernicious error which 
 ' prevails to a considerable extent in nearly every 
 portion of the community is, that farming is the sim- 
 plest of all arts, requiring nothing more than mere 
 physical strength to manage it in all its details. — 
 The idea that mental exertion is in any degree re- 
 quisite, is wholly lost sight of. Many believe that 
 when a man, endowed with good stout limbs, and 
 a strong constitution, has proven himself mentally 
 unfit for other pursuits, that he is just the person to 
 make an excellent farmer. Farmers themselves fre- 
 quently entertain the same opinion ; especially those 
 who cling so tenaciously to the "good old way" and 
 reject the advantages of which science so earnestly 
 invites them to avail themselves. Now this is all 
 error — hurtful error — and the sooner it is banished, 
 the sooner shall we find husbandry assuming its 
 rightful position. So long as men are led to rank 
 agriculture as a calling fitted only to broad shoulders 
 and empty minds — just so long will the pursuits of 
 the farmer be lowered in the estimation of the other 
 professions. 

But why should this be so ? What single argu- 
 ment can be advanced in favor of such an absurd 
 opinion, Snd what possible excuse can be ofiiered in 
 extenuation, by those farmers who thus disparage the 
 high character of their profession ? If there be any 
 one pursuit in life more closely allied to science than 
 all others ; that pursuit is agriculture. Science is 
 made to play a part in the daily operations of the 
 farm. Geology and mineralogy explain to the farm- 
 er the formation of the earth's crust — the character 
 and quality of the rocks and soils which compose it, 
 and the various properties and uses of the minerals 
 hidden beneath it. Chemistry, his bountiful mistress 
 extends to him her fostering care. She teaches him

to analyse his soils as well as his plants, and under- 
 standing the constituents of each enables him to adapt 
 the one to the other, and thus produce the most suc- 
 cessful results. She analyses the food he prepares 
 for his stock, and with the unerring certainty of sci- 
 ence points out the properties and value of the differ- 
 ent kinds of grain, roots, &c., so that ho clearly un- 
 derstands what kinds possess fattening qualities, what 
 muscle forming, and what supply and strengthen the 
 bones. 

We might thus refer to every department of science 
 —to mineralogy, botany, natural philosophy, &c.— 
 and show the intimate relationship that holds be- 
 tween them and agriculture ; but enough has been 
 said to disprove the disparaging assertions already 
 alluded to. From the most trifling operation on the 
 farm, to the minutest analysis of soils and plants, 
 science is the ready and willing handmaid of the 
 farmer. The simple truths every day presented to 
 his observation, (simple, however, only when practi- 
 cally demonstrated,) are the brilliant results of per- 
 servering research of men of the most exalted genius. 
 How few there are, who appreciate the wasting toil 
 and energy that were required to devclopo and de- 
 monstrate these apparently trifling yet all important 
 truths. 

And yet, in the face of all these facts, men will 
 tell us that physical strength is the only essential re- 
 qusite for the farmer and what is worse still, many 
 formers tliemselvas, if not by their words, sanction 
 by their actions, this slander. If a son gives evi- 
 dence of an intellect a little superior to that of his 
 sire, the farm becomes too limited a field for his 
 genius, and agriculture too insignificant a profession 
 for his transcendent powers. The lawyer, the diA'ine, 
 or the physician's office is considered his legitimate 
 sphere, and the youth who might become an excel- 
 lent former, ends his career as a second or third rate 
 lawyer, preacher, or doctor. When shall there be au 
 end of this? and when will the science of formin<' 
 be esteemed as it should be ? We answer, when the 
 spirit of progress shall have penetrated to every farm-
