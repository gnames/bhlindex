house — when the sons of our farmers shall be taught 
 to respect and reverence the profession of their fath- 
 ers — when they shall learn to know and feel that ed- 
 ucation will supply that skill, and that interest, 
 which will render farming as lucrative and honora- 
 ble as any other pursuit. It will end when the thou- 
 sands of American farmers who are possessed of the 
 means, will venture beyond the beaten track of their 
 ancestors — explore the hidden mysteries of nature — 
 examine and understand her various processes, and 
 thus fit themselves to till the earth more successfully 
 — when every blade of grass, every leaf and plant 
 and vegetable, will possess for them an interest suf- 
 ficient to lead them to investigate its character, 
 and understand the broad principles upon which 
 its germination, developement and maturity de- 
 pend. It will end when every tiller of the soil learns 
 to regard his own profession as one of the most hon- 
 orable, ennobling and scientific of human pursuits — 
 when mental as well as physical energy will be 
 deemed absolutely essential to successful husbandry, 
 and when the idea that men who are unfit for every 
 other pursuit, will make good farmers, shall be fully 
 exploded. 

Benefits of Green Manuring, «Sjc. 

In the May number of our first volume, page 41, 
 will be found an article on " Experimental Farming," 
 communicated by Wm. Stavely, Esq., of Bucks co. 
 In that article Mr. S. stated the fact of his having 
 plowed down green corn, some of which had attained 
 the height of teii feet ; and from a portion of which, 
 ears of corn suitable for table purposes had been 
 gathered. The experiment was one of such an unu- 
 sual chacter, so far as the size of the corn was con- 
 cerned, that many doubted, not only the practicabil- 
 ity of plowing under corn ten feet in height, but the 
 possibility of any good resulting from it. From the 
 following, it will however be seen that Mr. Stavely 
 has not only shoAvn the practicability of plowing the 
 corn under, but the advantages which he derived 
 from such a course. 

The field on which the experiment was tried, con- 
 tained 47 acres, ten of which were green manured 
 with corn. On these ten acres " not a fork-full of 
 other manure" was applied, while to the remaining 
 37 acres, manure had been freely given. The result 
 was, that the average yield of the ton acres was fully 
 equal to that of the remaining thirty seven, and the 
 average of the whole field was a little over thirty- 
 four bushels to the acre, or sixteen hundred and six 
 bushels and nine pounds, on the whole 47 acres. 

Now when it is remembered that Mr. S's. farm, at 
 the time he took possession of it a few years since, 
 was in a poor state of cultivation, (it having been a 
 rental farm for ten years previously) the result is 
 pregnant with importance to the agricultural interest. 
 It proves conclusively, (if proof were needed) that 

by a judicious system of green manuring, most soils, 
 especially waste lands, may be brought to a fair de- 
 gree of fertility. 

Mr. Stavely has succeeded equally well with his 
 other crops. Some corn, the product of his farm, 
 was exhibited at the State fair at Harrisburg last 
 fall, which was certainly as fine as any we have ever 
 seen. The ears averaged in length fourteen inches, 

and were remarkably well filled. Mr. S. informed us 
 that notwithstanding the excessive drouth of last sea- 
 son, the average yield per acre was Jifig bushels, and 
 we have reason to know that the corn on exhibition 
 would have received a premium but for the fact that 
 the mode of entering it for competition, to entitle it 
 to a premium, was overlooked. It was a mixture of 
 the gourd seed and flint varieties. 

In adverting to the excellent yields of wheat and 
 corn upon Mr. Stavely 's farm, we earnestly commend 
 his example to those of our readers who are longing 
 for a home in the west. There are thousands upon 
 thousands of acres in Pennsylvania, in a condition 
 similar to that of Mr. S's. farm when he took charge 
 of it — lands, which, originally fertile, have been re- 
 duced by the skinning system, (so prevalent with a 
 certain class of our farmers,) almost to exhaustion; 
 and which by the same judicious system of cultiva- 
 tion as that pursued byMr. S. might again be brought 
 to a remunerative degree of fertility. If a more 
 methodical system of farming prevailed in our State 
 — a system based upon truthful principles, and gen- 
 erally adopted — not only would husbandry become 
 more profitable, but those who pursue it would de- 
 rive from it such delight and satisfaction as the neg- 
 ligent, hap-hazard tiller of the soil can never know.

 Cultivation of SAvede Turnips. 

Mr. Editor : In yours of the 15th, you ask how 
 we cultivate Turnips. As we are now going through 
 the preparation of the soil ; it can readily be done. 
 We have just finished sowing a three acre lot of 
 Swede Turnip after a crop of early seed Peas ; the 
 ground was first all plowed 7 inche deep, then harrow, 
 ed, rolled and harrowed ; afterwards cross ploughed- 
 harrowed and rolled. The ground was then di-illed 
 up 27 inches wide, and manure spread in the drills 
 at the rate of 15 to 20 cords per acre. We then split 
 the drills covering up the manure, rolled down the 
 ridges and with the seed-barrow sowed the whole, — 
 a few drills put in with Guano at the rate of three 
 cwt per acre by way of experiment. 

After cultured, as soon as the plants have shown 
 their third rough leaf, we then thin to four inches 
 apart, hand hoe the edges of the drills, and hoe-har- 
 row between them which we very frequently repeat 
 till the crop covers the whole ground. At the second 
 hoeing, we thin the roots to 8 inches apart. The 
 weight of crop far surpasses those cultivated in the 
 ordinary way. We consider Rutabaga or Swede Tur- 
 nips an indespensable crop ; feeding it from January 
 to April to the whole of our stock. The Red top and 
 White Dutch Turnips we cultivate in the same way ; 
 sowing the rows about 22 inches apart and using from 
 12 to 15 cords of manure per acre. The crop is general- 
 ly put in from the 12th to the 20th of August. The 
 above culture leaves the ground in beautiful order 
 and perfectly clean. One acre well cultivated will pro- 
 duce a greater amount than two managed in the usual 
 way and not require half the labour to handle and 
 feed them. Yours truly, R. Buist.
