pose of it by the slow process of burniffg. Without 
 pretending to much scientific knowledge, it appears 
 to me that to caat spent tan bark into our creeks and 
 rivers, is to be condemned not only on account of the 
 filling up of mill dams &c., but as a downright waste 
 of what, (with a little care and patience) may be 
 made a valuable fertilizer. 

Being slow of decomposition its effects when ap- 
 plied to the soil in the form in which it comes from 
 the tannery, if not positively prejudicial, are so long 
 in manifesting themselves, that few persons are will- 
 ing to risk the one, or wait for the effects of the other. 
 Having once had life — it being the product of vege- 
 table matter, it is reasonable to suppose that if pro- 
 perly decomposed, it will furnish food for vegetation. 
 Such at least has been the result of my experience 
 with it. The immense quantities of tanners bark 
 annually wasted for want of a proper knowledge of 
 its true value, induces me to present to your readers 
 my plan of rendering it available as a fertilizer. 

Having some years since received permission to 
 take as much as I desired of spent bark from a 
 neighboring tannery, I set my men to work, with 
 carts, and hauled several hundred loads, which I 
 composted in the following manner. First a bed of 
 tan about two feet thick, over which I spread a hea- 
 vy coating of lime, covering the lime with a layer of 
 very wet barnyard manure, to a depth of five or six 
 inches ; then another layer of tan, followed by the 
 lime and manure, and capping the whole heap with 
 another layer of tan. This was in February — the 
 season being a mild one. In the month of October 
 following, I cut the whole heap down with spades, ap- 
 plying another dressing of lime as the work pro- 
 gressed. I found that the tan was decomposing as 
 rapidly as I could have expected, and that the com- 
 post looked Avell. It was then permitted to remain 
 untouched until a year from the following Spring, 
 when part of it was applied to a field which I intend- 
 ed for corn, at the rate of about twenty large cart 
 loads to the acre. The result was as fine a crop as I 
 ever had, although no other manure had been ap- 
 plied, either in connection with the tan, or for two 
 years previously. 

The balance was drawn on to a field which I put 
 in wheat, and here the result was as gratifying as in 
 the case of the corn. The crop was heavy, yielding 
 more than thirty bushels to the acre of as well filled 
 wheat as any farmer could desire. 

Within a few years its value as a top dressing for 
 strawberries and raspberries has begun to be proper- 
 ly appreciated. Nothing better can be applied to 
 strawberry beds in the fall, than a good top dressing 
 of well rotted manure, followed by a coating of tan 
 fresh from the tan yard, (if need be,) sufficiently 

thick to cover the plants, all but the top or crown. 

Raspberries glory in tan— it appears to be the very 
 food they need : and if supplied to them in sufficient 

quantities, the result will be, flourishing and fruitful 
 plants. Apply it in the fall ; and in the spring "spare 
 not your hand," as it is plentiful and maybe had for 
 the hauling. E. S. P.

[Last season we experimented, to a small extent, 
 with tan in the cultivation of celery. In digging our 
 trenches, we ordered one to be dug three feet deep, 
 causing the sub-soil to be thrown to one side and 
 its place, (to a depth of two feet) supplied by tan, 
 partially decomposed. Over this was spread the sur- 
 face soil to a depth of six inches. The celery was 
 planted in the same manner as in the other trenches. 
 During the early part of the season there was no 
 perceptible difference between the growth of the ce- 
 lery in the trench to which the tan was applied, and 
 those to which it was not. But as the season ad- 
 vanced, and the almost unprecedented drouth cast a 
 withering influence upon all vegetation, that in the 
 former, grew vigorously — retained a fine, healthy 
 deep green color, and produced an excellent crop; 
 while in the latter, although water was applied as 
 freely as to the other, and the treatment similar in 
 every other respect, it was almost an entire failure. 
 Whether the tan possesses fertilizing qualities adapt- 
 ed to the growth of celery, or whether its merits in 
 this case consisted merely in supplying moisture, so 
 essential to its growth, we are not prepared to say. 
 We record the experiment for the benefit of those who 
 may feel disposed to pursue the investigation further.

 Planetary Influence. 

'' Can any one explode a science without first learning it?" 
 Mr. Editor : I do not pretend to be at all versed 
 in lunar influences — having never made the "signs " 
 subservient to my farming operations, preferring to 
 do all things at the proper time — and trust to Provi- 
 dence and the seasons for a return. Yet, as I have 
 occasionally met with results that would seem to fa- 
 vor the popular belief in planetary influence, I hope 
 that a crude article on the subject will not retard the 
 " onward march of truth and knowledge ;" but ra- 
 ther cause closer inquiry into the hidden mysteries 
 of nature, thereby enabling those having the know- 
 ledge, to explode those "fallacies," if such they be. 
 It would be well, however, for persons who undertake 
 to ridicule the opinions of others less enlightened 
 than themselves, to first prove all things, and hold 
 fast that which is good. It is most unreasonable for 
 persons to scoff at the belief in effects, resulting from 
 causes which they are unable to fathom or compre- 
 hend. Or, we might ask, are they so learned and 
 wise as to believe that nothing more remains to be 
 discovered ? Is it not because planetary influence on 
 mundane affairs is advocated and believed mainly by 
 the illiterate, and not taught in the schools — that
