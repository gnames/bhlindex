they deride and ridicule it as prejudice, popular delu- 
 sions, humbug, &c., &c. 

I propose to give you a few facts, Mr. Editor, which 
 have fallen under my own observation, and offer 
 some explanatory remarks in relation to lunar influ- 
 ence. 

Some twenty-five years since, just as I was about 
 finishing the planting of a field of corn, a neighbor 
 passing by, told me I would have a short crop of 
 corn that year. I enquired his reasons for so singu- 
 lar an expression, as the field was in good order, and 
 the corn planted, as I thought, at a favorable time. 
 After considerable palaver he told me "the moon 
 was in the wrong sign." I could not do otherwise 
 than "make a note of it." The field produced over 
 eighty bushels of shelled corn to the acre, with ra- 
 ther a dry season. In this instance, the influence 
 of the moon must have been overpowered by other 
 influences. 

On another occasion, I had two post-and-rail fences 
 set contiguous, on each side of a lane, about twelve 
 feet apart. As it happened, the one was set when 
 the sign was down, and the other when the sign 
 was up. The result of this experiment was ; that 
 in less than a year the bottom rails of the first fence 
 settled down in the ground, while the other is full 
 four inches above ground at this day — now twelve or 
 fifteen years since. 

Again, a neighbor of mine (curious in such mat- 
 ters) had some black-oak trees split into rails during 
 the ruling of a particular "sign" — these rails he 
 used for post fence. After standing twenty years, 
 the fence was removed, and the rails were then sound 
 and hard as a bone. Ordinarily, black-oak rails rot 
 in ten or twelve years. 

I will not at present advert to the "dinner in the 
 pot" further than to note a remark which I have oft- 
 en heard made in relation to butchers meat, and 
 which any person may have noticed — that, sometimes 
 during the process of boiling, the meat remains 
 plump, covering the bones entirely when brought to 
 the table ; while at other times, it shrinks away, and 
 the bones can be seen protruding out from the meat. 

The southings of the moon is another " sign" that 
 may be made a note of by any stickler against 
 " moonology." When the new moon stands for south, 
 warm weather may be anticipated, particularly when 
 she is still tending south, — and when far north, cold. 
 This is a sure guide as relates to warm or cold wea- 
 ther. Also, when fruit trees come into full flower 
 during the wane of the moon — little fruit will be the 
 result that year. 

Unfortunately, most of those who are so ready to 
 prognosticate changes of weather, at the change of 
 the moon — or who confidently assert that certain 
 "signs" will produce certain results on vegetation 
 consequent on the passage of the moon through a 
 particular sign of the zodiac— do not know the vari- 

ous counter effects produced by other influences, and 
 merely utter their predictions, because others before 
 them are the same. 

Now it is not alone the moon in her passage thro' 
 the signs, or at her changes that is to be regarded as 
 producing changes in the weather, &c.; but the sun, 
 the planets, all have their share in these influences — 
 being posited in the different signs — being direct or 
 retrograde, casting their aspects in varied directions; 
 this constant change of the planets, creates a corres- 
 ponding change in the influences exerted on our 
 planet, and who is capable of foretelling the constant 
 and ever varying results ? 

The skeptic, who is undoubtedly quite as much in 
 the dark as the most illiterate "moon gazer;" find- 
 ing the prediction of his ignorant informer fail, at 
 once jumps at conclusions, and decries the whole aa 
 "moonshine," for, says he, the laws of nature are 
 immutable, "imperative" and there should be no 
 failure. Let the reader be the judge whether error 
 or ignorance is the greater enemy to truth and know- 
 ledge. 

The inspired writer informs us, that God said, "let 
 there be lights in the firmament of the heavens to di- 
 vide the day from the night, and let them be for 
 signs and for seasons, for days and years." 

The believer in planetary influence, knowing that 
 the sun and moon exercise such a powerlul influence 
 on the ocean, is naturally led to believe that the at- 
 mosphere must in like manner be acted upon, as the 
 medium through which this influence is exerted on 
 the ocean — and as science informs us, there are also 
 atmospheric tides, — by a parity of reasoning, they 
 therefore conclude that, it being admitted by science, 
 that the planets are capable of exerting so great an 
 influence upon the waters of the ocean, and upon the at- 
 mosphere ; is it not reasonable to suppose, that mun- 
 dane affairs generally are in like manner subject to 
 their influence ? The air is breathed by all animate 
 beings, and acts upon all substances, and this air is 
 constantly being acted upon by the planets. But 
 says the skeptic, the sun and moon attract the waters 
 of the Ocean by a gi-eat natural law, called gravita- 
 tion, and can have no effect on the weather. Well 
 "what's in a name ;" suppose we call this planetary 
 influence, gravitation, andwhatthen? Why simply that 
 your plants can not vegetate without this medium, 
 air and water ; and your " crout and bacon in the 
 pot " will require the same medium, to become at all 
 palatable ! Even your shingles on the roof are con- 
 stantly exposed to its influence, and the weather 
 which your learned ones tell you is "solely regulated 
 by temperature over which the moon has no control," 
 is, and must be, influenced by this all pervading 
 agent. Now this is a most singular admission by the 
 opponents of planetary influence, as if temperature 
 were a thing separate and distinct from stellar influ- 
 ence; for be it remembered, we do not pretend to say
