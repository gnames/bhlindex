by any means, that the moon, a mere satellite, pro" 
 duces all these changes of the elements, but that all 
 the plants act their part. Why is it that among the 
 whole human race no two individuals can be found 
 the counterpart of each other, precisely alike in form, 
 features, disposition, &c. " Man was formed in the 
 image of his maker," and the whole human family 
 cast in one mould as it were, and yet no two individ- 
 uals ever existed who were alike in every particular. 
 May not the ever changing aspects of the planets 
 have some rule or influence even in this matter ? 

A few remarks in relation to your correspondent in 
 the January No., will close this article. 

He must certainly have forgotton a portion of his 
 astronomical education, or he could not have made 
 so singular a remark as " that if a certain quarter " 
 of the moon "should produce rain, &c." and ask, 
 " why does not one sort of weather pervade the whole 
 earth, at the same time?" for, he continues, "at the 
 same instant, a sign of the moon will prevail equally 
 in Terra del Fuego, and in Kamscliatha, in Green- 
 land and in Borneo." Now the little knovrledge I 
 have of astronomy, informs me that the planets, the 
 signs, and consequently the aspects, are progressive, 
 varying, changing every moment. How then could 
 the same sign prevail at opposite extremities of the 
 earth at the same instant of time ? 

When I had written thus far, your March No. 
 made its appearance, and I was pleased to see, that 
 so able a writer as L. J. P. has entered the lists in 
 defence of the truth. I therefore close for the pre- 
 sent. Respectfully,

 XiUnar Influence. 

Mr. Editor: — A fair correspondent in your No. 
 for March, m reply to " Franklin," has, I humbly 
 believe, (not intentionally,) taken hold of the wrong 
 end of the " stocking ; (the figure is her own,) and, 
 consequently, failed to unravel the mystery of lunar 
 influence. Without attempting to follow the thread 
 of her discourse through all its devious windings, I 
 purpose only to touch on one or two points : 

First — " Every observer and gardener knows, that 
 some vegetables do grow faster when the moon is 
 near the full, than when she gives little or no reflect- 
 ed light." From subsequent remarks, I am led to 
 believe she thinks this to be the case. The lady, I 
 suppose, is aware, that plants will not thrive in the 
 dark, that light is as essential to their growth as heat, 
 moisture or air — therefore, if plants do really grow 
 faster about the full of the moon, it is because they 
 are exposed to more light in a given time, then, than 
 at any other period ; and not to any fertilizing pro- 
 perty communicated to them by the atmosphere, de- 
 rived from the moon. This is the opinion of one ob- 

servant gardener, at least, whatever others may be- 
 lieve. 

The second point in her argument I intend to no- 
 tice, is Lunacy, so called. This, I do the more 
 reluctantly, because your correspondent has said, "I 
 therefore, at the risk of being classed with the unfor- 
 tunates referred to above, assert my earnest /aiY/i in 
 the venerable doctrine of lunar influence." Now, sir, 
 I maintain that no effect which solely rests on faith, 
 for its cause, without positive evidence ought to be 
 believed by any rational being, especially when the 
 true cause has been found out by clear investigation 
 and actual experiment, as in the present case. 

Without entering into the pathological charac- 
 ter of mental alienation, and the various opinions 
 of ancient and modern writers on the subject, 
 allow me to inform L. J. P. that the idea of sol-lunar 
 influence in the production of insanity, has long since 
 vanished before the light of modern science and me- 
 dical investigation. Now, faith in sol-lunar influence 
 is all moon-shine, by tests and experiments, admitting 
 of neither doubt nor cavil, which the following will 
 clearly prove. 

Insane persons have been confined in places where 
 the light of the moon could not reach them, when 
 that satellite cast her full beams on the earth, and 
 no return of " raving madness" came upon them. — 
 This experiment, which has been tried probably a 
 thousand times, clearly proves that excessive light is 
 the cause, and not lunar influence. But the truth 
 of this proposition has been tested by another expe- 
 riment, quite as conclusive, viz : by the sudden intro- 
 duction of bright light into a room containing insane 
 patients, at stated periods, which was found, in every 
 case, to cause a return of the disease to a greater or 
 lesser degree. I might name other modes of demon- 
 strating the same truth, known to the medical faculty, 
 but at present forbear. One word more to the lady 
 and I have done. " My belief is not a theory, but a 
 conviction founded upon long observation and re- 
 peated experiment," I ask her for one proof by expe- 
 riment. Medicus.

 Geology applied to Agriculture, Xo. 2, 

The disturbing causes of which I have treated in 
 the first number and which afford us the great varie- 
 ty of soils so familiar to every farmer, opens up a 
 field to the geologist, unlimited in extent, interest 
 and importance — and which has been crdtivated dur- 
 ing the present century with wonderful energy and 
 ability. It may be safely said too, that few, if any, 
 branches of science have imparted more useful knowl- 
 edge to man than Geology. 

It is not my intention to treat of the science gene- 
 rally, but only to illustrate, so far as I may be able, 
 the geological character of our own State, especially 
 that east of the Allegheny mountains. Those who
