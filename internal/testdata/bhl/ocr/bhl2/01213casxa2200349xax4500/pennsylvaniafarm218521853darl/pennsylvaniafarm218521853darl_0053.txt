wish to acquire a more intimate knowledf:;e of the 
 gcicnce, should have recourse to some of the easy ele- 
 mentary -works, such as Richardson's, Hitchcock's or 
 St. John's, but those who would delve deeper and lay 
 up larger stores, may resort to the works of Lyell, 
 Mantell, De La Beche, &c. More special application 
 of the science to agriculture has been made by John- 
 son, Liebig, Bousingault and other writers on agri- 
 cultural geology and chemistry. 

The State of Pennsylvania lies within the temper- 
 ate zone and stretches in its greatest length from east 
 to west. We might therefore expect to find an equa- 
 ble temperature, or a uniform climate throughout the 
 State, but its physical character produces great va- 
 riety in climate, whilst geological formations give 
 diversity to the soil. On the eastern boundary we 
 have a large tidal river, and on the western a fresh 
 water lake, both of which contribute to the humidity 
 of the atmosphere over a wide extent, and the whole 
 State is well watered by long and meandering rivers. 

The condition of the atmosphere is further greatly 
 influenced by altitude; and the mountain chains 
 which traverse our State from N, E. to S. W. produce 
 an influence on the temperature, which with a level 
 surface could only be found in high latitudes ; besides 
 a dryness or hygrometric effect which is chiefly due 
 to elevation or altitude. 

Before speaking more particularly of the forma- 
 tions that distinguish the several portions of our 
 State, it is necessary to allude to a great modifying 
 cause which prevails almost every where, and to 
 which mighty process of nature, we are indebted for 
 a large part of the surface or sub-soil which covers 
 the rocky masses beneath — I allude to the diluvial 
 or drift formation. 

It is supposed that at a former period, when the 
 " waters covered the face of the earth," a current 
 prevailed over this continent in a southerly direction, 
 denuding or wearing away the softer or more easily 
 decomposable substances, and after carrying them a 
 greater or lesser distance, depositing them on the 
 surface so generally, as to leave in most places a soil 
 capable of sustaining vegetation. This drift forma- 
 tion spread over the whole land is greatly changed in 
 its character and properties, by the local formations 
 on which it reposes, — thus, when we are in a lime- 
 stone district, the decomposition and wearing away 
 of this rock fertilizes the diluvial coat, and when we 
 pass over the wide new red sand stone belt, which 
 60 readily yields to the action of the elements, we 
 perceive that the surface consists chiefly of the same 
 materials as the underlying rocks. When, however, 
 ■we examine the country where the hard primitive 
 rocks abound, we shall find that the drift has been 
 less altered by them than in the former instance. 

This diluvial or drift formation, so important in 
 the geological history of the earth, is different and 
 distinct from that of river or lake deposits termed 

alluvial — the latter being entirely local in their na- 
 ture and more limited in extent than the former. 

In Pennsylvania we have this latter formation along 
 the borders or valleys of the Delaware, Schuylkill. 
 Susquehanna and other rivers, extending, more or 
 less modified by drift, over considerable width of sur- 
 face, especially west of the mountains. 

The fine silt of the river bottoms belonging to this 
 class furnishes us with luxuriant meadows and gar- 
 den lands. Of this description is most of the soil 
 along the Delaware and Schuylkill, in the vicinity of 
 and below Philadelphia. The shores of the Susque- 
 hanna too, form a long range of exceedingly fertile 
 soil, being either entirely alluvial or compounded of 
 alluvial and diluvial deposits with the disintegrated 
 substances more recently washed from the hills 
 which overlook them. 

Between the river bottoms or alluvial of the Dela- 
 ware and the red sand stone belt is a primitive range 
 stretching across the State, and consisting chiefly of 
 gneiss, mica, hornblcnd, clay-slates, crystaline lime. 
 stone, serpentine, &c. Most of these rocks are too 
 hard to form by their own decomposition a deep soil, 
 but they have been pretty well covered by the drift, 
 which superadded to their own product have made a 
 light friable loam which yields well to the hand of 
 industry. Of the effect which the I'ocks of this dis- 
 trict have on the soil over-lying them, I shall speak 
 more particularly when treating of their composi- 
 tion. 

"These primary stratified rocks," says Professor 
 Rogers, " commence in a narrow point about six 
 miles E. N. E. of Trenton, expanding gradually in 
 their course to the W. S. W. until they form a broad 
 belt occupying the whole of the southern townships 
 of Chester, Lancaster and York counties, where they 
 leave our State and pass into Maryland. The south- 
 eastern margin of the formation crosses the Delaware 
 at Trenton, where it is well exposed forming the falls 
 jf the river. Along its course for several miles south- 
 westward a deep covering of diluvium, conceals a 
 large portion of the belt and precludes our discover- 
 ing its local features." 

" The greater portion of the southern and eastern 
 sections of Philadelphia county," continues Professor 
 Rogers, "shows a deep covering of diluvium conceal- 
 ing the gneiss and its associated rocks except where 
 they are exposed in the vicinity of streams. In this 
 part of their range the primary strata are much tra- 
 versed by veins of coarsely crystalizcd granite, in 
 which the three ingredients, ye?spar, quartz and mica 
 are often of unusual size, the felspar being generally 
 by far the most predominant mineral and exhibiting a 
 remarkable tendency to pass the condition of kaolin 
 by decomposition. This rotting by atmospheric in- 
 fluence is not confined to injected veins of granite, 
 but characterizes also a large part of the gneiss espe- 
 cially in tho country around Philadelphia, where tho
