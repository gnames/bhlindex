 Why farmer « M," lost his Cows. 
 Mr. Editor : — Some three years siace, in passing 
 a neighbor's farm, a most most noisome stench sa- 
 luted my nostrils. A glance served to explain the 
 cause. My neighbor's cow had died, as I supposed, 
 from hoven ; and, as is usually the case, the carcass 
 had been dragged to a distant part of the farm to be 
 devoured by the dogs and crows, and fill the atmos- 
 phere with its unhealthy odor. Neighbor M. being 
 one of those who regarded all improvements upon 
 the old system of farming as downright, dangerous 
 innovations, I thought this would be a fine opportu- 
 nity of convincing him of his error, and accordingly 
 called upon him as I passed his house. After a litr 
 tie general conversation, I introduced the subject of 
 the dead cow, by enquiring the cause of her death 
 and the mode of treatment pursued for her recovery. 
 As I anticipated, she had indulged too freely in the 
 use of rank young clover, and that the old and cruel 
 remedy of stabbing had been tried to relieve her ; 
 with what success the putrefying carcass in the dis- 
 tant fence corner too plainly told. Upon asking 
 whether no other remedies had been tried, he assured 
 me he knew of none. I then mentioned to him the 
 efficacy of the tarred-straw hand, referring to several 
 cases, in every one of which it had proven success- 
 ful. This had the desired effect. He immediately 
 became anxious to know all about the method of 
 using it; which information I freely gave him, at the 
 same time informing him that I had learned this 
 simple, but almost certain cure, from a source which 
 I knew he held in utter contempt — an Agricultural 
 Periodical. After pondering for a moment upon the 
 information he had received, he looked lue earnestly 
 in the face, and with an expression of seriousness, 
 almost ludicrous, remarked, " Neighbor B, I have 
 been acting the part of a very foolish man in under- 
 rating the value of papers devoted to farming. The 
 fine cow lying out yonder is not the first I have lost. 
 Last summer I lost two others with the same disease ; 
 and all for the want of that knowledge which Imiirht 

" to 

have acquired at an expense of a dollar or two year- 
 ly. We learn wisdom from experience, and I will 
 for the future strive to repair the error into which I 
 have f^illen by taking at least one Agricultural pa- 
 per." In this mood of mind I left him, fully satis- 
 fied Avith the success of my errand. M. is nowa reg- 
 ular subscriber to several Agricultural periodicals ; 
 and I am happy to say has lost no cows since that 
 time, from hoven. If you conceive this simple state- 
 ment worth presenting to your readers, it is at your 
 service ; and if it should appear, and neighbor M 
 chance to see it, I hope he will pardon the use I have 
 made of the incident. A. L. B.

[Our correspondent did not entirely fulfil his mis- 

sion to his neighbor, although he did well. The oc- 
 casion was susceptible of still further improvement. 
 Every portion of that dead cow's carcass might have 
 been turned to valuable account, instead of merely 
 furnishing a feast to troublesome dogs and crows, 
 and poisoning the surrounding atmosphere. All 
 well informed farmers know that animal substances 
 possess much greater fertilizing properties than veg- 
 etable. The action of animal manures is immediate. 
 The flesh of animals not only decays rapidly itself, 
 but imparts the principle to other organic substances 
 with which it is mixed. The blood possesses fertil- 
 izing powers in an equal degree. The skin, hair, 
 hoofs, horns and bones might all have been converted 
 to profitable use, and at less expense and trouble than 
 dragging the carcass to such a distance. All that 
 was necessary was to cover it sufficiently to prevent 
 the escape of the volatile matter when decay com- 
 menced, and the result would have been a fine mass 
 of rich fertilizing compost, which would have served 
 to replace, in some degree, the loss of the animal. —

 Cultivation of locust Trees. 

Mr. Editor : — The cultivation of the locust is be- 
 coming a matter entitled to serious consideration, as 
 our woodland is rapidly disappearing, and with it of 
 course, our material for fencing. To keep our farms 
 properly enclosed, as every farm should be, locust 
 posts are very essential. To provide against a con- 
 tingency which, in a few years, Avill certainly arrive, 
 (in our county at least) I beg leave to suggest the 
 propriety of at once commencing the cultivation of 
 this important tree. 

The locust is not difficult to propagate. Where a 
 plantation or nursery is to be raised from the seed, 
 the plan I pursue is to procure the seed from the 
 trees in the fall, pour boiling water over it, permitting 
 it to remain in the water twelve hours. I then plant 
 it in a rich mellow soil. It germinates very readily ; 
 and if the same attention is paid the 3'oung trees, 
 which is usually given to fruit trees, in three years 
 they will be large enough to transplant to the road- 
 side or along the division fences. Care should, how- 
 ever, be taken not to set them out (unless properly 
 protected) until they are large enough to be secure 
 from the attacks of cattle. 

By commencing with the seed tliis spring and sow- 
 ing a small quantity every succeeding spring, in the 
 cuursc of twenty or thirty years, a sufficient supply 
 will be had to fence any reasonably large farm. — 
 Twenty or thirty years may seem a long time to wait. 
 So it is ; but when it is remembered that at that 
 time locust posts will not be obtained as readily as 
 now, the objections to taking time by the foreli>ck, 
 and preparing a locust nursery at once, will be re- 
 moved. 

A difference of opinion exists in relation to the 
 durability of the various kinds of locust. That
