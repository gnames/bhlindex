not appear reasonable that the farmer may with 
 safety commence the work of reform, by introducing 
 a mule or two upon his farm each year. If, as is 
 very probable, the lightness of the mule be urged as 
 an objection to him ; this can be very easily remedied. 
 Select the largest mares and jacks, breed from them, 
 and in the course of a few years the breed will be so 
 much improved in size and weight as completely to 
 obviate this difficulty. E. Burford.

 Protect the Birds. 

The destruction of Birds has become a very serious 
 evil and highly detrimental to the agricultural inter- 
 ests; demanding the attention of those who desire the 
 increased prosperity of our country. 

This is essentially an agricultural country, a large 
 proportion of the people are engaged in the culture of 
 the soil, and as a consequence, whatever tends to 
 Increase the products of the earth, or prevent their 
 liability to destruction, is of great importance to the 
 community. 

Since the return of spring a great number of birds 
 have come back to us from their winter quarters in 
 more southern latitudes, rendering our fields and 
 woodlands cheerful with their melodies. This alone 
 should be sufficient protection for them against the 
 evil propensity man has to destroy them. 

AVhilst following the plow the past few weeks, I 
 have had an opportunity of witnessing of what great 
 benefit they are to the farmer. As I was turning up 
 the fresh earth, a flock of blackbirds and crows were 
 busily engaged in picking up the grubs and other 
 worms, which are ever ready to destroy the crop of 
 corn, as soon as it begins to germinate. I am quite 
 confident that these birds have done more good by 
 destroying the enemies that prey on the young corn, 
 than they will do harm by eating it themselves. But it 
 is not only the corn crop they benefit; there are 
 many diOerent species of birds requiring as many 
 different kinds of food, and having different habits of 
 life, each in turn serving the best interest of man. 

Some resort to the garden in search of the insects 
 that feed on the tender vines ; some are engaged in 
 the orchard dislodging from the trunks and branches 
 of the trees, the lurking Insect, or destroying the 
 caterpillars that feed on the leaves ; and among them 
 all, if we were to acquaint ourselves with their habits 
 and manner of living, how few we would find that 
 are a real Injury to the farmer. But how are they 
 regarded by a majority of the farmers ? If a black- 
 bird chances to pull a few stalks of corn, all his former 
 services are forgotten and, he Is regarded only as a 
 thief, and not nnfrequently expiates the crime by a 
 forfeiture of his life. Should an unfortunate wood- 
 pecker or robin alight on a fruit tree, and pluck a 
 berry ortwo; notwithstanding he may havedone much 
 by his labors to arrest the ravages of Insects, that 

might In process of time, not only have destroyed the 
 fruit, but the tree also ; he is considered an intruder, 
 and the farmer in his ignorance drives bim from his 
 premises. It is altogether wrong. A little observa" 
 tion and reflection would soon convince him that he 
 is doing himself an Injury; and that he had much 
 better take sxich measures as will prevent the depre- 
 dations of hunters, who with their murderous weapons 
 are fast destroying the means which the Creator, na 
 doubt, intended as a check on the Increase of the Insect 
 tribes. Agricola.

Process of Dissolving Bones. 

In reply to the inquiries of Mr. Shubart, of Bethel, 
 Berks county, we are enabled to present the following 
 directions, furnished by our correspondent, S. D.: 

For the Farm Journal. 
 Oxford, April 5, 1852. 

Mr. Editor : — Your correspondent at Bethel pro- 
 poses several questions on the process of dissolving 
 bones, that It will give pleasure to answer; more I 
 especially If It will encourage the more general use of 
 so valuable a fertilizer. 1st. How Jony will it take to 
 dissolve bones in their natural state, unyround ? It 
 would require so long a time that it would Injure 
 materially, or destroy any vessel used for dissolving 
 them in, and would require too much acid ; unless 
 the bon«s were first burnt. The burning rendering 
 them pervious to liquids, they would dissolve In a 
 short time. If well ground, from 6 to 10 days, is 
 sufficient to dissolve them. If not ground fine, It will 
 require a longer time. But it is a question to be 
 solved by nearness to facilities for grinding bones. 
 Whether the loss by burning,of the inorganic matter, 
 so rich In nitrogen. Is compensated for by the gain 
 arising from the additional expense necessary to have 
 the bones gi'ound. The burning of the bones I have 
 never tried, and cannot describe the process — but this 
 means of rendering them available has been highly 
 recommended. 

In what kind of vessel is the dissolving performed f • j 
 Any wooden vessel will answer the purpose, I use 
 our common meat vessels, cleansing them well before 
 and after use ; and after several years service they do 
 not appear to be matei'Ially Injured — the bones and 
 acid have generally remained In them two weeks, and 
 sometimes longer. 

What is the price of 100 lbs. of sulphuric acid ? — 
 It can be obtained from Chapell, Baltimore, for |2,50 J 
 per hundred pounds, by taking several carboys, Iti 
 can be bought for about the same, from the manufac-J 
 turer In Philadelphia, S. D. 

Shanghai and Cochin ChinaFowls. — Byreferencej 
 to the advertisement of Mr. Hunt; those who desire] 
 good, young fowls, from reliable stock and at fairj 
 prices, will know where to procure them.
