ble, can be purchased for one- third the amount. — 
 Why this great difference in price ? Perhaps you 
 ■will say the difference is caused by the greater mar- 
 ket facilities possessed by the Pequea farmer. So 
 far as ■wheat is concerned, the odds are evidently in 
 favor of the latter ; but in other respects they are 
 nearly equal. Our heavy iron ■works, and the fine 
 lumbering country in the vicinity, furnish us 'with an 
 excellent market for our other produce ; such as beef, 
 butter, eggs, &c. — a much better market indeed than 
 can be found in the sparsely settled sections of the 
 ■western States for these products. 

Our soil is, in many respects, preferable to that of 
 Lancaster county for wheat, but not so good for corn. 
 The average of the wheat crop of our valley, for the 
 last two years, has been twenty-five bushels ; and of 
 corn, about forty bushels to the acre. My own ci'op, 
 and that of several of my neighbors, exceeded this. 
 These are facts offered mainly ■with the hope of 
 drawing more general attention to this subject.

 Mineral food for the young Indian Corn plant. 

Mr. Editor : — It is generally admitted that if the 
 Indian Corn plant, gets a good start ; and appears 
 green and healthy looking, upon its first shooting out 
 of the ground, and can maintain its vigorous appear- 
 ance -whilst young, that its critical period is past. 

In the last number, I endeavored to explain the 
 use of Phosphate of lime, and the other fertilizers, 
 that should be supplied to corn ground, that is defi- 
 cient in the mineral constituents. I will proceed to 
 examine the subject further, and endeavor to show 
 the manner in ■which this most important crop may 
 be materially aided, in its early developement, not- 
 ■withstanding the ground in which it is planted, may 
 be of the richest that usually occurs in Pennsylva- 
 nia. 

There is constant danger attending the raising of 
 the larger kinds of Indian Corn, incident to late 
 Springs and early Falls, and much advantage is to 
 be derived from any treatment which has a tendency 
 to bring the plant to maturity, in the shortest possi- 
 ble space of time. 

When nature undertakes the task of procreation, 
 it provides a store of all the essentials for the early 
 ■wants of the embryo. But nature goes no farther, 
 and no surplus is ever found. So in the grain of 
 corn, ■we find all that is necessary to develope the 
 plant, and to furnish it with two leaves and a root, 
 and thus supplied with the means of procuring its 
 own living, leaves it to its new resources. 

In a state of nature, before man has deprived the 
 goil of any of its fei'tilizing elements, these muni- 
 ments were sufficient for the healthful supply of the 
 wants of the plants, more particularly so in this spon- 
 taneous growth, because the climate and length of 

season is adapted to their several wants. But this 
 is not the case with the artificial production of Indi- 
 an Corn, and therefore we must use our endeavors to 
 aid nature by artificially supplying the plant with its 
 necessary food, so that no time be lost, and that it be 
 not retarded by cold or hunger. 

Let us take the Indian Corn plant, just at the pe- 
 riod, when its stock of supplies from the grain is ex- 
 hausted, and we find it possessed of two leaves and 
 a root. Up to this time the phenomenon of growth, 
 consists in absorption of water, and new chemical 
 arrangements of the elements originally stored away 
 in the grain. The young plant is now prepared to 
 assimilate food, either from the atmosphere or the 
 earth. This process is very 'often retarded by the cold 
 nature of the ground, usually a good conductor, and 
 the scanty supply of mineral. In our best soils, this 
 latter is in such small proportions, that although am- 
 ple after the roots are better developed, yet very in- 
 sufficient for a speedy growth whilst the roots are 
 small and few. 

If, therefore, by artificial means, we can supply 
 immediately to the roots, heat and a small quantity 
 of such matter as is then required, we will aid the 
 plant in its time of need, and when further develope- 
 ment has taken place it will take care of itself. 

Wheat bran contains in abundance all the constit- 
 uents that the corn plant at that, or any other stage 
 of its growth, derives from the soil. By the applica- 
 tion of ^ of a pint of bran to the hill, and placing 
 the seed in it, and then covering the whole with earth, 
 we will place within reach of the roots of the young 
 corn all that for the time being is required. 

The bran as soon as it has become wet, will enter 
 into decay (eremacausis) and carbonic acid will be 
 formed and set free. Ileat will be evolved. The free 
 carbonic acid will aid in dissolving the mineral mat' 
 ter, and it will be taken up by the roots of the plant. 
 The root will soon extend over a larger surface and 
 will be adequate to continue the supply without this 
 artificial aid. 

Five bushels of bran by double measure, will be 
 sufficient per acre, and the farmer will, if his land is 
 in good order otherwise, be generously repaid in the 
 harvest time of his corn. 

This is but one of the many substances that I 
 might mention, and suggest to be used for this pur- 
 pose, but owing to the fact of its cheapness, and 
 complete constitution, I have chosen it for an example.

Lincolnshire Pigs. — We are requested to state 
 that Mr. Cyrus Haldeman, of Bainbridge, Lancaster 
 county, has for sale a number of pure Lincolnshire 
 pigs, which will be disposed of at reasonable rates. 
 He has also a few of the same, crossed with the Ches- 
 ter county breed, which he will sell.
