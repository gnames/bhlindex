who relies wholly upon his stable manure reflect a 
 moment upon the vast amount of valuable, organic 
 and inorganic material he annually loses from the 
 want of a very little care and attention. If he be a 
 man of observation, he cannot fail to perceive that 
 his carelessness^in this respect is a source of continued 
 and very frequently, irreparable loss. At least one- 
 half of the inconveniences and losses which farmers 
 siistain in meagre crops and in lands, gradually, but 
 certainly decreasing in value, are the effects of this 
 improvidence. We might refer to the various and 
 valuable manures which even many of our very best 
 farmers permit to be wasted ; but, as we intend 
 recurring to this subject again, we shall then endeavor 
 to point out in the plainest possible manner these 
 drains upon the farmer's purse, with the hope of 
 awakening a proper degree of interest in relation to 
 it. 

The next State Fair. 

We observe that a number of our newspaper ex- 
 changes announce Lancaster as the place selected for 
 the holding of the next State Agricultural Fair. We 
 have not learned upon what authority this announce- 
 ment has been made, as at the time of writing 
 (April 24th) the Executive Committee have not de- 
 termined where it shall be held. The probabilities, 
 we believe, are, that Lancaster will be the favored 
 spot, as we understand that no other place has en- 
 tered into competition with it. 

Pretention of Gum on Peach Trees. — A practical 
 gardener informs us that if the earth is removed 
 from the roots of the Peach trees affected with gum, 
 to a distance of one foot immediately around the 
 trunk, and finely powdered charcoal applied to them 
 the thickness of an inch, that it will eflectually check 
 the flow of the gum. 

County Societies. — Quite a number of the County 
 Agricultural Societies throughout the State have ac- 
 cepted our proposition to send them the Farm Jour- 
 nal in return for a list of the names of the officers 
 and head quarters of each Society. So soon as we 
 hear from all, we shall publish the list entire, in or- 
 der that the Journal may be a safe directory to those 
 who desire to communitate with the different Socie- 
 ties.

JOHNSON'S IMPROVED REVOLVING HAY 
 AND GRAIN RAKE. 

THIS Rake is got ap in detached pieces, so as to make it conve- 
 nient for transportation and storage, and so complete that any pair 
 of handles and shafts will fit on any Rake of his manufacture. The 
 above Rake can be obtained of the subscriber at his residence, or 
 at his Mills near Newark, Delaware, either by wholesale or retail 
 They can also be obtained at my several agencies established in 
 Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland and Virginia, of which exten- 
 sive notice has already been given. 

The utility of this Rake is so well established and extensively 
 known, that it is deemed unnecessary to dwell much upon its mer- 
 its in this advertisement. It is proper however, to state that it has 
 always been awarded the premium, at Agricultural Exhibitions 
 where the competition was fair. 

The utmost care is observed by the manufacturer in the selection 
 of timber for these Rakes. None but the best b3ing used for that 
 purpose. They are also ironed in the best manner. Having been 
 engaged in their manufacture for thirty years, the subscriber is 
 very desirous that the high reputation which these Rakes have 
 hitherto maintained should be sustained. It is therefore his wish 
 to dispose of them as far as practicable, by wholesale, 

Dealers in Implements will do well to send in their orders at 
 an early day. Orders shall be filled immediately, and the Rakes 
 delivered at the most convenient landing or depot for further 
 transportation. 

These Rakes have been found to be the most economical in use, 
 saving their cost at a single day's raking of Hay or Grain. They 
 have also been found very useful in taking straw from a thresher 
 to where it is wanted to be stacked. W. G. JOHNSON.

SIDLE' S HUB, AUGUR AND BOX REGULATOR^ 

THE subscriber residing in Dillsburg, York county, Pennsylva- 
 nia, has invented a new and improved Augur for the boring of hubs, 
 and setting the boxes of wagon, carriage and other vehicle wheels 
 for which I have obtained letters patent. 

The Augur will bore both ends of the hub at the same time, or 
 either separately — and is the most useful and important invention 
 of the age for inserting wagon boxes and the only Machine in ex- 
 istence by which they can be inserted exactly true — and is so per- 
 fectly simple in its construction, and constructed on such just me- 
 chanical principles, that it cannot possibly get out of repair. 

With this Augur a set of boxes can be inserted in a few minutes 
 — where under the old system it requires hours to perform the 
 same amount of work. 

Persons wishing to purchase Territory or Shop rights will please 
 address the subscriber, who will sell on terms that will enable the 
 purchaser to make money. HENRY SIDLE.
