increase of the curculio is attributable less to the dif- 
 ficulty of destroying it, than to the fact that compar- 
 atively few persons are familiar with its appearance 
 and still fewer with its destructive habits. 

Every spring their plum and apricot trees give 
 promise of an abundant yield of fruit. Little sus- 
 pecting the enemy that is lying in wait for it, they 
 use no precautions, and in a few weeks after blos- 
 soming, have the mortification of beholding the young 
 fruit rapidly decaying and falling to the ground. The 
 mystery is inexplicable. The tree is thrifty and 
 vigorous, the exposure excellent, and every thing as 
 it should be, yet the fruit perishes before they have an 
 opportunity of knowing either its size or quality. We 
 believe that if a knowledge of the appearance and 
 habits of this insect were more thoroughly diffused, 
 we should eventually succeed in devising some plan 
 by which to exterminate it. For the purpose of aid- 
 ing those who may not have seen the curculio we give 
 a cut of it, with a description and manner of attack- 
 ing fruit, from Dr. Harris' excellent work. 

" I have found these beetles as early as 

*the thirtieth of March, and as late as the 
 tenth of June, and at various intermedi- 
 ate times, according with the forward- 
 ness or backwardness of vegetation in the 
 spring, and have frequently caught them 
 flying in the middle of the day. They 
 are from 3-20th to l-5th of an inch long, exclusive of 
 the curved snout, which is rather longer than the 
 thorax, and is bent under the breast, between the 
 fore legs, when at rest. 

Their color is a dark brown, variegated with spots of 
 white, ochre-yellow, and black. The thorax is une- 
 ven ; the wing-covers have several short ridges upon 
 them, those on the middle of the back forming two 
 considerable humps, of a black color, behind which 
 there is a wide band of ochre-yellow and white. — 
 Each of the thighs has two little teeth on the under 
 Bide. They begin to sting the plums as soon as tlie 
 fruit is set, and, as some say, continue their opera- 
 tions till the first of August. After making a suita- 
 ble punctnre with their snouts, they lay one egg in 
 each plum thus stung, and go over the fruit on the 
 tree in this way until their store is exhausted ; so that 
 where those insects abound, not a plum will escape 
 being punctured. The irritation arising from these 
 punctures, and from the gnawings of the grubs after 
 they are hatched, causes the young fruit to become 
 gummy, diseased, and finally to drop ofi" before it is 
 ripe Meanwhile the grub comes to its growth, and, 
 immediately after the fruit falls, burrows into the 
 ground. This may occur at various times between 
 the middle of June and of August; and, in the space 
 of a little more than three weeks afterwards, the in- 
 sect completes its transformations, and comes out of 
 the ground in beetle form. 

The folloAving among other remedies that have been 
 suggested, may be fi)und useful in checking the rav- 
 ages of the plum-weevil. Let the trees be briskly 
 shaken or suddenly jarred every morning and eve- 
 ving during the time that the insects appear in the 
 beetle form, and are engaged in laying thier eggs. — 
 When thus disturbed they contract their legs and fall ; 
 and, as they do not immediately attempt to fly or 
 crawl away, they may be caught in a sheet spcard 
 under the tree, from which they should be gathered 

into a large wide-mouthed bottle or other tight ves- 
 sel, and be thro > n into the fire. All the fallen wor- 
 my plums should be immediately gathered, and, after 
 they are boiled or steamed, to kill the enclosed grubs, 
 they may be given as food to swine." 

When should Asparagus be Cut f 

Ask the market gardener, and he will tell you, that 
 it should be cut just when the crowns are protruding 
 from the surface of the ground, or have risen above it two 
 or three inches ; and as near to the root as possible. 
 Ask the majority of purchasers, (who generally give 
 sight the preference over taste, and who have never 
 perhaps had the opportunity of testing the merits of 
 the green kind,) and they will coincide with the gar- 
 dener. The gardener pursues this plan because it en- 
 ables him to offer a really beautiful vegetable, (white 
 from top to bottom) and very saleable. But ask 
 the man who gives taste the preference over 
 sight, and he will tell you that asparagus should 
 never be cut but very little below the surface of the 
 ground. During the present season we have sent a 
 considerable quantity to market. Consultipg public 
 fancy, we endeavored to have it as nicely bleached as 
 possible, and accordingly cut it as much below the 
 surface as we could. But for our own table we per- 
 mit it to grow to a height of six or seven inches above 
 ground, giving the stems sufficient exposure to the 
 atmosphere to become green, and then cut it off even 
 with the surface. The result is, that the stems are 
 wholly divested of that Avoody fibrous matter, so 
 characteristic of the white clear portions — they cook 
 tender and possess the true asparagus flavor. As- 
 paragus is fit for the table so long as the crown has 
 not expanded. If any of our readers are skeptical, 
 let them try it. 

Smut in Wheat. 

Mr. Editor : In looking over some of the back num- 
 bers of the Journal, I observed an article concern- 
 ing smut in wheat. While the remedy may be very 
 effectual, I think it altogether too troublesome. We 
 have a remedy in our county, which I have never 
 known to fail, although its merit has been tested by 
 a great many farmers as well as myself. 

For five bushels of wheat, take one fourth of a 
 pound of blue vitrol, and as much water as will dis- 
 solve it. Steep the wheat in this solution, or .spread 
 it on the barn floor and with a brush or wisp of 
 straw, sprinkle the solution over it. Rake it thor- 
 oughly, so that every grain is moistened. Let it lay 
 in this way for twelve hours, and it will be ready to 
 sow or drill as well as if it had never been moistened. 
 If any of your readers doubt the efficacy of this re- 
 medy, they can satisfy themselves by testing it on a 
 small scale.
