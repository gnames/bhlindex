not well fitted to sustain, at the commencement of a 
 rotation, a crop requiring much potash and ammonia, 
 and less needing phosphorous ; and we choose in 
 preference such, for instance, as rape, tobacco, &c. — 
 The ensuing crop of winter grain does indeed also 
 require much potash, but it should be remembered 
 that, after a dressing of fresh manure, a much great- 
 er quantity of this substance is present in the soil, 
 than the first cultivated crop requires, and that the 
 progressive decomposition of the soil itself, superin" 
 duced and renewed by the introduction of the ma- 
 nure, again furnishes an additional store of potash 
 in a soluble state. Potatoes, also, are not suitable as 
 a first crop after manure, because they require and 
 absorb so much potash from the soil, that the ensu- 
 ing crop is apt to suffer from the want of it ; and if 
 occasionally, land be found, on which winter grain 
 succeeds well after potatoes, it will be found that the 
 soil is naturally stored with a great abundance of 
 potash. In these respects beets also resemble pota- 
 toes. As the second crop in a rotation, wheat and 
 rye is preferable, because, though requiring large 
 quantities of potash soda, phosphoric acid, sulphur, 
 and nitrogenous ingredients,these substances are usu- 
 ally still contained in the soil in sufficient amounts 
 for a second crop. After winter grain, potatoes and 
 turnips would properly follow, because, by means of 
 their great vegetative power, they are able to seize 
 and appropriate the requisite elementary substances 
 which yet remain in the soil, though in a less solu- 
 ble state, after a crop of winter grain has been taken 
 off. At this period, also the superabundant nitro- 
 genous elements of the soil will have been reduced 
 to a proper equilibrium with the requirements of 
 vegetation, and are consequently no longer injurious 
 by their presence in excess. On the better kinds of 
 soil, however, spring barley may be introduced im- 
 mediately after winter grain, because this crop re- 
 quires a much smaller supply of nitrogenous sub- 
 stances than the preceding one did. It also needs 
 less potash, though more silicic acid is necessary, 
 which will have been provided and rendered soluble 
 by the preceding fall ploughing. Though barley re- 
 quires less phosphorus than winter grain, yet this 
 may be the reason why this crop does not succeed 
 well in some soils after wheat, inasmuch as in them 
 the store of phosphorus may have been totally ex- 
 hausted by the demands of the wheat. It is, how- 
 ever, always more prudent to let barley follow po- 
 tatoes or turnips ; not only because this accords well 
 with the true idea of a rotation, but likewise because 
 the barley will then certainly find a sufficient supply 
 of phosphoric acid in the soil and be enabled to pro- 
 duce a more plump and perfect grain. Clover should 
 properly follow after barley, because it draws the 
 substances it needs principally from a greater depth 
 of the soil, and finds them there in greater abund- 
 ance ; and a portion of those substances are subse- 

quently again deposited in the surface soil because 
 the roots of the clover while decaying, furnish sup- 
 plies of carbonic acid and nitrogen. The clovers al- 
 so, especially lucerne and esparcet or sainfoin, aid 
 the decomposition of the soil by the greater length of 
 time during which the occupy the land. These are 
 among the chief reasons why the clovers leave the 
 ground in a fertile condition, prepared not only for 
 the growth of winter grain, but for the recommence- 
 ment of a rotation of a longer or shorter course, ac- 
 cording to the condition and natural character of the 
 soil. As the concluding crop of the series oats may 
 very properly be introduced, because of all the cere- 
 als this plant possesses the greatest vegetative power, 
 while at the same time its predominant ingredient 
 is silicic acid, and it needs the presence of the other 
 elementary substances only in small quantities. On 
 these accounts it seems to be peculiarly qualified to 
 take up and appropriate what the previous crops 
 have left remaining in the soil. 

Note. — The summary of Agricultural Chemistry contained in 
 the consecutive numbers now concluded, is from the pen of Pro- 
 fessor Stockhardt, one of the principals of the Agricultural Insti- 
 tute at Tharand in Prussia, and co-editor of the monthly agricultu- 
 ral paper issued there. The views presented, it may have been 
 noticed, differ on some points from those of Leibig and his school; 
 but, being those of an experienced and experimental farmer, whose 
 operations are conducted with care and precision, for the purpose 
 of ascertaining the most reliable and most profitable application of 
 scientific principles to popular practice, they may claim attentive 
 and candid exainiiia(ioii, as properly at least as the more theoreti- 
 cal opinions of the great Chemist 

The "Chemisclie FeldprtdigUr" of Professor Stockhardt — a 
 course of lectures delivered in turn before some sixty Farmers' 
 Clubs in Saxony, and recently published at Leipzig — have been 
 well received, and will when completed constitute a valuable ad- 
 dition to the farmer's library, as the style is simple and the illus- 
 trations admirably adapted to the wants of those for whom the 
 work is intended. 

For the Farm Journal. 
 Tlie Ciuchona or Peruvian Bark Tree, 

Mr. Editor: — Your Farm Journal is a welcome 
 visitor in my family. Permit me to express the hope 
 that it may soon be in every farm house in the State. 

There is a matter pertaining to agriculture which 
 I wish to suggest ; and that is, the more extensive 
 introduction of foreign trees that may be ornamental 
 or useful. The matter I have especially in view is 
 the cultivation of the Peruvian tree yielding the Je- 
 suit's bark, which gives us the invaluable quinine. 
 Is it not the only specific for fever and ague ? I saw 
 last fall a statement that the disease named was ex- 
 tensively and distressingly prevalent in the western 
 country, and sufficient quantities of quinine to arrest 
 its course could not be obtained. The worth of the 
 man who " makes two blades of grass grow where 
 but one grew before," Swift has told us. Would he 
 not be a benefactor to his country who would accli- 
 mate the Peruvian bark tree among us ? I am aware 
 its native position is near the equator, but the Andes 
 and Cordileras are crowned with everlasting snows, 
 so that Peru must possess every variety of climate, 
 from that which produces the palm and ripens the 
 orange to that which yields hemlock and the pine. — 
 I know not whether this bark comes from the warm
