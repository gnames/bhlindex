other expenses from a small farm. If one acre is plowing for corn, and plow, harrow and cultivate my 

worth cultivating, one hundred is better ; because 
 the large field can be cultivated at a much less ex- 
 pense per acre, than the small one, and every acre of 
 a large field will produce more and better crops, than 
 an acre of a small lot, allowing b )th the same culti- 
 vation. If a farmer can make money by hiring five 
 men, he can certainly realize more by hiring twenty, 
 if he manages equally well. If a farmer improves 
 his lands they rapidly increase in value, particularly 
 in a new country. The increased value of a small 
 farm is small — the converse of the case is true with 
 large farms. Small country farms are not suited to 
 the genius of the American people. They are an 
 enterprising race. A large adventure suits them 
 best. I would like to see one field of a thousand 
 acres in corn in Pennsylvania. Do not start with 
 surprise, and suppose that it is my wish to persuade 
 any one man to swallow up the small farms of Lan- 
 caster county, by the expression of such a wish. Far 
 from it. 

I also agree with Mr. Stavely from Bucks county. 
 His experience and mine, relative to lime, have been 
 the same. It is certainly a good fertilizer, and a 
 cheap mode of renovating worn out lands. Indeed, 
 in many places it is the only enriching substance 
 that can be found in sufficient quantities to improve 
 the land. 

corn both ways, never using a hoe after it is planted. 
 A common good crop here, is fifty or sixty bushels 
 of shelled corn to the acre. Ninety bushels have 
 been raised to the acre in this county ; but this is a 
 rare occurrence. The opinion of your Lancaster 
 county correspondent is correct as to comparative 
 profits of corn and wheat. It is as easy to raise sixty 
 bushels of corn to the acre, as it is to raise twenty 
 bushels of wheat. Farmers are apt to over-estimate 
 the average of their wheat crops. I consider twenty 
 bu-ihels to the acre a good average crop, and am sa- 
 tisfied with fifteen bushels, taking all my fields to- 
 gether. A gentleman of this county, a few years ago, 
 raised a little over forty bushels of wheat to the acre, 
 and his whole crop averaged that year, over thirty 
 bushels. My best crop produced on one field, thirty 
 bushels to the acre, and an average that year of twen- 
 ty-two bushels. 

When I sat down I intended to notice all the arti- 
 cles in your last number, but it was too large a fur- 
 row for me to turn Over.

Mr. Keller's communication on your fourth page 
 is excellent. I treat my cornfodder just as he does 
 in curing it; but have not been able to save it from 
 moulding in the barn. I intend trying the plan he 
 recommends in storing it away. Well saved corn- 
 fodder is the best feed we have for cattle in the win- 
 ter. They will eat it in the spring, when they will not 
 touch the best of hay. A good, well saved crop of 
 cornfodder will come very near paying for the cul- 
 ture of the whole crop of corn. The cutter, and 
 crusher mentioned by Mr. Keller, I know nothing of, 
 but would like much to have it. Can you tell me the 
 price of the machine ? 

Mr. EUmaker, of your own county, has given you 
 a good article on corn planting. The time he recom- 
 mends for planting is no doubt about right for the 
 latitude of Lancaster county. From the 10th to the 
 20th of May, and even to the 1st of June, will do 
 here. Some care should be taken in the kind of seed 
 we plant ; but there is little to be gained by planting 
 too early. In furrowing out for planting, I prefer 
 three feet six inches each way, with three or four 
 grains in a hill. This would be too close for your 
 heavy Lancaster county land, ■yhere corn grows very 
 high, and gives much shade. Our small yellow and 
 eight-rowed white corn grows stout, and may stand 
 thick. It is not an uncommon thing to see three or 
 four or even five good ears on one stalk, and the stalk 
 not more than six feet high. I prefer spring to fall

Celery — In the cultivation of Celery we prefer land 
 that has lain sometime in grass, as it takes less time 
 in the preparing of the trenches than the ordinary 
 method ; and the grass being allowed to grow at the 
 edges forms a cool shade from our hot mid-day sun — 
 Our plan is to dig them from East to West, 4 feet 
 apart, 16 or 18 inches deep, a little wider than the 
 spade, after which we fill with short stable manure 
 (an old hot bed preferred) to the depth of 5 or 6 
 inches, and cover with 2 inches of good loam. 

The seed should be sown early in April, transplant- 
 ed when large enough to conveniently handle (into a 
 bed previously prepared and well manured) to the 
 distance of 6 inches that they may get good stocky 
 plants before planting in the trenches (which will be 
 about the middle of June) into which plant 6 inches 
 apart, taking care in removing to keep as much soil 
 on the roots as possible. After transplanting, water 
 well (if in dry weather) in the morning. 

An early crop of peas, dwarf or bush beans, Let- 
 uce &c., can be grown on the ridges between the 
 trenches, and will be off in time to earth up, which 
 operation should not be performed before September, 
 or they will be apt to rust. In earthing, great care 
 is needed in keeping any soil from coming in contact 
 with the crown of the plant, it is best vdth one hand 
 to grasp the plant keeping the stems quite close, 
 whilst with the other you draw the soil tightly around 
 it. A little extra pains will amply repay in the su- 
 perior quality of this delicious vegetable. The earth- 
 ing up should be continued at least every fortnight 
 that the stems may be thoroughly blanched, leaving 
 only the tops of the stalks above the surface.
