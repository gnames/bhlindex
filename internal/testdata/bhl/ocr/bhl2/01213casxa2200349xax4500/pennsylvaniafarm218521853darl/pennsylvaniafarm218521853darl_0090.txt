[June, 

The varieties mostly cultivated are Seymours' nevr 
 white, Seymour's champion (white,) the Matchless 
 red and the Manchester or Giant red ; the white are 
 mildest in flavor and the most saleable, but the red 
 are of easier culture and generally of larger growth. 

Brocoli, purple cape, and ichite cape. — Few who 
 have ever tasted of this delicious vegetable (which so 
 neai-ly approximates both in appearance andhabitto 
 the Cauliflower, and which is so much easier culti- 
 vated) but are desirous of adding it to their stock. 

The seed should be sown from the middle of May 
 to the first of June, and when large enough, trans- 
 plant similar to cabbage, manuring well, (the great 
 secret in growing good vegetables.) The purple cape 
 suits this climate the best. 

Sugar corn may be sown every 2 or 3 weeks for a 
 succession. Also, dwarf or bush beans, white, red, 
 and yellow turnip rooted radish — lettuce at intervals, 
 also cucumbers for pickling. Transplant this month, 
 drumhead, flat dutch and red dutch cabbage, also 
 drumhead and green curled savoys for fall and wint- 
 er use. Earth up peas, beans, potatoes, &c. Keep 
 all weeds out of the garden, as they are robbing your 
 crop of the very best of their food, independently of 
 their unsightly appearance. 

Beets. — Transplant them now from the seed bed 
 in rows of from twenty inches to two feet apart, and 
 about eighteen inches in the row. Let the soil be rich 
 and deeply dug if you would have fine beets. Water 
 after transplanting if the weather is dry, continuing 
 it until they begin to grow. 

Carrots, for the general crop'should now be sown. 
 Sow in drills half an inch deep, in rich light sandy 
 As soon as the plants are up thin them out to 

soil. 

This 

may 

a distance of three or four inches apart, 
 readily be done with a small hoe. 

Egg plants should be well attended to, regularly 
 hoed, and if continued dry weather prevails, an oc- 
 casional watering will do no harm. Those intended 
 for the late crop may be transplanted in moist weath- 
 er. Plant in rows two feet apart each way. Dwarf 
 beans may be planted between rows, 

Endive may be sown the latter part of this or the 
 beginning of the following month. Draw drills four 
 or five inches deep about twelve inches apart, and 
 sow the seeds therein. A little light rich earth suf- 
 ficient to cover the seed should then be sprinkled in 
 the drills. Water occasionally, and when two or three 
 inches high, thin them out to eight or ten inches 
 apart. The advantage of drilling them in this way 
 is, that the earthing up is more easily done and very 
 warm weather does not affect them so much. When 
 eight inches high prepare them for blanching by ga- 
 thering the leaves closely in the hand, (being careful 
 that no leaves or litter remain in the centre) and ty- 
 ing them up closely with a piece of cotton twist or 

ration if you would have your plants in fine condi- 
 tion. In about fifteen days they will be blanched fit 
 for use. 

Peas — Those grown for the succession should be 
 earthed up regularly, and as the earlier crops have 
 matured, the haulm or vines should be cleared away 
 and the ground prepared for late cabbage, &c. 

Peppers — Transplant this month. The soil must be 
 good. Set the plants 15 inches apart each way, and 
 as the season advances hoe them frequently and earth 
 up the stems. 

Badislies. Continue sowing a few from time to 
 time. They require but little culture and always form 
 a fine vegetable for the table. 

Salsafy — Keep down the weeds by hoeing regularly. 
 Spinach — As the season has been very backward. 
 Spinach which should have been sown in March and 
 April, may yet be put in. Select an open situation 
 well enriched. Hoe and cultivate well if large plants 
 are desired. Thin out the plants when too thick. — 
 When they have leaves two or three inches broad 
 the outer leaves may be gathered, the root and heart 
 being permitted to remain to shoot out again. 

In the Flower Garden tender plants may now safe- 
 ly be planted out, and such as have been unsuccess- 
 ful in raising their stock should fill up with annuals 
 ready grown which may be had at a small advance 
 on the original price of the seeds, at any of the Seed 
 Stores or Nurserymen. A list of varieties may per- 
 haps be of advantage in forming a collection, which 
 we give. Sweet Alyssum, German Asters, Phlox Drum- 
 mondii, Gaillardica picta, Eschscholzia Californica, 
 Crocea and Compacta, Bostonia aurea, Caccalia coc- 
 cinea, Nemophila insignis and Maculata, purple and 
 white ten week stocks. Lobelia gracilis and erinoi- 
 des, Schyzanthus retussus and Grahamii, purple, 
 white and scarlet Candytuft, Clarkia pulchella and 
 Neriflora, Clintonia pulchella. Mignonette, Pigmy 
 Dwf., French Marigold. Petunias varietes — Papaver 
 Marshallii, Phacelias varietes, and Climbers, such 
 as Thunbergia alata, Ipomea quamoclit or Crimson 
 Cypress vine. Maurandya Barclayana three varieties, 
 blue, pink, and white. Eccremo carpus scaber, Lo- 
 phospermum scandens and Hendersonii — most of the 
 above blooming till frost. Yours, 

Par-la-ville.

 The I>adies' Department at tlie State Fair. 

Mr. Editor : I was much pleased to observe at 

the State Fair at Harrisburg last fall, a very large 

number of articles on exhibition which were the 

products of the industry and skill of women. No 

department of the Exhibition attracted more general 

attention, and to me no other possessed half as much 

interest. While it may seem perfectly natural that 

matting. 

my tastes and inclinations should lead me to admire 
 A dry day must be selected for tliis ope- I the display of quilts, needle-work of various kinds.
