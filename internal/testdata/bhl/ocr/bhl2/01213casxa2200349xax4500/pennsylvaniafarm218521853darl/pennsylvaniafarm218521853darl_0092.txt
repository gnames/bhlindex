cient instruments of prehension. They seem to de- 
 stroy a great deal more than is required for the 
 necessary amount of aliment, and therefore in mov- 
 ing from place to place, they are no doubt as much 
 incommoded as we would be in walking through 
 high grass ; and accordingly in order to facilitate 
 locomotion, they with their teeth cut a smooth road 
 (as close to the thread of the cloth as if it had been 
 done with the sharpest razor) from time to time re- 
 posing themselves, and making fast their little cases 
 vrith small silken cables. When from the increased 
 size of the larvae the cases become too short, they 
 easily lengthen them by adding a piece to one or 
 both ends ; but to enlarge them in width does not 
 seem to be so simple a task. For this purpose they 
 make a straight cut about half way down each side of 
 the case, into which they put a piece formed of por- 
 tions of eroded wool, felted together and lined, after 
 which they proceed to enlarge the other end in the 
 same manner. This process may be demonstrated 
 by placing them, and leaving them remain for a 
 time undisturbed upon difierent colored cloths, when 
 they will present " coats of many colors." When full 
 grown, the larva of the clothes moths (Tinea) are 
 from a i to /^ of an inch in length ; white, naked, 
 and the head and pectoral legs a bright glossy brown. 
 The cases present a larger or smaller appearance ac- 
 cording as the material from which they are con- 
 structed is coarse or fine. After changing to a chry- 
 salis in April or May,* according to external circum- 
 stances, they remain in a quiescent state about three 
 weeks, when small nocturnal moths are evolved of a 
 silvery grayish color, about i of an inch in length, 
 more or less, according to species, sex, or incidentals, 
 having the eyes prominent; palpi much developed ; 
 antenniB moderate in length and (in the specimen 
 before me) simple: wings slightly convoluted. It is 
 in the winged state and after the impregnancy of 
 the females, that they lay the foundation of their col- 
 onies of future destruction ; and they are then so in- 
 significant and inconspicuous in size and appearance, 
 that it is with difficulty that we can believe they can 
 possibly be authors of so much mischief. I am not 
 fully advised as to the time or details in reference to 
 the disposition of their eggs, but having seen the 
 winged insect early in the spring and also in the after 
 part of summer I have been led to suppose there 
 may be at least two broods in a year ; the spring 
 brood being of course the most destructive from the 

* I have some of the larvie of the Tinea that I took from an old 
 â– woolen garment in the beginning of last October, and condned in 
 a box, putting in a piece of cloth for them to feed upon : one has 
 changed into a chrysulis, and^the others, (April lOtli,) are still feed- 
 ing : these have been kept all vifinter in a cold room. The perfect 
 moth or imago, before alluded to, evolved from the chrs'salis on 
 the 7th of April, it being confined in its winter operations in a 
 warm room, near where a stove pipe enters a flue. I have also 
 some larva; that I took from an old garment on the 9th of April : 
 one of these was feeding upon and had formed its case entirely out 
 of cotton material. This, 1 am convinced, from the circumstances 
 under which 1 found it, was a case of extreme necessity : the ani- 
 mal being so hemmed in, that there was no alternative but starva- 
 tion. 

fact that they are enabled during the summer to pur- 
 sue their work comparatively free from interruption. 
 Being twilight or nightflyors, they are attracted, with 
 hordes of other insects of like nocturnal habits, 
 around lighted lamps or candles burning in our 
 charabers, and wherever there is an aperture large 
 enough, they are sure to enter, where numbers of 
 them meet a common end by flitting around the flame 
 until they get their wings singed, and then fall help- 
 less into it, and thus perish. The females being soli- 
 citous for the preservation and perpetuation of their 
 species, instinctively seek a place to deposit their 
 eggs, furnishing the necessary aliment for their young 
 when hatched. The eggs are very small, and a 
 small portion of glutinous matter voided with each 
 one, by which they are cemented to the material upon 
 which they have been deposited; and moreover being 
 generally of a light color, they may easily elude our 
 closest scrutiny and be taken for only a little dust, or 
 not observed at all. In this way our woolens are 
 packed away in dark moist places, for the summer, 
 and in many instances receiving no attention until 
 too late, or none at all. These are the most favor- 
 able circumstances for the rapid development of the de- 
 structive energies of the insect ; namely, moisture, 
 darkness and uninterruption or quiet. Woolens should 
 therefore be thoroughly beaten up and examined mi- 
 nutely often during the summer, especially in the 
 months of August and September, and every offender 
 dislodged and destroyed ; for, as frequent combings and 
 applications after the eggs have once been deposited in 
 the hair of animals is the most effective mode of extermi- 
 nating the vermin that are sure to follow, with the 
 least injury, so, frequent searching, interruptions, 
 beating and airings are the best in cases where the 
 eggs of the moth have been deposited. But in airing, 
 care should be taken in not having them exposed too 
 late in the afternoon, or that no littlefemale moths be 
 carried in, in misplaced sympathy, and snugly stow- 
 ed away with the articles you are so solicitous of pre- 
 serving from their ravages. Experience has demon- 
 strated to me that in many instances the larvse of the 
 clothes moths are entirely overlooked by indignant 
 housekeepers in their anxiety to find the supposed 
 offender, which of course they imagine must be some- 
 thing more formidable in appearance than the little 
 creature we are just describing, and woe betide the 
 hapless intruder of any other tribe, however innocent 
 he may be. If he makes an attempt at escape, 
 all is charged to him ; and the real offenders merely 
 shaken off as excrement or tufts of gnawed wool 
 or hair, and left to wend their way back again if 
 possible, or to find some new field to continue their 
 labors. To such it may be beneficial to know that 
 the clothes moths in their larvae state never make an 
 atempt to escape, they are not organized for any ac- 
 tive locomotive movement. The only activity notices-
