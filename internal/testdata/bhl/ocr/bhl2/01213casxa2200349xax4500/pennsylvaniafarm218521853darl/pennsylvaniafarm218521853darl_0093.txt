ble is the sudden drawing in of the head ; and clos- 
 ing the end of the case when interrupted, which they 
 effect by collapsing them. Indeed, it is not a matter 
 of surprise that they should thus elude the notice of 
 a common observer, for some how, being sensible of 
 the proximity of an enemy, they continue thus shut 
 up for some minutes, when if you continue your ob- 
 servation, you will see them cautiously protrude their 
 heads, but suddenly draw them in again, (like boys 
 playing "hide and go seek,") on feeling the agitation 
 of the air only, caused by your breathing too near 
 them. 

There is another species, not so common in our 
 houses as the former, that attack the linings of car- 
 riages and other woolen goods, that are in an unpro- 
 tected state. These do not construct a moveable case 
 as the former do, but eating their way into the cloth 
 they form themselves galleries lined with silk, in 
 which they reside and undergo their transtormation: 
 — and yet another species, that is very partial to furs, 
 and ladies have often to deplore the ravages commit- 
 ted upon their muffs, tippets, capes, &c. It is said 
 . that this species, if hard pressed, wiil even eat wool 
 or horse hair, and form its moveable habitation of 
 such materials. 

As tobacco in its concentrated or manufactured 
 form is obnoxious to insects generally, it is recom- 
 mended by some that woolen goods when packed 
 away, should be plentifully seasoned with strong 
 snuff or chewing tobacco. Camphor is also recom- 
 mended, but I know from experience that camphor 
 has little or no effect in preserving my insects from 
 the cabinet moth. I have, therefore, more confidence 
 in tobacco. 

" It is said that moths never attack unwashed wool 
 — that is, wool as it comes from the sheep's back, be- 
 fore any cleansing process has been applied to de- 
 prive it of its natural oil or smell. It is therefore 
 recommended to be placed in layers between clothes 
 or blankets, or kept in small parcels in drawers 
 where they are kept." (Maun. Trs. His. 434.) This 
 latter remedy I have never tested, and, therefore, 
 cannot speak of it advisably ; it is however simple 
 and worthy of a trial. 

Even with these remedies, woolen goods should be 
 kept perfectly dry, and frequently aired and exam- 
 ined,and all the small follicles or cases containing the 
 larvae of moths carefully collected and destroyed ; in 
 this way an " ounce of prevention is worth a pound 
 of cure." 

I have thus given the information commensurate 
 with my limited knowledge of the branch of Ento- 
 mology to which the insect in question belongs ; a 
 branch replete with interest and usefulness ; but in 
 consequence of the fragile character of the insects 
 that belong to it, and the difficulty of their preserva- 
 tion, one that has not heretofore enlisted as much of 

my interest as some others. Under any circumstances 
 I would rather the task had been assigned to abler 
 hands, noram I sure thatfurtherinvestigation will con- 
 firm all I have said ; as I am certain that much remains 
 to be developed. If however this communication canbe 
 of any benefit to the readers of the Farm Journal, or 
 elicit the least inquiry or investigation on the subject 
 discussed, I may still have the assurance of knowing 
 that I have in a very humble degree performed a 
 service. S. S. R.

 A place for everything. 

To TUE Editor of the Farm Journal. — Some thir- 
 ty-five years ago, I purchased for my own use some 
 tools, which were occasionally used by my young 
 men, but through whose want of care, they were of- 
 ten mislaid and sometimes lost. 

Being much annoyed by it, I adopted the plan of 
 marking out the shape of each tool ; and thus attain- 
 ed an object ; for which I had been long striving, viz: 
 inducing others to return things to their places, with- 
 out being much looked after. Many years passed by 
 before I thought of extending it further ; but as 7ie- 
 cessity still leads to invention, I found the same prin- 
 ciple, (that of " association,") could be variously ap- 
 plied, and with equal success. 

For some years my garden tools have been thus 
 arranged. In my stable, forks, shovels, brooms, dust 
 brushes, curry combs, &c., are so provided ; and even 
 my riding bridles have their precise places marked 
 out, with the shape of the bit, &c. 

The utensils used in the kitchen, that are hung up, 
 are symmetrically arranged upon that plan ; and al- 
 though the cook has never been desired to keep them 
 in their places, yet they are never found out of place 
 except when in use. 

The same principle is applied in our store in vari- 
 ous ways, and with satisfactory results. Each coun- 
 ter has its color, nominally, viz : green, blue, black, 
 brown, red, &c.; our brushes and yard sticks, the 
 shape of which could not be marked out for want of 
 space, ai'e painted to correspond with these colors. — 
 An opening in the riglit hand end of each counter, is 
 the place for the dust brushes ; and a convenient 
 place provided for the yard sticks. The color being 
 conspicuous, has the desired effect, and leads to great 
 regularity, and lessens the care of the principal in 
 this respect almost entirely. 

Scraps are prevented from collecting upon the floor, 
 by having scrap bags convenient, behind each coun- 
 ter; and there are other arrangements upon the same 
 principle, which promote good habits and increase 
 the usefulness of those about us, which can bo better 
 understood if seen. 

There is a virtue in it, which cannot be appreciated 
 till it is tried ; for it not only induces the employer 
 himself to be more careful, but leads to regularity on
