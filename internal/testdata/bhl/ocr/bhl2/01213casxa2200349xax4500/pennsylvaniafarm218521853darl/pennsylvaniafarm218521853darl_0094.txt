the part of others ; which is often of vital importance 
 to success in any kind of business. Habits of care- 
 fulness should be formed in early life. 

If a tool is lent, the borrower is aware, that there 
 is a tell tale in its place ; and if he fail to return it 
 in season, it ceases not to admonish, till the missing 
 article is restored. Thus many things are promptly 
 returned, and in good order, that for want of it, are 
 left about and abused ; the owner subjected to incon- 
 venience, and for Avant of seasonable attention they 
 are perhaps forgotten or lost. Besides, articles thus 
 cared for, are found to be much more durable, than 
 when left to chance. Respectfully thy friend,

Order— Carefulness. 

If we properly considered our true interest, and in- 
 deed our own convenience, we should be led to see 
 the importance of the moral influence resulting from 
 habits of order. 

Even children perceive the beauty and advantages 
 of care and neatness ; and almost instinctively acquire 
 the practice, from the example of those with whom 
 they are associated. 

Some persons plead, that they have no turn for 
 such things, and therefore they are excusable for their 
 neglect. But this is a mistake. The real difficulty 
 arises from a feeling of which some are scarcely con- 
 scious ; and which few are frank enough to acknowl- 
 edge. Is it not to save ourselves a little trouble? Is 
 it not self-indulgence? To be plain — is it not indo- 
 lence? And does not the indulgence of this feeling 
 cause more of our troubles and difficulties than many 
 are aware of? 

For example, — If we have unnecessarily neglected 
 a duty, or have left an article out of place, which 
 might as well have been roturned at the time ; if we 
 have done a thing indifferently which ought to have 
 been done well — or if we have failed to accomplish 
 an object for want of due exertion; — What is the rea- 
 son? Let us be honest and examine fairly. Is it not 
 that we have given way to the feeling spoken of? — 
 And do we not find that this feeling gains strength by 
 indulgence? But how are we to get rid of it? The 
 reply is, we must contend against it, and show it no 
 quarter; and little by little we will gain the mastery. 
 Early life is the best time to eradicate it; but it will 
 yield to proper efforts at all ages. 

You ask, — how is this to be effected ? The answer 
 is, by learning to love labour. But to do this, you 
 must study to make every kind of business a pleasure. 
 To a great extent this can be done. For by careful- 
 ly digesting, and then adopting, the most simple and 
 systematic mode of performing every duty, greater 
 precision and success will be attained; and being 
 simplified and made easy, the performance will be- 
 come a pleasure. For no position is more true than 
 this : Whatever ive feel ive do well, we take pleasure in 
 doing: and is not the converse equally so? Whatev- 
 er we feel is not well done, affords us no satisfaction. 
 If, therefore, we learn to do everything well, will not 
 the doing of every thing then be a pleasure? Does 
 not this correspond with our own experience? 

Difficulties will frequently occur, but these must 
 not dishearten us, as nothing valuake can be accom- 
 plished without effort; and for our encouragement we 
 should always bear in mind that there is a way of 

doing everything, and if one method fails, we must 
 try another. 

The principles of order and neatness are so simple 
 and so plain, that it needs but a moderate attention 
 to understand them; and but reasonable effort to put 
 them into practice: but that effort must be continued 
 and persevered in, until we succeed. For step by 
 step we shall gain on our deficiencies; and the con- 
 sciousness of some progress will encourage further 
 exertion. We should never forget that to Ijecome fit- 
 ted to train others, it is especially needful we should 
 first discipline ourselves. 

An eminent and successful agriculturist when asked 
 what made a good farmer, replied, "To mind little 
 things." When we visit a neighbor who is remark- 
 able for good management, we are struck with the pe- 
 culiar effect and beauty of his arrangements; although 
 perhaps at first we can hardly tell why. But when 
 we come to analyze, we discover it is the result of at- 
 tention to "little things ;" providing places for things 
 and keeping them in their places. 

If, when we enter a house, we see scraps of paper, 
 rags and pieces of thread scattered over the floor — if 
 the dress of the housewife has been thrown upon her 
 wiihout care, and perhaps soiled and torn: if her 
 children are disorderly, uncombed and uncleanly, 
 does it not affect us unpleasantly? and accustomed to 
 better management, do we not turn from it with dis- 
 gust? Are we at any loss to determine that indo- 
 lence is the cause of all this? Can we doubt that if 
 the housewife had properly attended to "little things," 
 — was an early riser and made the best of her time — 
 that her room, her dress and her children, would have 
 been entirely the reverse, and instead of an offensive, 
 would have presented an inviting appearance ? For 
 what is more becoming than a neatly dressed woman? 
 or more delightfully interesting than a family of clean 
 and orderly children? The mere circumstance of a 
 small bag being hung up in each room, and the scraps 
 regularly deposited there, will promote habits of care 
 and cleanliness, beyond what could have been antici- 
 pated. This may seem a small matter, but it is the 
 beginning of order ; and if strictly followed up, its in- 
 fluence will be felt throughout the whole family. 

But may not the same principles be applied else- 
 where? Is there nothing to be done on the outside of 
 the house? Let us examine — how is it with the fences 
 and the hedges, and the appearance of the dwelling? 
 Are they all snug? Have you a supply of choice 
 fruit trees convenient, and of such grape vines as will 
 stand the winter, and are they kept well trimmed? 
 Have you a wood-house ? Is it well supplied with 
 fuel and neatlj arranged? How is it wit a the gar- 
 den and the front yard — and the lane — and the barn 
 yard, and the barn? Are they in good condition? 
 Have you scrap bags there? or in other words have 
 you suitable places for unsightly things — for such 
 things as cause disorder, and litter your premises; 
 and serve as examples of mismanagement and wuste 
 to those about you? If you have not, why is it ? how 
 can you expect them to be careful when you are care- 
 less ; to be industrious when you are slothful; and to 
 be saving when you are wasteful? If you permit this 
 state of things, do you not encourage it? and is it not 
 really teaching them the reverse of what your inter- 
 est requires? Do you not see it? If you do, then 
 rouse up to your duty and set a better example for the 
 future. For do you not remember that whenever you 
 have done so, how pleasant has been the result? Shall 
 the example of a wise Providence be lost upon us, 
 and shall we not be improved by what was intended 
 for our instruction as well as our benefit? Observe 
 the operations of nature ! How beautiful ! How ad-
