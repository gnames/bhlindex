intendent of some of these districts assigns what he 
 believes to be its physical cause. Almost every where, 
 both in this country and Europe, it is believed that 
 the moon exerts a decided influence on the phenome- 
 na of veo-etation. Miatanari has attempted also to 
 assign the cause of this supposed effect. Dr. Mead 
 was a believer in the influence of the sun and moon 
 on the human body, and published a book to this 
 purpose, entiled " De Imperio Solis ac Lunae in Cor- 
 pore huniano." 

In the pursuits of agriculture there are often found 
 effects, the causes of which are unknown. How many 
 wild theories have been a Ivanced to explain what, 
 to human intellect, is inexplicable in regard to the 
 germination of seed, the ' growth of plants and the 
 thousand phenomena which our farms continually 
 present to our observation. Tacts are not the less 
 true because we are ignorant of some preceding fact 
 which we would call a cause. 

I am far from joining those who allow the moon 
 to govern their farming operations, but neither would 
 I altogether reject, in the present state of our knowl- 
 edge, or rather ignorance of the subject, the settled 
 and almost universal belief of those who have had the 
 best opportunities for observation and are much in- 
 terested in correct practice. I have endeavored to 
 bring the matter to the test of experiment, but have 
 found the results utterly inconclusive. It cannot, I 
 apprehend, be satisfactorily denied, except by some 
 one whose attention is more fully devoted to the sub- 
 ject, than is possible to one absorbed by the diverse 
 engagements which every day brings with it. Some 
 public institution might cause a series of experiments 
 and observations to be made which would determine 
 the question. Years of time and thousands of tests 
 would be necessary. The resolution of this single 
 question would be an ample return for the endowment 
 of an Agricultural College. If it be a popular falla- 
 cy, much would be saved by knowing it. If it be a 
 truth, much would be gained by knowing it. And 
 as no man's mere opinion, however respectable — as 
 BO theory, howeverplausible, can decide it, I respect- 
 fully submit that it may still be considered an im- 
 portant, practicable question, and which there is no 
 great doubt, can be settled and ought to be, 
 by some competent authority.

For the Farm Journal. 
 On the Preservation of Manure. 

Mr. Editor : — In the December number of the 
 Journal, I submitted to your readers some remarks 
 on the subject of deep plowing, with the necessity of 
 increasing the fertility of our soil, and, for that pur- 
 pose of economizing manures. When a farmer is 
 duly impressed with the importance of augmenting 
 his manure heaps, and has turned his attention to 

every available means, he will naturally be led to in- 
 quire how he may best manage them, so as to derive 
 from his accumulations the greatest amount of bene- 
 fit. 

The principal source of supply in our practice, is 
 the contribution of our stables and barnyards and 
 consists of the produce of the farm, which has been 
 consumed by the cattle or thrown out as the offal 
 of the various crops. It is, in short, the organic 
 matter yielded by the soil and modified by consump- 
 tion in the support of animal life, and contains all 
 that is necessary to the gro\^th of plants. To pre- 
 pare this mass, which has in part been used for the 
 food of animals, to serve still further for the food and 
 nourishment of vegetation, (thus completing the cir- 
 cle established by creative power,) requires that 
 change which is brought about by decomposition, and 
 is chiefly effected by the agency of moisture and heat, 
 But the admission of these agents, which are abund- 
 antly supplied by the elements, is attended with the 
 danger of loss by waste from evaporation and leakage, 
 moisture producing fluids, and heat gases, and both 
 indeed, uniting in each operation. The great object 
 is to obtain the change without the consequent loss; 
 and I propose to inquire how that may be done. 

It is a common mistake to convert the cattle stall 
 or stable into a laboratory of manure. Pure air, is 
 essential to the healthy condition of any animal. — 
 By allowing manure to accumulate and remain, the 
 atmosphere is filled with the innumerable, invisible 
 particles of ammonia,nitrogen and other gases, which 
 are extremely unwholesome to breathe, and injurious 
 to the health of cattle. On the importance of ven- 
 tilation and cleanliness for the preservation of the 
 health of domestic animals, I cannot do better than 
 refer to the valuable essay, published in the first 
 number of this Journal, p. 10. "Filth and moisture 
 conjoined with heat," says the able writer, "are the 
 greatest enemies of health," It is plain, that stables 
 cannot be kept too cleanly and sweet. The sooner 
 all filth is removed, the better. There should be a 
 drain to carry off from every stall whatever will fl )W 
 as a liquid. It should pass out of that apartment. 
 But to suffer it to run entirely away and be lost, is 
 poor husbandry. It should be arrested as soon after 
 leaving the stable, as practicable. A manure or com- 
 post heap, should be formed near the stable or cattle 
 shed, where the farmer should accumulate his stock 
 of manure. To this heap, all the drainage of the 
 stable, barnyard and outhouses should be conducted; 
 which Avill supply the requisite moisture, while suf- 
 ficient heat, even in a low temperature of the atmos- 
 phere, will arise from the fermentation. 

In order to lead the various liquids to this deposit, 
 the surface should descend towards it, and to confine 
 them to the mass of which they are to constitute a 
 part, a mound or wall should be raised on the lower 
 side, which as well as the bottom should be puddled
