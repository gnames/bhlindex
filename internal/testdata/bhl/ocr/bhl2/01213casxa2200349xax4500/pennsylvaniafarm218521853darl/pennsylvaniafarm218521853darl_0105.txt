foulness, not to the extent and clearness of the water. 
 A y.ard of margin is worth a mile of deep stream ; 
 one muddy Norfolk broad, with its oozy banks, laby- 
 rinthine creeks, and its forests of rushes, reeds and 
 sedges, is better in this respect, than all "the blue 
 rushing of the arrowy Rhone," or the whole azure 
 expanse of the brilliant Lake of Geneva. — Or. Foul.

500 AGENTS WANTED. 

"We are desirous of securing one or more competent 
 agents in every county in Pennsylvania, to canvass 
 for the Farm Journal. Our terms are liberal, and 
 we are assured by well-informed friends in every por 
 tion of the State, that competent and active agents 
 could not fail to succeed well. "We therefore invite 
 persons desirous of taking agencies to address us 
 [postpaid) on the subject; furnishing us with satis- 
 factory reference, and stating in what particular 
 county they are desirous of canvassing. 

The Farm Journal as a Premium. 

The warm interest manifested by a number of our 

County Agricultural Societies in behalf of the welfare 

of the Farm Journal, places us under heavy obligations. 

Lastyear the Bucks County Society placed the Jour- 1 I^ams, upon which important improvements have 

nal on their premium list (instead of the dollar usu- recently been made. See his advertisement. 

PrepaTations for the Fair. 

Our farmers, mechanics, ladies, &c., are making 
 active preparations for the coming Annual Exhibition. 
 We are glad to sec this, and hope the feeling in this 
 respect will grow stronger from day to day. At the 
 lastmeetingof the the Lancaster County Agricultural 
 Society, committees were appointed to co-operate 
 with the Executive committee of the State Society, 
 and so soon as the site of the Exhibition ground is 
 determined upon, (which will be in a few days) ar- 
 rangements for the erection of the fencing, shedding, 
 &c., will at once be made. A spirited address pre- 
 pared by a committee of the Society, to farmers and 
 others, has been published and will we trust have the 
 desired effect. 

In the name of the Society, we cordially invite per- 
 sons in every department of business to contribute 
 something towards the Exhibition. Not only do we 
 expect our farmers to go to work energetically, but 
 our mechanics also. The ladies, we are assured, 
 will do their part. 

Ackowledgments. — We are indebted to Mr. Thos. 
 Croft, Seedsman, 309, Market street, Philadelphia, for 
 several packages of seeds, and other favors. We 
 most cheerfully commend Mr. C. and his establish- 
 ment to the notice of those who are desirous of pur- 
 chasing " warranted fresh seeds," and any other ar- 
 ticles usually found in Agricultural Stores. 

Mr. Brown of 309, Market st., Philadelphia, has 
 laid us under obligations for a small sized Iron Force 
 Pump, which for gardening as well as household pur- 
 poses we haA'e found most excellent and useful. With 
 a small piece of hose attached one person can throw 
 water with it a distance of sixty feet. Mr. B. is also 
 the manufacturer of Gatchell's Patent Hydraulic 

ally given) and this year, have done so again. The 
 Mifflin County Society, as will be seen by the reso- 
 lution below, have followed the good example : 

3d. Resolved, TJiat the Executive Committee he 
 instructed to substitute the Fennsylvania Farm Jour- 
 nal in lieu of the dollar, and in part payment of 
 larger premiums in all cases where the recipient is a 
 Jarmer and not already a subscriber to the Journal, 
 and to such other persons as may be willing to receive 
 it. 

We beg leave respectfully to suggest to those So- 
 cieties whose premium lists are not already made 
 out, to adopt the same system. A volume of the 
 Journal, received as a premium, would, wc think, bo 
 more highly prized than the mere amount of the 
 subscription price — the dollar ; as the recipient would 
 be more likely to preserve it, than the money. If 
 every Society in the State would adopt the plan, it 
 would greatly strengthen our hands, and dissemi- 
 nate the valuable truths from time to time presented 
 in the Journal more widely. IIow many more So- 
 cieties will do it ? 

The Commissioner of Patents has favored us with 
 a package of garden and field seeds, many of which 
 are now growing finely. 

Uncolnshire Figs. Mr. C. Ilaldcman of Bainbridgc, 
 Lancaster co., will aecept our thanks for a pair of 
 fine Lincolnshire Pigs. The Editor of "the Plow," 
 in speaking of this breed says, "they are the largest 
 improved breed we know. They are of a pure white 
 color, very thrifty, and tolerable fine points. They 
 cross well either with the Suffolk or Berkshire, in- 
 creasing the size of the latter without detracting 
 much from their fine points. They can be fatted at 
 any age, though best after a year old." ]Mr. Ilaldc- 
 man has a few pairs for sale which he will dispose 
 of at reasonable rates. 

B@"W. Canby, of AVilmington, Del., will accept 
 our thanks for a copy of the Address delivered be- 
 fore the Delaware Horticultural Society by G. Em- 
 erson, M. D. We have read it with interest and 
 profit.
