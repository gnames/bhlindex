the fence corners, to poison the atmosphere and 
 strengthen the growth of other equally noxious 
 plants. Thousands upon thousands of dollars worth 
 of valuable fertilizing materials, are annually lost to 
 the farmers of Pennsylvania, by a want of care in 
 this direction. We had intended, as promised in our 
 last, to continue the subject of manures ; but as one 
 of our correspondents has taken hold of it, we give 
 way to him with pleasure. 

Improved Fowls. — Never perhaps has the " hen 
 fever" prevailed to as great an extent in Pennsylva- 
 nia, as at this time. AV"e are literally crowded with 
 inquiries from every section of the State. Many 
 friends in the various counties have requested us to 
 purchase for them. This we have done, although for 
 some time past, good, pure stock has been scarce and 
 high. In a former number of the Journal we refen*ed 
 our readers to several dealers and breeders in Phila- 
 delphia and elsewhere. Amongst these were Mr. P. 
 Hunt, of West Philadelphia, from whom we have 
 purchased several pairs of Cochin China fowls, which 
 for size and proportion, as well as for other excellent 
 qualities, we think fully equal to any we have ever 
 seen, and are assured that they may be relied upon 
 as pure descendants of imported stock. 

Messrs. Gould and Arnold of Lancaster City, have 
 on hand at the present time, a number of very supe- 
 rior Shanghaes. Their stock they assure us, are 
 lineal decendents from recent importations, and are 
 truly noble fowls. We have placed one of them in 
 our yard and have no hesitancy in recommending 
 them to the attention of those whodesire to purchase. 
 Messrs. G. & A. are ready to fill orders at a few days 
 notice, and will guarantee satisfaction to buyers. 

If any of our friends desire further information, or 
 wish us to make purchases for them, we will cheer- 
 fullv do so. 

FmriT, Grain, &c. — We are pleased to learn from 
 our exchanges, that the anticipations of a failure ol 
 the fruit crop will not be realized in Pennsylvania. — 
 From every section of the State apples, pears, cher- 
 ries, plums, apricots, &c. promise abundance. In 
 some localities, the peach crop will be a total failure, 
 in others there will be a tolerable yield, and in some 
 places an average crop. The peach trees generally, 
 however, have suffered. Much of the young wood 
 has been destroyed, and it will require a season or 
 two for them to recover from the effects of the severe 
 cold of last winter. 

The Grain Crop. — From present appearances the 
 coming harvest will not be as abundant as the last. 
 Some of our farmers anticipate an average yield, 
 while others not more than half a crop. 

Corn. — The corn never looked better in Lancaster 
 county. The young plants are vigorous and thrifty, 
 and their color fine. 

Potatoes. — Immense quantities of potatoes have 
 been planted this season. The high price which this 
 esculent has for months past commanded has led to 
 this. Potatoes of a good quality cannot now be had 
 for less than from §1,25 to $1,50 per bushel. We 
 have never seen the potatoe crop more promising 
 than at this time. If the season continues favorable, 
 Pennsylvania will be able to supply two or three of 
 her sister States next year. 

Write ! Write ! ! Write ! ! ! — We want informa- 
 tion upon all subjects pertaining to agriculture. — 
 Farmers, those of you who have not been in the 
 habit of writing for publication, do not let the mere 
 idea frighten you. Try it once and perhaps you will 
 be encouraged to try it again. Write ! if you can 
 manage to pen but a dozen lines. The next trial will 
 be easier. Write in your own language, and do not 
 feel that it will be too plain to be understood. The 
 plainer, the better. We are laboring for the great 
 mass of working men, as well as for the scientific and 
 learned — our desire is to present truth however sim- 
 ply attired, and therefore desire the results of your 
 practical experience. Sit down and try it 

SunscRiPTioxs TO THE New Volume. — We would 
 be ungrateful indeed, were we not to acknowledge 
 our indebtedness to a great many kind friends, for 
 their efforts in behalf of the journal. Thus far but 
 seventy of our old subscribers have fallen off; while 
 our list of new subscribers has been largely increased. 
 But large as have been the additions to our list, we 
 would be pleased to have more ! Will not our friends 
 continue their exertions? We hope thoy will ? 

Foreign Quarterly Revieios. The Edinhtirg, West- 
 minister and North Jiritish Reviews have been receiv- 
 ed. Messrs. Leonard Scott & Co. are entitled to thanks 
 of every lover of sound literature for the prompt, 
 handsome and cheap manner in which they get up 
 these able reprints. They are always welcome 
 visitors to our table, and should lie to every one who 
 values delightful intellectual excitement. The wliole 
 four of the Quarterlies, with Blackwood, may l)e had 
 of the publishers for l?10. Address Leonard Scott 
 & Co., 7U, Fulton street, New York. 

Saxton's Rural Hand Hooks. The Hive and the 
 Honey Bee, The Hog, The Poultry Yard, and the 
 Horse, are the titles of four neat little volumes, just 
 issued from the press of ('. M. Saxton, New York. — 
 These l)ooks are just what they profess to be — hand 
 books of reference. They are adapted to all classes, 
 are convenient in size, and so cheap that the price of 
 the whole is really not more than the value of any 
 single one of the series. Price 25 cents each, or §1 
 for the four. They can be sent by mail. 

Model Architect, Xo. 11, sustains fully the high re- 
 putation of the preceeding Nos. Wo hope to be able 
 in our next to present one of the beautiful designs 
 contained in the Arcluteet, by which our readers will 
 be enabled to form an idea of the character of the 
 work generally. E. S. Jones & Co., Philadelphia.
