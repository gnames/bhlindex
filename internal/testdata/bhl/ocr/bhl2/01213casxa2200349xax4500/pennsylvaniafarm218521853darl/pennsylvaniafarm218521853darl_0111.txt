Harmony of Science and Practice in Agriculture. 

In retrospecting events in the history of agricul- 
 ture in the United States, we have a striking exem- 
 plification of the vast influence which the example of 
 ft fe V enterprising, public spirited individuals in a 
 State or county may exert. In agriculture, as in 
 every other human pursuit, the majority always de- 
 pend upon the few for the correct principles upon 

, Nrhich its chief operations are founded, and for an 
 explanation of the manner in which its various pro- 
 cesses are to be altered to suit the peculiar difference 
 nf soil, climate, &c. It is to these men that agricul- 
 •e owes its present improved condition, and it is 
 to them, or to spirits like theirs, that we are to hope 
 for still greater progress in future. They lead the 
 way by making the earliest experiments, running the 
 risk of success, and when successful, by establishing 

1 their improvements for the benefit of their fellow 
 men. Not unfrequently their costly experiments are 
 met with sneers and ridicule, particularly when they 
 prove failures. But when success attends their ef- 
 forts, the mass are eager and willing to avail them- 

i selves of the knowledge these pioneers have acquired, 
 and adopt the experiments, the value of which their 
 science and patience have tested. 

When (as is sometimes the case) scientific men 
 have failed in their efforts to improve the condition 
 of agriculture, (a result arising more perhaps from 
 a want of practical business habits, than from error 
 in their theories,) science has been compelled to bear 
 all the blame, while mere practical farming is ex- 
 tolled to the skies. But a candid answer to the in- 
 quiry, " What has science done, or what is it capable 
 of doing for husbandry ?" would serve to place these 
 master-spirits in a proper position, and teach those 
 who contemptuously deride the men who are labor- 
 ing with and for them, that notwithstanding the 

VOL IID . 

vaunted boastings of the practical thousands, all their 
 skill and knowledge can be traced to the researches 
 of the scientific few. We have before alluded to 
 this subject, and do so again, because we conceive it 
 to be one of vast importance to all. If the views 
 of those who put no faith in book farming are 
 to prevail — if we are to say to agriculture, "here thy 
 further progress shall be staid " — if new improve- 
 ments are to be eschewed, and men who are willing 
 to devote their scientific attainments and skill to the 
 promotion of the farmer's interest driven from the 
 field, it is very apparent that even the present condi- 
 tion of agriculture cannot be maintained. 

But why should science and practice become an- 
 tagonists ? Are not their objects identical, and are 
 they not vitally essentially to each other ? If science 
 is needed to point out the way, practice is just as es- 
 sential to carry into effect her beneficial teachings. 
 But singular as to the intelligent and reflecting mind 
 this disposition to sever pursuits (or branches of the 
 same pursuit,) which should be united may appear, 
 a satisfactory reason can be assigned for it. Those 
 who have most bitterly opposed the advancement of 
 scientific agriculture, are they who least understand 
 the true money value of it to the farming interest gen- 
 erally. 

Reduce scientific theories and principles to the 
 standard of mere dollars and cents — demonstrate to 
 a certainty their truthfulness and sure profit, when 
 practically applied — convince the skeptical husband- 
 man that every operation of the farmer ; however tri- 
 fling, is the result of applied science — teach him that 
 the construction of the mould board and almost eve- 
 ry other implement in common, daily use, involves the 
 highest mathematical principles — satisfy him of the 
 fact that without the aid of scientific research and in- 
 vestigation, tilling of the soil would never have ad- 
 vanced a single step beyond its primitive condition, 
 and finally, prove that his pocket is never so safely 
 protected as whe» guarded by a head well stored with 
 a knowledge of the broad basis upon which his pro- 
 fession rests, and his opposition will vanish like a
