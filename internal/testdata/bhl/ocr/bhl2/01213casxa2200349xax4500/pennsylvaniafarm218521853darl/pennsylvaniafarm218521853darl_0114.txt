Mr. Editor. — Modicus in your journal for May, 
 after remarking -with great apparent self complacen- 
 cy, on my reply to David Taggart — not Franklin, as 
 he erroneously supposes — triumphantly asks me for 
 one proof by experiment. I do not exactly under- 
 stand what he means by "proof," whether he expects 
 me to come to Philadelphia, and prove my theory be- 
 fore his eyes, or whether he merely wishes me to tell 
 him the result of some of my repeated experiments. 
 Judging from the tone of his May article, he will hard- 
 ly consider my assertion proof. So I will propound 
 certain experiments, which he may make himself, and 
 let the result, be the proof, which he demands. First 
 though, I would ask the medical gentleman, how he 
 separates the influence, horn, the light of the moon? — 
 Is not light the vehicle of all solar influence, or per- 
 haps the subtle agent that holds these influences in 
 solution? Does not the light of the sun give a sensa- 
 tion of h'^at, either by a direct affusion of caloric, or 
 by enkindling the gaseous particles of the atmosphere, 
 or elaborating the chemical exhalations of the deep 
 earih? (Can Medicus decide?) 

Who then ever dreamed of separating the more sub- 
 tle influences of Luna from her borrowed light? In 
 the face of all the "demonstrations which have been 
 made by the medical faculty," I must still aver that 
 the moon does exert an obvious influence, on some 
 diseases, corporeal and mental. I have known instan- 
 ces to ) marked to admit of question. One, a man 
 not insane, but invariably afflicted during the last 
 quarter of the moon, with unreasonable melancholy 
 and apprehensions of evil; even to such extent, that 
 he deemed his best friends, blood thirsty seekers of 
 his 1 fe. His poor tormented wife, was in the habit 
 of saymg to such persons as inquired concerning him, 
 "Oh he has got one of his monthly turns." I can pro- 
 cure for Medicus afiidavit of this case — but the poor 
 man went long since to that shore, 

" Where moons shall wax, and wane no more." 

I knew a young lady of deranged intellect, who al- 
 vrays laboured under deep despondency during "the 
 last quarter" and who once cut her throat (not fatally 
 Mr. Medicus,) once climbed into a well, and once 
 swallowed a large quantity of needles and pins, be- 
 side several other similar feats, which she performed 
 regularly in the "dark of the moon." Now do not 
 elucidate the subject by affiirming that She chose that 
 time, for the benefit of the ohscuritij, for she cut her 
 throat, jumped into the well, &c., in broad day-light. 
 I can substantiate this case also. Again I can name 
 some persons of deranged minds, and monomaniacs, 
 who were worse at certain seasons of the moon^some 
 at the change, and some at the full. I repeat, that 
 many chronic diseases also was and wane with the 
 moon. Every "old woman" knows, if Medicus does 

not, that Nature has certain periods, rounded by a 
 circuit of about twenty nine days, and regularly 
 recurring, in millions of subjects. Now Nature has 
 no index to count by weeks — no visible dividend of 
 the time into these periods, excepting this same moon. 
 If Medicus says these periods, if dependant on the 
 moon, would recur at the same time, in all subjects 
 — I reply: if life in all sulyects commenced at the 
 same time, or if these periods in all subjects com- 
 menced at the same phase, no doubt the recurrence, 
 if nature were undisturbed, would be simultaneous. 

Will Medicus condescend to read the following ex- 
 tract from an article by Prof. J. M. Comings, pub- 
 lished in August 1851, in the American Journal of 
 Medical Reform, issued at New York. 

"It is now," says the Prof, "an established fact, 
 that epilepsy, some forms of insanity and asthma, re- 
 cur at intervals regulated by the moon ; so of various 
 nervous complaints. In one of the annual reports of 
 our State Lunatic Asylum, there is a table of fifty 
 cases of periodical excitements, and their relations to 
 the moon. This is not doubted, and when we reflect 
 that the atmosphere is more or less under the direct 
 agency of the moon, it will not be wondered at, that 
 atmospheric changes have so much influence on the 
 sick. It is now generally admitted, that diurnal and 
 seasonable atmospheric variations in the barometer, 
 thermometer, electrometer, and hygrometer, are dis- 
 tinguished by ph^^siological and pathological changes 
 and most of our scientific men believe that the moon's 
 phases and positions are coincident with atmospheric 
 changes. We can reasonably infer then that the 
 moon has an influence on vital actions." 

What becomes now of the "clear investigation and 
 actual experiment," of which Medicus boasts so con- 
 fidently? He asserts that all idea of "sol-lunar influ- 
 ence in the production of insanity has long since van- 
 ished before the light of modern science, and medical j 
 investigation." What a wide mistake! In this, as 
 in many other instances, "modern science" bears 
 about the same relation to Truth, that atheism does ' 
 God, and the proud sneers of the one against the ob- 
 ject of its enmity, equally with the supercilious ridi* 
 cule of the other, will perish in contempt, while the 
 great Principles, which they have impotently assail- j 
 ed, remain glorious and unimpaired forever. 

It would appear that Medicus, in common with his 
 kindred blasphemers of the moon, do not know that 
 the divine doctrine of Astrology, including the nodic 
 and zodiacic influence of the moon, in conjunction 
 with the planets, is a veritable science, and not a 
 phantom of darkness, and offspring of superstitious 
 ignorance. That the signs of the Zodiac, with the , 
 with the conjunction of the moon and planets, were 
 not arbitrarily established, and nature then required 
 to accommodate herself to their influences — but that 
 the ancient astrologers who devoted their lives to the 
 subject, bequeathing their uncompleted conclusions ,
