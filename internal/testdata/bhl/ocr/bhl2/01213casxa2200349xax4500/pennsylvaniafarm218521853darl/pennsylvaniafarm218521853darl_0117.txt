ted all the specific food throughout that extent of 
 country ; for, you must remember, if a Seckel pear 
 tree is planted on soil where none stood before, the 
 fruit is the same imperfect specimen as on other 
 trees. Now I am confident that the few pear trees 
 growing in Lancaster county can not have exhausted 
 all the specific elements in the soil of this county ; 
 yet, here, the Seckel pear is no better than at Phila- 
 delphia, although many trees have been planted 
 within my knowledge, on ground where none grew 
 before. 

Again — as to the elements necessary for the pro- 
 duction of fine fruit, being exhausted in the soil — or 
 the theory of high cultivation, or carelesness of farm- 
 ers in not doing things in a proper manner. 

I will give the history of two orchards, not a mile 
 distant from each other. I might give the history of 
 a dozen, but for my purpose two are sufficient. The 
 one was planted according to the scientific mode, the 
 other in the cai-eless way ; both were planted on 
 ground that had never produced a fruit tree since the 
 removal of the primeval forest, and in naturally good 
 soil. The one was planted according to the plan re- 
 commended in " Cox on Fruit trees " — holes w^re dug 
 four feet square, and two feet deep ; the subsoil re- 
 moved and a mixture of surface soil, pond mud, rotten 
 stable manure, with a sprinkling of lime and ashes 
 filled in its place. The trees were placed on this, 
 with surface soil filled in among the roots, and plant- 
 ed as recommended in " the books." These trees 
 grew very vigorously foreightor ten years, — particu- 
 lar attention was paid to remove every useless twig 
 in time to give the tree its proper shape — the ground 
 well cultivated for a series of years and manured 
 with stable manure, pond mud, and a light dressing 
 of lime. This orchard has now stood thirty one years, 
 and has produced two middling ful. crops of fruit. If 
 the trees were reraoved,the field would produce 60 bu. 
 of corn to the acre. 

The other orchard was planted about twenty or 
 twenty-two years since, on the careless plan. Holes 
 one foot square, eighteen inches deep — the roots of 
 the trees forced down, and tramped hard, (much in 
 the mftnner of setting fence posts) ten to twelve inch- 
 es lower than they stood in the nursery — to prevent 
 the wind from blowing them down, as the man told 
 me, when I undertook to give him, as I thought at 
 the time, some valuable hints in respect to planting 
 trees, from my small stock of "book knowledge." — 
 For years this last orchard has been in a far more 
 thrifty state than the other, bearing oftcnor, larger 
 crops, and finer and fairer fruit. 

This is no fancy sketch, but the actual facts and 
 the reader can draw his own conclusions. 

From the foregoing remarks you will understand 
 that I do not believe that neglect or carelesness, is 
 ^XQ cause of unfruitfulness of our trees, or that high 

culture, or specific manures will to any extent reme- 
 dy the evil. 

I am happy to have such high authority to confirm 
 this opinion as the Messrs. Ilovey, of Boston — the 
 very site where such fine fruit is said to be culti- 
 vated. In regard to what are termed special ma- 
 nures, they say — " like other theories which have had 
 their day, and sunk into oblivion, this to a certain 
 extent, we think is likely to sharo no better fate," 
 and again, " we are not yet ready to adopt the views 
 of those writers, prefering rather that their readers, 
 who believe them, should experiment upon their the- 
 ories to their hearts content, as they have with gas- 
 tar, salt, copperas, and similar nostrums, until they 
 have destroyed all tlieir trees, when they will be 
 more likely to listen to the dictates of rsasr^n and 
 common sense." 

From this imperfect sketch of a short history of 
 fruit culture in Lancaster co., it might bo inferred that 
 I would discourage the cultivation of choice fruit,by 
 apparently magnifying the obstacles to be encounter- 
 ed. Far from it ; I would rather urge renewed ex- 
 ertions " perseverance overcometh many obstacles." 
 The seasons may change, bringing renewed produc- 
 tiveness, or the causes may be discovered, and reme- 
 dies applied. I would prefer being the means, how- 
 ever humble, of disabusing the public mind of the 
 wrong impression, thereby relieving the farmers of 
 the unjust charges prefered against them of not car- 
 ing for their trees in a proper manner, and at the same 
 time to caution the inexperienced against adopting 
 any of the "new notions," until after a fiiir trial to 
 a limited extent, will warrant a fuller reliance. 

Trusting, that the increased facilities for procur- 
 ing' trees of the more esteemed varieties — and the 
 stimulus of a constantly increasing demand, as also 
 the " Hope of a better time coming," will make fruit 
 culture an object worthy of renewed attention of 
 farmers and others. 

I remain, respectlully, &c.,

[We differ in opinion with our correspondent in 
 relation to the extent of the ravages of the borer in 
 Lancaster county. Many young orchards, for want 
 of proper attention in time, have been greatly in- 
 jured by them. Quite a number of young tree* 
 which came under our care this spring were badly 
 damaged by thi borer. Some of them were eaten al- 
 most completely off. — Ed.]

Mr. Editor: In looking over several other Agri- 
 cultural Journals which I receive from m(mth to 
 month, I have been struck with the unanimity with 
 which they all condemn the practice of breeding in 
 and in. But the remarks of the writers apply main- 
 ly to the breeding of cattle, horses, &c., poultry be-
