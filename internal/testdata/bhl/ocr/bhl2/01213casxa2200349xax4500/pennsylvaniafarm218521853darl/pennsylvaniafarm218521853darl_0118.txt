ing, I presume, too small a subject to claim their at- 
 tention. 

Feeling, however, a deep interest in chickens, you 
 will I hope, allow me a brief space, in your valuable 
 journal for the purpose of directing the attention of 
 farmers to a subject which interests them all, because 
 they are all to a greater or less extent engaged in it. 

Every one is aware of the fact that generally 
 speaking, the fowls kept by our farmers are small in 
 size, and usually, but indifferent layers. Neither 
 their inferiority in size, nor their poor egg-laying 
 qualities is, however, to be attributed to the kind of 
 food they receive, (for farmers fowls generally fare 
 Avell) nor to any want of attention ; but to the fact 
 that, in very many cases, the stock is never changed, 
 or if changed at all, so seldom as to be productive of 
 no good results. Thousands of miserable, weak- 
 minded people, idiots and lunatics, attest the evil re- 
 sults of marriages between blood relations. If such 
 be the consequences resulting from breeding in and 
 in from the human family, will not the principle ap- 
 ply to fowls. Will not a stock of fowls degenerate 
 from year to year, both in size and in other good 
 qualities, if no additions from other varieties or from 
 other premises are made ? Look to the condition of 
 the chickens usually known, as "dung hill fowls," a 
 variety more generally had than any other kinds in 
 the United States, and which although now small, 
 and comparatively worthless, were doubtless at one 
 time in every respect equal to those for which such 
 enormous prices are now asked. Why this degene- 
 racy ? It is very easily understood. The idea of 
 improving the breed of fowls rarely visits a farmers 
 mind, and in the multiplicity of duties resting upon 
 him, he does not think it a matter of sufficient im- 
 portance to change " crowers " with his neighbor, or 
 to kill off his old ones and purchase new. But this 
 is a great error as I shall endeavor to prove, by facts 
 gathered from my own experience, pnd which I re- 
 spectfully offer for the benefit of my fellow subscri- 
 bers to the Farm Journal. 

Several years since, convinced that by changing 
 my plan of breeding chickens, I could jery ma- 
 terially improve them in some very essential particu- 
 lars, I purchased twenty of the finest dung hill chick- 
 ens I could find — eighteen hens and two cocks, paying 
 attention to size and form only, color being disre- 
 garded. The oldest chicken in the flock was not 
 more than seven months. I purchased them in the 
 fall of the year, provided comfortable quarters for 
 them during the winter, fed them well, and received 
 in return, a fair supply of eggs. 

From this flock I raised during the ensuing sum- 
 mer, about two hundred chickens. The young cocks 
 were either sent to market, or served up for my own 
 table. I did not retain a single one of them. The 
 old ones were also disposed of, and an entire new sup- 
 ply of young cocks of the best form and size I could 

find, purchased. The ensuing spring the same sys- 
 tem was pursued, and I thought the progeny of the 
 second year somewhat superior in size to their pro- 
 genitors. Their laying qualities were certainly bet- 
 ter. The year following, the cocks of the previous 
 year were discarded, and their places filled with new 
 ones. The two year old hens were also put aside, or 
 retained merely for hatching. The third year, I 
 had the satisfaction of beholding the results I had 
 anticipated. 

My chickens were not only greatly improved in 
 appearance ; but I received nearly double the quan- 
 tity of eggs from the same number of fowls. I still 
 pursue this plan, and cannot but commend it to the 
 attention of some of our farmers. My fowls are 
 one half larger than formerly, and cost me no more 
 feed or trouble than the smaller ones, and when 
 sent to market they command a much better price. 

I do not believe it necessary to change the cocks 
 every year, although I have done it with advantage. 
 Every second year would perhaps answer as well ; 
 but changed they should be by all means, it larger 
 fowls are desired.

Plowing in Clover for Wheat. 

Mr. Editor; I wish to let Mr. Gowen, and 
 others who read the Farm Journal, know the effect 
 that plowing in green clover has with me, and give 
 them an opportunity of judging whether it will ben- 
 efit the land or not. 

In the summer of 1849, I had a small field of 4J 
 acres in Clover, which I pastured a while, and then 
 let the clover grow until it was fit to cut for seed. — 
 With a large plow and three strong horses, I plowed 
 it, then harrowed it effectually, and let it lie until 
 28th of September, when I seedeed it. In the har- 
 vest of 1850, I cut 135 dozen of wheat, which yield- 
 ed 165 bushels or 2>Q\ bushels per acre. It did not 
 require to be seeded with clover the next season. I 
 plowed it down last season again, and the wheat now 
 looks fine, although a part was winter-killed. It is 
 proper to state that the crop of Wheat that was on 
 it before the clover was plowed down, did not ex- 
 ceed ten bushels per acre. J. W.

A NcAV Evergreen. 

Mr. Editor : Enclosed is a branch of an Ever- 
 green that I am unacquainted with, as are also the 
 best Botanists in this section of the country, to whom 
 I have showed it. It is a low shrub scarcely rising 
 more than two feet above the surface of the ground, 
 and its leaf you will see is similar to the Hemlock, 
 although it is larger and more beautiful. Its native 
 place of growing is in low moist ground — but I 
 have transplanted it to a dry soil with good succes
