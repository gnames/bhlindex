lie drills two bushele and a half or three bushelb 
 to the acre, in rows oiglit inches apart, and the aver- 
 age crop for six years, has been thirty-four bushels 
 and a half to the acre. A less quantity by thirteen 
 bushels and a half, than that of the man who sowed 
 but one bushel to the acre. 

No reason is given for the adopting so unusual a 
 mode as sowing but one bushel to the acre, but as it 
 is successful, the philosophy of the thing may be dis- 
 cussed. It is a practice, that seems of very limited 
 application, " as a thin sowed crop is later in ripen- 
 ing, and more subject to mildew, and unless accom- 
 panied by the most careful and continued hoeing, 
 more favorable to weeds, besides being more easily 
 affected by the casualties of the season." 

But the farmer who prefers thick sowing, gives his 
 reasons for so doing. 

" He does it, because in his opinion, wheat ought 
 njt to be encouraged to tiller. If the plants are suf- 
 ficiently thick in spring, they at once send up the 
 stalk ; but if the roots are thin, they send out lateral 
 shoots, which strike in the earth, and produce new 
 plants. The first plant is weakened by having to 
 produce auxiliary plants, and the plants of the second 
 growth do not come to maturity, so early as the ori- 
 ginal or parent plant. The quality of the crop is 
 thus injured, as there are always more light anil de- 
 fective grains in a thin sown, than in a thick sown 
 crop ; besides that, there is less seed to meet the con- 
 tingencies of insect and weather." These have every 
 appearance of being good and substantial reasons, 
 though it is not probable that thsy have occurred to 
 the many who adopt the practice of thick sowing, 
 more from habit, or tradition, than reflection. 

If these reasons are examined, we are not sure they 
 will prove satisfactory. As to preventing tillering, 
 is it of importance, or is it possible ? The excessive 
 growth of shoots or suckers, from any one seed, or 
 plant, is certainly not desirable, but it is only likely 
 to take place where the ground ie more than usually 
 rich, and where the seed is more than usually 
 thinly sown, circumstances, by no means common in 
 American farming ; and therefore hardly to be provi- 
 ded against. But all plants will tiller, and the success 
 of a crop of wheat depends on the number of these 
 suckers that will bear grain. The number of plants 
 in any given amount of land — say a square foot — is 
 but small, and if these do not send up shoots or off- 
 sets, the crop will be a very small one ; but it is also 
 true, that where too many are thrown forth, the stem 
 alone will mature. 

It is not, however, to be expected that every seed 
 will produce a plant, or that rnHijTOadcast seeding, 
 every seed will be so cast as to take root. To pre- 
 vent these accidents from affecting the farmer's hopes 
 and destroying the whole result of his labor, an 
 abundant or even a superabundant quantity of seed 
 is the wiser and safer course. 

The drill has done much towards ensuring the 
 safety of our crop of wheat, by placing the seed at 
 regular distances below the surface, and giving every 
 grain a chance. It also makes necessary a more tho- 
 rough tilling of the land. It is in itself a kind of ex- 
 tra harrow, though we have seen as good crops from 
 plowing in, as from drilling; but we are inclined to 
 think, on the whole, that drilling is the best mode of 
 tillage yet devised — the single fact of it making a 
 more careful cultivation necessary, is strongly in its 
 favor. 

The saving of seed is hardly worthy of considera- 
 tion,when other objects of more importance are gained. 
 Too thick sowing, too high manuring and too shallow 
 plowing, often causes the plant to fall or be laid, as 
 it is generally called, by which the crop is injured or 
 lost. This evil result of too much seed is easily 
 avoided. 

On the whole, it may be gathered from these re- 
 marks that thick sowing is better than the opposite.

A Wew Remedy for the Curculio. 

Mr. Editor : — In the yard attached to my resi- 
 dence there are several very fine fruit trees, among 
 which are two superb Orleans plum trees. For se- 
 veral years after the plum trees came to bearing, we 
 had fine crops ; but two years since, although they 
 blossomed well, and fruited too, the young fruit fell 
 to the ground before it had attained one tenth its full 
 size. Upon examination, I found that each one of 
 the fallen plums bore a crescent shaped mark, which 
 I could attribute only to the puncture of an insect. 
 Not being familiar with the manners and habits of 
 the curculio, I did not blame him with the mischief, 
 but concluded to watch closely the ensuing spring 
 for the depredator. Ignorant of the character of the 
 enemy of my fiu't, I determined to try an experiment 
 with one of my trees. I accordingly procured a pound 
 of flour of sulphur, and placing a small iron furnace 
 filled with live coals on a high stool, as near to the 
 lower branches as I could with safety, sprinkled the 
 sulphur lightly on the coals. This was early in the 
 morning while the atmosphere was perfectly calm. 
 As the fumes of the sulphur ascended through the 
 tree, I watched closely for the purpose of ascertain- 
 ing whether any effect had been produced upon my 
 unknown foe. Scarcely had the vapor risen to the 
 topmost branches, when I observed several round 
 looking objects falling. Upon examination I found 
 them to be insects which were entire strangers to me. 
 Gathering up two or three of the nearly defunct lit- 
 tle creatures, I showed them to a friend somewhat 
 skilled in entomology, who at once pronounced them 
 the dreaded curculio — the scamps that had the pre- 
 ceding year destroyed my plums. Much delighted 
 with the discovery, I immediately renewed the sul- 
 phur fumigation, continuing itformore than aweek^
