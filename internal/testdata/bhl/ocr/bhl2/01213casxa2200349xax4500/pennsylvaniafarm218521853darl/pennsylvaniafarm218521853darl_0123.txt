eties here given, the Virginia yellow dent has the 
 most (11 .6 per cent ;) the Pennsylvania yellow dent 
 comes next (9 .36 per cent;) and the large white 
 Kentucky dent the least (8 .G per cent.) 

Fifteen varieties of corn contained an average of 
 13 .89 per cent of nitrogenous substances. 

Again in the article above referred to, it is said : 
 " The predominating ingredients in red clover are 
 lime and potash, with a not inconsiderable proportion 
 of sulphur, but less phosphoric acid and nitrogenous 
 substances." If this had read, the predominating in- 
 gredients, of the asJi of clover, are lime and potash, it 
 would be much clearer ; for the nitrogenous substan- 
 ces in clover are more than the whole of the asJi, in- 
 cluding lime, potash &c. 

But apart from the inaccuracy of the expression, 
 I cannot agree with him, that clover contains but lit- 
 tle nitrogen. It is probably richer in nitrogenous 
 substances than any of the grasses ; and an acre of 
 clover hay contains far more nitrogen than an acre 
 of wheat. It may be useful to compare the amount 
 of nitrogenous substances, (which are gluten, albumen 
 &c., only about 16 per cent of which is nitrogen) in 
 an acre ot the above named crops. 

Gross produce and nitrogenous substances en an 
 acre : 

Gross produce. Nitrogenous substances. 

Wheat 25 B. or 1500 lbs. 185 lbs. 

Wheat straw 3000 do 40 do 

Total amt. of nitrogenous substances 

in one acre 225 lbs. 

I. Corn 45 B. 2700 lbs. 324 lbs. 

C.rodder&cob,4500 do .157 do 

Total amount per acre, 481 lbs. 

Clover Hay 2 tc>ns 4500 lbs. 420 lbs Nitrogenous 
 substances. 

Thus we see that an acre of clover has really, near- 
 ly twice the amount of nitrogenous substances, con- 
 tained in an acre of wheat, and an acre of corn more 
 than twice as much. 

In a series of experiments in the rotation of crops, 
 Boussingault gives the following : 

1st year produced potatoes which contained : 

42 lbs. nitrogen per acre 
 2d " Wheat, 32 " •' " " 

3d " C. Hay, 78 " " " " 

4th " Wheat, 40 " " " " 

5th " Oats 26 " " " " 

It thus appears that the nitrogen in the clover hay 
 on an acre was more than double as much as that in 
 the wheat crop which preceded it : and the nitrogen 
 in the wheat crop which succeeded the clover was 25 
 per cent more than the one which preceded it. This 
 does not corroborate the assertion that "clover speedi- 
 ly exhausts the soil." The analysis of clover roots 
 and stubble proves that they contain more nitrogen 
 than the whole of the wheat crop, straw and all. 

When we consider that the nutritious properties 
 of plants both as food and manure, are in proportion 

to the quantity of nitrogen they contain, we can form 
 some idea of the value of clover. 

Boussingault proved that clover, by being sown 
 In pulverized, burnt clay, and well watered, flourish- 
 ed and increased rapidly in nitrogen ; but wheat in- 
 creased little in nitrogen. 

Now, if clover obtain a large proportion of its ni- 
 trogen from the ammonia in the rain: I ask, can it be 
 so exhausting to the soil ? It is true, clover contains 
 about 7 per cent of ash, but as the article alluded to, 
 stxtes, it is principally lime and potash, which can 
 generally be supplied at a small cost in the form of 
 ashes, and carbonate and sulphate of lime. 

An acre of clover contains about 70 lbs. of lime, 
 and 80 lbs. of potash and soda — a few bushels of 
 lime and ashes would return twice this amount to the 
 land. 

Bousslngalt says : " If the second crop of trefoil 
 (which is the white clover, red clover is still better,) 
 be plowed down, new fertility is imparted to the land in 
 spite of the considerable amount ol" forage removed 
 In the first crop. '"' * * Clover leaves more resi- 
 due (In form of roots and stubble) than the potatoe, 
 and on this ground alone ought to favor the cereal 
 that folbws it ; but it has a, favorable influence otit of 
 all proportion with its quantity, contrasting this 
 with the residue of either of the hard crops." 

If clover was so exhausting to the soil, its roots and 
 stubble could only lessen the amount of exhaistion, 
 but instead of this, careful experiments prove thatthe 
 crops which follow it, with nothing but the roots and 
 stubble for a manure, are far better than those that 
 precede ; and we have presented the opinion of an 
 eminent writer on agricultural chemistry, that the 
 soil will boar removing the first crop of clover and 
 retain Its fertility with only the second crop plowed 
 down. 

AVheat, Indian corn, and clover, are of so much im- 
 portance, not only to the agriculturist, but to all 
 classes of society, that I have thought proper to oc- 
 cupy so much space in the colums of j'our Journal : 
 there are numerous other facts corroborating the 
 views here presented, but lest this is already too long 
 to be carefully read, I shall conclude.

Spent Tan Bark. 

Mr. Editor : In a former number of the Journal, 
 I observed an article from one of your correspon- 
 dents in Cumberland county, detailing his method of 
 rendering spent tan-bark available for fertilizing pur- 
 poses. I was much pleased to find that some one 
 had at length taken hold of the subject, as I deem it 
 worthy consideration. 

For a number of years past I have been In the 
 habit of using spent tan-bark in my garden, and 
 with the very best results. The soil on which it was
