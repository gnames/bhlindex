Mr. Editor : — I should like to see more attention 
 paid to the subject o^ mineral and natural manures, 
 by the practical farmers who -write for the Journal, 
 than has yet been given. Is it not probable that 
 every large farm has, to a great extent, within its 
 bounds the natural material for its own fertilization, 
 if properly sought for and scientifically applied ? — 
 The peat or the black vegetable deposit of the 
 swamps and bottoms, if carried to the exhausted up- 
 lands — the sediment of dams and streams, if applied 
 to the surface of meadow, after going through the 
 compost heaps — even the sand and gravel of the bar- 
 ren ridges, if mixed with the heavy and wet surface 
 of stiff fields underlaid by impervious yellow clay — 
 all these changes, and many more that might be 
 named, would have the most beneficial efiect. * 

* The following article from Moore's Rural New- 
 Torker illustrates this idea : 

Mixing Soils. — Some nine or ten years ago, in the 
 early part of my farming, I had occasion to deepen a 
 well about six or eight feet. The earth thrown out 
 was a tenacious blue clay, just damp enough to cut 
 into lumps, and adhesive enough to remain so. Af- 
 ter finishing the well, the man who had charge of the 
 farm was at a loss to know where to deposit it. Hav- 
 ing a rare sandy knoll in one of the fields, which was 
 not inaptly termed "personal property," from its be- 
 ing wafted about by every breeze, here to-day, and 
 there to-morrow, it occurred to me that the clay would 
 hold the sand and form a soil. I accordingly ordered 
 it to be d jposited there in heaps, the same as if ma- 
 nure. This was in the summer. In the fall the 
 lumps were scattered over the surfixce and left to the 
 action of the rain and frost. In the spring it was 
 found to have broken down, crumbled and slacked 
 like lime. These heaps were reduced and the clay 
 evenly spread over the surface. The field received a 
 coat of manure, was plowed, and sown with oats and 
 peas. That where the clay was applied, produced 
 the largest and most vigorous growth, of any other 
 part of the field, In the fall it was sown Avith rye, 
 and seeded with timothy and clover. The rye as 
 well as the clover was much more vigorous and heav- 
 ier on that, than on any other part of the field. In 
 fact, the person who occupied the farm after I left it, 
 informed me, that he lost his crop of grass on that 
 part in consequence of its lodging. Thus the person- 
 al was made real or fast property, and remains so to 
 the present day. 

Having experienced such beneficial effects from 
 mixing clay with sand, I was afterwards induced to 
 try what effect s?nd would have on a rather retentive 
 soil. The garden at Three Hills Farm is a stiff clay 
 loam resting on a tenacious clay sub-soil, rather in- 
 clining to moisture. The second year after I pur- 
 • chased and took possession of it, I caused a coat of 
 Band, from six to eight inches in depth, to be put on 
 one of the squares, which was spaded in with the ma- 
 nure, and I had the satislaction to witness the most 
 gratifying and happy results — the crop on that square 
 was far superior to any other in the garden. Since 
 then I have caused over five hundred one-horse cart 
 loads of sand to bo put in the garden, and the effect 
 is still visible, aJtbough the Band has disappeared. —

It is not, however, my object to folow out this sub- 
 ject in detail; but, in connexion with Lime, Gypsum 
 and marl, which are the chief mineral manures used, 
 to state a fact relative to the latter, Avhich may put 
 others, having more knowledge and time for such 
 pursuits, upon further investigation. 

About a month ago, some workm^en employed by 
 one of the Supervisors of East Lampeter Township, 
 in this County, while digging for the foundation of a 
 small bridge on the new road recently opened from 
 Cyrus Miller's Tavern, near the east end of Witwcr's 
 Bridge, to Samuel llanck's mill, came upon a bed of 
 what I supposed, being then on the spot, to be marl. 
 The only test at hand was some common and not very 
 strong vinegar. When a portion was thrown into this 
 acid, a strong, audible, and long continued effcrves- 
 ence at once took place ; and afterwards the applica- 
 tion of diluted sulphuric acid, of the drug stores (one 
 part oil of vitriol to seven parts water) produced the 
 same result in a much more marked degree. There 
 is is no doubt of this substance being marl — probably 
 what is called shell marl. 

"When first thrown up, part of it adheres together 
 in lumps, like stiff clay, and part falls into small 
 pieces like gravel. In color it is a whitish grey; and 
 when for days exposed to the sun and air, becomes 
 as hard as stiff yellow clay under similar circum- 
 stances. Its composition seems to be about one-third 
 nodules of stone, varying In size from that of a pea 
 to a hulled walnut, and the residue a greyish clay or 
 marl, easily pulverized in the fingers, freely efferves- 
 cing in acid, and containing little grit. In fact this 
 portion, or two-thirds of the mass, is marl and is evi- 
 dently composed of the remains of shells. On being 
 broken, the nodules present a clean shining fracture, 
 of a brown or yellow color, with generally a dark 
 spot in the centre, around which the pebble seems to 
 have been formed by successive lamintiaon. 

This deposit — which was struck at about three feet 
 from the surface, and penetrable about two feet with- 
 out reaching the bottom — is situated about one hun- 
 dred and fifty yards east of the Conestogo, and th6 
 same distance north of Miller's tavern, on both sides 
 of a small rivulet which falls into the Conestogo a 
 few yards north of Wltmer's bridge. It has been 
 found on the land of Henry Layman and the subscri- 
 ber, and without doubt extcjids into that of the heirs 
 of Michael Metzgar, deceased. 

I have no doubt of its being good shell marl, and 
 as little of its value as a manure. The only question 
 is, whether it will be found in sufiiclent body to pay 
 the cost of opening the soil and working It. But 
 whether this be the case or not in this particular 
 instance, the presence of even a small deposit at 
 one point in the county, would seem to indicate its 
 existence at other localities, in probably larger quan- 
 tity ; and should cause observant farmers never to
