The Ruta-Baga or Swedes Turnip. 

Mk. Editor : It has frequeutly been a source of 
 surprise to me that greater attention has not been 
 given to the cultivation of the Iluta-Baga in Penn- 
 sylvania. I have observed in several former num- 
 bers of the Journal, that you have pressed the mat- 
 ter upon the attention of your readers, but thus far, 
 with seemingly little effect. In calling attention to 
 the subject, I have not the vanity to suppose that any 
 thing I may be able to say in behalf of Ruta baga 
 culture, vrill have any greater effect, than what you 
 have already said, but as "constant dropping wears 
 away stones," so the frequent direction of the atten- 
 tion of our farmers to this important subject may at 
 length have the desired effect. 

Without being able to speak with certainty, my 
 own impression is, that in addition to the fact that 
 no crop taken from thesoil leaves it in finer condition 
 for the succeeding one, it imparts to it also, a singu- 
 lar degree of fertilitj-. I may be wrong in this, but 
 my own experience has taught me to know, that the 
 crop succeeding the ruta-bagas. always appears to do 
 better than any other on my farm. Perhaps the in- 
 creased fertility may be attributed to the fact that I 
 always leave a considerable portion of the turnips in 
 the ground during the winter, for the use of my 
 sheep, thus creating a large amount of vegetable 
 matter, the decomposition of which adds much to the 
 fertility of the soil, particularly when, (as alwaj's 
 should be the case) this large supply of vegetable 
 matter is made available as a fertilizer by the appli- 
 cation of a moderate dose of lime. 

But apart from any advantages the ruta-baga crop 
 may bs to the soil in which it is grown, there are oth- 
 er and far more important considerations in favor of 
 its general cultivation. 

It is a well known fact that previous to the exten- 
 sive cultivation of the root crops in England, that 
 country was supposed to have reached the utmost 
 limits of its capacity for supporting cattle ; but 
 that subsequently, it has been satisfixctorily proven, 
 that with the aid of the turnip its capacity in this 
 particular has been more than trebled. Does not this 
 fact speak volumes to those who are complaining of 
 a want of manure sufficient to keep their soil in good 
 tilth ? If by the almost universal introduction of 
 turnip culti\ation into England, her powers of sup- 
 porting cattle have been increased in the ratio of 
 three to one, why may not the same results follow, in 
 the United States ? They would as certainly follow, 
 as that summer follows spring. 

The earlincss and severity of our winters has been 
 repeatedly urged as an objection to the cultivation of 
 the ruta-baga. But this objection I cannot deem a 
 valid one, as they have ample time to mature before 
 the cold weather sets in, and if buried in pits or 
 stored away in cellars, with the proper degree of ven- 
 tilation, they will keep well during the winter ; 

the ruta-baga being less suljject to decay than any 
 of the other varieties of the turnip. 

In concluding these remarks, I will merely advert 
 to a few of the advantages which our farmers 
 would derive from the extensive cultivation of this 
 crop. It leaves the ground in a clean state, admira- 
 bly adapting it to the crop which is to follow. In 
 those sections of our State, which are conceded 
 to be amongst the best sheep growing districts 
 in the United States, the ruta-baga would cer- 
 tainly prove an invaluable crop. Again, where the 
 farmer has to depend entirely upon dry food for his 
 cattle during the winter, they rarely thrive so well, 
 or are so strong and healthy as when they have an 
 abundant supply of succulent food, such as the ruta- 
 baga. That they possess fattening qualities is at- 
 tested by the large number of cattle now fattened up- 
 on them and straw alone, in England. But apart 
 from these evidences of their value, there is another 
 consideration of the highest importance. The farm- 
 er who cultivates turnips for his stock is enabled to 
 increase not only the number of his cattle, but what 
 is of still greater value, the size of his manure heap, 
 and consequently, the fertility of his soil. June is 
 the month in which the ruta-baga should be sown, 
 though many prefer the early part or middle of July. 
 In the Rural New Yorker of June 17th, I find an 
 excellent article on the cultivation of the ruta-baga, 
 which might aid somewhat in convincing your read- 
 ers of the utility of the crop, and the ease with 
 which it may be cultivMed.

CULTIVATION OF RUTA BAGAS. 

A rich mellow soil is required, — they delight in 
 deep sandy moulds, and new ground, grass-swards, 
 or clover leys, are well suited to their production. — 
 Liberally manured and well cultivated, such soils 
 will produce heavy crops, — from eight hundred to 
 one tliousand bushels per acre have often been raised 
 in favorable seasons. The value of the crop and the 
 ease of its culture is much increased by careful and 
 thorough preparation of the soil. The groiind should 
 be plowed very deeply, and if it be sward-ground, 
 then thoroughly harrowed, or better, if worked with 
 the wheel cultivator until it is in fine tilth, with at 
 least four inches of surface mould above the undis- 
 turbed sod. Fifteen or twenty loads of well rotted 
 manure should be applied to an acre, either during 
 the harrowing and working, so as to have it well in- 
 termixed Aviththe soil, — or, after it is performed, fur- 
 row the ground about twenty inches apart, and place 
 two thirds of the quantity of manure in the furrows, 
 then cover with the plow, harrow lightly lengthwise, 
 and drill in your seed with some cirill machine 
 (Ilalluck's hand drill will do it,) on the ridges thus 
 formed. If you have no drill a lino can be traced 
 about an inch deep on the top of the furrow and the 
 seed sown from the hand, or a horn or cup with a 
 small hole to permit its escape in proper quantities. 
 It shonld then be carefully covered with earth. If 
 the manure is spread broad-cast, it is not necessary 
 to ridge the ground, though it is often practiced. — 
 About one pound of seed is sufficient for an acre.
