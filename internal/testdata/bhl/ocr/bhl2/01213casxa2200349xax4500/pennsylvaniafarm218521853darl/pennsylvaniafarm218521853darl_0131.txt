When the plants come up they should be dusted 
 with lime, ashes or soot, which not only assists their 
 growth, but serves as a partial protection from in- 
 sects. If the fly is likely to be very injurious, a 
 sprinkling of fish oil is said to be a perfect pro- 
 tection. 

The cultivation should be similar to that of car- 
 rots, &c., — careful and thorough, to the utter destruc- 
 tion of all weeds and grass, and keeping the soil 
 mellow and open to the influence of air, rain and 
 sunshine. The plants should be thinned in the rows 
 to about eight inches apart, so that they may have 
 full room (if they will,) to attain that diameter. If 
 the seed fiiils to come up in some places tlie plants 
 may be transplanted from the thicker portions, and 
 if done with care in damp weather, they will make 
 an equal growth with the others. 

The ruta baga should be harvested before freezing 
 weather, though slight frosts Avill not hurt them. — 
 They may be kept in cellars, hurried in pits, or cov- 
 ered with straw and earth in heaps, in the fleld, and 
 if properly done, and ventilation allowed, will keep 
 without difficulty through the winter. For late win- 
 ter and spring feeding thoy are "just the article." —

Br ds and liOoking Glasses. 

Mk. Editor : A paragraph which had its origin 
 somewhere in the East, has been going the rounds of 
 the papers, in which the writer strongly recommends 
 the use of looking glasses for the purpose of fright- 
 ning birds from fruit trees. Having a number of 
 young cherry trees, (in bearing this season for the first 
 time,) and being very desirous of ascertaining the 
 character of the fruit they bore, I tried several devi- 
 ces to frighten away the birds, who were making 
 terrible havoc amongst them ; but all my attempts 
 were failures. At length the looking glass remedy 
 was thought of, and quite a number of pieces of bro- 
 ken looking glass of good size was procured. These 
 I suspended .as per direction, in various parts of 
 the trees, fastening them in such a manner that the 
 slightest breeze would cause them to turn. Having 
 arranged them all very nicely, I sat down under a 
 neighboring tree for the purpose of enjoying the ter- 
 rible fright in store for the little feathered thieves. 
 Presently a male robin alighted on one of the trees, 
 and much to my surprise and chagrin, proceeded as 
 leisurely to j^luck a cherry, as though no such thing 
 as looking glasses were hanging aroun 1. A black- 
 bird came next, and followed the example of the 
 the robin, and immediately after him, a small flock 
 of those arrant thieves — cherry birds. Had each 
 one taken a cherry and with it his departure, I 
 could have borne it, but the scamps instead of acting 
 thug, perched themselves near the finest clusters, and 
 selecting the ripest, commenced pecking them most 
 unmercifully, the looking gla:Ses to the contrary not- 
 withstanding. Seeing this, I gave up in despair, 
 firmly convinced that either the birds in our vicinity 
 were not easily frightened, or that the looking glass 
 experiment was a humbug. * 

This is the farmer's busy season. 

Apples for Swine, 

Mr. Editor : — As there is fair prospect of an abun- 
 dant crop of apples this season, the agitation of the 
 question, whether thej- do or do not contain fattening 
 qualities in a sufficient degree to render them profita 
 blc as food for swine, is entitled to a passing consider- 
 ation. Various statementsin regard to their value have 
 been published from time to time ; but no definite 
 fixed method of rendering them most available has 
 yet met my eye. After an experience of several 
 3'ears, I have come to the conclusion that although 
 they possess fattening qualities, the^ do not possess 
 them in a sufficient degree to warrant the assertion 
 that alone, they can be used with success in fattening 
 hogs. Hogs will sometimes thrive well upon them, 
 and at other times will lose flesh if confined to them 
 exclusively as food. 

Three years since, having an abundant crop, I con- 
 cluded to test their value as food in various ways. — 
 First, I tried them in their natural state, as they 
 came from the orchard. For a short time the hogs 
 devoured them greedily ; but I soon f und out that 
 they tired of them, and that even when they ate them 
 most greedily, did not thrive. I next threw them into 
 the hogsheads in which my slops were kept, permit- 
 ting them to remain there for several days before us- 
 ing ; by which time many of them (especiallj'^ those 
 partially decayed when thrown in) were well satura- 
 ted '.vith the slop-water. They were then fed ; but the 
 hogs did not thrive any better than before the apples 
 were given them. I then erected a temporary boiler in 
 Avhich the apples were placed, mixed with about one- 
 half the quantity of corn meal I usually fed the hogs. 
 The whole was then boiled, until the apples were 
 soft enough to be broken, by stirring — they being of 
 the sour kind. This mixture was then fed in th 
 same quantity as the meal mixture alone, had been 
 formerly. On this food the hogs grew larger and 
 fatter, observing which, I persevered in it until 
 killing time, when I found them in quite as good con- 
 dition, I think, as I could have had them by feeding 
 them in the usual way. By this plan I saved one- 
 half my corn meal at the expense of the wood ne- 
 cessary to boil the apples. Whether any thing was 
 saved by the experiment, I am not prepared to say, 
 as I kept no account of the wood burned. From the 
 above experiment I am induced to believe that apples 
 in their natural or raw state, do not possess sufficient 
 nutrition to fatten swine ; but that if steamed or 
 boiled, and mixed with meal, they may be used to 
 advantage, provided wood is not too high is price.

A Iietter from Butler Couutj-. 

Mr. Editor : — Our farmers have at length become 
 aroused to a sense of the importance of taking a step 
 in advance of the old fiisLioncd mode of tilling the 
 soil. This has long been needed in our county, and
