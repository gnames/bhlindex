[July, 

is none the less gratifying because somewhat behind 
 our eastern brethren. " Poor Butler" is the title usu- 
 ally given our country, and I am led to indulge the 
 hope that efforts which are now making will result 
 in the permanent establishment of those principles 
 upon which successful agriculture alone can rest, 
 and the redemption our character from the stigma 
 which hangs upon it. 

The system heretofore pursued in this section of 
 country, has been that familiarly known as the "skin- 
 ning system," or in other words, taking every thing 
 that can be got from the soil; and returning as little 
 as possible to it. For a number of years nature 
 winked at these plunderlngs from her stores, and 
 good naturedly supplied the hungry demand, so long 
 as she had the power ; but at length wearied with 
 the unreasonable demands made upon her, she, in 
 common parlance, "shut down," and now our far- 
 mers are compelled to adopt such measures as will 
 serve to repair the error into which they have fallen. 
 These remarks will not of course apply to all, as wo 
 have some excellent farmers in our county, who for 
 a series years have been laboring, and successfully 
 too, on the proper plan. 

The first step towards improvement in every de- 
 partment of life, is to discover that we have 
 been acting upon wrong principles. Having learned 
 our error, we are striving to correct it. We have de- 
 termined to deal more fairly with mother earth, by 
 restoring at least a portion of the good things of 
 which we have been robbing her ; fully convinced 
 that she is of a forgiving spirit, and will not give the 
 " cold shoulder" to our efforts. Hoping that the 
 more general introduction of the Farm Journal will 

serve to help us in our good resolves. I am yours, 

Tnos. J. Layton.

" Ferseverando omnia vincU," friend Layton. Get 
 your Society into the hands of enterprising men, 
 though there be but half a dozen — men who are not 
 afraid to undertake a great reform, and having hav- 
 ing undertaken it, will see it through. " There is a 
 better day coming" for agriculture in Pennsylvania, 
 and its light, we trust, will be shed as fully upon 
 " Poor Butler," as you term your county, as upon 
 any other county. Introduce the Farm Journal, and 
 you shall have the benefit of the experience our best 
 farmers, as well as of our own feeble efforts in your 

behalf. Let us hear more frequently from you, in- 
 forming us what progress you are making.

The stated meeting of this society occurred on 
 Thursday evening, June 15th, 1852, in the Chinese 
 Saloon, Philadelphia. Dr. W. D. Brinckle, V. P., 
 in the chair. The Exhibition on this occasion was 
 very interesting and the displav excellent, consisting 
 of four large contributions of green house plants — 
 an extensive display of Strawberries and Cherries,and 
 two long tables of forced Vegetables. The collec- 
 tion of plants from C. Cope's houses contained some 

tliirty choice specimens — Lobelia racemosa, a new 
 plant seen for the first time ; a fine and well grown 
 specimen of the Cuphea platycentra, a large Aga- 
 panilms umbcUaius, Gongora macidata. Fuchsias in -J 
 variety, select Verbenas, Geraniums etc.; also anoth- ^k 
 er cut flower of the famed Victoria regia, and many 
 of the night blooming cereus. From Frederick Len- 
 nigs — a fine plant of Allamanda cathartica, Clere- 
 dendrum devoiiiense, Cijrtoccras rejlexa. Begonias, 
 Ili/drangeas, Achimenes, Gloxinias, in all about 2 . 
 dozen specimens. From Robert Buist's — many 
 choice fancy Geraniums, fine Fuchsias, Petunias, 
 Angelonia, Rondeletia, together nearly twenty plants. 
 Peter Raabe's table contained numerous seedling 
 Verbenas remarkably fine and choice. The floral 
 designs, Bakets and Boquets, by John Miller garden- 
 er to C. Cope, Robert Kilvingston and others, were 
 very showy. The fruits, however, were the attrac- 
 tion and decidedly tempting ; the display of Straw- 
 berries from Jos. S. Loverings's has not been sur- 
 passed on any former occasion, consisting of the 
 Iowa, Burr's Pine, Keene's and Ilovey's Seedlings : 
 from Gerhard Schmitz another seedling of merit, 
 fine in flavor, large in size and rich in depth of color- 
 ing, he has named it the " Pennsylvania ; and from 
 C.Cope'sfine Ilovey's Seedling. Cherries were shown 
 by James Bisset, gardener to James Dun das, Isaac >■ 
 B. Baxter, Mrs. J. B. Smith, and T. P. James, the 
 May duke variety, and Robert Cornelius the Bleed- 
 ing heart variety. The tables of vegetables were 
 from C. Cope's and R. Cornelius' gardens and were 
 creditable to their gardeners.
