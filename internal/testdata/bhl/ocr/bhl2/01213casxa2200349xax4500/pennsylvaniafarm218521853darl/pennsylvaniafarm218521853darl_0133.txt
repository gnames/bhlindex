500 AGENTS WANTED. 

We are desirous of securing one or more competent 
 agents in every county in Pennsylvania, to canvass 
 for the Farm Journal. Our terms are liberal, and 
 we are assured by well-informed friends in every por 
 tion of the State, that competent and active agents 
 could not fail to succeed well. We therefore invite 
 persons desirous of taking agencies to address us 
 (postpaid) on the subject; furnishing us with satis- 
 factory reference, and stating in what particular 
 county they are desirous of canvassing. 

Premium liist of the State Society. 
 We had hoped to present to our readers this month, 
 the Premium list of the State Agricultural Society ; 
 but have been disappointed. It is to be regretted 
 that it has not already been issued. The lists of 
 the New York, Maryland, Ohio and other State 
 Societies, have been before the public for some 
 time past. The earlier the day of publication, the 
 greater, in all probability, the display will be ; as the 
 the premiums offered are strong incentives to exer- 
 tion. In a little more than three months the Fair 
 will be held, and every hour of that time, will be ne- 
 cessary to enable persons who desire to compete for 
 premiums, to prepare the articles, get their stock in 
 goodcondition,&c. We are authorized to statethat the 
 premiums will be much more liberal this year than 
 last, so that the inducements to compete for them 
 will be stiU stronger. 

National Agricultural Convention. — A circular 
 emanating from a majority of the State Agricultural 
 Societies of the United States, and addressed to the 
 friends of Agriculture throughout the U. States, invit- 
 ing them to attend a meeting to be held in the city 
 of Washington, on the 24th of June, for the purpose 
 of forming a National Agricultural Society, was re- 
 ceived at too late a date to admit of insertion in our 
 last. Now it is too late, yet we hope the objects con- 
 templated by those who are moving the matter, will 
 be fully realized. Every movement of this kind is 
 calculated to advance the interests of Agriculture, 
 and should, therefore, be encouraged. Wo will lay 
 the proceedings of the Convention before our readers 
 in our next. 

Acknowledgments. 

Cochin China Fowls. Mr. Charles Sampson of 
 West Roxborough, Mass., has our thanks for a pair 
 of very superior Cochin China pullets, of his own im- 
 portation. They are beautiful fowls, and thus far 
 have proven themselves excellent layers. Mr. S. has 
 a few of these fowls for sale at $10 per pair. If any 
 of our friends desire a sight of them, they can be 
 gratified by calling at our residence. 

Mr. C. B. Rogers, dealer in Agricultural Imple- 
 ments, Seeds, &c. 29 Market street, Philadelphia,ha8 
 sent us one of his " Cast Steel Extending Point 
 Ploics," and also one of his Expanding Cultivators. 
 They are remarkably well finished implements and 
 so far as a mere examination of them, without trial, 
 enables us to judge, well adapted to do good work. — 
 A plow of this same kind was exhibited at the 
 World's Fair, where it attracted considerable atten- 
 tion : but from the fact that no person was present 
 to have its merits tested, no report, we believe was 
 made concerning it. We shall have a fair trial given it, 
 and will, at a future day, notice its work. Plows of 
 this kind may be seen at Mr. Steinman's Hard- 
 ware Store, the only agency for the sale of them in 
 Lancaster. 

The Cultivator, a cut of which we give, is we think 
 a good implement, differing somewhat from the Cul- 

tivators in general use. The arrangement for ex- 
 panding or contracting its width is very complete. — 
 The teeth, too, differ from the old kinds ; some (as 
 represented in the cut,) being of the form of small 
 plows, others of the usual shape, excepting the part 
 nearest the frame, which is wider, and better calcula- 
 ted, wo think, to effect a more complete pulveriza- 
 tion of the soil. Mr. Stcinman has the Cultivators 
 for sale also.
