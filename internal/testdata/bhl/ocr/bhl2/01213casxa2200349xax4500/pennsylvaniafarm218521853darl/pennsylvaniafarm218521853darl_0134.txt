A visit to the residence of Caleb Cope, Esq. 

Availing ourselves of a few leisure hours, vrhilo on 
 a visit to PJiiladelpliia during the last month, we 
 made, by invitation, a flying Irip to the beautiful 
 country seat of Caleb Cope, Esq., near Tacony, We 
 found the gentlemanly proprietor at home, and as we 
 had but an hour to spend, proceeded under his guid- 
 ance to the different points of interest about the gar- 
 den and farm. 

Our attention was, of course, first directed to the 
 house containing the far famed Victoria Regia, a 
 plant of which Mr. Cope has, thus far, been the 
 most successful cultivator in the world. We will not 
 attempt a description of the costly arrangmcnts ne- 
 cessary to a growth of this royal plant, nor enter into 
 the details of expense incurred. Suffice it to say that 
 Mr. C. has won the reputation of being one of the 
 most successful living horticulturists, at a cost of 
 several thousand dollars. 

AYe had only time to take a has'y look at the 
 "Queen of the Aquatics," as it reposed in silent grace 
 and majesty on the bosom of the waters — its gigantic 
 leaves, four in number, covering almost entirely the 
 surface of the tank, which is eighteen feet in diame- 
 ter. Several of the leaves were more than six feet 
 diameter or nineteen feet in circumference. We 
 could have lingered for hours around this interesting 
 spot, examining the beauties and wonders of the 
 plant, and listening to the details of the mode of cul- 
 ture, the anxieties attendant upon the first attempt, 
 and the feelings of triumph, when in its glory, 
 the superb plant unfolded all its beauties ; but the 
 rapidly passing moments compelled us to leave, after 
 hastily examining a number of the rare and elegant 
 plants that surround the Victoria. 

We next proceeded to the green house containing 
 those freaks of nature, the Air plants. Every thing 
 in this department was in keeping with the charac- 
 ter of the plants growing there, and displayed great 
 taste. Taking a hasty glance at the splendid collec- 
 tion of Cacti in the next house, numbering many 
 hundred varieties, of the finest character, we were 
 conducted to various other green houses, one con- 
 taining a choice collection of of Camellias, another 
 of grapes, peaches, nectarines, plums, &c., another 
 roses &c.; after which, leaving the green houses and 
 their attractive occupants, we took a hasty stroll 
 across the well-kept lawn, to a grove of majestic 
 oaks, immediately in front of the beautiful mansion 
 house. Thence to the barn — a building in external 
 appearance far handsomer than many country resi- 
 dences, and in internal arrangements complete in 
 every particular. We had not time to examine mi- 
 nutely, or note down the excellency of the plan of 
 this barn; but think it possessed of very many advan- 
 tages. The dairy was next visited, where neatness 
 prevailed in every department, and after an exam- 

ination of the admirable working of the two hydrau- 
 lic rams, which supply the gi-een houses, fountains, 
 SuC, with water; our courteous host escorled us to 
 the omnibus, by which we were conveyed to Tacony. 
 Our visit, though brief, was fraught with pleasure 
 and our thanks, as well as the thanks of those who 
 accompanied us, are due Mr. Cope for the very gen- 
 tlemanly attention paid us, during the time we spent 
 on his premises. 

Meeting of the Fruit Committee of the Lancas- 
 ter Co. Ag. Soc. — The Committee met at the house 
 of Daniel Rhoades, Esq., on Wednesday, June 21. — 
 The display of fruits was small but excellent; amongst 
 the specimens worthy of note, were some fine, well 
 flavored cherries from Mr. Ehoades' garden; also, 
 some very large and remarkably handsome cherries 
 of the Cumberland Seedling variety. Several of these 
 wore more than three inches in circumference, altho' 
 not fully ripe. Being a tolerably early variety, ex- 
 traordinary in size, full fleshed, prolific, and of good 
 flavor, the more extensive cultivation of the Cumber- 
 land Seedling should be an object with our fruit grow- 
 ers. Mr. David Miller of Carlisle, Cumberland Co., 
 can, we understand, supply young trees. 

But the most attractive part of thejdisplay was a 
 fine seedling strawberry presented by Mr. J. L. Grosh, 
 residing near Petersburg in Lancaster. One of these 
 berries measured nearly ^t-e inches in circumference. 
 In point of size, generally, they are perhaps not equal 
 to the Hovey Seedling, in color deeper, in flavor far 
 superior, and well adapted for carrying. We learn 
 that this seedling was produced from the Ilovey, but 
 could not ascertain the full particulars. It is repre- 
 sented as a prolific bearer, and we think it well wor- 
 thy of attention. 

Our tasteful and enterprising friend, Hon. D. B. 
 Vondersmith, of Lancaster, has recently, in addition 
 to the many rare and beautiful plants already in his j 
 collection, added a young plant of the celebrated * 
 Victoria Regia. Mr. V. has spared neither pains nor 
 expense to insure success in his undertaking, having 
 erected a handsome and commodious tank, and the 
 fixtures necessary to the growth of the plant. If 
 successful, as we have no doubt he will be, our citizens 
 will enjoy a sight of this gigantic and elegant flower. 
 We are pleased to make mention of Mr. V's liberali- 
 ty and enterprise, and hope it will be followed by 'S 
 others whose means and leisure give them ample fa- ■ 
 cilities for attention to horticultural pvirsuits. 

Australian Wheat. — The attention of our farm- 
 ers is directed to the advertisement of IMcssrs. A. B. 
 Allen & Co., of New York, in which they offer Aus- 
 tralian Wheat for sale. AVe are not familiar with 
 the character of the Wheat, but observe that it is 
 cultivated with success in New York, and that it is 
 fast rising in favor with the farmers of that State.
