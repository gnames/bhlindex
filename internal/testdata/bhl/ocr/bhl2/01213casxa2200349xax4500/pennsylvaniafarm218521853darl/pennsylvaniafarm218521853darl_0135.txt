Chester County Horticultural Society. 

We coull aot but regi-et that it was not in our 
 power to attend the Semi-annual Horticultural Ex- 
 hibition, held at West Chester on the 17th, 18th and 
 19th of June. We have always enjoyed ourselves 
 Avith our Chester County friends, and it would have 
 afforded us much pleasure to have been with them on 
 this occasion. We are gratified to learn that the Ex- 
 hibition was creditable in the highest degree ; the 
 various departments of flowers, fruit, vegetables, 
 needle work, mechanic arts, &c., being well filled. — 
 The attendance, too, of citizens of Chester and the 
 adjoining counties, was full, and the warm interest 
 manifested at preceding exhibitions still maintained. 
 This is gratifying and furnishes a strong incentive 
 to the friends of Horticulture and Agriculture, in oth- 
 er counties of the State, to follow the laudable ex- 
 ample of the citizens of Chester county. These de- 
 lightful exhibitions are the result of the well directed 
 efforts of a few spirited individuals, who several 
 years since, under discouraging circumstances re- 
 solved to attempt to,cstablish a Horticultural Society. 
 From small beginings they have gone on flourishing, 
 until the interest and zeal of the enterprising few, 
 now pervade the entire county, and is still on the in- 
 crease. It would afford us pleasure to publish the 
 proceedings, but our limited space this month forbids. 
 Our friends will, we hope, take the will for the deed 
 this time. 

Tobacco Growing iu Pennsylvania. 

We are glad to observe that the mania for tobacco 
 raising in Pennsylvania has somewhat subsided, and 
 that the quantity planted this season, will not be one 
 fourth that of last. We never were in favor of the 
 culture of this crop in our State, believing, that our 
 lands may be more profitably devoted to the culture 
 of other crops better adapted to the soil and climate. It 
 never would have obtained a foothold with our farm- 
 ers, but for the fact that the high prices secured for 
 the crop of 1850, led many to suppose that a speedy 
 fortune would be realized by every one who engaged 
 in its culture to any extent. Extravagant prices 
 were paid for lands adapted to its successful cultiva- 
 tion. These lands were put in the finest possible 
 condition, at a very heavy expense, the crop was cul- 
 tivated with the utmost care, generally, and the re- 
 sult has been a complete glut of the market, the best 
 quality commanding only five cents, and the inferior 
 from three to four. 

Chappell's Fertilizer. — P. S. Chappell of Balti- 
 more desires us to call attention to his improved fer- 
 tilizer, which is represented as highly valuable for 
 agricultural purposes. Having never had an oppor- 
 tunity of testing its merits, nor of witnessing its ef- 
 fects upon particular crops ; we are not prepared to 
 eay more of it, than to call the attention of our read- 
 ers to the advertisement of Mr. C. in another part of 
 the Journal, 

AVhat is Chemistry doing for Agriculture. 

From a very able review of a number of valuable 
 agricultural publications, we condense the following', 
 showing, in a degree, what science has done for the 
 farmer. A cand id perusal of these extracts will serve 
 perhaps to convince some who are skeptics in regard 
 to the value of science, and who look with favor up- 
 on practice only, that tlic subject of farming must be 
 viewed from different stand-points, in order to arrive 
 at correct conclusions. 

Among the parts of the living animal, the muscles 
 occupy an important place, not merely in bulk, but in 
 reference also to tlic health and strengtli of the body. 
 The muscles contain nitrogen; and, besides a little 
 fat, are mainly composed of a substance to which, be- 
 cause of its stringy or fibrous nature, chemists give 
 the name o? fibrin. Now this fibrin is ahnost identi- 
 cal, in chemical cliaracter and composition, with the 
 white of eggs, (albumen,) the curd of milk, (casein.) 
 with the gluten of wheat, and with certain similar 
 substances which exist in beans, peas, barley, oats, 
 potatoes, turnips, cabbage, and, in fact, in almost ev- 
 ery vegetable esculent, in greater or less proportion. 
 All these substances contain nearly the same per 
 centage of nitrogen, and are distinguished by the gen- 
 eral name o? protein compounds. 

It is now ascertained, that when vegetable food is 
 introduced into the stomach, tlie gluten, albumen, &-c. 
 which it contains, is dissolved and extracted from it, 
 conveyed from the stomach into the blood, and by the 
 circulating blood cf|.rricd to tliose parts of the body 
 in which, owing to the natural waste, or to the de- 
 mands of animal growth, the muscles require to be 
 renewed or enlarged. The power of a vegetable sub- 
 stance, therefore, to increase or sustain the muscles 
 of an animal, depends materially on the quantity of 
 these protein compounds it contains — or on the quan- 
 tity of nitrogen by which that of the protein com- 
 pounds is indicated and measured. It must be of im- 
 portance, therefore, to know how much of these com- 
 pounds, or in other words, how much nitrogen different 
 vegetable productions usually contain — how far the 
 usual projwrtion is subject to variation — and how far 
 it is within the reach of human control. Such ques- 
 tions have obviously an intimate relation to the actual 
 money value of food in the rearing and nourishment 
 of animals; and a few illustrations will show how 
 chemistry has recently occupied itself in solving 
 them. 

It is the object of chemical research not merely to 
 explain known facts, but to remove misapprehensions 
 and correct erroneous opinions. The recent deter- 
 minations of the proportion of nitrogen contained in 
 wiieat have served both these purposes. Tims it was 
 asserted and believed, that the wheat of warm clim- 
 ates always contained more nitrogen, and consequent- 
 ly was more nutritive and of liighor money value, 
 than the wheat of our more temperate countries. — 
 But later researches have corrected this hasty deduc- 
 tion, and have placed our home wheat in its proper 
 position, economical and nutritive, as compared with 
 the wheat of India, of Southern Australia, or of the 
 Black sea. 

Again: the British miller usually requires a portion 
 of foreign wlicat to mingle with our native grain, both 
 to make it grind more easily, and to satisfy the bak- 
 er with a flour which will stand much water. The 
 pastry-cook, and the macaroni maker, also demand of
