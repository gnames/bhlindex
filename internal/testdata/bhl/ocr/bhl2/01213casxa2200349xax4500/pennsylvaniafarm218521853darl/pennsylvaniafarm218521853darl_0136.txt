him a flour which will make a peculiarly adhesive 
 dough. These several qualities were supposed to be 
 inherent only in wheat which abounded, in an un- 
 common degree, in gluten, and which was produced 
 under especially favorable conditions of soil and cli- 
 mate. Modern chemistry has the merit of gradually 
 removing these misapprehensions, and of directing us 
 to the true causes of all such differences. 

So in regard to the superior amount of muscle-for- 
 ming matter supposed to exis:in wheat in comparison 
 with other kinds of native grain, such as the oat. — 
 Experience had long taught the Scotch that oats, such 
 as they grow in their climate, are a most nutritious 
 food; but the habits of the more influential English, 
 and the ridicule of a prejudiced lexicographer, were 
 beginning to make them ashamed of their national 
 diet. Chemistry has here stepped in ; and by her an- 
 alysis of both, has proved not only that the oat is rich- 
 er in muscle-forming matter than the grain of wheat, 
 but that oatmeal is, in all respects, a better form of 
 nourishment than the finest wheaten flour. 

But what is more, chemistry has brought us acquain- 
 ted with the value of parts of the grain formerly con- 
 sidered almost as waste. The husk or bran of wheat, 
 for example, though given at times to pigs, to miller's 
 horses, and other cattle, was usually thought to pos- 
 sess but little nutritive virtue in itself. Analysis how- 
 ever, has shown it to be actually richer in muscular 
 matter than the white interior of the grain. Thus 
 the cause of its answering so well as food for cattle 
 is explained ; and it is shown that its use in bread 
 (whole-meal bread) must be no less nutritive than 
 economical. , 

The tru3 value of other kinds of food is also estab- 
 lished by thesa inquiries. Cabbage is a crop which, 
 up to the present time, has not been a general favor- 
 ite in this country, either in the stall or for the table, 
 except during early spring or summer. In North 
 Germany and Scandinavia, however, it appears to 
 have been long esteemed; and various modes of stor- 
 ing it for winter use have been very generally prac- 
 tised. Bui the cabbage is one of the plants which has 
 been chemically examined, in consequence of the 
 failure of the potato, with the view of introducing 
 it into general use ; and the result of the examination 
 is both interesting and unexpected. When dried so 
 as to bring it into a state in which it can be compared 
 with our other kinds of food, (wheat, oats, beans, &c.,) 
 it is found to be richer in muscular matter than any 
 other crop we grow. Wheat contains only about 12 
 per cent., and beans 25 per cent.; but dried cabbage 
 contains from 30 to 40 per cent, of the so-called pro- 
 tein compounds. According to our present views, 
 therefore, it is preeminently nourishing. Hence, if 
 it can but be made generally agreeable to the palate, 
 and easy of digestion, it is likely to prove the best 
 and easiest cultivated substitute for the potato; and 
 no doubt the Irish kolcannon (cabbage and potatoes 
 beat together) derives part of its reputation from the 
 great muscle-sustaining power of the cabbage — a 
 property in which the potato is most deficient. 

Further, it is of interest — of national importance, 
 we may say — that an acre of ordinary land will, ac- 
 cording to the above result, produce a greater weight 
 of tliis special kind of nourishment in the form of cab- 
 bage than in the form of any other crop. Thus, 20 
 tons of cabbage — and good land will produce in good 
 hands, 40 tons of drum-head cabbage on an imperial 
 acre — contain fifteen hundred pounds of muscular 
 matter; while twenty-five bushels of beans contain 

only four hundred pounds. The preference which 
 some farmers have long given to tliis crop, as food 
 for their stock and their milch cows, is accounted for 
 by these facts; while, of course, they powerfully rec- 
 omend its more general cultivation as food for man. 
 We may add, while speaking of cabbage, that it is 
 known to be so exhausthig to many soils, that wheat 
 will scarcely grow after an abundant crop of it. It 
 springs up indeed, but yields little straw, and early 
 runs to a puny ear, containing little grain. But the 
 same analysis which shows the value of the cabbage 
 crop, shows also what it takes from the soil ; and ex- 
 plains therefore the kind of exhaustion produced by it, 
 by what special applications this exhaustion is to be 
 repaired, and how repaired at the least cost. 

We shall take occasion to make more selections 
 from this excellent article; at the same time we com- 
 mend the above to the close attention of our readers, 
 believing that every one, whether farmer, mechanic, 
 or merchant, may be benefitted by a perusal of them. 

Currant Wine, 

Here Is a receipt for making currant wine, worth, 
 to any of our subscribers who have a bushel of currants, 
 at least two year's subscription to the Journal. "We 
 had an opportunity of tasting wine made after it, 
 which was of such excellent quality, that we could 
 not resist the temptation of publishing the receipt. — 
 Here it is ; try it and report the results : 

To one quart of ripe currant juice add three pounds 
 of the very best white sugar, (the finer the quality, 
 the better,) and to this add as much water as will, 
 with the juice and sugar, make a gallon. Put the 
 mixture into a keg or demijohn, leaving it open for 
 two weeks, or until the fermentation subsides ; then 
 cork it up tightly, and let it remain quiet for five 
 months, when it will be fit for use and may be racked 
 off into bottles. 

The Moyamensing Strawberry. — Through the 
 kindness of Mr. H. Dreer, seedsman, Chesnut street, 
 Philadelphia, we had the pleasure of partaking of 
 some of the new seedling strawberry — the Moya- 
 mensing. Those of which we partook, we thought 
 very superior, not only in size, but in flavor. We 
 understand that it is a prolific bearer, each healthy 
 plant throwing up five or six fruit stems. — 
 The demand for the fruit as well as the plants has 
 been large. Plants may be procured from H. Dreer, 
 seedsman and florist, Chesnut st. below Third, Phi- 
 ladelphia.
