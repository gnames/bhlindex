say a word in regard to the character of these, and 
 the volumes which are to succeed them. The merest 
 tyro in English literature is familiar -with the name 
 of Scott and should be with his writings. The pub- 
 lishers design issuing them in parts, semi-monthly,in 
 paper, at 50 cts. per volume, or twelve handsomely 
 bound volumes when the whole is completed, for 
 twelve dollars. The want of just such an edition as 
 this has long been felt. The unwieldy form in which 
 all the American editions of Scotts novels have been 
 presented to the public, has had the effect of deter- 
 ring many a reader from a perusal of ^them. The 
 present edition besides being a correct reprint of the 
 celebrated Abbottsford edition, is very handsomely 
 printed upon fine paper, with large, new and beauti- 
 tul type, and the volumes are of a size which ren- 
 ders them neat and convenient. In addition to which 
 they are published at a price, scarcely more than 
 one fourth that of the English Abbottsford edition.

The Philadelphia Florist. A friend has kindly 
 sent us the first number of this new candidate for fa- 
 vor with our Horticultural friends. A hasty glance 
 at its contents, induces us to think well of it, and we 
 do hope for the credit of Philadelphia — the home 
 of the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society — that the 
 enterprize will not only be sustained by liberal sub- 
 scription, but that the many able writers in Phila- 
 delphia and vicinity will give it the aid of their 
 pens. Terms $1 per annum. Address R. Robinson

WE are now manufacturinpr the LARGEST and BEST AS- 
 SORTMENT OF SEED PLANTERS ever offered to the public ; 
 several varieties of which we have constantly on hand. Tliose in- 
 terested are respectfully invited to call, examine and satisfy them- 
 selves of their merits. 

We have so improved and simplified our Drill, as to enable us to 
 Bell it at the following reduced rate's : 
 One with seven tuhes and wooden Seed Roller, quantity 

regulated by Screws, §80 00 

For each additional Tube, 7 50 

Seven Tubed do , iron Seed Rollers, regulated with screws 85 00 
 Each additional Tube, 10 00 

Seven Tubed do,Sinj;leHopper,and Patent Iron Seed Rollers, 
 which, by the movement of a single screw, is regulated 

to seed any desired quantity per acre, 85 00 

Each additional Tube, 10 00 

In addition to the foregoing, we are building a largo number of 
 Slide Drills, which have been sutisfactorily tested, and are war- 
 ranted deeidedly superior to any other Slide Drills in the market, 
 particularly in the even distribution of the Grain upon rough and 
 and hilly ground ; also, in the facility and precision by which it is 

regulated to sow any desired quantity per acre, as well as in the 
 lightness of draft, and general simplicily and durability. 
 For one of these Machines with seven Tubes, $i"0 00 

'• each additioml tube, 5 00 

The above Machines are Warranted not to Cut, Break, or Waste 
 Grain ; to be made of the best materials, in a substantial and work- 
 manlike maneer, and t.) do the work more perfectly than any other. 

They are not liable to choke with white caps or straw, and are 
 suited to rough and hilly, as well as smooth and level land. 

Owing to the peculiar form of our depositing tubes, they run 
 easier and free themselves from filth better than any others — 
 These Tubes are supplied with Reversible Steel Points, either end 
 of which can be extended as they become worn. The simultane- 
 ous throwing into and out of operation of theSeed distributing and 
 depositing apparatus, (which we have patented) renders onr rna- 
 chine capable of being managed with much more ease and certain- 
 ty, particularly in seeding point and other irregular lauds, than any 
 other Seed Planter. 

We also manufacture Horse-Powera and Threshers, Clover 
 HuUers, with and without Fans. Horse-Rakes, Corn-Shellers, &c- 
 Also, Steam lOigmes and Mill Work, Screw Cutting done to order ; 
 Castings of every description, of the best quality, furnrBhed at

MYERS' CHEMICAL ANIMAL MANURE. 

That of offering to the public a Manure which comprises all 
 that could be wished— its cheapness and surprising effects in pro- 
 ducnig larger crops in any kind of soil— is lasting and enduring 
 qualities. 

The subscriber offers this Manure to the public with a full knowl- 
 edge of its powerful effects upon ground where used. This Ma- 
 nure must take its precedence above all others ; its adaption to all 
 kinds of soil, and every particle of fertilizing properties being 
 preserved in the mode of manufacture, render it at once cheaper 
 than any other manareused for all kinds of crops. Its effects are 
 wonderful A supply alwavs on hand, WM. MYERS,

KEAD THE FOLLOWING CERTIFICATES. 

Germaktown, October 8, 1851. | 
 To Mr. Wm. Myers— Sir— Having tried your ( hemico-Animad 
 Manure upon potato ground, this season, I find it produce onethir 
 more and larger potatoes than the best horse manure . n the same 
 ground. ^VM. K. Cox. 

The following additional certificate just received, speaks for itself. 
 Woodbury, N. J , lOth mo. 20th, 1851. 
 I have used upward of 1000 bushels of Wm. Mteks' Anijial 
 Manure, on corn, potatoes, turnips, melons, and some other crops 
 during the present season, and am satisfied that it is an economical 
 and powerful manure, for turnips, radishes, and other root crops — 
 my experience has shown it to be especially valuable.

 Mr. Wm. Myers— Dear Sir— I manured with yonr Chemico-Aiii- 
 mal Manure about 38 acres of the poorest land on my farm, and pnt 
 half in Oats, and 11 e balance in Corn. Although it was got in 
 quite late, and the Season very unfavorable for the Corn crop gen- 
 erally, yet notwithstanding, I can say that it is decidedly the best 
 Corn I ever raised, although I have farmed for 20 years, and have 
 had good Corn land. and Manured well, as I thought, in'the old way. 
 While my neighbors' Corn was quitdyellow and leaves curled up 
 with the drought, mine was green and growing rapidly ; therefore, 
 I consider it one of the most valuable manures I ever used, and 
 shall take pleasure in recommending it to my neighborsand otheri. 
 Yours respectfully, E. M Seelt. 

AUSTRALIAN WHEAT. 

VERY SUPERIOR.— The berry of this grn in is extra large, and 
 makes the best of flour. It produces a greater average crop than 
 any other variety now grown in N. York. Several years experience 
 in its cultivation, proves that it is less liable to rust or mildew 
 than other kinds; and as the stalk is large and strong, it is also 
 less liable to blow down or lodge. Price, S4 per bushel. Other
