GREAT IMPROVEMENT in HYDRAULIC RAMS 

The subscriber, during the past six years of practical experience 
 in putting up Hydraulic Rams, has seen the necessity of some im- 
 provement, and would now most respeclfully say to the communi- 
 ty at large, that he has completed some very important Improve- 
 ments, which renders the Ram much mire durable— (there being 
 no friction or wearing of metals against metal in any part of the 
 machine) also less liable to breakage— such parts being made of 
 wrought iron as are liable to break, instead of cast iron as usual) 
 the method of regulating the quantity of water consumed is more 
 convenient, with greater nicetv and no possd)le danger of getting 
 at of order ; and another new feature is the enameting or coatirg

the inside surface of the Ram with glass, thereby preserving it 
 from rust, making it (wilh water-proof paint upon the outside) al- 
 most imperishable. These Rams are warranted to be more durable 
 than any others made in the United Stales, with<iut any excepticuis. 

Gatchel's D^mble Acting Rams, have become very valuable in 
 raising spring or well water, by means of a creek These Rams 
 with suitable Pipes will be put down, (and warranted for one year) 
 at the lowest possible price for cash. 

Gatchel's Rams will be put up (when preferred) as usual, by the 
 subscriber, who lias erected large numbers of them in various parts 
 of the country. 

As to the quantity of water elevated by the above ram, a chal- 
 lenge for imt less than One Hundred T)(>llars is still open, to any 
 or all of those persons who alledge that their rams will elevate a 
 greater amount or per cent of water. The truth is that a certain 
 per cent of water may be raised by the ram, according to known 
 'aws of mechanics and philosophy, and he who pretends to raise 
 more may be set down as an arrant humbug, and intending tode- 
 ceive the public. 

Farmers and others wanting Rams will subserve their interest 
 by examining the above Rams before purchasing elsewhere (one 
 may be seen in practical operation at the store at any time.) 

Pipes of a 1 kinds furnished, and c<mlracts for plumbing at the 
 lowest rates I'or Cash. A large variety of pumps, with pipes to suit, 
 always on hand. 

The subscriber would also call the attention of the public to an 
 article of Lightning Rod, constructed upon the principles laid 
 down by Professor Hare, Farady, Dr. Franklin, I-ardner, Arago, 
 W. Snow Harris, F. R. S , and other philosophers, who have writ- 
 ten on this subject. 

They are cheap, effective and highly approved of by all who see 
 them. Call and examine foi yourselves. A. C. BROWN,
