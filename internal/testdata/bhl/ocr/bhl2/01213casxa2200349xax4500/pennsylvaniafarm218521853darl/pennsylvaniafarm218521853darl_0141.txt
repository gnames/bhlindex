THE AGRICULTURAL DRILL ! 

-•1 Silve?- Medal awarded by the Maryland State Fair. 
 Patented November 20th., 1840. 

Description of tlie Eeecling apparatus. A, is one of a series of 
 Iron Rollers (ir pullies, fastened to an Iron Rod or Axil, which re- 
 volves with the wheel of the machine; fitting to a curved and 
 grooved casting B, attached to the bottom of the hopper, corres- 
 ponding with a bevelled opening in the latter, through which the 
 seed is admitted and carried forward by the roller. The quantity 
 Hdmitted is regu:ated by means of an Iron Rod along the entire 
 front of the hopper, to which all the sides are firmly attached and 
 kept in place by springs J. They are elevated or depressed by a 
 lever D. attached to said rod and opperates simultaneously on each 
 slide and groove. The lever D, is held in its position by means of 
 the catch I, having a series of teeth or notches. Tlie roller re- 
 ceives the seed m proportion to the size of the opening in the 
 groove, and retains it by means of a cap F, in front of each, and 
 conveys it to the tube G, through which it is discharged, termina- 
 ting in a cone K, which scatters it across the entire furrow made 
 hy the teeth or shanks H, in front, having a broad base of four or 
 more inches. 

The object of the invention is to secure an equal distribution of 
 seed in the drills either in ascending or descending liills; to regu- 
 ute the exact quantity sown per acre, to distribute and scatter the 

seed in the drill, from 4 to 5 inches in the ground, so that it will 
 be more perfect in its growth and yield more than if sown by 
 those in ordinary use j in fact, possessing many advaiitoges that 
 cannot fail upon examination to strike all, as llie accompanying 
 certificates from competent judges and practical farmers express 
 it, as the best machine of the kind in use. 

The broad shovels and cones oppcrate m like manner as by mak- 
 ing the fuirows with a hoe and sowing by the hand ; hence pecu- 
 liarly adapted for the i*outh in sowing Rice. By elevating the 
 cones the machine sows in a manner broad cast. 

We the undersigned, after using Mumma's Tatent improved 
 Seed Drill, beg leave to recommend it to the public as one of the 
 best, if not ihe very best machine for the purpose, [as expressed 
 above,] that is now in use.

PREMIUM;STRAWBERRY "MOYAMENSING." 

THIS new and very superb variety raised by G. Schmitz, Esq 

near Philadelphia, and to wliich a fjf.cial Premium was awarded 

by the Peiiii8>lvaiiia Horticultural Society, was purchased bv the 

subscriber, and is now after a fair trial of three years, for the first 

"time olVered to the public 

it possesses advaiitigcs over all others that 1 have a" yet seen, 
 or cultivated — is remarkable tor its robust and vigorou- growth — 
 perfectly hardy, enduring the extremes of heat and cold, is very 
 productive, producing a greater average of large berries from one 
 plant than any other and nearly equal in size to the '■ Hovey's 
 Seedling." Its great merit is its rich and high liavor, in which it 
 exeelfi all others — it is much better adapted for market,,(for which 
 purpose I am growins; extensively) as its fruit is not so easily in- 
 jured by carriage. Stro.ig Plants now ready for delivery at tf-2 per 
 .loz., or $12 per 1U0. JAMES M. TAGE,
