fruits, setting fences, posts, &c., are regulated entire-

 of postponing or hastening these various operations 
 of the farm in order that they may be performed in 
 what is termed the " right sign." On the other 
 hand ; if repeated experiments conclusivly show, 
 that an influence is exerted by the mcon in the vari- 
 ous directions attributed to her, it is well that those 
 who are skeptics should have their infidelity removed, 
 and avail themselves of the advantages which accrue 
 to those who study the " signs " and regulate their 
 various operations accordingly. — Ed.] 

Another Remedy for the Grain Weevil in Barns. 

Mr. Editor. — In looking over the July No. of the 
 Farm Journal, I noticed an inquiry from Mr. A. 
 Owen, of Huntingdon county. Pa., in regard to the 
 destruction of the wheat weevil. 

Although Mr. Owen is rather late in making an 
 inquiry to save the present crop, I shall, however, 
 give him my opinioa and experience in the destruc- 
 tion of that anoying foe. 

My barn for a number of years had been infested 
 with weevils, and having sustained like Mr. Owen's 
 neighbor, a consfderable loss from their ravages, I 
 determined to wage an exterminating warfare against 
 the enemy. To accomplish this, I tried different 
 remedies, but without effect. I finally concluded to 
 starve them as the dernier resort. Accordingly, two 
 years ago I stacked all my wheat and rye out, put 
 nothing into the barn but hay and oats, and the cure 
 was effectual ; for since tliat time, there is not a wee- 
 vil to be found. I would further state that before put- 
 ting the hay in the barn, it should be swept clean, in 
 order to disturb the weevils as much as possible. 

There are also other remedies recommended by 
 different writers, such as strewing portly branches 
 between the layers while mowing the grain, and 
 white-washing the inside of barns, or mixing lime 
 and salt in threshed grain, &c., but my own experi- 
 ence proves to me there is nothing like starving 
 them. Yours, &c. Samuel Ml'mma.

or winter. They will not feed on oats. They were 
 very annoying in my barn, and seeing it stated in an 
 agricultural paper, that by sprinkling salt on the 
 wheat as it was placed in the mow, it would prevent 
 them from eating it. I did so. It was however, 
 eaten, but not so -badly, I think, as if the salt had 
 not been put amongst it. However, they will feed 
 on it, and the nuisance was continued. I then adopt- 
 ed the plan of starvation, which was successful. 

There are various methods of preventing them 
 from eating it after it is threshed ; the best, I believe, 
 is to sprinkle dry slacked lime amongst it, as it is 
 placed in the garner. First sprinkle the bottom and 
 sides with it, then place a layer of wheat about six 
 inches in depth, then a sprinkling of lime, and so on. 
 Before using the wlieat it should be run through a 
 fan. A,

[It will be seen that two of our correspondents, in 
 reply to Mr. Owen's inquiry in our last, have advised 
 the same means for the extermination of tiie weevil 
 in barns. We present the views of both, as both are 
 gentlemen of intelligence and observation. The 
 ravages of the weevil are becoming so extensive of 
 late as to demand serious attention. The remedy 
 suggested by our correspondents is so simple tliat the 
 farmer wliose grain is destroyed in future, must 
 charge the loss to his own negligence. — Ed.] 

Another Remedy for the Grain Weevil. 

Mr. Editor. — Observing an inquiry in the last 
 Noi of your valuable " Journal," in respect to the 
 barn weevil ; — whether tliere is any means of des- 
 troying them ] I answer, there is. The only and 
 effectual way is, by starvation. If there is no wheat, 
 barley, corn, or other substance on which they can 
 feed, placed in the barn for one year, they will all 
 • perish. The wheat can be stacked, and threshed in 
 the winter, when the weevil becomes dormant and 
 is not able to feed. The loss by stacking is not so 
 great as the injury done by the weevil, if the grain 
 is put in at harvest, and permitted to remain till fall 

Culture of the Tomato. 

Mr. Editor : Although not desirous of being 
 classed Avith those, who in the languaj^e of your cor- 
 respondent, E. A. Stillmg, " appear desirous of see- 
 ing their names in print," I still feel inclined to ofTer 
 a word in reply to his natural mode of cultivating 
 the tomato. Strong and early as may be his love for 
 this excellent vegetable, I feel no ways inclined to 
 yield to him the supremacy in this particular ; my 
 fondness for them, dating back as many years as his 
 as well as my cultivation of them. Without, howev- 
 er, pretending to discuss these points, I propose mere- 
 ly to convince him that what he calls his natural 
 mode of cultivating the tomato, is a most unnatural 
 one. lie says, he grows his plants in a cold frame. 
 Now in what particular case has nature ever used 
 the cold frame, except that which the earth finishes 
 for propogating the tomato? Again, when too thick- 
 ly sown, he " thins them out." When nature sows 
 too thickly, she suffers the penalty of her indiscretion, 
 in the meagre character of her plants. In this par- 
 ticular, E. A. S. has improved somewhat upon the 
 good dame's plan, for which he is entirely entitled to 
 credit. Again, he sets his plants on the sunny side 
 of a tight board fence, dose to it, so that " the roots 
 penetrating to the cool most soil on the northern side 
 of the fence, take up the food necessary for the sus- 
 tenance of the plant readily and rapidly," a most ex-
