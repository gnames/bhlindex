Second Annual Exhibition of the Pennsylvania 
 State Agricultural Society. 

To the Farmers of Peuusylvania and the Neigh- 
 boring States 

The first Exhibition of the Pennsylvania State Ag- 
 ricultural Society afforded satisfactory evidence that 
 it is not difficult to develope the resources of our 
 State for so interesting an occasion. The exhibition 
 itself, the pleasure we derived from it, and its profit- 
 able effects, in the face of the doubts and fears which 
 always hang heavily upon new projects, were beyond 
 our reasonable expectations. Now we know what 
 can be done, and we propose to hold our Second An- 
 nual Exhibition at Lancaster, on Wednesday, Tliurs- 
 daii and Frklaij, the 20th, 21st, and 22d of October, 
 1852, to which we invite all persons everywhere who 
 feel an interest in the subject. We have made ar- 
 rangements for the most ample accommodations and 
 care of all animals, products and machinery which 
 shall be brought thero ; and we trust that every Farm- 
 er, Horticulturist, Manufacturer, Mechanic and In- 
 ventor, will partake with us, and c.">nsider himself as 
 one engaged in the work of making this Exhibition 
 as great, interesting and profitable as it is our design 
 it should be. 

Our Society especially desires to recognise the in- 
 fluence and power that mothers and daughters may 
 exert in promoting our object; and we therefore cor- 
 dially invite them to our meeting, and solicit the con- 
 tributions of their taste and industry to give beauty 
 and interest to our Exhibition.
