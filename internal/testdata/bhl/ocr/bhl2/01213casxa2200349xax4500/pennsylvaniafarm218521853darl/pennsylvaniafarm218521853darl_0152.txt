The Judges on Animals will have regard to the 

symn ctry, early maturity, size and general qualities 
 characteristic of the breeds which they judge. They 
 will make due allowance for age, feeding and othor 
 circumstances on the character and condition of the 
 animals. They will not give encouragement for 
 overfed animals. They will not award premiums for 
 Bulls, Cows, or Heifers, which shall appear to have 
 been fattened for the butcher; the object being to have 
 superior animals of this description for breeding. 

No person whatever will be allowed to interfere 
 with the Judges during their adjudications. 

The Judges on Stock, if not satisfied as to the reg- 
 ularity of the entries in their respective classes, will 
 apply to the Secretary for information ; and should 
 there be any doubt, after examination, of their com- 
 ing within the regulations, or if any animal is of such 
 a character as not to be entitled to exhibition in com- 
 petition, they will report the facts to the Executive 
 Committee, that such course may be adopted as the 
 case may require. 

The Judges will be expected m all cases, making 
 their reports, to give the reasons oftlieir decision, (es- 
 pecially in the case of animals) embracing the valu- 
 able and desirable qualities of the animals or articles 
 to which premiums are awarded. 

When anything is exhibited to the Judges, which 
 they shall deem meritorious, but beyond their power 
 to award a premium to, they will furnish a note of 
 the same to the Committee on Discretionary Premi- 
 ums, for their consideration and action. 

No animal or article can take more than one Pre" 
 mium. 

All productions placed in competition for premiums 
 must be the growth of the competitors. t 

When there is but one exhibitor, although he may 
 show several animals in a class or sub-division of a 
 class, only one premium will be awarded â€” that to be 
 the first or otherwise, as the merit of the animal or 
 article may be adjudged. And a premium loill not 
 he awarded when the animal or article is not worthy, 
 though there be no competition. 

THE ADDRESS. 
 The Annual Address will be delivered at 1 o'clock, 
 P. M., on Friday, the 22d of October, and immediate- 
 ly after the Address, the Reports of the Viewing

 ums awarded and distributed.

 imals entered for premiums, and grain will be provi-

 chase. 

PLOUGHING MATCH. 

The Ploughing Match will take place on Friday, 
 the22d, at 9 o'clock, A. M., in a field adjacent to the 
 place of Exhibition. 

B@==rrom the great liberality heretofore extended 
 by Railroad and Canal Companies upon occasions of 
 this kind, exhibitors may count upon having animals 
 and articles intended for exhibition, transported free 
 of cost; and visitors to the show will be able to pur- 
 chase tickets at greatly reduced rates. 

LIST OF PREMIUiMS. 

It will be observed that the Pennsylvania State 
 Agricultural Society have made the field of competi- 
 tion co-extensive with the United States. We, there- 
 fore, cordially invite the citizens of other States to 
 compete with us for our prizes. 

The Society will take great care in the selection of 
 their Judges, and they confidently hope that all who 
 shall be named will deem it a matter of duty to at- 
 tend. The names of the Judges will be announced 
 and published at least one month before the exhibi- 
 tion. 

Persons who desire to sell improved live-stock or 
 implements are requested to notify the Secretary 
 thereof in due time, that greater publicity may be 
 given thereto. The sales will be conducted under 
 the direction of the officers of the Society.
