Seedling Cherry. 

Mr. Editor : I send you a description of a cherry, 
 to which the name of " Conestoga" has been given, 
 which I deem quite an acquisition to our list of na- 
 tive fruits. It is of a large size, (nearly equal to 
 Black Tartarian,) very regular heart shaped ; color, 
 dark crimson ; stalk about an inch and a half long; 
 in a very even shallow cavity ; flesh soft, with a very 
 good flavor. It ripens about the 1st of July. The 
 tree is a very vigorous grower, and is a great and uni- 
 form bearer. 

The original tree stands in the middle of a large 
 field, in Conestoga township, on land now owned by 
 DavidBook, where it accidentally sprung up amongst 
 some briars and rubbish, some twenty or twenty-five 
 years ago.

Common Sense vs. Nonesense. â€” Dr. F. Tuthil de- 
 livered an address the other day before the Agricul- 
 tural Society of Suffolk county, New York, and in the 
 course of his remarks he touched upon " the false 
 shame of labor," in the following manner: 

" The day has already come in our cities that if a 
 man stout as Milo of old, has a load of wood brought 
 to his door, and he really aches for the pleasure of 
 handling it, yet must he hire a man to pitch it into 
 the cellar, while he stands idly by, not so much as 
 touch a stick of it on pain of losing caste. If a stout 
 and vigorous citizen, whose muscles swell with an 
 access of strength, has a load of wood lying on the 
 sidewalk, he may as well hang himself at once as be 
 foolish enough to save and saw it up himself ; yet if 
 the man has pitched it in, and the grate is down so 
 that he shall not be seen, we are not sure but he may 
 saw on till doomsday, and no one esteem him less a 
 gentleman. If he curry and tackle his own horse, or 
 lead him to the stable when he has done with him, 
 he is unpardonably vulgar. He would no sooner be 
 caught carrying a trunk the length of a block to an 
 omnibus than stealing a body from a grave yard; yet 
 he will boast among his friends of the enormous 
 weight he carries in the gymnasium, having paid a 
 fee of thirty dollars for the privilege. And his friends 
 applaud his gymnastic expenditures as wise and ex- 
 ceedingly judicious, for sure they say, " how can a 
 man live without exercise V In short, labor which 
 promotes the ends of economy is an abominable thing; 
 that which advertizes their imbecility is a source of 
 pride. These soft handed gentry may be our sons 
 and brothers, but we fancy they must at all times 
 be ashamed of our common father, old Adam who 
 farmed in Paradise." 

Anger may repast with you for an hour, but not 
 repose with you for a night.
