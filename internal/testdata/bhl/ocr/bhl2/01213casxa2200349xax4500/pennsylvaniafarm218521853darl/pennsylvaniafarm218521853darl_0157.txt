NEW LEICESTER LONG HORN BULLS. 

A great improver of the long-horns was Mr. Prin- 
 cep ofCroxal, in Derbyshire. He was supposed atthat 
 time to have the best dairy of long-horn cows in the 
 whole of the midland counties. He originally bred 
 them from a cow of the name of Bright, who was got 
 by Mr. Webster's Bloxodge, the fiither of the Canley 
 blood, and he much improved his breed through the 
 medium of Shakespeare. It was remarked, that 
 every cow and heifer of the Shakespeare blood could 
 be recognized at first sight as a descendant of his. 

Mr. Mashall thus describes the Loicesters in his 
 own time, which was that of Bakewell, Princep, and 
 Fowler. 

" The forend long ; but light to a degree of ele- 
 gance. The neck thin, the chap clean, the head fine, 
 but long and tapering. 

" The eye large, bright and prominent. 

" The horns vary with the sex, &c. Those of bulls 
 are comparatively short, from fifteen inches to two 
 feet ; those of the few oxen that have been reared of the 
 breed arc extremely large, being from two and a half 
 feet to three and a half feet long ; those of the cows 
 nearly as long, but much finer, tapering to delicately 
 fine points. Most of them hang downward by the 
 side of the cheeks, and then, if well turned, as many 
 of the cows are, shoot forward at the points. 

" The shoulders remarkablv fine and thin, in bone ; 
 but thickly covered with flesh â€” not the smalles pro- 
 tuberance of bone. 

" The girth small, compared with the short-horn 
 and middle-horn breeds. 

" The chine remarkably full when fat, but hollow 
 when in low condition." 

This is considered by accurate judges to be a cri- 
 terion of good mellow flesh. The large hard liga- 
 ments, (the continuation of the ligaments of the neck, 
 united with those of the vertebra) of the spine itself,) 
 which in some individurls, when in low condition, 
 stretch tightly along the chine, from tlie setting on of 
 the neck to the fore part of the loins, is said to be a 
 mark of the flesh being of a bad quality. They are 
 only proofs of great strength in the spine, and, prob- 

ably, in the animal generally ; and indicating that 
 the meat will be sinewy and tough. 

" The loin broad, and the hip remarkably wide and 
 protuberant." 

A wide loin, with projections of fat on the hips, 
 may be desiral)le : but there can be neither beauty 
 nor use in the protuberance of the tuberosities of the 
 bone. A full hip may be of advantage, but scarcely 
 a pi-otuberant one. 

" The quarters long and level ; the nache of a mid- 
 dle width, and the tail set on variously, even in indi- 
 viduals of the highest repute. 

" The round bones small, but the thighs in gener- 
 al fleshy ; tapering, however, when in the best form 
 toward the gambrols. 

"The legs small and clean, but comparatively 
 long. The feet in general neat, and of the middle 
 size. 

" The carcass as nearly a cylinder as the natural 
 form will allow. The ribs standing out full from the 
 spine. The belly small. 

" The flesh seldom fails of being of the first 
 quality. 

" The hide of a middle thickness. 

" The color various ; the brindle, the finch-back, 
 and the pye, are common. The lighter, the better 
 they are esteemed. 

"The fattening quality of this improved breed, in 
 a state of maturity, is indisputably' good. 

" As grazier's stock, thoy undoubtedly rank high. 
 The principle of the utility of form has been strictly 
 attended to. The bone and offal are small, and the 
 forend light; while the chine, the loin, the rump and 
 the ribs arc heavily loaded, and with flesh of the 
 finest quality. In point of early maturity, they have 
 also materially gained. In general, they gained a 
 year in preparation for the butcher ; and although 
 perhaps not weighing so heavy as they did before, 
 the diminution of weight is abuudantly compensated, 
 by the superior excellence of the meat, its earlier 
 readiness and the smallerquantity of food consumed. 

" As dairy stock, it does not admit of doubt that
