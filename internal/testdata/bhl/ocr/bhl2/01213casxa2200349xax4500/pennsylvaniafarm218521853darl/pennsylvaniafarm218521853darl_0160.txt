Marshfield farmer, Hon. Daniel Webster, as a dele- 
 gate to the Convention, which was received with 
 much applause. 

Mr. Ehvyn, of Pennsylvania, from the committee 
 appointed to prepare business for the Convention, and 
 report a constitution for the National Agricultural 
 Society, submitted a constitution, which was read, 
 and considered by sections. 

Some discussion ensued as to the time and place 
 where the Society shall hereafter meet, when an 
 amendment was adopted providing that the meetings 
 of the Society shall be held on the first Wednesday 
 in February, in the city of Washington, the Execu- 
 tive Committee, with the assent of the Society, to 
 have the power to call meetings elsewhere. 

The Convention having adopted the constitution, 
 then adjourned until seven o'clock in the evening. 

EVENING SESSION. 

The Convention, after a recess on Thursday, met 
 again at 7 o'clock. 

Mr. Holcomb from the committee on business, re- 
 ported a preamble and resolution, setting forth the 
 importance, &c., of fostering agriculture as a matter 
 oi national importance, and recommending that Con- 
 gress authorize the establishment of a " Department 
 of Agriculture." 

Judge Douglas, from the same committee, gave no- 
 tice of an intention to offer a substitute for ihe report. 

Ou motion, the committee on business was author- 
 ized to select officers for the organization of the 
 " United States Agricultural Society." 

The committee retired ; and during their absence 
 the roll of delegates was called, to allow an opportu- 
 nity of their signing the constitution of the society, 
 and paying the initiatory fee of two dollars ; which 
 was done by all present.

Corresponding Secretary. — Dr. D. Lee. 
 Recording Secretary. — Robert C. Walker. 
 Treasurer — Wm. Seldon. 
 The report was adopted. 

The report in favor of an Agricultural Department 
 was called up. 
 Ramsay McHenry, of Maryland, expressed doubts 

as to the Constitutional power of Congress to estab- 
 lish such department, and feared its being mingled 
 with the politics of the day, and as a farmer and 
 a friend of the interest he could nothing that could 
 likely produce such issue. 

Mr. Gentry suggested a different mode, by connect- 
 ing such a department with the Smithsonian Insti- 
 tute. 

Judge Douglass said he was ready to submit a 
 substitute for the report, carrying out rhe view just 
 suggested ; and spoke at length to the subject. 

Professor Henry, of the Smithsonian Institute, 
 begged gentlemen to pause, and not hastily to 
 take a step that might do injury to an institution 
 that is now just entering upon a gi'eat useful, and 
 flourishing plan of operations ; and went into an ex- 
 planation of the designs and present working of the 
 Institution. 

Judge Douglass briefly responded. 

The Convention then, at near eleven o'clock, ad- • 
 journed. 

[During the session a committee was^'appointed to 
 wait upon the President and Secretary of the State, 
 and ascertain when it would be convenient to receive 
 a visit from the Convention.] 

SECOND DAT. 

The Convention met yesterday morning at ten 
 o'clock. 

The subject of establishing a National Department 
 of Agriculture was resumed. 

Mr. Holcomb spoke at length on the subject. 

Mr. John A. King, of New York, offered a substi- 
 tute for the proposition under consideration, recom- 
 mending to Congress the establishment of an Agricul- 
 tural Bureau, upon whatever plan deemed most expe- 
 dient. He responded to some remarks by other 
 delegates, and especially in regard to the fears of a 
 political character, 

Mr. Calvert, of Maryland, spoke in favor of simply 
 memorializing Congress in aid of the promotion of 
 agriculture, as one of the great interests of the Gov- 
 ernment and the people. He cared not for or feared 
 not any political interpositions in regard to the mat- 
 ter ; and pressed the proposition as due to the agri- 
 cultural interests. 

Hon. Mr. Robinson, of Indiana,opposed all special 
 legislation, believing that all his people desire, is a 
 fair field, a clear sky, and an untrammelled commerce, 
 that they might buy where they can buy cheapest, 
 and sell where they can sell highest. 

Mr. Conger offered a new plan to promote agricul- 
 ture, to be presented to Congress. 

Hon. Mr. Bell, of Ohio, favored making agricul- 
 ture equal with other interests, receiving the con- 
 sideration cf Congress and the protection of Gov- 
 ernment. 

Judge Douglass responded to the remarks of Mr. 
 Holcomb, declaring the denunciations of various 
 measures engrossing the attention of Congress 
 rs " iniquitous and unjust," as uncalled for, out of 
 place, &c. 

Mr. Holcomb inquired if the gentleman intended 
 any thing personal by his remarks. 

Mr. Douglass said he should say nothing indi- 
 rectly to offend, but should personally and directly 
 prevent insult, either to himself or the Congress of 
 the nation. 

The reference of the gentleman to naturalization, 
 Native Americanism, ocean steamers, &c., was an 
 abuse of the privilege conferred upon any person sent 
 to this convention, and calculated, if not intended^
