VISIT TO THE PRESIDENT. 

The members of the Convention, in accordance 
 with arrangement, visited the President, when he 
 was addressed by the President of the Convention, 
 (M. P. Wilder,) as follows: 

ISlv. President: — We appear before you as the rep- 
 resentatives of the agricultural interests of the United 
 States — as the representatives of an employment up- 
 on which must ever depend, if we may trust the his- 
 tory of the past, not only the welfare and prosperity 
 of one art or profession, of one individual or nation, 
 but of the civilized world. 

We have been in Convention in this city, to consult 
 in relation to the advancement of this great interest. 
 We have established a United States Agricultural 
 Society, and a committee has been appointed to me- 
 morialize Congress for its promotion. 

Our deliberations are closed, and we are about to 

return to our respective homes. But, Mr. President, 
 we could not leave the seat of Government without 
 first paying our respects to you as Chief Magistrate 
 of our beloved Union, and of assuring you of our 
 profound respect for your private worth and distin- 
 guished character. 

To which President Fillmore responded as follows : 
 Mr. President: — Your kind remarks have taken 
 me by surprise, and I fear that I have no fitting 
 words to make a suitable ackowledgement. I am 
 most happy, however, to meet you and your friends 
 of the National Agricultural Society, and to welcome 
 you to the Executive mansion. I appreciate most 
 profoundly the importance of your association to the 
 agricultural interests of the country. I was myself 
 brought up on the farm. I know by experience the 
 labor and toil of a farmer's life. When a boy I have 
 followed the plough till I was so weary that I could 
 hardly walk to the house at night. I have swung 
 the scythe and handled the sickle all day; but am 
 happy to learn that these laborious occuy ations are 
 now much relieved by the invention of reaping and 
 mowing machines. 

But the farmer's life with all its toil affords a hap- 
 py independence that the. professional may well envy. 
 I am gratified to hear that you have formed a Nation- 
 al Association for the object of collecting and diffus- 
 ing information. In this way you will concentrate 
 your energies and extend your usefulness; and as 
 your occupation is the great foundation of the wealth 
 and prosperity of the country, everything calculated 
 to advance it should be hailed with delight and ap- 
 probation by every citizen of the Republic. Whether 
 in or out of ofBce, be assured that I shall always take 
 a deep interest in the prosperity of the agricultural 
 interests of the country. Without this our arts, man- 
 ufactures, and commerce must languish, but all may 
 be prosperous together. Hoping that your infant 
 society may prove a blessing to the country, I beg 
 leave to return you my grateful ackowlegements for 
 the kind and flattering manner in which you have 
 been pleased to speak of me personally, and of my 
 official conduct ; and shall be most happy to take the 
 several members of your society by the hand, and to 
 wish them a pleasant sojourn in our city, and a safe 
 return to their families. 

The delcgatos proceeded from the President's house
