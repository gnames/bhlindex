 and which caused a very fetid odour from putrefac- 
 tion having taken place. 

After removing the contents of the crop, I care- 
 fully washed it out and then sewed up the incis- 
 ion : this being done, I set the Cock upon his 
 feet, when he immediately strutted about and flapped 
 his wings, showing to those who stood by and wit- 
 nessed the operation, that he was relieved. It has 
 now been several days since the operation was per- 
 formed and the Cock appears to be doing finely, so 
 much so,thatI am satisfied that the operation has been 
 succesful; and that he will be a better Cock than he 
 was before, for the kind, which will be poor enough, 
 at least, in comparison to the celebrated Shanghaes 
 and Chittagongs. 

"With these few remarks permit me to hope that 
 some of your readers will give this subject their at- 
 tention and if possible extend the science.

[The surgical operation above recorded is not new ; 
 almost every experienced fowl breeder is familiar 
 with it. We, however, publish it for the benefit of 
 those who may not have been aware of the fact that 
 the life of a valuable fowl may sometimes be saved 
 by so simple a plan. We tried it once, but for want 
 of proper surgical skill, or some other cause, our pa- 
 tient died a few hours after the operation.] 

Shepherds— Sheep raising in Pennsylvania. 

Mr. Editor: — The cover of your Journal repre- 
 sents, very appropriately, a shepherd and his dog. — 
 Certainly one of the most important personages in 
 agricultural pursuits, as from him we trace the first 
 dawn of agriculture, thousands of years ago. He it is 
 who renders the mountains of Sootland, otherwise 
 unproductive, a source of wealth, — It is to him we 
 owe the fine cloth of Saxony, formerly a scarce ar- 
 ticle, and only produced in small quantity by the in- 
 dolent Spaniards. It is through him the little king- 
 dom of Saxony has tripled its agricultural wealth, 
 within the last fifty years. But where is such a per- 
 sonage to be found in Pennsylvania ? The branch of 
 the Allegheny mountains that stretches from the 
 Delaware to the Potomac, through Pennsylvania, a 
 great portion of which has been laid bare of its tim- 
 ber by fire, is situated in a far more genial climate 
 than the mountains of Scotland. What are they used 
 for ? To pasture a few lean cattle; 

One of your correspondents complains that he has 
 lost eleven hundred dollars by the destruction of 
 sheep by dogs. Such a complaint would make a 
 Saxon sheep breeder smile, when informed that these 
 sheep were suffered to run at large without being un- 
 der the care of a shepherd. 

From the time of the Patriarch Jacob to our own 
 days, it is presumed that sheep can only prosper un- 
 der the care of a shepherd. Every animal but the 
 sheep appear to know how to avoid danger. It is 
 one of the most helpless animals, and therefore from 
 time immemorial has been under the care of a shep- 
 herd. 

Twenty years ago, I visited and examined with 
 much care the sheep folds (Schafereg) in Saxony. I 
 saw the great profits the system pursued there gives 
 to the land owners, and it struck me very forcibly 
 that -ne had such an extensive and valuable sheep 
 walk in Pennsylvania on the Allegheny mountains 
 as would bo worth millions to the Saxon sheep breed- 
 er, but which is entirely unproductive to us. In 
 vain I have called on my city friends to invest some 
 capital jointly with me for the purpose of establish- 
 ing a sheepfold (Schafereg) on the Saxon system. — 
 AVhat advantage it would be to the cloth manufac- 
 turer, in the vicinity of Philadelphia, to have his 
 own flock of sheep brought to the same perfection as 
 the Saxon. There is nothing to hinder it. In a 
 few hours he could reach by railroad the foot of the 
 blue mountains, the seat for the sheepfold, being an 
 exhaustible sheep walk. He could there inspect his 
 flocks under the care of a Saxon shepherd — superin- 
 tend the washing and shearing of the sheep and have 
 the wool properly assorted. 

It is well known fact that one fleece contains four 
 different 4ualities of wool, and one of the most impor- 
 tant operations in wool growing is to properly sepa- 
 rate that part of the fleece which is required for the 
 superfine cloth. 

In England, sheep are raised principally to produce 
 good fat mutton. It is a well known fact that good 
 fat mutton and fine Merino wool cannot be raised 
 upon the same sheep's back. The manufacturers of 
 the fine cloth, in England, have therefore to depend 
 upon the imported Saxon wool. 

To enter into a more minute detail of my observa- 
 tions,wouId incumber the columns of your journal too 
 much. I will therefore close by remarking that, to 
 gentlemen who feel an interest in what I have pro- 
 posed, and will join me in an undertaking to develope 
 a source, in agriculture, now lefl unproductive, I will 
 give any information and enter in to farther particu- 
 lars by writing or personal meeting.

Comparative Dearing (Qualities of Old and Young 
 Crape Vines. 
 Mr. Editor : — I have made numerous observations 
 on the old and new grape vine, and am perfectly satisfi- 
 ed, in my own mind, that a vine of five or six years 
 old, having a proportionate thickness, will not bear 
 as fine and richly flavored grapes, as one of two or 
 three years growth. By close examination it will be
