would come into the minds of legislators and their 
 constituents, would be a magnificent idea of State 
 grandeur, a vast body of land, a host of professors, a 
 mine of expense, and a mass of impracticableness 
 that would sicken the wildest visionary, would follow 
 as the faithful successors of the first hasty impulse, 
 and the farmers of the State would turn up their eyes 
 in horror, or smile with contempt at such an over- 
 shadowing monument of folly and pretension, erected 
 out of their money, and suitable for the instruction 
 of their sons in the plain and unpretending duties 
 and principles of practical agriculture. 

I would respectfully, gentlemen, ask your opinion 
 and that of all who feel an interest in the progress 
 of agriculture, and of those who labor in it, and I 
 suggest that if the idea given above find favor, that 
 a body of delegates from different parts of the State 
 come together and consider the whole subject. I will 
 also take the liberty of proposing to the County Ag- 
 ricultural Societies, that this topic be brought before 
 them, and that a report be made of the opinions of 
 the members. A. L. Elwyn. 

In a conversation with the writer of the above, a 
 few days since, we gave our hearty assent to the pro- 
 position to establish a Farm School upon the princi- 
 ples laid down in his communication, believing it to 
 be the only feasible one, which has yet been present- 
 ed. Although several communications on the subject 
 of a State Agricultural College in Pennsylvania, have 
 from time to time appeared in our columns, we never 
 believed it possible to establish one, or if established, 
 to render it of any practical utility to the sons of our 
 farmers generally. Here is a plan however, in 
 which many of the objections to which a State Ag 
 ricultural College would be open, are avoided. 

The late hour at which the article was received, 
 and the crowded state of our columns prevents us 
 from giving our views in a more extended form at this 
 time. "We are requested by Dr. Elwyn to say, that not 
 being provided with a list of the County Societies 
 of the State, he is unable to open a correspondence 
 with them on the subject. He will be under obliga- 
 tions to the Secretaries of the various Societies 
 and if they will furnish him with their address 
 had views upon the subject of the School. 

The Horse Clifton. 

Mr. Editor: As your excellent publication, the 
 Farm Journal, is intended as a channel to bring to 
 the knowledge of the farmers such information as 
 may be useful to them, I have thought it would not 
 be unacceptable to them and possibly to other of 
 your contributors, to know something of the pedi- 
 gree of the beautiful jet black Horse Clifton, which 
 was exhibited at Harrisburg last fall, and which took 
 the premium for quick draught. As the improve- 
 ment of all stock is important to the farmer and the 

community at large, I hope you will find room for the 
 following : 

Ilis Grandsire was an imported horse, called Clif- 
 ton. He was kept in Delaware Co. Pennsylvania, 
 at $100 the Colt, and for a number of years was the 
 best horse on the turf. There are now but two horses 
 known to be kept for service out of this horse Clifton; 
 one of which is owned by Mr. Richard Kirkpatrick 
 at New Bloomfield, Perry county, and the other by 
 Mr. Samuel Huston, Silver Spring township, Cum- 
 berland CO. the one referred to as being exhibited 
 at the Pennsylvania State Agricultural Fair, and to 
 which was awarded the highest premium for quick 
 draft. (Several of his colts were at that time exhib- 
 ited by Mr. Huston, which were favorably noticed 
 by the proper Committee. One of these was there 
 sold by Mr. Huston at $200, and I have learned has 
 since found his way to Philadelphia and changed 
 owners at $275.) The Sire of this splendid horse, 
 Clifton, was taken to Westmoreland county, Vjy a Mr. 
 Dordendorf from whence he was brought to Cumber- 
 land county, by Mr. Samuel Huston, Senr., the fath- 
 er of Samuel Huston, the owner of the horse above 
 referred to. In his neighborhood he is considered 
 by good judges to be a most excellent horse.

Farmers Troubles—The Grub Worm. 

Mr. Editor : — Hoping that yourself, or some of 
 your intelligent correspondents, may be able to give 
 a Avord of advice in regard to the best manner of 
 destroying the large white worm, called " the grub 
 worm" here, which is becoming so destructive to 
 meadows and corn-fields in many places, and espe- 
 cially in this neighborhood, I am induced to ask the 
 publication of an inquiry for information on that 
 subject in the " Farm Journal." J. W. A.
