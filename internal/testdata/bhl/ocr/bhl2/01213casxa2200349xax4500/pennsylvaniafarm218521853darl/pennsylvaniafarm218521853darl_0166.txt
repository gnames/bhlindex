500 AGENTS WANTED. 

We are desirous of securing one or more competent 
 agents in every county in Pennsylvania, to canvass 
 for the Farm Journal. Our terms are liberal, and 
 we are assured by well-informed friends in every por 
 tion of the State, that competent and active agents 
 could not fail to succeed well. We therefore invit 
 persons desirous of taking agencies to address us 
 [postpaid] on the subject ; furnishing us with satis- 
 factory reference, and stating in what particular 
 county they are desirous of canvassing. 

AGENTS FOR THE JOURNAL, 

Wm. Domer, of Altoona, Blair County, is our au- 
 thorized agent for Blair and Centre Counties. 

A. E. Brady, Cumberland and Perry Counties. 
 S. Preston, Kennet Square, for Chester and Dela- 
 ware Counties. 
 Jonathan Dorwart, Lancaster County. 

We would again call the attention of good canvas- 
 sers, to the Farm Journal. To men of intelligence, 
 good address and business habits, it offers strong in- 
 ducements. We could refer to several of our agents 
 who have realized handsome profits from their ef- 
 forts ; and as the field is not yet half occupied, we 
 shall be glad to hear from any persons desirous of 
 acting in the capacity of travelling agents for us. — 
 Our terms are liberal. 

Site for the State Fair. — The site for the State 
 Fair has at length been selected. It lies North-East 
 of the City Reservoir, within a short distance of the 
 Philadelphia Turnpike. It is admirably adapted to 
 the purpose, being easy of access, within conveni- 
 ent distance of one of the finest springs of Lancaster 
 county — sufficiently elevated to command a view of 
 as fine a country as ever blessed the eyes of man, 
 and just far enough from the centre of the city to 
 make it a pleasant walk, or a short drive for visitors 
 and citizens. Preparation for the erection of fencing, 
 shedding, &c., are already making, and we are as- 
 sured that every attention will be paid to the comfort 
 and convenience of visitors and eshibitors, and 
 their stock and articles. 

Unpaid Subscriptions. 

There are a few subscriptions to the Farm Journal, 
 (both for the first and second volume) yet unpaid. — 
 In adverting to this fact, we do not desire to be con- 
 sidered in a dunning mood, but simply to remind 
 those in arrears, that such is the case ; feeling satis- 
 fied they will thank us for the hint. We presume it 
 is not necessary to inform our readers that our ex- 
 penses are not only heavy, but must be paid in casTi. 
 Every dollar due us, therefore, is needed, and we 
 hope that the hint above given will be received as 
 the promptings of actual necessity, and be replied to 
 accordingly. Send along your dollar, good friends. 
 It will be a small amount to each one of you, but the 
 aggregate is of much importance to us. 

Charges at the State Fair. 

A number of communications from warm friends 
 of the State Society have reached us, in which the 
 writers express the hope that the prices charged at 
 Hotels and boarding houses, and by Omnibus pro- 
 prietors, &c., will be reasonable ; in order that those 
 who visit the Exhibition may not go away dissatis- 
 fied. In reply to those communications we can only 
 say that so far as we have been enabled to learn, the 
 prices charged by our citizens will not be unreason- 
 able. This appears to be the clear understanding at 
 present, and we feel satisfied that the large majority 
 of the persons alluded to, are directly opposed to any 
 thing like imposition upon visitors. We doubt 
 whether there is a city in the Union where as good 
 accommodations can be obtained for the same money, 
 and for the sake of this well established reputation, 
 we hope and believe there will be no cause for com- 
 plaint. We will remark in addition, that extensive 
 arrangements for the comfort and convenience of 
 those who may attend the fair are already in pro- 
 gress, and that every thing will be done by the pro- 
 prietors of public houses as well as by private citi- 
 zens of Lancaster to make the stay of their visitors 
 pleasant and agreeable. 

Fair of the Allegheny Co. Society. 

The Annual exhibition will be held in Allegheny 
 city, some time during the month of September. We 
 do not know the precise time. It is our purpose to be 
 present on the occasion, if possible, in order that we 
 may inform our readers of what is doing by the far- 
 mers of the flourishing county of Allegheny. We 
 owe the Society a debt of gratitude for offering the 
 Farm Journal as a premium to competitors, and shall 

do every thing in our power to deserve the compli- 
 ment. We have many warm friends in Allegheny, 
 whom we hope to take by the hand in their own 
 homes, this fall. 

A Request. — Will not the Secretaries of the differ- 
 ent County Societies advise us of the time when their 
 respective exhibitions will be held? We should like 
 to be able to present the list to our readers in our 
 nest number.
