The Premium List of the State Society. 

We trust that the premium list of the State Agri- 
 cultural Society, which we publish entire in the pres- 
 ent number, will have the effect of awakening a more 
 enlarged and deeper seated feeling of interest on the 
 part of our farmers, mechanics, artisans and ladies, 
 than has hitherto manifested itself. By a reference 
 to the list it will be seen that the premiums offered 
 are very liberal, embracing almost every department 
 of business. This fact should not, we think, fail to 
 attract a large number of competitors, and conse- 
 quently, an immense crowd of visitors. The note of 
 preparation is sounding in every direction. Scarcely 
 a day passes in which we do not hear of some supe" 
 rior stock, new implement, elegant specimen of me- 
 chanical skill, or tasteful article of household manu- 
 fucture In preparation for the exhibition. This is 
 cheering, and leads us to believe confidently, that the 
 display and attendance will not only gratly exceed 
 that of last season at Harrisburg, but equal the great 
 fair of the New York State Society, at Rochester. — 
 This is, we know, anticipating much ; but it is only 
 what we have a right to expect from the farmers of 
 Pennsylvania, if they are possessed of that degree 
 of State pride they should. We are of a sanguine 
 temperament and perhaps, our earnest desire to be- 
 hold a fair display of the products of the " Keystone 
 State," in October next, gives birth to the thought 
 that we shall be gratified. But apart from every in- 
 dividual consideration, why should not the coming 
 exhibition at Lancaster, equal that of New York, or 
 Maryland ? If any person will furnish a single sat- 
 isfactory reason, why Pennsylvania with her well- 
 tilled acres, her skilful mechanics and tasteful house- 
 wives, should not rival any of her sister States, in an 
 exhibition of her industrial products, we will then 
 think that possibly, our judgment has erred. We 
 have all the resources requisite, and we are very cer- 
 tain that if every man and woman in the Common- 
 wealth felt as we do, and Jas all should, we shall 
 have such a display as has never yet been seen in the 
 United States. And pray why should not all possess 
 this feeling ? Is it not laudable ? Is it not calculated 
 to advance the great interests of society, by dissemi- 
 nating a more thorough knowledge of those princi- 
 ples upon which its comfort and happiness depend ? 
 It appears to us, that little argument is needed to 
 convince every one, of these facts, and yet there are 
 those who, if they do not positively condt;mn, give 
 such a lukewarm support, that the character of their 
 influence is difficult to determine. 

If such persons would but carefully estimate the 

importance of properly directed individual influence, 
 and permit themselves to become interested in the 
 successs of this great enterprise in behalf of agri- 
 culture, — if they would but satisfy themselves of the 
 fact that State Agricultural Exhibitions are not in- 
 dividual, but general in their character, and as such, 

designed to promote the interests and comfort of all ; 
 what a gratifying spectacle would the coming Exhi- 
 bition afford ! The doubts and fears of those who 
 have labored most perseveringly to promote this 
 great object would be at once removed. The Agri- 
 cultural character of our State would be improved 
 in every department, and as a consequence, wealth 
 would flow in upon us more rapidly and abundantly, 
 the comforts of life would be increased, and the hap- 
 py influences which always result from honest en- 
 deavors, would be exerted upon the whole commu- 
 nity. 

Let every one, therefore, feel that his interests are 
 involved in the success of the Exhibition, and feel- 
 ing thus, let him put forth an effort to produce this 
 success, either by contributing himself, or prevailing 
 upon his friends who have articles worthy of exhibi- 
 tion, to enter as competitors for the premiums. 

The following Memorial from the " Philadelphia 
 Society for promoting Agriculture " should be fol- 
 lowed up by others of similar character from every 
 Society in the State. It is only by a concentration 
 of effort, and unanimity of action, that the friends of 
 Agriculture can hope to succeed in securing the leg- 
 islative aid so long denied them. It is gratifying to 
 observe, that public opinion^is gradually, but steadi- 
 ly and certainly settling down to the conclusion that 
 something must be done for husbandry as well as for 
 other branches of human industry. The great num- 
 ber of County and State Agricultural Societies — the 
 immense attendance at, and the interest felt in agri- 
 cultural fairs and exhibitions all attest the growth 
 of this feeling and more recently still, the organiza- 
 tion of a National Agricultural Society composed of 
 many of the most distinguished men in the country, 
 cannot fail to have a powerful effect in producing the 
 desired results : 

To the Honorable the Senate ami the House of Repre- 
 sentatives of the United States. 

The memorial of the " PniLAOELrniA Societt for 
 Promoting Agricultuue," respectfully sets forth : — 
 That legislation is required for the benefit of agricul- 
 ture ; and the action of Congress in its behalf is 
 invited by the spirit of the age and enterprising cha- 
 racter of the country. Other governments have wise- 
 ly, and with the best results, lent their assistance to 
 the exertions of the industrious cultivators of the soil. 
 France has by such means added largely to her pros- 
 perity, and Belgium has become known as the best 
 cultivated country in Europe. The aid of government 
 may be afforded not by preference of particular inte- 
 rests or promotion of the views of favored classes — not 
 by systems of partial or temporary encouragement. 
 Olijects that are permanent and extensive may be 
 reached by the exercise of unquestionable powers. — 
 The general government can alone obtain the advan- 
 tages which are to be derived from foreign inter- 
 course. Improvement is often to be sought beyond 
 the limits of our own country. A mutual interchange 
 of knowledge of the fruits of investigation, and the 
 success of skill and experiment, can be rendered easy
