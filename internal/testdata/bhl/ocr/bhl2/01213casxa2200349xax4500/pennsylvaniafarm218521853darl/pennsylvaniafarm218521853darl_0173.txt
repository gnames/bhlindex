MANNY'S PATENT ADJUSTABLE HEAPING 
 AND MOWING MACHINES. 

Manufactured at Waddam''s Grove, Stephenson county, lUinots : ait 

for sale by John Young, Harrisburg; Wm. Brady, Mt. Joy; M. P. 

Dill, Shiremanstown, and David Cockley, Lancaster, Pa. 

Warranted to cut all kinds of Grain and Grass; also Flax, Millet, 

Corn in the field, and to gather Clover, Timothy and Flax Seed. 

This machine will cut from ten to fifteen acres per day, with two 
 horses, with one person to tend it when mowing and two persons 
 when reaping. The grain is left on one side, ingavels, for binding. 
 The grass is spread uniformly over the ground. By the use of a 
 double-edged sickle, the cutting apparatus is the most perfect — and 
 which is connected by means of a joint so as to adjust itself to un- 
 even ground, and by means of a lever at the driver's seat, it can be 
 raised and lowered instantly and easily when moving along, to cut 
 from one inch up to two feet from the ground. By a peculiar ar- 
 rangement of the wheels, all side draft aganist the team is entirely 
 avoided The construction of the machine is smiple, and by it ren- 
 dered convenient and durable. Price $135.00, half down, $130.00 
 all down. J.H.MANNY.

 If any one has either grain or grass, and wants to have it cut as 
 it ought to be, he will consult his own interest, by examining Man- 
 ny's Heaping and Mowing Machine. The simplicity of its con- 
 struction, with its absence of unnecessary friction, renders it supe- 
 rior to any other machine of the kind 1 have ever seen.

We, citizens of Belvidere and vicinity, Boone county, Illinois, 
 have minutely observed the operation of Manny's Reaper and Mow- 
 er. This machine we have seen at work in wheat that was badly 
 lodged, and with a very heavy growth of straw. The work was 
 done perfectly clean, aiid with ease, for two horses. The same 
 machine we have seen at work at mowing — it cuts the grass close 
 to the ground and smoothly. It works admirably in cutting clover, 
 and has demonstrated itself to our satisfaction, to be a complete 
 labor saving machine.

From an acquaintance with Manny's Reaping and Mowing Ma- 
 chine, and with other machines also with the scythe and cradle, 
 we, the undersigned, can truly say, to our best knowledge, Manny's 
 oaachiue is not only unsurpassed, but unequalled for reaping and 
 mowing; cutting grass close to the ground ; also reaping gram in 
 a complete manner, not leaving a single head standing, but leaving 
 it all in good shape and even gavels for binding.

Manny's Reaping and Mowins Machine — We witnessed last 
 week one of these Machines in operation, on the Farm of Mr. Fran- 
 cis Foley, near this village, and were well pleased with the man- 
 ner in which it performed. Though some 01 the grain was badly 
 lodged, the machine done its work with admirable despatch and 
 neatness — cutting the grain clean and leaving it in perfect gavels, 
 so as to cause no difficulty in binding. The advantages of this ma- 
 chine over all others heretofore iu use, consists in its perfect adap- 
 tation to uneven ground — the CMivenieiit manner of elevating and 
 depressing while moving along, cutting the grain at any height — 
 a most admirable method of obviating all side draught, and the 
 easy manner of changing from reaping to mowing^ all the change 
 necessary being merely to remove the platform on which the gram 
 falls. — Freeport Journal, August, 1851.

shovel, upon a floor or smooth surface, and if convenient, a little 
 good dry mould may be added, and well mixed before spreading. 

For Wheat or rye, one barrel per acre may be used before sow- 
 ding, and lightly harrowed in, and the other applied asa top dreig- 
 ing early in the spring, at the commencement of the first thaw. 

Upon Grass it should be sown broad-cast, and, if possible, when 
 the ground is wet, or when there is a probability of rain, to dis- 
 solve the fertilizing salts; generally late in the fall or early in the 
 spring, will be found to answer best' 

Upon Corn, it ^rould perhaps be advisable to apply one barrel in 
 the hill, and one broad-cast. 

If added to the manure or compost pile, the Fertilizer will doubt- 
 less increase greatly the efficacy of the mixture. 

The experience of agriculturists will probably suggest other 
 modes of employing it, us soon as they become satisfied of its utili- 
 ty. It should not, however, in any case, be mixed with quick-lime 
 which will cause a loss of Ammonia, nor should it be buried deep- 
 ly in the soil.

TO FARMERS— SALINE FERTILIZER. 

This preparation is designed to furnish the soil the various min- 
 eral or inorganic materials abrtracted from it by plants in the pro- 
 cess of vegetation. 

It coutains a large proportion of the salts of Potash, Soda and 
 Ammonia, combined with Bi-Phosphateof Lime, Animal Charcoal, 
 and other fertilizing matter ; the whole forming a highly concen- 
 trated manure. 

in thus offering a new article to the attention of farmers, the re- 
 lative value of which remains to be tested by experience, it is de- 
 sired not to venture upon any assertions respecting it, calculated to 
 excite expectations, which perhaps might not be realized; know- 
 ing, however, that the principal constituents of this compound 
 have been proved to be highly valuable separately, it is confidently 
 believed that their combination in proper proportions iu the "Sa- 
 line Fertilizer" will form an excellent manure. 
 DIRECTIONS FOR USE. 

The Fertilizer should be applied at the rate of two barrels to the 
 acre, and spread broad-cast on the surface. 

If, on opening the barrels, the salts shoald be found adhering to- 
 gether iu lumps, they should be broken, say with the back of ?.

I am now ready to receive orders and build Steam Engines from 
 3 to la horse power, portable or stationary, horizontal or perpendi- 
 cular. 1 shall build them in as a simple a style as possible, com- 
 bined with strength and sure of getting at every part, and adapted 
 for any purpose required. When an engine is required for raising 
 waterof any amount, 1 can adjust the pumps in a compact form 
 easily got at, and disconnected from the engine, when not required 
 for pumping. In many situations steam is the most profitable mode 
 of raising water, as the engine can be used for other purposes to 
 advantage. •

SHANGHAES! 

THE subscribers take this method of informing the citizens of 
 Lancaster and vicinity that they have on hand and for sale a

Since the first importation of these fowls from Shangha;. China, 
 they are becon.ing very generally known, paiticularly in the New 
 England States, and are eagerly sought after for their general pood 
 qualities, good laying properties and early maturity, which render
