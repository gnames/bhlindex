THE I.ATE A. J. DOWNING. 

It becomes our painful dutyto announce the death 
 of the distinguished American horticulturist, A, J. 
 Downing. In recording the sudden death of this no- 
 ble man, we are at a loss for words to express the 
 sorrow with which the sad event fills us. One who 
 knew him well has performed the sad duty for us. — 
 The following eloquent tribute to his memory we 
 copy from the " Home Journal." It is as truthful as 
 eloquent, and will be read with melancholy pleasure 
 by every one who can appreciate the worth of a man 
 who has done so much and so well for the beautiful 
 and useful. 

Poor Downing is dead. In the dreadful calamity 
 on the Hudson, which brought death to so many, and 
 sorrow to the hearts of thousands more, he, whose 
 name is associated with all that is fresh and beauti- 
 ful in nature — with the starting grass and fragrant 
 blossoms of spring-time — with the rustling leaves and 
 waving branches of summer — with the clustering 
 fruits and yellow harvest of autumn — perished from 
 the glad and beautiful earth ; how much more glad 
 and beautiful because of the life of him who has just 
 passed away. 

He who, as a prophet, inspired with the very geni- 
 us of Tlte Beautiful, taught us not only the eternal 
 principles of Taste, and thus enabled our judgments 
 to appreciate its true manifestations, but also infused 
 into our hearts a genuine love for ivhat is lovely — 
 giving to the eye a new light in the glancing of the 
 moon-lit water, and in the rainbow-hue of every dew- 
 drop of the morning — giving to the ear new music, 
 as well in the solemn rustling of the tempest-stricken 
 forest, as in the gentle murmuring of the zephyr 
 through our latticed bower ; he, who, by his teach- 
 ings, thus awakened in us a new life, and so brought 
 us more nearly into harmony with the great Author 
 and Architect of all, has gone out from among us. 

He who, as a wise and gentle brother, has "taken 
 sweet counsel" with us, in arranging the "surround- 
 ings" of our pleasant homes, in the position of every 
 group of trees and every flowering shrub that orna- 
 ments the lawn : he who kindly sat with us, and 

carefully "counted the cost" of our dwelling, planning 
 with singular combination of knowledge and taste, 
 the various conveniences and luxuries of life, showing 
 how far more necessary is a nice perception of fitness 
 and harmony to right enjoyment, than abundant 
 riches; he who has gilded the "refined gold" of the 
 wealthy, by working out into what has been express- 
 ively termed the "frozen music" of architecture, and 
 at the same time has "painted the lily" and thrown 
 "a perfume on the violet" for the poor and lowly, by 
 enlightening their minds and filling them with now 
 perceptions ; he, our master and our friend, suddenly 
 is "blotted from the things that be." 

And yet how little of such a man can die. To hi.s 
 family, to his immediate circle of intimate friends, 
 and those who met him in the daily daily walks of 
 life, it is indeed death, in all its dread reality. With 
 them, "each heart knowing his own bitterness," and 
 with their sorrow "the stranger intermeddleth not." 
 But to us, who chiefly knew him through his written 
 teachings, and have him still with us in the pages of 
 his "Landscape Gardening," "Cottage Residences," 
 and "Country Houses," in his "Fruits and Fruit 
 Trees," and "The Horticulturist" — to us, to the world, 
 to posterity, he still lives. 

AVe mourn for one who, in his department of knowl- 
 edge, stood confessedly above any other on this whole 
 continent — a man who came to us, not like most great 
 minds, too early to be appreciated or even recognized, 
 or too late to be useful, but who came and was wel- 
 comed just when the inhabitants of this western 
 world had laid down the woodman's axe, and were 
 anxiously waiting for lessons which should enable 
 them to advance from the stern and rigid principles 
 of mere ntilitt/, to the higher and more graceful pur- 
 suits of science and of art — from the rude cabin of 
 the settler, to the vinc-.-heltcrcd cottage or more lofty 
 dwelling of the artist and the scholar. This man, we 
 are told is dead ; but still he stands forth, for us, pre- 
 eminent as if yet among the living, patiently, as here- 
 tofore, in his written words, replying again and again 
 to our inquiry, How shall we make the earth more 
 beautilil, and humanity more pure? 

Philosophy has suggested that the impress of ob- 
 jects perceived by what we term siy/it, is constantly 
 repeated, projected, again and again, into space, trav- 
 elling with the rapidity of light, to be intercepted, 
 perchance, thousands of years hence, by the refined 
 senses of mortals even, translated to distant spheres; 
 so that nothing, whether it be a material atom, a 
 note of musii?, or the reflected image of a flower, 
 which has once been, can ever cease to be. The
