thought, however fanciful, is pleasing in connection 
 ■with the memory of one whose life has been success- 
 fully devoted to the creation of beauty all around. — 
 How these dagurreotypes may have filled all space, 
 and eternity itself, with his beautiful creations ! 

And now the trite question, usually so easily an- 
 swered, when one has gone who occupied a largo 
 space in the public mind, will be heard, " Who shall 
 fill his place ?" The answer to this inquiry has al- 
 ready been suggested: His place is already filled. — 
 The niche in Fame's Temple for him who should de- 
 velope a new world, in the pursuits of " Rural Life 
 and Rural Taste" in America, like that of a discover- 
 er of a continent, can contain but one statue. 

In early manhood he has fallen, but not, indeed, 
 before he had finished a life icork, and we who la- 
 ment what seems at first, his untimelif fate, should 
 remember that true life is not measured by vibrations 
 of the pendulum, and that " his life is long which 
 answers life's great end," whether it be drawn out to 
 three-score years and ten, or ended, like his, when 
 scarcely half those years had passed away. 

And now, what eulogy for the dead ? what monu- 
 ment to the memory of our friend departed ? This 
 work is also finished! Throughout the length and 
 breadth of our country, wherever the air is fragrant 
 with the perfume of cherished flowers, or murmurs 
 through cultivated groves and gardens, it breathes 
 the praises of him whose spirit, more than any other, 
 has refined the taste, and whose knowledge guided 
 the hand, of the cultivator, and the winds which 
 sweep over our forests — "those grand old woods" of 
 oak, and pine, and hemlock — already celebrate the 
 fome of him who boldly asserted their right to the 
 first rank in the world's catalogue of the majjestic 
 works of nature. His monument! Is it not already 
 on every hill-top and in every valley, in every town 
 and every village, where Gothic art expresses, with 
 its vertical lines, in lofty towers and pointed arches, 
 aspiring Hope and all-embracing Love — where the 
 encircling, overspreading, all-uniting dome of Roman 
 architecture, illustrates, in public halls and Capitols, 
 the sentiments of patriotism and unity? 

He has indeed "erected a monument more endur- 
 ing than brass." His memory ! Is it not already 
 beautifully enwtined with the vine that encircles the 
 stately columns on the banks of our noble rivers, or 
 hangs from the humble porch of the tree-sheltered 
 cottage? Who among us has built him a house, or 
 planted a vineyard, or reared a rare flower, uninflu- 
 enced by his taste? Who, in town or country, does 
 not cherish an abiding sentiment of gratitude and 
 love towards one whose life it was to refine and ele- 
 vate the hearts of men, turning them from_ gain and 
 worldliness to the appreciation of the beautiful in the 
 works of Him who has not in vain, for his creatures, 
 spread out the landscape, and made the woods vocal, 
 and the air fragrant? No; of all who have thus sud- 
 denly perished, 

""He Avill not float upon his watery bier 
 Unwept." 

With no design to sketch his every-day life, or 
 coldly to analyze his character as an author or an ar- 
 ist, but under the first impulse of the mingled feelings 
 of sadness, of affection, of bereavement, which must 
 find a wide sympathy throughout our country, as his 
 melancholy fate becomes known, this notice of our 
 departed friend has been written.

Farmers' sons had better learn to hold the plow 
 and feed the pigs, than to measure tape and count 
 buttons.

lu-and-Breeding of Fowls. 

Mr. Editor : — Having recently read an article in 
 the July No. of your valuable Journal, on the " im. 
 provement of the dunghill fowl," by E. Rogers, and 
 as it seems to involve the question of " in-and-in," 
 and " cross breeding," I wish to present a few 
 thoughts on the subject. 

It is admitted that many examples have occurred 
 which prove the good results of cross breeding. Prob- 
 ably the same will be granted of in-and-in breeding ; 
 But there is a notion prevalent that the latter tends, 
 after a time, to degeneracy. That relationship, per 
 se, produces degeneracy, is, I think, countenanced 
 neither by philosophy nor experiment. True, rela- 
 tions are apt to have the same characteristics, and if 
 these are similar in both parents, they are likely to 
 be transmitted more strongly marked to the progeny. 
 But this is true whether related by the laws of con- 
 sanguinity or not ; hence, it cannot be ascribed le- 
 gitimately to relationship. This law is in accordance 
 with the axiom that " like produces like ; " but that 
 mere blood relationship should tend to degeneracy, 
 is contrary to every established principle of phi- 
 losophy. 

But, says an objector, Mr. A. tried in-and-in 
 breeding and his stock degenerated ! Possibly, but 
 were there no causes for it but the relationship ? On 
 that mode of reasoning, cross-breeding is also perni- 
 cious, for numerous instances occur of degenerate 
 progeny from injudicious crossing. The proper quali- 
 fications for a successful breeder are very rare. A 
 thorough knowledge of the good and bad points of 
 animals, sound judgment, great care and experience 
 are indispensable requisites. 

If facts prove that in-and-in breeding tends to de- 
 generacy, they also prove the reverse. " In some of 
 the English flocks and herds, close in-and-in breed 
 ing has been practiced with the best results for near, 
 a century." 

I have a striking case in my own knowledge : the 
 Principal of this institute, J. Wilkinson, has a breed 
 of swine unrivalled perhaps in the whole country. 
 They have taken premiums at the principal fairs in 
 some 6 or 7 States, and always command the highest 
 prices. This breed he produced by crossing a Lie- 
 cester boar with a Berkshire sow, some 15 years since, 
 and by great care and judicious management he has 
 brought them to their present almost perfect state. 

If Mr. R. crossed his fowls with a better stock, 
 there is a reason for their improvement. But if the 
 stock he introduced was not better than the old, I 
 can not but regard it as a waste of time and money. 
 The same care and attention devoted to the improve- 
 ment of the old stock, if they were equally good with 
 the introduced one, would have produced the same 
 good results.
