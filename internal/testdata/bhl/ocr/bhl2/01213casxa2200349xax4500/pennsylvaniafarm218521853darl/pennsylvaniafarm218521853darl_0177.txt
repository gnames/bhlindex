He says " the oldest chicken in the flock was not 
 more than seven months." This is a sufficient rea- 
 son to account for their increased laying qualities, as 
 it is allowed by all, young hens lay better than old 
 ones. 

To prove the degeneracy of the dunghill fowls, he 
 contends " they were at one time equal in every res- 
 pect to those for which such enormous prices are now 
 asked." The plain English of this, is that all the 
 different breeds of fowls came from the same original 
 stock. If this be true, the diminutive Bantum and 
 the gigantic Chittagong are of the same origin. The 
 racst reliable authors on the subject, consider the 
 dunghill fowl either a cross from several native kinds 
 or a descendant of the Jungle fowl of India ; that the 
 small B&nkiva fowl is the type of the Bantum, and 
 the great fowl of St. Jago and Summatra that of the 
 larger breeds. 

If the dunghill fowl be a cross, we know nothing 
 of the size of the produced stock ; hence, Ave cannot 
 say it has degenerated. If, on the other hand, it be 
 a descendant of the Jungle fowl of India, it has im- 
 proved in size and laying qualities ; as the latter is 
 much smaller than the dunghill fowl, and it is well 
 known tame fowls are far better layers than wild 
 ones. I am surprised, however, that Mr. R. would 
 assert that farmer's fowls generally fare well and are 
 well provided for. 

How many farmers provide good shelter for their 
 fowls in winter, free from filth and vermin? In 
 probably a majority of cases they have no houses 
 that are devoted exclusively to poultry, but they are 
 allowed to creep into stables, pig-pens and cart-sheds, 
 or perhaps perch in the trees. 

If they happen to have what is called a " chicken- 
 house," the manure is allowed to accumulate until 
 it becomes so filthy and so full of vermin that no de- 
 cent fowl will enter it. They are seldom furnished 
 with sufi&cient food at proper periods. 

Young and old are alloAved to breed indiscriminate- 
 ly, without any regard to the immaturity of the one 
 or the decrepit state of the other. These and numer- 
 ous other like causes are sufficient to account for oc- 
 casional, or even frequent degeneracy. When the 
 proper care and attention were paid to them, I have 
 known stocks of chickens kept for many years which 
 retained their size and laying qualities undiminished. 
 It is said many animals in their primitive state 
 mate brother with sister, — (whether this be true with 
 the wild fowls is more than I can say) : — the instinct 
 given to the creature by an allwise Creator, could 
 hardly so far err as to lead it to pursue a course cal- 
 culated to produce a degeneracy of the species. If 
 Adam and Eve are progenitors of the human race, 
 tlieir descendents, to fulfil the divine commaad, " in- 
 crease and multiply," even obliged to risk the conse- 
 queni OS of that law, the results of which are " luna- 
 cy, idiocy and insanity." 

I know of a settlement not fifty miles from Lancas- 
 ter, composed of some half dozen families, all of 
 whom are related, and most of whom marry cousins, 
 and this has probably continued for several genera- 
 tions. But no symptoms are yet manifest of idiocy 
 or insanity. On the contrary, they are remarkably 
 intelligent, possessing strong, active minds and well 
 developed bodies. I have not briefly given the re- 
 sult of my investigation of this subject. I should be 
 glad to see the philosophy that will explain the cause 
 of degeneracy of in-and-in breeding. I consider 
 facts, where a variety of modifying causes are in- 
 volved, a most uncertain guide. Every system of 
 quackery and notable nostrum have thousands of 
 facts to attest their efficacy. L. II. Gause.

HovF to 3Ianage a Worn Out Farm. 

Mr. Editor : — About seven years since I took pos- 
 session of the farm on which I at present reside. At 
 that time its condition was anything else than prom- 
 ising, for in addition to the fact that weeds and briars 
 abounded — fence rows were in bad order, and the 
 buildings scarcely tenantable ; the land was to all 
 appearances thoroughly impoverished. Being a young 
 man, but newly mari-ied, most of my friends remon- 
 strated strongly against my taking the farm. Thiy 
 pointed out all the disadvantages attending the step, 
 and every one predicted that I would starve before 
 the farm would produce as much as my family and 
 cattle would consume. I must confess the picture 
 drawn by my dear friends was not the most encour- 
 aging, so that I began to have some misgivings my- 
 self, and concludod before I made a final determina- 
 tion, to hold a consultation with my wife, in whose 
 good sense and judgment I placed as much confidence 
 as in my own. Accordingly, one evening I broached 
 the subject to her, fairly and honestly setting forth 
 the advantages and disadvantages which would be 
 likely to follow. !Mrs. L. was a farmsr's daughter, 
 and a good farmer's daughter at that. She was one 
 of those young ladies, whose sense of duty always 
 led ber to estimate the useful more highly than the 
 ornamental. She was industrious and frugal, and 
 withal of a thoughtful and observant turn of mind. 
 The loss of her mother at an early age threw the 
 whole management of her father's large household 
 upon her. She improved the opportunity thus offer- 
 ed, or rather pressed upon her, not only by render, 
 in"- herself familiar with the domestic affairs of her 
 father's house, but also from the f;xct of frequent con- 
 versations ■nith him in relation to his farming opera- 
 tions, acquired a pretty good knowledge of the man- 
 ner in which he conducted them. She was therefore, 
 no bad counsellor ; but one whose opinion I prefer- 
 red infinitely to many of those friendly relations who 
 are always more liberal with their advice than their 
 money.
