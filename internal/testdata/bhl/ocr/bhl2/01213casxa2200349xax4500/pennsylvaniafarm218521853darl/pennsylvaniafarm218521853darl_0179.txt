have brought my farm from a state of almost barren- 
 ness, to what may be considered a fair degree of fer- 
 tility. I apply, it is true, all the manure I can make 
 { and I assure you it is not a little now, ) but do it in con- 
 nection with the clover, and the value of the system 
 may be estimated by the fact, that the average yield 
 per acre of corn for the last two years, has been six- 
 ty-five bushels, and of wheattwenty-five bushels, while 
 my other crops are equally good. If the same suc- 
 cess attends my efi"orts which has thus far followed 
 them, I shall in two years have my farm paid for, 
 and as a closing item I will mention, that the price 
 paid lor it was twenty-four dollars, and I have re- 
 fused seventy-five dollars an acre for it within the last 
 six months. G. L.

[We know the writer of the above, well, and testify 
 to the truth of all. Ilis farm, which contains a little 
 over one hundred acres, is rapidly becoming one of 
 the most desirable in the county. The example of 
 his wife is one that might be profitably followed by 
 thousands of farmers daughters. Her observation, 
 industry and tact were powerful aids to our young 
 friend in his struggle for a competency. If young 
 ladies would but properly estimate the advantages 
 which the economical housekeeper possesses over the 
 improvident one, we should perhaps find fewer fail- 
 ures in business, and a vast deal more of real happi- 
 ness in every community. Let it not be supposed 
 that because Mrs. L. is familiar with the practical du- 
 ties of the dairy and garden, and manages her house- 
 hold matters with so much neatness and profit, that 
 her accomplishments end here. Far from it. She 
 is just as agreeable in the parlor as she is handy in 
 the kitchen, and is what we justly consider a model 
 farmer's wife. — Ed.] 

Summer Treatment of Fruit Trees. 

Mr. Editor : — As usual, at this season, I have 
 lately witnessed and heard of so many acts of mal- 
 faisance committed against the particular objects of 
 my care and sympathy, (if you will pass this term 
 in the case,) that I feel constrained to take up my 
 rusted pen and, despite the heat and wearisomeness of 
 the seasop, endeavor to save some that might other- 
 wise become victims of a wretched fate. 

These ill-used friends of mine are "Fruit Trees." 
 Poor trees ! unable to resist or even to complain, yet 
 ever returning good for evil, they need and deserve 
 the intercessive voice of a friend. 

In their natural branchy dress, they don't look tidy 
 before eyes accustomed to the trim trees of the forest, 
 which have been choked out of their lower branches 
 by each other's shade, and so they must be lopped 
 of leaves and limbs, and that, generally, in the heat 
 of the dog-days ; because it is then that they are most 
 conspicuously and rebelliously growing. 

But this killing is all done in kindness. A lady 

friend engaged a man to dig a quarter in her garden. 
 He kindhj undertook to do more, to trim up some fine 
 young cherry and plum trees with handsome heads at 
 half standard height in their third year's growth, and 
 ready to bear in another season. The knife soon did 
 the work, and the vexation of the owner may be im- 
 agined at finding nothing left but a plume of leaves 
 at the summit of the central branch. The trees c n- 
 not recover in less than four years. 

A gentleman, who had planted an orchard four 
 years ago, told me lately, that although he gave his 
 trees the closest care, his neighbor's trees, planted the 
 same season, and receiving no attention, save that 
 they were protected from cattle, had exceeded his in 
 growth trebly, and were now strong, branchy, and 
 full of fruit. His kindest care — so it turned out — 
 had been to trim ofi" all leaves and shoots from the 
 stems as they appeared, in order "to strengthen the 
 top ;" this top, too, was formed at 8 feet from the 
 ground. It seemed strange that his neighbor's trees 
 naturally grew erect while he found it impossible to 
 keep his from lopping down or fretting on the stakes. 
 A friend planted out a suite of choice fruits last 
 spring. All the trees were growing well, many of 
 them, however, as is usual, having their strongest 
 shoots near the ground ; when a neighbor came along, 
 a man of years and wisdom, and strongly advised 
 that these should by all means be cut ofi" or the trees 
 " would not form a top." My friend yielded and suf- 
 fered his trees, while just handsomely struggling 
 Into vigorous life, to be deprived of half their vital 
 organs. 

All this is well-meant, but ignorantly done. I 
 don't know whether I can prove the fault in a para- 
 graph ; but I would urge those who wish well to their 
 trees to pursue the subject, by reference to some es- 
 pecial treatise. If one knows and sees clearly 7i#w 
 and whi/ and token to do a thing, it can be both easi- 
 and well-done ; but working blindly, one works loath- 
 ingly. In the case of fruit trees especially, th!s not 
 knowing how, keeps many from doing anything at all, 
 even from planting, — alas ! 

I remember once being invited to look at some trees 
 received from a great distance, great varieties andgreat 
 pets. I placed thumb and finger on the stem of one of 
 them while looking at it. and the owner hastened to 
 inform me that he had been told by the nursery-man 
 "not to touch tliem the first summer." "Butnot mean- 
 ing it in a literal sense," said I. "I don't know," he 
 answered, that is the direction I got, and I wish to 
 observe it closely. This was not very explicit instruc- 
 tion, and I am afraid I can be but little more so in 
 the faw more sentences that I can claim. 

A tree taken from the ground will soon evaporate 
 into a dry stick, if left exposed. But if the roots are 
 healthy and not injured by frost, and if they are bu- 
 ried in damp earth, they will imbibe moisture enough 
 to supply this evaporation (provided the stem iB
