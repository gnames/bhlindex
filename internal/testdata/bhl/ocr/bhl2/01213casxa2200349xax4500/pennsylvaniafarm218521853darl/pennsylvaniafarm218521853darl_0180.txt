[Septembeh, 

not inordinately long,) as we all know that water 
 does not run freely up hill. The first warmth of 
 spring causes the expansion of leaves, and as soon as 
 this occurs there is a rapid evaporation, proportionate 
 to the number and size of the leaves. To meet this 
 drain, new roots issue, and busily supply watery sap. 
 The quantity thus drawn from the earth and given off 
 from the leaves is immense. At this stage the roots 
 and leaves reciprocally increase each other — strong 
 roots collect much sap, requiring manij leaves to digest 
 it. While luxnriani leaves digest sap fast, and pour 
 downwards under the bulk a thick stream of prepar- 
 ed sap, which depositing wood-forming matter even 
 to the ends of the roots, elongates and increases 
 them. 

When we transplant a tree we necessarily cut off 
 the ends of the roots, and our first care must be to 
 re-establish them. Every leaf should be encouraged 
 during the first summer, for it will feed a root, and 
 the nearer the leaves to the roots, the more readily 
 will be the communication, and the more rapidly 
 will the root heal, therefrom and ramify. If we find 
 the sluggish sap unwilling to climb as high up the 
 dry pipes of the stem as we could wish, we can 
 shade the stem with straw and pinch off the ends 
 (no more) of the sprouts we would have checked. 
 We must have the roots in a good roomy bed of mold, 
 and retain moisture and suppress robbing weeds by a 
 thick and wide mulching. We shall then have a 
 strong set of roots, capable next season of supplying 
 sap to a naked stem 6 feet high, if necessity obliges 
 us to the disadvantage of making it so high. 

The second (August) growth of a young tree is 
 usually the best, if the culture is good. 

Newly planted trees then should be pruned in the 
 ensuing March just as the buds are expanding" Older 
 trees may be pruned at midsummer with advantage, 
 and over luxuriant trees should be pruned in August 
 or September when just about closing their growth. 
 Plum trees and dwarf pear trees, if too rank in growth, 
 are readily brought into bearing by root pruning at 
 this season, but other fruits have less vitality of root. 
 Hundreds of orchards have been unwittingly destroy- 
 ed by summer fallowing for a crop of winter grain, 

I must close this imperfectly, for want of room. 

The evergreen described by A. McL. W. is no 
 doubt the Taxus Canadensis, (American Yew or 
 Ground Hemlock,) and is well adapted to the pur- 
 poses he suggests . W. G. W. 

Has Modern Horticulture Improved Our Fruits t 

(querly for the new school.) 
 Mr. Editor : — I was much pleased with the re- 
 marks of Mr. Garber, in a former number of the 
 Journal in relation to the culture of fruit thirty 
 years since, as compared with that of the pres- 
 ent day. Although not a professed horticulturist, I 
 have devoted considerable attention to fruit trees for 

twenty years past, and my observation and experience 
 prove satisfactorily to my mind at least, that the 
 system of culture pursued at present has no ad- 
 vantages over that followed twenty years ago. We 
 have, it is true, a much greater variety of peaches, 
 apples, pears, &c., now, than then. But we have not 
 as thrifty trees, nor as certain crops of fruit. To 
 what cause this is to be attributed, I do not know 
 that I can furnish a satisfactory answer ; but it has 
 occurred to me that grafting and budding, while 
 they may serve to perpetuate particular varieties 
 with certainty, also, serve to lesson the longevity of 
 the trees. Twenty years ago, and as many years 
 further back as you please, but little was known of 
 these methods of producing a continuance of particu- 
 lar kinds of fruit. AVe never thought of cultivation 
 about our peach or apple trees. Our orchards were 
 not pruned as carefully and closely then as now ; 
 and yet we had what we considered heavy crops of 
 fair fruit, The man who would have foUuwed the 
 plan recommended by some of our most celebrated 
 horticulturists, would have been laughed at for his 
 pains, and jet I am seriously inclined to doubt 
 whether the old fashioned method was not the best 
 after all. To show the grounds of my belief, look at 
 the size and bearing qualities of what I shall term 
 the old fashioned peach tree. It never knew what 
 pruning was — its roots were never cut to pieces with 
 the spade or hoe,special manures were never applied nor 
 indeed any manure, and yet it went on rejoicing in its 
 strength, spreading its limbs wider from year to year, 
 until it stood a giant, compared with the sickly spe- 
 cimens of the present day. It seemed to say, "let me 
 alone," and in return for the forbearance to tamper 
 with its strength, yielded us annually a rich harvest 
 of fruit. Have the seasons changed — has the soil 
 lost its fruit tree producing qualities, or have modern 
 improvements turned out to be injurious instead of 
 useful ? 

I very much fear, Mr. Editor, that the beautifully 
 written essays on fruit culture which have from time 
 appeared, have done little actual good, but are pro- 
 ducing a vast deal of harm. It may be argued that 
 if our trees are not so long-lived, or our fruit crops so 
 abundant ; that these disadvantages are compensat- 
 ed for by the superior size of many varieties of 
 peaches, apples, &c., now grown. While the gener- 
 ality of people prefer a large apple to a small one, to 
 look at ; but few will not give the latter the preference 
 when called to taste. Excessive feeding will sometimes 
 produce fat upon the ribs of the veriest land-pike, 
 and the same system in horticulture may result in 
 fruit of increased size ; but who that has ever eat- 
 en the wild strawberry is able to detect the slightest 
 similarity in flavor between it and the overgrown 
 Hovey, the British Queen, or any other of the boasted 
 mammoth varieties. While the one is rich in the 
 peculiar aroma of the strawberry, the other is almost
