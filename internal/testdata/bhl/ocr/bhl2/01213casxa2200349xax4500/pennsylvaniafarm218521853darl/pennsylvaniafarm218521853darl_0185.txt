buried deeply in the earth, as puslane, which will 
 only germinate when near the surface, yet it will 
 preserve its vitality if buried deep for many years. 
 Black oats grew vigorously, after having laid deeply 
 buried in the soil in Scotland for half a century. See 
 Barton. I have known carrot, x>oppy and wliite mus- 
 tard seeds to lie many years in the ground. Some 
 seeds will only grow when immersed in water, as 
 several species of butter cup, water pepper, eel grass, 
 and all the sea weeds and n any others. 

Dr. Gray remarks : " Seed buried deep In the soil 
 being removed from the influence of air and light, 
 and subjected to the uniform temperature of the earth, 
 often preserve their vitality for many years, and are 
 ready to grow when brought near the surface. Thus) 
 when a waste field is cultivated, plants often spring- 
 up which have not been known to grow in that situ- 
 ation since the memory of man, and species for many 
 years lost to florists, occasionally spring up on the 
 sites of old botanic gardens." — Gray's Elements. 

The botanist is familiar with the sudden disappear- 
 ance of many plants, and perhaps after the lapse of 
 many years they will suddenly appear again as abun- 
 dant as ever. The (rera?'(?iaauriculatawasnot found at 
 West Chester from 181C to 1827. Flora Cestrica, p. 
 367. In 1835, the Platanthera obkulata was found 
 in a woods near West Chester, ior the first time, yet 
 the ground had been diligently explored by good hot' 
 anists for 20 years. Two years before, I was on the 
 ground every week during the summer, but never 
 saw a vestige of it. In 1843, the Viola hastata dis- 
 appeared from a locality that I know, and I have not 
 seen it there since. In 1842, the St. Johnswort fail- 
 ed to make its appearance in Pennsylvania, but in 
 1845 it suddenly appeared as abundant as ever. The 
 Silene nivece was lost to botanists in Pennsylvania for 
 many years, but I found it a few years since near 
 where Muhlenberg had found it. These facts admon- 
 ish us to receive the transmutation stories with great 
 caution. Some plants are confined to certain loca- 
 tions. The tree pink grows on the isle of Crete: the 
 Double Cocoa nut on the Isle of Praslin ; the thrift' 
 scurvey grasses and rose root In rocky and stony 
 . places upon the tops of the highest mountains, and 
 the shores of the ocean, yet not in any intermediate 
 places. The dodder is found among flax, the cancer 
 root under beach trees, and the parante have their 
 peculiar location and never appear any where else. — 
 The Geologist acquainted with botany can often de- 
 tect the formation of the buried strata by the plants 
 on the surface ! 

Cheat grows among wheat, rye, timothy and other 
 grasses, on all soils, I believe, and in all climates 
 where wheat will grow. Sometimes only under cer- 
 tain circumstances, at other times it Is found every 
 year. On a small spot on the Rev. J. B. Meeks' farm 
 it appears every year, — its usual locality Is with the 
 wheat or rye, and if two crops succeed each other, it 

has been known to get master of the wheat entirely 
 and take exclusive possession of the soil. It Is a most 
 prolific bearer and ripens from 5 to 10 days earlier 
 than wheat. The President of this society handed 
 me a root which produced eighty-two bearing stalks 
 on which we found above 1000 seeds; these on a second 
 crop would be sufficient to seed several rods suffi- 
 ciently thick to choke out all the wheat. 

In conclusion, I wish to impress one fact, and that 
 Is that the plant Is in the seed. The root gives the 
 first Indications of life. It takes a downward direc- 
 tion, the stem elongates and rises upward, and in due 
 time develops leaves. Thus the seed has in itself, in 
 an undeveloped state, all the essential organs of ve- 
 getation. The leaf is the expansion of the bud, and 
 all the appendages of the plant are but modified 
 forms of the bud. Contracted it Is the stamens, a 
 slight modification the pistils and a still more con- 
 tracted condition, the seed. From the bud alone 
 we can raise a perfect plant. As the subject of veg- 
 etable physiology is now understood, all the laws 
 which govern and control these changes and devel- 
 opments are plain, distinct, and Intelligible, but the 
 admission of the doctrine of '* degenerate transmuta- 
 tion " will destroy the whole, and a confusion will 
 exist that every stalk of wheat and cheat will refute, 
 when subjected to the scrutiny of scientific investi- 
 gation. J. M. M'MiNN.

Gapes ill Chickens, 

Mr. Editor : I observe that several of your cor- 
 respondents have suggested remedies for the gapes 
 in chickens, which are, no doubt, very good. I have 
 a remedy, however, which I am induced to prefer, 
 mainly because I have tried it so frequently and have 
 never known it to fail. It is this: I take one half a 
 teaspoonful of cordial, which I pour down the throat 
 of the suffering chick, when the mouth is opened 
 wide, so that a portion may be taken into the wind- 
 pipe. This causes more violent gasping or coughing 
 which dislodefcs the worm and relieves the chicken. 

I raise a great many chickens, and before I dis- 
 covered tliis remedy, lost a great many by the gapes, 
 but none since. Some of my neighbors recommend 
 grease or oil to be poured down the throat of the 
 chick instead of cordial, and it is said to operate with 

good effect sometimes. J. S.

[The remedy suggested by J. S. may be a very 
 good one, but can prove serviceable to our readers 
 only when he informs what kind of cordial he uses 
 for the purpose. — Ed.] 

For Young Cattle and Horses. — Mix occasionally 
 one part of salt with four parts of wood ashes, and 
 give the mixture to different kinds of stock, summer 
 and winter. It promotes their appetites and tends 
 to keep them In a healthy condition. It Is said to bo 
 good against botts in horses, murrain in cattle, and 
 rot in sheep.
