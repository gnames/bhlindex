society of which he was a member ; because that in- 
 fluence was ever exercised wisely and prudently, in 
 doing good. On an eminence, in a most romantic 
 situation, overlooking the fertile hills and rich mea- 
 dows, along the Brandywine, his mansion was situa- 
 ted, fronting to the east and south ; on this elevation, 
 his spirit seemed pure as the air he breathed ; his 
 mind appeared to expand with his expanded vievv,and 
 his spirit was bright as beams of morning sun. — 
 Friendly and hospitable, it was delightful to visit 
 there and share in the converse of himself and his 
 amiable and intelligent partner. Afier educating his 
 children with care, and seeing all of them happily 
 settled, and most of them near' him, Mr. and Mrs. 
 Price, impressed with its great importance, and ta- 
 king a parental and lively interest in the improvement 
 of the rising generation, accepted the situation of 
 Superintendents of West-Town School, where they 
 remained for several years. 

" At the age of 74, having spent a life of useful- 
 ness and virtuous enjoyment — for there never lived 
 a happier man — surrounded by children and friends, 
 amid the prayers and blessings of all who knew him, 
 the good man, like the sun in a mild summer evening, 
 full of Christian faith and Christian hope, lost to our 
 sight but not extinguished, sinks calmly and sweetly 
 to rest." 

Sulphur for Grapes. — Robert Sinclair, Jr., Esq., 
 writes us to say, that : 

" The flour of sulphui", dredged on grape vines, 
 will efi'ectually prevent mildew, and other diseases, 
 that the grape is liable to. The dredging should be 
 done when the dew is on, or after a light shower of 
 rain. I tested the above fully, and have annually 
 healthy vines, and good crops of grapes. The sulphur 
 is also an excellent, active manure. A dry, south- 
 east exposure is best for grapes ; soil deep, well ma- 
 nured with well decomposed manure, bones, fish, 
 oyster-shells, lime, &c." 

He thinks also that the disease might be as effectu- 
 ally prevented by oil of vitroil, (sulphuric acid,) say 
 the following proportions, sprinkled on the vines, viz : 
 t water, ^ acid. — Prairie Farmer. 

Colts. — The. breaking of a colt should commence 
 ■before he is twenty-four hours old. Handle him fre- 
 quently, make a pet of him. Bridle him young, and 
 the winter when he is two years old, place a wagon 
 saddle on his back, and buckle the girt loosely. Take 
 it off at night, and after doing this a few times, add 
 the breeching, and pursue this course with all parts 
 of the harness, until the whole is familiar with him. 
 Then add the whippletree, and while a careful per- 
 son leads him, hold back so that he may feel the 
 pressure of the collar or breastplate gradually. If 
 he is high spirited, so much the better — if you do not 
 heat him. Be resolute and firm with him, but not 
 abusive. 

Hollyhocks Coming on the Stage. — The Dahlia 
 is a superb flower, and is rendered more desirable 
 by its autumnal season. But its tender roots are a 

great drawback. Were it a hardy perennial, it 
 would far exceed in floral value even the Pseonia. — 
 Much attention has lately been directed to improve- 
 ments in the Hollyhock, which is likely so rival the 
 Dahlia, with addition of hardiness. Semi-spherical 
 flowers, exceedingly double, with closely imbricated 
 petals, with all the various shades of deep and light 
 rose, salmon, claret, deep crimson, brilliant red, pure 
 white, &c., &c , have been produced so closely packed 
 around the stem, that a green leaf can scarcely peep 
 between them, and some fine varieties have grown 
 nine feet high. A single English cultivator has an 
 acre of his nursery devoted to them, 6000 being in 
 splendid bloom at one time. — Ex. 

To Preserve Girdled Trees. — In the April num- 
 ber of ihc Farmer, page 129, J. H. L., of East Char- 
 lemont, Mass., inquires if any of your correspondents 
 know how to preserve trees that have been girdled. 
 Toll him to take out a block of wood extending into 
 the bark aljove and below the girdle, and take from 
 the body or limb of another tree a block correspond- 
 ing in size and shape, with the bark on, and adjust 
 it in the place, and bind it there, on the principle of 
 engrafting. I have recommended this plan before, 
 nnd it has proved completely successful. — C. Mooue, 
 Port Clinton, Michigan. — Genesee Farmer. 

DwAUF Apples. — The Genessee Farmer states, 
 that a Dwarf apple tree, seven years planted, and ten 
 years old, the tree not over three feet high, growing 
 on the grounds of Aaron Erickson of Rochester, pro- 
 duced a Fall Pippin sixteen inches in circumference 
 and weighing twenty-six ounces. Two or three oth- 
 ers were nearly as large. Apples grow ratlicr larger 
 on dwarfs than on standards. There is one interest- 
 ing question in connoxion with this subject, that we 
 would liked to have answered, viz : x\t what price 
 could such apples, thus grown on dwarfs, be afforded 
 ber bushel, as a general average for seasons and cul- 
 tivation and the cost of a crop per acre, and the com- 
 parative value with other apples in market. — Alb. 
 Cultivator. 

Pruning in Autumn. — The late S. W. Cole, 
 who strongly reccommendcd autumnal pruning for 
 fruit trees, says, " Thirty-two years ago, in Septem- 
 ber, we cut a very large branch from an apple trer, 
 on account of an injury by a gale. The tree was 
 old, and it hag never healed over, but it is now 
 sound, and almost as hard as liorn, and the tree per, 
 fectly hard around it. A few years before and afler, 
 large limbs were cut from the same tree in spring : 
 and where they were cut off the tree has rotted, so 
 that a quart measure may be put in the cavity" —
