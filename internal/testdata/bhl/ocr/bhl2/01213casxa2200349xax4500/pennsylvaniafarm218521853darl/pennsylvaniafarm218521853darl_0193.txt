Encouragement to Sheep Breeders. 

Mr. Editor : — Having noticed in your last No. the 
 long list of liberal premiums offered by the State So- 
 ciety, for cattle of almost every age and description, I 
 felt very much discouraged to see the few and lovr 
 ones offered for sheep. Now my opinion is that the 
 the most liberal inducements should be held out by 
 the Society, for the improvement of that kind of stock 
 which most needs improvement. I therefore most 
 respectfully suggest the propriety of holding out more 
 liberal inducements to the breeders of sheep. Will 
 not all the lovers of good mutton say so ? There is 
 no country that surpasses ours in the quality of its 
 beef. At the first Royal Agricultural meeting at Ox- 
 ford in 1839, I saw a bullock that was bred and fed 
 in our Green Mountain region, and which Avas de- 
 cidedly a better animal than any bullock exhibited 
 there. Now for a bull of this kind we are offered a 
 premium of $15, while for the best buck of any breed 
 we are offered only S6. Let any candid judge view 
 the condition of our stock market and decide which 
 of the breeds, cattle or sheep, needs improvement 
 most. 

The difference in the amount of premiums is one 
 of the grounds of my complaints, the number is 
 another. For cattle there are sixteen premiums of- 
 fered (exclusive of six, amounting to S46 for fat cat- 
 tle) while for sheep there are but six. Why not say 
 $10 for the best buck, (which is the premii'm offered for 
 any kind of bull,) $8 for the second best, and $6 for 
 the best yearling buck. 

My stock of Downs cost high prices, I paid John 
 EUman ?150 for one buck, and l?25 each for ewes, 
 and he now writes me that he has lately sold ewes at 
 public sale, as high as 12^ guineas, or §02 5Q each. 
 I generally dispose of my stock to those who exhibit 
 them, receive the premiums lor them, and for aught 
 I know to the contrary, the credit too. I should ve- 
 ry much like to see the system adopted, when fine ani- 
 mals are exhibited, of making known the names of the 
 breeders of them; and I believe every spirited breed- 
 er would join me in bringing about such a system. 
 I would further remark, that as the breeders of pure 
 Southdown sheep in the United States " are few and 
 far between," the interests of those few might 
 be advanced by bringing a portion of their stock to- 
 gether occasionally. 

I will now proceed with such a list of premiums 
 as I would approve, in addition to the three that I 
 have proposed. I would add for the best buck lamb, 
 $4, and so repeat the same for the ewes, for the best 
 $10, second best $S, yearlings $0, and lambs .?4, and 
 for the best wethers $5. Now I do not desire that 
 it should be thought that the sheep breeders are any 
 more needy than the breeders of any other kind of 
 stock ; but just view the difference. There are ? 110 

offered for each of the two first named breeds, and 
 $80 offered for the most inferior breeds ; while it may 
 be seen that the list that I propose for the best breed 
 of sheep only amounts to $01. I am a great admir- 
 er of good stock of any kind, and not long since was 
 induced to visit some of the best herds of shorthorns 
 in England, at which time I paid Thos. Bates $525 
 for a young bull ; but since that time experience has 
 somewhat changed my opinion of the practicability 
 of breeding cattle as a business, to advantage, and I 
 am now prepared to give it as my decided judgment, 
 that our State is much better adapted to the breeding 
 of sheep than of cattle, and that we mifjht and 
 should surpass most other States in that business, as 
 far as Ohio and Kentucky surpasses us in cattle. ^

[We regret that there should be any cause for com- 
 plaint in regard to the premium list. We have rea- 
 son to know that the Committee who prepared it, act- 
 ed entirely ivith reference to what they conceived the 
 best interests of all. If they erred in judgment, the 
 error was one of the head and not of the heart. — 
 Have patience friend Cope, and all will yet be right. 
 In a few years we shall understand these matters 
 better than now. — Ed. J 

M'orking Stallions. 

Mr. Editor :— It is I think, a well established fact 
 that American horses, instead of improving in char- 
 acter, are rather degenerating. This is certainly a 
 source of deep regret to every lover of that noble 
 animal, and the cause of the degeneracy becomes an 
 object of inquir3% Without pretending to enumer- 
 ate the many defects which characterize our general 
 system of breeding horses, permit me to call atten- 
 tion to a single fact which I cannot but think exer- 
 cises a detrimental influence. I allude to tlie prac- 
 tice of keeping stallions in idleness during the great- 
 er part of the year, in order that they may appear 
 lively and spirited at the conmienccment of the sea- 
 son for mares. Reasoning from analogy, I cannot 
 but think that if stallions designed for service, were 
 kept at work during the whole of the year except 
 during the time when their services were needed, for 
 mares ; that wo should have stronger and better 
 hoi-scs than we now have. An idle man's offspring 
 is rarely so healthy and vigorous as the offspring of 
 the man who labors industriously day by day. Why 
 should not the same results follow idleness in the 
 horse. They do. In the selection of a stallion, next 
 in importance to good ancestry and faultless form, is 
 well developed muscular action. — This action should 
 be the result not merely of the groom's daily triflin"- 
 exercise, but of steady moderate labor, continued as 
 in other horses, from the time when he recovers from 
 the effects of his spring service, to the time when he 
 shall again^^be wanted for similar purposes. If good 
 parentage and form are desirable in a horse, certain
