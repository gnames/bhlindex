Unpaid Subscriptions. — A number of our sub- 
 scribers who were in arrears have complied with the 
 request expressed in our last, for which they have 
 our thanks. There are still a few left from whom we 
 shall be happy to hear. 

JS@^"\Ve have been compelled to omit several edi- 
 torial articles as well as communications in the pres- 
 ent number. They will appear in our next. 

To Correspondents — A request. — Persons send- 
 ing in communications will please send their names 
 with them. We have at this time several articles on 
 tile without signatures, which will appear so soon 
 as the names of the writers are forwarded. We pre- 
 fer that correspondents should write over their own 
 names,but when this is not desirb.e, we of course will 
 comply with their wishes; but we must know the 
 name of the writer, if the articles are to appear in 
 tlie Journal. 

Membership in the State Society. — For the in- 
 formation of such persons in Lancaster county, as 
 may feel desirous of becoming members of the State 
 Society, we state that Geo, II. Bucher, Esq., of 
 llogestown, Cumberland county, is the Treasurer, 
 and the person to whom application for membership 
 should be made. Jacob Frantz, Esq., of Paradise, 
 Lancaster county, is the Vice President for this Dis- 
 trict and as such is duly authorized to receive the fee 
 of membership. All that is required on the part of 
 applicants, is the payment of one dollar in advance, 
 with the name of the applicant and his Post Office. 

The Eagle Plow.— Messrs. Savery & Co. of Phila. 
 have sent us one of their No. 3 Eagle Plows, the val- 
 ue of which we have as yet had no opportunity of 
 testing. This plow is one the most graceful (if we 
 are allowed the term) implements we have ever seen, 
 and but for the fact that it is a 9-/;77;^-hand plow, 
 could scarcely fail to become a general favorite. A 
 full description of the implement is now on our files, 
 but has been unavoidably crowded out. We will 
 put it in our next.

Mr. Gowen's Defence. — In another part of this 
 month's Journal will be found the reply of Mr. Gow- 
 cn to some strictures by the late Editor of the " Hor- 
 ticulturist," on the subject of turning in green crops 
 as a manure. The position taken by Mr. G. in his 
 address before the Lancaster County Agricultural 
 Society, last winter in relation to green cropping, has 
 been the subject of a number of communications in 
 the Farm Journal, in all of which opposite grounds 
 are taken. In the article which we have copied, '"l^it 
 will be seen that Mr. G. contends that a fair and im- 
 partial reading of his address will not warrant the 
 inference that he is opposed to green cropping under 
 all circumstances. In justice, therefore, to his views, 
 we cheerfully give the article itself, as well as the 
 remarks of the Editor of the " Horticulturist," a 
 place. 

Meeting of the Executive Committee. — The Ex- 
 ecutive Committee of the State Agricultural Society 
 met at Lancaster, on the 19th inst., for the purpose 
 of examining the site selected for the Exhibition. — 
 The Committee was unanimous in its expression in 
 regard to the admirable adaptedness of the ground. 
 After consulting with the Committee of Managers of 
 the Lancaster Co. Society, in regard to the arrange- 
 ments of the enclosure, and appointing the following 
 Committees, the board adjourned: 

Messrs. David W. Patterson, Benjamin Eshleman, 
 John Miller, Jacob B. Gauffer, of Lancaster county, 
 a Committee on behalf of said Society, to confer with 
 a Committee of the Lancaster County Agricultural 
 Society in making the necessary arrangements for 
 the State Fair. Messrs. James Evans, Jacob Frantz, 
 Christian B. Herr, Lightner Sharp and Joseph Ko- 
 nigmacher are the last-named Committee. 

Sale of Valuable Real Estate. — If any of our 
 readers wish to purchase superior property, we ad- 
 vise them to take a look at the superior farms offered 
 for sale by Messrs. J. & C. S. Haldeman in this 
 months Journal. They are most desirable properties, 
 and as such worthy the attention of capitalists and 
 others.
