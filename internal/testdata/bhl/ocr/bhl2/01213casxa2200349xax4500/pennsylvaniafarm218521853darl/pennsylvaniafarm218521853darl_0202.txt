THE GREAT STOVE WAREHOUSE. 

Persons in want 
 of Stoves of any 
 description can 
 be accommoda- 
 ted by calling at 
 the establish- 
 ment of the sub- 
 scriber, North 
 Queen st., Lan- 
 caster, Pa. 

Having great- 
 ly enlarged his 
 Warehouse, and 
 having also en- 
 tered into an arrangement with the celebrated 
 Stove IManufacturers of Troy, Albany, New York, 
 Philadelphia, and Lancaster, he is prepared to 
 sell Stoves for the Parlor, Kitchen, JBar-room, or 
 Store, at Manufachirers prices. 

He also begs leave to state that he is the sole 
 Agent in Lancaster for the Celebrated Globe Stove, 
 and would caution the public against the imitations 
 of this celebrated Stove, now in the Lancaster mar- 
 ket. As they are unquestionably the best Cooking 
 Stove in use, it is important that 'those who are look- 
 ■.ng for such an article should know that the only place 
 where the genuine one can be had is at his establish- 
 ment. He is able to reler to more than fifty respec- 
 table families in Lancaster co., where there Stoves 
 are now in daily use. Wherever they have been tried, 
 they have superseded all others.

TO FARMERS— SALINE FERTILIZER. 

Til is preparation is designed to furnish the soil the various min- 
 eral or inorganic materials abstracted from it by plants in the pro- 
 cess of vegetation. 

It contanis a large proportion of the salts of Potash, Soda and 
 Ammonia, combined with Bil'hosphateof Lime, Animal Charcoal, 
 and other fertilizing matter ; the whole forming a highly concen- 
 trated manure 

In thus offering a new article to the attention of farmers, the re- 
 lative value of which remains to be tested by experience, it is de- 
 sired not to venture upon any assertions respecting it, calculated to 
 excite expectations, which perhaps might not be realized; know- 
 ing, however, that the prnicipal constituents of this compound 
 have been proved to be highly valuable separately, it is confidently 
 believed that their combination in proper proportions in the "Sa- 
 line Fertilizer" will form an excellent manure. 
 DiRECTIONS FOR USE. 

The Fertilizer should be applied at the rate of two barrels to the 
 acre, and spread broad-cast on the surface. 

If, on opening the barrels, the salts shoald be found adhering to- 
 gether in lumps, they should be broken, say with the back of "\ 
 shovel, upon a floor or smooth surface, and if convenient, a little 
 good dry mould may be added, and well mixed before spreading. 

For Wheat or rye, one barrel per acre may be used before sow- 
 rfing, and lightly harrowed in, and the other applied as a top dress- 
 ing earlv in the spring, at the commencement of the first thaw. 

Upon Grass it should be sown broad-cast, and, if possible, when 
 the ground is wet, or when there is a probability of rain, to dis- 
 solve the fertilizing salts; generally late in the fall or early in the 
 spring, will be found to answer best- 

Upon Corn, it .vould perhaps be advisable to apply one barrel in 
 the hill, and one broad-ctst. 

If added to the manure or compost pile, the Fertilizer will doubt- 
 less increase greatly the efficacy of the mixture. 

The experience of agriculturists will probably suggest other 
 modes of employing it, as soon as they become satisfied of its utili- 
 ty. It should not, however, in any case, be mixed with quick-lime 
 which will cause a loss of Ammonia, nor should it bebuned deep- 
 ly in the soil. 

f:W Price, $2 .50 per barrel.

I am now ready to receive orders and build Steam Engines from 
 3 to 13 horse power, portable or stationary, horizontal or perpendi- 
 cular. 1 shall build them mas a simple a style as possible, com- 
 bined ■with strength and sure of getting at every part, and adapted 
 for any purpose required. When an engine is required for raising 
 water of any amount, I can adjust the pumps in a compact form 
 easily got at, and disconnected from the engine, when not required 
 for pumping. In many situations steam is the most profitable mode 
 of raising water, as the engine can be used for other purposes to 
 advantage. 

Also prepared to receive orders or give information upon Lathes, 
 Plainers, Presses, Shafting, Pullies, and machinist tools in general, 
 from the firm of Messrs O. Snow k. Co., Meriden, Conn.
