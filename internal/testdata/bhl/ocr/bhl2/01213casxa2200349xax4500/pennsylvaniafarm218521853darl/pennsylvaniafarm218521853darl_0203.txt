CHAPPELL'S IMPROVED FERTILIZER— Substitute for Guano. 

The subscriber would cull tlie atteiilioii of llie Farmers of Feiui- 
 sylvania to the cheiiacal compound or manure, inauufactured by 
 him for the renovation of " worn-out lands," and Icjiown as 
 "chappel's improved fertilizer. " 

This article is composed ol the same materials as arc found by 
 analysis in the ash of plants. It consists of a mixture (in proper 
 proportions) of B'-Phoyphote of Lime and Mngnes.ia, (or bones dis- 
 solved in Sulphuric Acid,} Sulphalts of Ammonia, Potash, Soda 
 andLimii, Animal Charcoal, Silicates of Potash, Alumina and Mag-- 
 nesia, and, as these constituents indicate, is intended to restore to 
 the soil all the inorganic materials abstracted by vegetation. It 
 has been ascertained tliat a soil containing a sullicieiit quantity of 
 Uies J Salts, is always fertile ; and their absence constitutes what 
 is called " Worn-out Land." The analysis of rich soils shows a 
 good supply, and poor land a deficiency. 

The inorganic matter abstracted from the soil by the growth of 
 diftereiit crops is the same, varying only in proportion ; it is there- 
 fore evident, that if we supply to the soil a suliicient quantity of 
 each material thus abstracted, we restote its fertility. 

The correctness of the above has been fully sustained by the use 
 of the J<er<i7i2er, the last season. It has been used on poor land, 
 and twenty-five to twenty eight bushels of wheat obtained, with 
 a superior crop of clover. As a top-dressing on wheat, eight bush- 
 els additional yield has been realized. On the spring crops of corn, 
 oats and clover, the yield has been doubled. It has been used on 
 the same field (as an experiment) with the best Peruvian Guano, 
 both on corn and oats, and the yield has resulted in favor of the 
 Fertilizer. The most respectable reference can be given of its 
 value and effects on poor lauds. 

This article having been used with such favorable results, the 
 manufacturer now otters it to agriculturists, with the full confi- 
 dence that it will largely repay for the outlay, and that it is the 
 cheapest manure they can use. 

On very poor land, two barrels to the acre should be applied f on 
 that in better condition, one and a half barrels. It is calculated, in 
 using two barrels, you supply to tlie soil sufficient salts for a rota- 
 tion. As a top-dressing, one barrel put on after a rain, or when the 
 land is wet, and in all cases near the surface and not ploughed in, 
 broad-cast and harrowed when practicable. The Ammonia in this 
 preparation is a Sulphate and therefore not volatile as in Guano ; 
 the Bi-Phosphates and Sulphates being soluble, the rain dissolves 
 them, and they thus saturate the soil with prepared food, ready ft)r 
 the nourishment of the plant; being rich in Sulpliates, they are 
 powerful absorbents of Ammonia from the atmosphere. 

One fact peculiar to this compound is that such portion as may 
 not be abstracted from the soil the first crop, remains in theground 
 until consumed by after vegetation One barrel of Chappell's Im- 
 proved Fertilizer contains as 7nuch Phosphate of Lime a.a is contain- 
 ed in 3U0 lbs. Peruvian Gvano; therefore, by the application of two 
 barrels (400 lbs ) to an acre, the ground is supplied with as much 
 phosphate of lime as if 400 lbs. best Peruvian Guano had been used, 
 and the P'ertilizer is furnished at lees than half the cost. 

We add a few certificates. We could add others, but this mode 
 of advertising is expensive — these should be sufficient to recommend 
 the Fertilizer to the favorable notice of all farmers, desiring to 
 improve their lands. 

The following from gentlemen of high standing, testifies to the 
 action of the Fertilizer, compared with Peruvian and Patagoiiian 
 Guano. (From Com. T. Ap. C. Junes, Washington.)

P. Stockton Chappell — Dear Sir : — I suppose I am indebted to 
 your kindness for a copy of the Baltimore Sun, of 17th March, 
 containing notice of transfer of " South Baltimore Chemical 
 Works" to you. I should have sooner acknowledged your atten- 
 tion, but was anxious to see a further development of the efJects 
 of your Fertilizer before I wrote. You may recollect that about 
 a year ago 1 purchased the first Fertilizer, (a ton) with whicli 1 
 experimented with barley and corn, at tlie time of planting, and on 
 wheat and grass as a top-dressing, all in eompai ison with Peruvian 
 and Patagoiiian Guano, at equal cost. The effect on the barley 
 was decidedly in favor of the Fertilizer beyond all question ; while 
 upon wheat, corn and grass, the dilference was scarcely discerna- 
 ble on the growing Cfops. The ground on which the barley grew 
 last year was seeded with Florence wheat on tlie .3d dav of Octo- 
 ber, 1851; the ground was in the finest heart, 200 lbs. of Peruvian 
 guona having been ploughed in after fallowing, but before seed- 
 ing, which was done with Pennock's drill. The last dressing of 
 guano was carefully sown broadcast transversely to the sjiriiig 
 dressing of guano, and to the belt of the Fertilizer, through the 
 barley, which separated the Peruvian and Patagoiiian guano, and 
 the course of the drill crosses obliquely the belt of about sixty feet 
 on which the Fertilizer was used about a year ago. 

My wheat, like most wheat of the season, is but middling ; my 
 land was ploughed very deep, and, although it is high and rolling, 
 the wheat hag suffered severely from a redundancy of moisture; 
 nevertheless, the wheat on the part on which the Fertilizer was 
 used at the time of sowing the barley, in April, 1851, is not only 
 higher but ."Stronger, has a better color, and is in everv respect more 
 promising than the wheat on either side of it. notwftlistinding the 
 double dressing of guano to one of the Fertilizer. I have also ten 
 acres of corn ground in ^vheat. on which your Fertilizer was used 
 and sown in comparison with Peruvian guano aud repeated at the 
 time of sowing the wheat; the Fertilizer so far liolils its own, and 
 should I live to see it, I will give yonparticulars of the harvest 

The conclusions to which my mind is brought by the foregoing 
 experiments are; — 

First — Tliatat an equal cost, loith less labor, and far greater con- 
 venience in Its application, your Fertilizer is fully equal to the 
 average quality of Peruvuui guano when first applied, and much 
 more durable in its eti'ects on after crojis. 

Secondly — Thut slk hundred pounds (two barrels) of the Fertili- 
 zer, incorporated with the soil with the harrow belore seeding or 
 planting, is better than :)00 pounds of Peruvian guano, to wli ch 
 the fanner is compelled to add, wilh very considerable labor, one 
 and a half bushels gypsum, the cost of which will bring theguaiio, 
 at the lowest rates, to ij;?.OI»

 P. S. Chappell — Dear Sir:— In answer to your note of this date 
 asking for my experience in the use of your Fertilizer, i have but 
 time to say, that two or three years ago 1 used but two or tliree 
 barrels by way of experiment. Last year, I used upwards of sev- 
 enty, and this year 1 will drop it on every hill of corn that I plant. 
 My experience (jf its use on corn, in the hill, is most unquestiona- 
 bly and decidedly favorable. Very resfiectfully. yours, ,Vc

To Dr. PS. Chappell— Dent Bit: I have just returned from a 
 visit to Delaware, where I liad an opportunity of observing the ef- 
 fects of your Agricultural Salts, in the production of wlieat. They 
 were applied to two fields — one of twenty acres — the other of 
 twenty-eight. Tlie former is uniformly good — on the latter, a part 
 has been dainagi d by the growth of blue grass, but my impression 
 is, the crop, on both, will be one-third greater than it would have 
 been without the fertilizing article. The gram has imt yet been 
 threshed out, and consequently the above opinion rests merely on 
 general observation of the crop immediately before harvest, but I 
 am satisfied it will not be found incorrect 1 think it very eerlain 
 you will have several orders for the Salts, from the vicinity re- 
 ferred to. Very respectfully, 

Your friend and oli't serv't. 

HENRY V. D. JOHNS. 

Dr. Johns purchased, last fall, thirty barrels ; as he used it as 
 above on lorty-nine acres, not more than 1;^ barrels could have 
 been applied to the acre. 

I have used " Chappell's Fertilizer" upon potatoes with decided 
 benefit, and am now fully satisfied that it is the best and clieapest 
 manure 1 can use for that crop 

iMy first trial was alongside of stable and guano manure; the 
 Salts gave ine the best and largest potatoes. Wliere the Salts was 
 used, the land wiis thin, and on a lull side ; I used about 1' bbls. 
 to the acre in tlie furrow, with the usual attention. My crop fully 
 came up to my expectations; the potatoes were large, and of su- 
 perior quality, and the crop fully one-third greater than any of my 
 neighbors, whose land was much richer than the piece oflaiid I 
 used for my p(,latoes. The same piece of land I liave put down 

in wheat ; the I'urrows can be seen distinctly some distance off 

showing that the Fertilizer is still acting in the soil. 

I shall use the Fertilizer this year on my potatoes, being fully 
 satisfied that it is the chi'apest and best manure that I can use fur 
 that crop. Several of my neighbors intend using the Fertilizer 
 this year. I have paid great attention to the cultivation of potatoes 
 for the Baltimore market t"or many years, and I'roin my experience 
 of two seasons with the Fertilizer, can leconimend it with confi- 
 dence upon that crop 

I will add that I sold my potatoes at SI,06 per bushel ; my 
 neighbors sold at 9iic — the difference in price owing to the differ- 
 ence in quality. Yours truly, Laekin Youkg.

Chester Cou.xty, Pa., May 2.';, IS52 

On the 20lh of August, 1850, I applied i:;o lbs. of your Fertilizer 
 on a fourth of an acre of poor laiiil, that had not been farmed for 
 forty years previous to the application of the Fertilizer. I had the 
 ground ploughed in April and strewed over it 10 bushels of lime, 
 and about the same of ashes, and chip dirt from wood yard, har- 
 rowed It well wilh cultivator, and when I put on the Salts I sowed 
 in Turnip Seed. Timothy and Clover and finislied off with a brush. 
 The crops of Turnips was 70 bushels, that at 2.') cents brought 
 Sn,.^, and at the rate of S70 per acre. Last summer (1851) the 
 crop of good liay was 1,100 lbs., or at the rate of 2J tons per acre, 
 and now (May, IS^'i) the appearance of the grass on the same is 
 far better than it was last year. Many persnns.have been to see 
 this small, though satisfactory experiment, and are becoming con- 
 vinced of the benefits of your Fertilizer.
