THE PEACH TREE BORER. 

JSgeria exitosa— -Female. 

This insect belongs to a destructive family of Lepi- 
 dopterous diurnia, and for many years has been known 
 as the common enemy of the peach, and hence has re- 
 ceived the appellation of " Peach Tree Borer." Al- 
 though its destructive character maybe fully known to 
 all peach growers, yet the insect itself when fully 
 matured may not be so generally known. 

The above illustration represents the female borer, 
 and is the only one to which that name can be strict- 
 ly applied ; (the male, I presume, never approaches 
 the peach tree again alter emerging from the chry- 
 salis. It was described by Thomas Say, years ago, 
 in the Journal of Natural Sciences, of Philadelphia, 
 and again, with colored figure, in his American En- 
 tomology. Dr. Harris has also given a history and 
 description of it in the fifth volume of the New Eng- 
 land Farmer, and in his Treatise on Insects injuri- 
 ous to vegetation, page 233. 

The body of a specimen in my collection is three- 
 fourths of an inch in length, and the wings, if proper- 
 ly extended, would reach one inch and three-ei!,rhths. 
 I have also another specimen, not so large. The co- 
 lor is a steel blue, v/ith a broad orange-colored belt 
 around the middle of the abdomen. The front wings 
 are opaque, and the hind ones transparent with a tol- 
 erably broad opaque margin. The antennjB are three- 
 eighths of an inch in length and slightly curved at 
 the ends. 

The male differs from the female in having all the 
 wings transparent, with an opaque bar running across 
 the front pair, about an eighth of an inch from the 
 end ; the body more slender and cylindrical, and ter- 
 minated by a prominent tuft or brush of hair ; and oth- 
 er minor differences not important here to mention. 
 I do not know precisely the period the female depo- 
 sits her eggs, — without a doubt sometime during the 
 summer. Dr. Harris says its transformations take 
 place from June to October, consequently the foun- 
 dations for new colonies are laid at different times 
 within those periods. On one occasion,! found the ma- 
 ture insect in tolerable abundance upon the blossoms 
 of buckwheat in common with wasps and other Hy- 
 menopterous insects, for which I at first mistook it, 

and which it somewhat resembles, especially the 
 male. 

We cannot, however, be much in error, as to the 
 seat of their destructive operations upon the peach 
 tree ; their presence being generally indicated by a 
 flow of gum from the parts affected. Their attacks 
 seem to be most injurious when made in the main 
 trunk of the tree near the roots. I have seen large num- 
 bers of whitish grub? of different sizes, varying from 
 half an inch to an inch or more in length, early in 
 the spring, cut out of the butt of a peach tree, ex- 
 tending down into the larger roots, amongst masses 
 of gum and gnawed wood, and penetrating in some 
 places half an inch into the woody part of the tree. 
 These, I feel persuaded, wore the larvse of the peach 
 tree borer, the eggs of which had been deposited at 
 different times the previous season ; although I 
 made no particular examination of them at the 
 time. Although this would seem to indicate that 
 " there are several broods produced by successive 
 hatches, yet, there is but one rotation of metamorph- 
 oses consummated within the year."* Borers of all 
 sizes may, therefore, be found at any season of the 
 year, more or less advanced. That they should pass 
 one winter before they appear in the perfect or wing- 
 ed state, seems however, to be necessary. 

Various remedies have been tried and recommend- 
 ed for the destruction of the grub of the borer ; by 
 removing the earth from the base of the tree and af- 
 ter cutting and scraping all that can be possibly got 
 out, to fill the cavity around the tree with tan, lime, 
 ashes, or strong decoctions of tobacco ; but all these 
 remedies seem to be more or less injurious to the 
 tree itself. I have more confidence in the plan of 
 Dr. Harris, recommended by him as early as the year 
 1826, which is here submitted, especially as I have 

■" I have now (Sept. 20,) under observation two 
 grubs or larva of the peach tree borer. One is full 
 half an inch in length, and the other is a scant quar- 
 ter inch. The body is divided into thirteen segments: 
 upon the first, second and third of which are three 
 pairs of legs ; the fourtli and fifth are without legs ; 
 the sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth have each a pair 
 of prologs, surmounted by two rows of small hooks 
 turned inward ; the tenth and eleventh segments are 
 also without legs, but the terminal one has a pair of 
 prolegs armed as those aforenamed. The head is 
 large and retractile, or capable of being drawn about 
 two-thirds into the first segment. The mandibles or 
 jaws are short and strong, of a dark l)r()wn or near- 
 ly black color at the ends ; but a liglit brown at the 
 base ; the head is also a light reddish brown. The 
 Itody of the smaller specimen is white, that of the 
 larger one is tinged with light red ; but this arises 
 from the contents of the stomach seen through it. — 
 After voiding a light rod excrement, the part of tho 
 abdomrn thus evacuated is clear wliite. Tliere are a 
 few wliite hairs distriljuted over tho whole body and 
 diverging from the liead and anal segment. The 
 insect voided a yeilowish liquid from its mouth, but 
 I could not discover that it had any odor.
