growers, generally, to increased activity, so much as 
 a confidence that it will be profitable as a business. 
 The person whose apples are of inferior quality, unfit 
 for market as fruit, and who gathers them and makes 
 them into cider to sell at the lowest price to the 
 vinegar merchant, may well regard fruit-growing as 
 unprofitable. For him it is so ; but he who raises the 
 the finest fruits, in large quantities, and obtains for 
 them the highest market prices, will discover that 
 fruit culture is much more profitable than grain cul- 
 ture, and will be disposed to abandon it. But in order 
 that fruit-growing shall be productive of profit, care 
 must be taken to adjust the quality and quantity to 
 the demand and state of the market. To those who 
 reside near to large towns, and attend the market 
 once or oftener in each week, it is important to have 
 the several varieties of first quality fruits ripening in 
 succession during the season ; so that at each market 
 day a portion of fruit may be ready for sale ; and 
 those who raise fruit for home consumption only, 
 should puruse the same course, so as to have a con- 
 tinous supply of the best fruit sufficient for liberal use 
 and enjoyment. But those who live remote from 
 large towns, and do not attend market frequently ; 
 if they engage in raising fruit for profit, will find 
 it to be tlieir interest to restrict their cultivation 
 to a few varieties (probably better to a single one) of 
 each species, so that the entire crop of each kind of 
 fruit, may be gathered and sent to market at the 
 same time. In this case, varieties must be selected 
 that will bear transportation well ; of good merchant- 
 able quality, and such if possible as have an estab- 
 lished reputation in the market to which they are 
 sent. Such has been the course pursued by some of 
 the fruit-growers of New York State residing from 
 100 to 300 miles from their principal city. 

Downing in the " Fruits and Fruit Trees of Amer- 
 ica," states that one orchard near Esopus, on the 
 Hudson river contains 2000 bearing Newtown pippin 
 trees. The mode there pursued, as I have been in- 
 formed, is, when the season arrives for taking in the 
 fruit, a sufficient number of men are employed to 
 pick it off the trees by hand, carefully, and having 
 barrels brought into the orchard, the fruit is careful- 
 ly packed and taken to the North River, and sent by 
 steamboat to New York city, and when stored it may 
 be sold to retailers there ; or if it can be more advan- 
 tageously disposed of at Boston, Philadelpliia, or even 
 at London or Liverpool, it is in order for shipment 
 without loss of time. Thus the market of the world 
 is opn. 

The course generally pursued in Pennsylvania has, 
 with some exceptions, been different. Orciiards con- 
 tain many varieties of apples, some, little known be- 
 yond tlie neighborhood in which they originated. — 
 The fruit gathered (sometimes without proper care,) 

is put into bags and taken to Philadelphia in wagons, 
 becoming more or less bruised in the transportation, 
 and upon arriving there, it must there be sold for 
 consumption ; because merchants will not go into the 
 market to and purchase it for shipping, on account 
 of the difficulty of getting sufficient quantities to- 
 gether of well known and well reputed kinds; of 
 the trouble of packing in casks; and of the injuries 
 already rceived in the bringing to market. Phila- 
 delphia now has communication with the interior of 
 the State by railroads and canals that will compare 
 favorably with the like advantages enjoyed by New 
 York, and it is important that the growers of Fruit 
 in Pennsylvania turn their attention to the advanta- 
 ges thus opened to them. 

I will not trespass further at this time, but desire 
 to be permitted to add something on this subject

Seedling Fruit. 

Mr. Editor: — In the July number of the "Firm 
 Journal," you take strong ground in favor of southern 
 Pennsylvania as a fruit growing region. You call 
 upon those "having the evidence in their possession 
 for a confirmation of your assertions." I will give 
 you a short history of one of the seedling fruits men- 
 tioned in your article, which you may insert if con- 
 sidered worth the space. 

The " Hosen Shenk Pear," as you designate it, is 
 generally known as Shenk's Pear, it is a seedlino* 
 of about forty years duration. Mr. John Shenk, of 
 Manor township, in this county, whom I well remem- 
 ber, with his wide pantaloons, his nether members 
 being apparently thrust into two three bushels bags. 
 It was a frequent remark of his, that during his life- 
 time, those same trowsers had been three times in 
 fashion. He was, generally speaking, a somewhat 
 singular character. His farm was greatly neglected, 
 barely raising grain sufficient to supply the familj-, 
 his time being almost exclusively devoted to the 
 raising and planting of strange trees and plants, and 
 smelling water ,• that is, going about the country, 
 wherever called for, with a twig of hazel, as a "di- 
 vining rod," to discovcr"subtcrranean water-courses 
 prior to tiie digging of wells. The truth or falsity 
 of this " science " I shall not now attempt to sub- 
 stantiate; suffice it to say, that Mr. Shenk was gene- 
 rally successful, and was looked upon as an oracle in 
 this matter by the community. I give you the above 
 imperfect sketch of the man in order :;o a better ap- 
 preciation of the merits of the fruit, bearing his 
 name. 

Mr. Shenk planted three seeds found in one pip or 
 cell of a pear, (the kind now unknown, but think in 
 all probability it was the old butter pear, or St.
