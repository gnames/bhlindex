[OCTOEBR, 

Michaels, Doyenne of the French,) about the year | 
 1805 to 1810. The three seeds produced trees, and i 
 all bore fruit, two of them being worthless. This 
 one, being planted near the smoke-house, first went 
 by the name of smoke-house pear, and the fruit 
 being so superior, soon became well known all over 
 this part of the country. 

The tree is a vigorous and strong grower, far out- 
 growing the old butter pear, and in comparison with 
 that fine old and now almost extinct variety, is supe- 
 rior in every respect ; the tree is larger and more 
 thrifty, the fruit larger, and if possible, more lusci- 
 ous ; the tree a great bearer in a favorable soil and 
 situation. It ripens from the middle of August to the 
 middle of September, according to the seasons. 

You designate it as one of the earliest, this is an 

error, as there are many varieties ripening before it.

[We are ready to endorse any thing our friend 
 the Dr. chocses to say in regard to the Diller Pear; 
 well knowing that his fine taste in all that relates 
 to pears constitutes him an excellent judge. We 
 tasted it in Philadelphia and consider it unsurpassed 
 by any other with which we are acquainted. The 
 drawing was placed in the hands of the engraver, 
 but at too late a date to have the cut in time for the 
 present number. We will have it ready for our next.

The Diller Pear. 

Mr. Editor: — Inasmuch as you were personally 
 present at the recent sessions of the American Pomo- 
 logical Society, and heard the eulogiums passed by 
 the most eminent pomologists and committees, upon 
 the Diller Pear — most probably a native of your 
 county — it will be superfluous for me to say any 
 thing in its praise. 

The reports of that society as well as a committee 
 of the Chester County Horticultural Society — who 
 know a good pear from a persimmon — will probably 
 introduce to the notice of cultivators a pear which 
 has very few superiors at any season ? 

A description and linear drawing to assist in its 
 recognition, will appropriately appear in your jour- 
 nal. I have therefore prepared as carefully as the 
 few specimens left, and my knowledge of it, will 
 enable me, the following, which I hope may appear 
 when it suits your convenience. 

Diller, among the very best August pears and 
 deserves a place in every collection in this State. 
 It is named after the person on whose property it 
 grew and by whom it was most probably raised from 
 seed, one hundred years since. Tradition says he 
 brought the tree or scions from Germany; but this 
 is extremely doubtful, because of long voyages and 
 want of horticultural knowledge. It is more proba- 
 ble he brought seed of some favorite pear, planted it, 
 and raised this tree. Its growth much resembles 
 the Bloodgood, short jointed, wood-reddish-brown, 
 not a rapid grower but bears regularly and abun- 
 dantly. Fruit of medium size, obovate irregular or 
 one-sided, thicken ng abruptly into the stalk, which 
 is an inch long and obliquely inserted. Skin, at 
 maturity, golden yellow, sprinkled, and one side 
 mostly covered, with light cinnamon russet. Calyx 
 mostly open, set in a slight smooth depression. Flesh

This affair is now on hand, and in order to be in 
 time for the next issue of the Farm Journal, I antici- 
 pate the regular report, by giving a slight sketch. — 
 It is generally conceded to be the best display yet 
 made by this Society, particularly in the departments 
 of fruits and vegetables, which would be creditable 
 to any exhibition in the country. Indeed, it would 
 appear as if Flora and Pomona were becoming wea- 
 ried with their long sojourn amid the rough and 
 rocky soils and inhospitable climate of our friends 
 of the Bay State and regions roundabout, and were 
 about to wing their way to establish their head quar- 
 ters in our more southern and congenial atmos- 
 phere. Very certain it is, from the exhibition here 
 and in Philadelphia, that the land of Wooden Nut- 
 megs and of Pears (par excellence) must concede 
 hereafter, that as regards the latter, she is despoiled 
 of her laurels, and that while in respect to the nut- 
 megs, we do not even hope to equal her, we may 
 safely challenge her to show finer Bartletts, Duchesse 
 d'Angoulemes, St. Ghislains, Seckels, and other fine 
 varieties. 

Of the large contributors of Pears, Dr. J. K. Esh- 
 leman, A. Marshall & Co., Thomas Harvey, Jona- 
 than Baldwin and Paschall Morris & Co., exhibited 
 from 25 to 43 varieties each. Finer or better flavor- 
 ed specimens were never shown. The premium for 
 the best dozen was awarded to Dr. J. K, Eshleman, 
 for St. Ghislain, for the best quarter peck to same 
 for Bartlett's. 

Of apples there was a large display, and remark- 
 able specimens in size and quality of some of the 
 new and fine varieties, as well as those more gener- 
 ally known. I have never seen Baldwins and Rus- 
 sets to equal those of the growth of Richard J. 
 Downing, near Downingtown, in this county. A. 
 Marshall & Co., exhibited 71 varieties of apples. — 
 Joshua Embree 60, and received the premium for the 
 best display. R. J. Downie, 42 varieties. Jonathan
