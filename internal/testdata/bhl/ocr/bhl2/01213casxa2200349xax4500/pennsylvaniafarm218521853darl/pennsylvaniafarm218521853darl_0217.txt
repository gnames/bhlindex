cubical foot of the richest is not able to produce an 
 equal quantity of vegetables cwteris paribus, to 20 
 cubical feet of the poorest ; therefore it is not strange 
 that the poorest, where, by pulverizing, it has ob- 
 tained 100 times the internal superficies of the rich 
 untilled land, should exceed it in fertility." 

"While I do not endorse Mr. Tull in all that he ad- 
 vances in the above paragraph, I do think his rea- 
 soning highly satisfactory and conclusive. If it will 
 not hold good between the very richest, and the very 
 poorest soils, it certainly will in those of nearly 
 equal quality. 

If by thorough tillage the internal superficies of 
 of the soil is increased an hundred fold, is it more 
 than reasonable to suppose that the growing plant will 
 be much more vigorous, (because better fed) than in 
 the other case. Were there no other reasons in fa- 
 vor of thorough tillage, those already given are suf- 
 ficient to convince every reasonable farmer of the 
 immense benefits which must result from it. As I 
 have, however, already exceeded the limits I intended 
 when I commenced, I shall reserve the balance for 
 another article.

More about the New Evergreen. 

Mr. Editor — In answer to your invitation to com- 
 municate farther in reference to that new evergreen, 
 I would just state that I am unable, I think, to add 
 much to what was contained in a former communica- 
 tion; however as several letters have reached me late- 
 ly enquiring particularly concerning it, I will now 
 give as minute a description of its growth, appear- 
 ance, &c., as my observation will justify me in doing. 
 This evergreen seldom attains a height of more than 
 two feet. A central stalk does not usually pass per- 
 pendicularly upwards, though sometimes this is the 
 case. The branches generally spi'ead out, and leave 
 each other at the surface of the ground running from 
 two to three feet and even farther occasionally, from 
 this common origin, making an angle with the ground 
 of about fifty degrees. 

The stems in appearance are not unlike the Scott- 
 ish Fir, having a bufiy color, and principally covered 
 Avith loaves. In structure the leaf resembles the com- 
 mon Hemlock, but it is a great deal larger and of a 
 deeper green, and its appearance is more glossy and 
 luxuriant. It bears no flower as I am aware of. — 
 One of your correspondents mistook the remarks you 
 made in reference to that flower I sent you, as apply- 
 to the Evergreen. The soil in which it is found is of 
 a light loamy nature, and it is generally shaded by 
 surrounding trees. Should any wish to see speci- 
 mens of the leaf and branches I will hold myself in 
 readiness to accommodate them by application to me j 
 by mail. Very truly yours,

Plowing in Dry vs. Green Clover. 

Mr. Editor : — I have read with interest the re- 
 marks of James Gowen, Esq., also those of Mr. J. 
 W. of Kishacoquillas, on the subject of plowing 
 down green clover. On all subjects of such con- 
 sequence to the farmer, it is of the first importance 
 that accurate and well digested ideas should be 
 placed before the public. Although Mr. Gowen is 
 quite scientific enough in his remarks for all practi- 
 cal purposes, it is evident his inferences and conclu- 
 sions are drawn with less care and circumspection, 
 than is evidently due to a subject of so much impor- 
 tance to agriculture. J. Ws. remarks are purely 
 practical, and as I am well acquainted with the gen- 
 tleman, I can fully endorse his remarks, but at the 
 same time would beg leave to point out what I con- 
 ceive to be a want of precision in his statement. He 
 says, he cut down his clover " when it was about fit 
 to cut for seed." Then the stalk and heal are dry, 
 and nearly, if not altogether divested of their sap, 
 and yet he calls it plowing down green clover. Now 
 my own experience has been, that when I plowed in 
 clover when it was green and in full bloom, on stir- 
 rinff the ground afterward, I could scarcely observe 
 any trace of rotten clover. The clover being in a 
 green and pulpy state, my own impression was that 
 it had become as Mr. Gowen remarks, " mere acidu- 
 lated water." and left the field in a condition more 
 like a corn stalk fallow, than a cloverfield— rather 
 souring than benefitting the land. But when I adop- 
 ted J. Ws. method, of plowing in dry clover, at 
 about the same stage of ripeness as that described 
 by him, I found on stirring the ground that the field 
 had the appearance of being covered with rich black 
 looking manure,— the clover not entirely disappear- 
 ing as in the former case. It was, however, pretty 
 thoroughly decomposed, and as this system has nev- 
 er failed with me, in a good season to produce a good 
 crop of wheat, I am led to give it the preference 
 over the other. Whenever there is too much sod 
 or blue grass to admit of stirring, I found that the 
 rotten clover did equally good service underneath, 
 so soon as the roots of the wheat fairly penetrated it. 

In hopes that some of your more scientific writers 

on agriculture will explain the relative value of 

green clover and dry in the formation of food for 

wheat, I remain yours.
