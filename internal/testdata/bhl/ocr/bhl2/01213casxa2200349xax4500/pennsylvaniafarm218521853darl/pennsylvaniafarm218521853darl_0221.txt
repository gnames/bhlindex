in the gardens of his Queen at Wimbleton, in Surry, 
 there were upwards of 200 trees. 

Cherries, wlien eaten to excess, are unwholesome, 
 and vice versa. It has been asserted, (upon what au- 
 thority we know not,) that if eaten fresh from the 
 tree, while the morning dew is upon them, swallow- 
 ing the stones also, they will purge so effectually as 
 to cure those who have the gout in their feet. When 
 dried they are much esteemed for winter puddings ; 
 and the wine made from this fruit much resembles 
 Eed Constantia, both in color and flavor. The small 
 black ones, with good brandy, produce one of the 
 most wholesome, as well as agreeable liquors. The 
 gum which exudes from the tree is analagous to Gum 
 Tragacanth. A variety of the small-fruited Bird- 
 Cherry (Cerasus avium) is used in the Vosges and 
 the Black Forest, for the preparation of the liquor 
 known by the name of " KIrschenwasser," and the 
 leaves are employed as a substitute for tea. The ker- 
 nel of the C. occidentalis, is used for flavoring the 
 liquor Noyau. Dr. Clarke says, the Swedes flavor 
 their distilled spirits with the blossoms. The Fin- 
 landers use a strong decoction of the bark to cure 
 syphilitic complaints. A decoction of the fruit is 
 sometimes given in dysentery. The wood is next to 
 oak for strength, and has some resemblance to mahog- 
 any; it is much in request for making chairs, musical 
 instruments, &c. The timber comes to perfection in 
 about forty years. 

At Hamburgh there is an annual feast celebrated, 
 called "the feast of cherries," when children, carry- 
 ing green boughs ornamented with cherries, parade 
 the streets. It originated in the following circum- 
 stance ; In 1432, the Hussites threatened the city with 
 immediate destruction. The citizens, at the sugges- 
 tion of a person named "Wolf, agreed in this emergen- 
 cy to send all the children, from 7 to 14 years of age 
 in mourning as supplicants to the enemy. The chief 
 of the Hussites was so touched at this spectacle, that 
 he received the young supplicants, regaled them with 
 cherries and other fruits, and promised them to spare 
 the city. The children returned crowned with leaves, 
 holding cherries and crying "victory!" 

Stones on Cultivated Liand. 

It is an error to suppose that stones should be en- 
 tirely removed from land which is under cultivation. 
 The stones which would be in the way of the scythe 
 while mowing, of course should he remove 1, but all 
 the smaller ones should remain ; and if wholly or par- 
 tially imbedded in the soil, they preserve moisture 
 during a drought, and thus serve materially to in- 
 crease the crop. The following article from the 
 Gentleman's Magazine, published in 1773, is to the 
 point : 

" It has been long known to experienced farmers, 
 that taking away very small stones and flints, is 
 detrimental to plowing lands in general : but more 
 particularly so to thin, high lands, and all lands of 
 a binding nature. It was, however, never imagined 
 that the damage could bo so great as it is now found 

to be, since unusual quantities of flints and other 
 stones have been gathered for the use of turnpike 
 and other roads. In the parish of Serenage, in 
 Hertfordshire, there is a field known by the name of 
 Chalkdell field, containing about two hundred acres ; 
 the land in this field was formerly equal, if not supe- 
 rior, to most lands in that country ; but lying con- 
 venient for the surveyors of the roads, they have 
 picked it so often, and stripped it of the flint and 
 small stones to such a degree, that it is now inferior 
 to lands that were formerly reckoned not much over 
 half its value, acre for acre. 

" Nor is it Chalkdell field alone that has materially 
 suffered in that country by the above mentioned 
 practice : several thousand acres bordering on the 
 turnpike roads from Wellwyn and Baldock, have 
 been so much impoverished, that the loss to inherit- 
 ance forever must be computed at a great many 
 thousand pounds. What puts it beyond a doubt that 
 the prodigious impoverishment of the land is owing 
 to no other cause but picking and carrying away the 
 stones, is, that those lands have generally been most 
 impoverished, Avhich have been most often picked ; 
 nay, I know a field, part of which was picked, and 
 the other part plowed up before they had time to 
 pick it, where the part that was picked lost seven or 
 eight parts in ten, of two succeeding crops ; and 
 though the whole field was manured and managed 
 in all respects alike, yet the impoverishment was 
 visible where the stones had been picked off, and 
 extended not an inch farther ; an incontestible proof 
 of the benefit of the stones. 

Deep Plowing. 

The present season has proved to the satisfaction 
 of every observer, that in deep plowing is to be found 
 the principal security against drought. Fields tilled 
 only to the depth of six or seven inches have suf- 
 fered from severe dry weather, while side by side 
 with them may be seen crops that have not seemed 
 to feel the drought at all. In passing over several 
 river farms a few days since, we found pieces of 
 corn wheie the leaf was rolled, and the color was 
 light and verging towards a yellow. On one of these 
 we passed with a step from corn of this description 
 to that at least a foot taller, of a deep lively green, 
 and a broad uncurled leaf. Everything indicated an 
 entirely different crop. We immediately turned to 
 our companion for an explanation. The seeding was 
 the same with the single exception of the use of a 
 subsoil plow on this latter part. The gentleman had 
 never used the subsoil plow before, and tried it upon 
 this piece as an experiment. It was to him perfectly 
 satisfactory, (it certainly was to the looker on) and 
 he said he should use it on all his farm. 

We have no doubt that subsoil or deep trench 
 plowing would be equally beneficial in a season of 
 much rain. Of course when the supply of water is 
 from springs or the under current of hij^her land, it 
 must be cut off by draining. 

To prevent crops from suffering from the drought, 
 plow deep and stir frequently the surface â€” Granite

Ten Reasons for Under-Draining. 
 The following ten reasons are worthy of being 
 committed to memory : 

1. It prevents water which falls from resting on 
 or near the surface, and renders the soil dry enough 
 to be worked or plowed at all times, 

2. By rendering the soil porous or spongy, it
