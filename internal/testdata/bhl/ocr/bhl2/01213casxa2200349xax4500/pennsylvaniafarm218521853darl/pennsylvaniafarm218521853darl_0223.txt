Letter from Thomas Jefferson. 

The following letter from the distinguished patriot 
 and statesman Thomas Jefferson to Mr. Peyton of 
 Washington City, was handed us a few days since 
 for publication by Lewis Hamersly, Esq., of Lancas- 
 ter City, who has the original in his possession. It 
 is interesting from the fact that it shows that not- 
 withstanding the pressing and important duties of 
 the lofty positions held by Mr. Jefferson during the 
 greater portion of his life, he still found time to 
 devote to agricultural pursuits. From the readiness 
 with which he discourses in regard to the vegetables 
 referred to in the letter, it is apparent that the sub- 
 ject was a familiar one to him. 

To Mr. Peyton, Mount Eagle. 

Thos. Jefferson returns his thanks to Mr, Peyton 
 for the cabbages he has been so kind as to send and 
 which are very fine. He sends Mr. Peyton some 
 seeds of the Sweet Kale. He sends him two other 
 kinds of seeds because they are rare and valuable. 
 The Sprout Kale is to be sown and transplanted as 
 cabbages, but not to be taken up in winter. It begins 
 in December to put out a multitude of sprouts of 
 which it will furnish two or three successive crops 
 thro' the winter. The main plant is not eatable, 
 requires rich land. 

The Dwarf tomato is earlier, later, and hardier 
 than the common kind. It will spread itself into 
 waste I arts of your garden like a weed. He salutes 
 Mr. Peyton with esteem and respect.

LIME AS A FERTILIZER. 

The use of Lime as a fertilizer of our soils, has of 
 lata been much discussed by some gentlemen, who 
 rank amono; intelligent farmers, and for whose opin- 
 ions I entertain great respect. The discussion re- 
 ferred to in the last number of your interesting and 
 highly valuable journal, I have read with deep inter- 
 est. I am an advocate for the judicious use of lime, 
 and I have never yet seen it propei-ly applied, where 
 it did not pay 50 per cent, for the outlay in its pur- 
 chase. There is no article, so cheap, that can be 
 applied with so much pennaiient benefit, whether it 
 acts as a fertilizer or only as a stltaulunf. If the for- 
 mer wishes to deepen his soil and to plow deep, noth- 
 ing will enable him to do so with such complete suc- 
 cess as the application of lime. I am yet, too, to find 
 soil in such a high state of cultivation, as not to re- 
 ceive assistance by the application of a coat of good 
 lime, unless previously dressed sufiSecntly witli the 
 article. Nothing can be furnished for the same mon- 
 ey that will occasion so great an increase in the crop 
 of grass, particularly clover. This increase will en- 
 large the manure heap, and this again applied to the 
 soil will add to its enriching properties. 

The use of most arfificial manures, so extensively 
 advertised at the present time, is attended no doulit 
 with some good, but the benefit is not lasting. The 
 application must be continued, or the effect is soon 
 gone. Not so with lime. I can look upon farm- 
 limed ten or fifteen years ago, at the rate of fifty to 
 one hundi-ed bushels per acre, that still show the ef- 
 fects of the application, and will continue to do so for 
 years to come. 

On poor and worn out land lime has accomplished 
 wonders. On some of the shores washed by the was 
 ters of the Chesapeake Bay, there are large deposits 

of oyster shells, in some places the ground is covered 
 with them to the depth of many feet. The great ben- 
 efit experienced by most farmers upon the Eastern 
 Shore of Maryland by the use of stone lime, attracted 
 attention to these oyster shells. Extensive kilns have 
 been erected, and thousands of bushels of lime burned 
 annually from these shells are applied with astonish- 
 ing effect. It will not do at this late day to attempt 
 to underrate the good effects of lime. There is a 
 spirit of inquiry awake among farmers upon these 
 subjects. They are making comparisons of the diff- 
 erent fertilizers of their lauds ; and I am greatly mis- 
 taken if nine-tenths of all real practical cultivators of 
 the soil are not advocates for the use of lime. What 
 if a few fiarmers have used it without perceiving much 
 or any benefit? This must not lead to its condemna- 
 tion. Have no farmers used gypsum (Plaster of Par- 
 is) without perceiving any benefit from its applica- 
 tion? A few years since I applied gypsum to a field 
 of clover, and after I had sowed it upon about one- 
 half of the field, I was compelled by a change of 
 weather to stop, and the remainder of the field was 
 let go without being finished. At mowing time, and 
 at no period of time previous, was I able to perceive 
 the least difference in the clover. It all presented 
 the same appearance ; and when mowed the part not 
 dressed with plaster produced as much hay as the 
 other half of the field. Still I am an advocate of the 
 use of plaster, though I think its application does 
 less good to lands thoroughly limed than to those 
 where little or no lime has been used. 

I was well acquainted with an intelligent gentleman 
 in this county, who lost his life in a lime quarry, who 
 was so thoroughly convinced, from practical observa- 
 tion, of the great advantage secured by the use of 
 lime, that he offered to furnish the article, free of 
 charge, provided he was allowed iJte increased pro- 
 ducts of the succeeding crops o-ver and above that pro- 
 duced by the part of the ground where no lime had 
 been applied. 

When I took possession of my present farm, twelve 
 years since, all the manure I could make annually 
 would not well cover twenty acres of ground. I have 
 this year manured for corn and potatoes fortij-three 
 acres. I am hauling out fur wheat, and I find I sliall 
 still have sufiiciont left to dress twenty-five or tliirty 
 acres more. Now, where does this increase of ma- 
 nure come from ? I have never used a handful of 
 guano, bone-dust, or poudrette, and I bought little 
 or no stable manure within the last few years. My 
 starting j)o I nt was with lime, and in the twelve voars 
 I have applied thirty thousand bushels on about 250 
 acres of cultivated land ! I now need but little, and 
 shall this year use only about two hundred bushels. 
 I am reaping the benefit of previous applications, 
 and my soil will continue to improve by proper 
 care, without the use of much lime for twenty years 
 to come. Grounds that used to be plowed four in- 
 ches, are now turned over to the depth of ten inches, 
 >ind this with good results. 

To test the sincerity of my remarks in reference 
 to the advantages to be derived from lime, I will make 
 to any respectable farmer, the following proposition: 
 Let him select a field of uniform quantity of Boil. â€” 
 On one half of this let him apply, on the sod, two 
 years previous to plowing for corn, sixty bushels of 
 good lime per acre, from the kiln, in a tine pulveriz- 
 ed state. Let the whole field ever after b? treated 
 exactly alike ; and at the end of six years, ii the 
 part limed docs not yield of all crops more than the 
 other, send the bill for the lime to me and I will pay 
 jfc' William Stavely.
