We have not room this month for more than a 
 mere list of the officers of this association. The at- 
 tendance was large and the proceedings of a highly 
 intcrestinf character. A Constitution and By-Laws 
 were adopted. The following propositions were then 
 taken up in order and discussed. 

The Business Committee proposed for the action 
 of the Pomological Cougress the following subjects : 

1. To revise the list recommended by the former 
 session of the Congress for general cultivation. 

2. To revise the list of rejected varieties. 

3. To recommend such varieties as are worthy f 
 general cultivation, or for particular localities. 

4. To add to the rejected list such as are unworthy 
 of cultivation. 

5. To appoint a temporary committee of seven on 
 synonimes, who shall sit during the Convention. 

The following are the new officers cliosen :

Ohio State Fair — Was held at Cleveland on the 
 IStli, 16th, and 17th insts.. and is represented as 
 havintr been more largely attended than any similar 
 exhibition ever held in the United States. The re- 
 ceipts were $14,500 and nearly $0000 were distribut- 
 ed as premiums. Well done, neighbor ! 

Action and Re-action in Farming. — Fences oper- 
 ate in two w.iys — if good they are a defence, if poor 
 an offence. 

Many a farmer, by too sparingly seeding his new 
 meadows, has had to cede his whole farm. 

Every farmer should see daily every animal ho has, 
 and inspect its condition. Weekly visits, as with 
 some, soon result in weakly animals. 

The man who provides well sheltered cotes for his 
 sheep in winter, will soon find plenty of coats for his 
 own back. 

A good housewife should not be one of "one idea," 
 but should be equally familiar with the flour garden 
 and flour barrel ; and though her lesson should be to 
 lessen expense, yet the scent of a fine rose should not 
 be less valued than the cent in the till. If her hus- 
 band is a skillful sower of grain, she is a equally 
 BKilful as a sewer of garments ; he keeps his hoes 
 bright by use ; she keeps the Jiose of the family in 
 order. — Albany Cultivator. 

Moss and Rough Bark on Trees. 

All are perhaps ready to agree with me, that moss 
 and rough bark are heavy drawbacks on the apple 
 trees. We will first consider the cause, second the 
 effect, and then the remedy. The centre of vitality 
 in the stem or trunk of a tree, is in the line of de- 
 marcation between the bark and the wood ; and it 
 recedes from that point both to the centre of the 
 wood and to the surface of the bark, until in old trees 
 can be found dead wood in the centre, and dead bark 
 on the surface. By a law of nature, when life ceases 
 to hold organized matter, dissolution and decay fol- 
 low. It then becomes food for other organizations, 
 and thus never ending changes are going on. Moss 
 is a kind of parasite that grows from the dead bark, 
 and is supported by the decayed matter of the dead 
 bark, and also by drafts of sap from the live bark. 
 Thus the moss steals, as it were, the life-blood of the 
 tree, and it loses its healthy appearance, and its fruit 
 is lessened both in quality and quantity. Moss and 
 rough bark are all plac(!S of deposit for insects, in 
 which their eggs are deposited. They also hold 
 water days after rainy weather, and by its gradual 
 evaporation, keep the temperature of the tree too low 
 for a cold climate. 

As a remedy, use a scraper first, and then on young 
 trees whose heads are not sufficiently developed to 
 shade the stem or trunk, use whitewash, which will 
 reflect the heat, and relieve it from the extreme heat 
 of a summer sun ; but on large trees, soap suds, ashes 
 and water, or lye, is preferable. In washing young 
 young trees, lye sliould not be too strong ; otherwise, 
 unless it is washed off or put on immediately before 
 a brisk shower, there is no danger of injuring them. 

In order that these hints may be put in practice, 
 and that good may be the sequel, I will cite the 
 reader to his own observation. Show me a mossy, 
 rough barked orchard, that yields a fair return of 
 good fruit, and I will show you a phenomenon. — 
 Cor. Gen. Farmer. 

In speaking of the good and bad qualities of the 
 Devon Cattle, Youatt remarks: — 

For the dairy, the Devons must be ackowledged to 
 be inferior to several other breeds. The milk is good 
 and yields more than an average proportion of cream 
 and butter; but generally it is deficient in quantity. 
 There are those, however, and no mean judges, who 
 deny this, and select the Devons even for the dairy. 

Such is not, however, the common opinion. They 
 are kept principally for their other good qualities, in 
 order to preserve the breed; and because, as nurses, 
 they are indeed excellent, and the calves thrive from 
 their small quantity of milk more rapidly than could 
 possibly be expected. 

This aboriginal breed of British cattle is a very 
 valuable one, and seems to have arrived at the high- 
 est point of perfection. It is heavier than it was 
 thirty years ago, yet fully as active. Its aptitude to 
 fatten is increased, and its property as a milker 
 might be improved, without detriment to its grazing 
 qualities. 

Those points in which the Devons were deficient 
 thirty years ago, are now fully supplied, and all that 
 is now wanting, is a judicious selection of the most 
 perfect of the present breed, in order to preserve it 
 in its state of greatest purity. Many of the breeders 
 are as c.ireless as they ever were; but the spirit of 
 emulation is excited in others.
