THE FARM. 

[see frontispiece.] 
 We have frequently, -within the past twelvemonth 
 taken occasion to call the attention of those of our 
 readers interested in architectural pursuits to the 
 work now in course of publication by E. S. Jones & 
 Co., of Philadelphia, edited by Samuel Sloan, Esq., 
 Architect. The want of a more general diffusion of 
 a correct taste in Architecture in our country has 
 ever been severely felt. The unwearied efforts of 
 the late A. J. Downing, to inspire a love for the 
 beautiful, in the hearts of our people, have not, it is 
 true, been without their effect. Here and there we 
 behold evidences of a desire, at least, to improve 
 upon the grotesque styles of building which prevail 
 so universally thi'oughout the United States ; but this 
 desire is far from being general ; and the taste man- 
 fested in most of these attempts at improvement are 

anything but exquisite. The want therefore of Ar- 
 chitectural works, based upon correct principles, has 
 long been a source of complaint ; and as supplying 
 this want in part at least, we again commend to the 
 attention of our readers, the Model Architect, from 
 which superb work the frontispiece contained in our 
 present number, as well as the following description 
 in detail is taken. 

It is gratifying to observe, that t'lere is a growing 
 disposition on the part of merchants and profession- 
 al men, who have amassed wealth in cities, to retire 
 from the active pursuits which have engaged their 
 whole lives, and enjoy in the country the comforts 
 and relxation they have so faithfully earned. To 
 such men the value of a reliable work on architec- 
 ture is indispensable, as the removal to the country 
 is generally preceded by the erection of a country 
 house and the improvement of the grounds surround- 

ing it To the architect himself, the tvork is if pos- 
 sible, still more valuable, from the fact that his rep- 
 utation and success depend upon the taste displayed 
 in designing, and the skill in erecting buildings. â€” 
 " The Farm " may be regarded as a fair sample of 
 the character of the illustrations presented in the 
 Model Architect, and to it and the work itself as far 
 as completed wo refer the reader. 

In the second volume a new feature is introduced. 
 All the principal designs are exhibited in landscapes 
 taken from nature. There are surrounding us in all 
 directions a thousand of beautiful spots, suited m 
 every respect to become delightful places of resi- 
 dence, which are altogether neglected, and by many 
 unnoticed. It is believed that many valuable thoughts 
 will be suggested by locating our designs in the 
 midst of scenery suited to their character, and being 
 engraved in a superior style they will furnish also 
 pictures of various interesting localities. 

The view presented on Plate I. is taken from the 

neighborhood of Gray's Ferry near Philadelphia. 
 This is a spot interesting to every student of Ameri- 
 can history, and well known also for abounding in 
 beautiful quiet views. In the engraving the building 
 is placed at the intersection of two roads, now occu- 
 pied by a stone mansion. In front is an orchard, 
 and in the rear is spread out a large tract of excel- 
 lent farm land. The creek winds its way to the 
 Schuylkill, seen^in the distance. The road which 
 crosses the bridge is private, and leads to the farm ; 
 the other in front of the house is a highway. There 
 is nothing very striking in the view, but for a quiet 
 pleasant farm scene we think it has no superior, 
 though it may have many equals. 

Plate I. & II. presents the floor plans of the design. 
 The building is frame work throughout, and we sub- 
 join a comprehensive description and a bill of quan- 
 ties which render many remarks here unnecessary. 
 The post of the front verandah may be either of iron 
 or wood, and the apartments on the extreme of tho 
 wing may be placed elsewhere. It will be seen at a 
 glance that tho building is large and roomy, furnish-
