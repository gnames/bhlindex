THE LATE A. J. DOWNING.

He sketches it, gives you a copy of it in his "Land- 
 scape Gardening," together with his classical and 
 scientific account of this king of the American forrest. 
 He journeys up the beautiful valley of the Connecti- 
 cut to Stockbridge, Massachusetts, whose streets are 
 lined with the sugar maple, " clean, cool, smooth and 
 umbrageous." He there increases his love and ad- 
 miration of the American maple, the beauty of whoso 
 vernal is surpassed only by the unrivalled hues of 
 its autumnal foliage, dyed with the tints of depart- 
 ing day. 

By scenes like these, and by scientific reflection 
 thereon, he prepares himself to give those last and 
 well directed blows at that '■'heavenhj^' tree, the Ail- 
 anthus, and also at the Abele Poplar — both of which 
 he kills off in a most celestial manner, to make room 
 lor the more deserving and truly American Maples, 
 Oaks, Elms and Ashes, for the Magnolia, the Tulip 
 and others. Of the latter, how beautifully he speaks 
 in the last leader from his pen, in a manner so easy 
 and flowing, and so characteristic of the man. " We 
 mean the Tulip-tree, or the Lirodendron. AVhat can 
 be more beautiful than its trunk, finely proportioned, 
 and smooth as a Grecian column ? AVhat more artis- 
 tic than its leaf, cut like an arabesque in a Moorish 
 palace ? What more clean and lustrous than its 
 turfs of foliage, dark green and rich as deepest eme- 
 rald ? What more lily-like and specious than its 
 blossoms, golden and brown shaded ? and what fair- 
 er and more queenly than its whole figure, stately 
 and regal as that of Zenobia t" 

In the progress of his journey, he reaches the com- 
 mercial metropolis of New England. It is the annu- 
 al Exhibition of the Massachusetts Horticultural So- 
 ciety in the city. lie enters its Hall, is greeted with 
 a cordial welcome, and invited to examine its collec- 
 tion, particularly the extensive show of pears. In a 
 subsequent discussion with its fruit committee, he 
 proposes to them a question in his direct, practical 
 and impressive manner — " Will each of you please 
 to give me the names of the best three varieties of 
 the pear, together with their reasons for that prefer- 
 ence 1" He obtains their opinions, and publishing the 
 same, puts the public at once in possession of their 
 long and dear bought experience. 

The same practical and studious habit is remarka- 
 bly exemplified in his foreign tra,vels. Unlike other 
 tourists, who visit the tower of London or Westmin- 
 ister Abbey, he hastens from the parks of that city 
 to Chatsworth, then to Woburn Abbey, Warwick 
 Castle, and other places where agriculture, horticul- 
 ture, architecture, and all the fine arts have for ages 
 vied with each other in whatsoever is ornamental in 
 embellishment and princely in wealth, and where are 
 scenes of natural and artistic beauty and grandeur 
 which attract the chief masters of the world. He is 
 received and entertained with kindness and partiali- 
 ty by the Earl of Ilardwicke, the Dukes of Devon- 
 shire and Bedford, and of others with whom he 
 formed many warm friendships in the motlier coun- 
 try. From these places, whore wealth, art, nature 
 and genius have congi-egated whatever is most beau- 
 tiful to the eye, most approved in taste, or most im- 
 pressive to sensibility, he prosecutes his journey ; 
 everywhere observing, noting and studying the ob- 
 jects and scenes about him. To him nvit a tree, a 
 plant, a leaf, a blossom, but contained a folio volume. 
 We have necessarily amplified this part of our sub- 
 j ect, in order to give a correct view of the manner 
 and extent of his education, of the peculiarities of 
 his style, and of the formation of his character, and 
 to furnish the materials for a just appreciation of his 

worth, and for a philosophical judgment of himself 
 and of his works. 

Mr. Downing was just what we'have represented, 
 a self-taught man. His name will appear in all com- 
 ing time, emblazoned upon the roll of fame, among 
 such worthies of that class as Roger Sherman, Ben- 
 jamin Franklin, David Rittenhouse, Benjamin West, 
 and Nathaniel Bowditch. He was not, perhaps, so 
 profoundly scientific, yet he Avas well gruunded in 
 vegetable physiology, and in the first principles of 
 the arts to which his life was devoted. Being the 
 sovereign of his own powers and acquisitions, he 
 could instantly bring them to bear on the subject of 
 his investigation or discourse. 

In his character we find that assemblage of virtues 
 commonly called amiableacss. On this depended the 
 suavity of his manners, the sincerity of his friend- 
 ship, and the freedom of his hospitality. His guests 
 always received a hearty Avelcomc, and found at his 
 residence a quiet home. Here Miss Bremer, whose 
 fame in letters is like that of the Swedish nightin- 
 gale in song, wrote the introduction to one of her 
 works ; and in speaking of his kindness and hospi- 
 tality, she says : " I never shall forget, nor ever be 
 able fully to acknoAvledge them, feeling ,is I here; do, 
 at this moment, all the blessings of a per feci home." 

He also possessed, what is rarely found in combi- 
 nation with these qualities, keen 2)erception, great en- 
 ergy, decision and huhlacss. Blessed with an almost 
 intuitive perception of character, he read men at a 
 glance. When he was in London, he desired an as- 
 sistant, who would return with him to America and 
 aid him in the architectural department of his busi- 
 ness. He visits the architectural exhibition in that 
 city, and seeks an introduction to the Secretary of 
 that association, to whom he reveals his object, and 
 by whom he is introduced to ^Ir. Calvert A'aux, as a 
 gentleman well qvuilified for the place. They ex- 
 change references : and so readily did he inspire 
 confidence in this stranger, and also perceive that he 
 might safely repose the same in him, that on their 
 interview the next morning he concludes a contract, 
 agrees upon the precise time Avhen they will start 
 from Liverpool for America, hastens to Paris to com- 
 plete his unfinished business, fulfils his engagement, 
 and in two weeks they are unitedly prosecuting their 
 labors at Newburg. Such was his activity, prompt- 
 ness and despatch. 

The increasing extent of his business would have 
 employed several common men ; his correspondouco 
 alone would have occupied a private secretar}' ; yet 
 the number and urgency of his duties never de- 
 pressed him, never confused him, never made him in 
 a hurry, because he was always the master, never 
 the slave of his business. 

Having once thoroughly investir:ated a subject, 
 he rested with confidence in his conclusions, and pub- 
 lished the same with .a boldness which arrested at- 
 tention and commanded respect. Witness his just 
 condemnation of " lohite houses " amidst rural beau- 
 tj', a color which no master of landscape would dare 
 to transfer to his canvass, yet which is as common 
 in the country as it is opposed to economy and good 
 taste. Witness also his condemnation of the impure 
 air of stove-heated and unventilated dwellings, air 
 which, with c()ual truth and propriety, he denomi- 
 nates " the favorite poison of America." This arti- 
 cle, copied by numerous journals, read by thousands, 
 and commending itself to their common sense, is fast 
 producing a reform, conducive alike to health, com- 
 fort and long life. But his kindness and magnanimi- 
 ty, his freedom from envy and jealousy, enabled him 
 to admire and commend whatever was excellent and
