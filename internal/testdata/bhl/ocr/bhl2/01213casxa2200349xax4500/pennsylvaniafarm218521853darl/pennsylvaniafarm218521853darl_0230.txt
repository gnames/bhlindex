THE LATE A. J. DOWNING. 

[October, 

praiseworthy, as freely and decidedly as he con- 
 demned their opposites. These characteristics arc 
 exemplilied in his montlily reviews of the press, and 
 in the notice of the works of other writers, which 
 appear in his volumes. 

In a word, Mr. Downing was in manners modest, 
 polite and gentlemanly, — in perception of fitness and 
 propriety intuitive, — in taste accurate and refined — 
 in tact and practical skill remarkable — in love of 
 country strictly national, American — in sentiment 
 pure — in life incorrupt — in most respects a model 
 man — in all nature's own child. It has justly said 
 of him, " at whatever point of view we regard him, 
 we are compelled to admit the symmetry of his char- 
 acter, the vigor of his mind, the versatility of his 
 talents, and that healthful flow of enthusiastic feeling 
 which marks his writings. There are those who can 
 work out beautiful thoughts in marble, who can 
 clothe them in the touchmg language of poetry, or 
 bid them flow in the rounded periods and convincing 
 strains of oratory ; but few minds seem more full" 
 possessed of the power to add art to the beauty of 
 nature, and make the desert blossom like the rose." 

His writings are a fiiithful transcript of his own 
 character. If his diction sometimes contains unusual 
 and even strange words and phrases, possibly un- 
 grateful to some classic ears, the worst which en- 
 lightened criticism can say of them is, that they sub- 
 ordinate elegance to originality and force. But his 
 language is generally pure, chaste and refined, not 
 unfrequently beautiful and highly ornate. His sty{e 
 is peculiarly his own, not rigidly methodic, some- 
 times abrupt, but always versatile and flowing. It is 
 remarkable for that of which he was passionately 
 fond in nature, and to which, with some latitude of 
 expression, we will appropriate the word "pictu- 
 resque." 

A single quotation will truly illustrate our mean- 
 ing, and also these qualities of his style. We select 
 the words with which he introduced the Horticultu- 
 rist to his readers, with the first breath of summer. 
 " Bright and beautiful June ! embroidered with 
 clusters of ordorous roses, and laden with ruddy 
 cherries and strawberries ; rich with the freshness 
 of spring, and the luxuriance of summer — leafy 
 June ! If any one's heart does not swell with the 
 unwritten thoughts that belong to this season, tlien 
 is he only fit for ' treason, stratagem and spoils.' 
 He does not practically believe th;it God made the 
 country. Flora and Pomona, from amid the blos- 
 soming gardens and orchards of June, smile graci- 
 ously as we write these few introductory words to 
 their circle of devotees. ****** Angry 
 volumes of politics have we written none, but only 
 peaceful books, humbly aiming to weave something 
 more into the fair garland of the beautiful and use- 
 ful, that encircles this excellent old earth." Such 
 passages enliven and adorn his works. 

Of these we can give but a brief account. 

The first is his " Landscape Gardening," which 
 introduced him to the literary and scientific world, 
 andgave him a rank among the distinguished writers 
 of his age. For years previous to its publication, he 
 seemed retired from the world, abstracted and ab- 
 sorbed, but in reality, he was occupied in intense 
 study of his subject. When he mastered it, and 
 adapted its principles to American climate, scenery 
 and people, he published it on both sides of the 
 Atlantic. 

Think of this young man, ah twenty-six years of 
 age, without the advantage of a liberal education — 
 with no precedents to guide him, with only a few 
 piac'ical hints from such men as Parmentier. seizins 

upon the first principles of this science in the works 
 of Repton, Price, Loudon, and others, with a com- 
 prehensiveness of mind, with a power of analysis, an 
 originality and fixedness of purpose, that would have 
 done honor to the first scholars in other departments, 
 popularizing and appropriating them to his own 
 period and country, and actually producing a book 
 which becomes at once a standard universally ac- 
 knowledged by his own countrymen, and praised by 
 Loudon, the editor of " Repton's Landscape Garden- 
 ing," who pronounced it " a masterly work," and 
 after quoting ten pages to give his English readers 
 an idea of its excellencies, remarks, "We have quoted 
 largely from this work because, in so doing, we think 
 we shall give a just idea of the great merit of the 
 author." This work the celebrated Dr. Lindley 
 critically reviews, in sundry articles in his Garden- 
 er's Chronicle ; and while he dissents from it on 
 some minor points, yet in respect to its cardinal 
 excellencies, he thus remarks: "On the whole, we 
 known of no work in which the fundamental princi- 
 ples of this profession are so well or concisely ex- 
 pressed." And in regard to Mr. Downing's explana- 
 tion of this science, and his general definition of it, 
 he adds, what is equally complimentary to our 
 author and to American genius, " no English Land- 
 scape Gardener has written so clearly, or with so 
 much real intensity." 

Closely allied to this science is the subject of Ar- 
 chitecture, to which our author next turns his atten- 
 tion; and in the following year he publishes his "Cot- 
 tage Residences." Of this work Mr. Louden also 
 observes, "This book is highly creditable to him as a 
 man of taste and an author, and cannat fail to be of 
 great service." This latter work, in time, creates 
 occasion for his "Architecture of Country Hous- 
 es," including designs for Cottages, Farm Houses and 
 Villas, tvith remarks on the interiors, furniture, and 
 the best modes 0/ tvarming and ventilating. 

Of these, the English and American press offer re- 
 marks so similar to those which we have already sub- 
 mitted on his Landscape Gardening, as to supersede 
 the necessity of much amplification. We select the 
 closing words of an English Review of one of these 
 works : 

"We stretch our arm across the 'big water' to 
 tender our Yankee co-adjutor an English shake and 
 a cordial recognition." We will add two examples 
 of the American estimate of these productions. Says 
 a gentleman resident on the Atlantic shore, who is 
 eminently qualified to form an enlightened judgment: 
 " Much of the improvement that has taken place in 
 this country, during the last twelve years in Rural 
 Architecture, and in Ornamental Gardening and 
 Planting, may bo ascribed to him." Another gen- 
 tleman, equally well qualified to judge, speaking of 
 suburban cottages in the West, says: " I asked the 
 origin of so much taste, and was told it might prin- 
 cipally be traced to Downing's Cottage Residences 
 and his Horticulturist. 

Of his remaining works, the " Horticulturist," 
 his monthly journal, which has en<'ered its seventh 
 year, is extensively celebrated for its appropriate, 
 interesting and eloquent leaders — for its numerous 
 and able correspondents — for its varied learning and 
 ripe experience — for its just and faithful reviews — 
 and for its tasteful embellishments and rural decora- 
 tions. 

His "Fruits and Fruit Trees of America," a 
 volume of six hundred pages, was printed in 1845, 
 both in New York and London, and in two different 
 forms — the duodecimo with lineal drawings, and the 
 royal octavo, both with these drawings and with col-
