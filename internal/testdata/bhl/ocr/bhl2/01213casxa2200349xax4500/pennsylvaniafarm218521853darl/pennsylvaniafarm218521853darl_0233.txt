The North American Sijlva; or a description of the 
 Forest Trees of the United States, Canada, and 
 Noiia Scotia, tf'c, Illustrated hy 156 colored cop- 
 perplate Engravings, hy Iledoute Bessa, etc. By 
 F. Andreio Michaux, Robert P. Smith, Phila., 
 Publisher. 

We are under heavy obligations to the enterpris- 
 ing publisher, for a copy of this superb work. The 
 accuracy with which the engravings are executed, 
 and the beauty and faithfulness of the coloring, to- 
 gether with the valuable descriptions accompanying 
 them, all serve to render these volumes indispensa- 
 ble to those desirous of familiarizing themselves with 
 the forest trees of North America. 

From the preface we learn that the foundation of 
 the great work was laid by the elder Michaux, who 
 devoted ten years — from 1785 to 1796, — to an explor- 
 ation of North America, from Florida to Hudson's 
 Bay. 

The History of North American Oaks which form- 
 ed the nucleus of the complete work, was published 
 shortly before the death of the father. The younger 
 Michaux visited this country subsequently, and the 
 magnificent volumes before us are the result of his 
 visit and extended researches. 

The Sylva was first published In France in 1810- 
 13. The first English edition translated by Hill- 
 house, was published in Paris. This was soon ex- 
 hausted, and a second produced at New Harmony in 
 Indiana, under the superintendence of the distin- 
 guished William Maclure. The style in which this 
 edition was got up, was so bad, and it abounded in 
 so many, and such gross typographical errors, that 
 it proved nearly worthless, and wholly unsaleable. 
 After the death of Mr. Maclure, his brother and ex- 
 ecutor, presented the original plates to Dr. Samuel 
 George Morton, of Philadelphia, who desirous of 
 seeing a handsome American edition, successfully 
 exerted himself to procure a publisher, and prevail- 
 ed upon his brother-in-law, Mr. J. Jay Smith, to be- 
 come the editor. Under the latter gentleman's su- 
 perintendence the present beautiful edition has 
 been produced, the translations having been render- 
 ed more accurate and the plates retouched where ne- 
 cessary. A glance at the work is sufficient to satisfy 
 every one that the coloring of the plates has been 
 done at heavy expense, by experienced artists, and 
 under most able and careful supervision, and will 
 compare favorably in every respect with the original. 
 The notes added by Mr. Smith are extremely valu- 
 able, and every department of the work has been got 
 up in a style creditable in the highest degree to all 
 concerned in it ; and what is also of great import- 
 ance the price has been reduced one-half. 

The same publishers have also issued the continu- 
 ation of Michaux's great work, by Nuttall, who be- 
 gins where Michaux left off. The continuation by 

Nuttall comprises three magnificent volumes, em- 
 bracing all the newly discovered trees of California, 
 New Mexico, and Oregon. In speaking of these 
 volumes Mr. Smith says : 

" It was a singular circumstance, and a happy one 
 it has proved for advancing science, that Mr. Nutt- 
 all arrived in thi§^ country the very year that the 
 younger Michaux left it. From that time he devoted 
 his talents to Botany, and after visiting a large por- 
 of the United States, with an aptitude of observation, 
 a quickness of eye, tact in discrimination, and tenac- 
 ity of memory, rarely possessed by one man, he pub- 
 lished his extended, and most happily executed bo- 
 tanical work, the 'Genera of North American 
 plants.' In 1834 he crossed the Ilocky Mountains, 
 and explored the territory of Oregon, and Upper 
 California. With his pecular qualifications, he pre- 
 pared the supplement to Michaux's Sylva, in three 
 handsome volumes, corresponding in size with the 
 present, the publication of which, after many delays, 
 was completed in 1849, by my son, in Philadelphia. 
 The two works are now one and homogeneous, the 
 former most highly valued by all lovers of trees, and 
 the latter destined to be equally so, when the fine 
 products of our newly acquired western regions 
 make their way to our gardens and plantations. — 
 The frequent references I have made to Mr. Nut- 
 tall's volumes, will show the reader that his addi- 
 tion to our Sylva, are both extensive and important ; 
 inspection will convince him that both authors stand 
 on the highest pedestal of merit."

 umes can be gratified by calling at our office, or full
