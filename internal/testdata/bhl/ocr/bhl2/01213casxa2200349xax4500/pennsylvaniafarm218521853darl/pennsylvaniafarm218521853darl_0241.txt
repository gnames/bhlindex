CHANGE OF I.0CAT10N OF FARM JOURNAI-. 

It will be seen that the office of publication of tlm 
 Farm Journal has been changed, and that for tlio fu- 
 ture, it will be located at West Chester. A variety 
 of inducements have led to this change, prominent 
 amongst which, are, assurances of increased strengtli 
 in our Editorial, as well as in in our contributor's de- 
 partmant. When it was first proposed to publish the 
 Farm Journal, it was never contemplated that the 
 prjaent editor should be connected with it editorially, 
 t:) a greater extent than attention to the business de- 
 pirtment would require. Circumstance:^ however, 
 demanded a new arrangement. Immediately after 
 th 3 State Fair at Harrisburg last fall, Professor Kal- 
 d vnan, who up to that time had discharged the du- 
 ties of Editor in chief, was called to one of the South- 
 ern States, where he remained until July of the pres- 
 ent year. His absence and the great distance be- 
 tween his place of re.sldence and the office of publi- 
 cition, at once deprived us uf his valuable services. 
 His name has continued at the head of our columns 
 under the hope that he would return and resume tlio 
 litorship. In the mean time, necessity compelled 
 mo very unwillingly to take the entire charge of tlio 
 Journal, and for the last twelve montlis it has been 
 nnder my editorial control only. It is tlierefore due 
 Prof. Ilaldeman to state, that whatever may have 
 been the ftiults of the Journal daring that time, he 
 is not responsible for them. 

The rapid increase of our subscription list, and 
 t'lo consequently multiplied business relations of the? 
 office, have compelled me to secure additional assi.«i- 
 tance, which could be done profitably, only bv chan"-- 
 iu5 the place of publication. And now that tlie 
 change has been made, the fond liopr^ is indul^'ed 
 that with increased strength in the several editorial 
 departments, and assurances that a lar^-er number 
 of able contributors, will lend thair valualde aid to 
 our columns, the Journal will be a more welcome 
 visitor than ever to our m my readers.
