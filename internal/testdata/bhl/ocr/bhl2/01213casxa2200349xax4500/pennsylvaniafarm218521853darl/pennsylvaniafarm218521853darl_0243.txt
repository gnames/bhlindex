of butter which had been detained on the road, and 
 arrived too late. It was from Susquehanna county, 
 and the actual cost of transportation was over $8, 
 more than the highest premium offered for less than 
 ten firkins. So far, much commendable public spir- 
 it has been evinced from all sections of the State, in 
 bringmn; on contributions to both the fairs, more for 
 the credit of the State, and to sustain the gi-eat cn- 
 terprize, than for any prospect of remuneration. 
 Hereafter, we hope the means of the Society will 
 allow of greatly augmenting the number and amount 
 of premiums, so as to approximate those in other 
 States. Liberal premiums will bring out our strength 
 and stimulate competition. In respect to the arrange- 
 ments, we have a few words to say. Some very de- 
 cided improvements, and additional accommodations 
 for contributors were made over those at Ilarrisburg, 
 which gave groat satisfaction ; particularly the trans- 
 portation of articles to and from the grounds at the 
 expease of the Society. This very difficult duty was 
 devolved on Sheriff Ilartman, who performed it in 
 the best manner, so as to accommodate all. A very 
 large portion of the stock, &e., arriving at Lancaster 
 at the same time, occasioned some hurry and delay, 
 but we heard of no accidents, either going to or re- 
 turnins from the grounds. The canal commission- 
 ers are also entitled to the thanks of the Society for 
 the accommodations they rendered on the road, and 
 in the arrival and departure of the cars. 

As regards the arrangements on the ground, new 
 as such immense gatherings are in our State, it could 
 hardly be expected that they should be entirely com- 
 plete, and free from all objection. Some discrepan- 
 cies occurred in the classification of articles for the 
 appropriate committees, some of the unenumerated 
 articles were overlooked, but whatever confusion and 
 mistakes occurred, we thought could very readily 
 have been obviated or removed, by the presence of a 
 Marshal and his aids, distinguished by appropriate 
 badges, who might have been on horseback, and had 
 the general superintendence. Members of the differ- 
 ent committees were constantly appealed to by stran- 
 gers or contributors for information, about which they 
 knew nothing. Neither the officers of the society, 
 nor executive committee could be distinguished from 
 the crowd. The only badges were those of the Judg- 
 es and Police. In the Floral Hall and Tent appro- 
 priated to Fancy articles, mach damage was done, 
 and irreparably to many articles, by the dust. This 
 might have been prevented by the ground either be- 
 ing floored over, or slightly watered every morning; 
 indeed a water cart over the whole grounds before 
 the influx of visitors, would have been a good thing. 

On the whole the Exhibition passed off well and 
 with the experience of two years, it may fairly be 
 anticipated that th3 next annual display will surpass 
 the two first, A difference of opinion exists wheth- 
 er after having located tlie State exhibition, for a few 

times in various parts of the State, so as to ex- 
 cite a general interest, it would not be best to perma- 
 nently establish it at some one location. Much may 
 be said on both sides of the question. There is no 
 doubt that the accommodations can be rendered 
 much more complete, and at much less annual ex- 
 pense, if one suitable place was selected and retain- 
 jd for this purpose. We look forward before long, 
 to the establishment by the State Legislature of a 
 model and experimental farm, under the auspices 
 of the State society. The absolute necessity fia- this 
 and the absolute duty of the Legislature to giant it, 
 are so palpable as to induce the belief, that suoh tar- 
 dy justice to the great pursuit of the people cannot be 
 long deferred. If so the vicinity of the model farm, 
 would be the place for the State exhibition. 

One other matter struck us, might be provided as 
 jDart of the arrangements at these fairs, and with 
 very great advantage. A series of lectures, address- 
 es, or meetings, each evening on subjects of interest 
 to the thousands of farmers collected from all parts 
 of the State. Many matters of great importance 
 might be treated of and elucidated at such times, 
 which would make these annual gatherings what 
 they really ought to be, and to a great extenc are, 
 places of instruction and improvement, and affording 
 material for thought and reflection afterwards. At 
 the late fair in New York, on one evening there was 
 a meeting of Pomologists, whose discussions brought 
 out a list of Pears adapted for the quince, and em- 
 bodied much practical and valuable experience. 
 And recently at Lancaster, Peter A. Brown, of Phil- 
 adelphia, was prepared to give a lecture on wool, to 
 which he has devoted much attention and enquiry 
 for many years, and is prepared to demonstrate some 
 facts as to the capacity of certain sections of our 
 country for its growth. His display of over twelve 
 hundred specimens from all parts of the world, at- 
 tracted much admiration. His lecture was however 
 defeated by all the suitable rooms having been pre- 
 engaged. Such intelledual amusements as Ole Bull 
 the Fiddler, the Infant Drummer, three and a half 
 years old, (probably eighteen,) and playing over one 
 hundred notes, and the fat girl, weighing five hun- 
 dred and twelve pounds, seemed to be in the ascen- 
 dancy, and attracted crowded levees, perhaps because 
 these other attractions were wanting. 

POMOLOGY. 

We hope, in future numbers of the Journal, 
 to devote more space to this department, than 
 it has hitherto received; and as a commencement, 
 our readers will find in another column, for the 
 first time, the list of fruits adopted for general cul- 
 tivation by the American Poraologcal Society, at 
 its first session in New York. We also give in 
 the present number, engravings of two of our na- 
 tive fruits, of the highest excellence, for drawings
