In introducing as a new feature into the Farm 
 Journal, monthly notices of the business operations 
 of the Flower and Vegetable Garden, Fruit Orchard, 
 and, perhaps, in future numbers, of the Farm, we 
 may remark that the recommendations will be con- 
 densed from practical observation and experience of 
 some years past- Method, system, the habit of doing 
 every thing in its right time, and in a proper man- 
 ner, is one of the great secrets of success in all bus- 
 iness, but is most especially required, in all that re- 
 lates to the productions of the soil. Crops of all 
 kinds must ba planted and gathered in their proper 
 season. Manures must be applied, the want of them 
 anticipated by timely preparation. Every week, and 
 almost every day, has its peculiar duties to be per- 
 formed at a certain time, or not at all; and on which 
 success or failure depends. What is sometimes call- 
 ed good luck, in obtaining an extra crop, rearing a 
 fine animal, exhibiting choice specimens of finely fla- 
 vored fruit, &G., is nothing more than the timely at 
 tention, to often very small matters, and the enlight- 
 ened practice, which science applied to agriculture, 
 has brought about. To many of our readers,oi course, 
 these monthly hints will merely serve to remind them 
 of work to be performed in proper course, without, 
 perhaps, giving any new suggestions. Our aim will 
 be to give simple practical details, rather than spec- 
 ulation, often both useless and expensive. We shall, 
 however, hope to keep the readers of the Farm Jour- 
 nal fully posted up with respect to all the improve- 
 ments and discoveries, with which the Progress of 
 the age, and scientific research has illustrated,opera- 
 tions in the soil, no less than other branches of indus- 
 try. Science applied to agriculture, is no longer mere 
 visionary speculation. She can point to results. Men 
 may still plough and sow and reap, and perhaps in 
 the same style as was done some centuries ago, but 
 they will fall bebind their fellows, and be left alone 
 by the still progressive march of improvement and 
 discovery, unless they are willing to read, examine 
 and be convinced. Agricultural chemistry has open- 
 ed to the farmer a knowledge of the seci'et influences 
 which affecthisdailyoperations, — that his crops must 
 l;e adapted to the nature of the elements contained in 
 his soil, or a specific food supplied fur the occasion. A- 
 nalyses have been made bycompctent chemists of almost 
 every kind of crops. New manures have been and are 
 being brought to light. New principles have been 
 applied, and new modes of culture, new plants, fruits, 
 and vegetables in our own and foreign countries have 
 been discovered; highly improved and simplified ma- 
 chinery has been introduced, all which, to some ex- 
 tent, the intelligent farmer must bocomo familiar 
 with, if he expects to succeed in his vocation, amid 
 the competition which surrounds him. Agricultural 
 Periodicals, as the medium of intelligence of the 
 practice of other districts than his own, and of im- 
 proved cultivation, are absolutely required by the 

times, and the rapid increase in their number, and 
 extent of circulation, is evidence of this fact being 
 appreciated. 

Calystegia Pubesceus. 

"We confess to having some strong suspicions that 
 this "most charming Chinese Climber" is going to be 
 rather a dangerous acquaintance. It belongs to the 
 natural family, Convolvulacea, and was classed by 
 Linnoeus and others of the earlier Botanists as Con- 
 volvulus, and it resembles very much in appearance 
 and habit,except the double blossom,that exceedingly 
 great pest of English f;irmers,and here, wherever it is 
 known, the Convolvulus Arvensis. We have had our 
 own troubles with this, and can hardly extirpate it 
 by repeated hoeings, and consider it one of the great- 
 est nuisances to be met with. Every piece of root, 
 however small, seems to make a plant, from its joint, 
 and from our observation of the Calystegia, it prop- 
 agates quite as easily, and we fear will be as difficult 
 to get rid of. We have known of a single strong 
 plant, left out over winter, to throw up at least 500 
 fine young plants the next season, without any so- 
 licitation or stimulus. There is a difference of 
 opinion whether it is pretty, and to those who think 
 so, we would recommend only to grow it in a large 
 pot, or a box, and when they become tired of it, by 
 no means to empty the contents on to the border, 
 but remove them carefully to a vacant spot, and sur- 
 round it with a large quantity of dry bush. The 
 brush should be quite dry. The application of a Lu 
 cifer Match, and a wisp of straw, will soon remove 
 all danger from Calystegia Pubescens, the '•'charm- 
 inff Chinese Climber." 

FRUIT ORCHARD. 

Scrape the loose bark off old trees, and apply to 
 trunk and forks of limbs, with a white wash brush, 
 soft soap and lyo, in eiiual parts. This will destroy 
 any parasitical Fungi, and break up the winter quar- 
 ters of insects. The Inirk of trees thus treated, be- 
 comes smooth and pliable, and we have known great- 
 ly increased productiveness to follow. Spade in a- 
 round the roots, well rotted manure. This is especi- 
 ally necessary for Dwarf Pear Trees. Apply leach- 
 ed ashes freely over the surface. I'lant out Goosc- 
 beiry and Currant bushes. Raspberries and Black- 
 berries. Dress up and weed out old Strawberry beds, 
 and mulch two or three inches deep with spent tan, 
 or leaves from the woods. Young orchards may be 
 planted out this month. Select, if possible, high 
 ground, with northern exposures; a preceding crop 
 of potatoes is a good preparation of the soil for 
 young trees. Let the first step bo to enclose with a 
 substantial fence, the ground nvjuirod for the orchard, 
 and then procure one of Duwning's, Thomas', or 
 Barry's Fruit Books, for directions lur planting, pro- 
 per distances, and after culture. These, it attended 
 to, will repay iu a single season ten times their cost. 
 Fall planted trees should ])e securely staked. Some- 
 times a mound of earth thrown up around the stems 
 to tlie height of twelve to 15 inches, to be removed 
 in the spring, will bo a good substitute for the stakes, 
 and also is valuable in warding off the attacks of 
 mice.
