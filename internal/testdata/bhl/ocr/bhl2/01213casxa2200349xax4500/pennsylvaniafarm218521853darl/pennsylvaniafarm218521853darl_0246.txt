Lay down and protect with a few inches of earth, 
 tender raspberries, grape A'lnes, &c. Prune away 
 old wood of raspl)erries. Moderate fall pruning 
 of trees may now bo done. Winter apples and pears 
 should be gatliercd before severe frosts. If they are 
 designed for keeping, of course they must be careful- 
 ly hand picked, in a dry day, and without bruising, 
 laid b_y in heaps for tvro or throe weeks, when they 
 should be again handled, carefully sorted, and plac- 
 ed in barrels in a dry, cool cellar or fruit room. A 
 fruit picker, Orchardist's Hook and Lxdder, to be 
 obtained at any of the Agricultural Warehouses, are 
 indispensable. With these, the finest fruit, generally 
 at the extremities of the limbs, may be safely reached.

 Transmutation of Plants. 

We perceive, by IIjvbv's Mijazi/i'i of Horticulture 
 for September, that the editor has been stirring up 
 the old thread-bare topic ot the transmulatlon of 
 plants ; and, although he professes a former want of 
 faith in that doctrine, he seems now inclined to think 
 the procc.-!s has been demonstrated by Mons. Fabre, 
 a French experimental Agriculturist. Tha belief in 
 transmutation is certainly very ancient, perhaps as 
 old as that in transubsfantiatioii ; and if we may con- 
 fide in the evidence furnished by popular tradition, 
 and which is still pertinaciously urged hj many cul- 
 tivators of the soil, the doctrine was fully established 
 long before Mons. Fabre was born. We know that 
 so long ago as the middle of the last century, this be- 
 lief Was so prevalent in Europe, that it was deemed 
 cxpedient,^ by the great Swedish Naturalist, to demon- 
 strate its fallacy by an elaborate argument, — wnich 
 Avas published, undjr his auspices, in the 5th volume 
 ofthi Anioiiiitatei Acadeinicas* But, of what a- 
 vail is it, to expose the fallacy of such notions to 
 those who are determined to cherish them? 
 "He that's convinc'd against his will, 
 "Is of the same opinion still." 

The belief continues to find comfortable quarters 
 in the minds of scores, and hundreds, of our Agri- 
 cultural fellow citizens, — while it laughs to scorn all 
 the arguments, dr.iwn from structural Botany, that 
 can be directed against it. Tne advocates of the no- 
 tion deal altogether in assertions, and a sort of sec- 
 ond-hand facts; by which the question is conclusive- 
 ly settled, with them. They have all seen, or heard 
 of, fields sown with Wheat, which produced little else 
 than cheat, Avhen the harvest came round; and they 
 very confidently ask, what better proof of convcr- 
 si,ni, cau be required. Mr. IIoyev tells us, "iutelli- * 
 g int cultivators, and men of veracity, have atSrmed 
 that such changes have taken place, and have ofer''d 
 to famish spicimen^ of the transmutation." So we 
 have often read, before; but we never yet saw, nor 
 could find, the person that ivould "furnish speci- 
 m3ns." The ''speciinem" are the very things we 
 want to see. 

If, as Mr. II^YEY says, Mons. Fabre "deraoa- 
 stratcs, beyond all further question, that Wheat is 
 itself a transmutation of a kind of wild grass," it is 
 to be hoped \\2 will let the d:niomtration do its per- 
 fect work, by furnishing us with ''spcaiineni" in a'l 
 the stages of trann mutation. As it required seoen 
 successive crops to comnlete the metamorphosis, wo 
 would like to have specimens in its ahorir/inal state of 
 "wild grass,"— and also in. the ra)dified" condition of 
 eaeh successive ijear, as it went on approximating to 
 f/e:mine Wiieal. Those would afford very interesting 
 eoidence in the case; and as it can no doubt be real^ 

ily furaished by Mons. Fabre, we shall eagerly ex- 
 pect its arrival, through Mr. IIovey, — pledging our 
 grateful acknowledgments, when it does come, through 
 the Farm Journal. 

It appears from the account of this remarkable 
 phenomenon, that the "wild grass" so successfully 
 operated upon by Mons. Fabre, is one to which Lin- 
 naeus gave the generic name of Aegilops, — well 
 known to the Botanists of Southern Europe. The 
 plant is somewhat allied to Triticiun, or Wheat, — 
 and one of the species was actually referred to Triti- 
 cum, by Beauvois. The one in question seems to be 
 a varietf/ of Aegilops ovata, L. and has been called 
 triticoides, from its resemblance to Wheat. 

Travelers, in former times, used to report, that 
 Wheat grew spontaneously in Sicily. It is now 
 known that they had reference to the Aegilops ovata, 
 which is abundant throughout that Island; and its 
 grain so much resembles that of wheat, that an an- 
 cient •.■?otanist [Caesalpinus,fide De Theis) named it 
 Triticum sj/lvestre. When ripe, this grass is gather- 
 ed by the Sicilian Peasantry, who tie the heads up in 
 bunches, and set them on fire; tliey burn with rapid- 
 ity,aQd so give the grains a slight roasting, which are 
 thus considered agreeable food. Thus much of the 
 plant, in its icild state. Now, every body knows that 
 long and skillful culture will improve the size and 
 qualitg of all vegetable products, — and of course the 
 grain of Aegilops may be so improved: But, we think 
 it yet remains to be shown that culture can essential- 
 ly change cither the generic or the specif c character 
 of Plants; and until Mons. Fabre shall establish the 
 allegation by authentic specimens, showing the trans- 
 mutation, we must believe — for all analogy, and all 
 oar observations compel us to believe — that his neuo- 
 made Wheat is nothing else than real Aegilops, — mod- 
 ifie 1 or improved, it may be, and probably is, by sev- 
 en years of careful cultivation, — but still Aegilops,

* The worthy disciples of this doctrine, in the "good 
 old times," not only believed (with their followers of 
 the present day,) that wheat would turn to cheat; but 
 they contended that it would often turn a wh^de series 
 of somersets; going off first into Eye, then from Rye 
 into Barley; from Barley into Lolium or Darnel; from 
 Lolium into Bromus, or Cheat; and from Clieat into 
 Oats. They even thought these vagaries could be 
 inverted, by a good soil; and that, with skillful man- 
 agement, iho erratic plant might be made to retro- 
 grade toward its pristine stats, at least as far back as 
 tiue!

 Theory i>f the Actioji of liime usediii Agriculture. 

A great amount of matter has lately been writt.u 
 and p'lblished, to show that Mr. James Gowen, inh s 
 Address before the Lancaster County Agricultural 
 Society, has been guilty of uttering false doctrines, 
 in relation to the use of lime as a fertilizer. And also 
 in respect to what he should have said, in regard to 
 ploughing in green crops. 

The most unaccountable part of this discussion is, 
 that not oae of these critics has offered the reader 
 any theory of his own, or any reasoning in support 
 of his position, other than the naked fact, of lime 
 having to his )iiind proved beneficial in a single in- 
 stance. Not one of these gentlemen has disclosed 
 the manner of application, or the attending circum- 
 stances. 

If I may be allowed to enter the list, without pledg- 
 ing myself wholly to sustain Mr. Gowcu's position, I 
 will offer some suggestions, which I think will go to 
 show, that in the main he is correct.
