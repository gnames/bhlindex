First, as to the Lime'- Let us inquire what Mr. 
 Gowen said in regard to it ? He says: "I hold it not 
 to be a manure, in the common acceptation of the 
 term." If Mr. Gowen excludes caustic lime from 
 the list of manures, because it only acts in a sec- 
 ondary manner, and does not to any extent be- 
 come incorporated with the produce, I am willing to 
 agree with him. But as regards carbonate of lime, 
 this distinction will not hold good. By reference to 
 his address it can easily be seen, that he only speaks 
 of caustic lime. Some of the advocates of the in- 
 discriminate use of lime have taken exception to this 
 expression of Mr. Gowen. But after all, the word 
 manure is but a name, and no very great disadvan- 
 tage to the fixrming community can ensue from call- 
 ing it by any other name, provided he allows it to 
 enjoy its proper place among those things which are 
 useful to husbandry. 

Mr. Gowen proceeds and says: "And that its too 
 "frequent application upon a large poi'tion of your 
 "land, the heavy loom and clay lands, is not only 
 "destructive of the real manure applied to those soils, 
 "but to the inherent organic fertility found in them." 
 Is this latter in substance correct ? 

Allowing the chemistry of Agriculture to be as yet 
 in its infancy, and many of its phenomena not per- 
 fectly understood: still we may confidently look to 
 that science for a solution of this question. I 

The vegetable kingdom is composed of a very few 
 elements, comparatively speaking, but each of these, 
 with very few exceptions, is "a sine qua non." And 
 as to those few cases where substitution is alleged to 
 have been effected, they are not well authenticated. 

In the progress of the science many theories have 
 been advanced, as to the sources from which these 
 several elementary constitutents are derived. The 
 theory that I have adopted, (not my own,) as to the 
 manner in which humus is instrumental in the 
 growth of plants, has direct relation to the part ta- 
 ken in the same work by lime. In using the term 
 humus, I wish to be understood as referring to Avoody 
 fibre undergoing eremacausis. Woody fibre consists 
 of carbon and oxygen and hydrogen in the proportion 
 to form water. By the absorption of oxygen from the 
 atmosphere, the vegetable matter in the soil under- 
 goes a slow decay, and in this way is a constant 
 source for the supply of carbonic acid. This acid 
 has the power of rendering the mineral requisites of 
 the plants more soluble in water, whereby they are 
 more easily taken into the cii'culation. This office 
 performed, the acid in turn becomes the subject of 
 decomposition, and furnishes carbon to the plant. 
 This latter is more particularly the case before tlic 
 plant is supplied with leaves. 

The process of decay is much retarded by the 
 presence of any uncombined acid, hence the acids 
 are called antiseptics. 

The presence of the alkalies activates vegetable de- 
 cay, and this is more especially the case with lime. 
 I will not, at present, go into the complicated theory 
 in relation to the acids retarding eremacausis, but 
 will endeavor to explain my view of the action of 
 lime in activating decay. "VVe have seen that woody 
 fibre is composed of carbon, and hydrogen and oxygen 
 in the proportions to form water. Caustic lime ha^ 
 a powerful affinity for the acids, and althougli car- 
 bonic acid is the lowest in the scale, and will be dis- 
 placed by almost any other acid, yet when placed in 
 contact with moist woody fibre in the presence of the 
 oxygen of the air, the vegetable matter being dead, 
 or deprived of its vitality; and the temperature being 
 sufficiently elevated, yields to the decomposing pow- 
 er of the lime, and new compounds are formed; the 

carborn and the oxygen of the woody fibre form car- 
 bonic acid, which immediately combines with the 
 lime, and the hydrogen of the woody fibre combines 
 with the oxygen of the atmosphere and water is formed. 

The presence of carbonate of lime in the soil is 
 also indirectly favorable to decay. The roots of the 
 plants cultivated, and those of the weeds, as well as 
 all other vegetable matter ploughed under the sur- 
 face, are susceptible of fermentation as well as erema- 
 causis, and considerable quantity of acid of different 
 varieties is thus generated. The carbonate of lime 
 is decomposed by these acids, and consequently they 
 are hindered from exerting their antiseptic qualities, 
 and during the process of saturation Avith these veg- 
 etable acids, much carbonic acid is liberated, anil 
 being taken into the circulation subserves the same 
 purpose as that evolved by the humus. 

What do we learn from the above. First that lime 
 applied in its caustic state to the soil, must be sup- 
 plied with an acid from some source. That when ap- 
 plied in doses above the amount necessary to saturate 
 the vegetable acids in the soil, that it will prey upon 
 the humus for its supply, and that to the damage of 
 the growing crop. 

Second that carbonate of lime will equally well 
 neutralize the acids found in the soil, and that in so 
 doing, instead of consuming the humus, will come t<» 
 its aid in furnishing carbonic acid to the growing 
 crop. 

If this ii the case, well may Mr. James Gowen call 
 it a wasteful cook — when applied in "over doses." 

In the section of country in Avhich I reside it is 
 much practised to plough in lime in its caustic state 
 with the manure. I have remonstrated with the ad- 
 vocates of this process in vain. I am always met by 
 their experience of this method giving a good crop 
 of grain. 

In this section the grain is very subject to being 
 thrown out by the winter, and a good start in the 
 fall is of infinite benefit to the crop. By the process 
 above described, the ammonia is bi-ought into imme- 
 diate action, and the roots are enabled to run deeper 
 into the soil than they otherwi. e would. Tiiis samo 
 effect can be produced by the application of fertili- 
 zers containing ammonia, and at a much cheaper 
 rate, than to be subjected to carbouating fifty bushels 
 of lime to the acre at the expense of the manure. 

But we are told by Mr. AViliiam Stavely of Bucks 
 county, and others, that they have received great 
 benefit from lime. Mr. Stavely in particular says hi.-* 
 was limestone land, and worn out by cropping. I 
 presume his land is supported by limestone rock and 
 not formed from disintegrated rock. Much land 
 that lies on limestone rock does not, after severe crop- 
 ping, contain sufficient lime. This is nothing now. 

But I d) nit uaderstani Mr. Gow.m to repudiate 
 lime altogether, but only to speak against over-dress- 
 ing of quick lime. He does not warn the farmer 
 against carbonate of lime. 

I have c(mie to the conclusion that it is best to let 
 the lim'!' lay on tlie surface one year before plouj^hing 
 in, and that if thus prepared, or allowed to obtain it.H 
 acid from the atmosphere the land will bear any dose 
 without danger. I have said one year because all the 
 lime now in use contains magnesia, which is longer 
 being saturated by the atmosphere. If any plan 
 could be devised by which the limestone could be pul- 
 verized in a cheaper manner, than by burning and 
 slaking, it would be a very great improvement. 

I will take an other opportunity of speaking of the 
 ploughing in of grain crops.
