SOUTHDOWN SHEEP. 

The Engravin^rg of Sheep in our present number 
 are from daguerreotype portraits of pure Southdowns, 
 bred and owned by Joseph Cope and John Worth, of 
 this count}'. The excellence of this breed of Sheep, 
 for hardiness, compact form, easy feeding, as well as 
 the very superior quality of their mutton, is now gen- 
 erally admitted, and we are pleased to be able to say 
 that there is no flock of Downs in the country, more 
 pure in blood, and which evince more care and skill 
 in breeding, than the flocks from which these por- 
 traits are taken. The Buck figured in tlic engraving, 
 has siuce been sold to go to New York. They have 
 also sold some recently to go to Alabama, and at 
 other times to various parts of the Union. Their 
 Downs have taken several first premiums at our own 
 and the Maryland State Fairs, this season, as well as 
 in previous years, and we can recommend them with 
 confidence, knowing that tlioy have boon obtained 
 from reliable sources, and their liigh character con- 
 firmed by judicious crosses, bo|h here and from the 
 flocks of Grantham and Ellman in Great Britain, 
 which were visited by Joseph Cope himself, for this 
 purpose. Those in our engraving are only yearlings, 
 but already develope some of the good j oints of this 
 valuable breed. The artist, howe\er, has omitted the 
 black faces and legs of the original, which are char- 
 acteristic of Southdowns. We hope the daguerreo- 
 type process may become general, where itis desired to 
 obtain a real likeness of an animal without flal;ter3^ 
 Where there is no truthfulness to nature,there can be 
 no advantage ultimately to either breeder or purchaser. 
 The object ought to be to show the true form, the good 
 or bad points of the animal; not to make a pretty 
 picture for children. We have observed expensive 
 engravings in the best style of the art, in some of our 
 periodicals, certainly unlike anything in nature that 
 we ever saw either here or in England. The farmer 
 and the breeder will only appreciate these pictures, 
 when they arc true to nature, and consider nothing 
 beautiful that is unnatural. 

There are very few artists, however skillful deline- 
 ators they may be generally, who have sufficient fa- 
 miliarity with the striking points of good stock, as to 
 be able to properly sketch an animal portrait. The 
 late J. A. Woodside was v.'ithout a rival in this line. 
 Ills likenesses display the hand of a master, and were 
 so true to nature, as to be recognized at once. The 
 living subject, whether of horse, dog, cow, birds, &c,, 
 seemed before you. We have heard an anecdote of 
 his being engaged to draw the portrait of a fine cow, 
 and after it was finished the owner, anxious to make 
 her appear perfect, complained of his having given 
 her a cross look, and rather a fierce eye, observing 
 that she was the most gentle creature in the world, 
 not at all vicious. "Why, then, "it was replied, did you 
 carry a stick whenever you went near her?" Wood- 

side, ignorant entirely of her disposition, had given 
 the real expression of her countenance. 

We hope to enrich each number of the Farm Jour- 
 nal with daguerreotype portraits of tlie good stock of 
 our own and other counties through the State, and 
 shall commence, if possible, in our next number, with 
 some of the fine Durhams from the herd of Gen. Cad- 
 walader of Philad., and as they contain some of the 
 best blood now in the country, we promise our readers 
 quite a treat in such admiraV)lo subjects for study. 
 Wo are also promised portraits of Sheep and Cattle, 
 from the farm of lion. N. Ewing, Fayette county, and 
 of the superior Aldernoys of L. II. Twaddel, Philad. 
 county. Breeders of fine stock, who may wish to 
 avail themselves of this method of introducing thorn 
 before our many readers, will address us (post paid) 
 at an early date. 

The publishers of the Farm Journal wish to apol- 
 ogize for the late i.'^sue, by saying that from some en- 
 tirely unaccoun able neglect in Lancaster, the type 
 and materials have been sent Ijy peacemeal, no one 
 part complete. Even now,(17th inst.,) they have not 
 all arrived. For the future there will be more punc- 
 tuality.

Mr. Editor: â€” This immense gathering of farmers 
 and others is now dispersed, .each contemplating with 
 pleasure his successful efforts to promote its objects, 
 or witli regret his apathy and indifierence. 

Will you accept the remarks of a correspondent 
 in connection with regular reports ? If so, let us look 
 through Floral Hall and see those richest treasures, 
 Flowers and Fruits. Of the former, a very few beau- 
 tiful boquets and nrtijicials, for which thecontri!)U- 
 tors deserve praise, are to be seen. AVhy so few? 
 Do the Lancasterians not love flowers, or love them 
 so well as to keep them in their gardens or conserva- 
 tories alone? 

Evergreen trees and shru1)s in pots, beautiful ! 
 They added much to the interest of this department 
 and the contributors, I'aschall Morris & Co., of West 
 Chester, who had 120 specimens, D. Miller, of Cum- 
 l)erland county, and others, deserve the thanks of ev- 
 ery member of the Society. 

The collection of apples was not what might have 
 been anticipated. I). Miller, it is true, had lOG na- 
 med varieties and 30 seedlings; William Cocklin, of 
 York county, K'O named varieties; Casper Ililler, of 
 Lancaster county, 47 named varieties; Jonatlian Mc- 
 Willianis, 21 varieties without names; B. Garber, a 
 fine collection; Henry Kaufman, some of large size; 
 S. 0. Slaymaker, six varieties without names, per- 
 fect and beautiful ; Asahe Walker, some large and 
 fine looking; David Eyer, Pound apples; Abraham 
 Brenner, Orange Pippin; llachel Taylor, Golden Pip- 
 pins, of elegant appearance; and display from Perry 
 County Agricultural Society. 

The specimens of quinces, by J. B. Hart, Asahel 
 Walker, T. W. Brown and others, would be hard to 
 excel. Why is the Portugal quince not more cultiva- 
 ted ? A single plate of these, uniformly smooth and 
 perfect, was exhibited. To these, in connection with
