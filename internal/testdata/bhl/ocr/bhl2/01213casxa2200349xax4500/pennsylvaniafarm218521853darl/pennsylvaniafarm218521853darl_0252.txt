Diller, among the very best August pears and 
 deserves a place in every collection in this State. 
 It is named after the person on whose property it 
 grew and by whom it was most probably raised from 
 seod, one hundred years since. Tradition says he 
 brought the tree or scions from Germany; but this 
 is extremely doubtful, because of long voyages and 
 want of horticultural knowledge. It is more proba- 
 ble he brought seed of some favorite pear, planted it, 
 and raised this tree. Its growth much resembles 
 the Bloodgood, short jointed, wood reddish-brown, 
 not a rapid grower but bears regulaidy and abun- 
 dantly. Fruit of medium size, obovate irregular or 
 (jne-sided, thickening abruptly into the stalk, which 
 is an inch long and obliquely inserted. Skin, at 
 maturity, golden yellow, sprinkled, and one side 
 mostly covered, Avith light cinnamon russet. Calyx 
 mostly open, sot in a slight, smooth depression. Flesh 
 yellowish white, buttery with rich sugary luscious 
 flavor; a little gritty at the core, which is ^mall. 
 Seeds long, black and pointed.

Work for the Mouth in Flower Garden. 

Orange and Lemon Trees, Pomegranates, Lagor- 
 stremias,Abnteilous and such half hardy ornamental 
 shrubs, as have been standing out should now be ta- 
 ken up immediately, and placed in a dry cellar. Or- 
 anges and Lemons should be placed where there is 
 no danger ot frost, and to prevent losing their leaves, 
 should have plenty of light and a free circulation of 
 air in open weather. Should their leaves drop, they 
 will not^ flower the next season. Lift and pot at 
 once— Geraniums, Salvias, Heliotropes, and such 
 other plants as are t-enacious of frost. If taken up 
 with care they will reward with bloom, through win- 
 ter. Verbenas with good roots, if pottel and placed 
 in a warm room, where they will conthiue growing, 
 will keep flowering for some time, but for this pur- 

pose, it is much better that they should have been kep" 
 in pots through summer. Take up also, for bloom- 
 ing in parlor Mignionette, Neapolitan Violets, Sweet 
 Alyssum, Stock Gillys and Chinese Primrose. If the 
 ground is very dry, water well before lifting, so as to 
 have some earth adhering to the roots. AH freshly 
 potted plants, should for a few day;? be kept closely 
 shaded. 

Cut down and carry away, all such plants as have 
 been hurt by frost. As soon as Dahlia tops arc kill- 
 ed, lift the roots, cutting off within a few inches of 
 the ground. Dry them a short time in the sun, re- 
 move carefully, the earth which adheres, then invert 
 them for a few daj's, with tops down to drain off 
 moisture, after which they may be removed to their 
 winter quarters, which may be on a shelf in a dry 
 cellar, free from frost, or they may be packed in dry 
 sand. 

Lift all tender Bulbs, Tuljei-ose, Gladiolus, Tiger 
 flowers, Amarynis, &c.. and lay away as Dahlias in 
 a dry place. If not already done, plant beds of Tu- 
 lips and Hyacinths. Trench a piece of ground, en- 
 riching well with short manure. Plant the Bulbs 
 nine inches apart, and three inches deep. When 
 hard weather approaches, cover with long litter or 
 leaves. Now is a good time to divide and replant 
 Herbaceous plants. Peonies, &c. Put out seedling 
 Hollyhocks where they are to bloom. Lift Carna- 
 tions and Pinks which have been layered, and place 
 in a cool frame for the winter. Water occasionally, 
 and give fresh air in mild days. Chrysanthemums 
 if taken up carefully and potted in largo pots and 
 well watered, may be retained in bloom for a consid- 
 erable time in the house. The Lilliputian or dwarf 
 varieties which are generally much later than the 
 others, should be taken up at once and potted. They 
 bloom much finer in the house. Water occasionally 
 with Guano water, or liquid manure, to increase the 
 size of flowers. One pound of Guano, to five gallons 
 of water. Is a suitable strength. 

Take up roses for early spring Ijlooming. We re- 
 commend for this, Pink Dailies, and most of the Ben- 
 gals, Tea Gels, Devoniensis, Souvenir de Malmaison 
 and Hermosa. 

To make an attractive display of flowers in-doors, 
 early in spring, when they will be most highly valu- 
 ed, take up and place in large pots, Wiegelia rosea, 
 Persian Lilacs, Spirea lieevesu, Prunifolia. and For- 
 sythia Viridissiraa. Our native Kalmia Latifolia is 
 much esteemed in England, for early spring forcing 
 in pots. Hardy annual seeds, such as dwarf German 
 Larkspurs, purple and white Candytufts, Collinsia 
 Bicolor, ditto Verna, Clarkia Grandiflora, and Ele- 
 gans — Gillia Tricolor, should have been sown last 
 month, but if the weather keeps open, may still do 
 on a warm rich border; cover itp with leaves on ap- 
 proach of severe weather. 

For potting earth, mix well decayed sods, with 
 short manure, equal parts of each. Plants in win- 
 dows should be turned around once a week, to pre- 
 vent growing one sided. Timely hints will be given 
 how to treat plants through winter. 

Vegetable Garden. 

Dig or plough up ground for next years crop, 
 trenching witfi spado or subsoil plow. The exposure 
 to frost and alternate .roezing andthawiug.mcllowstlie 
 soil and destroys weeds and insects. Cut off Asparagus 
 tops close to the gr;)und, and clear out thoroughly, 
 all weeds. Spread manure over the bed throe inch- 
 es deep, covering slightly with earth from the alleys. 
 These should also be manured, the whole to be fork- 
 ed in and spaded in spring. Take up and secure be-
