fore severe frosts, Beets, CaiTots, Salsify, Turnips, 
 &c. Place them in moderate sized heaps out of doors, 
 covering first with straw, and then with a few inclies 
 of earth, or if cellar room is convenient, they may bo 
 placed in barrels or casks, mixing earth through 
 them and covering with sods. Have shutters or 
 straw mats at hand fur covering cold frames of Cab- 
 bages, Cauliflowers, &c. These should be inured to 
 cold, by exposing in moderate weather, covering only 
 at nights. Give air to forcing frames to prevent 
 plants from drawing. Take up Cabbages, arrang- 
 ing them in bods, and burying roots and lower leaves 
 in earth; cover with boards, straw or cornfodder on 
 approach of severe weather. Dig up Celery, and for 
 winter use, place in bods, planting the first row a- 
 gainst a ridge, then fill in earth nearly to the top, 
 then another row of Celery, leaving four or five in- 
 ches of earth between each row. Cover the out side 
 row with straw or nianure, and a good covering of 
 straw or cornfodder over the top. Manure Rhubarb 
 beds with a heavy coat, both ou plants and in alleys, 
 wliich should be dug in the latter; cover with straw, 
 litter or Cedar brush, &c. (Lettuce, Spinach, Corn 
 Salad and Parsley.) Take up Horse Radish, and 
 lay away in sand or earth for winter use. Dig up 
 Parsnips for early consumption, and place in barrels, 
 covering with sod. Collect and preserve Pea sticks, 
 Bean poles, &c. Gather up Cabbage stumps and all 
 other rubish, and hand to the manure heap. 

Sale of Imported Cattle. 

GREAT PRICES. 

The sale of the Scioto Luporting Company's Cat- 
 tle, advertised in our last papei", took place at Chili- 
 cothe, according to appointment, on the 7tli instant, 
 and for the number, wealth and spirit of the bidders, 
 and the high prices obtained for the animals, we 
 doubt whether this sale has ever been equalled in the 
 United States.

The foregoing embrace all of the recent importa- 
 tion, except one young Bull, Adam, no*^ yet recover- 
 ed from the effects of the voyage, and which is to be 
 sold within thirty days. It is at the farm of M. L. 
 SuUivant near this city. The sixteen animals sold 

amount to $21,885, averaging $1,637 each; and as 
 several were injured or otherwise defective, and a 
 majority not half grown, it must be admitted that 
 the prices obtained are without a parallel. 

It is true that a majority of tlie purchasers are 
 Shareholders of the Company, and consequently in- 
 terested in the sales, but we are assured that most 
 of the animals could have been sold almost as liigli 
 to persons not memljers of the Company, and no 
 Stockholder was under any obligation to purchase 
 in order to obtain his full share of the proceeds. 

A number of bidders were present from Kentucky, 
 and also from distant parts of Ohio, but the prices 
 went entirely above their ideas. All tiie purchasers 
 are residents of the territory embraced in the Scioto 
 Valley. Each of the individuals named as purchas- 
 er, is the representative of a company of neighbors 
 clubbed together for the purpose, except Mr. SuUi- 
 vant, and perhaps one or two others. — [Ohio Cultiva-
