Philadelphia, Oct. 19, 1852. 

To the President of the Pennsylvania Horticultu- 
 ral Society. 

The Fruit Committee respectfully present the fol- 
 lowing ad interim report: 

On the 20th of August, they received a basket of 
 the most beautiful specimens of the Tyson Pear they 
 had ever seen. They were from the grounds of the 
 originator, Mr. Jonathan Tyson, and were of an un- 
 usually large size and delicious flavor. 

From Samuel Ott, on the 2lKt of August, fine 
 specimens of the Ott, most delicious. The Julienne, 
 and the Miller Apple, a pleasant apple, of a dark, 
 crimson color. 

On the of August, a half barrel of the Bc- 

hannan Apple was received from Lewis Saunders, of 
 Grass Hill, Kentucky, accompanied by a letter to the 
 President, a description of the Bohannan, and an 
 interesting communication on tho season. These 
 Apples were unfortunately in a bad condition when 
 they came to hand. The specimens were of large 
 size, and fine appearance, but so many of them were 
 in a state of partial or complete deca}", that the flavor 
 of those that remained sound was materially impair- 
 ed. On two former occasions, however, we have had 
 an opportunity of seeing and tasting specimens of 
 this delightful apple, from the grounds of Mr. Lan- 
 dis, which enables us to endorse all that he says in 
 its favor. 

Oct. 5th — From Mr. Ilartwell, fine specimens of 
 Winter Nelis, Glout Morceau, Figue, Urbaniste and 
 Beurrfe d'Anjou, all true to name. 

Oct. 7th — From J. Warner Johnson, five varieties 
 for names, the labels having been lost. No. 1, we 
 consider Louise Bonne de Jersey. No. 2, Urbaniste. 
 No. 3, Duchesse de Angouleme. No. 4, Napoleon. 
 No. 5, the Old Jalouise.
