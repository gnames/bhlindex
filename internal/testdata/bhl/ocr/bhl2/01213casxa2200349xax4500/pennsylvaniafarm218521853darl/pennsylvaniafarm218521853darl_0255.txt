 containing most beautiful specimens of 12 varieties of

tion to announce t at he had received the first do- 
 nation in money ever presented to the Society, the 

only gifts having been a few of relinquished premiums 

and books to a limited extent, to the Library. Whilst 

other societies had been recipients of large amount.-', 

especially the Massachusetts Society, which had re- 
 ceived large donations and legacies, and some of the 

latter on anticipation, our association had not been 

so favored, although situated in a wealthy community 

He hoped that this was the beginning of a new era, 

and that our institution would be enabled to extend 

its beneficial influence. The Chair reported that _ _ __ 

Thomas P. Cope presented fifty dollars for the use of j FoVthe best specimen'in flower.to Tnom'as Robertson, 

the Society ; when, on motion.
