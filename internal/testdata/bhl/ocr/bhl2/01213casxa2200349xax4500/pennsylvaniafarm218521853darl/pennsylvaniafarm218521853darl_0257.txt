 hibited — the first premium of $5. Mr. Gordon also 
 presented a most ingeniously constructed pulverizer 
 or harrow, to which he attached a chain and roller. 
 Your Committee deems this pulverizer worthy of a 
 premium of $2. It is original in its construction, 
 and well adapted to the wants of Agriculturists. 
 Wm. Rote, of Lancaster county, presented a patent 
 bow-plow, peculiarly adapted to plowing out pota- 
 toes, and many other useful purposes on the farm.

 several very fine iron plows, simple in construction, 
 and well calculated to do good work — first premium 
 of $8. Samuel AVithrow, of Adams county, present- 
 ed a self-sharpening plow of good quality. John 
 Kennard, of Lancaster county, presented a fine self- 
 sharpening plow. Prouty & Barrett, of Philadelphia, 
 presented several very superior plows, of difiFerent 
 construction. Messrs. Samuel Plank and Jacob Bow- 
 man, of Cumberland county, presented several very 
 fine coulter and cutter sod plows, strong and well 
 made. David Wolf, of Lebanon county, presented a 
 corn plow model, and your committee regret that the 
 plow was not on the ground, as it would have been 
 justly entitled to a premium. Savory & Co., of Phil- 
 adelphia, presented several very fine self-sharpening 
 and improved plows, of different models. William 

Sterrett, of Juniata county, presented two farrow 
 ploughs, for plowing in grain. Alfred Blaker, of 
 Bucks county, presented a very fine bar shear plow. 
 Shankland, Stevens & Co., of Pittsburg, presented a 
 fine iron plow, a good article with setting cleves — 
 second premium of $5. Wm. L. Craighead of Cum- 
 berland county, presented two plows well calculated 
 for fallow ground. Jesse Pawling, of Montgomery 
 county, presented two very fine plows. Your com- 
 mittee regret that they saw no person to represent 
 the plows, as one of Mr. Rawlin<i;s' plows took the 
 first premium at the last State Exhibition plowing 
 match. 

Your committee cannot refrain from expressing their 
 regret that so few harrows, cultivators and rollers 
 were exhibited. Avhen so good an opportunity was 
 offered for honorable competition, and beg leave to 
 express their hope that at our next annual exhibition 
 a much larger display will be made. 

Your committee also feel that the exertion and en- 
 ergy displayed by our many mechanics to further 
 the, interests of Agriculturists in his many arduous 
 duties, is worthy of all praise.

 was experienced in deciding upon the awards for the

 the large number exhibited, which, in the opinion of 
 the committee, possessed nearly equal claims, so that 
 nothing short of continued use could settle their re- 
 spective merits decisively.
