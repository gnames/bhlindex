AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENTS, CLASS No. 4. 
 The Committee on Agricultural Implements, class 
 No. 4, after carefully attending to the duties imposed 
 upon them, submit the following, viz ; 

To William Dingee, York county, for best portable 
 Hay Press, §20. The same gentleman also exhibited 
 a horse power hay fork, which is, in our opinion, an 
 article of great utility, and we would strongly recom- 
 mend its use. Joseph Bruederly exhibited two shak- 
 ing forks, for which we award a discretionary premi- 
 um of $2. There were a variety of hay and manure 
 forks exhibited, all of which were neatly and skil- 
 fully made, but, as the Committee consdering 
 "Morse's" manufacture superior, from the tests the 
 exhibitors submitted them to, and their judgments, 
 they award a premium of $2. Simmons' hay-rake, 
 the only one that came under our notice, we award 
 a premium of $2. A variety of churns came under 
 our notice, and not being able to give them the prop- 
 er test as to their merits, we could but judge by ap- 
 pearance and the principle, and in doing so, while 
 others present advantages over our ordinary churns, 
 we yet are of the opinion that Savory & Co's. Ther- 
 meter Churn is the best, and award a premium of 
 $4. The variety of fanning-mills was very large and 
 excellent, it being an important item of machinery 
 to the farmer, (to separate the tares from the wheat) 
 we gave it a thorough examination, and while sim- 
 plicity in construction, changing, &c., are worthy of 
 notice, in a fan that does the work well, we regard 
 that exhibited by John Bamborough as best, and 
 award a preminm of $5. We award a second pre- 
 mium to H. & A. Stonei", for fanning-mill. of $4. A 
 premium, to Samuel Cochran, for third best fanning- 
 mill, of $3.

 " Prouty & Barrett — a diploma. 
 " Mart in Shreiner, Cumberland co.,-a diploma.

STALLIONS AND BROOD MARES. 

The Committee on stallions and brood mares, very 
 respectfully report, that they have carefully exam 
 ined the stock presented for their inspection, and are 
 pleased to state that a large number of very superior 
 horses came under their notice, indicating a decided 
 improvement since the last annual exhibition, and a 
 laudable rivalry amongst those engaged in rearing 
 this valuable stock. In our opinion, the best stallion 
 for heavy draught was the "Fire King," of the Ches- 
 ter Lion stock, owned by William C. Patterson, of 
 Alexandria, Huntingdon county. Entitled to a pre- 
 mium of fifteen dollars. 

The second best stallion for heavy draught was the 
 four vear old horse, "Bell Founder," owned by Mr. 
 Thomes Moderwell, of Lancaster county. Entitled 
 to a premium of ten dollars. 

The black stallion owned by Mr. J.Allen, of Cum- 
 berland county ; the grey stallion of Mr. W. Trego ; 
 the iron grey stallion, "Duke of Normandy," of Mr.
