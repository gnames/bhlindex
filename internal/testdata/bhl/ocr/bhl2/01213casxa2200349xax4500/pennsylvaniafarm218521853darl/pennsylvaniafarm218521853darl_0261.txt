Great praise is due to Contributors for their zeal in 
 furnishing stock, at much expense and trouble, and 
 without any desire to diminish the honor due to all 
 Contributors, the Committee cannot conclude this 
 hasty report without special reference to the excee- 
 dingly fine Stock of Cattle, furnished by Gen. George 
 Cadwalader, of Philadelphia county. Thirty head 
 of Cattle of different grades were on exhibition by 
 this gentleman, and his example is now referred to 
 for imitation by future contributors of fine stock. 
 The Committee regrets that farmers in the immedi- 
 ate vicinity of the Exhibition grounds submitted so 
 small an amount of Stock. They trust this will not 
 be found a cause of complaint at future Exhibitions.

CATTLE, NATIVES OR GRADES, WORKING 
 OXEN AND FAT CATTLE. 

The Committee on working oxen, grades and fat 
 cattle respectively report. That they were much dis- 
 appointed by the very small number of animals un- 
 der this class, submitted to their inspection. The 
 exhibition being in a county widely known for its 
 agricultural resources, it was expected that herethere 
 would have been a large representation of at least our 
 native and grade stock. A few only were brought to 
 the ground, attributable, no doubt, more to tlie fear 
 often entertained by farmers, of their stock not being 
 successful competitor?, which deters them more from 
 bringing them out, than to any actual deficiency in 
 the aninials themselves. The c;)mmittee would ob- 
 serve that the comparison of stock, attainable only at 
 these exhibitions, and the interchange of views as to 
 their several points of value for feeding, for work, or 
 for the pail, the different modes of roaring man- 
 agement, &c., are objects ivhich it is the very de- 
 sign of the State Society to promote in their schedule 
 of premiums, and they would encourage the farmers, 

especially in districts adjoining t'le location of the 
 show grounds, at least for their own benefit, to send 
 on their stock. 

Tlioy award the first premium for the best pair of 
 working oxen to Ckri.'stian B. Herr, of Lancaster co.,

 equal facility. Their weight, 4530, S15. They award 
 the second premium to James Gowcn, Esq., of Phila- 
 detphia count;/, for a beautiful pair of cattle, full bred 
 Devons, showing evidence of ability for active work, 
 combined with great endurance. For working; cat- 
 tie, probably, the Devons are unsurpassed. -SIO. Thoy

 niatta CO., for a yoke of Devons three years old, well 
 broken and of even speed, $7. For the best fet ox''/i they
