the competitors, that the awards were made with 
 much difficult3^ In consequence of this commenda- 
 ble rivalry, it was aorrced, after consultation with a 
 number of the principal officers of the society, to re- 
 commend a larger number of discretionary premiums 
 than was perhaps at first contemplated. The Poultry 
 Department is one which deservedly attracted great 
 attention, and should be liberally encouraged. 

The Committee would ask the attention of Exhib- 
 itors to the following. First, correct nomenclature, 
 and secondly, to arrange their contributions in the 
 coops, in the precise manner in which they are en- 
 tered upon the books of the Society. If those sim- 
 ple rules were observed, much labor would be saved 
 the Committee, and the Exhibition would prove more 
 interesting and profitable to the spectators.

DAIRY AND HONEY. 

The Committee on Dairy and Honey report, That 
 the exhibition of dairy products is very small, and by 
 no means such as the great importance and value of 
 this branch of Agriculture would seem imperiously 
 to require. A reference to the returns of the last 
 census (1850) shows that the number of milch cows 
 in the State, was 530,224, which, at a price of $15 GO 
 per head, amounts to 17,953,360. The number of 
 pounds of butter reported to be made that year was 
 39,878,418, which, at a price of twelve and a half 
 cents per pound, would amount to .$4,779,802 25. 
 The number of pounds of cheese made was 2,505,034, 
 which, at six cents per pound, is §150,302 04. Value 
 of both, §4,930,102. The value of butter and cheese 
 per cow, at the above prices, is only §9 29 per year. 

The Committee think the above an under estimate, 
 both in quantity and price, and have no doubt that 
 the value of the butter and cheese in this State this 
 year, is quite eight millions of dollars. It is estima- 
 ted that the dairy product of Susquehanna county, 
 as stated at their late fair, is one quarter of a million 
 of dollars. In some portions of the State, the farm- 
 ers are turning their attention almost exclusively to 
 the dairy and the rearing of stock, and they find it 
 profitable. It belongs not to this committee to dis- 
 cuss the value of the diiferent breeds of cattle for dai- 
 ry purposes, but the testimony of James Gowen, Esq., 
 (most eminent authority) as well as of many others 
 of our eminent practical farmers is in favor of the 
 Short Horned Durham and its crosses, as possessing 
 finer milking properties than any other class. That 
 the breeding of cows, with reference to their milking 
 properties is necessary, in order to proper success, 
 need not be affirmed. It is too evident. In nearly 
 all our ordinary dairies are to be found cows which, 
 while yielding considerable quantities of milk, make 
 very little butter. Every farmer ought to tost the 
 quality of every cow's milk when fouryears old. The 
 test is very simple. Strain the milk for a few succes- 
 sive days into tumblers about six inches deep. Com- 
 pare the thickness of the cream wit i that of cows of 
 established milking properties. "Weigh the niiik for 
 a few days, and churn it, or the cream from it, by 
 itself, and make a similar comparison. Many cows 
 will be turned ont of dairies by those simple tests as 
 worthless, and their places supplied by those which 
 are valuable. There are other rules given in treatises 
 on the dairy, for testing the milkingqualities of cows, 
 which the limits properly assigned to this report, for- 
 bids us to notice. 

lu a large portion of the State, no butter is packed 

for winter's use, and, as a consequence, the mar- 
 kets and tables in many of our towns, during that 
 season of the year, are supplied with an insipid, pale 
 butter, instead of a fine, fragrant, golden-colored but- 
 ter, laid down when there is a superabundance in 
 May and June. Again, the proper limits of the re- 
 port forbids anything more than a mere hint. In 
 several counties of the St.ate, the farmers sell none of 
 their butter fresh. They pack it all, and they find a 
 full price. The best dairies in Susquehanna county 
 are now selling at the farmers houses for twenty to 
 twenty-five cents per pound, and the May and June 
 butter is esteemed the most valuable. The fair yield 
 per cow, in the best managed dairies, is thirty-five ta 
 forty dollars per cow. In the counties in the vicini- 
 ty of the great cities, the farmers send their butter to 
 market almost daily, and usually obtain high prices, 
 some of their flocks of cows yielding forty to fifty dol- 
 lars per head. The importance of properly preserv- 
 ing the summer and fall butter for winter and spring 
 use, cannot be too earnestly commended to the farm- 
 ers of the State. There ought to be more profit from 
 the small dairies, and butter of a better quality ought 
 to be produced. The Committee commend the pro- 
 cess described by Mr. E. V. Dickey, of Chester coun- 
 ty, to whom the second premium is awarded, as wor- 
 thy of attention. 

The preservation of butter depends mainly upon 
 three things. 1st, the quality of the milk. 2nd, the 
 care in working out all the butter milk. 3rd, the 
 keeping the milk and butter of an even temperature. 
 These hints, thus briefly thrown out, it is hoped may 
 be of service to this interesting and highly important 
 branch of Agriculture. 

The Committee award the premiums as fallows : 

For the best butter, of five pounds, to Jonathan F. 
 Garrard, of Sharpsburg, Alleghany county, §5. To 
 E. y. Dickey, of Oxford, Chester county, second best, 
 $2. To Mrs. Margaret II. Zook, of Lancaster coun- 
 ty, 3rd best, §2. 

The specimens of butter put up by Isaac Eckman, 
 of Lancaster county, adorned with flowers and in or- 
 namented cones, was very beautiful — a splendid or- 
 nament to an elegant table, delighting the eye while 
 it regaled the taste. 

The Committee have so far extended their remarks 
 on butter, that they cannot venture to intrude any 
 upon cheese and honey. 

The premiums awarded are as follows : 

For the best cheese, they award the premium to 
 Job Hayes, of Chester county, §5, For the best ten 
 pounds of honey, to W. & S. Green, of Newtown 
 Square, Delaware county, §5. The hive of bees ex- 
 hibited by Messrs. Green, is the most perfect of any 
 which has fallen under our observation — diploma. 

The exhibition of firkin butter, Irom Susquehanna 
 county, by William Jessup, consisted of one firkin 
 June butter, laid down by Mrs. Joseph Decker. One 
 ditto, July butter, by the same. One dittv), August but- 
 ter, by Mrs. James Waldie. One ditto, SeptuMnber 
 butter, by Mrs. John Harrington. One tub of Sep- 
 tember butter, by Mrs. James Waldie. One ditto, by 
 Mrs. Hiram C. Conklin. One tub exhibited by Miss 
 Sarah M. Walker, of Woodburne, Susquehanna coun- 
 tj'. Tiieso butters arc designed for winter's use, and 
 were put up without any reference to exhibition at 
 the State Fair, and are fiiir samples of the ordinary 
 dairies of that county. Tliey are warranted to retain 
 their fineness until May next, if kept of even tempe- 
 rature and away from the air. Ti)e C<mimittee award 
 the first premium to Mrs. Jacob Decker for Junebut- 
 ter, §5, Second premium to ditto, for July butter, 85. 
 The Committee also award a premium of five dollars
