In conclusion, the Committee award high praise to 
 numerous Exhibitors of Agricultural productions, 
 whose several names and articles will be specified in 
 the general report. They cannot, however, avoid an 
 expression of regret that greater competition in many 
 particulars had not existed, but as the subject is com- 
 paratively new, in central Pennsylvania, the present 
 effort will doubtless lead to increased exertion. All 
 of which is respectfully submitted.

 following report. They have, after a careful examin- 
 ation of all the samples exhibited, award the first 
 premium of $8, to John 11. Smith, of Lancaster 
 county, Pa. The second premium of $6, to Peter 
 Roth, of York county. Your Committee also re- 
 commend a special premium to Henry Engle, of Lan- 
 caster county, of $3, for a sample of Seed Leaf ex- 
 hibited. John S. Gallic, of Lancaster, and P. G. Eb- 
 errnan exhibited fine samples of the crops of 1851, 
 but your Committee think exhibitors should be con- 
 fined to the crop of 1852, in the receipt of premiums, 
 and neither of the last named samples wei'o equal to 
 those to which premiums were awarded. John K. 
 Ilerr and James Collins also exhibited good sam- 
 ples. The quantity exhibited, though not large, was 
 generally of a good quality. Evans & Shultz, of 
 Lancaster, cxhil)ited a variety of segars, of an ex- 
 cellent quality and superior workmanship, for which 
 your Committee recommend a premium of $5. All 
 of which is respectfully submitted, &c.

SILK. 

The Committee on Silk have examined the specimens 
 of silk Cocoons, raw and reeled silk, sewing and spun 
 silk exhited, and they award to David M. Everly, of 
 Lancaster county, a premium of $5, for the best lot 
 of Cocoons, which are of the pea-nut variety, and ex- 
 cell in firmness, compactiveness and weight. To 
 Miss Harriett Summy, of Lancaster county, a pre- 
 mium of S3, for the second best lot of the same variety, 
 distinguished by the same qualities, but in a less de- 
 gree. Also, a premium of ยง3 for beautiful specimens 
 of Silk, spun from perforated Cocoons, and suitable 
 for the manufacture of Glovs or Hose. To David 
 M. Everly, they likewise award a premium of $3, for 
 the best specimens of raw and reeled silk; one of the 
 pea-nut, of 15 fibres to the thread, the other of white, 
 having 12 fibres to the thread, both remarkable for 
 their regularity and perfection. And they award to 
 to him tiiree dollars premium for the best specimens 
 of sewing silk, these are twisted and contain 160 
 fibres to the thread, and are soft, of equal thickness 
 and apparently of great strength. There are two 
 specimens, each of considerable quantity, and dyed. 
 Miss Sumy exhibited a small specimen of 18 skeins 
 of sewing silk, twisted from the raw silk, and retain- 
 ing the gum, which the Committee think is not quite 
 equal to the former. Mr. Jonas Bauman, of Phila- 
 delphia, exhibited for the Shakers of "White AVater 
 Village," Chio, a handsome specimen of raw and 
 reeled silk, of six fibres to the thread, which the Com- 
 mittee admire for softness and beauty, but as it is 
 not the growrh of Mr. Bauman, they believe they 
 have not the power to award him a premium, though 
 they commend him for the exhib ition.

FLOWERS.

 not exhibited any collection of growing flowers, nor 
 of Roses, nor of Camelias, nor any collection of 
 Dalhias, as deserving a premium. They cannot there- 
 fore award premiums, as intended by the society. 
 But certain other articles were found on the list com- 
 mitted to tLem, which though no premiums were offer- 
 ed for them, yet the Committee think deserving either 
 of extra premiums, or honorable notice thereof. A 
 good, small collection of Hot-House Plants, including 
 a fine specimen of the "Screw Palm," "Cinnamon 
 Tree," Banana Tree," "Sugar Tree," "Coffee Tree," 
 &c., exhibited by the Hon. D. B. Vondersmith, of Lan-
