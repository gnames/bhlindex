MECHANIC ARTS AND UNENUMERATED 
 ARTICLES. 

The Committee No. 28, on unenumerated articles 
 and Mechanic Arts, Report that they have discharg- 
 ed that duty. In consequence of the very large num- 
 ber of articles referred to them for examination, they 
 have with great difficulty come to the following con- 
 clusion. They would respectfully suggest to the Ex- 
 ecutive Committee, that, as great variety of articles 
 are presented by Ladies and enterprising mechanics, 
 that whenever in their powei", it would be deemed ad- 
 visable to allow as many small premiums or other a- 
 wards as they can with propriety and justice to other 
 branches of industry, but would particularly recom- 
 mend the following, viz: 

Domestic Glass Ware, by Francis H. McCush, of 
 AUegheney county, was a very pretty specimen of va- 
 riegated and fancy glass ware. We recommend that 
 a premium be awarded of '$5. A Copper Kettle by 
 C. F. Laise, of Lancaster city, was worthy of notice. 
 A Dressing Case, by Andrew W. Bear, of Lancaster 
 city, a lad sixteen years of age, is well worthy of no- 
 tice, and is deserving of a premium of one dollar.

 handsomely Stuffed Birds. Wm. C. Chamberlain, 
 of Lancaster, also had two cases of Stuffed Birds, 
 which were very beautiful. Each a Diploma. Beech-

 ted a Cloth shearing machine, which was a very pret-

 ty and highly deserving of notice. A Diploma. Miss
