The Committee also notice a lot consisting of sev- 
 eral barrels of Chemical Manure, prepared by Mr. 
 A. Poysson, of Philadelphia. They regret that this 
 gentleman was not present, to give the requisite in- 
 formation respecting this article, but from the intelli- 
 gence they were able to gain concerning it, they are 
 inclined to the opinion that it is deserving of notice 
 fro ;n Agriculturists, and for its practical effect as a 
 fertilizer. 

The Committee feel that they would fail in an im- 
 portant part of their duty did they omit to notice, in 
 the strongest terms of commendation, the very exten- 
 sive and interesting collection of Wools, exhibited by 
 P. A. Browne, Esq., of Philadelphia. 

The industry and perseverance of this gentleman, 
 in examining and elucidating this important branch 
 of Agricultural economy will, when properly under- 
 stood and appreciated by our Pennsylvania Sheep 
 Farmers, do much towards promoting a proper system 
 of breeding and management of the different varie- 
 ties of Sheep. The collection of Wools exhibited, 
 comprises above 1200 specimens, from vaious parts of 
 the world. About 400 of them are from a collection 
 of Saxony Wool, presented to 'Mr. Browne, by^the 
 King of that couutry, embracing varieties from the 
 principal Sheep growing districts of the Kingdom. 
 There are upwards of 100 varieties from various parts 
 of the United States, among which the Committee 
 are pleased to find many from our own Pennsjdvania 
 Sheep Farmers, which, for fineness of staple and ex- 
 c^illence of quality, will compare favorably with those 
 from any other part of the world.
