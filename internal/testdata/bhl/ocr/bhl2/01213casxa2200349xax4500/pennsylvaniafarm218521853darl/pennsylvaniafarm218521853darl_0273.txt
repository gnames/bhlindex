 cows," to the attention of our readers. It is one of 
 the most valuable and practical articles that we have 
 seen for a long time. 

Poultry Apfency. 
 Within the past twelvemonth, we have been lite- 
 rally flooded with orders for Shanghaes and other im- 
 proved fowls, which orders we have endeavored to 
 have filled ; not from our own stock, but from other 
 sources. As this demand has, for some time past, 
 been largely on the increase, and as our future resi- 
 dence will be in Philadelphia, we here take occasion 
 to announce that we have made arrangements to sup- 
 ply, at moderate prices, every varie*^y of fowls now 
 in demand, and that we pledge our word to pay th& 
 most scrupulous attention to the purity of any we- 
 may send to those who feel inclined to favor us with, 
 their orders. Letters addressed to us at C. Rogers'" 
 Seed and Implement Store, No. 29, Market Street,. 
 Philadelphia, will meet with prompt attention.
