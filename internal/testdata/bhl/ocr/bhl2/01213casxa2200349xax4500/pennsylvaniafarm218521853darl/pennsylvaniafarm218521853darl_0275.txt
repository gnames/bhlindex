of the ladies, and ingenuity and skill of the mechan- 
 ics of Montgomery county. 

The display of fowls was not equM to that of last 
 year, although a few of the cages contained credita- 
 ble specimens, while that of sheep and swine was 
 much finer. 

The attendance was larger, and the warmest inte- 
 rest manifested in the examination of the various 
 animals and articles on exhibition. The Address of 
 the Rev. Samuel Aaron, delivered on the afternoon 
 of the last day, was, with one or two trifling excep- 
 tions, sound and practical, and wa,s listened to with 
 marked attention by a very large audience. We have 
 to thank our friends in Montgomery fur many kind 
 attentions, and only regret that it is not in our pow- 
 er to repay their kindness by a more complete re- 
 port than this. 

Berks County lExhi'bition. 

Anxious to witness the first efforts of the stout far- 
 mers of Berks, to awaken an increased interest in be- 
 half of Agriculture, we paid a visit to the beautiful 
 and thriving city of Heading, on the occasion of the 
 first Exhibition of the Berks County Agricultural So- 
 ciety. The arrangements for the Exhibition, although 
 not as complete as those of Bucks and Montgomery, 
 were, notwithstanding, all that were needed. The 
 enclosure for cattle, iniplements, &c., was situated in 
 the northern f/art of the city, and quite a number 
 of excellent cattJe were exhibited, amongst which 
 were some belonging to Wm, B.obison, of Furnace, 
 Mr. Bennedura, of Womelsdorf; Mr. Keim, of Bead- 
 ing, and others. 

Of Horses, we thought the display better. Several 
 very fine Stallions were exhibited, as well as a num- 
 ber of fine brood mares, geldings, &c 

The implement department was pretty well repre- 
 sented, the principal contributors being the Messrs. 
 Keim, of Reading. 

Of Fowls there was a vei'y creditable display,show- 
 ing the interest felt in the county in this department 
 of agricultural economy. 

But the glory of the Exhibition consisted iu the 
 Horticultural contributions, and the department over 
 which the latlies presided. In the first the display 
 of fruits and flowers was very fine. Many of the 
 specimens were seedlings of merit, and deservedly 
 attracted great attention. We hope our friends in 
 Berks will enable us to give greater publicity to those 
 fine seedlings than they have hitherto attained. 

The ladies did their part nobly. The specimens of 
 worsted and needle work were numerous, and many 
 of them very fine; and in several other departments 
 their handiwork was plainly visible. 
 We congratulate the friends of agriculture in Berks, 
 upon the bright prospect before them. Another year 
 will enable them to stand side by eide with Bucks, 
 Montgomery', Chester, and other counties, which have 
 hitherto maintained the lead. 

Improved Poultry. 

In another part of the Journal will be found the 
 report of the first Exhibition of the Pennsylvania 
 Poultry Society, which will doubtless be read with 
 interest. Ever since the establishment of the Farm 
 Journal, we have endeavored to impress upon the 
 minds of our farmers the importance of greater at- 
 tention to the rearing of fowls; and we are pleased 
 to observe that it is at length becoming a matter of 
 serious inquiry with them. 

To the most casual observer it must be apparent 
 that the raising of poultry will very soon become a 
 highly important branch of the farming interest The 
 steadily advancing prices of beef, pork, &c., together 
 with the fact that our population is increasing more 
 rapidly than the supply of these meats, all point 
 clearly to the fact, that at no distant day, the supply 
 will not equal the demand,and that as a consequence, 
 none but persons of large means will be able to in- 
 dulge in their use so frequently as is now the case. 
 With the rise in the price of beef and pork, there 
 must be a corresponding rise in the price of poultry; 
 and if at present j. rices it can be made profitable, is 
 not the prospect ahead encouraging? We think so. 
 During the past month we have had frequent occasion 
 to pass through the Philadelphia markets. Curiosity 
 prompted us to inquire the price of poultry. We 
 found that a pair of ordinary fowls (which, clean 
 dressed, would not have weighed more than five 
 pounds) commanding from eighty-seven cents to one 
 dollar, while larger ones were sold at corresponding- 
 ly high prices. The demand appeared to be equal to 
 the supply, and we were informed that purchasers for 
 the New York market were anxiously awaiting an op- 
 portunity to secure every fowl that could be had, e- 
 ven at these prices. Now, if the common Dung Hill 
 chicken at six months old, weighing two or three 
 pounds cleaned, will command eighty-seven cents per 
 pair in Philadelphia.would not the larger varieties — 
 the Shanghae, Cochin China or Chittagong — weigh- 
 ing, at the same age, twice as much, command double 
 the sura? Simple arithmetic will demonstrate this to 
 dullest comprehensions. 

But, cries one farmer, " the prices for these fancy 
 fowls are too high now, we will go upon the good old 
 system a little longer, and when we can buy at the 
 prices we now pay for the little Dung-hillp,it will then 
 be time enough to stock ouryards with them." "Pon- 
 ny-wise and pound-foolish," economy. Five years ago 
 the same thing was said, and yet good fowls cannot be 
 purcliascd at any lower rates now, than then. Again, 
 tlie idea that the Shanghaes are more fancy fowls, 
 intended only as an ornament to fanciful gentlemen's 
 poultry yards, is a wrong one. We are perfectly sat- 
 isfied of the (iict that they arc the most profitable of 
 all fowls, and that they must, from the very necessity 
 of the case, eventualh' Eupercedc every other upon 
 the premises of our farmers. There are those >i ho
