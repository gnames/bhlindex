assert that they are not hardy enough for our climate. 
 The intense cold of last winter ought to satisfy the 
 most incorrigible skeptic upon that point. We can give 
 a case in point, during that bitter cold ■weather, one 
 nin-ht, by some neglect, all of our little stock of fowls 
 were prevented from securing their usual places of 
 sheltef. In the morning,the Bantums were frozen stiff, 
 while the Shanghaes,with a single exception, escaped 
 unhurt. 

We might go on and enumerate what we con- 
 ceive to be their many other good qualities; but bav- 
 ins done so on a former occasion, we will close our 
 remarks by simply stating, that we conceive it to be 
 the interest of every farmer who estimates his poultry 
 yard as he should, (and as we think all will do before 
 many years;) to discard the mischievous little Dung- 
 hills, and supply their places with the stately Shan- 
 ghaes. 

Pennsylvania Poultry Society. 

The first exhibition of this Society was held in the 
 city of Philadelphia, on the 24th, 25th, and 26th of 
 November. The display of fowls was highly credit- 
 able, embracing some of nearly every known variety. 
 The Shanghae, or Cochin China, however, were by 
 far the most numerous and fine. We were pleased 
 to observe the deep interest felt in the matter, no^ 
 only by those who were exhibitors themselves, but 
 by the thousands who visited the exhibition. 

The expectations of the Society in regard to the 
 extent of the display having been greatly exceeded, 
 ( the arrangements were not as satisfactory, perhaps, 
 as they would otherwise have been, yet every thing 
 passed off well, and we think augured well for the 
 future prospects of the Society. The following per- 
 sons were the principal exhibitors : 

The principal contributor is Dr. James McClintock, 
 President of the Society. There are others who have 
 contributed many splendid specimens, but Dr. Mc-

Where are the Berkshiresf 

We hare greatly regretted that this very valuable 
 breed of Hogs has gone so out of fashion, and be- 
 come so scarce. There is a fashion or periodical ex- 
 citement in the matter of farm stock, as in other 
 things. New breeds are sought after with great eager- 
 ness, and in the thermometer of public opinion, and 
 under the excitement of their being new, are often 
 run up far beyond their real value. When the fever 
 subsides they as often fall far below it. This is the 
 case, we think, with Berkshire Pigs. We have rear- 
 ed and fed a great many of this breed, and consider 
 them the very beat we ever owned, Jor certain pur- 
 poses. They are not exactly the farmer's hog,as they
