such a forcible demonstration of our superior intelli- 
 gence and civilization will be exhibited by those long 
 42's. "VVe presume the intention of the Government is to 
 show them the operation of the Telegraph, &c..first,and 
 if they are notconvinced,to operate with the Paixhans. 
 Much good as will doubless result from commercial 
 intercourse with that country, it is greatly t.j be hop- 
 ed a resort to force may be unnecessary. 

BOOK NOTICES. 

Wo hare before us, the first number of the IT vol. 
 of the Wool Grower and Stock Register, published 
 at Rochester by D. D. T. Moore, and edited by T. C. 
 Peters, single copy 50 cents, and at reduced prices 
 to clubs. Devoted as the agricultural Press neces- 
 sarily is, to a wide range of topics, we are pleased 
 that such important interests of the country, as wool 
 growing and rearing of stock are to have so able a 
 special advocate as the above paper. It is printed in 
 neat style, with good illustrations, and the editor is 
 evidently at home in his treatment of his subject. 
 We think such a paper is wanted, and wish it the 
 best success. 

Moore's Rural New Yorker, a weekly newspa- 
 er, published at Rochester, N. Y., and conducted by 
 D. D. T. Moore. This is well supplied vrith original 
 communications on agricultural subjects, and illus- 
 trations, combined with a variety of literary and sci- 
 entific matter, and news of the day, adapting it to 
 the home circle and fire side of the farmer especially. 
 It is very ably conducted, and has a wide circulation. 

Raising Calves. 

For the following receipt for raising calves, we are 
 indebted to John Lac, formerly an English Farm Man- 
 ager, but for many years past, has had the entire 
 charge of the Durham stock and farm attached to 
 the estensive boarding school institution, of A. Bol- 
 mar, of this borough. It is one of those abort, but 
 valuable and practical receipts which, based on long 
 experience, both here and in England, is calculated 
 to confer a large amount of good. Many of us, with 
 a fine fall calf, have allowed it to go to the batcher, 
 on account of the expense and uncertainty of getting 
 it safely through a long winter. J. L. informs us 
 that in England, fall calves are preferred, for raising 
 in this method, and will bring £2, while a spring 
 calf would bring but 25 shillings. The mixture pro- 
 motes health, and keeps them in good thriving con- 
 dition thr(jugh the first winter, and at a year old, 
 they are larger and stronger than those dropped in 
 the spring. He has never known them to scour while 
 taking it. 

Recipe. — Mis one pint flaxseed with 4 gallons wa- 
 ter. Simmer over stove for 2 or 3 hours ; when it 
 will be found quite ropy, and on getting cold, will 
 be a thick jelly. Give a calf, according to age, from 
 one pint to a quart twice a day. mixed with a little 
 skimmed milk or Indian gruel. When it gets a /ew 
 weeks old, the milk may be omitted, if not conveni- 
 ent. 

Horticulturist. — This well known periodical, has 
 been sold to J. Vick. jr., of Rochester, and will here- 
 after be published by him at that place. He has se- 
 cured the services of P. Barry as editor, well known 
 as an extensive Nurseryman, and author of one of 
 our best works on Pomology. We predict for the 
 Horticulturist under its new auspices, a successful 
 career. It could not have fallen into abler hands. 

NEW YORK AGRICULTOR. 

A weekly Journal in large Newspaper form, under 
 the above title, is about being published by A. B. 
 Allen & Co., N. York; also the New York Farm and 
 Garden, a monthly Journal by the same pai-ties. 
 We also observe "Tqe Country Genteeman" an- 
 nounced as forth coming, published by Luther Tuck- 
 er, a weekly publication, devoted to Agriculture and 
 the Rural arts generally. These signs of the times, 
 indicate a spirit of enquiry abroad in relation to ag- 
 ricultural matters which is healthy and encouraging. 
 The more of such periodicals the bettor. Supply 
 creates demand, and there is yet a wide field to be 
 occupied. 'Tis but a few years since thei-e wore but 
 two or three agricultural papers in the Union, and 
 now there are probably a dozen in New York State 
 aloner. 

Northumberland Agricultural Societj'. 

We are pleased to observe that our friends in 
 Northumberland heldtheir first Exhibition last month, 
 and that it was of the most encouraging character. 
 Every department was well represented, and the in- 
 terest in the future prosperity of the Society, is gen- 
 eral, throughout the country. Many difficulties were 
 encountered in the getting up of the Eshibition, but 
 with indomitable energy, these were all triumphantly 
 surmounted, and the result was a display at onco 
 gratifying and encouraging. We bad fully intended 
 being present, but other engagements prevented. 

We hope and believe that the sturdy farmers of 
 Northumberland will not stay their laudable efibrts, 
 but press on the good work they have so triumphant- 
 ly begun. We have not the space for a more extend- 
 ed notice, which we can but regret. The hope was 
 indulged that we should be favored with a general re- 
 port from the Secretaries of the difi'erent Societies, 
 in time for the present number, but in this we have 
 been disappointed. Our friends in the various coun- 
 ties in which Exhibitions have been held, which.it 
 was not in our power to attend, will, wo trust, bear 
 with the meagre reports we are enabled, under the 
 circumstances, to present.

"No, he's half hunter and half setter. He hunts 
 bones when he's hungry, and sets by the fire when 
 he's satisfied."
