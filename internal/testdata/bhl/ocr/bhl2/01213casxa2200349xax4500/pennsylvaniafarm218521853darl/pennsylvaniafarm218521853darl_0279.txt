WINTERING STOCK— CUT FEED.

Wintering Stock. 
 Mr. Editor — Although there was a good crop of 
 hay secured the past season, and considerable old 
 hay summered over, the ftirmer should, nevertheless, 
 practice strict economy in feeding it out to his stock. 
 Our cattle and sheep came to the barn about three 
 weeks earlier than usual, which will make a long fod- 
 dering time, unless the spring opens more favorably 
 than usual, for getting our stock to pasture. Most 
 farmers have more or less coarse fodder, such as poor 
 hay, corn butts and the like, which, some make it 
 their practice to feed out, exclusively, the first part 
 of the winter ; but I have practised differently, be- 
 lieving that stock of all kinds require as good keep 
 and attention, the first part of the winter, as any time. 
 Cattle and sheep like a change in their diet as well 
 as man, and when kept in good condition, they seem 
 to relish a foddering of meadow hay, corn-stalks, and 
 straw occasionally ; but if fed entirely on such fod- 
 der the first half of the winter, they will lose iu flesh, 
 and be apt to come out in the spring in a mean con- 
 aition, in spite of English hay. I know that some 
 farmers say, their cattle wont eat poor hay, unless 
 they starve them to it, so they feed out their corn-fod- 
 der first, then their swamp and meadow hay, and 
 feel relieved when it is gone. I think corn-fodder 
 worth as much as common stock hay when fed in 
 connection with it, but to compel cattle to live whol- 
 ly on such fare, is absolutely cruel, as it makes their 
 teeth sore when fed for a length of time. A better 
 way is, to give cattle one foddering a day of corn- 
 butts, and that at the last feeding at night, and if 
 they have a pretty stout allowance given them, they 
 will eat it up neai'ly clean before morning. Some 
 suppose, all that is necessary in wintering stock is, 
 to place a sufficient amount of fodder before their cat- 
 tle and sheep, no matter when, how, and where ; but 
 this is a mistake. Every one who has the care of stock 
 should make it his practice to feed regularly, for the 
 animal system requires it ; and instead of throwing 
 large, solid flakes of hay before them, it should be 
 carefully pitched off the mow and well shaken, to de- 
 prive it of dust, and laid down lightly and tempting- 
 ly by them in small quantities, and fed as often as 
 they eat it up clean. The number of times cattle 
 should be fed during twenty-four hours, depends 
 somewhat on the quality of the fodder ; the poorer the 
 hay, the better must be the attention. Some farmers 
 will make their stock thrive as well on meadow hay 
 and rough fodder, as others will on English hay, and 
 it is said of them, "they have a peculiar knack to 
 make their stock look well ;" now, this "knack" con- 
 sists in good attention- Stock of all kinds, should 
 be fed under cover through the winter, in cribs or 
 racks, instead of feeding in the yards or out upon 
 snow-drifts, to be trodden under foot, or blown away 
 by the north-west wind. But with all our care and 
 attention in feeding, our stock will not thrive well 
 unless we provide comfortable barns and stables, and 

Eay attention to the cleanliness of their food ; I have 
 een into barns so open, that a person would be in 
 some danger of loosing his hat on a windy day, and 
 80 filthy, that one could hardly move without coming 
 in contact with the filth of hens, turkeys and geese. 
 It is useless to describe the appearance of stock un- 
 der such treatment. I have often wondered how a 
 man could turn up his nose on observing a mote in 
 butter, or sit and toast his shins before the fire, when 
 at the same time, his cattle are shivering in his rick- 
 etty barn, and his fowls roosting over their heads, 
 without thinking of their miserable condition. Many 
 farmers are negligent with regard to water for their 
 stock, of which there should always be a good supply 

in the yard, either by a spring, or a well with a goo 1 
 pump. I wish to say here, t have used the chain 
 pump, and for supplying water for a stock ot cattle; 
 I consider it second only to running water. There 
 are some good farmers who keep their cattle in the 
 barn most of the time, only letting them out long 
 enough to drink, and to cleanse their stalls ; but I 
 doubt the utility of the practice, believing it is for the 
 health of the animal to enjoy the influence of the sun 
 and air, in moderate weather, and it is also necessary 
 that they have exercise ; but in cold, stormy weather 
 they should be kept under cover. 

Farmers, as a general thing, pay too little attention 
 in feeding, and selecting that breed of cattle and oth- 
 er farm stock which is nice and hardy; those who 
 are more particular in these respects, are they who 
 get the greater profit for their steck. — E. M. Dunbar.

Cut Feed for Farm Stock* 

The advantages of cutting fodder for stock, seem 
 to be well settled, though by no means geneially ap- 
 preciated. Farmers are proverbially slow to learn, 
 and it always a difficult matter to overcome their pre- 
 judices in favor of old habits. When a novel system 
 of culture is proposed, they are sure to raise the cry 
 of "book farming," and every new fangled implement 
 they consider a design upon their pockets. The straw- 
 cutter is not a recent invention, but it had not acqui- 
 red much popularity, until within a few years. Its 
 merits are such that we are glad to see it becoming 
 more and more common, and we believe that the day 
 is not far distant when it will be deemed as essential 
 as a plough to every cultivator of a dozen acres. 

It costs a farmer much hard libor to secure fodder 
 for the winter, and it is his duty, as well as his inte- 
 rest, to make it go as far as possible, by giving it out 
 in that form in which it will be most closely eaten up, 
 and will do the animals the greatest amount of good. 
 It would be thriftless in the extreme for him to waste 
 what he has purchased by so many hours of patient 
 drudgery. He ought to study economy in all things, 
 — in the barn as well as in the kitchen. What he 
 saves in this way is clear gain. For instance, if, by 
 a little management, he can keep his stock on straw 
 and cornstalks, and so have three tons of hay to sell 
 in the spring, he adds something like thirty dollars 
 to his yearly profits — enough to buy him a new suit 
 of clothes. We do not wish him to stint his cattle 
 in their rations, for that would be miserable policy 
 — costing him more to bring them up in the summer 
 than it would have done to keep them all the time in 
 good condition. 

The straw-cutter is an admirable invention, and 
 its use in the barn or stable should never be dispens- 
 ed with. Cattle and horses will eat "cut feed" with 
 a vastly improved appetite, and it will digest, (given 
 in this form,) much more readily than otherwise. 
 We recommend the cutting of fodder for all kinks of 
 stock — after a thorough trial of this mode of feeding 
 — certain as we are that animals can thus be kept at 
 considerable less cost, the food does them more good 
 for being cut, and they will thrive very much better 
 upon it than upon the old fashioned mode, while a 
 much less quantity of material will be required to 
 satisfy them. In point of economy and convenience 
 both, those who have yet to try the experiment, will 
 find that a palpable saving can bo made at once, and 
 continually, by adopting this means of feeding stock.
