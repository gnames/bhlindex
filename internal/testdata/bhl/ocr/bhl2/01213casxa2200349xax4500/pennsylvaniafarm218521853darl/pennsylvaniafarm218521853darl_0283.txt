Gueiion's Blethod of Choosiug Milch Cows. 

"We somewhat wonder that this book is not more 
 generally known among farmers. A system which 
 approaches comparative exactness in enabling one 
 to tell the milking qualities of a cow, the amount of 
 her milk, its quality, the time she will be dry — a 
 system which is applicable, also, to a calf, or a heif- 
 er, and enabling you to judge from certain external 
 marks whether she is to be valuable or worthless for 
 the dairy, is surely, if true, one of the most valuable 
 discoveries of the day. Is it true ? We answer with- 
 out having much practical experience ourselves, that 
 in this, probably the best dairy district in the Union, 
 and which has contributed to make the excellence 
 of Philadelphia butter proverbial, it is helltved in 
 fully and practised by some of our largest and 
 best dairymen, in selecting their cows. That it 
 should appear absurd, and be inexplicable as regard^i 
 the connection between certain quirls of the hair and 
 the capacity for deep milking, is no argument when 
 arrayed against facts. Some of our friends have 
 proved it fully. One in particular, has given it much 
 attention, and made himself acquainted with the 
 method, and although engaged in business in no 
 ways connected with agriculture, is called upon by 
 farmers Irom various quarters, to purchase their 
 cows, and we have known of one case of his attend- 
 ing a vendue of cows, and refusing to bid because 
 they had not the right marks, to have the effect of 
 their going off at a very low figure, and making a 
 difference to the owner of a very considerable sum. 
 The anual value of butter and cheese, made in this 
 State for 1850, was $4,930,102, estimating the butter 
 at 15 cents, and the cheese at 6 cents per pound. 
 Dividing the number of pounds of butter by the num- 
 ber of cows, we find an average yield for each cow 
 of only about 75 pounds of butter per annum. This 
 small amount may be partly owing to their not being 
 in all cases so kept and treated as to yield their full 
 capacity, but no doubt chiefly arises from their not 
 possessing the property of deep milking. x\.dmitting 
 the system of Guenon to be correct, what may we not 
 estimate the increase of dairy products in our own 
 State, if it were generally known. ]Many a calf goes 
 to the butcher that would make a valuable milker. 
 Many a calf is raised to make almost a worthless 
 cow. This new method guides the farmer in each 
 case. The book is in pamphlet form, and can be for- 
 warded by mail, and may be obtained at the agricul- 
 tural warehouse, in this borough. It was critically 
 examined and reported on by several scientific and 
 agricultural societies in France, who suVtjected the 
 author to the most rigid tests, and their reports were 
 uniformly favorable, and he was presented with me- 
 dals of approbation. We hope our farmers will read, 
 examine, and prove for themselves. We give below, 
 a report of one of the local agricultural societies, 
 ■vrhich is but the counterpart of many others. 

AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY OF AURILLAG. 

At its general meeting of the 26th oi May, the 
 following Report was presented and read on the sub- 
 ject of the experiments which I had been called upon 
 to make : 

Report. — Gentlemen: M. Francis Guenon, a hus- 
 bandman of Libourno, has established a method, 
 deemed by him infallible, by means of which, upon a 
 mere inspection of any 3Iilch Cow, she may be judg- 
 ed of, and we may know the quality of her milk, the 
 quantity of it which she is capable of yielding, and 
 also the time during which she can give milk. 

A Committee appointed by the Agricultural Socie- 
 ty of Bordeaux, and composed of several well inform- 
 ed agriculturists, and of a very distinguished Profes- 
 sor of the veterinary art of the Department of Gironde, 
 had already borne testimony, after putting it to nu- 
 merous tests, to the eflScaciousness of the system of 
 M. Guenon : and the result of its obsei'vations had 
 been published in a very remarkable report, address- 
 ed to all the Agricultural Societies of France. 

Your Society, considering that this discovery might 
 be of high importance to our country, which derives 
 its income ehiijfly from the product of Milch Cow.", 
 entered into correspondence with its author, and 
 gladly accepted his obliging offer to come to Au- 
 vergne and subject his method to the test of experi- 
 ment. 

Yesterday, the 24th of May, M. Guenon arrived 
 at Aurillac, and immediately proceeded with the 
 members of your Committee to the Veyrac farm, be- 
 lonjiing to the President of the Society. He exam- 
 ined with the utmost care the fine cow stable of that 
 domain, which embraces one hundred cows of the 
 best varieties that we possess. He then began his 
 experiments upon a number of cows which were pre- 
 sented to him, and which had designedly been se- 
 lected from among the best, the moderately good, and 
 the most indifferent of the establishment. Upon 
 each of these separately, M. Guenon pronounced 
 with precision, both in regard to her daily yield of 
 milk, and to the time during which she continued to 
 give milk after being got with calf. We must ac- 
 knowledge, gentlemen, that his decisions correspond- 
 ed almost invariably with the statements obtatned 
 from the person in whose charge the cows are. The 
 only variances we had to notice were some very slight 
 ones in regai'd to the quantity of milk. On this point 
 we must call your attention to the fact that the cows 
 of that establishment are always fed high, upon clo- 
 ver or other artificial grasses, which considerably 
 augment the quantity of milk ; and that this may 
 have caused the mistake of M. Guenon, which con- 
 sisted in his pronouncing the yield to he a little less 
 than it really is. It is to be remarked that he was to- 
 tally unacquainte<i with the usages of the country in 
 regard to the feeding of cattle. 

In order thoroughly to convince your Committee 
 of the reality of the discovery, M. Gu6non made us ac- 
 quainted with the different signs upon which his 
 method rests. With reference to these signs, which 
 are external and apparent, and stamped by the hand 
 of Nature upon each animal, he has established eight 
 classes or families, that C(miprehand all the vari- 
 eties of the cow found in the various Provinces of 
 France. Each class is divided into eight orders ; and 
 each of these orders into three sections, according to 
 size, aa being high, of medium height and low. 

According to the numerous observations of the au- 
 thor, all cows belong to some one of these classes or 
 families, and take their place under some one of the
