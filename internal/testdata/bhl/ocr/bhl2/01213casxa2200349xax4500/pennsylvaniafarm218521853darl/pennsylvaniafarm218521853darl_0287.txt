the different lengths of time, "which even the same 
 kind of lime may require for its saturation, if placed 
 nnder different circumstances. This is particularly 
 the case, when the lime contains large quantities of 
 magnesia, when it is exceedingly slow in absorbing 
 the carbonic acid even when spread on the soil, and 
 this is probably the cause why magnesia in lime was 
 for some time considered injurious, altogether, for ag- 
 ricultural purposes. Some fourteen years ago, when 
 this notion was quite prevalent — tlie writer of this 
 article being desirous of settling this question concern- 
 ing the injurious effects of magnesia in lime used for 
 agricultural purposes — happened to visit a quarry in 
 Be>ks county, the lime from which was used largely, 
 (say from 30 to 40 bushels to the acre) without the 
 least injurious effect. On inquiry about the lime 
 from an adjacent quarry only a few rods distant, it 
 was stated that it was not used for the same purpos- 
 es on account of its containing magnesia. Specimens 
 of the limestone were procured from both quarries. 
 They differed in appearance by their color, the repu- 
 ted raagnesian being of a light grey color, while the 
 other was of a dark blue. By analysis they both 
 were found to contain the same, and and a very large 
 proportion of carbonate of magnesia, (44 per cent.) 
 It was thus evident that the preference of the one o- 
 ver the other could only be due to its blue color, caus- 
 ed in this, as in similar cases, by the presence of a 
 very small portion of carbonaceous matter (less than 
 one-half of one per cent.) It proved, however, con- 
 clusively,that with proper precautions, even such high- 
 ly m.agnesian lime is applicable to the soil with equal 
 benefit. 

Before leaving this subject it may, however, not be 
 without interest to state, that another and en- 
 tirely different use has by some been assigned 
 to lime in a caustic state. This use depends on 
 the property of caustic lime to decompose clay and 
 similar minerals associated with it in the soil, when 
 mixed with fhem in the moist state, by which the po- 
 tassa, and perhaps also phosphoric acid, which they 
 always contain, are liberated, or at least put in such 
 a state of combination as to be taken up readily by the 
 plants. If this view be correct, so that it should be 
 possible to apply it for this purpose with advantage, 
 as this effect could not be produced by it as carbonate, 
 it is evident that it would be necessary to apply it 
 In as caustic a state as possible, and abundantly. It 
 must, however, be admitted, that on account of the in- 
 jurious effects which Mr. Go ven has so ably contended 
 against, it should be used for this purpose with hesi- 
 tation, for instance, only on entirely worn out soils, 
 for which the best time would be in the fall, owing to 
 the constant state of moisture during the winter. 
 This same property of lime might also suggest the ex. 
 periment of slacking the lime with water to a thin 
 paste, and then mixing it with a proper proportion of 
 clay, 80 as not to render the mass too hard for break- 

ing, when dry, as the same effect would be still more 
 enhanced by a moderate burning of the materials, it 
 is not improbable that certain clayey limestones, such 
 as are frequently found in the coal-measures, might 
 be preferable for agricultural purposes; but they 
 would require particular care in burning, as too high 
 a heat would probably impair their slacking proper- 
 ties, as also diminish the desired effect.

 Blight in Pear Trees. 

Some popular writers on the blight of pear trees, 
 attribute as one cause, freezing of the pap, particu- 
 larly where trees make a very vigorous growth late 
 in the season, and do not mature the wood perfectly. 
 If this reasoning be correct would it not be proper 
 to remove, at this season, with the knife, all imma- 
 ture branches of late growth ?

[We have no doubt that the alternate freezing 
 and thawing of our open winters is the frequent pre- 
 disposing cause of pear blight, causing the sap ves- 
 sels to distend and burst, and also that there is a 
 greater liability in immature wood to be affected by 
 these changes, and which may sometimes be prevent- 
 ed by the plan suggested above, but this will not af- 
 ford perfect security, as blight occurs frequently 
 where there is no late autumnal growth, and does not 
 invariably occur where there is. Prevention is, how- 
 ever, easier than cure, as when it has once comment 
 ed, it progresses very rapidly, and nothing but the 
 free use of the pruning knife, below the parts affect- 
 ed, can save the tree. The presence of the disease 
 is often indicated the latter part of winter by discol- 
 oration and shrivelled appearance of the bark, which 
 may be stopped from going further,' by the use of the 
 knife before the ascending sap in the spring has be- 
 come mingled with that of the diseased .parts, and 
 extended into the general circulation. 

Any cause which suddenly checks or interfere* 
 with the continuous growth and vigor of the pear 
 tree, tends to produce blight, and which, in other 
 trees might merely stunt the growth or produce some 
 transient injury. We have known a fine lot of seed- 
 lings, in the seed bed, to turn black, and die off in a 
 few days from a sudden change of weather, and we 
 have had blight to occur, owing, as we thought, to 
 being transplanted from a very rich soil to a poor 
 one, and vice versa. We have heard of its also oo- 
 curring from excessive and injudicious pruning, and 
 from the premature dropping of the leaves in mid- 
 summer, owing to a long continued drought. Any 
 thing, as before observed, which affects the health 
 and vigor of the tree, is apt to manifest itself in the 
 form of what is called blight. The loaves turning
