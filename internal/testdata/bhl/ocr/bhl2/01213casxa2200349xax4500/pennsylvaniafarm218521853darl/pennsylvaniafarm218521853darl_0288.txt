black and the presence of fungi, which have been 
 observed, we always considered to be merely the 
 effect of a previously diseased condition, and not the 
 cause of it. The instinct of insects, by a law of na- 
 ture, always are led to prey upon every kind of dis- 
 eased or decaying animal and vegetable life. The 
 remedy we have to offer is chiefly by way of preven- 
 tive. Let the ground be well subsoiled before plant- 
 in", which will enable the roots to push down, and 
 render the tree less liable to be affected by changes 
 of temperature. Plant on high ground, with north- 
 ern exposures, which will retard the circulation in- 
 duced by a premature spell of mild weather, in mid- 
 winter or early spring. Adopt the plan of low heads, 
 so as to shade the trunk or shield it from the injuri- 
 ous action of the sun's rays, by straw tied around, 
 and above all, keep the ground constantly mulched. 

The pear tree seems, constitutionally, more tender 
 than other fruit trees, and any thing to promote its 
 health and vigorous growth, (we do not mean forced 
 and over luxuriant) will enable it to repel the causes 
 usually producing blight. We believe our native 
 seedlings are less liable to it than foreign varieties, 
 as is also the pear on quince, which is one cause of 
 this mode of growing it increasing so rapidly in pub- 
 lic favor. We shall be obliged by any facts or ex- 
 periments on the subject of pear blight from our cor- 
 respondents, throwing any light on the cause or rem- 
 edy for this great drawback to pear culture.]

Mr. Editor:— 

The sale of the imported cattle, by 
 the Scioto Company, comes up to the Holland tulip 
 mania, when 4000 gilders was paid for one bulb. It 
 appears, a Mr. Reneck spent §4,335 to improve his 
 stock of cattle — a snug little sum to buy a good farm 
 with, that will maintain a whole family. The im- 
 portation of foreign cattle has become, of late, a 
 source of an unfair speculation. It has taken conside- 
 rable money from farmer's pockets, without any sub- 
 stantial benefit for it. My opinion is, that the late 
 imported cattle have very little, if any, improved or 
 increased our stock of milk and butter, or improved 
 the quality of meat. Of this latter quality the Dur- 
 ham breed is vei-y inferior to our own domestic breed, 
 which is a succulent, interlarded meat, while that 
 of the Durham is dry and coarse. I hope the col- 
 umns of your journal are open to a free discussion 
 that the pro and contra may sift out the merit of my 
 assertion, or bring out such positive facts as will 
 disprove it.

 Editor of the Farm Journal: — 

I think there can 
 be little doubt that the new Evergreen of your Harts- 
 town correspondent is the Taxus Canadensis, or 
 dwarf American Yew. 

Ilis description tallies exactly with the appearance 
 of that plant as I have seen it gi-owing in abundance 
 on tlie Conewago, the Codorus, and the Juniata. 

If I am correct he will find it covered, in the fall 
 of the year, with waxy,red berries, about the size of a 
 large currant, of an oval shape, having a sweetish 
 taste, and a slight flavor of turpentine.

 The amount of eggs sold during the same year at
