whole time, and become 80 firmly compacted in the 
 outer passages as to withstand any reasonable amount 
 of mere pulling force employed to extract it. In 
 these cases the life of the foetus has in all probability 
 been suddenly destroyed, and the uetrus has contrac- 
 ted to expel what has become a comparatively foreign 
 body, before the external passages have become suf- 
 ficiently dilated to allow its free expulsion. 

If abortion take place during the early weeks of 
 gestation, the foetal membranes (commonly called 
 ■cleansings,) not having formed a firm connection with 
 the uterus, are usually expelled along with the foetus. 
 In the majority of cases occurring at more advanced 
 periods, the cleansing is not expelled; this is partly 
 owing to its firm attachment to the uterus, and part- 
 ly to its own want of development and deficiency of 
 healthy tone in the uterus to effect its evacuation. 
 This retention is often productive of much distress 
 and injury to the cow, and as decomposition com- 
 mences in the membranes on their separation from 
 the foetus, they are the continued source of a most 
 offensive odour and discharge. 

There are cases in which all these premonitory 
 symptoms are seen, but, instead of being followed 
 by abortion, there is a gradual arrest of the discharge, 
 the belly of the cow slowly and almost imperceptibly 
 ■diminishes in size, the quantity of milk is not lessen- 
 ed, the general health of the animal continues good, 
 and after a time even shows a disposition to fatten; 
 it will also be observed that she is never in heat, and 
 that the external organs of generation bocome small 
 and firm. Here, death of the foetus has taken place, 
 but its expulsion has been prevented, most likely by 
 want of sufficient dilation of the uterine neck, or by 
 a deficiency of tone in the uterus itself. We have 
 known instances of this kind, in which the foetus has 
 been retained from fifteen to eighteen months after 
 the parent had connection with the male, and was 
 only detected in the uterus when the cow was slaugh- 
 tered, after being fattened. The foetus, under these 
 circumstances, is so much altered in external appear- 
 ance, as to present little resemblance to its natural 
 form,and its internal structures become converted into 
 a dry, brownish mass, commonly possessing but lit- 
 tle smell. These changes appear to be natural pro- 
 visions made to effect such an alteration in the dead 
 foetus as will allow its retention in the uterus with the 
 least inconvenience and injury to the constitution of 
 the parent. In some other instances, when the pre- 
 monitory symptoms of abortion are not followed by 
 expulsion, there will be a recurrence of temporary 
 fits of straining for weeks, and even months, accom- 
 panied by a continued discharge of varying color and 
 consistence; this occasionally contains foetal bones, or 
 portions of them; the larger and heavier bones are 
 retained for a considerable period, being sometimes 
 found in the uterus on slaughtering the cow after she 
 has been fed. 

Causes of ABORTioy. 

The causes of abortion are various; but from ex- 
 tended observation and inquiry into their operation, 
 and in order to generalize their consideration, we 
 propose to consider them under three heads: — 

I. Causes which act directly upon the foetus, its 

membranes, or the uterus itself. 

II. Causes 0/ a constitutional character. 

III. Causes which, influencing the system or a part 

of it, operate through it upon the uterus. 
 I. Causes which act directly upon the fetus, its 
 membranes, or the utei-us itself. — These may also for 
 the most part be considered mechanical causes, con- 
 sisting, as they chiefly do, in injuries inflicted on the 

foetus or the organs containing it. A cow, for in- 
 stances, which has been severely gored by another 
 cow, or if she has been running or leaping violently, 
 or subjected to any other severe exertion to which 
 she is unaccustomed, is very liable to cast calf, and 
 the more so if she be some months advanced in ges- 
 tation. A cow which has had hoove, or distension of 
 the paunch by gas, very frequently slips her calf. 
 The effects of the injury in these cases consist in a 
 forcible displacement ol the uterine contents, possi- 
 bly with separation of the foetal membranes from 
 their connections, to such an extent as to derange the 
 nutritive processes and cause the death of the foetus. 
 In abortions consequent on blows, the injury is some- 
 times inflicted so directly upon the foetus as to cause 
 its immediate death; in abortion consequent upon 
 hoove, the distended stomach has so forcibly com- 
 pressed the uterus and its contents by driving them 
 into the pelvic cavity or other constrained position, as 
 to bring about the same result. These mechanical 
 causes are mostly accidental or the result of careless- 
 ness on the part of those having charge of cattle, 
 and on the whole, the number of cows effected by 
 them is comparatively small; hence there are some 
 grounds for the prevalent opinion that, if merely 
 one or two or a very Jew cows in a stock cast their 
 calves, the cause is one of an accidental and mechani- 
 cal character. In the human female ulceration of the 
 OS uteri is a frequent cause of abortion. So far as we 
 know, however, regarding the cow, this has not, as 
 yet, been satisfactorily shown to be a common cause, 
 although it is quite possible that, from the difficulty 
 attendant upon making an examination in the part 
 affected, disease may exist here much more frcquentr 
 ly than is supposed. 

II. Causes of constitutional character. — In some years 
 there is a singular inaptitude in cows to conceive, al- 
 though they regularly take the bull at every recur- 
 ring period of heat during the season. If these do 
 not depend on scxtual impotency of the bull, they 
 must be considered as cases of abortion. In the e- 
 vent of their being dependant on sextual inefficiency 
 in the male, it will be found that all, or nearly all the 
 cows having connextion with him fail to conceive, 
 and other cows in the same neighborhood, and proba- 
 bly in the same stock, who have taken another bull, 
 are not effected in the same manner. If, from a- 
 mong a number of cows having access to the same 
 bull, a fair amount of conception takes place, and a- 
 bortion (or want of conception) is seen in others, as 
 seen by oestrum retuning at the expiration of the 
 three weeks subsequent to connection, it is fair to in- 
 fer that that the fault does docs not lie with the male. 
 It is a singular fact that some few bulls.in cows which 
 conceive by them, beget twins, and in other cows fail 
 to produce any offspring. Some bulls will be very 
 prolific one season, and seem almost destitute of pro- 
 creating power the next, although, to all appearance, 
 the sextual appetite is as energetic as formerly. 
 Some males are not good 8tock-getters,in consequenc* 
 of the too great number of cows they are required to 
 serve. The above facts show that the male seed or 
 semen varies in its conditions in the same animals', as 
 well as it does it different animals, and that all cases 
 of apparent early abortion do not depend on sexual 
 deficiency in the female. In cases, however, where 
 it is known that the males are in themselves prolific, 
 the oestrum will still continue to recur in females 
 having connection with them. This is frequently 
 seen in hot and very dry summer weather, and ap- 
 pears in some way connected with it. It must be re- 
 membered that at the period of oestrum, there is an 
 increased quantity of blood determined to the ova
