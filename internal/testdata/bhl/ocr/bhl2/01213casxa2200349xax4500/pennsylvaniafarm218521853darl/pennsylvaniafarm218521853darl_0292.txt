ABORTION IN COWS— COMPOST. 

Deckmber, 

riea, uterus, and, as is visibly seen, to the vagina, 
 and by the animal in heat rambling about, or proba- 
 bly rearing on other cows, the excitablity of these 
 parts is so additionally increased as to exercise on 
 the male seed an inHuence unfavorable to conception. 
 The male, too, in many instances in very hot weath- 
 er, for various reasons, is sexually less competent 
 than at some other times. The female sexual appe- 
 tite is most perfect and most regular in its periods of 
 return during the months of spring and earlier part 
 of summer; these seasons seem to favor its develop- 
 ment, and it frequently happens that cows which calve 
 in autumn or winter do not take bull until the follow- 
 ing spring. 

What is called "high breeding" also seems to in- 
 duce such a state of constitution in animals, as in 
 course of time to predispose them to abortion. One 
 of the most eminent breeders of short-horns in Scot- 
 land informs Mr. Cuming, a veterinary surgeon re- 
 siding in this vicinity, that when he has got a section 
 of his stock brought to a high pitch of perfection as 
 regards feeding or milking properties, the animals 
 are almost sure to cease breeding, either by not tak- 
 ing the bull at all, or by aborting, most commonly 
 by the two conditions combined. He adds, also, that 
 the best preventative he has found, is to Avork the an- 
 imals in plows or harrows like oxen. This is a very 
 instructive fact, and seems, so far as it goes, to con- 
 firm the opinion that when the art of breeding has 
 been pushed to such a successful extent as to produce 
 animals of great perfection, nature seems to set lim- 
 its to their further propagation. Subjecting animals 
 to labor, as above stated, may act favorably on the 
 procreative powers by operating as a kind of tax or 
 counterforce on the extremely artificial state of con- 
 stitution induced by high breeding. It is always ea- 
 sier to breed from inferior animals of all kinds, than 
 from those of a superior class, and their periods of 
 gestation, as well as of parturition, are passed through 
 with less danger to mother and offspring than is the 
 case in those more highly bred. Thus, we not unfre- 
 quently see a very perfect cow, or a number of cows, 
 put to an equally perfect bull, and are disappointed 
 to find that pregnancy does not follow. In such cas- 
 es, as these certain '■'points" and '■'■qualities," as they 
 are termed, already exist in such a state of perfection 
 in the male and female, that sexual connection fails 
 to ensure any further advance; nature can do no 
 more, and there must be limits somewhere. In rela- 
 tion with the system of high breeding we must re- 
 member that various collateral circumstances are to 
 be considered, which materially influence the consti- 
 tution of the male and pregnant female. These ani- 
 mals, for instance, are most highly fed from birth, 
 are carefully and warmly housed, and have every at- 
 tention bestowed which can favor their rapid and 
 perfect maturity; they are descended from ancestry 
 which for generations has been equally well attended 
 to, and which was all excellent stock in its day; in 
 fact, they have, as it were, been gradually approach- 
 ing limits beyond which art cannot further command 
 the resources of nature. If, hoAvever, cows such as 
 just named are put to inferior or cemparatively "ill- 
 bred" bulls, they will lor the most part conceive, and 
 the perfect male animal will beget stock in cows much 
 inferior in "blood." Wild animals very rarely abort 
 or fail to conceive; not having been subjected to the 
 same modifying influences which artificial interfer- 
 ence entails, they maintain a uniform standard con- 
 sistent with those capabilities of propagation which 
 have never been forced beyond the natural or original 
 conditions of their constituiion. ° 

A cow (and especially a young one)which has cast 

her calf once,is very likely to do the same again, and 
 usually at about the same period of gestation. To 
 such an extent does this liability exist, that some an- 
 imals abort for many times successively, and even 
 without any apparent cau.-e beyond that which, to a 
 common observer, appears to depend on habit. In 
 tne human female this periodical or repeated abor- 
 tion is also very usual, and most difficult to overcome. 
 It seems owing to a peculiar disposition in the uterus 
 to evacuate its contents, when, in consequence of 
 their development, they have produced an amouut of 
 distension bayond which the organ containing them 
 has been unaccustomed to extend. Thus it is that 
 cows having carried several calves to the full period 
 of gestation, although afterwards subjected to abor- 
 tion, are less liable to become habituated thereto than 
 are young animals which caet their first calves. In 
 the latter case the uterus never has expanded to its 
 full capability; and second, pregnancy is disposed to 
 empty itself at about the same period, and under the 
 same amount of stimulous as it did before.

Compost Heaps. 

From The Michigan Farmer we collate : "The val- 
 ue of yard manure depends upon two conditions; 
 1st, the manner in which it is made and preserved, 
 and 2d, the state in which it is applied to the soil." 

It should be borne in mind that the most valuable 
 proportions of the manure of barnyards consists of 
 the gasses that are at all times liable to escape into 
 the atmosphere, and of salts which are washed away 
 with every rain. So that after it has laid exposed in 
 the yard half a year, a large part of its enriching 
 qualities are gone. In the best agricultnral districts 
 cellars are constructed under the stables with trap 
 doors into which all the litter is thrown and all the 
 liquid manure runs mixing with alternate layers of 
 muck, or swamp earth. 

"The following analysis shows the superior value 
 of sheltered manure over that exposed in yards.

He prefers shelters or sheds constructed in a cheap 
 style and if even covered with straw and the sides 
 boarded; manure may be preserved in them for 
 years but advises in this as in all things what is 
 worth doing at all is worth doing well, and is the 
 cheapest in the end. 

"They should adjoin the stables, that the manure 
 might be easily wheeled into them with barrows ; 
 and a platform will need to be erected on each side, 
 resting upon arms morticed into the posts, upon 
 which to wheel the contents of the stables, and dis- 
 tribute from end to end of the building. No water 
 should ever enter this building except in the form of 
 urine, unless it should be found necessary sometimes 
 to reduce the temperature of the manure by applying 
 water. If the soil is dry within the shed, it should 
 be shoveled up and mixed with the manure of the 
 stables. With the addition of a coat of ashes occa- 
 sionally, this makes a powerful manure. In this 
 shed is to be deposited all the rough materials which
