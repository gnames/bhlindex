The claim is for the mode of adjusting the cutters 
 by means ot the adjusting plates. This meat cutter 
 is a very simple one, and it is not liable to get out of 
 order. All the parts can be made strong, so as to 
 endure for a long time. It is worthy of the atten- 

Turuips, Carrots, Etc. Their Inorganic Composi- 
 tion. 

According to the analysis of Professor Way, a crop 
 of 20 tons of bulbs or roots, and 4 tons of leaves ot 
 turnips, mangold wurtzell, and carrots, will respec- 
 tively withdraw from the soil, or, in common par- 
 lance, to exhaust it, to the extent hero set forth, viz :

From the above, it may be seen that turnips, man- 
 gold wurtzel and carrots, remove from the soil similar 
 inorganic constituents, and in not dissimilar propor- 
 tions to those required by the potato, as described in 
 our present number. It may also be observed that 
 potash, phosphoric acid and lime, in the proportions 
 to form super-phosphate of lime, sulphuric acid, in 
 about the proportion used in the Improved Super- 
 phosphate of Lime, to fix the volatile alkali, and so- 
 da and chlorine, as they exist in ommon salt, are 
 the great leading requirements ; and for these crops, 
 ammonia in the form of a sulphate, seems entirely 
 sufficient in soils but moderately charged with or- 
 ganic matter, provided the inorganic constituents, 
 named above, be present in the proper proportions 
 and conditions. This will show the chemical agri-

tion of those engaged in the business of mincing 
 meats, vegetables, &c., and for private families it is 
 also a commendable machine; it will save a great deal 
 of long and arduous labor to those families who use 
 no other machine than a common mincing knife.

 at his residence in Pennsylvania. 

This Machine can also be obtained at the Ag- 
 ricultural AVarehouse in this borough. 

nips, or nearly an equal measure of carrots, may be 
 raised from an acre supplied with Improved Super- 
 phosphate of Lime, not exceeding in cost five dollars; 
 while similar results would not be attainable from 
 the use of six times that amount of barnyard manure 
 alone, without increased quantities of phosphoris 
 acid, sulphuric acid, and potash. — Working Fanner. 

Artificial Stone Fronts ou Houses. 

A great number of houses are now built with 
 coarse brick fronts, which afterwards receive two or 
 three coats of boiled oil, and are then covered with 
 a coat of peculiar mastic cement, which is composed, 
 wo are told, mostly of dried sand, some boiled oil, 
 some rod lead, and a little plaster of Paris. This 
 cement resembles moist sand when put on, but it 
 sticks well, and in a short time becomes as hard as 
 freestone, which it greatly resembles. This plaster 
 is streaked off in blocks, and a building so covered 
 looks like one built of hard brown polished freestone. 
 We have heard objections made to such buildings, 
 but not one by a person who had taste and experience 
 in architecture. This cement does not scale ofi"; it 
 endures and forms a thorough coating of artificial 
 stone. The only objection worthy of note, urged 
 against them, that we have heard, is this — "after all, 
 they are not so good as brick buildings, which are 
 no shams;" these words, we have remarked, for they 
 appeared in print in a daily paper in our city, but 
 the objection urged against the artificial stone fronts 
 can be as strongly urged against the painting of 
 any building. Paint is put on to preserve and beau- 
 tify, and so is the artificial stone cement. — ledger.
