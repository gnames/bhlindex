December, 

average crop ofaboutiico m ill Iqji five hundred ikousand 
 bushels, wliich meets with ready purchasers during 
 the months of September, Octobler and November; 
 but the farmers there, continuing to sow the seed 
 each year of the previous crop on the same land, the 
 quality of the grain is deteriorating: this is of great 
 importance both to the raiser and consumer, as the 
 lieaviest, brightest, and cleanest Barley always com- 
 m mds the best price and readiest sale in the market. 
 The present time is conceived to be a favorable one 
 for the introduction of its culture in our own State, 
 and its becoming a staple article in our market, 
 whereby the sum of five hundred thousand dollars, or 
 more, now annually transmitted by the Brewers of 
 this city of New York, would be enjoyed by the ag- 
 riculturalists of our own State. 

The entire adaptation of the climate and soil of 
 Pennsylvania to the cultivation of Barley — the in- 
 creasing demand in this city, as well as the neigh 
 boring ones of New York and Baltimore — the new 
 facilities that are opening for its transportation from 
 all parts of the State to markets where it finds cash 
 purchasers, all unite as strong inducen.ents to the 
 agriculturalists to turn their attention to its produc- 
 tion. 

Should any further information be desired, it will 
 be cheerfully furnished by addressing either of the 
 undernamed, from whom seed may be procured.

Method of making Butter on the Farm of Wm. Jessup, 

Montrose, Susquehanna county, Pa. 

The milk cellar is deep, cool and well ventilated, 
 being provided with shutters to the windows, so as to 
 exclude the sun when necessary ; it being desirable 
 to keep the milk and butter of an equal temperature. 
 The milk is strained in tin pans and stands about 36 
 hours. The churn is a common barrel churn, worked 
 by an upright dasher, and moved by a dog power. 
 Cost of power and churn, $13. The milk is churned 
 jvery morning. The butter, on being taken from the 
 churn, is worked until all the butter-milk is out. A 
 half ounce of pulverized rock salt is then added to 
 the pound, worked in, and it is left ior twenty-four 
 hours, when it receives a second working, and is 
 then packed in firkins and tubs. This is the usual 
 method pursued by the Susquehanna county dairy- 
 men. They learned from the Orange county dairy- 
 men. 

Mr. Dickev's Method. — This butter was made in 
 a dairy of twenty cows. 

The process of manufacturing it is this : After the 
 milk is strained, it is set away, in the pans, which 
 are surrounded by spring water. In each pan is put 
 about one gill of sour milk, (which is kept for the 
 purpose,) which causes fermentation, and hastens the 
 sep iration of the cream. The pans are allowed to 
 remain thirty-six hours before skimming, and no lon- 
 ger Then the cream is taken ofi" and put in large 
 tin cream pots, where it remains, immersed in water, 
 until time for churning ; being well stirred at each 
 addition of cream. We churn twice a w3ek, by horse 
 power — hence the cream for churning is three daya 
 collecting for the other four. The cream is strained 
 into the churn at a temperature of 50 degrees, and 
 churned about one hour. We never allow the gas 
 which is set free in the first few revolutions of the 
 churn, to escape— thinking, that b^' retaining it, we 
 improve the flavor of the butter. When the butter
