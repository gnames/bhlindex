contains nearly three times as many oxen as Ohio or 
 Pennsylvania. New York has 178,909 ; Ohio, G5,381 ; 
 Pennsylvania, 61,527 ; Missouri, 111,208, which pla- 
 ces the latter next to New York in this kind of stock. 

Swine. — It is pretty evident that many American 
 farmers think more of hogs than of sheep, for their 
 hogs out number their sheep by nearly ten millions. 
 This is a singular fact, and in the judgment of many, 
 indicates a badly cultivated state which so greatly 
 prefers the Hesh of swine to that of sheep, to say 
 nothing of the superiority of wool to hair. Over 
 thiry million hogs, (30,315,719) are a sufficient stock 
 to render pork and bacon making as it really is, a 
 very important branch of American husbandry. 
 Tennessee takes the lead in this department, keeping 
 nearly four times more swine than sheep. Of the lat- 
 ter, the census gives her only 811,591 ; but of hogs 
 she claims 3,114,111, Kentucky has 2,851,163. In- 
 diana is ahead of Ohio in the pig line, having 2,268,- 
 776 ; while Ohio is content with 1,964,770. 

Value of Live Stock. — The value of live stock in 
 the United States is returned at §543,822,711. Of 
 this large sum, New York claims $73,570,499 ; Ohio, 
 $44,111,741, and Pennsylvania, $41,500,053. If 
 we add the value of live stock, farm implements and 
 machinery, to that of farms, the whole investment 
 is found to be $3,962,353,395. If to this be added 
 the usual increase of two years, and the estimated 
 value of the slaves engaged in agriculture, the whole 
 amounts to five billions, or five thousand millions of 
 dollars. 

Nevr York Milk Trade, 

The number of farmers engaged in the milk busi- 
 ness, according to the New York Evening Post, to 
 whcih the following facts are due, is little over 300, 
 and the number of cows possessed by them a little 
 over nine hundred. These, at fifteen dollars each, 
 will come to §135,000, and the land necessary for 
 their support, of three acres to an animal, will 
 amount to twenty-seven thousand acres. The value 
 of horses engaged in the distribution of the milk, is 
 forty-five thousand dollars ; the horses connected 
 with the transportation of country milk alone, travel 
 daily twice as far as from N. York to Liverpool. 
 There are three hundred wagons worth a hundred 
 dollars each. Ten thousand cans are used, valued 
 at §35,000. The loss for wear and tear of these 
 is great, and estimated at about five per cent, on the 
 profit of sales. 

Two hundred and fifty companies and single deal- 
 ers are estimated to receive milk from the country, 
 sell from 200 to 6000 quarts daily. Many hotel res- 
 taurants and boarding houses make contracts with 
 the farmers, and get their milk from them directly at 
 three and four cents a quart. The sum paid for pure 
 milk last year in New York, was over one million 
 eight hundred thousand dollars ; about one-fourth 
 of which was paid for the water witti which it was 
 diluted. The amount of the milk and water was 
 ab'jut thirty-one millions and a-half quarts, and 
 about one hundred and forty-six thousand dollars 
 were paid for transporting it. 

"What has been spoken of comprises about one- 
 third of the article consumed, and is called pure 
 country milk ; the other two-thirds are composed of 
 the produce and swill of the grain stables of New 
 York and the vicinity. The number of cows thus 
 fed is fifteen thousand. Their value is less by twen- 
 ty-five per cent, than country cows ; but after being 
 dry and fatted, if not enfeebled by the disease so 

ed 

incident to such cattle, they will bring nearly as much 
 it is said, as grass-fed cattle, and are probably serv- 
 ed up at tables with no suspicion of their history. 
 The cows fed on grain and swill are estimated to be 
 worth one hundred and fifty thousand dollars ; and, 
 though proportionally less in value, yield a profit 
 about two-thirds greater than that realized on the 
 sale of the pure country article. The swill milk is 
 adulterated about one-fourth more than the country 
 milk. The number of quarts daily produced by 
 these establishments, which undergo a remarkable 
 increase in the hands of the hucksters, may be esti- 
 mated at one hundred and eighty thousand quarts 
 daily. This is three millions seven hundred thousand 
 yearly ; which, at four and a-half cents, amounts to 
 nearly three millions of dollars. 

The number of persons one way or another engag- 
 in the distribution of this milk in New York, Wil- 
 liamsburg and Jersey City, may be set down at twelve 
 hundred, at weekly wages of about six dollars each. 
 Horses connected with it are about eight hundred, 
 worth eighty thousand dollars; and wagons, cans, 
 &c., one hundred thousand dollars more. The total 
 value of carts, horses, cans, other utensils and cows 
 in city and country, concerned in the product and 
 distribution of both kinds of milk is estimated at 
 nearly six hundred thousand dollars. The total an- 
 nual receipts from its sale may be reckoned at six 
 millions, as follows : 

Pure country milk, - - - - $1,350,000 

Pure swill milk, 2,550,000 

Water, chalk, magnesia, molasses, &c., 1,250,000 

§6,050,000 

The last item shows an immense sum paid for wa- 
 ter, though it is commonly celebrated as the free gift 
 of heaven. If to this be added what is paid for ice, 
 and by the inhabitants of New York for the Croton, 
 it will be found that few articles are more expen- 
 sive than water, covering though it does three-fourths 
 of the surface of the earth. In its simple state, the 
 largest amount of milk is consumed by infants and 
 children; and when its deleterious nature is consid- 
 ered, their extraordinary mortality can excite no 
 wonder. But the great proportion of the milk sold is 
 probably used in cookery and the manufacture of 
 confections ; of which there is an immense consump- 
 tion, especially in the summer. One of the largest 
 saloons in New York is reputed to _ have converted 
 five hundred quarts into ice cream in a single day 
 last summer. 

On the whole, the million and a quarter annually 
 paid for the water, molasses, chalk and magnesia 
 mino-led in this drug, for so it then becomes, is prob- 
 ably laid out at a better bargain than the two mil- 
 lions and a half for the product of the swill. 

An Intelligent Horse. — Some years ago, the cit- 
 izens of Centreville, Indiana, were often amused by 
 the conduct of a horse, when, with others, he was 
 turned into the barn-yard to be watered. One day, 
 approaching the trough, and finding it empty, he 
 seized the pump handle, to the surprise of the wit- 
 nesses, between his teeth, and pumped water suffi- 
 cient for himself and the other horses. Having thus 
 begun, he was allowed, when so inclined, to wait 
 upun himself and companions afterwards. But it 
 was observed that he always drove the other hursea 
 away until he had quenched his own thirst, after 
 which he pumped for the rest.
