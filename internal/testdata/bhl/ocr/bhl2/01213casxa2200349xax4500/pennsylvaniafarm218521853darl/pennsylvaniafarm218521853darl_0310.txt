CORN SHEIirCR. 

The accompanying; engraving represents a Corn 
 Sheller invented by William Reading, of Flemington, 
 N. Y., and for which he obtained a patent 13th of 
 July last. The above is a sectional view lengthwise. 
 B is a toothed cylinder 7h inches in diameter and a- 
 bout 4 feet long, and is placed in the centre of an 
 iron cylindrical casing b, 15 inches in diameter and 
 4 feet long. This cylinder and casing are supported 
 in a frame in a horizontal position. There is a space 
 of some 3 J inches every where between the outer sur- 
 face of the shelling cylinder and the inner surface cf 
 the casing which makes room for the free action of 
 a mass of corn while it is operated upon by the cyl- 
 inder. The corn is admitted into the machine through 
 a good sized hopper a, placed at the end over the 
 driving pulley d, where there is a piece cut out to ad- 
 mit it. An aperture is left at the opposite end, at the 
 rising side of the shelling cylinder, through which 
 the cobs are discharged, the size of which opening 
 should be varied according to the condition of the 
 corn to be shelled. This is readily done by a piece of 
 sheet iron, or stiff leather, being lastened by one end 
 to the machine, and allowing the other end to be 
 turned, more or less, over the aperture as the case 
 may require. The proper rate of speed for the cyl- 
 inder is seven or eight hundred revolutions per min- 
 ute, much less speed will not answer, and too much 
 will break the grain; there are four rows of teeth d, 
 etanding three-eighths of an inch out from the surface 
 of the cylinder b, and set 1^ inches apart in the row, 
 each row winding one-forth the way round it, which 
 carries the cobs out of the sheller. An opening is 
 left in the bottom of the casing from end to end, in 
 which is placed a small toothed cylinder c, upon 

which the corn falls and is carried out of the casing 
 through a small space upon each side of it. sufficient- 
 ly large to allow shelled corn to pass, but to prevent 
 the cobs; it is turned slowly, by the gearing e and_/". 
 This cylinder may be dispensed with, and slots (cut 
 in the bottom of the case half an inch wide and 4 
 inces apart, running one-fourth the way round the 
 case) may be substituted, which will discharge the 
 corn. 

The principle of this Corn Sheller consists. In op- 
 erating upon a large mass of corn at the same time, 
 with the whole surface of the shelling cylinder; and 
 keeping the largest portion of this mass along the 
 ascending side of the cylinder, which forms an elas- 
 tic, self-adjusting bed for the cylinder to operate a- 
 gainst, and using no rest of any kind, (other than 
 that found by the ears and cobs,) and as the space 
 between the cylinder and casing is large, it gives free 
 play for the ears of corn to be properly adjusted by 
 it, making the action free from any stationary obstruc- 
 tion to the ears; and their own gravity the principal 
 resistance to its action; consequently it will wear 
 much longer and run lighter than any other corn 
 sheller in use, considering the rapidity with which 
 it performs its work. 

This machine is capable of shelling 80 bushels of 
 corn per hour with one horse power. The ears of 
 corn are thrown promiscuously into the hopper a 
 with scoop shovels or baskets, and it effectually sheila 
 them without regard to their size, and discharges the 
 cobs separate from the shelled corn without breaking 
 cobs or corn.

 tural Warehouse, West Chester. See advertisement
