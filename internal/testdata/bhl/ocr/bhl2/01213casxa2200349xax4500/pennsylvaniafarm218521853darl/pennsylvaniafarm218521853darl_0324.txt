Fig. 1. Glout Morceau. (Gloo. Morso:) Fleraish va- 
 riety, fruit rather large, Tarjing form, but usually ob- 
 tuse oval, and tapering towards the crown, surface 
 green, becoming pale greenish j'ellow when ripe, 
 stalk moderately stout, an inch or more long, and 
 somewhat sunk in a small regular cavity; calyx 
 large, usually with open divisions, set in a moderate- 
 ly deep basin. Flesh white, fine grained, and smooth 
 in texture, buttery, very melting, with a rich sugary 
 flavor without acid. Ripe in December. 

We have fruited this variety this season, on Quince 
 stock, and there can be no two opinions as to its be- 
 ing of the very finest quality. It makes a beautiful 
 pyramid on that stock, is a very vigorous grower, and 
 â€¢we have found an early and prolific bearer, and al- 
 together one of the most desirable varieties. It is 
 easily recognized by its pale, ash colored bark. It 
 is said not to be so fine on Pear stock. 

Fig. 2. Winter Nelis. This is a Flemish Pear, and 
 yras originated about twenty years since, by M. Ne- 
 lis, of Mecklin; size medium, roundish obovate, oftrn 
 slightly pyrifoim, with a neck small and short, surface 
 yellowish green, much russeted, stalk an inch and a 
 quarter long, bent, cavity narrow, calyx, stiff, short ba- 
 sin, shallow. Flesh yellowish white, fine grained, but- 
 tery, very melting, rich, sweet or slightly vinous, per- 
 fumod, aromatic; in perfection in December, and keep<8

till the middle of January. This is also one of the 
 very best of pears, and has no superior. It or the 
 preceding might be preferred, according as the taste 
 o slightly vinous or sugary flavor predominated. 
 Downing says it occupies the same rank among win- 
 ter Pears, as the Seckle among autumnal varieties. 
 It will not do so well on Quince without double work- 
 ing, but when so treated produces finely. We had 
 about a dozen Pears this season on a double worked 
 tree, about five feet high, which were larger and finer 
 specimens, than any we saw at the different exhibi- 
 tions. The tree is of rather slender, straggling growth, 
 with somewhat pendent branches. 

We hope the meeting at Harrisburg on the 18th, 
 to establish a State Pomological Society, will not be 
 forgotten, and that there may be a full representation 
 of Pomologists from different parts of the State. 
 Pennsylvania contains, we believe, as fine seedling 
 Fruits as any other State. These have been too long 
 overlooked, and require the concerted action of a 
 State Society, to bring properly before the public. 
 Che regular notice of the time and place of meeting 
 was published in our last month's number. 

In the account of the Bucks County Exhibition in 
 last number, 1500 visiters should read 15,000.
