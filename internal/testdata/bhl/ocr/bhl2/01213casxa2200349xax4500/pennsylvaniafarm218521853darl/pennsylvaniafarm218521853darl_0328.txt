Mr. Editor : — 

A fact of small importance to some, 
 but perhaps of advantage to others of your readers, 
 came under my observation a few days since. While 
 husking out my corn, one of my hands, who wished 
 to get a few ears of the eight rowe i kind fur seed, 
 ascertained by finding two ears on one stalk, that 
 one of them was of the eight rowed, and the other 
 of the twelve rowed variety; and by farther observa- 
 tion I found that out of thirty stalks, each bearing 
 two good full grown ears, thirteen of them were of 
 a mixture, the lower car being invariably the fullest, 
 containing generally twelve rows and the upper one 
 eight rows. This corn was formerly of the common 
 yellow eight rowed variety, but now after eight years 
 cultivation on the farm, it has run into ears of ten, 
 twelve and fourteen rows. There are many farmers 
 in this section, who think that the eight row corn is 
 hardier and of better quality, and with the idea that 
 "like begets like," are careful to select none but that 
 kind for planting; but the above fact renders it alto- 
 gether superfluous. As to its being of better qual- 
 ity, it is my opinion that it has no advantage over 
 larger ears of the same kind of corn.

Case of a broken leg, that had been amputated by 
 Professor John Tindall. 

"In 1828,1 was sent for to sec a three year old heif- 
 er, that had broken her leg above the fetlock joint. 
 This case had been attended by another person lor 
 ten days previously, who amputated the leg. When 
 I attended, the wound was in a gangrenous state, 
 and I applied spirits of wine, camphor, and the tinc- 
 ture of myrrh, with poultices made of wheaten flour, 
 yeast and honey, to the stump; and in the course of 
 twelve days, the wound was brought to a good con- 
 sistence. The only thing to be considered now was, 
 how the animal was to walk and graze. I therefore 
 got an artificial leg made of cork, and a leathern 
 boat, to lace above the carvil joint, to keep the le<T 
 in a proper state, and I soon had the satisfaction ol 
 seeing my patient walk and feed with little inconve- 
 nience. I give this case to show the necessity, when 
 an animal has fractured a limb, to get a skilfuU per- 
 son to set it, and it will in most cases, unite in about 
 J hirty days." j. m. H.

We have received from our friend William Elliot 
 a copy of the Brownsville Free Press, containing the 
 account ^iihe first annual Agricultural and Horticul- 
 tural Exhibition of the Jefi"erson township, Fayette 
 county Fair. It says : — 

The Jefferson Township, Fayette County, Agricul- 
 tural Society, held their first annual Exhibition at 
 Brownsville, on the 2Gth and 27th of October. The 
 exhibition of the different kinds of stock was very 
 fine, and surpassed the most sanguine expectations of 
 the Society, as to number and quality. The display 
 made in the Horticultural deptir ment showed that 
 we are becoming acquainted with the importance of 
 this branch of Domestic Industry. 

The display made in the Domestic Manufacturing 
 department, showed well for the manufacturing Bo- 
 roughs of Brownsville and Bridgeport — owing to tho 
 day being unfavorable, it was not so extensive as it 
 otherwise would have been, had the day been more 
 propitious; nevertheless great credit is due to those 
 presenting artic'es for exhibition, and more particu- 
 larly so for the taste, skill and industry of mothers, 
 wives, and daughters of the surrounding country. 

We observe by the list of premiums, that the man- 
 agers of this enterprising Society have endeavored 
 to enlist the whole feeling: and interest of their com- 
 munity, by taking a wide swath and embracing a 
 large number of articles not usually entered on such 
 occasions. In this they have done right, and the 
 great success of this their first exhibition is no doubt 
 attributable to such a course. In addition to the custo" 
 mary display of articles,we find premiums have been a" 
 warded for Ladies' Riding Horses, and light Harness 
 horses, Maltese Jachs, Merino, Saxony, French MerinOf 
 and other Merino sheep, specimens of several of the 
 improved breeds of Fom'Is, articles of wool and cotton 
 manufacture, quilis, coverlets, carpets, sewing silk- 
 paintings, Daguerreotypes, bee-hives and bees, wrap- 
 ping-paper, drugs, perfumery, penmanship, &c.; "al 
 so, a large variety of agricultural implements, grain 
 drills, grain reapers, clover and timothy sowers cut- 
 ting boxes, carriages, buggys, &c., and an extensive 
 list of our most approved varieties of Fruits. We 
 observe also, a premium of $100 to R. Buffington, a 
 small boy, for a steamboat, and a "premium to Mr. 
 Miller for vegetable eggs." These last eclipse any 
 thing we have been able to bring out, as yet, at our 
 Chester County Horticultural or Industrial Exhibi- 
 tions. There perhaps will be some excuse for us, in 
 the first article, as our nearest water, the Brandy- 
 wine creek, is two miles off, and so shallow as to 
 make navigation decidedly unsafe; but what are "ve- 
 getable eggs ?" Have our friends out there really got 
 to growing eggs on bushes for a field crop? if so, the 
 fowls may well exclaim — "their occupation's gone;" 
 or are they what we call here, egg plants, that are in- 
 tended ? 

We congratalate the Society on their success thus 
 far, and hope the influence of their effort will stimu-^ 
 late other counties around them in the same cause. 

Carrots for Horses. — The stable keepers are be" 
 ginning to find that these vegetables form a cheap 
 and nutritious food to mix with grain for their hor- 
 ses. It is better to give a working horse a peck of 
 carrots and four quarts of oats or corn meal a day^ 
 than to give him six quarts of meal.
