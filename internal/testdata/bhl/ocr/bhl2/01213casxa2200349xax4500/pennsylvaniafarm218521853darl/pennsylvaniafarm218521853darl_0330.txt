SWINE— POTATOES. 

January' 

Fattening Swine~Commence Early. 

By the last census it appears there were over thirty 
 millions of swine in the United States, and that they 
 out-numbered the sheep by about ten millions. This 
 shows the value of this product, proving pork an im- 
 portant item of domestic consumption. It is, in the 
 country especially, the stand-by when other meats 
 fail, and will ever retain its place, where long-keep- 
 ing and hearty, strength sustaining food is desired. 

We have before urged the importance of an early 
 commencement of the process of fattening, and now 
 repeat that it is advisable, for the reason that articles 
 of food can be made use of which would otherwise be 
 wasted, and that mild weather is much more favora- 
 ble to taking on flesh than cold. 

At this season, most faimers have quantities cf au- 
 tumn apples, summer squashes, early potatoes, &c., 
 which would perish or deteriorate sadly by keeping, 
 but are now of considerable value — well Avorth sav- 
 ing, at least — as food for swine. Boiled or steamed 
 and mixed with meal, they are well relished, and for 
 a commeneemcnt in fattening, answer as well as can 
 be desired. Where apples and potatoes are both 
 used, when boiled in a large kettle, it is a good plan 
 to put the apples in first — three or four bushels of ap- 
 bles to one of potatoes, and cover with the latter — 
 well washed, of course. Then fill with water, and 
 when sufficiently cooked, add enough meal to make a 
 thick pudding-like mass. The meal will be cooked 
 by thus mixing while hot. Some farmers grind up 
 oats and peas, oats and corn, oats and barley, or 
 shrunken wheat for this purpose. 

An Orleans county farmer informs us of a mode of 
 fattening which he has practiced with much success, 
 not differing materially from that above recommended. 
 He commences early, having the pen open into a small 
 yard adjoining, that the hogs may have exercise, and 
 get at the ground at pleasure. He begins feeding 
 boiled apples, pumpkins, carrots, potatoes, &c., mix- 
 ing the same with some light mill-feed, which he is 
 careful to measure so that he may gradually increase 
 its richness to the last, when he feeds nothing but corn 
 meal pudding. He is also particular to let the mush 
 stand a half day or so, until the sacharine fermenla 
 tion commences — which is undoubtedly the most pro- 
 per stage for feeding. He never fails in making the 
 first quality of pork, and a good deal of it. 

We remarked that mild weather was most favorable 
 for fattening. Food is the fuel for keeping up animal 
 heat, and the less need of expenditure in this respect, 
 the more rapidly will flesh be accumulated. Their 
 comfort should be studied as a matter of economy, 
 for a discontented, restive animal, ho a ever much he 
 may consume, will never fatten rapidly. Their sleep- 
 ing places should be dry and well littered, — and well 
 ventilated, for pure air is of importance to everything 
 that breathes it. 

As to the amount of food to be given daily, we 
 think it important fo supply all fattening animals with 
 just as much as they will consume without wasting, 
 either by leaving, or by not fully digesting. The 
 Boston C'u/i'iuaior in remarking upon this subject, il- 
 lustrates it as follows: "A certain amount of food is 
 daily required by the animal to support life, or sup- 
 ply the natural waste of the body — for the process of 
 life is one of consumption and decomposition. The 
 accumulation of fat and extra flesh is only a deposit 
 of superfluous nutriment, which not being required 
 for the system at one time, is laid by for future emer- 
 gencies. Now, if no more food is given daily than is 
 sufficient to supply the natural waste, no surplus flesh 
 or fat can be formed. If, for instance, a farmer has 

ten bushels of meal to be fed to each animal, and it 
 should be fed in so small quantities that it barely sup- 
 plies the natural waste, the whole of the food would 
 be consumed without the animal gaining a single 
 pound in weight. But if the time of feeding had been 
 shortened one-half, and the same amount of food had 
 been eaten, the animals would have been able to lay 
 by a surplus equal to the amount which half the food 
 was capable of producing." 

The same authority advises feeding Indian C(;rn be- 
 fore it is fully hardened, as it is then more readily 
 and fully digested, and both corn and c )b are eaten, 
 as well as the stalks if given to swine while yet green. 
 The plant in this stage contains much sugar, and this 
 is a most concentrated form of nutriment. 

To conclude, we wouhl say, commence early, use 
 cooked food — increasing the richness thereof as the 
 process goes on, feed regularly and fully, attend to 
 the comfort of your porkers, and do not forget the 
 manure heap, and no doubt large profits will result 
 from this branch of farming economy. — [OA»o Far-

Guano on Potatoes. 

Last spring I planted four acres of potatoes on a 
 two year old sod; the soil was a ver}' light gravelly 
 loam, well calculated to raise sound potatoes, but as 
 it had been hard run, and never manured, it could 
 not be expected to produce a large crop. I plowed 
 the land deep and well, as early as the weather would 
 permit, lotting it lie till the time of planting — May 
 10th. It was then dragged, and on two acres GOO 
 lbs. of Peruvian guano were sown broadcast. The 
 land was then furrowed out in rows about three feet 
 and potatoes planted in the rows, from twelve to 
 fourteen inches between the setts. On the remaining 
 two acres no guano, or manure of any kind, was ap- 
 plied, though treated exactly alike in every other re- 
 spect. 

As soon as the plants were up there was a decided 
 difference visible. The guanoed ones having a rich- 
 er, darker hue, which they maintained throughout 
 the summer. In the fall, when the unguanoed pota- 
 toes were quite ripe and the vines dead, the guanoed 
 ones were growing luxuriantly, the vines covering 
 the whole space between the rows. 

The potatoes were dug the last week in October, 
 and accurately measured. On the unguanoed two 
 acres, there was 238 bushels, and on the two acres 
 guanoed, 410 bushels, making a difference in favor of 
 the guano of 86 bu. per acre. All the potatoes aro 
 perfectly sound and good, but the guanoed ones are 
 much the largest, with scarcely a small one among 
 them. The guano cost in New York two and a half 
 cents per pound; freight, breaking the lumps, sifting, 
 and sowing it, would make its cost on the land three 
 cents per pound, or $9 per acre. The 86 extra bush 
 els of potatoes will more than pay for the guano, &c , 
 and leave a good profit from the investment. 

As regards the best mode of application, I may 
 state that in another field this year I had an acre of 
 potatoes, part of which were guanoed, as on the oth- 
 er two acres, by sowing broadcast, planting the po- 
 tatoes in hills. On part of the acre the guano was ap- 
 plied in the hill, placing the guano immediately over 
 the potatoes, separating them with a little soil, other- 
 wise" it would injure the sett. The potitoes thus 
 treated were imtch better than where the guano was 
 sown broadcast. Four rows left unguanoed were not 
 m jre than half as good as where guano was applied. 

I consider guano a most powerful and valuable ma-
