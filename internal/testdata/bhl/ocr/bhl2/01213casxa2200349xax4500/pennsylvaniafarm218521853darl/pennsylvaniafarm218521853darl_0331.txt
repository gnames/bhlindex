nure, though -whether it -will pay as -well to apply it 
 to wheat, corn, or other grain crops, as it has in this 
 instance to potatoes, I cannot say. I have sown 
 some on wheat this fall and can already see how far 
 it extended, the difference being very perceptible. —

» ebb's Patent Hay and Straw Cutter. 

The above is an engraving of a new and useful 
 improveraent in Straw Cutters, patented in 1850, and 
 not as yet widely introduced. Wo consider it, for 
 several reasons, the best machine for this purpose now 
 in the market. It combines nimpUcily of arrangement 
 with great efficiency, cutting two to three bushels in 
 a minute, with hand power. The length of cut with 
 this machine is about three-fourths of an inch, having 
 two knives ; those with three knives the cut is halt 
 an inch. Its construction is simply on the shear 
 principle, a straight knife cutting on a curved edge, 
 with adjusting and set screws, to regulate the ap- 
 proach of the knives to the curved edge. There is no 
 intricate rigging to break or get out of order, and the 
 whole machine is so simple, and at the same time 
 efficient, as to warrant its being recommended with 
 contidence. It is self feeding, and the price is $1G for 
 the two knives, and $20 for the three. Several altera- 
 tions have been made in the original machine, making 
 it much more perfect and easily nuinaged Persons 
 who purchased any of the first manufacture in east- 
 ern Pennsylvania, are requested to return them, and 
 they will be exchanged for the improved pattern at 
 Paschall Morris & Co. 's Agricultural Warehouse,West 
 Chester, who can furnish them at the above prices 
 retail, and at reduced rates to dealers. 

WOKK FOR THE MONTH. 

Farm. 

Stock require particular attention. Give sufficient 
 shelter, some variety in their food, free aud c "invenii>nt 
 access to water, and have a lump of rock salt in the 
 yard for them to go to, which is much better and more 
 economical than salting at stated times. Cut up straw 
 hay and corn fodder ; the saving by this will more 
 than pay for a machine, in one winter. Keep cows at 
 night in warm, well ventilated stables, well furnished 
 ■with litter, and turn out in fine weather. Use the caL 
 tie card daily, particularly on heifers and young 
 stock; feed once a day, at hast, with roots, cabbages, 
 &c., and a little meal ; milk before feeding, to avoid 

taste of turnips, &c., in milk and butter; accustum 
 calves to the halter, by being regularly tied up at 
 night in stalls; give extra food to working oxen ; have 
 corn ground in cob for feeding ; attend to manure in 
 yard as directed last month ; protect all tools and ve- 
 hicles from weather ; haul lime, ashes, and such oth- 
 er fertilizers as may be wanted the coming season. 
 Sheep should have good shedding, and be fed, besides 
 good hay, with oats daily, and also roots, sufficient to 
 keep them in good thriving condition. There is no 
 gain at lambing time from sheep poorly kept through 
 winter; they should also have access to water and 
 salt at their pleasure. At leisure times, and in wet 
 weather, make plain gates to substitute for bars all 
 over the farm; there is great economy in this. Give 
 attention to poultry. Let them have a warm house 
 to go to, with some refuse meat, grain, sand and ash- 
 es always at hand. A few well kept will pay better 
 than a large number running at largo and uncared 
 lor. 

Fruit Orchard. 

But little is to bo said, further than directions for 
 last month, under this head. Remove all long grass 
 and rubbish from trees, which attract mice. Bank 
 up earth as before recommended. Arrange plan of 
 orchard and fruit garden for spring planting ; select 
 at this leisure season, from fruit books and other 
 sources, what varieties will probably be wanted ; pro- 
 vide fencing materials, and have them ready for early 
 use; cut down worn-out and decayed apple trees; 
 provide stakes and tallies for trees; plant the orchard 
 on paper in winter, at leisure, and thus expedite bus- 
 iness in spring; spread lime over old orchards ; mod- 
 erate pruning may be attended to in this month; dig 
 in Guano or short manure,to promote vigorous growth* 

V^egetable Garden. 

Attend to directions of last month ; keep a close 
 watch on frames, so as not to force into growth or in- 
 jure by exposure; attend to composts, and procure 
 materials for forcing beds in spring; repair sash, and 
 make mats of straw for covering in cold nights; pro- 
 vide a full supply of bean poles, pea sticks, &c.; pro- 
 cure what gardening tools may be wanted, and an- 
 ticipate the working season. 

Flower Garden. 

If the hints given out the previous month have 
 been attended to, there will belittle to do this month 
 in the flower garden. Protection should be given at 
 once to all tender roses and shrubs requiring it. 
 Plants in windows should be carefully watched, and 
 avoid too J're(]Heni watering. A good watering when 
 necessary, is much better than constant wetting. That 
 pest the (Jrcen Fly, can be kept under by occasional- 
 ly gyringing or immersing in tobacco water, made by 
 steeping tobacco stems in water for twenty four hours. 

Orange and Lemon trees in cellar, should have 
 fresh air admitted when weather is open ; water only
