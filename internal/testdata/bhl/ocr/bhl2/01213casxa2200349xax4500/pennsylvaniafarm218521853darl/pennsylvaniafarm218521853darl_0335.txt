This Machine was Patented July 2, 1850, and has 
 received the highest premium at all the Exhibitions 
 wherr it has ever been contested; including New

 ber 9tli 185U; Philadelphia and Delaware County 
 Agricultural Society, October 17th, 1850 ; Maryland

THE ABOVE DllILL is not liable to get out of 
 repair, is excoedsnly simple in its construction, will 
 sow point rows in all irregular shaped fields, and pos- 
 sessess superior advantages to all others in the ease 
 and quickness with which it can be regulated to sow 
 any desired quantity of Grain per Acre, while the 
 draft upon the horses is twenty-five per cent, lighter, 
 and consequently with the same labor, can seed one- 
 fourth more gr,.und per day than with most other 
 machines now in use. The objection so common to 
 Drilling Machines of becoming Choked if the seed is 
 not perfectly cleaned, is entirely obviated in the Sim- 
 ple and Peculiar construction of this Drill, as white 

MYERS' CHEMICAL ANIMAL MANURE. 

That of offering to the public a. Manure ^vhich comprisps al 
 that could be wished — its clieapness and surprising effects in pro 
 ducing larger crops in any kindof snil — is lasting and enduring 
 (jiialitieg. 

The subscriber offers this Manure to the public with a full knowl- 
 edge of its powerful effects upon ground where used. This Ma- 
 nure must take its precedence above all others ; its adaption to all 
 kinds of soil, and every particle of fertilizing properties being 
 preserved in the mode of manufacture, render it at once cheaper 
 than anv other manure used for all kinds of crops Its effects are 
 wonderful A supply always on hand, WM. MYERS,

Oermantowx, Octobers, 1851. 
 To Mr. \Vm. Myers— Sir — Having tried your Cliemico-Animal 
 Manure upon potato ground, this season, I find It produce one-third 
 more and larger potatoes than the best horse manure i n the same 
 ground. WM. K. Cox. 

The following additional certificate just received, speaks for itself. 
 VVOOT5BURT, N. J , 10th mo 20th, 1851. 
 T have used upward of 1000 bushels of Wm. Mt«rs' Animal 
 Ma;«ure, on corn, potatoes, turnips, melons, and some other crops 
 during the present season, and am satisfied that it is an economical 
 and powerful manure, foe turnips, radishes, and other root crops — 
 my experience has shown it to be especially valuable.

 Mr. Wm. Myers — Cear Sir— I manured with yonr Cheroieo-Aai- 

caps and short straw will not interfere in the least 
 with the regular distribution ot the seed. It is war- 
 ranted to distribute the seed evenly-; to sow and 
 I quantity per acre commonly sown broadcast; to not 
 cut or break the grains; to bo well made witii good 
 mat(M'Ials and durable with proper care. 

Having sold about 400 of tlie above Drills the past 
 ; season, all of which mot with the unqualiiiod appru- 
 ! batiou of the purchas(>rs: and after careful and thor- 
 ough experiments, which have resulted in Still Great- 
 er Improvements, we now feel warranted in saying 
 that Moore's Patent Seed and Grain Planter improv- 
 ed, is superior to any other machine for the purpose, 
 now in the market. 

Having made arrangements to furnish 1000 of the 
 above Machines for sale the coming Season, we shall 
 be prepared, at all times, to supply orders without 
 elay. 

JB@"A11 orders addressed to the undersigned will 
 warrant prompt attention.

mal Manure about ."38 acnsof the poorest land on my furiii, and pnt 
 half in Oats, and tl e balance in Corn. Although it was got in 
 quite lute, and the Season vt-ry unfavorable for the Corn crop gen- 
 erally, yet notwithstanding. 1 can say that it is deci(le<lly the best 
 Corn i ever raised, although I have farmed for '20 \ears, and have 
 had good Corn land. and .Manured wcli, as I thought, in the old way. 
 While my neighbors' Corn was quite yellow ami leaves curled up 
 with the drought, mine was green and growing rapidly ; thertfore, 
 I consider it one of the most va ualile manures I ever used, and 
 shall take pleasure in recomineiidiiig it to my iieighborsand otJiers^

SIDLE'S HUB, AUGUR AND BOX REGULATOR. 

THE subscriber residing in Dillsburg. York connty, Pennsylva 
 nia, has invented a new and improved .^ngur for the boring of hubs 
 and setting the boxes of wagon. carriage and other vehicle wheels 
 for which 1 have obtained letiers patent. 

The Augur will bore both ends of the hub at the same time, or 
 either separately — and is the most useful and impcjrtaiit invention 
 of the age for inserting wagon boxes and the only Machine in ex- 
 istence by which they can be inserted exactly true— and is so per- 
 fectly simp'e in its construction, and constructed on such just me- 
 chanical principles, that it cannot possibly get out of repair. 

With this Augur a set of botes can be inserted in a few minutes 
 — where under the old system it requires hours to perform the 
 same amount of work. 

Per8<ins wishing to purchase Territory or Shop rights will pleas* 
 address the subsrriher, who will sell on terms that will enable 
 purchaser to make money. IJENRV SIDUJ.
