inches long, and two inches square. The upper sec- 
 tion of the box is six inches deep, and the sides are 
 morticed into or nailed to the posts. From the bot- 
 tom of this square, the slanting part or tunnel reach- 
 es to within half an inch of the floor, which should 
 be six inches from the ground : the tunnel tapers 
 from two to one foot ; and in order to bring the grain 
 within reach of the fowls, a cone, (Fig. A is a sec- 
 tion) is placed in the centre, as much smaller than 
 the hopper as to leave half an inch space all around, 
 ■which conducts the grain to the edge, where, as the 
 fowls pick the grain away., more Avill f:xll, and keep 
 a constant supply as long as any is left in the hop- 
 per. The slats on the sides prevent the fowls from 
 getting in or crowding one another. This fountain 
 will hold two bushels or more of grain, and protects 
 it from wet and in a measure from rats. It occupies 
 but little room, and from sixteen to twenty fowls can 
 feed at the same time. 

To protect the grain more effectually from rats and 
 mice, we would suggest that the posts be made some 
 two feet longer, and a platform of boards, about one 
 foot wide, placed round and fitted close up to the bot- 
 tom, so that mice cannot climb up the posts and get 
 in. This platform will be necessary for them to 
 stand on when eating. 

leaves a passage way nearly a foot wide behind the 
 nests. The top must slope from the wall, and open 
 partly or entirely with hinges. These nests are easi- 
 ly examined, and give the fowls all the secrecy they 
 seem to require. Fijj. 27 shows the appearance of 
 this scries of nests v-lien closed. Fig. 28 exhibits a 
 vicAV of the interior arrangement." ' 

With these extracts, we must forbear further no- 
 tice, at present, of this valuable work. We cannot 
 part with it, however, without again recommending 
 it to the attention of every farmer who designs " grow- 
 ing" poultry with an eye to profit. lie cannot read 
 the book "if he tries," without getting value receiv- 
 ed for his outlay in time and money. 

This little volume is got up in the usual neat style 
 of the Messrs. Ilarpers — to whose politeness we are 
 indebted for the accompanying engravings — and is 
 for sale at the book stores generally, we presume, 
 and is also among the collection of agricultural works 
 at the warehouse of P. Morris & Co., West Chester.

WATER FOUNTAIK. 

"There should, if possible, be running water inthe 
 yard, as fowls, like some other bipeds of larger 
 growth, prefer clean, pure water; and in order to 
 prevent their drinking by chance what is bad or cor- 
 rupted, stone or wooden troughs, or what is much 
 better, a keg set on a stool, on end, with a small tube 
 extending from the bottom to a shallow dish or pan, 
 which should be small, so that the fowls cannot get 
 into and soil the water." * * * *

PLANS FOR NESTS. 

Suitable and attractive nests are indispensable ac- 
 companiments to the poultry-house. The author de- 
 scribes several plans, the most complete of which, in 
 our opinion, is the following : 

"The hen," says Mr. Bement, "is a prude, and 
 likes to steal away in some sly place to deposit her 
 eggs. To gratify their organ of secretivencss, the 
 following ingenious plan for fixed nests we take from 
 the "American Poultry Book," which, the author 
 says, 'has lately been contrived in Connecticut, and 
 I have tried with complete success. Hens arc well 
 known to be anxious to deposit their eggs in seclu- 
 ded places The seo'et nests here alluded to are well 
 adapted to satisfy this propensity. They are made 
 thus: 

Fte-27. '"Place a platform of 

boards, two feet wide, and 
 say ten feet long (though 
 it may be made of any 
 length,) against a l»uild- 
 ing. or a close board fence, 
 about three feet from the 
 ground. Along th(M)uter 
 edge of this platform nail 
 a l)oard, lengthwise ami 
 upright, about one foot 
 higli ; leave a space open 
 in the middle, andateach

Basket Willow. 

The cultivation of Basket Willow in the United 
 States appears, from the fiicts which have come to 
 our knowledge, to be a subject deserving_ serious 
 consideration. It is stated, upon the best informa- 
 tion, that the value of the annual importation of the 
 article into this country amounts to nearly five mil- 
 lions of dollars, and that large as the quantity may 
 seem, it does not satisfy the consumption. The sup- 
 ply is derived from France and Germany, and the 
 price paid here ranges from $100 to $130 per ton 
 weight. There arc three varieties of the plant re 
 garded as best suited for basket making, farming, 
 tanning and fencing. Of these, the SaJix Viminalis, 
 is most used in the manufacture of baskets, and, un- 
 der favorable circumstances of soil and culture, an 
 acre of ground will yield at least tn-o tons weight 
 per year, costing, when prepared for market, about 
 $35 per ton. The next species is the Salix Copna, 
 or Huntingdon willow, adapted for basket making, 
 but more extensively employed l)y English farmers 
 for hoop poles and fencing. When used for tlie lat- 
 ter purpose, the manner of planting is described to 
 be "by placing the ends of the cuttings in the ground, 
 and then working them into a kind of trellis work, 
 and passing a willow withe around the tops, so as to 
 keep them in shape for the first two yoar.«. The 
 tops are afterwards cut off yearly, and sold to basket 
 makers, thus obtaining a"^ fence and crop from the 
 same ground." The hurdle fences of England, re- 
 movable at the pleasure of the proprietors, are also 
 made from the Salix Capua. The third kind of wil- 
 low to whicli we have reference, is the Salix Alba, or 
 Bedford Willow, whicli is licld in high esteem as a 
 shade tree, and very generally cultivated for this use 
 in England. It is remarkable for its beauty and ra- 
 pid growth — aflbrding agood shade, it is said, in two 
 years after planting. The bark is, also, much prized 
 for its superior tanning properties, while its wood, 
 from its fine grain and susceptibility of a polish as 
 fine as that made on rosewood or mahogany, is in 
 extensive requisition for shoemakers' lasts, boot-trees, 
 cutting-boards, gun and nistol stocks and house tim- 
 ber'. This, too, is the willow that is chiefly used in 
 England in the manufacture of gunpowder. An acre
