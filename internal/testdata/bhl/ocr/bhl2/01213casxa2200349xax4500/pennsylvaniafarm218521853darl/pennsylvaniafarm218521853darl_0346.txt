BASKET WILLOAV^— SOILS AND SUBSOILS. 

February^ 

of the wood, after ten years from planting, has sold 
 for £155. 

As respects the practicability of gi'owing in this 
 country the willows enumerated, experiment by a 
 number of enterprising farmers and horticulturists 
 in New York and other states, has been made suc- 
 cessfully on a small scale. The soil and climate of 
 the Uuitcd States are, in many places, favorable to 
 the cultivation of the plant, and but little care is ne- 
 cessary to bring it to perfection. Those persons who 
 have engaged in the enterprizc, and have experience 
 in the work of raising this species of vegetable for 
 manufacturing purposes, assert confidently that it 
 can be grown profitably in numbers of the States, at 
 $50 per ton weight. It is also said, upon well ascer- 
 tained data, that there are hundreds of thousands of 
 ar res of lands here, either not improved at all, or 
 yielding but a very small per cent, per annum, which 
 could be made, by occupying them with the ozier, 
 productive of immense pi-ofits. On this point, an in- 
 telligent gentleman, who has a practical acquaintance 
 with the subject, says : 

"Every farmer Avill acknowledge meadow land to 
 be poor that will not yield a ton of hay to the acre, 
 which, when cured and in market, seldom sells for 
 more than $12. All men who are acquainted with 
 the growth of willow for market, well know that an 
 acre of land ought to yield at least one and a half 
 tons weight of it. The cost of preparing willow for 
 market would not exceed $40 per ton. Noav, estima- 
 ting hay at $12_per ton, and willow at $120, deduct- 
 ing from the willow $40 per ton for preparing for 
 market, there is a balance in favor of the willow of 
 $80 per acre." 

The feasibility of the cultivation in the United 
 States, has been, hitherto, and very naturally, deci- 
 ded by importers, who have represented the crop to 
 be liable to damage from flies, and have a^so alleged 
 the price of labor to be too high to allow of fair, re- 
 munerating returns. In contradiction of this, we 
 here cite the testimony of Mr. W. 0. Ilaynes, of New 
 York, who is occupied in the production of the wil- 
 low f jr mechanical uses. He says : 

"I have grown as good a quality of willow as is 
 raised in any part of the world. That taken from two 
 acres cut last year, yielded me, clear of all expenses, 
 the snug little sum of $333 75. If I had the means, 
 I would purchase lands and plant thousands of acres 
 of willow, and find a ready market for it." 

To convince those who have not investigated the 
 subject, of the lucrative nature of the trade, it is suf- 
 ficient to state that the large importation of basket- 
 willow, made during last summer, by four or five 
 houses in New York, was not equal to even half the 
 demand, which is increasing every day. Further- 
 more, it has been discovered by one who has indus- 
 triously collected the statistics, that the amount of 
 money paid for willow baskets alone, in the city of 
 New York, exceeded $1,000,000, and that the sum 
 paid for baskets shipped to the Southern and West 
 India markets probably reached $2,000,000 more. 
 These fixct^ are certainly important, and well worth 
 the reflectitm of men who are properly situated for 
 embarking in a business which, in all points of view, 
 promises advantages so decided and great. The na- 
 tive product would always command a sale here, in 
 preference to that imported, by reason of the clean- 
 ness of the crop, and its freedom from bruising and 
 breakage occasioned by packing in a ship's hold, not 
 to mention that the imported article is the more re- 
 fuse of the foreign crop, which is generally careful^ 
 picked by the French and German basket-makers, 
 who retain the best qualities for their own manufac- 

ture into fabrics subsequently exported to this coun- 
 try. 

Besides the inducements which an extensive do- 
 mestic demand for the willow holds out to our agri- 
 culturists, Great Britain annually imports from the 
 continent a large quantity of it, and there is no rea- 
 son why producers of the raw material here should 
 not supply the consumption of England as well as of 
 the United States. In short, the project of cultiva- 
 ting the Salix Viminalis ; and other species of the 
 plant adapted to manufactures, appears worthy to 
 claim the earnest attention of the American farmer ; 
 and, in y'mw of the obvious rewards which it would 
 yield his labor and capital, we are surprised the sub- 
 ject has not long since been discussed in the agricul- 
 tural societies of the land, and tried thoroughly by 
 liberal and enlightened experiment. It is not yet 
 too late to render it a valuable source of private and 
 national revenue.

Distinguishing Characters of Soils and Sub- 
 soils. 

Beneath the immediate surface of soil, through 
 which the plough makes its way, and to which the 
 seed is entrusted, lies what is commonly distin- 
 guished by the name of subsoil. This subsoil occa- 
 sionally consists of a mixture of tho general constit- 
 uents of soils naturally different from that which 
 forms the surface layer — as when clay above has a 
 sandy bed below, or a light soil on the surface rests 
 on a retentive clay beneath. 

This, however, is not always the case. The pecu- 
 liar characters of the soil and subsoil often result 
 from the slow operation of natural causes. 

In a mass of loose matter of considerable depth, 
 spread over an extent of country, it is easy to under- 
 stand how — even though originally alike through its 
 whole mass — a few inches at the surface should grad- 
 ually acquire different physical and chemical charac- 
 ters from the rest, and hoAV there should thus be grad- 
 ually established important agricultural distinctions 
 between the first 12 or 15 inches (the soil), the next 
 15 (the subsoil), and the remaining body of the mass, 
 which, lying still lower, does not come under the ob- 
 servation of the practical agriculturist. 

On the surface, plants grow and die. Through the 
 first few inches their roots penetrate, and in the same 
 the dead plants are buried. This portion, therefore, 
 by degrees, assumes a brown color, more or less dark, 
 according to the quantity of vegetable matter which 
 has been permitted to accumulate in it. Into the 
 subsoil, however, the roots rarely penetrate, and the 
 dead plants are still more rarely buried at so great 
 a depth. Still this inferior layer is not wholly desti- 
 tute of vegetable or other organic matter. However 
 comparatively impervious it may be, still water makes 
 its way through it, more or less, and carries down 
 soluble organic substances, which are continually in 
 the act of being produced during the decay of the 
 vegetable matter lying above. Thus, though not sen- 
 sibly discolored by an admixture of decayed roots 
 and stems, the subsoil in reality contains an appre- 
 ciable quantity of organic matter which may be dis- 
 tinctly estimated. 

Again, the continual descent of the rains upon the 
 surface soil, washes down the carbonates of lime, iron 
 and magnesia, as well as other soluble earthy sub- 
 stances — it even, by degrees, carries down the fine 
 clay also, so as gradually to establish a more or less 
 manifest difference between the upper and lower lay- 
 ers, in reference even to the earthy ingredients which 
 they respectively contain.
