COOKED FOOD FOR CATTLE— NESBIT'S ADDRESS. 

Februart, 

fed alike, and for about the same time. They were 

weighed on the first of January : 

No. 1 weighed 1020 lbs. 

No. 2 " 1750 lbs. 

No. 3 " lt>70 lbs. 

No. 4 " 1510 lbs. 

Nos. 1 and 2 were fed during January on 9 lbs. of 
 corn and oats, (not ground) in the proportion of 9 
 parts corn to five parts oats by measure, and boiled 
 in a three barrel kettle, in which was placed thirty 
 six gallons of water, one and a half quarts of salt, 
 nnd about seven bushels of grain mixed as above — 
 boiled this mixture for two hours, using an armful of 
 dry wood, and two bushels of corn-cobs as fuel. I 
 then cover the kettle, placing over the cover a horse 
 blanket, keeping in the steam and preventing too 
 rapid cooking, and by this means the contents of the 
 kettle will remain warm and soft until fed out. 

Nos. 3 and 4 had 10 lbs. of ground feed, mixed in 
 the same proportien of oats and corn, (but not cook- 
 ed,) each day. In every other particular, all four 
 were fed alike — each pair having a small quantity of 
 carrots and turnips each day, with as much common 
 hay and corn stalks as they choose to eat. 

On the first of February they were again weighed. 

No. 1 wuiglied 1725 lbs., having gained 105 lbs 

No. 2 " 1850 100 " 

Weight, February 1st, 3575 lbs. 

M eight, January 1st. 3370 lbs. gain in 1 month, 205 lbs. 

Nos. 1 and 2, it will be recollected, had cooked 
 food during the month of January, and gained 205 
 lbs. 

No. 3 weighed 1750 lbs., having gained 80 lbs. 

No. i ■• 1550 " " " 40 >. 

Weight, February 1st, 3300 lbs. 

Weight, January 1st, 3180 lbs. gain in one month, 120 lbs. 

Nus. 3 and 4 were fed on raw feed ground, and one 
 oound per day greater in quantity than that fed to 
 Nos. 1 and 2, (not ground, but cooked,) and still, 
 although in every other particular they were fed and 
 cared for alike, the difierence in favor of cooked feed 
 is very large. The expense of grinding being great- 
 er than the expense of cooking, the economy is every 
 way in favor of the cooked feed. 

Gain with cooked feed, 205 lbs 

Gain with raw leed, 12o lbs! 

Gain in favor of cooked feed, ~85 lbs. 

On the first of February I ceased to use turnips 
 and carrots, and substituted best clover hay for com- 
 mon hay and corn stalks. 

Fearing the great difierence in favor of cooked feed 
 might arise in part from the peculiarity of the cattle, 
 particular state of health, or some other accidental 
 cause, I now changed them, and put Nos. 3 and 4 on 
 the cooked feed, and Nos. 1 and 2 on the raw feed, 
 increasing the quantity of feed to each pair, one 
 pound. 

Previous to commencing the experiment on the 1st 
 of January, each pair had been accustomed to use 
 eomo roots, pumpkins, &c., and this may account for 
 the change I am about to describe after a discontin- 
 uance of the roots. 

From the 1st of February to the 1st of March, 
 Nos. 1 ai,d 2 were fed on ground raw feed, Nos. 3 
 and 4 on whole cooked feed. 

On the first of March they were weighed again, 
 when "^ "" ° ' 

Nos. .1 and 4, on cooked feed, had gained but - - - 47 lbs. 
 JNos. 1 and 2, on raw feed, '• " , ... 22 lbs. 

It will be seen from the above, that although the 
 cooked feed at least cost continued to produce most 
 growth, and m about the same relative proportion, 
 still each pair, when fed with roots in addition, gain- 
 ed much more rapidly than when fed on grain and 
 clover hay alone. 

I would remark, that IG lbs. of corn and oats in 
 the proportion before named, will weigh, when cook- 
 ed, 34} lbs. If you think the above would be useful 
 to your readers, you may publish it in the— Working 
 Farmer. — James Campbell.

Who are the Practical Farmers f 

From the London Farmer's Magazine, we copy 
 some extracts from an address by J. C. Nesbit, which 
 we think is entltlel to consideration and atten- 
 tion : 

Mr. Chairman and gentlemen, I feel very highly 
 gratified at seeing such a numerous assemblage of 
 gentlemen interested in the progress of agriculture ; 
 and I shall feel very great satisfaotion this evening, 
 in endeavoring, as far as I possibly can, to elucidate 
 the science of agriculture with reference to the ap- 
 plication of chemistry to its development. I am not 
 come down to you with a vast amount of chemical 
 apparatus ; I have not brought here a prodigious 
 number of curious things, of which you might have 
 wondered what was their use. I come to you this 
 evening with the language of plain common sense ; 
 and with the operations which you are continually 
 performing on your farms as the basis of my argu- 
 ments, 1 shall see if I cannot, by applying to them 
 the rules of plain common sense, elucidate the sub- 
 ject, and secure to j^ou a greater knowledge of the 
 science of agriculture than you already possess. Be- 
 fore doing this, however, I must make one or two ob- 
 servations. And, gentlemen, I must, in fact, quarrel 
 with you, because you arrogate to yourselves alone, 
 what I think you ought not to claim for yourselves 
 alone — the title of practical men. "We, we, we," you 
 say, "are the practical men," as if there were no oth- 
 er practical men in the kingdom besides yourselves, 
 and as if no one else understood the nature of things. 
 Now, I mean to contend that the title "practical" 
 does not belong to the farmer alone ; and I have cer- 
 tainly some doubt whether it ought to be applied to 
 the farmer at all, in its full signification. I will take, 
 for example, the case of Mr. Tomkius, who is a capi- 
 tal farmer. He farms his land well ; he keeps stock 
 and grows turnips, and does every thing in the best 
 manner. Now, as a poor student in science, I want 
 to gain from this gentleman some useful practical in- 
 formation. With this object in view I say to Mr. 
 Tomkins, "Pray, what have you got in your soil — 
 what are its properties t" He replies that it is a 
 sandy soil, a loamy soil or a clay soil. "Yes ; but 
 what have you got in the one and what in the other?" 
 "I don't know ; I have not gone so far as that yet." 
 I then ask, "What have you got in your manure 1" 
 And Mr. Tomkins, good, easy, practical man as he is, 
 says, I cannot tell you." If I ask him what his crops 
 take out of the land, again he declares that he can- 
 not answer my question ; he knows that they take 
 away something ; he knows that if he sows wheat, 
 barley, or any thing else, something must be taken 
 away by the crop; but what that something is, he 
 cannot determine. Lastly, if 1 ask Mr. Tomkins 
 what is in the air and what is in the water, he is still 
 obliged to confess that he does not know. Now, gen- 
 tlemen, I appeal to you whether the term practical, 
 in its largest sense, will apply to Mr. Tomkius, while 
 he actually knows nothing whatever of those things 
 on which the success of the agriculturist particularly 
 depends. I grant you that Mr. Tomkins looks at 
 his crops, manures and soils, in the whole, and that 
 he has got some general idea of them as a Avhole ; 
 but then he never seriously considers what this whole
