or affords no nourishment at all to other animals — 
 namely beeswax. The female moth enters the hive 
 in the evening, when the bees are at rest, and de- 
 posits her eggs; or if from the crowded condition of 
 the hive, she finds it impossible to enter, she is con- 
 tent to deposit them on the outside. 

As soon as the feeble little thread-like worm is ex- 
 cluded from the egg, it begins to spin for itself a lit- 
 tle silken tube, in which it shields itself from the af 
 tacks of the bees, and thus passes safely and unseen 
 in every direction through the waxen cells, which it 
 breaks down, devours and destroys. It generally 
 pursues its work of demolition in the night, or in dark 
 cloudy weather, when it ean do so unseen. 

In three or four weeks, accordingly as circumstan- 
 ces arcjfavorable or adverse, these larvte attain their 
 full size, whicli is about one inch in length more or 
 less, accordingly as they have been well or sparely 
 fed. They then spin themselves up into a strong 
 silken follicle or coccoon, an inch or more in length, 
 and of an oval shape. These pods may sometimes be 
 found in large clusters in the upper part of the hive. 
 In about two weeks from the time they have spun, 
 they evolve from the pupa state and come forth a 
 moth, measuring across the expanded wings nearly 
 one and a half inches ; of a dusty gray color ; the 
 fore wings are more or less glossy, and streaked with 
 purple or brown on the outer margin, with a few dark 
 spots near the inner margin. The hind wings are 
 yellowish grey, with whitish fringes.* The female 
 is larger than the male and darker colored. In a state 
 of rest, the wings close flatly on the top of the back, 
 deflexed at the sides, and turn up a little at the ends; 
 the insect then measures about three-quarters of an 
 inch in length. Two or more broods usually succeed 
 each other in one year, the first appearing the latter 
 end of April, or beginning of May. When the trans- 
 formation to the pupa state takes place in the fall, 
 they remain in that state all winter, and the moth 
 evolves in early spring. 

The moth usually hides in chinks and crevices 
 about the bee-hives during the day, and comes iorth 
 at night. 

The only sure method for the extermination of the 
 Bee-moth is the frequent examination of the hive, 
 and the destruction of the caterpillar or larvae, and 
 the chrysalids. Warm, dry weather seems to be the 
 most favorable for the production of these moths, es- 
 pecially in the months of August and September. 
 Their presence is generally indicated by a deposit of 
 fine powder-like excrement on the bottom of the hive. 

As the perfect moth is fond of anything sweet, a 
 vessel placed near the bee-house, containing a sweet- 
 ened mixture, in the evening, may attract many of 
 them, and thereby drown them.

Theory of the Action of Lime used in Agriculture. 

•Uar. Treatise, p. 360. 

[Continued from Page 230.] 

For the last two months I have been unable tocon- 
 tinue to furnish to the readers of the Journal my 
 views of the action of lime when applied to the soil. 
 I was obliged to visit the city of New Orleans on 
 professional business. Although this is far from be- 
 ing my first visit to the sunny South, yet I this time 
 made some observations during my journey, which I 
 intend, in course of time, to offer to your readers. 

We, in the November number, considered the ac- 
 tion of lime strictly in a chemical point of view, and 
 I trust that nothing was put forth that cannot be sub- 
 stantiated by the acknowledged laws of chemistry. 
 Nothing was required of the imagination, and every- 
 thing therein so accords with the results, which the 
 experience of the farmer has taught him to expect, 
 that he even might say to himself, "why did I not 
 think of that before?" 

Every farmer will tell you that lime acts so like a 
 coat of manure, that he cannot tell the difference. 
 You will be told that a coat of lime will increase the 
 crop, and render worn-out land fertile. When this 
 phenomenon is the result of the application of lime 
 in the caustic state, and follows immediately after the 
 application, depend upon it the land is not deficient 
 in vegetable matter, but having been deficient in 
 caustic and carbonate of lime, the vegetable acids 
 formed by the decomposing vegetables, had accumu- 
 lated to an extent sufiicient to be injurious as an an- 
 ti-septic. These acids removed by the lime, left the 
 soil at least free from any injurious matter. But if 
 instead of applying it in the caustic state, it had 
 been applied in the form of a carbonate, the same 
 beneficial effect would have resulted, and over and 
 besides, the carbonic acid set free from the lime, 
 would have been equally beneficial to the crop, as 
 though it had been furnished by the decay of ma- 
 nure. 

If on the other hand, we do not perceive immediate 
 benefit from the application of lime applied in tho 
 caustic state, but such benefit is found to accrue to 
 subsequent crops. In this case the land did not con- 
 tain sufficient acid to be of any sensible injury, and 
 the land not being very replete with vegetable matter, 
 no apparent change took place until the lime was 
 carbonated. This once th6 case, the lime by yielding 
 its carbonic acid, came to the aid of the decaying 
 vegetable matter, and there was a consequent increase 
 in the productiveness. 

In my opinion, the existence of a certain quantity 
 of lime in the soil, is a sine qua non. Without lime 
 the process of eremacausis will soon be arrested, and 
 no valuable plant can be cultivated. I make no 
 doubt that other alkalies might be substituted, so as 
 to render small experiments successful, but the alka- 
 line carbonates, are, generally, too soluble to remain
