SOUTIIUOWX BUCK, kc 

PURE SOUTHDOWN BUCK, 

Owned by Francis liotch, Jiforri.'i, Otsego counf>/,X.T. 
 We present our readers, with tlio above admirable 
 specimen and correct copy from a daguerrotype like- 
 ness, of a pure Southdown Buck, lately imported, 
 together with throe Ewes of the same breed, by Joseph 
 Oope of this county, for Francis Rotch, New York. 
 They were all from the flock of J. Kllman, and hav- 
 ing stopped here for a few days, previous to going to 
 New York, gave us the opportunity of having the 
 Buck daguerreotyped. 

We are somewhat familiar with fine Southdowns, 
 and had an opportunity some years ago, at the great 
 Southampton cattle show in England, to examine 
 some of their best specimens, but we have not tlie 
 impression of ever seeing a more finished sheep in all 
 the characteristic points of the Southdown breed, 
 than the Buck now before us. The engraving"; we i 
 consider the hant tiuJlcUlercd porfrail of a pure South- 
 down, which has appeared in any periodical in this 
 country. 

Our friend F. Rotch. in a letter ^ us from which 
 he his permitted us to make some extracts, says, "as 
 you have seen the sheep, sent me by 3Ir. Ellman, 
 any comment on my part is unnecessary. I request- 
 ed him to send me specimens of his very best sheep, 
 and I have reason to believe, that as a matter (d 
 friendship, he has done so, and I feel undfr great 
 obligati ms to him for thus according to mo, what 
 money alone could not have procured. ^ I have seen 
 larger shei'p, but I think I have never seen more 
 beautiful or more finished specimens of the breed. A- 
 Mr. Ellman remarks, I have yet to learn that size, 
 accompanied by coarseness, is a characteristic of a 

true Southdown." These sheep, on the voyage, were 
 accompanied by an English Shepherd, through whose 
 care they arrived in fine condition. In importations 
 of sheep especially, this is the only safe plan, and is 
 the cheapest in the end. It is use^ss to purchase 
 abroad higli priced stock, if they are to have only 
 f;7ta?jre attendance and feeding during the v^yuge. — 
 We lost some a few years ago, who died on the pas- 
 sage, which also happened to some of the large Ox- 
 fordshire sheep, imported by Messrs. Reybolds. 

This importation of Downs, selected as they have 
 l)cen, with so much car>;, we consider ouite an ac- 
 quisition to the country.

We publish two communications respecting t!)!S 
 fi'uit, and refrain {r.)m any rem irks at i)rosent our- 
 selves, till we have heard from J. Sl.itor, and obtain- 
 ed a pirticalar description of its growth, habit an I 
 character of the bh)ssom. Wo have also ordered 
 some plants of hiiu for comparison.

Owing to an accidental confusion of a few papers 
 of our last month's issue with that of the preceding 
 m nth, some of our suliscriber* received the wrouii 
 numljcr in the January cover. Where such a ni.,s- 
 tsik<' <ii'curre<l, we should be obliged by being inform- 
 ed of it, when the correct copy will be Immcdiatc- 
 Iv forwarded. 

Several valuable communications have been re- 
 ceived and will appear in our next, having been 
 crowded out by the proceedings of the State -Vgri- 
 cuUural Society, at its late meeting at Ilarrisburg.
