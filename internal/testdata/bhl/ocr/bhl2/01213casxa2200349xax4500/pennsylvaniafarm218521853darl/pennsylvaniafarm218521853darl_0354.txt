Editors of Farm Journal: 

In a paper like yourSj 
 ■we expect reliable authority, we can place none in 
 these back woods where writers are as learned as 
 the Botanists of England, and deem that the Straw- 
 berry belongs to a class of plants, that always blos- 
 soms perfect in male and female organs. From your 
 correspondent's notice of the Alice Maud, I take it 
 lor granted, that such is his view. The Alice Maud, 
 I have never seen. I am informed that itjs of the 
 Hermaphrodite character, and like the famous 
 Keens Seedling, only valuable as an impregnator, 
 where the sexual character is understood. Till re- 
 cently, in England, Pistillate plants were unknown, 
 and the result was, that their plants did not average 
 one-half of a crop of perfect fruit. If the Alice 
 IMaud is always perfect in both organs, and produces 
 a full crop of large perfect fruit, of good quality, it 
 would be inva'uable in England. They have never 
 yet seen such a plant.

I notice in your 
 January No., a description of the "Alice Maud" 
 Strawberry, by Mr. John Slater. That statement 
 does not apply to the variety named, and be must 
 have some other variety under the name designated. 
 The "Alice Maud" has been most fully tested by 
 Mr. G. W. Huntsman ^of this town, and myself. It 
 is an early berry, of rather large size, dark color, ly- 
 ing on or very near the ground; the plant is very un- 
 productive, producing usually but two good sized ber- 
 ries to a plant, and sometimes but one large bei-ry. — 
 It was cast out by every connoisseur here msny 
 J aars ago, as imrihlcss for Us barrenness; and this has 
 been the case with ever>/ Hermaphrodite variety hith- 
 erto introduced from England. It would have been 
 well if Mr. Slater had stated the sexuality of his 
 Strawberry, as that might guide one in deciding up- 
 on its true name, and as I have a specimen Straw- 
 berry Garden containing every estimable variety that 
 has yet been tested, he would be able to decide up- 
 on its true name by inspecting my Collection at the 
 fruiting season. I am preparing an article for the 
 Horticulturist descriptive of the characteristics of 
 "The Strawberry," and shall enumerate therein all 
 the varieties that are truly valuable, with descrip- 
 tions, for it is full time that the trash should be ex- 
 terminated, and that judicious selections based on 
 sexuality should replace them. 

Yours, very respectfully,

Dwarf Pear Tree on Q,uince Stock. 

The annexed is a speci- 
 men of a Dwarf Pear 
 Tree, of Louise Bonne 
 de Jersey variety. We 
 have before urged in 
 the pages of the Farm 
 Journal, this method 
 of cultivating the Pear, 
 and the annexed will 
 give a fair idea of a 
 dwarf tree in fruit. 

It offers several great 
 ad van t ages over the 
 ordinary mode on pear 
 stock. 

1st. They are more 
 hardy, and less liable 
 to blight. 

2nd. Some varieties 
 are oi finer flavor and 
 more perfect on the 
 quince, such as Du- 
 chesse d'Angoulfeme, 
 and White Doyenne. 

3d. They come into 
 bearing much sooner ; 
 generally the second 
 season after they are 
 planted, and often the 
 first. 

4th. They admit of 
 close planting, eight to 
 ten feet apart.andthus 
 return much larger 
 products for the space 
 occupied, answering 
 either for small gar- 
 dens, quite close to the 
 house, or extended or- 
 chard culture between 
 other trees. 

The roots of the quince are generally much more 
 fibrous than those of the pear and do not extend so 
 far, but draw their nourishment from a smaller space. 
 They therefore require a rich soil and free cultiva- 
 tion. Short manure should be dug around their 
 roots each fall. This will start them into vigorous 
 growth, the following season, and by pinching off the 
 young shoots to within three or four buds of their 
 base, towards midsummer, fruit buds are soon formed 
 and lateral branches, so as to give the true pyramid 
 shape, and make a thickly set, compact tree. Instead 
 of trimming up as is the usual custom, encouragement 
 should be given to the little spurs to form in all parts 
 of the tree. We have had two and three pears of 
 full size on these little spurs coming out from the 
 body of the tree, aot more than an inch long. A 
 small sized tree cR thus be made to bear abundant- 
 ly. The shape and height of the tree is entirely 
 within the control of the cultivator, by the judicious 
 pruning and pinching process. It may be kept at sis 
 feet if desired, and wo have seen them 15 to 18. 
 There is no more beautiful ornament for a lawn, than 
 a pyramid pear tree well supplied with fruit. 

It has been supposed that the Pear on Quince would 
 be a short lived tree. When grafted on the Angers 
 stock, this is found not to be the case, as trees are 
 now growing in some parts of the country 25 years 
 old, perfectly healthy and vigorous, and in England 
 and France have reached 50 years, with no sign of 
 decay.
