FiK. 1. 

Fig. l.Hosen ShenkPear.engraved from a drawing 
 by Dr. Brinckle. This Pear is a seedling raised by 
 John Shenk, of Manor township, Lancaster county, 
 supposed to be from the Virgalien or Butter. J. B. 
 Garber, page 197, present voL of Farm Journal, to 
 whose article the reader is referred, says, "the tree 
 is a vigorous and strong grower, far out growing the 
 old butter pear, and in comparison with that fine old 
 and now almost extinct variety, is superior in every 
 respect; the tree is large and more thrifty, the fruit j 
 larger and if possible more luscious, and the tree a ' 
 great bearer in a favorable soil and situation. It ri- ! 
 pens from the middle of August to the middle of 
 September, according to the season. 

Fig. 2, Chancellor. This is a fine variety, which | 
 has been exhibited for several seasons at the exhi- 
 bition of the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society, 
 Philadelphia. The original tree, we visited last ftill, 
 on the premises of W. Chancellor, on School House 
 Lane, near Germantown, is of large size, and appears 
 healthy and vigorous. It has probably stood there 
 for the last 50 years, and is said to bear abundant- 
 ly. We annex description by Dr. Brinkle : 

"Fruit large, nearly four inches long by three in 
 width ; form obovate, or obovate-pyriform ; skin 
 green, covered with minute brown specks, and some 
 russet blotches, with occasionally, though rarely, a 
 faint speckled brown cheek ; stem one inch long, 
 rather thick, and inserted in a small, irregular cavi- 

ty, sometimes elevated on one side ; calyx small, set 
 ma contracted basin; core medium; seed long, 
 yellowish brown ; flesh very melting : flavor rich and 
 exceedingly agreeable. Kipe last of September."
