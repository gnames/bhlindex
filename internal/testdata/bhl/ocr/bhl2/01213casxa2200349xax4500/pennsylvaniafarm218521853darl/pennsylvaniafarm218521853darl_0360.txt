'"Novor w;is a greater misnomor tli;in 'ifliisfja/ion-i' [ 
 ^vl)eIl applied to the representation of animals, as 
 put forth in most of our a^icnltural periodicals. I 
 know not wiiy a man should not feel himself as re-' 
 sp'insililo for the truth of the peneil as the pen, (if 
 decrees in truth were admissible,) I should say he is i 
 yet 7)iore so, inasmuch as ho proiesses to resort to it 
 by way of illiistrutiiif/ a subject better tisan it can be 
 done by the pen. 

"In many instances the pictorial additions to a 
 y)ublication are not important to the work itself — 
 they are often but embellishments: but 1 take it, such 
 is not the case when a State A'^i-icultnral Society f)ub- 
 lishes its doings and its awards, and iX,\yi:i>ipo)-trniLs of 
 the animals to which they have adjudged premiums, 
 as the best of their kind. — [See the transactions of 
 the N. Y. State Agricultural Societj' for 1851. 

'L ird Et-yholme' is evidently a sick animal. 

'E'lterville' is quite poetical, and delights the imag- 
 ination. 

'Azoiia,' I must suppose, has had great injustice 
 doiiH her, for such a hea 1 and such coarseness, could 
 hardl^f chiim the Urst premium in any society; where- 
 as I have been assured by those who have seen her, 
 that she is a very superior cow, though not (juite so 
 fine in the head as would be desirable. 

'Apricot' I doubt n )t, is well and truthfully repre- 
 sented. The engraving tells you she is young and 
 i mature, but of good promise. 

I now come to the premium 'Devon Cnv.'and only 
 wonder theovnier could do his herd such injustice as 
 to publish so gross a caricature; for America, I will 
 venture to believe, does not possess more finished or 
 better animals than belong to it; and the New York 
 Agricultural Si)ci(^ty, however its committees may 
 blunder, would hardly endorse this engraving as re- 
 preneatiiif/ the best Devon Cow on their ground in 
 that year. Yet this very representation is put forth 
 by the Society by way, 1 presume, of instrui;ting and 
 leaching the people what is the best model of a 
 Devon. 

Lastly the Hereford Bull, 'Tromp,' showing all the 
 characteristics of his breed, and looking in tkeenijni- 
 viiKj as though he well deserved the premium he was 
 awarded, strikes m ; as both true and artistic. M*-. 
 Fort>i's, the artist, drew, I doubt nut, what he saw be- 
 fore him, and has been vrell seeo.ided by Mr. Carson, 
 the engraver. 

While I condemn those attempts at portraits whi(di 
 libel their originals, we must admire the perfect in- 
 tegrity of purpose and truthful intent of their own- 
 ers, in thus entrusting the dcdineation of their beau- 
 tiful stock to the artists, without oversight or correc- 
 tion. 

These stand in strong contrast Uyihe xiiovahiis-lness- 
 like breeder, who orders his animals to be drawn al- 
 ter his own conceptions of the heaatifuJ, making them 
 what he would have them to be, rather than what 
 they are, and puts them forth as p)ortrait)i. 

I cannot, however, turn from the illustrati(ms in 
 the Transactions of 1851, Mithout noticing the beau- 
 tiful and artist-like execution of the portrait of a 
 French Mei'ino Kam, by M. Pjase. I have seen noth 
 ing in our Agricultural Periodicals so excellent in 
 either drawing O:- cuttiiig. The artist's nain% who 
 made the sk^itch, 1 am sorry to say, does not appear," 

"Weh^pe t) m\ke the Pennsylvania Farm Journal 
 a complete 11 ;rd book for our Sfate, and i( our sug- 
 gestion to breeilers in the last number, in respect to 
 registering pedigrees, should be carried out, accom- 
 panied a:5 our pag >s will be by appropriate illustra- 

tions of stock, we think it will make the most com- 
 plete and cheapest Herd book that could be gotten up. 
 Ue iiave made arrangements to have engravinirs 
 correctly executed, and if persons who choose to in- 
 cur the expense of this, the very ])est kind of an ad- 
 vertisement of their choice animals, will forward us 
 their daguerreotypes, we will attend to the engraving, 
 and see that ?k faithful copy is taken.

IIakrisburg, Tuesday, January 18, 1853. 

In accordance with the fourth section of its Con- 
 stitution, the Pennsylvania Agricultural Society, 
 met on the third Tuesday of Januarj', 185.3, in the 
 llall of the House of Repi-esentatives. 

A quorum of members being present, the meeting 
 was organized by the motion ot J. S. Haldeman, elec- 
 ting C. B. Trego as Secretary pro tern. 

On motion a committee of three, consisting of D, 
 xMumma, Jr., A. S. Roberts and J. Konigmacher, 
 were appointed to invite his Excellency, the Gover- 
 nor, and the heads ot Department, to be present da- 
 ring the meeting!;. 

A. 0. Iliester, Chairman of the Committee on Field 
 Crops, appointed for the last Annual Exhibition, made

REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OX FIELD 
 CROPS. 

The Committee on Field Crops in this, the first re- 
 port, beg leave to congratulate ihe Society'-, that 
 whilst the last census presents our noble State as first 
 amongst her Sisters in some of the most important 
 staple crops, in the aggr(>gafe, the interest excited 
 by our Agricultural Exhibition and the competion 
 elicited by the offer of honorable premiums, has 
 brought to our knowledge another fact, that without 
 extiaordinary attLUtion, and witliout any idea of com- 
 peting for premiums, at tln^ tim3 of planting ami du- 
 ring cultivation, we are also first and foremost among 
 our sister States in the production of particular field 
 crops. 

Tlie dissemination ( f Agricultural information 
 generally, and the reports of special results from par- 
 ticular modes of plowing, planting and mp.nuring, as 
 sent fortli by the S.ieiety, must exert a most health- 
 ful influence in awakening the energies of the far- 
 mer, and exciting a spirit of laudable rivalry and em- 
 ulation throughout the vState. And if such are to be 
 the results of our efforts, w.i may with great propriety 
 claim continued liberal patronage and public favor. 

The Committee would most respectfully at this 
 stage of their report, recommend a revision of the 
 premiums for field crops, so as to excite greater pub- 
 lic attention and competition, and that premiums 
 hereafter t \ be dispensed in a in')re liberal and exten- 
 ded manner. We owe it to the cause in which we 
 are engaged, and our present resources, and future 
 prospects will justify the additional inducement. 
 The fixther of his ountry has written, and it has 
 now become a household saying, that the man who 
 can make two blades of grass grow where but one 
 grew before, should ha considered a public benefactor. 
 Let us liberally reward thet^an.who by his industry, 
 skill and science, makes two bushels af wdieat grow 
 where but one grew before, and generously coramu- 
 nlcate to the sdciety his m inner of doing it. so that
