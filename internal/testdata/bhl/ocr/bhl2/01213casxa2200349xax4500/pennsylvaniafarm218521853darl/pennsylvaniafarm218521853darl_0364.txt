I do oertify that I assisted to produce the crop of Carrots 
 prown by Mr. Wilkinson, of the Mount Airy Ajrricultural 
 Institute, in 1,S52, ami that one acre, surveyed by Mr. L. II. 
 Gause, (Mathematical Teacher of the Institute,) produced 
 one thousand and seventeen bushels, good measure, per 
 acre, of the best shaped carrots, and best proportion of 
 tops, to the roots that I ever saw, and I have been familiar 
 with their production for the pnst ten years. 

I do further certify that this vifas the largest crop that I 
 ever assisted to harvest, and the extraordinary yield, was 
 owing to the liberal, thorough, and scientific manner in 
 which the crop was manured and cultivated.
