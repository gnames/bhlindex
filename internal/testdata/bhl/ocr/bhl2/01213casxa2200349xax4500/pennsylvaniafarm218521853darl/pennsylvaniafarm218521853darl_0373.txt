Japau Pea. 

We introduce the following interesting correspon- 
 dence from a Boston paper, relating to the "Japan 
 Pea," which is now exciting some attention as a new 
 article of farm crops. The whole plant tviih the seed, 
 is recommended as excellent for fattening hogs and 
 cattle. 

Massachusetts Horticultural Society. — The ac- 
 companying letter from Mr. Ernst, was read at the 
 last meeting of the Soeiety. and being deemed of suf- 
 ficient importance to the Agricultural community, it 
 was ordered to be published. 

Spring Garden, Cincinnati, Ohio, Jan. 11th, 1853. 
 .My Dear Sir: I herewith send you lor distribution 
 amongst the members of the M. II. Society, a small 
 parcel of peas. 

The growth of the plantis peculiar, being of an up- 
 right and stiff form, somewhat branching ; the leaves 
 are large, light-green and downy beneath ; the blos- 
 som is small, and of lilac-color ; seed-pods numerous, 
 small and woolly ; growing in clusters over the en- 
 tire plant, proving very productive. 

Its habit of growth is such as to lit it to withstand 
 severe storms ; and, should it prove valuable as food 
 for cattle, it must commend itself to the agricultural 
 community in field culture. 

In its cultivation it evidently requires room, to 
 enable the plant a full development for branching. 
 Its bearing properties are immense. 

Accompanying the seeds, I send a plant, to sho.v 
 its habits of growth and bearing properties. 

Its origin is said to have been Japan. It was in- 
 troduced into this country some two years since by 
 the agency of one of those calamities which some- 
 times result in benefit to mankind. 

An American ship encountered a Japan vessel in 
 distress, and the crew were carried to San Francis- 
 co, California. Amongst the stores which were trans- 
 ferred was the "Japan pea," a few of which found 
 their way into the hands of Dr. Edwards, of Alton, 
 111. He handed them over to Mr. J. H. Ladd,a distin- 
 guished horticulturist, who presented the produce to 
 our society. Those now sent you were grown in my 
 grounds ; having fully matured in our climate. Your 
 climate may prove too severe. 

I have sent small packages of seed to kindred as- 
 sociations, with the request that they be placed in 
 careful hands. 

It is possible that it may not be any thing new 
 with you. I would be thankful for any information 
 you may possess in reference to it. 

A'^ery respectfully, A. II. Ernst. 

The plants and seeds were submitted to the in- 
 spection of the Society's distinguished botanist and 
 vegetable physiologist, J. E. Teschemacher, Esq., 
 and in return, received the following note : 

Ml/ Bear Sir : The plant alluded to by Mr. Ernst, 
 is Cajanus bicolor, a native of East Indies, Amboy- 
 na, Japan, &c. ; flower small, interior yellow, vexil- 
 lum purple, erect shrub, pubescent, nearest in alli- 
 ance to Lupinus. The seeds are good to eat, and, 
 when young, very delicate. On soaking the round 
 seeds for an hour in moderately hot water, the}- take 
 exactly the form and appearance of the common 
 white bean, become quite tender, and have a pure 
 and delicious nutty and oily flavor. The whole plant, 
 with the seed, is excellent for fattening/ hoijs and cattle. 

There is one other species, Cajanus flavus, com- 
 mon in South America and the West Indies, where 
 it is sometimes used for a fence to sugar plantations. 
 In Jamaica, this species is u.uch used for feeding 

pigeons, and is there called the pigeon-pea. In Mar- 
 tinique the seed is much esteemed for the table. 

Being a tropical plant, it would hardly stand our 
 winters. Yet, from the observations of Mr. Ernst, it 
 is not impi'obable that our climate might admit of an 
 annual harvest of the seed, which seems to be so 
 abundantly produced as to make an experiment high- 
 ly interesting. 

Most truly yours, J. E. Teschemacher, 

Boston, 19th Jan., 1853. 

P. S. These particulars I furnished to Hon. N. 
 P. "Wilder a week ago, imagining they would be laid 
 before the society.

Japanese Gardens. — The gardeners of Japan dis- 
 play the most astonishing art. The plum tree, which 
 IS a ^reat favorite, is so trained and cultivated that 
 the blossoms are as big as those of dahlias. Their 
 great triumph, however, is to bring both plants and 
 trees into the compass of the little garden attached 
 to the houses in the cities. With this view; they 
 have gradually succeeded in dwarfing the fig, plum 
 and cherry trees, and the vine, to a size so diminu- 
 tive as scarcely to be credited by an European; and 
 yet these dwarf trees are covered with blossoms and 
 leaves. Some of the gardens resemble pictures in 
 which nature is beautifully modelled in miniature — 
 but it is living nature! May Ion, whose work on Ja- 
 pan was published at Amsterdam, in 1830, states that 
 in 1828 the Dutch agent of commerce at Nagansi, 
 was offered "a snuff box, one inch in thickness, and 
 three inches high, in which grew a fig tree, a bam- 
 boo, and a plum tree in full bloom." — [Exchange.

How TO Judge Cattle. — In all domestic animals, 
 the skin or hide forms one the best means by 
 which to estimate their fattening properties. In 
 the handle of oxen, if the hide be found soft and silky, 
 it affords a proof of tendency to take meat. A 
 beast having a perfect touch will have a thick, loose 
 skin, floating, as it were, on a layer of soft fat, N'ield- 
 ing to the slightest pressure, and springing back to- 
 wards the finger like a piece of soft leather. Such 
 a skin will be usually covered with an abundance of 
 soft, glossy hair, feeling like a bed of moss, and 
 hence it is ever termed a mossy skin. But a thick- 
 set, hard, short hair always handles h ird, and in- 
 dicates a hard feeder. — N Y, Farmer. 

There is a deal of valuable information embraced 
 in the above short article. The handling of animals- 
 we always considered a most important point, in se- 
 lecting a good feeder, and it is entirely too much 
 neglected. Nothing but practice will make one un- 
 derstand the difference in this particular. We have 
 heard capital judges say, they would prefer to buy 
 with their eyes shut, if they were allowed to handle 
 an animal, rather than to judge by appearance only, 
 without handling. 

Breaking Steers. — Never use force. When you 
 wish to put the yoke on for the first time, coax them 
 with an car of corn or a little salt. After they are 
 yoked don't use the whip, but induce them to follow 
 you for the corn or other feed you ofier them. In 
 that way you will save yourself much trouble, and 
 your faithful servants much fear. — Ajricultor.
