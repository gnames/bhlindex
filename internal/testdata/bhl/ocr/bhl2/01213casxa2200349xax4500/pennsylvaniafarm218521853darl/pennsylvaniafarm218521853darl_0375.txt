TRUE SYSTEM OF FARMING— SUBSOIL PLOW. 

359 

The Ti'ue System of Farmiug, 

Trying to do too much, is a eommoa error into 
 which the farmer often fal's. His great eagerness in 
 sti'iving to be rich, is doubtless the cause of his error. 
 He is ambitious and energetic, and forms his phxns on 
 a largo scale, too often, perhaps, withoutcounting the 
 cost. lie buys a large farm, and wants to bo called 
 a. "lai'ge farmer," without understandinj; or consider- 
 ing the true elements that constitute a real farmer. 
 He fancies the greatness of that profession, as is too 
 often the common estimate,to be in proportion to the 
 number of acres, not to say cultivated, but embraced 
 within the boundaries of his domain. The fact is 
 now being spread abroad, that a large farm does not 
 make a man either rich, contented or happy, but on 
 the contrary, the reverse of all these, unless well 
 tilled, when his labor is rewarded by ample crops and 
 fair success in the various departments in which he 
 is engaged. No farmer can realize the full benefits 
 of his profession without adopting a thorough sys- 
 tem of culture. Ills success, commensurate to his 
 wishes, always depends upon the manner in which 
 he prepares his grounds, plants his seed, and rears 
 Iiis stock. Neither of these departments, which may 
 be considered the cardinal ones of his profession, will 
 take care of themselves. The soil may be rich, but 
 it needs culture. Ilis seed may be sown, but it 
 should be in due time, and always on soil well pre- 
 pared and of a suitable quality for the production of 
 the crop desired. His stock must be constantly cared 
 for — for it derives its thrift from the soil, and sends 
 again to that soil the sustenance it requires: but this 
 is not done in a loose, hap-hazard way. The far- 
 mer's care is required, and all his better judgment 
 must be exercised in keeping up this system of recip- 
 rocal benefits that may be realized by every intelli- 
 gent and industrious farmer. 

Thorough cultivation and systematic attention to 
 all parts of his business is indispensable to a good de- 
 gree of success. The very corner stone to this whole 
 system of farming, is to do what you do thoroughly; 
 nature will not be cheated, and never gives full re- 
 turns to the half-way work that is practiced by vast- 
 ly too many calling themselves farmers. If the land 
 has been worn, the extent of that exhaustion and the 
 food required, must be first considered. When as- 
 certained, the full measure of these requirements 
 must be given, to bring out full returns. If the far- 
 mer has but a small stock, and consequently but a 
 small amount of manure to replenish his land, it is 
 obvious that but a small farm can be supplied with 
 it; and good judgment at once dictates that to culti- 
 vate properly a large farm, artificial fertiliz(^rs must 
 be used if good crops are obtained. And so with 
 the labor, two men cannot suitably till one hundred 
 acres of land, when the labor of two men and per- 
 haps four, might be profitably employed on seventy- 
 five acres. 

This is the great error in fiirming. Two men 
 strive to do what four can hardly do, and thus thous- 
 ands of acres arc run over, half tilled, and producing 
 half crops. The Lmd is run over till worn out, sus- 
 taining year after year the unnatural tax, till its en- 
 ergies are entirely exhausted, and it fails to yield 
 even a feeble crop, because its life is worn out. Much 
 of the soil in Virginia and other Southern States is a 
 type of this. Thousands of acres are lying entirely 
 useless and exhausted, and will ever remain so, till 
 the first elements of its power are returned to it. 
 This process is fast going on in many of the Western 
 States. The soil is treated like an inexhaustible 
 mine; the tillers crying give, give, give! till in a few 
 years it will have nothing to give. The boast of the 

West is, large farms and large fields of grain; plow, 
 sow, and reap, is the business of western farmers, 
 drawing out the very life of the soil, and sending 
 away in the heavy exports that are constantly going 
 onward, without returning to the soil the food it re- 
 quires to make it productive. 

The light that is being spread abroad on this sub- 
 ject, is begining to correct this practice to some ex- 
 tent, but in most instances very little is returned to 
 the soil to keep it alive, till after several years ot 
 continual cropping, it manifests signs of exhaustion, 
 and ultimate barreress. When tillers of the soil 
 understand their true interests, they will cultivate no 
 more land than they can do well. Fifty acres of land 
 for tillage, brought to a high state of cultivation, pays 
 better than one hundred run over in the way that 
 many do. — [Jeflferson Farmer.

New Subsoil Companion Plow. 

The Oxford (Eng.) Journal, in speaking of the 
 Stow-on-the-wold and Chipping Norton Agricultural 
 Society, says: "As soon as the plowing was over, the 
 company congregated to witness the trial of a sub- 
 soil companion plow, manufactured and patented by 
 Mr. Gillett, of Brailes. This plow is so construct- 
 ed that it combines all the features of an ordinary 
 plow with the addition of a subsoil plow, which may 
 be used at the same time, or detached or suspended 
 if necessar3^ The combination of these advantages 
 naturally excited considerable interest, as to whether 
 the implement could fufil what was expected and 
 said of it, and its trial was looked to with great anx- 
 iety. The land selected for the trial was by no means 
 adapted for it, because it was light and rocky; and, 
 therefore, the plow could not sufficiently develop its 
 powers, and this was admitted on all hands; but the 
 inventor felt satisfied that even under such disadvan- 
 tages it would give a tolerable idea of its value and 
 importance. In that conviction he was fully borne 
 out by the trial, for the work was well executed, and 
 the subsoil plow taking the lower furrow and follow- 
 ing in the horses' track, showed at once its perfect ap- 
 plicability, especially for stiff, heavy land, where the 
 horses, tread renders the ground so hard as to prevent 
 the possibility of the Avater getting away. For all 
 root crops this implement appears to be admirably 
 adapted, and in plowing for Beans, or after Turnips, 
 the manure can be most advantageously plowed in, 
 so as to leave it near the surface, which every one is 
 aware is a most desirable object. The gencl-al opin- 
 ion of all who examined this plow, and witnessed 
 even this trial, was, tliat it is one of the most valua- 
 ble implements that has yet been brought before the 
 notice ot the public, for it not only possesses the ad- 
 vantages of plowing and subsoiling at the same time, 
 and with one operation, but the cost of this combin- 
 ed power is but a trifle beyond the ordinary plow,and 
 the subsoil can be attached to any plow, while the 
 draught is but slightly increased by it. The cost of 
 the plow complete does not exceed six guineas,and the 
 subsoil alone, to be attached to any other pluw, two 
 guineas; s(» tiiat the expense is not likely to interfere 
 with the demand for an implement which must come 
 intog(>ncral use as soon as parties become acquainted 
 with its merits. We understand that the patentee 
 has already received numerous orders; and of all the 
 improvements which have been devised for the prep- 
 aration of the land to receive seed, there is not one 
 which is so calculated to ofi'ect its purpose in a more 
 successful manner, and there is no implement of the 
 possession of which a farmer may be prouder. It is 
 not anticipating too much to say.that within a twelve
