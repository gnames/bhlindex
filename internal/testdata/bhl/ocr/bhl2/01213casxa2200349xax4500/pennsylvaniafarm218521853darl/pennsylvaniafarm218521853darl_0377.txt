Iiai'ge crops of Corn raised iu Chester county. Pa. 

The following account of some extraordinary crops 
 of corn raised by our friends, the IMessrs. I:>ickey, 
 of this county, will be read with interest. There are 
 two or three points worthy of especial notice. Ist, 
 that it was drilled in, in rows 3 J- feet apart, that the 
 land was ploughed deep, and by the repeated har- 
 rowing and cultivation, the weeds were destroyed 
 previous to planting. This plan of lessening labor 
 by frequent harrowings, previous to the crop being 
 put in the ground, we have adverted to in our article 
 on root culture in the present No., and often at oth- 
 er times. AVe have heard of several other crops of 
 corn the present season in this county, varying from 
 80 to near 100 bushels to the acre. 

It seems to take Chester count}' farmers to raise 
 corn. I'iie late premium crop of George Walker, of 
 Susquehanna county, of 160 bushels to the acre, 
 when reported here, excited some surprise, till it was 
 ascertained that lie was one of our own Chester coun- 
 ty farmers, born here, and had moved to that county, 
 carrving with him his a'jrricultural skill and knowl- 
 edge how to raise big crops.
