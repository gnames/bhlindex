ing it all an equal chance to come to maturity. Con- 
 sequently, when the wheat is gathered, the product 
 is found to be much greater than when sown broad- 
 cast, in many instances, from twenty to twenty-five 
 per cent., and some times even more. 

Taking all things into consideration, I should pre- 
 fer the drill to either the harrow or the plow, as bet- 
 ter suited to the wants of nature, therefore, more 
 profitable to the fiirmer. A great deal more might 
 be said, but as these remarks have already been pro- 
 tracted beyond their intended limits, I will close >' 
 not, however, with the presumption that you should 
 adopt my views simply, but confidently hoping that 
 you will be awake to a judicious inquiry by practi- 
 cal experiments, and thereby be enabled more fully 
 to judge for yourselves. 

In ccnclusion, I beg your attention to a few ex- 
 tracts, in confirmation of my preference for the drill. 
 Mr. John Jones, of New Castle county, Delaware, 
 says, "When I commenced drilling, and for two or 
 three years, I was ridiculed by my neighbors ; some 
 would advise me to take the implement home, break 
 it up, and cook my dinner with it. I, however, dis- 
 regarded their jeers, and persevered. And now, the 
 best evidence that I can possibly bring forward in 
 support of the drill over the broadcast system, is the 
 fact that all my neighbors have adopted the drill for 
 sowing their wheat and most other small grain. I 
 am much in favor of sowing with the drill, and of 
 thin sowing. I harvested twenty-four bushels per 
 acre from a field of eighty acres in 1847, from eighty- 
 eight and a-7iaZ/" bushels sowing with the drill." He 
 also says: "The experiments with the drill and 
 broadcast on Dr. C. Noble's field, resulted in a yield 
 of twenty-seven bushels per acre of broadcast, where 
 two bushels had been sown : and thirty-Jive per acre, 
 where one and one-fourth bushels had been sown 
 from the drill ; land similar in every respect ; the 
 variety of wheat, Mediterranean ; showing an in- 
 crease in favor of the drilled, of eight bushels per 
 acre, besides the saving of seed. The yield of ad- 
 ditional straw on the drilled acre, 12 per cent. Yield 
 of additional wheat on the drilled acre, 27 per cent." 

For a more full account, see Patent Office Report 
 for 1848, page 467 ; also Monthly Journal of Agri- 
 culture, for 1846, vol 1, p. 586. 

An account of very int-eresting experiments made 
 by a member of the "Society of Friends," and laid 
 before the Council of the "Royal Agricultural Soci- 
 ety of England," proves that wide drilling will yield 
 more per acre than narrow, with the same quantity 
 of seed, — that the rows should be at least nine inch- 
 es apart. See Monthly Journal of Agriculture for 
 1846, vol. 1., p. 461.

 Iictter from H. Shubert, on Imported Cattle. 

A premium has been awarded at the late exhibi- 

tion of the S. A. S., for Ilolstein cattle. Twenty 
 years ago, when traveling in Europe, I went through 
 Ilolstein, so famed for Ilolstein butter. 

The Dutcliy of Ilolstein is situated at the mouth 
 of the Elbe, where it flows into the North sea. The 
 Elbe is one of the largest rivers in Germany. In its 
 course of 800 miles through the most fertile part of 
 Germany, it brings down a rich alluvial soil, which 
 is thrown back to the shore by the setting in of the 
 tide. Every year some land is gained at the mouth 
 of the river, in throwing up dikes to keep out the 
 tide. This alluvial soil, becoming mixed with Phos- 
 phate, so abounding in the sea, forms the richest pas- 
 ture of natui-al grass, not to be equalled. It is the 
 saying of the cow-herds there, (perhaps a little exage- 
 rated,) that, on loosing the staff in the evening, in 
 driving the cows together, they cannot find it the 
 next evening, the grass having grown over it. This 
 rich soil is along the river. Eight or ten miles from 
 it, into the interior, the soil is poor, and of course 
 the cattle looks poor. Is that not a sufficient proof 
 of the folly to import the Ilolstein Cattle, unless the 
 pasture is also imported. 

The milch veins of cows develope themselves in 
 proportion as the cows are well taken care of, and 
 have a rich pasture. Phosphate is a main requisite 
 to produce the quality and quantity of milk. The 
 soil in Pennsylvania is deficient of it, but in our 
 Western States the soil contains more, therefore the 
 Western cattle are superior to the Pennsylvania cat- 
 tle. Crossing certainly improves the breed, but that 
 can be as well obtained in bringing the breed from 
 our Westei'n States, than to bring them from Europe 
 with the appendage of a pompous pedigree.

Hybrid Ducks. 

Messrs. Editors; — 

Has the assertion in the Books* 
 that the female hybrid progeny of the musk and com- 
 mon duck, "will pair with the common drake and 
 jyroduce a good sort," ever been verified by you or any 
 of your fowl amateurs; or is it like much of the stuff 
 in Poultry Books — nonsensical? 

Some beautiful hybrids were raised here in 1851, 
 some of which were exhibited at the State Fair, where 
 their large size and beautiful appearance were much 
 admired. They were as much in demand for breed- 
 ing stock, as Mr. Newbold's Capons. 

One of the finest of the ducks was kept all last 
 season with a large common drake, but never pro- 
 duced an egg. Will she begin when a year older to 
 ''produce a good sort?" NOVICE.
