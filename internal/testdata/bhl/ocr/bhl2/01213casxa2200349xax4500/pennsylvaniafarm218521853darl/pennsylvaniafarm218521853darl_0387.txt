visit the trees for the purpose of searching aft('r in 
 Beets; and even where they have perforated the fruit 
 it has been more on account of the larvae it contained, 
 than for the fruit itself. Some years ago a neighbor 
 of mine was wont to take a station near a fine tree of 
 ox heart cherries, and remain there (gun in hand and 
 powder flask well filled) all day, shooting indiscrim- 
 inately every thing bearing the form of a bird that 
 dared approach it; and at each ehot I ween he de- 
 stroyed more fruit than all the birds that visited it 
 for that purpose would in a whole day; besides do- 
 ing an incalculable injury to the tree in permitting 
 the insect broods to mature, by keeping off their na- 
 tural enemies. I have often even doubted the utility 
 of setting up scare-crows, to prevent birds from visit- 
 ing corn fields in the spring; for they just as often 
 are after the various kinds of insect larvae, especially 
 cut-worms, (which their instincts teach them are 
 somewhere in the vicinity of the corn hill) as they 
 are after the corn itself; particularly after the corn 
 has germinated. Witness, for instance, how indus- 
 triously and regularly crows,black-birds, Robins, &c., 
 will follow the furrow in spring plowing, and eagerly 
 darting after every-thing of a creeping nature that is 
 turned up by the farmer. Some of the Gallinaceous 
 families, or common fowls, &c., especially turkeys, 
 perform an important ofiice as insect scavengers, and 
 therefore large stocks of poultry might be made profit- 
 able to the farmer in more ways than one. It is well 
 known to tobacco growers, that a flock of turkeys 
 turned into a tobacco field, will, for the time being, 
 perform as much labor, almost, and as well, as so ma- 
 ny persons. In order to restore a healthy equilibri- 
 um between birds and insects, the destruction of the 
 former should be prevented by public opinion or 
 stringent laws. In this enlightened age, the merci- 
 less destruction of Tom-Tits, Catbirds, and Sparrows, 
 is a species of "sport" of a very equivocal character; 
 and the sooner it is brought to an end, the better fur 
 the cause of Agriculture, and of common humanity

 Landscape Gardening, No. II. 

This embraces three distinct branches, united, yet 
 differing materially in their scientific principles. The 
 first, street gardening, I briefly alluded to in my last, 
 and shall now speak of the second or suburban style. 

In forming a garden, around, behind, or before a 
 house in the suburbs of our cities, the first thing to 
 be looked at is the architectural structure of the 
 building. If it be in the Gothic style, the gardener 
 must study, as far as the ground will admit, to con- 
 form to the same general effect, viz : to have an un- 
 even surface, introducing groups and walks and 
 terraced borders. This must be done with a strict 

eye to chastity of design, the least variation from 
 which will make the whole a burlesque. 

If the structure is of the Corinthian order, then 
 the more plain and simple the better, either by mak- 
 ing figures mathematically.with box or other edging, 
 the whole forming beds for flowers, to be planted ac- 
 cording to their different species, or by laying the 
 whole down in grass, and out of this cutting irregu- 
 lar figures or scrolls, so that the grass is kept clear 
 of them. Nothing is worse than to stud the lawa 
 with promiscuous planting. 

It is of the greatest importance that the ground 
 should be properly graded, and to do this it is not 
 necessary to turn every thing up side down; all alter- 
 ations are not improvements; which we see by every 
 day's experience. 

"Cut, cut, he cries, yon gloomy trees. 
 Lay low yon ivied pine." 

This is easier done than remedied afterwards. The 
 gardener should go to work cautiously. In grading 
 and planting, for suburban gardens, it is his duty to 
 look around, and take advantage of all that is beau- 
 tiful, and cover up what is disagreeable. Plant ev- 
 ergreens of dense habit to keep the latter out of sight, 
 such as the Norway Fir, and grade the ground so aa 
 to open up even to a landscape view of your neigh- 
 bor's glade. All this can easily be done by a real 
 gardener, who understands his business. "My place 
 ought to look welljit costme adeal of money." "Yes, 
 it might have cost you one half less and looked a 
 great deal better. The fault is your own, you knew 
 nothing of the matter yourself, and you entrusted 
 it to one who knew less." Here is the secret, the ex- 
 perienced and professional gardener wants two dol- 
 lars a day; the other will work for a dollar. The one 
 dollar a day man, takes six weeks to spoil and make 
 bad, look worse. The other would have accomplish- 
 ed in two weeks, and made it look right. Which is 
 the cheapest? 

After grounds are properly adjusted and put in or- 
 der, no great talent or large experience is required to- 
 keep them so. The little exertion required, combined 
 as it is, with the purest and most rational enjoyment, 
 amounts to but recreation; and often results in reno- 
 vated health, increased appetite, and at night refresh- 
 ing sleep, cheating the Doctor out of his fee. I often 
 hear ladies (to whom the cultivation of flowers prop- 
 crly belongs) exclaim, I like to have my beds and 
 borders in proper order, but housework interferes 
 and takes all my time; and besides, if fixed up ever 
 so well in the morning, the children will have it all 
 torn down in the evening. By your leave,fair ladies, , 
 this objection will not hold good. Whenever I see a 
 disordered and dirty garden, I am prepared to see 
 the same kind of a kitchen; and the children may be 
 as easily trained to let the flowers alone, as the por- 
 celain. You have taught them not to break a cup, or 
 enter the parlor with dirty feet; and surely, the little
