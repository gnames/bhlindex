 blown rose, and other beautiful productions of nature, 
 than to wish to destroy. Instill into them a love of 
 the beautiful in nature, and you will have no difficul-

 Farm Fences. 

Messrs. Editors : — 

Within the last year I have ob- 
 tained possession of a farm containing a little over 
 one hundred acres; lying in the form of a right an- 
 gle parallelogram, and which, according to the advice 
 •of some of our most skillful and most experienced 
 farmers, I design dividing into ten enclosures of equal 
 ■ dimensions; but which I find, according to my esti- 
 mate of intended improvements, will require 1330 
 panels of post and rail fence, costing, here, %\ 12J 
 per panel, making $1492 52. 

This appears to be a very large sum to expend for 
 ; the purpose of confining my own cattle in my fields 
 and those of other persons ofi" them; but as we are 
 required by the laws of our State to erect good line 
 fences for the benefit of others, or submit to the dep- 
 redations committed upon us by their cattle, I sup- 
 pose it is idle to complain of so unjust a tax. 

If our own State can be taken as a criterion, I feel 
 confident there has been more money expended with- 
 in the last two years, in erecting and repairing fen- 
 ces, than one third of our farms would sell for, and 
 that it will exceed the cost of all our towns and cities 
 combined. It is this enormous burden which, like 
 an incubus, has been keeping down the agricultural 
 interests of our country; and the freedom from it 
 which has enabled the North of Europe, with a cli- 
 mate not as genial as our own, and a more indifi'erent 
 system of culture, to undersell us in the markets of 
 England. 

And since we are denied protection from foreign 
 imposition, I think if we wish to compete with Eu- 
 ropean labor, we must seek a release from the heavy 
 taxes imposed upon us at home, both by ourselves 
 and by the laws of our State; and expend those tax- 
 es in improving our farming. 

My design in writing, Messrs. Editors, is to call 
 the attention of farmers to the enormous cost of fenc- 
 ing our farms; for I am confident not one in a hun- 
 dred could tell you what the enclosing and subdivi- 
 fiion of their farms cost them; and also to inquire, 
 through the "Farm Journal," of some one experienc- 
 ed in the soiling system, whether it would not be 
 greatly to my advantage to remove all my division 
 fences on my farm, of which there are are enough to 
 form the half of the out line fence3,and to expend the 
 money which it would require to divide it into ten 
 fields, (amounting to $855 00 in the erectionof sheds 
 the making of manure, and otherwise improving my 

farm ? If so, what grain and grasses, and what num- 
 ber of acres of each it would require to support 25 
 head of cattle through the summer ? What kind of 
 roots, and what quantity, would be necessary for win- 
 ter feed? Also, how many acres less will it require 
 to support those cattle by soiling than by pasturing 
 and what labor it will require to attend to them; with 
 any other information which would be of benefit to 
 one unacquainted with the soiling system. It seems 
 to me that the greater quantity and improved quali. 
 ty of the manure made, with the produce of the land 
 which the fences would otherwise occupy, amounting 
 to one and two-thirds acres, would pay for the labor; 
 and that the interest of the money invested in fen- 
 cing, with the repairs, and the produce of the land 
 saved by soiling instead of pasturing, would be clear 
 gain. I do hope some one acquainted with the soil- 
 ing system will be kind enough to answer my que.

 Dwarf Ijocust. 

As an ornamental tree, nothing can be more beau- 
 tiful than the Rose Acacia, or^dwarf locust, grafted 
 upon the yellow locust. In addition to the beautiful 
 profusion of flowers which it bears, the foliage, and 
 top of the tree (which is round, umbrella shaped) 
 is beautiful. The flowers are much larger and more 
 abundant than when grown on its own root.; and 
 when grafted in the spring in the ordinary way,grow8 
 very er\sy. I have never had one scion to fail; but 
 they grow so rapid, and bear such a profusion of flow- 
 ers the first year, that the flowers must be broken ofi", 
 and the grafts shortened in, or they will break down 
 before they have formed a connection with the main 
 stem. But after the first year they become strong at 
 the connexion, but they should still be shortened in 
 a little, or they will sometimes break down when in 
 bloom. 

The curiosity a person has to see them in bloom, 

and the regret one feels in cutting ofi" the grafts 

when growing so beautiful, frequently causes their 

destruction the first year; which is certain unless 

they are shortened in and the flowers broken off.

 Basket Willow. 

The subject of raising willows for basket making 
 and other purposes, mentioned in the Farm Journal 
 for February, is worthy the attention of those having 
 lands suitable for growing them; but our experience 
 has, I think, not been sufficient to determine the kind 
 best suited to the purpose in this country, and the con- 
 fusion as regards names among those who have under- 
 taken to describe the numerous species, render it ve- 
 ry difficult to obtain the less common European spe. 
 cies true to name. Of the alba, which is the Hunt.
