ingdon Willow.described in Shelby's work on British 
 forest trees; I obtained a tree imported four years 
 ago from England; it is a fast growing, upright tree, 
 And is described as among the largest growing of the 
 genus; it is rather less spreading in habit than the 
 Russelliana, and appears likely to be as suitable as 
 that species for most purposes for which they are 
 used; the shoot of both I suppose will be found too 
 coarse for fine work. — The Russelliana, the Bedford 
 willow of London and Selby, is the best known here 
 of any imported species,except the weeping willow and 
 yellow willow {Babylomca and Vitellina), being our 
 large common green willow. Loudon, who mentions 
 170 species as introduced into Britain, names as best 
 for basket making, the following species, viz : Vimin- 
 alis, which he describes as growing from ten to twen- 
 ty feet high; Forbyana, five to eight feet; Decipiens, 
 thirty to forty feet; Helix, ten to twelve; Vitellina, 
 thirty to forty; and Purpurea, three to four feet; and 
 besides, mentions Rubra, triandra, acuminata, and 
 some others as suitable. Of Viminalis I have twice 
 purchased a specimen tree under that name,and have 
 one growing, but am satisfied that I have not the 
 species described by Evelyn, or Loudon,as Viminalis, 
 I have the Forbyana from three different persons,and 
 believe that I have the species correct; this makes 
 long slender shoots; I have one before me seven feet 
 long and one-third of an inch in diameter at the base, 
 and it appears to be the most suitable for baskets. 

The decipiens or Welsh Varnished willow, much 
 cultivated as basket willow in England.docs not here 
 make shoots equal in length, and I judge will not be 
 equal to the Bedford willow, with which it is classed. 
 The Vitellina is our common yellow willow, and is 
 generally known. The Rubra and acuminata ap- 
 pear promising,! but have not yet headed them down. 

In order to obtain shoots for basket making and 
 other purposes, of the large growing species, such as 
 alba, russelliana, fragilis, Vitellina, decipiens, &c.,it is 
 necessary to permit the root to acquire strength be- 
 fore heading down,and then to take off the trunk and 
 branches at the height of six or eight feet, after 
 which it will only require the sprouting surface to be 
 diminished, if the shoots are too abundant and not 
 long enough, or if the shoots are too strong, then to in- 
 crease the sprouting surface, by leaving a few inches 
 of the base of the shoot uncut, to produce shoots the 
 succeeding year. But for the Forbyana and other 
 small species, it is best to cut them near the ground, 
 and they may be planted near together. I have sev- 
 eral tufts or branches of the Forbyana planted about 
 three feet apart, which are annually cut down, and 

produce abundance of good shoots every year. 

But apart from the value of the several species for 
 economical purposes, several of them may be used 
 with advantage as ornamental trees and shrubs, among 
 these, the Caprca or goat willow,with broad, oval leaf, 
 is highly ornamental, more especially the male plant 

during the flowering season. The Pentandra has 
 smooth and glossy leaves, broader than is usual in 
 the genus, with the odor of the Evergreen Bany tree; 
 this is probably the most beautiful species. 

The daphnoides and pomeranica have dark glossy 
 bark, covered with a fine bloom. The Rotundata is 
 remarkable for its nearly circular leaves. The Roi- 
 marinifolia, a shrub five or six feet high, has leaves 
 resembling the common rosemary. The Croweana 
 an English species, growing to the height of ten feet, 
 is among the most beautiful at the time of flowering. 
 The difference of the species in form, size, and color; 
 the general adaptation to, and great luxuriance in 
 rich, cool, moist soils; should entitle them to a place 
 in ornamental plantations, where the soil situation 
 and other circumstances, are suitable.

Messrs. Editors : 

There being no abatement of 
 the "fowl mania," but rather an increase of the "pre- 
 monitory symptoms," in various sections of the coun- 
 try — it may not be amiss to give you the result of an 
 experiment on a small scale, by one who has had a 
 slight affection — it may interest some of the many 
 readers of the Farm Journal. 

I would, however, wish to be understood that I did 
 not take the disease in the ordinary way, but rather 
 had it forced upon me by a very particular friend, 
 (who shall be nameless) and who had been even then, 
 nearly a year since, completely impressed with the 
 affection. Time and again would he urge me to go 
 into the "ranks of the fancy," showing conclusively 
 (at least to his own mind) that this "mania" was no 
 mania at all, but a bona fide fact, a matter of dollars 
 and cents. That the breeding of the celebrated fowls 
 was a more lucrative investment than any thing on 
 which the farmers could at present employ their time 
 and means. Stating that these fowls require less 
 feed and would lay more eggs than our ordinary dung 
 hill breeds, and were intrinsically of far greater val- 
 ue, &c., &c. 

Well, you see, Messrs. editors, as I am rather of a 
 phlegmatic temperament, I was too slow, behind 
 the age, &c. Not "turning my spoon right side up 
 when such golden showers were falling," in time to 
 secure a share of the benefits accruing. As my 
 friend — who, by the by, is contrary to myself, of a 
 very affectionate and ardent temperament— could not 
 rest easy until he should succeed in some way to en- 
 list me in tha fowl cause, and as no other mode would 
 seem to answer the purpose, he very liberally (tliough; 
 it may have been only a bait thrown out to infect me 
 with the prevailing mania) offered me three eggs of 
 "Shanghaes" as a present — of course so disinterested
