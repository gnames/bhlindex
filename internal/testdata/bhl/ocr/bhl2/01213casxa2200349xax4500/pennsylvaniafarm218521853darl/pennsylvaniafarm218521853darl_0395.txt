The portraits of bull and cow on opposite page, 
 engraved from daguerreotype likenesses, are speci- 
 mens of what may be attained by scientific and judi- 
 cious crosses of choice native stock, with selected tho- 
 rough bred Durham bulls. They are grade animals, 
 the bull being 15-16, and the cow f Durham, and are 
 fully equal in some points to thorough breds. They 
 were bred and are now owned by A. Bolmai-, of West 
 Chester, proprietor of the celebrated boarding school 
 Institution, which bears his name, and whose 
 herd of cows and heifers, 41 in number, all of his 
 own raising, and more or less mixed with Durham 
 blood, have been pronounced by good judges su- 
 perior as a whole to any dairy of the same number 
 in this section of country. 

The bull, "Henry Clay," was only two years old, 
 the 24th of December last, and weighed, the day the 
 daguerreotype was taken, 1697 lbs. He measures 
 from between his horns, to the perpendicular line of 
 the tail 10 feet 6 inches, and 10 feet round the girth 
 behind the shoulder. His sire was got by imported 
 Yorkshireman, bred by Thomas Bates, Kirkleaving- 
 ton, England, selected there and brought into this 
 county a few years since by Joseph Cope, dam Vir- 
 ginia, out of imported "Strawberry girl," by impor- 
 ted bull, "His Grace." "Henry Clay" was got by 
 P. Worth's bull, dam Red Rose, by young Prince of 
 Wales, Grand.dam Rose by Strode's bull. Grand dam 
 Muley, a half blood by a bull of John Hare Powell's. 
 Muley was a very superior cow of fine points, large 
 size, and gave 32 quarts of milk per day, and made 
 12 lbs. of butter per week. She was selected by A. 
 Bolmar, as the starting point in breeding, and the per- 
 fection his beautiful herd has been brought up to, 
 evinces his judgment in her selection and subsequent 
 crosses. Cherry No. 2 is also descended from her, 
 being i Durham, got by Traveler out of Rose. Cherry 
 is a splendid cow, and on the loin, back and hips, 
 and in her straightness behind, is seldom surpassed. 
 She is also very fine in the bone. 

Thisjfierd of cows and the complete cow-house & 
 fixtures, are models in their way, and well worthy of 
 attention. 

The cow stable is 104 feet long, ceiled and plaster- 
 ed, the floor all paved with brick. It ia 24 feet wide, 
 allowing a space for cows to stand, of 9 feet, with a 
 passage of 5 feet wide behind, feed-trough 2 feet, and 
 an entry 8 feet wide, fronting the stalls, and covered 
 with mortar floor. There is a gutter behind the 
 cows, graded so as to have a two feet fall in the 
 length of the stable, and a sink at the lower end to 
 oatch urine, &c., which is mixed with soil, and car- 
 ried out on the land. Nothing of this kind is allowed 
 to be wasted. Each cow gets about half bushel of 
 BUgar beets per day. As they get old so as to be un- 
 profitable for dairy purposes, they are fattened and 
 slaughtered for the use of the school, weighing gene- 

rally from 7 J to 800 lbs. One killed last fall, weigh- 
 ed 810 lbs. Their places are filled up by the young 
 heifers coming in. 

Water is thrown into the barn-yard by hydraulic 
 ram, affording a constant supply. 

The farm attached to the Institution, of over 100 
 acres, under the charge of his English farm manager, 
 John Lac, is a pattern of clean tillag3, neatness and 
 productiveness not often met with. The pastures are 
 well set with natural green grass, (poa pratensis,) 
 which is sustained by top-dressing. All the buildings 
 and fixtures for cooking and steaming food, piggery 
 &c., are of the most complete description. The lat- 
 ter, containing at this time 50 hogs, shall be describ- 
 ed in our next. They are of the Chester county 
 breed, and have been sold to various parts of the 
 Union. A daguerreotype of one of his superior boars 
 is in process of engraving, for next number of the 
 Journal.

Gueuon's Method of Choosing Milch Cows. 

We give below a report of a Committee of the Phil- 
 adelphia Agricultural Society, appointed to test the 
 correctness of Guenon's theory, and also the result 
 of the examination of some cows, made by John Nef- 
 flin,who appears to have verified and tested it by ma- 
 ny years of observation. He has compiled a pam- 
 phlet, on the subject from which these extracts are 
 taken, detailing the method of judging cows, with 
 seventy-eight illustrations. It is published by C. B. 
 Rogers, 29 Market st., Philad., and may be had of 
 him, and also at the Agricultural Warehouse in this 
 Borough; price 30 cts. Although this system was 
 much ridiculed at first, we consider its principles as 
 fully established by actual experiments. It has been 
 proven to be correct, by many of our best dairymen 
 in this section. Like many other things, however, it 
 requires to be studied carefully, not merely glanced 
 over in a cursory manner. The system has been dis- 
 credited in some places, by persons mastering a 
 few of the points, and undertaking to judge as if 
 they had mastered the ichole. It is not difficult to lcarn» 
 but nice details are to be understood, and examined; 
 and time, practice, and close observation, are necessa- 
 ry. With these, every farmer can easily comprehend 
 the system, and save himself a heavy loss, in rearing 
 and keeping poor milkers. Nefllin's work is substan- 
 tially the same as Guenon's, somewhat reduced in 
 size, and perhaps simplified, especially that part re- 
 lative to crossing in breeding. On this head we quote 
 the following, and recommend farmers to obtain both 
 works. 

REPORT 

Of the Committee appointed to investigate the vicrits 
 of Mr. John Nefflin's simplification of Guenon's me- 
 thod of testinf/ the value of milch cows. 

The Committee to whom was intrusted the exami- 
 nation of Guenon's system, very respectfully offer the 
 result of their proceedings.
