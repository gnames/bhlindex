BOOK NOTICES. 

"Soiii OF THE South." This is a periodical of over 
 thirty pages, published at Columbus, Georgia; well 
 sustained in its several departments, both editorially, 
 and by a large corps of able contributors. We de- 
 light to see agricultural papers so well stored with 
 practical articles, as the "Soil of the South," in pre- 
 ference to long communications, on mere abstract 
 subjects. This paper well deserves, and no doubt 
 receives, extensive patronage. 

"Michigan Farmer." This is just such a paper as 
 we should expect in such a quarter; spirited and over- 
 flowing with good things like its own exuberant soil. It 
 seems to have sprung at once into general popularity, 
 and has made sad havoc in Michigan among subscri- 
 bers to papers, published in New York, and other 
 States. We wish it the best success. 

"Western Plough Boy," published at FortWayne^ 
 Indiana, No. 1, of Volume 1, is before us, This is 
 a new paper called into being, by the wants of the 
 farmers of that section; and from the specimen be- 
 fore us, we think will be fully equal to its task. We 
 hope it will soon be "out of the woods" itself, with 
 a long list of subscribers, and also be the means of 
 assisting to make many a good clearing, and improv- 
 ed farm. 

"Journal of Agriculture," Boston, W. S. King, 
 Editor, Mapes & Bartlett, assistants. This is one of 
 our standard papers, most ably conducted, and which 
 always repays examination. Some of our exchang- 
 es do to glance over, this requires reading, and elicits 
 thought. The science as well as practice of agricul- 
 ture, is elucidated in its pages. One of its editors, at 
 least; if we are to judge, by some recent "passages" 
 (not of the most amicable nature with the Genessee 
 Farmer) writes with a steel pen. Unfortunately, it 
 seems to have been "Mauling" the wrong man. One 
 subject, however, does as well as another, to exercise 
 upon. Should the Farm Journal ever come under the 
 displeasure of the aforesaid steel pen, like the anec- 
 dote told of Captain Scott, we now offer to come down, 
 and surrender at discretion beforehand. Is this satis- 
 factory ? 

"Warder's Western Horticultural Review, "Cin- 
 cinnati, $3 per anum. This is the able representa- 
 tive of the West, as the Horticulturist is of the East. 
 It abounds and overflows with valuable matter, 
 and is well appreciated wherever it goes, and that 
 is pretty much all parts of the country. The 
 Editor is fortunate in his location, and has a clear 
 field before him, which he knows how to occupy. 
 We studied Virgil's Georgics in the same school, 
 some few years since, in Philadelphia. lie knew 
 how to make his mark, then, and his paper shows he 
 can do it yet. 

"Scientific American," a weekly Journal, pub- 
 lished in New York by Munn and Co.; price $2 per 

annum. Though not exactly an agricultural paper, 
 it is a standard work on scientific matters, is ably 
 supported, abounds in illustrations in each number, 
 and deserves the patronage of all business men, who 
 wish to be posted up with the improvements of the 
 day. 

"Ohio Farmer," published at Cleveland,, a week- 
 ly paper, $2 per year. Thomas Brown, Editor. This 
 is in its second volume, is of large newspaper Form, 
 combining news of the day, with a department appro- 
 priated exclusively to Agriculture and Horticulture. 
 It it well illustrated,and deserves to be well supported. 

"Horticulturist," published at Rochester, and 
 edited by Barry, price $2. This well known period- 
 ical is fulfilling the expectation we formed of what 
 it would be, under its present Editor. It fully main- 
 tains its high reputation, and no Fruit Grower, or 
 resident in the country Avho wishes to beautify and 
 adorn his home, with the attractions of choice trees 
 and shrubbery, and flowers, and pleasant walks, 
 should be without it. With its beautiful engraving,it 
 is an ornament for the centre table, or the book case. 

Saxton's Rural Hand-Books — Under this title, C. 
 M. Saxton, Agricultural book publisher, New York, 
 is issuing a series of cheap and useful little books 
 that are worthy of a place in every farmer's library. 
 We have before us, of these books already published: 

The American Kitchen Garden, containing prac- 
 tical directions for the cultivation of vegetables and 
 garden fruits, by T. G. Fessenden. 

The Cow, Dairy Husbandry and Breeding Cattle, 
 by M. M. Milburn, author of the prize essays of the 
 Royal Agricultural Society, England, edited by Am- 
 brose Stevens, editor of Youatt and Martin on cattle. 

Every Lady herown Flower Gardener — Address- 
 ed to the industrious and economical ; containing 
 simple and practical directions for cultivating plants 
 and flowers in the garden and in rooms. By Louisa 
 Johnson. Revised from the 14th London edition, and 
 adapted to the use of American ladies. This book 
 contains a deal of information that will be found ve- 
 ry useful to cultivators of flowers. The American 
 editor, however, committed an oversight in not re- 
 versing the "monthly notices" in chapter 10th. The 
 climate of England differs so materially from our 
 own, that "rules for planting" during the winter 
 months there will be utterly inapplicable here. The 
 price of these Hand-Books is uniformly 25 cents. 

The Milk Trade in New York and Vicinity, by 
 John Mullaly, with an introduction by R. T. Trail, 
 M. D. Fowlers & Wells, N. York. Price 25 cents. 

In this little volume we have an account of the sale 
 of pure and adulterated milk, the daily and yearly 
 consumption, the amount of property invested in the 
 business, injurious effects of impure milk on children 
 advice to country dairymen, &c. This work is worth 
 the cost, if for nothing else than to learn the process
