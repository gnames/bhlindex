POTTER COUNTY. 

April, 

Cowanesque, Pine Creek, the Oswego and other 
 branches of the AlloKheny. Of course the hills are 
 low, equally fertile with the valleys, and the whole 
 p;enerally well watered. As you approach the South 
 half, and continue through it, the hill; Imcomo high- 
 er and steeper, the indentations of the valleys more 
 decided, butexceedingly fertile, the tops of the ridges 
 es broad, and when you gain access by raising the 
 valleys of the smaller streams, you find handsome 
 rich lands, with hard timber, and well located for 
 large farms. Such is the character of what I have 
 seen, and I think a fair general representation of the 
 whole. The principal waters of tho southern por- 
 tions are the North Branch of the Sinnamahoning 
 and Kettle Creek, some of the head springs of the 
 former being only three or four miles from this place. 

Of the soil, I fear I may bo charged with praising 
 it too much, but permit me to say in advance, that 
 when I started for this county, my unfavorable im- 
 pressions were as strong as yours can be. I have 
 been here about 5 years, and my business has been 
 such as to give me a thorough knowledge of the set- 
 tled portions of the county. 

The business of this county is undoubtedly gi-ass. 
 That is, the making of butter and cheese, the rais- 
 ing of cattle and sheep, and the manufacture of wool 
 by the numerous water powers scattered over it. We 
 have no lime in this county ; (price at this place SI 
 per bushel ;) of course wheat is forbidden. But 
 grass and oats are luxuriant, and of other crops we 
 can raise what we need if we had good farmers ; but 
 a good farmer with us is like Randolph's black swan: 
 "rara avis in terra." The average yield of oats must 
 be over 50 bushels to the acre, and 100 bushels has 
 been gathered from new land ; that is, where the 
 trees have been cut, burnt, the seed sown among the 
 stumps, and scratched in with a harrow. I have 
 seen the tall Ohio corn, on the valley of Kettle Creek, 
 and one field was pointed out to me on the Sinnama- 
 honing, that had been BucoessfuUy planted with corn 
 for 13 successive years, without any manure, and the 
 yield of the last year was 25 or 30 bushels to the 
 acre. But in the Northern part the corn crop has 
 not been bo favorable in consequence of the late 
 frosts in the spring, which have been greatly ameli- 
 orated by the increase of clearings, and will doubt- 
 less be removed as the settlement progresses. I have 
 seen the scarlet radish as thick as my arm below the 
 elbow, and about a foot long ; onions that one would 
 fill a common sized saucer; parsneps and carrots to 
 match ; have eaten as good celery as I ever found in 
 the Philadelphia market, and a farmer below us on 
 the river, weighed the product of one of his pump- 
 kin vines, and reported seven of 32 lbs. each, and 
 2 of 25 lbs. each, making an aggregate of 274 lbs. 
 from a single vine, and I should not omit to say 
 that potatoes were raised in this place last summer, 
 weighing from 2 lbs. to 2| lbs. each. 

The soil is generally a rich black loam, with none 
 of the "hard-pan" that troubled our friends of Tioga 
 sorely; until a. farmer taught them that deep plough- 
 ing would cnaljle them to use it; and but little of the 
 chiy that makes the soil of a part of MuKean cold 
 and difficult to work. The timber generally upon 
 side-hills of western and northern exposure, is hem- 
 lock, but this is not ;ilways the case, nor is it alto- 
 gether confined to such localities. There is conside- 
 rable hemlock in the county, also large bodies of 
 pine which are being rapidly removed. 

Upon the tops of the ridges and in the valleys of 
 the north half, the timber is chiefly beech, maple, 
 birch, cherry, ash, linden, golden willow, and occa- 
 sionally chestnut oak and hickory. In the south 
 part add white walnut, cucumber, white wood, locust 
 and the chestnut. Oak and hickory become more 
 abundant, and near the south line I think an occa- 
 sional black walnut may be found. Of wild fruit 
 we have the plum, the thorn apple, almost equal to 
 the Siberian crab, blackberry, the white blackberry, 
 red and yellow raspberries, strawberry, gooseberry, 
 black currant, Mandrake or May apple. I had al- 
 most forgotten the whortleberry, and probably have 
 overlooked some familiar fruit. 

If a botanic physician should stray into this wil- 
 derness, he will find the gentian, sarsaparilla, liver- 
 wort, and a thousand other old acquaintances ; while 
 the white flowers of Shadberry and the plum, or la- 
 ter in the season the splendid azaleas and successions 
 of other handsome flowers. Or if you are in the 
 southern half of the county, the magnificent and 
 gorgeous flowers of the elk laurel please the eye 
 and relieve our woods from any appearance of aban- 
 donment. Our woods pasture is excellent and cer- 
 tain ; in fact, a large majority of the settlers allow 
 their cattle to depend entirely upon it, until driven 
 jn by the first snows of winter, without fear of their 
 losing flesli or being in bad condition for wintering. 

Our water is pure and climate healthy, the only 
 complaint we have to make is of an annual visit by 
 Jack Frost on the 12th June or thereabouts ; often 
 too slight to do any injury, but sometimes nipping 
 the joints of the clover or cutting the corn to the 
 ground. 

If there is a reduction of temperature in the south- 
 ern part of the State at that time, I never noticed it. 

But if you h.ave had the patience to wade through 
 this medley of facts, wedged in without forethought 
 or regularity, I must begin again. "To remove the 
 impression," you must pay us a visit; not as the 
 stranger comes, riding through on the State Road, 
 laid on the ivorst land in the county ; but visit our 
 farming districts in the north half (for about three- 
 fourths of our population is on that portion,) or visit 
 the valley of the Sinnamahoning, and the Norwegian 
 settlement in the south, and I think you will acknowl-
