GUANO AND D^yAR^ PEARS— POINTS OF CATTLE, io. 

April, 

lived trees ; but the other 1100 or 1200 were fine 
 trees, imported from France, and grown on the An- 
 gers quince, or some other hybrid variety, equally 
 adapted to this purpose, and their condition was in 
 striking contrast to that of the others. Thrifty, 
 healthy, of vigorous growth, and bearing all they 
 were able to do without injury. Having been care- 
 fully thinned out, the fruit was large and of fine 
 quality, and presented a rich treat to'the eye, as well 
 as promise of a richer one bye and bye to the pa- 
 late. 

Among them were 150 trees, (three rows,) of the 
 variety called Duchesse d'Angouleme, which had 
 been planted four years, and were bearing nearly 
 enough, and I am not sure but quite .enough, to pay 
 the cost of the trees, planting, and the land they 
 stood on, for he had bargained the whole crop to a 
 denier in Philadelphia at 31 per dozen, and would 
 undoubtedly realize 12^ cents each for them ; and 
 how niany pears, at that price, would it take to pay 
 50 or 75 cts. for a tree, and 25 more to plant, and 
 mulch, and tend it properly the first year, and also, 
 the 400th part of, say §200 for an acre of land, (they 
 were 8 feet apart, with ten feet between some rows,) 
 and for two or tlireo pounds of guano per annum, 
 for three years, at 2J cts. per lb ? I reckon a dozen 
 and a half would not be out of the way. I plucked 
 one or two of them, although not fully grown, to 
 bring home and compare with my own, which were 
 growing on trees only two years planted, but they 
 weighed 15J and 10 ounces, and mine only llf and 
 12 ounces. 

This, by the way, is a variety which always suc- 
 ceeds best on a warm, rich, light soil, and as mine 
 was heavy, and the trees only planted some sixteen 
 months, 1 did'nt feel exactly inclined to "give up 
 the ship" as yet. But to return to guano" which 
 came pretty near being lost scent of in running over 
 this orchard, there are two or three points of some 
 consequence to be determined by the cultivator be- 
 fore using it, and his success, presuming, of course, 
 that he buys a good article, will lie very much in 
 proportion to the correctness of his practice in regard 
 to them — the quantity, the time, and the mode of ap- 
 plication. The quantity should be enough — the time 
 long enough before the seed for it to impart to the 
 soil all its acrid and caustic properties, and become 
 thoroughly mild, and the mode would be to cover 
 deep in light soils, and less deep in proportion as 
 they are heavier. fci. L. G.

Points of Cattle. 

We copy the followingfromthe Journal of the New 
 York State Agricultural Society. If properly car- 
 ried out, and from the names of the Committee we 
 have no doubt it will be, we may expect what has 
 long been wanted, some reliable standard for judfin" 
 stock. There is a vast amount of ignorance among 
 farmers as to what the true and desirable points and 
 distiiKjuishing characteristics of the different breeds 
 of animals really are. Durhams, Devons, Ilorefords, 
 Bcrkshires, Southdowns, Bakewells, all have partic- 
 ular good qualities, peculiar to them as a breed. The 
 points of a Hereford differ much from those of a Dur- 
 ham. The value of eacJi breed relatively, may be a 
 matter of opinion and discussion, but the animals 
 themselves do not admit of comparison. As reason- 

able is it to place the English cart horse and the high 
 bred racer in the same class for competition. We 
 want to know the true points of each breed, not to 
 judge an Ayrshire by the standard of the Durham. 
 The Chairman of the Committee, F. Eotch, is one of 
 the most scientific and practical farmers and stock 
 breeders in the country, and we look for something 
 really valuable from his matured judgment and large 
 experience. He is also supported by the weight of 
 the most eminent breeders in New York, whose 
 names have long been before the public. We shall 
 lay the report before our readers at the earliest mo- 
 ment.

POINTS OF cattle. 

Francis Rotch, Esq., at the request of the Execu- 
 tive Committee, having prepared statements of the 
 Points of the improved breeds of animals, the same 
 were submitted to the Board by the Secretary. 

Mr. L. F. Allen moved that a committee be ap- 
 pointed to take in charge the Points of Cattle, pre- 
 pared by Francis Rotch, Esq., to consider the same 
 and report to the Executive Committee, and that 
 the Secretary supply each member with a copy of 
 the same, and that they bo requested to meet at their 
 earliest convenience.

licsolved, That the committee be requested to meet 
 at Albany, first Wednesday (4th) May, at the Agri- 
 cultural Rooms, at 10 A, M. ; and should any mem- 
 ber be unable to attend, that he forward to the Sec- 
 retary his views upon the Points submitted. 

Quinces Love Salt. — The quince tree seenjs to 
 have a constitutional fondness for salt. We have 
 never seen, says the Horticulturist, such superb spe- 
 cimens of this fruit, and such a general luxuriance 
 of the trees, as at Newport, Rhode Island, on the 
 sea coast. A gentleman who noticed the fact, seve- 
 ral years ago, told us lately that he had profited by 
 the hint, in giving to each of his trees atop dressing 
 of two quarts of coarse salt every spring. By scat- 
 tering the salt over the surface it dissolves slowly, 
 and does no harm whatever to the roots, but makes 
 both foliage and fruit much more healthy. 

Corn Bread. — Every body who has been at the 
 Mansion House, Buffalo, has learned the luxury 
 of the far-lamed corn bread there provided. The 
 clerk is often taxed to write directions for home man- 
 ufacture, and I thus procure a receipt for domestic 
 use, which I copy for you, so that those who wish, 
 may try a piece of bread from the mansion. It is as 
 follows; 

One quart of sour milk ; two table spoonfulls of 
 saleratus ; four oz. butter; three eggs; three table 
 spoonfulls of flour ; and corn meal sufficient to make 
 a stiff batter. — liural Neio Yorker.
