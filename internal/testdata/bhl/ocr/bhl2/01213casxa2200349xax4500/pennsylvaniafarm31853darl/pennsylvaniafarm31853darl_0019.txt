Peniisylvauia Seedling Fruits. 

Hector Apple. Fig 1. Large, oblong, somewhat 
 conical, mottled and striped with red, on a prominent 
 yellow ground, with numerous russet dots ; stem 
 slender, | of an inch long, very deeply inserted in a 
 slightly russetted cavity ; Vasin of moderate depth, 
 plaited ; calyx small, nearly closed ; flesh crisp ; tex- 
 ture fine; flavor pleasant; core small; will keep 
 through winter, till ]May. 

The above is a seedling found a few miles east of 
 West Chester, on a small property belonging to a 
 colored man. Hector Mullen. The tree is the only 
 one of the kind in the neighborhood, is about forty 
 years old, a good and regular bearer, and is resorted 
 to for some miles around, on account of the quality 
 of the fruit. We have no hesitation whatever in re- 
 commending the Hector apple as eminently well wor- 
 thy of cultivation in this section of country. Its 
 large size, fair and fine appearance, will always make 
 it saleable in market, and it is, besides, very plea- 
 sant and tender in taste, ranking at least, "very good." 

Each State has its varieties of fruit, specially 
 adapted to its own culture, some of which, at least, 
 do not answer so well in other soils and climates. 
 Fine seedlings, wherever originating, deseiwe to be 
 treasured up and cultivated in preference to new 
 and unknown varieties. 

Ott Pear. Fig. 2. This is a seedling from the 
 scckle, originating with Samuel Ott, Montgomery 
 county. Pa., and is a very valuable acquisition to our 
 list of caiiy pears, and one of the highest flavored 
 known ; approaching, in that respect, the character 
 of its parent. Col. Wilder, of Boston, than whom 

there is no higher authority, says : "The Ott is quite 
 first-rate, and in flavor, surpasses Madeline, Blood- 
 good and Bartlett." 

The original tree is about IG years old. Fruit 
 roundish, turbinate, skin greenish russet, with a mot- 
 tled rod cheek ; stem one and a quarter inches long ; 
 cavity small ; calyx large ; basin shallow ; core small; 
 flesh whitish yellow, melting, rich, perfumed, nrc- 
 matic ; ripe in August.
