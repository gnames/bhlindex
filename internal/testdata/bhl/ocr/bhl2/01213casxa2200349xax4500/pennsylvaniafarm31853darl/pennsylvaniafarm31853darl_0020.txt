April, 

Brandy»'in'e Peak, Fig. 3. Another very valu- 
 able seedling, originating a few miles from West 
 Chester, and ripening about the same time as the 
 preceding. Wo consider it equal to any other early 
 pear. It f/iows vigorously with us, both on pear and 
 quince stock, but has not been fruited on the latter, 
 so far as we know. The shoots are pale olive, rath- 
 er slender, but of upright and rapid growth, making

a handsome head. Leaves small, smooth, dark green, 
 serrate. The shape of fruit varies somewhat, but 
 generally resembles our engraving. Size medium ; 
 stem .J to J inch long, fleshy at base; skin smooth, 
 dull, yellowish green, marked with russet dots, ami 
 thickly russetted about the eye ; calyx open, set in a 
 smooth basin of moderate depth ; flesh white, very 
 melting, full of sweet, richand refreshing juice ; bears 
 abundantly. 

White Blackberrv.— This fruit is noticed in a 
 late number of Ilovey's Magazine, by Robert Man- 
 ning. He says the color is like that of a very ripe 
 Sweetwater grape ; shape like the bh.ck ; berries 
 slightly smaller ; flavor good. Its most remarkable 
 property is "its productiveness, in wliieh, (says II, 
 Manning) it far surpasses anything else of the kind 
 I have ever seen. The fruit is borne on long clus- 
 ters, two of which come from every bud : and on two 
 of these, fifty Ijerries have been counted as the pro- 
 duct of a single bud," In consequence of the poor 
 success which has attended all attempts to improve 
 the blackberry by seedlings, R, Manning recommends 
 that it be crossed with this pale variety. 

May's Victoria Currant. 

In the general pro- 
 gress of ioiprovement 
 in fruit culture, the cur- 
 rant has not been neg- 
 lectod, and several new 
 kinds are now cultivat- 
 ed, in place of the old 
 and inferior common red 
 and white. Our engra- 
 I'ing faithfully repre- 
 sents what wo have 
 fruited for some years, 
 and believe it to be the 
 best red, Mav's Victo- 
 ria, or HouGnroN Cas- 
 tle. It has been a- 
 warded the highest 
 prize at the London 
 Horticultural Society's 
 exhibition, both for size 
 and excellence. It was 
 a seedling accidentally 
 discovered by an ap- 
 prentice to a jobbing 
 gardener, who took care 
 of the gardens of Hough- 
 ton Castle. It is distin- 
 guished for its long 
 bunches, five or six in- 
 ches long, and very 
 large berries,which oft- 
 ten measure | of an inch 
 in diameter. The fla- 
 vor is excellent, and the 
 'ruit hangs on longer 
 t'lan any other variety. 
 J, Rivers says it is i- 
 dentical with 'Goliath' 
 a fine late variety. May's Victoria currant is much 
 Jn demand, and we think fully deserves all the praise 
 't has received. 

The Hen Fever. — This modern epidemic has shown 
 itself in our vicinity within a short time, and is char- 
 acterized by all the peculiarities which have marked 
 its ravages elsewhere. Some of our most valuable 
 citizens are now sufiering from its attacks, and there 
 is no little anxiety felt for their recovery. The morn- 
 ing slumbers of our neighbors are interrupted by the 
 sonorous and deep-toned notes of our Shanghae 
 Chanticleer, and various have been the inquiries as to 
 how he took "cold," and what we gave him for it. 
 "Chittagongs" and"Burma Poolers" are now as learn- 
 edly discussed as "Fancy Stocks" on change. 

One of our Fanciers complains that he is obliged to 
 use egg for coffee worth §6 per dozen. Twenty-five 
 dollars a pair is now no uncommon price for full blood 
 chickens, and plenty of buyers at that.^|| Indiana
