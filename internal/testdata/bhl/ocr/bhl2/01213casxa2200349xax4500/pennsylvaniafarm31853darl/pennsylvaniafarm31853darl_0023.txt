SAVIN'G MANURE— HORSE STABLE.

Making and Saving Manure. 
 A correspondent in tlie "Country Gentleman," under 
 the si2;nature of Composter, writes as follows: — • 

111 the first place, h^t mo say that my hogs are con- 
 fined to the pen, and a small yard in the rear of it, 
 nearly the whole year round, (my breeding sow.s on- 
 ly being allowed to range in winter.) My horse barn 
 stands adjoining the pen and on one side of the yard. 
 The manure from the horse stable is thrown directly 
 into the hog-yard. The hogs are alloweil the libortj' 
 of the yard, and so the horse and hog manure, and 
 the litter of both, g) together. The yard has been 
 cleared so often, that the earth has bciMi taken out 
 moi-e than a foot derp, and it will h(}!<l water like a 
 dish; and the water that falls into the yard, with the 
 urine of the animals, keep.s it well saturated most of 
 the time. Occasionally we scatter a few quarts of 
 corn over the yard, and the whole mass will soon be 
 turned up-side down by th; industrious pigs; and 
 in this way I can have it turned just when I wish. 

The whole is allowed to remain in the yard through 
 the summer, and in the fall I find it all rich and rot- 
 ten manure. The horse manure, which otherwise 
 heats and dries so much, and by evaporation loses half 
 its fertilizing properties, without a great deal of ex- 
 tr.a labor is bestowed upon it, is now thoroughly 
 mi.ted with the hog manure, and all improved there- 
 by. By a liberal supply of bedding to both horses 
 and hogs, one may increase this heap to several loads 
 for each animal kept. 

When straw is not at hand, a resort to the woods 
 for leaves as bedding, is an excellent substitute, and 
 they are certainly within the reach of all. I have 
 drawn several 'oads of them this fall, and find them 
 good for bedding. Any one who has not tried it, will 
 be surprised to find out how easily and quickly they 
 are obtained. 

Tlie Horse Stable. 

There is scarcely any class of people, who have 
 more professional pride than hostlers and the various 
 kinds of drivers, espoeially coachmen; and the per- 
 son who is not too proud to learn, can gather very 
 much practical information, as well as shrewd expe- 
 rience, from these rough specimens of humanity. The 
 e.-cperlenced hostler has a hundred little appliances 
 by which he succeeds in making his favorite appear 
 to advantage; and we have often been surprised at 
 what we should call the "good, hard, lujrse sense" that 
 seems to be held in common by groom and steed. 

Tills cl.ass of stable boys need no lessons from us. 
 We have taken up our pen to give a few hints to the 
 large number of those, who, being men of all work, 
 arc their own drivers and grooms, as we were for some 
 time; when we took especial pride in waiting upon 
 our goiid steed, before wo took thought for ourself. 

The Ilorso Stable should be so constructed that cur- 
 rents of air can be effectually shut off from coming 
 directly upon the horse, when desired. This is fre- 
 quently impossible in many stables that we have seen, 
 in consequence of open seams, through the siding 
 and floors of the stalls. A horse put in ^uch a stall, 
 coming warm and moist from the road, with the win- 
 ter winds Idowing upon his reeking hide, is very much 
 in danger of taking cohl, and laying the fmindation 
 of disease, aside from the immediate discomfort and 
 stiffening of his body. His back may be kept warm 
 by a blanket, but his legs will bo still sadly exposed, 
 and thus the elasticity of his travel impaired. 

The Stable Floor, for draft horses, we should al- 

ways prefer to have lowest in front,except fiu- the rea- 
 son, th.at such a stable cannot so readily be kept dry 
 and clean. AVe prefer it, because when standing up- 
 on such a floor the muscles which were most employ- 
 ed in draft, are temporarily relieved and rested, and 
 it will be perceived that wlien a roadster is in pastui-e, 
 and at libi-rty to choose his position, he will rest him- 
 self Vi'itli his fore feet lowest. But as it is highly ne- 
 eessarj' that the horse bo kept dry and clean, we 
 should allow a falling bagk of some two inches in ten 
 feet, in the planks of the floor. 

The Feeding Box for hay, should be a manger,com- 
 ingdown to witliin some eighteen inches of the floor, 
 leaving underneath, that space for the bedding, dur- 
 ing tlie day time. Of the general subject of horse 
 and stock feed, we shall speak at another time. The 
 stable should be so arrangeil with regard to /////(Y.that 
 a person on coming from without, would experience 
 no difficulty in discerning olijects within. We do not 
 approve of having a bright beam of light, let in im- 
 mediately upon the horses eyes; but should prefer a 
 well-diffused, sulxlued light. Ventihifion should be 
 well provided for, to dispose of the foul air bnd keep 
 up a proper circulation. 

Bedding should not be neglected, and on this sub- 
 ject we have bestowed some attention of late, especi- 
 ally in observing the results of an extieriment in the 
 extensive Livery and Sale Stables of Messrs. Blake 
 & Williams, of this city. The material used for this 
 purpose is saw-dust, and the results have been highly 
 satisfactory. Several bushels of dry saw-dust are 
 thrown into the stall, upon which the horse stands 
 during the night. In the morning it will be found 
 that about a bushel has to be removed — one half of 
 which is manure, and one half saw-dust, so well sat- 
 urated as to contain a large portion of ammonia, per- ' 
 forming the double office of absorbent and purifier; 
 thus the air of the stable is kept pure, and the ammo- 
 nia saved for the compost heap. This compost Mr. 
 Blake has applied to his stiff clay land, and reports 
 that it operates like yeast, making the ground very 
 ligiit and mellow. In the morning, that portion of the 
 bedding which remains dry is shoved up under the 
 manger, to serve for another night. 

Another advantage from this material for bedding 
 is that a horse which lies upon it is much easier clean- 
 ed off tlian one •which lies on straw; the saw-dust en- 
 tcrlng among the hair, brings awaj' the sc 'retions, 
 when the curry-comb and brush are applied, leaving 
 a l.iright lively coat. In warm weather it has another 
 great advantage, that of being much cooler than straw, 
 so that a tired and heated horse can sleep pleasantly, 
 without incitements to feverish restlessness. The es- 
 tablishment of steam mills in all paits of the country, 
 renders the material easy of access to almost every 
 neighborhood, and we doubt not, wdien its virtues are 
 better known, it will be generally applied to stable 
 use, as a means of comfort to the horse, and also of 
 turning an otherwise useless article into profitable 
 account. — Ohio Cuttivaior. 

Measi'hement of Hay iv Bulk. — Multiply the 
 length, breadth and height of the hay into e.ich oth- 
 er, and if the hay is somewhat settled, ten solid yards 
 will weigh a ton. Clover will take 11 to 12 yards 
 to a ton .

 bushels, of 70 pounds each, 9 1-0 American bushels,
