The folluwing very excellent remarks on breedinp-, 
 by L. C. Ball, of New York, are well worthy of at- 
 tention. The article appeared first in the Ohio Cul- 
 tivator. 

Mr. Ball says: — The experience of all herdsmen 
 and breeders, from the days of Jacob down to the 
 present time, has only tended to one result, narv-ely — 
 That like produces like. On this principle have all 
 the change:^ of form and habits which separate wild 
 from domesticated races, and which characterise the 
 numerous breeds and varieties oi improved animals 
 been made. 

So well understood is this principal, that no desired 
 property, wiiether of strength, speed, form, tempera- 
 ment, or disposition, is considered unattaiiialilc; and 
 no fiult or imperfection, but what may be eradicated, 
 and the intelligent breeder pursues his object with a 
 confidence of success, which the result fully justifies. 

"This power of man to affect useful alterations in 
 the animal creation," is shown by the fact that among 
 every species of domesticated animals, tiiere is a 
 great number of varieties, each characterised by per- 
 manent marks and qualities, of color or form, "or by 
 the size and shape of particular organs and parts. 
 These varieties, though differing widely in appear- 
 ance, qualities and habits, are all obtained from one 
 original stock, by the continued observance of this 
 one principle : Of breeding from those individuals 
 which possess the desired qualities in the highest de- 
 gree, and rejecting all those in which opposite tenden- 
 cies are perceptible. 

If animals with short limbs are desired, t .en all 
 those individuals of the species which have these 
 parts of more than medium length are rejected: and 
 from each successive generation, those' having the 
 shortest limbs are selected to be the parents of the 
 proposed new variety; and thus, in no very long pe- 
 riod the work is accomplished. 

bo far has this practice been continued in the case 
 of swine, that animals of that species have been 
 bred in which the limbs were not of sufficient length 
 to raise the body from the ground. 

The passion for small heads and fine limbs is at 
 this time so great, that animals are frequently pro- 
 duced in which the head is hardly large enough to 
 perform its appropriate functions, and the limbs are 
 unable to support for any long time, the weightof 
 the bod}'. 

But every rule has apparent exceptions — and none 
 more, or more fatal to the hopes of the breeder, if 
 blindly followed, than this, that like prodmes like. 
 For instance— an animal is obtained, which combines 
 to an emiment degree all the qualities which render 
 the species useful; and the owner indulges the ex- 
 pectation, that the offspring will possess all the gqod 
 qualities of the sire, and that henceforth his pastures 
 and stables will be tilled with the best and most per- 
 fect specimens of the breed. The result, however, 
 disappoints his expectations, and leads him to doubt 
 the corre tness of the rule he has so rigidly and per- 
 severingly followed; for not one of the progeny reach- 
 es that degree of perfection which marked the sire, 
 while more than half are below the standard of me- 
 diocrity. 

How are these facts 'o be reconciled, and the prin- 
 ciple so clearly understood as to be practically use- 
 ful? 

Philosophy and experience have demonstrated the 
 fact, that animals, from the highest to the lowest, y)('- 
 queiUlij resemble remote ancestors, and renewed forms 
 that existed lour/ before the birth of their own parents 

between toliom and themselves, no similarity is discov' 
 eralde. 

Who has not seen some human individual,8tanding 
 alone in the family, bearing no resemblance in fea- 
 ture or habits to parents, brothers or sisters; and who 
 was evidently sent back to gather up the acattered 
 threads of life's web among the graves of a preceding, 
 perhaps remote generation. 

The fact is very clear that animals transmit to 
 their offspring qualities which they do not themselves 
 exhibit, bat which they have nevertheless inherited, 
 and preserved in latent or rudimentary forms. How 
 else can the too common and melancholy fact be ex- 
 plained, that those hereditary diseases which afflict 
 one geneiation of the human family, pass harmlesslv 
 over the second, and break with desolating fury up- 
 on the third. 

The animal, whatever traits of excellence it may 
 possess, whose offspring exhibits defects of form and 
 constitution, has come from an inijmre stock, in ichich 
 the same defects loere prominent; and therefore the re- 
 sult, though seemingly contradictor}- and inexplicable, 
 is just what no intelligent observer of nature's laws 
 miglit confidently predict. 

If the breeder who looks with admiration upon the 
 good points and fine appearance of an animal, could 
 know the history of its ancestors for a dozen or twen- 
 ty generations, he could much better judge of its val- 
 ue, and the propriety of transferring it to his own 
 flocks or herds. 

Important improvements may doubtless be effected, 
 within short periods of time; but these improvements, 
 to become inherent, and constitute permanent and 
 unvarying types, must be continued in unbroken suc- 
 cession through many generations. 

Those animals, therefore, which have descended 
 from a superior race, through a long and unbroken 
 line of healthy ancestors, are the only reliable sour- 
 ces to which the breeder can resort, for preserving 
 useful qualities already obtained, or for reaching to 
 a higher degree of excellence. 

Fresh Imported Stock. 

The following list of recent importations of fine 
 stock, by Lewis G. Morris, Mount Fordham, West 
 Chester county New York, is taken from the Boston 
 Cultivator. Such enterprise is worthy of all praise, 
 and whether profitable or otherwise to himself, is a 
 large contribution to the public good, the value of 
 which is not easily estimated.
