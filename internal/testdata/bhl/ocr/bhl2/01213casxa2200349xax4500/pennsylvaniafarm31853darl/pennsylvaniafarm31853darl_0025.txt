of J. A. Tlioraas, Esq., South Molton, North Devon- 

"Pi-inoess" (380.) Bred by and purchased of James 
 Quartly, Esq., South Moltuu, North Devon. 

The figures refer to the numbers of the animals 
 as registered in the Devon Herd Book. None of the 
 Short-horns except ''Marquis of Carralias" are yet 
 registered in the Herd-Booli, their owners liaving 
 omitted to send their pedigrees to Mr. Stratford, the 
 edit(n-, previous to Mr. Morris' purchase ; but they 
 will be inserted in the next volume. Both Short- 
 horns and Dcvons are very fine specimens ot their 
 breeds. The Devon cow, "Birthday," received seve- 
 ral prizes in England, and is one ot the most beauti- 
 ful animals we have ever seen. Her breeder, Mr. 
 Thomas, was a very successful competitor of the late 
 show of the Smithtield Club. The (ither cow and the 
 bull are also very fine ; the latter especially very 
 complete in form, and of good size and firm constitu- 
 tion. 

SwivE. — Mr. Morris also brought out an addition 
 to his stock of Essex, Suffolk and Berkshire swine. 
 The Essex were bred by and purchased of W. Fish- 
 er Hobbs, Esq., Bosted Lodge, near Colchester. 
 The boar is of the best of this gentleman's noted 
 stock, and is altogether a most perfect specimen of 
 his species. The Suffolk boar, an excellent animal, 
 was bred by and purchased of Lord Wenlock, York- 
 shire. The Berkshires were purchased of Mr. AVil- 
 bon, bailifl'to Sir R. G. Throckmorton, Berkshire. 

Sheep. — Mr. Morris brought out for himself and 
 Mr. Beear, two Sduth-Down rams and six ewes, bred 
 by and p'irchased of the celebrated breeder, Mr. J. 
 Webb, Babraham, near Cambridge. He had before, 
 quite a flock of South-Downs, as purchased ot Mr. 
 AVebb. 

In addition to the above stock, Mr. Morris selected 
 and brought out for Mr. Corning of Albany, three 
 Ilerefords ; a bull and two heiffers. 

The I.oudou Poultry Show. 

From the 11th to the loth of January, there was a 
 grand poultry show in London, at which were exhi- 
 bited no loss than 615 pens of different species of 
 fowls, each containing from two to four animals - 
 besides eleven pens of geese, thirty-three of ducks, 
 ten of turkeys, two hundred and forty-nine of pig- 
 eons, and forty-eight of rabbits. Of tlie fowls there 
 were two hundred and furty-nine pens of the Cochin 
 China breed, sixty-three Bantams, seventy Dorkings, 
 besides Spanish, Malay, Hamburg, Poland, &c. On 
 the first day there were some hundreds of visiters, 
 at an admission fee of five shillings, on the second 
 day over five thousand at a shilling, and <m the third 
 day a much larger number at the same price. Very- 
 high prices were put upon some of the pons. At the 
 auction sale on the last day the highest price paid 
 was $'240, for a Cochin China cock aud pullet. The 
 general selling prices varied from fifty to two pounds 
 for each pen. 

The London Correspondent of the National Intel- 
 ligencer says there were three geese which weighed 
 together 48 pounds. There were gigantic pigeons 
 from Inilia with magnifieient plumes ; beautiful 
 Australian pigeons of most delicate plumage ; tur- 
 keys of prodigious size ; and four Cochin China fowls, 
 fur which £03 (or §315) was required. There was 
 a single hen for which thirty guineas ($150) was re- 
 fused. 

At the sale which took place at the elose of the 
 exhibition, 110 birds of the Cochin China breed, 
 the majority of them being young ones of three or 
 four months ago, realized £3Q9. The highest price 

obtained for a single bird was £21. For the eggs, 
 5s. to 10s. each was readily obtained. One pair of 
 Cochin China fowls fetched" £49.7. 

A number of agriculturists attended the sale who 
 appeared to receive an impression that the breeding 
 of poultry was becoming more profitable than the 
 breeding of cattle. The times has the following util- , 
 itarian notions upon the subject: 

"A fowl, after all, is not materially the more pre- 
 cious for being "gold" or "silver pencilled," "white 
 crested" or "double-comlied," though "double-breast- 
 ed," i. procurable, might be an eligible quality to 
 introduce. One variety we see styled "dumpies" or 
 "bakies," attracted great admiration for the extraor- 
 dinary shortness of their legs ;" but we scarcely un- 
 derstand the ailvantage of this feature, unless, indeed, 
 they will go into a smaller saucepan. The end, in 
 short, of all such exhibitions as that now open, j 
 should be the improvement, not of private "collec- 
 tions," but of the public stock, and the breed deserv-- ! 
 ing the price is not that with the largest comb or the 
 rarest plumage, but with the best promise of general 
 usefulness. If, twelve months hence, eggs should 
 prove better, chickens cheaper, and all poultry more 
 abundant than now, we shall bo the first to acknowl- 
 edge the benefits of the Baker street show ; but, if 
 the result is confined to the monstrosities of private 
 "collections," there will be but little credit gained 
 by the notoriety of this week's display. 

Bots iu Horses. 

The following on the subject of Bots in Horses, 
 gives some information, new and interesting to most 
 people. We copy from the "Journal of Agriculture:'' 

Many years ago, assisted by Dr. Roe, of White 
 Plains, N. Y., we made examination of a horse that 
 appeared to have died with the bots. We found the 
 cuticular coat of the stomach almost entirely covered 
 with them. They were upon the top, and upon the 
 bottom, and upon both sides. Tliey worked side qy 
 side, like lazy street sweepers; and were in no wise 
 hurried or interrupted in thdr operations by our ob- 
 servation. Some were lapped over others, as sucking 
 pigs who get the upper row of teats are wont to feed. 
 They ate systematically, and as I remarked in the 
 paper quoted below, "they swept clean" as they pro- 
 gressed, as a silk-worm cleans a mulberry leaf The 
 stomach was alive with these sluggish but persevering 
 pests. But that the horse died of the bote, although 
 there is reason so to think, we dare not untertake to 
 say; for the weight of authority is against us, never- 
 theless, xoe think he did. * * * * 

We "exhibited" to our subjects a tempting dose of 
 sweetened milk; in fact we submerged a portion of 
 the stomach in milk and^molasses, but the adult bot 
 preferred the tripe, whatever the baby bot might do 
 with the drink. AVe tried an application of sulphur- 
 ic acid, (oil of vitriol,) to their backs, without percep- 
 tible effect. We steeped the portion of the stomach 
 in the acid without at all interrupting their meal. 
 This is accounted for by the fact, that the bots are 
 coated with mucus, which defends them against the 
 acid. Finally, we tried a powerful burning glass; 
 and either worried out by the protracted fight, or un- 
 equal to a contest with the sun, they gave up the 
 ghost. But this remedy would be somewhat difiiciilt 
 of administration, with a living horse, aud therefore 
 we do not "patent" it. 

After the bots are full grown and fairly establish- 
 ed, and in operation, they are safe from most applica- 
 tions; for this reason, that as many of them must be
