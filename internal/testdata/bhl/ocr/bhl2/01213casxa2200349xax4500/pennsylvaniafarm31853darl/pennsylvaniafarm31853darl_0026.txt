BJTS IN IIOKSES— TRAINING STEERS— POLISHING PLOWS, &c.

engaged on the upper portion of tlie stomach, medi- 
 cine cannot reach them, unless tlu stomach is kept 
 constantly full of the medical agent, and besides, 
 their mouths are so deeply buried in the business bo- 
 fore them, that they ivill not quit it for the most se- 
 ductive drug. 

In view of the whole matter, we come to those con- 
 clusions. So long as there exists a sufficiency of mu- 
 cus in the stomach, the bots will not attack the cuti- 
 cular coat, and will at the proper time be disengaged, 
 passed out of the stomach with the ohylo, and evac- 
 uated with the dung. 

In the commencement of the attack they may be 
 expelled by the remedy recommended, (swetened 
 milk,) or more easily by green and succulent food. 
 So long .as they confine themselves to the mucus, their 
 presence is not dangerous to the life or health of the 
 animal, though they cannot be claimed to be posi- 
 tively essential to his comfort and well being. The 
 act of eating the cuticular coat is not of itself pain- 
 ful to the horse, for the coat is insensible ; but, the 
 cuticle removed leaves the stumach at le.ast liable to 
 in9amation. At this stage we do not doubt that fa- 
 tal eft'ccts may follow. 

On the whole, it appears to us as idle to say that 
 horses do not die of the bots; as to deny that chil- 
 dred die of measles or hooping cough, because the 
 cases are rare, where riyhttii and siasoiiahly treated, 
 they do not recover. 

Traluiug Steers. 

The following mode of transforming the wild and 
 unmanageable steer, into the gentle and well-trained 
 ox, is both reasonable and instructive. We extract 
 from the "Country Gentleman." 

The first point is to make them tame and gentle. 
 This may be accomplished by feeding them out of the 
 hand, and carding them daily. They should be ap- 
 proached gently, without yelling at them until they 
 are frightened out of their wits. After having redu- 
 ced them to a state of perfect docility, a good yoke 
 should be procured, suitable to their size and strength. 
 A small pen is necessary to put on the yoke; ap- 
 proach gently with the yoke, patting and speaking 
 gently to them until you have the yoke on the oti' 
 steer; t.^.en let an assistant drive the other under the 
 yoke. Their tails should then be securely fastened, 
 to prevent their getting the habit of turning the yoke. 
 They shou4d be yoked in the morning, and unyoked 
 at night— in this manner, for several days, until they 
 become accustomed to the yoke. 

The first thing to teach them is, to stop at the word 
 of command. This may be done by striking them 
 across the face; the blows should be repeated until 
 thoy stop, and then discon^nued; by striking them 
 for every non-observance of the word of command, 
 they will soon learn that by stopping they will avoid 
 It, and will act accordingly. They may be taught 
 then to "gee" and "haw," by gently pushing tliem 
 around. Hacking may be taught by beginning ^J\ih 
 an empty cart on a side-hill; then on, a level; then 
 with an increasing load.until thoy will back nearly the 
 same load thoy will draw. They should never be 
 put to a load that they cannot readily draw, or 
 drilled by prolonged exercise beyond the period when 
 It becomes irksome. Long and repeated yelling, or 
 the use of the lash, is both cruel and useless. Clear 
 and intelligible, yet low and gentle words, are all that 
 is necessary to guide a well-trained ox. The ox un- 
 derstands a moderate tone more perfectly than a bois- 
 terous one, as all sounds become indistinct as thev 

increase. A command should never be given unless 
 enforced. Many bear with bad tricks for a long time, 
 without even an expression intelligible to them — but 
 when patience departs, a thorough stcjrm of blows is 
 poured upon them. This is the way to ruin every 
 beast; a single blow should be given for each offence. 

Polishjug Plows. 

To all those who are expecting to go through with 
 the (lid operation of polishing a new plow, by scrap- 
 ing it the following spring, I would propose the fol- 
 ing cheap and effectual remedy. — 

Go to any druggist shop and procure 4 oz. of sul- 
 phuric acid, or oil of vitriol, which will cost from 
 five to ten cents, according to the conscience of the 
 druggist. Take a stick and wind upon the end of it 
 a wollen rag, and tie it on witli a coarse strong twine, 
 making a swab; set your plow where it will be expos- 
 ed to the sun, if convenient; then pour the sulphuric 
 acid into an earthen bowl, and dilute it with an 
 equal quantity of rain or river water. Take the swab 
 and thorouglily moisten every part of the plow that 
 requires polishing; work fast, lest the acid e.at up 
 your swab before you have gone over the surface, 
 and be careful not to get any on your clothes or skin, 
 for it is very corrosive. Let the plow stand about 
 24 hours, then -scrape off the scales which will have 
 arisen all over the surface wet with the acid; hitch 
 on the team and go ahead.and in from fifteen minutes 
 to one hour, the plow will be smooth and bright. 

The rationale is this. The outer coating of the 
 castings is composed of a mixture of sand and iron, 
 more or less porous, thus admitting the free passage 
 of the acid, which decomposes the iron, changing it 
 to an oxide, and as soon as the solid iron is reached, 
 the action of the acid terminates, or is very slight, 
 owing to a want of surface upon which to act. 

Original Communications. 

For the Fiirm Journal. 
 Planting Trees. 

Much has been written about the best time and 
 mode of planting treps, some recommending the au- 
 tumn, others the spring, some "advising deep plant- 
 ing and others objecting to it as improper, and scarce- 
 ly agreeing in any essential particular respecting 
 the time or the mode. Believing that I have learned 
 something from the mistakes I have made, I propose 
 to give, through the Journal, some opinions on these 
 subjects. Of those woody plants that are quite har- 
 dy in this climate, and grow freely from cuttings, it 
 is found that many of them succeed best if the cut- 
 ting is cut smooth at the base, at or about the time 
 that the autumn growth has entirely ceased, and in- 
 serted in light soil in which the superabundant mois- 
 ture will freely drain off; under these circumstances, 
 a callus is generally formed during the winter, from 
 which roots are emitted early in the growing season. 
 But if the cutting is put in a he.avy clay soil, reten- 
 tive of moisture, there will be no callus formed, 
 and the base of the cutting is frequently so much 
 injured by the superabund.ant moisture during the 
 winter, that no growth will take place ; and if the 
 base of the cutting is rough and uneven or ragged.
