should be permitted to braneli nearer to the ground 
 than is allowable where it is intended to continue 
 the orchard in cultivation. The heat of our sum- 
 mers acts injuriously on the bodies of apple trees 
 when the tops are not sufficiently large to ward off 
 the rays of the sun during the hottest part of the 
 day ; and, therefore, other circumstances being equal, 
 a cool northern or northeastern exposure is moresult- 
 able- for apple orchards than a warm southern ov 
 southwestern one.

 Planting Corn. 

To THE Editors of the F.\rm Journal : — 

As the cultivation of Indian corn is attended with 
 much labor, I ask the liberty of presenting a device 
 by which the tedious process of marking off the ground 
 with intersecting furrows may be avoided, and the 
 ground left less liable to wash by heavy rains prior 
 to cultivation. The contrivance for this purpose, I 
 call a spacing frame. Sec above engraving. It con- 
 sists of a square frame of a suitable size, with four pro- 
 jecting fingers. The .sides and interior of the frame 
 are so constructed as to indicate the points fir drop- 
 ping hills of corn. The design of the fingers is to con- 
 nect with the adjoining rows of dropped corn. The 
 frame may be made of light lath, well stifiened at the 
 corners, and large enough each way to extend the 
 breadth of four hills of corn. At equal spaces across 
 the interior of the frame should be inserted two pie- 
 ces of lath, and the whole so squared and spaced 
 off as to indicate the points for dropping sixteen 
 hills of corn. At the dropping points, holes may 
 be made and funnels of leather or other suitable 
 material inserted therein. Near the corners, han- 

dles may be placed for greater convenience in mov- 
 ing the frame forward. The frame may be made 
 lighter and cheaper by omitting the interior lath and 
 funnels, and placing elastic strings, at right angles, 
 in their stead. Indeed, all the funnels may be dis- 
 pensed with by substituting marks on the sides of 
 the frame, to show where corn should be dropped 
 On the other hand, the funnels may be made so as to 
 contiin the seed with sliding valves connected by 
 wire, to enable a person to drop four hills at a time. 
 But I believe the more simple plans to be better. 
 Simple devices are more within the reach of every 
 one, and less liable to get out of order. 

Directions for Using. — The ground being plowed 
 and well harrowed in the usual form, a straight line 
 may be drawn the breadth of the field, sufficiently 
 near the fence by moans of a piece of twine and a 
 few stakes, to guide the instrument the first time 
 across the field, after wluch it will be guided by the 
 dropped corn, one row being left uncovered fjr that 
 purpose. Two persons, appointed to drop, each pro- 
 vided with a basket of corn, can place the frame near 
 the end of the string with the two p.arallel fingers in 
 contact with the line ; then drop the hills as spaced 
 by the frame. One dropper then takes his station iu 
 the foremost corner of the frame, next to the line, 
 and the other behind the opposite corner, and carry- 
 ing the frame forward until the hindmost dropper 
 can place the finger next him in cont.act with the 
 dropped corn, and the foremost then place his, in con- 
 tact witli the line: drop aiain, and so on, across the 
 field. On returning across the field, (if the frame is 
 made correct,) the corresponding fingers will keep in 
 concert with the dropped corn. Should the rows be- 
 come crooked by carelessness or the unevenness of 
 the ground, it will be necessary to straighten afresh, 
 as the instrument will not work well only in a straight 
 line. 

I anticipate an objection against this mode of 
 planting on the surface of the gr jund : that the corn 
 will not grow so well. 

The fairest experiments having been my guide, I 
 could not perceive the smallest difference in favor of 
 furrows ; but between a poor, shallow soil and a deep, 
 rich soil, the difference is strikingly obvious. 

Spaijing frames on the above principle may be 
 constructed for dropping other seed besides corn. 
 Small ones can be made for horticultural purposes, 
 and they can be so varied in structure as to enable a 
 pei'son to drop seed in continuous parallel rows. Last 
 spring \^as my first opportunity for trj'ing my device. 
 I planted abont ten acres, dropping it in the above 
 way; and althougli part of the field was hilly and 
 uneven, it was done to my entire satisfaction, thus 
 saving the labor of marking wit:) the plough. 

The easiest plan of outwitting the insects, which I 
 have experienced, is to plant plenty of seed ; I find it 
 better to pluck up than replant.
