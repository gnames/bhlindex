The writer's motive in presenting the above simple 
 innovation is a desire to benefit others. It is referred 
 entirely to your discretion. Should you deem it pro- 
 per you can "place it on the track," or you may, 
 without offence, slide it off the "embankment."

Fall Ploughing. 

Mr. Editor : 

The subject on which I shall make 
 a few remarks, is one which I consider of importance 
 to every farmer, and one that I have never seen dis- 
 cussed in the Farm Journal, though other subjects 
 of less importance has been commented on in its col- 
 umns. I mean the proper time for ploughing corn 
 ground. 

I h.ave been a practical farmer for some time, and 
 a constant reader of agricultural works, and yet can 
 I never adopt the popular plan of ploughing ray corn 
 ground in the fall. I have frequently conversed with 
 the advocates of fall ploughing, and the principal 
 reasons urged are: a preventive against the cut-worm, 
 advance with their spring work, and that theirteams 
 are in a better condition to do work in the fall than 
 in the spring. The first of these reasons may, in a 
 measure, be an inducement to some for fall plouch- 
 ing; but to me it is not, for I never have had much 
 trouble with the grub. My mode of management is 
 to plant deep with the hoe, and not too early in the 
 season. The advantage I find in planting deep is, 
 that if the worm cut off the stalk, it still grows on 
 without injury, and if planted shallow, the worm 
 takes it so close to the grain that it must die. As 
 to the two other reasons, I think they should have 
 little weight, for in my opinion, teams well wintered, 
 are better able to perform hard work in the spring 
 than they are in the fall, after a whole summerV hard 
 work. 

My own experience too, has t.aught me that ground 
 ploughed in the fall, and subjected to the action of 
 the frosts, heavy rains and snows of our winter, will 
 become hard and unmanageable the following sprin" 
 and then will require as much labor to get it proper- 
 ly pulverized as another ploughing ; and then my 
 impression is, it will not retain moisture as well as 
 spring ploughing. 

Another reason for spring plowing is that it can 
 be better done than in the (M, the ground being al- 
 ways in better order for ploughing. 

I have seen plowing done in the fall that I would 
 not have thanked a man to have done for nothing, on 
 my farm, in consequence of the ground being too 
 hard. 

To prove my position, I find in referring to agricul- 
 tural works, thiit where there has been an extraordi- 
 nary yield, it always has been the product of spring 
 plowing. In looking over the February number of 

the F.arm Journal I find, for raising the premium 
 crop of 100 bushels per acre, Mr. Walker ploughed 
 in the beginnir g of May, and planted the last of May. 
 In the same number of the Journal I find, for the 
 next premium crop, Mr. McCrea has given his time 
 for plowing .as some time in March, and that very 
 little after culture was necessary to keep down the 
 weeds. 

In the January number of the Prario Farmer of 
 1847, I find an article signed A. L., which speaks 
 thus of fall ploughing for corn : 

"In the place where I live, fall ploughing for corn, 
 after repeated trials, has mostly been abandoned on 
 old land, especially early fall ploughing. I have 
 succeeded best with the corn crop — taking into ac- 
 count labor and yield— where the planting followed 
 the ploughing as soon as possible." 

I shall here say that I fully concur with A. L. in 
 saying that taking in account labor and yield he is in 
 favor of spring ploughing. I h.ave always found the 
 yield better in spring plowing, and labor much less , 
 in keeping weeds and grass down. Yours, &c.

The township of Birminghiim, Chester county, 
 Pa., is situated five miles south of West Chester, the 
 county seat, 13 miles north of Wilmington, Delaware, 
 and 25 miles west of Philadelphia: these are the 
 markets which receive its products. It contains two 
 grist and saw mills, with machinery attached for 
 grinding plaster and cob meal, one shingle machine, 
 one store, one blacksmith and two wheelwright 
 shops, one tavern, which, and the store, I regret to 
 say, are licensed to sell spirituous liquors, by inhab- 
 itants of the township, the demoralizing effects of 
 which are plainly evident in the vicinity ; two places 
 of worship, one school .averaging thirty scholars, one 
 Library of 2,000 volumes, numerous quarries of ex- 
 cellent building stone, and one of limestone on its 
 border. Population about 300. 

It comprises about 3,000 acres, skirted on the west 
 by the Brandywine creek, (bordered bj' extensive 
 meadows,) and is intersected throughout by small 
 streams of the purest spring water, affording, in con- 
 nection with the spontaneous growth of the natural 
 grasses, "green grass," ^oa pralensis ; "blue grass," 
 poa compressa; white clover, irifoUtim rtpcns and - 
 others ; facilities for the method of farming practic- 
 ed ; grazing accompanied with grain raising, not ex- 
 celled in many otlier situiitions, and which, though 
 less profitable than othcr.s, is less laborious, both in 
 thc2 family a id field. 

The surface is mostly rolling; soil a deep sandy 
 loam, inclining to clay in the flats, and containing a
