Shanghai Fowls. 

Messrs. Editors : — 

Will not your racy correspon- 
 dent inform us how his remarkable "celestials" were 
 kept? What number of the sixty or seventy com- 
 mon fowls produced the four dozen eggs in January? 
 What were their ages and how kept,aside from rang- 
 ing the barn and yard? Did no single individual 
 equal the Yellow Shanghai ? 
 Such isolated experiments, which it requires]no clair- 
 voyance to pronounce upon, are objectionable. Noth- 
 ing hat fotvl disease could induce J. B. G. to put them 
 forth. It was unnecessarj' for him to add that he 
 "did not take the disease in the ordinary way," be- 
 cause his symptoms indicate a violence of attack 
 very extraordinary, and which homeopathic doses of 
 my stuff would not eradicate. 

Permit me too to give experiments. Last Au. 
 tumn a pair were purchased for the very mod- 
 erate sum of two dollars, from a person whose 
 opinion on all matters pertaining to improved stock 
 \s ex cailicdra, a,n<\. whoso favorable opinion of this 
 variety, induced him to perseverance for their in- 
 troduction which was really heroic, From his re- 
 presentations corroborated by the books, my anxiety 
 was aroused almost to cliicken fever. lie could 
 supply but a single pen, consequently applica- 
 tion was made to a friend for "a few more of the 
 same sort." Four more were procured for which he 
 charged me — nothing. You will perceive that all 
 "ranks of the fancy" have not an eye single to the 
 "almighty dollar," and cannot be accused of bait- 
 ing. 

All ray eommon cocks were cut off i. e. their heads 
 and with these six new "cracks," the race ot improve- 
 ment commenced. Now for the result, which like 
 that of J. B. G. is admitted to be isolated and prob- 
 ably premature, These three hens, procured in No- 
 vember, have had the same treatment, Avith the ex- 
 ception of an occasional tit bit of meat and roast po- 
 tatoes, with thirty of the common stock. L'p to this 
 time, they have produced twenty-five eggs, that is 
 one egg in four days, or equal to an average of one 
 per hen in twelve days. 

The thirty have produced since the first of Janua- 
 ry, seven hundred and fifty eggs, that is ten per day, 
 Dr one for every three hens. No account was kept 
 in December, and if that month be added, wo have an 
 nverage of seven per day, nearly one per every four 
 hens, far above the average of the improved "cracks." 
 But I am well convinced from appearance of c^s, 
 age of chickens, &c., that the seven hundred and 
 fifty eggs were produced by half of the comnwn hens, 
 thereby doubling the average. A single individual 
 produced fifteen eggs in eighteen days. 

A friend on whose statements reliance can confi- 
 lently be placed, informed me this day that from 

his pen of Shanghais he roared last season only two, 
 quite late it is true, but from the four up to this date 
 THREE eggs have been obtained. 

So long, Messrs. Elitors, as you do not become too 
 deeply indoctrinated in the mysteries of celestial 
 chickendom, and are willing to publish, you shall 
 have both sides of the question. 

It was not the intention to ask the Rev. Mr. B., nor 
 yet J. B. O. what was the remarkably good "ariety 
 tliat was prominent enough — but the unprulific, that 
 ihcij might be avoided by farmers, &c.

 Brewers and Barlej-. 

Mr. Editor: — 

I wonder if our Pennsylvania farm- 
 ers have forgotten the circular of the Philadelphia 
 Brewers, issued last Fall, inviting us to go largely 
 into the cultivation of Barley, and thereby put into 
 our pockets the half mill. on of dollars annually sent 
 to New York, to furnish these said brewers with their 
 supplies. I had made up my mind to sow barley 
 this Spring, when one of my neighbors gave me an 
 account of his experience with the brewers last Win- 
 ter, in the way of selling them his crop. He inform- 
 ed me that he had as fine a sample of Barley as could 
 be grown in Now Yerk or elsewhere,— it was plump, 
 bright and sound, weighing forty-nine pounds to the 
 bushel. He took it to Philadelphia and offered it 
 to some half a dozen of the brewing fraternity at 
 seventy-five cents, which has been the average price 
 in New York for several years past. But none of 
 them would touch it,— some declined buying at any 
 price, and one or two had the magnanimity to offer 
 sixty cents! Completely out of patience with the 
 whole craft,my neighbor left his sample with a friend 
 and went home, well satisfied that the famous cir- 
 cular of these brewers was a regular piece of "gam- 
 mon." By accident Mr. lludman, of the "Eao-le 
 Bre>very," in Green street, happened to meet with 
 the sample, and at once offered seventy-five cents f(,r 
 the crop; and moreover, agreed to take next season 
 all the Pennsylvania barley of equal quality that 
 may be brought to him, at the same price. So much 
 for the great circular that was issuoi with so much 
 parade last Fall. Had it not been for the liberality 
 of Mr. Rudman, my neighbor would have had his 
 barley on his hand? yet. 

I have troubled you Mr. Editor with these hasty 
 remarks just to let the farmers know where to take 
 their barley when they seek a market for it in Phil- 
 adelphia. And if they should want to take home 
 with them a cask of ale that would make even an 
 ultra teetotalar's mouth water, they would find the 
 very article at Mr. U.'s establishment.
