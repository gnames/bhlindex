Summer, and will not go dry, and within six H'eelis 
 of calving, will make four pounds of butter. The 
 second one (last season) with her first calf, made ten 
 and a half pounds of butter the week she was tried: 
 and at the sale was within .1 month or six weeks of 
 calving, and was making four pounds a week then. 
 Our reason for noticing the above cows is not so 
 much to bring them before the public, but to prove 
 the science of Guenon. Both these cows having the 
 "Milk Mirror" nearly or quite perfect. I will also 
 add, they were both York State cow.s, bought out of 
 droves when heifers, for prices ranging from !?20 to 
 S30. The .advantage of the science is tliis: It mat- 
 ters not what country or what breed a cow comes 
 from, if she have the "Mirror" perfect, she will not 
 deceive the owners expectations; and also, it is not 
 worth the trouble and expense of importing stock 
 for milking purposes, when we have them at home, 
 and can raise them to perfection by following the ad- 
 vice of Guenon and Nefflin. We will close our re- 
 marks by asking a question. Will not the above 
 prices pay for breeding perfect animals for milking 
 purposes? A.

Perhaps at this peculiar period of 
 hen roost celebrity, while the attention of farmers 
 and house-holders is so urgently directed toward 
 the improvement of their chickens, a woman may 
 be permitted to give the result of her own experi- 
 ence, for the benefit of those unfortunate mortals 
 who are unable to obtain the far-famed Shangai, or 
 other imported crowers and cacklers. 

I h.ave been nominal mistress to flocks of chickens 
 during at least twenty summers, but for a great part 
 of the time I left the management of the poultry yard 
 to whoever was pleased to attend to it. And it was 
 managed after this manner. The eggs were collect- 
 ed for eating, as long as the cool spring weather con- 
 tinued, and no hens permitted to set until May or 
 June. Then the earliest chickens were eaten in the 
 fall, and the late half grown ones, kept to perpetu- 
 ate the stock. It is a popular belief that late chick- 
 ens lay best in the spring. Wstjl, our chickens de- 
 teriorated sensibly. They grew to be no larger than 
 pheasants, and many of the young chicks were crip- 
 ples, and unable to walk. We uere always chang- 
 ing with our neighbors, not only crowers, but hens 
 and settings of eggs; all to no purpose. Finally I 
 begun to philosophize upon the subject. I always 
 preserve the earliest setting of peas, beans, and oth- 
 er garden vegetables, for seed, and so improve my 
 varieties; and I now resolved to try the same with my 
 fowls. I observed that ha'f grown chickens in the 
 fall were only half grown chickens the next spring. 
 So I commenced by "setting" my hens as early as 
 they showed an inclination to hatch, and then selec- 

ting the largest and finest of tlie chickens, for my 
 next summer's stock. (I also keep one crower for 
 every five hens, and have no lame chicks.) Now I 
 have as large, fine, hardy, and prolific fowls, as any 
 reasonable woman can desire to possess; without the 
 extra care and nursing, which is required by the im- 
 ported breeds.

Jlay I be permitted also to ofller my observation 
 upon the causes of the potato disease. You mu.st 
 observe that I have had opportunity of analyzing the 
 quality of this famous esculent. My Mother (bless- 
 ings on her) always used potatoe starch in her f^imi- 
 ly, and this she manufactured herself. I was her 
 eldest daughter, and my fingers knew the evils of 
 contact with the grater, when they were scarcely 
 larger than a rye straw, as I assisted at tlie annual 
 starch making. Of course I follow my mother's ex- 
 ample, and make every Autumn as much potatoe 
 starch as I need for family purposes. 

In the fall before the potatoe disease broke out 
 in this vicinity, I was surprised at the small quanti- 
 ty of starch obtained by my usual process, from the 
 usual measure of potatoes. I thought it must be left 
 in the dregs, and accordingly washed and strained 
 them a second time, but obtained nothing. So it has 
 been ever since. Now, I presume that this paucity 
 of farina, which leaves the potatoe watery, and soft, 
 is the true reason of the decay or rot; and that any 
 process of cultivating or manuring, which wouild so 
 regulate the chemical action and aSinities, as to give 
 the potatoe its reqiusite quantity of farinaceous mat- 
 ter, would regenerate this valuable article of food. 

My opinion is not a mere vagary, for we always 
 devote a part of the garden to potatoes, for early use, 
 so that I have an opportunitji to watch them, and to 
 try and observe every suggested experiment, for pre- 
 venting or checking the disease, as veil as of observ" 
 ing the various indications of its existence and pro 
 gress. And I am well convinced that many of the 
 appearances which have been deemed causes of the 
 disease, arc merely effects, son»e of them sectional 
 and some accidental. 

Will scientific farmers please give my opinion a 
 "trial by jury," before they condemn it?

In July, 1850, I sowed a field of 2| acres with 
 buckwheat. Of this, two acres was sown with gu- 
 ano, about 90 lbs. to the acre ; the remaining \ of an 
 acre had no manure of any kind. We harvested and 
 thrashed in October, and from the two acres sowed 
 with guano we had 51 bushels of good plump grain; 
 and from the J of an acre not gu.inood, we had L'.i
