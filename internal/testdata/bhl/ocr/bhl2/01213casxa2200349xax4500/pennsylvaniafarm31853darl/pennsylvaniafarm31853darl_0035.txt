Tribute to George Beuick, 

I do not propose to give an extended biography of 
 the individual whose name heads this article, nor to 
 narrate many of the ineidents of his life. My only 
 object is to speak of one or two of his prominent 
 acts, which will suffice to show that a plain, unassu- 
 ming, unambitious farmer, may confer great benefit 
 on his country. There is nothing grandiloquent in 
 a farmer's life. On the contrary, how calm the in- 
 ception, how gradual the expansion of the cultiva- 
 tor's designs ! For him there is no sudden realiza- 
 tion of hopes. In silent thoughtfulness he prepares 
 the ground — in his mind, deep ploughing and careful 
 harrowing produce fruitfulness. From the budding 
 to the ripening of his mental growth, his mind goes 
 straight onward to its conclusion. But on account 
 ot this slowness of development, this leaning on and 
 learning fr ira Nature, he has sometimes been called 
 a dull, plodding drudge. 

To the young husbandman just setting out in life, 
 I might say, behold in George Renick. your model. 
 Learn from him that a fruitful intellect may dwell 
 with modesty and merit. And if you would bo riv- 
 eted in attachment to the noblest and most ancient of 
 avocations, be assured from his history, that content 
 and plenty will ever be the reward of him Avho assid- 
 uously cultivates both the soil and the mind. Such 
 a farmer is above and beyond the feverish itchings 
 for fame and notoriety. 

In the winter of 1804 — 5, before turnpikes and 
 canals afforded an outlet for the vast grain surplus 
 of the rich bottoms and plains of the West, the pros- 
 pects of the farmer were gloomy and unpromising in 
 the extreme. Hogs roamed at large, and fattened 
 without the care or solicitude of their owners, on the 
 superabundant waste of the forest. The small villa- 
 ges of the tliinly settled country, could scarcely con- 
 sume the beef which one good farm was able to sup- 
 ply. And if every log cabin in the country had been 
 a distillery, and every man, woman and child had 
 drank their own home made whiskey like mother's 
 milk, they could not have consumed the products of 
 their groaning corn fields. The nominal value of 
 that bane or blessing of man, as it happened to lie 
 in a liquid or solid state, varied from ten to six cents 
 per bushel. At thisjuncture J\Ir. Renick determined 
 to make an experiment, which his friend- and rela- 
 tions deemed little better than burning his corn in 
 the field. 

Unmoved, however, by their doubts, he fed a lot of 
 cattle, and started them on an untried road, to a mar- 
 ket beyond the mountains. How long it would take, 
 or how they were to be fed on the way, or in what 
 condition they would reach their destination, no man 
 knew. As the first fifty cattle ever fed on the Scio- 
 ta, or in the great valley of the Mississippi, were 
 turned out of the pasture, one of his commisserating 
 friends shook his head, and said, "There goes poor 
 George's forlorn hope.'' Forlorn hope it was, but a 
 glorious victory perched upon its banner. The un- 
 dertaking seemed desperate, but was eminently suc- 
 cessful. To make his triumph the more comolete, 
 his trial was the more severe. When they reached 
 Baltimore, ho wis no longer surrounded by friends 
 who spoke their fears in whispers. To the inexperi- 
 enced eye, the cattle were sore, hollow and poor. 

No one would buy. The butchers scouted his offers 
 to sell, even at reduced prices. 

With that patient and quiet courage which h.as 
 ever marked the man, Mr. Renick ordered two or 
 three of the most indifferent of the cattle to be slaugh- 
 tered, at his own expense, and the butcher was di- 
 rected to give the meat to his customers, if he could 
 not sell it at his stall. A fact was made known, and 
 a valuable lesson was taught to the butcher and 
 consumer. That meat was "the best for its looks 
 they ever saw." The lot was sold; another and 
 another followed. Now, all is plain and easy. "Any 
 one could have done that." So thought and said 
 thousands who have followed Columbus to the New- 
 World. Nor was there any mystery in making the 
 egg stand up, after the great discoverer had showed 
 them how to crush the end. The "forlorn hope" was 
 the pioneer band to hundreds of thousands of fat 
 cattle, which have gone from the Great West to the 
 markets of Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York and 
 Boston, and to be shipped from their ports to the far 
 distant isles of the ocean. It has been computed, 
 that not less than twenty thousand fat cattle, per an- 
 num, cross the Soiota "river, between the town of 
 Piketon and the mouth of Darby. North and south 
 of those points, the numbers, eastward bound, have 
 not been included in the reckoning. Has not Jlr. 
 Renick opened a mine of wealth to the feeders ami 
 farmers of the whole western world, and at the same 
 time secured to our eastern brethren a constant sup- 
 ply of a great necessary of life ? 

'This was not the only useful and striking example 
 of that amiable and virtuous citizen. About thirty 
 years after he had shown his brother farmers how to 
 get their corn to market, after he had practically de- 
 monstrated that thousands of cattle, and countless 
 thousands of hogs, could be fattened and driven 
 where there was the greatest demand for them, he 
 presented to the agricultural society of this county 
 a certificate, signed by gentlemen of the highest 
 character for veracity, tliat he had produced 154} 
 bushels of corn on an acre oi ground. I know that 
 this achievment has been since equalled and surpass- 
 ed, but I mention it here, because it was the first 
 time, I believe, that the well attested proof of so 
 large a yield had ever Ijcen made public, and because 
 this wonderful product was upon the very ground ou 
 which, so long a time previous, he had fed his "for- 
 lorn hope." 

The lion. 'ohnL. Taylor states, in his communi- 
 cation to the Plough, the Loom and the Anvil, that 
 on the 2nd November, 1833, Gov. Allen Trimble, 
 George Renick, and General Duncan McArthur, 
 with others, formed the "Ohio Company for Import- 
 ing English Cattle." Now, sir, believing that none 
 of the gentlemen engaged in that noble enterprise, 
 will be lessened in pulilic esteem by my doing so, I 
 will state the facts and circumstances which called 
 that company into being. On that day the gentle- 
 men just mentioned had been examining a lot of 
 Kentucky Durhams. descendants of the imp<irtation 
 of 1817, when Mr. Renick asked his companions why 
 they could not form a company, and send on to Eng- 
 land and bring out a lot of improved Durhams for 
 themselves ? n(^ said, truly. "We know notliing of 
 the purity of this stock ; the pedigrees may or may 
 not be made up for the occasion." The suggestiou 
 was approved, and that very day the articles of asso- 
 ciation, forming the first Old" Ininortatinu Company 
 were signed. What has been the result ? Ask all 
 who have attended to our Valley or State lairs. Not 
 only has there been no deterioration, but in the opin- 
 ion' of one of the best judges in America, Dr. Arthur
