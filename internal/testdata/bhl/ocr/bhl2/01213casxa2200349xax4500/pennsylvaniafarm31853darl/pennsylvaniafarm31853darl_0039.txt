Chester County Hog. 
 The above Engraving is from a daguerreotype 
 likeness of a fine boar of the Chester county breed, 
 bred and owned by A. Bolmar, West Chester. Ow- 
 ing to the position he stood in at the moment, his 
 back appears somewhat hollow, more than it really 
 is. In other respects the likeness is good. He is a 
 large animal, and would weigh four or five hundred, 
 and measures from his nose to the root of the tail, 
 five feet six inches, and five feet one inch around the 
 girth. His descendants have gone to various parts of 
 the Union, and have helped to increase the reputation 
 of Chester county hogs for large size, combined with 
 very neat form, comparatively small ofi'al, great 
 depth and length of carcass, and easy fattening. In 
 these particulars, this breed is unsurpassed. A con. 
 sideralde number have been slaughtered the past 
 winter, weigliing over five hundred. They are em- 
 phatically the farmers hog, yielding a large amount 
 of lard. Some of our farmers who manufacture sau- 
 sage on a large scale, find there is rather much of 
 this for their purposes, and are enquiring in some 
 places for Berkshires, in whom there is a greater 
 preponderance of lean meat. 

The specimen before us is represented frothing at 
 the mouth, his way of showing a little honest indig- 
 nation at the process of the age, which requires him 
 to stand up for the dagucrreotypist to copy, a process 
 his ancestors were not subjected to. 

As the Chester county breed of hogs is now so 
 widely known and esteemed, we have endeavored to 

ascertain their origin, and by whom introduced into 
 our sountry. It appears from what we can learn, 
 that the credit is due to Capt. James Jefferis, who 
 occupied a farm on the forks of Brnndywine, a few 
 miles from West Chester, after retiring from the sea. 
 His ship used to trade between Liverpool and Wil- 
 mington, Delaware, and in one of his voyages, he 
 procured a couple of hogs from Bedfordshire, with 
 the view of introducing them into this county.- ~ 
 This was about thirty-five years ago. They were 
 then called the Bedford breed, and have been 
 recognized by Englishmen, who were familiar with 
 them about that time in Bedfordshire. At present 
 the breed of hogs there is not so distinct, but has 
 been crossed more or less with others. From this 
 origin they have been generally distributed in our 
 own and surrounding counties, and are now known 
 as the Chester County Breed. They are pure whitÂ«. 
 Those who wish to see them in perfection, can do 
 so by visiting the piggery of A. Bolmar, which now 
 contains about sixty, and shows what can be done 
 with them in comfortable quarters and systematic 
 management. The piggery is one hundred and four 
 feet long, with a steaming house at one end for boil- 
 ing and steaming food, and divided by board divi- 
 sions into seven different compartments. These are 
 all paved with brick, and regularly cleaned, having 
 suitable drainage. 

Improved breeds of swine are as important to the 
 interests of the farmer as improved breeds of other 
 stock, the object being in both to make a given
