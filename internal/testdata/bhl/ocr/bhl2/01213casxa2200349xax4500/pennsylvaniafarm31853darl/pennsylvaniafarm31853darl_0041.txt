Flower Garden. — Continue the directions given 
 last month, all such work as pruning Roses, and 
 flowering Shrubs, Iloejsuckles and Creepers of all 
 kinds, laying sod, planting box edging, transplanting 
 herbaceous plants, manuring and digging the flower 
 beds, should bo concluded this month. Continue to 
 plant Evergreens, and all kinds of shruhberi/. In the 
 rage which exists for ever blooming plants, some of 
 the Brightest Gems of the Flower Garden seems to 
 be thrown completely in the shade, we would gladly 
 lend a hand to brinj; them into the sunshine, (espec- 
 ially 'Wiegilia Rosea, Forsythia Veredlssimia, Spirea, 
 Revesii do Prunifolia,) for this reason, that they 
 bloom before the earliest rose. If the weather is 
 suitable, flower seeds may be sown on a warm bor- 
 der the latter part of the month. A good method to 
 plant them, is to break the soil very fine (if the soil 
 is of a da)j nature, mix a little sand to loosen it.othei'- 
 wise the seeds will not be able to germinate,) then 
 take a six inch flower pot inverted, and press the soil, 
 sow the seed in the ring made by the flower pot, if 
 the seed is very fine, merely pressing it with the flow- 
 er pot will be found sufficient; other kinds should 
 have a little soil strewed lightly over them. A good 
 lesson is to be learned on this subject if we observe 
 the successful germination of seeds dropped from the 
 parent plant. Tulips Hyacinth, Narcissus, &c., may 
 be planted the early part of this month. Plants that 
 has been wintered in cellers, should be brought out 
 the latter pai-t of the month; but previous to that 
 they should have fresh air admitted to them as freely 
 as possible.
