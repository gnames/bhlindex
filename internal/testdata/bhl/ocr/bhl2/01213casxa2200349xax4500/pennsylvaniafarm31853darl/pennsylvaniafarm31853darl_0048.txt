POINTS OF CATTLE. 

[Mat, 

"bright," as an evidence of good disposition — "clear," 
 as a guarantee of the animal's health; whereas a 
 dull, sluggish eye belongs to a slow feeder, and a 
 ■wild, restless eye betrays an unquiet, fitful temper 
 —2. 

The IIoRN's^ight in substance and in coloi', and 
 symmetrically set on the head; the ear somewhat 
 large, thin, and with considerable action — 1. 

The Neck— rather short than long, tapering to 
 the head; clean in the throat, and full at its base, 
 thus covering and filling out the points of the shoul- 
 ders — 2. 

The Chest — hi-oad from point to point of the shoul- 
 ders; deep from the anterior dorsal-vertebra to the 
 floor of the sternum, and both round and full just 
 back of the elbows; sometimes designated by the 
 phrase, "thick through the heart." These are un- 
 questionably the most important points in every ani- 
 mal, as constitution must depend on their perfect 
 developement, and the .ample room thus affordeil for 
 the free action of the heart and lungs— -8. 

The Brisket, however deep or projecting, must 
 not be counfoundcd with capacitij of chest; for though 
 a very attractive and selling point, it, in reality, adds 
 nothing to the space within, however it may increase 
 the girth without. It is in fact nothing more or less 
 than M muscular adipose substance, attached to the 
 anterior portion of the sternum, or breast-bone, and 
 thence extending itself back. This form, however, 
 of the brisket, indicates a disposition to lay on fat 
 generally throughout the frame, and in this point of 
 view is valuable — 4. 

The Shoulder, where weight, as in the Short- 
 horn, is the object, should be somewhat upright and 
 of good width at the points, with the blade-bone just 
 sufiiciently curved to blend its upper portion smooth- 
 ly with the crops — 3. 

The Crots must be full and level with the shoul- 
 ders and ba k; and is, perhaps, one of- the most diffi- 
 cult points to breed right in the Short horn— 4. 

The Back, Loin, and Hips should be broad and 
 •wide, firmin'T a straight and even line from the neck 
 to the Fe'ting''on of the tail, the hips or bucks round 
 and wrll covered — G. 

Tae UiMPslald up high, with plenty of flesh on 
 their pxtrometies — 3. 

The Pelvis should be large, indicated by the 
 width of liips, as already mentioned, and the breadth 
 of the twist -2. 

The Twist should be so well filled out in its 
 "seam" as to form nearly an even and wide plane, 
 between the thighs— 1. 

The QiARTERS— long, straight, and well developed 

downwards — 3. , . , , 

The Carcass- round; the nbs nearly circular, and 
 extending well back— 1. 

The Flanks— deep, wide, and full in proportion 
 to condition — 1. 

The Leg— short, straight, and standing square 
 with the body— -2. 

The Plates of the belly strong, and thus preserv- 
 ing nearly a straight under line— 1. 

The Tail flat and broad at its root, but fine in 

its cord, and placed Ugh up, and on a level with 

The Carriage of an animal gives style and beau- 
 ty; the walk should be square, and the step quick; 

the head up— 1. , , ... ^, c ,■ 

Quality— On this the thriftiness, the feeding prop- 
 erties and the value of the animal depends ; and 
 upon the touch of this quality rests, in a good meas- 
 ure, the grazier's and the butcher's judgment. If 
 the "touch" be good, some deficiency of form may 

be excused ; but if it be hard and stiff, nothing can 
 compensate for so unpromising a feature. In rais- 
 ing the skin from the body, between the thumb and 
 finger, it should have a soft, flexible and substantial 
 feci; and when beneath the out-spread hand, it should 
 move easily with it, and under it, as though resting 
 on a soft, elastic, cellular substance; which, however, 
 becomes firmer as the animal "ripens" A thin pa-> 
 pery skin is objectionable, more especially in a cold 
 climate — 8. 

The Hair should be thick, short and mossy in 
 winter; fine, soft and glossy in summer — 1. 

The Udder — pliable and thin in its texture, reach- 
 ing well forward, roomy behind, and the teats stan- 
 ding wide apart, and of convenient size — 1. 

POINTS OF THE SHORT-HORN BULL. 

As regards the male animal, I have only to remark, 
 that the points desirable in the female are generally 
 so in the male, but must, of course, be attended by 
 that masculine character which is inseparable from a 
 strong, vigorous constitution. Even a certain de- 
 gree of coarseness is admissible, but then it must be 
 so exclusively of a masculine description as never to 
 be discovered in the females of his get. 

In contradistinction to the cows, the head of the 
 bull, may be shorter, the frontal-bone broader, and 
 the occipital flat and stronger, that it may receive 
 and sustain the horn — and this latter maj' be excus- 
 ed if a little heavy at the base, so its upward form; 
 its quality and color be right. Neither is the loose- 
 ness of the skin, attached to, and depending from the 
 under jaw, to be deemed other than a feature of the 
 sex, provided it is not extended beyond the bone, but 
 leaves the gullet and throat clean and free from dew- 
 lap. 

The upper portion of the'neck should be full and 
 muscular, for it is an indication of strength, power 
 and constitution. The spine should be strong, the 
 bones of the loin long and broad, and the whole mus- 
 cular system wide and thoroughly developed over the 
 entire frame. 

NORTH DEVONS— THE COW. 

Puritv of Blood, as trbced back satisfactorily to 
 importations of both dam and sire, from known 
 English breeders, or as found in the lately establish- 
 ed Herd-Book, for North Devons — 40. 

The Head should be small, lean and bony, the 
 forehead wide, flat, or from a fulness of the frontal 
 bone over the eyes, somewhat dishing ; the face 
 straight; the muzzle fine; the nostrils open; the lips 
 thin, and rather flat — 2. 

The Nose of a light delicate color, it being a test 
 of pure blood — 2. . 

The Eye should be bright, prominent, and clear, 
 but mild and gentle in its expression, as indicative of 
 that spirited, but tractable disposition so necessary 
 to cattle that must bear the yoke; a beautiful orange- 
 colored ring should invariably surround the eye — 1. 

The Ear — thin; of a rich orange color within, of 
 medium size, with a quick and ready movement, ex- 
 pressive of attention — 1. 

The Horns — light, tapering, of a waxy color tow- 
 ards the extremity, and gaily, as well as symmetri- 
 cally placed on the head ; the occipital bone narrow, 
 thus bringing the base of tlie horns nearer together. 
 — 1. ■ ... 

The Neck of medium length, somewhat light in 
 substance, very clean, and pretty well set up on the 
 shoulder — 1. 

The Chest — deep and round, carrying its fullness
