The Milk Trade of New York and Vicinity. 

The following chapter from Dr. Trail's work on the 
 milk trade of New York will be I'ound well worth a 
 5)erusal. In his introduction the Dr. makes the start- 
 ling aneuncement, that eight or nine thousand chil- 
 ■dren die annually in the city of New York from dis- 
 •eases caused by the use of impure milk. Incredible 
 as this statement may seem, at first thought, it be- 
 •comes too painfully apparent, in glancing at the array 
 of facts set forth in this little book. "In hundreds 
 ■of cases," says the Doctor, "the symptoms of pois- 
 oning by swill milk are so obvious, that physicians at 
 once irepute the disease to this cause, and prohibit 
 •the use of milk entirely. And to this abstinence 
 from bad milk are the patients mainly indebted for 
 their recovery. In my own practice I have every 
 year grown more suspicious of distillery milk, when- 
 ■ever I have seen a child presenting a sickly appear- 
 ance, loose, flabby flesh, weak joints, capricious ap- 
 petite, &c. * * * This assemblage of symptoms 
 is often attributed to worms ; but my experience has 
 fully satisfied me that slop milk is much more fre- 
 quently the cause. I have known these symptoms 
 ■defy all medication until the milk part of the diet 
 was entirely abandoned." 

We have alre.idy stated that the swill milk daily 
 consumed in this city, AVilliamsburg. Brooklyn, and 
 Jersey City equalled about two thirds the quantity of 
 the pure country article, that is, near one hundred 
 and eighty thousand quarts. This, however, it must 
 be understood, is not produced in New York alone, 
 for there are extensive cow stables in the neighbor- 
 ing cities, from which the city receives large supplies 
 by steamboats. Every morning about three o'clock, 
 the boats upon the different ferries are crowded with 
 milk wagons coming from the "sister cities" to dis- 
 tribute the poison among our people. Some of these 
 vehicles are labeled "Pure Country Milk," "West- 
 chester County Milk," "Orange County Milk," etc., 
 so that those who receive it are under the impres- 
 sion that it is the pure article with which they are 
 supplied. This system of deception, although fr;- 
 quently exposed through the press, is still in fatally 
 successful operation. It is true, that some of tlie 
 milkmen driving these wagons do supply their cus- 
 tomers with excellent milk, but the number is very 
 small when compared with those who do not. There 
 was one man engaged Ih the business who put up a 
 notice that he sold "only pure milk and water," and 
 so implicit was the confidence placed in his word 
 that his business was very extensive. 

We have computed, as accurately as possible, the 
 number of cows on this island which are fed upon 
 grain, swill, and other slops, and find them amount- 
 ing to about four thousand. Of these, more than 
 one-half are kept in stables connected with distiller- 
 ies, and tlie remainder are to be found iu various 
 sections of the city where stable rent is cheap. Some 
 are as far as three and lour miles beyciml the city 
 limits, and to these the swill is carried in b^irrels 
 upon carts. The most extensive distillery in the city 
 is that owned by a Mr. Johnson, at the loot of Si.'c- 
 tcenth street, on the North River. It pro.luces 
 more swill thaa any other in New York, and it is 
 Said even more than any other in the United States. 
 Whether this is correct or not, it is not necessary to 
 enquire, but of one thing wc are certain, that it 

is one of the greatest nuisances which has ever been 
 tolerated by our authorities. 

We do not refer to the manufacture of spirits, for 
 with that we have nothing to do in this connection, 
 we simply allude to the production of swill for the 
 use of cattle, and the evils inflicted ou the con m ini- 
 ty thereby. Thousands of barrels of this h. r -ible 
 stuff are consumed weekly by the miserable-looking 
 and diseased animals confined in the stables to which 
 we have referred. This, of course, is a source of 
 considerable revenue to the owner of the distillery, 
 whose interest it is to support the sale of the swill 
 milk, and to discountenance that of the pure article 
 from the country. He makes thousands of dollars 
 yearly by this branch of business alone. The price 
 paid for the board' of each cow is six cents per day, 
 or about twenty dollars a year, and, estimating the 
 number of cows kept in the Sixteenth street stables 
 at two thousand, the yearly income will be_ found to 
 amount to forty thousand dollars. This is an im- 
 mense sum of money, and it would require more 
 than ordinary strength of principle to resign a bus- 
 iness so lucrative, from motives of public philan- 
 thropy. 

The sale of swill, as wo have stated, is not confin- 
 ed to the stable in the immediate vicinity of the dis- 
 tillery, but extends even to a distance of three or 
 for miles from the city. Some of our readers, 
 doubtless, have seen the vehicles in which it is car- 
 ried — heavy lumbering carts, with one or two barrels 
 besmeared with swill and dirt, and emitting a most 
 offensive odor. They are drawn each by <me old, 
 broken-down, spavined horse, and occasionally by a 
 team of oxen. Crowds of these carts during swill 
 days may be seen around the distilleries, vraiting 
 their turn, and so large is the quantity sold in this 
 way, that a whole day is often consumed in its dis- 
 tribution. The price per barrel is about a shilling, 
 and many thousand barrels are disposed of weekly 
 for the use of cows and pigs. 

As the only object of the men who keep these 
 cows is, to turn them to the most profitable account, 
 the expense is curtailed in every possible way. They 
 are allowed no straw for bedding, but a very small 
 quantity of dry feed, consisting of hay and grain, is 
 given tiiem, and the fl(ior on which they are compell- 
 ed to lie, is generally covered with ordure. 

As comparatively little is known of the internal 
 anangenipnts and general management of these es- 
 tablishments, we will give a description of the one 
 to which we have referred as the largest in the 
 city. This stable is situated at the foot of Sixteenth 
 street, between the Tnth Avenue and the North 
 River. The buildings and ground are owned by 
 Mr. Johnson, the proprietor of the distillery adjoin- 
 ing, from which the cattle are supplied with the swill 
 or slop. There are, properly speaking, three stables 
 running parallel with each other, from the avenue 
 to the river. They were all originally constructed of 
 wo.id, but it was thought prudei.t, in cousequenee of 
 a fire which broke out in ime of them about four 
 years ago, and which destroyed a considerable a- 
 mount of property, to rebuild some of them with 
 brick. Their length is from five hundred to seven 
 hundred feet, and each one is made Jo contain be- 
 tween six and seven hundred cows. Their appear- 
 ance outside is any thing but inviting, and the stench 
 can sometimes be perceived at a distance of a mile; 
 but the exterior, disgusting as it is, conveys no ade- 
 quate conception of the interior. 

The cows arc ranged in consecutive rows, of four- 
 teen or fifteen to a row, and are separated by wooden 
 partitions which do not extend further than the ani-
