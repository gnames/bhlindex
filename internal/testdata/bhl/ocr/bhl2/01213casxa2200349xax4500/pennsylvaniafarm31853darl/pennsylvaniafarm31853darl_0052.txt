mals' shoulders. At the head of each row is the 
 trough which contains the swill, and to one of the 
 boards which forms the frame-work immediately a- 
 bove this, the cows are secured by a rope fastened 
 round their necks. The unfortunate animals are so 
 placed as to be almost constantly over this trou;;h, 
 except when lying down; and even that position, in- 
 stead of affording them rest, only subjects them to a 
 new torture, for the ground floor of these stables is 
 saturated usually with animal filth. It is almost 
 needless to state that stables kept in this condition 
 cannot be wholesome, and that the atmosphere which 
 pervades them would, of itself, be sufficient to taint 
 the milk, and render it unfit for use. The ceiling is 
 from seven to eight feet high, and generally at one 
 end of the stalls is a small room where the cans, and 
 other utensils required in the business, are kept. 

This room serves also the purposes of an office, and 
 although it is something cleaner than the adjoining 
 stalls, it is not free from the stench. As ground 
 rent in this locality is very high, the economy of 
 space is a great desideratum. Thus the same build- 
 ing in which the cows are kept is also used as a 
 stable for the horses employed on the milk routes. 
 They are, however, more carefully tended, get better 
 food, and their stables are kept cleaner. The cows 
 are occasionally fed with hay and grain, but the lat- 
 ter is always mixed with the slops in their trough, 
 and the former is most sparingly distributed. When 
 the swill is first served it is often scalding hot, and a 
 new cow requires some days before she can drink it in 
 that condition. It instinctively shrinks from the 
 trough when the disgusting liquid is poured in, but 
 in the_ course of a week or two it becomes accustom- 
 ed to it, and, finally, drinks it with an evident rel- 
 iih. The appearance of the animal after a few 
 weeks' feeding upon this stuff is most disgusting; the 
 mouth and nostrils are all besmeared, the eyes as- 
 sume a leaden expression, indicative of that stupidi- 
 ty which is generally the consequence of intemper- 
 ance. The swill is a strong stimulant, and its effect 
 upon the constitution and health of the animal, is 
 something similar to alcoholic drinks upon the hu- 
 man system. Of this swill, each cow drinks about 
 twenty-five or thirty gallons per day, so that the total 
 consumption in the stables is about fifty or sixty 
 thousand gallons, The quantity of milk given upon 
 this food, varies from five to twenty-five quarts daily, 
 that is, in every twenty-four liours. 

The cows are milked twice, once at three o'clock 
 in the morning, and once at two or three in the af- 
 ternoon. 

'The operation of milking in these stables is as pe- 
 culiar as it is disgusting. At the appointed time, 
 the man who is specially engaged for this purpose 
 enters the stal)le with a pail or can, and, raising the 
 cow from the filth in which she has been lying, and 
 with which she is covered, commences the milking 
 process. Abimt eight or ten minutes are generally 
 required to milk a cow, but the time is of course al- 
 ways regulated l)y the quantity given. An expert 
 hand at the work will milk a dozen cows in an hour 
 and a half, and we are told of one man who perform- 
 ed the task in a still shorter time. There is no arti- 
 cle of food which requires more cleanliness in its 
 manipulation than milk. The vessels in which it is 
 contained require constant cleansing ; but the men 
 engaged in the swill milk business scorn all such 
 nicety, for with them cleanliness appears to be an 
 exploded idea. Their hands are seldom or never 
 washed before milking, and indeed if they were they 
 would soon be soiled by the cow's udder. In the 
 process it occasionally happens that a lump of dirt 

falls into the liquid, when the hand of the milker 
 most unceremoniously follows it and bringsit out. The 
 udders of some cows have been known to be afflicted" 
 with ulcers, yet even in that condition they were- 
 milked, and the milk mixed with the general stock 
 for distribution. These details, disgusting as they 
 are, fall far short of the reality. 

The treatment to which the poor animals are »ub- 
 jected is so severe that they often sink under it. 
 When they become diseased, as not unfrequemtly 
 happens, they are milked up to within one or two- 
 days of their death ; and when no ionger able to- 
 stand, they are held up until the process is perform- 
 ed. A friend who was an ' eye-witness to a case of 
 this kind, informed us that when every moans had 
 been tried to make the cow stand, and when kicks 
 and blows proved ineffectual for the purpose, two- 
 men sustained, while the tfcird milked her. Whea- 
 their sunport was removed, she fell to the ground^ 
 where she lay till death put a period to her suffering. 
 The milk thus obtained must be infected ivith the dis- 
 ease of the animal, and, of course, is loost deleteri- 
 ous to health. Its fatal effect upon children may be 
 seen in the terrible mortality among the infant pop- 
 ulation of the city, who subsist almost exclusively 
 upon milk. 

The quantity of milk furnished daily by the cows 
 in Johnson's stables is about twenty-fonr thousand 
 quarts, but it is increased to thirty thousand by tlie 
 addition of six thousand quarts of water. The profits 
 accruing from this are very large. Estimating this 
 milk at five cents per quart, the price at which it is 
 sold, its total value will be found to amount to ^i,- 
 500. This may exceed the real receipts by one or 
 two hundred dollars, for it is impossible to arrive at 
 an accurate estimate without an inspection of the 
 aec'iunt books. Allowing twelve quarts of milk as 
 the daily average yield of each cow for nine months, 
 we find that the receipts from the sale of milk of a 
 single animal amount to about SIGO in- that period. 
 .\bout $40 more is made by the water with which it 
 is diluted, and which is generally added in the pro- 
 portion of one-fourth. 

This increases the amount to about §200, from 
 which a large profit is obtained after the deduction 
 of all the expenses. These expenses are compara- 
 tively trifling upon a milk dealer who has as many 
 as eighty or a hundred cows, very few of them hav- 
 ing less than twenty. The loss by the death of cattle 
 is sometimesvery heavy.as manyas eieht orten dying 
 in one veek. On a recent visit to Johnson's stables 
 the writer saw two lying dead outside of the stables, 
 exposed to the \iewof the public, and not far from 
 these were two others which had been turned out to 
 die. One had fallen over on its side and was in the 
 last agonies of death, and the other was making vain 
 attempts to stand up. Such scenes are very frequent 
 at this establishment, and may be witnessed almost 
 daily. The stable-men arc hardened by association 
 with then, and regard thdi as the natural concomi- 
 tants of their business. Of those that are diseased, 
 more than one-half are disposed of to butchers, who 
 can purchase them in this condition at two or three 
 cents a pound less than they pay for healthy-ineat. 
 If they run dry bef<u-e becoming diseased, they are 
 fattened (bloated) with a kind of food termed ship- 
 stuff, which consists of mill dust and the worst kind 
 of grain, and sold to such butchers as will buy them. 

A large amount of this kind of moat is used by 
 the poorer classes, who never suspect the reason they 
 obtain It cheaper than it is sold elsewhere. The law 
 has made it a misdemeanor to sell diseased beef, and 
 about a year ago several persons -were arrested fop
