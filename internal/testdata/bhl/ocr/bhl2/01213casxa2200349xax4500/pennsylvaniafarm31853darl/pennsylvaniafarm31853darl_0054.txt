STOWELL'S EVERGREEN CORN.

Stowell's Evergreen Sweet Corn. 

IIo ivlio expects to find this article of corn as 

much superior to the common kinds, as the ambro- 
 sia of the gods was to the food of mortals, will lay 
 down his eolj and pick his teeth in disappointment. 
 He will rise from the table and call it a humbug. — 
 The fact is, he who has good sweet corn upon his 
 table, picked at the right time, and well cooked, has 
 an epicurean dish that he might ask any sensible 
 god in the Mythology to partake of, without fear of 
 refusal. Should some Gorman commentator upon 
 classic lore undertake to prove that this was the ver- 
 itable ambrosia, it •would be difficult to disprove the 
 position. The man who does not appreciate sweet 
 corn as a standard of gustatory exeallence, is not the 
 man to appreciate any edible. But, were the Sto- 
 well's decidedly superior to all other kinds for the 
 table, wo should not expect to have the multitude be- 
 lieve, even after they had tried it. We have heard 
 a very sensible man assert that the common field 
 pumpkin made as good pies as the marrow squash, 
 of Boston notoriety. From that date our faith was 
 very much strengthened in the old adage, "There is 
 no use in disputing aliout tastes." If this new va- 
 riety of corn is as good as the old for the table, and 
 lias other excoUences that the old does not possess, 
 it will prove an acquisition. 

It has boon introduced to the agricultural public 
 uiaiuly tlirough the agency of Professor Mapes; who 
 has sent out tliousand.s of samples of the seed to the 
 readers of his paper in various parts of the country, 
 lie gives the following account of its origin in his 
 paper for December, 1850: — "Stowell's sweet corn 
 is a new sort, and is every way superior to any 
 other we have seen : for, .after being pulled from the 
 ground, the stalks may be placed in a dry, cool 
 piace, free from moisture, frost, or violent currents 
 of air, (to prevent drying,) and the grains will re- 
 main full and milky for manv months. Or the ears 
 may 1)6 pulled in August, and by tying a string 
 loosely around the small end, to prevent the husk? 
 fVoui drying away fi-om the ears, they may be laid 
 oil shelves and kept moist and suitable for boiling, 
 for a year or more. This corn is hybrid, between 
 tlio jMenoniony soft corn and the northern sugar 
 corn, and wast first grown bv Mr. Nathan Stowell. 
 of Burlington, N. J. Near the close of the Fair ol 
 the American Institute, 18.50, I presented the Mana- 
 gers with two ears, pulled in August, 1840, and 
 twelve ears pulled in 1850. They were boiled and 
 served up together, and appeared to be alike, and 
 equal to corn fresh from the garden. 

"The ears are larger than the usual sweet corn, 
 and contain twelve rows. To save the seed, it is 
 necessary to place the ears in strong currants of air, 
 freed from most of the husks, and assisted slightly 
 by tire heat when nearly dry. In damp places this 
 corn soon moulds, and becomes worthless. The 
 seed when dry, is but little thicker than writing pa- 
 per, but is a sure grower. The stalks are very sweet, 
 and valuable as a fodder." 

A writer in the Rural New Yorker tried it in 1851, 
 and speaks thus of it: — "Until it began to tassel out, 
 it appeared very much like cnormnus broom corn, 
 and exhibited no symptoms of putting forth ears un- 
 til very late in the seasim, when it eared rapi'Uy 
 au^l b re three very large, full ears on all the best 
 stalks, and in some cases the fourth was f\iirly set. 
 Only a very few of the stalks bore single ears. It 
 matured rapidly and very perfectly; but it was many 
 weeks after fro.st set in, and the corn was housed, 
 and after the husks had become entirely white, be- 

fore any of the kernels presented the shrivelled ap- 
 pearance of sweet corn. 

"That it will do all that has been said of it I hav» 
 no reason to doubt, as far as my observation through 
 one season extends. I am satisfied it is a most val- 
 uable acquisition to our sweet corn. It grows free- 
 ly, is of the first quality, and produces in my garden 
 this so:ison far Ijeyond any corn I have yet seen. Be- 
 sides the greater number of grains on a stalk, each 
 ear and kernel is very large, although it dries down 
 for seed to a very smixU ear and kernel. Very few 
 of the ears have less than fourteen rows, and I have^ • 
 just noticed an ear of it only seven inches long, and' 
 yet it had sixteen rows, and contained more than 
 eight hundred kernels. The day I planted this corn 
 I planted an equal number of hills of a very supe- 
 rior kind of sweet corn, the kernels of which most 
 perfectly resembled this; and although the exposure ' 
 and soil were equal, yet the Stowell corn surpassed 
 it in every respect. I shall try it another season 
 with increased interest." 

Another writer in the same paper gives us his ex- 
 perience for 1852: "When I read of the wonderful 
 productiveness and keeping quality of this new kind 
 of corn, I rather regarded it as a humbug. How- 
 ever, I bought a gill of seed for twenty-five cents, 
 and planted it. May 25th, in rather an unfavorable 
 spot for late planting. But it matured in good time, 
 and produced from three to seven perfect, good ears 
 on a stalk ; and one stalk had on it sixteen — the 
 shortest about two inches, but well filled out, and all 
 ripe enough, and good for seed. I wish to record 
 my vote in favor of the evergreen corn, that it is 7io 
 humbug." 

I will add to these trials of the article my own 
 experience for the last two seasons. I procured a 
 few seeds from the office of the Working Farmer, 
 in New York, in the springof 1851. I planted them 
 late, but owing to the drought only six kernels came 
 up. I had eighteen perfect ears from these six ker- 
 nels, and two imperfect ones. This showed the corn 
 a very superior bearer. The growth of stalks was 
 large. 

I had now seed enough to plant about one-third 
 of an acre, after giving away some to friends. The 
 soil was badly exhausted by cropping, and was not 
 highly manured. But the growth of stalks was 
 large, and the yield of corn was satisfactory ; though 
 the season was one of great drought, and corn sufT- 
 ered much throughout the country. Some of the 
 stalks had three ears, and many of them two, with 
 settings for more, showing what it had a mind to do, 
 if the soil had been in better heart, and the season 
 more propitious. I h-vc no doubt that in very rich 
 soil there will be often three ears upon a single stalk, 
 and some stalks of twice that number. We may 
 thm set down the advantages of this sweet corn, as 
 mainly the following: 

1st. Its exquisite flavor is not injured by the hy- 
 bridizing, as has been the case with other attempts 
 at crossing the sweet corn with other varieties. 

2d. It secures a very much larger yield of corn. 
 The number of rows upon an ear varies from eight 
 to twenty. A very large proportion of them are 
 twelve and upward. Most of the large ears have 
 from four hundred to eight hundred kertiels upon 
 them. Then we have more cars upon a stalk. 

3d. It prolongs the season of green corn until 
 frost comes ; and if it be pulled up by the roots and 
 sheltered, it lengthens it until freezing weather. 

4th. If you have a fruit room where you can com- 
 mand the temperature, you can have green corn the 
 year round on the cob. But as we have no such
