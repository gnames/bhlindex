5th. It furnishes the largest amount of fodder of 
 any kind of corn grown in the North. Prof. Mapcs 
 says,"The Stowell corn when thickly sown will yield 
 double the burden of stalks and leaves of any other 
 com we have tried. It is more easily cured, and 
 preferred by cattle even to the best English hay." 

The only drawback to be apprehended, and this 
 perhaps is imaginary, is the danger of its crying 
 back to the original from which it was produced — a 
 danger that is common, I believe, to all hybrids, 
 until long cultivation has fixed their peculiarities. — 
 Whether the variety of rows that the different ears 
 assume is any indication of a relapse, the experi- 
 menter must judge for himself. I have full confi- 
 dence in the article, and believe it a great acqui- 
 sition to the garden and the farm. [Plough, Loom

A F'iue Orchard. 

One of the finest orchards in America is that o' 
 Pelham farm, at Esopus, on the Hudson. It is no 
 less remarkable for the beauty and high flavor of its 
 fruit, than the constant productiveness of trees. The 
 proprietor, R. L. Pell, Esq., has kindly furnished us 
 with some notes of his experiments on fruit trees, 
 and we subjoin the following highly interesting one 
 on the Apple. 

"For several years past I have been experimenting 
 on the apple, having an orchard of 2,000 bearing 
 Newtown Pippin trees. I found it very unprofitable 
 to wait for what is termed the "bearing year," and 
 it has been my aim to assist nature, so as to enable 
 the trees to bear every year. I have noticed that 
 from the extensive productiveness of this tree, it re- 
 quires the intermediate year to recover itself — to ex- 
 tract from the earth and the atmosphere the materi- 
 als to enable it to produce again. This it is notable 
 to do, unassisted by art, while it is loaded with fruit, 
 and the intervening year is lost; if, however, the 
 tree is supplied with proper food it will bear every 
 year ; at least such has been the result of my expe- 
 rments. Three years ago, in April, I scraped all 
 the rough bark from the stems of several thousand 
 trees in my orchards, and washed all the trunks and 
 limbs within reach with soft soap; trimmed out all 
 the branches that crossed each other, early in -June, 
 and painted the wounded part with white lead, to 
 exclude moisture and prevent decay. I then, in the 
 latter part of the same month, slit the bark by run- 
 ning a sharp pointed knife from the ground to the 
 first set of limbs, which prevents the tree from be- 
 coming liark liound, and gives the young wood an 
 onportunity of expanding. In July I placed one 
 peck of oyster shell lime under each tree, and left it 
 piled about the trunk until November, during which 
 time the drought ■ras excessive. In November the 
 lime was dug in thorouglily. The following year I 
 collected from these trees 1700 barrels of fruit, part 
 of wliich was sold in New York for four, and others 
 in London for nine dollars per barrel. The cider 
 made from the refuse, delivered at the mill two days 
 after its manufacture, I sold for three dollars and 
 three quarters per barrel of 32 gallons, exclusive of 
 the barrel. In October I manured these trees with 
 stable manure in which the ammonia had been fixed, 
 and covered this immediately \ith earth. The suc- 
 ceeding autumn they were literally bending to the 
 ground with the finest fruit I ever saw, while the 
 other trees in my orchard not so treated are quite 
 barren, the last season having been their bearing 

year. I am now placing round each tree one peck 
 of charcoal dust, and propose in the spring to cover 
 it from the compost heap. 

Jly soil is a strong, deep, sandy loam on a gravel- 
 ly subsoil. I cultivate my orchard grounds, as if 
 there were no trees on them, and raise grain of every 
 kind except rye, which is so very injurious that I be- 
 lieve three successive crops of it would destroy any 
 orchard younger than twenty years. I raised last 
 year in an orchard containing 20 acres, trees 18 years 
 old, a crop of Indian corn which averaged 140 bush- 
 els of ears to the acre." — [Downing's Fruit Book. 

Strawberries. 

BY WM. R. PRINCE, FLUSHING, N. Y. 

I have perused the notices of many varieties of 
 strawberries in your journal for previous months, 
 and in other periodicals, but have not seen any satis- 
 factoi'y and conclusive details, such as would impart 
 to the reader the full knowledge requisite to make 
 his selections uiiderstandiiiglt/ and with absolute cer- 
 tainly. Some excuse may be alledged in consequence 
 of the last season having been particularly unfavor- 
 able, and of the limited period that has in most ca- 
 ses been devoted to these investigations. I shall not 
 in the present article discuss the subject of sexuali- 
 ty and relative productiveness, but will leave that for 
 a future communication, and confine myself in this 
 solely to describing the characteristics of a number 
 of varieties, so as to enable amateurs who are not al- 
 reaily conversant therewith, to make appropriate se- 
 lections for the olijects they have in view — be it as 
 regards large crops for market, or for plentiful fam- 
 ily use, or for insignificant crops to merely gratify 
 the fancy. The varieties which have an asterisk at- 
 tached were originated by myself from seeds during 
 the last eight years. p denotes the pistillate varie- 
 ties, n and p denote those varieties which combine 
 plants of each sex, and all the others are hermaphro- 
 dites or bisexual, and may be used as fertilizers. 

*I. Lr liavon. — Vigorous growth, very large, dark 
 scarlet fruit, sweet, rich, melting. Highest flavor of 
 all, and very productive. 

*2. Triumph. — Fine large fruit on strong stems, 
 beautiful color, very productive. This is a seedling 
 from the Early Scarlet, and a great improvement on 
 it, being twice as large, and thrice as productive,and 
 very valuable. It sometimes produces a partial crop 
 in autumn. 

*3. Charlotte. — Rather large,dark scarlet.delicious 
 sprightly flavor, productive, but with very short pe- 
 duncles, p. 

*4. Superlative — Medium size, being the same as 
 Burr's New Pine, of which it is a seedling, but is 
 more vigorous and more productive than its parent. 
 Berries light scarlet, of a rich and spicy flavor, p. 

*5. Coronation. — Very large, bright scarlet, ovate, 
 tart but nle.asant ; on strong peduncles. Estimable. 

*0. Maijnijique. — Very large, orange scarlet, roun- 
 ded, very productive. P. 

*7. Momtrous Swainsfone. — Vigorous foliage, very 
 large scarlet berries, delicious flavor, productive. _ 

*8. Maximus Swainstone.— Very large, deep crim- 
 son, high flavor, moderate bearer. 

*9. Tificc- Rearing Swainstone.—¥j-Ar\y, medium 
 size, scarlet, oblong cone, rather acid. Very produc- 
 tive. Second crop in September. 

10- Mercellle (Peles.)— Very large, scarlet, oblong 
 cone, beautiful, rich and high flavored. Good bear- 
 er. This is the largest and most celebrated French 
 variety.
