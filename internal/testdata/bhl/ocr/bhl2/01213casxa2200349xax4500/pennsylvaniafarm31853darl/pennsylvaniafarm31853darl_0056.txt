[Mat, 

*11. Primate. — Large, deep scarlet, beautiful, very 
 productive. A good fruit for market, of vigorous 
 growth and luxuriant foliage. 

12. Crimson Cone. — Fair size or rather large, ob- 
 long cone, bright crimson, beautiful,rather acid with- 
 out sugar, the seeds deeply embedded. It is of a very 
 vigorous growth, and very productive. P. There is 
 a hermaphrodite variety which is less productive, but 
 which should be used as a fertilizer for the pistillate. 

*13. Primordian — Resembles its parent, the Crim- 
 son Cone, but is much earlier. It is very productive, 
 but the fruit is rather soft for carriage to market, p. 

*I4. Crimson Pine. — Large, conical, deep scarlet 
 or crimson, sweet, rich. Very productive. H and p. 

*I5. Cornucopia. — Verylarge, scarlet, conical, beau- 
 tiful good flavor, firm, suitable for market. A seed- 
 ling of the Hudson, v. 

*16. Cluster Hudson.— Vm size, conical, scarlet. 
 Very productive, p. 

*17. Ckampion. — A splendid seedling from the 
 Montevideo Pine, very large soailet oblong cone. A 
 fair bearer for this class, and ripening gradually for 
 three weeks. The growth is vigorous. 

*18. Estelle. — Secondary size, crimson, conical ; 
 productive; peculiar flavor, h and p. 

*I9. Profuse Scarlet. — Same size and color as 
 Large Early Scarlet, and much resembles it ; of fine 
 flavor, and produces twice the quantity of fruit, re- 
 sulting from its sexuality, p. 

*20. St/lphide. — Very large, light scarlet, rounded 
 or short coue, beautiful, excellent flavor, productive. 

*2I. Spiral. — -Good size, elongated cone, pleasant 
 flavor. Usually produces a second crop in Septem- 
 ber. 

*22. Tivoli Scarlet. — Very large,oblong cone, beau- 
 tiful. Estimable. Very productive, p. 

*23. Unique Scarlet. — Purse shaped, light scarlet, 
 rich flavor, moderate bearer. 

24. Bishop's Orange. — The true variety is round, 
 of moderate size and beautiful orange scarlet color, 
 not highly flavored but a profuse bearer, and partic- 
 ularly desirable as one of the later varieties that fol- 
 low the general crop. There is a spurious variety 
 cultivated at Rochester and at Boston under this 
 name, which we published in our rejected lists many 
 years since, p. 

2.5. Boston Pine. — Large and splendid, of beauti- 
 ful color and fine quality. It will produce a fair crop 
 on a strong soil, if kept free from runners. It is one 
 among the many important acquisitions for which we 
 are indebted to the Messrs. Hovey, of Boston. 

26. Houei/'s Seedling. — It is almost superfluous to 
 describe this very large and splendid crimson varie- 
 ty. The foliage is broad and luxurient, not as tall as 
 most other varieties. The berries are rather dark 
 colored for a market fruit, and vary greatly in size 
 at the difl'erent pickings, and they are not so highly 
 flavored as the preceding variety. It is, however, so 
 large and productive, that few will be willing to dis- 
 pense with it. p. 

27. Huntsman's Pistillate. — A seedling of ^ontcoi- 
 deo Pine, very large, short cone or rounded, l)right 
 scarlet, indifferent flavo'-. Very productive, p. 

*28. Triumphant Montevideo. — Monstrous size, o- 
 vate, deep scarlet. A fair bearer for this class, which 
 ripens its fruit gr.adually. There are several other 
 fine varieties known as the Colonia, Cordova, Para- 
 na, &c. 

29. Crescent Seedling. — This being newly introdu- 
 ced from the South, its merits as regards a Northern 
 climate require further trial. The plants have not 
 as yet shown any perpetual character here. Hooey's 
 Seedling has proved equally as perpetual or long- 

bearer at the South as the Crescent, the climate ap- 
 parently imparting that charaicter. — [Horticulturist. 

Upland Cranberries. 

At length we have ocular proof of the foct, that 
 cranberries in the greatest perfection, can be raised 
 on upland, shady and gravelly soil. Mr. Joseph Or- 
 cutt has brought us ibr exhibition, a large root of 
 cranberry-vine, placed in a box, which is made to 
 contain a quantity cf the soil from which it had been 
 removed, the vine thickly hanging with ripe fruit — 
 He made the experiment three years ago last May, 
 planting forty bunches in a row two feet apart, with- 
 out previous culture.merely by removing the sod, and 
 pliinting the cranberries with no more trouble and 
 attention than he would have taken with a cabbage 
 plant. 

The soil is a sandy gravel, fit for peach trees, and 
 of which five hundred and twenty-three are growing 
 in an orchard so near as to shed their leaves on the 
 cranberry vines. 

TliC first year he picked about a pint of fruit, the 
 second year, four quarts, the third, or present year, 
 from seven to eight quarts of remarkably fine fruit. 
 The vines have shot the present season, three feet 
 six inches in length, are suprisingly strong and 
 healthy, and the old wood is loaded thickly with the 
 finest berries. 

We no . consider the question, "Can cranberries 
 be cultivated with success on upland ?" as decided ia 
 the aflirmative. — [Boston Cultivator. 

Select Fruits. 

The descriptions of the following choice varieties 
 of Cherries and Plums, are from "Downing on Fruit 
 Trees." 

Among the long array of names, these have prov- 
 en to be especially worthy of cultivation. We shall 
 continue in future numbers, engravings of our best 
 and most desirable fruits, so as to make the Farm 
 Journal a book of reference to those about to plant 
 orchards, and commence Fruit Culture, as a syste- 
 matic branch of business. This regular feature of 
 our Journal has been received with much favor, and 
 will be a great aid to those not perfectly familiar with 
 proper selectiohs. Farmers, judging from the de- 
 mand for trees, the present spring, are awakening at 
 last to the importance of growing fine fruit, not mere- 
 ly as an indispensable part of dome-itic economy, and 
 fiiraily use, but for marketing. No use can be made 
 of land, in our opinion, which will be so profitable. 
 Those who have dairy farms, and attend markets 
 regularly, are particularly interested in cultivating 
 fruit of all kinds, to go .along with their butter, poul- 
 try, &c. A large proportion of marketing in the 
 vicinity of Philadelphia, goes by railroad, and a few 
 bushels of Bartlett Pears, choice Plums and Cherries, 
 &c., in addition to what is usually taken, will but 
 slightly increase the expense, and only on account of 
 the additional weight. We have known fiirmers to 
 sell Bartlett Pears readily at their stalls at 50 cents 
 per half peck, and other smaller fruits, a succession 
 of different kinds kept up, at prices which show in
