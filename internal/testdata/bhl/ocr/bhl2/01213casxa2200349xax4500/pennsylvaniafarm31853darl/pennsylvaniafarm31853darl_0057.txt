the year's aco ounts, quite a handsome sum. By the 
 time this number of the Journal reaches our readers, 
 the planting season for Fruit Trees will have passed 
 If it has cot been improved, let the resolution be 
 formed, and the ground prepared by Potatoes or oth- 
 er hoed crops and good fencing, for planting in the 
 fall. 

Plans for orchards, selection of varieties, ic, should 
 be prepared and well digested; memorandums made, 
 before the planting season comes round, when it often 
 finds one hurried and unprepared. 
 CHERRIES. 

Fig. I.-Black Tartarian'. This 
 superb fruit h:n alreadybecome 
 a general favorite in all our 
 gardens; and in size, flavor and 
 productiveness, it has no su- 
 perior among black cherries. 
 It is a Russian, and West Asi- 
 an variety, introduced into Eng- 
 land about 179G, and brought 
 thence to this country about 
 twenty years ago. It is re- 
 markable for its rapid, vigor- 
 ous growth, large leaves, and 
 the erect habit of its head. — 
 The fruit ripens about the 
 middle of Jyne, a few days af- 
 ter the Mayduke. 

Fruit of the largest size, 
 heart-shaped, (sometimes rath- 
 ler obtuse,) irregular and un- 
 leven on the surface. Skin glos- 
 'sy, bright purplish black. — 
 Flesh purplish, thick, (the stone 
 being quite small,) half-tender, 
 and juicy. Flesh very rich and 
 delicious.

Fig.2.-YELL0W Spanish, BiG- 
 akreau.Graffion. Thisnoble 
 fruit is the Bigarreau par ex- 
 cellence, and is unquestiona- 
 bly one ot the largest, most 
 beautiful and delicious o f 
 cherries. It was introduced 
 into this country about the 
 vear 1800, by the late William 
 Prince, of Flushing, and has 
 been very extensively diss m- 
 inated under the names of 
 Yellow Spanish, Graffion,and 
 Bigarreau. The tree is short 
 but tlirifty in growth, mak- 
 ing strung lateral shoots , 
 and forming a large and 
 handsome head with spread- 
 ing branches — and it com- 
 mences bearing abundantly 
 and regularly even while 
 young. Its very large size 
 and beautiful appearance, to- 
 gether with the firmness of 

its flesh renders it a very val- 

uable variety to cultivate for market. Figure 2. 

Fruit very large, and of beautiful waxen appear- 
 aaee, regularly formed, obtuse heart-shaped, the bas e 
 a good deal flattened. Stalk stout, nearly two inches 
 long, inserted in a wide hollow. Skin pale whitis h 

yellow on the shaded side, bordered with minute car 
 mine dots and deepening into bright red finely mar 
 bled on the sunny side. Flesh pale yellow, quite 
 firm, jucy, with a rich, sweet, and delicious flavour 
 if allowed fully to ripen. In perfection the last of 
 June. 

Fig.3-ELT0N. The Elton,a seedling 
 raised in 1806, by the late Presi- 
 dent of the London Horticultural 
 Society; is certainly one of the 
 first of cherries in all respects. 
 Its large size,early maturity, beau- 
 tiful appearance, luscious flavor, 
 and productiveness, render it uni- 
 versally esteemed. It is a cross- 
 bred variety raised from the Bi- 
 garreau or Grafiion with the 
 White Heart for its male parent. 
 The trees grow very vigorously, 
 and are readily known, when in 
 foliage, by the unusually dark red 
 color of the footstalks of the 
 leaves. 

Fruit large, rather pointed, 
 heart-shaped. Skin thin, shin- 
 ing pale yellow on the shaded 
 side, but with a cheek next to 
 the sun delicately mottled and 
 streaked with bright red. Stalk 
 Figure o. long and slender. Flesh some- 

what firm at first, but becoming nearly tender, juicy, 
 with a very rich and luscious flavor, not surpassed by 
 any large cherry known. Ripens about the middle 
 of June, or directly after the Mayduke. 

PLUMS. 

Jefferson 
 Plum. Fig. 4. — 
 If we were ask- 
 ed which we 
 think the most 
 desirable and 
 beautiful of all 
 dessert plums, 
 we should un- 
 doubtedly give 
 the name of this 
 new variety. — 
 When fully ripe, 
 it is nearly, shall 
 we not say quite 
 — -equal in fla- 
 vor to the Green 
 Gage, that un- 
 surpassable 
 standard of fla- 
 vor. But when 
 we contrast the 
 small and rath- 
 Figure 4. er insignificant 
 apearance of the Green Gage, with the unusual size 
 and beauty of the Jefferson, we must admit that it 
 takes the very first rank. As large as the Washing- 
 ton, it is more richly and deeply colored, being dark 
 yellow,uniformly and handsomely marked with a fine 
 ruddy cheek. It is about ten days or a fortnight la- 

ter than the Washington, ripening the last of August, 
 when it has the quality of hanging long on the tree, 
 gradually improving in flavor. It does not, like
