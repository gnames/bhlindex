SELECT FRUITSâ€” DEODAR CEDAR. 

[Mat, 

many sorts, appear liable t > the attacks of wasps, 
 which destroy so many of the light colored plums as 
 soon as they arrive at maturity. 

We received the Jefferson Plum a few years ago, 
 from the late Judge Buel, by whom it was raised and 
 named. The original tree is still, we believe, grow- 
 in his garden near Albany. It is a good and regular 
 bearer, and the crop is very handsome upon the 
 tree. 

Branches slightly downy, leaves oval, flat. Fruit 
 large, oval, slightly narrowed on one side, towards 
 the stalk. Skin golden yellow, with a beautiful pur- 
 plisli-red cheek, and covered with a white thin bloom. 
 Stalk an inch long, pretty stout, very slightly insert- 
 ed. Suture indistinct. Flesh deep orange, (like 
 that of an Apricot,) parts freely, and almost entirely 
 from the stone, which is long and pointed; very rich, 
 juicy, luscious and highly flavored. Hangs a fort- 
 niffht on the tree. 

Bolmar's Wash- 
 ington. Fig.5. The 
 AVashington un- 
 doubtedly stands 
 higher in general 
 estimation in this 
 country, than any 
 other plum. Al- 
 though not equal 
 to the Green Gage 
 and two or three 
 others,in high fla- 
 vor, yet its great 
 size, its beauty, 
 and the vigor and 
 the hardiness of 
 the tree, are qual- 
 ites which have 
 brought this no- 
 ble fruit into no- Figure 5. 
 tice every where. The parent tree grew originally 
 on Delancey's farm, on the east side of the Bowery, 
 New York, but being grafted with another sort, es- 
 caped notice, until a sucker from it, planted by Mr. 
 Bolmar,* a merchant in Chatham street, came" into 
 bearing about the year 1818, and attracted universal 
 attention by the remarkable beauty and size of the 
 fruit. In 1821, this sort was first sent to the Horti- 
 cultural society of London, by the late Dr. Ilosack, 
 and it now ranks as first in nearly all the European 
 collections. 

The Washington, large, broad, crumpled and glos- 
 sy foliage, is a strong grower, and forms a handsome 
 round head. Like several other varieties of plum, 
 the fruit ot this especially in sandy soils, does not at- 
 tain its full perfection until the tree has bornefor sev- 
 eral years. We have measured them very often six 
 inches in circumference, and once from Mr. Bolmar's 
 original tree, seven and a quarter inches. 

Wood light brown, downy. Fruit of the largest 
 size, roundish oval, with an obscure suture, except 
 near the stalk. Skin dull yellow, with faint mar- 
 blings of green, but when well ripened, deep yellow, 
 with a pale crimson blush or dots. Stalk scarcely 
 three-fourths of an inch long, a little down, set in a 
 shallow, wide hollow. Flesh yellow, firm, very sweit 
 and luscious, separating freely from the stone. Stone 
 pointed at each end. Ripens from about the middle 
 to the last of August.

Deodar Cedar. 

The Deodar Cedar, a native ot the high mountains 
 of India, and found at an elevation of 7 to 14,000 
 feet, is one of our acquisitions from abroad, which 
 maintains its foremost place as an ornament to the 
 Park and arboretum, while many others coming into 
 the country, with a high reputation, hare grown 
 more or less into disfavor. The Deodar, of which 
 our engraving is a specimen, thirty feet high, is per- 
 fectly hardy, and quite a rapid grower. These are 
 two great desideratums. Then again it maintains its 
 color at all seasons, having the advantage in this par- 
 ticular of the Cedar of Lebanon, and others which 
 become of a dingy, brown hue in winter. We regret 
 to observe this latter to be the case with Cryptomeria 
 Japonioa. 

The f)liagiof thj Djodar is quite peculiar, being 
 of a silvery green color, its habit pendent, graceful, 
 and with its rich, luxuriant foliage, forms one of the 
 most picturesque, and beautiful objects on a lawn 
 that can be imagined. Its popularity is greatly on 
 the increase, and as it has been tested, in this coun- 
 try for several years, can now be recommended with 
 great confidence. Those in our grounds, in the se. 
 vere winter of 1831 and 52 were but very slightly 
 alfjcted. The wood of the Djodar is valued in its 
 native country for its great durability. We copy be- 
 low from a late number of the London Gardeners' 
 Chronicle, some appropriate remarks as to the style
