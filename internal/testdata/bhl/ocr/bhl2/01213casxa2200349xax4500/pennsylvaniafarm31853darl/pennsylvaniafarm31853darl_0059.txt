pf Landscape Gardening, for which the Deodar is bes' 
 idapted. 

"Like the Cedar of Lebanon, the Deodar is chiefly 
 valuable as an element in landscape composition ; 
 ind its character in relation to this point has hither- 
 ;o, I think, not been pointed out. The extremely 
 •igid habit of the Cedar of Lebanon, its strictly hor- 
 zoatal branches, and, especially that peculiar flat- 
 less of head which is remarkable in older specimens 

those at the Chelsea Botanic Gardens, for example) 
 ind which painters have so much and so happily in- 
 Toduced into their pictures, combine to render it 
 what may be called an architectural tree; and the 
 ioraparatively dark hue of its foliage contributes to 
 heighten that character. It is, in fact, singularly 
 adapted for associating intimately with buildings in 
 ;he Grecian, Roman, or Italians styles of architecture; 
 or, indeed, with any structure in which the lines are 
 principally horizontal. AVith the Deodar the case is 
 widely different. It is essentially a garden or lawn 
 plant. Its drooping branches, pyramidal or conical 
 form, and the extreme paleness ofitsalmnst glaucous 
 foliage, quite unfit it for blending with architectural 
 jbjeots, and demaid that it should stand out alone 
 aad unaccompanied. Nothing can be more graceful 
 than its appearance, thus isolated, on a lawn or in a 
 park, particularly when in the neighborhood of the 
 iarker-foliaged Coniferous plants a3 in a Pinetum. 
 It is true that, like its kindred Cedar, it is an appro- 
 priate ornament in architectural gardening, where it 
 makes a delightful avenue. But it will not boar to 
 be brought too near a house, much less into contact 
 with it, having nothing in its aspect or. habit that 
 would at all harmonise with any style of building, 
 Its expression, in short, is the very opposite of that 
 demanded in an architectural accompaniment, and 
 which is so admirably realized in the Cedar of Leb- 
 anon. 

The Diodar loses nearly all its interest and beau- 
 ty unless allowed to retain the whole of its br.anches 
 to the very base, permitting no encroachment from 
 its neii;hbors without being seriously damaged. — [Ed-

Phosphate of Lime. — Mr. Johnson (agent of the 
 State of New York at the London World's Fair,) 
 took to England specimens of a deposite of Phosphate 
 of Lime — apparently a true vein, from two to eight 
 feet wide — found on the bank of Lake Champlain, 
 Crown Point, Essex county, N. Y. lie presented a 
 sample to the Royal Agricultural Society, by which 
 it was immediately referred to its chemist, Prof. Way, 
 who analized it and reported that it contained 30 per 
 of Phosphoric Acid, 40 per cent of Lime, combined 
 with Peroxide of Iron, Sand, Magnesia, and a little 
 Potash, Soda, &e. Prof. W. estimated the value o i 
 the American Phosphate as about equal to that of its 
 British counterpart. 

Soon after Mr. J. 's return to this country, he re- 
 ceived a letter from a leading British house engaged 
 in preparing artificial manure, stating that, should 
 the Crown Point mine prove equal to the sample ex- 
 hiliited (as it will) he was prepared to malce an offer 
 ,/'/■ the entire product. Thus, while not one-tenth of 
 our own farmers residing within a hundred miles of 
 <.'rii\vn Point know or care for the existence of any 
 su'h mine, and hardly know what Phosphate means, 
 th' British farmers have probably secured flie entire 
 drpositc, to fertilize their fields three thousand miles 
 aw.ay.— [N. Y. Tribune. 

Splrea Pruulfulia Flore Pleno. 

We give an engraving of a br.anch of this beauti- 
 ful spirea in flower, which will give some idea of its 
 character. It is one of the contributions from Japan, 
 and is a great acquisition to our stock of hardy 
 shrubs. The flowers are pure white, very double, 
 and bloom in clusters very profusely. It answers ex- 
 ceedingly well for forcing in the house, and either 
 there or in the flower garden, with its delicate wreaths 
 of small snow white blosoms, is a most attractive 
 object. 
 The spireas are a very numerous fiimily. Don, in his 
 gardeners' dictionary, enumerates over forty sp°cies, 
 and several varieties. The three best we consider to 
 be, the above, with Reevesii or Lanceolata, and Doug- 
 lasii. Reevesii is a native of the Mauritius and Chi- 
 na, blooms in the spring, and is also pure white; 
 flowers in umbels, and in both leaf and flower is very 
 striking and beautiful. We consider it the best of 
 the list that we have seen. Douglasii is a native of 
 the northwest coast of America, blooms later in the 
 season in panicles, of a rosy lilac color, and is also 
 very pretty. Some spireas are indispensable in every 
 good collection of shrubbery, and a succession of 
 bloom may be kept up with them through the season. 

Waste of Fertilizing Manure. — At the meeting 
 of the Farmers' Club, on Tuesday, an article wa-i 
 read by Mr. Pell on the waste of excrement in our 
 city sewers. He said that the subject was of great 
 importance. In our city, with its present population, 
 taking as an average that each person, young and 
 old, yield sixteen pounds, it would supply eight hun- 
 dred pounds of wheat or rye, with the requisite 
 quantity of nitrogen, more than is necessary for an 
 acre of land. Thus, our city might afford nitrogen, 
 annually, sufBcient to raise 480,000,000 pounds of 
 wheat, by adding a small quantity of ashes .and 
 bone-dust. The English are as improviilent as we 
 are. All the matter in the sewers in London is 
 emptied into the Thames. In New York, G(K),00l> 
 tons of this excrenientitious matter is lost. It was 
 proposed by Mr. Pell to get the proper authorities to 
 try and save this vast amount of fertilizing manure, 
 which was lost in our cities. — [N. Y. Daily Times.
