 Imported Cattle. 

Mr. Editor: 

Your correspondent, II. Shubort, in a 
 late number of the Journal, seems to go against the 
 introduction of imported cattle as "an unfair specu' 
 lation," and "thinks it has taken money out of far- 
 mers' pockets, without any substantial benefit." I 
 beg leave to differ from him on these points entirely, 
 and as I do not own a single pure blood animal, have 
 noije for sale, and no interest in any, can speak free 

from prejudice. I consider these importations have 
 been of great advantage to the whole country, and 
 that the increase in consequence of tliem, in the pro- 
 duction of both beef and dairy products, have been 
 very great. We are all under great obligations to 
 Mr. Renick, of Ohio, and to General Cadwalader, 
 James Gowen, Dennis Kelley, T. P. Remington, Mr. 
 Twaddel and others, in this section, who have the 
 means, and are willing to pay high prices, and to in- 
 cur the risks of so doing, which the generality of 
 armers could not afford, to introduce improved stock 
 nto the country. The whole farming community is 
 ultimately benefited by it. Who that notices the 
 droves of fat and stock cattle, and milch cows, com- 
 ing here from the West, but knows and sees the great 
 improvement in their form and quality within a few 
 years. Many of them show a cross with Durham 
 Devon, or other imnorted breed, and at the same ai'e' 
 and with Zcs.syi'rf can be made to weigh some hundred 
 pounds more than the old unimproved native stock. 
 It is a strange notion, indeed, at this time, to talka- 
 bout the imported stock being of no advantage. I pre- 
 sume Mr. Sliubert has no experience with them, or 
 he would not venture such a statement. I have fed 
 some part bloods, and know that less feed will make 
 more weight. We thus gain at both ends. 1 am 
 aware that the full bred Durham, often makes what 
 the Butcher calls too Jleshy an animal, having to i 
 much predominance of muscle, not sufiioiently inter- 
 larded with fat; still we are speaking now of using 
 them to improve our native breeds, and my own ob- 
 servation and experience is, that when crossed they 
 improve the latter greatly, giving them more size, 
 greater aptitude to fatten, much finer form, and with 
 less ofial; nutting the weight on the most valuable 
 parts, and also much easier to be kfcpt in good con. 
 dition. The heaviest and fattest, anil most perfect 
 animals on record, are the pure Durhams. At the 
 high prices which Mr. Shubertso complains of, there 
 is, however, very little danger of the full bloods be- 
 ing slaughtered for beef, so that its being "dry and 
 coarse" avails nothing in the argument, as we are 
 speaking of them for improving our native stock. It 
 is well known that the beef of part blood animals i, 
 neither "dry nor coarse," but rich and juicy. Now, 
 as regards their value for milk iind butter, it is welj 
 known that the pure Durham cows, in this respect 
 have far exceeded any other breed. From my ohser- 
 L-ation, the cress with them has much impi-oved our 
 native stock in this particular, at least it is so in this 
 neighborhood ; our most productive dairies being 
 those where the cows have a strong cross with 
 the Durham. No doubt there are some families of 
 the Durham stock not deep milkers, but better for 
 feeding, and a farmer must select such as suit his 
 purpose, whether for the dairy or shambles. lie can 
 bo suited in both respects, and has cause to con- 
 gratulate himself that public spirited gentlemen
