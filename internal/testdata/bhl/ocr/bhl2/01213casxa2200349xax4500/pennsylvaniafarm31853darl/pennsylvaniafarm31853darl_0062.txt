 George Walker's Premium Crop of Corn. 

Mr. Editor — jS(>; 

It was well remarked, "before 
 an-ricultural societies were introduced in any com- 
 munity or State, little indeed was heard of wonder- 
 fully redundant crops, because no inducement had 
 yet been given for inflation, or slight of hand meas- 
 urement." An extravagantly large crop of corn 
 havino-been reported at the State fair, by Mr. George 
 Walker, of this county, I will, with your leave, offer 
 a few remarks thereon by way of elucidation ; and 
 which, sir, vou may publish in the Farm Journal if, 
 in your judgment, they will subserve any public 
 benefit. ■ ' 

Messrs. Cope and Chamberlain gave it as their 
 opinion that Mr. W.'s crop would shrink from one- 
 fourth to one-third. From the experience I have had, 
 I think full one-third at least. On, or about the first 
 of December, several years since, I saw some corn 
 in a mill wliich took my fancy, and I bought the toll 
 of two bushels (six quarts) for seed. After being 
 thoroughly dried it did not look like the same corn ; 
 and it had actually shrunk one-fourth. It was one 
 of our earlier kinds; and had it been taken from the 
 cob as soon as it had become hard, its shrinkage 
 would not have been less than one-third. Mr. W.'s 
 corn was in a very green state, much of it only in 
 roastin"' condition, and was much marred by shell- 
 ing it. Now we all know that grains in a humid or 
 moist condition will not take a close position in the 
 measure, and the more so in proportion to their be- 
 ini^ broken. Even for this one-tenth more, I think, 
 ought to bo allowed. I have also been informed by 
 one who tested it, that this kind of corn is generally 
 four pounds below standard weight, or one-fourteenth. 
 The above fractions added together make fifty-throe 
 one hundred and fifths, or a trifling more than half 
 to be deducted, reducing the one hundred and sixty 
 bushels to seventy-nine and three pecks ! 

The judges of corn for our society, of whom Mr. 
 W. was one, reported only one hundred and twenty- 
 five bushels. If I place more confidence in this, I 
 hope no one will feel aggrieved. Applying, then, the 
 forecoin" computation, we shall have a mere fraction 
 abo\e sixty-three bushels of merchantable grain to 
 the acre ! That those who measured were sincere, 
 and measured as correctly as they could, under the 

circumstances, I do not doubt. But surely, grain in 
 the conilition which that was, ought never to be re. 
 ported by measure to any society, nor any where else. 
 This reporting of wind and water as grain (and I can 
 not call it else) will not do; and societies ought, and 
 I sincerely hope they will, raise an effectual barrier 
 against it. There is nothing of which I am surer 
 than this, that those who persist in doing so, will do 
 more injury than benefit. 

From the common tenor of remark at home, as 
 well as abroad, neither our soil nor our sjoiety are 
 deriving much credit from that crop, how great soev- 
 er it may have been. The report is not much be- 
 lieved among us ; and others have as good grounds 
 for disbelief as any here have. Indeed such are the 
 circumstances, and which I have not room to relate, 
 as to warrant disbelief. 

Reason and common sense, as well as justice, de. 
 mand that, in making up the report of crops, noth- 
 ing imaginary, inflated, or calculated to mislead, 
 should be admitted — that nothing but absolute meas. 
 ufe'i'n pure dry grain should be presented. Facts, 
 reliable facts, based upon absolute measurements — 
 sucli statements as commend themselves to belief — 
 such as embody reality, ever find favor and are list- 
 ened to with applause: the reverse commands disbe- 
 lief and disgust, as well it may; and it tends direct- 
 ly to prevent the increase of membership, and to 
 throw back the enterprize. 

He who will take the pains to measure some of his 
 corn next season, in the green and in the dry state, I 
 am sure will be surprised at the difference. I am 
 confident he will not regard my computation as in- 
 consistent then, if he now does. 

Forty bushels of corn to the acre is, I believe, by 
 our farmers considered an average crop for our coun- 
 ty, more falling below than over going that quantity. 
 There are, however, a very few localities, which, 
 having long enjoyed great natural advatages, by ex- 
 cessive craming from the barnyard, and extra atmos- 
 pheric influence, owing to the variation of the season 
 have produced much more. But he who entertains 
 the belief that four times forty have been raised to 
 the acre, greatly errs. All the sections of our State 
 as 'I am informed, have been challenged by a citizen 
 of our county, fiir corn raising. With all due differ- 
 ence to the gentleman and his opinion, I think he 
 sets our county a little too higli. ■ My opinion is, if 
 the farmers of the other counties will but cram ex- 
 cessively their best soils, and measure the grain as 
 soon as it is out of the milk — do just as some here 
 have done — other counties can then tell as big, if not 
 bigger, corn stories than Susquehanna has done.
