Education of Farmers. 

To THE Editors of the Farm Journal. — It is a 
 curious inquiry why tlie knowledge of agriculture 
 progresses so slowly ; and why it has yet attained 
 so little in this Country. It is a fact which we are 
 all willing to concede, that our productions are little 
 more than one half of what they should be, and far 
 less than what they are elsewhere ; and yet we seem 
 to be content to bide our time, and bo satisfied with 
 results, when accident or chance shall produce them, 
 or when we shall be jostled from the "old way" by 
 the coming generation. 

More than seven hundred years before the Chris- 
 tian era, Isaiah prophetically speaks of a threshing 
 machine, "Behold, I will make thee a new sharp 
 threshing instrument having teeth." And yet this 
 intimation pointing out almost the very structure of 
 the machine now in so common use, was not realized 
 until the nineteenth century ; and then received with 
 a doubting caution that well nigh dampened the ex- 
 periment. The merchant has carried his cnterprize 
 into every nook and corner of the known — and I had 
 almost written unknown world;^ — the learned hav.e ex- 
 erted their talents to the developement and practical 
 application o[ scientific principles, whicli has given 
 to their class an enviable place in the estimation of 
 mankind: — th^ mechanic, availing himself of these 
 developements' of science, has given them form and 
 shape to an extent which entitles them to the admi- 
 ration of the world; whilst the farmer stands to gaze 
 with mingled feelings of doubt and astonishment, 
 that all the other pursuits of lite whirl so rapidlv 
 past him. 

What is the remedy for this admitted evil ? AVe 
 answer — -the education of farmer's sons through the 
 medium of an agricultural school. AVe mean a 
 school to educate boys in the art and science of farm- 
 ing: and unless the farmers of our State will zealous- 
 ly embrace this idea, and avail themselves of it, there 
 is no hope that their condition can be otherwise im- 
 proved, but by the lapse of time, and happening cf 
 accidental circumstances. 

There is no one of the colleges of this Country 
 adapted to instruct a farmer; on the contrary their 
 system is calculated to educate young men to a state 
 of entire unfitness for any sucli occupation. A boy, 
 graduated at one of our literary institutions, has al- 
 ready spent that part of his life which alone can be 
 profitably employed taleatn the art of farming; and 
 science without art, is still worse than art without 
 science. There is peculiar reason why farmers should 
 take up this subject and make it their own. It is a 
 fact with regard to the system upon which literary 
 institutions are at present based, that their pecuni- 
 ary resources are never adequate to their ne jcssities, 
 however economical they may be. The consequence 
 of this is that education is made to cost more than 
 they, who rely upon the products of a farm, are able 

to pay. Besides, if this expsnse should have beeju un- 
 dergone the farmer has in all probability driven his 
 son from all taste or desire to pursue the calling for 
 which his maturer judgment intended him. And if 
 the boy should return to the farm, it is to exhibit to 
 his disappointed father and brothers how little he 
 knows of the business of his future life. 

In an Agricultural School the pupils are laborers 
 on the farm as well as in their study; — their bodies 
 are educated to the art, and their minds to the science 
 of farming; — whilst their hands are employed in the 
 work of the farm, their minds are employed in the 
 pursuit of the knowledge of the reasons for what 
 they do — there is thereby an intermingling of theo- 
 retical science and practical art, which is but to be 
 continued through their whole future lives. The In- 
 stitution thus becomes, in a measure, s'elf-sustaining; 
 and the price of education may be reduced to a mere 
 trifle. 

The subject is now before our Legislature in a 
 Bill which provides for the charter of such an insti- 
 tution as we propose. If it should become a law, 
 we desire to call public attention to it, as the best 
 measure which the age has proposed ; if it should 
 not, let the farmers of the State look to it that it 
 does not fail again.

For the Farm Journal. 
 "Theory of the action of Lime on Agriculture." 

Such has been the title of several communications 
 we have read in this Journal, from the pen of Mr 
 G. Blight Browne, in one or two of which he pre- 
 sents to the public rather novel views upon this sub- 
 ject'; and ideas which certainly seem somewhat dis- 
 cordant with generally received opinions. The lat- 
 ter would be no fault, rather an excellence, were his 
 doctrines only supported by some better stnalogy, or 
 at least, by arguments a little more convincing, and 
 bearing a little stronger upon the point in question. 
 We wish particularly to call the attention of the 
 readers of this Journal to an article in the March 
 No., in which Mr. Brow;ne denies that the mellow- 
 ing of a soil by lime, can be in the least degree at- 
 tributed to the action of this agent upon the mineral 
 matter of the earth, confining this result wholly to 
 the liberation of carbonic acid from the Lrg;inic mat- 
 ter. 

Mr. Browne sustains his views almost entirely up- 
 on the following argument: That the comparative- 
 ly small amount of lime is so widely diffused through- 
 out the soil, that its action upon the mineral matter 
 could not possibly be perc-optible. Now if Mr. Browne 
 is a chemist, (as we suppose he is from tlic fact that 
 he advances original theories on obscure chemical 
 subjects,) he will certainly rccollecf the fact that a 
 peculiar characteristic of that class of compounds
