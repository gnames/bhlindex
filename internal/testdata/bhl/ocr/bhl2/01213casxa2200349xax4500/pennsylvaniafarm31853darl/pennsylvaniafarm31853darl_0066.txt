[May, 

called silicates, is, that a large quantity of a previ- 
 ously found silicate possesses the property of com- 
 bining with an almost indefinitely small quantity of 
 a new base, (such as lime,) forming a double salt, 
 whose solubility depends entirely upon the proportion 
 of the silicic acid to the new base. 

Thus a very large portion zf mineral matter may 
 be seriously changed in its chemical nature by a 
 comparatively minute quantity of lime, and the re- 
 arrangement of the atom produced by this transfer 
 of elements, is the true cause of the apparent me- 
 chanical effects produced. 

Quoting now in Mr. Browne's own language his 
 theory, by which he accounts for these changes, 
 which is as follows : 

*'We have seen that in the course of decay of 
 the vegetable matter found in the soil, vegetable acids 
 are formed, which have more affinity for lime than 
 carbonic acid has. When the carbonate of litae 
 yields its carbonic acid in favor of one or the other 
 of these acids, carbonic acid is set free in the gaseous 
 state. This carbonic acid occupies a much larger 
 space in t!ie gaseous state, than it did when combined 
 with lime, and by its expansion has a tendency to 
 rend assunder the earth in which this phenomena 
 takes place. In other words it lightens it in the 
 same way that it lightens a loaf of bread. I believe 
 that in this way only is the soil mellowed by lime, 
 and that, in no instance does it render it more com- 
 pact." We would say that of all the untenable 
 theories that have from time to time been advanced 
 upon this subject, this is certainly the most vision^, 
 ry. Granting that there might be enough carbonic 
 acid extricated from the soil (which is certainly a 
 startling improbability) to lighten the earth "as a 
 lo.af of bread," does Mr. Browne suppose that it 
 could possibly be detained long in a medium so por- 
 ous as the soil. And sir.ce the oxygen of the air 
 must pass down through the earth to oxydize the 
 carbon, is it not probable that the carbonic acid 
 may egress just as freely. Another point we may 
 advert to also ; Mr. Browne of course recollects that 
 carbonic acid is very soluble in water. Now suppos- 
 ing the earth should be "lightened" by minute bub- 
 bles of carbonic acid, does he not know that the first 
 rain would dissolve this almost entirely. Allowing 
 this soil now a few days to dry, on ploughing it up 
 he « ill find it just as mellow as it was befoi-e. Has 
 a new volume of carbonic acid been extricated alrea- 
 dy ? If so, pray how long is the 17 per cent, of or- 
 ganic matter in a fertile soil to last? No, Mr. Browne 
 has certainly been rather too hasty in the publica- 
 tion of his theory. The man who vauntingly saye of 
 one writer -"the idea suggests itself to my mind that 
 he was only following in the footsteps of si.-rae illus- 
 trious predecessor who' wrote it down because he 
 thought it should be;" and of another, "The theo- 
 ry, however, as there laid down, is so incomplete in 

its details, as not to furnish to the reader sufficient 
 ground either to adopt or repudiate it," cannot be 
 too guarded when he advances dogmas of his own 
 creating, lest he fall into the same error he attempts 
 to correct in others. J. H. B.

The Strawberry Q,ustion.

To THE Editors of the Farm Journal: — I have 
 just perused in your April number, an article sign- 
 ed "Thomas Meehan," which it appears had been 
 addressed to the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society. 
 The public have become wearied with talk con- 
 corning the Strawberry, based in error, and calcula- 
 ted only to mislead. Mr. M. states that some plants 
 of Hovey's Seedling, which is a pistillate, "became 
 staminate by being forced slowly in a moderate tem- 
 perature," but he does not tell us that such plants 
 produced fruit; and if they did so, whether it was 
 jwoduced loitlwut the possible connection of some oilier 
 variety naturally staminate. It is well known that 
 Hovey's Seedling and many other pistillatcs have 
 abortive stamens, which can be more fully develop- 
 ed by position and special culture ; but this creates 
 no surprise, when even man himself is abortively 
 mammiform. The real question to be solved is this^ 
 Does the Pistillate Strawberry plant, which by itself 
 is barren, change its sexuality by the culture re- 
 ferred to, and produce fruit? Is there any man bold 
 enough to make such an assertion, and if so, let him 
 furnish us with conclusive proof. I declare it to be ut- 
 terly impossible, and that if ten acres were covered 
 with forcing houses, and all were filled with plants of 
 Hovey's Seedling, there would never be one perfect 
 berry produced to the end of time. I base this as- 
 sertion, first, on the immutable law of nature, whose 
 eternal impress is stamped on every object of cre- 
 ation, and especially on the sexuality of animals and 
 plants, and yj'Oift which there never has been, and nev- 
 er can be any deviation; and secondly, on my own 
 long experience, and that of every truly scientific co- 
 laborer. The statement, therefore, in the article re- 
 fered to, so far a? asserti-ng "the distinction between 
 Pistillatcs and Staminates to be worthless: cultivation 
 producing either the one or the other," is not only 
 utterly erroneous, but is calculated to excite ridicule 
 in every scientific mind, and is to be classed with 
 the silly prejudices about planting pumpkin seeds at 
 the increase of the moon, and the puerile notions 
 about sixteen year locusts. 

The characters of the three natural varieties of 
 the Strawberry, Staminate, Hermaphrodite, and Pis- 
 tillate, are permanent, and therefore no change can 
 possible take place. I sliall discuss this subject fully 
 in the Horticulturist, the commencement of which 
 will be found in the 'April number.
