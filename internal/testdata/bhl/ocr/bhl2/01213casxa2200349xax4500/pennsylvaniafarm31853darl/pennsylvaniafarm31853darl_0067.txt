If it were possible that tlie transposition of sexes 
 in the strawberry could be accomplished in the man- 
 ner referred to, it would equally apply to all other 
 plants, and to all animals; and it would be no longer 
 necessary to possess but one sex of horses, cattle, or 
 fowls. For, be it remembered, the same eternal and 
 immutable law applie to the humblest plant, and 
 to the minutest insect, that applies to the mightiest 
 trees and animals of our globe.

For the Farm Jounuil. 
 Analysis of Soils and Professor Mapes. 

Messrs. Editors: — 

I have ever considered it a 
 misuse of the pages of a journal to occupy its space 
 with personal contentions, and do not intend to be 
 diverted from the task I have undertaken, by false 
 issues, or personal attacks. Any arguments that can 
 be adduced to bear on the subjects under discussion, 
 I am willing to notice; but it would be but waste o' 
 your time to read a joiirnal made up of discussions 
 of the former character. Any gentleman desiring to 
 communicate with me on such subjects, can save the 
 agricultural reader much misspent time, by addres- 
 sing me through the post office. 

In an essay lately published in this journal, I inci- 
 dentally mentioned a subject which it seems has given 
 offence to Professor Mapes. The subject merely so 
 touched upon, is one which merits more attention 
 than a passing notice. 

It is a matter of much interest to the farming com" 
 munity, to know whether any practical good can re- 
 sult from the possession of an analysis of a sample 
 of soil taken from the farm; and whether any consultr 
 ing Agriculturalist, from an inspection of such analy- 
 sis, is enabled to write letters of advice calculated to 
 bring great returns to the farmer. If such stupen- 
 dous benefits as are contended for by some gentlemen, 
 can accrue; then advantages like these should no lon- 
 ger be neglected by the readers of the Farm Journal, 
 if otherwise, they should not expend their hard earn" 
 ings in such fancy trimmings. 

A proposition is now, or has lately been before our 
 Legislature, to appoint a State Agi-ioultural Chemist, 
 and the propriety or impropriety of such appoint- 
 ment is a matter of great moment to the farmers of 
 this State. I for one give my voice for the appoint- 
 ment of such officer by the State. I will give you my 
 reasons for so doing. I am of the opinion that it can 
 be of no practical use, for each farmer to know the 
 exact quantative analysis of his soil; but I believe 
 that great public benefit will ensue from the well-con- 
 ducted labors of a competent person paid by the 
 State. The duty of such officer would be to examine 
 the several varieties of soil found in the State, and 
 in a publication of these examinations, lay down the 

general treatment each variety should receive.acoord- 
 ing to the best information in his power to obtain. 

I am fully persuade 1 that the plan adopted by pri- 
 vate enterprise, is a great burthen to the commuuitj 
 of farmers, and that they reap no adequate return. 

Le^ us see how the matter is done in New Jersey ? 
 We are told by Professor Mapes, (March 1853, p. 1) 
 "The whole receipts of the Working Farmer will be 
 expended upon it. Any advantage we may derive 
 by its circulation, is but incidental to our pursuit of 
 a consulting agriculturalist." 

(April 1853, p. I) The same gentleman tells us 
 that ho employs under him. Dr. Charles Enderlin,Dr, 
 Antizell, Dr. James Chilton, and others; that Dr. 
 Antizell has analyzed sixty soils for him in the last 
 two months, and that some of those gentlemen havt 
 one hundred going on at a time. 

This is a grievous and unnecessary expense, for 
 the obvious reason that there is no use in more than 
 one analysis of any vein of soil running through any 
 section of country. No man who presents his sample 
 of soil to be analyzed, can say that it represents the 
 average of his own land, any better than it does that 
 of his neighbor living on the same vein of soil. If 
 this were not the case it would be singular, indeed, 
 for the sample was, no doubt, not taken from all over 
 his own farm, but from a selected spot. I hear some 
 one say — but he may have manured more or loss than 
 his neighbor. This appears, at first sight, formidable 
 indeed: but vanishes on examination. Constant 
 cropping for many years by the one, without any 
 manure, and new land might differ some, even per- 
 ceptibly; but the difference in the farming of two 
 neighbors would not be appreciated in analysis. 

In order to lead to a better understanding of this 
 matter, let us transcribe three of these analysis from 
 the pages of Prof. Mapes' Journal. (March 1852, 
 page 2.)
