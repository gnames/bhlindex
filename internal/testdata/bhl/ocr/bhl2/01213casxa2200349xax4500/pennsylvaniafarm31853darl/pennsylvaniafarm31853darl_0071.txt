Norman Horse — Duke of Normaiidj. 

[inported from Havre, by Mr. Samuel Holman, of 
 Chester Coaiitij, Ti., in th: Siimm:r of 1851. 

We believe this is the seeoud importatijii of Nar- 
 mau Horses iuto the United States, — Diligence, im- 
 liorted by Edward Harris, Esq., of Moorestowa, New 
 Jersey, bgiaj; the first, from whom the Norman stock 
 in several of thB States are descended. 

The "Dake of Normmly" was seleijted in France, 
 by Mr. Holman himself, having gone expressly for 
 that purpose, and as will be seen by the annexed cer- 
 tllicatea, he has succeeded in procuring a vary supe- 
 rior animal, -^ hose purity of blood, and character are 
 unexceptionable. 

The imp,irtation will be a valuable one to the far- 
 ming community, affording anopportuity to combine 
 just the requisites wanted in the horse of all work, of 
 the American farmers, great strength, endurance and 
 hardiness with iinick draught. The Norman stock of 
 horses have been kept distinct for age3,and are traced 
 back as far as William the conqueror. They are 
 the origin of what is known here as the French Ca- 
 nadian; show a g-eat developement of muscular dow- 
 er, and it is generally conceded that no stock of 
 horses, of the same weight, either in Europe or 
 America, oan perform the same heavy, fad labor. 

"They have derived the name of Diligences, from the 
 fact that they are almost exclusively driven to their 
 coaches, or wagons, as they would be called here, 
 weighing thirty to forty hundred pounds, without pas- 
 sengers, and making with them a speed often to twelve 
 miles an hour." The color of the Norman horse is 
 generally gray, varying- somewhat in shade; height 
 from fourteen and a half to sixteen hands high; 
 weight thirteen to sixteen hundred piunds. 

The Duke of Normandy is now four and half years 
 old, fiftee n hands three inches high, will grow to six- 
 teen. His weight is fifteen hundred pounds. 

Mr. Harris who passed through France in 185 1-, 
 speaks of "the fine condition in which these horses are 
 always kept.in spite of hard driving.and worse groom- 
 ing, the great age they sometimes attain, and the . 
 rarity of spavins, wind-galls, or other blemishes of 
 the limba." 

The address of Mr. Holman, is Chester Springs, 
 Chester county, Pa. 

certificates: 
 I do hereby certify that the two Diligence Colts, 
 sold to Mr. Samuel Holman of the United States of 
 America, were bred and raised by me, that they are 
 from my best brood Mares. The stock is pure, and I 
 consider them as fine as any I ever bred, and I doubt 
 whether a better pair of Colts can be found in Nor- 
 \ mandy.
