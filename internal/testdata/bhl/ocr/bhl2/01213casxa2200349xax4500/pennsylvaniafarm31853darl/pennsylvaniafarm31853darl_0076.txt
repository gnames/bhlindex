WORK FOR THE MONTH. 

[Mat, 

■when pasture is short, we have found this crop, cut 
 in a green state, and fed to cows, to greatly increase 
 the yield of milk and butter. 

Avoid turning stock too soon to pasture field3_ 
 Sow one bushel of Plaster to ihe acre on all grass 
 fields. Inspect fences all around the farm, and make 
 them secure against the stock. Clean out and white- 
 wash collars, remove potatoes to barn floor, or other 
 dry place, to retard their^prouting. 

Cover manure in barn-yard, from action of sun 
 and rains, or compost it with alternate layers of soil 
 if not ali-eady done. "Watch the stock on rank pas- 
 ture, every morning, to guard against Hoven, which 
 may he quickly relieved by hay rope, drawn tightly 
 in the. mouth, and extending back of the horns. The 
 motion of the jaws, thus produced, liberates the gas 
 in the stomach. 

Fruit Orch.ikd. — Finish planting Fruit Trees, 
 Strawberries, Raspberries, Grape Vines, &o., as soon 
 as p.ossible. Wash the bark of newly planted trees 
 with mixtures, before recommended, to prevent their 
 becoming bark bound. 

Trees in blossom against walls or trellises, should 
 be protected against late frosts, by covering with 
 sheets, or shading with evergreen boughs, to keep 
 off the sun's rays. Destroy webs and larvaj of in- 
 sects. Mulch the ground under goosbemes,wilh coarse 
 hay or litter, and sprinkle salt. Mulch Raspberries 
 and Strawberries with spent tan bark. Shorten in 
 Raspberry canes one-third, and dig in manure. — 
 Apply salt to Quince Trees. 

Caterpillers may bo found close to body and limbs 
 of trees, morning and evening, and before dew is off 
 in morning, may readily be destroyed, with a brush 
 or swab affixed to a pole. 

Pyramidal Trees should be headed back, and use- 
 less shoots pruned away. 

Renew with fresh manuring Grapevine borders. 

Destroy ants with boiling water, poured into their 
 holes. 

Vegetable Garden. — Plant and sow such seeds as 
 were omitted last month. Thin out early plantings 
 of Beets, Carrots, Parsnips, Salsify, &c., and trans- 
 plant from frames and warm borders, Tomatoes, 
 Egg Plants, Pepper, Lettuce. Those tender of frost 
 should be reserved till last of month. Sow Peas for 
 succession crops at least twice in this month. Plant 
 brush and pole Beans, the latter should have the 
 poles set in first, and the beans planted around them. 
 The ground being cleared of early crops of Radishes, 
 Spinach, <&o., should be prepared for Beets, Carrots 
 and Cabbages. Keep the ground free from weeds, 
 and stir frequently with hoe. Fine pulverization and 
 frequent stiring of soil are indispensable to good gar- 
 dening. 

Plant Cucumbers, Melons and Squashes in open 
 ground towards last of month. 

Sow a few Turnips for early crop, so as to get them 
 of good size before heat of summer. 

Draw earth up to stems of Cauliflowers, and water 
 in dry weather. 

Finish sowing seed of all kinds of pot and medici- 
 nal herbs. Sprinkle tobacco dust, unbleached ash- 
 es, or quick lime, every morning on such plants as 
 are being injured by insects, till they are destroyed. 

Flower Gardex. — All such work as digging flow- 
 er garden, laying sod, planting Bos edging, &c., 
 should be concluded the early part of this month. — 
 Grass plots will soon require mowing, which should 
 lie evenly and neatly done^ at least once a month, 
 from May till October. A well kept Lawn is a great 
 ornament. Nothing but considerable practice will 
 enable one to mow short grass as it should be. 

Continue to plant flower seeds according to the 
 directions given last month. Annuals that have 
 been forwarded under frames, should have air admit- 
 ted to them freely, and after the middle of the month 
 finally transplanted to where they are to bloom. — 
 Roses that have been kept under glass, may now be 
 planted out; also. Petunias, Verbenas, Salvias, Heli- 
 otrope, Scarlet Geraniums. Plant Dahlia roots, but 
 those which have been grown under glass, should 
 not be set out till the latter part of the month. Plant 
 Tuberoses, Gladiolus and Tiger flower roots. 

Plants that have been wintered in cellars, should 
 bo brought out now. If they require re-pottiag, do 
 it immediately. If the pots or tubs are as large as 
 desired, take the plants out and reduce the roots 
 considerably, and shake the old soil well out of 
 them, re-pot with good fresh soil. Oleanders, Pom- 
 egranates and Myrtles do well if planted out in good 
 rich ground to bo taken up in the fall. 

Pennsylvania Horticultural Society. 

The stated meeting of this society was held on Tues- 
 day evening, April 19th, in the Chinese Saloon, Dr. 
 W. D. Brinkle, Vice President, in the chair. The 
 display was unusually rich, and the Hall crowded 
 with gratified visitors. The extensive tables of the 
 society were completely covered with the many 
 beautiful objects of exhibition. The imposing show 
 of blooming plants was contributed from more than 
 a dozen green houses, and presented one of the finest 
 ever seen at a monthly meeting. Robert Buist's fore- 
 man brouglit a great number of interesting and rare 
 specimens, several of which were new and shown 
 for the first time. Rhododendron Javanicum, a beau- 
 tiful species, with flowers of an orange hue ; Oastro- 
 lohiiiin Dnimmondii, Dendrohium Blandifoi-dianum. 
 Zii'i-ia tyijhliafa, Tetranlhra Hi-nijdU, and Ceanolhus 
 riijidum. Of Standard plants, were a splendid spe- 
 cimen of Pimelia speitabilis, measuring twelve feet 
 in circumference, and four feet high, displaying hun- 
 dreds of trusses of flowers, a large and graceful Ac- 
 acia pitbescens, a very fine cuphca platycentva, a hand- 
 some SpicKra Seevsii, and a dozen of the choicest Cin- 
 erarias of merit; and the new and beautiful seedling 
 Camellia of N J. Becar, of New York, called "Dow- 
 ning." The worthy proprietor of this plant proposes 
 to dispose of the stock by subscription, at $10 for
