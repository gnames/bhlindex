Prizp Essay ou the Productiou of Butter, 
 Read before the Royal Agricultural Society 
 OF England. 
 We lately extracted from the Quarterly -Journal 
 of the above society, for the Farm Journal, a prize 
 essay on the abortion of cows, which excited very 
 considerable attention, particularly with that por- 
 tion of our readers, extensively engaged as dairy- 
 men. Extra copies of the Journal containing it 
 were called for, and which thus contributed to its 
 extensive circulation. Wo commence in the present 
 number, from the same source, a prize essay on but- 
 ter, which will be read with equal interest, as it em- 
 bodies a series of accurate and valuable experiments, 
 first as to the chemical constituents of milk, the 
 changes in its composition and the amount, accor- 
 ding to exercise and food, the general management 
 of milk and cream in the best dairy districts of 

England, the comparative quantity of Butter yield- 
 ed by sweet cream churned alone, of sweet milk 
 and its cream churned together, sour cream churned 
 alone, sour milk and cream churned together, scald- 
 ed or Devonshire cream churned alone, the proper 
 temperature of cream, &c., and many other details 
 of much importance to the dairyman. The essay 
 will be concluded in another number. 

The time has gone by, when the relations of sci- 
 ence to, and influence upon agriculture in its broad- 
 est features, or most minute practical details, can be 
 disregarded. The practical farmer owes a heavy 
 debt of gratitude to the scientific investigator, whose 
 labors and researches fully equal to those of the 
 field, has made system out of chaos, has shown him 
 the great"^round work of all successful husbandry, 
 and has explained the secret princijjles and the true 
 causes of results, successful or otherwise, of even the 
 most trifling apparently, and minute of the dai- 
 ly operations of the farm. Every successful farmer, 
 whether conscious of it or not, who rears a fine ani- 
 mal, or grows a large crop, but proves the truth of 
 scientific knowledge, but elicits a confirmation of the 
 necessary connection between sound theory and suc- 
 cessful practice. So far from there being any natural 
 antagonism between these, their mutual dependence 
 and close union is as unavoidable in point of fact 
 as the reciprocal benefit is beautiful. The farmer, 
 taking his isolated case of successful culture, gener- 
 alises up to the cause, which science unfolds to him 
 among her immutable laws, which, when thus under- 
 stood, regulate his -future practice. His scientific co- 
 laborer, on the other hand, first lays down his broad 
 pnViC('j)fes,hisrules for action and upon them, bases and 
 pr^cs his operations, as a test of their truth. These 
 follow necessarily as efi'ects follow causes, and thus 
 science and practice go hand in hand. 

In England, owing to a- denser population, requir- 
 ing absolutely less imperfect and wasteful culture, 
 and to a greater concentration of wealth than in the 
 United States, experiments in every department of 
 agriculture, are couduoted with a minuteness and
