The animal received nothing to eat during the 
 night, consequently the milk of the morning must 
 have been derived from the previous day's food. —

2d day. The object of this day's experiment was 
 to discover whether an increase of butter would be 
 procured by feeding the cow with after-grass in the 
 stall. It refused, however, to eat this food, and be- 
 ing from its companion, struggled for several hours 
 to regain its liberty; to render it tranquil, a com- 
 panion was introduced to the same stall, and it was 
 then induced to consume 28 lbs. of good hay, and 2 J 
 lbs. of oat-meal. The milk of the evening mrasurod

Dumas, in an announcement to the French Acad- 
 emy, advanced the theoiy that the fat of animals is 
 wholly derived from the fatty matter contained in 
 their food. As the theory of the formation of fat 
 is of the first importance in dairy-farming, Dr. Play- 
 fair makes the iollowing just observations with ref- 
 erence to the preceding experiments: — 

1. On the second day the cow received 28 lbs. of 
 hay, which contained 0.46 lb.s. of fat, and 2^ lbs. of 
 oat-meal, containing 0.050 lbs. of the same constit- 
 uent. The cow produced (calculating according to 
 its specific gravity) about 19 lbs. of milk, in which 
 were 0.969 lbs. of butter. But the food altogether 
 contained only (I. 486 lbs. of fat, so that 0.483 lbs. 
 of butter must have been produced from other sour- 
 ces. 

2. The food received by the cow on the 3d daj- con- 
 sisted of 28 lbs. of hay,^2J pounds of oat-meal, and; 
 8 lbs. of bean-flour. 

28 lbs. of hay contain 0.436 lbs. of fat.

 The milk of the evening amounted to 10.34 lbs. and 
 contained 0.4 lbs. of butter; that of the morning to
