axils of the leaves. Their growth is accelerated by 
 the placing of pieces of peat around the stem. 

By SCALES, from the outside of the bulb, potted 
 in the peat and sand, and subjected to a slight 
 heat; these do not vegetate rapidly, but eventually 
 make g Hid bulbs, and those scales maybe divided 
 longitudinally into two or three parts with the knife, 
 each one of which will form at the bottom a new 
 plant. 

Hardiness and Adaptation to the Open Ground. 
 That the Japan Lilies and their offspring, may be- 
 come tenants of our gardens, and sufficiently hardy 
 to endure our climate, is much to be desired. The 
 scarcity and high price of these have, until recent- 
 ly, been a hindrance to much experience in this re- 
 spect. I can, however, state some facts, which give 
 great reason to expect that they or their hybrids will 
 prove so. Soon after the introduction of the L. spe- 
 ciosmn, a bulb stood the winter perfectly well, pro- 
 tected only by a pot, in the garden of a gentleman in 
 this city — and I learn that one of the same sort has, 
 for two or three years, remained uninjured in a gar- 
 den in the city of Now York. My own experience 
 is quite encouraging. Eighteen bulbs were planted 
 in the open ground last November, in a bed of Tree 
 PoBonias, between the rows; these were covered with 
 four inches of peat, and when the ground closed up, 
 about thj same depth of sea- weed was added to the 
 covering; every bulb is alive, and now making vig- 
 orous growth. It is sufficiently evident, that if the 
 Japan Lilies prove hai-dy; their culture in the open 
 grounil, and in a deep rich border, will be of the 
 easiest description.— [M. P. Wilder. 

teft Handed Plough. 

Mr. Editor: — As the' time will soon be here 
 when the farmers will begin to look about for 
 Ploughs, I would ask permission to make a few re- 
 marks upon the kind to be used. In my wander- 
 ings through suokordom I have made some little ob- 
 servation. When in a neighborhood of real go-a- 
 head enterprising farmers, (those who have thrown 
 the stono out of the bag,) I see mostly used the left 
 handed plough for breaking. Where there are good 
 barns, neat dwellings, finfe stock and large meadows, 
 I see the left handed plough. Well, says one, where 
 is the great advantage of the left handed plough ? 
 Well, in the first place, the same team will break 
 more ground, and do it better, than with the right 
 handed plough ; how is this? your lead horse walks in 
 the furrow, while your off horse walks on the hard 
 ground, consequently your plough always cuts the 
 same width of furrow; whereas with the right hand- 
 ed plough your lead horse walks near the furrow, 
 and the nearer the furrow he walks, the less the 
 plow cuts, and when the ground is very hard, he is 
 sure to step into the furrow, (for some horses have 
 more sense than some folks,) in so doing he pushes 
 the off horse on the ploughed ground, and thus 
 throws the plough entirely out, consequently the 
 the land is as full of gouts, as badly spun yarn, 
 and in finishing aland the team has to be turned 
 several times at different places, or go over the same 
 ground several different times. All these difficul- 
 ties are .avoided in the left handed plough. With 
 your lead, or near horse, in the furrow, and the off 
 horse held to his place by a jockey stick, extending 
 from the leader's breast to his bit, let the plough- 
 m.m be ever so careless, the plow continues ti^o its 
 work with uniformity. Another consideration of im- 
 portance, almost any horse cau^be taught to go by 

the single lino. When a field is broke as it should 
 be, the dirt is thrown from the fence, whereas with 
 the right handed plough, it is thrown to the fence, so 
 there is left a ridge six or eight inches high all round 
 the field, first by being thrown there in breaking, ' 
 and secondly by cleaning the ploughs in cultivation.

New Poultry Book. 
 A new work on Poultry, to be issued in numbers, 
 has lately appeared in England, as we notice by a 
 review of the first two numbers, in the Gardeners' 
 Chronicle. It is splendidly illustrated with colored 
 plates, elegant enough for the drawing-room table," 
 and the the first chaper is occupied with the history 
 of the Shanghai or Cochin China, with very detailed 
 definitions and descriptions of true specimens. For 
 the information of our friends, interested' in breed- 
 ing Poultry, we quote the following remarks of the 
 reviewer. It would appear "that the long, double 
 ear lobe, immediately below the deaf ear," is one of 
 the most important points of a genuine Shanghai, 
 and that the tails are to be curtailed, if not absolute- 
 ly dispensed with. 

"As regards some of the details to which it refers 
 we may mention that from 8 to 10 lbs. each should 
 have lieen stated as the extreme, not as the ordina- 
 ry weight of Cochin China hccs. We do not believe 
 it is the average of any yard in England, and it is 
 far beyond any except where the birds are wrongly 
 fed, and the bad practice of giving meat and liver 
 is adopted. The adoption of weight as the true cri- 
 terion of merit has caused much evil, and wo cannot 
 for a moment agvee with the idea, that any standard 
 of weight should be erected, according to the quota- 
 tion in Mr. Sturgeon's letters. To ensure weight, 
 unnatural feeding is resorted to, and birds, properly 
 granivorous, become carnivorous in their habits ; 
 hence, a disease of internal fat, which has lately 
 carried oft' many of the best birds in England, and 
 is far more fatal than (if it is not often the cause of) 
 what is called the Exhibition Fever. Weight can 
 never te a criterion unless allied to every other point 
 of excellence; if it once becomes the main point, 
 then feeding for three weeks prior to the exhibition 
 will always attain it, to the destruction of the bird, 
 and the loss of the unlucky weight who may put- 
 chase. There is an important omission in the char- 
 acteristics of 'he Shanghai hen: the long double ear- 
 lobe immediately below the deaf-ear has escaped no- 
 tice. The tail question in the cocks is hardly fairly 
 treated, it is true "no tail at all'' has been asked for, 
 and is still a desideratum. Probably Mr. Andrews, 
 of Dorchester, has come nearer to it than any one 
 else. We do not like either sickle or scimitar feath- 
 ers. All birds honestly exhibited have two long 
 feathers in the middle of the tail, but they should 
 be reversed and lie flat, i-olling over like those of an 
 ostrich. It will not, we think, be denied that the 
 exuberance of tail is a mark of coarseness, and of- 
 ten of degeneracy; and as it is undeniable tails have 
 been trimmed for exhibition, it should be the aim of 
 a writer to destroy every possible excuse for such 
 practices. — [London Gardeners' Chronicle.
