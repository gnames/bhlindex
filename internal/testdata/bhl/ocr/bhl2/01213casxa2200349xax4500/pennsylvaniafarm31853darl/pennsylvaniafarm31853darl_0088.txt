Ayrshire Bull, Dundee the Secoud. 

The Property of E. P. Prentice, Mount Hope, near 
 Albany. 

We ai-e indebted to E. P. Prentice, Mount Hope, 
 near Alban j, for the oposite engraving of liis Ayr- 
 shire Bull, Dundee Second, winner of the first prize 
 in 1851, at Rochester, as a one year old.. The en- 
 graving was taken a few months afterwards, and as 
 E. P. Prentice writes us, "hardly does him justice." 
 His sire was "Dandy," imported by Samuel G. Ward, 
 Lenox, Mass., and his dam the imported cow Ayr., 
 so that his blood is pure on both sides. We are in- 
 formed the progeny from "Dandy" have proved to be 
 superior milkers, and we should expect that of the 
 Bull before us, from his pedigree, to fully represent 
 the chai-acter of the Ayrshire breed in this respect- 
 It is a great question, yet unsettled,and deserving the 
 especial notice of our agricultural societies, which is 
 the best breed of eows for the dairy. The individu" 
 al excellencies of an animal, no matter how great 
 her yield, are of not so much importance, as which 
 is the best breed, or which most generally and inva- 
 riably produces the most milk and butter. This is 
 an interesting question, about which there is much 
 variety of opinion. We see and hear occasionally 
 of individual animals producing a very large yield, 
 and which is adduced in proof that the Durham, De- 
 von, Alderney or Ayrshire, as the case may happen, 
 are the most profitable for the Dairyman. Such in- 
 stances do not prove much, but leave the question 
 still an open one, to be settled by long continued ob- 
 servation and experiments, and we suggest that our 
 State agricultural societies should appoint a standing 
 committee, to institute experiments and collect facts, 
 tending to show in an impartiaj report, wliich of all 
 our improved breeds of cows, is the best for the Pail. 
 If the milking property has h&aom.Q fixed in any one 
 breed, and is something more than merely an acci- 
 dental property it ought to be known. The yield 
 for the whole year should be taken into the account ; 
 the pasture, feed, and other circumstances properly 
 weighed and considered. A cow giving twenty to 
 thirty quarts for a few weeks, and then going dry, 
 would not be so profitable, as a smaller yield, contin- 
 ued through the season. 

It is contended by the advocates of the Ayrshires, 
 that more inoariably than any other breed, are they 
 good milkers. Alton, in his agriculture of Ayr, 
 Scotland, says, "the Ayrshire is the most improved 
 breed of cattle to be found on the Isl.and, not only 
 for the dairy, in which they have no parallel, under 
 a similar soil, climate, and relative circumstances, 
 but also in feeding for the shambles. They are in 
 fact a breed of cows, that have by crossing, coupling, 
 feeding and treatment, been improved and brought 
 to a state of perfection, which fits them above all 
 others yet known, to answer in almost every diversi- 
 ty of situation, where grain and grasses can be rais- 

ed to feed them, for the purposes of the dairy, or for 
 fattening them for beef." 

This is strong praise, and which we should be glad" 
 to hear that experience with them in the United 
 States, would sustain. Professor Low, in 1841, 
 says of them, "that they had spread over a large 
 tract of country, and by continued mixture with 
 one another, acquired such a community of charac- 
 ters, as to form a distinct and well defined breed." 
 The origin of the Ayrshires is in some doubt, but it 
 is generally supposed to have resulted from a cross 
 of the native stock, with the Alderneys, and perhaps 
 the Short-Horns. 

Col. Le Conteur in his paper, on the Alderney 
 cow, says "he has noticed Ayrshire cows that seem 
 to be of Jersey or Alderney origin." 

Stephens, in his book of the Farm, remarks, "they 
 are in such high repute for milking qualities, that 
 most of the nobility throughout the kingdom are fur- 
 nished with them." 

The information that we have as to their milking 
 qualities in the United States, would seem to con- 
 firm their reputation in Great Britain, but is as yet 
 too imperfect to settle the question, that they are the 
 niilkiny breed. Ayr, the dam of Dundee Second, has 
 given on grass feed only, twenty quarts of milk a day, 
 and continues in milk till near calving. One of the 
 Ayrshires imported by the Massachusetts agricultu- 
 ral society, produced sixteen lbs. of butter per week 
 on grass feed. 

Colman, in one of his reports on the Agricul- 
 ture of Massachusetts, speaks of an an account be- 
 ing kept for several months in succession, of the 
 milk given by four Ayrshire cows. One of them, 
 whose account was carried through the year, yielded 
 3,864 quarts of milk, beer measure. 

On the whole, we know enough of the Ayrshires, 
 to make us anxious to know a good deal more, and 
 shall be obliged by any information from those who 
 have had experience with them. 

We have by us, an engraving of "Ayr," the moth- 
 er of Dundee Second, also furnished us by E. P. 
 Prentice, and which we shall insert in the nest num- 
 ber of the Farm Journal. 

Deodar Cedar. 

When, at the instance of the late Lord Auckland, 
 at that time Governor-General of India, the Court of 
 Directors ordered a large quantity of seed of the De- 
 odar to be imported annually for distribution, here, 
 a service was rendered to the United Kingdom the 
 extent of which cannot, as yet, be estimated. Enough, 
 however, has been seen to asssure us that we have ac- 
 quired in some abundance an everegreen tree of 
 singular beauty, perfectly hardy in these latitudes, 
 and so unlike any other coniferous plant in its man- 
 ner of growth as to add a new feature to the rich 
 vegetation of those islands. 

We now learn with great satisfaction that the East 
 India Company has ordered a ton weight of the seed 
 of -this tree to bo placed at the disposal of Govern-
