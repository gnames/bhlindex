ground, in vows, and about eighteen inches equal 
 distances from each other, the trenches occupj'ing 
 spaces between every other pair of rows. The sets 
 are to be purchased from old Osier-grounds, at the 
 rate oi 10s. per 1000, and about 12,000 are required 
 to plant one acre. Great care should bo taken to 
 procure valuable sorts, as there are more than twen- 
 ty difterent varieties of Osier, and these are also of 
 varying quality. Several kinds may be grown upon 
 the same ground. The stems must be l^ft for two 
 years to strengthen, and in the third autumn the 
 Osiers may be cut. Tlie cutting then comes annual- 
 ly, the flexible shoots being commonly from sis to 
 eight feet long. The only management the land re- 
 quires is the chopping down and clearance of weeds 
 once a year. If sold "green," the crops may either 
 be disposed ot by the acre or by the bunch. The 
 Osiers, when cut, are tightly tied up in bundles, with 
 an "ell-band," the bundles measuring 42 inches round 
 at the distance of one foot from their thick end; and 
 these bunches are commonly sold for lOd. oris. each. 
 Osier-grounds have been known to produce a crop of 
 300 bunches per acre, which would amount in value 
 to 12£. or 15£.; but a good yield may be reckoned 
 worth 5£. or (j£. per aore,and an inferior quality often 
 diminishes the return to less than half this sum. The 
 main expense is the cost of the land; the cutting, &o., 
 amount to but a trifling sum. Extensive growers 
 do not generally sell their Osiers "green," but pre- 
 pare and send them to market "white." The pro- 
 cess consisting in setting up the Osiers immedi- 
 ately alter cutting, with their thick ends a few inch- 
 es deep in water — lotting them remain until the sap 
 ascends freely — and then peeling ofi' the bark with 
 an iustrnment for the purpose. They are thou dried 
 and sold by the ton weight.

7.3 Varieties, by William B. Prince, Flushing, K. T 

[Continued from last number of Farm Journal.] 
 30. Ahijssinian Prince. — One of Dr. Brinckle's seed- 
 lings, of medium size, conical form, and dark crim- 
 son color, productive, p. 

31. Methven Scarlet, or Victoria, — Very large,roun- 
 dish. depressed, dark scarlet, showy, coarse, very pro- 
 ductive, profialjle for market, p. 

32. Hudson. — This ancient and very distinct va- 
 riety is identical with the ^'Hudson of Cincinnati." 
 The fruit is of largo size, pointed conical form, dark 
 scarlet or crimson when fully ripe, and is then of ex- 
 cellent flavor. The berries redden some days before 
 maturity, and are in consequence often plucked pre- 
 maturely, and the fruit from this circumstance has 
 been deemed inferior in sweetness and quality. The 
 berries have the peculiarity of remaining green at 
 the extreme point until they attain perfect maturity, 
 when that becomes red also. This is one of the few 
 varieties of which we possess plants of both sexes, 
 and they have been grown jointly at these nurseries 
 for more than forty years. It appears that at Phila- 
 delphia they possessed only the pistillate \ar\etj, and 
 that it alone was transmitted to Cincinnati many 
 years since, which serves to account lor all the Ohio 
 plants being of that sex. It is highly productive, 
 aud perhaps none other will yield a larger crop, but 
 it is indispensable that its own male, or some other, 
 should bo connected as fertilizer. It is entirely dis- 
 tinct from the "Hudson's Bay," of the London Hor- 
 ticultural .Society, which is one of the Scarlcts,\\heie- 
 as this is of the Pine family. In my investigations 
 I have found it to be identical with a variety called 

"Mulberry," and it may be identical with the variety 
 so named in the Catalogue of the London Horticul- 
 tural Society. About thirty-five years ago it was 
 generally called "Ped Chili," and I think it was im- 
 ported from England by my father, the late William 
 Prince, under that name, but he finding it distinct 
 from the Chili family, changed that name to the 
 present one. n andp. 

33. Burr's New Pine. — Medium size, light searlety 
 handsome, high, spicy flavor, not a full bearer, and 
 the plant less vigorous than many other varieties, p. 

34. Bnr7-'s Scarlet Melting. — Ratlier large, round- 
 ed or short cone, scarlet showy, moderate flavor, rath- 
 er soft for market, ripens early, very productive, the 
 most valuable of Burr's varieties. P. 

35. Rival Hudson (Burr's.) — Rather large, coni- 
 cal, dark scarlet, showy, medium quality, acid, good 
 for preserves, very productive, v. 

_ 36. Columbus (Burr's.) — Large, dark scarlet, infe- 
 rior flavor, very productive, p. 

The four proceeding varieties were originated by 
 Mr. John Burr, of Columbus, Ohio. 

*37. Serena. — Rather large, light scarlet, fine fla- 
 vor, productive. 

38. loiva. — Large,broad rounded, light orange scar- 
 let, peculiar color, beautiful, early, productive, infe- 
 rior flavor, but merits culture for its other qualities. 
 It is one of a distinct family or species, natives of 
 our western prairies. 

39. Jenney's Seedling. — Large, rounded or obvate, 
 crimson, too acid until fully ripe, then of good fla- 
 vor, very productive. It has been much overrated, 
 when there are so many others preferable to it. p. 

40. Lizzie Pandolph. — A seedling originated by 
 Dr. Bringkle, of Philadelphia; the fruit round, av- 
 eraging larger than Hovey's Seedling, but inferior to 
 that in flavor, very productive, a showy fruit of little 
 value, p. 

41. Oenesee. — Rather large, with a neck, bright 
 crimson, showy, moderate flavor, fruit on long stems, 
 productive, growth vigorous. 

42. — Monroe Scarlet. — Large, roundish, light scar- 
 let, good flavor, very productive, estimable, p. 

43. Climax Scarlet. — Medium size, conical, light 
 scarlet, good flavor, rather acid. r. 

44. Orange Prolijic. — Large, rounded, orange,scar- 
 let, rather acid, very productive, late. p. 

45. Scarlet Cone. — Rather large, conical, bright 
 scarlet, productive. 

The five preceding varieties were originated by 
 Messrs. Elwanger & Barry, of Rochester. 

46. McAcoy's Superior. — Of vigorous growth, fruit 
 very large, rounded, dark crimson, juicy, very good 
 flavor, fine color, very productive, p. 

47. McAroy's Pistillate, Ko. 1. — A seedling from 
 the loioa, and bears much affinity to its parent in 
 color and size; large, bright scarlet, very handsome, 
 productive, but not highly flavored, p. 

48. McAwys Extra Pcd. — Largo, beautiful, pro- 
 ductive, moderate flavor and medium quality, p. 

49. Schneicke's Hermaphrodite, or Longworth's Pro- 
 lijic. — Fair size, rounded, scarlet, sweet, very fine 
 flavor, productive, of vigorous growth. 

50. Schneicke's Pistillate. — Large, rounded, crim- 
 son, very juicy and good, but njt ec^ual to McAvoy's 
 Superior, p. 

51. Moyamensing Pine. — Secondary size, conical, 
 crimson, juicy, not sweet, and but little flavor, strong 
 fruit stems, ripens gradually, very productive. It 
 is of vigorous growth, and assimilates greatly to the 
 old Hudson, of which it is doubtless a seedling, p.
