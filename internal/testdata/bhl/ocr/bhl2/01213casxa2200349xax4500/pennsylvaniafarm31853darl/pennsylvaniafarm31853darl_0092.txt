fall, leaving the place whore the roots start out, ex- 
 posed through the winter. In the spring, fill in 
 around each tree, half peck of air slacked lime, or 
 wood aahes, and if the earth is heaped up on it a 
 few inches, so much the better. In the ftiU again 
 this should be spread around the tree and the roots 
 bared as before. Lime and Potash are both a specific 
 manure for the peach tree, giving it increased vig- 
 or and productiveness, and its leaves a fine, healthy 
 deep green color. AVe have known the worm to bo 
 destroyed by this treatment, but where he has al- 
 ready made an entrance, he had better be first fer- 
 reted out with the knife and destroyed. The lime 
 assists the the healing of the bark. This method 
 answers most effectual as a preventive. 

For large sized trees, the quantity of lime of ash- 
 es should be increased to a peck or more. 

Michigan Double Plough. 

Mr Editor: — Your readers have no doubt heard 
 of the Michigan Double Plough, and some of them 
 may be glad to know more of its peculiar form and 
 advantages. 

It consists of two ploughs on the same beam, about 
 ten inches apart. The forward plough takes a fur- 
 row of three or four inches in depth, and lays its 
 slice exactly bottom iipwards into the previous fur- 
 row. The after plough follows insfanter, cutting six 
 or eight inches deeper, and throwing the subsoil 
 over the advancing furrow slice in as loose and mel- 
 low a condition as could be desired for planting. 
 The toughest sward ground, hi/ once ploughing with 
 this plough, is made to look like an old field plough- 
 ed and harrowed. Twice ploughing with the com- 
 mon plough would not do as well. The working of 
 the double plough at agricultural fairs in Massa- 
 chusetts, has taken farmers by surprise. The half, 
 they say, was not told them. Spectators and Com- 
 mittees have gone away filled with admiration, and 
 for proof of this we need only refer to the numerous 
 agricultural reports that have been published within 
 the last year or two. The writer of the Essex coun- 
 ty Report says: 

"I determined to give the double ploughs such a 
 trial as to satisfy mynelf at least, of their value. Ac- 
 cordingly I wrote to Mr. Prouty, the proprietor, and 
 manufacturer of this plough, to send me two of the 
 best structure, which he did; they were tried in every 
 form thought desirable to test merits. The result was, 
 that each and all expressed their opinion, that the 
 plough was a decided improvement on any ploughs 
 they had ever seen, and that it would be" found of 
 great value- for many purposes on the farm." 

In the Plymouth county report is the following: — 
 "Rarely is seen work more thoroughly and expe- 
 ditiously done. This plough may be commended to 
 the notice of all those farmers, who arc desix-ous of 
 pulverising their soil thoroughly in the least time." 
 The Hampshire Agricultural society say — "For turn- 
 ing in of grass lands and stubble, this implement is 
 considered one of the most important that has come 
 to notice." The Berkshire Society say: "The plough 
 that attracted the most notice was the Michigan sod 
 and subsoil (or double) plough, held by Dr. Reed, of 
 Pittsfleld." ^ f o > 3 

Any number of such testimonials maybe gather- 
 ed from the agricultural documents of last year. 
 The following statements may be considered as 

high authority. They are from the pen of Calvin 
 Hatch, Esq., of Farmington, Ct. 

One year since, I obtained one of the Michigan 
 Double Ploughs, manufactured by Messrs. Prouty & 
 Mears, of Boston, and used it for breaking up about 
 six acres for corn ground, which I expected to plough 
 more than once and harrow, to get it in a state suit- 
 able for planting; but after seeing the work so ad- 
 mirably done, concluded I could have it in no better 
 state for planting, and proceeded to plant without 
 farther preparation. I never had better hoeing on 
 sward ground, for the sward was so covered it lay 
 quite clean. Many have admired the work done by 
 this plough, and some have used it, and many have 
 been lookers on when it has been in use. Mine ob- 
 tained the first premium at the last plowing match 
 of the Union Agricultural Society." 

The question has been asked, "Can you plough 
 and harrow at once ?" In reference to this question 
 an English paper remarks: 

"If we could have a plough so made that it would, 
 in the act of inverting the furrow, slice, break it in- 
 to pieces, and pass over the bottom of the furrow 
 without the friction of any smooth surface of iron or 
 other material being drawn over, closing up all the 
 pores and fissues in the under strata, I think there is 
 little doubt but such a plough's cultivation would 
 approach (when performed at equal depths) fork or 
 spade cultivation." 

I think, Mr. Editor, this extract and more with it, 
 appeared in your own paper. Our friend over the 
 water never saw the Michigan Double Plough, or he 
 would have said — "This is the very implement we 
 were looking for — it inverts and pulverises just as 
 we had conceived it possible for the thing to bo 
 done — it realizes in the most complete sense the idea 
 of inloughlng and harroiving at once." 

Farmers have a deep interest in acquainting them- 
 selves with this plough. No man wishes to plough 
 his land twice, and harrow it besides, when once 
 ploughing with the double plough would be equally 
 as good. The facts submitted in this article may 
 stimulate inquiry, and lead to a trial of this most 
 important implement by the farmers of Maine. It 
 should be noted that David Prouty & Co., North 
 Market street, Boston, are the only manufacturers of 
 the genuine Michigan Double Plough for New Eng- 
 land. — [Maine Farmer.

Trial of Reaping Machines. 

The following notice was received after the form 
 in last number of Farm .Journal was made up, and 
 too late for insertion. For convenience of publica- 
 tion, it is necessary to have oUr matter arranged not 
 lator than the 20th of each month, and we should be 
 obliged if our friends, who have communications or 
 minutes of meetings interesting'to the farmers of the 
 State, would forward us ofiicial copies as early as 
 possible, so as to procure their insertion in the cur- 
 rent number. The trial of reaping machines, about 
 to be held, is worthy of special attention from man- 
 ufacturers and agents. The difiiculty felt at annual 
 exhibitions, in deciding upon the merits of machines, 
 impossible to tost practically at the time, will be ob- 
 viated by the exhibition now proposed. There will
