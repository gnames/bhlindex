REAPING MACHIXES— AGRTCDLTURAL SOCIETY— POTATO ROT. 

no doubt be a large ooncouMe of farmers present, 
 and the occasion Tvillbe one of great interest. 

The high price, and absolute scarcity of farm la- 
 bor at times when work must be performed, if at all, 
 is gradually increasing the necessU'j for agricultural 
 machinery, and its introduction is a benefit all a- 
 round. Much of our farm work is slovenly done, for 
 want of a sufficient amount of labor being concen- 
 trated upon it, which can only be remedied by the 
 use of good labor saving implements. Thrashing 
 and drilling machines, hay and straw cutters, horse 
 power churns, &c., only introduced generally within 
 a few years, are now considered indispensable, and 
 reaping and mowing machines, of approved con- 
 struction and working, are also much wanted. 

IjiroRTANT TO Farmers, — Agreeably to previous 
 invitation, a meeting of Farmers was held at the 
 Black Bear Hotel, Philadelphia, on Saturday, the 
 9th of April, 1553, for the purpose of taking into 
 consideration the propriety of holding an Exhibition 
 and trial of mowing and reaping machines the pres- 
 ent summer. The meeting was organized by ap- 
 pointing Alan W. Corson, of Montgomery county, 
 Chairman, and Thomas Pratt, of Delaware, Secre- 
 tary. 

Philadelphia, Blontgomery, Chester and Delaware 
 counties, were represented in the meeting, by the ap- 
 pearance of a delegation from each county, who 
 were unanimous in fiivor of such an exhibition, 
 which was ordered to be held .at Flowertown, in 
 Montgomery count)', on July the 7th, upon the prop- 
 erty of Dr. McC'rea, who has very kindly offered his 
 farm for that purpose. 

Isaac Newton, lion. Sketchly Morton, Jos. Craw- 
 ford, Isaac Pearson and Alan W. Corson, wore ap- 
 pointed acommittee to invite manufacturers and oth- 
 ers to attend the exhibition with their machines. 

Editors are requested to give notice of said exhi- 
 bition. 

Adjourned to meet on the Yth of July, at Silver's 
 Hotel, in Flowertown, at 10 o'clock, A. M.

Chester County Agricultural Society. 

A meeting of Farmers was held on the 25th ult., 
 at the Horticultural Hall, West Chester, with a view 
 to re-organize an Agricultural Society in this county. 

John Parker, Esq., was called to the Chair, Jacob 
 Massey and John Baldwin were appointed Vice Pres- 
 idents, and James Pierce and jUexander Marshall 
 Secretaries. The meeting was addressed by Dr. 
 Walker and John S. Bowen, Esq. 

On motion, Dr. Isaac Walker, John S. Bowen, and 
 Alban Webb, were appointed d committee to prepare 
 and report a Constitution for the Society, who,after a 
 short interval, reported a Constitution, which was 
 adopted. 

A committee was appointed to report permanent 
 ofScers to an adjourned meeting, to bo held in the 
 Borough of West Chester, at the time of the ap- 
 proaching Horticultural and Industrial Exhibition, 
 on the 18th of Juue. 

The ball is now fairly started, and Chester coun- 
 ty will soon be up with the times, and with her sister 
 counties in this respect. The question has been often 
 asked why Chester county, proverbial for its improv- 
 ed stock, and highly cultivated farms, should be 
 without an organization of this kind. It may be 
 replied, that some ton or twelve years ago, and in ad- 
 vance of much movement on the subject in any other 
 county of the State, a Society was established here, 
 and held several large and flourishing exhibitions. 
 The commercial revulsions and depression of prices 
 of stock and farm produce, about that period, caused 
 it to decline, and the funds on hand were passed over 
 to the Chester county Horticultural Society. This is 
 now and has been since, in active and flourishing op- 
 eration, but an Agricultural society seems also re- 
 quired, to keep pace with the present progress of im- 
 provement. County Associations of this kind have 
 been useful through the State, in bringing farmers 
 together, awakening enquiry, and extending a knowl- 
 edge of improvements in stock, farm implements and 

productions.

To Prevent the Potato Hot. 
 Western Saratoga P. 0., Union co.,Ill., April 4,1853. 
 Permit me, through your paper, to make known to 
 the farming part of the community a perfect cure 
 and preventive of the Potato Hot, having tested it 
 thoroughly four years, with perfect success ; while 
 others in tlie same field, who did not use the preven- 
 tive, lost their entire crop by the rot. It not only 
 prevents tlie rot, but restores the potato to its primi- 
 tive vigor, and the product is not only sound, but 
 double the size, consequently producing twice the 
 quantity on the same ground, and the vines grow 
 much larger, and retain their freshness and vitality 
 until the frost kills them. Aside from the cure of 
 the rot, the farmers would be more than doubly com- 
 pensated for their trouble and expense in the increase 
 and quaJity of the crop. It being of such vast im- 
 portance for the farming part of the community to 
 know the secret of the preventive in time to save the 
 coming crop of potatoes, I hasten its publication, in 
 order to give them a chance to try it, if they see 
 proper, the present season, trusting entirely to the 
 public gratitude to reward me, as they may see prop- 
 er, at their next Annual Fair, for the discovery, af- 
 ter they have tested the merits of the preventive. — 
 The remedy or preventive of the potato rot is as fol- 
 lows : Take one peck of fine salt and mis it tho- 
 roughly with half a bushel of Nora Scotia plaster 
 or (ij/psum, (the plaster is the best,) and immediate- 
 ly after hoeing the potatoes the second time, or just 
 as the young potato begins to set, sprinkle on the 
 main vines next to the ground, a table-spoonful of 
 the above mixture to each hill, and be sure to get it 
 on the main vines, as it is found that the rot proceeds 
 from a sting of an inscet in the vino, and the mix- 
 ture coming in contact with the vine, kills the efl'cct 
 of it, before it reaches the potato. Farmers would 
 do well to try it, as they would be well paid for their 
 trouble by the increase of their crop as well as the 
 quality of the potato. Try it and sec. I could, if 
 necessary, furnish ample certificates to substantiate 
 the above, but deem it unnecessary, as it needs only 
 a trial to prove it. — [N. Y. Tribune.
