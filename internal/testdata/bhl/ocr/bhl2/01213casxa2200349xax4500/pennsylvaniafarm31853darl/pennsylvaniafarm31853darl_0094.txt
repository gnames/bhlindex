 Potatoes. 

EsTiiERTo.v, April 4, '53. 

Messrs. Editors: — 

As the time for planting po- 
 tatoes is approaching, I send you the result of a 
 careful experiment made with different manures, 
 with the remark tha-t I shall make a similar trial 
 this Spring, and trust that some of my brother far- 
 mers may do the same on limestone, slate and grav- 
 elly soils. 

On the 19th of May last, I selected 126 Mercer 
 Potatoes, without care, as nearly the - same size as 
 possible, weighing about three to the pound — -cut 
 each potatoe into two pieces lengthwise, and planted 
 them in my garden, in rich sand loam soil, in hills 
 two and a half feet apart, three pieces in each hill, 
 and attended to them myself. 

No. 1. Twelve hills, three pieces in each hill, Ken- 
 tish's Artificial Guano, manufactured in New York, 
 two ounces to the hill, covered one inch with ground 
 before applying the guano. One inch on top of 
 Guano. 

No. 2. Twelve hills, three pieces to each hill. Sa- 
 line or Chemical Fertilizer, manufactured in Phila/- 
 delphia, covered as No. 1. 

No. 3. Twelve hills, three pieces to each hill. Po- 
 tatoes first rolled in Plaster, covered one inch with 
 soil, two ounces plaster then applied, and again cov- 
 ered with one inch of earth. 

No. 4. Same number potatoes and hills as former; 
 applied two ounces of air-slacked Lime, and covered 
 as No. 1. 

No. 5. Same as former: well rotted short barn- 
 yard manure on the potatoes, and covered two inches 
 with earth. 

No. 6. Same as former; short barn-yard manure 
 under potatoes, covered two inches with earth. 

No. 7. Same as last; covered one inch with earth, 
 applied two ounces Peruvian Guano, and covered 
 with another inch of earth. 

On the 23d September, I raised them, and careful- 
 ly weighed the product of each twelve hills. 

No. 1. Kentish Guano; weighed 44 pounds. 

No. 2. Saline Fertilizer; weighed 501 pounds; clean 
 smooth skin. 

No. 3. Plaster; weighed 42 J pounds.. 

No. 4. Lime; weighed 41 pounds, found one rotten 
 potatoe, and skin of all rough . 

No. 5. Barn-yard manure on iop; weighed 34 lbs., 
 one-fifth of all nibbled by mice and moles. I think 
 seed was partly eaten. 

No. 6. Manure below; weighed 44} lbs., also eaten, 
 but not so much as No. 5. 

No. 7. Peruvian Guano; weighed 67J lbs., even in 
 size, smooth skin, free from excrescences. 

I have before tried Peruvian Ou.ano on Wheat, 
 Corn and Oats. On the Oats there was a marked 
 benefit, the growth was taller and the color a darker 

green. The spots where it had been sown, could be 
 observed .at the distance of one hundred yards. On 
 the Wheat and Corn I could perceive no difference. 

A. 0. HIESTER. 

The above was sent us for publication some months 
 since, but having been lost or mislaid, we now copy 
 it from the Pennsylvania Telegraph. .Judge Hiester 
 is one of our best practical farmers, and the results 
 of his interesting experiment are well worth the at- 
 tention. of the reader, as showing the comparative 
 merits of the different manures. 

It will be seen that the Peruvian Guano takes the 
 precedence of all the other fertilizei-s, when applied 
 in the same quantity. But^when it is remembered 
 that the Chemical Fertilizer, the yield from which 
 was but a few pounds less than the Guano, cost but 
 a little more than one-third the price of Guano, it 
 becomes apparent that it is by far the most valuable 
 of the results of Judge Iliester's experiment, and 
 may be taken as a safer general criterion.

 Profitable Sow. 

Editors of the r.\R5i Journ.^l: Dear Sirs: — In 
 •January 1852, I purchased a sow, which has shown 
 her ■elf somewhat remarkable in point of fecundity, 
 and \5'lthal has been rather profitable. If you think 
 an account of her last year's doings worthy a place 
 in your valuable Journal, I will give it to you. 

I bought her in -January for $15. Second of Feb- 
 uary she became the mother of fifteen pigs, of which 
 she saved thirteen, two being overlaid. One of the 
 tliirteen died when about three months old, from 
 eating too much buttermilk. On June 18th, she 
 brought forth fifteen more young grunters, of which 
 she kept twelve; one of which I gave away, and sold 
 another for SI 50. On November 23d, she had fifteen 
 more, fourteen of which lived; two I sold for §1 25 
 a piece, one was killed for a roast, and eleven still 
 exist. 

The first litter, in September averaged 1201bs. of 
 pork, each at 7 J cents, or S108. The second, on 
 December 1st, averaged 75 lb., at 7 J- cents, or .§55 80. 
 The third I value now at §5 each, making with those 
 sold, §57 50. The old lady, if she should not hap- 
 pen to die, promises to produce another lot, I know 
 not how many. The principal food of these hogs, 
 has been the -milk from a dairy of twenty cows, with 
 some corn to fatten. 

_I have been offered double what I gave for the 
 sow, and allowing her to be worth that, it will make 
 for the whole lot, S!2.51 30. Deducting §15, the first 
 cost of the sow, and §75 for corn, which is more 
 than they consumed, it will leave |161 30. A tol- 
 erable fair profit for one year, from one sow.
