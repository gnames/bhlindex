Black Spanish Fowls. 

The above orif^inal and spirited engraving of Black 
 Spanish Fowls, belonging to Wm. C. Rudman, Esq., 
 Philadelphia, was executed by Edward Clarkson, 
 who, by the way, is earning quite a reputation in this 
 line, for his faithful and truly natural portraits of 
 animals. 

These fowls are beautiful specimens of a breed, 
 not yet much known, but highly valued wherever 
 introduced, for great laying qualities, combined with 
 very tender flesh. Their eggs are white and unusu- 
 ally large, nearly equal to the Shanghai, and where 
 these are the chief object, it is highly probable that 
 this is the Breed. They are also well adapted for 
 capons. The color of this breed is uniformly black, 
 when the stock is pure. The combs of both male 
 and female are large and of a brilliant scarlet color, 
 the hens' drooping to one side, while that of the 
 male is erect and deeply serrated. A singular fea- 
 ture of this fowl is a white spot on each side of the 
 face, â€” and to this particular mark "the fancy" set 
 the value. In England, among many of the poultry 
 fanciers, these fowls take rank with the Shanghais, 
 and are in great demand at very high prices. We 
 have seen the cross of this breed, with both the Shan- 

ghai and Dorking, and they are considered very prof- 
 itable either for the farm or the table. 

Our friend Rudman will have a fine opportunity 
 to test the respective merits of his breeds of Poul- 
 try, and we hope to hear from him upon the subject 
 through the columns of the Farm .Journal. 

Fine Poultry. 

William C. Rudman, we perceive, holds some of his 
 fine stock of poultry for sale. The purUij of this 
 stock can bo relied upon, and those in want of such 
 will do well to look after it. See his advertisement.

Before the Neic Hampshire Agriciiltural Soeiely. 

We are indebted to the author, one of the able ed- 
 itors of the Journal of Agriculture, for a copy of 
 the above aldress, from which we shall take pleas- 
 ure in making a few extracts fir another number of 
 the Farm Journal. It ODcns out to the sun light, 
 some of the prejudices of the day, which have done 
 so much to retard the progress of agricultural ira- 
 provcmont, better than any thing we have seen 
 Lately.
