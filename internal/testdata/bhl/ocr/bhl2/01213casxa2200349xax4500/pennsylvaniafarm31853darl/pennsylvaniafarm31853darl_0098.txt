STATE FAIR— CARTS AND WAGONS— PLtJM TREE, 

[June 

hibition. There is no man in the community, who 
 deserves the name of a farmer, and no woman who 
 esteems the important place she holds in her hus- 
 band's house, who does not, or may not possess some- 
 thing of which she may be justly proud; and even 
 if they should be mistaken in this, they will at all 
 events be entitled to the credit of having afforded a 
 good example of thus testifying their approbation of 
 an institution which thoy must be convinced is cal- 
 culated to spread abroad information of the mos t 
 valuable character, and introduce improvements of 
 the highest value to us all. 

The only way that a fair representation of the 
 products of the farms of our country can be had is, 
 for each farmer on an occasion of a State Fair like 
 the present, to bring the best he has got, and a 2^"'^^' 
 of every thing, for there is no one so poor a farmer 
 but what can excel in sometliing. One of the best 
 ways to promote agriculture, is the frequent meeting 
 of the tillers of the soil— a frequent comparing of 
 notes, and a social converse with one another upon 
 the different modes of farming, and upon the results 
 of certain experiments as tried by each in different 
 sections, and upon different soils — a bringing togeth- 
 er of their yearly products in competition, and an ex- 
 change of seeds and breeds. 

Should the opportunity of the coming exhibition 
 be duly appreciated by the farmers and others of our 
 country, we may confidently expect to see together 
 at that time, the largest concourse of people ever as- 
 sembled in Pennsylvania. That the different branch- 
 es of industry will be represented in almost endless 
 variety, no one can doubt, and that our sister States 
 will contribute largely and compete strongly with us 
 for our prizes, we may confidently anticipate. 

Every effort will be made by the Society, to pro- 
 mote the interests of exhibitors, and to encourage a 
 laudable competition in all the industrial pursuits. 

The Society anticipates that this, their third an- 
 nual exhibition, will be much larger than either the 
 first or second, and situated as it will be, where easy 
 communication may be had to it from the East and 
 the West, that it will possess every attraction and 
 advantage that contribute to the success of an Agri- 
 cultural Exhibition.

Care of Carts and Wagons. 

It is strange what a differenee there is among far- 
 mers with regard to the importance of housing their 
 wagons and carts. Prudent, economical men in 
 most things, are wholly insensible to the great loss 
 they experience by allowing their expensive vehicles 
 to be beaten upon and soaked by the storms, and 
 checked and shrunk by the blazing sun. 

Wagons and carts from the maker's shop are sel- 
 dom well painted. The owner gets so anxious to be 

using his new cart, and the old one seems so unbear- 
 able, that the cart is taken from the shop before the 
 little openings in the wood and the joints are half 
 filled with paint— -the farmer "guesses it will do," 
 and away it goes to commence a straight-forward 
 course to decay. A few days after, it rains. The 
 cart is soaked through. The joints absorb water 
 and swell. Bye-and-bye, when the water has dried 
 out, after having been dragged about the farm for 
 several days, the joints become loose. This process 
 needs only to be repeated a sufficient number of 
 times to give you a heavy, ricketty body, which, in a 
 few years, breaks up, and sends you to the mechan- 
 ic again. 

But the wheels are the most important part. Upon 
 them has the most labor been expended in propor- 
 tion to their weight, and of them should the most 
 care be taken. The hubs, generally, are made of 
 elra. Elm, exposed to the weather, is of short dura- 
 tion. It is used because it is difficult to split it in 
 driving the spokes. White oak hubs invariably 
 crack and open, when uncovered by paint, and ex- 
 posed to the weather. White oak timber — indeed, 
 all timber — loses its strength and tenacity, after be- 
 ing again and again exposed to fain and air. The 
 hub then grows soft, the spokes settle into it a very 
 little, and the consequence is that the tire is loose, 
 and the blacksmith's aid is needed. 

A wagon left out of doors will, in a few years, be- 
 come a spongy, heavy mass, unprofitable to use. As 
 proof of the correctness of these remarks, we know 
 of a farmer who has run down three sets of wheels 
 by exposure, and not by work, while another has a 
 pair of wheels perfectly sound, built a year or two 
 before his neighbor's first pair. In the first case, the 
 wheels have never been housed, winter nor summer; 
 but have been left by the roadside, as if impregnable 
 as the stone wall to injury from the weather. In 
 the other case, the cart has been uniformly housed, 
 and always well painted. It must be very intelli- 
 gible to the reader which is the wiser course. — ^New

The following, on the above disease, from the dis- 
 tinguished entomologist, of New England, is worthy 
 of attention. 

"Let those who are interested in the solution of 
 the question, carefully examine the twigs of last 
 yeai-'s growth, and if any punctures or fissures appa- 
 rently caused by insects are found in the smooth 
 bark of these twigs, let every wounded part be mark- 
 ed by tying a piece of coarse yarn about it loosely. 
 Then let these places be narrowly watched, to see 
 whether warts originate therein during the summer, 
 and let the results be made known to the public. On 
 the other hand — let those twigs that are now free 
 from punctures and wounds, be also carefully watch- 
 ed, and if warts are found to be produced upon them 
 in the course of the summer, let the fact also be made 
 known. In this way the public may be satisfied 
 whether the warts do or do not arise from visible 
 punctures or wounds made before the warts began to 
 rupture the bark. You perhaps are aware that the 
 practised eye can detect the incipient wart before it 
 bursts through the circle of the twig. Cut it out in 
 this state, as far as tlie inner bark and wood are 
 found to be discolated, and apply fine salt or brine 
 to the part, and the disease will be arrested." — [Bos-
