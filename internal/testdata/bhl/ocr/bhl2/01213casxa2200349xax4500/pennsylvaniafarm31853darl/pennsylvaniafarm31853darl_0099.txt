IMPROVKD APPLE PARING MACHINE— Fig. I. 

The annexed engravings represent a very ingeni- 
 ous and useful machine for paring, coring, and quar- 
 tering apples, which is also applicable for purposes 
 of a similar nature where the first operation is only 
 required, and is owned by N. E. Smith & R. W. Fen- 
 wick, of New York City, to whom the entire patent 
 has been transferred by W. H. Lazelle, the inventor. 
 Patented Jan. 25, 1853. 

Figure' 1 is a perspective view of the machine, 
 and exhibits the manner of performing the above 
 mentioned operations. Figure 2 is also a perspective 
 view of the machine on a larger scale, showing the 
 same more clearly, 

This machine consists of a semicircular stationa- 
 ry rack. A, having a hollow traversing lever, B, 
 which turns on an axis, C, and is moved horizontally 
 back and forth by means of the handle, G, and pin- 
 ion, F, which latter gears into the teeth of the rack, 
 A. The pinion, F, is fixed to the outer end of a hol- 
 low spindle, which turns freely inside the hollow le- 
 ver, B, and has at its other end a flanged fork, D, on 
 which the fruit, E, is placed to be pared. Suppos- 
 ing the fruit to be as represented, on the end of the 
 fork, and the handle, G, moved round from left to 
 right to the position shown in figure 2, the apple will 
 be nearly pared by the stationary swinging knife, H,

■which is kept up in contact with the apple by the 
 spring, H'. 

As the lever is moved in a horizontal direction, as 
 described, the prongs of the fork and also the apple, 
 ■will traverse a semicircle, and the knife, II, will act 
 longitudinally from the blossom to the stem end of 

the apple. By the pinion, D, being made to traverse 
 the rack, the spindle attached to the pinion gives mo- 
 tion to the fork, and thus the latter i.s made to revolve 
 with a rapid motion against the knife, II'. Thus it 
 will be seen that the apple and the fork have two 
 motions — one in the path of a horizontal circle, and
