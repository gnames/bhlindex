the other describing verticle circles. The swinging 
 knife, II, being allowed to yield, and yet being firm 
 and flexible, by moans of the spring, H', renders it 
 very efficient and accommodating for apples of dif- 
 ferent sizes and of unequal surface, and also obvi- 
 ates the great wear and tear from the excessive ten- 
 sion that it is necessarily exerted in the old machines 
 on the spring, which is drawn out, as the knife tra- 
 verses over the semi-diameter of the fruit. The ap- 
 ple being pared, and the handle drawn to the extrem- 
 ity of the rack, the machine is in a position ready for 
 coring and quartering, the apparatus for perform- 
 ing these operations consists of a coring rod, -J, which 
 passes through the fork, F, having a button at its 
 outer and a collar at its inner end, in -which latter 
 is fixed a single prong that serves for holding the 
 apple while being pared, and tlien retains it when it 
 is knocked 08' the fork, D, after having been pared, 
 in order to be cored and quartered. For the pur- 
 pose of effecting the last named objects, the coring 
 rod, -J, is forced by tlie hand against the cutter, I, 
 which consists of a hollow tube furnished with four 
 knives. The number of these latter may, however, 
 he increased to any extent when it is desired, instead 
 of quartering, to slice the apple for drying or other 
 objects. 

After the apple has been cored and quartered, the 
 rod, J, is allowed to return to its original position by 
 means of a spring in the outer end, between the but^ 
 ton and the pinion, F, the said spring being com- 
 pressed as the rod is forced against the cutter, I, and 
 resuming its former position when the hand is with- 
 drawn — the apple and core falling into proper re- 
 ceivers. 

This machine presents manifold advantages over 
 anything of a similar nature, both with respect to 
 cheapness, durability, and also saving of labor as 
 well as time, it being capable of performing almost 
 double the amount of work in a given time than can 
 be done by any other. Among its advantages is the 
 use of a traversing handle instead of a crank, by 
 which it has a horizontal instead of a rotary motion, 
 thus rendering the operation quicker and also easi- 
 er to be effected. All the parts of this machine can 
 Ije made light or as strong as desired, and not one of 
 them is lialjle to got out of order. It is a machine 
 that will endure without requiring to be repaired 
 for a great number of years, and it pares apples 
 with great rapidity and with astonishing precision. 
 A silver medal was awarded to the inventor at the 
 last Fair of the American Institute, it being the best 
 machine ever before on exhibition.

Self liOadiug Cart. 

Measures to secure a patent for the above have 
 been taken by Samuel Parks and Francis C. Rue, of 
 Warren, 111. The novelty of this cart consists in 
 having one or more plows underneath the axle, and 
 in fitting around the wheels a series of buckets, by 
 which the cart is made to both dig up the earth, and 
 likewise load for itself. The plows are secured to an 
 adjustable frame underneath the cart, and the depth 
 to which they are reriuired to enter tlie ground is reg- 
 ulated by a lever attached to a transverse liar at the 
 back of the frame, which is operated by the atten- 
 dant. The position of the lever and that of the plow- 
 share being maintained by resting the front end of 
 the former upon the step belonging to a bar which is 

suspended in front. The earth is raised up into the 
 cart by a series of buckets formed around the wheels, 
 and which, as they revolve, are filled and discharge 
 their contents into the cart. — [Scientific American.

 Raising Poultry, 

West Philadelphia, May lOth, 1853. 
 J. L. Darlington, Esq., 

Dear Sir: — In November 
 1851, not enjoying good health, I was induced to di- 
 rect my mind to the raising of Poultry, as an amus- 
 ing employment, attended with a moderate degree of 
 exercise, which would in all probability prolong my 
 time with my family. I purchased three pairs of 
 Cochin China Fowls, Viotoi'ia stock, three Cocks and 
 three Pullets. I soon found, (with proper attention) 
 that their precocity and prolific character, combin- 
 ed with hardiness, would require more extensive ac- 
 commodations; one of the Pullets being the mother 
 of eighty chickens before she was a year old, (of 
 course she did not hatch them all:) she laid forty- 
 four eggs in succession dailv. I became convinced 
 that there had not been sufficient attention given by 
 the Farmers to that branch of their business, or our 
 country would have been much better supplied with 
 poultry. My success has induced several gentlemen 
 to solict a publication, giving a description in detail 
 of my chicken establishment, also the result of my 
 different experiments in hatching and roaring chick- 
 ens by artificial means. 
 I will commence with my chicken houses. 
 The west building is eleven feet square, sixteen 
 feet high on the south side, and twelve feet high on 
 the north, with a cellar four feet deep, the whole di- 
 vided into three stories. The basement eight feet 
 high. The next story seven feet high, with a 
 slanting ceiling parallel to, and four feet below 
 the roof: a passage four feet wide partitioned off the 
 north side, with steps for the Fowls to pass to the 
 roosts, and also to the nests (eighteen in number) 
 which are situated near the middle of the building, 
 the best location to protect them from excessive heat 
 or cold; the hens entering through holes in this par- 
 tition, to the nests, the eggs being taken out from a 
 passage on the other side, where there are small 
 panes of glass set into each shutter, that opens into 
 the nests: this building is lighted and aired with win- 
 dows in eajh story, on the south side, one window on 
 the west lighting the passage to the roosts, and one 
 in the east end near the ceiling with a trap door in 
 the roof for ventilation, which is only partly lifted, 
 by means of a cord and pulley attached to the cover- 
 ing over the tiap door: all the windows have glass, 
 and open to give air, which is essential to the health 
 of the fowls. Adjoining this, on the east is a room 
 for feed, five feet by eleven — next to this, is a buil- 
 ding twenty-four feet by eleven — glass on the south 
 front, and east end, with glass roof, pitching to the
