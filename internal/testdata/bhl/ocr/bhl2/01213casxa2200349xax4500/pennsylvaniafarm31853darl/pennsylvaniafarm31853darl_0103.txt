last three years, a small insect, or midge, which preys 
 npon the kernel in its milky state, materially affec- 
 ting it. White wheats have been most injured. It 
 has little resemblance to the barn weevil, although 
 this is the name which the farmers give it. I have 
 no doubt it, is the same thus described in the Cultiva- 
 tor of 1834: "The Wheat crop has been raore or 
 less injured in the Northern States for some years, 
 by small maggots, which prey upon the kernell, 
 while growing in the field, and before the grain has 
 become hard. In some instances nearly the entire 
 crop has been destroyed, while in other cases the in- 
 jury has only been partial. It has been generally 
 believed that the maggots have proceeded from a fly, 
 which deposits its eggs while the wheat is in bloss- 
 om, or soon after. It has also been remarked that the 
 fly is seen but a few days, and that if during its pres- 
 ence, the wheat ear has either not burst in the sheath 
 or is far advanced towards maturity, no evil is expe- 
 rienced from the insect. No preventive of the evil 
 has been published among us." 

I suppose it to be the Cecidomya triiici, and this to 
 be identical with the cause that led to the almost to- 
 tal abandonment of wheat raising in Dutchess coun- 
 ty. New York, and some other localities, some years 
 since. 

I notice upon a peruial of the Patent Office Re- 
 port for 1851, that this insect has first appe.ared with- 
 in the last throe years, in the great wheat growing 
 district west of Cayuga lake.

 "The Strawberry Q,uestion" 

IIoLMESBCRO, May 10th, 1853. 
 To THE Editors or the Farm Jocrnal : — I do not 
 think that the spirit in which the article by Mr. W. 
 R. Prince, in your May No. was written, at all cal- 
 cuLated to awaken the scientfic inquiry he professes 
 to admire. Mr. P. is emphatic in his "I declare if 
 to be utterhj impossible." Of what importance is his 
 "declaration" in a scientific question? In science 
 we want facts, and without these we care for no 
 man's "declarations." In my communication to the 
 Pennsylvania Horticultural Society, I briefly detail- 
 ed facts as I had observed them, and exhibited plants 
 illustrative of my remarks at the same time. I don't 
 care what the facts prove — I have no predilection for 
 any particular theory, I am in no way committed to 
 any principle. I have used the utmost care in my 
 experiments and observations, indifferent as to the 
 conclusions I might come to. Can Mr. Prince say 
 why my statements should be received as "based in 
 error, and calculated only to mislead?" Does he 
 wish me when I speak of a fact within my own knowl- 
 edge, to swear to its truth on the "Sultan's Beard," 
 the "Prince's Moustache," or come d^wn with a 
 clencher? That Mr. Prince in all his "long experi- 
 ence" never saw any deviation in the sexes of the 
 Strawberry, is of no more value in determining that 
 they do not deviate, than the Sultan's opinion when 

"He saw with his own eyes the world was round. 
 Was also certain that the earth was square; 

Because he had Journied fifty miles, aud found 
 No sign that it was circular any where." 

Not wishing to occupy much of the valuable time 
 of our society, my remarks were too brief to be as 
 clear as they might have been. I will apply them so 
 far as they go to the question as Mr. P. himself states 
 it:— 

Does the pistillate Strawberry plant, which by it- 
 self is barren, change its sexual character by the 
 treatment referred to, and produce fruit ? I reply. 
 I took for experiment twelve runners from pistillate 
 plants in my forcing house — plants so pistillate that 
 I had to become indebted to the kindness of Mr. 
 Buist for a plant of Cuthill's Black Prince, which he 
 accidently had in bloom, to fertilize them with. — 
 These runners were placed by themselves in our ve- 
 getable forcing house early in the winter, in a posi- 
 tion where the temperature could have seldom been 
 over 55°. Seven out of these produced perfect flow- 
 ers, the other five pistillate. The latter I fertilized 
 from the perfect ones with a Camel hair brush, and 
 both kinds produced their fruit. The fruit was how- 
 ever, small, none exceeding an inch and a quarter in 
 circumference,a fact I attributed to the weakness of the
