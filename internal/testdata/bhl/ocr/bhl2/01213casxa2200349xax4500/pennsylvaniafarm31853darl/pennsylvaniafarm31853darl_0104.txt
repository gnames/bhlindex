original forced plants, and not to defective sexuality. 
 I may be in error in my opinion that the change from 
 one sex to another, was the result of cultivation. I 
 ask no quarter for an opinion, but if that was not the 
 cause of the change, what was ? 

As Mr P. asks for "conclusive" proof, by which I 
 presume he means a reference to some authority oth- 
 erwise than my own; I will give an additional fact 
 which will verify it in some degree, and show not 
 only that a staminate or perfect flowering plant can 
 be obtained from a pistillate one, which is all I have 
 undertaken to prove hitherto, but that both kinds can 
 be obtained at one time on the same plant. I have 
 abed of MoAvoy'sExtra Red. AVhen they commenced 
 flowering recently, there were as many perfect flow- 
 ers as pistillates. On pointing these out to a gentle- 
 man, (as firm a believer in its truly pistillate charac- 
 ter as Mr. Prince himself, and who has probably paid 
 as much attention to the subject,) he decided that an 
 erroneous kind had got mixed with them somehow. 
 On examination I found that the pistillate spikes pro- 
 ceeded from the same plants as the others. I have sent 
 you a root with both on, and as we are threatened 
 with a further communication on the subject in the 
 Horticulturist,! have sent Mr. Barry a specimen also' 
 The testimony of two witnesses ought to be true. 

As I have no additional facts to offer, I suppose I 
 shall do no good by following Mr. Prince into the 
 subject of "eternal and immutable law." All laws 
 arc "immutable" until we find exceptions, and some- 
 times what we f^mcy are "immutable" laws, are 
 only the effects of other principles. There is a pis- 
 tillate plant of the Euphorbiaoeous tribe of plants, 
 in a locality thousands of miles away from any indi- 
 vidual of the same genus or species ; well known to 
 Botanists as producing perfect seeds. Would Mr. 
 P. like to have an account of it ?

 Mr. J. L. Darlington: ^ 

Sir — I send you enclosed 
 one dollar, the subscription price of the Pennsylva- 
 vania Farm -Journal, for the present year. I have 
 taken it from the beginning, and am very much 
 pleased with it. Now you may say to my brother 
 Farmers in Pennsylvania, that from 30 to 31 bushels 
 of oats sown last year, on less than twelve acres of 
 mowing valley land, I threshed and measured 740 
 bu.shels of oats; o71 bushels were round measure; 
 from one of those large field machines, which are 
 used here for threshing. My land was corn stubble 
 and my wheat on the same land, I think from appearr 
 ance will make 25 bushels per acre.

Editor Farm Journal: — 

In a previous number of 
 your "Farm Journal," I have observed a request 
 for reports of any Agricultural Societies that may 
 be formed in any of the counties of this State. — 
 I have not observed any report from this county yet, 
 in your Journal, although we have had a society in 
 existence for over a year. It is called the "Mercer 
 County Agricultural Society," and is intended, I pre- 
 sume, to co-operate with the State society, as requir- 
 ed by law, in carrying out the purposes of its organ- 
 ization. It was organized early in 1852. Its first 
 exhibition was held in Mercer, in September last, 
 and proved very successful. The display of stock 
 was much better and larger than the most sanguine 
 had anticipated. Our proximity to the Western Re- 
 serve in Ohio, where there is a good deal of fine 
 stock, has been the means of introducing better 
 qualities among us, and the consequence is our stock 
 has been improving, even in the absence of the stim- 
 ulus offered by an Agricultural Society. 

The amount and variety of articles displayed in 
 the several branches of domestic products^as also 
 fruits, implements, and the mechanic arts, evinced 
 considerable progress, and much improvement. — 
 There is, of course, a great deal to be done yet, and 
 we hope our society will beget a spirit that will load 
 to the highest state of improvement, in all the differ- 
 ent branches of agricultural industry, and the me- 
 chanic arts as applied to agriculture. 

The number of members of the Society the past 
 year, was between two and three hundred, and the 
 amount expended in premiums over §300. Another 
 exhibition will be held next fall. 

The officers fur the present year will be found be 
 low. Yours truly,
