Agricutural Knowledge. 

Address by Amos R. Shelley, delivered at the semi-an- 
 nual Exhibition of White Hall Academy, Cumber- 
 herland county. Pa., March ZOth, 1853. 
 Society has no wealth that is so uniformly under- 
 estimated as that of Agricultural Knowledge. Land 
 and Labor may be ever so abundant, yet without 
 Knowledge they will remain comparatively worth- 
 less. Experience and esperimonts, truthfully recor- 
 ded in books and periodicals, have not only a pres- 
 ent value, but, if really important, they will contin- 
 ue to bless all coming generations in after time. To 
 obtain this knowledge, it is necessary to resort to the 
 assistance of chemistry, and its kindred sciences, and 
 it is only by a continued recurrence to those sciences, 
 accompanying practical experiments, that we can 
 hope to substitute sound, rational, and profitable" 
 modes of cultivation, in place of vague popular pre 
 judiccs, or blundering ignorance. For it has been 
 well said, that industry is never so efficacious as 
 when directed by science. If the preliminary scien- 
 tific investigations are made, and the farmer knows 
 exactly the chemical ingredients of the so!l which he 
 works, and the substances which compose the differ- 
 ent grains, and their straw,s or vegetables which he 
 wishes to raise upon such soil, is it not plain that he 
 can supply to it exactly those materials that it re- 
 quires; or if he does not choose to do this, that he 
 can so adapt his farming, as to grow upon the soil 
 only such plants as require little or none of those in- 
 gredients of which it is lacking. 

Almost every State in the Union has within her 
 borders some agricultural periodical, some work by 
 which the farmers can become acquainted, and can 
 acquaint each other, with new facts in farming, the 
 results of experiments, improved modes of operation, 
 every thing else which would tend to improve the 
 soil and the mind, and render more and more respec- 
 table, and advantageous, an employment which is 
 more congenial to the natural disposition of man 
 than any other. Pennsylvania, though one of the 
 first States in importance, was, until recently, with- 
 out such a publication, but was entirely indebted to 
 works published abroad for her knowledge of agri- 
 cultural improvements — to publications which, al- 
 though admirably adapted to their own localities, are 
 too frequently only the medium of error to undis- 
 criminating minds amongst us, who do not sufficient- 
 ly know or consider the great difference in soil and 
 climate between this State and those North and 

South of us. This want, however, is now happily 
 removed. We have now a periodical of our own, 
 which supplies every deficiency. In the Penn.syl- 
 vania Farm Journal, published at West Chester, in 
 this State, the Pennsylvania farmer has a valuable 
 auxiliary, and the different agricultural societies in 
 the State, a worthy organ in which to publish their 
 proceedings. It becomes the farming community to 
 sustain well this publication, and avail themselves of 
 the valuable information contained in it. Though 
 undoubtedly excellent faraiers in their waj', it will 
 surely not be pretended that Pennsylvaniaus are at 
 the end of improvements in advantgeous and ju- 
 dicious means and modes of cultivation. In fact it 
 must be conceded that we are behind many of the 
 other States in many respects, that would be of great 
 advantage to us if they would be more attended to. 
 We live in an age of progress, and the farmers of 
 Pennsylvania must not think that agriculture alone 
 is to stand still, while science is spreading her wings, 
 and enfolding every occupation of busy life in her 
 vivifying embrace. Look for a moment at the re- 
 sults of scientific knowledge, applied to practical and 
 useful purposes every where around us. It is a 
 wonderful age, and under its pressure the world 
 moves along at a tremendous rate. Agriculture 
 must partake of the spirit that is animating all oth- 
 er branches of business. The time has come when 
 our agriculturists must occupy their proper position 
 in society — that position which God and nature orig- 
 inally designed for them. 

With these few scattered remarks, I leave the sub- 
 ject with you, trusting that you will all see the ne- 
 cessity of improving this elevating, and fostering this 
 most important branch of business. 

BOOK NOTICES. 

Prairie Farmer, published at Chicago, Illinois, 
 edited by Ambrose White, and J. A. Kennicott, 
 Horticultural editor. This is one of our best ex- 
 changes, abounds in valuable matter, and is cred- 
 itable to the great and growing State it so ably re- 
 presents. There is an off-hand, piquant style about 
 its editorials, which we like. Terms §1 00 per 
 year. 

Onio Cultivator, published by M. B. Bateham, 
 at §1 00 per year, issued semi-monthly. This is 
 the Pioneer and now well established agi-ioultural 
 work of Ohio. We always turn to its pages with 
 pleasure, sure to find in its practical and able edito- 
 rials, as well as original communications, something 
 worthy of farther circulation. 

Water Cure Journal, published in New York, 
 monthIy,at Si 00 perannum by FoAvler i.tWells,N.Y., 
 a good exponent of the Hydropathic System of treat- 
 ing disease. The advantages of water externally 
 and internally, in preference to artificial stimulants, 
 as promotive of health and preventive of disease are
