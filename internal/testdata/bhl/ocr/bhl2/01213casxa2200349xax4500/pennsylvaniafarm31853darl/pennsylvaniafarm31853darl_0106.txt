generally recognized. As a curative agent, it is but 
 little known comparatively. The work before us 
 treats of Hydropathy in both aspects. In the great 
 multiplication of nostrums, and the increased use of 
 Iodine, Mercury, as well as Tegetable poisons, the 
 fact of the human stomach being intended as the re- 
 ceptacle {^or food, notphysic, seems well nigh forgot^ 
 ten. Some valuable hints for family practice, may be 
 culled out of the Water Cure Journal. 

The Philadelphia Florist and Hokticultural 
 Journal. — This has lately been revived, under a new 
 editor, with new improvements, and we welcome it 
 with its .able corps of contributors, such as Brinckle, 
 Buist, Haldeman, Meehan, &c., with pleasure into 
 the field. 

Each number is illustrated with a superior eolorod 
 lithograph engraving. Philadelphia, of all cities in 
 the Union, ought to have a Horticultural Journal of 
 its own, and it would be strange indeed if it were 
 not well supported. 

Work for the Mouth. 

Farm. — The corn and potato crops now require 
 particular attention. The latter may still be plant- 
 ed. This month is a very important one for th« 
 corn. The early growth should be stimulated as 
 much as possible, by thorough and repeated passage 
 of the cultivator, which should not be stopped till 
 harvest time. Superphosphate of lime, a compost 
 of Guano and plaster, with a sufficient amount of 
 soil, to prevent its caustic effect, — Poudrette or ash- 
 es, should be applied to each hill, and well stirred in. 
 In cool mornings, the cut worm will be active. We 
 have found fall ploughing generally a sufficient pre- 
 ventive. A dressing of salt, five or or six bushels to 
 the acre, before planting, is a security, and has also a 
 fertilizing effect, particularly where the soil contains 
 lime. If these have been neglected, we know of 710 
 remedy but constantly stirring round the hills, and ap- 
 plying fertilizers to push it forward. When settled 
 warm weather comes on, with a hot sun, his occupa- 
 tion is gone. The plough should never be seen in- 
 eide the corn field after it is planted. 

Root crops of carrots and beets, may still be plant- 
 ed in rich, deep soil, and should be attended to at 
 once. Kuta Bagas a month later. Put in corn for 
 fodder, without fail, and turn to directions in Febru- 
 ary number of Farm Journal, by David Thomas, for 
 Bowing, harvesting and curing. It is the best article 
 which has been written. Plaster should be sown oc- 
 casionally over barn-yard, hog pen and stables. 

Place lumps of rock salt in field, so that cattle, 
 eheep and horses may have access to it, at pleasure. 

Latter part of this month, hay, particularly where 
 clover predominates may be cut. When the blosom 
 has assumed a brownish hu3 it is time to commence. 
 Hay should not be stirred often in the field, as its 
 quality is injured by too much drying. Salt spread 

over the mow, prevents danger from heating. A 
 good revolving horse rake, will render hand rakee 
 entirely unnecessary, and save time and labor. 

Fruii Orchard. — During this and beginning of 
 next month, is the time for regulating the heads of 
 fruit trees, by pinching off the terminal bud,or short- 
 ening, in process. The shape of trees is thus under 
 perfect control. Thin off fruit where too abundant. 
 Mulch the surface of ground under trees, to keep it 
 damp, and preserve an even temperature. Give at- 
 tention to caterpillars as before recommended. Save 
 your plums from the curculio, by tapping the tree 
 suddenly with heavy blows with a mallet, every 
 morning,and catch them beneath in sheets spread for 
 the purpose. Try "the little Turk," with the coating 
 of white wash, applied to the fruit through a syringe, 
 or dusting the tree with air slacked lime. One of 
 our friends near West Chester, has succeeded well 
 for two or three seasons with these remedies. Such 
 fine fruit is well worthy the trouble of repeating the 
 application for a few times. The peach borer also 
 requires close attention this month, and cutting into 
 his hiding place in the bark just below the surface 
 of the ground — see article in present number. 

Thin out gooseberries and currants, where bushes 
 are too much loaded, and cover ground with salted 
 hay, to prevent mildew. Prune grape vines where 
 needed. The productiveness of strawberry beds may 
 be increased by an occasional watering between the 
 rows. 

Wash the bark of trees as before recommended, if 
 not already done. If of sluggish growth, dig in 
 well rotted manure, or guano. If any symptoms of 
 blight appear in pear trees, use the knife immediate- 
 ly, and cut off below the part affected. 

Vegetable Garden. — Most of the early crops of 
 lettuce, radishes, spinach, &o., being now past, the 
 ground should be cleared and prepared for late 
 beets and carrots. Take advantage of moist days for 
 planting out succession crops of cabbage. These 
 may occupy ground in paths of onion beds. Water 
 cauliflowers in dry weather, and draw up earth to 
 stems. Such as are advanced in flower, should 
 have the leaves bent down over them, to protect 
 them from the sun and rain. 

Thin out beets, carrots and parsnips. Stir fre- 
 quently and deeply with the hoe, and keep down all 
 weeds. Kidney beans may be planted, and beet 
 seed. Re-sow such seeds of brocoli, cauliflower, cab- 
 bage as have missed. 

Celery plants that have arrived at sufficient size 
 should be planted out for early crop. Dig a trench 
 spade deep, laying the earth equally on each side, 
 and fill in bottom about three inches deep, of well 
 rotted manure, incorporating it well with the soil. 
 Cut off the tops of plants, and also ends of roots, 
 before setting out, and then plant with dibble six 
 inches apart. Water well as soon as planted, and
