5. Scalded or Devonshire cream churned alone. 
 On the 24th oi May, 1807, the milk of four cows 

was drawn in the same vessel, passed through a 
 strainer, and then divided into five portions of sis 
 English pints each, which were placed in similar ba- 
 sins of earthenware, in a place, the temperature of 
 which ranged from 55° to 60° Fahr. 

Monday, 25th. — The temperature of the air was 
 very hot, 76°; but that of the milk-house, by constant 
 evaporation of water, was kept about 60°. 

Tuesday, 26th. — Thirty-nine hours after the milk 
 had been drawn from the cows it was removed from 
 below the cream of No. 1 and No. 3, by a syphon: the 
 cream from No. 1, and the milk and cream from No. 
 2, were immediately churned in glass vessels. 

No. 1. — Sweet cream churned alone. From pre- 
 vious trials it was found that the addition of cold 
 water to thick cream facilitated the separation of the 
 butter; half a pint of water was added to the cream, 
 the temperature of the mixture at the commencement 
 of churning was 62°. In fifteen minutes butter ap- 
 peared in grains; the churning was continued for 
 twelve minutes longer, or twenty-seven minutes in 
 all, when the temperature was found at 70°. The 
 butter was collected, but from the warmth of the 
 weather was very soft. It was put into cold water 
 until the next day, when it was worked and washed 
 in the usual way, and weighed 1386 grains. It was 
 of a good colour, and perfectly well flavored. 

No. 2. — Sweet milk and its ci'eam churned togeth- 
 er. The mixture of sweet milk and cream was 
 churned at the same time; though cold water was 
 added after one and a half hours' churning, no but- 
 ter was seen. The churning was continued three 
 hours without obtaining butter. 

No. 3. — Sour cream churned alone. On Thurs- 
 day, the 28th May, the cream of No. 3, which had 
 been separated on Tuesday, and placed in the milk- 
 house, was now slightly acid, and was churned after 
 half a pint of cold water had been added to it. In 
 twelve minutes butter appeared; and in eight min- 
 utes more had united into one mass. During the 
 churning the temperature of the cream had risen 
 from 54° to 63°. The butter when well washed and 
 worked, weighed 1756.5 grains; the color and taste 
 were good. 

No. 4. — Sour milk and its cream churned together. 
 On the same day, 28th May, the milk and cream 
 churned together, and half a pint of cold water was 
 added. It was full fifty-seven minutes before any 
 butter appeared, and before the churning appeared 
 to be completed one hour and fifty minutes had elaps- 
 ed; showing clearly that more time is required to 
 churn milk and cream together than to obtain the 
 butter from cream alone. The butter was diffused 
 in small grains, and when washed and worked as 
 long as any color was communicated to the water, it 
 weighed 1968 grains; color paler than the last, but 
 of good flavor. 

No. 5. — Clouted cream churned alone. On Tues- 
 day, the 26th, the milk and cream of No. 5, were 
 placed in a vessel of warm water until the tempera- 
 ture of the milk rose to 156°, a Devonshire dairy- 
 maid assisting in the operation. The milk was drawn 
 from below the cream by a syphon, the latter being 
 kept cool until the following day, when it was 
 churned. 

It was ascertained that by churning the milk of 
 Nos. 1 and 3, a few more grains of butter could be 

obtained on some occasions, but on no occasion from 
 No. 5, so completely does the scalding process sepa- 
 rate the butyraceous matter from the milk. The 
 butter of No. 5, when well worked and washed, 
 weighed 1998 grains. It had a rich yellow color, 
 and tasted agreeably. 

Similar experiments were repeated, the result of 
 which was, that the largest amount of butter was 
 produced by the Devonshire method; the next in 
 quantity, by churning the milk and cream together 
 when a little acescent; the third in quantity was af- 
 forded by cream kept till it was slightly sour. The 
 smallest quantity was obtained from sweet cream; 
 but on no occasion was butter obtained by churning 
 sweet milk alone. 

In order to decide on the keeping qualities of the 
 butter obtained by the four processes previously de- 
 tailed, samples were exposed to the free action of the 
 atmosphere. 

No. 1 was always found to remain longer without 
 any rancid taste than the other kinds. 

Nos. 3 and 4 were nearly on an equality — if any 
 difference, it was in favor of No. 3. 

No. 5 became rancid more quickly than No. 3 and 
 No. 4. 

When salted for keeping, rancidity appeared in 
 about the same order, commencing in No. 5, or the 
 butter from scalded cream; next in No. 4, from some 
 milk and cream, then in No. 3, or sour cream; and 
 lastly, in No. 1, obtained from sweet cream. The 
 rancidity was supposed to arise from varying pro- 
 portions of casein; and on instituting experiments to 
 ascertain this fact.it was found that casein assisted in 
 preserving its freshness. 

In order to ascertain the effects of overchuming, 
 the cream of six pints of milk was separated by a 
 syphon, and churned in a glass vessel. The butter 
 was formed in about half an hour; but the churning 
 was continued for half an hour longer, when the but- 
 ler had lost its fine, yellowish, waxy appearance, and 
 had become pale and soft, while very little liquid re- 
 mained in the churn. This butter could not be 
 washed and worked until it had remained some hours 
 in cold water, being so exceedingly soft when taken 
 out of the churn. After washing it was pale, rather 
 soft, and weighed 2566 grains, which was evidently 
 beyond the due quantity, when compared with the 
 other experiments on the same quantity of milk,which 
 gave the following results: — 

No. 1. The sweet cream overchurned yielded 2566 
 grains. 

No. 3. The acid cream duly churned yielded 2187.5 
 grains. 

No. 4. The acid milk and its cream duly churned 
 yielded 2397.5 grains. 

No. 5. Scalded cream duly churned yielded 267 1 
 grains. 

The butter of No. 1 tasted insipid, never became 
 firm, and soon turned rancid. It was found to yield 
 a very unusual quantity both of casein and watery 
 fluid, which could only be separated by melting the 
 butter. 

It is a common opinion in some districts, that by 
 adding hot water to the churn, more butter is obtaind 
 than by using cold water. Experiments made for 
 the express purpose did not show that the weight in- 
 creased very much, and it was attended with a per- 
 ceptible deterioration in quantity, giving it general- 
 ly the appearance of overchuming. 

The results of the experiments above detailed are — 

1st. That the addition of some cold water, during 
 churning, facilitates the process, or the separation of
