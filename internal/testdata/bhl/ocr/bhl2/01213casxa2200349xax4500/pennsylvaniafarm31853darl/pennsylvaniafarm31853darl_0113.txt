THE PRODUCTION OF BUTTER— TO PRESERVE EGGS, &c.

the butter, especially when the croam is thick and 
 the weather hot. 

2(J. That cream alone is more easily churned than 
 a mixture of cream and milk. 

3d. That butter produced from sweet cream has 
 the finest flavor when fresh, and appears to remain 
 the longest period without becoming rancid. 

4th. That scalded cream, or the Devonshire meth- 
 od, yields the largest quantity of butter; but if in- 
 tended to be salted is most liable to acquire a rancid 
 flavor by keeping. 

5th. That churning the milk and cream together, 
 after they have become slightly acid, is the most eco- 
 nomical process for districts where butter-milk can 
 be sold; whilst at the same time it yields a large 
 amount of excellent butter. 

The preeeeding experiments are instructive as 
 showing the most judicious form in wliioh milk and 
 its products ought to exist previous to churning, 
 they are, however, defective in one imp. irtant partic- 
 ular, viz; the effect of temperature on churning; for 
 this I must refer to the experiments of L>r. John Bar- 
 clay and Mr. Alexander Allen, commenced on the 
 18th Ausust, 1823: 

1st Experiment. — Fifteen gallons of cream were 
 put into the churn at the temperature of 50°, the 
 weight per gallon having been previously ascertained 
 to be 8 lbs. 4 oxs. By agitating the cream in the 
 usual manner for the space of two hours, the tem- 
 Tierature rose to 5t>°; at the end of churning, being 
 four hours from the commencement of the operation, 
 the temperature was found to be 00°, or 10° higher 
 than at the commencement. The quantity of but- 
 ter obtained in this process was 29A lbs. avoirdupois, 
 or nearly 2 lbs, butter for each gallon of cream put 
 into th« churn. The butter was of the best quality. 

2d Experiment, 2C'th August, 1823. — Fifteen gall- 
 ons of cream were put into the churn at the temper- 
 ature of °55, the weight per g.allon being 8 lbs. 2 ozs. 
 By agitating the cream, as formerly, fur one hour 
 and a half, the temperature rose to 60°; at the end 
 of churning, being three hours and filtcen miautes 
 from the commencement of the operation, the tem- 
 perature was ascertained to have increased to 05°, or 
 10° higher than at the commencement. The yield 
 of butter was 29 lbs, 4 ozs., of good quality, not sen- 
 sibly inferior to that .obtained in the furmtT experi- 
 ment. 

3d. Experiment, 29th August, 1823.— Fifteen gall- 
 ons of cream were put into the churn at a tempera- 
 ture of 58°, the weight per gallon being Slbs. 2 oz.s. 
 At the end of an hour's churning the temperature 
 had riseR to 03°, and at the end of thepr.)cess, which 
 lasted three hours, the temperature was f mnd to be 
 67°, or 9° higher than at the commencement. The 
 quantity ef butter obtained was 28 lbs., and was 
 slightly inferior in quality to the butter produced in 
 the two previous experiments. 

4th Experiment, 4th September, 1823. — The same 
 quantity of cream was employed as in the former ex- 
 periments, the temperfiture being 60°, and the weight 
 per gallon 8 lbs. 1 oz. During the process the tem- 
 perature increased as formerly, and at the end of 
 three hours, when the operation was finished, it was 
 ascertained to have risen to 08°. Tlie quantity of 
 butter obtained was 27 Ib.s., of a quality simihir to 
 that obtained in the last recited experiment. 
 _5th Experiment, 9th September, 1X23. — A like quan- 
 tity of cream was used at the temperature uf 00°, 
 and_ the weight per gallon 8 lbs. The churning oc- 
 cupied two hours and a half, at the expiration of 
 which the temperature was found to have risen to 
 75°, being an increase of 9°. 25 lbs. 8 ozs. of butter 

were obtained by this experiment, of a character 
 much inferior to that produced in any of the former 
 experiments, being soft .and spongy

To Preserve Eggs. 

Some of your correspondents inquire .about the 
 best method of keeping eggs fresh; and as we have 
 apian here which I have not seen mentioned in any 
 of the replies which have been given to these inqui- 
 ries, I send it to you, particu'ariy as I find it better 
 than any I have seen mentioned: — Take half inch 
 board of any convenient length and breaclth, and 
 pierce it as full of holes (each Ij inch in diameter) 
 as you can, without risking the breaking of one hole 
 into another — I find that a bo.ard of two feet six in- 
 ches in length, and one foot board, has five dozen in 
 it, say twelve rows of five each; then take four strips 
 of the same board of two inches broad, and nail 
 them together edgewise into a rectangular frame of 
 the same size as your board; nail the board upon the 
 frame, and the work is done, unless you choose, for 
 the sake of appearances, to nail a beading of three- 
 quarters inch round the board on the top; this looks 
 better, and sometimes may prevent .an egg from roll- 
 ing :ff. Put your eggs in this board its they come 
 in from the poultry-house, the small end down, and 
 they will keep good for six months, if you take the 
 following precautions: — Take care that the eggs do 
 not got wet either in the nest or afterwards; (in sum- 
 mer, hens are fond of laying among the nettles or 
 long grass, and any eggs taken from such nests in 
 wet weather, should be put away for immediate use;) 
 keep them in a cool room in summer, and out of the 
 re.ach of frost in winter, and then, I think, the party 
 trying the experiment will have abundant reason to 
 be satisfied with it: 

I find there are some in my larder which I am as- 
 sured have been there nearer eight months than six, 
 and which are still perfectly fresh and good; in fact, 
 it is the practice here to accumul.ate a large stock of 
 eggs in August, September and October, which last 
 until after the fowls have begun to lay in the spring. 
 If two boards are kept, one can lie filling, and tlie 
 other emptying at the same time. Tliis is an exceed- 
 ingly good plan for those persons who keep a, few 
 fowls for the supply of eggs to their own family; but 
 would, perhaps, not do so well for those who keep a 
 large stock of hens, as it would take up too much 
 room. 

I have endeavored to account for the admirable 
 way in which eggs keep in this manner, by suppos- 
 ing that the yolk floats more equally in the white, 
 and has less tendency to sink down to the shell, than 
 when the egg is laid on one side; certainly if the yolk 
 reaches the shell, the egg spoils immediately.

their opinion ? — [English Agricultural Gazette.

This is to be lield at Lafayette, on the 11th, 12th 
 and 13th days of October. This point is aocessilde 
 by canals and r.ailroad. Among the premiums oll'er- 
 ed are six silver pitchers, valued at §33 each: tliirty- 
 five silver cups, valued at $15 each; seventy-five sil- 
 ver cups, valued at $10 each; thirty sets of tea-spoons, 
 valued at $5 each; and a large number of premium-^, 
 consisting of cash, agricultural works, books, diplo- 
 mas, &c. The competition for the silver pitchers 
 will be among the cultivators of wheat and corn, aud 
 the owners of cattle, horses, jacks and bogs.
