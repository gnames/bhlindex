NEW EVERGREEN— STRAWBERRY QUESTION, &e. 

[July 

New Evergreen. 

We have received, enclosed in a letter from our 
 friend John King, McKean county, Pa., a specimen 
 twig of the Evergreen shrub, about which there has 
 been considerable enquiry in the Farm Journal. It 
 is without doubt the American Yew, Taxus Canaden- 
 sis. Its usual height is two to four feet; leaves half 
 an inch to three-fourths in length, smooth, entire, 
 green on both sides, narrowed at base to a very short 
 petiole. It is more straggling in growth, and we 
 think not so handsome either in color or habit, as the 
 English Yew, Taxus Baccata,which retains its green- 
 ness through tlio winter much better. 

This specimen should have been acknowledged 
 sooner, but the letter was accidentally mislaid. 

Strawberry Question. 

We invite attention to the article in the present 
 number, on what has been very undeservedly mag- 
 nified into '■o/*" of the great questions of the day." 
 We have entertained these views for many years. 
 The high s<iurce from which the article emanates, 
 entirely supersedes anyi-emarks of ours. This "straw- 
 berry question," so called, has always seemed to us 
 one of the most simple, a mere matter of fact, and it 
 has been a matter of wonderment, that so much 
 should ha,ve been said and written, and such formi- 
 dable resolutions passed, on what is at last comprised 
 within the limits of a mere nut-shell. 

TjH Clover. 

We have been furnished with a sample of clover, 
 grown on the farm of Mr. Wickersham, near Phila" 
 delphia, which, on measuring, we find to bo three 
 feet in height. 

This indicates a deep soil, and good farming. We 
 presume there must be a subsoil-plough somewhere 
 in that neighborhood. *

Hints about Harness. 

For several years past, we have adopted the fol- 
 lowing plan of treating carriage harness, with so 
 much comfort and success, that we have concluded 
 to recommend it to you for working and carriage har- 
 ness. 

The whole thing may bo comiirised in a few words. 
 With hot water, soap, brushes, and scrapers, make 
 your harness perfectly clean. Next saturate with 
 oil; lastly, a weather-proof elastic polish and blacken- 
 ing. 

For your information, we detail to you how to go 
 about accomplishing these results. Select some af- 
 ternoon with a pro.ipect of a fair day following. 
 Take your harness and take it to pieces, as far as 
 you can unbuckle it. Put them into a tub or barrel, 
 and pour boiling soap suds over them, and let them 
 stand all night. In the morning, take a stiff brush, 
 or corn cobs, or something else of the same sort, and 
 with a smooth board in place of a wash-board, with 
 fresh water and soap, rub the coat of grease and dirt 
 off each side of the leather. Sometimes it is neces- 
 sary to use a dull old knife to scrape with. Pass 
 each strap through a second clean water, and hang 
 up on a line, exposed to the sun. As soon as they 
 begin to dry, begin to oil them. Neatsfoot oil is the 
 best, but fish oil will do very well. Make a brush 
 by rubbing some flannel round a stick, and tying it 
 with thread, dip this in the oil, and pass over both 
 sides. As it dries in, go over over them again and 
 again, until they will absorb no more oil. Let them 
 stay out over night. 

In the morning, if they are all soft and pliable, you 
 may proceed to apply varnish. If not, put on more 
 oil until they do get soft and pliable. 

The polish is made as follows: — Take a pint of fish 
 or neatsfoot oil, add four ounces of beeswax, four 
 ounces clean beef tallow, one ounce rosin, and one 
 ounce of lampblack; melt — when melted, add about 
 two table-spoonfuls of turpentine, and with flannel 
 cloths commence rubbing the harness both sides, 
 draw the straps through and through the flannel. 
 The polish must be applied warm as the hands can 
 bear it. Let your harness hang out one night. Take 
 warm water and soap and wash all the black off, 
 which will come off with sponge or cloths. Hang 
 up, and in an hour or so, you can buckle together 
 again, and it is fit for use. You will now have soft 
 harness, with a dull shiny jet black surface, which 
 will keep so for a whole year, if you put oil enough 
 on them to render them as soft as woollen cloth. 
 They will retain this dull shiny black all summer, 
 and mud will never stay on long after it is dry. 

Any person who will treat his harness so, once 
 a year, will never regret the trouble. 

If they need repairing, either do it yourselves, or 
 have it done before the spring work comes on. — [Ex-
