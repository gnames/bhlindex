For tlio Farm Journal. 
 The MecUaiilcal Eflects of time. 
 I am happy to find that the attention of the farm- 
 ing community is being turned to the ipjportant sub- 
 ject of the effects produced by lime, when used as 
 a fertilizer, and that my letters published in the 
 Journal, have been instrumental in awakening such 
 interest, and calling into the field such able commen- 
 tators on this most important subject. 

In the March number, I endeavored, to the best 
 of my poor ability, to explain my views in regard to 
 the generally received opinion of the mechanical 
 effects of lime. I perceive that the able writer whose 
 article appeared in the May number, over the initials 
 J. II. B., has not fully understood the position taken, 
 or intended to be taken by myself on the subject. 
 My readers will excuse me for again going some- 
 what over the same ground, when I say to them, that 
 I am convinced, that the commentator is possessed of 
 more than ordinary perspicacity, and that my mean- 
 ing must be very obscurely expressed, else he could 
 not have fallen into so much error. 

By reference to the article in question, it may how- 
 ever without difficulty be perceived, that I have drawn 
 aline between thechomieal, and thepurely mechanical 
 effects of lime. This distinction is very important, and 
 must be constantly borne in mind. I do not include 
 among the mechanical effects of lime, such as are of 
 a secondary character. For instance: That lime 
 when judiciously applied increases the fertility of the 
 soil, and such increased fertility causes the soil to 
 contain a larger proportion of vegetable matter un- 
 dergoing oremacausis, as well as carbon, and thus 
 indirectly renders the soil more pulverulent. I 
 do not allude to any but direct mechanical effects, 
 produced by the force exerted by the lime. That the 
 force should be produced by some chemical property 
 of the lime is no objection, provided it is exerted di- 
 rectly, and not as a secondary result, and that the 
 effect be mechanical. 

The learned commentator seems to have imbibed 
 the impression (doubtless owing to my clumsy man- 
 ner of expressing ray meaning) that the carbonic 
 acid to which I have attributed the mellowing of the 
 soil, is the product of the vegetable portion of the 
 soil. But such is not my meaning when rightly in- 
 terpreted. I have endeavored to express myself as 
 plainly as possible, as to the derivation of this acid 
 from the carbonate of lime. My intention was to be 
 understood to say that, Caustic lime applied to the 
 soil speedily becomes saturated with some acid. If 
 the soil contains any vegetable acids, they speedily 
 combine with the lime. If the soil contains any 
 considerable quantity of manure or other vegetable 
 matter undergoing decay, it will obtain carbonic acid 
 from that source. If the soil is not too compact, it 
 will obtain some from the atmosphere. Lime should, 
 however, be applied as a carbonate, which can easi- 

ly be effected by spreading it on the surface sufficient- 
 ly long before ploughing in. The acids which are 
 formed from the decomposition of the vegetable mat- 
 ter contained in the soil, are capable of decomposing 
 the carbonate of lime. â€¢ These acids are soluble, and 
 by the aid of water are capable of penetrating all 
 portions of the heaviest soil. If a heavy soil con- 
 tains carbonate of lime, the vegetable acids will lib- 
 erate the carbonic acid, and it is the coming into sep- 
 arate existence of this carbonic acid, occupying, as 
 it will, much more space, that disintegrates the soil. 
 I do not pretend to say that this carbonic acid will 
 remain in the soil, in an uncombinod state any con- 
 siderable length of time. When a loaf of bread is 
 baked, no. carbonic acid remains in the cells formed 
 by the fermentation, but the cells remain. The great 
 object has been attained, the tenacity of the soil has 
 been overcome, and generally it will not become hard 
 again, until the crop is so far ahead as not to be 
 much affected by it. Besides whiiih, in warm weath- 
 er, this phenomena is constantly going on to some 
 exteLt, provided the ground is not too dry. 

Professor Mapes pretends to make a distinction, 
 between the mechanical effects of lime on the differ- 
 ent sandy soils, and says, that when the grains of 
 sand arc round, it renders the soil more loose. He 
 attributes the mechanical effect to a chemical action. 
 If any such chemical action could take place, it 
 might be a matter of opinion as to what would be 
 the mechanical effect: But I contend that the learn- 
 ed Professor is in error in this particular. He at- 
 tributes it to the action of the lime, on the silex, and 
 the consequent corroding of the polished surfixce of 
 the sand. Here we are at issue. I contend that no 
 such chemical phenomena will take place. No chem- 
 ist has (to my knowledge) been able to demonstrate 
 that caustic lime at the ordinary temperature, will 
 combine with silex. True, lime in sufficient quant - 
 ties, made into a cement with sand, will become hard 
 and cause bricks and stones to adhere together, but 
 when this mortar is subjected to the action of any 
 of the feeble acids, which will make soluble salts of 
 lime, it may be entirely separated from the silex, 
 and the latter will be precipitated. It has been 
 said that water in which lime is held in solution, 
 being passed through a long column of sand, will 
 deposit the lime and pass out pure; but no one has 
 pretended to say, that it will be found combined, and 
 a silicate of lime be formed. 

The learned Professor also distinctly asserts, that 
 some sandy soils are loosened, and some are render- 
 ed more compact by the application of lime, and at- 
 tributes this difference to the shape of the particles 
 of the sand. Ho also without reserve lays it down 
 distinctly, that sulphate of lime (plaster) renders a 
 sandy soil more compact by means of its property of 
 attaching particles. When we reflect on the small 
 proportion in which plaster is applied to the soil, and
