navigation, and which would particularly affect the 
 price of oils, and raise them. 

In the article of oils, the prices would rise immeas- 
 ureably, not having as yet established the cultiva- 
 tion of plants, to supply us with this, an article of 
 the first necessity. 

We may then, and that at a profit of manifest ad- 
 vantage, establish among us the cultivation of a most 
 valuable plant, for which the soil and climate of this 
 country are favorable. 

Any one desirious to make a trial with one acre or 
 more, can obtain the seeds, either of tha Spring or 
 Winter Rape, from me, either of D. Landreth, 65 
 Chestnut street ; C. B. Rogers, 29, Market street, or 
 Paschall Morris & Co., 380 Market street. Philadel- 
 phia, at 25 cents per pound; at either of which pla- 
 ces I may be addressed. 

Any other information as regards the manipula- 
 tion, the produce in gallons, or bushels, the fitting 
 up an oil mill, and process of manufacturing the oil 
 from the seeds, I will impart to applicants for a mod- 
 erate and reasonable compensation. 

As has been shown, the raising of Rape Seed is 
 very profitable when carefully attended to; the man- 
 ufacturing the seed into oil is not less so, so that to 
 a certain degree, combining the two together, can not 
 fail to be highly remunerative, and as worthy the at- 
 tention of the capitalist as any agricultural product 
 with which we are acquainted.

^ The Farm Journal is grow- 
 ing rapidly in public estimation, and I am happy to 
 believe that the community generally in this region, 
 are more duly appreciating those publications which 
 are devoted to the science of agriculture. 

We have in Pennsylvania ample facilities for ma- 
 king our land worth, on an average, $200 per acre, 
 and^ yet there are but few of us who would not 
 willingly sell for less than half that price, and "go 
 West," where land may be had at a mere nominal 
 value. But the present generation will not pass 
 away until the price of land will be estimated differ- 
 ently. The present "era of progress" tends so rap- 
 idly to developethe agricultural resources of the coun- 
 try,— and science is shedding so much light upon 
 the labors of the husbandman, that his occupation is 
 no longer looked upon as menial; and when there 
 shall be a combination of Yankee ingenuity with 
 German industry, not many years will elapse before 
 t!ie cultivation of the soil will bo esteemed both the 
 most honorable and profitable employment among 
 men . * * * * H. M.

 Gapes lu Chickens. 
 To the Editor of the Farm .Journal — Can you give 
 any account of, or remedy for gapes in chickens, 
 which, if not arrested, bids fair to destroy the best 
 half of my young poultry. Improved as well as 
 the common breed are all equally attacked, and die 
 in a short time afterwards. Any information through 
 your valuable journal, will confer a favor on several 
 of your subscribers in this section of the State.

In reply to our correspondent, we give an engra- 
 ving of the worms magnified, which are generally be- 
 lieved to cause the disease in poultry, called gapes. 
 The most simple and effectual remedy we know of, 
 is to make a loop of horse hair, and introduce it 
 down the wind-pipe of the young chicken, when, by 
 twisting the loop a few times, the worms can be very 
 readily drawn out. We have seen this process tried, 
 and with great success. In Bement's Poultry Book, 
 is a communication from C. F. Morton, and con- 
 taing some valuable suggestions, which we copy be- 
 low. 

From all I have seen and heard on the subject of 
 what is called the gapes in the chickens, it is a dis- 
 ease which is not generally understood, I shall, 
 therefore, give you my opinion on its nature and cure. 
 This spring, having my chickens attacked as usual 
 w ith the gapes, I dissected one that died, and found 
 its bronchus, or windpipe (not the throat,) filled with 
 small red worms from half to three-quarters of an 
 inch long. This satisfied me that any particular 
 course of feeding or medicine given would not reach 
 the disease. I therefore took a quill from a hen's wing,
