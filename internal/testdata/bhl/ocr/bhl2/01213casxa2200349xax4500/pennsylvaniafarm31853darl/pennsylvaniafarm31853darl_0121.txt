striped off the feathers within an inch and a half of 
 the end, trimmed it off with a scissors to about half 
 an inch wide, pointing it at the lower end. I then 
 tied the ends of the wings to the legs of the chicken 
 affected, to prevent its struggling; placed its legs be- 
 tween my knees ; held its tongue between the 
 thumb and fore-finger of the left hand, and with the 
 right, inserted the trimmed feather in the windpipe, 
 (the opening of which lies at the root of the tongue;) 
 when the chicken opened it to breathe, pushed it 
 down gently as far as it would go, (which is where 
 the windpipe branches off to the lobes of the lungs, 
 below which I have never detected the insgct,) and 
 twisted it round as I pulled it out, which would gen- 
 erally bring up or loosen all the worms, so that the 
 chicken would cough them out; if not I would repeat 
 the operation till all were ejected, amounting general- 
 ly to a dozen: then release the chicken, and in the 
 course of ten minutes it would eat heartily, although 
 previous to the operation it was unable to swallow, 
 and its crop would be empty unless filled with some 
 indigestible food. In this manner I lost but two out 
 of forly chickens operated on; one by its coughing 
 up a bunch of the worms which stuck in the orifice 
 of the windpipe and strangled it — the other appa- 
 rently recovered, but died several days after in the 
 morning. In the afternoon, upon examining its 
 windpipe, I found a female worm in it, differing from 
 the others by branching off at the tail in a number 
 of roots or branches, between each of which were 
 tubes filled with hundreds of eggs, like the spawn of 
 a fish, and although the chicken died in the morning, 
 the worm was perfectly alive in the afternoon, and 
 continued so for half an hour in warm water. While 
 I was examining it in a concave glass under a micro- 
 scope, it ejected one of its eggs, in the centre of which 
 was an insect in embryo. 

From this fact, I have come to the conclusion, that 
 when the female worm breeds in the chicken and 
 kills it, these hundreds of eggs hatch out in its putrid 
 body in some very minute worms, which, probably 
 after remaining in that state during the winter, 
 change in the spring to a fly, which deposits its eggs 
 on the nostril of the chicken, from whence they are 
 inhaled and h.atched out in the windpipe, and become 
 the worms which I have described. 

There is one fact connected with this disease — that 
 it is only old hen-roosts that are subject to it; and 1 
 am of opinion, that where it prevails, if the chicken- 
 houses and coops were kept clean and frequently 
 white-washed with thin white-wash, with plenty of 
 salt or brine mixed with it, and those chickens that 
 take the disease, operated on and cured, or, if they 
 should die, have them burned up or so destroyed, that 
 the eggs of the worms would not hatch out, that the 
 disease would be eradicated. 

I am also satisfied that the chicken has not the 
 disease when first hatched; several broods that I car- 
 ried and kept at a distance from the chicken-house 
 where the disease prevailed, were entirely exempt. 
 And chickens hatched from my eggs where they had 
 never been troubled with this disease, were perfectly 
 free from it; and a neighbor of mine who built in the 
 woods half a mile from any dwelling, and has raised 
 fowls for six or seven years past, and has frequently 
 Bet my eggs, has never had the gapes among his 
 chickens. 

AVith my first brood of chickens, there was not 
 one escaped the gapes. But all that have been hatch- 
 ed since I had the chicken-house and coops well 
 white-washed inside and out, with thin white-wash, 
 with plenty of brine in it, and kept clean, have been 

exempt from the disease, with occasionally an excep- 
 tion of one or two chickens out of a brood. 

In operating on tlie chickens, although one person 
 can effect it, it is much easier done to have one to 
 hold the tongue of the chicken while the other pass- 
 es the feather down its windpipe, and by having a 
 small piece of muslin between the fingers, it will pre- 
 vent the tongue from slipping, which it is apt to do 
 upon repeating the operation. 

Accompanying this, I send you drawings of the 
 gape worms in their natural size, and as they appear 
 when magnified. No. I are the male worms, and No. 
 2 the female: you will observe the heads of both male 
 and female branch off in two trunks with suckers 
 like leeches at the extremities of the trunks, one 
 trunk longer and thinner than the other. The intes- 
 tines extend from the branching of the trunks down- 
 wards towards the tail, and are perfectly apparent 
 when magnified. The female branches off like the 
 roots of a tree at the tail, with intermediate tubes 
 filled with small oval eggs.

 The Fly In the Wheat— vs. Seed Grain. 

J. L. Darlington, Esq. 

Dear Sir — This peculiar 

disease has ravaged our wheat fields to an enormous 

extent. The farmers in the adjoining counties enter 

the same complaint, some expecting one-half a crop, 

whilst others will be glad if they only get the seed. 

During the month of April, and beginning of May, 

our fields, with a few exceptions, promised a fair 

crop; when about the 20th of May, a storm arose 

breaking half or more of the stalks down, when 

first our attention was directed as to the cause of such 

a break. 

It will be seen, by close examination, that t'le dc. 
 position of the ova or eggs are generally formed 
 above the second joint, from three to eight in num. 
 ber, of a vermicular shape; the breach of the straw 
 invariably occurs at this spot, for the very great reas- 
 on that this deposition weakens the straw. The col- 
 or of these beings differ, some being black, others 
 brown, and a few white, and what seems stranger 
 still, it appears as if the latter named had a dark 
 vermicular being deeply embedded in its bowels. By 
 placing such a one under the microscope, it will be 
 seen that really the living being is only covered with 
 a sac or membrane, and that this covering gives the 
 variance in color. AVe have deposited a few of these 
 anomalous creatures safely to see what may become 
 of them, of which we will apprise our readers, if 
 success attends our experiment. Such, in our opin- 
 ion, is the nature of this malady. 

Now, as to the cause we are ignorant. Some as- 
 sert that a certain fly deposits the egg in the fall, 
 and in time and season it comes to maturity. This we 
 rather doubt for the rudiments of the stalk are very 
 imperfect in the fall, and more than this, we see this 
 deposit in such fields, which by the late sowing, as
