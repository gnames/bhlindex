sumed only the incipient stages of germination be- 
 fore the winter's blast. 

Is the deposite made in the Spring ? This we also 
 doubt; fur we well know that the sprouting of grain 
 will often take place, whei really insects are yet in 
 a torpid state, and should this deposit occur af- 
 ter this, we doubt very much whether the injury to 
 the stalk could be as extensive, thus carly,as it really 
 is. 
 AVe are thus led to believe that the error lays in the 
 seed grain. 1st. From the very curious fact that 
 fields belonging to different farmers in the immedi- 
 ate vicinity are differently effected. We know fields 
 where, in the one no disease is known, whilst on 
 another farm the field perhaps joining, the grain is 
 enormously injured. 2d. We never see the depo- 
 sition in the rye, even in such a field, when plenty 
 of rye is intermixed. We may thus very safely con- 
 clude that the cause may be looked for in ilie grain of 
 the wheat 2>rior to sowing. 

We should be glad to hear the opinion of others, 
 on this obscure yet wide spread disease.

 Breeding Milk Cows. 

On reading an article in the last number of the 
 Farm Journal, giving notice of E. P. Prentice's Ayr- 
 shire bull, "Dundee," I felt called upon to make a 
 few remarks, and if worthy a place in your columns, 
 you may use them. 

There has been much said and written by breeders 
 of diffei-ent kinds of stock for the dairy. Durhams, 
 Devons, Ayrshires, Alderney's, &o., have all had 
 their advocates, and there are individual cases where 
 as much butter has been made from one kind as 
 another. 

So far as I understand the matter, if the Ayrshires 
 are what they are said to be, a cross between the 
 Durham and Alderuey, they are very near right, if 
 bred on the principle laid down by "Neftlin," for the 
 Durhams give the quantity, while the Alderney adds 
 to the quality and that is the end to be arrived at, the 
 largest quantity and best quality. 

I know of no nicer milk or butter, than is given and 
 made from a pure Alderney cow, and I think a cross 
 with a good Alderney bull would help our stock in 
 this neighborliood very much, in this age of twelve 
 and fourteen pounders. But it is useless to cross a 
 good cow of any breed with an indifferent bull, ex- 
 pecting to get good stock. I believe it has never 
 been done. 

The best cows are generally marked No. 1, in 
 Guenon's system, and should be put to the best bulls; 
 raise a bull calf; breed him to other cows of the best 
 quality, and then a breed that cannot be excelled 
 may be got up — it matters not what the name may 
 be, for 1 hold it of no importance what name, or 

country they come from, if the quality and quantity 
 are right. 

A LEARNER. 
 Chester county, Pa., 6th mo. 8th, '53. 

The above article, although signed "a learner," 
 was written by one who is better posted up than 
 most, on all matters relative to deep milkers, and has 
 given that subject much attention for several years, 
 with a view to fix some certain standard of selection 
 for dairymen. The district of country within thir- 
 ty miles of Philadelphia, and especially the dairies 
 in Chester and Delaware coundes, have made the ex- 
 cellence of its fresh butter proverbial. As her pop- 
 ulation increases, we find grazing and feeding cattle, 
 anl grain growing, gradually being abandoned to 
 farmers more remote. Dairy products must hereaf- 
 ter be the chief business of the farmer, within the 
 above limits, and to them as well as those in other 
 parts of the State, it is important to keep only the 
 most productive cows, and to understand the true 
 principles of breeding them. Guenon's marks are a 
 pretty sure guide. They are to be considered mere- 
 ly as evidences of the milking quality, or the contrary, 
 and as has been observed, are found to some extent 
 in each of our well known breeds. Which one most 
 invariably has them, is still a question. Only such 
 individuals, however, no matter what the breed, 
 should be retained. Although opposed to indiscrim- 
 inate crossing, of distinct breeds, which often results 
 in a race of mongrels of no established or permanent 
 character,we should suppose a cross between the Dur. 
 ham cow and Alderney bull, well worth a trial. A 
 fine opportunity is now offered to the farmers in this 
 section, to make use of a pure Alderney bull, owned 
 by our friend John AVorth, of East Bradford, who by 
 the way is becoming widely known, as an eminent 
 and successful breeder of both sheep and cattle. 
 This bull, whose portrait we hope to have for a fu- 
 ture number of our Journal, has the property of 
 good handling, more than any animal we ever felt. 
 We anticipate great advantage to this neighborhood 
 from his use. In making such a cross, (as our old 
 friend. J. Pedder, noiv of the Boston Cultivator, used 
 so often to urge,) always commence with "dam the 
 besl." "The female should be the largest."

 Guauo on Turnips. 
 Mr. Editor: — 

As the time for sowing turnips is 
 near at hand, I will give you the result of an experi- 
 ment I tried last season upon this crop. About the 
 middle of July, I ploughed up one-third of an aero 
 of sod ground, having no mellow ground to spare, 
 upon which I sowed one bag (180 lbs.) of Peruvian 
 guano, mixed with its bulk of plaster. The ground 
 was ploughed as deep as my largest bar-share could 
 turn over, probably seven to eight inches, and har- 
 rowed over half a dozen or more times, till it was 
 perfectly mellow and pulverized down to the grass..
