Along side of this patch I ploughed another third of 
 an acre, and treated it in tho same way, except using 
 short barn-yard manure instead of guano. Both 
 patches of ground were sowed with the common red 
 top turnip on the same day, the later part of July, and 
 in the month of November the crop was gathered 
 with the following results: 

On the patch where the guano, was applied I took 
 up Ji/lecii cart loads, estimated at twenty bushels to 
 the load, they were not accurately measured, — and 
 on the other patch there were seven, cart loads — thus 
 showing more than two bushels to one in favor o- 
 guano. 

The difference of growth, all through the season 
 was a very marked one. The guano pushed tho 
 young plants ahead so rapidly, from the moment 
 they appeared above ground, that the fly had no 
 effect at all upon them; while on the other piateh, 
 where the growth was so much slower, the ravages of 
 this insect were quite perceptible. 

My experiment satisfied me that, for a crop of tur- 
 nips there is nothing equal to guano. D, M. C.

To TUE Editors of the Farm Journal — Like 
 yourselves, I put the enquiry (to one of the purest 
 members of the last House of Representatives, and 
 President of a county agricultural society,) why this 
 Institution was not called into existence, and was re- 
 plied that it had objectionable features, a view fully 
 agreeing with that entertained by me. 

In the report of the committee, and no doubt in 
 the frame of the bill, it is proposed that a certain 
 number of pupils he educated ijratuitously. 

If a bill ever passes to establish such school, with 
 this feature engrafted upon it, I hope to see the whole 
 a perfect failure. Such favoritism is beyond the days 
 of toleration, and justly so. Let all be kept alike, 
 and you may be certain, if you please none you will 
 offend none. Such favoritism is mostly thrown on 
 wrong persons. This is one reason whv the I'll did 
 not pass. Wltii tins leature omitted, I have no 
 doubt the next Legislature will pass a bill, to give us 
 what we ought to have had a number of years ago.

I should also be pleased to know from some good 
 authority; the origin of the so called "Chittagong" 
 fowl, and whether they may be considered a distinct 
 breed, or merely mongrels. 

My reasons for making this inquiry, is, that having 
 had them from what was and still is considered the 
 most reliable sources, I found their progeny to dis- 
 play as many colors as "Joseph's coat." 

I would further enquire in i-egard to the Chitta- 
 gongs, whether they are not merely a cross between 
 the Shanghai and the Bucks county or Booby fowl ? 

Again. Will any of your correspo- aunts enlight- 
 en me in regard to the "boobies ?" A gentleman of 
 tho highest respectability, informs me that some 
 twenty-five years since, a number of the Shanghai 
 fowls were imported by a Mr. Musser, (a physician 
 I think,) formerly an officer of the Customs in Phil- 
 adelphia, — that Mr. M. so soon as his stock increas- 
 ed, distributed them through various sections of 
 Bucks county, and that by crossing with the com- 
 mon "Dunghill," the present "Booby" breed, (if breed 
 you can call it,) was produced. 

Can any oue enlighten me a little further on this 
 subject ? S.

 A Few Q,uerie8 for Fowl Couuoiseurs. 

Mr. Editor: — 

Will you or some of your poultry 
 correspondents, have the kindness to inform me i 
 through the columns of the "Farm Journal," where- 
 in consists the difference between the Cochin China 
 and Shanghai fowls, or whether there is any differ- 
 ence except in name ? I am induced to make this 

request, after having examined a number of the stan- 
 dard works on poultry, and found that no two au- 1 enough for two yoke of oxen.

 To THE Editors of the Farm Journal: — 

A con- 
 trivance of one of my neighbors to set on cart wheels, 
 for the above purpose, I thought might be of service 
 to some of .your readers; if you think so, please in- 
 sert in tho Journal. 

Get four pieces of scantling, three by five inches, 
 and about three feet long, and pin them together in 
 a square form; let the back cross piece bo on the top 
 of the two side pieces, and the front cross piece un- 
 der them; let the two hind pins run through to the 
 extent of three or four inches, so that they may cor- 
 respond and enter what we call the eyes of the axle, 
 which are placed to fasten the bed on by its hocks. 
 The front cross piece should have two pins running 
 down near the middle to straddle the tongue, then 
 the frame will be kept to its place. 

Now get a gum stick for the windlass, from six to 
 eight inches in diameter, and a little longer than the 
 width of the frame, take it to the turners and get it 
 rounded and a journal at each end; bore a few holes 
 through it to insert crowbars to hoist by, and put a 
 hook in it for the chain, and it is readj' to be placed 
 on the frame. It should be put as near the axle as 
 possible. 

It appears to me to be a very simple affair, which 
 any farmer can make, may be [easily put on and ta- 
 ken off, and be rendered quite useful.
