does not allow the moisture beneath to exhale, and 
 it is thus rendered available for the use and nour- 
 ishment of plants. 

By passing the cultivator through a corn-field 
 once a week, the crop will bo secured against the 
 effects of drought much more eifectually than by any 
 other means that can possibly be adopted. As the 
 soil falls together, and becomes consolidated, the sup- 
 ply of moisture ascends by capillary attraction, and 
 escapes to the clouds. Every one must have noticed 
 this in solid land, and even in corn-hills, where, ow- 
 ing to a practice prevalent in some sections, and 
 which is almost invariably with those who till light, 
 sandy soils, the hoe is stamped down upon the soil 
 immediately over the corn in planting. The com- 
 pressed earth is always moist in the morning, while 
 the spaces between the hills remain dry, because un- 
 compressed. 

As the supply of moisture in the soil fails, the 
 mark of the hoe becomes less and leas apparent, and 
 finally no humidity is seen On digging down, it will 
 be perceived that the fluid is exhausted, while in the 
 spaces between the rows, where the surface has all the 
 time been light, and fine, and dry, there is moisture 
 ■enough within an inch of the surface. I have fre- 
 ■quently been surprised on observing the effects of this 
 on lands, and have alluded to it repeatedly in ray 
 communications to various papers, and in some in- 
 stance, not without benefit, I hope, to those for whose 
 especial enlightment they were intended. The culti- 
 vator, were it useles for every other purpose, which 
 it certainly is not, would be invaluable for the assis- 
 tance it renders in this. 

All crops require moisture. No matter how rich 
 the soil maybe in the elementary matters constitu- 
 ting the food of plants, water is necessary to render 
 those elements appropriable. They can be absorbed 
 and assimilated only in a state of solution, and water 
 is the only menstruum used in the laboratory of Na- 
 ture in accomplishing the object, or consummating 
 the phenomenon named. Wherever a crop appears 
 to languish and suffer for want of water, let the sur- 
 face be immediately stirred. Keep the cultivator 
 moving, and rest assured that its operations will 
 tend more to the benefit of your fields than any thing 
 save rain. — [Germantown Telegraph. 

A PRACTICAL FARMER. 
 Bald Eagle Farm, May 4, 1853. 

of lambs is about eighteen per cent, greater than his 
 total number of ewes, as about one-third of his flock 
 produces twins. We estimated the weight of this 
 flock at 160 lbs. each, which is a very heavy average 
 for breeding ewes, as nearly all of them parted with 
 their lambs in March. 

This strain of sheep is not as fine wooled as some 
 others, but carry very heavy fleeces,upon large strong 
 bodies, which make good mutton. Every part, even 
 the forehead and upper parts of the ears, is covered 
 with wool. 

Every importation of this kind is a blessing to 
 this country, which goes on multiplying itself, very 
 dififerently from some importations from the same 
 place. 

Many of these sheep were marked with figures in 
 India ink on the undersidi) of the ear, by which 
 number they are registered. The process is a very 
 simple one, easily and rapidly performed. The op- ' 
 erator has a set of numbers, three each, the face of 
 which are small points which will make slight punc- 
 tures in the skin, when pressed upon it. Suppose 
 the sheep to be marked is No. 721, he sets these fig- 
 ures in a pair of pincers, and then rubs a little pre- 
 pared ink, indigo, or Vermillion, on the smooth skin 
 of the ear, gives it a pinch, rubs it a moment with 
 his finger, and 721 is fixed upon that spot. Thus by 
 changing figures, with this simple little machine, a 
 sheep can be marked any number from 1 to 999, 888,- 
 000. A thing of so much importance, and so sim- 
 ple and cheap, cannot be too widely known.— [Agri-

New Importation of FreucU Merluos< 

The Humbolt on her last trip brought over 109 
 ewes and two bucks of these remarkable sheep, for 
 S. W. Jewett, of Middlebury, Vt. They are from 
 the celebrated flocks of M. M. Gilbert and Caynot, 
 whose farms they left on the 12th of April, reaching 
 Mr. Jewett's farm on the 1st of May. ;Mr. Jewett 
 informs us that they came into port in the finest con- 
 dition, having been well cared for on the passage, but 
 owing to a misunderstanding of his orders, they were 
 suffered to remain two days on the lower deck of the 
 Bhip in port, where for want of fresh air, which they 
 received by a wind sail while the ship was in motion, 
 two died on board, and we noticed one or two others 
 in a bad way: the remainder appeared remarkably 
 well. The cost of freight, $15 per head, and other 
 expenses, will make nearly as much more by the 
 time they reach their destination, where the owner \ 
 has upwards of 500 of previous importations, his 
 entire flock now consisting of this breed. 

In making sales, Mr. .Jewett pursues the same plan 
 of the French breeders, that is to get one or two 
 crops of lambs, and then sell the ewes. His yield

What a curious calculation it would be, to ascer- 
 tain the different amount of force required to drag a 
 loaded wagon with each of the different boxes sup- 
 plied with each of the different preparations in turn 
 now used for greasing them ! Every farmer knows 
 that a well greased wagon runs much easier than one 
 imperfectly greased,and different lubricating materials 
 have more or less beneficial effect, but no one seems 
 to know the precise mixture that ahotild be used. A 
 very slight diflerence in this material would save a 
 larger amount in the cost of the power used to trans- 
 port agricultural and other products, than has ever 
 been appropriated by the general government for the 
 benefit of agriculture. Stearine, one of the constit- 
 uents of fatty substances, is now made in large quan- 
 tities in Ohio and elsewhere, and is as hard as sper- 
 maceti, withstanding the sun's heat in summer, and 
 presenting at times a lubricating surface when heat- 
 ed and attaching itself firmly to surfaces. Might 
 not this material be mixed with grease, varving the 
 proportion according to the ye.ir, so at all times - to 
 secure the presence of a lubricating material more 
 lasting than the ordinary mixtures, and at an even- 
 tual cost scarcely greater, while its increased effici- 
 ency might render its use profitable. — [Working Far-
