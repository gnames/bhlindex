Chester County Horticultural Exhibition. 

The Chester County Horticultural and Industrial 
 Exhibition, usually held in June, oocured on the 10th, 
 17th and 18th ult. In addition to the fruits of the 
 season, flowers, green-house plants, vegetables, the 
 display embraced agricultural implements, leather 
 and coach-maker's work, carriages and harness, 
 drawings, paintings and sculpture, needle and fan- 
 cy work, cabinet work, dentistry, &c. Although the 
 contributions were not quite equal in amount to for- 
 mer seasons, the large Horticultural Hall of the So- 
 ciety was densely crowded with visitors, over four 
 thousand tickets being disposed of. The receipts 
 were over $500. 

Anincreased impulse is being given to Horticultural 
 as well as Agricultural improvement by these annu- 
 nual exhibitions, all over the country. The effect of 
 which will be and is seen, not only in an increased 
 production from the soil, but in those moral influen- 
 ces with which attention to these two great depart- 
 ments is always more or less connected. 

Our friends of Berks county have also attempted a 
 Horticultural Summer exhibition, for last month) 
 which we should be pleased to hear, succeeded to ex- 
 pectation. 

On two of the three days of exhibition at West 
 Chester, addresses were delivered by Elliot Cresson, 
 Esq., of Philadelphia. They were truly practical 
 and useful in tlieir character. Assuming the whole 
 debt of the country abroad, to be from three to five 
 hundred million of dollars," he urged the cultivation 
 of several staple articles adapted to our soil and cli- 
 mate, as a moans of reducing this amount, and ma- 
 king us more dependent on our own resources, such 
 as madder, rape, flax, osier willow, &c. The manu- 
 facture of paper from flax haulm, oil from the Span- 
 ish chesnut, and dye stuff irom the maclura were al- 
 so adverted to, and the speaker offered three premi- 
 ums of $10 each, as inducements to farmers, to com- 
 mence the culture of these articles. 

Some specimens of prepared willow twigs for bask, 
 ets, were exhibited by Isaac G. Darlington, which 
 appeared well adapted to the purpose. They were 
 of the variety Vitellina, which is much used in 
 Europe for baskets. It is found in several parts of 
 Chester county, and according to Dr. Darlington's 
 Flora Cestrioa, came originally from some wicker 
 work found sprouting in Dock creek, near Philadel- 
 phia, by Dr. Franklin, who took them out and gave 
 them to Chai-les Norris, by whom they were reared, 
 on grounds now the site of the Custom House, in 

Philadelphia.

Penuslyvanla Wool. 

Nearly the entire clip of AVool in Greene county, 
 has been already purchased at prices ranging from 
 forty to seventy-five cents per pound. The clip in 
 "Washington county is pretty generally purchased at 
 similar rates. 

Pennsylvania Horticultural Society. 

The twenty-fifth annual exhibition of this Soci- 
 ety, is to be held in Philadelphia, on the 21st, 2'2d, 
 and 23d of September next. We have been favored 
 with a printed schedule of premiums, embracing the 
 usual extensive list of floral designs and boquets, 
 fruits, flowers and vegetables. One of the premiums 
 strikes us as rather novel. "For the best twenty 
 plants from a private collection," a silver pitcher is 
 proposed to be "presented," of the value" of $200. 
 Thus far seemed very liberal, but on reading farther, 
 we find it is to be held by the owner, (not of the 
 pitcher;) but of the successful collection, for one 
 year, and to be yearly competed for; the donor's and 
 victors names to be engraved thereon. There is orig- 
 inality at least in t\ns prcmmm.

Rape Seed, Madder, >tec. 

We invite attention to tde article on cultivating 
 the rape, and which has been brought out by inqui- 
 ries in one of our former numbers. 

The writer has had very considerable experience 
 in the cultivation of this and the madder crop, on 
 the continent of Europe, and his information and as- 
 sistance will be very valuable to those who are about 
 to commepce their culture. We expect an article on 
 madder from him, for our next number. In the 
 mean time he wishes us to say, that July and Au- 
 gust are the proper time for planting out madder setf, 
 in a damp spell of weather, and that he has plants 
 for sale, which he will furnish to order, at the agri- 
 cultural warehouse and seed store of Paschall Mor. 
 ris & Co., 380 Market street, Philadelphia. 

F. A. Nants also wishes to purchase or rent a farm 
 with the view of growing these two crops, in either 
 Pennsylvania, Delaware or Maryland; but conveni. 
 ent to railroad or water communication with Phila- 
 delphia, and would like immediate possession, at 
 least of two or three fields. 

Letters addressed to him, (postage paid,) at 380 
 Market street, Philadelphia, will receive attention. 

Pittsburg Horticultural Societ3'. 

We have received a printed schedule of the prize 
 list of this Society, for their autumnal exhibition, to 
 be held at Pittsburg, on the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th of 
 September next. It embraces all the varieties of 
 fruit, including strawberries, blackberries, cranber- 
 ries, raspberries, &c.: an extensive list of vegetables; 
 also, plants and flowers, designs and boquets. The 
 committee for the latter consists exclusively of ladies 
 — a very appropriate arrangement, and we have no 
 doubt their award will be bestowed where it truly be- 
 longs. In matters of this kind, Ihey are the best 

judges always. 

Sweep-stake premiums of $20, are offered for the 
 largest and best collection of fruits, flowers, plants 
 and vegetables from any State, and $10 lor the sec- 
 ond best. The committee of arrangements are
