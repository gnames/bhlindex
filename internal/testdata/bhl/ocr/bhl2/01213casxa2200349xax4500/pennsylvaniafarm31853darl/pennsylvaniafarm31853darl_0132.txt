drops two to six grains every eighteen or thirty-six 
 inches, as the operator may desire. I prefer the for- 
 mer distance, and I now have as handsome and even 
 ly planted' field of corn as the State of Delaware has 
 ever produced. When my corn first came up it av- 
 eraged over Ihree grains to the hill — -none too many 
 perhaps, at first, as it is safest to make a liberal al- 
 lowance for birds and worms. At the second dress- 
 ing, I weeded it out to two stalks, allowing the most 
 healthy and vigorous to remain. 

Some of the advantages of drilling in corn are 
 those". 

1st. Economtj. — I have over thirty acres in corn 
 this spring; one man and a boy to ride the horse, 
 drilled it in three days. It being our first attempt at 
 using a drill, we lost half a day in experimenting, 
 and "getting our hand in." Next season I will guar- 
 antee to put in thirty acres of corn in handsome style 
 with this same drill, in less than two and a half days. 
 To plant the same ground in the ordinary way would 
 keep the man and boy busy enough during ten dai/s, 
 at least. Here then, besides the time gained for at- 
 tending to other work, is a saving of the whole labor 
 of planting, in the ordinary way, as you will plant 
 the thirty acres with a drill in just the time re- 
 quired to "mark out" the ground before dropping the 
 corn by hand. 

2d. The corn is better put in, if I may use the 
 phrase, in every respect. It is planted at a uniform 
 depth, and therefore comes up evenly. The grains 
 are dropped sufficiently close together, and the hills 
 are in straiijhi lines, and can be cultivated to better 
 advantage. I can run my harrow-teeth as close as I 
 please, to every stalk in every hill in the field. Every 
 farmer knows the trouble of harrowing corn when 
 dropped in the usual zigzag style of careless and 
 tired boys. 

3d. The corn is not so easily washed out of the 
 ground by floods, as when planted in marked out fur- 
 rows. One of my fields is on quite a hill-side, and 
 tliough a heavy rain came on soon after it was plant, 
 ed, it required one man but a couple of hours to re- 
 pair the damages, while my neighbor's corn in the 
 next field was so much washed up, as to require sev- 
 eral men a whole day to replant it. 

4th. The birds are not so destructive to drilled 
 corn as when planted by hand. It is a singular fact 
 that the crows and blackbirds would wander over my 
 fields searching for the hills, apparently taking no 
 notice of the young corn peeping through the level 
 ground. In a few spots where the corn was cut off 
 by worms, and replanted, they would invariably find 
 it, and pull it out. They seemed to think, that unless 
 the corn was in hillocks it was not genuine, or worth 
 pulling up. Whether they will "progress" with the 
 age, and discover that corn is corn, whether planted 
 by hand or by drill, remains to be seen. 

Other advantages might be named, Mr. Editor, 

hut I have trespassed enough upon your columns al- 
 ready. I will close with the prediction, that in a 
 few years every good farmer will as soon think of do" 
 ing without a plow as without a corn drill.

Fur the Farm Jourual. 
 Summer Range for Small Families, 
 Mr. Editor:— 
 A range in the country during the summer season 
 is always pleasant. Ranges in town have also be- 
 come fashionable, the only drawback to their intro- 
 duction into general use, being their size and expense. 
 Some of pur readers, who for want of room or other 
 conveniences, are compelled to use the largo cooking 
 stove the whole year round, will thank us for inform- 
 ing them that Messrs. North, Chase & North, 390 
 Market street, Philadelphia, manufacture an exceed- 
 ingly neat and convenient summer kitchen range, 
 which is so compact as to admit of being set into al- 
 most any fire-place, and yet so conveniently arranged 
 as to allow of washing, baking and general cooking, 
 to almost as great an extent as the large cooking 
 stove. We purchased one complete for seven dol- 
 lars, which we find enables us to keep our house 
 cool, reduce greatly our expense for coal, while the 
 culinary operations of the" family are performed as 
 rapidly and well as formerly. We consider it a per- 
 fect article this hot weather, and take pleasure in di- 
 i-ecting the attention of our readers to it. S. 

For the Farm Journal. 
 Sowing Corn Fodder. 

Mr. Editor:— 

I read, enjoy, and profit by your 
 •Journal, but am occasionally puzzled for the want of 
 the little more information which would make some 
 of your articles intelligible, for instance: an interes- 
 ting com nunication upon the subject of growing corn 
 for fodder solely, tells when and how to plant, &c., 
 but not xohcii to cut. Can you supply the omission ? 

Again: Mr. Mumma treats of the beautiful effect 
 produced by grafting the Rose Acacia upon the "Yel- 
 low Locust" — what is the yellow locust? is a question 
 which has puzzled myself and neighbours. 

If correspondents in presenting new articles, of 
 new modes of culture, would but reflect that in orr 
 der to mak e their information of value, it become, 
 necessary to imjMrt the whole of it; much more sats 
 isfiiction would ensue than from a vague or partial- 
 statement, which leaves the more material pai-ts to 
 be guessed at, or the subject of an experiment, oft- 
 times causing that to be abandoned, or left untried, 
 which a few more words of explanation would have 
 made intelligible and valuable to those who seek in- 
 formation from books. RUS.
