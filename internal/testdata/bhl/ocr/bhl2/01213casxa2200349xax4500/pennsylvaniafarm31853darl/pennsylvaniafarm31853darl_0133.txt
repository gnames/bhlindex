early in the Fall, say for this region middle to last of 
 September. As much depends on the season, time of 
 sowing, &c., it is difficult to be more definite. If 
 cut green and before growth is matured, more care 
 •will be required in curing, same as with hay. As 
 it is very liable to heat, when put in the mow, we 
 prefer making small shocks in the open field, to stand 
 till winter, when they can be hauled to the barn- 
 yard as wanted. If the ground must be cleared, 
 make small stacks, convenient to the barn-yard, with 
 a rail in the centre, placed upright for ventilation. 

In respect to the locust, for grafting the rose aca- 
 cia on, we presume Mr. Mumma, means the common 
 locust, "Robinia.Pseudocacia," which unites readily 
 with the other. Its blossoms r re white. We know 
 of no locust with yellow blossoms. 

The hints about correspondents being more precise 
 in telling "the whole story," are well worth atten- 
 ding to. 

For the F:irm Journal, 
 Augusta Rose. 
 To THE Editors of the Farm Journal; — 

Can you 
 or any of your correspondents, inform us any thing 
 about the Augusta Rose, said to be "a deeper yellow 
 than Chromatella, more vigorous grower t.ian Lam- 
 arque, and more fragrant than Devoniensis." I pre- 
 sume it must have flowered in or around Philadel- 
 phia, the present spring, and some of us hereaway, 
 who take no little pride in our collections of roses, 
 are quite anxious to know whether this high flown de- 
 scription is sustained by fact. 

J. GIBSON, Lancaster city. 

AVe have not yet seen the Augusta Rose, and can- 
 not answer the enquiry. James D. Fulton, of Phil- 
 adelphia, is one of the agents for its sale. Perhaps 
 he or some one who has seen it in bloom, can answer.

 some thirty bidders at the sale, and the bidding wa.s 
 spirited. The Itidders and purchasers were from all 
 parts of the country, and the sales all bona fide. 

Before the sale took place Col. Sherwood had pro-
