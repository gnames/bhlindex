FANCY LOP-EARER RABBITS— POPPIES. 

[July 

)ur distinguished cattlo breeder to realize a hand- '^^ ""'.V '"'-l f^um the wide spread reputation of Col. 

so-.ne bonus. It was an important sale of the very 
 bost breed of cattle in the country, and drew togeth- 
 er from a distance man . anxious purchasers, knowing 

Sherwood, that the animals put up were pure bred, 
 and no mistake. 

Fancy top-Eared Rab1)its. 

Mr. Geo. P. Burnham, of Boston, JIass., advertis- 
 es his imported Lop Ear Bahhits in the Journal this 
 month. The engraving is a likeness of this stock, 
 drawn from life, and exhibits the general character 
 and form of this favorite race of animals. 

In a lata number of tlie "X. E. Farmer," we find 
 the f dlowing allusion to this breed, from the pen of 
 Mr. B. 

Mr. Editor: — 

Above I hand you a drawing from 
 life of a doe and young, of the EaijUsh Lop-Eated 
 llabhiU — sucli as are now bred to a wide extent in 
 (jreat Britain, and which are very highly esteemed 
 for tiie table, when fattrned, or as pets with amateurs. 

This tribe are beautiful creatures, are very easily 
 roared, and have proved a most interesting addition 
 to the stock of fanciers who have bred them. In 
 England, they receive a good share of attention, and 
 clubs exist there in all the large cities and towns 
 wtio hold annual exhibitions, at which a good deal 
 of competition is evinced for superiority. 

My stock I imported last spring from London, 
 Liverpool and Dublin: and I shall be happy to show 
 it to those interested, at my residence, in Melrose. 
 The peculiarities of this race consist chiefly in their 
 groat size, their fine colors, and their long pendant 
 ears. They are exceedingly prolific — breeding six or 
 seven times in a year — and may be k;pt advantage- 
 ously in a very small space. 

My rabbitry occupies a building twelve by thirty 
 ieet. The animals in hutches three feet long and 

two feet wide. These hutches, (or apartments,) are 
 ranged in ticr«, one over another, five on a tier: and 
 each rabbit occupies a separate hutch. The young 
 are taken from the mother at four to six weeks old, 
 and are afterwards kept together (six to ten,) in a 
 large hutch, in a separate room of the rabbitry. 
 They ai'e ready for breeding at six to eight months 
 old. 

I am not aware that these pretty animals are now 
 very extensively bred in this country, Mr. Rotch, 
 of Morris, N. Y., and Mr. Rodman, of Dedham, be- 
 ing the only gentlemen that I know, who have fine 
 stock; yet I think we shall very soon see more of 
 them, from the fact that there is at present a good 
 deal of inquiry for them, at honie and abroad. 
 I am yours, &c.,

Poppies. 

Dr. J. V. C. Smith, of Boston, says that immense 
 crops of poppies are raised in Switzerland, not only 
 for the opium, but for the oil extracted from their 
 seeds. Tnis oil is beautifully transparent, extensive- 
 ly used in house painting, colorless as water, and 
 when mixed with white lead, leaves a beautiful sur- 
 face that never becomes yellow. Now that linseed 
 oil is raising in price, and as much of our land is un- 
 fit for the cultivation of flax, he advises the attempt 
 at cultivating the poppy here, which does very well 
 even on poor, sandy soil. — [Exchange. 

Agricultural knowledge is always desirable and 
 useful.
