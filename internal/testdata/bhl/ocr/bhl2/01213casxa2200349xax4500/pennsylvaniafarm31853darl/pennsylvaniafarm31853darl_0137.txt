AD INTERIM REPORT. 

Philadelphia, June 10.. 1853. 

Til tilt President qfthe Peiinsylmnia Horticultural Socitly 

The Fruit Committee, in presenting their usual 
 monthly ad interim Report, would remind the Soci- 
 ety that, at the stated meeting of last month, speci- 
 mens of two new Grapes (one a seedling of the Black 
 Hainbarij, the other the Masque Yerdel,) were exhib- 
 ited by the originator, -J. Fisk Allen, of Salem, Mass- 
 achusetts. Wishing to have ;iu opportunity of care- 
 fully examining these two varieties, the Committee 
 only noticed them cursorily in their regular Report 
 for that evening, with a promise of submitting a more 
 detailed pomological description of them in their 
 June ad interim Report. The specimens having been 
 winter forced, and being ripe in March, were kept 
 too long after their maturity to be in their greatest 
 perfection. 

Allen's Seedling Black Hamburg. — The bunch 
 exhibited was not veiy large, though it is probable 
 there will be an improvement iu this respect. Berry 
 large, black, ocal; seed grey; flesh solid, and possess- 
 ing much of the character of the Black Hamburg; 
 quality "very gool." 

MusiiUE Verdel. — This is a natural cross between 
 the Grizzly Frontignan and the 'N'erdelho, the Wine 
 Grape of Maderia. Bunch large, shouldered, loose; 
 berry rather small, about half an inch in diameter, 
 round, pale red; seed light cinnamon color; fl vor 
 rich, saccharine, highly perfumed, quality "best;" 
 said to bj as early as the Black July, and the Pit- 
 maston. 

Mr. Allen deserves the thanks of Pomologists for 
 having originated two varieties of Grapes of such 
 excellence. And being of native origin, they may 
 prove, for out-door culture, better suited to the re- 
 (^uirements of our climate than their translantic pa- 
 rents. 

From II. W. S. Cleveland, of Burlington, N. J.— 
 Fine specimens of Strawberries, without a name. 
 Fruit large; roundish, sometimes ovate; dark red; 
 seed of the same color, set in superficial depressions; 
 calyx roflexed; stamens persistent; flesh yellowish 
 white saccharine, high flavored; quality "best." The 
 fruit and leaf clearly indicate the variety to be a 
 Haulhois, probably the Lafayette. It is to be regrett- 
 ed that this luscious class of Strawberries is so little 
 cultivated. 

From Mr. Stuart. — Beautiful specimens of Straw- 
 berries, Horcy's Seedliny, of last year's planting: 
 some nearly four inches in circumference; quality 
 "very good." 

From Gerhard Schmitz, of Philadelphia. — Fine 
 specimens of two of his Seedlinij Utrawherries: 

1. The Pe-nxsylvania. — This variety is a seedling 
 of the Moyamensing, and was exhibited by Mr. 
 Schmitz last season, for the first time. Fruit large; 
 broadly conical; dark crimson; seed crimson, and 
 vvlien shaded, yellow, set in depressions not very 
 deep, with roundish intervals; flesh red; flavor fine; 
 quality 'oest;" sexual character y)i'.v/i7/a/tv leaf large, 
 deep green, serratures crenate. The Committee award 
 a premium of five dollars to this variety, as the bes[ 

new American Seedling Strawberry of superior qual- 
 ity, after two years' trial. 

2. Schmitz's No. 3. — A Seedling of the Washing- 
 ton, exhibited now for the first time. Fruit large; 
 roundish ovate, sometimes inclining to conical; light 
 crimson; seed crimson, often yellow, set in rather 
 deep indentations, with intervals somewhat ridged; 
 flesh pale red; flavor pleasant, quality "very good;" 
 sexual character piiYf'Wate. Leaf large, light green. 

From Caleb Cope. — Specimens of four varieties of 
 Strawberries: 

1. McAvovs ScPERiOR-.This variety originated with 
 Mr. McAvoy, of Cincinnati, and was formerly known 
 as his No. 12. In May, 1851, it received a premium 
 of $100 from the Cincinnati Horticultural Society. 
 Mr. Cope's specimens were of great size and beau- 
 ty, some of them measuringj?«e and a half inches in 
 circumference. Fruit very large; roundish ovate, oc- 
 casionally slightly necked; deep brilliant crimson; 
 seed crimson, sometimes yellow, set in indentations 
 not deep, except in the largest specimens, when the 
 intervals are also somewhat ridged; flesh red; flavor 
 exquisitely flue; quality "best;" sexual character jja- 
 tillate. 

2. McAvoy's No. 1. — Large: roundish, deep scar- 
 let; light crimson seed; indentations rather deep, in- 
 tervals not ridged; flesh whitish, partly stained with 
 red; flavor agreeable; quality "good," perhaps "very 
 good;" sexual character j?istillate. An abundant 
 bearer. 

3. McAvoy's Extra Red. — Large; roundish; scar- 
 let; seed red, sometimes yellowish; indentations tol- 
 erably deep, intervals somewhat rounded; flesh yel- 
 lowish, slightly stained; sub-acid flavor, quality only 
 "good:" pistillate; extraordinarily productive.

 formerly known as Schneicke's Hermaphrodite. Very 
 large; njundish ovate; brilliant crimson; seed of the 
 same color, sometimes yellowish, set in rather deep 
 indentations with rounded intervals; flesh red; flavor 
 fine; quality "very good." A variety of great excel- 
 lence; perfect in its sexual organization, and remark- 
 ably productive, a rare circumstance with staminate 
 varieties of large size. 

From Robert Buist. — Fine specimens of two vari- 
 eties of Strawberries, McAvoy's Supei-ior and McA- 
 voy's No. 1, described above. 

From Henry A. Dreer. — A dish of the Moyamen- 
 sing Strawberry. This fine variety originated with
