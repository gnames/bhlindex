. The making up of a Premium List, to embrace everythim to which 
 premiums should be awarded by an Agricultural Society, is a task not 
 cx]iecfcd to tie perfected Ity any one whose experience in such mat- 
 Icrs is ot n"Iioj.i;er standin;,' tiaui my own: and knowing that this list 
 Is not cMuipicre, aoit Hiat muny drservin;,' articles have not been in* 
 cluiled in tire above, it is hopeti that its iueoiupletcncss wlii not have 
 the tendency to keep one article irom the Fan' because a premium baa 
 net been ollered for it. The appointment of a Committee on Discre- 
 tionary l*rcmiunis. with power to make such liberal awards as they 
 may deem proper, will nuiUe up this denciency, and enable .\ll who 
 wisli, to become exhibitors. 

Farmers and others, wlio wish information rel.ating to the coming
