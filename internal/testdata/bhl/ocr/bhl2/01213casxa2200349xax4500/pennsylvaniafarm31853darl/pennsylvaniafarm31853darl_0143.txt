About the same period a similar set of experiments 
 on churning cream was made by Mr. John Ballan- 
 tine, of Edinburgh, from which it appeared that the 
 greatest quantity of butter from a given quantity of 
 ^ream is obtained at '3U°; and the best quality at 55° 

in the churn just before the butter comes. When 
 the heat exceeded C>5°, no washing could detach the 
 milk from the butter without the aid of salt; but 
 when a quantity of salt was wrought well into it, and 
 the mass allowed to stand for 24 hours, subsequent- 
 ly being well washed with cold spring water, the se- 
 rous portion of the milk was extracted.

The same gentleman, after an experience of thirty 
 years, came to the conclusion that butter is yielded 
 in the largest quantity, and of the best quality, by 
 the entire milk, kept in the fii'St place until it has bo- 
 come perceptibly acid. The time required for this 
 purpose varies according to the heat of the weather, 
 the temperature of the dairy, &c.; this point being 
 ordinarily ascertained by the formation of a strong, 
 thick brat, or scum, showing itself on the surface, 
 which tlien becomes uneven. AVhen fit, the milk fs 
 put into a churn, as much hot water being added to 
 it as will bring the whole to a temperature of 65°. 
 It is then churned at the rate of thirty-eight to forty 
 strokes per minute, until the butter comes, which 
 usually requires from three to three and a half hours, 
 when the velocity is diminished in order to g.ither 
 the butter.
