THE PRODUCTION OF BUTTER.

sate foi- this, a higher temperature and longer time 
 iis required to produce the desired eifect. 

Tli'e preeeeding phenomena are in strict accor- 
 dance with the character of the churn used in tlie 
 various districts where the lacteal products of the 
 cow are churned in dilferent forois. Almost invari- 
 ably, certainly over the most extended area, the com.- 
 mon barrel churn is used in those districts where 
 cream is churned alone. By the barrel cluirn a large 
 quantity of butter may be made from cn'ain, with a 
 moderate degree of rapidity and at a comparatively 
 slight expenditure of labour, particularly as cream, 
 when put into the churn, is almost invariably in 
 some degree p.cescent, generally enough so for the 
 purpose of obtaining the butter without requiring to 
 be further o.xygenized. No practical benefit is ob- 
 tained by using cream quite sweet, as the increased 
 labour required in churning far more than counter- 
 balances any slight advantage which butter so niade 
 may derive for the purpose of keeping. If proper 
 care is taken in "making up" the butter formed from 
 cream slightly acescent at the time of churning, it 
 will maintain its freshness equal t„ that made from 
 fresh cream; at the same time avoiding the risk of 
 «ver-churning, which will always be much greater 
 in churning fresh than sour cream. 

For churning milk and cream the barrel churn is 
 wholly inadequate, the upright churn, or one with 
 revolving dasliers, being requisite in order to suffici- 
 •cntly o.i;ygenize the milk, for which purpose this 
 form of churn is well adapted, as there always re- 
 main sufficient openings to admit the atmosphere; 
 •whereas barrel churns are hermetically sealed du- 
 ring the act of churning, the operation having to be 
 stopped occasionally for the purpose of opening a 
 ventrhcdc, which is occasionally done to allow the es- 
 •cape of the gas evolved during the "breaking" of tlifc 
 ■cream. 

The American churn varies only from the ordina- 
 nary square churn with revolving dashers, in the cir- 
 •cumstance that, instead of the dashers being open, 
 the back of the dasher is a flat piece, without any 
 perforation, having raised edges and four transverse 
 pieces, dividing it something similar to the shelves of 
 a book-ca.se. When the dasher is turned round, the 
 nests (ormcd as described, convey and force into the 
 milk or cream a quantity of the atmosphere equiva- 
 lent to the cubic contents of the hollow space, which 
 will remain in the interstices alluded to, when their 
 ■edges come in contact with the fluid; in order, there- 
 fore, to prjduce the greatest action, the fluid ought 
 to be on a level with the edges of tliose interstices: 
 this will occur when the latter are in a perfectly hor- 
 izontal position. This form of chura is the test for 
 churning sweet cream, and will undoubtedly produce 
 the butter from milk av.d cream, in any form, in 
 much less time than any churn that has yet been 
 introduced; but for working large masses of fluid, 
 th'3 labour Would b; excessively "heavy, and in large 
 •dairies, where milk and cream are churned together, 
 steam or other power would be required; it also re- 
 mains to be yet tested on a large working scale, 
 whether the butter will prove as good as that churn- 
 ed by the ordinary methods. Mr. Robinson, of Lis- 
 burn, has for some time iotreduced a churn from 
 France, which is very neat and simple, and well 
 adapted to gather the butter, having a grating for the 
 purpose, to which also heating er cooling appliaoces 
 can easily be adapted as the season or case may re- 
 •tjuire. 

On reviewing the whole of the circumstances con- 
 ffieeted with procuring butter, the writer is induced 

to give a preference to what may be termed the I.an~ 
 cashire method, which combines the best principles 
 connected with the other methods. By setting aside 
 the milk first drawn to stand for cream, the most a- 
 queous and serous portion of the milk is got rid of, 
 whilst by preserving the last drawn portions, and 
 mixing it with the cream, it obtains the requisite flu- 
 idity; the acescent form in which the whole is placed 
 in the churn is favorable to the speedy formation of 
 the butter. Another cireumstance, of no inconsid- 
 erable moment, especially in a densely populated 
 district, such as the northern manufacturing coun- 
 ties, is the quality of the butter-milk thus made, 
 which is far superior to that made from cream alone. 
 Churning should be regulated by a thermometer, cold 
 water being applied in summer, and warm water 
 in winter, to obtain the proper temperature, particu- 
 lars of which have already been given. When the 
 butter is made from cream alone, early in the morn- 
 ing (about 4 o'clock) is the best period of the day for 
 the purpose. When a change is heard in the sound 
 of the churn, and an unequal resistance is felt against 
 the dasliers, the butter may be expected to form very 
 shortly. 

After the butter is taken from the churn it must 
 be well squet'Ked or "worked" by the hand, and all 
 the water that possibly can be, should be pressed 
 out, it being for this purpose kneaded, washed, and 
 rolled out several times with clean cold water, and 
 the last time a little salt should be kneaded into the 
 mass, which will have the effect of causing the grea^ 
 er part of the remaining caseous matter to exude 
 when subsequently washed in cold water, salt ap- 
 pearing to have the property of dissolving casein, as 
 it docs the albumen of bones, in pickled meats; the 
 whole secret of Dutch butter making consists in this 
 circumstance. If intended for very long keeping, a 
 small quantity of saltpetre, may bo added, which 
 will prevent, in a great measure, the tendency of 
 any remaining caseous matter from entering into the 
 putrefactive state— the cause of rancidity — the diff- 
 erence in quality between salt used in England and 
 Holland having nothing to do with the superior keep- 
 ing quality of the latter. If properly made, half an 
 ounce of salt to one pound of butter is sufficient, if 
 intended for keeping: and one-fourth of an ounce of 
 salt to the pound, if intended for immediate use. 
 The circumstances connected with the formation of 
 butter from clouted or scalded cream have already 
 been sufficiently det-ailed : for immediate use the 
 quality is not equal to that formed by ordinary meth- 
 ods, and for keeping is wholly inadmissible; the su- 
 perior weight obtaind is attributable to the quantity 
 of casein and coagulated albumen, mechanically 
 mixed with the butter, which it is impossible tu erad- 
 icate by any subsequent means. The recently pub- 
 lished report of the "Agriculture of Somerset," by 
 ■Mr. T. D. Acland, relates an experiment in which a 
 h)ss appeared to exist in the weight formed in making 
 butter from scalded cream as compared with the or- 
 dinary process; this experiment, however, isoontrary 
 to all others mad« with the same view. 

It may be important occasionally to Vnow that a 
 little saltpetre dissolved in warm water, and mixed 
 with' the CTcam taken .mm milk with a turnipyfli- 
 vor. entir.ly -eradicates it in tlie course of churning. 
 A factitious color can be given to butter by the 
 use of atinetto, or the -scrapings of the ^-ed part of 
 carrots; but neither will give the appearance of fine 
 "•rass butter. All snch practices are to be depreca- 
 ted; the latter described mode, however, is the pref- 
 erable one, in case artificial colouring is considered 
 desirable.
