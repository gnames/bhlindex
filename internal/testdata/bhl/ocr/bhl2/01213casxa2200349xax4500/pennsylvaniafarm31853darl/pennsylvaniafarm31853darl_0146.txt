PHILADELPHIA BUTTER.

Phiadelphia Butter. 

By request of a subscriber, we insert the following 
 article, by Dr. Emerson, of Philadelphia, giving his 
 views on a matter of much interest to Pennsylvania 
 farmers, viz: the cause of the now admitted superior- 
 ity of the fresh butter of Philadelphia market. — 
 They were published some years ago, but will be 
 new to many of our readers. 

Dr. E. is the Editor of that excellent and standard 
 work, the Farmer's Encyclopedia. Amid the duties 
 of an arduous profession, he has given considerable 
 attention to the important interests of agriculture 
 To such men practical farmers are often greatly in 
 debted. 

The sweet scented vernal grass can be procured 
 at the seed stores in Philadelphia, from 50 cents to $1 
 per pound. 

Philadelphia, Oct. 31, 1849. 
 Sir". — I wish to invite your attention to a subject 
 relating to pasturage and the products of the dairy. 
 It has already been laid before the public,but this so 
 partially and imperfectly, that it will still be found 
 by most persons invested with novelty, and as I be- 
 lieve fraught with important bearings upon agricul- 
 tural interests. 

Philadelphia butter enjoys a widely extended rep- 
 utation for its peculiarly high yet delicate flavor, well 
 known to all who have had opportunities of tasting 
 it. Good butter produced in this vicinity is alwajs 
 to be found in the Philadelphia market, but it is only 
 during the Spring that it possesses in greatest per- 
 fection that delicious flavor to which I here particu- 
 larly refer. This superior flavor, like that distingu- 
 ishing the Epping and Cambridge butter of the Lon- 
 don market, has been very naturally ascribed to 
 something eaten by the cows producing it. But 
 what this something is has been a subject for vague 
 speculation, and never yet defined or specified so as 
 to enable persons in other localities to avail them- 
 selves of it for the improvement of their own pas- 
 tures and dairy products. 

Extensive observations and many experiments 
 made and continued through many years have con- 
 vinced mo that the proximate source of the high fla- 
 vor of our Philadelpliia Jlay butter is the sweel-ncent- 
 ed vernal grass, abounding in the old pastures, fields, 
 and meadows of the adjacent counties. Some of the 
 facts and reasons upon which I found this conclusion 
 a,re the following: 

1st. In the dairy region around Philadelphia the 
 sweet-scented vernal grass, with its peculiar vanilla- 
 like fragrance, constitutes the predominant Spring 
 herbage on aU the pasture fields and meadows left 
 several years unploughed. The longer that pastures 
 have been left unbroken, the greater the proportion 
 of the vernal grass, and the higher. the flavor of the 
 butter produced from the cows fed upon them. Many 
 of the meadows and pasture fields have remained ten, 
 twenty, thirty, and more years unbroken by the 
 plough. In such cases the sweet-scented vernal 
 grass aflfords almost the exclusive Spring herbage. 

2d. The high flavor continues in the butter during 
 the development of this grass, and icvariably de- 
 clines with the maturing of the seeds, after which 
 the stems become dry and hard, and the cattle push 
 them aside in search of fresher and greener herbage. 
 3d. The sweet-scented vernal grass is shown by 

chemical analysis to contain an aromatic essential oil, 
 of which benzonio acid, or flowers of benzoin, is the 
 base. 

This aromatic principle is abundant, and can .be , 
 readily obtained by distillation, furnishing a delight- 
 ful perfume and source of flavor. As the milk of all 
 animals is so very susceptible of acquiring disagree- 
 able tastes from substances eaten, such as garlic, tur- 
 nips, i&c, it is natural to infer that it may likewise 
 be imbued with agreeable flavors, when the proper 
 agents for such a purpose are presented in the food. 
 4th. That the benzoic acid is the principal agent in 
 producing the peculiarly agreeable flavor of butter 
 made from pastures abounding in the sweet-scented 
 vernal grass, I have rendered probable, if not a de- 
 monstrated fact, by several experiments in which the 
 flowers of benzoin given to cows imparted to the but- 
 ter made from them the characteristic flavor. In 
 such cases 20 or 30 grains of the benzoin were given 
 twice a day, previously dissolved in hot water, which 
 was stirred into some flour or meal, and then mingled 
 with the customary mess. The cows receive not the 
 slightest injury from this or even a much larger quan- 
 tity of the benzoin. 

The sweet-scented vernal grass, called by botanists 
 anihoxanihum odoratum, is a native of Europe, from 
 whence, at an earlj period of our settlement, it has 
 doubtless been introduced into the vicinity of Phila- 
 delphia, its seeds having probably been blended with 
 those of other grasses. It has been long naturalized, 
 and now disputes the right of soil with the common 
 green grass, and never yields possession, but becomes 
 more and more predominant until the sod is deati-oy- 
 ed by the plough, after which it clings to the borders 
 of the field, along the fences, and hedge-rows. When, 
 after a rotation of grain crops, the ground is left un- 
 disturbed by tillage to be again covered with green- 
 sward, the yernal grass re-appears, springing from 
 the old seed left in the earth. Though seldom sown 
 designedly in this part of the United States, it is of- 
 ten sown in England, where it constitutes a part pf 
 the growth of most permanent pastures, growing ir» 
 nearly every kind of soil, but attaining its greatest 
 perfection on the deep and moist, loving shady pla- 
 ces, such as the skirts of woods. The sweet odor by 
 which English hay is often distinguished is chiefly 
 derived from an admixture of vernal grass. Although 
 when alone it is not distinguished very highly as a 
 hay grass, still its early growth and hardiness, with 
 the superior nutritive properties of its aftermath, 
 gave it high claims in the composition of all per- 
 manent pastures. In England it comes into flower 
 about the middle of April, and in Southern Pennsyl- 
 vania about the middle of May, the seed ripening in 
 both countries about the second week in June. It is 
 worthy of remark, that in the moist climate of 
 England this grass continues throwing up flower- 
 stalks till the end of autumn, while in Pennsylvania 
 the efflorescence is confined to Spring. As the de- 
 velopement of the aromatic qualities is mainly con- 
 fined to the period of efflorescence, this fact may ex- 
 plain why the period of highest flavor in Philadel- 
 phia butter is so limited. 

The question might be very naturally asked: If 
 the sweet-scented vernal grass communicates to 
 Spring butter the high and delicious flavor we have 
 referred to, why is not this flavor imparted in winter, 
 when cows are fed on hay cut from meadows known 
 to contain this grass ? The answer I would give is 
 as follows: The principal and almost exclusive bay- 
 grass of our section of country is timothy, which, 
 with red clover frequently combined, matures and is 
 mown long after the sweet-scented yernal grass ha»
