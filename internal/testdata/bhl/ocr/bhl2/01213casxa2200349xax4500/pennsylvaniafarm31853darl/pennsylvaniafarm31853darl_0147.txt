dried its stallis and lost its distinguisliing fragrance. 
 Could the vernal grass be sown alone, or blended with 
 other grasses maturing at the same time, and the 
 hay all mown at the stage of perfect efflorescence 
 and highest fragrance, there is little doubt that but- 
 ter made from cows fed upon it would manifest more 
 or less of the fine flavor at other times than in the 
 Spring. I think it proper to remark that the milky 
 products of cows fed on pastures where the sweet- 
 scented vernal grass abounds, instjad of always 
 possessing a delightful flavor, are sometimes found 
 imbued with a most disagreeable one, proceeding 
 generally from weeds so often existing in pastures. 

In southern Pennsylvania, garlic, and especially 
 that nauseous and troublesome plant commonly call- 
 ed the "ox-eye-daisy," a species of wild camomile, 
 (Chnjsanthenmm leucanthemum,) are very often nipp- 
 ed by cows when the herbage is short or scarce. ^ In 
 such cases all the agreeable qualities that might 
 otherwise have been derived from the vernal grass 
 are not only neutralized, but overpowered by the dis- 
 agreeable tastes imparted by the bad company with 
 which it is associated. I consider the sweet-scented 
 vernal grass worthy the attention of all farmers de- 
 sirous of possessing the means of obtaining butter 
 and other dairy products in the highest perfection, 
 and of having in their fields and meadows one of the 
 earliest, if not the very earliest pasture grass known. 
 But to these advantages, great as they are, may, I 
 think, be added others of no small importance; one 
 of which is the capacity to confer a fine flavor upon 
 the meat of stock grazed upon a species of herbage 
 fraught with a high aromatic principle. Such ad- 
 vantages have, from time immemorial, been the in- 
 heritance of people in certain localities, where they 
 were originally indebted for them to chance, as for 
 example with those residing in the vicinity of Phil- 
 adelphia, few if any of whom are aware that there 
 exists in their pastures any grasses not common to 
 those of other places. To indentify the immediate 
 agent from whi:h such advantages are derived, is to 
 reinove them from the uncertain control of accident, 
 and place them at once at the disposal of all. 

A description of the grass, the merits of which I 
 have been describing to you, may be foundin the 
 Farmers' Encyclopedia, (Philadelphia edition tor 
 1850,) under the head of Aiithoxanthum Odoraium,

"The Yorkshire cow is the great favorite with the 
 London dairyman, as she answers all the purposes of 
 his trade, being a good milker, and when accident or 
 old age renders it necessary to discard her, she is 
 soon ready for the shambles. In Mr. Biggs' dairy, 
 31 Edgeware Road, London, there are about 400 cows 
 constantly kept; of these, the greater proportion is 
 composed of the Yorkshire breed, of various degrees 
 of affinity between the old Ilolderness and Durham 
 breeds. There are also some of his cows which are 
 longer in the horn than those already mentioned, and 
 whfch are no doubt more allied to the original Ilol- 
 derness, or perhaps have long-horn blood in them: 
 while there are others whose horns and general ap- 
 pearance indicate their close alliance with the im- 
 proved shortrhorn or Durham breed. Of these, the 
 most valuable is the cross between the Ilolderness 
 and Durham, as being good, both for the pail and the 
 butcher; on the other hand, the Ilolderness and long- 
 horns give the richest milk, run soon dry, and are 
 more difficult to iatten, while the pure short-horn 
 gives least milk, but makes most beef in a given time. 
 With these properties to choose amongst, it is not 
 difficult to decide which of these breeds is most 
 profitable to the London dairyman; whose trade is to 
 sell as much milk as he can, and only to fatten his 
 cows lor the butcher when necessity compels him. 

A Yorkshire cow in a London dairy establishment 
 is seldom calculated to give less than 20 quarts of 
 milk daily, for the first four months after dropping 
 her calf, and many of this breed have been known 
 to give from 30 to 40 quarts of milk daily, for a few 
 weeks after calving. In Mr. Biggs' dairy 20 quarts 
 a day is the average quantity of a great proportion 
 of his best cows, and many of them would continue 
 in milk all the year round; but as this would be in- 
 jurious to the animals, and would diminish the yield 
 in the succeeding year, they are intentionally run 
 dry about six weeks before the time of calving. 

The whole quantity of milk produced in twelve 
 months,by one of these Yorkshire cows.when fed as in 
 the London dairies, cannot be less than 4000 quarts 
 or 1000 gallons. The retail price of new milk is lOd. 
 per gallon, and when sold wholesale to the milkman, 
 the price realised by the dairyman is not less than l.s. 
 per gallon; so that from this data it appears that a 

l/oudon Dairies. 

We copy the following from Ilaston's now English 
 work, of "How to choose a milk cow," with a view 
 to give our dairy farmers some idea of the profit of 
 a milk dairy near London, the breed of cows most 
 preferred, with the relative yield of milk, mode of 
 feeding, expenses and profits. One sentence strikes 
 us as rather curious, "The consumer is entitled to be 
 served with the milk as it comes from the cow." 

Is it possible the English Dairymen are not ac- 
 quainted with the process by which a little water is 
 accidentaUy left in the bottom of the pan, before the 
 milk is poured in ? If so, a fair exchange of this 
 secret, to prevent headache from too rich milk, may 
 go acroes the Atlantic, in exchange for the drop of 

cow, giving 1000 gallons per annum, produces 50^. 
 wortlf of milk during that period. Of course the 
 feeding is very liberal, and, from the high price of 
 green food in tlie metropolis, is necessarily very ex- 
 pensive. The milkingand feeding in Mr. Biggs' dairy 
 is as follows: — 

4 A. M., milked. A good milker can milk sixteen 
 cows in two and a half hours. 

4 A. M., one bushel basket of brewer's grains to 
 every two cows. 

A. M., three bushel baskets of Swedes or Man- 
 gold Wurtzel to every two cows. 

5 A. M., one truss of hay to every twelve cows. 

9 A. M., water; which is the only time they are al- 
 lowed to drink during the twenty-four hours, i n 
 winter.and each cow drinks about twenty-four quarts, 
 In summer, water is given twice. 

\\\ A. M., one bushel of grains to two cows. 

1 P. M., milked again. 

2 P. M., three bushels of roots to two cows. 

■61 P. M., one truss of hay to every eight cows.
