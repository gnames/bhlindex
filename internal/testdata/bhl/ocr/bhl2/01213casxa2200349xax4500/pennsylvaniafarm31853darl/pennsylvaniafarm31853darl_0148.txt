PHILADELPHIA BUTTER— RURAL ART AND TASTE. 

[Abctist 

In summer the green food consists of Clover, Italian 
 Rye-grass, or Vetches. 

The cows are milked twice a day, which occupies 
 about two and a half hours each time. The cow- 
 houses are cleaned out five times every day, and the 
 gutters kept sweet by allowing water to flowthroa;^h 
 them. The cows are thoroughly cleaned and combed 
 once a week. 

From the foregoing data, the following calculation 
 of the annual expense of house-feeding a London 
 dairy cow may be deduced: — 

Winter food, from 1st October to 1st May, (212 
 days): — 

212 bushels of grains, at Gd., - £5 6 

13J tons of Swedes and Mangold, with the 

tops, at 204-., - - - 13 5 

1 ton of liay, at 90s.. - - - 4 10 

Summer food, from 1st May to 1st October 

(153 days):- 
 IIJ tons of Grass, Clover, or Vetches, at 20s. 11 10 
 153 bushels of grains (or an equivalent, )at6rf. 3 16 G

Deduct expense. 

Profit, - - - - £13 15 6 

The daily expense is nearly 2s. Sd. per cow, and 
 the daily yield of milk throughout the year nearly 
 2J gall. ins; and no London dairyman will long keep a 
 cow that does not give 21 gallons a day. In the above 
 calc'ilation no charge has been made for rent of prem- 
 ises; but even although 11. per cow be struck off for 
 this item, the profit is still abundant. 

In speaking thus highly of the Yorkshire, as in 
 every way well adapted to the purposes of the me- 
 tropolitan dairyman, it must be admitted that she is 
 neither so good for a cheese or butter dairy as some 
 of the smaller breeds. In the former case, quantity 
 of milk is tho desideratum, while in the two latter it 
 is quality or richness. Were the York.shire cow em- 
 pliiyed either for the production of cheese or butter, 
 the refuse — whey and butter milk, or skimmed milk 
 — would be much greater than that yielded by milk 
 of a richer (piality; and, in consequence of tliis, the 
 profits would be considerably diminished. In a milk 
 dairy there is no refuse; and should the consumers in 
 laige towns complain of t e inferiiir quality of milk 
 sold to them, they should remember that they cannot 
 enjoy the luxuries of the country and those of the 
 town at one and tho same time. The consumer is en- 
 titled to be served with the milk as it comes from the 
 cow; but when ho insists on having grass milk in 
 the middle of Winter, he has no reason to complain 
 should his importunity force the milk-seller to adopt 
 the harmless device of counterfeiting an articio to 
 please his oustomerjs eye, by the infusion of a drop 
 of burnt sugar, to give the milk the rich yellow ap- 
 pearance which it usually possesses when the cows 
 are fed on grass.— [Mr. Ilaston, in "How to Choose 
 a Good Milk Cow." 

Rural Art and Taste. 

We make the following extracts from an address- 
 on the above topics, before the Warren Lyceum, War- 
 ren county, Pa^ by Patrick Falconer, Esq. Were 
 the fine taste, and correct appreciation of the beau- 
 tiful in nature and art, possessed by our friend Fal- 
 coner, more prevalent throughout Pennsylvania, we 
 should not see such indiscriminate destruction of our 
 noble Forest Trees, in and around our towns and 
 villages, such entire icdifTerence in locating them, as 
 well as private rural residences, without any refer- 
 ence to the splendid • scenery, and natural advanta- 
 ges of situation, no where more abundant. We 
 should then see more open spaces reserved for pub- 
 lic Parks, more shade trees planted along our dusty 
 streets and high-ways, more beautiful gardens, and 
 grass plots in front of and around our houses. This 
 would not only promote health, and comfort, and en- 
 joyment, but by directing public taste to such things, 
 have a good moral influence on the community, and 
 even in a strictly utilitarian, or dollar and cents view, 
 would be a good investment. If the public can only 
 be co/ivinced of this, we predict there will be quite a 
 rage for planting trees. We have no doubt of the 
 fact ourselves. Many a suburban village has been 
 selected for a residence by strangers accidentally vis- 
 iting it, wlio have been attracted by the good taste 
 and embellishments of the private and public buil- 
 dings, set back from the street, and adorned with or- 
 namental trees and shrubbery. We know of country 
 seats having been increased in value some thousands 
 of dollars, simply by the judicious location of buil- 
 dings, and the arrangements of a well furnished 
 lawn and garden. 

If there is no space in the town of Warren, re- 
 served for a Public Park or Square, we shall depend 
 on our friend Falconer, to have one under way by the 
 time of our first visit. We published in the Farm 
 •Journal, of January last, an engraving of one we 
 have in West Chester, with a list of trees and shrubs, 
 already planted. 

Could not a few public spirited individuals in 
 many of our inland towns in Pennsylvania, organize 
 a "tree planting association," not only to plant in a 
 public square, secured and forever appropriated, ta 
 this purpose, but also in front of private dwellings, 
 and along the whole line of streets. The expense 
 wo^ild not be felt. Go into tho woods, and make se- 
 lections of some of the finest shaped Oaks, Maples, 
 Magnolias, Beech, Elm, as well as Balsam Fir and 
 White Pine, and other evergreen trees, and occupy 
 one or two seasons in preparing them for being trans- 
 planted, by pruning into proper shape, and then dig- 
 ging around and under them, so as to out off the 
 main roots, and induce a growth of Fibres. In this 
 way, b}' proper preparation, well .shaped, and good 
 sized trees could bo removed, either in Winter with a 
 frozen ball, or early in the Spring, and a surprising
