Gueuou's System of Choosing Milch Cows. 

A new work has lately been issued in England, 
 containing an account of their various breeds of cows, 
 "with a description of the marks by which their 
 milking qualities may be ascertained, together with 
 their management and productive results," by J. H. 
 Magne, Professor of the Veterinary School, and John 
 Ilaston. 

AVe are much pleased to find it fully sustains the 
 theory of Guenon, and corroborates the experience of 
 our Pennsylvania farmers, particularly in the eastern 
 section of the State. Although a notice of Gucnon's 
 book was published with his cuts, some two years 
 ago, in a few of our agricultural exchanges, the sijs- 
 (em was first recommended and urt/ed upon the notice 
 of farmers through the colums of the Pennsylvania 
 Farm Journal. Here it was first experimented upon 
 and fully tested, as will be seen on refering to many 
 articles and communications in our pages, within 
 the last few months. Wo see it is still doubted and 
 ridiculed in some of our eastern journals, but expe- 
 rience is proving it to be one of the most valuable 
 discoveries of the day. 

The booTt above referred to states, "that in a Lon- 
 don dairy of four hundred cows, and where nine- 
 tenths are far above average milkers, the upward 
 growth of the hair on the posterior part of the ud- 
 der, thighs, and perinaeum, was too remarkable to be 
 accounted for by accidental causes." In Mr. Leon- 
 ard's stock of forty dairy cows on his farm of W ater 
 End, Gloucersteshire, probably the finest pack in the 
 country, the uniform developement of the upward 
 growth of hair, on the udder and perinseum is very 
 remarkable on all the best cows. Two cows very 
 much like each other, of the same age, and both 
 bred from the same bull, were pointed out as having 
 something peculiar in their relative powers of milk- 
 ing. Upon examination one of them was found to 
 have a very superior scutcheon, while that of the 
 other was as much inferior. The former was a first- 
 rate milker, while the other was one of the worst in 
 the whole pack ! 

We recommend our farmers who have not pur 
 chased Guenon, to procure one without delay. 

the liberal expenditure required is no less so to the 
 intelligence and enterprise of the proprietor, David 
 Leavilt, Esq. We should like to visit this barn, when 
 completed, and also to see the/arm and farm man- 
 agemeni thoroughly carried out in accordance with 
 it. 

Those of our friends about erecting Farm Build- 
 ings, will do well to consult Professor Wilkinson, as 
 he has had much experience, and is prepared to fur- 
 nish plans adapted for every variety of situation and 
 modes of farming. 

Cascade Barn. 

We give in another page an engraving, with plan 
 and description of this barn, the judicious arrange- 
 ments of which, both general and minute, are well 
 worthy of attention. It displays great ingenuity, 
 nnd a thorough understanding of every thing want, 
 ed, as regards comfort, convcni::!nce, and economical 
 management. Such buildings and fixtures, could 
 only bo wanted, and could only bo used, where the de- 
 sign was to carry on an improved system of farming, 
 embracing all that modern science and practice com- 
 bined have proved worthy of adoption. While the 
 design rcficcts great credit on Professor Wilkinson 

Fat Animals at Exiiibitions, 

It has long been one of the great evils of our Ag- 
 ricultural Exhibitions, and indeed often a positive 
 loss to the owner, as well as the whole country, that 
 an animal to obtain a premium, must be subjected 
 lor some weeks or even months, to extra feeding, a 
 kind of forcing process, to make as much fat as pos- 
 sible, and without which, his chance in competition 
 would be slim indeed. All points, whether good or 
 bad, must be covered over with fiit, all rough places 
 filled up, so as to make a round, barrel shaped form , 
 the consequence of which often is the animal is ru- 
 ined, and never recovers his natural condition. This 
 excessive fatness is a state of disease, which often de- 
 stroys the procreative powers, and renders him or 
 her worthless for breeding purposes. This is well 
 known to farmers. The practice is altogether wrong, 
 aud should be discountenanced by committees at ex- 
 hibitions, and in the regulatiofts of our agricultural 
 societies. Let it be generally understood, that no 
 animal, whether of neat cattle, horses, swine, sheep, 
 or even poultry, which bear evidence of having been 
 pampered up for a special purpose, and thus injured 
 forbreeding, can,excej)t when intended for slaughter, 
 be entitled to a premium. If committees &x& judges as 
 they ou(jht to be, they could decide if the disposition 
 to fatten, (which is all that is wanted,) exists, with- 
 out this very unnatural and injurious forcing pro- 
 cess. The present system is a great evil, and should 
 be remedied. The selection of experienced men as 
 judges of stock, who can recognize a good form, in 
 any condition of the animal, is perhaps the true rem- 
 edy. 

Moutour County Agricultural Society. 

The Exhibition of the Mountour County Agrieul- 
 tural Society, will take place on Friday and Satur- 
 day, the "Ist and 22d days of October next, in the 
 borough of Danville. 

The farmers of all parts of the county should en- 
 deavor to be well represented at this Exhibition. 
 Make preparation in time. 

Never consider anything a trouble that has in it 
 the remotest likelihood of success.
