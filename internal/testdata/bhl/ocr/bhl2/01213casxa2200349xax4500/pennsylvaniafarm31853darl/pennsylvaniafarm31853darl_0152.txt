• We ?ive above an engraving of Dederick's patent 
 Parrallel, L3ver and Horizontal Hay Press. . To it 
 was awarded tlie silver medal for the best Hay Press, 
 at the last exhibition of the New York Agricultural 
 Society, held at Utica. It is said to possess many 
 advantages over the Vertical or upright Press,among 
 which are: 

1. It does not require to be taken apart or let down ( 
 or loaded on a wagon to be moved; but may be drawn 
 anywhere about a farm, directly upon its own shoes 
 secured underneath. 

2. To fill the box requires neither platform nor up- 
 per floor. This labor, together with securing and 
 removing the bale when pressed, is all done conve- 
 niently upon the ground. 

3. The upper doors opening the entire length of 
 the press, readers the filling and packing of the box 
 convenient and comparatively easy. 

4. It is so constructed that by. withdrawing 12 
 bolts it can be taken apart, when desired ; and the 
 heaviest part carried by two men — a great conveni- 
 ence for storing, &c. 

5. The doors open easily. The door handle may 
 be raised with one hand. There is no occasion for 
 using a hammer or maul. 

6. By the peculiar arrangement of the parallel le- 
 vers an almost entire removal of friction from the'fol- 
 lower; so that, requiring neither legs nor guides, it 
 moves forward on a roller attached underneath, in a 

perfjetly straight and upright p03ition,without losing 
 any power by tilting, binding, &c. 

Price No. 1, 400 lbs. to the bale, 8150. No. 2,300 
 lbs', to the bale, ?135. No. 3, 250 lbs. to the bale, 
 8125. Paschall Morris & Co.", 380 Market Street, 
 Philadelphia, are agents for the s.ale of this machine, 
 to whom letters post-paid, for farther information 
 may be addressed. 

A good Hay Press is one of the very valuable im- 
 plements for the farmer, whichis being much enquir- 
 ed for,in sections convenient to means of transporta- 
 tion. The rapidly increasing consumption of hay in 
 our large cities, and the high rents of buildings adap- 
 ted for storing away any large quantity in bulk, ai-e 
 making these machines almost a. matter of necessity. 
 Bales of moderate size are being kept at various 
 ivarehouses and points in Philadelphia, convenient 
 for use by dray and cart horses, where owners can 
 feed it to them, when in a small compass, during the 
 day in the intervals of labor,thus saving the expense 
 of stabling. The Consumption in this way and by 
 omnibus horses, to say notliing of private establish- 
 ments is immense. AVe know that many farmers are 
 unused to selling hay, and consider it ruinous to 
 their farms. The same rule h .wever, applies to this 
 as to other crops. If every thing is sold off and no- 
 thing returned, of course impoverishment results. If 
 part of the hay crop is sold, its place must be sup- 
 plied with sown corn fodder, and the use of guano 
 and other fertilizers, plaster,lime, &c. The. compost
