 It is even getting imported largely for some years

ClcJiori'um iidyhus. This is a plant which produces 
 a very early and prolific fodder. Inhere is no plant 
 that Will stand drouth better than this. It is also 
 very useful as a pasture or to cut and give to cattle 
 in the stall, or soil them with it. The chicory is most 
 excellent for CoVvs, Oxen or Hogs. No plant culti- 
 vated for fodder will bring .an equal' return with 
 Chicory. It ixlis'ft ers well to sow the Chicory with 
 red clover, half of the one and half of the other ; as 
 it does well on either strong or light soil, if they have 
 some bottom^ 

It may be sown in the Spring or Midsummer, and 
 even in September, either by itself or with Oats, B.ar- 
 ley, &c., at the rate of 12 lbs. per acre. It lasts 3 
 or 4- years in the ground : the roots of which Chicory

To cen.suro or find fault adds us no friends, but 
 makes us enemies of those Whose delusions we have 
 to combat. It 18 a disagreeable task. I reluctantly 
 undertake it for the good of the farming interest. 

In reading the account of the cattle sale of Mr, 
 vSherwood, brings my assertion, I made in the De- 
 cember Number of 1852, and the March Number of 
 1853f in the Farm Journal to my recoollection. 
 None have refuted my assertion, we are left in the 
 dark. Nonel^^as explained to us the extraordinary 
 qualitv of these cattle sold by Mr. Renick, in Chili- 
 cothe, for 2825 dollars a-piece,and at Mr. Sherewood 
 for 500 dollars. 

•The conclusion of every reflecting farmer i. , that 
 the soil has to supply the necessary material to pro- 
 duce milk. In proportion as the' soil is improved, so 
 is the stock of cattle improved and the quantity and 
 quality of railk. That is an incontestible fact. Far- 
 mers who have some hundreds of dollars to spare 
 and should be tempted to j rooure these extraordi- 
 nary breeds of cattle, first should consider if their 
 Eoii.possess the proper ingredients, to produce that 
 great quantity of milk, unless the seller of such high 
 priced cattle should prove that those cows possess 
 that extraordinary quality, to draw the supply for the 
 production of milk from the atmosphere. If they 
 don't.poss'ess that quality,tlie sale of such high priced 
 cattle is' an unfair deception to cxt6rt money for 
 which no real value is given. 

If Mr. Myers, who bought, at the Chilicothe sale, 
 LordNehon for §2825, had spent that money in 
 guano.poudrette, bone dust, gypsum and lime, on his 
 land, it would have improved bin stock more then a 
 doxen of such Nelsons. That with some cows the 
 milk organs are'better developed than in some otheTs 
 is admitted, but that is not inherent to a particular 
 breed but found in all thediffercntbrceds. Mr. Guen*
