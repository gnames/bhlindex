The 3Ue of this barn, being across a ravine, throu^'h which flows a 
 perennial atreaiu. su.li:ient for a saw mill, an I the banks behig of a 
 aufficieiit height and boldness to admit of cnteniu; the third story 
 of the building in the gables at either end , with any easy grade, and 
 of driving te^uii th ough frum either way— it possesses advan- 
 tages as deilrable as they are rare. The view of the elevation is from 
 the N. W. Tiie length of the upper or third story ,is to be 20U fect,and 
 just Spans the ravine; the second story ItiD feetvand the first 120feet, 
 The heio'iiL of thj reipectlve stories, beginning with the first, is 13 
 feet, 12 feet, and 15 feet, and from the top of upper girth topea.it, 14 
 feet more ; Vhoie height of from floor of basement to pealt, 54 leet. 

The roof Is to be a true arc, of 4J feet span, (the width of the build- 
 ing,) and rises 16 feet; the material for it is to be the biJsL '■ leaded tin" 
 with a well proportioned cupola in the centre, and two large sky-lights. 

The material of the buiidiug is to be wood, except the lower story, 
 on both sides, and the second story on oije side, which is to be stone- 
 the latter wall, two stories in height, to form the wall of the dam of 
 a pond for water-power, ice and flsh,as well as that portion of the wall 
 of the buililiiig; thusservinga double purpose, and economising in a 
 great degree in both material and labor, All the stouesfor the walls* 
 and the niijoi" p irL of tne timber, are to be obtained Irom the farm. 

By building the basement story but I2J feet inlength, and projecting 
 the second one over it 2J ftet at each end. and again projecting the 
 third story over the second in like manner, and by building curved ter 
 race drive- ways in the banks of the ravine, which diverge on the low- 
 er side of tiie building, an easy ingress and egress is provided to each 
 story, entirely througa which, teams and vehicles may be driven. 

The bascujntis deslgUv,-d lor storing manure, exclusiveof the room 
 required for the water wheel; whit;h is to be overshot, twenty horse 
 power, a drive way 13 feet wide, the entire length of story, and a nar- 
 row passage to a vinegar cellar, as seen at at d,in ground plan A. This 
 cellar and that directly over St, each 12 feet in depth, are under a part 
 of the building ijrojectiaglatteraily from the main building into the 
 embankq^nt on the upper side, or towiirds the pond, and are 30 by 40 
 feet. The cellar level with the second story, Is for roots, and may be 
 entered without ascending or descending— the convenience of which 
 for conveying roots from the cellar to the stables in the second story, 
 to which it is mainly devoted, will be too obvious to need a coumient. 

The roots are precipitated into the bins, o, at the cellar through a 
 trap door In the floor B. They fall from the carts through the trap 
 door, as seen in ground plau B, upon a double, movable, oblique riddle 
 made of ,'4 inch wire. The length of the upper riddle being 2 feet 
 greater than the under one, and the meshes of it larger, so that it,(the 
 upper one,) will convey the larger roots to bins n est to the walls,the 
 dirt and the smaller roots falling through it, and the latter being depos- 
 Bited into an inner row of bins, the dirt falling into a funnel sliaped 
 hopperattached to the lower side of the riddle, which deposltsitinto 
 a car, that is also used on the rail-way on ^\-hich it stands to receive 
 the dirt, for conveying roots, cut fodder, itc , to the cattle for feeding. 

All the manual labor required In fee ding the cattle with roots, raw 
 or steamed, or chopped fodder, roots, meal, Ac, mixed and steamed, is 
 to run a car which contains 35 bushels of provender, before the Hue Of 
 cattle, about 50 in '^u"iber,aBd shovel the food into the •feeding box- 
 es. 

The feeding boxes are of cast Iron, quadrant shaped, of about one 
 • bushel capacity, and there is one to each stall. These boxes are placed 
 one on each side of a partition, that divides two stalls, and are each 
 attached at the right angle corner of the box to the front partition stud 
 by hinges, so that the boxes may be swung around Into the feeding 
 hail, in front of the cattle, and over the feeding car,that the feed which 
 spills in fllUng the boxes, may fall into the car instead of on the floor. 
 After the boxes are filled they are turned with a slight touch before the 
 cattle again. In the centre between the next or adj oinlng pair of stalls 
 is an erect cylinder, two feet in diameter at the bottom, and one foot 
 eight inches at the top, which projects equally into each stall, and ex- 
 tends from about a horizontal line with the tops of feed boxes; (on the 
 opposite side of the stalls,) to the upper surface of the hay-loft floor, 
 directly over the cattle, that it may be filled with hay from that floor 
 and thus avoiding all the Inconvenience and loss occurring when the 
 hay is thrown from the mow to the cattle floor before it is fed. 

The tube is made of pine staves three-quarters of an inch thick, put 
 together and hooped up like an upright churn. There is a circular ap- 
 erture six inches In diameter in each side of the hay tube, at a conve- 
 Dient height from the floor, so that two animals may eat from the 
 same tube at the same time. Under the tube is a drawer Into which 
 all the loose hayseed falls through its latticed bottom ; which drawer 
 when full is emptied ; and when a large quantity of seed accumulates, 
 i t Is cleaned for use or market, The seed thus obtained is of a supe- 

rior quality, and the quantity ordinarily saved by this arrangement 
 will pay for all the manual labor required about the building through* 
 out the year. 

Across the front of the stalls there is also an ordinary box manger,dl' 
 rectly under wiiich, and running the whole length of the stable. Is a 
 trough for water, with suitable openings In the bottom of the manger 
 through which the cattle may be watered by removing the iron slides 
 that close them, w^ich is done by means, of a lever, opening 
 the line of slide s at once and in an instant. The economy of thlsar- 
 rangementwill be apparent to all. 

Many will doubtless say that such facilities for watering stock can 
 rarely be provided. But to such I would reply, that even when the 
 site of the building is level, and without any running water, I have 
 a plan for a rainwater cistern that wil 1 serve the same purpose with- 
 out the use of a pump. [A detailed des crlption of this cistern, being 
 foreign to the Subject matter under consideration cannot be embodied 
 in it.] The stables are lighted by large windows In the rear o f the an- 
 imals, through which also pure air has ingress, and the rarifled orim" 
 nure escapes through ventilators in the roof. 

On a plane with the stable floor, and only 20 feet distant from the 
 stable, (that space being under a 20 feet projection of the upper story) 
 is the dairy or milk cellar. It Is made by arching over an excavation 
 under the northern entrance to the third story. The length to this cel- 
 lar is such that ample room Is provided for a dairy, wash and churn- 
 ing room, a milk vault of proper capacity to contain the milk of 50 
 cows; and In the extreme rear of the vault, Is a Spacious ice house, 
 opening to the milk apartment, which is ventilated by iron pipes ma- 
 soqed into the arch and projecting to the surface of the ground, the 
 top of the tubes being covered to exclude raln,ic. Tlicre are also iron 
 ventiducts laid in the pavement of the dairy, open at the base of the 
 outer wall, providing ingress for pure air at the bottom. The impor- 
 tance of the thorough ventilation of a dairy house is not generally 
 understood— or if understood, is not heeded. 

[The designer of this plan of buil<iings is convinced from 30 years ex- 
 perience and close observation, that the best "spring-house," for the 
 dairy, is one without lodtor— as the desired temperature can always be 
 attained by increasing the depth of a cellar.] 

The refuse of the dairy— [the whey, sour milk and buttermilk]— arc 
 all emptied into an enamelled Iron funnel connecting with iron leaders 
 that convey it to a reservoir in the feeding hall of the pigsties. The 
 churn is a revolving cylinder, the churning power Is that used for all 
 other purposes In the building, water. The whole an'angement of the 
 dairy department of this farmstead, it will be seen, is such that nil op- 
 erations can be performed with the least possible exposiire and labor, 
 and the greatest profit. 

When the roots are to be steamed for feeding, the car Is tilled in the 
 root cellar, by running it under the front of the bin from which Ihe 
 rt>ots are to be taken, and by lifting a slide in front of the bin, the car 
 Is filled, after which it is nm out into the steaming room by the side 
 of the steaming box, when the body of the car containing the roots is 
 hoisted by water power to a level with the top of the steaming box, 
 at which point it strikes a hook that precipitates Its contents Into the 
 box. 

The roots are steamed whole, and the box filled with alternate lay- 
 ers of roots and chopped fodder; the latter falls Into the box from the 
 floor over it. The. form of the steaming box is cylindrical— the length 
 ten feet, the diameter four feet. It Is hung on Journals attached to 
 the centre of each head, one of which has on It a pulley for a belt. 

When the contents of the box are sufficiently steamed, the bran, or 
 meal, designed to be mixed with them, is put into the box, and four 
 cannon balls of ten pounds weight each are also thrown in, the door 
 closed, the belt adjusted, and the power applied. It is revolved gently 
 until all the ingredients in the box are thoroughly incorporated and 
 reduced to a pulp. In which form they are fed to both cattle and sheep. 
 When thus prepared, the contents of the box are drawn out Into the 
 car, by placing it under the box,and opening the door— after which the 
 car is run before the cattle and the steamedmeslln fed while warm. 

The thirdfloor C, isoccupiedby a drive-way a, 13 feet wide the en- 
 tire length of the building ; c carriage house, b henery, d and e mows 
 for hay, grain, Acv/'farmer's house, p cider mill, ^ threshing machine, 
 t threshing floor. J trap doot, k lodgings for workmen. 

There Is a lino shaft extending the entire length of the building In 
 the peak, on which are drums two feet in diameter, at intervals of 25 
 feet; each of which is supplied with a strong rope attached to a power 
 pitching fork, and when required, six or eight loads of hay may be un- 
 loaded and placed in the mows at once, dispensing with all manual 
 labor except to insert the fork Into the hay of the vehicle. Another 
 advantage of this line of drive-way. Is, that it admits of driving eight 
 ornine loads of hay under shelter in case of a shower, or at evening 
 to be unloaded in the morning while the dew Is on, in wlilch state 
 grain nor grass should ever be cut. 

The loft of the building over the root cellar Is used for acorn crib, 
 and isopen to the loft of the main building, so that corn may be shcl.
