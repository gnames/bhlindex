Jed and cleaned in this lot't, imd be carried by elevators and conductors 
 to the grain bins in granaries near the carriage house. The lower story 
 of this side building is used for sawing wood, boring fence posts, 4c. , 
 and is supplied with awork- bench,turaing lathe and other necessaries 
 of a carpenter's shop. 

The machine fer chopping hay, straiwand stalks. Is on the left of the 
 •nainbuildSng near the mows, and all the straw and stalks are chop- 
 ped for litter, as well as for feeding. The machine is designed to cut 
 ten bushels per minute, and Will receive and chop whole bundles of 
 stA'ks as fast as a man can place them in the box . 

An Iron plpo, seven Inches in diameter, is laid In the dam, and mns 
 through the building under the floor of the second story, in which it 
 may be tapped at any point where water is renuired In the building. 
 It Is also to have a coupling for a hose on the under side of it, directly 
 over the culvert, which conveys the water from the wattei'-wheel, for 
 the purpose of washing vehicles, roots, &c. 

The vehicles stand on a lattice bridge, in the drive way of the lower 
 story, or cellar, over the culvert, so that the dirt falls into the culvert 
 «nd is washed into the Housatoniic river, which is within 400 yards. 
 Among the numerous advantages of this arrangement for washing 
 vehicles, is that of admitting of the work being comfortabjy per- 
 Corraed, when the weather i^ so <;oid or stormy out of doors as 
 to render it impracticable, and by the use of a large hose with 24 feet 
 faead, the work is gi-eatly facilitated. 

The cost of this iuaiaense building, serving as it does, for a farmer's 
 house, lodgings for farm laborers, the dairy, and all the purposes here- 
 in before mentioned, water-wheel and machinery, Ac., is estimated at 
 .about ten thousand dollars, and it ts believed that it will far exceed in 
 poiut of convenience, economy of labor and general nrotit, any build- 
 ing of the kind in tiiis or any other country. 

The Designer and Atchitect, of this building would respectfully soli- 
 K:it orders for plans for Fiirm Buildings of every description, in any 
 part of the count'-y. Having given much attention to the subject for 
 .years, he has on hand a variety of plans adap ted to all peculiari ties of 
 «lte and systems of farmlng,whlch he will furnish on reasonable terms- 
 It is very encouraging and gratiC.N'tng to him, and must be to every In 
 telllgent gentleman who is a Landholder, that the Improvement in this 
 important branch of agriculture, hitherto so defect Ive, and so little 
 understood, is now beginning to enlist the attention of gentlemen of 
 'means, hy whom much will be done in a few years for the melioration 
 •of the ceiidition of the American Farmei*,to whom this plan is respect- 
 fully submitted by the author.

Reapiug and Mowing E^xhibition. 

As there is a very general interest feit to know the 
 result of the trial of these machines, which was ad- 
 vertised to come off at Flowertowo, Moatgomery 
 "County, it may be stated that it was not so satisfac- 
 tory as had been expected, only two mowing ma- 
 chines being entered. Ketchum's, and one manuiac- 
 tiired by Lee, Pierce & Thompson, Ercildoun, Ches- 
 ter county. The former seemed to give most satis- 
 faction to the large number of farmers present, doing 
 its work well, where it had a fair chance, but the 
 grass, (timothy,) was quite thin, and was much 
 tramped down by tho spectators. We know of sev- 
 eral of Ketchum's machines in use, and working to 
 entire satisfaction. It is perhaps the best motper 
 now out, at least in this part of the country, and will 
 cut an acre of grass readily in twenty to thirty min- 
 utes, one man and a pair of horses is all that is re- 
 quired to manage it. 

Three reaping machines were entered, two of Hus- 
 sey's, and ene in combination with the mower, by 
 Lee, Pierce & Thompson, the grain being a heavy 
 crop of rye. The latter received the premium of $50. 
 Ilussey's was objected to by many, on accoutit of 
 throwing the grain behind the machine, requiring 

the track to be cleared by the binders, before the 
 cutting of the next swathe. 

It is much to be regretted, manufivcturers and pat- 
 entees did n.it avail themselves of this opportunity of 
 exhibiting the practical working of their machines. 
 There is a wide spread feeling of interest about it, and 
 this season's difficulty in procuring labor, makes it 
 a matter of certainty, as well as necessity, that by 
 another year there will be a very large demand for 
 them. The only hesitation among farmers is, as to 
 which is the 6es<. New patents for them are multi- 
 plying all over the country, the last invention of 
 course always being superior to its predecessors. 
 . The Prairie Farmer, published at Chicago, speaks 
 highly of Danforth's mowing machine, as able to 
 "cut any thing that is cutahle" with the scythe, no 
 matter how thick or matted at the bottom, old or 
 young, wet or dry, and may be driven three days 
 without the application of a whetstone." Price for 
 mower, $100; mower and reaper, $115. 

We also see advertised in New York papers, Fa- 
 ber's grain harversters, Schonebley's reaper and mow- 
 er, and Atkin's self-raking reapers. 

The inventive genius of the country seems always 
 equal to any emergency. Let it only be ascertained 
 that a certain implement is wanted, and they will ac- 
 cumulate almo.?t like the "improved" cooking stoves, 
 and bee hives. We think the price of reaping and 
 mowing machines has been too high heretofore. The 
 expense of construction will warrant a considerable 
 reduction, and the amount of sales in conseqiience, 
 will more than make up the difference. 

We believe there was to be a trial exhibition in 
 New York the past month, the result of which we 
 shall advise our readers. Manny's reaper and mower, 
 which has a high reputation, and took the first prem- 
 ium there last season, was not brought to the ground 
 at our late trial in Montgomery county. 

Guano and Super Pliosphate of L.ime for Wheat 
 aud Crass. 

One of our subscribers, James II. Alexander, of 
 Mifflin county. Writes us for information about ap- 
 plying Guano for wheat. He inquires, is 200 Ib.s. of 
 No. 1, Peruvian Guano, equal to the usual dressing 
 of barn-yard manure? How can we judge of the 
 quality of Guano ? How is it prepared? At what 
 price can it be obtained? Is it as certain as barn- 
 yard manure ? 

Most of the answers to above questions, will be 
 found in our present number, by farmers in this 
 county, who speak from their own experience, and 
 whose statements are entirely reliable. Much more 
 of the same purport could be given. 

Tho best way for farmers to test tho quality of 
 their Guano, is to be careful of the sources where 
 they purchase it. The only preparation needed, is to 
 pulverise the lumps on the barn floor or in a bo.v
