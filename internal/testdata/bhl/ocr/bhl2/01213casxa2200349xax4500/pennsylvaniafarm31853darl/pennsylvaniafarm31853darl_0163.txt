Agricultural Address by William Hartley, Esq. 

•We regret having room only for tlie following ex- 
 tracts from an excellent address, delivered by Wm. 
 Hartley, on the 2d of May last, in the town of Bed- 
 ford, before the Bedford County Agricultural Socie- 
 ty. There are other counties in our State, where the 
 farmers want "waking up," to avail themselves, to 
 better advantage of their fine soil, and fortunate lo. 
 cation, near the line of public impi-ovement^. As is 
 remarked, hucksters and traders are every year work- 
 ing their way farther west from the Atlantic cities, 
 in quest of eggs, poultry, butter, fruits, &c.. to pla- 
 ces heretofore inaccessible. The whistle of the loco- 
 motive, with its long trains eastward and westward, 
 has broken upon the stillness of our forest homes, 
 and brought many a fertile farm within easy reach- 
 ing distance of a good market. Our farmers in the 
 interior should indeed "wake up" to this new state of 
 things, and see what kind of produce will yield them 
 the best return. 

As "the strength of a Nation depends on its Ag- 
 riculture, and by it, its independence is secured," in 
 the same ratio stands the strength and independence 
 of a county. And until the farmers of Bedford 
 county wake up and do something for their benefit, 
 all pulling together, we will be more prosperous, and, 
 perhaps, may be in a worse condition, it worse can 
 be. Let us endeavor to gain all the knowledge of 
 our vocation that we can — let us keep the best of 
 stock, especially of such animals as are adapted to 
 our climate — and, Sir, any man that is able to keep 
 stock at all is better able to keep good stock than bad 
 — though it may cost more at first, in a short time 
 his money will come back, bearing with it a big profit, 
 and we need not fear that by the time we become 
 possessors of a fine breed of animals that prices will 
 decline. Not so! — fine stock even in old England 
 still commands its former prices — and fine stock 
 every where will always bring high prices, at least 
 until after all who are in this house have returned to 
 dust. In the Eastern States men who have been no- 
 torious for rearing fine animals for twenty and thir- 
 ty years back, still receive high prices — still are a- 
 massing wealth from this source, and by it benefit- 
 ing their fellow men. 

Then, let us, in the first place, judkiously improve 
 our stock. Why keep one of these long-nosed, land- 
 ihark, suti-Jish breed of hogs, when abetter, less mis- 
 chievous, easier kept animals, can be procured at a 
 cost comparatively but little higher. Let us improve 
 judiciously, but not extravagantly, our farms, and, 
 my word for it, in a short time railroads, plank 
 roads, and all this sort of thing will come to us. 
 Let us do our part, and there is no doubt but that 
 Commerce will be wide awake to her interests, and 
 channels ot various kinds will be opened for the 
 interchange of commodities. Yet, Sir, there is great 
 reason to believe that our present amount of produce, 
 though limited compared with what it might be, and 
 •our natural advantages are such that we should not 
 wait for a railroad to come to us — but that we should 
 with united elFort, make one, which will hasten the 
 prosperity which we, by following this course, will be 
 sure to acquire. In a few years we will be deserted 
 by the western cattle, which consume so much of our 
 hay, corn and other produce, and affect the market 
 to a considerable extent, directly and indirectly, 
 throughout the whole country. 

And, Sir, should a railroad be made to connect 
 with either Broadtop or any other road, which would 
 open a direct channel to the eastern market, and 
 pass directly through our county, our best market 
 would be tlie iron works, which would spring up in 
 every part of our county. Forges and furnaces 
 would arise in every recess of our mountains, giving 
 labor to hundreds of men and horses, and thereby 
 consuming the produce of the farmer. Hucksters 
 would spread over our county, buying our poultry, 
 butter, eggs, and even many things which every far- 
 mer now lets go to waste. {Witness the price of but- 
 ter and eggs last winter, which was caused by the 
 f\ict that these traders catne, in some instances, fifty 
 miles from the railroad depots, and offered these al- 
 most unprecented prices.) Besides, our land would 
 be valued almost, if not entirelj', as high as if it were 
 in Chester county, for, while our Chester county far- 
 mers are hitching up and driving to market, we 
 could have our produce there in nearly the same time, 
 perhaps with little greater expense, but, all things 
 considered, with at least equal profits. 

The Delaware Horticultural Society 

Will hold its Annual Exhibition on Wednesday and 
 Thursday, the 14th and 15th of September, in the 
 Odd Fellows' Hall, Wilmington. The schedule of 
 premiums for the occasion is quite liberal and exten- 
 sive, and if we may judge of the previous displays 
 of the Society, the coming Exhibition will be well 
 worth visiting. The Society will pay the cost of 
 transportation upon all articles from a distance, sent 
 by public conveyance. They may be addressed to 
 William Canby, No. 131 West street, Wilmington. 

tist of Patents— New Butter Worker. 

The continuation of these, is unavoidably crowded 
 out this month. Hereafter we hope to insert them 
 more regularly. Among others of great interest to 
 farmers, we obseirve a patent has been granted to 
 our friend, E. J. Dickey, of this county, for an im- 
 proved butter worker, which, from what we have 
 heard of it, will be a very complete affair. A real- 
 ly good article for this purpose, dispensing with the 
 use of the hand to the butter, has long been wanted. 
 We shall advise dairymen, so soon as they are ready 
 for sale, and where they can be obtained. 

Centre County Agricultural Exhibition. 

The annual exhibition of the above Society will 
 be held on the 5th, Cth and "th days of October nest. 
 Place not stated. We have received a list of prem- 
 iums, embracing stock of all kinds, including mules 
 and jacks, agricultural implements and productions, 
 dairy and honey, fruit, vegetables, bacon and hams 
 household manufactures, flowers, and a ploughing 
 match. The list of judges, and regulations for the 
 fair are also publishe 1. 

Feeding red pepper to the hogs with their food, is 
 said to be good for the kidney worm.
