In a former letter I concluded my remarks on the 
 action of lime applied to the soil, and suggested the 
 manner in which it should be applied. Without 
 venturing the assertion, that I have pointed out all 
 its functions in the soil, I should nest in order, dis- 
 cuss its importance as a constituent of the plants that 
 derive their sustenance partly from the soil. 

I will, however be obliged to turn aside from the 
 direct order and at present throw out some ideas on 
 the subject of its manufacture or preparation. 

Lime has been in use as a cement, from a very re- 
 mote period. In Europe it is prepared by calcina- 
 tion, in kilns, heated, for the most part, with fuel, in 
 many respects, analagous to wood. In the United 
 States, until very lately, wood has been the only 
 fuel employed in its manufacture. Of late years the 
 scarcity of wood, and the increased facilities for ob- 
 taining coal, has given rise to the use of coal as a 
 substitute. Kilns have been constructed in which 
 coal alone is used ; others interlard â–  the limestone 
 with coal, and use wood under the arch to start the 
 fire. The lime manutactured by the use of coal 
 alone, is not considered of as good a quality as the 
 lime made from the same materials, in the heating 
 of which even a portion of wood is employed, and 
 neither ot these will compare with the old-fashioned 
 wood-l)urnt lime. There is no doubt that this diifer- 
 ence really exists, and if wood could be used at as 
 little expense as coal, no coal-burnt lime would be 
 made. For the best kind of masonry coal-burnt 
 lime is never used. 

The objections to coal-burnt lime, are that it is not 
 active, and does not display the same degree of vigor 
 as the wood-burnt lime. 

I am not aware that any one has attempted to ex- 
 plain why this is the case ; and all those who have 
 mentioned the subject have been contented to set it 
 down without further inquiry. 

When a question of this kind is presented to the 
 mind for solutiun,the first enquiry should be: Where- 
 in do the two processes difier ! 

The material in general use, in this country, for 
 the manufacture of lime, is the Domolite. Domolito 
 is a carbonate of lime and a carbonate of magnesia. 
 It contains from 25-100 to 45-100 of carbonate of 
 magnesia. The lime made from it is capable of form- 
 ing the best and most durable cement. It is not so 
 economical for agricultural purposes, because the 
 proportion of carbanate of magnesia found in it, is 
 not as valuable as a like amount of carbonate of 
 lime. Magnesia may to a certain extent play the 
 part of lim! in the soil but it can never be said 
 to be equal to it. The limestones which contain lit- 
 tle or no magnesia are more apt to fall to pieces when 
 heated, and are consequently more inconvenient to 
 handle. Lime made from marble is always disinte- 
 grated. 

Carbonate of lime is composed of Carbonic acid 

and the oxyd calcium. At the ordinary temperature 
 carbonic acid has a very great affinity for lime, so 
 much so that it will deprive the carbonate of potas- 
 sa of its carbonic acid. The affinities between sub- 
 stances is very much diversified by the temperature. 
 Silex will not combine with lime at a low tempera- 
 ture, but will combine with it at high temperatures. 
 Carbonic acid on the contrary will be expelled from 
 its combination with lime by a high tomperature,an(l 
 is capable of great affinity for it at a low one. 

I make no doubt that those who have burnt lime 
 with wood, have attributed the whole effective pow- 
 er to the heat produced, and herein lies the difiSoulty 
 of accounting for the difierence of the results when 
 coal is used as a substitute. With coal any heat can 
 be obtained, however low or high, and (for this pur- 
 pose) it contains no material in sufficient quantity, 
 that could act injuriously. 

Lehigh coal according to Mr. Vanuxen is 
 Carbon, 90. 1 

Water, 6. 6 

Silica, . 1. 2 

Alumina, 1. 1

Heat produced by anthracite coal, when used for 
 the purpose in question has no power except that 
 which is attributable to the heat. Heat is supposed 
 to imbue the constituents of some bodies, perhaps 
 all bodies with repulsion between their particles. 

When heat is obtained by anthracite for the pur- 
 pose of smelting the ores, care must always be had 
 that the coal must be in sufficient excess over the 
 supply of oxygen so that carbonic oxyd be formed, 
 and not carbonic acid. In the case in question the 
 presence of carbonic oxyd could not be of any bene- 
 fit. 

Lime when made in a confined vessel is no better 
 than that made by anthracite coal. The reason is 
 obvious. The same power is used in both cases. 

Let us see what power is used when lime is burnt 
 by the wood process. Heat produced by wood is ac- 
 companied by the elimnation of a variety of gasses 
 and vapors, compounds of Hydrogen and Carbon. 
 Water is also produced and passes with the rest 
 through the kiln and in actual contact with the car- 
 bonate of lime. Carbonic acid is easily reduced to 
 carbonic oxyd at the ordinary temperature of a lime 
 kiln. 

The compounds of Hydrogen and Carbon contain- 
 ing as they do in a wood fire great excess of finely 
 divided carbon, decompose the carbonic acid of the 
 carbonate of lime, and we have a lime produced by 
 elective affinity. 

Experience has shown that lime thus produced is 
 of a bettor quality than that which is produced by 
 heat unaided by elective affinity. 

Having ascertained the cause the next question is 
 can we remedy this defect? 

To be able to make as good lime with anthracite
