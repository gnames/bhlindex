as with wood, is impossible unless we resort to some 
 means by which we can procure a reducing fire, cal- 
 culated to reduce carbonic acid to carbonic oxyd. 

If we could bring the carbon of the coal into im- 
 mediate contact with the carbonate of lime, the de- 
 sired effect would be produced. But carbon is not 
 volatile when in its uncombined state and we are un- 
 able to effect any such contact. To pulverize the 
 limestone and the coal and heat them together would 
 do to a certain extent, but would be too expensive. 
 The production of carbonic oxyd by its combustion 
 will not do ; carbonic oxyd cannot act as a reducer 
 of carbonic acid. 

If a gun barrel is filled with iron filings or bright 
 card teeth and heated red hot,and a current of steam 
 be passed through it, the steam will be decomposed 
 and Hydrogen will escape at the other extremity,and 
 the oxygen will unite with the iron. 

If after we have completely converted all the iron 
 in the gun barrel, into an oxyd of iron, we continue 
 the heat and cause the same hydrogen to pass back 
 through the tube, the oxygen of the iron, will reunite 
 with tiie hydrogen, and water will be formed, and 
 the metalio iron will bo as before we commenced. 

The same phenomsn i will take place in a lime k iln 
 only in a ditfereat way. If when we have the anthra- 
 cite fire incandescent, and the supply of air over- 
 balanced by the coal, we pass steam through the 
 fire, the steam will be decomposed, and carbonic 
 oxyd will be formed, and hydcogjn be eliminated. 
 Further on this hydrogen will reduce the carbonic 
 acid of the limestone, and water and carbonic oxyd 
 will be produced. 

The manipulation of such a process, of course at 
 first would not be within the province of ordinary 
 workmen, but would require skill to regulate the 
 supply of steam and air. 

A kiln for this purpose would need to be very 
 much of the same construction of those for any ex- 
 pansive fire, and not such as would suit anthracite 
 alone which has no expansion whatever.

Potato Disease. 

A\''e give below, extracted from the London Gar- 
 deners' Chronicle, an account of the new discovery 
 by Professor BoHman, of the Russian Agricultural 
 Institution, viz: that "thoroughly dried Potatoes will 
 always produce a crop, free from disease." Whether 
 the original cause of the rot was induced by un- 
 favorable atmospheric agencies, or as asserted by oth- 
 ers, to be the work of an insect, it is admitted 
 by all, that diseased seed, will tend to perpetuate it, 
 and the theory seems plausible that a high tempera- 
 ture will destroy the vitality of this diseased, organic 
 matter. Much of the phenomena of vegetable life, 
 bids defiance to the most minute scientific research, 

all that we can often attain to, are results, without 
 being able to understand the jjrocess by which they 
 are brought about. It was remarked that the high 
 dried potatoes, not only escaped disease, but pushed 
 with unusual vigor. The Editor of the Chronicle sup- 
 poses this to have been owing to the conversion of 
 the insoluble starch of the potato by the heat, into 
 gum, dextrine and sugar substances immediately sol 
 uble, and ready to be taken into the system. Mr. 
 BoUman's theory, that the disease is expelled by a 
 high temperature, is thus accounted for. 

The account given by Professor Bollman of t' e 
 accident which led to this discovery is as follows : 
 He had contrived a Potato-setter, which had the bad 
 quality of destroying any sprouts that might be on 
 the sets, and even of tearing aw.ay the rind. To har- 
 den the Potatoes, so us to protect them against this 
 accident, he resolved to dry them. In the spring of 
 1850, he placed a lot in a very hot room; and at the 
 end of three weeks they were dry enough to plant. 
 The Potatoes came up well, and produced as good a 
 crop as that of the neighboring farmers, with this 
 difierence only, that they had no disease, and the 
 crop was therefore upon the whole, more abundant. 
 Professor Bollman tells us that he regarded this as a 
 mere accident ; he, however, again dried his seed 
 potatoes in 1851, and again his crop was abundant 
 and free from disease, while everywhere on the sur- 
 rounding land they were much affected. This was 
 too remarkable a circumstance not to excite atten- 
 tion, and in 1852 a third trial took place. All Mr. 
 Bellman's own stock of Potatoes being exhausted, he 
 was obliged to purchase his seed, which bore unmis- 
 takeable marks of having formed part of a crop 
 that had been severely diseased ; some, in fact, were 
 quite rotten. After keeping them for about a month 
 in a hot room, as before, he cut the lai'gest Potatoes 
 into quarters, and the smaller into halves, and left 
 them to dry for another week. Accidentally the dry- 
 ing was carried so far that apprenensions were en- 
 tertained of a very bad crop, if any. Contrary to 
 expectation, however, the sets pushed promptly, and 
 grew so fast that excellent young Potatoes were dug 
 three weeks earlier than usual. Eventually nine 
 times the quantity planted was produced, and, al- 
 though the neighboring fields were attacked,no trace 
 of disease could be found on either the herbage or 
 the Potatoes themselves. 

This singular result, obtained in three successive 
 years, led to inquiry as to whether any similar cases 
 were on record. In the course of the investig ition 
 two other facts were elicited. It was discovered that 
 Mr. Losovsky (living in the government of Witebsk, 
 in the district of Sebege,) had for four years adopted 
 the plan of drying his seed Potatoes, and that dur- 
 ing that time there had been no disease on his estate. 
 It was again an accident which led to the practice of 
 this gentleman. Five years ago, while his potatoes 
 were digging, he put one in his pocket,and on return- 
 ing home threw it on his stove {poele) where it re- 
 mained forgotten till the spring. Having then chan- 
 ced to observe it, he had the curiosity to plant it, all 
 dried up as it was, and obtained an abundant, healthy 
 crop ; since that time the practice of drjdng has 
 been continued, and always with great success. Pro- 
 fessor Bollman remarks that it is usual in Russia in 
 many places, to smoke-dry Flax, Wheat and Rye ; 
 and in the west of Russia, experienced proprietors 
 prefer for seed. Onions that have been kept over the 
 winter in cottages without a chimney ; such Onions
