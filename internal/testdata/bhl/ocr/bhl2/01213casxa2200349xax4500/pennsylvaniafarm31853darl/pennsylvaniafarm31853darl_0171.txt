are called dymka, which may be interpreted smoke- 
 dried. 

The second fact is this: — Mr. Wasileffsky, a gen- 
 tleman residing in the government of Mobileff, is in 
 the habit of keeping Potatoes all the year round by 
 storing them in the place where his hams are smoked. 
 It happened, that in the spring of 1852, his seed Po- 
 tatoes, kept in the usual manner were insufficient ; 
 and he made up the requisite quantity with some of 
 those which had been tor a month in the smoking 
 place. These Potatoes produced a capital crop, very 
 little diseased, while at the same time the crop from 
 the setts which were not smoke-dried was extensive- 
 ly attacked by disease. Professor Bollman is of 
 opinion that there would have been no disease at all 
 if the sets had been better dried. 

The temperature required to produce the desired 
 result is not very clearly made out. IVIr. Bollman's 
 room in which his first Potatoes were dried was heat- 
 ed to about 72°, and much higher. By way of ex- 
 periment he placed others in the chamber of the 
 stove itself, where the thermometer stood at 136°,and 
 more. He also ascertained that the vitality of the 
 Potato is not afl'ected, even if the rind is charred. To 
 this, however, and some other points, we shall re- 
 turn next week. In the meanwhile those who have 
 the use of a malt kiln, or even a lime kiln, might 
 even novr try the efi'ect of excessive drying, for a 
 month seems to be long enough for the process ; and' 
 if Potatoes planted in the beginning of July will 
 not yield much of a crop, it will at least be_seen 
 whether they are attacked by disease. 

"If we admit the Potato disease to be analogous 
 to the gangrene in animals, we must also recollect 
 that it is of two sorts, the one dry and local, which is 
 always the most dangerous — the other wet and dis- 
 persed through the whole structure. The germ of 
 the last form of disease may also be assumed to 
 have been contained in every set of Potatoes since 
 the appearance of the epidemic. But this wet gan- 
 grene IS changed by drying into the local gangrene, 
 which, at a high temperature, wholly looses its con- 
 tagious quality. And thus we obtain a sound crop, 
 because the Poiatoes which we plant are already 
 cured." 

"But the Potato disease may also be a putrid epi- 
 demic, readily communicated to the new crop, and 
 then it may bo compared to those contagious diseases 
 to which men and animals are liable, and which act 
 upon the organization by means of a putrid princi- 
 ple. Now, as all organic matter looses its vitality 
 when exposed to a temperature sufficiently high, so 
 it may be possible that high drying destroys the pu- 
 trid principle, without aflecting the vitality of the 
 Potato itself. It appears that vaccine matter looses 
 its power when exposed to a temperature of 172°, as 
 was ascertained at Oonstantinople in 18-10, by Dr. 
 Rafalovitsch; the virus of the plaguo has been ob- 
 served to disappear in Egypt under similar circum- 
 stances. In another contagious ati'ection peculiar to 
 the human species, it has been demonstrated in the 
 hospitals of St. Petersburgh, by Dr. Kosenberger, 
 that the contagious principle becomes weaker as tem- 
 perature rises, and that the higher the tempei'ature, 
 the more rapidly it was destroyed. For instance, he 
 found it was anniliilated —

 It, therefore, is not unreasonable to suppose that 

the virus of the Potato disease may be destroyed by 
 similar means. 

In these interpretations of Professor Bollman'!? 
 views we have been careful to separate wliat is said 
 to be certain from what is avowedly conjectural, and 
 we now leave the subject to the only tribunal hy 
 which it can be judged — that of general experience."

WOMAN'^ RIGHTS. 

BY MRS. R. UYNEMAN. 

It Isher riclitto bind with warmest ties, 

The lordly sph'ituf aspiring man; 
 Making his home an earthly paradise, 

Kich in all joys allotted to life's span, 
 Twining around each fiber of his heart, 

With all the gentle intluence of love's might. 
 Seeking no Joy wherein he has no part— 

This is undoubtedly— a woman's right I 

It Is her right to teach the infant mind, . 

Training it ever upward in its course. 
 To root out evil pas-sions that would bind 

The upward current of his reason's force ; 
 To lead the erring t; pi rit gently back, 

When it has sunk in gloom of deepest night ; 
 To point the shining path of virtue's track. 

And urge him forward. This is woman's righ^. 

It is her right to soothe the couch of pain; 

There her true mission upon earth to prove, 
 To calm with gentle care the frenzied brain. 

And keep her vigil there of holiest love; 
 To watch untiring by the lonely berl, 

Through the bright day and in the solemn night, 
 'Till health ensnes, or the loved form is laid 

To rest forever. This is woman's right. 

So is a flower, that blossoms best unseen, 
 Sheltered within the precincts of her home; 

There should no darkening storm cloud intervene. 
 There, the loud strife of worldlings never come. 

Let her not scorn to i\Qt a. womuii s part, 
 Nor strive to cope with manhood in its might. 

But lay this maxim closely to her heart- 
 That that which God- ordains is surely right
