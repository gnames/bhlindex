nal elements at its touch. In fact, it is not necessa- 
 ry that the potash should touch the substance of the 
 vegetable; it acta by its mere presence in a near part 
 of the heap, disposing not only that matter which it 
 touches, but all other matter in contact with that 
 which it affects to decay. "Rot makes rot," is an old 
 adage; and so it is in an especial manner with the 
 rot caused by potash. 

All who undertake the cultivation of the earth, 
 either in the field or the garden, should bear in mind 
 these important principles. You may have rich 
 fields, but their riches may not be available to plants. 
 Ashes or potash may be highly important to bring 
 your peat, turf, meadow mud, raw coarse manure, 
 sod heaps, &c., into sufficient action. Lime is useful 
 in small quantities, and so is salt; but I consider 
 large quantities of lime dangerous for many reasons 
 beside that mentioned above. Potash is worth its cost 
 as a manure independent of its power as a decompos- 
 ing agent, and in garden work it is indispensable. 
 Applied in solution, in free quantities of water, it 
 will bring a sod heap in to a better state in sixty 
 days than two years of rotting and turning will effect 
 by the old methods without it. — [Horticulturist. 

Plain Facts lu Agricultural Chemistry. 

BY J. S. nOUGUTO.V, M. D. 

Common stable, from which the urine of animals 
 has escaped, is not a complete manure. 

The above assertion was presented in a previous 
 article, and explained at some length. The chief 
 reason is simply this, that certain parts of the food 
 consumed by animals always go off in solution in 
 the urine, and hence the solid manure alone, no mat- 
 ter how much you may have of it, can never furnish 
 the material to grow ttie same crops upon which the 
 animals were fed, if the urine is lost. 

In intimate relation to this great fact, in the econ- 
 omy of manures, is this other fact, a principb, that 
 every soil must contain all the constituents of the 
 plant to be grown, in sufficient abundance, (and even 
 in excess,) or the most perfect and largest crops can- 
 not be produced. 

One of the chief ingredients of plants, as lime, or 
 plaster of Paris, or salt, or potash, alone, will not, in 
 ordinary cases, be a sufficient addition to the com- 
 post heap; but if the plant requires, as most plants 
 do, five or six leading ingredients, they must bo all 
 there or those which are employed will be, for the 
 time, comparatively lost. 

A very good illustration of this point has been 
 used by Dana. He says that attempting to work the 
 soil without all the ingredients of plants present in 
 sufficient abundance is like a man attempting to 
 build a vessel, thus; he may have all the planks, and 
 ship knees, and spars, and sails, and rigging, all oth- 
 er requisite materials, but no nails and spikes, and 
 he can't possibly build his ship successfully. . Nails 
 and spikes are small matters, compared with the rest 
 of the vessel, but he can't get along without them. 

So it is in farming. You may as well try to build 
 a ship without nails, as to grow the plants with the 
 smallest ingredients in the fertilizing materials re- 
 quired by plants omitted. If you have one favorite 
 manuring agent, say lime, it may be the very thing 
 your plants don't want, while the little thing they do 
 want is neglected. Potatoes need plenty of fresh 
 loam, and little rich manure; corn needs much rich 
 manure. Yet how often do we see farmers planting 
 their patatoes with first rate manure, and planting 
 corn on a freshly turned sod, wi;h scarcely any ma- 
 nure at all. The new sod, I grant, would make good 

manure if it was rotted, but it is doubtful whether its 
 ingredients will become available to the corn the 
 first season. 

With the free use of stable manure it is probable 
 that nearly all the constituents of plants may be 
 present in the manure heap and the soil with the ex- 
 ception of ammonia. This may readily be supplied 
 by guano, when thought necessary. The guano 
 should, of course, be composted for a week or two, 
 before mixing with the manure heap, with a good 
 black loam, charcoal dust, or some other good absor- 
 bent of ammonia, say Plaster of Paris. Rut still, 
 in general culture, some leading constituent of a 
 special crop may be deficient. Fjr potatoes, potash 
 is wanted, in large quantity; for turnips, bone dust; 
 for peas, lime; for clover, plaster of Paris. Now, if 
 a farmer neglects to ascertain whether or not, all the 
 ingredients of a crop are present in sufficient quan- 
 tity, in the manure he intends to use, may ho not, 
 instead of missing the small matter, (like the nails 
 of the ship,) miss the leading material, some thing 
 analagous to the wants of the soils which are the 
 <nost important of all. 

No man, it seems to me, can deny for a moment 
 the necessity of looking carefully into the nature of 
 plants, and the composition of manures, if he de- 
 sires to practice farming with success. I am by no 
 means in favor of recommending to farmers to ob- 
 tain analyses of their soils, because I do not think, as 
 a general thing, they can make any profitable use of 
 them. They may learn the necessity of saving their 
 liquid manure, and the necessity and the art of sup- 
 plying deficient materials in their compost heaps. 

I will endeavor to do what I can towards this de- 
 sirable end, by furnishing a few more plain facts in 
 agricultural chemistry from time to time for circula- 
 tion in the Agricultor. — [New York Agricultor.

Walker's Patent Iron Fence. 

The growing scarcity of timber, suitable for fen- 
 cing purposes, and the consequent high price, are 
 subjects well calculated to challenge the attention of 
 the farmer. Already, the cost of fencing is an oner- 
 ous tax, and with every day the tax is increasing. 
 The question, therefore, naturally arises, how is this 
 growing evil to be remedied ? Three modes suggest 
 themselves: one, by substituting the soiling of cattle, 
 for the now almost universal practice of pasturing, 
 the other by the use of iron instead of wood, for fen- 
 cing, or hedges. 

It is not our intention at this time, to discuss the 
 merits or demerits of soiling cattle, or hedging, re- 
 serving it fur a future article, intending merely to 
 commend to the attention of our readers, the use of 
 the wire fencing; believing that in point of economy, 
 as well as appearance, it is decidedly preferable to 
 the wood.
