IRON FENCE— NEW TANNING PROCESS, &c. 

[Septembeb 

are briefly set forth in the follow description: 

The ahove fence differs from all other iron fences 
 now in use. Although virtually a sectional fence, 
 and susceptible of being readily taken down, in whole 
 or in part, it is nevertheless a continuous connec- 
 tion; the rails connecting with each other by means 
 of the hook and eye, at the end of each rail, the 
 posts being used to bear up the rails at each con- 
 nection. The hook end of the rail occupying the 
 perpendicular slot or mortice, in the post, and just 
 large enough to allow the hook to pass through. 

Cast Iron Sockets, of a peculiar form, for receiv- 
 ing the posts, will be furnished if desired; these are 
 readily driven in the ground, thus saving the expense 
 of digging post-holes, and greatly facilitates the put- 
 tin up of the fence. These are a part of the patent, 
 as also the single iron for corner post; which may be 
 used for straining posts. 

Manufactured by M. Walker and Sons, Philadel- 
 phia, and for sale at the Factory, or at P. Morris & 
 Co., 380 Market street, Phildelphia.

New Tauniug Process. 

We see by the London Mechanic's Magazine that a 
 patent process, named "Prellers," has lately found 
 much favor in London. After the hides and skins 
 are unhairod in the usual manner, they undergo a 
 partial drying, and receive a uniform coating of a 
 peculiar paste composed of various vegetable and sa- 
 line substances. The vegetable substances employ- 
 ed contain large portions of starch, such as barley, 
 rice or wheat flour, a little gluten, some butter, or oil 
 and grease, some common salt, and some saltpeter. 
 The hides are laid upon tables and smeared on the 
 fleshy side, with the said paste, and in that state are 
 put into the interior of large drums, which receive a 
 rotary motion, and by wliich the hides are greatly 
 agitated, and the paste (by pegs in the inside of the 
 drums,) is forced into the pores of the hides or skins, 
 or rather they are kneaded along with the paste for 
 two or three hours, after which they are drawn out. 
 They are then found to be in a partial dry state, then 
 hung up and aired for two hours, and again laid 
 upon the table, where they receive another dose of 
 the same paste.and arc again returned to the drums 
 a second time, when the same operation as that de- 
 scribed is again performed. After this they receive 
 a third smearing with the paste, and are kneaded in 
 the drums, after which they are taken out and hung 
 up to dry, and are then fit for the currying process. 
 The leather thus produced i i stated to be much light- 
 er than that produced by oak or other tan barks, but 
 it is much stronger and will wear much better. It 
 is asserted that for machinery bands it is twice as 
 strong as oak tanned leather, and that sheep and goat 
 skins are rendered very tough and durable. It is 
 said that calf skins arc tanned by this process in 
 about three hours, and the thickest ox hide in three 
 days. 

Application of Wind as a Power for Raising 
 Water. 

To pump from a well the requisite supplies of wat- 
 er, was a work of no small labor. It led to the in- 
 vestigation of a method of working a pump by means 
 of the wind. The practicability of the plan I am 
 about to suggest, does not remain to be tested by ex- 
 periment. During former years, a small windmill 
 was in successful operation upon the farm of Mr. An- 
 derson, five miles, west of Ashland, Ohio, on the 
 road leading to Mansfield. It worked a pump that . 
 amply furnished a large stock of cattle, which other- 
 wise could obtain no water. T.vo days only did it 
 cease to perform its duties during more than two 
 years, and that interruption was occasioned by the 
 meddling of mischievous boys. It is sra-till in ope 
 tion, for aught I know. 

The cost of this simple machine, including pump, 
 did not exceed $15.

By reference to Plate, the principles upon which 
 it was constructed, will be at once comprehended. 
 The direct application of the power, without the in- 
 tervention of any gearing or machinery, obviates 
 much friction, hence a small amount only of po wer 
 is required. The diameter of the wheel should not 
 exceed four feet, a few inches is preferable. It is 
 firmly fixed by its hub on an iron axle, formed of a 
 square inch bar. The sails or buckets are secured 
 at vheir outer ends to a wooden rim, like that of a 
 large spinning-wheel. An inch and a half crank is 
 raised on the axle at B, which, at that point, is c y- 
 lindrical, and upon which is adjusted the upper ends 
 of the piston rod of the pump C. This, when in mo- 
 tion, of course commands a play of three inches.
