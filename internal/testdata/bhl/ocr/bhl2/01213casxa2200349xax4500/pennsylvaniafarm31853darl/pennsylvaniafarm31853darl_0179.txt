WIND MILL-COMMUNICATIONS.

an iron bolt, F, furnished at its lower end with a 
 large head, G, and a washer, and secured by a key, 
 II, at the upper end, admitting of an easy circular 
 motion of D around the bolt. This motion is coinci- 
 dent with that of a swivel on the piston rod, I. The 
 rudder, or vane, will necessariiy throw the wheel at 
 all times into the wind, 'i he axle A, is suspended 
 from the body by two straps of iron, through which 
 it passes to L, L, where it is cylindrical without re- 
 gard to perspective and proportion, but will, perhaps, 
 illustrate the subject sufficiently. 

A breeze which merely agitates the leaves of the 
 trees will set the machinery in operation. A reser- 
 voir of some six or eight hogsheads was kept' nearly 
 filled, and when, in windy weather, a surplus of 
 water was raised, it was returned to the well by a 
 waste-pipe, M. In the hands of an ingenious me- 
 chanic, it might, no doubt, be greatly improved. 
 Iron, in some of its part:, might be substituted for 
 wood. 

A well, suitably located, will furnish water for an 
 ordinary garden, and without labor, by the aid of 
 this mill. IIow much it would improve our flowers, 
 fruits and esculent vegetables, cannot be estimated, 
 but would surely effect a revolution in our present 
 modes of gardening here in the West, where we 
 Buffer much every season from drought. Public tanks, 
 inns, tanneries, and thousands of prairie farms re- 
 quire its aid. Son\e active firm would render the 
 community essential service if they would manufac- 
 ture a supply of these mills and adapt them to some 
 of their improved pumps. 

In all this, gentle reader, there is no Quixotism. 
 Its feasibility has been amply tested.

In connection with the above, we copy the follow- 
 ing appropriate remarks from the Genessee Farmer. 
 There are farms all over New England where their 
 proprietors have been pumping water by hand for 
 large stocks of cattle for a hundred years, when the 
 expenditure of a few dollars in some such contri- 
 vance .as we have given above, would have furnished 
 an ample supply. 

AGRICULTURAL MECHANICS. 

Mechanical science and arts are doing more for the 
 adv.ancementof agriculture in the United States, than 
 all other agencies combined, so far as immediate re- 
 sults are attained. Ultimately, chemistry, physiolo- 
 gy, meteorology, geology, and other departments of 
 the natural sciences, will confer benetits on all in- 
 dustrial pursuits far transcending any mere mechan- 
 ical advantages. Indeed, the most valuable mechan- 
 ical powers, even now, are more the fruits of an in- 
 tellectual culture than of original genius; and the 
 successful study of natural phenomena precedes 
 nearly all important inventions and discoveries. Op- 
 erations that have been practised thousands of years, 
 like those of ploughing, weaving, grinding grain, 
 and pumping or lifting water by wind, are seen from 
 an entirely new point of view by the man of science; 
 and he is able to suggest improvements that never 
 could have occurred to a mind not illuminated by the 
 numerous .and brilliant lights kindled by modern re- 
 searches into the laws of matter. 

We have been led into this train of thought and 
 remark, by perusing, in the Horticulturist, the val- 
 uable article on the "Aprlication of Wind as a Pow- 
 er for Raising Water," from the pen of Prof Kirt- 
 land, of Cleveland, to which the reader's attention is 

invited in this number. By keeping the wheel al- 
 ways in the direct current, if it had any force, the 
 fiances would catch it, and turn the wheel, as a cur- 
 rent water wheel is turned. Such a wheel, with the 
 necessary shaft and crank, may be made of iron for 
 a few dollars; and every one can understand, from 
 the illustration furnished by Prof. Kirtland, that this 
 simple apparatus will work successfully whenever 
 the .atmosphere has any active motion. These cur- 
 rent wheels (they are in no sense mills) and pumps, if I 
 manufactured in a large way, might be sold at prices 
 which would enable every farmer to have a score of 
 them for irrigation, and for the distribution of liqui- 
 fied manure, if he saw fit to make the mech.anical 
 power of the winds create wealth for himself and 
 mankind. 

With durable and cheap machinery, vast quanti- 
 ties of water may be elevated to any desirable height 
 on every farm, for agricultural purposes; and the 
 thanks of the farming community are due to Prof. 
 Kirtland for his very intelligible illustration of a 
 useful wheel and crank to be put in motio i by wind. 
 The water that falls upon every square foot of ground 
 in a field is equal, on an average, in this country, to 
 200 lbs. a ye.ar; and so much of this as descends deep 
 into the earth, and re-appears in wells and springs, 
 always contains both the vegetable and mineral food 
 of plants, (dissolvedout of the oil in passing through j 
 it,) in greater or smaller quantities. In rare instan- '' 
 ces such water is poisoned by an excess of acids, or 
 acid salts. 

For the Farm Jonrnal. 
 Augusta Rose. 

To THE Editors of the F.iRSf Journal: â€” 

In reply 
 to your correspondent respecting this new Rose. I 
 received from the proprietors early the past Spring, 
 a strong plant inoculated, then showing several flow- 
 er buds. They all expanded freely, and presented a 
 perfectly double flower, of large size, very fragrant, 
 and of a rich yellow color, deeper than any Chroma- 
 tella I have yet seen. It appears to be quite a fine 
 bloomer of strong, robust habit, and clearly allied to 
 Solfatare. 

Of its hardihood I cannot speak, not having had 
 an opportunity of tesUng it. I regard it a very fine 
 Rose.

Extract of a letter from the lion. Marshall P. 
 Wilder, of Massachusetts: 

"I am happy to say that, although I had heard a 
 favorable opinion expressed in relation to the merits 
 of this Rose, its beauty exceeded my anticipations. 

"The Augusta Rose is certainly an excellent vari- 
 ety, having in its growth the climbing habit of the 
 Noisettes, while in bloom .and fragrance it seems 
 nearly allied to the Teas. Its foliage is beautiful; its 
 flower is very pure and delicate in color; its form 
 globular and perfect, and although very double and 
 full, appears to expand its buds freely. Considering 
 these valuable characteristics, it may be esteemed as 
 a good acquisition, and worthy of a place among the 
 best varieties extant."
