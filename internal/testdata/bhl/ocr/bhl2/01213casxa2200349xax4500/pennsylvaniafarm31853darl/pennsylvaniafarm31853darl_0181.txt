through water and added to milk of lime, thickens 
 immediately on mixing; the lime in combining with 
 the elements o£ the clay liquifies it, and what is 
 more remarkable, liberates the greater part of its al- 
 kalies. These interesting facts were first observed 
 by Fuchs, at Munich; they explain the efi'eets of caus- 
 tic lime upon the soil, and guide the agriculturist in 
 the application of an invaluable means of opening if, 
 and seitiiiff J'lee its alkalies." 

Johnston's Agricultural Chemistry, the invaluable 
 friend and companion of every tyro in science, con- 
 tains the following statement: 

"Mr. Prideaux has lately proposed to mix up 
 crushed granite and quick lime, to slake them to- 
 gether, and allow them to stand in a covered heap 
 for some months, when it may be applied as a top 
 dressing, and will readily give out potash to the 
 soil." 

In another place, speaking of the alkaline sili- 
 cates found in the ash of the stem and leaves of the 
 ceralia, he says: "When the alkali is set free," (by 
 the agency of carbonic acid,) "the lime itself com- 
 bines with the eilica and hence one scource of the 
 silicate of lime in our cultivated soils." 

Silliman's Chemistry, "designed for the use of 
 Colleges and Schools," also furnishes me another in- 
 tance: 

"Lime is much used in improved agriculture as a 
 manure, it acts to decompose vegetable matter, to 
 neutralize acids, dissolve silica, and retain carbonic 
 acid." 

These quotations, taken from the most popular 
 works, as well as the most reliable authorities, seem 
 to prove very conclusively, that lime will combine 
 with silica either in its isolated state, or when in 
 combination with other substances. 

The latter part of your critique contains a list of 
 arguments brought to prove that the combination of 
 lime with a previously formed silicate would not re- 
 sult in the formation of a double salt. All this is 
 very well, when confined to the neutral silicates of 
 potash and soda, but there are many other silicious 
 compounds in the soil, whose chemical nature you 
 have passed over in silence. 

I hope, before long, to be able to publish in the 
 Farm Journal, a paper that shall contain a lull state- 
 ment of the chemical character of these interesting 
 compounds. 

There is one more point in your article that forci- 
 bly recalls to my mind the pertinent words of the 
 poet; 

"Satire recoils whenei'er chsTg'd too hlRh, 
 Kouml your own fame tUe fatal splinters dy/' 

I speak of the manner in which you have mis- 
 quoted and misconstrued me in several passages. In 
 my communication I made the following statement: 
 "A large quantity of a previously formed silicate 
 possesses the property of combining with an almost 
 jjide&nitely small quantity of a new base (such as ' 

lime.") Here, in comparison with this quotation, I 
 place in your own language, the improper form into 
 which you have transcribed it 

"Let us see what the learned commentator has 
 really put forth in these few linos. He alleges that 
 the silicates are capable of combining at the ordinar ! 
 ry temperature with indefiaitdy small quantities of 
 lime or any other base." ' 

Here you have, by leaving out one word and sub- 
 stituting another, entirely destroyed the sense and 
 meaning of the sentence. 

By erasing the word "almost" before "indefinite- '\ 
 ly," you have found an admirable chance to make it 
 known that my statement was contrary to the theory 
 of definite proportions, in another place by substitu- 
 ting the word "any" you have endeavored to impress 
 your readers with the idea that I had asserted a sil- 
 icate would combine with any base, (no matter 
 whether it was organic or inorganic,) and form a 
 double salt, whereas I distinctly said it was a base 
 (such as lime.) Had not the misquoted sentence 
 been made use of several times, and the remoddeled 
 portion italicised, I would have been compelled to 
 have overlooked it as an accident on your part. 

In conclusion I would remark that although the 
 subject is an interesting one, and also possesses much 
 practical importance, still I believe every thing neces- 
 sary to give us a clear understanding of each other's 
 views has been advanced, and lest the renders of the 
 Farm Journal grow weary of what has degenerated 
 into a rather contentious dispute, I would respect- 
 fully decline any further discussion of the matter.

 Potato Disease. 

J. Lacey Darlington, Esq. 

Dear Sir; — We promis- 
 ed your readers of the July No., the results of our 
 experiment ia regard to an insect making such rav- 
 ages in the wheat field. We regret, however, to say, 
 that the disastrous storm of July 1st, has destroyed 
 our specimeti, although deposited as we thought se- 
 curely, and of which we had many reasons to believe, 
 a full developement of the nature of that mysterious 
 disease. We hope another year, providing it appears 
 again, will enable us to further our experiment., and 
 lay it before the public. 

We would wish to offer a few remarks, as the views 
 which are entertained by Drs. Liebig and Klotxsch, 
 of the potato disease; in part a preventative as well 
 as an increase in quantity and quality. These noble 
 naturalists have very carefully examined the motion 
 of juices, in the animal and vegetal le kingdom, and 
 from the data of their examination it would seem, as 
 if the potato rot is not due to a degeneration of the 
 plantj but to a combination of external causes, and if
