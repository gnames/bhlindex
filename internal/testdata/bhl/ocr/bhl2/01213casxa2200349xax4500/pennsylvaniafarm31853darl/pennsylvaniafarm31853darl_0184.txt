 Fly iu Wheat. 

Mb. Darlington: 

Dear Sir— Mr. E. K. Beaver, in 
 your July No. of Farm Journal, seems to infer from 
 the depredations of the fly on the wheat in Montgom- 
 ery and adjoining counties, that some new insect has 
 made its appearance. lie doubts the eggs being de- 
 posited in the Fall — and in like manner doubts their 
 being deposited in the Spring ! but supposes that — 
 because different fields are differently affected — and 
 the rye escaping the injury, "that the cause maybe 
 looked for in the grain of the wheat prior to sowing." 
 He says, "the deposition of the ova or egg are gen- 
 erally formed above the second joint." Now I would 
 merely suggest — how could the ova or egg remain 
 dormant all Fall and Winter, and then about the 20th 
 of May, crawl up the stem to the second joint? An 
 insect in the ova state evidently has no means of 
 locomotion, and if so, it must be placed by its parent 
 on the spot where found. 

As Mr. B. desires the opinion of others, "on this 
 obscure yet wide spread disease," I send you mine in 
 a few words. Our fields in this vicinity being simi- 
 larly affected, though not to the same extent, we con- 
 sider it nothing more or less than the old pest — Hes- 
 sion fly, having made a deposite of its eggs, late in 
 the Spring, a very frequent occurrence. Indeed I 
 have seen a deposition of eggs in the Fall, and 
 two in the Spring .some years since, the fly hatching 
 out in April, and again in May and June. Had the 
 deposite been made in the Fall, or early in the Spring, 
 the eggs would be found on the first instead of the 
 second joint. I doubt very much if the cause exists 
 in the grain prior to sowing. 

Very respectfully, J. B. GARBER.

Pasture. Seventh, eighth and ninth in rotation is 
 principally devoted to fattening stock for market and 
 grazing horses, cows and oxen for home use, some 
 little to raising lambs for the butcher and butter 
 dairying. By this time, the natural grasses from 
 spontaneous growth, claim preeminence. First in value 
 for its early growth, quick renewal and nutritious 
 qualities, is the green grass, poa pratensis; next the 
 blue gras, poa compressa, white clover, trifolium re- 
 pens, and red top, agrostis vulgaris; these mainly 
 contribute to the high estimate placed upon the Bran- 
 dywine hills and meadows, for grass feeding. As in- 
 timated in a previous number, this branch of farm- 
 ing is comparatively of modern date. The early sel- 
 lers were grain raisers upon an exhausting system, 
 and so successful had they been in this, that though 
 William Penn described these lands in his day, "as 
 three times richer than the front lands," or those 

nearer the rivers, by the Assessor's list of 1765, near- 
 ly all holders returned a considerable share of their 
 lands as "uncultivated," — it had become "worn out." 
 It was left to the introduction of a regular rotation, 
 combined with the use of artificial grasses, and the 
 application of lime and plaster to cause these "u'orn 
 out" fields to bear again upon their sunny slopes, 
 "the cattle of a thousand hills." These are brought 
 from New York State, Virginia, or the boundless 
 West, purchased in the Fall and kept upon corn fod- 
 der, oats straw, and hay, for about five months ot the 
 Winter season, turned to pasture about the 1st of 5th 
 month, (May,) and sold the latter part of Summer 
 and early Fall. The grass season, therefore, com. 
 prises about seven months. Very highly cultivated 
 land may be able to feed a steer this length of time 
 upon one acre, but the average usually found requis- 
 ite, is double that amount. Previous to the recent 
 practice of supplying the Eastern cities with vast 
 droves of home-fed cattle from the vallies of the 
 Shenandoah, Sciota, and other sections of the teem- 
 ing West, and when land did not command the price 
 it now does, grazing was profitable to the farmer of 
 Chester county. But if this is the main object, rath- 
 er than exemption from the labor attendant upon the 
 pursuit of other branches, it will be necessary for 
 them to turn their attention more to the production 
 of articles adapted to the retail market of the great 
 and growing city, the vicinity of which, creating a 
 demand for such, has enhanced the value of their 
 lands.
