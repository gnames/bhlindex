trees, and in such instances would cut them out — - 
 paring down to the sound wood, covering the wound 
 with some wax or cow dung, but in every such in- 
 stance, the tumors would reappear, and generally 
 destroy the trees. 

Some medical gentleman recommends the applica- 
 tion of Quassia, after cutting out the tumor, but nev- 
 er having made the application myself, can not say 
 if it will effect a cure. A friend tells me that he has 
 frequently applied common table salt to the wound 
 made by the knife, and with complete success, this 
 destroys the virus, without detriment to the health 
 of the tree. 

So far as the common Morcllo is concerned, the 
 loss need not bo regretted, as the English and Plum- 
 stone varieties, are greatly superior to it, both in 
 size and quality. On many of the finer kinds of 
 plums a remedy would be very desirable. Cutt- 
 ing off the diseased twigs will arrest it, and if con- 
 tinued from year to year may ultimately banish, yet 
 to cut off a vigorous branch with dozens of fine plums 
 on it, is, I fear, seldom attempted. 

I should be pleased to hear the opinion of others on 
 this subject, through the "Farm Journal," as many 
 of your correspondents have a better knowledge of 
 Pomology and Inscct-ology than the writer of tliese 
 crude remarks. 

What says J. K. B.? — Are the knots on plum and 
 cherry trees the cause or effect of insects ? Or is it a 
 disease somewhat an,alogous to the yellows of the peaclr 
 tree? J. B. G.

 Chicory. 

Messrs. Editors: — 

I notice in this month's number, 
 your remark that Chicory,[Chicorium Intyhus,)\a con- 
 sidered in your neighborhood a no.\:ious weed, and 
 also that in the form of Chicory coffee,Lt will not sup- 
 ply a good cup of Java, &o. 

The Chicory in its native habit is, as every other 
 of the most useful plants with which we are ac- 
 quainted, a xoeed. Those plants that are the most 
 economical and yield us food, covering, occupation 
 and profit, are all, in their wild state, weeds 1 

The Sut/ar Cane is a weed in the East Indies and 
 Africa, although it forms the staple and riches of sev" 
 eral very extensive countries. The Potato is a weed 
 on the hill sides of Chili and Peru, still now, at pres- 
 ent, could We or the nations of Europe do without it? 
 The Beet is a weed on the shores of several coun. 
 tries in the Mediterranean, and what important part 
 does it not make in agricultural eoonomy? The Mad- 
 der is a weed found on the road-sides of the south of 
 France, and still it constitutes one of the staples of 
 French agricultural industry.. We have a weed 
 growing common enough in nearly all the Middle and 
 Northern States, the large Thistle, and still no better 

or more palatable food can be found, for the mule or 
 the ass. The Mullen, which grows abundantly wild 
 every where, and is neglected here, is sedulously cul- 
 tivated in France and Germany, as a valuable medi- 
 cinal. Plant Pigweed or Piiuline, is likewise cultiva- 
 ted in Europe as a delicate and very wholesome 
 kitchen vegetable over great part of Europe. 

What is Timothy, Herd's Grass, Blue Grass, but 
 individually and originally weeds— and what part do 
 they play in our agricultural economy ? Indian 
 Corn, Wheat, Barley, Oafs, Rye, Flax, Hemp, Gotten, 
 and in fact, all useful plants, are, in their native hab- 
 its, weeds, and some of them noxious weeds, but cul- 
 tivation h.as adapted them to our urgent warns, and 
 brought them to that perfection, that t' eir utility 
 constitutes the basis of our existence, as individuals 
 as well as nations. 

With regard to the humble noxious weed, Chicory, 
 I recommend it for its utility and worth, as set forth 
 in the short paragraph in the July number. Manu- 
 factured in Chicory coffee, it is not intended to super- 
 cede coffee, but experience has prooed that mixed 
 with it, it is likewise useful and beneficial.

 Kuote on Plum Trees. 

Farm Lawn, 25th of 7th month, 1853. 

Messrs. Editors: 

The inquiry has been started, -in 
 your June number, relative to the cause producing 
 the excrescences on the young branches of the plum 
 and cherry trees. They have been generally ascrib- 
 ed to the ovipunoture of the insect whose larvce are so 
 frequently found nidifying in them. And from the 
 tacit adoption of this time-honored opinion, both by 
 the commonalty and savans, it may be deemed rash 
 and presumptuous to express a doubt of its correct- 
 ness;— and he who is bold enough to do so, may ex- 
 pect either to be denounced as a dangerous innovator, 
 or consigned to silent contempt for his heterodoxy. 
 On reflection, however,— .and 1 may add— after care- 
 ful examination, there seems to be room for further 
 inquiry, before the question can be considered satis- 
 factorily determined. The so frequent occurrence of 
 lar.vae in the knots, may have led to a hasty conclu- 
 sion—while the apparent antilogy of the Oak-gall, 
 and a host of allied productions, which do arise from 
 insect ovipuncture, has gone very far to confirm it in 
 the public mind. But it would be conceding too 
 much to admitthat the larvae found in diseased veget- 
 able growths, do, always, by the aid of a morbid vi- 
 tiil developement of the plant, build up for them- 
 selves the structures in which they nidify. 

The excrescences when mature become covered 
 with a small Futigus, (or perhaps more correctly 
 speaking, with tlio fructijication of a Fungus,) the
