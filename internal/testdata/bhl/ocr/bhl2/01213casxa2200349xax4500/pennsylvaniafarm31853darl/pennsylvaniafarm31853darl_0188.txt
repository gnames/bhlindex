SphiBria morbosa, Schw. This Spa; iria is perhaps 
 more constant on the surface than the larva in the sub- 
 stance of the excrescences. Would it not, therefore, 
 be quite as rational to conclude that they were caus- 
 ed by the Fungus, as by the Insect? Possibly the 
 discovery is yet to be mado,that the excrescence itself 
 is the true Sphceria morbosa, and the little granules 
 seen upon its surface, the fructification. This vrould 
 be in accordance with what is known of many spe- 
 cies of Sphoeria.and other Fungi. The mycologist can 
 readily refer to numerous parallel cases — I will mere- 
 ly mention a few, for the benefit of more general 
 readers, which fall within the cognizance of common 

observation. 

The well known knots on our hedging thorn (Cra- 

tae^-us cordata — Ait:) commence very much in the 
 same manner as those on the plum and cherry trees, 
 but that they more speedily develope the fructifica- 
 tion of a most beautiful Fungus— the Roestelia cylin- 
 drioa — Lk. In the latter case, however, the fructi- 
 fication springs directly from the interior oi the tu- 
 mour, and before it has suffered from insect depreda- 

tion, thus exhibiting, much more satisfactorily, the 
 true nature of the morbid structure. 

The apples so common at this season of the year 
 on cedar trees, [Juniperus Virginiana — Lin.) will 
 next year develop the fruit of the singular and ele- 
 gant Fungus — the Podisoma macropus — iSc/iiO. The 
 same remarks will apply to the extensive excrescen- 
 ces often seen upon the branches of the same tree, 
 and which produce Gymnosporangium Juniperinum 
 —Lk. 

The Ergot of the common Rye, (Secale cereale— 
 Lin) and other graminaceous seeds, when mature, 
 produces upon its surface a very diminutive fructify- 
 ing Fungus — the Ergotoetia abortifacens — Queck. 

In all instances here given, and hundreds more 
 could be cited, it is probable that the tumid mass is 
 the proper Fungus plant, producing its fruit, in due 
 season after its kind — and I have yet to learn that 
 the plum and cherry excresences are not consimilar. 

If there is wisdom in the foregoing remarks, a hint 
 to the wise will be sufficient, — and if they are alto- 
 gether chimerical I have written Quantum Sufficil 

Apples. 

Early Harvest. 

Pig. 1. Prince's Harvest, Yellow Harvest, July 
 Pippin. — For an early apple this stands deservedly 
 at the head of the list, and should be cultivated by 
 every fruit groweri It is very productive, of a rich, 
 sub acid flavor, of fair size and answers well either 
 for cooking or as a handsome desert fruit. It com' 
 mences ripening early part of July, and continues 
 in use through that month, and the early part of Au- 
 gust. Coming into market thus early in the season, 
 and with its attractive appearance, a bright stra* 
 color when fully rip3, it is one of the most profib- 
 able varieties for the market. Size medium, some- 
 what oblate, roundish, smooth. Stalk | of an inch 
 ong, rather slender; caljrx moderate sunk; flesh wh ite 

tender, juicy, with a rich, sub acid flavor, shoots 
 erect, somewhat diverging, often forked. 

Fig. 2. Red Astrachan.— This is one of the most 
 beautiful apples known, is of Russian origin, ripen- 
 ing a few days after the Prince's Harvest, not quite 
 equal to it in flavor, but a variety that will always 
 sell, from its beautiful deep crimson appearance, with 
 a bloom like a plum. It is also very productive, a 
 regular bearer, and is a superior cooking apple. 
 The tree is a vigorous grower, with broad leaves; 
 fruit large, roundish, nearly covered with deep crim-' 
 son; stalk rather short, deeply inserted; calyx set in 
 a slight irregular basin; flesh white, rather orispi 
 juicy >
