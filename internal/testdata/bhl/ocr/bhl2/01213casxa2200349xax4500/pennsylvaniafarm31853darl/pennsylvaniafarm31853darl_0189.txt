Fig, 3. Blood Good. — This pear was brought into 
 notice by James Bloodgood, nurseryman, of Long 
 Island, in 1835, who received it from a person un- 
 known, and its history he has never been able to 
 trace. It is probably a chance seedling. We can say 
 of it We never Want any thing better. It is of the 
 very highest quality) and where only a few varieties 
 are cultivated, this unhesitatingly should be one of 
 them. Size medium, turbinate, inclining to obovate, 
 thickening very abruptly into the stalk; skin yellow, 
 with russet dots, having a russety appearance on one 
 side; calyx scarcely sunk; flesh yellowish white, but- 
 tery and melting, with a rich sugary, highly aromat- 

Fig. 4. Madeleine. 

Fig. 1. Madelbike. — Rather smaller than the pre-' 
 ceding and ripens earlier, about wheat harvest; prob- 
 ably the best pear of its time of ripening. It is of 
 French origin, and derives its name from being in 
 parfection at the feast of St. Madeleine, in France. 
 We consider it of the first quality. Size medium, 
 obvate; skin smooth, pale yellowish green^ sometimes 
 with a faint brownish blush; stalk slender, one and a 
 half inches long, set in a narrow cavity; calyx small) 
 in a very shallow basin; flesh white, juicy, melting, 
 with a delicate somewh.at perfumed flavor. It ripens 
 early, both on pear and quince.
