Prejudices of Farmers. 

Extracts from an address delivered before the New 
 Hampshire Agricultural Society, by William S. King, 

Esq. ' 

But to come to the Second prejudice of farmers. 

As a class they say, that espcciW- Education is not 
 necessary for them; — an education, adapted to their 
 occupation as formers, to teach them more than tliey 
 now know, of their own business; thereby enabling 
 them to improve upon the doings of their predecess- 
 ors, as other classes of men have done; — an Agbi- 
 cuLTURAL Education, loooking directly at their in- 
 tended business for life. 

The Sliipwright, before' he is able to launch upon 
 the deep, those models of marine arcbitecture,whieh, 
 whether propelled by sails or steam, have alike car- 
 ried our starry flag in triumph on the sea, has, in his 
 youth, been apprenticed to a finished master of his 
 craft; he has, so to speak, studied the alphabet of his 
 trade under a competent teaohor; and he has pored, 
 dreary hours long, over models, and lines, and rules 
 laid down in books. No one of my hearers supposes, 
 that the improvements made in ship-building, where- 
 by, even before the introduction of steam on the 
 ocean, we had already diminished the distance to the 
 English coast from our own, by full one-half in tWen- 1 
 ty years, are the result of accident, or of fortunate 
 guesswork. No! constant study alone enabled the 
 builders to improve upon every model that was 
 launched; until now, the work of our ship-yards is 
 the admiration of the world. It may be here added, 
 as an argument for education, that the conceded su- 
 periority of our ship-wrights even over those of our 
 mother country,- — Noble Old England, — is universal- 
 ly and unhesitatingly attributed to the fact, that our 
 ship-builders are more generally men of inquiring 
 minds and of education in their business. 

The Mason who rears your house walls, and spans 
 the swift stream with the striding arch, has had his 
 years of apprenticeship and education. Much of his 
 knowledge must come from books, but he does not 
 therefore despise it. 

The Painter, who sketches with magic pencil, the 
 glowing landscape, or "the human form divine," has 
 prepared himself to execute those masterly touches, 
 by previous care and study. 

The Lawyer is educatjed with, a steady view to his 
 future profession. 

The Physician acquires from books, and from ol> 
 servation, the knowledge of the healing art; that ren- 
 ders him a minister of mercy in our dwellings. 

The Divine, whose errand is to warn tfie sinner to 
 "flee from the \VTath to come," and to comfort the 
 parting soul, about to wing its way on a dim and 
 untried journey, learns to undertsand and to expound 
 the will of his Heavenly Master, by continued peru- 
 sal of the writings of the good and learned. 

All professions, all trades, all other occupations of 
 men testify to the advantages of especial education; 
 but tho farmer is yet unconvinced. Men are not born 
 with a natural knowledge of law, or of mechanics; 
 so that after a little obsiirvation of the practice, they 
 can take high rank in their respective occupations; 
 but the farmer claims that he has, froBi youth; all the 
 knowledge of his business that is necessary; and .a 
 few years of practice completes the education It 
 we allow that we merely desire to equal those who 
 have preceded us, it may bo that we can keep close 
 to them, by walking in their footsteps; but the ten- 
 dency of the age is to improvement; —the design of 
 our Maker appears to be, that each generation oi' 
 man should excel, in knowledge, its predecessor; — 

but it is idle to ej>pcct improvement, where all are con- 
 tent to be imitator's. 

The object of an agricultural education is, un- 
 doubtedly, to make practical farmers; and here, at 
 the outset, we stumble over a prejudice, as to what 
 constitutes a 7Jrarftca?/ar-nier. 

My purpose here, as all know, is not, — cannot be, . 
 — to ridicule my hearers. I have a too high re- 
 spect for those who called me hither, — for those who 
 now so kindly listen to me,— for the great subject 
 that we are discussing, — for my own charaoter,^to 
 attempt to throw riilicule upon any whom I address. 
 But you, yourselves, shall be judges of what your- 
 selves declare to be a Practicat. Farmer. 

To decide whether a stranger, who calls himself a 
 fiirmer,has a right to" tho title, is not your first glance 
 cast upon his clothes, to see if they be farmer-like; 
 and your next upon his hands, to find they are har- 
 dened by manual lal)or. If a man, in a black broad- 
 cloth dress coat, having hands fair to look upon, and 
 uncallo.used by contact with the plow handle, pre- 
 sents himself to your notice, as a practical farmer, 
 your politeness may or may not prevent you from 
 "laughing in his face, at the obvious absurdity of the 
 claim; Imt you laugh none the less, in your sleeve, as 
 you set bim down for a fancy farmer. 

Now, sirs, what right have you to deride this man's 
 pretensions; and, otf-hand, to pronounce that ho is 
 not a farmer, as accomplished as yourself, or even 
 able to teach you wha,t you have not yet learned, in 
 your own ocupation ? It is because you consider 
 that a practical farmer, is he, and he only, who la- 
 bors with his hands; this would make them tough; 
 and the necessities of his occupation would compel 
 him to wear more homely anparel. Is it true, that 
 this it is, and this oXouq,— labor with the hands, — 
 HARD WORK, — that makes the practical man ? Then 
 is your hired help; who follows the plow, day in and 
 day out; who shivers in the wintry stable, and 
 sweats at the harvest, many an hour when you are 
 occupied about other affairs, a better practical far- 
 mer than you; for he often works more. Then is the 
 ox, that he drives, the most practical, for he wears 
 rougher and .tougher garments, has harder hands, 
 and does more hard work than either of you. 

Farmers ! you greatly mistake the meaning of the 
 word practical. Stand with me upon the- quarter 
 deck of a ship, as she strips for a battle with the 
 storm. The bullying winds roar. The threatening 
 sky descends and contracts. The angry waves lift 
 up their heads. The tempest-tost bark, now piercing 
 the sky with her trembling masts, now driving head- 
 long into the yawning trough of the sea, is freighted 
 with human sijuIs. Do they not now, if ever, need 
 the services of a practical snilov to conduct them safe- 
 ly through the environing perils ? Who then is he, 
 to whom all eyes instinptively turn, as under God, 
 their only hope ? Is it that stalwart son of the sea, 
 whose strength is the boast of the ship's company; — 
 who .can "swim farther, dive deeper, and come up 
 drier, than any man in the crowd;" — who can "hand, 
 and reef, and steer;"^who can mount the rigging; 
 with a squirrel's agility, and tie all the fast-knots, 
 and sliding knots, that are the sailor's pride; and 
 splice, or "lay a cable, with the next man;" — is this 
 he, who is selected as the best practical sailor, to 
 command the craft, in her hour of danger? Far 
 from it, friends. The practical man, for the occasiim, 
 is yiui dapper little fellow, with soft, white palms; 
 sporting, mayhap, a seal ring: and dressed, as if in- 
 clined to give to tar and pitch, and all other defiling 
 substances, a wide berth. He it is;— this man, wlio 
 has been educated for his position, and who directs
