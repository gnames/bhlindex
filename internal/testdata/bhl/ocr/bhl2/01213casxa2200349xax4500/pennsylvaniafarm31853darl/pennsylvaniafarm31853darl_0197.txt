forgetful that an ounce of prevention is wortli a 
 pound of cure. Tliis subject of drainage opens too 
 vast a iield for me to venture upon at this time. 

This same rule of prevention causes your scientific 
 farmer to do all thiiiys in season. He stirs up the 
 earth between the drills of his crops, with the hoe or 
 cultivator, to kill tlie weeds, before they attain to 
 great size, and strength, and appetite. There is no 
 such glutton as your weed. Like a sharper among 
 honest folks, it defrauds the legitimate owner of what 
 rightfully belongs to him. With coolest impudence 
 it steals from I he young and tender plant three-fourths 
 of its food, and grows in consequence three inches to 
 its one; Mr. Weed over-tops it; he bullies it, as it 
 were after reducing its strength by starvation. By 
 and by, he claims the ground as his own, and flour- 
 ishes in undisturbed possession. He becomes seedy 
 at length; establishes a large family, in good quar- 
 ters to rob succeeding crops of potatoes and carrots; 
 and is only uprooted and punished when he has 
 about run the length of his evil course. 

Agriculture is understood to express, not merely 
 the cultivation of the land, but also all the opera- 
 tions incidental to it, or consequential upon it. Ac- 
 cordingly, we find science in the Stock-yard. The 
 enlightened system, that prevails in the field, is in- 
 troduced here. Acting upon the well-established 
 rule that "like begets like," she selects fit moulds, 
 and builds up breeds of cattle for the shambles, 
 square and ponderous, like the lordly Durhams; and 
 again for the yoke she prepares the beautiful and 
 agile Devon; for the milk-pail she reserves families 
 of each of these breeds, in which big udders and 
 profuse secretions of milk are hereditary! For the 
 churn she shows the gentle Jersey cow; seven quarts 
 of whose milk will yield a pound of butter. 

Among Swine, this same wise system, — a synoyma 
 for science — has produced the Suffolk, the Middle- 
 sex, and other breeds, that run to fat, as naturally as 
 a turtle-fed Alderman:^they eat, they grunt, they 
 sleep their lives away, until they have attained to a 
 very Lambertism of obesity: and then, with a gurg- 
 ling in the throat they change into pork and are laid 
 down in the barrel. 

For the Farm Journal. 
 Poppy. 

Messrs Editors: — 

A short paragi'aph in the July 
 number of the Pennsylvania Farm Journal on Poppy 
 Oil, induces me to write these few lines, the result 
 of my experience and knowledge. 

The Poppy, Papamr somnifermu Oi7?eWe,(French,) 
 is very extensively cultivated on the continent of 
 Europe, particulai-ly in Flanders, France, parts of 
 Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, &c., for its 
 seeds, which produee a most excellent oil by'ex- 
 pression, equal to that of Olives for eating, as well as 
 for mixing with paints. 

Two varieties are grown, viz: the white, P. S. al- 
 bum, which produces the best oil, and the purple, 
 which produce the greatest quantity from the same 
 quantity of seeds expressed. Both plants are easily 
 distinguished by the color of their corolla, as the 
 names imply. 

The soil best adapted for the Poppy is a light rich 
 loam, properly manured and prepared by good plow- 

ing in the Fall, light cross plowing, and well harrow- I 

ing in the Spring, and the seed then sown, March to 
 June, at the rate of two ounces per acre, in shallow 
 drills or rows very thin, the drills Ij fo 2 feet apart; 
 the seed rolled on land that does not bake; where it 
 does bake, it can be kept light by strewing over the 
 drills clean chaff or salt hay, where procurable, as 
 this will keep the ground moist and favorable to ger* 
 mination. 

As soon as the plants are 4 or 5 inches high, they 
 should be thinned to one foot distance in therows.and 
 slightly earthed up, and kept clean through the seas- 
 on, either by a small plow or cultivator. 

In July or August the seeds will ripen, which is 
 known by the heads turning dark and dry, and they 
 can be harvested by sending boys into the rows each 
 with a basket, into which every head is shaken with- ^ 
 out breaking the stems; the ripe seeds being all loose ' ■ 
 will drop out through openings in the poppy heads, 
 the unripe seeds will still adhere to' the head and can 
 bo shaken out a few days after the first gathering. ] 
 Should this appear too tedious work, the harvesting 
 can be done by pulling up the stalks and putting 
 them upright in bundles in the field; when they are 
 quite dry, they can be shaken by handfuls over an 
 empty barrel, or beaten on a shefet. 

The produce in favorable circumstances, when ev- 
 ry thing has been carried on with care and attention, 
 will amount to twenty to twenty -five bushels of seed, 
 which, on expression will yield about two and a half 
 gallons of oil per bushel, and leave about forty 
 pounds of residuum or cake, making amost excellent - 
 manure. ^ 

The Opium of commerce is made from the white 
 Poppy, P. S. album, this being very extensively ' 
 cultivated for that purpose, in Egypt, Turkey, Per- 
 sia, India and China. 

, The manipulation of the Opium being a delicate 
 and tedious process, requiring a large number of 
 small hands, vvomen and children, will prevent its be- 
 ing generally put in practice in the United States, on 
 account of the dearness and scarcity of labor. 

Those who have at times made the trial, on a small 
 scale, have obtained an Opium of very good quality. 
 The Poppy heads used by Druggists can' be raised 
 by sowing the seeds in gardens. 

The seeds can bo procured of me at 15 cents per 
 ounce, at D. Landreth's, S. Cth street, or Paschall 
 Morris & Co., 380 Market street, Philadelphia, at 
 either of which places I can be found. 

It will bo perceived by the above that this plant 
 cannot be raised ^ith tlie same profit;iblo results as 
 the Rape, of which the statement I gave in the July 
 number of the Pennsylvania Farm Journal, goe* in 
 evidence, besides which the Rape can be better raised 
 here. 

In. 1822 or 1823, there was an Englishman th Sa- 
 lem county, N. J., who sowed Rape seed on a two
