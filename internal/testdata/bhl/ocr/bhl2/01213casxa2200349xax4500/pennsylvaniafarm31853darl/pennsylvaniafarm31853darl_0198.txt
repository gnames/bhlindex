acre lot, broadcast, in order aftorwai-ds to thin it out 
 by the koe, as is practit-ed in England with rape and 
 turnips. During the Fall, his and his neighbor's 
 cows broke in the field, and de^ttoyed to all appear-' 
 ahoe all the plants, having eaten them apparently all 
 down. Next Spring in going to look about that field 
 he perceived that the greater proportion of the plants 
 had come up again, so determing to give the field a 
 chance, he repaired the fence round it thoroughly, 
 and h-.rvested that Summer, forty bushels, of the 
 seed, which |je got crushed into oil, and then obtain, 
 ed three gallons perbushel, or one hundred, and twen- 
 ty gallons, which he sold at |1 30 per gallon, at that 
 time, thus realizing §150 from the two acres, for the 
 ml alone, after the disaster that befel it.

fill with water and a half bushel of salt. This done 
 in the forenoon, toward evening the salt (frequently 
 stired) will be dissolved, when the wheat is poured 
 in, filling to six inches of the rim, as this will admit 
 of brine sufficient over the grain to supply the sink- 
 ing of the brine by absorption. Early next morn- 
 ing the brine is drawn off, the grain spread on the 
 floor, and pulverised lime (two or three pecks) spread 
 over and mixed with it. This absorbs the moisture, 
 and prevents the grains sticking together. 

As seed prepared thus swells considerable, there 
 is of course not so many grains in p> ^ortion to bulk, 
 and this makes it necessary in sowing the soaked 
 seed, to grasp larger handfuls than when sowing dry 
 seed, otherwise theseeding may be thinner than in- 
 cended. E.

 To Prevent Fly Su Wheat. 
 Messrs. Editors: — ■ " 

The wheat crop, in many parts 
 of our country having been more or less injured by 
 the fly, permit me through the medium of your use- 
 ful Journal, .to recommend brining the seed for the 
 ensuing crop. The benefit of this preparation has 
 lem aeoounted for by some on the hypothesis of the 
 insect egg being deposited in tlie grain, and conse- 
 quently destroyed by the soaking. Others assert the 
 egg is deposited in the shoot, and if this be the case, 
 the soaking of the seed can only deter the fly by the 
 earlier and more vigorous start of the plant. But 
 however operating, certain I am, from exjjerUnce, 
 that- this preparation of the seed, has the desired 
 effect. I gave this preparation of seed a trial many 
 years liack, when the fly had been very injurious for 
 three or four years in succession, and my crops es- 
 caped, while those around, although in every other 
 respect as carefully farmed and manured, were in- 
 jured exceedin'gly. And, in a recent conversation 
 with an old f;irmer from a distance, lie observed, the 
 wheat crop in his vicinity wa^ much' injured- and 
 straggled, but that his stood all erect, and had pro- 
 duced a full crop. This difference fie attributed en- 
 tirely to having thus prepared his seed, and added, 
 he had never known it f\iil to prevent the fly injuring 
 the wheat crop. 

Farmers disposed to try the esperiraent, will ac- 
 c^t the following hints. 

I proceeded thus: — Having bored an inch and a 
 Urilf auger hole on one side the bottom of an open 
 end hogshead, I placed it on tressels on the barn 
 floor, high enough to put buckets under to receive 
 the brine when drawn off. Then from below, drive 
 in a spile,' and place over its point in the hogshead, 
 su old tin cup, perforated with awl holes— then half

Agricultural Progress in Delaware. 

Mr. Editor: — 

I was much pleased to notice in a 
 late number of the Farm Journal, that you had re- 
 cently received some two or three hundred new sub- 
 scribers in t^is "little State" of ours. . Although, in 
 some portions of our territory may be seen a decided 
 improvement in the appearance and management of 
 our farms, yet I would ask no better evidence of our 
 progress in agriculture than the simple announce- 
 ment that your valuable "Journal" has become a reg- 
 ular visitant to some three hundred farm houses in 
 our Commonwealth.* Every good farmer will read, 
 in fact, he nmst do so, to keep up with the improve- 
 ments of the age; and when the day shall arrive — I 
 hope it is not far distant — that every farmer in our 
 State will have a copy of the Farm Journal, and 
 will read its varied and valued contents with the de- 
 termination to profit thereby, we shall give a charac- 
 icr to our agriculture that would pass muster even 
 in your famous county of Chester. In truth, "Ches- 
 ter county farming," as the phrase goes here, is com- 
 ing quite into vogue among us — introduced by sett- 
 •lers from your county, who have been tempted to 
 cross, our boarders by the low price of our land com- 
 pared with yours. 

We are indebted to your county, also, for many of 
 our best implements, such as horse-rakes, corn-shellT 
 ers, wheat-drills, &c., &c., which are sent to us from 
 the inanufactories of the Messrs. Pennock, at Ken- 
 net Square. This enterprising firm have opened an 
 Agricultural Warehouse in Wilmington, which will 
 be the means of a more general introduction of su- 
 perior implements^ an improved system of farming 
 will soon follow, as a matter of course.

 Castle countv alone, which rather puts to the blush 
 some counties in Pennsylvania we could mention.
