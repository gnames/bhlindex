Peruvian guano contains only forty-one per cent, 
 really valuable salts, the resfis animal matter, water, 
 magnesia and lime. Magnesia and lime we can ap- 
 ply to our land abundantly with a trifling expense. 
 Our lime contains 30 per cent, of magnesia; therefor 
 for those 41 lbs. of really valuably salts we have to 
 pay $3 oO.and thou run the risk to receive an inferi- 
 or article, the Chilian guano, which only contains 20 
 per cent, really valuable .salts. 

The chemist has unveiled much of the mystery ot. 
 vegetation: the farmer ought to profit by it; it enables 
 him to prepare his fertilisers, and not buy those nos- 
 trums when much of their component parts may be' 
 worthless. 

30 lbs. of bone dust, at one cent per lb., 30 

30 lbs. of of plaster, at half cent per lb., 15 

30 lbs. of nitrate of soda, at three cents per lb., 90 

10 lbs., carbonate of amonia,at 18 cents per lb., 1 SQ 

$i 15 
 (The plaster will fix the carbonate of amonia.) 
 Such a mixture, I believe, would be worth 150 lbs. 
 of guano. We may not receive so much amonia but 
 far more nitrate, and more phosphate, so necessary 
 to our soil, and be sure to have a pure and unadul- 
 terated article. 

I also take the liberty to direct your attention to 
 induce the Philadelphia salt merchants to import 
 some rook salt, or salt in blocks. I give salt in that 
 state to my cattle. It is so convenient to have a lump 
 in the trough; the cattle can lick it when they feel an 
 appetite for salt. But it is too high in price'; I have 
 to pay SI 50 per 100 lbs., in Philadelphia.and scarce 
 to be got. I think it could be imported for half that 
 price. It would then become in general use among 
 farniers.

Having much to our regret, missed seeing the fine 
 animals alluded to below, which recently arrived in 
 Philaielphia, per ship Crown, we are much obliged 
 to our friend, Aaron Clement, himself one of the best 
 of judges, for his description and communication.

 Importation of 'Short Horn Cattle, Sheep, &c. 

To THE Editors of the Farm Journal: — • 

I have 
 been unable hitherto to give an explicit account of 
 the recent importation of live stock from England,for 
 Kentucky, which has excited some interest in the 
 agricultural prosperity and improvement of this 
 country. The Western people seem as much in ad- 
 vance of us in agricultural enterprise, as we claim to 
 be in advance of them in commerce and manufac- 
 tures. 

This valuable part of the cargo of the ship Crown, 
 from Liverpool, estimited in the Mark Lane Ex- 
 press, of London, at £5000 previous to shipping; con- 

sisting of 49 head of cattle, 31 sheep, a horse of the 
 Cleveland Bay stock, and some Suffolk pigs, is the 
 property of R. Atchinson Alexander, Esq., of Scot- 
 land,(who has a large estate in Kentucky,) and some 
 Kentuckians, associated fbr the purpose of importing 
 a number of fine animals to cross with their own 
 stock. 

A sight of the animals showed at once the care 
 and judgment exercised in their selection, and the 
 condition in which they landed, proves that no care 
 or attention had been wanting on the part of the 
 ;^hippers to insure their safe arrival in this country. 
 ■It was remarked by many persons, that though a. 
 little stiff, they had more the appearance of animals 
 coming from fine pasture, than from a long voyage. 

It was much regretted that Mr. Garrand, the agent 
 of the Kentucky importing company, \yas necessa- 
 rily in such 'haste to get this stock home, as pre- 
 vented many amateurs from getting a fair sight of 
 them. Several of the young bulls excited great ad- 
 miration. One. bought of Lord Feversham, and oth 
 era of Messrs. Ambler, Fawkes, and Hopper, attract- 
 ed most particular attention, and were' greatly ad- 
 mired, as well as some splendid heifers, from the 
 herds of Messrs. Booth, Ambler and Townly. 

The horse was much esteemed for his fine points, 
 and beautiful action. And the sheep may be regard- 
 ed as the best that could be selected from the most 
 reputed flocks in England. 

Mr. Alexander having allowed his stock to remain 
 here some days longer, I have had a better opportu- 
 nitp of examining them particularly. 

He has five young bulls; two of them are not in as 
 good condition as the others, but they show many 
 fine points in common with them. They are both 
 from the herd of Mr. Fawkes, whose stock was prin- 
 cipally derived from the herd of Mr. Whitaker, so 
 justly celebrated as a breeder of Short Horn stock. 
 The other three bulls are in fine condition, consider- 
 ing their recent voyage, and are remarkably fine an- 
 imals. My favorite, is "2d Duke of Athol," two 
 years old next September, descended from Mr. Bates. 
 Dutchess 54th, by Mr. Booth's Lord George, a bull 
 of the highest reputation; he is large for his age, of 
 a red roan color, with fine head, deep brisket, round 
 and deep' in the ribs, straight on the back, with quar- 
 ters properly full and ample. Indeed, from what» 
 ever point he is viewed, it would seem difficult to find 
 a defect. His horns, which are strong, might be 
 thought too much so, by the admirers of small and 
 delicate horns, but there can be little doubt of the 
 trjith of the opinion held by most of tiie breeders of 
 Enghuid, that a strong horn denotes, strength of con- 
 stitution, and in the case of this bull, th'e horns are 
 not so large as to be objectionable. To his symmetri- 
 cal shape, ho adds the quality of being a first-rate 
 handler, a point frequently too little attended to in 
 this country.
