Lord John, somewhat older than' 2d Duke of Ath- 
 ol, may also be considered a very fine animal. He 
 is a pretty roan, of fine size and shape, and had I 
 not seen the other bull first, I should have been quite 
 satisfied with him, as he combines almost all the 
 points required in a bull, and some think him equal 
 to the other. ^ 

The remaining young bull, is called Fantiohina, 
 bred by Mr. Fawkes, he is just a year old, and 
 would generally be considered a rod and white in 
 color, but upira examination, he approaches a roan; 
 he has a finished shoulder and brisket, straight back,' 
 good barrel, fine liips, deep in the flank, and fine in 
 the head and neck. 

Mr. Alexander's lot of nineteen cows and heifers, 
 with one or two exceptions, may be said to be very 
 fine. I shall describe three or four favorites. The 
 two cows which pleased me most were a red and 
 white, from Mr. Wiley, of Brandsly, Yorkshire, bred 
 from stock obtained from Messrs. Mason and Colling 
 and a roan from Mr. R. Bell. Morbro' Hall, Lancas- 
 hire, bred by him from Bates' stock, now the favorite 
 in England. It is, somewhat difficult to choose the 
 finest heifer, as this depends on the taste of the. 
 chooser, — but I think most good judges would per- 
 haps prefer a red heifer, one year old, coming also, 
 I am informed, from Mr. Bolden's herd, combining 
 the blood of the old rival breeders. Bates and Booth. 
 It is difficult to find a fault in her shape, and in some 
 points she excels any heifer I have seerij more es- 
 pecially about the flank and quarter. After her I 
 should place the heifers from the herd of Mr. Tan- 
 query, ne.ar London ; one, a two year old past, the 
 other a little under two. These heifers are fine speci- 
 mens of two different styles of animals. Minerva 
 3d, the older of the two, being finer in her bone, and 
 her proportions than Joyful, who is larger, with 
 more appearance of flesh, — each, hovvever, is a pic- 
 ture such as a breeder of fine stock niust admire. I 
 have not time to go further into detail, but will con- 
 tent myself with saying, that the introduction of so 
 many line animals into this country must prove high- 
 ly advantageous to the community in general, as well 
 as to the breeders of Kentucky, and I hope the gentle- 
 man importing them, may be as successful in getting 
 them to their destination as they have been in select- 
 ting them, and getting them across the Atlantic.

Clean Seed. 
 Mr. Editor: — 

As seeding time is at hand, I would 
 call the attention of farmers to the importance of 
 sowing cl:an seed. There are still a few who believe 
 that wheat degenerates into "cheat." A writer in 
 the New York Tribune,in describing t^e crops of last 

season in lUinois.said that some of their wheat turned 
 into cheat, in consequence of being sown on flat land, 
 and the hard Winter. The farm on which 1 live, 
 was full of cheat when it came into my possession. 
 I have been very careful never to sow any thing but 
 wheat, and the result is, I never reap any thing but 
 wheat in harvest time. Formerly I waj accustomed 
 to get about one-half cheat in my Fall crops, but 
 since I have cleaned ray seed wheat carefully, I get 
 no cheat in the worst kind of crops.

Pennsylvania State Fair. 

Our readers in all sections of the State, will bear 
 in mind, ihat before another issue of our paper, the 
 third Annual Exhibition of the State Society will 
 have passed by. It occurs at Pittsburg on the 27th, 
 28th,29th and 30th of September. Premium lists and 
 arrangements for the exhibition, will be found in our 
 two last numbers. We hope and expect it will sur- 
 pass both of the preceding ones. The main reliance 
 of course, must be on our friends west of the moun- 
 tains, but if the accommodations on the transporta- 
 tion lines are satisfactory, and not otherwise, there 
 will doubtless be also a representation from this sec- 
 tion o& the State, which now contains some of as 
 good stock, as is to be found in the Union. We re- 
 gret, that previous, to our Journal going to press, we 
 should have received no information about provision 
 for articles going to the fair, or price of excursion 
 tickets for passengers. We presume every thing of 
 this kind will be duly attended to. In New York, 
 the managers of their approaching fair at Saratoga, 
 have obtained from the proprietors of all their pub- 
 lic houses, the prices to be charged by them respect- 
 ively, for accommodation during the fair. This en- 
 ables visitors beforehand to determine the probable 
 cost of expenses, and avoids danger of imposition. 
 It is a good move. 

Chester County Agricultural Exhibition. 

The first exhibition of the above society, now fully 
 organised, afler "a suspended animation" of several 
 years, will be held at West Chester, on the 16th and 
 17th of September. Arrangements are in progress, 
 (a suitable lot within the borough limits having been 
 secured,) to afford every accommodation to exhibit- 
 ors of stock, implements, and farm produce. A 
 ploughing match will also be held near the show 
 grounds, to which ploughmen and manufacturers are 
 invited. The general feeling through the county is, 
 that there must be no mistake this time, and if our 
 friends in adjoining counties, wish to see some of the 
 very best cattle, sheep, hogs, and poultry in the coun- 
 try, which have been bred and raised by our Chester 
 county farmers, we hope they will favor us with their 
 company on the occasion. Dr. Emerson, of Phila-
