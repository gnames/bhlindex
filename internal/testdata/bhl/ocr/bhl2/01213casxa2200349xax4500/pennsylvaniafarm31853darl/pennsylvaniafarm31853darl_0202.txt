STRAWBERRY— LIME BURNING, &c. 

[September 

delphia, has coiiscn/ed to deliver the address, which 
 we are confident will attract an attentive auditory. 
 The Horticultural Exhibition will be held at the 
 sanae time, in the large hall of the society. 

McAvoy's Superior Strawberry. 

Through the kindness of our friend Dr. Brinckle, 
 we are enabled to present the above engraving from 
 a-.i original drawing of this celebrated variety. It 
 received the premium of $100 offered by'the Cinciu- 
 natti Horticultural society, and was pronounced by 
 them, after two seasons trial, as superior to Ilovey's 
 Seedling, and any other variety that came under ex- 
 amination of the commmittee. Its usual- sexual 
 character is pistillate. Fruit very large, roundish 
 ovate, occasionally slightly necked, deep brilliant 
 crimson; seed crimson, sometimes yellow, set in in- 
 dentations, not deep, except in the largest specimens; 
 flesh red; flavor exquisitely fine; quality "best." 

So far as tried in this latitude, it sustains its high 
 character, and will be sought after for general culti- 
 vation, being a very prolific bearer. Dr. Brinckle 
 (and there is no higher authority,) writes us, "taking 
 all its qualities into consideration, it is probably the 
 most valuable strawberry we have." 

William Parry, a practical strawberry grower of 
 New Jersey, and who cultivates many varieties, also 
 states in our last number, that "McAvoy's Superior 
 yielded a larger crop of large sized berries than any 
 other." 

It is surprising.that in the vicinity of Philadelphia, 
 where the demand for strawberries is very great, and 
 yearly increasing, so little attention is paid by farm- 
 ers to their culture. With the exception of a few 
 gardeners neat the city, the supply is nearly alto- 
 gether derived from New Jersey. It is stated in 
 our last number that one farmer, in Burlington coun- 
 ty, sold over |1100 from less than three acres. Com- 
 pare this with the profits of the ordinary course of 
 farming, as detailed by our correspondent C. B., in 
 the numbers of his Agricultural Review, and as we 
 have often before urged, it will be found high time 
 for farmers iu Pennsylvania to look about them, and 

adapt their business to the changes induced by the 
 great increase of population in our large cities, and 
 the facilities of travel and transportation offered yy 
 our numerous railroads. Not only strawberry, but 
 fruit culture generally, will be found far more profit- 
 able over a largo section of Pennsylvania, than gra- 
 zing or grain growing. In Cincinnatti, during the 
 •selling season, the sales of strawberries will average 
 three hundred bushels per day. A single cultivator 
 carried to market one hundred and twenty bushels 
 per day, for eight or nine successive days. We do 
 not know the price there, but in Philadelphia, fine 
 strawberries will command very readily, 15 to 18 and 
 20 cents per quart; at 15 cents it will reach nearly $5 
 per bushel. . 

What is true of strawberries is equally so of oth- 
 er fruit, fine apples, pears, plums, &c. There is an 
 absolute scarcity or shortness of supply to demand, 
 taking an alverage of one season, or of several seas- 
 ons. Occasionally there is a glut of wormy, inferior, 
 unwholesome fruit, but fine varieties, and fair, good 
 sized specimens, will always sell at amply remunera- 
 ting prices. The present season, there appears to 
 be a general failure of the apple crop in Pennsylva- 
 nia, and the supply must come from the Eastward. 
 This is said not to be our fruit year, a distinction 
 not recognized in I*ew York State, where fruit grow- 
 ing is made a part of the regular business of the 
 farm, and the orchard receives its proper attention, 
 like corn, wheat and potatoes. A disposition to over 
 bear one year, and the necessary exhaustion of the 
 soil in consequence, is counteracted by the applica- 
 tion of specific manures, and thinning of the fruit. 

The largest and most profitable orchard, probably 

in the country, that of Pell's, consisting of three 

hundred acres, up the North river, is thus managed, 

and there is nothing like any regular failure of the 

crop.

Improvement iu I<ime Burning. 

Greorge W. Fccring, Esq., of Lehigh county, in con- 
 nection with a couple of gentlemen of Northampton 
 county, have the patent for a new lime-kiln, of a 
 novel construction, which possesses such decided ad- 
 vantages over every other kind of kiln as to promise 
 an entire revolution in the lime-burning business. It 
 is thus described. The kiln is lined with tire-brick, 
 and is 31 feet high, with a hopper on top, capable of 
 holding a large quantity of stone, which keeps f\\Iling 
 down into the kiln as fast as lime is drawn out be- 
 low. It will burn, on an average, 300 bushels of 
 lime per day. Wood is used in burning, and three 
 or four pieces of ordinary hickory or oak wood will 
 last half an hour. Two cords of wood will burn be- 
 tween 200 and 300 bushels of the best lime. The 
 lime is drawn off every twelve hours. The kiln is 
 the invention of a Mr. Schroeder, of Rochester,- New 
 York. Joseph Yeager, in Lower Saueon township, 

has one in operation on his f\xrm [Philadelphia 

Dollar Newspaper. 

Jonathan Dorwart, of Lancaster city, has a hen of 
 the Cochin China variety, which, it is stated, has laid 
 140 eggs in as many days.
