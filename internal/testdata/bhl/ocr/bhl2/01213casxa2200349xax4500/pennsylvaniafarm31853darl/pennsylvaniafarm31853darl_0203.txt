Tloj;a County. 

The spirit of imf.i'ovement, now visible among the 
 farmers, in every section of the State, we observe, 
 has reached ' Tioga, one of the best of our border 
 counties, rich not only in soil, but in her coal, iron, 
 and raw materials for manufactures. A call is pub- 
 lished for a public meeting at Wellsborough, her 
 county seat, on the 5th of September, to form a "coun- 
 ty agricultural and mechanical society." We wish it 
 the best success.

The article in our last number, by our able corres- 
 pondent, G. B. Browne, on burning lime, and alter- 
 ing the construction of the kilh, to obviate the diffi- 
 culty found by builders, in the use of coal burnt 
 lime, has attracted some attention. We are author- 
 ised to state, he is prepared tb give such directions to 
 practical mechanics, as will enable them to construct 
 kilns on this improved principle. Address him at

BOOK NOTICES. 

Sliuer's Domestic Poultry Book, 

A work with the above title was lately issued from 
 the press, which, on examination, we find to embody 
 a very large amount of valuable information, and 
 history of all the known breeds of poultry, brought 
 down to the present time. It is illustrated with one 
 hundred engravings, also copious direciions as to 
 their rearing, feeding, management, diseases, best 

method of fattening, mode of caponizing,construction 
 of poultry houses, chicken coops, preservation of eggs 
 artificial incubation, &c. It is a most comprehensive 
 little work, and the design appears to have been to 
 bring before the public.in a cheap and portaI>le form, 
 all the information, and practical experience of the 
 best poultry breeders in our country. Numerous let- 
 ters from them, as well as extracts from standard 
 works, are interspersed through the work. The his- 
 tory of tTie different importations, into the United. 
 States, and the characteristics of each breed, will be 
 very opportune information at the present time. We 
 think it is just such a work as is wanted. To give 
 an idea of the importance of the subject, the preface 
 states, "the quantity of eggs consumed daily in the 
 city of New York, is not l^ss than 400 barrels, or 
 400,000 eggs. Some of the large hotels in that city 
 use about 200 dozen per day. In a year the enor- 
 mous number of 146,000,000 eggs are sold there 
 worth at least $2,000,000. The sales of poultry and 
 eggs amount to about $3,000,000. The value of 
 poultry in the whole country, according to the late 
 census, is $15,000,000. 

The price of the above work, in paper covers, is 
 only fifty cents. It may be sent through the mail, 
 and can no doubt be obtained at many of the agri- 
 cultural warehouses and book stores. J. W. Moore, 
 Philadelphia, is the publisher. 

Phelps' Bee Keeper's Chart. 

This is one of the series of Saxton's Rural Hand 
 Books, the indefatigable publisher of New York, is 
 in a cheap portable form, with paper cover, and can 
 readily be sent by mail, price 25 cents. It goes over 
 the whole subject, in a condensed practical form, and 
 is a cheap and useful treatise. 

LADIES' DEPARTMEiffT. 

For the Farm Journal. ' 
 Bemeut's Comitouud. 

I fully agree with my Westmoreland sister, Mr. 
 Editor, that the lady readers of the Farm Journal 
 are entitled to a page or two of its columns every 
 month, for the discussion of within-door matters, 
 which, in my opinion, are as fully important, and go 
 quite as far towards scouring domestic peace and hap- 
 piness, as your "improved systems of farming." 

Our interesting "lords," I rather imagine, would 
 find it a dull world to live in, unless we racked our 
 brains, and bodies too, to keep them in good humor 
 by a plentiful supply of "creature comforts." If then, 
 in tliis age of progress, anything new should turn 
 up that will mitigate our household troubles, or add 
 to our domestic comforts, why not lot us have them 
 in the columtis of our own Pennsylvania Farm Jour- 
 nal, Mr. Editor, that your lady readers, from the Del- 
 aware to the Allegheny, may be benefited and in- 
 structed
