Work for the Month. 
 Farm. — The three important operations, during 
 this month, are seeding wheat crop and securing corn 
 and potatoes. Thorough preparation of the ground, 
 by twice ploughing and freiiuent harrowings, to pro- 
 duce tine pulverization, and make even and smooth 
 work for the drill, are important matters, in addition 
 to the use of suitable manures, for obtaining a full 
 crop of wheat, no less than the successful growth of 
 grass seed, often here more important than the other. 
 To give an idea of what the wheat crop re(iuires,- we 
 give an analysis of the grain and straw organic and 
 inorganic constituents : 

Organic constituents of Wheat 

From the above it will appear, that manures rich 
 in nitrogenous matters are required, and in wlfieh 
 our ordinary barn-yard manure is particularly defi- 
 cient, the ammonia having either been dissipated by 
 exposure to tiir, or carried off by the liquid drainings 
 of the yard. It also explains why Guano, containing 
 a large percentage of ammonia has had better effect. 
 Of the mineral ingredients, potash and phosphoric 
 acid in the grain, and silica in the straw, constitute 
 a large proportion, and should be supplied to the 
 soil if deficient. From the 15th to the 20th of Sep- 
 tember IS considered the best period for sowing in 
 this section. Use none but clean seed, and refer to 
 article in present number about brining it previous- 
 ly, li B. orSp'ks to acre, if drilled in, isample. Corn 
 should be cut up at the ground and tied in shocks, at 
 the top, with a straw band, thereto remain tillveady 
 for husking. If shocks are too large, the fodder will 
 be injured by heat, &c. Topping corn in the field is 
 Highly injurious to the grain, in respect to weight 
 and quality, and should,be discarded by every far- 
 mer. 

In gathering potatoes, select for seed such varie- 
 ties as are wanted, as they can be more readily dis- 
 tinguished when fresh, and store them away by 
 themselves. Examine and clean out corn-cribs, gran- 
 aries, etc., and make them rat-proof before putting 
 in the new crop, Haul weeds and refuse stuff into 
 pig-pens, barn yard, and ctmipost heap. Sec that 
 the mouths of drains and ditches are kept open and 
 in order. Replenish the rock salt in field for cattle 
 and sheep. >lake arrangements to reconstruct the 
 farmnr'.s hiboratory, the barn yard, so as to save 
 liquid from running away. We can think of no bet- 
 ter outlay of money,, than a manure shed thnnigli the 
 centre of the yard, where the manure should occa- 

sionally be collected through the winter, and com- 
 posted with soil, weeds, &c. It might be opened on 
 two sides, so that cattle could run over it, and would 
 also answer fur shelter for them. 

Fruit Orchard. — Budding may still be attended 
 to, at least with apple and peach trees. Examine ties 
 to see that they are not Injuring or cutting into stocks 
 or buds. Manure, plongh and subsoil ground intend- 
 ed for fall planting of orchards. Select your list of 
 variciies, and have them ready for use. Grape vines 
 should have superfluous wood thinned out. Cut out 
 decayed berries from bunches. Pears are best ripened 
 in the house, and should be gathered so soon as they 
 show any signs of turning color: 

Strawberry beds should be thoroughly weeded out 
 and kept clean during the fall ; for new pl.antations 
 the spring is preferable. Apply wash to bark of trees 
 if not previously done; cut out blighted limbs. 

Vegetable Gardex. — Within the first ten or twelve 
 days in this month is the proper time to sow cabbage 
 seed for transplanting into frames, to keep through 
 winter. The season is so uncertain that there is 
 danger of being too early as well as too late. If the 
 fall continues warm, so as to continue their growth, 
 it must be checked by one or two transplantings. 
 Early and Large York and Early Sugar-loaf, are the 
 best for this purpose. Prickly-seeded Spinach should 
 also now be sown for winter and spring use, in 
 ground heavily manured, and at two or three periods 
 in the month. Sow in drills ten inches apart, and 
 cover with the rake. When the plants are up, thin 
 out to three or four inches. The early sowings may 
 bo used in the forepart of winter. Transplant En- 
 dive and sow Radish seed. Cor i Sal, id and Winter 
 Cresses. Lettuce seed should also now be sown, to 
 transplant into beds nest month, to remain over win- 
 ter. Brown Dutch and Hardy Cabbage are the best 
 varieties for this purpose. Earth up Celery as it pro- 
 gresses in growth, on dry days only. Gather all seeds 
 as they ripen, also medicinal and pot-herbs. New 
 plantations of the lattermay now be made by divi- 
 sion of the roots. Look over cucumber vines and 
 . gather for pickling before they are injured by frost. 

From the miildle to the last of the month, sow 
 CiiuliBower seed, on a rich piece of ground, finely 
 prepared, and rake the seed in carefully. If the 
 weather is dry, water before and after they are up, 
 and in the course of a month or six weeks, prick the 
 plants carefully into beds, about throe inches apart, 
 and cover with glass as for winter cabbage. 

Onion seed, to stand the winter, may also now be 
 sown. Hoe turnips and cabbage and keep the ground 
 clear of weeds, removing all offal from the ground as 
 each crop is gathered, and haul to compost heap.
