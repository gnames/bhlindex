Action ot Drouglit ou Plants. 

The specific action of drought on plants is one of 
 the proldems not yet entirely solved. Whether it is 
 the indirect w.aste of moisture on the plants by evap- 
 oration, or the want of the due proportion of water 
 necessary to build up tlic structure of plants, or 
 whether it is some indirect action on the constituents 
 of the soil, is by no means a settled question. 

The present season has alibrded abundant illustra- 
 tions of tlie eil'ect of want of moisture on the .several 
 plants the farmer has to cultivate; and what is more 
 rema kalile, the druuglit, though absolutely less than 
 it was last vcar, seems to have liad a gi'eater cSect 
 on the plants. The meadows espeoi.ally appear to 
 have suffered. In all tlie Northern counties particu- 
 larly, the grass crop is peculiarly affected. Tlie fi- 
 ner and shorter grasses are, ab.vdutoly either wanting, 
 or so thin that they show the meadow to be without 
 bottom grass. Theeo.arser grasses are tall, but thin, 
 and running to seed, forming no tillering stalks, and 
 few blades in comparison to thoso of former years. 

The corn is the same — thin, stunted, and spiry in iU 
 character. There has been no tilling — no thick 
 matted surface. The drills have been visilile up t« 
 the present period, and the stems are fast runnino- t» 
 ear before half the usual height is attained, being 
 also hard and yellow in color, and as diiferent as 
 possible from the graceful flopping blade the wheat 
 plant usually exhibits at this period. 

Now, in what specific way has this drought so act- 
 ed on the plants ? In ordinary vegetables ninety 
 per cent, of their whole structure is simply water. 
 Ilence it is easy to conceive how large a quantity of 
 that material is necessary during their growth and 
 developement. But there was nosueb absolute defici- 
 ency this season. The soil always contained a com- 
 paratively large amount of moisture; the dews were 
 often plentiful, amounting to fully as much more ai 
 any diurnal development of the plant could require-, 
 and the tables of rain fallen iu the Spring of thi» 
 year, we have seen, showed a larger quantitv than is 
 the corresponding months of last year, llcnce it 
 seems we must look to the abstract cause of the in- 
 jury — to somewhat beyond the mere denuding of tb« 
 plant of water, as such. 

We think the theory of Liebig far better establish- 
 ed this season. The plant to take up its element^ 
 must have them presented to it in a state of solution. 
 The action of rain operates to dissolve regularly and 
 gradually tha material required l>y the plant, both 
 in the soil and in the rocks from which the soil con- 
 tinually forming, by disintegrating the small parti- 
 tlcles existing in the land. These are being suppli- 
 ed to the plant by the rains as it requires them, bol 
 this year they have not been so washed out and made 
 ready for its use. 

But why did not the same cause operate equally 
 in the Spring of 1852? Simply because the inee»- 
 sant rains of the autumn and early winter had w.ash- 
 ed out the soluble constituents of the n\>il. so as <# 
 leave less free material in the land by far than in the 
 previous Spring, and hence the ordinary dr;uiglit. had 
 much greater effect on the plants this year than it had 
 last. 

The effect of water on plants, regularly supplied 
 is most wonderful. Thoso who liavc seen the Ciii- 
 stiine water meadows, and the small and clear stream 
 which produces fmm three to five crops of grass per 
 annum, either depastured or mown, or partly tho 
 one and partly the other, must be convinced that it 
 is almost as much owing to the plentiful supply of 
 water in a dry seasjn, a-s to any great amount of ma-
