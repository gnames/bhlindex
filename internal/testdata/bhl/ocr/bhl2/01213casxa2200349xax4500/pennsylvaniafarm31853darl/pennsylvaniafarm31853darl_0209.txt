We have been favored with a copy of this work, 
 which, on examination, we tiud to be a really practi- 
 cal and valuable treatise on Bee-keeping aud man- 
 agement, going into the whole matter in a practical 
 way, such a^ bee hives, bee pasturage, breeding, wax, 
 destruction of worms, putting on and 'taking off box- 
 es, securing from moth, swarming, loss of queens, 
 fall and winter management, purchasing stocks and 
 transporting, &a. Several of the treatises on Bees 
 are too theoretical, with which the present oSiirs a 
 favorable contrast, containing the author's own ex- 
 perieuce for the last twenty years. As he remarks, 
 the chapter on loss of Queens alone, will be worih, 
 to any one not in the secret, many timss the cost of 
 the work. In the preface he says: 

It is time that the word "lue/c", as applied to bee- 
 keeping, was discarded. The prevailing opinion, that 
 bees Will prosper for one person more tuau a»-otUer, 
 under tlie same circumstances, is tallacious. As well 
 might It be applied to tUe mechanic and tarmer. Tue 
 careless, ignorant farmer, miglit occasionally suc- 
 ceed in raising a gooil crop witn a poor fence ; but 
 Would be liable, Lt auy timo, to lose it by trespassing 
 cattle. He might liave suitable soil in tlie beginning, 
 buc without knowledge, tor the proper application ol 
 manures, it might tail to produce ; unless a chance 
 applicition happened to be right. 

iiac with the iutettiyeat tai'iuer the ca^e is different: 
 fences in order, manures judiciously applied, and 
 with propitious seasons, he mates a sure tiling of it. 
 O.iU lum "lucki/" it you please; it is his knowledge 
 and care that render linn so. So with bee-Keeping, 
 the ciireUil man is the "lucky" one. Tnere can be 
 no effect without a preceding cause- If y m lose a' 
 stock of bees, there is a cause or*;auses producing it, 
 just as certain as the failure of a crop with the uu- 
 tlirifty tarmer, can be traced to a poor fence or uh- 
 fruitlui soil. You may rest assured, that a rail is oli' 
 your fence of maiiageiueut somewhere, or the proper 
 ;ipplioations hiive not been made. In relation to bees, 
 tiiesu tilings may not be quite so apparent, yet never- 
 theless true. Wliy is there so muen more uncertain- 
 ty in a[)iarian sc.ence than other farmijig operations? 
 It must, be attributed to the fact, th.it among the 
 thousands who are engaged in, and have studied ag 
 riculture, perhaps not more than one has given nis 
 energies to the nature and habits of bees. It know- 
 ledge is elicited in the same ratio, we ought to have 
 a tiiousand times more light on one subject than the 
 other, and still there are some things, even in agri- 
 culture, that may yet be learned. 

It is supposed, by many, that we already have all 
 the knowledge that the subject of 6eC4' affords. Thi^ 

is not surprising; a person that was never furnished 
 with a full treatise, miglit arrive at such conclusions. 
 Unless his own experience goes deeper, he can have 
 no means of judging what is yet behind. 

In conversation relative to this work, with a per- 
 son of considerable scientific attainments, he remark- 
 ed, "You do not want to give the natural history of 
 bees at all ; that is already sufficiently understood." 
 And how is it understood; as Iluber gives it, or ia 
 accordance with some of our own writers? If we 
 take Iluber as a guide, we find many points recently 
 contradicted. If we compare autiiors of our day, we 
 find them contradicting each other. Oue recommends 
 a peculiarly constructed hive as just the thing adapt- 
 ed to their nature and instincts. If a single point is 
 in accordance with their nature, lie labors to twist all 
 the others to his purpose, although it may involve a 
 fundamental principle impossible to reconcile. Some 
 one else succeeds in another point, and proceeds to 
 recommend something altogether different. False 
 and c jntradictory assertiims are made either through 
 ignorance or interest Interest may blind the jud"- 
 ment, and spurious history may deceive. 

It is folly to expect success ia bee-keeping for any 
 length of time, without a correct knowledge of their 
 nature and instincts ; and this we shall never obtain 
 by the cotirse hitherto pursued. As much of their 
 labor is performed in the dark, and difficult to be ob- 
 ■ser.yed, it has given rise to conjecture and false rea- 
 soning, leading to false conclusions. 

When / say a thing is so, or say it is not so, what 
 evidence has the reader that it is proved and demon- 
 strated? Ml/ mere assertions are not expected to be 
 taken in preference to another's; of such proof, we 
 have more than enough. Most people have not' the 
 time, patience, or ability, tj set down quietly with 
 closeobservation, and investigate the subject thorou"-h- 
 ly. Hence it has been found easier to receive error 
 for truth, than to make the exertion necessary to con- 
 fute it; the more so, because there is no guide to di- 
 rect the investigation. I shall, therefore, pursue a 
 different course; and for every assertiuii endeavor to 
 givi; a test, that the reader iiuiy apply and satisfy 
 himself, and trust to no one. As for theories, I shall 
 try to keep them separate from facts, and offer such 
 evidence as I have, either for or against them. If 
 the reader has further proof that presents the matter 
 in another light, of course lie will exercise the rifht 
 to a difference of opinion. 

I could give a set of rules for practice, and be very 
 briefi but tills would be unsatisfactory. When we 
 are told a thing must be done, most of us, like the 
 "inquisitive Yankee," have a desire to know why it is 
 necessary; and then like to know /ioio to do it. This 
 gives us confidence that ,ve are right. Hence, I shall 

Endeavor to give the practical part, in as close con- 
 nection with the natural history, that, dictates it, as 
 possible. 

This work will contain several chapters entirely 
 new to the public: the result of my own experience, 
 that will be ot the utmost value to all who ilesire to 
 realize the greatest possible advantages form their

The Blue Hen's Chicken says, I'uter Talloy, ot 
 Brandywine Hundred, has sold the present season, 
 4000 boxes of raspberries, to Wm. 11. Smith, for which 
 he received S-2oO. Mr. T. has about one aero devo- 
 ted to the rearing of this fruit, and as the cost of 
 picking is only one cent pi?r box, it may be seen that 
 they have paid quite handsomely, much belter thaa 
 raising grain.
