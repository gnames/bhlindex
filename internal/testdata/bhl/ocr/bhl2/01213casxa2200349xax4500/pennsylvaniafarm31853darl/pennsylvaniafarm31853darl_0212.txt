The Crystal I'alace. 

Durinjr; the past week many additions of an attrac- 

tive and us;(\il character have been made to both the 
 buikling and its contents. A ship from Leghorn 
 came into this port on hist Tuesday, with no less than 
 172 oases for eshiljition, and many more from other 
 parts of the world, are yet to arrive. . Wo most give 
 uur French cousins the greatest credit for having 
 their department arranged in the neatest manner, 
 and in tlie niDSt advanced state. Our English cous- 
 ins are the farthest behind in arrangement and deco- 
 oration; indeed, Uncle .To'^n must get up some hiffh 
 pressure before ho can steam up to be alongside of any 
 department in the building. As it regards neatness, 
 the British dep-artment does not at all compare yet 
 with any other— a radical reform is wanted, and we 
 hope the British Commissioners will push matters 
 along with more spirit, and taste, next week. The 
 Belgian D,.>partment is very good, and in many man- 
 ufactures, such as velvets, we have been delightluUj'^ 
 surprised; there is a display nearly rivalling that of 
 the French Department. Austria, "this patch on the 
 surface of the earth," has shown herself in every 
 branch of the fine ami usefol arts, to have attained a 
 high position in producing something more than patch 
 work. 

The Am-rlcan Department has advanced nobly 
 during the past week. In both the useful and orna- 
 mental arts, our countrymen arc going to do more 
 than we expected. Our brethren from other lands, 
 we are confident, will go away with a very high opin- 
 ion of the taste, genius, and skill of the piople with- 
 in the borders of our land. That eminent chemi t,' 
 Justus Liebig, in his "Letters on Chemistry," page 
 I'M, says, "the quantity of soap consumed by a na- 
 tion would lie no accurate measure whereby to esti- 
 mate its wealth and civilization." By this measure 
 we justly could claim, we believe, for the United 
 States, the title of the most wealthy and civilized na- 
 tion in the world. Pillars of soap, busts of soap, 
 window.s of soap, soap of all colors, in all shapes, in 
 all sizes, and of all smells, mark tlie vast extent of 
 our soap manufacture. We are no doubt the best 
 washed people in all creation. Some people may 
 think we are somewhat quizzical in our remarks, ow- 
 ing to the equivocal use of' the, word soap, such as 
 sofl-soapiiuj, for flattery, &c., but we assute them 
 we are sincere and mean to be understood as having 
 assumed for our standard of civilization and wealth, 
 the quantity of soap consumed by the people. 

Machine Room. — When this room is complete, 
 and all the machines to be exhibited are wliirling 
 along in aU the graceful attitudes so captivating tu 
 the enthusiastic mechanic we shall see something 
 worth being proud of, and pleased with. There will 
 be a single line of shafting 450 feet long.and straight 
 as an arrow. The largest metal cutting shears in the 
 world arc now being titted up; two large horizoutil 
 eno-ines from Lawrence, Mass., working on one shaft, 
 are now being put up for driving the machinery; a 
 lar"-e beam engine from Providence, R. L, will soon 
 bo put up for a driving engine also. The boilers to 
 supply the driving engines, are erected on the other 
 side of the street, north of the building, and entire- 
 ly separate from it. No le s than five large steam 
 lijilers have been provided, and the steam is convey- 
 ed under ground across the street. Plenty of steam 
 pjwer is thus provide 1 for all the miohinas, large 
 and small, wh'oh wdl b^ exhibited. ' We a!so ex-pect 
 to see .some tine locomotives on exhibition and trial 
 for a short p3iio 1; this will aTord m much gratifica- 
 tion. It Will hi the mmth of Septemljor, wj b.;lieve, 

before the machinery vcill be all in speration; the 
 work to be done cannot and will not be slighted. 
 The Superintendent, Mr. Holmes, is pushing matt^irs 
 as fast, as discreetly, and effectively, as he can. — [Sci-

American Wine. 

Mr. Cist, in a recent numljer of his Advertiser, 
 gives the following interesting aooor.nt of the present 
 and prosp 'ctive conditions of grape culture and wine 
 making in Cincinnati and in the vicinity. He says: 
 "I have recently visited the wine cellars of Messrs. 
 Longworth & Zimmerman, on Sycamore street. Mr. 
 Zimmerman, the active partner, with his two sons, 
 has been engaged in Europe for years in the manu- 
 facture of wine, and considers the Catawba a finer 
 bivsis for first-rate wine, t.an any in Germany or 
 France, The drawing off and properly ripening 
 wine they consider of more importance to the devel- 
 opment of aline article, than the original manufac- 
 ture. 

The wine cellars of this establishment are 105 feet 
 in length, an average of 35 in width, and 18 in height. 
 Each seasons wine is kept by itself, in casks of 2,000 
 to 2,501) gallons capacity, and none of our native wino 
 is bottled in this establishment until it has been four 
 years in casks. Thus the wine bottled this season, is 
 the vintage of 1848, as that of next year will be the 
 vintage of 1849. In this way the entire sediment, 
 precipitated by successive fermentation, is retained 
 within the cask. 

Messrs. Zimmerman will put up t.iis season 30,000 
 bottles; in 1853, 50,000; and in 1855, 100,000. What 
 will be dune beyond that period, must depend on the 
 yield of the grape crop in 1853 ; and later seasons. 
 All this i> C irawba wine, termed Still, in distinction 
 from Sparkling Catawba. 

Mr. Longworth is engaged in the manufacture of 
 Sparkling Catawba, at his wine cellars on Butler St., 
 of Broadway. He made in 1850, 50,000 buttles ; in 
 1851, 75,000, and this year he will put up 105,000 
 buttles. SparkliiigCalawbarequiresfifteen to twenty 
 months for ripening before being ready for market. 
 Mr. L. has also dry and sweet wines, the first of the 
 Catawba and the other from the Isabella grape. 

Messrs. R. Buchanan, Corneau and Sons, G. P. 
 Bergen, Rehfu.ss, Yeatmao, Miller, and others, are 
 also extensively engaged in the manufacture of Ca- 
 tawba wine. All these persons label their wines. 
 The a"gregate annual manufacture of first wine may 
 be piit down at 150,000 bottles Still, and 180,000 
 Sparkling Catawba., 

Pi-ubably 30,000 bottles Still Catawba wine is made 
 sold, and drank in this vicinity by Germans, mostly 
 the product of small vineyards. This is unbranded, 
 and of various qualities — the greater part of inferior 
 quality. But whatever may be the quality of our 
 native wines, they are all pure; that is from any- 
 thing else than the juice of the grape. One or two 
 manufacturers make sweet wines to a small extent, 
 acknowledged to be fictitious. 

The supply of native wines, greatly as it is on the 
 increase, hardly keeps up with the increasing de- 
 mand. All the" wine older than five years, of Cataw- 
 ba, is nut of market, and the Sparkling, although not 
 requiring such ft large lapse of time to fit it for use, 
 is taken off as fast as it can b3 made for market. 

There are about l,200acres of grapes in cultivation 
 in the vicinity of this city. Every year adds to the 
 quantity of bearing vine's, and to the number of per- 
 sons engag;d in the business."— ScientiEo Ameri-
