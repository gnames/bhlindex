Cranberry VLiies. 

In answer to many enquiries, respecting culture of 
 sranberries from our subscribers, we annex tlie fol- 
 lowing directions, from F. Trowbridge, New Haven, a 
 practical grower. His advertisement will be found 
 on our cover. 

"The Bell variety or Egg shape is mostly cultiva- 
 ted in New England, and usually bears good crops as 
 they grow w'ild^but when transplanted and cultiva- 
 ted, the berries are large and abundant, and bears 
 largo crops often after two or three years, from one 
 hundred and fifty to two hundred and fifty bushels 
 per acre — are hardy, and can be cultivated in any 
 part of the United States. 

The soil best adapted, is such as will keep moist 
 through the dry season, they have been raised on 
 land high enough to produce corn and potatoes, with 
 a wet substratum under the soil, or a clay and loam. 
 They will not succeed well on dry, sandy, on land 
 Kable to bake or become hard in dry weather — but 
 they m\\ produce an abundant crop on poor, swampy 
 land, that will not produce any other valuable crop, 
 or any wet land after being drained. Dry ground 
 should be plowed and harrowed smooth, in a swamp 
 where a plow will not work; the turf or bog may be 
 peeled off or burnt to get the weeds and grass out. 
 They may be set in the Fall or Spring as early as the 
 ground will admit, until the middle of May. Moss, 
 Tan, or anything to retain the moisture would be 
 beneficial around the plant after transplanting; a 
 little sand around the plant. Fall and Spring, will 
 tend to keep the weeds out. 

"Plant in drills as you plant strawberry, cab- 
 bage, and other plants, one and a half to two feet 
 apart. At two feet apart each way, it will take 10,- 
 000 plants to the acre. Hoe them slightly at first, 
 until the roots become cIinohed,and aiterwards no oth- 
 er cultivation is needed, unless to keep out the grass ^ 
 weeds. The plants may be expected to run together 
 and cover the whole ground in two or three years. 
 They can be gathered with a cranberry rake made 
 for the purpose, to be procured at the Agricultural 
 Stores." 

Materials for Milk Pans. 

According to the experiments of M. Ilinueber, of 
 Moisburg, Germany, 100 Ilanovor quarts of milk 
 yielded, in tinned milk pans, 7.07 Hanover lbs. of 
 butter; Ghxss, 7.04; Wooden, (not painted,) 0.96; 
 Earthenware, 6.92; Wooden, (painted,) 0.67. 

According to the s.arae experiments, there requir- 
 ed for one pound of butter, of milk produced by 
 stall-feeding with green clover, 15 Hanover quarts 
 of milk; produced by stall-feeding with tare and clo- 
 ver, 1.5.07 quarts; by pasturing, 11.84; showing that 
 ths milk obtained from cattle led upon pastures is 
 richer in butter than milk got from cuws which have 
 been f„d in the stable with one and the same kind of 
 pilots: even a mixture of tare and clover shows an 
 increase over clover alone. — ^[Polyteo. Jour. 

Expenses of Importing Jersey Cows. 

In answer to mmy inquiries with regard to the ex- 
 pense of importing neat cattle, we give the following 
 bill of expenses, for two heifers, obtained from a gen- 
 tleman who has made many importations: 
 For hay and other provisions, £9 9 3 

Expenses from Jersey to Liverpool, 11 3 

Keeping in Liverpool one week, 2 3 6 

House on board ship, 6 10 

Commissions, &c., • 17 8 

Freight, £10, primage, 10^. 

£30 3 5 
 £10 10 

£40 13 5 

This is a few pence short of S200. The freight on 
 these two animals ($50) is about one-half the usual 
 charge. Primage is an allowance made to the mas- 
 ter or hands of a vessel for loading. Almost all the 
 other charges, it will be seen are extortionate. 

There is no reason now, why any one, except one 
 owning a herd, and desiring a fresh strain of blood, 
 should import. We have here, already, animals of 
 every Engfish breed, equal to any that are left be- 
 hind. Besides, the remark of Rosewell L. Colt, 
 that the animals raised in this couutry (from import- 
 ed stock) are superior to the imported — is worthy of 
 consideration. In the first place they arc acclimated, 
 and again, they are unstrained and uninjured by a 
 sea voyage. — [.Journal of Agriculture. 

Balky Horses. 
 Balky, or jlbbish horses, are not only a source of 

great annoyance, but too frequently endanger the 
 property and peril the lives of their owners. An 
 East India gentleman one day took his seat in one of 
 the omnibuses in London, but at the time of starting, 
 all the efforts of the driver proved unavailing, owing 
 to a balky horse attached to the vehicle. The poor 
 animal became more and more restive in proportion 
 to the tortures inflicted upon him bp the driver, and 
 several other whipmen who assisted on the occasion. 
 The street became blocked up with spectators, and 
 the interception of other carriages. Groat danger 
 was to be apprehhcnded. The East India gentleman 
 above referred tt-, suggested to the driver and his 
 assistants, that if they would try the East India 
 method of fastening a cord to the horse's fore-foot, 
 and cause a person to pull forward, the animal would 
 start right away. The suggestion was received with 
 contempt. However, after all other efforts failed, a 
 long cord was attached to the animal's fore-foot, and 
 the moment the man gave a stron; pull, the horse 
 started off as if nothing had been the matter. The 
 philosophy of this seoras to be that the animal.thrown 
 off the centre of gravity by the propulsion forward, 
 is taken by surpri.se, and obliged to start. Try it.

Hay Elevators. 

Thomas F. Jarrett, of Horsham, Montgomery 
 county. Pa., has made some useful improvements in 
 Hay Elevators, for which he has taken measures to 
 secure a patent. In general character and appear- 
 ance it resembles those in common use. But by 
 means of a simple arrangement of a lever, catch, 
 pulley, ropes, and weight, the elevator is brought un- 
 der the control of the operator, so that it is guided to 
 its destination freed from its load, and re-adjusted 
 with great facility. — [Scientific American.
