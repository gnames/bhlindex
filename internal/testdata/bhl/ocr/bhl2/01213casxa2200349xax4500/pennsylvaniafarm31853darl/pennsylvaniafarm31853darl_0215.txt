Stock Raising. 

The following are Lord Spencer's rules for the se- 
 lection of male animals for breeding: 

"The first thing to be considered in the selection of 
 a male animal are the indications by which it may 
 be possible to form a judgment as to his constitution. 
 In all animals a wide chest indicates strength of con- 
 stitution, and there can be no doubt that this is the 
 point of shape to whicli it is most material for any 
 breeder to look to in the selection of cither a bull or 
 a ram. In order to ascertain that the cliest of these 
 animals is wide, it is not sufficient to observe that 
 they have wide bosoms, but the width which is per- 
 ceived by looking at them in front, should be consid- 
 ered along the brisket, which ought to show great 
 fulnBss in the part just under the elbows; it is also 
 necessary that tliey should be what is called thick 
 through the heart. 

Another indication of what a good constitution is, 
 is that a male animal should have a masculine ap- 
 pearance; with this view, a certain degree of coarse- 
 ness is by no means objectionable; but thig coarseness 
 should not be such as would be likely to show itself 
 in a castrated animal, because it thus might happen 
 that the oxen or weatliers produced from such a sire 
 would be coarse also, which in them would be a 
 fault. Another point to be attended to, not me'rely 
 as an indication of a good constitution, but as a 
 merit in itself, is, tliat an animal in itself should ex- 
 hibit great muscular power, or rather that his mus- 
 cles should be large. This is an unusual accompan- 
 iment of strength of constitution; hut it also shows 
 that there will be a good proportionate mixture of 
 lean and fat produced from the animal, the muscles 
 being that part which in meat is lean. A thick neck 
 is, in both bulls and rams, a proof of the muscles be- 
 ing large, and there can hardly be a greater fault in 
 the shape of a male animal of either sort than his 
 having a thin neck. I am inclined to say that in 
 the new Leicester breed of sheep, which is the breed 
 to which I am aoustomed, a ram's neck cannot bo 
 too thick. Other indications of muscles are more 
 difficult to observe in sheep than in cattle. In a bull 
 there ought to be a full muscle on each side of the 
 back-bone, just behind the topof the shoulder blades; 
 he ought also to have the muscles on the outside of 
 the thigh full and extending down nearly to the 
 hough. It will seldom happen that a bull having 
 these indie tions will bo found deScient in muscle. 
 As I am writing for the use of farmers, it is quite un- 
 necessary for me to attempt a description of what is 
 considered a well-shaped bull or ram; it is obviously 
 impossible to express in wjrds what is meant by 
 good handling. It is sufficient to say, therefore, that 
 no small animal is fit to be used- at all as a sire, 
 whose handling is not good; and that the more per- 
 fect his shape the better." 

Flax Culture in Indiana. 

Mr. R. T. Brown, of Crawfordsville, in a commu- 
 nication to Gov. Wright, President of the Indiana 
 State Board of Agriculture, siiys: 

"I senil you enclosed a f.'W samples of flas cot- 
 ton presented to me by the II. L. Ellsworth, of La- 
 fayette. Mr. Ellsworth has secured the machinery 
 necessary for the manufacture of cotton, and will 
 have it in operation early in the season. Ho has on 
 hand the stem grown on 120 acres last season, which, 
 from experiments alr;ady made, will, he supposes, 
 yield about oUO pounds per acre of cotton similar to 
 No. 2, of the enclosed specirams. The expense of re- 
 ducing the fibre to this state, after the stem is pro- 

duced, is about two cents per pound, which, at the 
 usual price of cotton (10 cents,) will leave eight cents 
 per pound, or §2-1 per acre for the farmer who pro- 
 duces it. To this must be added the value of the 
 seel, which will range from SO to $8 per acre, giving 
 a final result of §30 at least for each acre. This is 
 Mr. Ellsworth's calculation. — [Scientific American. 

Blooded Stock. 

Recently it was noticed that a large and valuable 
 lot of English blooded stock, cows, sheep; &c., arriv- 
 ed at the port of Philadelphia, in one of our packet 
 ships from Liverpool, on their way to Kentucky, for 
 parties in that State who had imported them. They 
 bohmged to the Northern Kentucky Importing Asso- 
 ciation, and were procurrod (or them by their a- 
 gents, Messrs. Dudley, Garrard and Van Meter. 

On Thursday, the 18th inst., the animals were sold 
 at public auction, on the farm of Brutus 1. Clay, in 
 Bourbon county, and attracted a larger assembly of 
 people than was ever gathered at any previous occa- 
 sion of the kind in the State. As a principal feature 
 of the sale, we may mention that the bids were re- 
 stricted to- citizens of Kentucky, and the purchasers 
 were required to give, bond not to remove the stock 
 from the State for twelve months. It will, therefore, 
 be seen that this was solely an attempt to improve 
 the stock of Kentucky by the introduction of these 
 superior breeds. There were 10 bulls, 15 cows and 
 heifers, all of the short horned, pure blooded stock; 
 1 horse, and 8 sheep of the Southdown, Cotswold 
 and Leicester breeds. All of these are of the best 
 description, and are regarded as invaluable acqui- 
 sitions. 

By the published list, it seems that the successful 
 bidders were from Fayette, Bourbon, Clarke, Wood- 
 ford, Scott and Franklin counties, all in the vicinity 
 of Lexington. The prices were remarkable. One 
 bull brought upwards of §6,000; a heifer upwards of 
 S.3,000; a ram upwards of $1,090; and the horse $2,- 
 800. The whjle cost of "the stock, importation and 
 transportation included, as they stood at the farm, 
 was $23,000, and the total proceeds of the sale 
 amounted to $65,970, being a nett profit of $32,976; 
 so that, as a mere speculation, this was truly a profit- 
 able venture, yielling a return of nearly one hundred 
 and fifty per cent, upon the capital invested. It will, 
 doubtless, lead to similar undertakings in other quar- 
 ters. — [North American.

Save the Dead teaves. 

If every Horticulturist would reflect for a moment 
 on the nature of fallen leaves^vvhich contain not 
 only the vegetable matter, but the earthy salts, lime, 
 potash, &o., needed for the next season's growth — 
 and that, too, exactly in the proportion required by 
 the very tree and plant from which they fall — nay, 
 more, if they would consider that it is precisely in 
 this way, by the decorapositicm of these very fallen 
 leaves that nature enriches the soil, year after year 
 in her great fijrest, it would scarcely be po sible for 
 such a reflecting Horticulturist to allow these leaves 
 to be swept away by every wind that blows, and fi- 
 nally be lost altogether. A wise Horticulturist will 
 diligently collect from week to week, the leaves that 
 fall under each tree, and by digging them under the 
 soil about the roots, where they will decay and en- 
 rich that soil, provide in the cheapest manner the 
 best possible food for that tiee. In certain vineyards 
 in France, the vines are kept in the highest condition, 
 by simply burying at their roots every leaf and 
 branch that is pruned (iff such vines, or that falls 
 from them at the end of the sea3on.^[IIorticulturist.
