New Rocbelle Blackberry. 

The following account of this new Blackberry, ive 
 find among the proceedings of the New York Farm- 
 er's Club. In the cultivation of new seedling fruits, 
 the Blackberry appears to have been lost sight of, 
 this variety being a chance production. It has been 
 found that our native Blackberry improves greatly 
 by cultivation, and in the neighborhood of large cities, 
 farmers would find an acre or more of plants, obtain- 
 ed from the woods, set out in rows, so as to admit of 
 the passage of the cultivator, and kept free from 
 weeds, would be very profitable. There -is no more 
 wholesome fruit, and it is used in such a variety of 
 ways, that^the Remand is very great. 

A splendid specimen of the Blackberry was pre- 
 sented to the Society, by Mr. Lavvton, ot New Ko- 
 chelle. Many of the berries were from three to four 
 inches in circumference. A large basKet of them 
 were partaken of by the members, and their rich and 
 luscious pulp was duly praised. Mr. Lawton named 
 the fruit "The New Kochelle Blackberry," but on a 
 vote of the memhersof the Club, the name has been 
 changed to "The Lawton Blackberry." A vote of 
 thanks from the Club was also tendered to Mr. Law- 
 ton. The following paper spas read by Mr. Lawton: 

The Blackberry — To which I have before called 
 the attention of the Club— has been cultivated in 
 small quantities for several years in New Kochelle, 
 Westchester county, where I now reside. I have not 
 been able to ascertain who first discovered the plant, 
 and broughi it into garden culture, but I am inform- 
 ed it was found on the road side and from thence in- 
 troduced intj the neighboring gardens. As it came 
 to me without any name to distinguish it from the 
 Wild Bramble, I beg leave to introduce It to the no- 
 tice of the Club as the "New Kochelle Blackberry," 
 and at the same time, present as a specimen a lew 
 quarts of the fruit, gathered this morning, precisely 
 as they came from the bushes without being selected. 
 I have examined many works with a view to ascertain 
 if there has been any improvement on the well known 
 wild varieties, but without success. The "Double 
 Flowering," "Dwarf," or "Dewberry," "American 
 Upright," and the "White Fruited," are all that are 
 named. The Dewberiy is the first to ripen, and the 
 best flavored fruit. The AVhite Fruited stems to be 
 cultivated as a novelty more tha i for the fruit. The 
 Upright variety fruit, late in the season, is of vigor- 
 ous growth, and under favorable circumstances pro- 
 duces large mulberry shaped berries, but the seeds 
 are not thickly bedded in the pulp, and are so abun- 
 dant as to impair materially the quality of the fruit. 
 This plant seems to adhere to its original character 
 with singular tenacity, or from the many millions of 
 plants which spring up from seeds annually distrib- 
 uted in almost every diversity of climate and soil, 
 we should constantly find new varieties. Improving 
 the wild plant by careful cultivation is one thing; to 
 produce a new variety is another. The fruit now be- 
 fore you, I believe to be of the last nap?ed character. 
 It is not like the Dewberry, or long and mulberry- 
 shaped like "Upright Blacliberry," and the seeds are 
 so completely imbedded in a rich pulp as hardly to 
 be noticed. 1 think in shape and size they compare 
 very well with the Ilovey feeedling Strawberry. 

The "New Kochelle Blackberry" sends up annual- 
 ly large and vigoro s upright shoots with lateral 
 branches, all of which, under common cultivation, 
 will bo crowded with fine fruit, a portion of which 

ripen daily in moist seasons for six weeks. My plants 
 have ripened from the 20th to 30th July, until 1st to 
 I th August. They are perfectly hardy, always thrif- 
 ty and productive, and I have not found them liable 
 to blight or injury by insects. 

It will be many years before our citizens general- 
 ly will be able to procure this fine fruit, as our large- 
 hotels and saloons will contract at high prices for all 
 that can be sent to market. But numerous private 
 gardens may be stocked lor family use in tiiree or 
 four years, and in their turn aid in the distribution. 
 Exd'ept that they are perfectly hardy and need no, 
 protection in winter, the cultivation may be the same 
 as the Antwerp Raspberry, but to produce berries of' 
 the largest size they should have a heavy damp soil 
 and shade. 

Hen Roost Guano. 

Every man who keeps a hen, has a small guano 
 factory, which may or may not bo made useful to him, 
 accordingly as he uses his factory prudently or care- 
 lessly. 

Wbat is Peruvian guano? The droppings of sea- 
 birds that flock about the islands on the Peruvian 
 coast. These droppings having collected there for 
 hundreds of years, and there being but little rain to 
 wash it away, an immense quantity of this material is 
 there found, and is now being broujiht to England 
 and this country, by the ship-load. Were it not for 
 the snows and rains on the coast of Labrador, and on 
 some of the islands on our coast, the same material 
 could be found in abundance there. 

By keeping your hen on the roost, or keeping her 
 guano under cover, you obtain as good an article, 
 probably, as (he Peruvian. 

Mr. A. Todd, of Smithfield, R. I., speaking of his 
 "home made guano," in a recent number of the New 
 England Farmer, recommends to empty the ashes 
 from the stove f.nd fire-place, into the hen-roost, 
 and wilh the addition of plenty of sandy loam, mix- 
 ed as of course it will be, with the droppings of the 
 hens, an excellent manure, equal to guano, would be 
 made. He thinks, from a flock of thirty hens, half 
 a cord of good manure could be easily made, which 
 would be equal to a cord of stable manure.- — [Maine

Saving Seed from Garden V'egetabies. 

The first vegetable peas or snapbeans that appear, 
 save for seed; the first stalk of okra that shows a pod, 
 let it all go to seed; the first cucumber, squash or 
 melon, save for seed. In this way we may suc- 
 ceed in getting much earlier vegetables than by fol- 
 lowing the usual method of taking the refuse of all 
 our garden crops for seed. Our efg plants might be 
 brought into bearing, much sooner, if we would save 
 the first for seed. Who can stand it, with all the 
 long year's dearth of delicious morsels, to save the 
 first roasting ear or tomato, that may appear for seed, 
 and yet if we would bring forward the whole crop 
 two or three weeks earlier, it must be done. Let it 
 be a settled maxim of the gardener — the first and 
 best of every thing J'or seed. — [Soil of the South. 

The Stuj'vesant Pear Free. 

This pear tree which was planted in New York, by 
 Gov. Stuyvesant, 'two hundred and sixty years ago,' 
 on the spot which has since become the corner of 13th 
 street, and 3d avenue, is still flourishing and fruit- 
 ful.
