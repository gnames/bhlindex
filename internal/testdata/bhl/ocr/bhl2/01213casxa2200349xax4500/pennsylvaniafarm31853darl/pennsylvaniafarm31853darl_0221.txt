We commend the following excellent article to the 

p irticular attention of our readers. The cherry is 

more difficult to transplant successfully than any 

other fruit tree. 

For the Farm Journal. 

Culture of Cherry Trees. 

Messrs. Editors: 

There is an opinion, and it has 
 been expressed in tU's Journal, that cherry trees are 
 more difficult to transplant than other fruit ttees. 
 With the same mode of procedure they certainly are, 
 but if treated as the constitution of the tree requires, 
 thjy live aa.l grow as certainly aad as freely as an 
 apple tree or a plum tree. 

The chief difference results from the tenderness of 
 the roots of the cherry tree. They do not bear ex- 
 posure to dry air, nor the least touch of frost; nor 
 can they bear to stand in wet ground, or in a wet hole 
 in the ground; nor will the tree bear to be wounded 
 late in the Spring, after the buds swell in March; 
 grafts will not grow it set after that time, though 
 they grow quite freely if inserted before; nor will it 
 answer tj raise or dig up the tree so late for trans' 
 planting. 

As the roots do not bear to be set deep into the 
 cold wet ground, and it being their natural habit to 
 run along close beneath the surface, they must of 
 course be planted shallow. 

The necessity of observing the following directions 
 will be apparent from what has been said, and is 
 proved by experience. 

Raise the trees in the Fall if possible, (in Oct. or 
 or early Nov.,) immediately coat the roots by plunging 
 in mud, or covering with light dry soil, if not to be 
 carried far. If the soil whore they are to be planted is 
 not very louse and dry, choose a spot in the garden 
 or elsewhere, and bury the roots, there to remain till 
 Spring; fill the fine mould among the roots and heap 
 enough over them to ensure against frost or wet, for 
 they are quite as tender as putatoes. Plant early in 
 the Spring; take out only one tree at a time; prune 
 the bruised ends of roots to sound wood, and immedi- 
 ately place it in the previously prepared shallow hole, 
 and filter in enough fine mould to cover the rooi.s; so 
 proceed with the others, and afterwards fill the holes- 
 In all this, let it be a main care to avoid exposing the 
 roots. 

Now to prevent their drying up, and suddenly dy- 
 ing in the Summer, lay on a thick, wide mulching of 
 straw, or other litter, and if the stem is tall, sheathe 
 it with long straw; but the trees are far better if they 
 branch low, so that their foliage will shade the stem 
 and roots, and so that the sap has less distance to 
 make its' way up the continually drying stem — for 
 this reason avoid large tall trees for planting. 

By no means remove a leaf from any part of the 
 tree during the first Summer. Before planting, read 
 the article in the Journal for 1853, vol. 2, p. 354, and 
 vol. 3, p. 12. The latter article {by A. W. Corson,) 
 should be studied by all who are planting fruit gar- 
 dens as it bears the marks of veteran acquaintance 
 with the subject. 

With this care it is one of the easiest things to es- 
 tablish a grove of cherry trees. Once set, they grow 
 rapidly; theyflourish on tbopoorest and thinnest soils. 
 The fruit ripening early in the Sutnmer; the tree 
 seems to become recuperated by the Antumn growth 
 sufficiently to enable it to bear a full crop the next 
 season; yet the tree is benefitted by culture, equally 
 with others; grass and weeds interfere seriously with 
 the shallow running routs, and greatly reduce the 
 size and amount of the fruit. 

Although cherry trees are but little liable to dif. 
 ease or injury by insects, they are not exempt, or 
 they would be the only exception to the decree that 
 went forth at the expulsion of our first Parents, from 
 the garden prepared for them, and which imposed 
 toil am6ng thorns and thistles as the future price fur 
 every thing it contained. Cherry trees suffer, when 
 young, fi'om aphides, (destroyed by tobacco water,) 
 and slugs, (destroyed by dusting with lime crashes.) 
 The roots are often eaten by worms, and the trunk, 
 if exposed, is liable to split, especially in the West, 
 and in low rich ground Eastward. The best preven- 
 tive course is to allow the trunk to be shaded by its 
 natural screen of foliage, and this course .also adds 
 greatly to the beauty and productiveness of the tree. 

The cherry being a transient fruit, many are re- 
 quired to form a succession; and taking into consid- 
 eration the different flavors, seasons, adaptedness for 
 cooking, &c., a proper assortment cannot be com- 
 posed of any less than twelve or fifteen different 
 kinds. For the same reason it is not advisable to 
 plant many of one sort, unless inte \diiig for m.arket; 
 many of the kinds require but little space, especial- 
 ly if grown on dwarf stocks. Dukes in this form, re- 
 quire but six or eight s((uare yards. Large growing 
 standards require thirty to forty.

Although in draining land thoroughly, your purse 
 may be drained, yet the full crops that follow, will 
 soon fill it up again.
