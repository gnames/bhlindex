For the Farm Jouruai. 
 Gapes ill Chickens. 

Mr. Editor: — In tho July number of the Farm 
 Journal, a correspondent asks a cure for tlu.t plague 
 of the poultry braoiler — "gapes." Now every one 
 who has suffered in this wise has doubtless "tried 
 every thing," but without success, or rather "without 
 obtaining a specific — and as there is no such thing as 
 this among the human race, there is probably none 
 among the race of chickens, fori imagine that chick- 
 ens have their idiosyncracies as well as men. But 
 without further preface, I will give you the result of 
 my small experience in this matter, premising that, 
 the treatment is not original with me, although I 
 cannot remember whether I heard or read of it,I think 
 the latter. No one, however, to whom I have men- 
 tioned it seemed to have been aware of its efficacy, 
 which, with me at least, has hitherto been certain, 
 although justice requires I should say, that there are 
 some who have tried it at my recommendation and, 
 as they allege, without success. 

The chicks should be kept away from the barn- 
 yard, and be supplied with pure, clean water, which 
 I deem to be necessary, although some contend that 
 the moisture contained in the food given them is 
 sufficient; dirty water, partioularly'barn-yard water, 
 is a certain cause of the "gapes." Your August cor- 
 respondent's meiins of preoa'iiiion, are good beyond 
 question, and entirel}' conformable to my own views, 
 and inasmuch as "an ounce of prevention is worth a 
 pound of cure," would seem to leave no more to be 
 said; but your July correspondent asks for a cure, 
 meaning; of course, the removal of a disease which 
 exists, no matter how acquired. 

The plan I have adopted, is to take the chick and 
 push a camel's pair pencil, or partly stripped feather, 
 dipped in turpentine, down through the gullet into 
 the crop, and tdrn it therein two or three times, on 
 withdrawing it, a number of small worms, the cause 
 of the disease, will probably bo brought away; this 
 may be repeated the following day, enoo, however, 
 usually suffijes. The first lime 1 tried it was on tho 
 kill or cure principle, and meeting with entire suc- 
 cess, on a very bad Subject, I have ccmtinued, when 
 there waS occasion for it, the use of the same means, 
 and so far without loosing one operated on. 

If you deem this of sufficient interest to claim a 
 space in your useful, practical Journal, I shall be 
 pleased that a remedy in which I have faith, should 
 have so extended a circulation as it will thereby ob- 
 tain. 

At a future time, if you should permit me, I will 
 give my views upon poultry raising in general, and 
 as every body thinks their method best, I certainly 
 have no wish to be singular, and therefore would only 
 do it for the benefit of those who have, as yet, no 
 method. P. — Gwynedd, Aug. 20, '53. 

We hope our correspondent \vill give us his yiews 
 on Poultry raising. — [£rf. 

Garget iu Cows. 

Messrs. Editors: — 

At the solicitation of a friend, 
 who has saved a valuable cow from tho hands of the 
 butcher, I am induced to make known through your 
 columns a remedy for the garget. Some years since 
 I met with a tiuo imported Durham cow, on the way 
 to the butcher, the owner parting with her in conse- 
 quence of her being afflicted with the garget. The 
 owner had tried all tho usual modes of eradicating 
 the disease, after which he put her under charge of 
 a distin;;;uished Veterinarian, who,after a six months' 
 attendauce, dischargeil her as incui-able. 

Deeming her a good subject for a treatment with 
 iodine, and not knowing whether it had been used in 
 the oa-e, I purchased her at what she was worth for 
 beef. "At that time she gave but a few drops of milk 
 at a time from one teat, the other three having ceased 
 to yield any — the udder and teats were swollen and 
 hard. I determined to make use of iodine in tho form 
 of hydriodate of potash, being solvent in water, and 
 if it failed to exhibit its effects on the system I would 
 resort to an ointment, (20 grains iodine to I ounce 
 hog's lard,) applied externally, to the udJer and teats. 
 I commenced by giving 10 grains of hyd. potash iu 
 a table-spoonful of water, three times a day, mixed 
 in a mash of shorts and meal; and though the dose 
 was unusually small for a cow, still, as it was giving 
 unmistakeble signs of effect. I did not incrfase the 
 dose. In seve.-. d;iys she gave milk freely, from each 
 teat, and in three weeks she was discharged its cured. 
 The result in the foregoing case was so favorable, 
 that I advised my neighbors who had cows afflicted 
 with the garget, to make a trial of the same remedy. 
 I have known of its trial in at least forty cases, and 
 in every one the cure has been effected with even tho 
 above named small dose. A larger quantity could 
 be used at a dose wii h safety. 

Any one acquainted with the effect of iodine ou 
 the human system, knows its tendency to pmduce an 
 absorption cjf the mammae. Dr. R. Coates, Philadel- 
 phi.T,, reports a case in the "Medical Examiner," of 
 the complete absorption of the female breast from 
 icxline; but the mamm;^ recovered their original de- 
 velopmeuis after a la])se of a year. Iodine is princi- 
 pally employed in diseases of the absorbents and 
 glandular systems. (See U., S. Dispensatory.) 

Hydriodate of potash can bo procured of an apoth- 
 ecary, and dissolved so as tii allow 10 grains to each 
 spoonful of water, increasing the duse till it gives 
 effect on testing the urine. — | Boston Cultivator.

Ram I>etting. 

Jonas AVobb, a well known English breeder of 
 South Down Sheep, has for Several years been in the 
 practice of letting his rams for the season, at public 
 auction. His success has been very great, and if the 
 prices he receives continue to increase, he may 'era 
 long rival the celebrated Bakewell. At his last let- 
 ting, which took place a few weeks since, seventy-one 
 sheep were let on an average of £22 4s. — equal to 
 §111 each — and one for 130 guineas, being the high- 
 est price ever brought by any of Mr. Webb's rams. 
 This animal vras bid off by Mr.Rotch — wluim we pre- 
 sume is Mr. F. M. Rotch, of Jlorris, Ostego county, 
 N. Y. At the dinner given by Mr. Webb, iVIr. Roteh 
 was hansomely complimented by tho President for 
 his spirit and. enterprise, and replied in an appropri- 
 ate speech. — [Boston Cultivator.
