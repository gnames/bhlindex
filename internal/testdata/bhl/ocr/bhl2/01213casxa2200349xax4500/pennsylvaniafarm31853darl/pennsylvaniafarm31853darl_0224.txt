aay other, and superior to most. It does not appear 
 to succeed well in Massachusetts, hut thrives in Wes- 
 tern New York, and produces abundantly of rich 
 high flavored, sub-acid fruit. In town and cities, 
 where it has some protection, and in rich warm soils, 
 it is well worthy of culture. ■ Manning speaks of it 
 "as one of the best of the old varieties." It succeeds 
 finely on the Quince, boars abundantly, and is well 
 adapted for the small garden. 

Fruit largo, oblong obovate, tapering towards the 
 stem, in a coarse manner; skin yellowish green, near- 
 ly covered with thin russet, often a little reddish 
 brown on one side: stem three-fourths of an inch long, 
 stout and obliquely inserted, thickening into the fruit! 
 calyx set in a shallow basin, with reflexed segments; 
 flesh greenish white, melting, very juicy, with a per- 
 furcod vinous flavor. September to October. Brown 
 Beurre' is of French origin. 

Fig. 4. BeukrB' Giffart.— This is an early pear^ 
 ripening about the same time as Madeleine, and only 
 introduced into the country within two or three years. 
 It is of French or Belgian origin. We imported a 
 few trees of it into Chester county last season, which 
 did not fruit, but a friend of ours also imported some 
 trees, from which he was fortunate in obtaining two 
 or three specimens, and describes them as being of 
 the highest quality, and a valuable addition to our 
 list of early pears. It succeeds well on the Quince, 
 has dark reddish wood, and rather small foliage. Ho-' 
 ▼ey describes it as follows: "Size medium; form py- 
 ramidal, full at the crown, tapering to the stem, with 
 a somewhat elongated neck; skin fair, smooth, yel- 

lowish green, pale yellow when mature, somewhsJ 
 striped and mottled, with brilliant red on the sunny 
 side, and dotted with pale russet specks; stem long, 
 about one and a half inches in length, slender curved, 
 and obliquely attached to the fruit, by a swollen and
