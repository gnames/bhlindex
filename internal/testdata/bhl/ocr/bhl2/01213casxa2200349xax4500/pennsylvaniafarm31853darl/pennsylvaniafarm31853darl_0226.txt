ANALYSIS OF SOILS— ICE HOUSES.

implements used in their cultivation, that some of 
 the larye covn-gi'owers of Middle Illinois "estimate 
 the expense from the time of starting the plow, till 
 the corn is cribbed or harvested, at only from tour to 
 six cents per bushel." So said the Editor of the 
 Prairie Farmer some two years ago. To raise corn 
 thus cheaply, the soil and climate must be peculiarly 
 adapted to its growtli and maturity; and as littl°, or 
 no manure is used upon the prairie corn-fields, it is 
 evident the soil must naturally cjntain all those ele- 
 mentary constituents, in au available form, required 
 for a healthy and vigorous growth ot the plant. 

Analysis "a thousand times repeated," have prov- 
 ed beyond all question, that the asli of our cultiva- 
 ted plants contain in appreciable quantities some ten 
 or eleven earthy ingredients. That these earthy 
 salts; composing'the ash, can only be obtained from 
 the soil in which tlie plants grew, is a self-evident 
 fact; for it has been satisfactorily ascertained, that a 
 soil absolutely destitute of some two or three of tliese 
 important inorganic bodies is incapable of growing 
 corn, grain, &e., in perfection. A soil wanting these 
 cannot yield seed capable of reproducing its kind. 

In accordance with the above expressed views, 
 Professor Johnson says, ''a soil to be fertile, must 
 contain all the substances which the plant we desire 
 to grow can only obtain from the soil, and in such an 
 abundance as readily to supply all its wants; while 
 at the same time, it must contain nothing hurtful to 
 vegetable life." 

That the Ohio and prairie soils spoken of in this 
 paper arc vastly more productive than most of our 
 New England soils, is a universally conceded fact, 
 and the cause of this exuber.ant fertility has general- 
 ly been supposed to bo mainly due to their contain- 
 ing a, much larger per centage of lime, potash, soda, 
 &o., than the soils of the North. But carefully con- 
 ducted analyses of the soil of the Scioto valley do 
 not seem to justify such an assumption. In 1851, 
 Mr. David A. Wells, of Cambridge, Mass., a compe- 
 tent chemist and analyst, was employed by the Board 
 of Agriculture of Ohio, in "examining, analyzing, 
 and reporting on the nature and composition of the 
 soils of that State." In the July No., 1852, of SiUi- 
 man's Journal of Science and Arts, Mr. Wells has 
 furnished a paper on the ''Soil of the Scioto Valley, 
 Ohio," in which he says, "Dr. Dana, of Lowell, in 
 the course of many years exporince, has collected 
 and preserved the results of more than four hundred 
 analyses of soils, from the northern portion of this 
 country. The analyses of the soils I have made from 
 Ohio, and the analyses of all the soils resulting from 
 the drift agency, do not differ maUrially, so far as re- 
 gards their inorganic constituents. That is to say, 
 the soils of the Ohio, yielding with little or no cul- 
 ture from seventy to eighty bushels of corn to the 
 acre, are no belter, so far as their mineral composition 
 is oonoerned, than many of the Massachusetts soils 
 ■which have a reputation for sterility. Slight differ- 
 ences it is true, exist, but not to such an extent as 
 might be supposed from contrasting the relative pro- 
 ducts of the different soils. In what then is there a 
 reason for their difference in value to be found ? It 
 cannot be in the attributes in which they agree — 
 which are their mineral constituents, but in the attri- 
 • butes in which they differ: and these are the amount 
 and condition of the organic matter contained in the 
 soils, and the fineness of their elementary partieles." 
 "The first and perhaps most interesting fact no- 
 ticed in the examination of these soils was the re- 
 markable degree of fineness of their constituent par- 
 ticles. In this respect I venture to assert that they 
 are not surpassed by any other alluvial deposits upon 

the surface of the earth, some of the soils being lit- 
 tle else than inpalpable powders." 

From the remarks of Mr. Wells, in connection with 
 many other well known facts, we are of tlie opinion 
 that the fertility of a soil depends more upon the 
 fineness and commingled >tate in which its elemen- 
 tary particles exist, than hag generally been suppos- 
 ed, and we propose in a future number to refer to 
 some of the facts having a direct bearing upon the 
 subject. I,, u.

Ice Houses. 

Messrs. Editors: — I want to construct immediate- 
 ly a small ice fixture in my cellar for family use. My 
 cellar is 44 by 40 feet, and 8 feet high; the wall is 
 split granite, with a plank floor; it is pretty dry. I 
 would prefer placing it in the north corner. Here is 
 my plan: 

I wjuld Srst line off upon the cellar corner floor 
 8i feet square ; within this space stud up a room G 
 feet 2 inches, with 4 inch joist, and board up upon 
 the inside. This room is then feet square and 8 
 high, which is to receive the ice; pitch this room all 
 around upon the outside to keep moisture from get- 
 ting in or out, then board up upcm the studs, which 
 leaves a 4 inch space all round betwen the studs; 
 then stud up again on two sides, and plank up, the 
 other two being formed by the stone wall, 15 inches 
 from the- inner studding. This 16 inches of space 
 all round to be filled with dry saw-dust, (perhaps 
 wet saw-dust would do as well. 

For convenient ingress to this fixture, T propose to 
 fit in, near the bottom, a box or case about 7 feet long, 
 1 foot deep, and 2 wide, to extend from the outside 
 through the ice room; the ice is to be lowered in from 
 the top and packed in and around this pitched case, 
 which has double doors lined with cloth; in this case 
 is to be a provision chest to move in and out easily 
 upon rollers; this chest is to be in separate apart- 
 ments, for the reception of fruit, butter, meats, &c. 
 But instead of this horizontal case and chest, I could 
 insert them in a vertical position under the hatch- 
 way at less expense, although it would be more in- 
 convenient in getting the chest in and out; then again 
 I should not have so compact a body of ice. 

What do you think of it? Will it answer? Is 
 the horizontal or the vertical way best? Am I 
 right in leaving 4 inches air space ? Should the 
 saw-dust be wet or liry ? Will moving the provision 
 chest in and out once or twice a day meltaway the 
 ice too fast ? C. J. F. 

. North Lincoln, Me., 1853. 

This plan of an ice house we consider an excellent 
 one; the saw-dust should be dry. The air sp.ace is a 
 good idea, and we would prefer the horizontal draw- 
 er. There diould be some allowance below for drain- 
 age. — [Scientific American. 

To Prevent Putrid Fermentation of Urine. — 
 A foreign chemical journal states that by mixing 
 muriatic acid with urine, it can be kept a long time 
 without acquiring a bad order. It is ^aid: — In the 
 mouth of September, 1851, a quantity of urine was 
 mixed with muriatic acid, and exposed to the influen- 
 ce of the air and rain for nearly a year. The urine 
 during that period, did not change its condition, and 
 in the year 1852, during a very dry period, it entire- 
 ly dried up, and formed and oderloss salt.
