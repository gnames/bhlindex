SUBSTITUTE FOR GUANO— HORSE TRADE IN NEW YORK.

Substitute for Guano. 

A reward of £1600 sterling was offered some time 
 since, by the Royal Agricultural Society of England, 
 for a merchantable article which shall possess the 
 fertilizing properties of Peruvian Guano, provided, 
 that it be sold at the rate of £5 per ton. Edwin 
 Pettit, of London, claims, as we observe by recent 
 arrivals, to have discovered the desideratum, which 
 he calls 'Fish Guano.' He, hovrever, declines to ap- 
 ply for the premium, and says: "Would it be a prize 
 to me to receive £1000, on condition that I sell an 
 article at £5, when its ascertained market value is 
 £9 per ton ? Give me a fleet of fishing boats, and I 
 will make as much Guano in twenty-four hours, as 
 the Myriads of Peruvian birds will make in a year, 
 of as good a quality, and much lower price." The 
 consumption of Guano in Great Britain ranges from 
 190,000 to 200,000 tons per annum, which will give 
 an idea of the importance of the subject to the ag- 
 ricultural interests there. 

New sources of supply are being sought for, and 
 it is announced that a new discovery on the East 
 Coast of Africa has just been made, which it is said 
 will afford a "twenty years supply." Guanoes have 
 also recently been discovered in the Indian ocean, but 
 on analysis do not prove equal to the Peruvian, and 
 therefore will not come into direct competition, re- 
 sembling more those of Patagonia or Saldanha Bay. 

Professor Way's analysis of the different Guanoes, 
 resulted as follows:

 Ichaboe, C

The Patagonian Guanoes, although deficient in 
 ammonia, contains a large per centage of P losphate 
 of Lime, whica makes them valuable in England for 
 their great crop, that of the Turnip. The Guano 
 from the Indian ocean, will be valued for the same 
 reason, and as the Editor of the Chronicle remarks, 
 "will probably cheapen Phosphate of Lime more 
 than ammonia." 

He says, also, "active measures are being taken to 
 secure this produce of the newly discovered Islands, 
 fortheuseof the British farmer." This might be 
 imagined very readily, and we imagine also the dis- 
 covery will be made as quickly by the English au- 
 ihorilieStthut these new doposites are so many leagues 
 distant from the coast of any other government, as 
 to give them the first discoverers, undisputed juris- 
 diction, and exclude all other nations. 

Horse Trade in New York. 

There is probably stable room enough for fifttoen 
 hundred horses on four blocks, between Second and 
 Lflsington Avenues and Twenty-third and Twenty- 
 fifth streets. The old Bull's Head stables have been 
 enlarged until they cover a space from Twenty- fourth 
 to Twenty-fifth streets, GO by 200 feet, with an ad- 
 dition 22 by 100 feet, witli room for 200 horses and 
 are often full. We have never found less than 125 
 in the stables at anyone of our visits. The building 
 is one-story, with lofts for hay and grain, ami while 
 opju during the day is well ventillated, but not 
 sufficiently so at night, and this is the case with all 
 in the street, and thouj^h kept clean as possible, no 
 .absorbent of ammonia is used, and hence, as we think, 
 comes the tioublesome opthalraic disease, called the 
 "pink eye," so prevalent at times in this street, a- 
 mong horses fresh from the country. A free use of 
 plaster would add much to the health of horses, if it 
 did not entirely prevent that disease. 
 • The stables owned by Northup & Post; nearly op- 
 posite the above, are five in number, forming a hand- 
 some two-story brick edifice, 80 by 130 feet, with 
 room below and above for 230 horses. We are told 
 that the rent of these stables is worth $2,000 a yoaw 
 Mr. Northup is one of the oldest dealers in the sti'ect. 
 He tells us he was there eighteen years ago, when 
 there were very few buildings about the neighbor- 
 hood, and that he continued to visit the street occa- 
 sionally several years afterward, with a few horses, 
 and thinks that perhaps one might have been sold 
 then to one hundred now, and that prices did not av- 
 erage half what they have this year. The quality of 
 horses, too, was quite inferior to the present stock. 

Although these two are the largest separate sta- 
 bles in the street, Macauly can put up more horses 
 than either. His several stables occupy nine lots, 25 
 by 100, and bold 300 horses. The average number 
 on band is about 170. There are 15 othe:' stables in 
 the street, which hold from 5 to 75 each. We found 
 on one occasion 998 horses for sale, besides private 
 and livery horses, in this sliort portion of one street. 

Averaging the sales at 450 per week, atSloO each, 
 which is below the mark estimated by those in the 
 tra<le, and the amount will be §67,000 per week, or 
 iJ3, 510,000 per annum — a little item iu the comnier 
 cial transactions of this city, not entirely unworthy 
 of notice. 

We hope there are some of the croakers still liv- 
 ing, to read our remarks, who predicted the ruin of 
 farmers and destruction of their trade in cattle and 
 horses, when the far-off "outride barbarians" be^an 
 to send in their stock from the Holland Purchase and 
 AVestern Ptcserve to glut the market. Perhaps they 
 have heard also of Oiiio, Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, 
 Missouri, and Arkansas, and their boundless pas- 
 tures; perhaps they have not heard that notwithstan- 
 ding one constant stream of cattle and horses pour- 
 ing in from that great region of rich soil and cheap 
 land, the market is not yet glutted, .and prices never 
 rated so high before, as they have the present season.

Soap Suds for Watering Plants. 

Nathing can be hotter f r Summer watering of 
 plants and vines, than the suds of the weekly wash, 
 and no one who desires a good garden will suffer it 
 to be wasted. For cabbages, eueumners, beets, .and 
 the like, it seems especiall'' adapt'.'d, and one of the 
 most thrifty grape vines we cviu' saw, was watered 
 with soap suds almost daily in dry weather. A largo 
 supply is not needed at once, but frequent waterings 
 promote rapid and vigorous vegetation.
