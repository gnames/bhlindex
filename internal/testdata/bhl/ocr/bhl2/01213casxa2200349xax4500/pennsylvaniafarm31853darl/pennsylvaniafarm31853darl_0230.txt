OSAGE ORANGE HEDGING.

Osage Orange Heilgiug. 

In Illinois, from the scarcity of timber, Hedging 
 is a matter of absolute necessity, and experience 
 there for several years as well as in Ohio, seems to 
 have settled down in faror of the Osage Orange, as 
 having all the indispensable requisites for a hedge 
 plant, viz: sufficient hardiness, great durability and 
 vitality, vigor of growth, capacity to bear cutting 
 severely, with a tendency when headed down, to 
 pour forth numerons small branches, with myriads 
 of sharp elastic, and durable thorns: the whole to re- 
 main green, thoughly densely crowded. It is esti- 
 mated more than twenty-five millions of plants were 
 set out in Illinois, in 1853, and the demand not sup- 
 plied. It is also being very extensively planted in 
 Ohio. In our State, particularly in the Eastern 
 parts of it, fencing, including the first cost, labor of 
 putting up, and after a short time, continued atten- 
 tion to repairing, and then again renewal, forms a 
 heavy item in the annual expenses of the farm. The 
 Virginia Thorn, Cralcerpis Cordata, and the Honey 
 Locust, Glcditsdda Triacanthos, have both been tried 
 in our county, but are two slow in growing to give 
 satisfaction, and the former especially, too liable to be 
 broken into gaps. The loaves are also attacked by 
 an insect, and in many places the hedge has entirely 
 died out, after having grown to considerable size 
 We are inclined to believe the Osage Orange supplies 
 a desideratum long wanted here and which has been 
 now fully tested as regards hardiness and rapidity of 
 growth. 

We think it worthy the attention of the Pennsylva- 
 nia farmer, and introduce below an article, which we 
 believe first appeared in the Western Horticultural 
 Review, giving the method of management, in plant- 
 ing, trimming, &c., in the West. The cut shows the 
 appearance of the hedge one year after planting, with 
 Irom two to six shoots, and whi jh must be cut down 
 as described. 

"BiRECTiONS FOR PLANTING.— To prepare the ground 

where the future hedge is to be formed. For this 

purpose a strip must be marked out ten feet in width 

along the whole line where the hedge is to grow. 

This must be ploughed, throwing the earth out 

from tlio middle, then back-lurrowing also from the 
 centre. The ground to be carefully smoothed with 
 a harrow, that it may be freed from stones, lumps 
 and rubbish, before the planting begins. 

Having staked the line through, take a small cord, 
 some six or eight rods in length, mark it oif every 
 ten inches, and stretch it where you want the hedge. 
 Now run down a socket by each mark on tliis line, 
 then set the socket eight inches from the line oppo- 
 site the centre of each space, makilig two rows of 
 holes alternating thus: 

* * * * * * X- 

* « » * » 4(. 

into which insert the plants a little deeper than when 
 they came out of the ground, pressing the earth well 
 to the bottom of the hole around the roots. 

That the soil may adhere well to the roots, it will 
 be found advantageous to have the sprouts dipped in 
 thin mortar before planting. 

Having the plants cut down to within three inch- 
 es of the ground they may grow the first year with- 
 out further trimming. 

If in a healthy condition, the second season they 
 will require three trimmings as follows:— In the 
 Spring cut them down to within three inches of the 
 first cutting, when they again grow out, say two feet, 
 trim within five inches of the last cutting, and throw 
 the soil up with a plough, leaving the second crop of 
 shoots some six inches above the ground: repeat the 
 cutting when these last shoots have attained a length 
 of two feet. During the third Summer the plants 
 should undergo the same inexorable pruning, and the 
 fourth year will complete a fence that shall be a per- 
 fect barrier against man or beast. 

The process of cutting off half tJSjB top at first, and 
 annually shortening back so much of the thrifty 
 growth of a young hedge,beems to the novice,like un- 
 necessary cruelty to the plant, and a trial of one's 
 own patience. But it is the "inexorable must," in 
 hedge growing. Raising a hedge is like raising a 
 good name; if there is no no base or foundation for 
 the structure, it is very likely lo betray dreadful gaps 
 at the bottom before it is well established. 

In a hedge the great and all important point is to 
 make a broad and thick base. Once this is accom- 
 plished, the task is more than half over. The top 
 will grow into any shape desired. But no necroman- 
 cy, short of cutting the whole down again, will fill 
 up the base of a hedge that is lean and open at the 
 bottom. Hence the imperative necessity of cutting 
 down the shoots till the base becomes a perfect 
 thicket." 

A Ledge planted according to the foregoing direc- 
 tions will require 40 plants to the rod, or 12,800 to 
 the mile. 

The intelligent farmer need hardly be reminded 
 that, however explicit directions may be given, much 
 must be left in this case, as ia all others, to the nx-
