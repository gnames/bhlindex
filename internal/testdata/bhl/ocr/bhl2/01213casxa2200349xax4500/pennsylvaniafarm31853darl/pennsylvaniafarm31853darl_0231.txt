eroise of a discriminating judgment. If the liedge 
 grows slow and thin, it should not be cut so frequent- 
 ly, nor so closely, as if it were in a very thrifty and 
 luxuriant condition. 

Do not trim the plants too late in the soaion, there- 
 by exposing the tender shoots to the frost before they 
 are matured — -and those who roar the plants from the 
 seed will hnd some cave necessary to shield the young 
 plants in the beds from tho rigor of the Winter in 
 this latitude. 

While the hedge is small^it may be trimmed with a 
 scythe. When it shall have attained a larger growth 
 a corn knife, such as is used in cutting corn in the 
 field for fodder, will be found the cheapest and most 
 convenient instrument for pruning, and with which 
 a man may trim from 200 to 400 rods of hedge per 
 day. 

Tho socket used in setting the plants, is a cast- 
 iron ferrule, 14 inches long, 3 inches in diameter at 
 the larger end, into which is inserted a wooden han- 
 dle 2 feet in length, with a bracket upon which the" 
 foot is placed. 

Care should be taken that th j plants are healthy 
 and vigorous when put into the hedge row, as re- 
 plants seldom do .as well as the first settings. 

It is very essential that the soil should be cultiva- 
 ted 4 feet on each side of the hedge, and kept free 
 from weeds, as well as from being trampled, during 
 the first season, by stock. If the earth upon which 
 tho hedge is planted is poor and thin, it should be 
 properly manured. In a word, it should be constant- 
 ly borne in mind by the hedge grower, that the work 
 upon which he is engaged is not for a day or for a 
 year, but for all time, and that it is only by care and 
 attention that ant useful undertaking can be success" 
 fully prosecuted. 

^oilin^ Cattle.~New Rochelle Blackberry, &c. 

Copied from proceedings of New York Farmer's Club. 

The following letter from Frederick Prime, relative 
 to the origin of the large Blackberry of New Ro- 
 chelle was read : 

'I'o the President of (he Farmer's Club. 

Sir : — In a late number of the Westchester News, 
 published in this town, I have found an interesting 
 paper, read before your Society by Mr. Lawton, in 
 relation to a remarkable blackberry, which for s me 
 years has been known in this neighborhood. 

As the article gives only a general account of the 
 origin of this plant, I have supposed a more particu- 
 lar statement might be of interest to the Farmer's 
 Cub. 

About the year 1834 Lewis A. Seaoor, a carpenter, 
 then and now, residing in the village of New Ro- 
 chelle, in walking over a field, between my residence 
 and the Sound, discovered a blackberry of a remark- 
 able size, and having obtained permission to remove 
 some plants for cultivation, placed them in his gar- 
 den — about eighteen. 

After careful inquiry in this neighborhood, I am 
 satisfied that it is to Mr. Seaeor we owe the preserva- 
 tion of this remarkable and valuable fruit, and that 

all the plants now known had their origin from his. 

A relative of a former proprietor brought with him 
 from England, many years since, some shrubbery, 
 whence it has been supposed the blackberry in ques- 
 tion was introduced. This is a more conjecture, the 
 probability of which could be easily ascertained by 
 comparing this with the English varieties. The gen- 
 erally received opinion in this neighborhood is that 
 it is a seedling of native origin. 

I am informed by Mr. Seaoor that he has called it 
 the "mammoth blackberry," and has sold it under that 
 name. 

Should any new name be given, it appears to me 
 that of the "Seaeor mammoili blackberry," or the 
 "New llochclle Seaeor blackberry," would be but an 
 act of justice to the person who has preserved the 
 fruit, and might prove of advantage to him, as he 
 continues to raise them for sale. lie is a working 
 mechanic, and the few dollars he receives from the 
 sale of his plants are of importance to the comfort of 
 his family. 

The plants wore removed by Mr. Seaeor before I 
 purchased the property, and I regret that from my 
 ignorance of their existence the parent stocks were 
 de.stroyed in clearing the lot where tliey grew. 
 Yours truly, &c.,

Flowering of Plants. — Berghaus says that in the 
 middle latitudes of Europe and North America the 
 flowering takes place generally — fjur days later for 
 each degree of latitude towards the north. 

How was the earth originally clothed Aith plants? 
 Various hypothesis have been advanced. Linnscus 
 supposed tiiat at first there was only one primitive 
 centre of vegetation, from which plants are distribu- 
 ted over the glotje. Some, to save all trouble, sup- 
 pose that plants were produced at first in the locali- 
 ties were they are now seen growing. Others think 
 that each species of plant originated in, and was dif- 
 fused from, a single primitive centre, and that there 
 were numerous such centres situated in different 
 parts of the world — each centre being the seat of a 
 particular number of species. 

Dauberry s.ays that analogy favors the supposition 
 that each species of plant was originally formed in 
 some particular locality, from whence it spread itself 
 over a certain area gradually — like the origin of man 
 from Adam and Eve — that the spread of vegetation 
 still goes on as it began, from place to place, island 
 to island, itc. The remarkable limitation of certain 
 species to single spots on the globe seems to favor the 
 hypothesis of specific centres. Professor Forbes saj-s 
 that many plants peculiar to the Flora of the west of 
 Ireland have the nearest portion of their specific cen- 
 tres in the north-west of Spain. Others of the south- 
 west promontory of England are found in the chan- 
 nel islands, and in the opposite eciast of France. 
 The vegetation of the south-west of England is that 
 of the opposite continent. 

Watson and Forlies conclude that as England does 
 not contain more than one vegetable — that is the 
 Eriocaulon Septangulre — that is not found on the 
 coast ol Europe — England cannot be deemed a cen- 
 tre of vegetation.
