SOILING CATTLE— NEW BLACKBERRY. 

[October 

I he Chairman called up the question of the day' 
 viz: Soiling of Cattle, and the best plans for it. 

Thninm Bell, of Morrisania, who has had very 
 lon;^ and extensive experience in this business, vras 
 invited to give his opinion; and he said he had been 
 engai^ed in a.;ricultural pursuits, especially with cat- 
 tle, for thirty-five years. I was soiling cattle in Scot- 
 land wlieii I left it. I was supplying my cattle in 
 th it way the year round with grass, roots, &e. Much 
 depends upon the char.acter of the land we have to 
 deal with. On rocky, uneven, mountainous grounds, 
 wc are coni|,ielled to graze cattle. 

I have .soiled from one hundred to one hundred and 
 fifty head on four hundred acres, at Fordhani, near 
 this city. I set aside ten acres of the best land, 
 ploughed it not loss than eight inches deep. Others 
 may go deeper than that, and I shall approve it. I 
 sowed Indian corn on it broadcast. I had manured 
 it with twenty-five cart loads an acre of my barn-yard 
 manure in April, and when spread it covered the 
 whole surface. I ploughed it all in. That field had 
 produced a crop of potatoes the year before. I took 
 yellow northern corn and sowed four bushels of it 
 broadcast. On one acre, on the 1st of May, I sowed 
 it, in going three times over the field, up and down. 
 I then ploughed the field with my one-horse plough, 
 wliich I call my corn plough, about Jour inches deep. 
 I then run a light roller over the field. 

On the 10th of May I sowed one acre more in the 
 same way. On the 20th of May another acre in the 
 same style. On the 30th of May another — -that made 
 Jour sowings of corn in May. 

On the 10th of June one acre more in the same 
 way, and an acre each in the same style on the 20th 
 and 30th of June. 

On the 10th, 20th and 30th of July each an acre 
 in the same way. 

On the 15th of July I commenced with the first of 
 May acre, on which the corn averaged about four 
 feet high, and in silk. I cut daily all that was want- 
 ed by my cattle, (one hundred of them,) and it last- 
 ed till the loth of August. I gave meal along with 
 the corn stalks. The soiling yard was about an acre 
 in size. The cattle had free access to pure whole- 
 some water just as much as they pleased. They went 
 in and out of the adjoining stables, and that exercise 
 seemed to be as much as they wanted, for they were 
 perfectly healthy. 

From the 15th of August to the 25th the corn cut 
 was of a str.nger growth than the first. My hun- 
 dred head were kept three months in this way. 1 
 saved much in the article of manure. If I had made 
 tanks to save all the urine of my cattle I should have 
 made more profit. This way of soiling renders inte- 
 rior fences unnecessary on a fiirm, and it is a large 
 expense saved. On our farms in England we sprinkle 
 the manure over the growing crop with a tin sprink- 
 ler, like those with which we here water the streets. 
 That would not answer in a dry time— it would prove 
 too strong for the crop. I can get as much milk by 
 pasturing as by soiling. The corn feed made tte 
 richest milk, and some say the richest butter. 

I sent daily to market from one thousand quarts to 
 twelve hundred quarts of milk. Sometimes my num- 
 ber of caws was one hundred and fifty. The old 
 Shakeress cow is still alive; she is about eighteen 
 years. You have heard mo say how 1 came by her. 
 I repeat it. One day I met with a Shaking Quaker 
 from Lebanon, who said to me : "Friend Bell, do'st 
 thee want a good cow?" I said, "yrs." "Widl," 
 says the Shaker, "1 have a good one for thee, if thou 
 wilt give rae sixty dollars for her." "That's a high 
 price," said I. "Well," replied the Shaker, "she 

will give thee a bushel of milk a day," (thirty-two 
 quarts.) I gave sixty dollars and took t e Shake- 
 ress, who sometimes gave me thirty-two quarts a 
 day, and the average for a whole year fifteen quarts 
 a day. She paid me well. I had another, which 
 some of the members present saw on my farm — one 
 I called the Old Judge. She was American with a 
 cross of the Devon. She never gave me more than 
 thirty quarts a day, but she gave it longer. My ex- 
 perience has been profitalde. 

Projessor 3[apes. Our valued friend Mr. Bell has 
 occupied nearly all the ground. I give — as I am re- 
 quested to do so — my experience in soiling. I have 
 confined my cows in a clean stable — fastened to a 
 pole and cut their feed for them. I was told they 
 would suffer for want of exercise. I have not found 
 that to be true. It is true that their flesh and yield 
 of milk are both diminished by much exercise: Cat- 
 tle are less exposed to accidents than when pastured; 
 so are they protected from storms, the calves are bet- 
 ter taken care of, their manure — especially the fluid 
 portion, is all saved — it should be mixed with muck 
 and other solid manures, while yet warm, when it 
 has not lost by chemical change — far better than 
 pumping it out of the cistern after a week. We add 
 to the manure all the wash of the house. When the 
 manure is not sufficiently wet we pump water upon 
 it. When the urine is put on warm from the cattle 
 it decomposes ten times as much muck as it does when 
 cold. Great labor is saved in soiling. I have found 
 much advantage in using liquid manure. OnOnooc- 
 casion I saveu a pea crop by it — it is well to throw 
 in a little diluted sulphuric acid. My manure is in 
 little danger of fire fanging. My cattle are more 
 protected trom flies in the stall. They are kept cool- 
 er in summer than in winter. The cows give more 
 milk, and they keep better health than cows in pas- 
 ture. In the pasture they get but one sort of food — 
 in soiling a variety, which, if judiciously served to 
 them, is more agreeable and useful. AVhen they are 
 scouring from too much green food I give them car- 
 i-ots, the peptic acid of wlucli invariably cures them, 
 and gives them aid in digestion. I give, among oth- 
 er roots, the Vienna Cauli-Rapa, (cabbage turnip,) 
 which is very superior. Vilmorin has introduced a 
 hybrid of the turnip and the cauliflower. For green 
 I fo.jd, in the season for it, our Indian corn is excellent, 
 I as shown by Mr. Bell. 1 prefer Stowell's evergreen 
 I corn to any other for that purpose. It grows larger, 
 the stalk is almost as sweet as sugar cane, the joints 
 . (which in other Indian corn are hard) are in this corn 
 quite tender, a man can eat it, and it gives a double 
 quantity on an acre. The juice of it has been tried, 
 and is up to eleven degrees Beauraais — equal to the 
 .juice of Santa Cruz cane. 

I Soiling saves interior fencing, and it is a great sav- 
 '• ing when not only the cost of the fewer repairs are 
 { stated, but of the ground on both sides of the fences 
 which cannot be cultivated for some distance from 
 the fences. The stables, in soiling, must be kept, 
 clean and well ventilated, of course — or the cattle 
 must be turned out for exercise in time. I have no 
 occasion to turn them out. I have mentioned the 
 carrot; it has a value far beyond that of a mere food, 
 it contains peptic acid of excellent use in digestion. 
 It is now used in making jellies: it is a coio doctor^- 
 and always cures. One bushel of oats, and another 
 of carrots, are fully equal in value to two bushels of 
 oats. The excretia of the cattle fed with carrots do 
 not contain that undigested oats, corn or hay or what 
 else; they almost resemble those of a healthy man. 
 I have found the strap-leaved red top turnips good in 
 soiling— it can be profitably raised, planted at any
