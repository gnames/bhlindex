time, stand out the winter — ^et iiitliy before sprinr;. 
 Rutabagas stand out in winter, do mucli good to the 
 soil as a mulcb. In spriu'^ I pass a roller over them 
 all to erush theui, and then plou;;h them in — little 
 additional expense. Mr. Campbell cooks the feed 
 and gains by it. I cut my Stowell ever green corn 
 stalks — put them in a vessel with a little salt, pour 
 hot water on them, cover tliem up with a cloth, and 
 when cool they make a very acceptable food. 

Judge Van Wyclc.^Oa small farms, near large cit- 
 ies, it may lie cheape.st, even in our country, to soil 
 our cattle. Such farms rai'ely have much stock on 
 them; they want their land generally, or most of it, 
 for garden vegetables, fruit, poultry, &c. — to raise 
 feed for the last, as well as their other animals. On 
 large farms of from 200 to 41)0 or 50 J acres, situated 
 in the interior, some distance from the market, it ap- 
 pears to me it would be more prolitable and conveni- 
 ent for farmers to graze their 'stock, as well that 
 which the3' require for the dairy, as for fattening and 
 working. As lar as my expi^rience and information 
 goes, the cost of labor in such a system would not lie 
 more than one-fourth or one-hfth of what it would be 
 in soiling. The raising of crops in succe.'^sion on dis- 
 tant lots of a large farm, whether the corn plant, or 
 any other, and carrying and distributing it for feed- 
 ing would cost us three tinier as much, and probably 
 more, than letting the animals run at large, choosing 
 their own feed, drink rutming water, and have ex- 
 ercise and pure air. This, it appears to nie, would 
 bo, more for the profit of the owner as well as the 
 health and thrift of his animals. Grazing farms as 
 well as any others must be well managed to do well; 
 this as reg.ards tillage of every kind, ploughing, hoe- 
 ing, clearing, manuring, and the use of the best 
 grasses, with frequent and judicious changes of feed- 
 ing grounds. Why soiling is so much more practis- 
 ed in Europe than here, is the dense pnpulaticm there, 
 and the scarcity of land; they want the latter to raise 
 food on for the former. Notwithstanding this, we 
 have it, from the best authorities, that in Holland, 
 possessing a small territory but a very dense popula- 
 tion, they graze their cattle, and especiallv their 
 cows, from April to November. Their dairy system 
 is generally allowed to be the best in Europe, and 
 this in quantity and quality of product, her butter 
 and cheese will command in any European market, 
 and at all times from ten to twenty per cent, more 
 than any other. Mr. Bell admits, that on nmgh hi - 
 ly farms, even near the city, H would be better to 
 graze cows as well as other stock, than to soil them, 
 whether the farms be large or small. Of course, on 
 large, hilly, uneven farms, located any distance, in 
 tlie interior, the inducements for grazing must be 
 much stronger. Mr. Bell gave Long Island and 
 some parts of New Jersey as proper specimens of sur- 
 face for soiling. No doubt localities in both these sec- 
 tions, and especially the former, might be made much 
 more productive than they are by the grazing system. 
 It is not only the adoption of the system, but it must 
 be properly preserved to succeed. Good tillage, high 
 manuring, proper keeping of the stock as regards 
 yards, feedmg, water, cleanliness, taking care of the 
 manure, — -this last constitutes ,a considerable portion 
 of the gain. Mr. Bell admitted, that his farm being 
 large, he grazed his cows a part of the season; he 
 spoke highly, though, of the advantages of soiling in 
 certain localities. 

i^i: Jiidd of the A;/riciilfor. According to the 

experience of a man in Holland, it seems thai soiling 
 was not so profitable .as is here stated. Stephen's 
 book on the farm says it is about as to land as two to 

one, but by Mr. Bell's experience it is makln"; ten 
 acres answer for fifty acres of grazing. 

Mr. Bell. — If you mean to say that the soiling was 
 with clover, you arc right, — but not with cin-n as I 
 use it. 

Mr. Jitild. — -It is said that twelve cows require one 
 man. 

Mr. Bell. — I found one tit man could take care of 
 twenty-hvo cows. 

Mr. Judd. — Men are expensive. One hundred dol- 
 lars paid to a man, will go further in hiring pasture 
 than in soiling. The making of manure depends 
 much on a man's location ; most farmers have no 
 muck at all, and little litter 

Prof. Miipes. — Where there is no muck there is 
 soil, and let that take the place of muck and absorb 
 all the extra fluid of the cattle. 

Mr. Judd. — The strongest point for pasture is the 
 cheapness of rent in most places. 

Prof. Mapes. — I pay near my farm — for pasture 
 thirty dollars an acre of land worth five hundred 
 dollars. It is but the interest of the value of the land. 
 ' Judge Van Wyck. — Knows land four miles from 
 New York which lets for two and a-half to five dol- 
 lars an acre per month. 

Mr. i?eW.— My interest paid on 400 acres was two 
 dollars an acre per iinnum. The o Tner of the land 
 did pretty well by it, and I did better still. Cattle 
 travel far in the pasture and lessen both their flesh 
 and their milk. On pasture, the difference of feed 
 is considerable. I found it amounted to one hun- 
 dred and fifty quarts less on some portions of the 
 pasture than others, in a day. 

Mr. LawUin presented to the club for refreshment, 
 a basket of his gi-eat blackberries, enough for all. 

Mr. Judd proposed as a next subject— "The top 
 dressing of crops." Seconded by Prof. Mapes, and 
 carried. 

The Club then adjourned to the first Toegday in 
 September, at noon.

Cutting Timber. 

If oak, hickory or chesnut timber is felled in the 
 Eighth mtmth, (August,) in the second running of 
 the sap, and barked, quite a large tree will season 
 perfectly, and even the twigs will remain sound for 
 years; vvhereas, that cut in Winter, and remaining 
 until next Fall, (as thick as your wrist,) will be com- 
 pletely sap-rotten and will be almost unfit for any 
 purpose. The body of the oak split into rails will 
 not Last more than ten or twelve years. Chesnut 
 will last longer, but no comparison to that cut in the 
 Eighth month. Hickory cut in the Eighth month is 
 not subject to be worm eaton, and will last a long 
 time for fencing. 

When I commenced farming in 1802, it was the 
 practice to cut timbi^r for post fencing in the Winter. 
 White-oak posts and black-oak rails, cut at that time, 
 I found would not last more than ten or twelve years. 
 In 1808, I commenced cutting fence timber in the 
 Eighth month. Many of the oak rails cut that year 
 are yet sound; as well as most of those formed of 
 chesnut. If the bark is not taken off this month, 
 however, it will peel off itself the socoml or third 
 year, and leave the sap perfectly sound. The tops of 
 the trees are also more valuable for fuel, than when 
 cut in Winter or Spring. 

I advise young farmers tJ try the expciriment for 
 themselves;"and if post fences will not last twice as 
 long, I firfc^it all my experience as worthless.— [New 
 Jersey Herald.
