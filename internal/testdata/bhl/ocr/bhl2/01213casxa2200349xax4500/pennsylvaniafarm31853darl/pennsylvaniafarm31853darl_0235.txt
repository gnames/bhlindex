there ia something to be gained from the labors of 
 men of science, who are not really engaged in farm- 
 ing, but who have studied the theory of farming, as 
 well as the common surveyor, who iinds their land- 
 marks by a science, that does not require that he 
 should be a, practical farmer to do so. 

But to my point. I have spent five days in look- 
 ing at the Crystal Palace and its contents. I wish 
 every farmer in Chester county could see and have 
 time to examine the agricultural department of the 
 exhibition. The United States is the only nation 
 represented to an extent worthy of notice in this de- 
 partment. And she is well represented in all the 
 articles for farming purposes, many of which ou«i)«r- 
 dinary farmers never thought of. The bu iness of 
 plowing, sowing, cradling, and mowing all done by 
 horse power, and by almost every variety of ma- 
 chines. 

I shall not attempt a very definite description of 
 of any of th',se machines, implements, &o.,as I could 
 not do it without drawings, and even then no one 
 can get as good an idea of them by any plan as that 
 cf seeing the oriyiual. 

Amongst a very large assortment of plows, I no- 
 ticed several, different kinds of subsoil plows. Some 
 of them consisted of an ordinary beam, and handles, 
 but a very lung, or rather of a very deep set of irons, 
 that they might do their work deep in the ground, in 
 the bottom ot the ordiaary furrow. But an improv- 
 ed subsoil plow had two plows attached to one beam, 
 the foremost over ihe smaller, to take off the top fur- 
 row and throw it in the deep furrow left by the hind- 
 most and deep running plow the last 'round;' and the 
 hindmost one following immediately after to do the 
 subsoiling. Such a phiw is generally drawn by two 
 yoke of oxen, and they leave the ground thoroughly 
 broken up, to a much greater depth than by the usual 
 method of farming. 

In conversing with several gentlemen on the ad- 
 T.uUages of subsoiling, I found as much difference ot 
 opinion as there ia difference in the natural quality 
 of the land they farmed; this will always be the case, 
 until farmers study the character of these differen- 
 ces of soil, and anticipate different results. Per- 
 haps I shall have something to say to you on this sub- 
 ject across the ocean. 

There are quite a number of threshing machines 
 on exhibition with the "concave" above the cylinder, 
 so that the grain goes in over the cylinder instead of 
 under it. 

Several important improvements, or at least chang. 
 es are made in threshing machines on exhibition, and 
 a \V. K. P.ilmer exhibits an American Seed and 
 Grain Thresher, by which the grain is cleaned and 
 run into bags (and measured if desired,) at the same 
 time it is threshed. The peculiarity of the machine 
 is that instead of a cylinder it lias a central mass of 
 cast iron, somewhat like hub of a wagon wheel, and 

into the perphyory of this, round iron bars two and 
 a half feet long, are inserted, so as to stand out like 
 the spoke of a wheel. These are made to revolve 
 with great rapidity in a circular wooden box, in 
 which there is just room enough to admit the arms 
 to fly around. At one side of this circular box, is a 
 hole at which the grain is introduced, so that the 
 straw introduced end-ways meets the arms perpen- 
 diculjir to them, .and flies around with them in the 
 circular wheel, and goes out at the circumference, 
 immediately over where it went in, but in a tangent 
 to the wheel's motion. 

It is claimed that this machine will clean wheat of 
 all its smut, and thresh it much better with less la- 
 bor, when it is a little damp, than the ordinary ma- 
 chine. It is certainly an important change upon the 
 old machine, and as such is well worth tlie consider- 
 ation of farmers. It comes highly recommended by 
 those who have used it, for the above qualities, as 
 well as for its speed in threshing. 

Several kinds of fans for cleaning grain were 
 worthy of consideration. One with glass sides, 
 that enables us to see it in operation, appeared to be 
 a very good one. Another of peculiar construction, 
 separated very nicely timothy seed, clover seed, chaff', 
 wheat and cockle, at the same time; passing the 
 cockle and chaff together, but all the others in sepa- 
 rate places, and rendering each one clean. The ex- 
 hibitor informed mc that you intended publishing an 
 account of it in the Farm Journal, but that you could 
 not do it justice without a drawing. 

The machine bear^ the name of Salmon's Improv- 
 ed Grain and Gxass Separator. I send you his ad- 
 vertisement. 

There were also a good number of reaping and 
 mowing machines. One of the reaping machines 
 was very finely adapted for allowing four persons to 
 stand on it, and bind up the grain, as fast as it is cut. 

There was also hoes, rakes, harrows, cider mills, 
 hay knives, straw cutters, and a host of other things, 
 which your readers will agree with me, I have not 
 time to describe, when I inform them that I am on 
 ijoard a vessel bound to Hamburg, Germany, and a 
 pilot is now towing us down to the ocean, and I want 
 to send this scrawl back with him. 

I have nothad sufficient time to write the above care- 
 fully, and the vessel going out of the dock has not 
 hclpel me any, with its thumping about agaiust the 
 other vessels. So farewell tilll cross the Atlantic. 
 Yours with respect, E. P. 

The above communication is from ayoung man, a 
 practical no less than a well read scientific farmer of 
 Chester county, who goes to Europe to spend a few 
 years to improve himself in scientific knowledge,and 
 particularly in the department of Chemistry, as ap- 
 plied to agriculture, which is his favorite study. If 
 we are not much mistaken, from our knowledge of 
 his abilities, we think he is destined, should his life
