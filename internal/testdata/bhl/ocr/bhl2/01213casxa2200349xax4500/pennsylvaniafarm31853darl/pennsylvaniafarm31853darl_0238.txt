 the pads by means of a metallic bow, the ends of 
 whieh are rigid to stiffen the shoulder pads and sup- 
 port the tugs, while its arch is flat, tliiii, and flexible 
 in one direction to allow the pads to change th3ir 
 relative distance apart, and comparatively rigid in 
 the other direction to prevent the [lads from turning 
 with I'cspect to a plane parallel to the front of the 
 collar.

 sisting of a beam and casing, or their equivalents, in 
 one or more parts, with a cutting and scraping point, 
 hung on the shaft of a revolving wheel, with shovels

 opening or mouth of the head while the blast and 
 dust escape through the screen, the blast being gov- 
 erned by a slide, as set forth. 

Second, I claim the :xrrangeraont and construction 
 of the graduated sieve of unequal fineness, the por- 
 tion lieing protected from tlie action of the fan blast, 
 so that the small substances, such as cockle, &c., 
 passing through and falling on the bottom board of 
 the sieve, passing off at the trough and spouts, and 
 when the grain arrives at the coarser part of the 
 sieve, it passes through and is acted upon by the

 belt, having an adjustable r(dler, which, upon being 
 elevated ordepressed,causes the belts at the discharge 
 ends to be brought nearer together or separated furth-

 feed or convey to the cutter all the different articles 
 or substances which at present require each a sepaj 
 rate and distinct machine. 

Second, I claim, in combination with the two end- 
 less belts arranged as described, one or more cutters
