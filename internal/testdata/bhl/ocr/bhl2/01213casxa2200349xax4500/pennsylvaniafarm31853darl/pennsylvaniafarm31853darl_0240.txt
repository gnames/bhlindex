PRIZE ESSAY ON PIGS. 

[OCTOBEB 

pheric changes is well kown, ami has given rise to 
 the proverb, "that pigs can see the wind." 1 attribute 
 this circumstance to the extreme nervous eicitabili- 
 ty of the skin and mucus membrane, which makes 
 this animal feel any sudden atmospheric change 
 more acutely than the maiority of our domestic ani- 
 mals. This nervous excitability appears, from other 
 circumstances, to have an important bearing on their 
 economical treatment. 

The anatomy and physiology of an animal will 
 gener.ally aflbrd the observer an insight into its hab- 
 its and character, and we need but a slight glance 
 at the bead and face of the hog, as compared with 
 other animals, to convince the observer that strength 
 is one of the principal points had in view: in order 
 to render the snout better adapted to the purpose of 
 turning up roots for its food, an extra bone is added 
 to tlie nasal one. This is short and trificial, and 
 placed directly before the nasal bones, with which, 
 and with the edges of the anterior maxililiary, it is 
 connected by strong ligaments, cartilages, and mus- 
 cles. By it and its cartilaginous attachments the 
 snout is rendered strong as well as flexible, and the 
 whole is put into motion by a strong, short, thick 
 neck; the whole structure of the head and neck ad 
 mirably adapts them for the purpose of grubbing up 
 the soil while searching for such articles of food as 
 roots, worms, &c., which form their natural food: in 
 order, however, still better to perform that ofice, the 
 enout which terminates the face is strong and muscu- 
 lar, and at its extremity insensible. The position of 
 the orbit of the eye is lateral, giving to the animal a 
 side rather than a forward range of vision, and con- 
 seiiuently increased powers of perceiving such arti- 
 cles as acorns, cnesnuts, or other fruits, which may 
 have fallen near his track whilst grubbing up roots, 
 the presence of which his great olfactory sense also 
 makes known to him. The character of the teeth 
 and stomach of the hog shows that it is intended to 
 be an omniverous animal. It may be said that the 
 teeth are so formed in order to serve the purpose of 
 tearing and cutting tough fibrous roots which may 
 he in its way; and I believe that in the wild state, 
 except when pressed by hunger, the hog subsists al- 
 most wholly on vegetables. 

The hog has fourteen molar teeth in each jaw; six 
 ■incisors and two canines; the latter are curved up- 
 wards, and commonly called tushes. It is from tlie 
 stonnich that its omnivorous qualities are principal- 
 ly inferred, for which purpose it is well adapted by 
 its pyramidal appendage, glandular structure, and 
 the villous mucous membrane witli which it is lined. 

The Various Breeds of Pigs. 
 The wild boar is undoubtedly the animal from 
 ■which all our breeds of pigs have been derived, and 
 to which type the whole would speedily degenerate 
 were they again left to nature. Leaving out of view 
 that nearly extinct race the Irish greyhound breed, 
 the kind which approaches nearest to the original 
 stock are the large kinds which arc known as the 
 Old Hampshire, Berkshire, Lancashire, Suffolk, &c. 
 The modern breeds of Hampshire, Berkshire, Suffolk, 
 &o., are characterized by their short pricked ears, 
 whilst the older Lancashire, Yorkshire, Oheshire.&c, 
 have large flop ears — the old English hog:" both 
 kinds were originally covered with .strong bristles. 
 There are good grounds for supposing that the "old 
 English hog," with fl m ears, was originally the only 
 domestic animal of its kind througliout the kingdom. 
 When or how the short prick-eared Berkshire and 
 Hampshire hog became introduced I have always 
 been un-iblo to traoj: the probability is that it has 

been obtained by a cross with some of the more 
 Southern European breeds. The genuine old Eng- 
 lish breed was coarse boned, long in limb, narrow in 
 the back, and low shouldered, a form to which they 
 were most probably predisposed from the fact of hav- 
 ing to travel far and labour hard for their food, and 
 undergo considerable privations during the Winter; 
 notwithstanding those ill qualities, I have witnessed 
 in Lancashire, Yorkshire, and Cheshire, instances 
 where the old breed have, through the effects of bet- 
 ter care, shelter and food, produced a most valuable 
 animal, the thick flop ears having become fine and 
 thin, the bones of moderate size, the thick coat of 
 stiff bristles converted into afiner description, spread 
 more thinly on the animal, and tne skin become tine 
 and ruddy. I have seen this occur where there can 
 be scarcely a doubt that the animal was the aborigi- 
 nal one, and had never received a cross. Until with- 
 in a very recent period fine animals of this descrip- 
 tion were to be found pretty frequently, with the far- 
 mers in the counties named. They had several ad- 
 mirable qualities; amongst which were the facts that 
 they were exceedingly prolific and excellent mothers. 
 I have known a sow of this breed have 24 young 
 ones, often 20 and 22, though more commonly from 
 12 to 18. I have frequently known a sow of this 
 kind suckle 12 to 18; but the common practice when 
 the progeny was so numerous is to force the young 
 ones forward, and kill them as sucking pigs until 
 they are reduced in number to a bout a dozen. The old 
 sows of this breed have rarely more than 18 teats; 
 and it is not usual to see more than 10 to 18 sucking. 
 The only disadvantage of this breed is, that 
 they require a considerable amount of food without 
 making an adequate progress for the first 12 or 16 
 months; after which latter period, if put up in fair 
 store order, there is scarcely a breed that puts on 
 more flesh f<r the meat given to it than this breed, 
 and it increases to enormous weights, the hams, 
 when well cured, being of excellent quality. The 
 Berkshire hog was of large size, and is, I believe, 
 now almost extinct. Laurence, in his treatise on 
 Oattle in 1790, describes it as long and crooked in 
 the snout.the muzzle turning upwards; the ears large, 
 heavy, and inclined to be pendulous; the body long 
 and thick, but not deep;the legs short,the bone large, 
 and the size very great. This general description, 
 but partioul rly "the ears inclined to be pendulous," 
 shows that the celebrated Berkshires are derived from 
 a cross of the old indigenous breed. The large 
 Hampshire breed are characterized by somewhat sim- 
 ilar qualities: there is also a smaller and fiuer or im- 
 proved Hampshire breed, the resalt of a cross witb 
 either the Chinese or Neapolitan; the whole of wkichi 
 will be noticed when the mixed breeds are taken ia- 
 to consideration. I have introduced the Berkshire 
 and Hampshire breeds in noticing the larg r breed; 
 not that 1 believe either county possessed originally 
 any other breed than the large flop-eared; 1 have 
 djne so more in deference to common opinion, which 
 usually gives that breed a distinct and original 
 character. It will afterwards be shown, however, 
 that the character of the improved Berkshire may 
 be obtained by a cross between the indigenous large 
 breed, and one or other of the smaller ones. 0. the 
 smaller breeds there are only two that require any 
 lengthened notice — the Chinese and the Neapolitan. 
 Crosses of one or both of these breeds with "the old 
 English" have produced all our improved varieties of 
 the larger kinds. 

The Chinese hog was first introduced for the pur- 
 pose of improving our native breeds. There are two 
 varieties, the black and white; both fatten readily.
