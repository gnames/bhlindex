PRIZE ESSAY ON PIGS.

breed; and I have little doubt but if I had been so 
 Gircumstaneed as to have been able to have matched 
 them with their like, that the, race could have been 
 perpetuated. 

Ill consequence of having to remove, I was com- 
 pelled to dispose of the bows and their progeny pre- 
 viously alluded to, reserving only one sow, wliich at 
 an early period showed all the most desirable charac- 
 teristics of a good pig; her general form was some- 
 what similar to the sire (Neapolitan,) but with fuller 
 checks, not quite so so long but equally tine snout; it 
 was a pig that, had it been exhibited at an agricul- 
 tural meeting, would have been classed as an im- 
 proved Essex pig: in fact, I never saw one of the lat- 
 ter breed that possessed points superior to her. My 
 removal was to Ireland, where I was under the neces- 
 sity in due season to put her to a rough boar in that 
 country; the boar in question was a black one, and 
 possessed too much of the old rough species; but I 
 had no choice, — she produced a litter of six young 
 ones, one white, which turned out similar in form to 
 the imp.oved Berkshire, two were of the red-haired 
 description alre;idy noticed, and three were black, 
 one somewhat similar to the sire, two like the moth- 
 er were made presents of, and were remarkable for 
 keeping in good condition on a small amount of food; 
 their progeuy was of a larger description, having 
 been put to boars of a large breed. This cross was 
 much noticed lor their early maturity; they proved 
 a valuable lot, fattening to 14 stones weight of 14 lbs. 
 the stone within 12 months. I had a second litter 
 from the same sow and a like coarse boar; the litter 
 consisted this time of 9 pigs, 4 were red and striped, 
 but of a deeper colour than any I had had previous- 
 ly, in fiict approaching to deep brown, and the stripes 
 were, to superficial observation, black; four were 
 black, viz: two like the mother and two of a coarser 
 make; one was white; the white one was similar to 
 the best type of the improved Berkshire, attained a 
 large size with ordinary food within 12 months; the 
 reddish-brown ones did not fatten so rapidly, nor at- 
 tain so large a size as the preceding, but they would 
 have "gone on" at the time they were killed; the 
 coarser black ones were fed two months longer than 
 the others, but wheij killed did not attain many 
 pounds more weight than the white pig of the same 
 litter; the two that resembled the mother were fat at 
 nine months; all were fed alike, viz: boiled potatoes, 
 afterwards mixed with a little bran, and finished off 
 with ground oats and potatoes; after being taken from 
 the mother they were allowed to run on ^ pasture 
 (being ringed,) and otherwise only sparingly fed. 
 under these circumstances the two black ones that 
 resembled their mother throve the best — in fact, be- 
 came half fat; the white pig also did well; the two 
 coarse black ones grew in size and bone, as also did 
 the four brownish-red ones, but put on no meat un- 
 til they were put up to feed; when put up, the brown- 
 ish red ones gave the earliest appearance of doing 
 well. I always considered that this single litter was 
 typical of the qualities of the various breeds of pigs, 
 with the exception of the large flop-eared variety. 
 After the second litter was reared, the sow was sent 
 over to England and put to a boar, as near akin to 
 herself in appearance and breed as could be obtain- 
 ed; luckily, it was one th.at precisely resembled her- 
 self both in colour, symmetry, relative size, and sim- 
 ilai-ly bred, having been got by a Neapolitan boar 
 out of a Chinese and Berkshire sow; the progeny, 
 nine in number, were all black, and completely re- 
 sembled their sire and dam; all that were kept for 
 fattening were killed in intermediate stages, from 
 porkers until they were ten months old, after which 

age it was conceived more profitable to rear young 
 ones on the same amount of food that it took to in- 
 crease the weight of those which had reached that 
 age, at which time they would weigh ten to twelve 
 stones — they were excellent, whether as fresh pork 
 or pickled, ham or bacon. Three more litters were 
 had from the same sow by boars of like character, 
 the progeny in every instance resembling the parents. 
 Several sows and males were reared and disposed of 
 for breeding, whose progeny were of similar habits 
 and form, and had a like tendency to fatten early on 
 a small amount of food. In the few cases that fell 
 under my observation where they were again cross- 
 ed, the majority of the litter proved like the parent, 
 and in only one or two inst.ances did I witness the 
 appearance of the red-haired kind already alluded to. 
 There was one fact in connection with that sow to 
 notice, viz: that she was particularly careful in ma- 
 king her bed: as she approached the time of farrow- 
 ing she would coUe't a pile three or four feet high, 
 into which she would cover herself along with her 
 progeny after farrowing, particularly if it was cold 
 weather; her sense of smell was astonishingly acute. 
 I mention these facts, as I have observed a like ten- 
 dency amongst the pure Neapolitan, and I attribute 
 them to the circumstance that this breed approaches 
 the wild species of hog more than any other of the 
 cultivated kinds — a circumstance by no means im- 
 probable, seeing that the mild character of the Italian 
 climate would admit this thin-skinned, hairless va- 
 riety to roam at large without other shelter than the 
 woods, and l ther food than the acorns, chesnuts, and 
 roots, &c., with which that country abounds: it is to 
 this conjunction of favorable circumstances that I 
 attribute the smooth, hairless skin, propensity to fat- 
 ten, strong family resembhxnce and habits, transmitt- 
 ed through many generations until at length they 
 are so strongly marked, that these qualities become 
 intermixed with and transmitted to their descendants 
 when crossed with other blood. From the fact of 
 this breed (the Neapolitan,) maturing on a small 
 amount of food, it is less likely to deteriorate from a 
 Sufficient supply beig withheld than any other breed; 
 moderate warmth is, however, indispensable, for if 
 it is starved both for want of shelter and food, no 
 race deteriorates more rapidly. The Rudgwick 
 breed, which has been known for ages on the borders 
 of the Surrey and Sussex, have frequeutly been cele- 
 brated for the astonishing size which some of this 
 description have attained; they, however, require to 
 be 18 months to 2 years old before they are fattened; 
 they belong to the old English breel. 

Steam Power on Farms, 

The Marquis of Tweedale has succeeded perfectly 
 in working plows by steam power. The disiinguish- 
 ed English agriculturist, Mr. Meche, in a late article 
 says: — "There can be no doubt but that very shortly 
 every agriculturist must use steam power if he is to 
 stand his ground in the race of agricultural compe- 
 tition. The want of it is already felt if not seen, by 
 those who have not the means or inclination to use 
 it. The time is approaching when a steam engine 
 on a farm will be as common as the drill or thresh- 
 ing machine, although like them, it has to pass 
 through the ordeal of disbelfef, doubt and prejudice. 
 A committee of the Royal Agricultural Society give 
 the most extraordinary accounts of the rapid intro 
 duction of farm locomotive engines during the last 
 three years. — [Scientific American.
