 riculture, is taken from the columns of the Cleveland 
 Diily Ilorald, and is the best and most impartial we 
 have seen of thi.s interesting exhibition. 

The ssoond Annual Exhibition of Roapera and 
 Movvors, under the au.spioes of the Ohio State Board 
 of Agi-iculture, to ik pl.ioe at Wooster, on Wednes- 
 day. Col. iMe lary. President of the Board; Hon. J. 
 Q. Gost, Secretary; and nearly all the members of 
 tiie State Board wore prese t. A respectable num- 
 ber of the must intelligont and enterprising agricul- 
 turists from various portions of Ohio were in atten- 
 dance, and several Inventors and Manufaoturers of 
 of Agricultural Implements from abroad. The oc- 
 easiou was one of marked interest; the weather was 
 fine, and everything was conducted witli fairness, 
 wood feeling, and gentlemanly deportment. It is to 
 ba regretted that a much larger number of farmers 
 (3id nor, embrace the opportunity to witness the test 
 of the labor saving machines, but the exceedingly 
 busy season of the year and scarcity of lield labor- 
 ers prevented many from attending. The Reapers 
 and Mowers were all put to a practical test in diifer- 
 eut qualities of Wheat and Grass, each cutting an 
 acre in the S;iveral fields, thus affording a line oppor- 
 tunity to witness their operation and judge of their 
 oomparative merits. 

Five Reapers and four Mowers were entered, the 
 first prize being a Gold Medal of the value of $50. 
 On Wednesday the exhibition took place on the splen- 
 did farm of Mr. Stibbs, immediately adjoining the 
 town of Wooster. The farm of 224 acres is most 
 beautifully located on a gentle elevation overlooking 
 the town aid rich country adjacent, and is in a high 
 state of cultivation, 3Ir. S. being not only a practi- 
 ©al but a model farmer. His wheat, very he ivy, was 
 consideralily lodjed, and put the Reaping Machines 
 to a hard test. They all cut the grain well, but none 
 of them laid the gavels or sheaves as even as desir- 
 ftble. Even the lodged and tangled grain was pretty 
 well cut, quite as well as conld have been dime with 
 the common cradle, but in laying off by hand as well 
 OS by the Self-Rakers, the straw was a good deal 
 scattered, and required close gleaning to prevent 
 waste. The labor in binding, however, was no great- 
 er, if as great, as following the cradle. The man 
 managing the Reapers appeared considerably exci- 
 ted, most of t'le horses unused tt) the machines, and 
 in the hurry to out an acre in the shortest time, the 
 work was more slovenly performed than might have 
 been done under more f^ivorable circumstances. The 
 acres were cut in from 37 to 42 minutes each, but 
 the trial on the whole was not very satisfactory to 
 {he Judges and Farmers present. 

The meadow of Mr. Stibbs was mainly timothy 
 grass of the first season's mowing, very tall and 
 heavy, and affording a fine field f}r the Mowing Ma- 
 ehine, to operatft in. Ketchum's Patent hd off, and 
 etit its acre well in 42 minutes. It worked without 
 elogain ', cut the grass clean and sufficiently close, 
 and left it evenly spread so as to require no turning 
 t> cure perfectly. The Mower is compact and strong. 
 ftnd weighs about 750 pounds. The strength of the 
 machine w.as put to a severe test in the meadow of 
 Mr. S. It was drawn by a herculean span of hors- 
 es on a rapid walk, and when in full motion the 
 fingers protecting the knives struck the point of a 
 i-ock, solid in the ground, with such force as to' sud- 
 denly stop the team and hold them on the second 

pull. Two of the fingers were slightly bent, but not 
 enough to prevent the continued use of the Mower. 
 In another instance the top of a stomp in the way 
 of the machine was literally cut oflT without injury 
 to th>' knives. Manufactured at Buffalo; price $110. 

Mannv's Patent Mower cut the second acre in 49 
 minutes. His machine is an adjustable Reaper and 
 Mower, and took the first premium of §50 for mow- 
 ing at the great trial at Geneva, N. Y., last season. 
 It is a simple and efficient machine, cutting the grass 
 as well as the scythe, and leaving it in a good con- 
 dition to cure. Like Ketchum's it works in all kinds 
 of grass, and with two horses and one person will 
 cut from ten to fifteen acres per day. Manny's ma- 
 chine is .said to be the only successful combination 
 of Reaper and Mower, but the test at Wooster did 
 not show the adjustalde machine to be equal to some 
 single Reapers and Mowers. As a combined ma- 
 chine for farmers who are not able to purchase a 
 Reaper and Mower both, it is just the thing. Man- 
 ufactured at Freeport, Illinois; price !|125. 

Castle's Patent Mower was next tested, and for the 
 first few minutes worked beautifully. It out evenly, 
 close, and rapidly, but soon clogged and began to 
 slip over. The knives clip together like shears, and 
 seem likely to gum up and spring apart. It is an 
 ingenious, simple geared, light Mower, and is said 
 to work well on the plains about Urbana, the place 
 of manufacture. The machine was taken from the 
 ground before cutting its acre. The Mower of Al- 
 len, Mintier & Co., was tested for a few moments and 
 withdrawn, owing to some defect. 

Thursday morning the Mowing was resumed on 
 the grand farm of Mr. Robinson, consisting of 480 
 acres, also beautifully located on a eminence in full 
 view of Wooster, and overlooking a great extent of 
 the choicest agricultural country in Ohio. The good 
 condition of the farm of Mr. R. is ihe best commen- 
 tary on hia industry, enterprize, and skill. The 
 meadow selected had been in grass for years, the 
 bottom generally fine and thick, in some portions 
 clover, in others thin, wiry grass. Ketchum's Mow- 
 er again led off, and performed its work t„ the sat- 
 isfaction of everybody. The acre was cut in about 
 half an hour. Manny's Mower followed cutting the 
 acre in about the same time, and nearly as well.' 
 Castle's Mower again started admirably but had to 
 be stopped and tinkered often, and had not completed 
 its acre before the judges, exhibitors and spectators 
 adjourned to the Reaper test. Ketchum's Mower 
 was unanimously awarded tiie first premium by the 
 Committee. It took the first at the trial at Spring- 
 field Ohio, last year, but we confidently anticipattd 
 when the first swath was laid Vjy Castle's Mower that 
 Buckeye genius was about to win the prize. Im- 
 provements may yet bo made in Castle's machine 
 which will enable it to go through future contests as 
 successfully as it now enters up n the trial. Ketch- 
 um's Mower is regarded as a nearly perfect machine, ' 
 and is rapidly advancing in public favor. The past 
 season five hundred were sold, and this season the 
 manufacture of one thousand does not begin to keep 
 pace with the demand. The machine on the ground 
 was purchased by Judge Musgrove, a member of the 
 board from Crawford county, before the exhibition, 
 and after the test it would no doubt have brought 
 $150 at auction had it been for sale. No second pre- 
 mium we believe was awarded for Mowers. 

The trial of Reapers on Thursday was much more 
 satisfactory than on Wednesday. The wheat was 
 even, stood well, and the ground quite rolling. All 
 the Machines cut a<lmirahly, and laid the grain much 
 better than the day previous. The first acre was cut
