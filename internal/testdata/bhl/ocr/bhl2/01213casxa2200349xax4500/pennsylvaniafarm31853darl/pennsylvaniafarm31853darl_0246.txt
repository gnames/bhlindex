DAVID TAGGART— MOLES— ORCHARD GRASS. 

[Oct oBBft 

nffilirttioM, a common bond of union, it is between a 
 '•Working Farmer" and a "Countri/ Gentleman," a 
 "New England Cultivator" and a "Northern, or Gen- 
 esee Farmer," jind if thei-e is any periodical in whose 
 pa;!es one should expect not to lind a record of harsh 
 language and personalities it is a "Journal of Agri- 
 culture," and one whoso motto is "to improve the 
 soil and the mind." 

When we. received the August number of the 
 Working Farmer, turned to the leader and saw 
 the caption of several of our cotemporaries names 
 all huddled together we' concluded, that in order to 
 save time, their heads were all to be cut off at a sin- 
 gle blow. Having a distaste for capital punishment, 
 we turued away, and have not had courage to exam, 
 ino the article since. Wli.Uevcr waj t'l-a result, it 
 appeared to us our friend Professor M. had a hostile 
 intent on that occasion, and if they escaped with on- 
 ly marks of the super phosphate about their persons, 
 they are fortunate. 

It is time for a truce. Gentlemen, bury the hatch- 
 et, drop into line, contend together for the common 
 cause, let, the super phosphate to the practical farm- 
 ers, who will tell you more about it after a while 
 thanyoucan leW them. Like all other wars, yours when 
 ended if ever ended, will leave us about as wise as 
 when you began. We hold that discussions on ag- 
 ricultural subjects should be as "impersonal as Ge- 
 ometry." In.the convention in this State, to reform 
 the constitution some years ago, we were present at 
 one of the sittings, when one of the most able and 
 influential debaters,moved a very simple proposition 
 which gave rise to several hours animated discus- 
 sion, enlisting the best talent of the house on each 
 side, when the mover rose and stated, that when he 
 m»de the original ■motion, he understood the case 
 perfectly, but since the very lenglhij and luminous 
 discussion, which he had listened to with so much 
 pleasure, his mind had become so confused and 
 darkened on the subject, that in order for further re- 
 flection, on behalf of himself and several of his 
 friends in a similar predicament, he moved to ad- 
 journ. 

How TO Drive Away Moles.— Take 1 lb. of bean 
 meal, 3 oz. of slacked lime in powder, i oz. of pow- 
 dered verdigris, and 4 oz. of essential" oil of laven- 
 der. After mixing thoroughly the powdery part of 
 the composition, incorporate the oil. With a little 
 water work the mixture into a dough. With this 
 torm balls the size of hazel nuts; they will harden 
 after having been exposed to the air for twenty-four 
 hours. Introduce them twenty or thirty feet apart 
 into the mole's runs, or one ball may be dropped in- 
 to the hole of each molp-hill, taking care to cover it 
 up immediately. The temell of these ingredients is 
 so olfensive to the mole, that he imediately deserts 
 his graund. The mixture is, at the same time, a vi- 
 olent poison for moles, rats, and all such vermin. —

Orchard Grass. 

We have no wish, "per so," to prevent the sowing 
 of Orchard Grass, in Illinois, or any where else, if its 
 introduction will be of any public advantage, but ob- 
 serving in the last "Prairie Farmer," it is highly 
 commended, we merely state our experience with it, 
 which may go for what it is worth. Other farmers 
 in this vicinity who have tried it, entertain the same- 
 opinion. 

We object to it, partly for the very reasons, the ed- 
 itor of the Farmer, commends it, viz : "its strong 
 pushing tendencies both in wet soil and dry," and 
 that it will take care of itself with a medium chance." 
 This we found to be too true, as we devoted one of 
 our fields to it for several years, and to our great loss. 
 We consider it the most worthless grass within our 
 knowledge, either for pasture or hay. It is said that 
 it must be pastured close, aiid not allowed to get up. 
 We never could induce our cows, cattle or horses to eat 
 it if they could get any thing else. They commenced 
 hauling as soon as they were turned into it, and con- 
 tinued uneasy till they were turned out. White and 
 red clover, timothy, green grass, (Poa Pratensis) in 
 the same field would all be eaten quite bare, while a 
 strip of orchard grass, would bo allowed to run up tt> 
 seed, and remain untouched. Some years ago a farmer 
 in this county, who exercised merely a supervision over 
 his farm, without, personally attending to the details, 
 was boasting of his Orchard Grass Hay, "that it 
 would last longer and go farther than any thing else." 
 On further enquiry, of the man who fed the stock, it 
 was found that the reason was, because every animal 
 refused to eat it, and it was left till spring and then 
 had .to be used for litter. 

We do not know, how on chemical analysis its nu- 
 tritious properties would compare with other grasses, 
 but in such a case we would rather trust to the in- 
 stincts cl animals, than to the manipulations of the 
 chemist. In a practical sense we do not consider it 
 nutritious or valuable, and when it once gets posses- 
 sion of the ground, spreads rapidly and is very diffi- 
 cult to get rid of. It is also very apt to grow into 
 tussocks, whether sown thick or thin. It does not 
 grow much more rapidly than the rye grass, "Lolium 
 Perenne," which is superior to it in every respect, 
 and stock are so fond qf, they will leave every thing 
 else, to go to ; the direct counterpart in this particu- 
 lar of the Orchard Grass. The only place we can 
 conceive of where Orchard Grass would be at all de- 
 sirable) is in pastures for droves of cattle or sheep, 
 contiguous to large cities, and where they are obliged 
 to stop a few hours, over night, to be filled up, not Jed, 
 before going into market. 

Tobacco leaves put around the body of pe"ch 
 trees, just beneath the surface of the ground, are re- 
 commended as a preventive of the worms that destroy 
 the trees by eating the bark.
