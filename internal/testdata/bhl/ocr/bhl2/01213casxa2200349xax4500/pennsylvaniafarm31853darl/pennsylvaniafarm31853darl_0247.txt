New Grain Fan. 

The accompanying cut represents the improved 
 Grain Separator, alluded to by our correspondent, 
 E. P., in present number of Farm Journal, on exhi- 
 bition at the Crystal Palace. Many farmers who 
 have seen it there, speak of its efficiency and sim- 
 plicity in the highest terms. We will advise our 
 readers so soon as some arrangement is made for its 
 introduction and sale in this State. The present ob- 
 ject of the Patentee being to dispose of State and 
 county rights. 

The New York Tribune, in speaking of this ma- 
 chine, says: 

"This machine is very unlike the fan-mill above 
 described, though answering the same purpose, and 
 even effecting much more, for by slight changes in 
 the force and direction of the blast, wheat can be 
 separated from chess, cookie, garlic, smut, white 
 heads, and other impurities, as well as from grass 
 seed, saving that and separating the different kinds 
 of grain and grass from one another. The wind 
 wheel is made of iron, sixteen inches in diameter, 
 eighteen inches long, and is pl.aoed in an air-tight 
 trunk at the bottom of the frame, which is three feet 
 ten inches high, two feet wide, and two feet ten inch" 

es long. The wind wheel is driven by a cog wheel 
 two feet diameter, which gives the fan great velocity, 
 sending the air up a tight trunk, through which the 
 grain is falling from the selves, which are not shaken 
 sideways, like the common fan-mills, requiring a 
 good deal of extra room, but are jogged in front by 
 a cam on the shaft of the driving wheel. The selves, 
 five in number, for different grain, are made fine at 
 the end where the grain first strikes them, to let 
 through fine seeds, and coarse at the other end, 
 through which the wheat falls on the inclined plane, 
 and through the wind-spout into a receiver at the 
 bottom. The wind-spout at the back of the mill 
 can be closed in part, or wholly, by which a little 
 blast is allowed, or all turned out through the selves. 
 This machine is very simple in its construction and 
 operation, and worth the attenti m uf Farmers and 
 Millers who desire something better and equally 
 cheap as the old fashioned Fanning Mill. It is quite 
 portable, as may be seen by its size, and the weight 
 is from 125 to 135 pounds only; of one of the size of 
 tliat exhibited. It was patented in July of the pres- 
 ent year, and originated in the great wheat region of 
 Northern Illinois, where the want of a perfect grain 
 cleaner has long been felt â€” the wheat from Chicago
