Delivered by Governor Emerson, M. D., before tlii 
 Cheater Counli/ AijrieuUural Society, on Saturday, 
 the nth of September, 18J8. 

American husbandry maybe viewed as consisting of 
 two systems, the first or simplest being that carried on 
 where the fertility of the virgin soils on recently re- 
 claimed lands exacts little else than mere culture to 
 produce good crops. The second system is that which 
 has to be adopted on lands long used and more or 
 less impoverished, where fertilizers of various kinds 
 have to be applied, with all ihe assistance that can 
 be gained from improved implements and laljor-saviog 
 machines. The great discoveries made of late years 
 by scientific investigators in the analysis of plants 
 and their resolution into the primary elements were 
 referred to, the nature and properties of lime in its 
 different states, were explained, together with its ap- 
 plications. The practical bearings of a few simple 
 principles were given, the chief of which was solu- 
 bility to secure efficient activity as a fertUizer. The 
 modes in which this may be secured was pointed out. 
 Reference was made to the injurious effects produced 
 by applying lime in a quick state upon heaps con- 
 taining animal manures. To prevent the escape of 
 ammonia from stables, sinks, and manure heaps, plas- 
 ter has been used, scattered in and over them. But 
 a better method is to sprinkle these occasionally with 
 diluted sulphuric acid in the proportion of one pint 
 of acid to eight gallons of water. Gypsum or lime 
 in the state of a sulphate is extremely insoluble. In 
 many sections of our country it appears of no value 
 as a fertilizer even when applied to Clover and the 
 grasses. In othorj it is so highly prized in conse- 
 quence of its actual or supposed fertilizing virtues 
 that almost any price would be paid by farmers rath- 
 er than go wiJiout. During the war with Great 
 Britain, plaster in Pennsylvania brought as much 
 per ton as Peruvian Guano does at the present day. 
 He dwelt upon the supr eme efficiency of phosphate 
 of lime as a fertilizer, and the immense quantities of 
 it carried to England from this and other countries 
 in the form of bones. These and other kinds of fer- 
 tilizers which the English import every year in such 
 immense quantities enable her farmers to raise im- 
 mense crops. Premiums have been given in England 
 fur 88 bushels of wheat, 80 of barley, and a IU8 of 
 oats per acre. Tlie existence of a bone trade in this 
 country and the exter.t to which it is carried on, were 
 mentioned. Bones dissolved in sulphuric acid are 
 far more active than when applied in their ground 
 state. The agriculture of this country suffers im- 
 mense loss from the bones allowed to be exported. 
 As much as 700 tons of bones have been carried a- 
 way from Philadelphia to England in one vessel, 
 which, if converted into a super-phosphate would 
 "ive a dressing to 7000 acres. 
 One of the most important movements in agricul- 

ture at the present day is the rapid ex ension of the 
 use of concentr;itcd fertilizers. To increase the effi- 
 ciency when applied to tlie wheat crop, Doctor Em- 
 erson has had a manure chest adapted to a a Drill, 
 from which the fertilizer is made to drop into the 
 same tubes with the seed-grain, both falling into the 
 same row so as to bo covered together. By thus se- 
 curing the proximity of the seed and its fertilizer, 
 the Dr. expects to obtain greater effects from a mod- 
 erate application, than can be procured from a much 
 laro-er amount spread broadcast. Jethro Tull's sys" 
 tern of thorough culture , cannot make crops grow 
 well where the elom cnts of fertility are absent from 
 the soil. The pries t may pray over the ground for 
 an increase, but his prayers will be of n o avail with- 
 out they be accompanied by the application of ma- 
 nure. The Dr. dilated upon the vast importance of 
 Brimstone to the arts and manufacturers as well as 
 to Agriculture, and the immense quantity of sulphur 
 carried to Eng'aud to be used chiefly in the arts of 
 peace, little, comparatively spea king, being employed 
 to make gunpowder. As sulphuric acid is the Key- 
 stone of many oi the most important manufacturing 
 processes which enrich Great Britain, it is becommg 
 of immense importance to agriculture, founding the 
 basis of nearly al Ihe best concentrated fertilizers. 
 Sulphur in the United States pays an import duty 
 of 15 per cent. In England where they know their 
 interests better it is admitted free. Dr. E. has used 
 no less than 8000 lbs. of strong oil of vitriol the pres- 
 ent year in the preparation of fertilizers for his crops, 
 which he reports as extremely luxuriant, lie ad- 
 verted to the superior skill of British farmers as en- 
 abling them to employ more capital on their forms 
 than is usually done in the United States. Besides 
 the millions expended in the purchase of honors which 
 are brought from the ends of the earth. Eng and 
 imports not less than six or seven millions of dollars 
 worth of Guano every year. As every ton of these 
 en able her formers to raise several tons of gram, and 
 animal food, th is proves an admirable method to re- 
 duce the amount of importations from abroad for 
 which money or goods would have to be paid. 

The English not content with gathering fertilizers 
 from the ends of the world, do not stop here, but im- 
 port also the master spirits who can instruct them to 
 make the most of their resources. The invitation 
 extended to the celebrated Dr. Leibig of Germany, 
 to come over and deliver a course of lectures was a 
 special honor paid the science for its illustration of 
 agricultural subjects hitherto resting in deep obscur- 
 ity The invitation to Professor Johnson of Eng. 
 land by the New York State Agricultural Society 
 was a similar recognition of improvements effected 
 in husbandry through facts developed by scientific 
 investigators. Dr. urged strongly the advantages 
 I now to be derived by farmers from the perusal of 
 ' good books, which ought tÂ« be distributed by Agri-
