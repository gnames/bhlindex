lai. pr^r ton; and were we to calculate the ammonia 
 of each at 6(1. pel- IIj., as many of our best chemists 
 do, the result wouhi bo that the inferior manure 
 would be worth 21. 18i-. i'ul, while the Peruvian gu- 
 ano would be worth 12/. da. IJd. But the former 
 was bought at 4/. Ws. per ton, hence it cost as much 
 aa the latter at 18/. 17i'. per ton. Ammonia and 
 phosphate of lime are considered to bo the two prin- 
 cipal substances in the composition ot a manure for 
 Turnips, while alkaline matter is not supposed to be 
 essential aa an application in the growing of this 
 crop; hence, if we exclude the latter trom the fore- 
 going estimates, the result will be that the artificial 
 manure, which sold at 90s. per ton, really cost aa 
 much as Peruvian guano at 3U. per ton. 

Another view of this subject will place this trans- 
 action in a somewhat amusing light. In every 10 
 tons of the so-called artificial manure the purchasers 
 carted home nearly 3 tons of chalk and U tons of 
 sand; and if the extra por-ceutage of water over 
 ■what is contained in good dry guano be taken into 
 account, it will appear that, while one-half of the 

friends assume a more practical form, and are more 
 earnestly responded to by the Farmer. 

As a member of the farming interest, I will make 
 an advance towards effecting a bettor understanding 
 between the parties in order that we may labor har- 
 moniously and in concert. That the reasons of our sci- 
 entific allies in reference to the action of plants in se- 
 lecting their food and injudicious manuring, are so 
 coolly received and their suggestions for impTove- 
 ment so little heeded, is not owing to their ignorance, 
 or prejudice against Book farming, but rather to a 
 prudent caution with which experience has taught 
 them to receive innovations, on customs long sanc- 
 tioned by practice, as well as the wrecks of many 
 schemes that have been presented to them, for making 
 two blades grow in the place of one, with little ex- 
 pense and leas labor. 

Enough has been written to prove as far as writing 

manure was utterly worthless, the other half was not , g_^n pr^yp that the yield of land would, or rather 
 equal in value to the very poorest sample of Patago 
 nian guano. J. H- 

should be increased by adapting a new, or changing

 Analysis of Soi's by a Practical Farmer. 

Those persons who have devoted themselves to Ag- 
 riultural chemisty, appear to be satisfied, that plan's, 
 select frimi the soil, such substances,, as are requir- 
 ed for their growth, and that growth vigour and per- 
 fection are in proportion as those substances are fur- 
 nished by the soil. That the system of manuring as 
 at present practised is injudiciou8,-'^manure being 
 often applied at considerable expense, with little or i 
 no benefit, if not positive injury— at other times ma- 
 nures of great value are neglected or hist, when they 
 might be advantageously used or exchanged with 
 neighbors to their mutual benefit. 

These declarations .are not denied by the Farmers 
 neither are they exactly believed. Their continued 
 incredulity, aeems to their friends aS an hopeless ob- 
 stinacy, engendered by ignorance and sustained by 
 prejudice against Book farming. The farmers neith- 
 er deny or believe this either. 

These feelings and views exist and have e.tlstcd a 
 long time, and like the system of manuring complain- 
 ed of, are somewhat of an injury to all conoeruod, 
 and which in all probability, can be easily improved 
 or removed, when the exertions oi our scientific 

is no available way to him for finding what the want- 
 ing ingredient is. 

The'-e is no praoti.«ed or skilful person to under- 
 take th. analysis, and I know from the little expe- 
 rience I have had iu the manipulations of chemistry, 
 it is the easiest thing in the wor.d to be mistaken. 

I therefore propose to be one of ten Farmers who 
 will raise one hundred dollars to pay a suitable and 

; qualified person, who will undertake to analyze a 
 certain number of specimens of our soils if such a 

' person can be had. 

I The task of selecting such person to devolve on a 
 committee of our scientific friends, this we ask as a 
 favor feeling not only our incompetence to judge of 
 the merits of chemists, but the great importance of 
 not being victimised by unqualified persons. 

And if after a certain iiumlior of trials it is found , 
 the suggestions for manuring on scientific principles \ 
 is what is promised for them, and wo fail to adopt! 
 them, then will we richly deserve all the contempt | 
 such obstinacy and prejudice merits, but until there , 
 is a pump or draw in the well we niust be excused 
 from going there for rt'ater. Tbedvffrin. 

The above artl.de probably contains tlio views of a 
 large number of Farmers, who have been under the 
 same difficulty, are willing and anxious to be instruct- 
 ed by their scientific friends, but know of no avail- *
