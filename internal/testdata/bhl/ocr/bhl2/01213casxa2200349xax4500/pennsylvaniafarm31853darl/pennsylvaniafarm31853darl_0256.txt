STATE FAIR. 

[October 

preceding fairs. The large ring prepared for the 
 display of their good points, was surrounded by an 
 eager and admiring crowd from the opening to the 
 closing of the exhibition, while the frequent cheer- 
 ing gave evidence of the spirited contest between the 
 competitors inside. We shall have more to say of 
 these hereafter. 

The display of Cattle was also excellent, and de- 
 servedly attracted attention. The Short Horns pre- 
 dominated in number and quality. A few DoVLns 
 and Alderneys only were offered, but the display of 
 natives and grades was large and good. 

The Implement Department was vrell flUed.though 
 the number of new implements was not large. A 
 few valuable improvements in Straw Cutters, Smut 
 and Threshing Machines, were offered, but the great 
 attraction of tliis department w.as Atkin's Automa- 
 ton Self-Raking Reaper and Mower. It was an ob- 
 ject of universal interest, and whenever it was put in 
 operation, admiring crowds followed or surrounded 
 it. Wo cannot describe the wonderful ingenious ar- 
 rangement of this machine. By it the grain is de- 
 posited in beautiful order in the rear ol the machine, 
 in bundles sufficiently larga for aheave.s, and ready 
 for the hand of the binder. The reaping and mow- 
 ing parts .are also greatly improved, and the whole 
 macliino exhibits the womlorful triumpli of genius. 

Perhaps the best filled department amongst the 
 stock, was that of Sheep. Of these the display Was 
 remarkably fine, and decidedly in advance of any 
 former exhibition. The most praiseworthy care ap- 
 peared to have been taken in their maciigemeDt. 
 The Western part of Pennsylvania is as well adapt- 
 ed to wool growing as any section of the Union, and 
 the only wonder is that more farmers have not taken 
 hold. A single glance at the line specimens of Penn- 
 sylvania sheep on exhibition, could not have failed to 
 satisfy even the most skeptical upon this point. 

Of Swine the number exhibited was njt l.TJge, al- 
 though some were very fine. The groat Western 
 States appear to have so completely raonopolized the 
 pork business, that the raising of .Swine in the East 
 is confined to the family wants of individual farm 
 crs. 

We cannot close this Isasty sketch without express- 
 ing our thanks to the officers for the many courtesies 
 extended us. The Police were attentive and polite 
 to all, and what is worthy of special note, is the fact 
 that of the one hundred thousand persons who 
 thronged that largo euch^sure from Tuesday rajrning 
 until Friday evening, not a single ease of drunken- 
 ness nor of ungentlomanly conduct presented itself. 

To Mr. McSkimmons, the gentlemanly Agent of 
 the Pennsylvania Railroad Company.we are indebted 
 for many kind favors. By his untiring energy the 
 facilities for transporting visitors to the fair grounds 
 were largely increased. More than thirty thousand 
 people were carried in iho cars on Tliur3iJ:ty, and 

twenty thousand on Friday. Besides this immense 
 thoroughfare,every avenue to the grounds was crowd- 
 ed with Vehicles and pedestrians. 

We present to our readers all the reports we could 
 procure, up to this time. AVc are compelled to go 
 to press, after deferring publication ten daj'S, in the 
 hope we could present them ^all in this number.
