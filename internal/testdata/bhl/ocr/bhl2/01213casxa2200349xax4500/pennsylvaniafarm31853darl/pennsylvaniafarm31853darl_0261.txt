The Ploughing Match. 

The ploughing match took place in a field about 
 three miles from the city. The field was a very stiff 
 Bod, requiring strong horses, and many excellent 
 ploughmen failed to take a prize, simply from the in- 
 efficiency of their teams. There were twenty com- 
 petitors, and at ahout ten o'clock, all started off in 
 gallant style.

Chester County Agricultural Exhibition. 

This, the first in Chester county, afte/ a suspen- 
 sion for eight or ten years, and the first in the series 
 of cjunty exhibitions to occur the present Fall in 
 Pennsylvania, took place on the IGth and 17th ult. 
 In respect to the amount of fine s;ock of all kindi, 
 and other articles exhibited, no less than the general 
 interest manile.ited by the very large attendance, it 
 far surpassed what was expected. It was estimated 
 eight to ten thousand persons visited West Chester 
 on the occasion. The Horticultural Exhibition com- 
 ing off at the same time, no doubt helped to swell 
 the number. 

A largo number of full bred and grade Durham 
 cows, heifers, and bulls wjre on the ground, as well 
 as Devoas, Holstein and Alderneys, and one fine Ayr- 
 shire bull, belonging to A. 11. Mcllvaine. Many of 
 the Durliams exhibited were descended from the 
 stock imported into this county somj years ago, by 
 Joseph Cope and Paschall M irris, and am jng the 
 cows of this breed, (as well as native stock, were 
 some very extraordinary milkers. This being a dairy 
 district, considorablo attention has been paid to this 
 jarticular, and those familiar with "Guenon's marks 
 ot chjjsing a Milch C)W," had here a fine opportu- 

nity to test the truth of the system. The largest con- 
 tributor in neat cattle, was A. Bolmir, of West Ches- 
 ter, who showed over thirty head of cows, heifers, 
 and two mignilicent Uarham bulls, all of his own 
 raising. Tnese attracted great attention from their 
 very fine size, combined with great neatness, and 
 were highly creditable to his skill as a breeder, and 
 to the gjneral reputation of this district for superior 
 stock. He, Pasohall and John Worth, Gerard Cope, 
 and George Brinton, Jr., were the chief contributors 
 of Durham stock. The latter had a very fine young 
 Durham bull, of great promise, whose portrait will 
 appear in next number of Farm .Journal. Richard 
 Pirn showed some fine Davons, which received the first 
 premium, as they did in 1852, at the State fair at 
 Lancaster. The tine Alderney Bull, figured in Sep- 
 tember number of Farm -Journal, belonging to Mar- 
 shall and Francis Strode, attracted much attention, 
 and received tin first premium. The display of hor- 
 ses, although not large.embraced somigood animals, 
 among which, the fine Norman draught horse of S. 
 Ilolman, was con-ipicuous. In respect to sheep and 
 swine, the exhibition surpassed either of our State 
 fairs of 51 & 52, or any county exhibition which has 
 yet been hold in Ponnsylv.vnia. Chester county has 
 long bean celebrated above oljier pjrtions of the 
 State, in these particulars. It was the opinion of 
 many attending from other counties, that, taking the 
 whole stock of all kinds into view, the display at our 
 late fair, has not 3'et been exceeded by those either 
 of the State or any other county. In agricultural 
 implem3nts, vogetablj productions, dairy products, 
 seeds, grain, flour, honey, plants, &3., there was also 
 a creditable display, though not as largo as there 
 should have been, or will be hereafter. Chester 
 county, which has thus led off, may well say to her sis- 
 ter counties, go and do likewise. An effort will be 
 made to purchase a suitable lot for future ijccasions, 
 and erect permanent fixtures. . 

Bx'iibition of the York County Agricultural S.)- 
 clely. 

We have had no official information about this 
 fair, whi ;h will probably be one of the best in ihe 
 State, and only within a day or two have observe! a 
 notice of it. 

It is to be held on the 5th, Gth and 7th days of Octi - 
 ber. Passengers will be carried on the Baltimore 
 & Susquehanna and Cumberland Valley railroads at 
 liiilf thj usual rates, and articles for exhibition free 
 of charge. In aldition to fioe stock, and other mat- 
 ter for which York county has been famous, it is un- 
 derstood there is also to bo a grand display of fowls, 
 one exhibitor, (.Vlbertus Welsh,) of York, having 30 
 coops, some of the kinds not before exhibited, tha 
 Pearl Bantam Fowls, weighing thirteen ounces the 
 pair. An adilress is t) delivered by the Hon. 
 A. L. Hayes, of Lancaster.
