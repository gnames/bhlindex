State Poultry Exiiibltlon. 

We give below tho premium list of this society for 
 their first exhibition, which is to bo held in Phila- 
 delphia, and will no doubt attract a larp;e concourse 
 of people, and be highly interesting. At a meeting 
 of the society, held at the Art Union Rooms, on the 
 r2th instant, James Andrews, Esq., of Darby, was 
 unanimously elejted President, in place of Col. John 
 Price Wetherill, deceased, and Dr. William D. Biinc" 
 kle was unanimously elected Vice President. These 
 are excellent selections. 

In reference to the prosperity of tho society, and 
 the approaching exhibition, F. G. Wolbert, one of the 
 Executive Committee, writes us: — "Our society now 
 numbers four hundred and six members, and our 
 arrangements for the exhibition are nearly perfected. 
 In addition to the show of Poultry, Pigeons and rare 
 Birds, (which will eclipse any thinj; of the kind ever 
 got up in this country,) there will bo promenade 
 concerts nightly in the upper saloon. Our esteemed 
 member, C. W. Biijider, tenders the use of his cele- 
 brated hatching machine, so that the curious may 
 see hatching by artilicial means. Several of our 
 members are experienced in the art of caponizing, 
 and will make experiments daily, so that those who 
 desire may learn tlie science. We hope to have a 
 visit from our friends during the exhibition."
