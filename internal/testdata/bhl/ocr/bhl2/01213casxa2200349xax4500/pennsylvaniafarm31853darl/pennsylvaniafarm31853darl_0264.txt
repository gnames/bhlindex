It would appear, as if the premiums offered for 
 stallions and marcs, were to be confined to one class, 
 nothing being said about road or draught.

 George Walker's Premium Crop of Corn. 

To the Editor of the Farm Journal. — As you have 
 pulilisliod some severe animadversions upon George 
 Walker, for the statement of a corn crop raised by 
 him last year, it is nothing more than justice to him, 
 and is due to our Agricultural Society, as well as to 
 the community at large, that they should hear both 
 sides. I therefore enclose you a vindication of the 
 parties concerned, from the pen of one of our most 
 practical and safe farmers — a man who is not likely 
 tube inauenced by prejudice, interest or authority. 

I will merely add that our society has, every year 
 since its institution, awarded premiums for upwards 
 of one hundred bushels of shelled corn p^,r acre, and 
 it is unreasonable to suppose when other instances 
 are so frequent, of 150 and IGO bushels being raised, 
 that our society has been either egregiously mista- 
 takcn, or shamefully imposed upon. 

We should wish you also to remember that the 
 premium on corn, was not the only one awarded to 
 us at the State Fair.

Corn Crop. 

DiMocK, Sept. 10th, 1853. 
 II. II. Frazier, Esq. — Allow me, if you please, a 
 small space in your valu ble paper for a few state- 
 ments as appendages to that of neighbor Walker's 
 Corn crop; f)r 1 have heard much said about his 
 raising an incredible and unheard of large crop, as 
 though such an amount never had been, or could bo 
 raised on an acre of ground. Now for the benefit of 
 those wlio doubt Mr. Walker's raising that amount, 
 (and have ratlitr impugned the decision of the judg-
