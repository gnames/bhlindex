Sale of Eari Ducie's Stock. 

Although matter lias accumulated on hand 
 just previous to closing our edition, particularly in 
 I'elation to the State Fair, we cannot refrain from 
 gratifj'ing the anxiety of many of our readers, in re- 
 lation to this great sale of stock, which exceeds all 
 hitherto known in England. It will be observed that 
 some of the best, and indeed the highest priced ani- 
 mals are coming to America. Duchess 04, a red cow 
 four years old, being purchased by J. Thorne of New 
 York, for 600 guineas ; a roan heifer throe years old, 
 Duchess 60, for 700 guineas, for Messrs. Morris &Be- 
 oar, of New York, for wliom also it was understood 
 the best bull, "Duke of Gloster," was knocked off for 
 050 guineas to Mr. Tanqueray, who is to use him one 
 year before delivering him up. We annex the cata- 
 logue of sale, below, with the single remark that 
 the.se remarkable prices are considered in England 
 no mere fictitious valuations, but bona fide and in" 
 trinsic evidences of the skill, science and success 
 with which the late Earl had bred his herd, and which 
 was thus appreciated by the most intelligent breeders 
 in England present at the sale. Every one interested 
 in stock will be anxious to hear of their safe arrival 
 in the United States.
