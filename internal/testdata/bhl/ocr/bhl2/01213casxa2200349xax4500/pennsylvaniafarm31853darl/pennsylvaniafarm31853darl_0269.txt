motbod, but little less objeetionable, is to shut them 
 in the stable; hut this dues not learn them to rcipr.fl 
 afciice in the least. Now the bettor way, and the 
 one that the writer has praeticed with uriitorm sue- , 
 teas, is the following: — Prepare a yard, (if it contains 
 an aere or more, so m\ii\\ the better,) having a strong 
 high fence, so high that the colt cannot possibly leap j 
 over it — from six to seven feet will be sufficient^ 
 and let the materials of which the fence i- composed 
 bo the same as those enclosing the Held where the 
 colt is in future to be kept — -either ivall, boards, or 
 rails, as the case may be^-and place him there with- 
 out any artiScial ap]jenda<;e whatever, and let him 
 understand that it. i.i (he fence alone that prci^^ah liis 
 escape. He should be generously fed, and also have 
 a shed to which he can retire at pleasure. After he 
 has been sulidued in this way, he may l>e turned into 
 any tield h.avimj a fence of the same kind, and of or- 
 dinary height, and ho will not attempt to break over. 
 Even the most spirited horse brought up in this way 
 cannot be induced to leap aicnce lour and a half feet 
 high. 

The practical benefits of the above plan arc great. 
 In passing through the country, one is pained to see 
 80 many noble looking horses shackled and hamper- 
 ed in every conceivable way that in^'^nuity can in- 
 vent, much to their detriment in putting on flesh, 
 to say nothing of the perplexity and trouble to the 
 owner in adjusting the trappings every time the beast 
 is turned out or taken up, and all for the want of a 
 little care during the lirst year, — for it is eminently 
 true in this case that an ounce of prevention is worth 
 a pound oi cure. 

There are many horses not "true," or reliable, in 
 the harness, having the habit to stop or walk, especi- 
 ally at the foot of a '-ill ; this is caused by having 
 been at some time overloaded, and perhaps unmerci- 
 fully beaten. Neighbor A. has a beautiful span of 
 bays three years old, that he has been breaking in 
 the past winter; he wishes to haul some rails from 
 the farther side of the farm, and as the colts have be- 
 come tolerably "handy," he puts on nearly a full 
 load, which they manage very well until they coma 
 to a "hard spot," and there they atop. The driver 
 looks at the load, then looks at the hor.ses; they are 
 nearly as large as the old team, — he known they can 
 draw it, and is determined they shall. So he com- 
 mences beating and p(mnding the poor animals until 
 he is nearly worried out, when he throws off his 
 load and goes home with loss of both time and tem- 
 per, and the horses damaged to the amount of twen- 
 ty-five dollars each. 

Now it is f(uite probable that they had .itremjlh 
 enough to draw the load in q\u'stion, but they had 
 not sufficient practice; they did not know how to ap- 
 ply their strength, and did not work in concert. Tliey 
 should have been made to draw only light loads for 
 a long time, and then by increasing the weight grad- 
 ually, as their strength and experience increases, 
 they can be made to do all th" work they are capable 
 of doing, and will always work kindly, and may be 
 depended on under all circumstances. — Tlie Wool

 ornamental purposes.

Vegetable 0.\rdem: — T owards the latter part of 
 the month, cabbage, cauliflower and lettuce sown 
 last month may bo transplanted into frames, to bo 
 kept through the winter, for which purpose procure 
 I:oards about one foot wide, of the recpiisi te length to 
 hold the desired number of plants and to suit the 
 sash, and arrange them in any sheltered situation. 
 They should be nailed to short posts at the four cor- 
 ners, and be one foot high at the back, and about six 
 inches in front. Shutters or straw mats should be 
 provided to guard against extreme cold. Bank up 
 the earth on the outside of the frame. Plants kept 
 in this way should have air through the winter on all 
 ti.ie days, so as to harden them by exposure. If kept 
 too warm they will continue growing and become 
 tender. Continue earthing up celery on fine and dry 
 d lys. T lin out growing crops of spinach and kale- 
 Clean and dress beds of aromatic herbs by cutting 
 out decayed stems, and digging between such as will 
 admit of it. II the ground is poor, top dress with 
 rotten manure. Onicms, if not already planted, 
 should be set out to make offsets for early spring use. 
 Seed of rhubarlj may now bo sown. Dig up horse- 
 radish for use as wanted. Collect pumpkins and 
 winter squashes. Take up potatoes and stow away 
 in bins in cellar. Collect all cabbage stumps and 
 other refuse stuff from gr ound now vacant, and haul 
 to pig pens or compost heap. If the soil is at .all 
 stiff, it should bo dugor ploughed up deeply before 
 the approach of winter. 

Flower Garden. — All plants that arc ten.acious of 
 frost should be attended to the early part of thin 
 month, and get ready for winter qu.arters; all plants 
 intended to flower in the window should be potted 
 immediately and placed in a close frame and shaded 
 from the sun, for a short time, to take fresh root. 
 When they have become established give air freely. 
 Sow flower seeds on a south border the early part of 
 this mcmlh, to remain out over winter. The following 
 are suitable for that purpose : — Candytuft in variety; 
 Clarkias do.. Gillies do., dwT German Larkspur, 
 Erysimum Perofskianum, Escholzia C'alifornica, 
 Coreopsis Bicolor. When hard weather sets in, these 
 should be covered with dry leaves or long litter. Tu- 
 lips, Hyacinths, &e., should be planted now to ensure 
 I success in blooming. The soil mu st be rich. If the 
 I soil in the bed is naturally poor, it will be best 'to 
 I take it out and fill in with good soil to the depth of 
 ' a foot. PI mt the bulbs in rows nine incl'.os wide.
