The increase in the circulation of the Farm Jour- 
 nal, and in the duties of its business department 
 since the removal of its publication to West Chester, 
 have been such as to require the unremitted atten- 
 tion and supervision of one person — a desideratum 
 which could not have been attained under the late 
 arrangement. To effect this, one of the late firm — 
 J. M. Meredith — purchased the respective shares of 
 Messrs. Bowen and Spangler in the establishment, and 
 ■will hereafter give his time and attention exclusively 
 to the business department of the Journal. Discard- 
 ing visionary theories, and relying upon the test of 
 practical experience, the publishers desire to make it 
 truly the Farm Journal, where every farmer in the 
 latitude of its usefulness may note whatever is supe- 
 rior in his mode of culture, management of stock 
 and other matters appertaining lo the successful 
 prosecution of the business of an American Agricul- 
 turist. No pains or expense will be spared to make 
 this work fully equal to ;iny other published in the 
 country. The delays occasionally inseparable from the 
 publication under the former proprietors, it is be- 
 lieved will not hereafter occur. As an evidence o^ 
 this we may state that, owing to the waiting for the 
 reports of the State Fair, and to sickness and death 
 in the office where the Journal was recently publish- 
 ed, the present double number was not commenced 
 until about tlie middle of October, yet we hope it will 
 reach our readers in due season 

The title of the firm has been changed from Bow- 
 en, Meredith k Co., to J. M. Meredith A Co., to 
 whom all business communications should bo ad- 
 dressed. 

J. L. Darlington, Esq., continues at the head of 

the editorial department. All communications rela- 
 ting thereto should be addressed to him, or to " The 
 Editor of the Farm Journal."

Pulverization of the Soil. 

We know of no department of Farm tillage of so 
 much importance and so much neglected, as complete 
 and thorougli pulverization. The theory of its action 
 is so manifest and the benefit in various ways so 
 striking, that the indifference of farmers in respect 
 to it, can only be attributed to the force of habit. 
 Wo are very apt to follow what we have boon used 
 to, but our own experience and perhaps that of every 
 observing farmer, has been that neither the harrow, 
 nor roller although repeatedly passed over a field, 
 can reduct the soil to that friable and porous condi- 
 tion which is desirable. The relative fertility of a 
 soil depends much on its absorbent power and this 
 again on the minute division of its parts. When it is 
 considered that the organic food of plants constituting 
 over 90 per cent, is derived chiefly from the atmos- 
 pliere, the loss from any defective cultivation, which 
 would shut off or interfere with free access to this 
 great soureeof supply, will bereadily perceived. Am- 
 monia and nitric acid those great fertilizers, nature 
 has abundantly proYided, which are disengaged by 
 atmospheric electricity, and carried down with rafn, 
 watery vapor always existing in the driest wcathej, 
 carbonic acid ever present in the atmosphere f um 
 which the whole of the carbon in plants is primar- 
 ily derived, and when deprived of which they die; 
 oxygen the great agent of decomposition, and neees- 
 sary to the germination of all seeds, are great sources 
 of nutrition, available only to a limited extent, un- 
 less the particles of soil arc in a state of fine commi- 
 nution, soastoadmit of their free access. JothioTull, 
 in his theory that the sole difference in soils, was 
 owing to the fine division of particiss, probably wont 
 too far, but its groat importance was not (/eneriil/i/ 
 nppu'ciated in his day, neither is it at present. He 
 reduced his views so far to practice, as to raise twelve
