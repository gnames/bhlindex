PULVERIZATION OF THE SOIL.— NORWAY MAPLE. 

[ NoVember 

(Successive crops of wheat from the name land, simply 
 by the free use of the plough and cultivator. Where 
 the Boil is finely divided in addition to its increased 
 absorbent power, the roots of plants ramify and dis- 
 tribute themselves more thoroughly, and are brought 
 Into more direct contact with the nutritive particles 
 0l SDil. Vegetable decomposition is promoted, and 
 the hard lumps containing little reservoirs of food 
 Otherwise entirely unavailable, are made to open out 
 their locked up supplies. The great aim should be 
 to bring the roots into contact with as many points 
 of nutrition as possible. Where the ground is 
 left lumpy, it is the same thing ah cutting off the 
 needed supplies of food. The tender fibres of plants 
 (ire entirely unable to penetrate hard clods. It is 
 also well known that finely pulverized soils, suffer 
 much less from drought than (.thers, because they 
 ^remorepormeable to atmospheric influences, and are 
 able to absorb more moisture. Whatever evapora- 
 tion may take place from the surface during the Jay 
 time, is more than counteracted by increased absorp- 
 tion of the inner and exterior portions during the 
 night. The reason that garden culture is more pro- 
 ductive than the field, is not entirely owing to (he 
 extra coat of manure, but to the thorongh manner in 
 which the soil is dug, broken up and Jinelij divided. 
 Although the disuse of the plough, ma}' seem like a 
 relic of barbarism, there are portions of Europe, and 
 of Great Britain where spado culture, even on a 
 large scale is couKidcred more profitablo, solely from 
 the finer division and more complete disintegration 
 of the particles of soil. The nearer farming can ap- 
 proximate to gardening the better and more perfect 
 the system. Among our Farm implements, souie- 
 tliiug is greatly wanted to bring about that fine pul- 
 verization, which cannot be effectually dene with tho 
 roller. For want of anything bettor, we have used 
 with the greatest advantage particularly on a few 
 acres of ground devoted to vegetables, a mere plat- 
 form made of boards 7 or 8 feet long, nailed to cross 
 Strips, so as to be about five feet wide. To this at 
 one end, we h.avo attached a forked chain, for the 
 horses to draw by. If found not heavy enough with 
 etnnJing on it, it may be loaded with stones. This 
 thoroughly breaks up the lumps, and makes the 
 whole fine and mellow. Professor Wilkinson late of 
 Mount Airy,in a recent letter to us,de8cribes an imple 
 -ment ho has used, with great advantage, which ho 
 -eays "costs but a tithe of what a roller does and is 
 worth a dozen of them." To give a better idea of 
 Jt we have had an engraving made of a drawing he 
 sent us, something like the following 

long, to them nail on like clap boards, strips of 1} 
 inch hard oak plank 6 inches wide, and drag it by a 
 chain attached to the front corners. If the land is 
 wet, (which it ought not to be when this is used,) so 
 as to clog the machine it must be turned over and 
 kept cli'an with the hoe. Add to other advantage.' 
 of fine pulverization we have mentioned, the increas- 
 ed destruction of weeds, which thus have no places 
 of harbor, left them, and we hope farmers will be . 
 induced to give tho subject more attention.

Norway Maple, 

Wo somewhat wonder that tho above beautiful tree 
 Acer PLatanoides ia not more generally known and 
 planted. We think it the most dcsirableof the maple 
 family, and is better adapted on several accounts for 
 street planting than any other. It does not grow 
 so tall as to bo objectionable, but makes a very dense 
 compact headjfully equal to tho Horse Chesnut. The 
 leaves are of a dark shining green, perhaps a little 
 larger than the A. Pseudofilatanus, or sycamore, and 
 although, all the other species of maple are more or 
 less subject to attacks of caterpillars and insects, we 
 have never yet observed anything of the kind on the 
 Norway maple. This may bo owing to the piescnce 
 of a sharp milky juice, peculiar to this species, and 
 which is offensive to them. It may be observed ex- 
 uding at the base of the Petiole, when broken off. 
 There arc two or three trees planted along the streets 
 of West Chester, and several very fine ones about 15 
 to 20 feet high at the Westtown Boarding School, 
 3 miles distant. They are model trees, and look as 
 if with their dense foliage they would almost turn a 
 shower of rain like an umbrella. 

Wo arc not certain but that the norway maple is 
 rather a alow grower. It certainly is so when small 
 and disposed to head low; after it g-ts up, however, 
 we have seen a growth of two or three feet in one 
 season. It deserves to be extensively pl.anted. 

It is native of Europe in woods, particularly Ger- 
 many and Switzerland, seed ripens in October. Bo- 
 tanical character, leaves cordate, smooth 5 lobed; 
 lobes acuminated, with a few coarse acute teeth, 
 corymbs st.ilked, erectish and smooth with divarica- 
 ted wings. 

Tulip Poplar. — Liriodendron Tulipifera, is another 
 of our very beautiful, shade trees, well adapted for 
 street or lawn, which is comparatively lost sight of, 
 for no other reason, than that it is so common. In 
 England, 3000 miles away from its native habitat it 
 is properly appreciated, and highly valued. The Ger- 
 ma s also make much use of it for avenues. It is 
 rather more difficult to transplant than other trees, 
 owing to a deficiency of fibrous root. The nursery- 
 men who obtains his stock from the woods, even when 
 small will probably lose 50 to 75 per cent. But after 
 having been thus transplanted, and a growth of 
 fibre induced by cutting off tho main roots, the Tulip
