 established tlieygrow rapidly. So ma^joifioent a tree 
 is the admiration of all foreigners, and with its j;or- 
 geous blo.ssoms, erect and stately habit, broad and 
 lively foliage, well deserves a liltle extra pains and 
 risk to obtain. Were it only an exotic it would be 
 more valued and more frequently planted.

Inferior Guaao and Artilicial Maiiuros—Aualjses. 

Tlie present scarcity of Peruvian Guano in our 
 markets has induced a great demand for other fertil- 
 isers, and to supply this demand many ariioles for 
 the iaiprovemeutot ihe soil are daily advertised and 
 sold at a price very far above their real value. We have 
 had Mexican, African and Patagonian guano going 
 otF at a cost which can never repay those who bought 
 them; "Diphosphates, " "Improved Phospliates," and 
 various other compounds offered for sale at prices 
 very nearly double their value. For the information 
 of the agricultural cominuuity, I here state the com- 
 parative value of these diiferent manures.y/'o;« xaai- 
 ple.i which were sent me, wilh the cakulalioii of tlieir 
 value. 

For the P.itagonian guano, I take its average com- 
 positicm in former years. The analyses which have 
 been sent to our markets, with these manures and 
 guauos, are ioki.lly finwoj-lhij of credit and should n<jt 
 be relied on. Tlicre may be, and doubtless are cor- 
 rect analyses of the samples examined by the gentle- 
 men whose names are slgt'.ed to them, but they cer- 
 tainly do not represent the articles offered Jor sale Iterc. 
 In the following table the value ot the ammonia (in 
 manures which contain ii) is estimated by its eost in 
 good Peruvian guano, and the ])hosphates of iime by 
 its cost in bone dust. These are taken as a standard, be- 
 cause of their being be' ti-r and more universally known 
 than other articles. The calculation of positive value 
 is, therefore, very nearly- correct, and for comparison 
 precisely so. Tlius, if a ton of bones be worth Slid, 
 then Mexican guano is worth §121 20. Superphos- 
 phate (which is bones dissolved in oil of vitriol) 
 520 8t), without the labor necessarv to mix the mate- 
 rials, which is about SO; mineral phosphate of lime, 
 $2 . 40; and in the same way with other manures 
 whose chief valu? consists in bone phosphate of lime. 

And in the spring the following top dressing: Ni- 
 trate of soda 50 lbs. per .acre; common salt one to two 
 bushels per acre. 

These should be well pulverized, finely mixed, di- 
 vided into three equal parts, and sown broadcast on 
 the wheat in the spring at three dressings; the first 
 of which should be applied about the first of March, 
 or ,as soon as the wheat ccunmenoes to grow after the 
 cold weather of winter; the second ten or fifteen days 
 afterwards, and the third portion at abr ut the same 
 interval. 

This top dressing has been very fully tested on 
 wheat and grass in England and S.-otland, and pays 
 there, as stated in rep irts from the highest authority, 
 more than one hundred per cent, (m the outlay. It 
 makes a clean, strong, bright straw, increases the 
 weight, and adds greatly to the product of the grain. 
 I hope our farmers will u>o it on a small scale at 
 least, and test the success of its application in this 
 country, and I request all who do use it to f\irnish 
 me with the result. James IIiuuins, M. U.,

tu.so 
 As a substitute for Peruvian Guano, of which there 
 will be a very insufficient supply, I woidd recom- 
 mend, where the analyses which I have made and 
 published in my reports show a df^ficieney of phos- 
 ph iric acid, or on soils where bone dust or .Mexican 
 guano has proved useful, the following mixture: 

Mineral phosphate of lime 500 lbs., or ten bushels 
 of bone dvist (finely ground) to the aeie — to be 
 ploughed ur harrowed in with wheat in the fall. 

To Soften Putty. 

As it is often difficult for the Girdaner in repairing 
 his sash, to take out .he old putty, it will be well to 
 remember, that a rag dipped in a 8oIuti(jn of 8tr(mg 
 caustic potash or soda, and applied by laying on a 
 fewho'.rs previously, will soften it and make the re" 
 moval comparatively easy. 

To Curb Wounds in Fruit Trees. — The follow- 
 ing directions were published by William Forsyth, 
 King's Gardener in England, many years ago, and 
 have often been fou.id valuable: 

"Take one bushel of fresh cow dung, and a half a 
 bushel i^f lime rubbish from an cdd buildir.g, tliat 
 from the ceiling of rooms is preferable, half a bush- 
 el of wood ash.es, and two quarts of fine sand. The 
 last three articles to be silted fine, and then mixed 
 with the first, working them together until the mix- 
 ture is very smooth and soft, like plaster. 

The tree is to be prepared by carefully removing 
 all decayed or injured portions, down to the souml, 
 fresli wood, leaving the surface smooth, and rounding 
 off the edge of the bark very smooth. After this tlie 
 abov;; plaster is to be spread very carefully and 
 and smoothly over the cut surface and somewhat 
 beyond. Ttie plaster siionld be from an eighth 
 to half an inch thick, and smoothly and thinly 
 finished off at the edges. After the plaster his liem 
 spread, it should be dusted over with a mixture 
 of lour parts of dry ashes, to one part of tine sand 
 once in twenty or thirty minutes, until the iiioisturo 
 is all absorbed, and there is a smooth drv surface. 

The Wav to Plli. Turnip.s. — The Yankee grasps 
 the root by the top and pu'ls it with his hand, and 
 then cuts off the tops with a knife. The Englishman 
 has a better way. lie sharpens his hoc, ami p.aHsing 
 along, cuts with a single stroke, the tops of the turnip; 
 then with the same implement strikes umlor it so a.-i 
 to cut elT the roots, and brings it out of the earth, in 
 cutting off the tops he guides bis hoe so as to throw 
 them into a sort of ro v, in one place, and in di,;ging 
 ho guides it so as to throw the roots together in anoth- 
 er row. II'" will dig the roots about lour limes as 
 fist as one Yankee with his pulling and knife. —
