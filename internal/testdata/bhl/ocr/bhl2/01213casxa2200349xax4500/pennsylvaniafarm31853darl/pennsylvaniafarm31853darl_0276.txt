MADDER AND INDIGO -PEACH ORCHARD. 

[November 

Madder and Indigo. 

I have noticed thit von have endeavoi-VQil to di- 
 rect tlie attention of our cultivators to tlie raisinj; of 
 madder and of indigo. 

Madder, to afford a beautiful and permanent tint, 
 must lie raised in a noil coutainin;; a large portion of 
 calcareous earlli, tlie more the better. The Dutch 
 madder does not afford so beautiful a color, nor is it 
 as permanent as that raised at Aviprnon, in France. 
 The soil on which the latter grows contains fiftv-six 
 per cent, of fine limestone, the loimer not more than 
 ten per cent. Madder raised in tlie non-calcaroous 
 soil of Alsace. j;ives a ccdor of no permanency 
 or beaut.v ; but when raised in soil contain"; more 
 than ninety per cent, of lime earth, the roots give 
 faster and njore beautiful dyes than that of Avignon. 
 The natural soils of Kentucky and Illinois would 
 produce madder of very superior quality. About 
 the year 1817. when in Kentucky, I used some mad- 
 der raised in their gardens, and it proved to be of 
 excellent quality. It requires thiee years to i ring 
 madder to perfection, and I am afraid this will pre- 
 vent our cultivators from growing it, as few of them 
 would he willing to wait that time for returns. They 
 might, however, plant beds every year, and after the 
 first three years have annual crops. 

iNladder is raised in narrow be<ls, about four fuet 
 wide, for the convenience of keeping it free of weeds 
 — an operation necessary to the perfection of the 
 roots. In Kentucky they let the shoots grow to 
 about one foot high, when they lay i hem down and 
 cover them with soil, and tliese form new roots. 
 This may be repeated two or throe times in their 
 summer season. Those laid down the first year 
 make good roots for consumption when dug at the 
 end of the third season. They leave a a good space 
 between each bed to afford soil for covering the 
 shoots. At the Snal digging, rcots of the size of a 
 goose quill are laid by for grinding, and the smaller 
 ones are transplanted. 

■ To prepare madder for market, it is necessary to 
 stove-dry the roots and grind them, and these opera- 
 tii ns require considerable outlay, and expenenced 
 operators. In grinding, the outside cuticle is first 
 taken off, and this form-i what is known in the mar 
 ket as "muU-maddur." which is only u ed in dyeing 
 blacks, bottle-greens, and dark browns. The next 
 layer taken off is known as "ganiene," and is used 
 for a great variety of comuHm colors. The third is 
 known as "ombre," and the fourth as crop or "grap- 
 pe." Either of the last may be used fir rod dyes ; 
 but the "crop" give the most beautful c lor. 

JIadder roots are imported froui Saiyrna to Eng- 
 land, called Palcstioo madder, whio'i arc ground in 
 London. 

There are two colors extracted from maddi-r, when 
 boiled, a red and ii dingy yellow ; but wlien the red 
 alone is required the lii(U('r must bo kept bidoiv a 
 boiling heat. 

I.NDiGo. — Indigo is an annual crop; it is cut wlien 
 at maturity, p'aeed in a steeper, then covered with 
 soft water, and atones pl.aced on the plant to keep it 
 under the water. Itrcmai's steeping until the li- 
 quor becomes of a greenish yellow, with a copper 
 colored scum round the outside. The liquor is then 
 drawn into a receiver, and the workmen beat it with 
 long poles to oxydize the green fxcula, which will 
 then precipitate as blue imligo. 

Aljout the latter end of the year 1790, or the be- 
 ginning of ISOO, I owned a large dyeing fstablish- 
 ment in the vvest of England, eunsnmiug about <iur 
 hundred pounds of iudigo per week. At the date 

above mentioned I went to London to lay in a stock 
 for the blue vats ; among the lots offered were two 
 chests made in S mth Carolina, on the Pedee river, 
 ijy the late tjteneral Wade llimpton. Oii examining 
 them I founil it of ail.iep rich c ipper color.clean .and 
 smooth in the fracture, and as it was offered at one 
 shilling per pound cheaper than Bengiil of a si •■ ilar 
 quality, I bought them with several of the latter; 
 and as I expected, the quantity of coloring nmtter 
 xtracted from the South Carolina, was greater by 
 at least ten per cent, than from the Bengal. 

I emigrated to this country in the year 1H08, and 
 the following year I wrote to Gen. Wade Hampton 
 to know if he continued to make indigo and to in- 
 firm him of the superiority of the two chests 1 had 
 used. In his answer he informed me that he li;>d 
 given up the making of imligo, because cotton plant- 
 ing paid betier, and that indigo making so injured 
 the health of his slaves that some of them r.ever re- 
 covered their previous strength. The injury he com- 
 plained of is produced during the beating process; 
 for so rapid is the absorption of oxygen gas from the 
 atmosphere, during the operation, that those who 
 stand over it must be breathing an air with its vital 
 principle so diminished as to render it unfit to sustain 
 animal life. This diffi ulty might bo easily obviated 
 by letting the liquor from the steep into the receiver, 
 shorter and narrower than the b wer one, with a cul- 
 lender bottom made of zinc, and through it dripping 
 into the lower one called the beater. It wouiii re- 
 quire three or four feet between the two. I believe, 
 by this process, the green fcccula would be more 
 completely oxydized, and a better qualitj- of indigo 
 produceil than by beating. 

Those wdio prefer the old process could restore the 
 s-rength of their slaves liy the following siuiple op- 
 eration: — let them procure a twelve gallon graded 
 gasometer, and convey into it fir every three gallons 
 of atmospheric air, one gallon of o.xygen gas; by 
 breathing this increased vital iliiid a few times, the 
 whole of th" carbon that had increased in the blood 
 from breathing a non vital gis, would pass off, and 
 strength be restored. — [Scientific American.

An Immense Peach Orcharrd. — A gentleman 
 named D.ivis, residing in Clermont county, Ohio, ha* 
 a peach orclnvrd of 100 acres, contai .ing 17,003 trees. 
 Mr. Davis, it appears, left Philadelphia a lew years 
 ago and purchased his present farm^then consider- 
 ed the poorest one in the neighborhood — m I set it 
 out with peach trees of twenty different varieties 
 from New -Jersey. As the farmers in that vicinity 
 had tried for several years previous to raise poaches 
 for market, and had uniformly fai.ed tliey considered 
 the experiment of M.-. Davis a foolish one, and even 
 went so far as to appoint a committee to wait on him 
 and a ivise hiinto abandon it as it woulil ceriainly 
 ruin him. lie persevered, however, notwitliStanding 
 5,000 of the trees died soon after being planted.-— 
 This was six years ago. In li^SO he gathered his 
 first crop, frou> which ho realized sufii ient to pay for 
 hi'j farm and trees, and to leave him S-JOO on hand. 
 I'his season ab "it 5,000 of the trees are bearing, 
 and already 7,500 baskets have been sold at over SI 
 per basket. His net profits this season arc estimated 
 at S!25,000. 

It is said in the Ohio Cultivator that a bucket or 
 two of water given to a horse to drink just lief ire ri- 
 ding him, takes from him all dis|jo.-.ition for capering, 
 and venders Uim pjrlectly sedate.
