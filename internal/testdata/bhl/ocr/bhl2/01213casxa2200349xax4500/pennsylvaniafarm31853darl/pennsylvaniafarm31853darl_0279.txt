movable — sliding — being moved by a treadle opera- [ like a cushion, whereby the clothes are well rubbed, 

ted by the foot, to draw the cloth through regularly, 
 to present new surfaces to be rubbed. The movable 
 rubbers are of prepared india rubber, and are made 
 to be of a nature like the human hand — something 

with as little injury as possible to their texture. 

The machine has a large box with legs on it, a dis- 
 charge pipe at one end, and a soaping table to pre- 
 pare the soiled parts of the cloth, b, for the suds box,

there to be rubbed between the rubbers. A A are 
 the two inJia rubber cushion rubbers; they are se- 
 cured on the suspended arms, B B'; the one, B, is at- 
 tached to the other by a hinge, at a, to allow the two 
 rubbers to open, to let the cloth pass through between 
 them to be rubbed. The arms swing on an axis pin, 
 C, secured to the upright standards of the box. E E' 
 are the two fluted wash-boards under the rubbery A' 
 A; these boards are always close together when the 
 operator is pushing the rubbers back and forth by 
 the handle, F, and kept so by pressing with his foot 
 on the stirrup, which draws down the cord, H, and 
 draws forward the board, E, it being attached by 
 brass rods, G, to the crossbar, I, at one end, and at 
 the other by india rubber spring cords, X, secured to 
 the back of the box. AVhen the foot relieves the 
 stirrup, the spring cords, X, draw apart the board, 
 E, and this leaves a space between the boards to let 
 the rubbed clothes drop down into the suds box. To 
 do this, iind take a new surface lo be rubbed, the 
 rubbers, A A', which are like jaws, have to be thrown 
 apart — opened; this is done by slightly raising the 
 handle, F, as there is a shipper attached to the arm, 
 B, shown by dotted lines, c, fig. 2, which works in a 
 guide angle slot, 6 (fig 2), thus opening the space be- 
 tween the rubbers, to take in a new surface of cloth 
 over the small roller, e, and (eed it in towards the 
 centre, to be rubbed between the boards with tlie 

rubbers. Tho rubbers are closed by bringing the 
 arm, F, to a horizontal line. 

The fluted wash-boards can be elevated or lowered, 
 so as to bring them very near to, or a greater dis- 
 tance apart from the rubbers, and thus enable the 
 operator to wash a piece of lace or a quilt in the same 
 machine. The boards E E', rest on two side stretch- 
 ers, d d, which rest on a coiled spring, L L, at each 
 corner of the tub. J is the cross handle of a side 
 lever (one on each side) secured on a fulcrum pin, e, 
 at one end, and attached to vertical sliding blocks, 
 K K — one on each side — which rest onthestretchers, 
 d d, that support the wash-board. By pressing on J 
 with the hand, the operator depresses the wash- 
 boards:, E E', and graduates the distance between 
 them and the rubbers, A A', with the utmost nicety, 
 to wash any artiele^the most delicate or coarse. — 
 The action of this machine is like that of rubbing 
 clothes between the hands — the best principle yet 
 known; and it is the best washer that has ever been 
 brought to our notice. With the hand the operator 
 merely pushes the handle, F, back and forth, to rub 
 the clothes, and as the rubbers are poised on a centre, 
 this work is light and easy; with tho hand and foot 
 the clothes are rubbed, and the rubbers and boards 
 thrust apart and brought together so as to feed in new 
 surfaces, and deliver the clean clothes with great fa- 
 cility. The soap board is for the purpose of rubbing
