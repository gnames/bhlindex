I'l-ixe Essay on Pigs. 
 [continued from last number.] 
 The re-iperiire merits for conversion iulo fresh meat, 
 pickled pork, bacon and ham, with the aiudes of prc- 
 parinij the same. — In choosing a pig for any of the 
 purposes above enumerated, or, in fact, for any pur 
 pose, or of ail}' breed, there are certain points which 
 should be looked for in all, viz : — the skin should bo 
 soft and thin, of a, bright pink colour: the neck short, 
 the chest wide (which denotes strength of constitu 
 lion): broad, strjiight liack; short head, and line 
 snout; small legs and hoofs: the snout should bo 
 slightly curved upwards, .and, in the large breed, il 
 not unfrcquently happoi.s that there exists a pretty 
 prominent swelling on the snout between the nasal 
 and frontal bones : the sow should have at Iciisi 
 twelve teats. If properly supplied with food the pi;; 
 c:in be profitably sent to the butcher from the age ol 
 one month to four-:ind-twenty; itwould, therefcu'c, lit' 
 improper to piiss over in this place the rela'ivenlcrit^ 
 of the various breeds in prcjfitably rearing those lux 
 uries yclepi'd sucking pigs, which the late Charles 
 Lamb declares to be, "Of all the delicacies of the 
 whole miiiuhis cdibilis I will maintain this to be the 
 most delicate. I speak not of your grown porkers — 
 things between pig and pork, those hobliledehoys — 
 but a young ami tender suckling, under a mor)n old, 
 itc." I have already shown that the large English 
 breed are prolific and good mothers; th;it the Chinese 
 have an early aptitude to fatten, are piolifie, but bad 
 nurses; if, tliereforo, the object in breeiling is to gel 
 quit o( the progeny, about or socm after they have 
 arrived at lunar maturity, we should put a Chinese 
 l)oar to the largo English sow: if we want the hob- 
 bledehoys of eighteen or a score pounds weight, 
 which are to be seen so frequently in Leadcnhall 
 Market, we must breed the Neapolitan cross already 
 noticed, but which I shall in future define by the 
 term iuifu-ovcd Essex breed. Nodescription of breed 
 will raise sucking pig-* to the same size at six weeks 
 old c.s the cross just noticed : they also form excellent 
 porkers, speedily a t.aining a weiglit of 4S to 50 lbs. 
 (the favourite size for porkers) ; if allowed to grow 
 much larger, it will be fjund to pay better to treat 
 them as stores until they are It) or 12 months old, 
 and then put them up to fatten; in this way, how- 
 ever, they are not so profitable as the ini|)rov.a Essex, 
 iieilher do th.y make such fine bacon as the improv- 
 ed B u'kshire. Forthe purpose of obtiiinin:; moderate- 
 ly, or even largesized hams and bacon, nobreed stands 
 so high as the improved Berkshire, which m;iy bo con- 
 sidered the most generally useful to a farmer who 
 dcsirei a sort gencrafy profitable in any stage of its 

growth. The improved Berkshire sow will suckle 
 ton to a dcrzen sucking-pigs within a moderate period, 
 esp3cially if they are assisted by artificial meana 
 hereafter to be noticed; in this respect however it is 
 l)y no means equal to the improved Essex or the Old 
 English sow wlien put to a Chinese boar. For the 
 purpose of making fine delicate pickled pork, the 
 Berkshire is inferior only to the improved Essex; and 
 fiir the pur-'ose of mak.ng ham and bacon of mode- 
 rate siz^, viz., from 10 to 12 stones weight the car- 
 case — -not quite equal to the Essex at the former, but 
 pretty nearly so at the latter and increased weights. 
 The distinction here drawn arises from the fact that 
 the Essex breed, if properly maintained fnmi the 
 first, arrives very early at maturity, in so far as its 
 frame or bony structure is concerned, whilst the 
 Berkshire takes a longer period to arrive at its ulti- 
 mate and larger size; the consequence is, that a small 
 breed like the Essex will, with proper f)rcing, arrive 
 at its full natural size by the time it isO months old, 
 whilst the B;n"kshire takes 12 or fifteen months ere it 
 ceases to grow. Now, it is a well known fad, that 
 during the earlier stages of animal life the nutritive 
 parts of the food ingested by the animal and assimi- 
 lated by its organism, is .appropriated principally to 
 the developement of the frame, the growth of the 
 bones, tissues and muscles, together with a moderate 
 .imount of fat, the uses I'f which latter will shortly 
 be nocicod. Of the inorganicconstituents of the food 
 phosphate of lime is the one fir which there exists 
 the largest demand, constituting as it does so large a 
 portion of the gross weight of bones, from 15 per 
 cent, at birtli to 50 par cent, when aged, and enter- 
 ing more or less as a constituent of the muscles and 
 tissues. Of the nitrogenous portions of the food of 
 animals: the muscles, tissues, and gelatinous sub- 
 stances absorb the whole excess above the quantity 
 excreted. Of those articles of fi)od, whose chemical 
 composition consists of carbon and In'drogen, such 
 as starch, sugar, fat, &a., there can be little doubt 
 liut they, by their combustion, afford heat, and furth- 
 er, by the amount of their excess beyond that re- 
 quired fir the supply of animal heat, and not other- 
 u'ise excreteil, are assimilated by the animal system ia 
 iho form of fat, alsoai ingin the comfiosition of the 
 .('her animil substances, requiring, in addition to ni- 
 trogen; carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen lor their for- 
 mation, such as muscle, gelatine, itc. It forms no 
 part of this question whether lat is ivssimilated only 
 from fit which pre-existed in vhe animal's food, as 
 asserted by l)uu:as and Boussingault, or that fat is 
 formed from the starch of the food .as asserted by 
 Eiebig. According to all that is at present ascertain- 
 ed im this suliject, the dispute has little practical 
 bearing on the matter in Question: this much is how- 
 ever certa'n, that all parties concur in opinion tliat 
 animal heat is deriveil from the comliustion of the 
 carbon of the starchy matters in rested, and may be 
 so by the combustion of fatty matters; in fact, in 
 cases of fever and starvation, we know no other w,ay 
 how the animal heat is naintained than by thecum- 
 bustion of th(> fat previously stored up in the system. 
 The rapid diminution of we'ght in animal-: a'ta^ked 
 wit ' fever is well known, and is invarialjly coincident 
 with an increased circuhition of the blood and higher 
 animal tempia-ature. 

The preceding brief physiological diss?rtation is 
 inserted because, on the circumstauces just detaile<I, 
 in a great measure depend the relative qu\litiesof 
 the diflerent breeds for early or late fattening; ai d 
 hIso has a most important liearing on the kinds of 
 • food which ought tj be employed at the various pe-
