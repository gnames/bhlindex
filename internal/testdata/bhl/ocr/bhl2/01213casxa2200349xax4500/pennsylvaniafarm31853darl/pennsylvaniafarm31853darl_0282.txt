PRIZE ESSAY ON PIGS. 

[November 

The other form in which fresh pork is sold is when 
 the pig has arrived at a pretty mature state and fit 
 to make bacon. The only parts, however, sold as 
 fresh moat are the sparerib and loin, together with 
 eteak-pieces off the shoulder. Along with the loin 
 and sparerib some persons cut out the whole of the 
 ribs, but this is a bad practice, as the short ribs 
 greatly assist in curing the bacon, and should always 
 be left on the side. The ribs should be divided wi'ih 
 a saw midway between the breast and back bone; a 
 sharp knife should now be employed to cut out the 
 lean or muscular part of the neck and loin from its 
 exterior covering of fat, the cutter up having previ- 
 ously divided with a saw the large bone of the pelvis, 
 commonly known as the haunch or |aitch-bone. He 
 commences cutting at the neck, and makes a clean 
 cut down to the ham, leaving only a thin portion of 
 the muscle or lean part, about the thickness of a shil- 
 ling, attached to the fat or back part, as many more 
 cuts are made in the same direction as are required 
 to separate the joint up to the point where the ribs 
 had previously been divided by the saw. Steak 
 pieces for frying or making sausages and pies may 
 be now cut off the lean part of the hand, which per- 
 mits the shoulder-bone being easily separated. The 
 fore-shank may be either cut out or left in — if for 
 home use, it had better be cut out and used as pickled 
 pork. The ham can now be cut off, commencing 
 where the ham joins the flank, and cutting so that 
 the outside skin will form a circle or ellipsis with the 
 skin that lines the inside of the ham. This mode of 
 cutting up pigs is notmuch practised exceptforhome 
 curing, and for that purpose is without doubt, the 
 most profitable; it is also followed to some extent with 
 pork-butchers in Lancashire, Warwickshire, and 
 Staffordshire, who combine the curing and vending 
 of bacon and hams with that of pork-butchering.— 
 These are generally extensive retail dealers, though 
 there are some who confine themselves to the whole- 
 sale trade, in which case the loins and spareribs are 
 disposed of to retailers and general butchers, who 
 take a few joints to supply theircustomers with pork, 
 preferring this mode to slaughtering a pig, and thus 
 having the chance of the sides and" hams being left 
 on their hands to cure. A considerable quantity of 
 the joints of pork cut as described, and sold bj sales- 
 men at Newgate Market, are brought up by railway 
 from Birminghaili, being sent up by the wholesale 
 pork-butchers of that place. For home use, or where 
 a retailer has a demand for bacon and hams, there is 
 no method of cutting up a pig that economises the 
 meat so much, the lean of the neck and loin losing 
 greatly in weight during salting, especially if the 
 bone be anywise separated from the muscular part 
 so as to leave it bare. At Belfiist, the backbone be 
 ing first taken out, the ribs are afterwards out away, 
 the knife passing as close as possible to the rib, and 
 leaving as much of the muscular or lean part attach- 
 ed to the fat as such a separation will admit; this is 
 a wasteful mode, as the muscular part so left will not 
 weigh, when cured and dried, one-third of the weight 
 that it would do in the state of fresh meat; it is a 
 practice only justifiable in Ireland, where it is found 
 impossible to get rid of what is there termed the offal 
 in quantities anything proportionate to the amount 
 being continually made at the large slaughtering es- 
 tablishments. A better plan than the Belfast mode 
 is that followed in the west of England and south of 
 Ireland, in such places as Waterford, Cork, Carrick. 
 &c., in all which places it is the practice to singe the 
 pigs intended for bacon. I have not described the 
 mode of killing and scalding pigs, as that is gener- 

ally well understood, and a professed butcher is usu- 
 ally employed for the purpose; singeing is, however, 
 not so generally known. The pigs being first knock- 
 ed on the head, generally five or six in number, are 
 instantly drawn to a place immediately contiguous, 
 and placed with their necks over a trough prepared 
 to receive the blood; they are then stuck in the neck 
 with a knife in the ordinary manner; whilst they are 
 bleeding, a man with a fork distributes a thin cover- 
 ing of wheat or rye straw, the stronger the straw the 
 better for the purpose : in the absence of wheat or 
 rye straw furze and heather are used as substitutes. 
 At Waterford I have known wheat straw fetch 6^ 
 per ton for this purpose in the months of June and 
 July. The straw is now set fire to in the direction of 
 the wind; if the man sees that there is not enough, 
 he applies more to those parts requiring it, but in a 
 general way, with practice, the quantity required is 
 applied sufficiently at first, the tender having merely 
 to adjust the burning straw, taken from those parts 
 where it appears to be scorching the skin too much, 
 and putting it on those places where the fire appears 
 too little; this he does by using a common hay-fork. 
 When burned out, which is done in two or three min- 
 utes, the hogs are turned, and the underside, now up- 
 permost, undergoes the same operation : this com- 
 pleted, they are drawn with ropes and puUies on to 
 hooks, similar to those seen in all slaughterhouses. 
 The rough dirt, singed hair, &c., are now scraped off; 
 warm water being constantly thrown over the car- 
 cases, when another scraping commences. In a gen- 
 eral way three scrapings, one without and two with 
 water, have to be gone over before the skin is deemed 
 sufficiently cleaned. The cleaning finished, the en- 
 trails, viscera, &c., are taken out in the ordinary way, 
 water is thrown over the whole carcase inside and 
 outside and left to cool; in winter-time this will al- 
 ways occur withiu twenty-four hours. When cold, a 
 man goes round and cuts the heads off; he then takes 
 a knife and makes a clean cut from the tail along 
 the centre of the back-bone to the termination of the 
 neck, baring the whole of the vertebra}; he now takes 
 a sharp cleaver, and, beginning at one side of the 
 vertebrag, commences separating it from the ribs at 
 the point of their attachment. The other side is then 
 cloven in the same manner; by this means the verte- 
 bra are cut clear out; he then cuts the ham about 3 
 inches above the knee-joint. Thus divided, a side at 
 a time is carried to a table where another operator is 
 in readiness, who first makes an incision near the 
 neck, where the fore-ribs inosculate so largely with 
 the back-bone, commonly known as the breast-bone; 
 these, together with four or five pounds weight of the 
 pectoral muscle or breast, are cut out, as it is found 
 by experience that this part does not bleed well, fre- 
 quently containing several of the larger blood-vessels 
 still gorged with blood, especially in large pigs, and 
 in consequence is not well adapted for curing; it is 
 anactot precaution always to be recommended; it 
 has also the effect of baring the scapula or shoulder- 
 bone. The latter in ticklish weather is sometimes 
 fiuind a formidable difficulty in the way of good cu- 
 ring, or, as it is technically termed, striking the meat 
 and taking the salt, the former term applying to salt- 
 petre, and the latter to the common salt used. This 
 portion of the breast being taken out, the ribs are 
 divided with a fine saw at the points named in the 
 first described mode, viz., about the middle; the up- 
 per division is cut out with a portion of the muscle 
 attached to them, leaving the lower portion of the 
 ribs adhering to the side; in Ireland the piece so cut 
 out is called a strip, and weighs, according to the
