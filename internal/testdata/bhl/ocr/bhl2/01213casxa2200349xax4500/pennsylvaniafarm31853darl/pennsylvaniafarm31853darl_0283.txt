size of the pig, from two to four pounds weight; in 
 the west of England it is called the griskin, and 
 usually weighs from five to eight pounds; by way of 
 parenthesis it may be stated that the griskin is a 
 most delicious morsel. The cutter is provided with 
 a semi-circular saw; with this he destrously divides 
 the small knuckle rf the femoris or thigh-bone, and 
 detaches it along with the pelvis or haunch-bone. — 
 The muscle connected with the pelvis and a thin cut 
 from the upper part of the inside of the thigh are 
 taken out with the pelvis; by thismeans the awkward 
 joint which gives so much trouble to housekcopers and 
 others in curing hams is cut out, and the curer ob- 
 tains free access to the knuckle or superior extremity 
 of the thigh-bone in order to rub in the saltpetre and 
 salt; without this process it would be almost impossi- 
 ble to cure the whole side of a pig, viz., shoulder, 
 belly, back, and ham, in one piece. The difficulty of 
 saving hams from decay or fly-blows is well known 
 to consist principally in properly curing the joint in 
 question; it will, therefore, be apparent that if such 
 a difficulty exists in curing hams, it must be greatly 
 increased when the bulk of the ham remains attach- 
 ed to the side or flitch. These operations being com- 
 pleted, the side is carried to another table, where the 
 operator cuts off any straggling pieces of flesh, to- 
 gether with what may be considered superfluous on 
 the shoulder. Heis also provided with a sort of dull 
 iron chisel, to which a cord is attached which passes 
 over his neck, and with this chisel he separates the 
 scapula or shoulder-bone from the muscles attached 
 to it; this being completed, a small noose fmni an- 
 other short cord, also placed over the neck of tlie ope- 
 rator, is now fastened to the narrow and joint-end of 
 the bone; in doing so the workman has to bend his 
 body, the cord being made short expressly for this 
 purpose. 

In resuming the upright position he draws out the 
 shoulder, or as it is commonly called, the blade bone; 
 theforearm or knuckle may beeither left or taken out, 
 it is usually left with the side : the last operation is 
 sawing off the shank of the ham, whi.-h is done a 
 few inches above joint; the side is now fit for the ca- 
 rer. The rapidity with which all these operations 
 are performed quite astonishes the spectator who has 
 not previously seen a large establishment of this kind, 
 several of which in Ireland slaughter from 800 to 
 1000 large hogs per week during the season, viz., 
 from October to April. The head is sometimes cured 
 by separating the lower from the upper portion, the 
 lower part fori ing what is called the chap. The 
 more usual way is to split the head into two lateral 
 division.s and throw them into a strong pickle, same 
 as is used for forming pickled pork. The above de- 
 scribed mode is that usually adopted in the west of 
 England, and also in those parts of Ireland where 
 bacon is prepared for the London market in the west 
 of England fashion. The York method differs from 
 the west of England mode in having the ham detach- 
 ed from the flitch, and also in not cutting out the 
 griskin, leaving the whole of the ribs attached to the 
 side, only separating the back bone as previously de- 
 scribed. The h.am is cut either short or long, ac- 
 cording to taste; if cut long, the whole of the pelvis 
 or haunch-bone is cut out in connexion with the 
 thigh-bone and ham. The Westphalian ham is an 
 example of this method, and is the best mode for the 
 seller, as he gets the price of ham for a large portion 
 which would otherwise form a sort of offal or make 
 part of the flitch, and so only obtain the price of ba- 
 con. This form of ham is the worst for the consu- 
 mer, as the lower end contains a largo quantity of 

bone, and is only fit for boiling; it has also its disad- 
 vantages with the curer as it disfigures the flitch 
 very much, leaving a long narrow slip at the ham 
 end which can only be used fur melting down. On 
 the whole, therefore, the method of cutting the ham 
 short is the best: this is done by sawing the p Ivis 
 aliout the middle and cutting the ham in a circular 
 manner from that point. It is not customary with 
 sn:all p-gs to cut out any part of ihe ribs, but with 
 large pigs it is requisite to cut a portion out of the 
 fore-part, and also to draw out the blade-bone as de- 
 scribed in the west of England mode. With small 
 pigs, such as the improved Essex, this may be omit- 
 ted when they are only from 9 to 12 months old, and 
 having been previously well fed, as tlie curini' uf 
 bacon depends greatly on the latter named circ'iim- 
 stanoe; this, together with the fact that small bacon 
 and hams usually obtain the best price, other mat- 
 ters, as quality of meat, &c., being equal, is a strong 
 argument in favour of the smaller description of pig 
 in preference to the larger breeds ; also, as here 
 shown, the whole of the carcase can be converted into 
 marketable ham and bacon, without any deduction 
 for offal of much consequence.

The Fruit Committee respectfully" Report, That 
 since the August meeting of the Society, several in- 
 teresting collections of Fruits from various localities 
 have been presented for their examination. 

From Paschall Morris, of West Chester.— Two 
 specimens of a Pear, from a farmer near West 
 Chester. Size above medium, 2 13-10 inches long, 
 by 2i broad; obtuse pyriform ; greenish yellow,' 
 with some russet markings, especially at the inser- 
 tion of the stem, and a faint salmon'cheek; stem 1 
 inch by i, inserted somewhat obliquely in a small 
 superficial cavity, russetod, and slightly plaited; 
 calyx in a shallow basin, sometimes russeted ; seed 
 rather large, dark, flat; flesh of fine texture, but- 
 tery, melting; a little more flavor would be desira- 
 ble ; quality at least "good.'" 

From Amos L. Whitman, North Coventry, Ches- 
 ter county. Pa.— Throe varieties of Seedling Plums. 

1. Fruit an inch and a half long, by one and a 
 h.alf broad; obtuse cordate, suture indistinct; red 
 with a white bloom; stem five-eights to three- 
 fourths of an inch long, by one twelfth thick, in- 
 serted in an open, moderately deep depression; 
 flesh unadherent to the stone, of pleasant flavor, and 
 "good" quality. This variety appears to be won- 
 derfully productive; a twig three inches long by 
 one-sixth thick, contained eight Plums — another 
 two inches long by one-fourth tliick, contained 
 seven. 

2. Fruit an inch and a half long, by one five-six- 
 teenths ; obovate; purple, covered with blue bloom ; 
 stem eleven-sixteenth by one-sixteenth; quality in- 
 ferior, except for culinary purposes. 

3. Only one specimen— large, one three-fourths by 
 one eleven-sixteenth inches; roundish obovate; green- 
 ish yellow, mottled and dotted with white; suture 
 broad, extending one side from the base to the 
 apex; stem three-fourths by oi^e-twelfth, inserted 
 in a slight depression ; stone partially adherent. 
 The specimen being pi lied somewhat prematurelv,
