From Thomas Hancock, Burlington. N. .J.^Throe 
 boxes containin;; specimens of a i'lum, and thirty- 
 seven varieties of Pears. 

1. Driij) d' Or d' E.^psriii — a small, round, gidden 
 yellow Plum, with occasionally a few crimson dots; 
 stone un.ailhcreiit, quality "very good." | 

2. Cahol — specimens too much decayed to judge 
 of its quality. 

3. Si. Ghinlain — in good condition, "very good."

 "scarcely good." 

5 Muscadine — "good."

 fine appearance, similar in form to the Hosen 
 Schenck ; throe and three-eights inches long, by
