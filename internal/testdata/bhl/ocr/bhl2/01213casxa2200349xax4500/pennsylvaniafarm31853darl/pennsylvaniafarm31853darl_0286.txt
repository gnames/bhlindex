[November 

Fiom Dr. J. K. Eshelman: — A hox containing Jine 
 specimens of tweloe farieties of Pears, including the 
 Diller. f bo four following kinds were not in eating 
 condition: Calinka, Thompson, Mexican, and Doi/enne ] 
 Boussock. The variety brought for the Louise Bonne 
 de Jersey is not true, and is probably Capiavmont. 
 Barllelt, fine specimens, of "very good" quality. — 
 Dunmorc, "good." SI. Ohstlian, "very good." Fon 
 dante de Malincs, "very good." The Dnle of Bor- 
 deaux is the same as Dumas, Epine Dumas, and Belle 
 Epine Dnmas; quality "good." Hcioes, scarcely 
 "good"' specimens very small. The Diller — size be- 
 low medium; roundish-ovate; with one or more of the 
 longitudinal depressions or sutures seen in Dear- 
 born's Seedling; skin cinnamon russet; stem an inch 
 to an inch and a half long, by one-seventh thick, in- 
 serted by fleshy rings without depressions; calyx 
 open, set in a shallow, rather wide basin; seed small, 
 dark, with an angle at the blunt extremity; flesh 
 somewhat granular, buttery; possessing a fine per- 
 fumed flavor; quality "very good." Period of matu- 
 rity last of August. 

From Wm. S. Cleavinger, of West Philadelphia:— 
 Lar"-e and tine specimens of the Bartletl, from his 
 own garden, — and the noble Susquehanna Peach, 
 from llarrisburg, its original location. The Susque- 
 hanna is a Peach of the largest size, aboundi ig in 
 juice of a most delicious flavor: quality "best." 

From Caleb Cope: — Beautiful specimens of the 
 EliugeaTid Vermash Xertarines — remarkably fine in 
 appearance as well as in quality. 

From Dr. Arrott, of this city: — A Seedling Grape. 
 Size medium; round; greenish white; bunches small; 
 flesh pulpy; odor peculiar; flavor pleasant; quality 
 good; leaf trilobed. 

From Gerhard Schmitz:—A Seedling Grape.— 
 Large; oval; purple; bunches loose, large; resembles 
 the Isabella in appearance and flavor; quite equal to 
 it in quality, and perhaps a little earlier. 

From Charles Jones, through Mr. Allan W. Corson, 
 Mimtgomery County: — Large and fine looking speci- 
 mens of the Vandiver Apple, not ripe. 

From Isaac Garrettson, through Mr. Alan W. Cor- 
 son, Montgomery County : — Handsome specimens of 
 a small; pleasant, half breaking Pear, grown on the 
 premises of Mrs. Rachel Maulsby, which we regard 
 as the Gros Ronsselet, and which, by the London 
 Horticultural Society, is deemed unworthy of culti- 
 vation. 

From Samuel Owern, Steward of the Girard Col- 
 lege: — Remark;\ble fine specimens of the Seclcel 
 Pear, grown on the College premises. 

From Mrs. John B. Smith: — Two varieties of 
 Pears. 

1. The Moyamensing — The fruit of this variety re- 
 mains only a short time in perfection; but this defect 
 is compensated by its ripening in succession, for a 
 considerable period. When eaten at the exact mo 
 ment of its maturity, the flavor is delicious, and the 
 quality "best." 

2. Poire d'Abondance — This little Pear is always 
 beautiful, and a most abundant bearer; quality some- 
 times "good," occasionally "very good," very often in- 
 different. In the "Fruit and Fruit Trees of Ameri- 
 ca," D'Abondance, D' Amour, and Ah Mon Dieu, are 
 considered one and the same Pear. In appropriating 
 these names to a single variety, Mr. Downing follow- 
 ed, and was misled, by the Catalogue cf the London 
 Horticultural Society. But so far from being identi- 
 cal. Poire d'Amour and Poire d'Abondance are two 
 entirely distinct varieties, differing essentially in ,><ize, 
 form, color, and period of maturity. The fruit of the 

former is very large, while that of the latter is small. 
 The error of considering them identical probably 
 arose altogether from the fact that the name, Ah Mon 
 Dieu, was an acknowledge Synonym of both. It is 
 stated, however, on the authority of a distinguished 
 French Pomologist, that this appellation was given to 
 each for a very different reason — to one, in conse- 
 quence of its beauty and productiveness — to the oth- 
 er, on account of its enormous size. 

From William Canby, Wilmington, Delaware : — A 
 Seedling Grape. Bunch four and ^ half inches long, 
 by two and three-quarters broad, so compact as fre- 
 quently to destroy the rotundity of the berry. Berry 
 from seven-sixteenths to nine-sixtenths of an inch in 
 diameter; roundish, inclining to oval; skin of a violet 
 color, thickly covered with bloom, and semi-diapha- 
 nous; seed small, dark cinnamon; flesh tender, very 
 juicy, not pulpy; flavor sweet and pleasant; quality 
 "best" for a grape that will grow in open culture. — 
 Leaf trilobed but not deeply, interruptedly serrulate, 
 auriculate. 

On motion, resolved, that the Pennsylvania Horti- 
 cultural Society hereby offer a premium of one hun- 
 dred dollars fiir an ett'ectual and economical remedy, 
 which shall prove satisfactory to the Society, against 
 the ravages of the curculis. 

From the NV-w England Farmer, 
 The Marrow !>quasli. 

Frien'd Brown: — In the September No, of the Far- 
 vier, M. Ten'ny, of South Groton, asks some of your 
 correspondents to givehim infin-mation about cultiva- 
 ting the marrow squash. For the information of 
 friend Tcnny, I will give you my experience in rais- 
 ing them. My neighbors can testify to the quantity 
 as Well as quality of my squashes and other vegeta- 
 bles. Much depends upon the manner of planting 
 squash seeds, as well as all other seeds, to ensure 
 good crops. Every man's motto should be, "work 
 the soil deep," and with the blessing of God, I shall 
 have vegetables to sell and to keep. AVhen I have 
 planted my squash seeds after tlie following rule, I 
 have never failed of being well paid for my labor, 
 viz;_Dig the holes 16 or 18 inches deep, three feet 
 broad and seven feet apart; throw the top soil on one 
 side, and the bottom soil on the other side of the 
 holes. After digging as many holts as I wish to 
 plant hills, I return the, top soil to the bottom of the 
 holes, and then take one bushel or more of well pul- 
 verised manure, one peck leached ashes, ftr each hill, 
 and with a spade or shovel mix well together from 
 top to bottom. Then plant the seeds, leaving the top 
 of the hills level with the surface of the ground, and 
 keep them so during the season. When they are up, 
 and the bugs have done troubling them, thin them 
 out, leaving two or three stocks in each hill, which 
 will cover the ground before the summer is ended. I 
 intended to have said something aliout planting and 
 raising other vegetables, but will leave that for an- 
 other paper. Yours truly, 

Anset, IIolm.w. 

Dn. PROUT has shewn that all our principal ali- 
 mentary matters may be reduced to three classes: 
 the saccharine, the oleaginous, and the albuminous, 
 represent by butter, sugar and white of egg. Now, 
 milk consists of all three — ^the curd which is chiefly 
 albumen; the butter, chiefly oil ; and a portion of 
 sugar. Milk is the only substance prepared by na- 
 ture so completely perfect as to be a compound of 
 these principles, and therefore its perfection, mixed 
 with bread, as a food for children.
