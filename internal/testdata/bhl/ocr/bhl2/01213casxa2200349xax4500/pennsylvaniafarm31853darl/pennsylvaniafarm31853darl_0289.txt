Montezuma was bred by John Worth, near West 
 Chester, got by "Yorkshireman," dam "Virginia" 
 by "Henry Clay" gr. dam "Strawberry Girl" impor- 
 ted from England by Paschall Morris. "Yorkeshlrc- 
 man" was purchased in England by Joseph Cope, of 
 Thomas Bates, Kirklcavington, by whom ho was 
 bred, and whose stock now commands in England 
 the highest prices. "His Grace the sire of "Rose Bud" 
 was purchased by Paschall Morris, at Whittakcr's sec- 
 ond said in 1838 for §550. The opposite engraving 
 by Clarkson is a very lair likeness of this superior 
 young Bull, whoso pedigree indicates some of the 
 best blood now in the country. He is very good in 
 the loin and hind quarter, and what in a southdown 
 would be called the twist. The artist has succeed- 
 very happily in catching the ciprcssion of counte- 
 nance generally so difficult. His mild eye indicating 
 gentleness of disposition, is a point on which we 
 have always laid great stress. In the scale of points, 
 originating with our friend F. Rotch of New York, 
 and adopted, by the State Agricultural Society, it 
 says: "The eye is of great significance, and should 
 be prominent, bright and clear, "prominent" from an 
 accumulation of "adeps" in the back part of its sock- 
 et, which indicates a tendency to lay on fat: "bright" 
 as an evidence of good disposition, "clear" as a guar- 
 antee of the animals health: whereas a dull slug- 
 gish eye belongs to a slow feeder, and a wild restless 
 eye, betrays an unquiet, fitful temper." The whole 
 8calc of points for Durhams, Dovons and other breeds 
 was published in the May number of the Farm Jour- 
 nal, and is very useful for reference. Although prob 
 ably no one individual has ever combined them all, 
 yet in erecting such a standard for comparison, re- 
 sulting as it did from the close observation and long 
 experience, of our friend Rotch, and confirmed also 
 by other eminent breeders, we think a good service 
 has been rendered to the whole country. It ia a scale 
 R-hich should bo understood and studied by those 
 obout to purchase, and is the most, if not the only re- 
 liable written standard we have. "Mars though 
 young, and not fully matured, yet comes well up in 
 the "scale of points" already and when his form ia 
 fully developed, will embrace the most of thera. Ilia 
 owner offers him for sale. Price $500.

The Grape Culture in the West. 
 A condensed account for the Farm Journal. 
 The Grape crop in the Ohio Valley, "the Rhine of 
 America," is unusally well ripened, juicy andsweet, 
 this season. The vineywds are generally located on 
 the slope of the Ohio River; and nine tenths of them, 
 are cultivated by Germans who have devoted their 
 lives to the business, — each family taking charge of 
 some fifteen or twenty acres, usually for one haW 
 the proceeds. 

There are about fifteen hundred acres devoted to 
 vine growing in Ohio: five hundred in Missouri; three 
 hundred in Indiana; one hundred in Illinois; and the 
 same in Kentucky. Some of the Vineyards will 
 grow this year eight hundred gallons of Wine per 
 acre. The fruit is purchased by the Wine manufac- 
 turers at from five to six dollars per hundred pounds^ 
 it is then washed and pressed, and the juice placed in 
 wine vaults or cellars to undergo slow fermentation. 
 At the end of twenty months the "sparkling Civ 
 tawba" is ready for market. 

To give an idea of the extent of some of these wine 
 cellars, it may be stated that Mr. Nicholas Longworth, 
 has three, one of which will turn out annually fiftjr 
 thousand bottles, another one hundred thousand, and: 
 a third an equal amount of "dry wine." Portions of 
 the cellars are occupied by immense tanks, one of 
 which holds five thousand gallons. 

The American wines are of two general varieties, 
 the "still" and the "sparkling," The first is wine thai'- 
 undergoes vinous fermentation, or the process which. 
 transforms the sugar of the grape into alcohol. To 
 produce a sparkling wine, a second fermentation i« 
 excited, by adding a little "rock" candy, and the al- 
 cohol is transformed into carbonic acid gas. Thu»,. 
 Western wine, can be relied on as the pure and iin- 
 adulteraled juice of the grape; and the substitution 
 of it for the drugged liquors of foreign iraportatiott 
 is a most important and desirable object to be gained. 
 Even where the manufacture of pure wines is attemp- 
 ted in the hot countries of Europe, it is necessary to 
 to mix brandies with them to make them keep, which, 
 is not done here Americans are not yet prepared to 
 properly appreciated the value of pure wines, be- 
 cause they so rarely find their way acniss the Atlan- 
 tic. In the wine districts of Europe brutal intoxi- 
 cation is comparatively unknown, or any of the ef- 
 fects resulting from intemperate drinking. A 
 drunken vine dresser is never seen. 

In selecting a location for a vineyard a hill with 
 a southern exposure and a dry calcareous soil, with, 
 a porous sub soil, is preferred. Wet or !=pangy lands 
 are avoided. The cuttings should contain at least 
 four joints, and be taken from wood well ripened; 
 should be set out in a slanting position, with the t<>p- 
 eye even with the surface of the gn.und, though cov- 
 ered witli half an inch of light mould, if the weather 
 is dry, Pruning is done from November to March,
