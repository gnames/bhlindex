For potting earth, mix well decayed Bods, with 
 short manure, equal parts of each. Plants in win- 
 dows should be turned around oni'Q a week, to pre- 
 vent growing one sided. Timely hints will be given 
 how to treat plants through winter. 

VEGETiULE Garde.v. — Dig or plough up ground 
 for next years crop, trenching with spade or subsoil 
 plow. The exposure to frost and alternate freezing 
 and thawing, mellows the soil aad destroys weeds 
 and insects. Cut oft Asparagus tops close to the 
 ground, and clear out thoroughly, all weeds. Spread 
 manure over the bed three inches deep, covering 
 slightly with earth from the alleys. These should 
 also be manured, the whole to be forked in and spad- 
 ed in spring. Take up and secure before severe 
 frosts. Beets, Carrots, Salsify, Turnips, &c. Place 
 them in moderate sized heaps out of doors, covering 
 first with straw, and then with a few inches of earth, 
 or if cellar room is convenient, they may te placed 
 in barrels or casks, mixing earth through them and 
 coverin" with sods. Have shutters or straw mats at 
 hand for covering cold frames of Cabbages, Cauli- 
 flowers, &c. These should be inured to cold, by ex- 
 posing in moderate weather, covering only at nights. 
 Give air to forcing frames to prevent plants from 
 drawing. Take up Cabbages, arranging them in 
 beds, and burying roots and lower leaves in earth; 
 cover with boards, straw or cornfodder on approach 
 of severe weather. Dig up Celery, and for winter 
 use, place in beds, planting the first row against a 
 ridge, then fill in earth nearly to the top, then ano. 
 ther row of Celery, leaving four or five inches of 
 earth between each row. Cover the out side row 
 with straw or manure, and a good covering of straw 
 or cornfodder over the top. Manure Rhubarb beds 
 with a heavy coat, both on plants and in alle 
 which should be dug in the latter; cover with straw> 
 litter or cedar brush, &,a., — ^Lettuce, Spinach, Corn 
 Salad and Parsley. Take up Horse Radish, and 
 lay away in sand or earth for winter use. Dig up 
 Parsnips for early consumption, and place in barrels, 
 covering with sod. Collect and preserve Pea sticks, 
 Bean poles, &c. Gather up Cabbage stumps and all 

other rubbish, and haul to the manure heap.

Short Directions for Planting Tr<;e8. 

Remove all bruised or injured roots, by cutting 
 them from the under side with a sharp knife. Dig 
 the holes at least twice as large as the roots extend, 
 80 as to allow them easy access in their starting to 
 the loose earth, which should be finely pulverized; 
 when the hole is half filled, pour in a few gallons of 
 water, which has a tendency to settle the earth and 
 fill up vacancies. Bo careful to avoid lilting the tree 
 up, while filling in, which fends to give the roots a 
 vertic '1 and unnatural position. Let the Soil in con 
 tact with the roots be the surface soil first thrown out, 
 or rich loam, obtained expressly, would be better. — 

Leaf mould, from the woods, is excellent. Lot no 
 manure be put into the hole, around the root, which 
 is apt to induce decay. If any is app'ied, let it be 
 on the surface, to be carried down by rains. The fall 
 of the yearis a sui^ablo time for surlace manuring 
 around trees. Let the trees be well staked and tied 
 up, to prevent being shaken or disturbed by the 
 winds. After culture and periodical judicious pru- 
 ning are also important. As a general rule, orchards 
 should be kept ploughed and cultivated to insure fine 
 fruit and good crops. Where this is not practicable, 
 trees should be dug round and kept free from grass 
 and weeds. Avoid especially deep planting; when 
 the earth settles, the tree should be about the same 
 depth as before removal. 

Mulching all trees the first season they are trans- 
 planted, by covering the ground around, two or three 
 feet each way, with grass or coarse hay, litter, &c., 
 is very important to secure success. It preserves an 
 even temper.ature in the soil, keeps it damp, and pre- 
 vents, to some extent, damage from sudden changes 
 of weather. 

Peiiiisylvauia Pears. 

We arc pleased to observe some of our Pennsylva- 
 nia seedling fruits have proved weU.cven so farnorth 
 as Bojton, and are properly appreciated, notwith- 
 standing their origin south of New York. The last 
 number of Ilovey's Magazine contains engraved out- 
 lines with commendatory notices of five ot our Pcnn 
 sylvania seedlings, which have been fruited there 
 viz: Brandy wine, Petre, Kingsessing, Ottand Secklo, 
 Of the Brandywine, which originated a few miles 
 from West Chester where the tree is now growing, 
 the editor says, "the qualities of the Brandywine 
 are peculiarly its own, and cannot be compared vrith 
 any other variety. Its flesh is slightly firm, yet per- 
 fectly melting, and its flavor, without being highly 
 perfumed, appears to be a concentration of that of 
 several sorts, beingalmost as sugary as the seckle, yet 
 relieved by the refreshing aroma of the Marie Louise, 
 and the champagne smack of the D'Areraberg. It is 
 as distinct in character as the seckel." 

To Prevent Mire and Rabbits from Barking Trees. 

An article has been going the rounds of the pa- 
 pers, copied we believe originally from '"Dicken's 
 Household Words," of a horse M'ho was accustom- 
 ed to barking any tree-i he was tied to, and who on 
 commencing operations on one, which had previous- 
 ly been washed with t/jbacco juice, flew back with 
 such violence, as .almost to break his halter. As 
 this weed is known to be exceedingly offensive to ev- 
 ery animal but one, it has occurred to us if it might 
 not be effectually applied in the same way, to pro- 
 tect trees from Mice and Rabbits, by washing the 
 trunks with it near thognmnd. It is worth at least 
 a trial.
