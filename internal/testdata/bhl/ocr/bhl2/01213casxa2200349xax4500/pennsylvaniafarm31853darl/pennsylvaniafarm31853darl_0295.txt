Mauagemeut of FAT STOCK by the Butcher bo- 
 fore being Slaughtered. 

As the practice of selling fat cuttle, by their live. 
 weight deducting a certain per centago lor loss, iu 
 offal, is becoming very general among our feeders, 
 we copy the following article from the English Agri- 
 cultural Gazette, which contains some valuable hints, 
 no less for the Farmer than the Butcher and consum- 
 er. The supply o( healthy meat, to a population like 
 that of Philadelphia, is of great importance, and de- 
 pends very much on the treatment cattle are subject- 
 ed to in the drove yards, immediately before going 
 into the hands of the Butcher. The account in our 
 last number of the abuses of the cattle yard in New 
 York, should arrest the attention of eity authorities. 
 The inspection of meat now we believe, extends only 
 to its exhibition in the shambles. What is positive- 
 ly offensive, and in a state of decomposition, is con. 
 demned by tho inspectors, and would be rejected 
 without them. But there is reason to believe, a large 
 amount of unwholesome meat, is in that condition be- 
 Jore being slaughtered, and no doubt is tho unknown 
 cause of disease. The inspection to be thorough and 
 effectual, should extend to the drove yards, no less 
 than to the shambles. In travelling over England 
 and Scotland, for some 3 or 4 months, (and we have 
 heard of similar remarks by others ) we do not recol- 
 lect of meeting on either public orprivate tables, with 
 tough or stringy beef or mutton. Although we have 
 occasionally in our country as fine, tender moat, as 
 is ever seen there, it is not of that incariabhj good 
 character. There is more, much more of a differont 
 kind met with here, than there is in England. The 
 reason we have no doubt, is owing to a better under- 
 standing there, of tho scientific rationale of feeding 
 and fattening, and after' manaf/emeni. 

The feeding and management of f.\t stock imme- 
 diately prior to being slaughtered, it is asulject <(uite 
 as interesting to the farmer as to the butcher; tor if 
 the whole weight which left the feeding-biix, were 
 placed in the scales, the former would he a gainer 
 by the difference between this weight and that of the 
 carcase when shuightered— tlie actual weight which 
 the latter now pays for. There tire two very im- 
 portant practical questions involvetl in this subject. 
 The one relates to the daily amount of waste which 
 takes place under tho various modes of management 
 during marketing froi" the time stock leaves home 
 until led to to the slaughter-house; and the other re- 

lates to the quantity tind quality of food which ought 
 to bo consumed during that period. 

What, for instance, is the daily waste upon an ox 
 of 100 imperial stones, carcass weight, when sent to 
 the metropolis, between tho time it leaves home un- 
 til slaughtered, and what the quantity and quality 
 of food which such an ox ought to consume, and tlie 
 treatment it should otherwise receive, so as to main- 
 tain it at this weight undeterioratod in quality? The 
 amount of daily waste will depend very much upon 
 the constitution of the animal, the statoof the weath- 
 er, food and treatment prior to leaving home, as well 
 as upon the food and treatment between homo and 
 the shambles, consequently, from the diversity of 
 constitution, food and treatment, there may scarcely 
 be two animals in Smitlifiold of this weight, whose 
 daily wajte is equal. A five-year-old Highlander or 
 Galloway, for instance, txccustomed to exercise, ex- 
 posure, and inferior food, may lose little more, com- 
 paratively speaking, than the ordinary daily waste 
 in the straw yard, prior to leaving home: and this to 
 a certain amount may be repaired by the quantity 
 of hay consumed — a species of food somewhat bet- 
 ter than many of this class are yet accustomed to at 
 home, while on the other hand, the quickly grown 
 short horn or Hereford, accustomed to better food and 
 treatment, and which has attained to this weight by 
 the time it has completed its second year, will be in 
 a verv diflerent position, for at this age their bones 
 will be comparatively green, their hoofs soft and ten- 
 der, and their whole system in an artificial state, de- 
 manding treatment very differont from that which 
 they generally receive. In two examples of this 
 kind tlie latter may lose weight at the rate of 2 im- 
 perial stones daily, while the former may not exceed 
 1. And differences almost as great may exist in this 
 respect between individuals ot any one breed. Some 
 short horns, for instance, of the best syinuietry, are 
 very active and hardy, and easily satisfied as to qual- 
 ity of food; and, therefore, the daily waste upon them 
 may not he the hall of what it is in others of the 
 same breed possessing inferior constitution; and the 
 same will be found true of llerelords, Devons, Gallo- 
 ways, &c. 

Tlie f lod and treatment of the ox between the stall 
 and the shambles is a more complex question, b?ing 
 surrounded by many more difficulties, than that of 
 daily waste. As a general rule it may be laid down 
 that the ox shtnild receive tho same species of fuod 
 after it leaves home, until within 1'2 hours of being 
 slauMitered, that it has licen accustomed to; and that 
 wliere Turnips, oilcake, &c., aie given — articles which 
 afiect the quality of the butcher-meat when slaugh- 
 t_pj.,,;j — these should Ije changed before leaving home, 
 and otiiers, such as bruised oats or other corn, sub- 
 stitiitoil iu their place; also that ^rc((//«f«raff(M' leav- 
 ing home should be as similar to treatment before it 
 as possible. 

The rutioniile of this practice is sufficiently obvious. 
 It is that which is endeavored to be carried out at 
 all our great cattle shows, and the difficulty there ex- 
 perienced is to get cattle to consuun^ a suftieioney of 
 fund. Pampered nature overloaded w-ith fit, ever 
 active to meet the exigencies of her situation, feels 
 rather disposed to throiv off tho burden tlian mivin- 
 tain it at so overpowering a weight, ami the same 
 laws will regulate her conduct between the feeding- 
 bex of the firmer and the slaughter-house of the 
 butcher. The progress lately made amtmgst farmers 
 in the art of feeding, both as regards food and house- 
 hold accommodation, ami tlie early maturity of bi'eedu 
 and tho change in our commercial policy affording
