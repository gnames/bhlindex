Producers and Consumers. 

Whatever may be thought about the expediency of 
 the almost numberless ^t()-/!t'« into which the people 
 of the United States are divided, particularly ef our 
 friends ir. the great state of Nevr Yorls, there are at 
 last but two really yreat parties in this country, and 
 it is with these only tliat a Farm Journal has any- 
 thing to do, viz : producers and consumers. A visi- 
 tor in Philadelphia, on either of the two principal 
 market days in the week, upon seeing the miles of 
 produce, fish, flesh, fp a1 and vegetable, &c., in every 
 conceivable variety, along the great thoroughfares_ 
 would almost wonder how they could be all absorbed 
 and the farmers be able to bend homeward with 
 empty wagons. We copy below a few statistics of 
 the consumption of a single one out of the many ho- 
 tels in New York, which will give some idea of the 
 ■way provisions are made to vanish, and which we 
 think will be interesting to our readers. We take 
 it from the New York Herald and the hotel alluded 
 is the "Metropolitan." It says: 

"There is one continual round of ieasting from 
 morning till ^ night, or rather from morning tdl 
 morning again. The first breakfast table is 
 spread at five o'clock in the morning, and until I 
 o'clock the nest morning the different meals are 
 served; at every hour of the day or night, the travel- 
 lers arriving or departing can supply the inner man 
 with every luxury the markets afford. The frequent 
 arrivals and departures of trains and steamers makes 
 this indispensable. The consumption of solids and 
 liquids at this establishment, during the year ending 
 September 1, 1853, shows ihat the proprietors mast 
 have had a small army to provide for. It also shows 
 that they have given them all the luxuries, as well as 
 the necessaries of life. The commissary department 
 of the Metrop(ditnu is a very important one. Among 
 the leading articles of consumption we notice: 

Beef, 418,0(10 lljs., lamb and mutton, 3,500 head; 
 veal, 150 head; fish and lolister, 110,000 lbs.; oysters 
 and clams, 020,000: poultry and game, 171,000 head: 
 ham and pork, 01,000 lbs."; eggs, 780,000; milk and 
 cream, 204,000 quarts; flour and corn meal, 2,000 
 bbls.; fruits and vegetables, value, §20,000; brandy 
 and other liquors, 0,322 gallons; champagne, 21,100 
 bottles; sherry, Madeira, &c., 22,912 bottles; claret 
 and white wines, 18,942 liottles. Thisis independent 
 of malt liquors, cordials, cooking wines, itc. 'I he 
 beef consumed last year in this house required a 
 drove of one thousand head to supply. When we 
 consider that this number was re()uired for one hotel 
 in this city, we can form a pretty good idea of the 
 immense herds it must require to supply such a 
 jiopulation as New York contains. This, on 'oubted- 
 ly, will astonish the Vegetarian Society, and perhaps 
 provide more efi'ective arguments in favor of cabbage 
 heads and cold slaugli. The enumeration of these 
 items, although comprising but a small portion of the 
 articles consumed shows that the annualexpei\ditnres 
 must be immense, and that large receipts arc! neces- 
 sary to furnish means to meet such an outlay. This 
 luxury and cxtrav.iganco civnnot be supported with- 
 out great cost, and the guests who pay bills with 
 ' alarming totals, must not suppose for a moment that 
 it all goes into the proprietors' pocket. 

The gross cash receipts of the Metropolitan Hotel 
 for the year ending .September I, 18)3, were ?')00,- 

000, of which about 20 per cent, were profits. This 
 is independent of wear and tear, which is by no 
 means a small item, particularly with such splendid 
 and expensive furniture and appointments. Thecost 
 of heating the house and tlie gas consumed, during 
 the year, was SI4,0t)0. Croton water rent, ?1,000. 
 Six stages and 20 carriages are constantly employed 
 in transporting passengers to and from the hotel. — 
 During the year several public dinners were given at 
 thii house, the last of which was the Crystal Palace 
 banquet. Two splendid balls were given, one by the 
 proprietors and one by the guests, besides this a hop 
 has been given on Wednesday evening of each week 
 throughout the dancing season. It requires men with 
 talents of no ordinary character, and pockets of no 
 ordinary depth, to put into operation and c;irry out 
 successfajly, such an immense establishment, and 
 we are j^ad to learn that the Messrs. Leland, in ev- 
 ery particu ar, have realized their most sanguine an- 
 ticipations. Their house is literally the Metropolitan 
 of the metropolis. The Crystal Palace and other at- 
 tractions in New York have drawn thousands of 
 strangers to the city, and all the hotels, both great 
 and small, have been crowded, and the proprietors 
 have been coining money." 

Great Discovery iu Tanning teather. 

lu our September number, we gave some account 
 of a now process of tanning leather, discovered by a 
 Mr. Preller. Like all very extraordinary events, 
 it was received no doubt with a good deal of incre- 
 dulity, but in a late number of the London Garden- 
 ei's Chronicle, we see it has been pretty fully tested, 
 and promises to be a highly valuable process. The 
 editor of the Chronicle expresses the opinion, it will 
 have a serious effect on the owners of wjodland prop- 
 erty in Great Britain, by depreciating the price of 
 bark. It says: 

"This method of treatment is so remarkable for 
 its originality, and attended with such excellent ad- 
 vantages in the course of manufacture, and in the 
 character of the produced article with reference to 
 the requirements of practice, as to promise nothing 
 short of a complete revolution in the arts of the tixn- 
 ner, and the establishment, to a certain extent, of 
 new criteria by which the qualities and value of 
 leather for practical purposes are henceforth to be 
 estira;vted. A large factory in Lant Street, Snuth- 
 wark, has been fitted up by Mr. Premier, and he is 
 there carrying on his manufacture to a very consid- 
 erable extent, and with a degree of success which 
 could hardly have been supposed would attend his 
 efforts in the comparatively short time wliicli has o- 
 lapsed since he began, itis leathers have already 
 acquired a high reputation in the market, and are 
 rapidly getting into favor for a variety of manufac- 
 turing" purposes, especially for driving-bands, for 
 which their superior strength, flexibilitv, uniformity 
 of texture, aud durability, render them eminently 
 serviceable." 

The difference in quality of the skins thus treated, 
 and such as have been tanned with Oak bark. Cat- 
 echu, or similar substances, is represented to bo stri- 
 kingly in favor of the patent process. 

Tlie peculiar mrrils of Prei.i.ek's method are said 
 to be these. It reduces the weight of leather, and at 
 the same time increases its strength; and this takes 
 place to such a degree that "it has been found that
