TANNING LEATHER— GDANO." 

] November 

Oak-tanned leather of S-Sths of an inch in thickness 
 is incapable of resisting a strain which Preller's 
 leather l-4th of an inch in thickness will resist in 
 constant working. A strip of it a yard long, about 
 half an inch in width, and 1-Sth thick, gave way 
 with a breaking weight of 6 cwt. '?0 lbs. ; while ox- 
 hide, well tanned on the Oak-bark system, and of the 
 eame dimensions, could only resisist a strain of 5 
 cwt. As anothur illustration of the superior strength 
 of Mr. Preller's leather for driving-bands, we may 
 mention a circumstance which was told us at the fac- 
 tory, that on one occasion, to lengthen a driving- 
 band made of his own leather, he added to it a piece 
 of Oak-tanned, and that the latter gave w:iy in the 
 performance of its work. Sheep-skins, kid-skins, 
 and some other species of leather, which in general 
 may be torn asunder in the hands with the exercise 
 of only a small degree of force, acquire in this pro- 
 cess a strength whicli is quite surprising, of which 
 vre had expeiience ourselves when a piece of split 
 sheep-skin, of lage size, w's put into our hands, and 
 we were requested to try to break it," 

Another great advantage in Preller's process, is 
 represented by tlie same authority to consist in sav- 
 ing time in the process of preparing. "The thickest 
 ox-hide requires only two days and a half to be fully 
 converted by the application of this process, of which 
 Mr. Preller showed us an example in the hide of a 
 large prize ox exliibited at the late cattle show. 
 Under the most favorable circumstances, it now re- 
 quires four or five weeks' subjection to the tanning 
 liquor. Under the old process of tanning, in which 
 the hides were placed in the pit, with layers of tan 
 to separate them, and afterwards filled with water, 
 a very considerable period has been known to elapse 
 during the process: sometimes amounting to four 
 years. . This old fashioned method has not been yet 
 completely abandoned for more scientific ones, and 
 contrasted with it the great change which this inven- 
 tion has effected is the more remarkable. The wal- 
 rus skin exhibited in the Great Exhibition took n.> 
 less than four years to tan; but Mr. Pheller esti. 
 mated th.at by his mode of treatment, the conversion 
 ■would be perfect in 60 hours, allowing six periods of 
 agitation in the drum, each of 10 Lours' duration. 
 The economy of time in the conversion of hide is a 
 circumstance strongly favorable to the practical 
 working of the system, and is calculated to give to 
 this branch of industry adegree of activity not hith- 
 erto experienced." 

It is furtherstated that leather prepared thus, with- 
 out tan, possesses greatly increased capacity for re- 
 sisting the passage of water, combined with remark- 
 able suppleness; so that for boots and shoes it is far 
 preferable to tanned leather. "When ordinary leath- 
 er," says our well informed contemporary, from whom 
 we borrow these particulars, "is boiled in water, it 
 gradually hardens and becomes rigid; and if the op- 
 eration be continued for half an hour, it will be 
 found to have assumed a kind of woody texture, and 
 to have become brittle. Some descriptions of leath- 
 er, on the other hand, become converted into a mass 
 somewhat resembling glue. When Preller's leath- 
 er is tried in the same way, it gradually approaches 
 to the condition of horn, but it requires several hours 
 before that state is attained. In its ordinary condi- 
 tion, as before observed, it is remarkably supple, and 
 that quality admirably fits it for being used in the 
 soles of shoes; for tlie West and East Indies, in par- 
 ticular, this quality is highly advantageous, and for 
 the supply of troops would probably be found to be 
 attended with economy, and productive of comfort." I 

We can hardly over-estimate the importance of 
 these facts to country gentlemen; for, if further ex- 
 perience shows them to be fairly stated, of which we 
 have no reason to doubt, then it is clear that the tim- 
 ber on an estate will become seriously depreciated, 
 and all v,aluations have to be made upon an entirely 
 new basis. 

Guauo. 

There have been wide and loud complaints, made 
 to us by farmers in various directions within 30 miles 
 of Philadelphia, of the management of the Guano 
 trade, and the difficulty of getting a supply the pres- 
 ent fall. So long as there was none in the market 
 there was no disposition to find fault, but many per- 
 sons on the faith of the advertisements of the agent, 
 went with their teams often a great distance to pur- 
 chase for themselves and neighbors, found Guano on 
 the wharf, but were obliged to come home empty af- 
 ter wailing several days in the city .at great expense 
 and loss of time. They were told it was engaged, 
 and yet engagements svith them were refused. What 
 is said to be the object of the Peruvian Government, 
 to accomodate the farmers and keep the price down, 
 by refusing to let it go into the hands of dealeis, is a 
 praiseworthy motive, but it don't work right as now 
 managed. To say nothing of the rough language 
 and reception many have been treated to, and which 
 would prevent any firmer of sensibility fi-cm under- 
 going, more than once, even if he had to sacrifice his 
 crop, the expense of going several times to the city, 
 and remaining some days, brings the price up seve- 
 ral dollars per ton. We have heard farmers say they 
 would rather pay $50 per ton, than be subjected to 
 the loss and vexation they are at present. Then agents 
 and dealers in some way or other have obtained Gaano 
 to our own knowledge at the regu lar price $44 and have 
 resold it to farmers at$55. We know of one person, 
 who obtained 30 tons, and disposed of it at that price. 
 The present system is evidently wrong, and should 
 be changed. The laws of trade, supply and demand 
 if let alone will regulate themselves better, and be 
 more satis factory than any attempt to create a mo- 
 nopoly. We quote the following from the Southern 
 Planter, as containing some valuable suggestions. 
 The subject should receive attention at Washington, 
 as Guano has become one the of indispensables, and 
 recent news indicates that the supply is almost inex- 
 haustible. 

The Executive Committee of the Virginia State 
 Agricultural Society at its late meeting, I think, ap- 
 pointed a sub-committee to wait upon the President 
 of the United States for the purpose of bringing 
 about negotiations with the Peruvian government, 
 to the end, that guano might be introduced^into this 
 country on more favorable terms to the farmer than 
 at present. The movement is a laudable one, but 
 from my recollection of the terms of the resolution, 
 if the committee feel itself confined within the strict 
 1 ^tterof its instructions, its labors will prove of no avail. 
 It is well known that the Peruvian government is un-
