der obligations (of the precise nature of vrlnL'h I am 
 not informed) to the British Government, by which 
 the revenue derived from the exportation of guano la 
 pledged for the protection of British subjects who 
 are creditors of Peru; and if this debt has not been 
 discharged it will prove an obtacle in the way of 
 successful negotiation. This if the Peruvian govern- 
 ment were sincere, when recently approached upon 
 the subject, appears to be the root oi the evil. Should 
 the debt not be a much larger one than I have any 
 idea it is, I propose to get rid of this evil by letting 
 the United States apply the surplus revenue which 
 is so rapidly accumulating in the treasury, and will 
 be for years lying idle there, to the extinguishment 
 of these debts, by lending the amount of the debt to 
 the Peruvian government and assuming the atitude 
 of the principal creditor. I am of that school which 
 has endeavored to confine the General Government 
 within the limits of its delegated powers, and can see 
 no constitutional objection to such a measure, but if 
 others n»ore far-seeing, view the subject differently, 
 there are enough enterprising citizens in the country 
 who would will'ngly advance the money and relieve 
 Peru from the thraldom of British cupidity. If this, 
 or something like it, cannot be accomplished by ne- 
 gotiation, or if it could, I would farther propose 
 that efibrts be made to allow free competition in 
 bringing guano to the United States. It is due 
 to our commercial marine that this should be done. 
 I understand that no vessel is allowed to purchase 
 guano or to load at the island, unless chartered by 
 the Peruvian government. It would not be unreason- 
 able to ask of that government to fix upon a uniform 
 rate of charges at the islands and permit vessels from 
 all parti of the world to load and sell the guano in 
 what market, and at what price they thought proper. 
 The pi-ico would then, like the price of every other 
 article of commerce, be regulated by its value, and 
 by the supply and demand. Now it is a complete 
 monopoly; and it appears to me we are allowing the 
 Peruvian government exclusive privileges inconsis- 
 tent with the spirit of our institutions, and at war 
 with the rights and interests of our own citiaens: for 
 if Peru has the power to establish an agency in the 
 United States which has alone the privilege of selling 
 guano, England has the same right to establish an 
 agency with the sole power to sell her cloths, and 
 France the right to establish one exclusively for the 
 sale of her silks, &c. There is this difference, it is 
 true, in the one .;ase the government exercises exclu- 
 sive ownership while in the other the subjects of gov- 
 ernment are the owners. But I do not think the 
 merits of the proposition are materially altered by 
 the changed relation, for governments might assume 
 the proprietorship of every article of commerce and 
 produce monopolies of every known commodity 
 throughout the world. The mines of California be- 
 long to the United States, but it is not pretended that 
 this government would have the right to establish an 
 assay office in London under the control of an agent 
 who should alone vend the article of gold. If the 
 right exists it would be impolitic to exercise it; and I 
 am utterly amaze I, that in the case of Peru it has 
 been so long tolerated by the government of the 
 United States. The only explanation which can be 
 given to it is, that the rights of that portion of the 
 community h.ave been chicfl}' invaded who submit to 
 every burden and every imposition without murmur, 
 and who are so wrapped up in their high and noble 
 calling that ihey would rather suffer wrongs, enjoy- 
 ing the peace of their own firesides, than gain their 
 rights by agitation. No other class of men would 

submit to such impositions, and I trust that our agri- 
 cultural societies, which are multiplying in all parts 
 of the country will bring about such combinations of 
 interests as to make the sting of the crushed worm 
 felt in more ways than one. 

I have been led to these remarks by the evils which 
 the agricultural community have suffered, and the 
 wrongs they have Itoriie under the agency of the Pe- 
 ruvian government in disposing of the single article 
 of guano. That government, it is understood, has 
 given its agent orders to sell this article to none but 
 farmers. The agent professes to obey the instruc- 
 tions of its master, but it is notorious that farmers 
 cannot get it while merchants can; and things have 
 been so man.aged that speculators have got the entire 
 control of the market, and carried the price np to the 
 enormous and unreasonable sum of $bO per ton of 
 2000 lbs. when the government price to the farmer is 
 only §46 per ton of 2240 lbs. — a difference of nearly 
 fifty per cent., or S20 in the short ton. Hjw is this, 
 if the agent has acted in good faith ? The inference 
 may be naturally drawn that either the principal 
 agent is grossly ignorant of his duties, or that he and 
 his subs have been false to their trust, or, lastly, but 
 not probably, that these tricks are done under the 
 connivance of the Peruvian government. IVhether 
 this inference be just or not, I will not pretend to say, 
 but I speak what I know when I assert that farmer.s 
 have been rudely turned away without guano by the 
 principal agent in Baltimore, who have since employ- 
 ed and paid merchants a commission to buy it for 
 them. I, moreover, know the fact that at least three 
 cargoes of guano have been ordered to the sub-agents 
 in Alexandria and Washington, and yet the farmers on 
 the Potomae and Rappahannock rivers have been un- 
 able to obtain a supply. Messrs. Fowle, of Alexandria, 
 received!! very large cargo, all of which was engaged 
 before Us arrival, and were subsequently to have an- 
 other smaller one of eight hundred or a thousand tons, 
 which was also engaged. Mr. Fitzhu;;h Coyle, of 
 Washington, certainly received one and, perhaps, 
 two large cargoes, which were also engaged before 
 their arrival. Now I do not charge either of these 
 gentlemen with disobeying the published orders of 
 the Peruvian agent to sell to none but farmers, and 
 at fixed rates; but yet appearances are against some 
 one; for out of this large quantity which has arrived 
 at a single port I cannot count up fifty tons in tho 
 hands of farmers en the rivers mentioned. (It is 
 true that some was distributed amonga favored few.) 
 Whereas, it is a notorious fact that speculators in 
 Alexandria have it in abundance at sixty dollars per 
 ton of 2,000 pounds. If necessary, I will mention 
 the name of one — a Mr. Masters. Now, how did 
 Mr. Masters get this guano, in the face of the de- 
 claration by the Peruvian agent, that none but far- 
 mers were to have it, and that at forty-six dollars 
 per ton of 2240 pounds? Will Messrs. Barreda & 
 Brother be good enough to inform us? Speculators 
 in other parts of the country have it also in any quan- 
 tities at these enormou'< rates. It is for sale by them 
 in Richmond and Fredericksburg, as well as Alexan- 
 dria, I know, and no doubt in all the principal towns 
 in the United States, where it is used. This state of 
 things has been accounted for by suspecting a collu- 
 sion between the agents and speculators, supposing 
 that the excess over the government price is divided 
 between them. I have heard of such things; but I 
 do not vouch for their truth, because I know nothing 
 aliout it. Yet there is something mysterious in the 
 attitude of the question; all seems well arranged ti> 
 fleece the farmer; and the public will indulge in its
