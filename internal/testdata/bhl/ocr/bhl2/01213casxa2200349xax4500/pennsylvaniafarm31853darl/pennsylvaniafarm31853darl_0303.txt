bibe by suction through their sucking tubes or bills. 
 Like the cicada, too, when they have come to their 
 {growth and are ready to take the winged form, they 
 probably come forth from the ground, ascend tlie 
 stem of some plant, ca.st oif their skins, and then ap- 
 pear in the adult or perfect condition, in wliicli they 
 are prepared to continue their kind. I have frequent- 
 ly seen the empty skins of this or of a similar spe- 
 cies, after the tinal transformation, remaining upon 
 the stems of plants cjr the trunks of trees. 

The punctures made by this tree-hopper are so 
 large that there cannot be any difficulty in finding 
 them, when carefully looked for. In the latter part 
 of March I examined lepeatedly some of my plum 
 trees, which hav(^ heretofore been subject to warts, 
 without discovering any punctures upon them. Nev- 
 ertheless warts have appeared on some of the twigs, 
 that were previously noted as being free from punc- 
 tures or incisions of this insect Readers can draw 
 their own conclusions from this fact.

D!^simiuatiou of Agricultural luibrmation and 
 Farmers' Clubs. 

The tir.st grcit desideratum necessary to I he fur- 
 therance of this object is, that pulilio institutions 
 should continue their aid by fairs, premiums for su- 
 perior products, the organization of Conversational 
 Meetings, and above all, that those institutions 
 should have no jealous feelings towards each other. 
 In our own State we have a State Agricultural So- 
 ciety, the American Institute, and numerous eijnnty 
 Societies, each of which in its way can be materially 
 useful to the agricultural community, and cither of 
 which may destroy its usefulness, and in part that of 
 other institutions, by the slightest e.xercise of jealous 
 feelings. Let the t'ounty Societies organize Farmers' 
 Clubs. In every township whereverchurch or school 
 house exists, there are certainly farmers enough in 
 the immediate neighborhood to organize a Farmers' 
 Club, which may meet one evening in the week 
 throughout the year, and discuss the methods of 
 working, style of crops, &c., belonging to the sea- 
 son. 

The trustees of every church and school house will 
 doulitless be willing to give the use of theirbuildings 
 for evenings, when they are not required for other 
 purposes, or the use of such clubs. The Conversa- 
 tional Meetings should be held, and farmers sons and 
 apprentices should be encouraged to attend these 
 meetings. 

In our lai-go mercantile cities, we find splendid in- 
 stitutions appropriated to the use of merchants' 
 clerks. The Mercantile Library Association of New 
 York, entirely composed of young men who aie ap- 
 prenticed to mercantile pursuits, own one of the 
 largest libraries in the country. Here these appren- 
 tices may spend their evenings, oi be supplied with 
 books to read at home. One or more public lectures 
 are delivered per week before the members of this 
 institution. 

The mechanics' apprentices of New York have an 
 Apprentice:.' Library of 30,000 volumes. Lectures are 
 deliveied before them almost every night in the week, 
 spacious reading rooms provided for their accommo- 
 dation, and classes in almost every branch of knowl- 
 edge connected with the mechanic arts, are organized 
 for their use. Why then should farmers through ut 
 the country longer withhold their aid in the educa- 
 tion of their sons and apprentices in such matters as 

are connected with their art? Let agricultural books 
 be given as premiums at country schools, establish 
 Conversational Meetings, where farmers' apprentices 
 may attend one or more evenings in the week, so that 
 they may take advantage of the observations of older 
 practitioners. With such a system generally adopt- 
 ed, the next generation of farmers would render the 
 acquisition of a new Eldor.ado of no importance. — 
 These Conversational Meetings are the best known 
 vehicles for the dissemination of useful information. 
 Here a hundred farmers may meet and choose a sub- 
 ject each evening for conversation. Each may make 
 known any facts that have come within his knowl- 
 edge, for the benefit of the whole, and thus in one 
 hour the experience and reading of one hundred men 
 for twenty years, may be made known to each other 
 — and every person present at the end of this hour, 
 will know more of the subject conversed upon, than 
 any person present at the time of the commencement 
 of the meeting. 

The secretaries of these clubs could put them elves 
 in correspondence with distant Societies, and thus 
 secure an exchange of seeds, grafts, &c. No such 
 application ever made to the American Institute has 
 Vieen passed by luihecded, and wc presume every in- 
 stitution in the country would willingly pursue a sim- 
 ilar course. Any of the State Societies, on applica- 
 tion, would furnish a copy of their transactions to 
 su;h a club, and thus the nucleus of a library would 
 be formed. On town meeting and election days 
 throughout the country, there should be organized a 
 Conversational Meeting, to be in scssicpu during the 
 leisure part of such days, and the public generally 
 cuuld lie invited to attend, and discussions held as to 
 the inif roved methods of road-making, and any other 
 subject of interest to the district. — [lIoyAi'/iy Far-

The Aral) tlorsc. 

Layard. the explorer of Ninevah, who is as famil- 
 iar with Arabs as he is with antiquities, gives in his 
 late work, Assyria, some curious details respecting 
 the true horse of the desert. Contrary to the popular 
 notion, the real Arabian is celebrated less for unri- 
 valled swiftness than fin' extraordinary powers (,f 
 endurance. Its usual pace are but two — a quick 
 walk, often averaging four or five miles an hour, and 
 a half running canter; for only when pursued does a 
 Bedouin luit in his mare to full speed. It is the dis- 
 tance they will travel in emergency, the weight they 
 will carry, and the comparative trifle of food they 
 require, which render tha Arabian horse so valu- 
 able. 

Layard sajs that ho knew of a celebrated mare 
 which had carried two men in chain armor beyond 
 the reach of some Aiieyza pursuers. This maie had 
 rarely had more than twelve han<llu!s of barley in 
 twenty-four hours, excepting duiing the spring when 
 the pastures were green; and it is only the mares of 
 the wealthy Bedouins that get even tins allowance. 
 The consciiuence is that, except in the spring, the 
 Arab horse is lean and unsightly. They are never 
 placed under cover during summer, nor pirotected 
 from the bitter winds of the desert in winter. The 
 saddle is rarely taken from their backs. Cleaning 
 and grooming are strangers to them. They some- 
 times reach filteen hands in height, and never fall be- 
 h)w fourteen. In disposition they are docile as lambs, 
 requiring no guide but a halter; yet in the fright or 
 jiursuit their nostrils become blood-red, their eyes 
 glitter with file, the neck is arched, and the mane 
 and tail are raised and spread out to the wind; the
