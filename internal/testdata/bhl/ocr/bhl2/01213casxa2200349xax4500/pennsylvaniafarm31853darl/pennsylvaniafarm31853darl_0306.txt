{nee of eminent breeders, have proved to be a great 
 flesideraluni. These did not come by chance, but 
 were the scientific results of the long continued care 
 and skill of such men as Thomas Bates, Earl Diicie, 
 Lord Spencer and many others- The Duchess and Prin- 
 cess family of short horns have long commanded in 
 England the highe.st prices, for the reason that'they 
 (ire identified with cer'ain va'uable characteristics not 
 found elsevrhere in the same perfection. The late 
 Earl of Ducie was said never to stop at price when 
 he found such an animal as he thought the breeding 
 of his herd required. To have a very small amount 
 of offal, to possess early maturity, to be heavy in the 
 mofit valuable parts of the beef, a kindly dispositi n, 
 rapidity of fattening, and in a cow the property of 
 <leep milking; these are points, not of mere fancy, 
 but real value, and where they are derived from a 
 good ancestry, may bo continued and carried down 
 in the offspring. 

A Durham cow of our own importation, some 
 years ago, made over 15 lbs. of butter per week. 
 Supposing a common cow, making 7 lbs., to be worth 
 $30, was she only worth $G0 ? Certainly not. On 
 the principle that like produces like, and that this 
 deep milking would be retained in her descendants 
 as it has been in several instances, where the admix- 
 ture on the other side was judicious, the real value of 
 each a cow could hardly be estimated. 

At one of the recent ram lettings in England, the 
 services of seventy one rams were let for one year, 
 at an average of IJIU each, and one for $C50. This 
 latter (one of Webb's Soulhdowns) was subsequently 
 pinehaseA by F. Rotch, and is coming to New York. 
 We can easily imagine a cross with such a buck, un- 
 der certain circumstances, to be worth §1,000 or 
 $2,000, provided he excelled in certain points a flock 
 was before deficient in. 

We have known of a floek of pure Downs to be so 
 reduced in size and character by breeding in and in, 
 as to be almost valueless except for the butcher. A 
 Strong cross with a good buck would have had the 
 effect of increasing their value fifty fold. 

While the high prices we have adverted to are to 
 a certain extent speculative, and indeed like other 
 things induced by the present condition of the country 
 and abundance of money, still we do not consider 
 the!*! entirely so, and have entire cenfidence that the 
 whole country will be benefitted by the enterprise 
 ■and public spirit of those who have made such large 
 investments. 

AgEJcultural Exhibitions. 
 This season has been remarkable so far for the 
 number and success of these, not only in our own State 
 ftnd county, but in others around us. In many parts 
 of Pennsylvania, they have been held for the first 
 time, and have awakened the dormant energies of the 
 -formers; who kave been surprised themselves in see- 

ing collected such numbers of improved implements, 
 stock, seeds, vegetables, &o. At our own State Fair, 
 $16,000 were received from members and admission 
 ees, which, we understand, exceeds any State Exhi- 
 bition hitherto held. 

In York county, over nine acres were enclosed, 
 wh ieh was crowded with visitors and contestants for 
 premiums, many of the latter being from Baltimore. 
 In Bucks county, the exhibition was held on the 
 29th of September, at Newtown, and appears to have 
 been very spirited in every department of farm in- 
 dustry. The premium list took a wide range, inclu- 
 ding a ladies' and home department, in which tho 
 competition and display was quite extensive, embra- 
 cing home made bread, preserves, also needle and 
 crotchet work, netting and knitting, straw hats, cov- 
 erlets, counterpanes, &c. An excellent address was 
 delivered by Judge Smysor, exhibiting much re- 
 search and good practical suggestions. 

The Berks County Exhibition, held atReading, "is 
 said to be supe rior to that of last year, the contiibu 
 tions larger and more varied, accommodations better, 
 and the attendance beyond all precedent, — not leas 
 than 10,000." A ploughing match was also held at 
 the close, and several premiums awarded for skillful 
 ploughing. The receipts were over $1,500. An 
 address on the occasion, by the Hon. J. Glancy- 
 Jonos, was listened to much interest and is spoken 
 of as a most able production. One in German was 
 also delivered by Rev. J. W. Richards, D. D. 

Our friends over the river, of the Camden and 
 Gloucester Agricultural Society, are also keeping up 
 with the times, and had a large and very spirited ex- 
 hibition at Haddonfield, which was good in every 
 department, but particularly excelled in the display 
 of fine horses, both for road and draught. The lat- 
 ter being mostly crossed with the Norman stock, 
 which is much esteemed in New Jersey. As this 
 part of the State is much devoted to truck garden- 
 ing, the display in this department was well worth 
 seeing. A ploughing match was also held, and the 
 whole was concluded by an address from Morton 
 McMichael, of Philadelphia, in his usual good 
 style. 

AVe observe at this society, agricultural, horticul- 
 tural and other books are distributed, instead of pre- 
 miums in money, which seems more rational, and 
 are more permanent evidences of skill and success. 

Apples for Milch Cows.^Five minutes ago a 
 gentleman, who deals in facts and figures, as well 
 as fine cattle, informed us that he had fed out last 
 vnnter more than two hundred barrels of sweet apples 
 to his milch cows, and that the increased quantity 
 a nd ricness in quality of the milk paid him better 
 than any other use vrhich he could have applied them. 
 He says that he is raising trees annually, for the 
 purpose of raising apples for stock. Another impor- 
 tant statement of his, is, that since he has fed apples 
 to his cows, there has not been a case of milk fever 
 among them. — [iV. E. Farmer.
