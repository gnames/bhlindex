Harvest Hymu. 

God of the rollingycar! to Thee 

Our sonj; shall rise — whose bounty pours 
 In many a goodly gilt, with free 

And liljeral hand our Autumn stores; 
 No firstlings of our flocks we slay, 

No soaring clouds of incense rise — 
 But on thy hallowed shriue wi lay, 

Our grateful hearts in sacrifice. 

Borne on thy breath, the lap of Spring 

Was heaped with many a hloommg flower; 
 And smiling Summer joyed to bring 

The sunshine and the gentle shower; 
 And Autumn's rich luxuriance now, 

The ripening seed — the bursting shell, 
 The golden sheaf, and laden bough, 

The fullness of thy bounty tell. 

No menial throng, in princely dome, 

Here wait a titled lord's behest; 
 But many a fair and peaceful home 

Hath won thy peaceful dove a guest; 
 No groves of palm or fields adorn — 

No myrtle shades or orange bowers — 
 But rustling meads of golden corn. 

And fields of waving grain are ours. 

Safe in thy care, the landscape o'er 

Our fl icks and herds securely stray; 
 No tyrant master claims our store — 

No ruthless robber rends away — 
 No fierce volcano's withering shower — 

No fell simoon with poisonous breath — 
 Nor burning sun, with baleful power, 

Awake the fiery plagues ol death. 

And here shall rise our song to Thee, 

Where lengthened vales and pastures lie, 
 And streams go singing wild and free, 

Beneath a blue and smiling sky; 
 Where ne'er was reared a mortal throne. 

Where crowned oppressors never trod. 
 Here — at the Throne of Heaven alone. 

Shall man in reverence bow to God, 

Cultivation of the Blackberry. 

In answer to inquiries .about the method of culti- 
 vating Blackberries, time of transplanting, &o., we 
 reply nothing is more simple. They may be set out 
 either fall or spring, as is most convenient, andplaced 
 in rows four feet apart and two feet in the rows, or if 
 land is plenty four feet each way, to admit of passage 
 of cultivator. The ground should previously be 
 deeply ploughed and subsoileil. Shorten the growth 
 each spring, same as with raspberries. It is surpri- 
 sing the cultivation i f this delicious fruit near our 
 large cities is not more common. The productive- 
 ness of the plants, no less than the size and flavor 
 of the berries is very much increased by cultivation. 
 It is stated that they have been exhibited in Boston 
 one and a half inches in length. Our last number 
 gives an account of a seedling blackberry, the new 
 Uochelle, which promises to be a valuable acquisi- 
 tion: 

S. W. Cole, of Boston, says, "We have seen this 
 fruit sold at SI a quart, that was not a whit better 
 (though fine) than we have picked (a quart without 
 moving from our steps)- on new lands in Maine. — 

We have measured bushes of one year's growth ten 
 fjet high. We did not dream, in our boyhood, when 
 tearing our legs among thousands of brambles, of 
 ever seeing tbid fruit cultivated, and sold at enormous 
 rates. 

The blackberry ripens long in succession, coming 
 in immediately after the raspberry. Owing to its 
 great excellence, bees, wasps, flies, &c., claim a large 
 share. Some blackberriex a,re white, but they are as 
 great an anomaly as ;\ while blackbird, or while crows, 
 which is seldom seen. 

Soil, Propagation and Culture. — The blackber- 
 ry grows freely, in a warm, tolerably dry or rather 
 moist, deep, rich soil. It abounds among stones, old 
 logs, fences, and natural hedges. Keep the land 
 rich and mellow. Besides other manures, use ashe.s, 
 leaves and vegetable mould. It is propagated by 
 seeds, and by offsets at the roots. 'Train up new 
 wood, and cut away the old, to keep the bushes vig- 
 orous and productive. 

HiGU Busn, {liubus viltosus.) Fruit large; long 
 ovate; shining black; very tender, juicy, of a sweet, 
 rich, spirited, aromatic flavor, resembling the orange. 
 Growth straight and upright, then the tops become 
 recumbent. White blossoms. Downing's account 
 of this fruit does not come up to the valuable wild 
 variety sold in Maine. 

Low Busa, {Rabus canadeii.tis.) Small; roundish 
 or irregular; black or reddish black; rather tart, but 
 brisk, pleasant flavor." 

Harvesting Potatoes. 

The has idea generally prevailed that potatoes, es 
 pecially those grown on low moist lands, are essen- 
 tially benefitted by exposure to the sun and air be- 
 fore removing them to the bins. This, however ex- 
 perience has hing since demonstrated to be a fallacy. 
 The sooner potatoes are in the cellar, or pruteclel 
 from the sun's rays, after they are removed from the 
 hills, the better, the operation of the solar raj-< hav- 
 ing a powerful tendency not only to deteriorate great- 
 ly their ea'.ing qualities, but also to render them far 
 less likely to keep well through the subsequent 
 spring. 

Another very popular error, and one no loss pro- 
 ductive of bad consequences, is the supposition that 
 the tuber should be scrupulously and thoroughly clean 
 sed from dirt; the presence of which in ever so small 
 quantity, is considered by many to be the radical cause 
 of their becoming watery and unfit tor food. Any 
 one, however, who will take the tiouble of experi- 
 menting, may easily satisfy himself that such is not 
 the case; and that potatoes which have been thor- 
 oughly cleansed by washing or drying, or indeed by 
 any process which effectually rids them of suil, will 
 exhibit symptoms ot decay, and become unfit for 
 use, or for culinary purposes, much sooner than 
 those which have not. 

In wiany sections it is a common practice with far- 
 mers to select a portion of their best and most per- 
 fectly matured and developed tuliors, and pack tliera 
 carefully and compactly in liarrels, tilling the spaces 
 between th(! roots with soil, cool and in jist. The biir- 
 rels thus filed, arc placed in som-> dark cellar, where 
 they remain undisturbed till the ontents are de- 
 manded for the market, late in tho season, for domes- 
 tic use. 

Secured in this manner, and deposited beyond the 
 reach of light and heat, or where they will be as lit- 
 tle exposed as possii le to these powerful agents, 
 potatoes will keep perlectly sound and retain tlicir 
 eating properties unimpaired till late the following 
 year.
