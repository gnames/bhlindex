Every observing fanner must have noticed that tlie 
 tiotatoes that are "crowded oot" from the sides o1 
 hills, or which are found so near the surface as to 
 be fretjtrentty esppsed by heavy rains washing 
 away the soil; always turn green, and when cooked, 
 Iiave a sweet, coppery taste, which is eitrefiTely nau- 
 seating and nnpleaaant. This is always a result of 
 exposure to solar action; it concentrates <T principle 
 which the potato contains \ti conjunction with many 
 othrrs of a natritioits nature, into an active poison', 
 and hastens greatly the decay and decomposition of 
 the roots. As soon as tl^ey sre taken from the soil, 
 they should be plaeedin the }ni\a.-^[EepnbiicanJmii-

 Snperphosphate of I.ii»e. 

In the "Genesee Farmer" of September last, 
 (page 281) there is an article headed — "Mapks' i»- 
 ?R0VEB SuPERrHospnATB OF LrME." The wrrter, af- 
 ter enumerating some crops for vrhich he regards the 
 Bse of Superphosp4i!>te highly advantageous, thus 
 proereeiis: "For wheat, barley, oats, potatoes, and, we 
 believe, though wo harve no esperinrents of oar own to 
 sustain the opioion, that for corn and timothy super- 
 phosphate of liiae, in ninety-nine eases out of one 
 hundred, will be found of no essential value," 

Fearing the above statement, com'ing from such 
 high autl>o»ity, might mislead some of our Agricul- 
 turalists, in the use of a Talaable fertilizer, I beg 
 leave to quote some experiments leading to a differ- 
 ent conclusion. Doi^e dtJst is knows to be a leading 
 principal ingredient in the coBrpomtion of Superphos- 
 phate of Lime. About twenty years ago, I tried my 
 first experiment with bone dast. I had about an acre 
 of ground lying ont as "old field" having been cut 
 off by a new road, and sot considered worth fencing 
 by the former proprietor. The soil was thin, laying 
 on a clay sub soil. Having fenced it, I farmed it 
 with corn, but the crop scarci ly paid the expense of 
 farming. The next summer I farmed it as an open 
 fallow; plowed rt three times and in September seed- 
 ed ft dowB with )j/e and iiwoihy. I procured from 
 Philadelphia six bushels of hoite dnsi. This I had 
 intended to have harrmvcd in with the rye, but was 
 disappointed in getting it liauled un'.il about ai week 
 after the rye come up. I then sowed it broad cast 
 on top of the ground. I applied no other manure. 

Now for the result. The crop tvf rye was fully 
 eqndi to lay wishes, some of it wa* lodged. The 
 grain was plump and heavy, and I regret very much 
 that I did not keep an accouHt ofthemimber of bush- 
 els. I took five timothy cropa off the same ground 
 in five successive years-, the first was very heavy;: they 
 grew lighter each successive year; but the fifth was 
 ■worth eotting. The ground received no further dress- 
 ing, ex,cept a light sowing of Plaster of Paris, each 
 Spring. 

I merely state the above' as iicts; etverj farmer cen 
 .draw his own conclusions. 

1 beg leave, in addition, to state some experiments 

with Mapes' Improved Superphosphate of Lime trieiJ 
 in this vicinity within the present year. Mr. Jesse' 
 C. Green, Dentist of this place, bought a piece oJ 
 grass land of Mr. Enos Siwedley last epring. Mr, 
 Green, by my advice, applied to this a top dressing: 
 cf Mapes' Improved Superphosphate of lime. Mr^ 
 Smedley gave fiis grass land adjoining ftnd of equal 
 quality, no dressing. At harvest, the crop on Mr, 
 Oreen-'s land was fully double'tbat on Mr. Smedley's, 
 and at this tim« the growing grass shows a decided 
 difference in its favor. On the grass land of Mr, 
 Wm. P. Marshall, the same fertilizor produced the- 
 twme result. Tiruothy is the leading grass for hay 
 in this vicinity, 

I might also mention the good effects resttlting 
 from the same fertiliz.er to a crop of wlveat on lancS 
 of Mr. Abram Bailey, and of wheat and oats on lan£ 
 of Mr. FasehKll Morris, 

A. MARSHALL.

 McAvoy's Superior Strawberrj'. 

Mr'. Editor ; — I ara a subscriber to the Ilorticul' 
 turist, and find, in the September number, an engr.a' 
 ving of this now somewhat celebr ited variety, so- 
 unlike the one in the Farm Journal, that 1 am in 
 dueeJ to write and ask- you, whieh of them we may 
 rely upon as being correct. I harve raised strawber- 
 ries for several yeitrs, but have not seen the McAvoy 
 Superior. S have never known, however, berries of 
 the same variety to vary so much as those Jwo en- 
 gravings. Who shall decide where doetors disa- 
 gree ? 

Several of t» in this neighborhood are. much 
 pleased that the "Strawberry Question," is now 
 wound ap and set at rest by the voluntary admis' 
 sioRS of tlwse who have been fighting the Itairdest 
 in behalf of the "fixed sexuality," The interesting, 
 communication by your excellent fellow citizen and 
 accomplished botanist, W. D., seemed to cover the 
 whole grouTvd, and leave but little to be said farther 
 on either side. It presented the true points at issue 
 in a more forcible and commorv seiwe matter of fact 
 style, than any article which hais yet appeared oc' 
 the subject in any of our journals, aiml ought to" 
 have been the means of sparing us tlw inSiction of 
 three mortal pages in your October number, Tho 
 author of that long winded communication seeuM to- 
 imagine himself tho centre of all strawberry knowl- 
 edge, and, by his own account has been successful, 
 by his own seedlings, in superseding most of tho old 
 and highly esteemed kiiKi<s. There is one at least of 
 your readers, who prefers holding on to what he' 
 has proved and well tested, than to take up witb 
 new ones, even at the directicm'of a "Prince."
