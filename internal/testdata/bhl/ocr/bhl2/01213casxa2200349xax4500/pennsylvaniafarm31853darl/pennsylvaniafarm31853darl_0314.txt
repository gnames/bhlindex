course of studs ouaide the buildinu;, and cover with 
 thin boards, fitted closely, leaving an open space be- 
 tween this and the first building. In any event it is 
 advisable to place a second roof of rouj;h boards, 8 
 or 10 inches above the first. Small sliding doors 
 may be put in each gable, for ventilation, in case 
 foul air should be {generated by any means within. 
 Fine clean shavings of pine or other resinous wood 
 will be found most reliable for covering the ice; a 
 thin coating of these may be laid upon the floor 
 also, and also at the sides. 

If the soil upon which the Ice House is desired to 
 stand, is impervious clay, the whole may be built 
 above ground, taking care to 3hut out a circulation 
 of air below the floor, and at the same time to allow 
 the water to pass off freely. 

The more ice i.s secured in a body, the longer will 
 it Veep from melting, for this reason it would be a 
 matter of ecomcmy for several neighbors to join in 
 putting up a building to be used in common. — Ohio

The Guano Islands. 

Capt. Congdon, of the barque Harriet Thornton, 
 recently from the Chincha Islands, communicates to 
 the Providence Journal, a very readable account of 
 the Islands, the .shipping that frequent thorn, the 
 mode of loading the ves.s2ls, and the kind of life 
 there, from which we make the following extract : 

"Vessels all load at the lee side of the island. At 
 this time the guano has bejn removed from the edge 
 of the Island in places, say one thousand feet. Rails 
 are laid and cars used to bring it to the edge of the 
 rocks and dump it into large bins or shutes made of 
 long polos interwoven with ropes and chains to sup- 
 port them, wide at the upper ends and narrow at the 
 lower. These hold from one hundred to five hun- 
 dred tons. At the lower end are gates or scuttles, 
 and from these gates are canvas bags, of about two 
 feet in diameter, leading to the ships and boats be- 
 low. The ships are hauled close to the rooks and 
 moored off and on. The hose are led at once into 
 the hatch, the gates above are hoisted, and you can 
 imagine the force with which it comes down through 
 this hose of one hundred feet. A thousand ton ship 
 can be loaded in forty-eight hours. Smaller bins 
 are used by the boats, which all prefer, as we have 
 much less dust. A sliip under the spout or hose is 
 completely enveloped in a cloud of dust, making it 
 almost impossible to exist on board. The guano is 
 trimmed away in the hold by natives with oakum 
 tied over their mouths and noses, and veils over their 
 eyes. This lets in air and excludes the dust. They 
 can only stay below from twenty to thirty minutes. 
 They are in gangs of eight or ten, and relieve each 
 other as above. Every part of the vessel is penetra- 
 ted with this dust. It will go wherever smoke will. 
 I can compare it to nothing but so much dry ashes. 
 The guano abounds in hartshorn, and is said to 
 be very healthy and beneficial in some complaints. 

The vessels are all of one color from truck to 
 water. Not ii spear of grass, rush or reed, is to be 
 seen anywhere; no vegetable matter of any kind on 
 the islands. Where the guano is now removed is a 
 perpendicular bank of about one hundred feet. In 
 it are found dead birds, some even on their nests 
 with eggs under them. I have several of them per- 
 fect in shape, still pure guano. Most of them crum- 
 bled to dust when exposed to the air. Layers of 
 reeds and twigs are to be found through the guano, 
 said to be brought there from the main land by the 
 birds, for their nesis. As v,Q walk over the Islands 

we find holes innumerable. These are the halita- 
 tions of the birds. With d.aylight they go seaward 
 for food, and return with darkness to spend the night 
 on the islands. They are of various kinds- peli- 
 cans, penguin, many of the duck species, Ac. Seala 
 and sea-lions are seen in thousands sporting among 
 the rocks and ships, and basking in the. sun Me- 
 thinks I hear you say what a place for gunning, and 
 you will no doubt be surprised when I tell you I 
 have not discharged my gun since I sailed from New- 
 York. The laws here are very rigid; nut a gun or 
 pistol is allowed to be fired on or around the islands 
 or on board ship. A penalty is exacted for every 
 bird killed; this has caused much trouble here. — 
 Still parties go on shore nights and rob the holes 
 of their inmates, generally two birds, something 
 like our mackerel gulls. They are said to eat v«ry 
 well, but rather fishy. AVe find eggs at times in 
 abundance, yet these wc are not allowed to touch. 

The laws are strictly enforced; not even the seals 
 or sea lions are we allowed to shoot; but I am hard 
 tempted at times. I sometimes use my harpoon as 
 they swim around the ship, but when fast it is im- 
 possible to hold on, as lookouts are stationed all 
 around, and scarcely a day passes without trouble 
 ill some quarter. Every vessel that comes here baa 
 a certain number of lay days — -about ten d<iys for 
 every one hundred tons. Most of us have to lay 
 here our days out. At daylight dozens of boats can 
 be seen about the spouts waiting for loads. Daily 
 accounts are kept of each ship's days and turns; so 
 many loads per day are allowed them — say first 
 week two loads per day, second week three loads per 
 day, third week four loads per day. Wc are all sup- 
 plied with boats. They hold from ten to twenty 
 tons, and are generally ships' long boats, sold to Pe- 
 ruvians when they leave for home. Laborers cannot 
 now be hired here at any price; we can only work 
 our own men. 

One would imagine that it would be impossible to 
 exist in the clouds of dust. The men are all of one 
 color — you cannot tell a white one from a black one 
 when at work in it. It is fun for our sailors. As a 
 general thing, I never saw a set of men more inter- 
 ested for their employers than they are in loading 
 our boats. They lay in it, roll and wrestle in it, and 
 at times are completely buried in it. These shutes 
 that lead into the vessel's hold are dangerous. Cases 
 have occurred where men h;.ve slipped in at the 
 mouth of the hose as the guano went in or down, 
 and never seen again, or dead if found at all. At 
 times where there is much surf on, I have sc'n the 
 hose come out of the batch and the guano go thirty 
 feet from the side of the vessel, the bigness of the 
 hose. We are supplied twice a week, Wednesday 
 and Saturday, from Pisco city, with fresh meat, veg- 
 etables and fruits, by boatmen, who make quite a 
 business of it. Fresh beef eight and a half cents 
 per pound, fowls ten dollars per dozen, turkeys 
 twenty-four dollars per dozen, pigs weighing twenty 
 pounds three dollars, sheep four dollars each. Vege- 
 tables are high: enough for one week's consumption 
 for a crew of fifteen, say two dollars. Everything 
 in the way of provision is high."
