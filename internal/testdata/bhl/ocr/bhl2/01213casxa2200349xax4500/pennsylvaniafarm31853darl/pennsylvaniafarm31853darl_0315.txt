bilily and appeariiiice of harness, carriages, &c. We 
 will tlicrefore give the niiiJe uf uiling and washing 
 harness practiced by one who is qualified to speak 
 underslandingly upon that subject 

Observing the good condition and fine appearance 
 of the harness of Aid. Baker, proprietor ol the most 
 extensive livery establishment in Ilothestcr, we re- 
 quested him to impart to us, for publication, the mo 
 diis operandi by which so desirable a result was 
 achieved. In ccmipliance therewith, he stated the 
 course adopted as the best and most economical, af- 
 ter twenty yeais experience in a business which re- 
 quired considerable attention to tackling apparatus. 
 llis process of oiling and washing harness is sub- 
 stantially as follows : 

Take Neats' Foot Oil, and Ivory or Patent Black - 
 the latter well pulverised or to be made so before 
 using. Mix thoroughly — adding the black until the 
 oil is well colored or quite black. In cool weather 
 the oil should be warmed somewhat before mixing. 
 AVith a sponge apply a light coat of the mixture — 
 only what the leather will readily absorb, unless the 
 harness is very diy, in which case a heavier coating 
 may bo necessary. After the harness is dry — which 
 will be in from two ours to half or a v hole day, de- 
 fending upon the weather and previous condition of 
 the leather — wash thoroughly with soap suds. In 
 making the suds use ffood Castile soap and cold rain 
 water. (Warm water should never be used on har- 
 ness leather.) Apply the suds with a sponge. Rub 
 off with buckskin. This will give your harness a 
 nice, glossy surface, and the leather will retain a 
 good color and continue pliable for months. If it 
 becomes soiled with mud, or sweat, an application of 
 soap and water, hs above directed, (witimut oiling,) 
 will be sufficient tp give it a bright appearance. 

Two applications of this oil and black mixture a year 
 (or once every six months,) will be sufBcient to keep 
 harness, as ordinarily used, in good order. It may 
 be necessary for livery men, and others who use har- 
 ness constantly, to apply the oil oflener — but in most 
 cases two oilings a year, and washing with suds 
 when soiled, will keep a harnes. in good trim for 
 sight and service. This process will pay a large 
 dividend in extra service and durability, — to say 
 nothing of improved appearance. 

Aid. B. assures us that the same, or a very simi- 
 lar applicaticm, is just the thing for carriage tops 
 which are made of top leather. The only difference 
 in treatment is, that less oil should be used, or rather 
 a lighter coating should be applied — and it should 
 be washed off before drylmj in, top leather being thin 
 and much more penetrable than harness. Of course 
 this mixture would not answer for enameled leather, 
 of which some carriage tops are constructed. — Rural

Coustructi >n of Pig Pens. 

Among the very valuable works for the farmer is- 
 sued by Saxton, the indefatigable agricultural book- 
 seller of New York, is the Progressive Farmer, by 
 Nash. Price only 50 cents. We extract from it the 
 following excellent article on Pig Pens and the man- 
 agement of Pig Manure : 

318. Mythology relates that one KingAugeus had 
 stalled 30,000 cattle for many years without eloanin" 
 after them. Hercules, it is said, was appointed to 
 the task of cleansing these "Augean stables." T.ic 
 wily hero, as the story has come down to us, tu n mI 
 n riv. r thriiu<;h them, and made clean work shortly. 
 Whether the stalls travelled with the curient, wj ai-c 

not informed, but the manure went down stream. 
 Agriculturally considered, this was just about as wise 
 as the management of some modern pig-pens. 

210. I have often seen these important structures 
 built with their roofs facing the south; the manure 
 thrown out the south side; the eaves washing it in 
 rainy days, and the sun scorching it in fair weather; 
 till, between washing, and fermentation, anAburning 
 there was little left. Others are so located, that 
 rills, if not rivers, run into them, not enough per- 
 haps to cleanse them, after the model of the aforesaid 
 "Ilerculian labor," but enough to sweep away nearly 
 all of their soluble salts. Owing to bad m.anage- 
 ment, pig-manure has come into bad reimtation, but 
 it is good, nevertheless, if rightly managed. 

320. The pig-pen should be so constructed that 
 the eaves will be turned away from the manure. — 
 The ground shimld be in such shape that no water, 
 except what falls directly from the heavens, can find 
 ingress, ar.d none find egress but by evaporation. 
 There should be an outside enclosure, where the an- 
 imals can be as filthy as their swinish nature prompts; 
 and an inside apartment, where they can be as dry 
 and warm as they please. If the first is not allowed 
 them, they may n(jt pay for their keeping in sum- 
 mer; if the last is not furni.shed, they certainly will 
 not pay for their winter's food. No aninivl can yrovr 
 or fatten when siiffcriny with the cold. It takes all 
 his fvod to keep him J'rom. freeziny. 

321. Let the outside enclosure be of considerable 
 size, giv'ng at least one square rod to the first ten- 
 ant, and half as much more to each additional occu- 
 pant. It is agreed on all hands that American far- 
 mers have land enough. They can afinrd to give 
 their pigs a sufficient range. The ground should bo 
 dishing, the same as in the barnyard, and for the 
 same reason — that nothing may run over in wet 
 weather; and the materials for the pigs to work over 
 should be so abundant as never to evaporate to dry- 
 ness in the dryest times. 

322. Now, what is tfi b*" done that a lot of swino 
 may produce, partly in the "natural way," and more 
 by the manufacture of raw materials, ten loads each, 
 per year, ot excellent compost ? If the number to bo 
 kept be ten, this would give a hundied loads. Sup- 
 pose this to be the average number for the year, and 
 let us see how the thing is to be dime. In the first 
 place, put around the outside of the pen, or outer 
 yard, seventy-five hiads of peat, swamp muck, road- 
 scrapings, tup-soil, or whatever you can best procure, 
 and ih 'n pioieod as follows : 

323. After the pen has been cleared of its last 
 year's manure, throw in p'emifully of this to begin 
 with. Lost it be scattered over the whole enclosure 
 several inches in depth. As it becomes thoroughly 
 moistened with rains and the droppings of the ani- 
 mals, throw in more, and so on, through the summer 
 and fall, tlirowingin, more or less, nearly as often as 
 you feed the swine, taking care that it always bo 
 moist, but seldom or never thoroughly drenched. 

he quantity will soon become so large that it will 
 hold the water of any ordinary rain, and with- 
 stand the cvaooration of any druuth, if not very .se- 
 vere. It it inclines to dry up, it is welt to tiirow 
 over it a few quarts of plaster. Plaster is very little 
 soluble. Five hundred lbs. of water dissolve hut one 
 lb. of plaster. It cannot, therefore, be lust by put- 
 ting it on moist manure, as some other salts might 
 be. Indeed, it should be sprinkled iiv(>rall manures 
 frequently, but especially if the^' iuclini', eithei i i c<.il- 
 sequence of dry weather, or of too rapid lermenta- 
 tion, tu become dry.
