CONSTRUCTION OF PIG PENS-PARSNIPS. 

324. Some have supposed tliat the oater pen for 
 SH-ine slmulj be under cover. I think not. Re- 
 member that rain does not hurt manure, unless it run 
 tbrouj^h it. carrying off its soluble salts. Every drop 
 of ram brings down .immonia and other fertiliziu'^ 
 matters fro-iii the air. The fallino; rain washes the 
 air of Its impurities. Alter a shower, we say, "How 
 sweet the air is." It is sweet, because it is clean 
 Hence, lu tlie neijrhborhood of cities and lar^e villa- 
 ges, and everywhere, to a limited e.x;tent, rain falls 
 impregnated with enriching materials. It it falls on 
 a quantity of manure, which has sufficient depth to 
 hold It, till evaporation takes place, it leaves these 
 materials in the manure. Hence, the more rain the 
 better, provided it go off by evaporation, and not by 
 filtration. The evaporation sliould not go on to per- 
 fect dryness, for then the ammonia, the carbonic 
 acid, an I other gases, are inclined to escape, and the 
 m.anur,' is approaching that state in which it may be 
 said ;obe "burnt." 

;J25. Alwiuin moisl but never leached, should be the 
 fivrmer's rule for his manure. The more manure he 
 makes.both in his cow-yard and his pig-pen, the more 
 easily can he beep within this rule. A few inches 
 of manure, spread over the yard or pen, will be drv 
 as powder <jnc day and thoroughly leached the next; 
 while a depth of ten, fifteen, or twenty inches, will 
 stand a long dicnitli, or hold the water of a long rain. 
 Consequently, it generally happens to the farmer 
 who makes manure on a fiberal scale, that his ma- 
 nure is as much better in quality as it is more in 
 quantity. 

32G. I have said, always moist hut never leached. 
 Closely allied to this is another rule. Who has not 
 noticed that a pig-pen, in which the occupants are in 
 danger of drowning, and one in which the manure 
 !S so dry as to be suffering a rapid fermentation, al 
 ways smell horribly ? To say nothing of the keeper 
 and his lamily, the pigs themselves are less healthy 
 m such an atii.osphere, and they will thrive less on 
 the same keeping. To keep a stinking pig pen, is to 
 throw away part of the feed and part of the manure 
 at the same time. By giving corn to swine, shut up 
 to a polluted atmosphere, the farmer loses a portion 
 of his last year's crop; and, by letting his pig-pen 
 "waste its sweetness on the desert air," he fails of a 
 portion uf his next year's. A valuable portion, and 
 not a small portion, of what should produce crops 
 next_summer, is going beyond his reach. 

o27. Not the hast o/Tensivc vdor should escape from 
 thepifi-peii. This is 'the rule before alluded to! .and 
 It IS as practicable as it is important. To practice 
 it,_will save something on the last year's crop; some- 
 thing for the nest's; something certainln in comfort: 
 and, it ma;/ be, something in doctors' bills. In order 
 to practice it successfully, one needs only to throw 
 into the pig pen, and all like places, including the 
 vault of the necessary, plenty of peat, black 7nud, 
 or top-soil even, and to see th t it is always moist, 
 but not drenched. A little plaster would be a help, 
 but is not necessary. I( it is not at hand, the other 
 part of the prescription will suffice. Plaster, howev- 
 er, should Iways be on hand. This, and cured peat, 
 or niiick, should never be wanting about the farmer's

premises, 

'•i^S. The same rule should be observed with re- 
 gard to every part of the premises. If others suffer 
 bad odors about their farms, they may lose their 
 comfort and their health; i, the farmer suffers them, 
 he will lose his lecallh also; for these are the vc-v 
 quiniessence of his manures; and it is a singular, but 
 well known fact, that growing plants abs'orb with 
 aviditj what is most noxious to animal life. 

Culture and Value of the Parsulp. 

As one who has lived twenty years upon a farm 
 searching all the while for reliable information, both 
 from his own experience and from that of others 
 ought to be in possession of some "fixed facts" and 
 settled opinions; and as duty, propriety, and frater- 
 nity require that we should allow others the oppor- 
 tunity of benefitting by our experience, I feel moved 
 to give you a few items of information which I think 
 very satisfactorily settled by evidence within my own 
 observation. 

Disliking long prefaces, and trusting that all your 
 correspondents, will dispense with them, I commence 
 the brief summary of my experience and observa- 
 tions of twenty years, by a statement in regard to 
 the value of parsnips. 

Parsnips for Hojs.— One of the things which I. 
 consider well settled, and a reliable and "useful item 
 of knowledge, is this: that p.arsnips, either raw 
 or cooked, but preferably cooked, with the addition 
 ol apples, potatoes, &c., occasionally, were it only to 
 prevent the appetite from being cloyed by "eternal 
 sameness," constitute the best kind of food whereon 
 to fatten a hog. They are also the best kind of roots 
 for milch cows. B(Hh hogs and c iws eat them with 
 avidity, and to the milk and butter thev communicate 
 a good delicious flavor. I have seen 'it stated some 
 years ago that beef made from parsnips brings the 
 highest price in the London market. I think, tliough 
 I may be deceived by imagination, that pork m ide 
 from feed chiefly composed of parsnips, is sweeter 
 than when made from anything else. 

'This is not the only recommendation which may 
 be justly bestowed on the parsnip. Among its other 
 good qu.tlities is this— that it requires no care 
 or housing in the fall, as all othei* roots do. In all 
 the middle, northern and western states, potatoes, 
 carrots, and turnips, must be harvested and housed] 
 or buried ; and even w hen all this is done, and with 4 
 good care .and judgment too, a portion will frequently 
 be ruined and lost by frosting, over heating or decay 
 from other causes. Parsnips, on the other hand, re- 
 quiring no care in the fall, they may be left with- 
 out injury in the ground all winter. They mav also 
 be planted early in the spring, as the frost does not 
 injure them, even at the earlieststageof their growth, 
 so that this root crop interferes the le;xst of any with 
 employments which crowd upon the farmer in the 
 spring and fall. It continues to grow throuo-h 
 the whole season, until the ground freezes in winter; 
 it requires no expenditure to gather or store it; it may 
 be taken up oi. several occasions during the winter, 
 and tlie roots that stay in the ground all winter, are 
 not injured, and probably improved, by the fVost. 
 Parsnips seem to be eaten with more relishthan either 
 turnips or potatoes, and yield in tho raw state, at 
 least a greater amount of nutriment. 

Another advantage in cultivating parsnips is, that 
 on a suitable soil — sand or loam, rich or well manur- 
 ed, and deep plowed — a large growth may be secur- 
 ed. At the rate of 1,200 bushels have been gathered 
 from one acre of ground. 

Parsnips may be planted either in spring, or in 
 the latter part of summer, say in August or Septem- 
 ber. The ground should be well manured, mel- 
 low, and deeply plowed and the seed sown in drills, 
 so as to have plants to thin out, while preserving them 
 at about eight inches apart. This will probably re- 
 quire at about the rate of two pounds seed to the 
 acre. The drills should be two feet apart and the 
 space between well cultivated andkeptcle.ar of weeds, 
 if 8Qwn in spring the earlien the better. A large
