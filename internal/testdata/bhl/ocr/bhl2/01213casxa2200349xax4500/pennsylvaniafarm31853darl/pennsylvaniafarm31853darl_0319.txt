his srain, but the night bofure he caine to my hand 
 he had eaten to the full of all he had liked; and when 
 he came he was so stiff he could not step over a six 
 inch pole, and when he attempted to turn round would 
 nearly fall. I put him into water nearly knee deep, 
 and kept a wot blanket on him nearly all the time 
 for four hours, then put him into the stable, and put 
 another blanket over him and left hira for the night. 
 The next ninrning I found him sweating; took him to 
 the stable and rode him a mile, led him back, and 
 put him in the brook again for an hour. During the 
 day I exercised hira about five miles, and about sun- 
 set let him stand an hour iu the water, and again in 
 the next n orning. 

About nine o'clock he was started on his journey 
 of forty-two miles, and performed it with ease before 
 sunset; he laid overoneday, and went home the next, 
 forty-five miles, and was returned to his owner, and 
 he being a farrier, gold him in a few days, perfectly 
 unable to describe any difiiculty or damage done to 
 his horse, being ignorant of what had happend. The 
 horse was allowed all the food and water he wanted 
 as usual he was not bled in any part, neither was 
 there anything given to liim except his usual food. 
 The second day he was as limberas he ever was, and 
 shown no injury from his founder since. 

If you think this worthy of your notice, and wish 
 it, I will give you my opinion of the founder and its 
 cure. — [Water Cure Journal. 

Mules and Horses. 

It is thought by many that mules for the purpose 
 of farm work, would be pr(!ferable to horses, because 
 they eat less, are tougher and hardier, and live lon- 
 ger. It is true that with us the greater part of 
 farm labor that requires draft, is performed by oxen, 
 and we are well persuaded that nothing can bo sub- 
 stituted for them, that, taking everything into consid- 
 eration, will be so profitable. In warm countries the 
 mule is probably better adapted to the climate and 
 mode of work. Still, horses are much used among 
 us in agriculture, both in conjunction with oxen, and 
 alone, and if the mere drudgery of the farm be the 
 only use, and there be no desire for a swift roadster, 
 or an elegant nag to sport with, we are inclined to 
 think the mule would be the most profitable. 

We have raised them and used them, and can tes- 
 tify to power of endurance, and durability of life. 

As a little calculation on this subject mvy be amus- 
 ing if not satisfiictory to some of our enquiring and 
 calculating readers, we will give the figures of a 
 writer in the Southern Planter, on this subject — He 
 says — 

Ten horses will consume each 12 barrels of 

corn per annum worth on an average, 

$2,50 per barrel, which for 20 years will 

be $0,000 

Shoeing ten horses at $3,00 each per annum, 

will be for 20 years GOO 

Cost of shoeing and iccding 10 horses 20 

years ?0,G00 

Ten mules will consume each C b.arrels corn 
 per annum, worth on an average 82,50 per 
 barrel, wliieh for 20 years, §3,000 

Shoeing will be nothing, 

Amount saved in 20 year;: by mules S3, 000 

This calculation will do for the South, but with us 
 the mule must be shod, and corks kept s!.-rn or he 
 will tumble down and break his neck. 

Another item might be put in, and that is, a great- 
 er exemption from di.sease, and tlie longer life the 
 mule lives and remains active over what tlie horse 

does. We never heard of a mule being killed by 
 heat as horses often are.

The Hog Crop of Ohio. 

"On the first of October about one half of the coun- 
 ties of Ohio had furnislied the Auditor of State's Of- 
 fice their annual statement of Personal Property list- 
 ed for taxation in 1853. A comparison of these 
 statements with those of the three previous years, 
 shows the following relative number of hogs listed 
 for taxation in the several counties named. Whe- 
 ther the Hog crop of the present year is re.ally as 
 much greater than former years as the tax returns 
 would indicate, or whether a very large portion of 
 the increase may not bo accounted for by the dis- 
 continuance of the two hundred dollars exemption, 
 are questions on which a divided opinion will exist."

Novel way uf liolding; a Horse. 

A gentleman traveling through Germany, thu» 
 describes a novel method of fastening a horse, which 
 he saw a German blacksmith put into practice: 

"As soon as breakfast was over, I generally en- 
 joyed the luxury of riding about town, and in pass- 
 ing the shop of a blacksmith, the manner in which 
 he tackled and shod a vicious horse amused mo. On 
 the outside of wall of the house two rings were firm- 
 ly fixed, to one of which the head of the patient was 
 lashed close to the ground; the hind foot to he shod, 
 stretched out to the utmostextent of the leg, was then 
 secured by the other ring (about five feet iiigh,) by a 
 cord which passed thmugh a cloven hitch, fixed to 
 the root of the poor creatures tail. The hind foot 
 w.as consequently very much higher than the head; 
 indeed, it was quite exalted, arid pulled so heavily 
 at the tail, that tlio animal seemed to be quite anx- 
 ious to keep his othor foot on terra finna. With one 
 foot in the heavens, it did not suit him to kick; with 
 his nose pointing to the infernal regions, he could 
 not conveniently rear, and as a heavy hand w.as con- 
 staatiy pulling at his tail, the horse at last gave up 
 the point, and quietly submitted to bo shod." — N.
