[NoVEMEEIt 

moiliuin, from three. cijliths tn one-h.alf of on inch in 
 diiimotcr; round: palo r^d; flosh very juicy, ■with lit- 
 tle or no pulp; flavor saccharine and delicious; qnali- 
 t" "licst," for an outdoor grape. Fruited in 1850 
 for the first time. 

Tie Itaahc — [Raahc's Xo. 3) — Cunijli small, com- 
 pact, rarely shouldered; berry below medium; round; 
 dark red. tliickly covered with bloom; flesh very 
 juicy, with scarcely any pulp; flavor saccharine, with 
 a good deal of the Catawba aroma: quality "best." 
 Altliouj;h the Raabc originated in the same lied with 
 the Brincklo and Emily, its unequivocal Catawba 
 flavor and native le"f induce us to believe tbat it 
 Sprung from a chance seed of the Catawba that had 
 ftccidentally gained admission into the bod. This 
 opinion is stren;;thened by the fact that the Catawba 
 was in bcaiin^s; in Mr. Raabe's garden at the time he 
 planted the seed he received from Germany. It fruit- 
 ed in 1^^50 for the first time. 

'I'll-: Ci'ara — [Raahe's No. 4) — Bunch medium; not 
 compact; berry medium; round; gro> n, faintly tinged 
 with salmon when exposed to the sun;fle h tender, 

iaicy; flavor rich, sweet, and delicious; quality "best." 
 'ruited the present season for the first time. 

From Ikttj. Gulliss: — T,'ic Gorgas Peach, two and 
 6ne-half inches by two and three quarters; roundish, 
 with a slight prominence at the apex; dull greenish 
 vrhite, clouded and blotched with red on the e.^posed 
 *ide; cavity wide, rather deep; stone free; flesh whit' 
 ish, slightly stained at the stone, juicy; flavor sac- 
 charine and exceedingly luscious; quality "best;" 
 period of maturity middb; to end of .September. This 
 line serrate variety originated with Benjamin Gul- 
 liss, N. E. corner of Pine and Schuylkill Eighth 
 fitreets, from a stone of the Morris Wliite; planted in 
 1840. It fruited in 18C0 for the first time. 

From II. B. LindUy, Athens, Ohio: — Enormous 
 (Specimen of an apple, labelled Rhode hlaiid Sweet, 
 but which we regard as I.i/man's Pumpkin Siccef. — 
 Some of them were more than three inches long, and 
 nearly fiur wide, and woighed 17 ounces; seed small, 
 rthort, plump, ov;i,l; flavor sweet and pleasant; quality 
 "good." 

From Will. Graham — gardener to the Philadel- 
 phia Blockley Alms-Mouse — The Graham Grape; an 
 accidental seedling raised by Mr. Graham. It sprung 
 np in l.'*45, imd fruited in 1850 for tlie first time. — 
 BuncUiii medium size, shouldered, not compact; her- 
 ly half an inch in diameter, round, purple, thickly 
 covered with a blue bloom: contains little or no pulp, 
 and abounds in a saccharine juice of agreealjle flavor; 
 quality "best." The leaf indicates its native parent- 
 age. It is probably a natural cross between the 
 Bland and Elsinborough, both of which were in bear- 
 ing in the garden where it originated. 

Vroni Abraham Wismer, near Ni.rristown. Perki- 
 <)men town.^hip, IMontgomery county — The Pcrkio- 
 meii Shell-bark. This the largest variety of Shell- 
 bark wo have met with, measuring an inch and tliree- 
 qarters long, one and five-eighths wide, andone thick, 
 ond with the hull on two and a half inches long, two 
 (vnd three-eighths wide, and one and seven-eighths 
 thick; reversed oblong — oorda.tt;; shell thin; kernel of 
 ♦"best" quality. 

Yrom Win. Canbij, Wilmington, Delaware — more 
 epecimens of the delicious Seedling grape described 
 (It the close of the ad interim Report fiu- September, 
 (ind which we have since nai'^ed Delaware Bitripindtj. 
 We continue to entertain the same favorable opinion 
 of its me its; and regard it a decided acquisition. 

Vrom .1. Viiik Allen., Salem, Mass. — -S'^. Gkislain 
 Pear. — Specimens remarkably fine and of unusual 

appearance; two and fire-eighths inches long, and 
 two and five-eighths inches broad; roundish, yello^v 
 with red cheek; stem three-fourths o! an inch long, 
 one-fourth thick, very fleshy; flavor fine; qualily "very 
 good." 

From. Rubert BucJianan, Cincinnati, through Hugh 
 O.impbell, Esv. — very fine specimens of six vuriitica 
 of native Grapea. 

Alexander, Schjnjlkill Muncadelle, or Cape Grape. 
 Althougu this variety is of inferior qvalilij for the 
 table, the late Sir Resor, of Cincinnati, made from 
 it a superior wine, so similar to the Constantia as to 
 be mistaken for it by some of our best wine connois- 
 seurs. 

Mammoth Catawba. — Bunch large, shouldered, not 
 compact; berr3' lurge, seven-eighths of an inch in 
 diameter; round; oi' a deeper red, and larger size than 
 the Catawba, but not so high flavored; quality "very 
 good." 

IVhite Catawba. — Bunch small; berry large, seven- 
 eighths of an inch in diameter; round; greenish white; 
 inferior to the Catawba in flavor and (lualily. 

Venango — a Seedling from theFo.x Grape. Bunch 
 of medium size; berry three-fourths of an inch in di- 
 ameter; round; pale red, attractive in appearance; 
 superior in the size of the bunch, and in qualily, to 
 its parent; quality "very good." 

Ohio, or Scyar-hox. — Bunch rather large; berry 
 small, superior in flavor to the saraa grape grown 
 here; quality "very good." 

Ilerbeniont. — Bunch rather large; berry below mp- 
 dinm; five-eighths of an inch in diameter; roundish 
 inclining to i.v.il; specimens scarcely ripe. From this 
 grape Mr. Longworth makes a wine of fine quality, 
 slosely resembling in flavor the Spanish Manzinilla. 

Fromihe Rev. S. C. Brinckle, Wilmington, Dela- 
 ware — Bonne de Zee pear; size full medium, two and a 
 half inches long by two and five-eighths broad, 
 roundish; cinnamon russet, Intersp'.'rsed with patches 
 and irregular markings of fair yellow; in which re- 
 spect, it bears a striking analogy to the exterior color- 
 ing of the Uwchlan; stem three-fourths of an inch 
 long, and two-ninths thick, inserted in a narrow, 
 superficial cavity ; calyx medium, set in a moderate- 
 ly deep, even basin ; flesh fine texture, bnttery, melt- 
 ing; flavor deliciims ; quality "very good," if not 
 "best." These specimens differed in form and color 
 from the Bonne de Zee we have more than once re- 
 ceived from Boston, which was yellow and obovate. 

From I. B. Baxter. — A Pear labelled Sienlle, nut 
 true to name; very large, fimr and one quarter 
 inches long, three and one-half broad, and weighing 
 fourteen ounces ; long, obovate, inclining to pyriform; 
 greenish yellow ; stem one and a quarter inches long 
 by three-sixteenths thick, and half an inch thick 
 near its junction with the fruit, where it is very 
 flesh}', inserted obliquely on a nearly flat surlace, 
 considerably inclined ; calyx small, set in a deep, 
 rather narmw, iurrowed basin ; seed pale cinnamon, 
 (the lightness of the color being probably owing to 
 partial decay,) two-fifths of an inch long, onc-filtlj 
 wi<le, and one-eighth thick ; long, acuminate, with 
 an angle on one side of the blunt end ; flesh slightly 
 granular, buttery, melting ; flavor rich and delicious; 
 quality "very good." 'I his is probably the Benrre 
 Sonte shown by Mr. Robert Buist at our Annual Ex- 
 hibition in 1848, and which could not bo recognized 
 by our own Pomologists or by those of Boston as any 
 known variety. The tree that produced these speci- 
 mens, and several mo e w-ilh the same label, were 
 purcljased by Mr. Buist from Thomas Lindreth,who 
 iiad imported them with a largj collscliun of other
