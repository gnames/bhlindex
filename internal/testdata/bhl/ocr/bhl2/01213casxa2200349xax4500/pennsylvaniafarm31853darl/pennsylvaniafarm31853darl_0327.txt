kinds from Franco, thruuj^h the late Jnii. B. Smith' 
 Bat on examining the inviiicc, no such name as 
 BeuiTe Soiile was to be found in it, Tiic variety, 
 Lowever, being considered valuable, scions of it were 
 videly disseminated; and some were sent to Mr. 
 Baxter. When the remaining trees, under this 
 name, in Mr. Buist's possession, fruited, they proved 
 to bethe Duchesse D'Ngoulerae. Even the identitj' 
 of the first tree with the Duchess may possibly be 
 established by further investigation, although the 
 specimens of the Beurre SoulecxhiliitcU in 1848 ap- 
 peared to all of us a separate and di.^tinct variety. 

Frotn WcsUrn New Voi-f;, through I. B. Baxter. — 
 T hc\Canan<Jaiijua I'cnr; two and a hall inches long by 
 two and a half broad , roundish — turbinati! inclin- 
 ing to pyriform, largest in tlie middle; skin smooth, 
 thin, greenish yellow, stem broken otf, inserted with- 
 out depression ; calyx medium, set in an irregular 
 furrowed basin; fli'sh fine, texture, buttery, melting, 
 and exceedingly juicy; flavor pleasant, with a deli- 
 cate aroma; qu.ality "very good." These specimens 
 differi d materially in size and form from those that 
 were exhiliited at the Second Session of the Congress 
 of Fruit Growers, at Castle Garden, New York, in 
 1849. 

'Prom liobert Tiuist — Bo?j Cieficn de Vernois ; 
 rather large, two and seven eighths inches long by 
 tvo and fivi -eighths broad; obovate; greenish yellow, 
 ■with small greenish ru-set patches, and m.any cinna- 
 mon russet dots near the crown ; .stem three-fourths 
 of an inch long, and one-sixth thick, fleshy at its 
 junction with the branch, inserted in a small depres- 
 sion; calyx closed, set in a regular, rather deep b.a- 
 ein; flegh somewhat granular, juice abundant: flesh 
 pleasant, sprightly, with some astringency. Leroy 
 places it among kitchen pears, but we consider it for 
 the table at least "good." 

From Charles Kessler, of Reading. — The liilter, a 
 native apple of Ese'er township, Berks county; two 
 and a half inches long by two and seven-eights 
 broad ; roundish oblong ; rod in stripes of varicjus 
 Lues, with many large wl.lte dots ; stem short and 
 moderately stout, inserted in a deep, narrow cavity ; 
 calyx medium, closed, set in a deep, rather wide ba- 
 sin: seed very short, plump, light cinnamon : flesh 
 lender: flavor fine: quality "very good." 

From William Knabb, Oley township, Berks co., 
 tlirough Charles Kessler. — Fine speoimens of the 
 Yost and Yacht or Jagd apples, described in our ad 
 interim Re,5ortfor December, 1852; both "very good" 
 in quality, and worthy of being wi3ely disseminated. 
 From C. F. Linen, of New Ilaven. — Wliite's Seed- 
 ling, a native pear of Connecticut. Size medium, 
 round, obovate ; greenish yellow, sometimes russeted; 
 stem rather long and slender, inserted somewhat ob- 
 liquely into a small fleshy excrescence; calyx open, 
 eegments short, set in a rather shallow basin ; flesh 
 of tine texture, buttciy, juicy; pleasant flavor; qual- 
 ity "very good." 

From Hon. B.V. French, of Braintree. — The Beur- 
 re Clairgeau. Size very large; four inches long and 
 three broad; pyriform, largi^r on one side; nearly 
 covered with russet, — patches and dots, e\en on its 
 brown cheek; stem an inch long, rather stout, fleshy 
 at both terminations, inserted obliquely with little ay 
 no depression; calxy open, segments short, ba-iin n.ar- 
 row, very superfici;il, slightly furrowed. Not sufli- 
 ciently mature for testing. 

From Mr, Eckort, of Reading. — A large pear, three 
 •Tn 1 ihrec-eighths implies long by three and three- 
 eighhs bio.ad; roundish turbinate, bright yellow, 
 with numerous small ruusct dots anil a marbled car- 

mine cheek; stem seven-eighths of an inch long and 
 one-sixth thick, inserted in a slight depression: calyx 
 medium, segments reflexed, set in a moderately deep 
 basin; seed large, dark brown, pyriform, plump, 
 terminating suddenly in a long neck; flesh somewhat 
 ciiarsc, butter}-, melting; flavor fine, with a delight- 
 ful aruma; quality "best;" eaten October IGth. Tree 
 young vigorous, very productive; leaf large, broad, 
 da: k green; branches tortuous; shoots stout, dark 
 Iwown. This wo take to be Beurre Diel; and, if wo 
 are correct in our conjecture, it is, though not the 
 largest, by far the fairest, most beautiful and deli, 
 cious specimen of that variety we have ever seen; in- 
 deed we have rarely met with the Beurre Diel more 
 than simply "good" in quality. 

From Joshua I'iorce, of Washington, D. C. — Three 
 varieties of pears, and one of persimmons: 

St. Mi •hel Arcbange, true to mime, of fine size, 
 and, at least, "very good" in quality. 

Verte Longue Panache or Culotte Suisse, prized 
 only for it* curious longitudinal green and yellow 
 stripes. 

A Kitchen Pear, without a name; very large, three 
 and three quarter inches long by three and one-quar- 
 ter br<iad; said to be fine for culinary purposes, and 
 remarkable for its productiveness. 

Persimmons, (Diospyros virginiana,) of extraordi- 
 nary size, measuring an inch and a half long, one 
 and three-quarter.', broad, and five and a quarter 
 inches in circumference, and weighing an ounce and 
 a halt; form roundish-oblate. Being pulled prema- 
 turely, they were not in eating; condition, and h,ad 
 probably not acquired their appropriate color. AVe 
 should be happy again to receive specimer.s of this 
 variety, to test its (|uality, when it tias attained its 
 por.ect maturity, and h.as been suljected tothe ame- 
 liorating influences of frost. Six or seven years ago, 
 the Bon Jardinier informed us that two Ilorticultu- 
 fists in France had been (xperimenting with the 
 American Persimmon, with a view to its improve- 
 ment, and had arrived lit encouraging results. One 
 of them succeeded in raising a Seedling which bore 
 "large round fruit double the size of the original 
 species, the flavor of which recalls that of a Mira- 
 belle plum." The other originated a variety, which, 
 in honor of a friend, he named "Plaqueminier Pier- 
 quin," producing "fruit as large as a ben's egg, 
 oval acuminate, of a golden yellow color, and an 
 agreeable flavor." Neitlier of these new kinds, so 
 far as our information extends, has yet been import- 
 ed into this country. 

Tlie reports of the committee for awarding pre- 
 miums at the 25th exhibition were submitted and 
 adop'.ed: 

Alderuey Cows. 

There is a good deal of enquiry lately, lor Alder- 
 ncy stock, in daiiy districts, where milk and butter 
 are the main objects. As cows and heifers of this 
 breed are scarce, we would recommend, farmers, hav- 
 ing good milkers of any of ournative breeds, to cross 
 them with an Alderncy Bull. In this way it is high- 
 ly (irobable, a good milking stock of cows may be got 
 up. 

We know where 2 or 3 fine young Bulls, thorough 
 bred Alderncy can be purchased, should any of our 
 friends through the State wish to give them a trial.
