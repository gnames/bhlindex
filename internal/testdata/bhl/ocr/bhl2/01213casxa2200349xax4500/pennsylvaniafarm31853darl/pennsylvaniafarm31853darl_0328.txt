WAGENER'S CLOVER AND TIMOTHY SEED HUIil^ER. 

The patentee of the above implement, Jeptha A- 
 Wagener, has favored us with a cut and descriptiou, 
 as follows : 

It was patented, May 24, 1S53. A machine is on 
 exhibition at the Crystal Palace, at the fair of the 
 American Institute, and the Maryland Institute, 
 Baltimore. We have not seen it in operation, but it is 
 recommended by the certificates of several farmers. 

It consists of a simple frame and box mounted on 
 wheels, in front of which is a cylinder, set with 
 spiral knives, acting in concert with curved spring 
 teeth, in combination with a straight knife, which 
 forms a perfect shear, and severs the head from the 
 stalk, which is, at the same time, discharged into 
 the bos. The teeth being made to spring and vi- 
 brate, not a particle of clover, however stalky or 
 thick, can possibly escape being cut, or allow the 
 teeth to become clogged. The machine is so con- 
 structed that it can be made adjustable tothehei|;ht 
 of the el(jver and timothy. 

With the aid of one horse and a boy, this ma- 
 chine will harvest iicdve acres per day, thus effect- 
 ing a saving of fully one liundred per cent., by mow- j 
 ing, raking, drawing, stacking, and threshing the] 
 heads from the stalks all at the same time, and also I 
 retaining the manure to the land, the value of which 
 every farmer will at once appreciate. 

The price of the machine is moderate. Persons j 
 wishing machines or furthci iufuraiation should ad-' 
 dress J. A. Wagener, 137 Madison street. Now York, 
 or at Pultnev, Steuben county, New York. 

Mineral Phospliate of l.ime. 

Wo have heard but little recently of the bed of 
 this valuable substance discovered in the upper pai't 
 of New Jersey, and which wiis at first considered 
 both here and in England of much importance. Pro- 
 fessor Johns on, sarcastically remarked, it would not 
 be appreciated in America, and would be available 
 to farmei's on that side of the Atlantic, more than 
 to our own. ' ' 

Can any of our readers, inform as whether it has 
 been exported to any extent, and what use has been 
 made of it here. 

Agricultural Exhibition in New Castle connty 
 Delaware. 

This exhibition came off at the time appointed last 
 month, in Wilmington, on the grounds near the city, 
 where permanent fixtures have been erected. We 
 not attend ourselves, but one of our friends, who did, 
 reports his great surprise at the small attendance of 
 farmers, and apparent want of interest. Will some 
 of our friends in Delaware inform us why this is so. 
 It is well known, that in that little State renowned 
 for her distinguished men, and where now reside, 
 some of the best farmers and fruit growers, in the 
 country, there is the raw material for making one of 
 the fin3st exhibitions in the Union, in every depart- 
 ment. Except in Agricultural Implements, in which 
 a very fine display was made by Messrs. S. & M. 
 Pennock, who have recently established a large Ag- 
 ricultural Warehouse in Wilmington, and perhaps 
 also in fine Devon's from C. P. Holcomb, who has 
 long been eminent as a breeder of this stock, the ex- 
 hibition in oilier respects was rather meagre. Our 
 friend suggested, that if the price of membership, 
 in the society, now $2 00 was reduced to one half or 
 even one fourth, a more pOK'raZ interest, would per- 
 haps be excited through the State and a large acces- 
 sion of names. In our Chester County Society re- 
 organized this season, after a lapse of several years, 
 the first exhibition has just been hold and attended it 
 was estimated by 10,000 persons. 

The price of membership was fixed at 50cents, and 
 the number of members is about 700. The object in 
 the low price, was to enlist the interest of all the fai^ 
 mers of the county, and it has had the effect antici- 
 pated.

Bradford County Exhibition. 

This, i\iC fust fair of the Bradford County Agri- 
 cultural Society appears to have succeeded beyond 
 axpeotation. A gentleman in Towanda, writing to 
 his friend in Tioga, says : 

"The first Agricullural Fair of Bradford county 
 closed last evening, after a very successful exhibition 
 of two days. Tlie attendance was very large, the 
 receipts from members and from admissions, amount 
 to 1825, thus putting the Society in a very good po- 
 sition, entirely removing any apprehension as to its
