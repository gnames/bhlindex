future success. The contributions were very nume- 
 rous, and very creditable to the farmers of the coun- 
 ty-" 
 Among other articles which received premiums, 

we were struck with the account of a crop of wheat 
 raised by John McCord, of that county. It was of 
 the blue stem variety, and the product of 6 acres was 
 354 bushels, or 59 bushels to the acre, and the wheat 
 weighed 64 lbs. to the bushel. This is an extraordinary 
 crop and will no doubt be brought before the State So- 
 ciety at its meeting in January for a premium. We 
 doubt if it will be exceeded in the State, i.radford 
 joins Susquehanna county, where G. Walker's great 
 crop of corn was raised last year. Some "spirit" of 
 improvement must have broke loose, and been "rap- 
 ping" the farmers in those border counties, or else 
 there is a kind of conspiracy there to raise the 
 largest crops in the State, and obtain all the premi- 
 ums. Tioga is the adjoining county on the west, 
 and we shall nut be surprisjd to hear of the next 
 great report from her.

 French Butter Pumpkins. 

Mr. Editor: — In order to draw the attention of 
 the lovers of pumpkin pie to the above very excel- 
 lent variety of table pumpkin, lately introduced from 
 France, I send you the product of a vine wliich grew 
 on my premises during the past season. The vine 
 produced four pumpkins, which weighed as follows : 
 100 lbs., GO lbs., 40 lbs. and 38 lbs. The diameters 
 of the largest one was 12 inches one way, 23 inches 
 the other. The shorter diameter being from the 
 stem to the blossom end. They can no doubt be 
 grown to a larger size, as the above grew in a soil 
 not biglily manured, and it did not receive any extra 
 cultivation. CASPER HILLER.

These papers have recently been discontinued, and 
 nro now merged in the American Agriculturist, the 
 first number of which was issued on the 1st of Sep- 
 tember. It is in the quarto form and to be publish- 
 ed weekly, price $2: edited by A. B. Allen and 0. 
 Judd. It is got up in neat style, and from the long 
 experience, both as editors and farmers of the Messrs. 
 Allen, whose names arc a kind of household words 
 in most of the farm houses in the country, there 
 15 no doubt of an ably conducted periodical, 
 and we wish it the best success. O. Judd ia also well 
 known as an able writer on practical and scientific 
 agriculture.

For the Farm JournaL 
 Best Breed of Mutton Sheep. 

Messrs. Editors: — As each of us has his favorite 
 object of pursuit, (to which is attached of course su- 
 perior importance,) it is not to be wondered at that 
 we frequently come in contact with others, holding 
 different opinions from ourselves. 

Having been a breeder of a small flock of sheep 
 for the last fifty years, and having commenced with 
 the then common breed of the country and an im- 
 ported Irish ram, I bred quite a number that were 
 sold to butchers in Philadelphia, at from §8 to $12 
 per head, but found the wool too coarse for the then 
 common homespmi clothing. I then bred the Leices- 
 ters, BakexoelV s favorite breed, and if Youatt is good 
 authority, they were then England's favorites, and I 
 am not yet sure that they do not continue to be so 
 on their strong rich pastures, notwithstanding the 
 great ado there is about the fashionable Cotswolds. 
 At the recently reported sale that took place in 
 Kentucky, a Cotswold ram sold for §1010 and a Lei- 
 cester for §50. Now this only goes according to my 
 opinion to show the misguided zeal of us Americans 
 in giving size the preference over qualify, and I may 
 instance another remarkable feature in the majority 
 of our breeders, and which I conceive is admirably 
 calculated to keep us on the back-ground, and that 
 is their great inclination to mix up the different 
 breeds. 1 have just noticed in the Southern P.anter 
 in an article headed the "Best Breed of Mutton 
 Sheep," a proposition to mix up the Southdowns 
 and New Oxfordshires in this country. The author 
 goes on to give an account of what he no doubt be- 
 lieves to be a successful attempt, recently made in 
 England to establish a new breed by a cross of these 
 two breeds. Now I do not feel at all disposed to 
 discredit his statements, for if it can be done the 
 English breeders are the men to accomplish it, and 
 not we Americans. I could cite numerous instances 
 in Youatt's history of the different breeds of sheep, 
 (a work of over GOO pages,) in which complete fail- 
 ures occurred in England in attempts made to < stab- 
 lish a breed by crossing two distinct breeds. And 
 now to give my candid opinion I have but little 
 faith in the project, although I am well aware that 
 some of our finest animals are cross bred ones. 

Youatt, in speaking of what the Downs were 
 originally, says, page 233, "since that time tliey have 
 materially improved; yet not by any admixture of 
 foreign blood, f r even the cross with the Leicester 
 was a, failure; and the promised advantages to be de- 
 rived from the Merinoes were delusive." 

In page 181, it is stated that "Mr. Ellman, in his 
 examination before the House of Lords says that he 
 abandoned the Merinoes from the difficulty he had 
 in selling them in a lean state, the grazers did not then 
 like to h.ave them; he then tried to feed them him- 
 self, but he found that he could fatten three Sjijth-
