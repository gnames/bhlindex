NEW YORK STATE FAIR.

New York Stato Fair. 

As the stock and stock breeders of New York, are 
 somewhat famous all over the Union, more attention 
 having been longer devoted to this department there 
 than in any other State, we extract from the Rural 
 New Yorker, the annexed account, of the late State 
 Exliibitidn at Saratoga, which will be interesting to 
 a largo portion of our readers, and keep them posted 
 up with the names of most of the eminent breeders 
 and be convenient in case of a wish to make pur- 
 chases. It says: 

Exhibition of Stock. 

Of all Fairs we have attended on this side of the 
 Atlantic, that at Saratoga, in the Stock Department, 
 ■was the best. Usually an immense number of in- 
 ferior animals are shown that had better be kept at 
 home, but this year the exhibition was, what a State 
 Fair should be — select. 

The righc-hand side, as you enter, is devoted to 
 chickens. Large numbers of the Asiatic breeds, as 
 well as the good old Dorking and Game, Spanish, 
 Poland, and other well known breeds were largely 
 shown. S. T. Andrew, West Cornwall, Ct. anil D. 
 P. Newell, Rochester, figured largely in this line. 

Fine wooled sheep came next. Few were shown. 
 In quality and numbers, the Fairs at Rochesters and 
 Utca were much the best. F. W. Dean, West Corn- 
 wall, Vt., exhibited some good Spanish ewes and a 
 very large Spanish Merino buck. Joseph Ilaswell, 
 lloosic, N. Y., also showed some fine ewes of this 
 breed. French Merinos were poorly represented. G. 
 W. McKee, Cambridge, AVash. Co., exhibited three 
 very superior bucks. A two year old, bought ol Maj. 
 Sanford, Vt., was a perfect beauty. A first-rate 
 three-year from Jewett, Vt.: another, a yearling was 
 a very gool sheep. Felix Weeden, Preston Hollow, 
 Alb. CO., showed a good buck and ewe. 

The mutton sheep were well represented — not so 
 many from Canada as in former shows, but from our 
 own State. We are sorry to miss the fine animals 
 of our Canadian brethren, but at the snme time we 
 are very glad to see that New York farmers are en- 
 tering with their usual energy and gu-a-headative- 
 ncss into the breeding of supeiior muttm sheep. 

Of Leicesters, J. A. and S. N. Rathl)one showed 
 some very fine animals. Ilungerford & Brodie, Jeifer- 
 Bon Co., were the largest exhibitors. Seven year 
 ling ewes, recently impm-tej, are excelhmt, as are 
 also the six two year old ewes which took the jirize 
 as yearlings last year. Their imported buck did not 
 please us, but the yearling bucks are first-rate — on ■ 
 of them is very superior. One fat ewe a beauty — was 
 sold for 130 to go to Kentucky. One of the four 
 buck lambs shown bids fair to be a fine fellow. 

South-Downs were shown in fine ] erfection. — L. G. 
 Morris, Mt. Fordham, N. Y., exhibited a recently 
 imported buck from Jonas Webb, which for one of 
 his stock, struck us as r.ither to.ir.se, but it had a 
 corresponding degree of strength and muscularity, 
 and is on the whole an animal of rare merit. Z. B. 
 Wiikeman, Herkimer, exiubited a lai'ge number su- 
 perior South Downs. 

There were but seven animals of the Cotswold and 
 •New Oxfordshire breeds exhibited, at least that we 
 saw. E. Gazely, Clinton, showed four splendid bucks 
 of the Cotswold breed. Wyant and Younghams, 
 Sand Lake, Rens. co., exiiibited three New Oxford- 
 shire sheep which we took for good Cotswokls. 

Swine. — In this department the exhibition has 

never been excelled. L. G. Morris showed some 
 splendid Berkshires; quite a number of Fisher Ilobbs 
 Black Essex, and some very superior Suffolks. Those 
 who liave a prejudice against color will not like the 
 Essex so well as the Suffolks or Middlesex; they are 
 nevertheless a remarkable breed, fattening with great 
 rapidity and maturing early. Suifulks were well and 
 largely represented. This breed evidently stands 
 high in public estimation. Besides the fine animals 
 of L. G. Morris, Nelson Richards, Vergennes, Vt., 
 showed a superior 2 year old boar of the Stickney 
 Breed. — Le Roy Mowry, Union Village, Wash. Co., 
 and Zoar Rider, Cambridge, AVash. Co., exhibited 
 good two year old boars. Other exhibitors deserve 
 mention, but our space forbids. Seth Whalen, West 
 Milton, Sar, C, exhibited 9 very good shoats of the 
 AVhite Leicester breed. Z. B. Wakeman, Herkimer, 
 showed a boar, a cross of the celebrated Leicester 
 and Berkshire breeds, of enormous size. B. Davis, 
 Vernon, also exhibited a very good G month old boar 
 and sow. There were no Chinese, Middlesex, or 
 Yorkshire pigs exhibited. 

Houses. — Owing to the number of Black ILiwks 
 brought from Vermont and other States, the show of 
 Horses was the best ever witnessed in this State. 
 The old original Black Hawk, 22 years old, was on 
 the ground, as active and sprightly and at the same 
 time more compact and powerful than m.any of his 
 colts. This breed, unsurpassed in the world, is ex- 
 posed to deterioration from the go-a-head tendencies 
 of the age. The mares and colts were a sorry set. 
 Many mares were exhibited that had evidently been 
 selected as breeders because they were good fin- noth- 
 ing else. We suppose the object of the exhibitors 
 was to show how good a colt a poor mare might be 
 made to produce. 

Cattle. — The show of ShorWiorns, though not 
 large was never so good in quality at any previous 
 fixir. Morris & Becar, of New York exhibited 28 
 head. Their recently imported 4 year old Bull 
 "Balco" (not shown for a premium,) is one of tlie 
 finest animals we ever saw. Many of the Short-horns, 
 exhibited by the same gentlemen are bad in the 
 the crops, — especially is this true of the "Marquis of 
 Carribus," "Balco," "Songstress," "Beauty," and 
 other recently imported animals will do much to cor- 
 rect this deficiency. Geo. Vail showed five head — for 
 sale. E. J. Alden' Boston, showed a very good three 
 year old bull, David Calkins, China, Wyom. Co., 
 exhibited a very good 4 year old bull. Mr. Wm. 
 Bullock, Betlilehcm, Alb. Co., showed some fiir an- 
 imals. Wood Converse Co., AVoodviUe, Jeff. Co., 
 showed a first rate 4 year old bull. 

Devuns wore not so well or so numerously repre- 
 sented as at Rochester. There were, however, some 
 splendid animals exhibited. Those of W. O. Faile, 
 West Farms; and of the Messrs. A\''ainwright, Rhine- 
 bejk, particularly pleased us. L. G. JLirris had 
 some very good animals. J. B. Tuckerman, Richfield, 
 Ots. Co., showed a very good two year old bull. Geo. 
 Vail, Troy, showed some goodauimtils, but not quite 
 what we should expect from so celebrated and skill- 
 ful a breeder. 

The largest breeder of Ilerefords in the State,AVm. 
 H. Sotham, Pifl'ard, Liv. Co., did not exhibit in con- 
 sequence of the points of excellence adopted by the 
 Society. Nevertheless there was a good show, indi- 
 cating that his breed is looking up. E. Corning, jr., 
 Albany, showed 1-1 very superior animals, — a three 
 year old bull, a yearling bull, and two cows, par- 
 ticularly' pleased us. Remington & Bowen, Sunnet, 
 Cay, Co., exhibited some first rate animals "Ijought
