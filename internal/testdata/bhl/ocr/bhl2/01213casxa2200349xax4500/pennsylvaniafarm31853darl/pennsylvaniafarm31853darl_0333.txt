FRUIT CULTURE IN DELAWARE.

of Mr. Sutham. 

For the .sliambles and the dairy the Ayshire breed 
 is unsurpassed, yet it was poorly represented. E. P. 
 Prentice, Albany, and llungerlord & Brodie, Jeff'. 
 Co., were about the only exhibitors. The ani- 
 imals of Mr. Prentice are well known — they have 
 few superiors. The <ither gentlemen showed a two 
 year old bull, an imported and very superior animal, 
 and also a very pretty heifer with the milkiug points 
 well developeil. 

In grade animals there was rather a meagre show. 
 There was, liowever, some very fair animals exhibi- 
 ted. There were a tolerably good herd of fat cattle 
 from K_y., on the ground. Working osoa were well 
 represented, and what is better were well trained. 
 Elon Sheldon, Sennet, Cay. Co., showed 14 yoke. 

Fruit Culture in Delaware. 

One of the most interesting of the recent patent 
 office reports, is that of George P. Fisher, dated Do- 
 ver, Delaware, embracing many valuable hints, as 
 to the management of Peach Orchards, in that great 
 peach district, and the planting and subsequent 
 treatment of the trees. AVe are gratified to hear that 
 here is increased attention being given to fruit culture 
 in that region. With the great facilities of transporta- 
 tion both north and south, it has always seemed to us, 
 that next to wheat, fruit is naturally their great 
 staple. Hundreds of acres shoul 1 be planted there 
 with apple and pear trees, for the supply of the 
 Philadelphia market and for export. His reply to 
 the circular says : 

The culture of fruit is receiving increased atten- 
 tion here, and the spirit of enterprise is well reward- 
 ed. I have no doubt that apples enough can be 
 grown on an acre to render the crop an exceedingly 
 prolitable one. I can say nothing with regard to the 
 comparative value of apples and potatoes lor feeding 
 liogs and cattle. The varieties of apples that are 
 mostly s'jught after here for winter use are the New- 
 town Pippin, and a handsome dark-red apple called 
 ■'Carthouse.'' The last named apple 1 believe is 
 very little known in latitudes higher than Z'J". It 
 somewhat resembles tlie "Pomme d'Api" in flavor, 
 but is verymuc:i larger, and in shape more round. 
 The variety which seems to keep best or longest is 
 the Butcher a|)ple, and next to this is the ''Grind- 
 stone." These varieties will keep till April and 
 May. Th.' most saleable apples we send to tiie Phil- 
 adelphia market are the Belleflower and Pippin. — 
 We have no such thing in this section as "blight" on 
 apple trees, nor are wo ever troubled with borers, of 
 which so much complaint is made in the more North- 
 ern States. Our pear trees are somewhat affected by 
 "blight" which some of our fruit growers think is 
 occasioned by electricity, and undertake to prevent 
 by laying blacksmiths' cinders at the roots of the 
 trees. The yellows on peach trees we believe can bo 
 prevented, but d(i not think a tree can be saved after 
 it is once attacked. This disease first manifests it- 
 self by causing the tree to put forth from the trunk 
 or larger limbs bunches of very delicate switches or 
 sprouts, bearing a very narrow, sickly-looking leaf. 
 As soon as this symptom is discovered the tree must 
 be removed, root and branch, and the wludc should 
 betaken to some point remote from the orchard and 
 burnt. If you attempt to trim off the diseased part 
 and touch another tree to trim it with the same knife 

the latter is certain to be contaminated. So, if you 
 allow the diseased tree to put forth its flowers or 
 blossoms after the symptom above named appears, 
 the disease is certain to be carried by the bees to the 
 surrounding trees. By this treatment, and by culti- 
 vating the orchard every year in corn or truck, we 
 seldom hear of the "yellows," and our orchanh are 
 kept in good bearing condition for twelve or fifteen 
 years. 1 know an orchard of fifty acres, immediate- 
 ly in this vicinity, that has been thus managed, and 
 the owner told me to-day that at least 90 per cent, 
 of the trees planted by liim in 1838-'39 are still in 
 their prime, and bid lair to last for several years to 
 come. He has also made it a point to give his trees 
 a dressing with softsoap at least once in three years. 
 This keeps the bark in a smooth, clean, and healthy 
 state. If you will dip your hand in the soap and 
 then place it upon the body of a peach tree, you 
 will see the prints of your fingers for at least 
 twelve months. The soap may be applied with 
 the hand, when the tree is small, and with a large 
 paint or white wash brush, when it is grown larg- 
 er. It is only to be applied to the trunk and care 
 should be taken to prevent its touching the leaves or 
 small Ijoughs, as it will destroy the leaves and ininre 
 the buds. The best method of transplanting known 
 with us is the following : 1st. Have your trees fresh 
 from the nurserj'. If practicable, the holes should 
 bo prepared to receive them before they are removed 
 at all. '.'d. Take up as much of the root as possible, 
 od. Let the holes be dug at le.ist tijree feet in diame- 
 ter and two spits deep; then till in the first or lowest 
 spit with the soil; place your tre3 in the hole, having 
 all the side roots in their natural position, and fill iu 
 with soil; no yellow dirt should be used in the filling. 
 The soil should be moderately packed and rounded 
 up in pyramidal form about the trunk of the tree 
 some two inches above the mark made by the ground 
 in the nurser}'. 4th. Make a small trench around 
 the periphery of the hole, so that no water shall set- 
 tle around the trunk, but to secure water at the ex- 
 tremities of the roots. If the trees have been seve- 
 ral days taken from the nursery, they should, before 
 being set out, have the roots soaked 24 hours in 
 water, so as to have the pores free for the early cir- 
 culation of the sap. For the first two seasons the 
 trees should be mulched as soon as the warm, dry 
 we\ther begins — that is, have half rotted straw 
 placed around the root and lower part of the trunk, 
 about a wheelbarrow load fur each tree. If the 
 ground is poor, about a hanuful or two of guano 
 may, with great advantage, be mingled with the soil 
 — that is, throw it in the bottom of the hole. I have 
 little or no experience in grafting or budding. Our 
 nurserymen furnish us with trees at a very moderate 
 cost, and the trees are always what they are sold 
 for; so that it is less troublesome, and not more ex- 
 pensive, .0 supply ourselves iu this way than to raise 
 our own trees. 

Prize Paper upon the Vine Disease. — The Society 
 of Encouragement, of France, offers a jirize of 3,000 
 francs to the author of the best paper upon the disease 
 of the vine; a prize of 3,O0U francs for the disc ivery 
 of the most efficacious preventive against it, and nine 
 prizes of 500 francs each to the authors of memoirs 
 upon nine different subjects, which it gives connect- 
 ed with the disease. 

Paint Your Tools. — Every farmer should be pro- 
 vided with a small quantity of the coarser kinds of 
 paint — a few pots and brushes and paint, oil, and 
 should keep his carts, wagons, sleds, plows, harrews, 
 &c., well coated with paint.
