If. w much Pork will a bushel ofCiiru Blake. 

Tliis I consider an important questimi, and one 
 that all farmers ouglit to be able to answer. I will 
 answer the quesliun by giving tbe result of an aciii- 
 al experiment, wliicli is the only vraj' of obtaining; 
 correct information. Some years ago I was ilesiroiis 
 of obtaining; infunaation as to the best mode and 
 most profitable way of fattening bo;;s. I inquired of 
 my neighbors and iound some in favor of close iliur- 
 cd pens, and others large dry lots: and as to the amount 
 of pork a bnsliel of corn would malie; their opinicms 
 were as various as their countenances. I Avas just 
 begintiinp: to farm, and as I was desirous of knowing 
 the best way of i'attening hogs. I determined to try 
 the different plans, and also how much pork a barrel 
 of corn would make. I made a floored pen and cov- 
 ered it in. AVeighed three hogs and put them in the 
 pen. I also weighed three of llie same size and put 
 them in a dry lot — average weight J75 lbs. I fed 
 six barrels of corn to the six hogs. They were forty 
 days eating the corn^wilh a plenty of salt and water. 
 Their average gain was 75 lbs. The hogs in the 
 lot gained the most. One that was fattened in the 
 lot gained 88 lbs. One in the pen gained 84 lbs.; the 
 other lour won; not so thrifty, these hogs were about 
 fourteen months old when slaughtered. I put them 
 up the 25th of Ootoher. There was a good deal of 
 sleet and snow during the monthof November, which 
 gave the hogs in the pen an advantage they would not 
 hafo had if the weather was favorable; they eat the 
 same quantity of grain in the siime time. It also 
 shows that one bushel of corn voiU make 15 lbs. of 
 pork; ami that the six barrels of ccjrn made fl 1.25c. 
 worth of pork, at 2\ els. per lb.; and that the farmer 
 gets 12\ cts. for his labor of feeding per bushel, over 
 selling at 25 cts. per bushel. 

Ilogs will fatten laser in September and October, 
 than they will in colder weather. A few years ago 
 1 fed one barrel of corn to a very fine Berktihire hog 
 that was aljout 30 months idd, (shortly after being 
 castrated) in the mimths of August .and Sctember, 
 and he gained 97 lbs., in 35 days, which was the 
 length of time he was eating the barrel of corn, lie 
 run on a clover lot, which was of gieat advantage. 
 This last experii;.ent is considerably over an averoge, 
 and would not hold good with common hogs. From 
 the above experiment it will be seen that 3.f lbs. of 
 corn, supposing the corn to weigh 55 lbs. toihe bushel 
 will make 1 lb. of pork. Mr. Arnott, as quoted from 
 the Geiies.ice Fannrr, "thinks 5 lbs. of ciu-n will pro- 
 duce 1 lb. of pork!" This "think'' td" Mr. .Amolt's 
 will not hold good with an experiment. Subsequent 
 observation has satisfied nie lliat the loregoing e:;per- 
 sment, as detailed, will do to practice upon. 

Another very important question, or inquiry sug- 
 gests itself from the foregoing: and that is what it is 
 ■worth to raise f.ogs to the average weight of 175 lbs. 
 A correct answer to this question, based on actual 
 experiment, would bo of great importance to farmers. 
 To value the grass, clover and grain fields that the 
 hog feeds on while growing to a gross weight of 180 
 lbs. <ir 200 l))s., is scarcely susceptible cf being ar- 
 rived at by experiment; yet with these assistants I 
 can raise a hi>g to weigh 175 lbs. and over, with one 
 barrel of eo, n. Jt will be seen fri m these estimates, 
 that two barrels ipf corn, with the adv.inlage of grass, 
 clover and grain fudds, will produce about 200 UiS. 
 of nelt pork, or 250 lbs. gniss. Estimating the corn 
 at 25c. a 1 ushel, this wouUl give the farmer $1.50 for 
 his grass, elove,r grain fields, capital stock, and Ins 
 labor. To sell corn at 25 cents a bushels, is very un- 
 profitablo business, when we take into consideration 

the wear of the land; and p )rk at §2.50 per 100 lbs. 
 is a very slow business. It wo take into account the 
 absolute necessity of clovcring our land ami improvo 
 if, I have no hesitation in saying that it is bitter for 
 the farmer to raise pork at $2.50, than to sell coin 
 at 25 cents per bushel. 

Hogs do best in large fields with plenty of water' 
 and the farmer who cuts up his corn in the month® 
 of September and October, and hauls if cut <.n his 
 fields, will be amply paid for his labor in tlic im- 
 provement of his land from the stalks, and manure 
 of the hog.. It is a great saving of labor to turn the 
 hogs in the field, when the quantilv of the logs and 
 size of the field suit. AV. M. JACKSON.

Impriivcci Car fur Transporiing Cattle. 

One of tiie greatest benefits conferred by railroads 
 i,ipan our people, wdio dwell in cities like New York 
 is the tratisportaiion of cattle from distant phices. 
 Formerly the cattle which were intended for slaugh- 
 ter in this city, and other cities, were marched fiom 
 Ohio, Canad;i, and the AVestcin paits of this f"1ate, 
 over bad roads, frequently tiaveting three ni d four 
 hundred miles bcfiire they re; ched their deslinalion. 
 The time required to perioim such journeys was 
 long, being no less than six df:js nnd a qunr'.er. at 
 the rate of twenty miles per day. This was allend- 
 ed with great expense, great labor, and exposure of 
 drovers. and cattle. One of the greatest drawbacks 
 to the old system of droving, w:is the great loss of 
 beef in cattle from long journeys, and this was a 
 loss, too, as great to the consumers as the drovers- 

The transportation of cattle on r.ailroads saves the 
 loss of beef, as they sufler no fiXtiguo, t:nd are but a 
 short time (m the road. Cattle can also Vc Iri ught 
 from much greater distances to cities ; indeed they 
 arc lironght now from places at such remote distan- 
 ces from New York, that it would have been imp<'S- 
 siblc to bring them thetiec <in foot. They arc also 
 brought wilhout trouble, and require but liMle at- 
 tendance. AVith respect to the vehich B — the cars 
 for transporting calllc- it has been found that fome 
 improvements were requited, and Andrew E. Die kin 
 son, of Ilernby, N, Y., has tiiksn measures (o secure 
 a patent for such a purpose, the nature of wdiich ini- 
 provemcn! consists in ]ilaeing in the body of the car 
 a rack extending its whide length, and having the 
 lower ends of its uprights secured by pivots to the 
 sill piece, and the upper ends secured by pins be- 
 tween the joiits. By this airanjcmeiit of t! e riicks of 
 the animals, to make each occupy a certain j ortion 
 I f the ear: this prevents one interfering wiiii or in- 
 juring another. These cars arc manulaitured ly
