County Fairs in Pennsylvania fur 1853. 

The progress of agricultural improvement in Penn- 
 Bjlvania as evinced in the number, and success of the 
 different county Fairs the present feason,is truly en- 
 couraging. It shows there is a fpirit abroad, and a 
 determination that the Key Stone, shall fully keep 
 up with the times, and that she shall not be outstrip- 
 ped in any department of her Agriculture by States 
 either north or south of her. Her present high po- 
 eition we think, is to a great extent owing to th ' 
 establishment of the State Agricultural Society, and 
 the stimulus thus given to the formation of societies 
 in the different counties. Great credit is due to Judge 
 Watts, Messrs. Oowen, Roberts, Jessup, ITeister, 
 Irwin, Mumma, Elwyn, Shubert, and many others we 
 could name, who took the initiative in its formation, 
 felt its necessity, and that without it, our State, a 
 bounding in Agricultural resources, would become 
 isolated, and almost a by word of reproach, Ths ef- 
 fort under considerable discouragements and predic- 
 tions of failure, succeeded, our State Society has held 
 three successful exhibitions the last one exceeding in 
 its gross receipts any State Extiibition yet held in 
 the Union. Something is now wanted to produce a 
 concert of action, between it and the different cour.ty 
 organizations. These latter, are now entirely inde- 
 pendent of it and eacIi[other, acting within their own 
 sphere, and unconnected in any way with that of the 
 State. There is a very largeaniount of strength, thus 
 lost, and much available information, which like lit- 
 tle rills running into a larger stream might bediffus- 
 ed more extensively, and be more directly and posi- 
 . tively uscfuK It would we think be desirable, that 
 Tej orts should be annually made out, from the statis- 
 tics within reach of the county Societies as to the 
 state of Agriculture and Horticulture intheir respec- 
 tive districts, and which should be embodied for pub- 
 lii .ition, by the State Society. In this way, a bon<t 
 of union would bo cemented among our farmers, and 
 the vants as well as the riches of each section, fully 
 brought out. More county exhibitions have been 

held this season, in Pennsylvania than ever before. 
 In addition to those previously noticed, we publish 
 such information about the following, as we hava 
 been able to collect. We should be obliged if the 
 secretaries of any of which have been omitted, would ' 
 forward reports. 

Bedford CoCNTY.-^The Enquirer, published at 
 Bedford says: 

Bedford county proves by this exhibition that sho 
 can raise as good stock, and all kinds of produce as 
 any other county in the State. The horses, cattle, 
 hogs and slioep, exhibiled would do honor to any 
 cimimunity. As good wheat, rye, corn and oats, wero 
 shown as can be pruduced anywhere. Our farmers 
 appear to take a lively interest in the work, and wa 
 have no doubi tliat next year will be as great an im- 
 provement on the present as this has been on tho 
 hist. Our mechanics, also did themselves great cred- 
 it, by the display of their ingeniousand useful mech- 
 anism. Great praise is also due to the ladies for tho 
 exhibition of their many useful and tasteful articles. 
 In fact all engaged in the affair are entitled to the 
 highest praise. 

The 4 samples of wheat which received the nre- 
 miiim, we observed weighed respectively GO, COJ and' 
 68.} lbs. The yield to the acre is not stated, but the 
 above weights arc rather uncommon. 

Montour County. — The exhibition of this society 
 came off on the 20 and 21st of October and embrac- 
 ed the usual display and variety of stock of all kind» 
 also fruit, vegetables, grain, implements, domestio 
 manufactures; miscellaneous articles, and also «■ 
 ploughing match. The Shanghais and Chittagongs 
 have found their way up into that region as well 39 
 other parts of the State. The attendance of farmers 
 and mechanics, as well as ladies appears to have beeir 
 large on both days. An address was delivered by 
 .Judge Cooper, containing many excellent hints for 
 the farmers, to increase the quantity and quality of 
 their products. It is highly commended. After pay- 
 ing all expenses and premiums, a fund was left oj» 
 band for another year. Montour county has dono 
 exceeding well, for this her first exhibition.
