and we believe is the first since the organization of 
 her Agricultural Society, The managers in their ra- 

port gay; 

To superintend such an affair was entirely new to 
 us, and eonscquently made us liable to commit some 
 errors — {or wliicli we have only to say, by way of 
 apology, that we endeavored to do our duty. 

On Friday a heavy shower of rain caused not only 
 a falling off in the number of visitors but also in tlie 
 receipts of the society — but notwithstanding all the 
 untoward circumstances, we realized a sufficient sum 
 to pay all the printed premiums with an additiim of 
 $183, as discretionary pi-emiums, which has been 
 divided between the different classes of exhibitors 
 according to the recommendationsof the various com- 
 mittees; and we think there will be an amount left 
 Bufficient to pay all expenses and leave in the treasu- 
 ry $100 — a little more than was in it at the time we 
 were authorized to make our arrangements for the 
 exhiljition. 

We observe, in the list of premiums, this society 
 have adopted the feature, quite common in the inte- 
 rior of the State, and a very commendable one too, of 
 making their exhibitions, not simply agrieuUui"al and 
 horticultural, but to include almost every department 
 of domestic manufacture, andliome industry, mechan- 
 ics and works of art found in their county. In this 
 way the interest becomes wide spread, almost univer- 
 sal, there being no one either young or old residing 
 within an intelligent and working community, who 
 will not become interested as acontributor or specta- 
 tor. In addition to a quite extensive scope of premi- 
 ums, relating to Agriculture and Horticulture, the 
 Blair County Society also awarded premiums for 
 harness, teams, dentistry, daguerreotypes, mechanic 
 arts, boots and shoes, furniture, marble ornaments, 
 tailoring, blankets, carpeting, brick, minerals, lumber, 
 printing, needle work, and general fancy work. 

Among the display of agricultural implements, we 
 observe several new machines, such as mowers, reap- 
 ers, fodder cutters, crushers, field rollers and crushers, 
 grain planters, (Ilauks patent) grass sowers, patent 
 churn, and implements for cutting off corn, and the 
 Michigan plough; some of these are new to us, and we 
 should like to hear more about them. A ploughing 
 match was also held, at which some good work was 
 perlormed. The premium for the best acre of corn 
 was awarded to Joseph Shannon, 179J bushels of ears 
 to tlie acre. 

The exhibition in thiscounty, appears to have been 
 highly spirited and successful. 

It is very rare to find ground which produces no- 
 thing; if it is not covered with flowers, with fruit 
 trees and grains, it produces briers and pines. It is 
 the same with man; if he is not virtuous, he becomes 
 vicious, — La Bntyerc, 

Temperance, — A manufactory of imitation cham- 
 pagne wine, made from the rhubarb pbtnt, has just 
 been established near Epernaw, in France. It is 
 stated that it will manufacture f lur to five thousand 
 bottles a week, at 4J cents a buttle. The drinkers of 
 Chanipagna need not, therefore, be alarmed at the 
 prevalence of the grape disease in Europe,

 I omitted to state tliat prior to preparing the car- 
 case for bacon, the whole nf the omentum or lard 
 ought to hi taken out; this is, however, so ol)vious, 
 that the omission is not very material. It is by no 
 means an uncommon practice with bacon curers to 
 render down the caul with the lard : if the caul is 
 taken out carefully and well washed, tliis may ba 
 done without detriment to the lard. Lard is ren- 
 dered down by being first cut up into pieces, and 
 placed in :: boiler along with a little water, which as 
 it melts is strained off and poured into bladders. 
 Great attention is requisite in rendering lard in or- 
 der to maintain the proper degree of heat, yet at the 
 same time to prevent burning; bladdcring lard also 
 requires some dexterity. When all tlie lard is 
 strained off, the remainder is subjected to pressure 
 in a press appropriated to the purpose, by which 
 means very little fat is left, what is left in the press 
 is called greaves, and is sold in cakes to feed dogs, 
 in some instances to feed hogs, also to the Prussian 
 blue makers. Although the term offal has been sev- 
 eral times used, t'>e meat in several instances, 
 though so called, is in fact the finest part of the pig; 
 for instance, the griskin in Lvlmd is sold together 
 with the piece cut outtf the breast and the haunoh- 
 buno and meat appended thereto, are all called offal, 
 and sold at the rate of from 18s. to 223. per cwt.; 
 notwithstanding which term the griskin is undoubt- 
 edly the finest part of the pig. No animal yields so 
 little mere offal as the pig, every part being made 
 useful — feet, head, and shanks, are all admired 
 when pickled or made into brawn. The poor man 
 makes a comfortable meal of the pluck and part of 
 the caul; the large intestines and stomach are sold 
 under the name of chitterlings; the small intestines 
 envelope sausage-meat; sausage-meat itself is formed 
 from the scraps; black puddings are made from its 
 blood, the bristles are appropriated liy the brushma- 
 ker, every part is turned to account, so much so, 
 that ws cannot be surprised at the hog being so long 
 coritinued a favourite at the farm-house, particularly 
 when we take into consideration the valuable prop- 
 ert3' which his flesh possesses of being easily pre- 
 served for future occasions by means of salt. In 
 noticing the curing of bacon and pork, it is barely 
 requisite to notice the curing of pork for the navy, 
 the cutting up of which requires some practice, as 
 every piece ought to weigh as nearly as possible 
 alike, with an equal amount of bone. When cut up, 
 it is thrown into large tubs containing a preparation 
 of strong pickle, fijrmed of salt and saltpetre; when 
 cured it is put in barrels, the bottom of the cask be- 
 ing covered with a layer of bay salt, then a layer of 
 pork, another layer of s.alt, and so on alternately un- 
 til the cask is nearly filled; then a layer of salt is 
 laid on the top, and the cask headed up. The fresh 
 pickle out of which pork has been taken is then sat- 
 urated with salt and poured through a Imlc left in 
 the head of the ea-ik fur the purpose; when the cask 
 is full, the hole is plugged up and the cask sent to 
 market. Porkers cured fir the home-market, and 
 usually known in the metropolis as barrelleil "lier- 
 wick Pork," is cured by being cut up into pieces and 
 salted iu tubs, having no o'her brine than that form- 
 ed by itself in pickling. It is, when cured, taken 
 out, packed in barrels along with fr^sh stnmg picklo 
 and sent to market. A largo quantity of the "IJer- 
 wick Pork" sold iu Lundon comes friun the west of 
 Ireland. For home u.sc pickled pork may be made, 
 using a little sugar in addition to the salt, by which
