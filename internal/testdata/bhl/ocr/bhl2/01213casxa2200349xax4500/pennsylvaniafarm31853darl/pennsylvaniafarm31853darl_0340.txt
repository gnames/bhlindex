means less of tlic latter need be used. 15y tliis mode 
 the pork is not quite ko salt; as, however, pickled 
 pork is always preferred when made from )iigs of 
 moderate size, it is better to make the same as want- 
 ed, and not to keep it more than a month or six 
 weeks, for prepare it in whatever way that can be 
 devised, the flesh of young pigs will contract very 
 much in the pot if long cured, and in oookino; care 
 should be taken not to overboil it, otherwise it vrii! 
 contract. All sorts of I'eceipts have been given for 
 curing h.am and bacon, some representinf; the mole 
 of one country, some of another, overlookinu; the 
 fact that almost every country or county adopts va- 
 ried moans, and do not confine themselves to any 
 particular rule. If half a dozen farm-houses iti 
 Westmoreland and Cumberland, who practice curinf; 
 bacon on an extensive scale, be asked for their re- 
 cipes, three or four different ones will be given; in 
 fact the mode of curing is most empirical, every cu- 
 rer adopting a formula of his own. If any book 
 treating on swine and curing bacon is taken up, it 
 will be invariably found that sugar or molasses enter 
 into the reputed recipes of most of the celebrated 
 districts. Now the writer knows from actual expe- 
 rience, and from having been witness to the curing 
 of Viacon and hams in the West of England, Cum- 
 berland, Westmoreland, and Ireland, in the latter 
 country where both York hams and West of England 
 bacon is made up for the English market, and sold as 
 Buch in England (one curer of York hams in Ireland 
 sending almost the whole of his make to Hull and 
 York! !!) that no sugar or molasses enters into the 
 process of curing where the business is carried on 
 to any extent. In Cumberland and AVestmorelan I 
 it is customary, when the hams are sufficiently cured, 
 to mis up a species of pomatum formed of lard or 
 fat, black pepper, and sugar, and rub this over the 
 bottom of the ham, but more particularly around 
 and over the end of the bone, filling the crevices 
 well up with this substance: (he principal effect of 
 which is that it exclndes the air, and con.sequently 
 diminishes the chance of decay from ordinary cau- 
 ses, and the pepper decidedly prevents (he fly con- 
 verting it into a nest. With careful persons th^ ribs, 
 bony parts, and ioints in bacon are treated in a simi- 
 lar manner; the sugar and pepper have also the ef- 
 fect of giving the ham and lean part? of the bacon 
 so treated an additional fine flavonr. The only 
 places where I have known sugar much nsed in en- 
 ring bacon is in some parts of Essex, where I have 
 tasted it quite sweet with sugar. The fine flavonr of 
 the Westmoreland and Cumberland hams is princi- 
 pally due to the fact of their being fed on oatmeal 
 and buttermilk, and not to the mode of curing. An- 
 other important fact is that whilst firm, well fed 
 bogs absorb less salt than ill fed animals : in fact, 
 though as much salt is used with the former as with 
 the latter, the former when perfectly cured will be 
 by no means so salt as the latter, although like 
 means are used in each case, and continued in pickle 
 or salt a like length of time, and the reason is obvi- 
 ous from natural causes. There is not much fear of 
 well fed, firm hogs becoming over salt in curing, un- 
 less great excess of salt and saltpetre are used for 
 the purpose, or kept preposterously Irng in salt. In 
 whatever torra the flesh of hogs is intended to be 
 disposed of, it is requisite that food shonld be with- 
 held from them for at least sixteen or twenty-four 
 hours pi'ior to their being slaughtered; and if they 
 have p eviously been driven, they ought to have a 
 rest of three or four days bcfi)re being killed, for if 
 killed when in a nervously excited state, or incipient 

fever, arising from over driving or hot weather, (ha 
 meat will only with difEcuUy "to/tc /Ac Â«urt. " The 
 state of the weather is a matter ol gieat importance 
 in curing bacon, warm and very moist weather being 
 extremely prejudicial. Hot Weather is not so injuri- 
 ous as i.s gcneiilly imagined, provided the ainios- 
 plicre is dry. As however the atmosphere is gener- 
 ally charged with moisture in proportion to its high 
 temperature, the hurtful effect which frtquenlly (ol- 
 low.s curing during the summer season is ^"ttributed 
 to beat instead of the true ciiuse, viz: excess of 
 moisture in the atmosphere, the banelul etTfot of 
 which is heiglitened by its higher temperature, (o 
 wliijh may be added the feverish conditimi of tha 
 aiiiitial at such seas ns; if within the carer's power, 
 his operations ought to be regulated rather liy tha 
 liygro.Ti ^ler than by the theruionioter. This is, how- 
 ever, difEouU to be ticeomplished, as hogs should 
 fa-'t six een hours before being slaughtere<l, after 
 which they require to be hung up to cool sixteen or 
 twenty more: at least tbirty-six hocira must ehipso 
 before the .sides arc fjt for the curer: in our variablo 
 climate many changes may occur within that [leriod. 
 Severe frosty weatlier is not otherwise unfavourable 
 to curing bacon than that which arises from the cir- 
 cumstance that it will not "take the salt" at all, but 
 remains quite fr;sh, until a thaw cornea on, when it 
 takes the salt rapidly. 

The term intiaeptic is applied to those aulistances 
 which prevent or retird the progress or tendency to 
 decay, which is the natural cimdition of vegetable 
 and animal matters when deprived of life. Anti- 
 septics consist of creosote, the essential oils, salts, 
 Ac. The theory of their action has never been pro- 
 perly explained; some substances for this purpose 
 are much more puwcrfid than others, such as creo- 
 sote and the essentia! oils; others, as tannin and cor- 
 rosive sublimate, owe their antiseptic properties to 
 the fact of their foiining ins(duble compounds with 
 animal tissue. &c. This does not explain the rafion- 
 ale of the action of saltpetre and salt in preservinj^ 
 provisions. Although we are nnacquanied with (ho 
 actual cause of the preservative powers of salt and 
 saltpetre, yet there are some circumstances connect- 
 ed with their action that explain in part their anfi- 
 sep ic powers. It is well kimwn that the presence of 
 moisture and (he atnxispliere are requisite to induce 
 decay; tliat be;it hastens and cold retards its pro- 
 gress. Now all the animal tissues, whether muscu- 
 lar or celbilar, contain a certain amount of water, 
 wliilst thr fluids which are not withdrawn from the 
 animal in bleeding contain a large amount of water; 
 these fluids contain several substances of a most 
 complex nature, high atomic weight nnd facile de- 
 composition, to which the excess (jf moisture greatly 
 assists. In proportion to its entire weight none of 
 our domestic animals contain so small a proportion- 
 ate amount of nniseJo and tissoe as (he hog. the ma- 
 jor part consisting of fat, which, from its more sim- 
 ple chemical composition, is less liable to decay, or 
 becoming, a.^ it la commonly termed, "reasty" or 
 "rusty," which rtistiness wiH generally l>e found on 
 exandnation (o have commenced in the decay ot the 
 enveloping or eellnlar tissue. Common salt absorba 
 moisture where an excess is present, and yields the 
 m iatstre .so al>sorbcd on exposure to a moderately 
 dry ntinosphere. These prop^irtiea, in corfnexioij 
 with the fact tirat salt is an agreeable condiment, 
 render this substance, irrespective of its cheapness 
 and general distribution, the most fitting antiseptic 
 that can bo applied. I am inclined to consider the 
 ultimate action of salt in a great measure Sjs me-
