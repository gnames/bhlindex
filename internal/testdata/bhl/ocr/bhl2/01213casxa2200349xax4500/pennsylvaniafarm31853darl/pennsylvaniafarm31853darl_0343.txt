collections, or bundles of blood-vessels, •which be- 
 long; to the foetal portion of the placenta, and which 
 are implanted into the fleshy excrescences, th it, for 
 some reason never yet fully explained, grow upon the 
 surface of the imprej^nated womb, and gradually 
 disappear after the birth of the calf. If mucii 
 bleed. ng attend this process, the parts are to Vje 
 washed with a weak mixturoc of spirit and wUer. 
 The bleeding being a little stayed, and every thing 
 that may have gatliered round the calf-bag being re- 
 moved, the .as-istants should raise the cloth, and 
 bring the womb on a level with the bearing: while 
 the surgeon, standing behind, and having his hand 
 nnd arm well oiled, and a little oil having been like- 
 "B'ise smeared over the womb generally, places his 
 riglit hand, with the fingers bent or clenched, 
 against the bottom — the very inferior and farther 
 part of that division or horn of the uterus which 
 contained the foetus, and forces it through the pass- 
 age, and as far as he can into the belly; and there he 
 retains it, while, with the other hand, he endeavors 
 likewise to force up the smaller liorn, and the mouth 
 of the womb. He will find considerable difficulty in 
 eflfecting this, for the strainings against him will 
 often be immense, and sometimes, when he thinks 
 he has attained his object, the whole will again be 
 suddenly and violently expelled. A bleeding from 
 the jugular, and t.ie administration of a couple of 
 drachms of opium, will materially lessen these spas- 
 modic efforts. The surgeon must, in spite of fatigue, 
 ' patiently persist in his labor until his object is ac- 
 complished; and he will be materially assisted in 
 this by liaving the cow either standing, or so placed 
 on straw that her hinder parts should be considera- 
 bly elevated. 

The practitioner s.iould be careful that the parts 
 are returned as nearly as possible into their natural 
 situation, and this he will e.asily ascertain by exami- 
 natiim with the hand. Much of the after quietness 
 of the animal, and the retention of the womb thus 
 returned, will depend upon this. 

Although the return of the parts to thtir natural 
 8ituati<in may be tolerably clearly ascertained, yet it 
 will bo prudent '.0 provide against a fresh access of 
 p.ain and another expuls'on of the uterus. For this 
 purpose it had been usual to pass three or four 
 stitches of small tape through the lips of the bear- 
 ing; but this is a painful thing, and sometimes diffi- 
 cult to acc<implish; and the cases are not unfrequent 
 when these stitches are torn out, and considerable 
 laceration and inflammation en^iue. 

A collar should be passe<l round the neck of the 
 cow, composed of web: a girth of the same material 
 is then put round the body Liehindltlie shoulders, and 
 this is connected with the collar, under the brisket 
 and over the shouhler, and im cac'i side. A second 
 girth is passed behind the first, ancl a little anterior 
 to tlie udder, and connected with the first in the same 
 waj-. To this, on one side, and level with the bear- 
 ing, a piece of stout wrapping cloth or other strong 
 material, twelve or sixteen inches wide, is sewed or 
 fastened, and brought over the bearing, and attached 
 to the girth on the other side in the same manner. 
 A knot on each side will constitute the simplest 
 fastening, and this pressing firndy on the bearing 
 will etfectually prevent the womb from again protru- 
 ding. If it should be neci'ssary, another piece may 
 be carried from below the bearing over the udder to 
 the second girth, and a corres|ioiiiling one, slit in 
 order to pass on each side of the tail, may reach 
 from above the bearing to the upper jiart of the sec- 
 ond bandage. 

The cow should be kept as quiet as possible; warm 
 mashes ami Wi,rm gruel should be allowed; bleeding 
 should again be resorted to, and small doses of opium 
 administered if she should be restless, or the j>ain» 
 should return; but it will not be prudent during the 
 first day to give either those fever medicines, as nitre 
 and digitalis, which may have a diuretic effect and 
 excite the urinary organs, or to bring on the strain- 
 ing effect of purging, by administering even a dose 
 of saline medicine. Should twenty-four hours pass 
 and the pains not return, tl e stitches may bo with- 
 drawn from the bearing, or the bandage removed. —

Souring food fur Cattle and Hogs. 

The cause is rather remote upon which this prin- 
 ciple is based. It is asserted upon good authority 
 that Rye, Bai-ley, or Indian Corn meal, made into a 
 mash and allowed to ferment and pass into the same 
 state, when mixed with cut hay, straw or other dry 
 vegetable food, exhibits the most marked fattening ef- 
 fects. A very consistent and observing friend of 
 ours remarked the other day, that he could with bai^ 
 ley meal alone, properly fermented and soured, makn 
 hogs as fat in six weeks, as they could, or ought to 
 be, and that he preferred such process to cooking 
 the food, or any other method. 

It is a familiar fact to all feeders of swine, that 
 sour and coagulated milk is worth one quarter more 
 for those animals, than fresh and sweet milk; but 
 how its action in that state is to be accounted for, 
 and its operaticm on the animal economy of the stom- 
 ach, is not very apparent. It is known by the ex- 
 periments of Dr. Re.^umoxt, that milk and all sub- 
 stances capable of coagulation are almost instantly 
 changed on mixing with the gastric juice, and the 
 rejection of milk by the infant, immediately after 
 sucking, also shows the fact. 

Now, whether the souring of the food relieves the 
 action of the digestive process, or whether the acetic, 
 malic, or other acids are required by the stomach 
 to effect secretion or stimulation, is simple conjecture. 
 With the human subject, pickles are a favorite con- 
 diment with ricli and highly concentrated food, and 
 many delicate stomachs can endure the use of large 
 quantities of these most indigestible and unnutritivo 
 substances, without experiencing any deleterious ef- 
 fects. It is gene alh' held, that those persons who 
 consume r"uch acid food ami use vinegar and pickles 
 freely, are apt to be thin and spare; contrary to tjie 
 doctrine of souring food. We once knew a young lady 
 so flesh}' and full of "blood and blue veins," that her 
 skin Has almost to the tension of bursting, who redu- 
 ced herself to very respectable wasp-like di nensions, 
 merely by the free use of vinegar. 

Of the good effects cjf the souring process, when 
 use<l for fattening aoim.ils, wo have tiie most abun- 
 dant proofs in our own experience, and although the 
 modus »;«/■««(/« is not so clear to our perceptions, it 
 is, we opine, suificient for us to know that sueli is 
 the f'ct, at least Irom its assertion by good authority, 
 to induce our readers to try its effects and its econo-
