DWARF PEARS— TO RAISE HYACINTHS IN GLASSES.

sentation of which we have annexed, with its straw 
 separator and winnower attached. This machine 
 has all the advantages of the common flail in thresh- 
 ing, and not as liable to injure the grain or seed as 
 the common spike thresher. It is a labor saving 
 machine, simple in its construction, not liable to get 
 out of repair, and is so made that none of its parts 
 can be dislodged by the great speed given to the ro- 
 taries, and thus the liability to accident, which in 
 other threshers so often results in loss of limb, if not 
 of life, is avoided and prevented. 

The great and distinguishing feature of this thresh- 
 er, however, is, that it can be so fixed or adjusted 
 that it will thresh, wilh equal perfectii n, all the dif- 
 ferent kinds of seed and grain, as grass, flax, and 
 clover seed, oats, barley, wheat, rye, peas, and rice 
 — Indian corn alone excepted — and thus enable the 
 farmer to thresh all his crop of crenj character, and 
 with the same machine. This end is attained by 
 means of the castings on the inner side of the trough 
 or flail-case, called rubbers, which have mill-like 
 furrtwed surfaces, and which are capable of being 
 placed nearer to or farther from the track of the ro- 
 taries. The machines are manufactured by Messrs. 
 Coggeshall & Co., 643 Water street. New York, to 
 whom we refer for further particulars.

 d, one of the rotating flails; 12, pace where the grain 
 is fed; e, contrivance for regulating the adjustments 
 of the rubbers on the inside of the flail case; k is the 
 slide to change the delivery of the straw or grain; o,

 the winnower, a vertical view; 8, 8, bands, transfer- 
 ring motion to the winnower from the thregher; Z,

 straw a le discharged directly over the place where 
 they are fed into the machine. The rotaries revolve 
 in the direction indicated by the arrows. The fig-

 Dwarf Pears. 
 There is probably no branch of Horticulture more 
 justly claiming the attention of Farni''rs and market 
 men generally, than the cultivation of Pears on Quince 
 Stocks; the maxim that trees will not succeed well 
 for any length (if time where they are grafted on any 
 other than their own species, does not npply-here, as 
 many varieties of the Pear grow vigorously, and bear 
 abundantly of delicious fruit and more exquisite flavor 
 than on theirown roots. The impression that Iiad pre- 
 vailed to some extent, unfavorably to the cultivation 
 of the Pear on the Quince has rapidly disappeared 
 before (ho solid arguments contained in the large 
 dishes filled with luscious fruit, thus grown on trees 
 . bat recontlj' transplanted and exliiljiicd at our late 
 Agricultural Fairs — one cf our enterprising farmers 
 John Chambers of Burlington co., being sensible of 

the scarcity of Pearsand the facility with which they 
 can be produced on dwarfs sot out an orchard of one 
 thousand trees about two years since, and at our late 
 fair at Mount Holly Exhibited of his crop, thirty-nine 
 varieties of Pears of great beauty, reflecting much 
 credit on his energy and good treatment, and 
 for which he obtained the highest premiums, and af- 
 ter the show was over to convince the spectators that 
 they possessed real worth, as well as beauty he offer- 
 ed them at public sale the finest being Duchess d' 
 Angouleme went off readily at four dollars per dozen, 
 the next in value St. Michael Archange, Louis Bonne 
 d' Jersey and other choice varieties descending in 
 price by regular gradations until those of least val- 
 ue were closed out at fifty cents per dozen. 

The inoculation should be near the ground, so that 
 when transplanted union m ly b? the plvoj 1 belowthe 
 surface. It may not yet be ascertained how long they 
 will last, but we have records of them over one hun- 
 dred years old and still healthy, my own trees that 
 have been standing in the orchard about five years 
 have born half a bushel each at a time, in New Eng- 
 land it is stated that pear trees on the Quince root 
 which are twenty-five years old produce annually a 
 barrel or more of fruit each, and appear destined to 
 survive as long as any on the pear root. As they 
 admit of close planting and mature their fruit within 
 one or two years from the time they are transplant 
 ed in the orchard, large profits may bo taken from an 
 acre of ground before any return could be oI)tained 
 from them on pear stocks. In planting an orchard for 
 myself I have set the trees 8 by 12 feet apart which 
 gives plenty of room for driving a wagon between 
 the rows to apply manure, and will require 453 trees 
 per acre: 

Since the poach crop has become so uncertain in 
 this vicinity and the dearth of choice fruits in our 
 markets, I know of no other fruit so easily raised in 
 the open field, giving as fine a prospect of a rich re- 
 ward to farmers and market men as Dwarf Pears.

The following from Ilovey's Magazine, contains 
 all necessary directions to succeed with these beau- 
 tiful appendages of the parlor or drawing room in 
 winter. When grown in pots there is less difficulty, 
 in obtaining a fine bloom than in the glasses; un- 
 less shaded for a few days, in the latter as described 
 below, the tops will push out, and begin to flower 
 before the roots have grown sufficiently to support it 
 and the bloom will l.e consequently short lived and im- 
 perfect. If the glasses are clear, they should be sha- 
 ded by covering with dark paper. AVe have gener- 
 ally changed the water once in a week or ten days:
