SEEDLING FRUITS.

Bideratiun as possessing the supposefl oscellencios of 
 n native sort. Do such frivolous distinctions make 
 any difference? Does anybody suppose tliat scions 
 of the Pclrc pear sent to Enghind would produce a 
 fruit varying from what would have grown had the 
 eeed been originally planted there? — provided, of 
 course, that the conditions of devoloDment in each 
 case are equally favorable to the /leallh, simply, of the 
 tree. Or, if the seed which produced the Dix pear 
 had been sown in Belgium, and not in Boston, and 
 trees or scions thence brought to Boston, would the 
 tree have proved less adapted to cultivation in Mass- 
 achusetts, or the fruit worse ? 

If the current opinion be correct, we ought always 
 to find fruits better where they originate than else- 
 where. Is it so? Can no one recollect instances of 
 fruit, which originated in ti.e Eastern States, being 
 returned from the west so changed for the better as 
 to escape recognition by the most critical judges un- 
 til scions again set here, and afforded their former 
 facilities for development, produced a well known 
 nnd easily recognized acquaintance of former years? 
 The Rosttezer is understood to be a seedling of Ger- 
 many, where it yielded a second or third rate fruit; 
 but trees or scions brought here, produce a fruit so 
 much superior, as to be almost, if not quite, a stan- 
 dard of excellence in its season, and the tree proves 
 us hardy as any native of Maine — and surely we 
 ought to know something about hardiness where the 
 mercury sometimes (rarely, to be sure, ) freezes in 
 the thermometer. 

Suppose you plant a pear seed at Rochester, and it 
 yields a desirable fruit, and you send me scions, 
 which upiin trial here prove unable to withstand the 
 severity of winter, what does it prove? If it proves 
 anything, only this — that if the free had been grown 
 here, it would not h.avc survived to be.ar fruit, for 
 seedlings are more tender \n infancy than at adult 
 uge. You send scions to other distant places, and in 
 one it is found of better flavor and in another worse; 
 in one more productive, and in another less. And 
 this only shov>'s ihat had the tree grown in either of 
 these localities it would have been deemed more or 
 Jess valuable. 

Experience teaches that some fruits are adapted to 

a wide range of sril and climate, and others restrict^ 
 ed to narrow limits. What could there have possibly 
 been in the accidents connected with the growth of 
 the seedling Keatown Pippin, which deprived it of 
 the capability of developing its excellence away from 
 the neigliborhood of the Hudson 7 or what endowed 
 the seedling Green Gage with the power to exhibit 
 its worth through scores of degrees of longitude, and 
 nobody knows how many of latitude. Nothing at 
 all. The endowment lies further back — viz., in the 
 seed. The proposition here combatted seems to me 
 to have been a.fs-nmed from the first, rather than 
 proved, and so plausible as to have escaped exami- 
 nation, thus leading many astray. 

AV.as not even Downing somewhat wide of the 
 mark when he penned the hdlowing sentence— "That 
 in proportion as a variety has been brought original- 
 ly from a locality in Europe most nearly simihir to 
 that where we would grow it, are its vigor and pro- 
 ductiveness retained in our soil." Now, take the 
 Ftcmish Beauty, which is named .as perhaps the best 
 proved of any foreign variety in this locality, as per- 
 fectly hardy, (more so than the Fulton, which is 
 credited to Maine, though th:> seed grew in Massa- 
 chusetts, or than the McLatigldin, of which, by the 
 way, nobody can tell the origin, the oldest known 
 trees here being grafted,) perfectly healthy, abun- 

dantly productive, vigorous in growth, and the fruit 
 fairer than as grown in Massachusetts and New 
 York, and tell mo what are the particu'ur items of 
 similarity between Belgium and Maine which caus- 
 ed this fruit to retain its vigor and productiveness 
 here? 

Let me not he understood, by any means, as under- 
 valuing native fruits. Nobody thinks more highly 
 of them, or would more strongly nrge their produc- 
 tion by every cultivator; only I do not believe in such 
 a rapid manufacture of a native that one generation, 
 or two, or five will develope the highest degree of ex- 
 cellence. There is doubtless a nucleus of truth, to 
 which this, that I maintain to be error, has attached 
 itself. Rare is it f)r any error to oljtain extensively 
 which has not truth enough to hold on by. 

The same paper, by Downing, from which the 
 above quotation ia taken, has the following, which 
 may indicate what it is : "There appear.? to be some- 
 thing in our new soil, and distinct climate, which 
 imparts new vital powers and gives a new type to 
 the offspring of an old stock in the vegetable races of 
 the other continent." Perhaps a different formula 
 may approx' ate towards an indication of it, to wit : 
 That there is in the productions of nature a tendency 
 implanted by the beneficent Creator to change it into 
 atyp^ specially adapted to the peculiarities of each 
 locality, .and this by successive generations from the 
 seed. We .see such a tendency with unusual clear- , 
 ness in the case of maize or Indian corn. Plant seed, 
 adapted to one locality, in another at a distance, and 
 year by year we gradually find it varying, until at 
 j length it reaches the type best adapted to its nevr 
 situation. Something analogous to this may prevail 
 among fruits; but whether just so or not, go on to 
 plant seeds and continue to plant, and when you ob- 
 tain a desirable acquisition, (your judgment being, 
 I perhaps, unconsciously warped bj' parental fondness.) 
 ' don't spend ihe remainder of your energy in extolling 
 its wonderful merits as a native, but rejoicing in the 
 ' accomplishment of one step, go on in the right direc- 
 i tion to cross breed it with others of known mei it, and 
 so effect another advance in what may prove a long 
 race before the highest attainable point of excellence 

is reached. — UorticnJtvrisl.

Miscellaneous Items. — Twelve thousand bushels 
 of cranberries were brought to Boston on Saturday, 
 nearly all of which met with an immediate sale to 
 provsiim dealers. They brought $1,75 per bushel. 
 The public will pndjably be able to get tliera for 
 about $3 per bushel. Large tracts of waste, marshy 
 land on Cape Cod have, within the last two years, 
 been planted with cranberry vinos, and have cleared 
 their owners a handsome sum. 

Judge Vondersmith, of Lancaster, has succeeded 
 in bringing to maturity a "Victoria Regia" plant — the 
 Queen of the floral world — which bloomed during 
 Saturday and Sunday, the 22d and 2od ult. The 
 flower is said to have been beautiful and gorgeous 
 beyond description. It measured eleven inches in 
 diameter, and the leaves of the plant six feet.

Words ought to carry their sense and signification, 
 and they ought never to be obscure. Word is a 
 habit which we give imagination, in order to clothe 
 thought, and make it better known by the color by 
 which it is painted; but it is a cloak which ought 
 not to conceal it; it is a head-dress, not a nmask; it 
 ought to set it off, and serve as an ador ment, and 
 not hide it from the eyes and envelopitin a disguise.
