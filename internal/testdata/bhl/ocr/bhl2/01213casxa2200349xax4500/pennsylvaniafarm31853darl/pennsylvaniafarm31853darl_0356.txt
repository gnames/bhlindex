blodd; he bi-'lieved tlit-re wore mi better horses in the 
 wcirhl, and mine faster. He would not liiive llieiii 
 uiulerval'jo thin breed; it was sueli blood as they had 
 n:)t ;^ot in Kn};land. 

He (Mr. II.) was a j^rower of wheat. lie plough- 
 ed the ground with hi.s horses; he sowed his wheat 
 fields witli his liorses; he drilled in his wheat with 
 his horses; he re:ipod and thraslied out his wheat 
 with his hor.scs. Tliey were not only an artiele of 
 necessity to the farmer, but they were every where 
 nil article of luxury. What they wanted, in the 
 rural districts, was to in)|iroTe tlic breed of their 
 horses, that their sons and their ihii-ghters mi^';ht 
 ride at pleasure, as well as to make the animal more 
 serviceable in the field. In conclusion, Mr. Iloleomb 
 aaid — I shall go away from this Convention very 
 grateful for the exhibition. To a similar exhibition 
 1 shall certaiidy return; and to that, or to some oth- 
 er occasion, we must postpoi.o the erection of an 
 equestrian st tue to Georoe M. Atvv.\ter, (Loud ap- 
 plause) and to a much later period — to a d.iy, 1 
 trust, that the youni^est in this assembly will scarce- 
 ly see, — the erection of a monument to the memory of 
 the man whowas thefriend of horticulture.terracultore 
 and agriculture — the friend of rural life, in all its rela- 
 tions, Col. Maesu.4I,l p. Wij.dek. [Great cheering.] 
 I will conclude .>ith the expressi<in ot a wish — a 
 good wish. It is prompted liy a recent visit to the 
 grave of Robert Burns. I went down to Ayrshire, 
 where the noble poet labored, like myself, in the har- 
 vest field and at the con'mon drudgery of life, boast- 
 ing that no man could beat him at the plough, and 
 so he put absolute want at defiance. He apostrophi- 
 ses the farnuT in this way— let mo quote tho words 
 of the poet, to whom I am brother : — • 

"Ot Seotk»! my tk-ar. my naOvL'Soil.

Hon. Abbott L.vwben'be,— I tliank you for accor- 
 ding to me the privilege of proposing ix sentiment 
 liei-e, which I am sure the whole audience will thank 
 me for claiming, and to which they will respond 
 without stint. Believing, as 1 do, that one individual 
 has been a great public bcuefiictor, and that his nanii' 
 should be recorded and ti-ansmitted to posterity, I 
 have asked the privilege of giving a toast, and that 
 toast is to the individual who has originated and pro- 
 mulgated the iilca of this great National Horse Con- 
 vention. Without occupying your time in making 
 any extended remarks, I beg to offer to you — • 

Health, happiness and prosperity to Gect.oB RI. 
 ATWATtn. [Loud applause, followed by three hearty 
 cheers.] 

Mr. Atwater the mounted the stand amid enthusi- 
 astic plaudits, and said, — 

Mr. President, — Cordial and enthusiastie have 
 been the greetings of the tens of thousands ot voices 
 which have been heard on these grounds, since the 
 first opening hours of thisexhibitii.n; and I trust and 
 believe that the hearty response with Tfhich our ef- 
 forts have been hailed, is but the expi-ession of a sen- 
 timent which will live beyond the greetings of t; - 
 day, and find utterance on other plains and in exhi- 
 bition" of lasting interest and utility. Allow mo to 
 say a word, sir, with reference to the desirableness 
 and expediency of following up the precedent which 
 has be(>n established for the annual and sole cxhibi- 
 <ti in of horses. 

I feel, indeed, that argument on this point is now 
 no longer necessary. The universal support and cn- 

coui-a^ement which have been extended to this en- 
 terprise, together with the unanimous appi'oval of 
 the press, are a guaranty that, henceforth, to iha 
 I Horse will be aecordi-d a position in some good de- 
 I gree proportioned to his excellencies and value. It 
 ; is no apology tor those to whom properly belongs the 
 j duty of breeding and rearing this animal for doines- 
 ; tic uses, I hat the disposition of training him for tho 
 C'lurse, which has so long pi'evailed in England and 
 in certain sections of our own country, has already 
 resulted in developing many of his extraordinaiy 
 powers. There are ipialities constituently belonging 
 to him (I am satisfied from my own experience in his 
 use) wlii<;h remain to be developed. 

iou are aware, Mr. President, of the interest with 
 which the horse was regarded by the people of 
 Greece and Home in the periods of their highest re- 
 finement and civilization: however modern and val' 
 ueless the' race of "'fast men," we have abundant ev- 
 idences that last horses were the glory of the ancients, 
 in leferring to the I'ecords of their history, we also 
 notice that there were three essentials which consti- 
 tuted eligibility to the honors of State: that the per- 
 son should foi-siike his benedictine life, that hosh^mld 
 build for himself a house, and that he should 
 sustain the relation of parent; I think, sir, that t. ey 
 might, \<ith equal propriety, have insisted, also, that 
 the applicant for dit.tinctlon should re.ar for hirwself 
 and his successors at least one thorough bred 
 horse. 

The love of the "Arabs" for their horses, an<?their 
 humanity to them, are well known. So highly have 
 hey esteemed them that their gene.ilogy is traceable 
 iiack for two thousand yeiirs. Those of their purest 
 stock are reverentially denominated "nobles." One 
 of this class, so renowned for strength and betjuty, 
 was imported into England liy the talented divine. 
 Bishop Heber, and .so cordial was he in his esteem of 
 the animal tha: the "Arab" became bis fafsiliar 
 pet. 

With us, the subject <if raising thorough-bretls has 
 been so lightly esteemed, that I hesitate to refer to 
 the number of this class of horses, which the cata- 
 logue of our exhibition presents. As an instance of 
 the value of ■■thorougli-brcds," I will al ude to tho 
 profits resulting from the ownership of that famous 
 iiorse "Eclipse." His name, sir, which you know 
 was given him "because he distanced all competitors, 
 or, in other words, they had no place. Of his 
 speed, no corre t estimate can be formed, as he never 
 met with an opponent sufficiently fleet to put it to 
 tho test." "Eclipse" produced three handled and 
 and thirty winners, netting to his owners the sum of 
 over one million of dollars. I have the opinion of 
 the Hon. Mr. ILdoomb, a distinguished member, Mr. 
 President, of your "honorable body" — that the im- 
 petus which itiis exhibition will undoubtedly give to 
 thebreeding of superior stocks of hor-ies may resu't, 
 in the limited period of 5 to 10 years, in an increased 
 profit to the farmer, of an amount equal to the pres- 
 ent entire revenue of our government. 

The horse, sir, is a type of the qualities which de» 
 honor to our efforts to exalt the standard of his ex- 
 cellence, not alone in beauty, but tor adaptation to 
 the iiiiperalive wants of man. The requisitions 
 which we make upim him cannot he answered by any 
 other .^nimal in the wide creation. 

Mr. President, I will not quote the distinguished 
 and aecomplisheil Lord Herbert of Engl.ind, as an 
 impartial admirer of this noble race, when he says 
 that "a good rider, on a good horse, is as niuchabove 
 himself, and others, as this world can make him,"
