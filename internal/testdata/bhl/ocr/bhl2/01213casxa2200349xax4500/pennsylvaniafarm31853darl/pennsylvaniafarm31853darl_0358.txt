GUANO IN HELAAVARE— POirLTRY. 

[Decembbr 

caution is especially necessary in pouring the acid 
 from tlic carboy, and in dropping the bones into the 
 barrel. It is Tiell to always keep at hand a pail of 
 ■water. ,nnd should any fly upon yoarperson. or clothes 
 im7)ied>a>eli/ removp it l)y a. free, use of water. Should 
 valuable garments be colored by the acid, the color 
 can generally be removed, l)y at once wa-shing the 
 spot with some saleratns dissolved in water. 

The above operation can be carried on in the open 
 .lir cpiite as well as under cover, and by standing on 
 the windward side of the tub any unplea.sant fumes 
 will be avoided. A board should bo placed over the 
 tub to keep out water during rain. 

After pouring out the liquid super-phostiate from 
 the barrel, you can add more water, acid, and Vwnes, 
 and let the process go on anew. The article is just as 
 good, or even better, after it has stood one or five 
 years. Should the hoops chance to burst off from 
 your cask or barrel at any time, ponr the liquid into 
 another vessel, or set it upon the top of another, and 
 let it through by punching out the bottom. 

Guano in Delaware.

There can be no no doubt that even at the present 
 extravigant prices of guano, the farmer who culti- 
 vates his own land, if that land is poor, ishandsome- 
 ly paid back his outlay for all his guano judiciously 
 applied, and has a margin left for profit, besides the 
 additional advantage of having his ground covered 
 with a thick crop of grass, which will furnish him 
 the basis of an improvement less evanescent than 
 that made by the tuano per se, whilst the landlord 
 who furnishes bis tenant with this manure is paying 
 at the rate of $1 per 100 pounds of guano, at least 
 for this mere advantage of having his land in a con- 
 dition for speedy improvement. The quickest mode 
 of renovatingour worn-out soil, we have found to be 
 the fidlowing: Take a field, and dress with 300 
 pounds guano, turned very deep; then sow 1.! bushel 
 of wheat per acre, about the 10th of September; the 
 wheat to be seeded with a drill. When the ground 
 is thawed, in the latter y^art of February, orearlv in 
 March, sow one sixth of a bushel of clover-seed per 
 acre: it is best to sow this on a light fall of snow, so 
 that the melting of the snow shall carry the seed 
 with it into the cracks of the earth made by the es- 
 cape of frost from the gro>md. If it should, by rea- 
 son of high winds, become dry before the clover has 
 had time to get up, it will be well to run a rake- 
 harrow over the field. • This will benefit both the 
 wheat and the clover. 3f the season is not excessive- 
 ly dry, the clover wi li be thic^kly act. My experi- 
 ence last year on tliis point was as follows; I so ed, 
 in the autumn of ISol, a fielil of '10 acres in wbeut, 
 one lialf ol which was drilled and the other broad- 
 cast. Five years before that, the field was in corn; 
 and. so completely had the soil been exhau ted; that 
 it only yielded 13-iJ bushels of corn, or about? bush- 
 ek per acre. I gave the land about -80 pounds of 
 guano per acre, when flushed for the wheat, and 
 turned it under, to tlie yellow dirt. The clover was 
 sown on all the field at the same time in March. The 
 half that was drilled yieldedVnough wheat more than 
 the other half to ri^pay the seed; and there is now 
 nil, re tb;in twice the quantity of clover on the drilled 
 half !ban there is on the other. It is to 1 e hoped 
 that the next territory we shall have annexed will 
 bo the Liuboa or- some otiher guano islands. They 

would be worth more to the farmers of this country, 
 who compose four-fifths of its population, than Cuba 
 and all the rest of the Antilles besides. Or if annex- 
 ation is not to be the future fashion, some honora- 
 ble means should be used by our government to effect 
 such a negotiation with Peru as will enable us to buy 
 our guano at a reasonable price. I have no donbt, 
 if it could be had by the consumer at $40 or even 
 %?>!) per 2,240 pounds, the government of Peru wotdd 
 lose nothing by the reduction, whilst it would greatly 
 benefit the agricultural portion of our eomiDunity. 

Premium Poultry. 

Exhibition Fowls. — Before entering into descrip- 
 tions of the various breeds now competing at the 
 different shows iu the United Kingdom, it may be 
 well to name a few imperative rules app'icable to 
 to them ivU. The competition is now so great that 
 something more than mere merit is required to gain 
 prizes, unless it be where they are valueless from the 
 absence of those names in the list which are a guar- 
 antee for the quality of the beaten birds. They must 
 be in eycellent condition, not merely fat, but in full 
 flesh, health, and spirits. It is necessary, in order 
 that they may show to the greatest advantage — noth- 
 thing is more important than this in fowls intended 
 for exhibition — they should take the eye at first sight, 
 and to do this, they must be in first-rate condition. 
 This will not be accomplished by extra feeding for a 
 fortnight, but by keeping them well from the time 
 they are hatched, and this is more economical than 
 ,he wretched and short sighted practice of alternate 
 starving and over-feeding, because in the former case 
 the fowls suffer no check, and grow and furnish ac- 
 cordingly. Fowls intended for competition in 
 December should be selected from March or April 
 chickens, .and the cocks and pullets kept separate til! 
 a short time before the show, when they should run 
 together, that they may agree when in confinement. 
 Inattention to this latter particular is the cause of the 
 scalped pullets so common in pens, and these not of 
 game fowls, but of all breeds, even the least pugna- 
 cious. They will not always agree unless they are 
 used to be together, and as the unfortunate pullet 
 cannot escape, she is often killed, and a pen spoiled. 
 Those who know the difficulty of getting three good 
 pullets of equal merit to form a pen, will readily ad- 
 mit that such a circumstance often spoils a season, 
 and is the cause of empty reus. Uniformity cornea 
 next in importance, and this also is an essential. I 
 would advise every exhibitor to pen his fowls at home 
 before he sends them away, aiid to judge them many 
 limes hiiiisclf. AVe are ;U1 a little disposed to ad- 
 mire our own property — but judges (and every 
 .exhibitor should l)e one) look first for beauties and 
 then for defects. Jlany of the latter are imperceptible 
 while fowls Ave running at liberty, but tbey are 
 prominent when they are in a small pen. They 
 should match in size, colour, age, and even carriage. 
 Competition is often very close, and if judges have to 
 give perhaps two prizes to a class numbering 150 
 entr es, it will easily be understood that any little 
 incongruity, unimportant at another time, is fatal to 
 a pen so far as honors are concerned. There are 
 breeds, of which we shall write hereafter, where 
 colour is not a first point, and yet if two competing 
 pens were equ;il in every other respect, if one were 
 more uniform than the other, that pen would carry 
 the prize. No one who has never judged, can un- 
 derstanil the importance of these apparent trifles, or 
 the relief it affords to judges to discover themj when.
