as is often the case, an hour has been spent over five 
 or six pens selected from 100. 

They should be in perfect plumage. To insure this 
 they should bo properly packed, and my experience 
 is in favour of a round basket — it has many advan- 
 tages — if offers no corner where fowls can huddle up 
 and trample each other, and as the fowls in moving 
 go round, the feithers, especially the tails of the 
 cocks, follow and are not broken. Thobasketshould 
 allow the fowls to stand upright, and should be cov- 
 ered with canvas. Plenty of clean Oat or Barlej' 
 straw should be put at the bottom, and the birds 
 should not be packed till it is absolutely necessary. 
 They should not for economy's sake in carriage be 
 packed too close, or too many in a basket. The best 
 test of the proper size is to choose one which will 
 allow all its occupants to sit down at the same time. 
 Whatever breed is exhibited, the owner should al- 
 ways send his best, for it is t'resorae to hear people 
 say when defeated, they could have sent better birds, 
 and it is always a sorry sight when fowls of un- 
 doubted merit lose even a commendatory notice for 
 want of condition, or from ragged plumage caused by 
 bad catching. As a rule, a person unaccustomed to 
 handle fowls should take them by the legs, raising 
 the bird from the ground the moment they hold it, 
 otherwise injury is done in struggling, and by beat 
 ing the wings and breast against the ground. John

The Patent Office. 

The Patent Office report, which is annually pub- 
 lished, is one of the most interesting public docu- 
 ments which the Government puts forth. It shows 
 the progress ot invention in this county, and the 
 remarkably practical character of mind which 
 distinguishes our countrymen. There is nothing 
 which promises a saving of manual labor, no matter 
 in what department of domestic industry, or which 
 may accomplish work in an improved manner, which 
 is too insignificant for the application of inventive 
 genius. Many of these inventions are, no doubt, 
 more curious than profitable ; but many of them 
 yield the inventor a fortune. Thus in the patent re- 
 port for 185;2, a man who had made a slight im- 
 provement in a straw-cutter, took a model of his 
 machine through tlie Western States, and after a 
 tour of eight months returned with $40,000. An- 
 other had a machine to thresh and clean grain, which, 
 in fifteen months, he sold for §00,000. A third ob- 
 tained a patent for a printer's ink, refused $!50,000 
 for it, and finally sold it for §00,000. Examiner ' 
 Lane's report describes various new electrical in- 
 ventions : 

Among these is an electric whaling apparatus, by 
 which the whale is literally " s'jocked to death." 
 Another is an electro-magnetic alarm, which rings 
 bells and displays signals in case of tire or burglars. 
 Another is an electric clock, which wakes you up, 
 tells you what time it is, and liglitsa lamp for you at 
 any hour you please. 

There is a " sound gatherer," a sort of huge ear 
 trumpet, to be placed in front of a locomotive, bring- 
 ing to the engineer's ear all the noises ahead, perfectr 
 ly distinct, notwithstanding the rattle of the train. 
 There is an invention that picks up pins from a con- 
 fused heap, turns them all around with their heads 
 up, and sticks them in papers, in regular rows. An- 
 nother goes through the whole process of cigar 
 making, taking in tobacco leaves and turning out the 
 perfect article. One machine cuts cheese ; another 
 scours knives and forks ; another blacks boots : an- 
 other rocks the cradle; and scvon or eight take in 

washing and ironing. There is a parlor chair pat- 
 ented, that cannot be tipped back on two legs, and a 
 railway chair that can be tipped back into any po- 
 sition, without any legs at all. Another patent is for 
 a machine that counts the passengers in an omnibus 
 and takes their fares. When a very fat man gets in 
 it counts two, and charges double. There is a va- 
 riety of guns patented that load themselves ; a fish 
 line that adjusts its own bait ; and a rat trap that 
 throws away the rat, and then baits and sets itself, 
 and stands in the corner for another. 

There is a machine also by which a man prints, 
 instead of writing his thoughts. It is played on 
 like a piano. And speaking of pianos, it is estimat- 
 ed that nine thousand are made every year in the 
 United States, giving constant employment to one 
 thousand nine hundred hands, and costing over fwo 
 millions of dollars. There is also an explanation of 
 the principles of the celebrated Hobb's lock. " Its 
 unpickability" depends upon a secondary or false set 
 of tumblers, which prevent the instruments used in 
 picking from reaching the real ones. Moreover, the 
 look is powder proof, and may be loaded through the 
 keyhole and fired off until the burglar is tired of his 
 fruitless work, or fears that the report of his explo- 
 sions will bring to view his experiments more wit- 
 nesses than he desires. Doors and shutters have also 
 been patented, that canuot be broken through with 
 either pick or eledge-hammer. The burglar's occu- 
 pation's gone.'. A harnoon is described which makes 
 the whale kill himself. The more he pulls the line, 
 the deeper goes the harpoon. An ice making ma- 
 chine has been patented, which goes by a steam engine. 
 In an experimental trial it froze several bottles of 
 sherry, and produced blocks of ice of the size of a 
 cubic foot, when the thermometer was standing at 80 
 degrees. It is calculated that for every ton of coal 
 put into the furnace it will make a ton of ice. 

There are no less than twenty-seven patents grant- 
 ed during the year for steam and gas inventions. 
 An improvement is also mentioned in cutting-nails, 
 so as to possess the compound quality of wrought and 
 cut nails. Also, in making copper kettles, by which 
 the kettle is formed by the pressure of a burnisher, 
 as the disc is revolved in a lathe. Out of 493 appli- 
 cations examined, 165 were granted, which shows 
 that nearly three-fourths the labor bestowed in inven- 
 tion is unprofitably employed, probably for want of 
 informaticm relative to machines alredy patented. 
 Many an inventor spends his hours contriving a 
 mechanical improvement, only to find, when he I:as 
 succeeded, that some other inventor has forestalled 
 him, and patented the same invention. 

Fine C.\ttle. — Our friend, Willi.vm Vansant, 

Esq., of Montgomery Square, this county, recently 
 disposed of two cows for the sum of )522U,00. T;.ey 
 were, wc understand, of the full blooded Devon 
 breed. One of them was sold at the Montgomery 
 county Agricultural Exhibition, and the other at the 
 Rising Sun Exhibition. A young heifer of the same 
 breed, was sold by hira "for §50. Anotli(>r cow; 
 "Young Mary," and a Bull "Sir Edward," of the 
 same breed, each to<dc premiums at the M.intgdmery 
 and Philadelphia Exhibitions. The latter was also 
 awarded the premium of fifteen dollars at the Balti- 
 more County (Md.,) Exhibition. Mr. Vansant exhib- 
 its a spirit of enterjirise in tlie improvement of stock, 
 worthy of imitation. His display ul' "Shanghais" at 
 the Montgomery Countv Agricultural Exhibition was 
 very fine, and commanded a large show of attention 
 as well as admiration from those who wore present
