Pedigree of TlKirimgh Bred Durliam Cow, Juno 
 3d, oMiied by Gerard Cope, near West Chester, 
 Chester county. Pa, 

Junn Iho 3(1, red with somo whito. got by Louis 
 Phillippp, d.ini, Juno the 2d, by the imported Bull, 
 "His Grace," grand dam, "Juno the Ist," begotten 
 in England by "Charley," great grand dam, "Red 
 Rose," (imported by Paschall Morris,) by young 
 Magnum Bonum," gr. gr. g. d. by "Barmpton," gr. 
 gr. gr. g. d. by "Northumberland," a son of "Com- 
 et." 

"Louis Phillippe" was got by "Henry Clay," dam, 
 the imported cow, "Bessy," who made over 15 lbs. of 
 butter in a single week. Juno the 3d took t'.ic first 
 premium (or the best thorough bred Durham Cow, at 
 the recent show of the Chester County AgriLnilturnl 
 Society. She is extremely neat and fine in the bone, 
 and there is a qun'.ity and style in her appearance, 
 independent of her having most of the characteristic 
 points of a Durham, which would strike an observer 
 at the firs' glance. Her brisket is deep and project- 
 ing, the loin and hips wide and with a fine back, 
 forming a pretty strait line from the neck to the set- 
 ting on of the tail. Juno the 3d has also the impor- 
 tant point of being a good handler. Being one of a 
 dairy of 23 cows, she has never been tried sepa.ate- 
 ly to tost her exact capacity for milk and butter, 
 but would bo c:illed more of a butter cow than re- 
 markable for the quantity of milk, which is, however, 

unusually rich. This was the case with her dam, 
 grand dam and great grand dam, "Red Rose," and 
 also with "Bessy," the dam of "Louis Philippe." 
 We recollect being present when butter was niade 
 from Bessy's cream in sixty seconds, by stirring it in 
 a tea cup with a spoon, and also saw the cream taken 
 off from her pan of milk in a single piece by lapping 
 over with the skimmer. 

Gerard Cope's dairy may bo cited as a sample of 
 what the Durhams will do for daii-y purposes. They 
 are nearly all of his own raising, and by taking care 
 to select good milkers in the first place, and then 
 breeding them to bulls, whose dams have also been 
 remarkable for deep milking, he has obtained, a dai- 
 ry of 23 cows, not often equalled, for size and qual- 
 ity combined with a large yield of butter. Ten of 
 them on trial for several weeks successively made 
 100 lbs. per week. 

Calves and heifers from those cows, have been sold 
 at high prices and distributed to distant parts of the 
 country. They are chiefly of the red and dark colors. 

To give ocular demonstration by contrast with the 
 foregoing, of the good which has been accomplished, 
 by improving our breeds of stock, we annex a spe- 
 cimen of an unimproved cow, with all her original 
 and acquired tendencies to lay off fat, and to give no 
 milk. The counterparts of the specimen below, are 
 not as uncommon as they should be. "Look upon 
 I this picture, and upon that."

Whilofruit growingof all kinds is too much neglect- 
 ed by our farmers, who conlil make it the must profitOr 
 ble branch of their business, the cultivation of Quinces 
 seems entirely so. The Quince tree is an outcast 
 every where, generally found in some obscure corner 
 or rendezvous for weeds; the trunk surrounded and 
 almost concealed with a thick growth of suckers, 
 b ing never trimmed, or pruned or manured, it seems 
 to be considered one of those productions nature has 
 designed to take care of itself. The truth is, how- 

ever, that the Quince rewards as well for care and 
 attention as any other fruit, and is improved by pro- 
 per treatment, both in quality, size and productive- 
 ness. A ric7i, deep soil is required, which should be 
 kept loose and open by the cultivator, or by the 
 growth of hoed crops, and it is not by any means 
 only adapted to moist land. From the fact of their 
 growing well in such situations, it has boon inferred 
 that they will not do on \qiland, which is a mistake. 
 Some of the finest quinces wc have seen wore from 
 high and dry soils, and they will be found to do
