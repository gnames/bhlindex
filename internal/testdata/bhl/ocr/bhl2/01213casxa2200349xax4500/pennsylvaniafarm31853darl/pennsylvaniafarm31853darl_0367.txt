young bulls, "Liberator" and "Squire Gwynne 2d," 
 bred by J. S. Tanqueray, of Ilenden, near London, 
 as well as several others from other breeders; and a 
 lot of Cotswold shupp. These last are for parties, 
 we understand, at Boston and in some of the west-

Prize FowJs. — In exhibiting Cochin China fowls 
 nothing is miu-e important than matching ig colour, | 
 because there are classes for different ones, and it 
 a cinnamon cock be put with butf pullets, of course, 
 success cannot be hoped for. It is a mistake to sup- 
 pose, because the prize list class buff and cinnamon 
 together, that birds of both colours may be put in 
 cue pen. It must be entirely of one or the other, 
 and in such a class judges can give no prefei-ence to 
 either, but must decide according to the other merits 
 of the birds. Choose them with small, upright, 
 straight, well-serrated combs ; naturally small tails ; 
 ample buff, and well feathered yellow legs. Select 
 them as large as you can, but recollect size is not the 
 only merit, nor is it the most important point. Look 
 for sharp intelligent heads, legs as short as possi- 
 ble, colour uniform throughout. Do not be discour- 
 aged if your fowls are not very heavy, but at tlie 
 same time, make them as good as you can. liens 
 8 lbs. each, and cocks 9 lbs. to 10 lbs. have little to 
 fear. Above all, avoid any trimming or mutilation, 
 which, meant for improvement, can only end in dis- 
 appointment and disqualification. Dorkmg fowls, 
 like all others, should match in form and colour ■ 
 not because colour is any indication ot purity in 
 this breed, but because it is essential to ensure suc- 
 cess, that every possible precaution should be used ; 
 and as I have before written, if the competition be 
 very close, as it always is where the entries are nu- 
 merous, perfect uniformity may turn the scale. Pul- 
 lets of a dark chocolate ground, with white spots or 
 splashes, should be put with either a black breasted 
 red cock or a red and white speckled cock, with black 
 and white mottled breast. Brown hens with black 
 speckles may go with the same cocks, or with a very 
 dark cock, with a little ginger in his hacke), saddle, 
 and wings. Grey hena of every shade should be put 
 with a cock having black breast and tail, silver hackle 
 and s.iddle. Cuckoos must be all alike ; in these 
 birds alone can cocks be found with prBcisely the 
 same plumage of the hens; the combs should al- 
 ways be unifiirm. Choose birds with fine heads, 
 very deep bodies, good carriage, head and tail erect, 
 short white legs, five claws distinctly defined, and 
 prominent breasts ; OJ lbs, for hens, and 9 lbs. for 
 cocks are capital weights. No fowls are so heavy in 
 small compass as the Dorkings; their compactness 
 takes away the appearance of size. Without being 
 deterred by the accounts you will sometimes read of 
 impossible fowls, and marvellous weights, if you can 
 select them right in colour and about the weight I 
 have mentioned, exhibit them with confidence, and 
 even if they are somewhat lighter. Hundreds of 
 successful exhibitors have been surprised to find 
 themselves possessors of large silver medals and val- 
 uable prize stocks, when they imagined they were 
 barely "mediocre." Jo/in Baity. — Gardns Chronical.

Ou the Breeding of Horses. 

From the Mark Lane Express. 
 The letter of your able and experienced corres- 
 pondent "Cecil" induces me to trouble j'ou with a 
 tew remarks on the same subject. I am sure that he 
 is right is saying that "owners of stallions are often 
 reluctant to submit their horses'to the opinion of those 
 who are selected as judges." I go further than 
 this; fur I maintain that their reluctance is a well- 
 founded one, inasmuch as the majority of decisions 
 are based on the mere individual caprice of those 
 who happen to be the judges for the day. For my 
 own part, I will never in future exhibit a horse of 
 any description until two radical changes are 
 made in the principle in which the premiums are 
 awarded. 

1st. Let a scale of points be drawn up, by men of 
 acknowledged authority, which is to be taken as the 
 standard of perfection. This plan has already been 
 adopted at the exhibitions of Guernsey cattle. No 
 prize is there allowed to be awarded to any cow 
 or bull which does not possess a given number of the 
 required points. In the case of horses it might be 
 advantageous to go further, and to make certain 
 points essentials, and others accessories. To. begin 
 with the case mentioned by "Cecil" — that of bad 
 hocks, which, according to him, were looked upon 
 as a venial defect by the judges at Gloucester : I 
 would stamp them as at once uisqualifying a horse 
 from winning a prize, either as a hunter, or as a 
 stallion for getting hunters, even did the animal 
 which was so unfortunate as to possess them exhibit 
 every other merit under the sun. In like manner, 
 mal-furmed feet, whether contracted or too flat, ought 
 to be adecisive disqualification for every kind of horse. 
 All horses too, ought to have their legs properly 
 sot on, and to possess good action, taking into ac- 
 count the purposes for which they are intended. I 
 give these as indications of what I consider the 
 2ssential points of a horse, but by no means a com- 
 plete list. 

These cardinal points being disposed of, I pass to 
 those which, although not essential, indicate either 
 beauty or some useful quality, and which must there- 
 fore not be disregarded. 

The shape of the head is, when symmetrical, both 
 a mark of high blood, (although many thorough-bred 
 horses have bad heads.) and denotes an animal 
 light and pleasant in band, especially when well set 
 cm a neck naturally arching, so as to allow of the 
 head being drawn downwards and inwards without 
 difficulty to the rider or distress to the horse. A 
 star-gazer, or ewe-necked brute, though always ugly, 
 may do useful work in harness, but would be as un- 
 safe as unsightly for a hunter. Many persons attach 
 importance to a horse being well ribbed up. Pro- 
 vided the shape of the barrel is good, considerable 
 latitude may be allowed on this point. The hips 
 ought to present sufficient width ; ragged hips may 
 be unsightly, but I prefer them to those which are 
 too narrow. A long hind quarter is handsome, but; 
 some good horses are both short there, and goosc- 
 rumped. 

These are mere hints jotted down in haste- Let 
 a committee of experienced judges be commissioned 
 by the Royal Agricultural Society to prepare, a 
 table of points, attending first to those which are es- 
 sential to all horses ; secondly, to those which 
 are the characteristics of each separate class, 
 whether hunters, roadsters, or farm horses ; 
 and thirdly, to those which, though not abso- 
 lutely necessary, are nevertheless desirable as indica-
