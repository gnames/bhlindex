ILnv diircrent, and how infinitely to be preferred 
 from the state of affairs at present. Perplexinj^ in- 
 deed, when selecting a, hor.se t n- show, is the reflec- 
 tion you have neither principle to j^uido you in your 
 choice, nor clue as to what will j^overn the decisicm 
 of yourju(i};e. Some judges prefer a large horse, 
 others a small, compact one; one f^ives the | aim to 
 blood, another to power; a third likes bone; while 
 a fourth i.s only to be propitiated by a big body. — 
 Action is everything with some per.^^ons, and noth- 
 ing with others; some look .tt the head, others at 
 the hocks; .and a few of the more judicious are cri- 
 tical concerning the setting on of thelorclegs and the 
 position of the shoulder. There is one piece of advice 
 which I can give to exhibitors, and only one which 
 will bo ot tf.e slightest practical use; attend above 
 oil things to the condition of the animal which you 
 bIiow. Let him be as fat as possible, and let his 
 Bkin shine like a star. Never mind the means, but 
 make this your aim; and if you do not win, you must 
 either have an animal bad indeed, or your luck niu&t 
 be worse than your horse. 

Seriously speaking, this is the only principle which 
 I have been aljle to discover which invarialdy, and 
 under all circumstances, governs the decisions at 
 ngrieultural shows. The horse or the colt which is 
 in the higlu'st condition, and is best "got up," is 
 certain to ho the winner. It is nielanchuly that it 
 should be so ; but it is alas! the (act that the judges 
 must have sumething to "flatter, the eye," as well as 
 the common herd woo are no judges ! It is my firm 
 Ccmviciion that no degree of merit would suffice to 
 secure a premium to a horse thin and out of condi- 
 tion. I might have substituted the word "animal" 
 lor "horse," in the last sentence; but with regard to 
 cattle or sheep, there is at least this excuse — that 
 the "aptitude to fatten" is widi iheni one point of 
 perfecticm. Is this the case with tlie hunter, the 
 hack, or even the team-horse ? For my part, I call 
 that man a judge in the highest sense of the word, 
 who is abh^ aliic to discern merit, or the promise o( 
 it, under a rough skin and an unpampered condi- 
 tion, and who, on the other h;ind, has the strength of 
 mind to reject a defoctivo form, even though eye be 
 flattered by the condition ever so alluring to the vul- 
 gar eye. 

I must defer the discussion of the second change 
 which 1 |n-opose until another letter, should you 
 thing tit to allow me the Bp;ice.

Boii't Sell Your Best Stock. 

Don'tallow those speculatorsanddrovers topick out 
 the likeliest and b:>st of ycmr stock, leaving you only 
 (he ordinary and poorest to breed from. It is the 
 worst policy you can adopt. By continuing such a 
 course, it will be hut a short time befm'e you will 
 hn.ve only ordinary and poor to select from. Suppo- 
 sing you can get a little more for this likely lamb 
 than for the others, you will do well to remember 
 that it costs no more to keep them than it does poor 
 ones; and next shearing time the large fleeces will 
 tell the story in favor of keeping the best you have. 

If you intend to make a practice of raising a colt 
 tvery year, keep the best mare you can alfo.d. 
 llavn't you noticed that when a man comes to pur 
 cbase a young horse he is always particular to know 

all about the stock, &c., before heconcludes his trade? 
 Keep the liest, then, for yourself. 

Don't sell your best '.'ow because you can g'Jt five 
 dollars more for her. Keep her, and she will nim-e 
 than make up the difference ore another year comes 
 around. Just so with everything, Select the liest 
 seed for your own use; and you will always have as 
 good as any one, and be sure of the hiiiho t prices 
 for any you may wish to dispose of. Tliiuk of it.—

neasous for Supplying Cattle with water in tbelr 
 Yards. 

If water cannot be obtained l>y cattle without go- 
 ing out of the j-ard, they will many times suffer ex- 
 ceedingly fur the want of it, rather than go for it in 
 •very bad weather. If good fresh water can bo bad by 
 them without going out of the yard, they will drink 
 very much oftener than in the other ease, especially 
 in cold weather. The oldest and strongest caitle will 
 irenerally go fust to water; and when they have drunk, 
 and are returning, they will meet the young cattle 
 in the narrow snow path, and f coursi? will drive 
 them back; in which case the youngest and feeblest 
 of the hi'.rd will have mucdi trouble and vexation in 
 obtaining water at all. When cattle go to a spring 
 to drink especially if the snow is deep, there will gen- 
 erally be great difficulty in reaching the water i ii ao- . 
 count of the bank of snow and ice, without stepping 
 into it, which cattle are loth to do if the" can help it; 
 many watering places are so steep that cattle are 
 compelled to go down on their knees before they 
 can reach it, and even then, they obtain it with the- 
 greatest difficulty. The cattle on many farms are 
 (d)liged to travel from one-fourth to half a mile for 
 water, and when they arrive at the spot, it is often 
 only to be obtained by them through a hole 
 cut in the ice, perhaps frimi a foot to eighteen inches 
 in thickness. The amount of manure wliiidi is drop- 
 ped and lost on such occasicms is very considerable, 
 and much of it is washed down by the rains into the 
 hole at which they are doomed to drink, where it 
 forms a coffee-colored bever.age, awful t;) behold. 
 Every good farmer will esteem this as a matter of 
 no light importance, considering that all the manure 
 ouglit to be saved, and calculating that the fond of 
 rnttle might as properly be wasted as the food of 
 plants. It has been thought that the exercise of go- 
 ing to water at a considerable distance, is advanta- 
 geous in preventing the hoof ail in cattle; but it is 
 much more likidy that this discu-der often aris.'S from 
 the filth in wet weather, and freezing of the feet in 
 very severe weather, to which they are exposed in 
 their walks to the spring. If cattle are kept in well 
 sheltered yards with sheds for their protection, with 
 uninterrupled access to good water, plenty of salt and 
 warm beds of dry straw, it should not be loo much to 
 promise that they will remain free from the footail 
 ;ind every other "ail" of which we have somuch com- 
 plaint. There is a =trong prejudice .against, wells fop 
 the supnly of water in cattle yards, and there is a 
 much stronger prejudice against the labor of pump- 
 ing the water for them: but to a industrious man, 
 the "prejudice" of a desire to furnish his cattle with 
 a clean and whcdesome hewragp, coid in the summer 
 and warm in the winter, will be stronger than either.
