Prize Essay on Pigs- 
 [concluded from page 236.] 

The best and most economical Mode of Rearing, 
 Keeping, and Fattening Pigs. — In selecting males and 
 females to breed from, neither should be chosen loss 
 than twelve or fifteen months old : the third litter 
 will generally be found the best for this purpose. 
 Whether as boar or sow, the finest of each sex ought 
 only to 'be selected. By these means only will the 
 good points of any breed be perpetuated. There is 
 generally one small pig in every litter, called the rid- 
 dling — this should never be used as an animal to 
 breed from. For sucking pigs and porkers colour is 
 an object — these should invariably be white. For 
 bacon hogs, colour is a matter of indifference, other 
 than the fact that black pigs appear generally to do 
 better on the same amount ot food than the white 
 breeds. A singular reason was assigned to me for 
 the prevalence of black-coloured pigs in Essex, viz : 
 that the white kind was subject to eruption^ of the 
 skin of the black when put into the clover-fields, 
 whilst the black kinds were not obnoxious to this 
 complaint. Probably the white kind had more of 
 the Chinese, and the other more of the Neapolitan 
 breed. It must be remembered, also, that the old 
 Essex breed was a black one. A sow's usual period 
 of gestation is from sixteen to seventeen weeks. 
 When she has arrived near the period of farrowing 
 she will be seen collecting and carrying straws in 
 her mouth, to form her bed. If there exists any sus- 
 picion that the sow will devour her young, as some- 
 times is the case, care should be taken that she is 
 securely muzzled. All sucli sows should be fattened 
 and slaughtered. The carnivorous habit here alluded 
 to is rarely exhibited amongst the improved breeds; 
 amongst the old sows of the rough breed this habit 
 was somewhat prevalent, probably brought on in 
 many instances through deficiency of food. 

Sows should be put to the boar at such times as to 
 avoid farrowing from the middle of October to the 
 end of February, unless sucking pigs fur the festive 
 time of Christmas and the new year is the object; if 
 so ttiey should bo well littered and kept warm. 
 Whether intended for sucking pigs, porkers, or 
 stores, skimmed butter-milk and whey, mixed with 
 steamed potatoes, and a little barley, pea, or oatmeal, 
 should be given in moderate quantities even when 
 sucking; if intended for porkers, they should be kept 
 continually fed up with this mixture. Sucking pigs 
 should never be allowed to run about, and porkers 
 onlj permitted sufficient exercise to keep them in 

health. Where convenient, store-pigs may be allow- 
 ed to pasture in clover, giving them only a morning 
 and evening meal in addition, or they may be allow- 
 to root in fallows or on the dung-heap, and during 
 winter in the straw-yard. In fallows and rough pas- 
 tures swine eagerly devour such weeds as dandeline, 
 chickweed, sowthistle, &c. 

For store pigs, exercise is necessary in order fully 
 to develop the frame. In feeding, tranquility is 
 equally indispensable, a singular exemplification of 
 which was made in the course of the experiments of 
 the Earl of Egremont (1777,) related in the "Annals 
 of Agriculture," upon some porkers, seven of which 
 were put up to fatten in the ordinary manner in a 
 stye, and another of the same brood, but smaller 
 than the others, was put into a cage one week later. 
 All were fed alike on barley-meal. When slaughfr- 
 3red, the one fed in the cage exceeded in weight any 
 of the others. The cage was made so that he could 
 not turn round, and had only suflicient I'oom to rise 
 up and lie down. Whether this mode would prove 
 advantageous on the large scale is a matter of doubt. 
 The experiment has however been adduced by Baron 
 Liebig as a practical evidence of the correctness of 
 his theory respecting the formation of fiit. Too 
 much exercise is well known to retard fattening; 
 or, to use the ordinary phrase used by farmers, 
 "they run all the flesh off their bones." 

Where a large number of hogs arc to be fatt-ened 
 and bred, it has been recommended that the sties 
 should form a semi-circle, the steaming apparatus, 
 &c., being placed by the straight side. This form 
 has many advantages. In a general way, the feed- 
 ing of hogs will only form a minor adjunct to the 
 other business of the farm, and at only few places 
 will it be found convenient toorect new buildings for 
 the purpose, however advantageous they might even- 
 tually prove. There arc some circumstances con- 
 nected with sties which should be iNv.taiAnt.v at- 
 tended to: these arc, that their floors should be well 
 paved with stone, flag, or hard brick, the interior 
 should be elevated half a foot above the exterior 
 area, and a sufficient slope afforded to both, with 
 proper drains to carry all moisture to the dung-heap. 
 Separate sties must be kept for breeding-sows, wean- 
 ing pigs, stores, and fattening pigs. 

Sties should be so constructed that the swine may 
 be fed without the feeder going amongst them; and 
 divisions should be made in tho feeding-trough, ac- 
 cording to the number of swine, in order to prevent 
 the strong driving away the weak; if they can be
