PRIZE ESSAY ON PIGS. 

[December 

made to communicate conveniently with the strawyard 
 and dung-heap, all the better, particularly for stores 
 and brood-sowa. 

The sties should be frequently swept and washed 
 out, and lime-whitened at least three times during 
 the year. The most profitable mode of feeding 
 store-pigs is to commence by giving only inferior 
 sort of food thrice a day, bettering the quality and 
 increasing the quantity as the frame becomes per- 
 fectly developed. The store or youthful period of 
 all animals occurs when their vital and nervous en- 
 ergies are at the highest, which enables them to as- 
 similate nutriment from indifferent food. Moderate 
 exercise at the same time assists nature and aids the 
 full development of the frame, the animal being thus 
 gradually prepared to take on that increased amount 
 of muscle and fat which ultimately repays the far- 
 mer for his toil and expenditurs. In making choice 
 of food for hogs there can be little doubt but pota- 
 toes, when plentiful, mixed with pease or bean- meal 
 is the most economical food for store pigs, and the 
 same food mixed with Indian meal and butter-milk 
 is the best adapted fcr feeding porkers. In cheese 
 dairies, pease or bean-meal should always be mixed 
 with the whey, in order to replace the caseous mat- 
 ter abstracted by the cheese. Swede turnips boiled 
 form only an inferior substitute for potatoes, their 
 feeding properties not being equal to carrots and 
 parsnips; in fact, on the two latter, hogs will do well 
 if combined with milk and a little bean or pea-meal. 
 Oatmeal and skimmed milk is the best food for aid- 
 ing sucking pigs and very small porkers of 40 to 50 
 lbs. weight. 

The theory of the action of the various articles of 
 food named is as follows — amylaceous or starchy 
 food, such as potatoes, aid in sustaining the animal 
 heat and the formation of fat, the latter property Ije- 
 ing much increased when assisted by other nutritious 
 matters in a more concentrated form, particularly 
 maize or Indian corn. Pea or bean-meal, from the 
 great amount of caseous matter which they contain, 
 should invariably form a portion of the food of grow- 
 ing pigs, affording, as they do, the material for form- 
 ing the cellular and other tissues, in such a high de- 
 gree indeed that hogs fed on bean-meal alone are 
 well known to form bacon disagreeably hard. Where 
 pigs are fed without skim or buttermilk, pea or bean- 
 meal should form an invariable part of their food. 
 An inferior substitute for pea and bean-meal is fre- 
 quently used in the shape of bran and pollard which 
 contain a considerable portion of the elementary 
 substances required to develop the bones and tissues. 
 In the present uncertainty of the potato-crop it would 
 be hazardous to make that tuber the basis for the 
 calculation of the cost of producing swine's flesh : 
 if it unfortunately eventuate that the potato, from its 
 liability to disease, should in a great measure cease 
 to be cultivated to the extent that it has formerly 
 been, the feeding of hogs will necessarily be thrown 
 principally on milk and grain. If this should prove 
 to be the case, barley, from the large amount of 
 starch which it contains, will be found the bast sub- 
 stitute for the potato; in which case one-third by 
 weight of barley, one-third of bran or pea-meal, and 
 one-third Indian meal, will be found the cheapest 
 and best mixture for growing hogs; the pea-meal to 
 be lessened and the Indian meal increased as the hog 
 approaches maturity. 

Potatoes mixed with above grains form the most 
 appropriate food for store and fattening hogs, gradu- 
 ally withdrawing the potatoes, and finishing the 
 feeding with dry balls of the mixture named. For 

exquisitely fine pork, whether to be consumed fresh 
 or as bacon, the hogs should be fed solely on skim and 
 buttermilk mixed with oatmeal. The mixture of In- 
 dian corn, barley, and pea-meal forms a very close 
 imitation of the constituents of oatmeal. It has 
 been found very profitable to consume tares by store 
 hogs. 

Since the preceding was written the writer has 
 had the opportunity of visiting ths exhibition of the 
 Smithfield Cattle Club (1848); and from observations 
 made there of the comparative merits of the different 
 breeds of swine, together with their outward physi- 
 cal appearances and structure, he was glad to find 
 that the preceding observations were fully borne out. 
 For instance, the Earl of Radnor's Coleshill pigs, 18 
 weeks and 2 days old, must be descended from a 
 cross of the Chinese and improved Berkshire. They 
 were fed on barley-meal and whey; had a little pea- 
 meal been added they would have made a better ap- 
 pearance. This breed is admirably calculated for 
 full-sized porkers of 80 lbs. weight. Lot 99, which 
 obtained the second prize of 51., were described as 
 14 weeks old true Essex pigs; obtained the breed 
 originally from Mr. Hobbs, fed on barley-meal and 
 milk. In this lot the Chinese breed predominated, 
 as exhibited by their broader muzzles. Lot 98, de- 
 scribed as Heathfield pigs, were admirably calculated 
 for porkers, whilst lot 97, from tbe stock of Mr. F. 
 Hobbs, fed on Indian corn-meal, barley-meal, and 
 skim-milk, exhibited more of the points of the Nea- 
 politan, and would have shown their best points at 
 10 or 12 months old. Lot 95, which took away the 
 highest nrize in this class (lOZ.), was fed on mid- 
 dlings, barley-meal, pea-meal, and potatoes. They 
 were christened "Improved Middlesex;" they were 
 however undoubtedly obtained by crossing the Chi- 
 nese, Neapolitan, and improved Berkshire and old 
 Essex. The Neapolitan form predominated in this 
 lot. For bacon hogs there was a lot exhibited. No. 
 189, by Mr. Matthew Newman, of improved Buck- 
 inghamshire and Berkshire pigs. They were of a 
 bracky colour, were highly commended, and, for 12 
 to 18 months old hogs, are a most desirable breed. 

In looking over the pigs exhibited at the late 
 Smithfield Exhibition it will be seen that those fed 
 on barley-meal, pea-meal, and skim-milk, or analo- 
 gous food, were the finest animals; that, in the small- 
 er class of pigs, the improved Essex breed was pre- 
 ferred; the only prize taken by any other breed being 
 by his Royal Highness Prince Albert, which I at- 
 tribute not to the breed but to the food. Mr Pusey's 
 pigs were very fine specimens of the hardy rough 
 Berkshire kind; they were 73 weeks old, fed on bar- 
 ley-meal, toppings, peas, and wash. If there was 
 any fault to be found with them it was that the fat 
 appeared slightly deficient in firmness. The breei. 
 of which Pusey's were specimens is well calculated,, 
 to rough it on coarse and scanty fare during the stora 
 period, and are good foragers if sent abroad to looku 
 for their livelihood. 

Some excellent pigs were exhibited amongst the 
 extra stock; the one which obtained the silver medal, 
 a cross between the Suffolk and Berkshire breeds, • 
 48 weeks and 3 days old, fed on barley and pean- 
 meal, was a very fine specimen, and admirably oalt. 
 culated for a bfioon hog. Mr. Barber's improvedi.' 
 Middlesex (Qu. Esses?), 24 weeks and 4 days old, 
 fed on middlings (coarse flour), barley-meal, and por 
 tatoes, was a fine specimen of the small breed. Hia-, 
 Royal Highness' Bedford and Yorkshire pig, 40r. 
 weeks and 3 days old, fed on barley and pea-meal, 
 pe^i and skimmed milk^ was Tejy justly hfg^iJjt,
