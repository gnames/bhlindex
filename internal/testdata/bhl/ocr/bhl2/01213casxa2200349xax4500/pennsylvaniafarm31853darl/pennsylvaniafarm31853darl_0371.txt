Sufficient examples have been shown to prove that 
 the cross known as the improved Essex is the best 
 breed for general purposes, if intended to be slaugh- 
 tered under 12 months old. For larger animals 
 crosses from the larger breeds which do not arrive so 
 early at maturity are to be preferred- The examples 
 here adduced also go far to prove that where the 
 breed and mode of feeding recommended in the prior 
 part of this paper are combined, there the greatest 
 amount of meat and fat is formed, and on trial it 
 will be found also to be at the least expenditure of 
 food and capital. It will be well to observe that 
 middlings is an inferior description of wheaten flour; 
 toppings or sharps is a fine description of pollard; 
 all of which contain muscular and tissue-forming 
 substances very analagous to pea and bean flour. In 
 some localities favourable to the purpose, a number 
 of hogs are reared and even fattened in what may 
 be termed a wild state, on acorns and beech mast. 
 I do not know of any experiments that give suffici- 
 ently accurate details of^ all the circumstances re- 
 quisite to arrive at correct inferences respecting the 
 cost of obtaining a given amount of swine's flesh 
 rom a stated quantity of food, all the experiments 
 detailed in the Sussex, Buckingham, H.ampshire, 
 Middlesex, Shropshire, &o., reports to the Board of 
 Agriculture being more or less deficient in details 
 which are requisite to form correct estimates. One 
 important experiment reported in the Buckingham 
 Survey ought not to be passed ovei', as it serves m 
 show accurately what is well known to pig-feeders, 
 that there is a point in fattening hngs beyond which 
 a decided loss will accrue if persevered in. Thus, 
 the increase of flesh in a pig put up to be fattened, 
 and regularly weighed, was, on the following dates :

 It is well remarked in the Hampshire Survey — 
 "That the native hog of this county is a coarse, 

raw-boned, flat-sided animal, agreeing in no respect 
 with the idea entertained of it in other parts of the 
 kingdom; the greater number fed for a few weeks in 
 the close of autumn upon the mast which the forest 
 and other woodlands produce in the county, and the 
 excellent mode of curing hog-meat practised by the 
 housekeepers have contributed in a far greater de- 
 gree to establish that superiority ascribed to Hamp- 
 shire bacon, than any inherent excellence in its na- 
 tive breed of hogs. 

"Very few, however, of the genuine native hogs 
 are to be met with, the common stock being either 
 the native Berkshire breed, or a considerable pre- 
 dominance of that blood in the native swine of the 
 country. 

"Subsequent crosses upon the native Berkshire 
 with the Suffolk and Chinese breed have produced 
 an animal of a hardy nature, prone to get fat at an 
 early age, and always to keep in good condition in a 
 store state. The experiments made by Mr. Butter 
 of Liphook show that nearly 100, that is, 96 lbs. of 
 bacon, may be obtained from the consumption of 9 
 bushels, or 450 lbs. of barley equally 4J lbs. of bar- 
 ley for 1 lb. of bacon, and which, admitting the bar- 
 ley to be worth Id. per lb., the bacon thus produced 
 will cost, exclusive of attendance, 4Jd. per lb. 

"The barley reckoned at 4^. M. per bushel, inclu- 

ding grinding, and the bacon at 6d. per lb. in its 
 green state, the account will stand thus — 

£. s. d. 

96 lbs. bacon at M. per lb. 2 8 

9 bushels of barley at 4s. 6d. 2 6 

Leaving a profit upon 9 bushels of barley 

thus expended of 7 6 

Besides the dung and ofi'al of the hog, which must 
 well defray the expense of attendance, risk, &c. 

"Other statements of the like nature were sought 
 for on the survey; but through the want of attention 
 in Kscertaining with correctness the lean weight of 
 the animals before they were put up to fatten, and 
 accurately stating the quantity and value of the 
 feeding mess, render the various statements of little 
 practical value, notwithstanding which the surveyor 
 ( Vancouver) gave it as his general opinion 'that the 
 Berkshire, Suffolk, or Chinese breed, at an equal 
 and proper age and condition, will lay on 10 lbs. of 
 bacon for every bushel of barley, after grinding into 
 meal, consumed by them.'" 

It is unfortunate the preceding account is also 
 vague respecting the bacon, whether it is valued as 
 bacon cured, or merely cut up for salting: as swine's 
 flesh loses from 5 to 10 per cent, in weight in curing, 
 though weighed in the green, or undried and un- 
 smokod state. I believe the cured meat is meant. 

I have found that when pigs have been fed on the 
 following articles, mixed, and calculated at the prices 
 named, fresh pork can be rj.ised for 4rf. per pound, 
 viz : — Indian (maize) meal at 286\ per 480 lbs.; bar- 
 ley at 32.S. per quarter; peas and beans at 36s. ditto; 
 and potatoes at \s. 2d. per bushel of 70 lbs.; and 
 that skim and butter milk is worth Id. per gallon for 
 feeding pigs, when mixed with barley-meal, potatoes 
 and Indian meal. There are many substances — 
 such as starch refuse, brewers' grains, distillers' 
 wash and grains, &o., which, under particular cir- 
 cumstances, are used for feeding hogs; notwithstand- 
 ing which such are out of the pale of ordinary agri- 
 culture. A singular mode of cooking potatoes for 
 hogs is nnmed in the Berkshire report, viz : baking 
 them. In feeding hogs the following general rules 
 should be p.irticularly attended to: 

Feed regidarly, as abundance of food will not 
 make up for the loss arising from irregular feeding. 
 Pigs know their feeding-time very accurately, and 
 nothing retards their feeding so much as allowing 
 them to be pining and weazening for their anticipa- 
 ted regular meal. Also mix a little salt witli their 
 food; keep the troughs and animals clean, their sties 
 and bids dry and warm. Vary the bill of fare; in 
 doing so, however, be careful not to lower the gener- 
 al standard of the diet; hogs do much better when 
 their food is varied. Stores, brood-sows and feeding- 
 hogs should all be fed separately; two hogs will fat- 
 ten better in company than reparately. 

Hogs do better on cooked than raw food. Some 
 instructive exneriments on tliis point are recorded in 
 the Highland Transactions. I have seen some hoga 
 of the improved large Irish breed feed to very great 
 weights on raw potatoes alone — the flesh good and 
 firm; these are, however, rare instances. 

When the sow is suckling, she should have extra 
 food; oatmeal, milk, and potatoes, or pea-meal, potar 
 toes, and milk, are the best. At the time of farrow- 
 ing she should be carefully watched, and the young 
 ones removed; the placenta or after-birth ought also 
 to be removed, otherwise she will devour it, and thus 
 engender a morbid appetite, which may eventually 
 cause her to devour her young. Abortion seldom
