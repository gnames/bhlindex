Grave's Patent Corn Sheller. 

The above cut represents a new Patent Corn Shel" 
 ler which has lately been exhibited to us, rather nove' 
 in construction, and from its cheapness and simpli- 
 city, seems well adapted for the farmer, who cultiva- 
 tes on a small scale. The owner represents it as ca- 
 pable of shelling with ease 5 to 6 bushels an hour, 
 worked by a single person. It is operated by the 
 foot, deposits the cobs on one side, and the corn on 
 the other. The latter wo observed to be as entirely 
 clean as if run through the fan. It occupies very 
 little room. The patent seems to consist in forcing 
 the ears separately, between a set of shelling^plates, 
 while at the same time they are twisted on their 
 axis. 

The engraving represents a table to which the corn 
 eholling apparatus is secured and supported by four 
 legs. The shelling plates are four in number, and 
 arranged in pairs at right angles to each other,, and 
 pivoted at their lower extremities, one pair is small- 
 er than tlie others, which lap over it, and is acted 
 upon liy springs, whieh thus force the upper'edgcs of 
 all four plates to approach each other. The shelling 
 plates are inclosed in an inverted conical case, which 
 prevents the scattering of tho shelled corn. A cross 
 bar is supported above the shelling plates, by two 
 rods, which passing through the table, are secured to 
 a cross bar beneath to which motion in imparted by 
 the spring treadle, secured to the base board. The 
 opposite extremities of the upper cross bar, are fur- 
 nished with pins, which are guided in curved grooves, 
 secured to a pair of upright standards, projected from 
 the upper edge of the case. The lower cross bar is 

slightly hollowed, at its middle and is fitted with » 
 sharp iron. The ear of corn to be shelled, is insert- 
 ed edgewise between upper edges of the shelling 
 plates, and the lower face of the cross bar above 
 them; the foot of the operator is then applied to de- 
 press the treadle, and thus force the ear between the 
 shelling edges; the latter are pressed towards each 
 other by the springe, with sufficient force to remove 
 the grains but not to enter the cob. As the cross bar 
 descends, it is turned by the action of tho curved 
 guides, — grooves, thus twisting the ear, and great 
 ly facilitating the action of the shelling plates. As 
 fast as one ear is forced down, the pressure of the foot 
 is relaxed, and the spring of the treadle throws up 
 the cross bar, to receive a second ear, which expels 
 the cob of the first, fiom between the shelling plates. 
 Tho shelled corn is collected by the case, from which 
 it falls, through openings, made in the table into 
 suitable receptacles. 

Price of this machine is only $5 — Patent rights

Colic in Horses.- — A Tennessee correspondent 
 says: — The best remedy that I have tried for colic in 
 horses is, one pint of whiskey and two-thirds of % 
 teacup of gunpoAvdcr. Mix well and drcnoli tho 
 horse. In ordinary cases the ho; so will be well in 
 half an hour. 

If you would teach secrecy to others, begin with 
 yourself. IIow can you expect another will keepyouT 
 secret when you cannot yourself. '
