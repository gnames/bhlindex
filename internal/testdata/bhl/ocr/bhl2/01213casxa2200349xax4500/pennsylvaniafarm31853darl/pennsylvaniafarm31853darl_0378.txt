Messes. Editors: — Being a constant reader of the 
 Farm Journal since the first number, and having ob. 
 served the increasing attention and ability infused 
 into its columns as it progresses, and its consequent 
 accumulating value to practical Agriculturists, I beg 
 permision to express my gratification that a journal 
 devoted especially to this subject has found genial 
 elements amongst my fellow farmers to justify the 
 increased expenses necessarily incurred in raising it 
 from its comparalively small beginning to its present 
 apparently highly prosperous condition, creditable 
 alike to its spirited conductors, and to the discernment 
 of the agricultural community in which it at present 
 flourishes. 

In every department of business connected with the 
 occupation of a farmer, its columns teem with interest 
 and instruction, which lam well assured is not lost 
 upon those concerned. Amongst the reliable proofs 
 to this happy effect is the fact, that many feel embol- 
 dened to convey through your cclumBS for the bene" 
 fit of others, the result of their own experience, or 
 their settled convictions on questions of admitted im. 
 portance, expecting and even courting discussion even 
 if the bases upon which their conclusions have been 
 founded should crumble under the operation. Of this 
 latter character may be considered the following re- 
 marks, submitted to the consideration of farmers 
 under the impression that many have not given the 
 Subject the attention that its bearing on their particu- 
 lar interest demands. I allude to the past, thepresent> 
 and the prospective aspect of Agricultural investments 
 and the causes which have, and probably will con. 
 tinue to affect them. 

The great and suddenly increased price of farm 
 land since the commencement of the present year has 
 taken our farming community bysurprise. And noj 
 a few are disposed to take advantage of what appears 
 when connected with former experience, to be atran- 
 eient speculative value, to subside to its former level 
 in the course of a few months or at farthest in a year 
 or two; by offeiing their property for sale. All farm 
 produce has been similarly effected to a greater or 
 less extent, and a disposition is very generally man- 
 ifested to convert it at once into money at its present 
 saleable price, least the usual diminution in value 
 maj' commence with the articles yet unsold. 

That the cause of the recent advance of prices is 
 not due to diminished production must be apparent 
 upon a slight examination of the subject, and that it 
 is not due to increased consumption beyond the usual 
 increase of supply is equally clear, from the fact that 
 the quantity exported beyond the limits of our coun- 
 try has not been materially increased since the 
 commencement of the rise. To some other causes, 
 then, it must be ££ttributed, and questions of interest 

to the farmer are, to what cause must it be ascribed? 
 And will that cause operate transiently or permanent- 
 ly? Will it remain stationary or be progressive? Due 
 examination it is believed will lead to the conclusion 
 that the present prices generally will prove to be per. 
 manent — or even progressive toanextentnot easily for- 
 seen, and a relapse to their former money price im. 
 probable if not impossible, for the following reasons, 
 1st, from the increase and still increasing quantity of 
 gold in the worlds currency, and its necessary dimu- 
 nition in value, 2nd, from the legal debasement of 
 of the standard of silver coin by the Government to 
 meet the'diminishing value of gold, and 3rdly (though 
 not permanently) from the prospective increased de- 
 mand for agricultural products to supply the deficien- 
 cy alledged in the present crops of Western Europe, 
 stimulated by the prospect of an extensive continen- 
 tal war. 

With respect to gold it must be home in mind 
 that the amount in value produced from our own 
 mines since the beginning of 1850 has reached ■ the 
 enormous sum of overtwo hundred millions of dollars, 
 one half of which has remained in the country to 
 swell the currency already large before the balance 
 passing to English hands principally, has, with the 
 amount received from their own colonial mines du- 
 ring the last two years, created a redundancy there 
 also, perhaps as great in proportion to the business 
 of the country as that experienced here. The mines 
 of Russia also have been producing about fifty million 
 dollars worth annually since 1845. The rates of pro- 
 duction from the three sources named, will probably 
 from present prospects, continue for an indefinite 
 number of years. From these data it is not unrea- 
 sonable to infer that the recent predictions, that in 
 ten years from this time the metallic currency of the 
 world will be donble that of the year 1850, will be 
 fully realized. 

It was early discovered here that the qitaniiiy of 
 gold had diminished the commercial value below its 
 legal value in current coin, while silver in quantity 
 and legal value remained stationary and commanded 
 a premium in gold standard coin, increasing inverse- 
 ly as the value of gold diminished, and their circula- 
 tion together at their legal values respectively be- 
 came impossible. Silver mainly disappeared fi'om 
 circulation and from the country. To correct this 
 discrepancy an unwise Congress deemed it good pol- 
 icy during the sessions of 1852-3 to equalize the stan- 
 dard value of coin of both metals, not by requring an 
 increased, quantify of gold in the several coins of that 
 metal, but by diminishing the quanlity of silver in 
 the dollar, and its fractional parts, to the required 
 exten t, (the extent of diminution I gather from the 
 public prints at the time amounted to 29 grains from 
 213 gr. formerly contained in the dollar but not hav- 
 ing seen the act I cannot speak positively) said to be 
 nearly 14 per cent, and continuing it as a legal ten-
