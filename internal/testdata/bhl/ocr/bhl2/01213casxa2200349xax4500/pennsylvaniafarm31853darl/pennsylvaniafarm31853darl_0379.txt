der at its former. This amount of debasement what- 
 ever it be, will measure precisely the extent of the 
 depreciation of our currency at the time of the pas- 
 sage of the act. A further accumulation of gold from 
 year to year will require a corresponding debasement 
 of silver coin to meet its diminishing value, until, if 
 continued a few years, jpure silver and gold vrill be- 
 come of equal value for equal weights or in other 
 terms, our standard dollar in either metal will be 
 worth about one sixteenth of their value in 1850. This 
 may be an extreme that will never be realized, but to 
 whatever extent it may progress, in precisely the 
 same ratio must the price of all saleable commod- 
 ities advance to maintain the real value in that year- 
 It will be observed, if these premises be correct, that 
 a portion of the late increase in the price of farm land 
 audits products is owing to an increase in theg?(anij7y 
 of our metalic cui-rency, and a further influence has 
 been exerted by a debasement of the currency by 
 which their relative value is measured. These two 
 causes, to whatever extent they have or may effect 
 the saleable value of commodities may be considered 
 permanently in action and their intensity to increase 
 progressively so long as the production of gold in al' 
 nations maintains its present rate of accumulation. 

The increase of demand and consequent advance 
 of price for breadstuffs for European consumption, 
 will probably be very considerable,j independent of 
 the fluctuations in value and amount of the circula- 
 ting currency, which has been equally felt there as 
 in this country. All Western Europe has given ev- 
 idence by acts of their several Governments but sel- 
 dom resorted to, for the encouragement of the impor- 
 tation of foreign grain, that the crops in all the mar- 
 atime countries on the west of that continent have 
 been unusually short of the amount required for local 
 consumption. Their usualsources of supply have been 
 Russia and the United States, when such deficiency 
 has occurred, and even under ordinary cicumstances 
 of failure, we might anticipate a rise of fifty percent 
 in the prices of wheat and Indian corn, the prospect 
 at present is that the whole deficiency must be drawn 
 from the United St.atcs alone, in consequence of a 
 probable state of war preventing the grain fromRils- 
 sia finding its way into any of tiie countries requir 
 ing it. 

In view of these considerations and prospective 
 forebodings which to some extent have been already 
 realized and to a much greater extent are almost cer 
 tain to be .so, it is respectfully suggested that wisdom 
 and prudence would council our farmers to consider 
 thoroughly the consequence to their interests to re- 
 sult from disposing of their lands or other permanent 
 property — under the prospects before us, even at the 
 present comparatively high and tempting prices. The 
 fluctuation of the currency cither in value or quan- 
 ty will not effect the real value of property cither 
 advantageously or adversely, and all whose means 

are thus invested, will, with common prudence and 
 forecast, pass unharmed through the ordeal; not so, 
 however, with those with those whose dependance 
 and means are on money in any form, at interest or 
 otherwise, the whole weight of ultimate loss will fall 
 on the latter exclusively. A single exemplification of 
 this position will serve to illustrate the object arrived 
 at in tlie foregoing discussion. 

Upon the supposition that a certain property would 
 have commanded in 1850 a price of ten thousand dol- 
 lars, and at this this time thirteen thousand dollars 
 could be obtained for it, andthat in 185G sixteen thou- 
 sand dollars will measure its value, it would fol- 
 low that the property had been improved to the extent 
 of thr;e thousand dollars in 1853 and six thousand 
 dollars in 1856,or that sixteen thousand dollars in 1856 
 was of no greater value than thirteen thousand in 
 1853 or ten thousand dollars in 1850. The latter is 
 the true state of the case: the holder of the property 
 maintains his interest like a cork floating on a rising 
 surface, while the money owner has suffered the 
 loss of depreciation in its value. Transactions of 
 every day occurrence will justify this parallel to the 
 letter.

The attention of Horticulturists in this county, has 
 recently been called to the probable advantages of 
 the culture of several new cro^s, among which tho 
 willow seems most prominent. Several rewards are 
 offered, by a member of the society to the most suc- 
 cessful cultivator. Hence there is much inquiry as to 
 the most suitable soil, variety of willow and manner 
 of propagation and culture. It would seem, by the 
 dearth of experimental facts, in Agricultural and 
 Horticultural works, to be a comparatively new bus- 
 iness. 

For these reasons it is thought expedient to give, 
 from the best European authorities the rrethod prac- 
 tised there according to Loudon, than whom, no wri- 
 ter has C(mdensedmorc important information on this 
 and kindred subjects. 

To his Arboretum et Fruticctum Brittanicum, — o 
 work not in the society's Library; consequently not 
 easily accessible to its members, — we are indebted for 
 most of the following information. 

It is pleasant to state, that the subject is not en- 
 tirely new to all the members of our society. Fine 
 prepared osiers and their manufacture -were exhibi- 
 ted last September, by one of our members. From 
 him much valuable information may be obtained. 
 His investigations and he has availed himself of all 
 practical facts within his reach, led him to adopt tho 
 common willow, so extensively cultivated near Wil- 
 mington and in this county, for the manufacture of 
 charcoal for gunpowder. Its quality for basket-ma-
