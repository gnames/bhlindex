The Potatoe Plant. 
 J. Lacet Darlington : 

Dear Sir: — We promised your readers of the Oc- 
 tober No. our opinion having reference to adaptation 
 of soil, and depth of planting and locality. In or- 
 der to prevent us being assailed by any who may 
 differ vfith us in the views laid down, we might 
 state that we desire nothing more nor less than a 
 fair trial, and let the verdict fall accordingly. 

1st, Adaptation of soil and depth of planting. 

The soil in order to bring it in a good condition 
 for planting potatoes should be as permeable as pos- 
 sible; a field that has been plowed the previous sea- 
 son is better than sod, and if otherwise no such 
 place will be suitable, we would recommend having 
 the sod plowed that the frost will spend its force 
 upon it and soften the clods — by no means would we 
 recommend planting them under the sod as is often 
 done, for several special and what we consider sub- 
 stantial reasons — first, it should be the intention to 
 have them slightly covered with soil, that the air 
 will, as far as possible, have access to the roots; and 
 secondly, it will be almost impossible to bring the 
 soil in the condition indicated by only once plowing. 
 We have, therefore, premised that the potatoe should 
 not be planted deep, and that even the small quanti- 
 ty of soil which we would have placed upon them, 
 should be mellow for reasons already laid down> 
 namely, to have free access of the atmosphere. We 
 know a farmer in our community who manures his 
 field in common as for any other crop, and covers 
 the potatoes — plantings — with rye straw and then 
 passes the plow along and covers them slightly with 
 earth, and his crops are generally (/ood and not af- 
 fected with the rot. It will, therefore, be seen that 
 we consider the health of the potato to depend on 
 the permeability and mellowness of the soil, together 
 with constant access of the atmosphere. 

As for locality, we fully believe that this, not less 
 important than any of the other points laid down, is 
 too little thought of by the farmer. How often do 
 we see large pieces with potatoes, in low, marshy, 
 heavy soil, and as often poor crops; the potatoes after 
 digging, very heavy and full of sap, and a few weeks 
 after are half rotten. Experience has proven since 
 the potatoe plant is naturalised, that high grounds 
 are preferable and still more so, if they possess the 
 qualifications already said, to wit, permeability and 
 mellowness. It should be readily drained that no 
 water stagnates between the rows which will invaria- 
 bly produce a heavy potatoe. 

It should also be the aim of farmers to select a 
 piece where surrounding obstacles will not prevent a 
 free draft of the atmosphere. This is a most im 
 portant point and is very frequently the cause of 
 firehlast. Potatoes are planted near some woody 
 place, orchard, &c., and is it not well known that we 

rarely can expect a good crop ? We would recom- 
 mend, if at all practicable, a place which is open 
 and accessible on all sides by the atmosphere; we 
 could point to numerous instances in our vicinity 
 where this alone was the cause of a failure. 

We have now done, and if any of your patrons 
 will give our experiments, &o., a trial, we hope a fu- 
 ture will reveal with what success it was attended.

Profits of the Fruit Culture and the hest varie- 
 ties for Market. 
 We extract from the "Country Gentleman" a 
 report of an informal meeting of Pomologists in' 
 New York, on one of the evenings during the recent 
 State Fair at Saratoga. It embodies some valuable 
 information, and is of general interest. The subject 
 of pear blight is of great importance, and by thus 
 comparing notes and observations, it is to be hoped 
 a remedy for this great drawback to pear culture 
 may yet be found, as well as the cause of it. It seems 
 to be admitted that a forced and unnatural growth, 
 by stimulating manures increases the liability to be 
 attacked, and als) that it is more prevalent some sea- 
 sons than others. We have never before had so much 
 of it in our own grounds, as this year, nor heard of 
 it to the same extent in the neighborhood of Wes 
 Chester. 

First Evening. — Cracking of the Pear. — The sub- 
 ject of the cracking of the pear was introduced, and 
 a number of gentlemen present were unanimous in 
 stating that in New England and in other places 
 where the cracking had generally destroyed the 
 White Doyenne, (or Virr/alieu,) this variety had en- 
 tirely escaped when propagated on the quince. 
 The only exception was mentioned by A. Saul, of 
 Newburg, where it is usually quite fair, but du, 
 ring the present season of extraordinary rains- 
 it had cracked badlv, and alike on both quince and 
 pear. E. W. Leavenworth, of Syracuse, said that of 
 the thousands of bearing trees of that place, none 
 had ever cracked except those brought from Long 
 Island; hence the inference that the disease was 
 mainly from a constitutional condition of the stock 
 or variety — most others, however, inclined to tho 
 opinion that this disaster results from a peculi- 
 arity of the season. Tho present year it had been 
 more prevalent than usual; A. Saul stated that all 
 his early pears were fine and the late ones much in- 
 jured; the first part of the season being favorable, 
 and the latter excessively wet. Cases were mention- 
 ed, however, where the influence of soil had contrib- 
 uted to the same result, in trees dissimilarly affected 
 in the same immediate neighborhood, subjected alike 
 to every peculiarity of the season. 

The only instance known where the Seckel had 
 ever cracked, was stated by E. W. Leavenworth, whose 
 trees had in one instance borne badly cracked fruit. 
 Every alternate row in his Seckel orchard had been 
 heavily manured in the spring, the others remaining 
 unmanured, but all were affected alike. 

Several expressed the opinion that the Van Mons 
 Leon le Clerc had of late years been less affected 
 with cracking than formerly, and that the over-es- 
 timate at first placed upon it had induced many to '
