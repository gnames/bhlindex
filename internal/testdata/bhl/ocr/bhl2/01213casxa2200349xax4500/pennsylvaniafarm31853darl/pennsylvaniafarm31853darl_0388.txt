370 CEDAR OF LEBANON-PENNSYLVANIA HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. 1 December 

an ice house for the benefit of your numerous read- 
 ers, if you think it worthy of an insertion. My 
 house is ten feet square, which is sufficiently large 
 for any private family. I excavated the earth to the 
 depth of eight feet, by eleven in length and breadth; 
 then made a frame consisting of four sills, four 
 plates and eight posts, framed so as to make it ten 
 feet square; I then have sis inches of space at each 
 side of my frame, which I fill by placing plank two 
 inches thick horizontally and filling in with clay as 
 I place them. This will finish the house all but the 
 roof and gables. 

And for convenience in filling, the roof should be 
 adjusted so as to be easily removed, which can be 
 done by placing an upright post in the centre of each 
 gable of whatever height you desire for the pitch of 
 your roof, then by laying a plate from post to post 
 you have a stool for each side of the roof to rest on, 
 independent of each other, without the rafters being 
 connected, which enables you to lift either or both 
 sides off for the purpose of filling. For the gables it 
 requires an extra pair of rafters, independent of the 
 roof, to weatherboard against; then leave a door aj 
 one end and embank and sod the rest, and your 
 house is complete. For a bottom I prefer cord wood 
 or rails, covered with straw; also straw set up be 
 tween the ice and plank. I break my ice fine and- 
 throw water on it until it is frozen in one cake. By 
 the above method I have at this date plenty of icg 
 in my house, (plenty even if it was warm weather.)

Messrs. Editors : — Professor Silliman in his late 
 interesting work thus describes it, giving an account 
 of this wonderful garden. He says : — 

"On a mount called the Labyrinth from its intri- 
 cate windings, there is a magnificent Cedar of Leba- 
 non, which was presented to Jussieu by Collinson, o^ 
 England, in 1734. It is still in full vigor. At six 
 feet from the ground, it is ten and a half feet in cir_ 
 curaference. Its broad spreading horizontal branch, 
 es, so numerous, and thickly studded with sombre 
 evergreen spiculfe, extend far and wide, shading a 
 large area, and enabled us to understand and to re- 
 alise how grand and glorious was once the venerable 
 Libanus, adorned by forests of its own native cedars. 
 It was a source of satisfaction to me, while waiting 
 the arrival of my companions, to sit contemplatively 
 under the shadows of this princely tree." 

I would that one of your good neighbors, who has 
 done so much to interest us all in the character of 
 this same "Collinson, of England," might have oc- 
 cupied a seat along side of his friend Silliman, "con- 
 templatively under the shadow of this princely tree."

Messrs. Editors: — A distinguished traveller thus 
 speaks of the substance of Porcelain of our own 
 country, in describing his recent visit to the manu- 
 factory at Sevres, 100 leagues from Paris ; 

"We have in the United States the most perfect 
 materials. Nothing can exceed the feldspar of Ches- 
 ter county, Pennsylvania, from which the beautiful 
 Philadelphia porcelain was made, and which, when 
 placed alongside of that of Sevres, could not be dis- 
 tinguished froni it." — -Silliman. 

This \a,st fact he gives from his own observation 
 on the'spot, where the comparison was made under 
 his eye, in company with the French Superinten- 
 dant. 

Could not the Farm Journal give us some little 
 history of this attempt to manufacture porcelain at 
 home ? DELTA.
