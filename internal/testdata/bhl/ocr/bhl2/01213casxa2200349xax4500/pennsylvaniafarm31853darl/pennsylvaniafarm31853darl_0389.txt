Ad Interim Fruit Report, for November. 

Philadelphia, Nov. 14, 1853. 
 To the President Penna. Ilort. Society: — 

Since the October meeting of the IJociety, the fol- 
 lowing fruits have been forwarded to the Fruit Com- 
 mittee for examination: 

From P. H. Cassady, 29 Logan Square, through 
 Robert Kilvington, two varieties of Grapes. 

1. The Cassadi/ — A accidental seedling white 
 Grape, with native leaf, and dark purplish wood, that 
 sprung up in Mr. Cass;idy's yard in 1847, and fruited 
 in 1852 for the first time. Bunch, of medium size, 
 tolerably compact, and sometimes shouldered. Berry, 
 below medium, five-eighths of an inch in diameter; 
 form round; color, greenish white with occasionally 
 a faint salmon tint, and thickly covered with white 
 bloom;_^es/i, juicy with little pulp; yfatw, pleasant; 
 quality "very good." 

2. The Kilvington. — This may prove a known na- 
 tive variety. It was purchased by Mr. Cassady, 17 
 years ago, before it had fruited, for the Isabella, and 
 removed from Schuylkill Fourth andChestnut sts., to 
 its present locality in Logan Square. Bunch, medium, 
 compact. Berry, below medinm, five eighths of an 
 inch in diameter; _/brOT, round; color, red, a shade 
 deeper than the Catawba, with much bloom; seed, 
 unusually \a.rge; flesh, contains some pulp, which is 
 not tough, but half tender, and melting; /tooor, vin- 
 ous and saccharine without any Catawba aroma; 
 quality, "best." 

From Robert Iredell, Norristown, through Mr. 
 Jones. — A specimen of Duchesse d'AngouIeme of enor- 
 mous size, nearly five inches long by four and a 
 quarter broad, and weighing twenty-five and a 
 quarter ounces — exceeding in size any pear we have 
 ever seen grown in this country. Notwithstanding 
 its magnitude, we have never eaten a better flavored 
 Duchesse, — a variety, bj' the way, which, when fully 
 ripened, we regard in quality at least "very yood." 

From Mr. Eckcrt, Reading — Additional specimens 
 of the pear mentioned in the last "Ad Interim Re- 
 port" as being probably the Biurre Diel. They were 
 even larger than those previously received, and pos- 
 sessed a still more brilliant cheek and equally tine 
 flavor. 

From St. Louis County Missouri, through J. T. 
 Thomas, Esq. — Two Apples for their naynes. One 
 we recognized as the Vandiver; the other is probably 
 an apple of AVestern origin, with which we are un- 
 acquainted. 

From Ihomcis Thornihj, Fallstown, Beaver county, 
 Pennsylvania — A large lO'lrrtinn of Apples, exhibi- 
 ted at the State Fair at Pittsburg, and sent to us, by 

Mr. Thornily, at the request of some of our friends 
 who saw them on that occasion. But before they 
 came into our posossion, which was not until tlie 14t'h 
 of October, they had been exhibited at tlie Burling- 
 ton County Agricultural Fair at Mount Ilnlly and at 
 the Fair of the Philadelphia Society for pnnnoling 
 Agriculture. Some of us noticed them at both of 
 these Exhibitions, and were not a little surprised at 
 the size and beauty of many of the specimens, and 
 the great number of varieiies embraced in the collec. 
 Unfortunately, when we received them, the hand- 
 somest specimens had all disappeared; and the ex- 
 tensive collection had dwindled down to fourteen 
 sound apples, and nine in a state of decay. AVe were 
 therefore much disappointed in being prevented from 
 giving to so choice a collection the minute examina- 
 tion it so richly merited. Concerning it, however, 
 we may remark generally, that it indicated either a 
 peculiar pomological adaptation in the soil and cli- 
 mate of Beaver county, or extraordinary skill in 
 fruit culture, on the part of Mr. Thornily; — probably 
 both. 

From P. E. Freas, Esq., of the Germantown Tel- 
 egraph — Large and beautiful specimens of two varie- 
 ties of Pears. 

1. \icar of Winkfield or Monsieur le Cure — The 
 size, productiveness, and uniform bearing tendency 
 of this variety fully entitle it to be ranked in quality 
 "very good." 

2. Doyenne d' Hiver. — This name is gi\ en as a 
 synonyme of the Easter Beurre by the London 
 Ilorticultuial Society, and of the Easter Berga- 
 niot by Andrt! Leny, of Angers. The Easter 
 Beurre is a Winter Pear of the "best" quality when 
 properly ripened. It must be confessed, however, 
 that our knowledge of the pear ripening process, of 
 the Winter varieties, is exceedingly defective; and on 
 this account, it often happens that they fall short of 
 their intrinsic excellence, at their appropriate season 
 of maturity. 

From Col. Charles P. Belt, of the District of Colum- 
 bia — Specimens of Belts Hybrid Walnut. The liistory 
 and appearance of this unique and interesting hybrid 
 present unequivocal evidence that it isa natural cross 
 between the Butternut (Juglans Cinerea,) and the 
 English Walnut (Juglans Regia,) the latter being 
 the maternal parent. It originated about twenty 
 years ago at Chevy Chase, the residence of Col. Belt 
 near Washington, District of Columbia, from an En- 
 glish Walnut planted by his brother, Capt. Wm. I 
 Belt, late of the United States Navy. Capt. Belt pro- 
 cured the nut from an English Walnut tree in the 
 garden of Mrs. Bowie, of Prince George's County, 
 Maryland. AVithin a few I.undred yards of Mrs. 
 Bowie's residence, grew a number of Butternut trees 
 some of the pollen from the blossoms of which had 
 no doubt been wafted by the wind, or convej-ed by 
 insects to the English AValnut tree in the garden and 
 occasioned hybridism. After the nut had sprout- 
 ed. Col. Belt took it up and replanted it in the local- 
 ity it at present occupies. The tree is a vigorous 
 grower, and is represented as being exceedingly or- 
 namental. In 1852 it fruited for the first time and 
 in Scptemlicr of the same year, specimens of the nuts, 
 with the wood and foliage, were exhiliited by Mr. 
 Joshua Pierce, of AVashington, at the meeting of the 
 American Pomological Society, in Philadelphia. The 
 nut, in' its general appearance, differs very material- 
 ly from any others of the Juglans family: — size, large- 
 one and tlirce-fourths inches long, one and seven, 
 twelfths wide, and one thick, exilusivc of the remark- 
 able carena, elevated a fourth of an inch above the
