surface and estendinc; entirely around its longitudi- 
 nal cicumferance; form, ovate, pointed at its apex: 
 exterior surface, deeply and boldlj", but interrupted- 
 ly and irregularly siileated, without having the oon- 
 tinuous longitudinal furrows usually noticed in the 
 Butternut; color, light brownish yellow; kernel, fine. 
 Mr. Pierce has succeeded in two instances in graft- 
 ing this variety on the English Walnuf. What has 
 been the success of others to whom sci ns were sent, 
 we arc not informed. It is extremely difficult to graft 
 the Walnut in any of the ordinary ways. Owing to 
 the excitability of its buds, they are apt to push, and 
 exhaust the organiKable matter of the scion, before 
 its union with tlic stock can take place. This usual 
 cause of failure is obviated by working, as recom- 
 mended by the late President Knight, with the base 
 of the annual shoots, the buds of which are small 
 and but little developed. Another successful mode, 
 noticed in D'Albrct's recent work on grafting, is 
 to cleftgraft in the side of the young shoots, and is 
 said to answer well whether performed in the solid 
 or herbaceous state. In regard to the stock for 
 Belt's Hybrid, we would suggest the Butternut for 
 standards, and the Juglans Pra^parturiens for 
 dwarfs. 

From J. B. Garher, of Columbia, Pennsylvania — 
 Nine vareties of Apples, sent to him frotn Georgia. 
 These are the first apples we have received that were 
 grown in that State. Much attention, we understand, 
 is being paid at this time, by the Pomologists of Geor- 
 gia, to the raising of late kinds of this i'ruit. Those 
 that ripen with us in the winter, become, when trans- 
 ferred so far South, autumn varieties. This fact has 
 induced them to turn their attention to Southern 
 Seedlings. And we learn, that they have already 
 succeeded in originating a number of kinds, which 
 promise to be far better keepers, than tliose which 
 they had previously obtained from the North. We 
 are so much pleased with the appearance of those 
 sent to us by Mr. Garber, that we hope Mr. Richard 
 Peters, of Atlanta, or some of our other Georgia 
 friends will furnish us, at the proper season, with 
 other specimens for examination. Although those 
 we have received are not in a condition for testing, 
 wo deem them sufficiently interesting to merit a full 
 exterior pomological description, especially as most 
 (if them are entirely new to us. And if it should 
 prove from our descriptions, that we have not receiv- 
 ed the true varieties, we trust specimens that are 
 genuine will be forwarded to our Society. 

1. Limber Twig, or James Hirer. — This variety

 of Apples, eleven of which were grown in Berks 
 county, and eight near Dixon, Illinois: 

I. The Hiedleburg Pear — which was supposed to 
 be a foreign variety, we did not recognize till it was
