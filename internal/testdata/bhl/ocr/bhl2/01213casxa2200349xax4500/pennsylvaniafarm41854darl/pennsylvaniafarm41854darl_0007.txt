from almost black to pure white. In fact there is as 
 much difference between our old favorites and the «m- 
 proved Hollyhock, as between the unimproved specimen 
 of a cow in our last number and the delicate limbs and 
 amiable countenance of a modern Short-Horn; a compar- 
 ison which our lady readers will no doubt appreciate. 
 We have imported from Chater some of his prize plants, 
 which have bloomed finely in our grounds, and have also 
 raised a considerable number from selected English 
 seed, some of which have proved quite equal to the oth- 
 ers. We quote in another column an article from a re- 
 cent number of the London Gardeners' Chronicle, ex- 
 plaining fully their rearing and management. Our 
 choicest flowers have proved to be Obscura, lilac blossom; 
 Waldron Gem, dark red; Perfecta, pure white; Incom- 
 parable, light lilac, maroon centre, shaded with pink; 
 Bride, pure white, large flower; Lady Franklin, white, 
 (deep pink centre;) Kossuth, dark red, flower very large, 
 full centre; Madame Kossuth, maroon and white, three 
 feet high, very full and double; and about a dozen others 
 almost equally good.

Alderney Cows and James Gowen's Address. 
 We copy in another column from the New England 
 Farmer, a statement from Elijah M. Read, of Massachu- 
 setts, respecting the profitable yield of his imported Al- 
 derney cow. The editor of the New England Farmer 
 says, "it will be received by all who know him without 
 any grain of allowance." A large amount of similar 
 testimony can be given by others who, themselves, have 
 proved the excellence of the Alderney breed. AVhile 
 """Siey cannot be compared with the Durhams in many re- 
 spects, they have merits of their own, which, in certain 
 situations, and for certain purposes, will always make 
 ,. them valuable. As a general thing, more butter can be 
 ■^ made from their milk than from anj' other breed. The 
 "/'cows are kind and docile, keep in good condition on a 
 small amount of food, fatten very easily when off their 
 milk, aie fine in the bone, and of good form. Their 
 beef is also excellent. We speak of the "improved Al- 
 derney," not improved by crossing with another breed, 
 but by selecting the best specimens of their own, and 
 wliich after being pursued with great care and skill for 
 many years in their native Isle of Jersey, has resulted 
 in the present very desirable Jersey cow. As regards 
 their comparative value for the dairy, from the uncertain- 
 ty of scem-ing deep milkers from oth^v pure breeds, it is 
 not improbable, but very likely, that a herd of 30 Alder- 
 ney cows would make more butter, at less cost, in a 
 twelvemonth, than the same number of any other breed, 
 selected indiscriminately. We have been much siu*- 
 prised, as have been many others, on reading an address 
 by James Gowen, delived at the Mercer County Exhibi- 
 tion the present fall, to find some sweeping assertions 
 respecting this breed, entirely at variance with the posi- 
 tive knowledge of many farmers who have tried them. 
 From his mentioning the improved Alderney cow as 
 having been improved by a mixture with the other 
 breeds, and which would make her not an Alder- 
 ney at all, but something else, we infer he is not 
 aware of what has been done by scientific breeders in 
 her native island, through a course of years, to improve 
 her original form, and at the same time preserve tlio 

breed pure and distinct. No doubt some mongrel nrfn- 
 descript has been in his mind's eye, when he penned the 
 following: "In habit, constitution, size, milking and 
 feeding, the Alderney s are all unfit for a farmer." 
 "The cry is they give rich milk and make yellow butter, 
 so does almost every other hide bound, ricketty cow, 
 that may be picked up along the lanes or road side, give 
 rich or thick milk, chiefly because she gives so little, 
 and by consequence that little will make more cream 
 than a similar quantity would, of milk taken from a 
 twenty to a thirty quart a day cow." 

We have owned cows which gave very little milk, and at 
 the same time very thin milk. That the quality is ne- 
 cessarily rich from a small quantity is no more correct 
 than that it should be necessarily thin from a large 
 quantity, and it is a new idea to us that an old, ricketty, 
 hide boimd cow from the roadside and with perhaps a 
 scanty pittance of food hardly suflScient to support life, 
 should be cited as an instance of yielding rich milk. 
 From what is it secreted ? Deep milkers are generally 
 thin in flesh, but they require nourishing food and plen- 
 ty of it. A. fat cow in the period of deep milking is a 
 rare occurrence. J. Gowen also in another part of his 
 address says, "the Alderneys are such hard feeders, it 
 is impossible to get beef on them." We hope to hear 
 from some who have experience on this point as it is dif- 
 ferent from their general reputation. 

Chester County Beef and Fat Cattle. 

On recurring to the market reports of the prices of 
 Fat Cattle, at the yards of both New York and Phila- 
 delphia, any week in the year, it will be observed Chester 
 county fed beef always rates a little higher per 100 lbs. 
 than that from any other quarter, and it is a common 
 remark that the tenderest and most juicy ribs and sirloins 
 which grace the tables of the good livers in those cities, 
 are from Chester county. Pa. Our farmers expect to get 
 a little more for their fat cattle than the ordinary mar- 
 ket prices, and the Butchers are generally willing to give 
 it. The enquiry is often made, why is this ? Although 
 some of our best farmers occasionally raise and feed their 
 own cattle, yet the supply of what are called stock cattle, 
 generally comes from the west, Ohio, Indiana, and Il- 
 linois. These are brought into suitable parts of the 
 county, for sale in the fall of the year generally, when they 
 are bought up by the farmers, well wintered, sometimes 
 when in good order, stall fed, and the following season are 
 allowed to receive a good coat of Pennsylvania fat from 
 our rich pastures, being m.ade ready for the butcher in 
 from 9 to 12 months from the time they are first purchas- 
 ed. The cause of tlieir supei'iority may be owing first, 
 to their being well selected. Chester county farmers are 
 generally good judges of stock. They can see even in a 
 poor bullock, certaing fattening tendencies, and detect a. 
 disposition to lay it on in the proper places; they judge by 
 fineness of bone, good form, small .amount of offal, the 
 skin, and hair, and countenance, that an .animal will be 
 a quiet feeder, that its beef will be juicy, and well inter- 
 laded with fat, instead of a coarse, fibrous, and what is 
 called too fleshy a texture. This we think explains the 
 matter in part. Then again the quality of the pastures 
 is almost unrivalled. The Green Grass, (Poa Pratensis,)
