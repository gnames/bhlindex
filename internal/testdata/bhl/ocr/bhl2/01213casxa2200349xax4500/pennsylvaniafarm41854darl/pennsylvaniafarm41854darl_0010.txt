are unknown — observe the difforcnco in everytbing about 
 them; iu their fields, in their dwelliugs, orc-hard.s, f;;;rdons. 
 A person coming from the highly culdvatod fields of Eng- 
 land, or from tlio finer portions of Now York, or our own 
 South Eastern Counties, might find even among u^, some 
 very slow and awkwaril ways of doing things. He might see 
 some poor ploughs, and clumsy harrows. Ke raight tell of 
 a drilling machine at home, that would put iu more grain in 
 a day than could bo done by hand in two or three days, and 
 do it much better too; or of an implement that would cut 
 down more wheat, rye, oats, or grass in one day, with a cer- 
 tiiin number of hands, than twice the number could do in 
 twice the time in the ordinary way. He might tell of well 
 bred horses, more v.aluable than three or four common ani- 
 mals; or of an improved cow or bull, that he would not trade 
 for a whole herd of such peaked, scraggy creatures, as obtain 
 their winter's living from some of our farmer's dung piles.— 
 Now there is only one way to put an end to this bragging, 
 as far as we are concerned, and I think. Sir, we are fast com- 
 ing to it. I mean by this friendly strife, this emulation among 
 ourselves, to excel each other, in rearing animals, grain, 
 vegetables and fruit, and soon we shall be able to go into re- 
 gions more backward than our own, and make the same 
 brags that this progressive gentleman has been making to us.
