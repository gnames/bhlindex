thoretVom operate iu the same mauneras those of the autumn 
 previous. Those hirvio l)ocome pupas about the middle of 
 June. The Hies which lay thoir ogg.s in the spring are prob- 
 ably iu part from the pupa) which became such late in the 
 preceding autuiuu, and partly from the pupce contained in 
 stubble left the preceding summer. The period of the exis- 
 tence of the Hessian fly in the pupas or flax-seed state is ex- 
 ceedingly variable. After much observation my own opin- 
 ion is, that in general, pnpa3 which become such late in the 
 autumn, evolve the winged insect partly during the next 
 spring, and partly in the summer and autumn following. 
 Those pupaj which become such about June, evolve the 
 Tcinged insect partly during the next autumn and partly 
 during the year succeeding. 

AGPJCULTURE IN EUROPE. 

Lkipsic, 10th mo. 15th, 1853. 

To the Editor of the Farm Journal : â€” My first and 
 last letter was written to you from New York. So total- 
 ly ditFerent are ray circumstances now, from M'hat they 
 were then, that I fear I can establish no relation between 
 that letter and this one. 

Then, the indefinite idea of a trip across the Atlantic 
 was before me, and I was on the eve of starting. Now, 
 that ocean swells behind me, and I have found pleasant 
 quarters in this inland town, where I shall remain some 
 months to prosecute, among other things, the study of 
 the Science of Agriculture. There is a far better field 
 for the student of Agricultural Science on this side of 
 the Atlantic, than in the New World, not only because 
 it is made a distinct study in the highest Universities, 
 under the best Professors iu the world, but here, neces- 
 sity, the mother of invention, has obliged the husband- 
 man to economize all the resources of the farm, and try 
 every experiment to make the land produce, in order to 
 sustain existence. And still further, here are thou- 
 sands of acres, naturally barren, that only produce 
 through the application of such material as will improve 
 the soil. Hero we sec the cflforts of the agriculturist to 
 improve land that the Americans would allow to lay waste, 
 while he has his "back woods," or his California to go 
 to. Here the subject of agriculture has been made the 
 subject of investigation, by the greatest men of the 
 country, and the governments have patronized and en- 
 couraged them in their efforts. 

In the United States, we have hitherto given this sub- 
 ject but little attention ; the necessity of tiie case has 
 not demanded it : but as the man of wealth may learn 
 useful lessons in economy, from those who are pinched 
 vrith poverty, so, I trust, with all deference to my coun- 
 trymen, we may say, they can learn from the struggling 
 cflForts of the farmers of Europe. 

So far as I may be able, I shall endeavor to say some- 
 thing that may contribute to this purpose, by occasional 
 letters to your paper on the subject of Agriculture. 
 The farmer who lands iu the Old World, as I did iu Ham- 
 burg, will, by a walk into the country, see much that 
 will excite his curiosity, even if he look at nothing but 
 such things as relate to the farm. He will find notaing 
 to learn with respect to ordinary implements to work 
 with. 

They use the old fashioned iron forks, the wooden cog- 
 wheel Dutch fans, clumsy rakes, the flail, (that stands 
 in the same relation to American boys that a spinning 

wheel does to the girls, ) the low barns with thatched 
 roofs, and the house and barn under the same roof, with 
 only a partition between the cattle in one and the in- 
 mates of the other; indeed, in any thing that relates to 
 saving labor, or living in what an American would call 
 respeclable style, there is not much to be learned. The 
 peasantry are not able to live in very fine style, but 
 where things about a house in northern Germany do in- 
 dicate good taste in many things, still we find this asso- 
 ciation of men and animals under the same roof. But 
 around Lcipsic, and in the southern part of Germany, 
 this practice, I am told, does not exist. It forcibly re- 
 minds one of the old expression, "Every one to his no- 
 tion, as the old woman said when she kissed the cow." 
 She loved the cow. And the north Germans seem to 
 love their company. Labor saving machines are not 
 needed, as labor is so cheap as not to be worth saving, and 
 the consequence is every thing that labor can do to save 
 wood and iron and raise grain, is done, so that around 
 Hamburg is found the most luxuriant crops, the finest 
 grass, and on it the best of cows. The cows are re- 
 markably large, though still retaining that feminine ap- 
 pearance characteristic of good milkers. Our large 
 cows in the United States are too often of a long, mas- 
 culine form, that all good judges recognise as poor milk 
 cows. I spent one year in the Mohawk Valley, New 
 York, where butter and cheese making is carried on al- 
 most to the exclusion of every thing else, and almost 
 every farmer had 30 or 40 cows, but they were not near- 
 ly so large as the cows in the neigliborhood of the above 
 town. 

The butter and cheese that comes into Hamburg mar- 
 ket are said to be superior to any in Germany, and from 
 a week's residence in the town, I can testify to their 
 good qualities. Much care is taken of their cows; in 
 the absence of fences as often is the case they are 
 watched all the time. 

The most luxui-iant grass is often without a fence 
 around it, but no cattle run the road, and they are 
 guarded in the fields. 

The land is principally very fertile on the banks of the 
 Elbe, which are very low and of an alluvial character. 
 This appears to be the case up as far as Hamburg, but 
 the country northeast and east of this town has been 
 swept over by Avhat is known to geologists under the 
 name of drift, where hundreds of square miles present 
 sandy, gravelly plains, that arc very unproductive. In 
 many places the grass cannot get hold enough in the 
 soil to keep the wind from blowing the sand about, and 
 leaving the surface entirely bare, giving the country a 
 most desolate appearance, yet even here the farmer is 
 struggling with the soil for bread, and we see a great 
 many plans adopted to bring these barren lands under 
 cultivation. Many of them are planted over with pine 
 or fir trees, to raise timber from; so that the traveller of- 
 ten sees forests of planted trees, but every one stands in 
 the naked sand, and no plant or shrub of spontaneous 
 growth graces the soil, seeming to say with an obstinate 
 firmness, I will go no farther than I am driven. As we 
 proceed farther from the cities we find pine trees of na- 
 tural growth, but these come out of sandy piles that 
 seem to begrudge them existence. When the farmer 
 wants to bring in one of these sandy fields he either
