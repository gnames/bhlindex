N. B. — Several scientific societies in France and the 
 Philadelphia Society for Promoting Agricultui-e here, 
 have, after examination and the severest tests, reported 
 favorably of Guenon's s^ystem. Their reports are more 
 reliable than the mere ipse dixit of an individual.

STRAWBERRY QUESTION AGAIN. 

Cincinnati, Nov. 10, 1853. 

Editor of Farm Journal: — You err in saying that the 
 Strawberry question is by T. Meehan narrowed down 
 to a mere abstract point, whether under any circum- 
 stances a pistillate plant will produce staminate or her- 
 maphrodite blossoms? I agree with you, that this is the 
 only question, but not the only one Mr. Meehan makes. 
 He not only says that he can make the pure pistillate 
 Ilovey, bear staminate blossoms, but that this discovery, 
 makes "the distinction between staminates and pistillates 
 worthless, cultivation producing either one or other." If true, 
 has his discovery any bearing on the theory, of the cul- 
 tivation of the plant for fruit. Where was his judgment 
 ■wandering, when he made this strange declaration. You 
 err, in saying, that I came forward under my own signa- 
 ture, and gave up the whole case. What I said, was in 
 substance this. As my seedling hermaphrodite, and some 
 others, bear occasion.al blossoms, that &re purely pistil- 
 late, I doubt not that a seedling plant may be produced, 
 that bears an occasional staminate or hermaphrodite blos- 
 som. But I never have believed that a pure pistillate, 
 can by any change of cultivation, produce any but pure 
 pistillate blossoms. But I shall believe it when I see it, 
 but not till then. In the July No. of the Western Hor- 
 ticulturist, I said the contrary. I said, "unpleasant as 
 the duty is, they will in time be compelled not only to 
 admit the difference in the sexual character of the plants, 
 but that years of cultivation ■nail never change their char- 
 acteristics. You may as reasonably ask the same change 
 in the human family." Mr. Meehan thought he had made 
 this change in my new seedling, the Extra Red. The 
 blossoms I have never examined particularly. Mr. Gar- 
 diner, a friend of Mr. Meehan's, told me that he saw a 
 plant in my bed that had some staminate flowers. The 
 next spring he found it was a trespasser. In its wild 
 state, I have found all the variation in the sexes, that 
 ■we now have. David T. Disney, Esq., from the prairies of 
 lowQi, brought me staminates, pistillates, and Hermaphro- 
 dites. You say "if is admitted, that a bed of pistillates, 
 will not produce a full crop, without the presence of 
 staminates." What we say is, that it will not bear a 
 single jyerject hcrry. You are excusable if you deem that 
 Mr. i\Ieehan's changes may be true, as it would be rude 
 to your brother of the Prairie Farmer, as all his kinds 
 of pistillates, threw off their petticoats, and put on the 
 bloomer costume. 

N. LONGWORTH. 

As regards the above letter, from our friend N. Long- 
 worth, and its correspondence or agreement with his pre- 
 viously expressed opinion which we copied from the 
 Western Horticultural Review, we have nothing more to 
 say but merely place them in juxta position, side bj' side. 

We also in another column extract an article from the 

Horticulturist, by William Saunders, Baltimore, which 
 seems to eflfect at least, the possibilities of the case. 

N. Longworth in Horticultural Review says, "as Long- 
 worth's Prolific, which is hermaphrodite, produces a 
 chance pistillate blossom, I see no reason for saying that 
 there may not be a pistillate bearing an occasional Her- 
 maphrodite or staminate blossom." 

N. Longwortli in the above letter says, "But I never 
 have believed that a pure pistillate can, by any change 
 of cultivation, produce any but pure pistillate blos- 
 soms."

Report of the Committee on Dairies of the Chester Co., 

Agricultural Society. 

The committee appointed by the Agricultural Society of 
 Chester county, to award premiums for the best managed 
 Dairies, report. They have visited all the dairies for which 
 application has been made to us, by competitors for pre- 
 miums, and they have awarded to Samuel J. Dickey & Bro- 
 thers of Hopewell, the first premium; and to Dr. E V. Dick- 
 ey of Oxford Borough, the second premium. Tboy have 
 also awarded to Job Hayes of Newlin the first premium for 
 the manufacturing of butter and cheese combined in the 
 siune dairy. The committee could not with justice here close 
 their report, without giviug some of the details of the man- 
 agement of the dairies examined. The first place visited 
 was that of S. J. Dickey and Brothers; their Spring House 
 is situated over a never failing spring, built of brick, some 
 50 or 60 feet long, U wide, with a high story, all plaster- 
 ed, ceiled, white coated and washboarded; the bottom 
 being laid with bricks with platforms up the middle for a 
 walk. The wall is shelved around some three feet from the 
 bottom for the purpose of putting the milk pans on in Au- 
 tumn or cold weather. It is well ventilated by numerous win- 
 dows covered with a fine wire seive, which keeps out all the 
 small motes, and flies, so annoying to the dairy maid. The 
 Spring House is kept to a proper temperature in cold weather 
 by artificial heat. Adjoining the milk house, is the wash 
 house in which is every convenience for the accommodation of 
 the dairy maid, whose duties, by the by, are not enviable ones. 
 It being churning morning, we had a full opportunity of 
 witnessing her mode of manufacturing butter. In the first 
 place it was churned by one of Copes' 150 gallon churns, pro- 
 pelled by horse power. Out of this churn it was taken from 
 the butter milk, and put into one of E. J. Dickey's patent 
 butter workers, 25 lbs at a time. Here one of the committee 
 held his watch, and found the time occupied in working out 
 the butter milk thoroughly, and working in the salt, to be 
 two and a half minutes. They salt their butter by weight. It 
 is then taken out of the worker and put into a large wood- 
 en bowl, and left to stand until the s.alt is completely dissol- ^ 
 ved, it is then put into the worker again, and in less than 
 two minutes the brine and streaks .are completely worked 
 out. It is again taken out into the wooden bowl, weighed into 
 half pounds, then put into a mould by which thoy are prin- 
 ted into square pats with gre.at accuracy and despatch. It 
 is then packed into square tubs or boxes on shelves for the 
 Baltimore market. Each tub is accomp.anied by its pass 
 book in which are marked by the agent the sales of all the 
 butter; price per lb., <fcc. 

Their cow house is adjoining the barn some sixty or sev- 
 enty yards from the spring, in which their cows, some forty 
 in number, are tied by chains in stalls, except the unruly 
 ones. These are served like our convicts, put into the peni- 
 tentiary where thoy can be milked with gre.at safety. The 
 milk is then strained into two large cans and conveyed
