by railroad to the spring, where it is put into pans to cool. 

The next place worthy of notice was that of Dr. E. V. 
 Diekoy, who certainly deserves great credit for the manner 
 in which he has arranged every thing for the convenience of 
 his dairy. 

His buildings are very much like those of the first place 
 visited as is .also his manner of preparing the butter. Here 
 they had a chance of seeing some of the best kind of Chester 
 county bogs which ho was preparing for the Baltimore Ag- 
 ricultural exhibition. 

Their milking stock consists, principally of the New York 
 or Eastern cows, and containing a strong dash of Devon 
 blood. They are selected with great care, and the Messrs. 
 Dickey are trying to improve them by the introduction of 
 the Ayresbire and other improved broods. 

The following account taken from the pass book of Sam- 
 uel J. Dickey and Brothers, shows the butter made from Oct. 
 1st 1852, to Oct. 1st 1S53, to be 5,990 lbs., which was sold in 
 the Baltimore market for an average of thirty-one and three- 
 quarter cents per pound, from which deduct four and a quar- 
 ter cents for commissions, freight and hauling, and it leaves 
 the net price twenty-seven and a half cents. The account 
 then will stand thus for the year.

The attention of the committee was then directed to the 
 farm of Job Hays; here are made some of the finest cheese 
 in the Stute. The question being asked how he acquired the 
 art of making so fine an article, — the answer given was that 
 Mrs. Job Hayes brought that art with her. It certainly is 
 an art that every dairyman ought to know and practice in 
 the same manner. His practice is to make Cheese in the 
 flush season when the market is overstocked, and butter low. 
 If dairymen would generally adopt this plan, they would be 
 able to to benefit themselves and realize a much hand- 
 somer profit on their dairies than they usually do. The 
 materials to make one pound of butter, will make two and a 
 half pound of cheese worth, generally from llj to 12 cents 
 per lb.

Cutting. The proper season for cutting basket willows is 
 the autumn, immediately after the fall of the leaf. The ad- 
 vantage of cutting at this season is, that the buds, which are 
 left to produce the shoots for the succeeding crop, immediately 
 begin to swell, and grow in strength during the winter, and, 
 consequently, they make much earlier and stronger shoots 
 the following spring. Immediately after cutting the rods, 
 they are tied up in bundles, each generally about 3 feet 9 
 inches in girt, and if they are not intended to be used with the 
 bark on, they are set on their thick ends in standing water 
 to the depth of 3 or 4 inches. Here they remain during the 
 Winter and Spring, till shoots begin to sprout, when they 
 are ready to be peeled. 

The operation of Peclimj is very simple and is commonly 
 done by infirm or old men or women, at so much a bundle. 
 The apparatus for peeling consists of two round rods of irou, 
 nearly i an inch thick, 1 foot 4 inches long, and tapering a 
 little upwards, welded together, one end of which is sharp- 
 ened, so that the instrument may be easily thrust down into 
 the ground. When the instrument is inserted in a piece of 
 firm ground, the peeler sits down opposite to it, takes the 
 willow twig in his right hand by the small end and puts a 
 foot or more of the thick end into the instrument, the prongs 
 of which he presses together with his left hand, while with 
 his right he draws the willow towards him; by which opera- 
 tion the bark will at once bo separated from the wood, the 
 small end is then treated in the same manner, and the peeling 
 is completed. (Sang.) Another mode is, to fix a i)lank on 
 legs at a convenient length, so as to form a stool, or small 
 bench, having holes bored in it with .in inch auger, into 
 these is put a stick, the upper end of which is cleft; and 
 through this cleft the twl:;s are drawn, to separate themfrom 
 the bark, in the same manner as through the iron rods, 
 (Mitch. Dend., p. 60.) After being peeled, the rods will 
 keep in good condition for a long time, till a proper market 
 is found for them. It may be useful here to remark, that 
 Osiers in the peeled state will keep better to wait a market, 
 than if left with the bark on: and that they never fail to 
 produce a greater return in the peeled state, after paying for 
 labor of peeling, than they do when sold immediately after 
 they are cut from the stools. (Plant Kal.) In Germany, and 
 also frequently in Scotland, the willows, after being cut and 
 tied up in bolts, are stacked, or kept in an airy shed; and, 
 when the bark is to be removed, it is efi"ected by boiling or 
 steaming them. The rods, thus prepared, are considered to 
 be rather more durable than when the bark is separated in 
 consequence of the rising of the sap: and they may bo used 
 immediately after cutting, instead of remaining in a useless 
 state for several months. (.Arboretum et Fruticetum Brittani- 
 cum.) 

To enumerate all the important information connected with 
 this subject in the above mentioned valuable work, to give 
 the beautiful drawings and plates of the different species of 
 Willow and insects injurious thereto; and even the method 
 of manufacture with beautiful illustrations, would require 
 several whole numbers of your valuable journal. Therefore 
 let me urge the propriety of its careful study by every one 
 who contemplates the profitable culture of this, apparently 
 very valuable crop. J- K- E.
