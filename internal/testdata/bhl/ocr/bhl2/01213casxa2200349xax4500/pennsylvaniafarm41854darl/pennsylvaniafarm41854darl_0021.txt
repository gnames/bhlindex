or a disposition to engage in any useful employment. Speak- 
 ing from our own youth recollection, wo are free to say that 
 taper fingers and lily white hands are very pretty to look at 
 â€¢with a j'oung man's eyes, and sometimes we have known the 
 artless innocence of practical knowledge displayed by a 
 young Miss to appear rather interesting than otherwise. 
 But we have lived long enough to learn that life is full of 
 ruggod experiences, and that the most loving, romantic and 
 delicate people must live on cooked or otherwise prepared 
 food and in homes kept clean and tidy by industrious 
 hands. And for all the practical purposes of married life, it 
 is generally found that for the husband to sit and gaze at a 
 wife's taper fingers and lily hands, or for a wife to sit and 
 be looked at and admired, does not make the pot boil, or 
 put the smallest piece of food therein. 

THE HUSKERS. 

It was late in mild October, and the long autumnal rain 
 Had left the summer harvest-fields all green with grass 

again ; 
 The first sharp frost had fallen, leaving all the woodlands 

gay 
 With hues of summer rainbows, or the meadow flowers of 
 May. 

Through a thin dry mist that morning, the sun rose broad 

and red. 
 At first a rayless disc of fire, he brightened as he spread ; 
 Yet even his noontide glory fell chastened and subdued, 
 On the cornfield, and the orchards, and softly pictured wood. 

And .all that quiet afternoon, slow sloping to the night, 
 He wove with golden shuttles the haze with yellow light ; 
 Slanting through the painted beeches, he glorified the hill; 
 And beneat-h it, pond and meadow laybrighter, greener still. 

And shouting boys in woodland haunts caught glimpses of 

that sky. 
 Flecked by the many tinted leaves, and laughed they knew 

not why ; 
 And school-girls, gay with aster flowers, beside the meadow 

brooks. 
 Mingled the glow of autumn with the sunshine of sweet 

looks. 

From spire and barn looked westerly the patient weather- 
 cocks; 

But even the birches on the hill stood motionless as rocks; 

No sound was in the woodlands, save the squirrel's dropping 
 shell. 

And the yellow leaves among the boughs low rustling as 
 they fell. 

The summer grains were harvested, the stubble fields lay 

dry. 
 Where June winds rolled in light and shade, the pale green 

waves of rye; 
 But still on gentle hill-slopes, in valleys fringed with wood, 
 Ungathered, bleaching in the sun, the heavy corn crop stood. 

Bent low by autumn's wind and rain, through busks that dry 

and sere. 
 Unfolded from their ripened charge, shone out the yellow 

ear; 
 Beneath the turnip lay concealed in many a verdant fold. 
 And glistened in the slanting light, the pumpkin's sphere of 

gold. 

There wrought the busy harvesters, and many a creaking 
 wain. 

Bore slowly to the long barn floor, ita load of husk and 
 grain ; 

Till broad and red as when he rose, the sun sank down at 
 last, 

And like a merry guest's farewell the day in brightness pas- 
 sed. 

And lo! as through the western pines on meadow stream 

and pond. 
 Flamed the rod radiance of a sky set all on fire beyond; 
 Slowly o'er the eastern sea-bluffs a milder glory shone. 
 As the sunset and the moon-rise were mingled into one. 

And thus into the quiet night the twilight lapsed away. 
 And deeper in the brightening moon the tranquil shadows 
 lay; 

From many a brown old farm-house and hamlet without 

name. 
 Their milking and their home-tasks done, the merry buskers 

came. 

Srning o'er the heaped up harvest, from pitchforks in the 
 mow. 

Shone dimly down the lanterns on the pleasant scenes be- 
 low ; 

The growing pile of husks behind, the golden ears before. 

And laughing eyes and busy hands, and brown cheeks glim- 
 mering o'er. 

Half hidden in a quiet nook, serene of look and heart, 

Talking their old times over, the old men sat apart; 

While up and down the unhusked pile, or nesting in its 

shade, 
 At hide-and-seek, with laugh and shout, the happy children 

played. 

Ui'ged by the good hosts's daughter, a maiden young and 

fair. 
 Lifting to light her sweet blue eyes, and pride of soft brown 

hair; 
 The master of the village school, sleek of hair and smooth 

of tongue. 
 To the quaint old tune of some old psalm, a husking ballad 

sung. 

Heap high the farmers's wintry hoard! 

Heap high the golden corn ! 
 No richer gift has autumn poured 

From out her lavish horn! 
 Let other lands exulting, glean 

The apple from the pine. 
 The orange from its glossy green, 

The cluster from the vine. 

We better love the hardy gift 

Our rugged vales bestow. 
 To cheer us when the storm shall drift 

Our harvest fields with snow. 
 Through vales of grass and meads of flowers 

Our ploughs their furrows made. 
 While on the hills the sun snd showers 

Of changeful April played. 

We dropped the seed o'er hill and plain 

Beneath the sun of May, 
 And frightened from our sporting grain 

The robber crows away. 

All through the long bright days of June, 

Its leaves grew green and fair. 
 And waved in hot midsummer's noon 

Its soft and yellow hair. 

And now with autumn's moonlit eves. 

Its harvest time has come, 
 We pluck away the frosted leaves, 

And bear the treasure home. 

There richer than the fabled gift 

Apollo showered of old, 
 Fair hands the broken grain shall sift, 

And knead its yellow gold. 

Let vapid idlers loll in silk 

Around their costly board, 
 Give us the bowl of samp and milk 

By homespun beauty poured. 

Where'er the wide old kitchen hearth 

Sends up its smoky curls, 
 Who will not thank the kindly earth. 

And bless our farmer girls! 
 Then shame on all the proud and vain, 

AVhoso folly laughs to scorn 
 The blessings of our hardy grain, 

Our wealth of golden corn! 
 Let earth withhold her goodly root, 

Let mildew blight the rye, 
 Give to the worm the orchard's fruit. 

The wheat-field to the fly. 

But let the good old crop adorn 

The hills our fathers trod, 
 Still let us for this golden corn, 

Send up our thanks to God! WHrrriBR.
