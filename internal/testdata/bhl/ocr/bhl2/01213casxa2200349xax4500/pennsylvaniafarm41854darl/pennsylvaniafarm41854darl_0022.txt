THE THRIFTY FARMEE. 

The Provident and thrifty Farmer, adopts three rules 
 for regulating his business, which he observes himself 
 and enforces on those around him, viz: to do every 
 thing in the right time, convert every thing to its proper 
 use, and put every thing in its proper place. 

He buys only the improved breeds of cattle, horses, 
 sheep and swine, and keeps no more than he can keep 
 well, either in summer or winter. 

He alwaj's drives on his work and never lets his work 
 drive him. 

His animals are never under fed or over worked. 

His outhouses, Woodshed, Poultry House, Pig Pen, 
 Wagon House, Spring House, and Corn Crib are nicely 
 whitewashed on the outside, and kept clean and neat 
 within. 

He has a tool house, and a place for every tool in it, 
 which may be wanted for any ordinary farm purposes, 
 such as mending implements, making axe or hoe or fork 
 liandlos, &c., and also for stowing carefully away, such 
 as will not be wanted for another season. 

He has sheds around his barnyard, to protect his cattle 
 from the weather, and warm well ventilated stables for 
 his cows and young stock, and also a shed, to protect his 
 manure heap. 

He has leaves or other refuse vegetable matter, to- 
 gether with soil from his headlands, convenient to his 
 barn yard, to compost with his manure heap, through 
 the winter. 

He does not allow the liquid manure to escape into 
 the nearest stream, a quarter or half a mile from liis 
 barnyard. 

His barn, and sheds, and dwelling, are all supplied 
 with good spouting. 

His fences are .always in good order, and materials for 
 repairing or renewal, are collected and made during win- 
 ter. 

His woodshed is supplied with wood cut in August, 
 always one year ahead. 

His wife never scolds, because she never has occasion 
 to. 

Her cellar and pantry, are always supplied with the 
 needful raiv material, which she works up into a palata- 
 ble form to fill up vacuums at meal times. 

Heavy bread, cold buckwheat cakes, and rancid butter 
 are novelties which her gude man and the children have 
 heard tell of by some of the neighbors, but have never 
 seen. 

When a friend or two calls to lodge, a plate of good ripe 
 Rambo apples, a pitcher of sweet cider, and a dish of 
 boiled chesnuts, are brought for discussion around the 
 stove of an evening. 

He is a subscriber to the Pennsylvania Farm Journal, 
 and his county newspaper, pays his subscription regular- 
 ly, has a club formed in his neighborhood, the money 
 for which he collects and forwards to the publisher, at 
 the close of each vohime. 

He considei's it a duty to promote the circulation of 
 Agricultural papers, and has saved himself some hun- 
 dreds of dollars by following the advice of the Farm 
 Journal. 

His crops are always equal, and often better than any 
 in the neighborhood, and are kept clear of weeds. 

He watches the markets, and sells his crops at the 
 highest prices. 

He makes it a rule always to spend a little less th.an 
 he makes. 

Himself and wife are both industrious, the children 
 are brought up in the same way, and are not allowed to 
 shoot the birds, smoke cigars or chew tobacco. 

He buys and sells on the cash principle, and thus saves 
 himself from losses and bad debts. 

He has a large fruit orchard, well supplied v.ith every 
 variety of fruit to ripen in succession. 

He studies the theori/ as well as the practice of farm- 
 ing, has cleared off the la?t $100 of mortgage, and is se- 
 riously talking of making a bid for his neighbor Sloven's 
 farm which is up at Sheriffs sale. 

He goes to church on the Sabbath, minds his religious 
 duties, and brings up his children to do the same, lives 
 respected, and dies rogi-ettcd, as a useful man and good 
 christian.
