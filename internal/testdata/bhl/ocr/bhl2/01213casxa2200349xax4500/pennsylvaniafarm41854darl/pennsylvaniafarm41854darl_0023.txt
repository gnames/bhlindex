THE TKRIFTLESS FARMER. 

The Fort Wayne Times gives the following life-like 
 portrait of a "thriftless farmer :" 

The thriftless farmer provides no shelter for his cattle 
 during the inclemency of the winter; but permits them 
 to stand shivering by the side of a fence, or lie in the 
 snow, as best suits them. 

He throws their fodder on tne ground, or in the mud, 
 and not unfrequently in the highway; by which a large 
 portion of it, and all the manure is wasted. 

He grazes his meadows in fall and spring, by which 
 they are gradually exhausted and finally ruined. 

His fences are old and poor — just such as to let his 
 neighbor's cattle break into his field, and teach his own 
 to be luiruly and spoil his crops. 

He neglects to keep the manure from around the sills 
 of his barn — if he has one — by which they are prema- 
 turely rotted, and his barn destroyed. 

He tills, or skims over the surface of his land, until it 
 is exhausted, but never thinks it worth while to manure 
 or clover it. For the first, he has no time, for the last, 
 he "is not able." 

He has a place for nothing, and nothing in its place. 
 He consequently wants a hoe or a rake or a hammer, or 
 an augur, but knows not where to find them, and thus 
 loses much time. 

He loiters away stormy days and evenings wlien he 
 should be repairing his utensils, or improving his min i 
 by reading useful books or newspapers. 

He spends much time in town, at the corner of the 
 street, or in the "snake holes," complaining of hard 
 times, and goes home in the evening, "pretty well 
 tore." 

He has no shed for his fire wood — consequently his 
 Vife is out of humor, and his meals out of .^eason. 

He plants a few fruit trees, and his cattle forthwith 
 destroy them. He "has no hick in raising fruit." 

One-half the little he raises is destroyed by his own or 
 his neighbors' cattle. 

His plow, drp.g, raid other implements, lie all v,-inter in 

the field where last used; and just as he is getting in a 
 hurry, the next season, his plow breaks, because it was 
 not housed and properly cared for. 

Somebody's hogs break in, and destroy his garden, be- 
 cause he had not stopped a hole in the fence, that he had 
 been intending to stop for a week. 

He is often in a great hurry, but will stop and talk as 
 long as he can find any one to talk with. 

He has, of course, little money ; and when he must 
 raise some to pay his taxes, &c., he raises it at a great 
 sacrifice, in some way or other, by paying an enormous 
 shave, or by selling his scanty crop when prices are 
 low. 

Ha is a year behind, instead of being a year ahead of 
 his business — and always will be. 

When he pays a debt, it is at tlie end of an execution ; 
 consequently his credit is at a low ebb. 

He buys entirely on credit, and merchants and all otli- 
 ei's with whom he deals charge him twice or thrice the 
 profit tliey charge prompt paymasters, and are unwilling 
 to sell him goods at any cost. He has to beg and promise, 
 and promise and beg, to get them on any terms. The 
 merchants dread to see his Avifo come into their stores, 
 and the poor Avoman feels depressed and degraded. 

The smoke begins to come out of his chimney late of a 
 winter's morning, while his cattle are suffering for their 
 moi-ning's feed. 

Manure lies in heaps in his stable ; his horses are 
 rough and uncurried, and his liarness trod imder their 
 feet. 

His bars and gates are broken, his buildings vmpaint- 
 ed, and the boards and shingles falling off" — he has no 
 time to replace them — the glass i.s out of the -nindows, 
 and the holes stopped with r.ngs and old hats. 

He is a great borrower of his tlirifty neighbor's imple- 
 ments, but never returns the borrowed article, and when 
 it is sent for. it can't be found. 

He is, in person, a great ploven, and never attends pub- 
 lic worship, or if he docs occasionally do so, he comes-- 
 .sneaking in wh.en the service is half out.
