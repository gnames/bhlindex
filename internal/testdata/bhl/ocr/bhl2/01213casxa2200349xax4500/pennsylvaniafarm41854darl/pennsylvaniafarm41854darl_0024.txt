 THE PECAN NUT. 

I beg le.ave to invite the attention of nurserymen and far- 
 mers, in this! region, t^ tho practicability of cultivating the 
 Pecan, or Illinois Hickory, — the fruit of which is well 
 known in our cities by tho name of Pecan Nut, and is gen- 
 erally esteemed as being equal, if not superior in quality, to 
 the best variety of the celebrated SJiellbark Hiclcnri/ Nut. 

The earliest notice which I find of the Pecan Nut is in a 
 letter from Peter Colunson to John Bartram, dated Lon- 
 don, April 1, 1762, acknowledging tho receipt of some of the 
 nuts, as follows : — "I really believe my honoet John is a 
 great tcug, and has sent seven hard, stony seeds, something 
 shaped like an acorn to puzzle us ; for there is no name to 
 them. I have avast collection of seeds, but none like them. 
 I do laugh at GordoSI [an eminent nurseryman of that day] 
 for ho guesses them to be a species of Hickory.* Perhaps 
 I may bo laughed at in tiirn, for I think they may bo, what 
 I wish, seeds of the Bondiic tree [Gymnocladua Canadensis, 
 Lam. or Kentucky Coffee Bean], which thou picked up in 
 thy rambles on the Ohio." In a subsequent letter, dated 
 October 5, 1762, Peter Collixson says : — "I wish thou 
 could get more of the hard nuts of Colonel Bouquet. If 
 they are Hickories, they are very different from what thou 
 hast sent, or what I have ever seen." 

Humphry Marshall, in his interesting little work on 
 the Forest Trees and Shrubs of America, published in 17S5, 
 refers to the- tree by the name of Jwjlans Pecan, or 
 Illinois Hickory. Aiton, in bis Hortus Kewcnsis, published 
 in 1789, calls it Jucjlans ancjusiifolia, without at all noticing 
 Marshall (as was usual with supercilious Europeans in 
 those days), and mentions that the tree was introduced into 
 England by Messrs. Kennedy & Lee, in 1766. Gaertner 
 ■called it Jnylans rubra. La Marck named it Juglans cylin- 
 drica; and MiCHAUX & "Willdenow described it under the 
 more significant name of Jtujlans olivmformis. Nuttall, in 
 1818, separated the Hickories from the Genus Juglans (or 
 "Walnuts proper), and gave to the Hickories the generic 
 name of Carya. The Pecan Nut belongs to the true Hicko- 
 ries ; and tho Botanical name of tho tree, as now establish- 
 ed, is Carya olivffformin, or olive-shaped Carya. 

John Bartram and Humphry Marshall each intro- 
 duced tho tree into their respective Botanic gardens many 
 years since : but the one at Marshallton has always been so 
 crowded and overshadowed by larger trees, that it is a poor 
 dwindled specimen; and although the one in the Bartram 
 Garden has become a considerable tree, promising annually 
 to yield fruit, yet I understand it rarely, if ever, matures or 
 perfects the nuts. 

This circumstance has given rise to the opinion that the 
 climate, in this latitude, is unpropitious to the culture of the 
 Pecan Nut, and has discouraged many amateur cultivators 
 from making the attempt. I am happy, however, to be able 
 to state (what has but recently come to my knowledge), that 
 -Mr. Hiram Baily, of Dilworthstown, has succeeded in ob- 

*GoRDON made decidedly the best guess; for those "stony 
 ■seeds" were the nuts of the Pecan Hickory. In reply to 
 Peter's remarks, John Bartram says : — "The hard nuts I 
 •eent were given me at Pittsburg by Col. Bouquet. He 
 called them hickory nuts. He had them from the country 
 of the Illinois.. Their kernel was very sweet." 

taining perfect fruit from a tree of his own raising. He 
 brought some nuts from New Orleans, in February, 1828, 
 and planted them in a flower pot, whore they vegetated, 
 and remained one year. Two of these seedlings were then 
 set out in tho open ground, at tho place of Mr. B.'s former 
 residence, in tho townsliip of Thornbury, some 5 or 6 miles 
 south-easterly from tho borough of West Chester. 

At tho time of their removal, the stems of tho seedlings 
 were only a fow inches in height ; but tho tap root of each 
 was several times longer than the stem. The young trees 
 grew well ; are now from 15 to 20 feet high, and the stems 
 about 5 or 6 inches in diameter at base. I understand one of 
 these trees has not yet, or not always, fully perfected or matu- 
 red its fruit ; but that the other has, for several years, been 
 producing perfect nuts, in proof of which, a number of young 
 trees have boon raised from them. This last mentioned 
 tree, indeed, bidH fair to be quite prolific, — the nuts often 
 coming to perfection in clusters of five at tho ends of the 
 branches, — as I have had occasion to witness the present 
 season. 

The result of Mr, Baily's experiment with tho Pecan 
 Hickory seemed to me worthy to bo made known; and I 
 would suggest that our nurserymen should begin to raise 
 tho trees, and that our farmers (especially the enterprising 
 young farmers.) should plant a few in favorable situations. 
 It is very possible that seedling trees may gradually become 
 so well acclimated among us as constantly to produce perfect 
 fruit. This being the season to procure fresh nuts from tho 
 south, as well as the proper time to plant them, they may, 
 doubtless, be readily obtained from their most northern in- 
 digenous localities, and also at tho fruit stores in the city of 
 Philadelphia. W. D.

Super Phosphate of Lime, 

MfiSSHS. Editors :-"In the number for this month, (Dec.) 
 directions are given for preparing the Super-Phosphate of 
 Lime, taken from the American Agriculturist, and as I have 
 had some experience in the preparation of this valuable 
 fertilizer, and as I flatter myself, have arrived at results 
 of some importance, I will give you my mode, which upon 
 trial I think will be found to possess many advantages. 

In the preparation of the soluble Super-Phosphate from 
 the insoluble Phosphate of Lime, a state in which it always 
 exists in nature, these facts seem clearly as established. 
 The first is that one-third of sulphuric acid, known as oil 
 of vitriol, of proper specific gravity is needed. The sec- 
 ond fact is, that this acid should be diluted with throe 
 times its bulk of water, otherwise it will charr instead of 
 dissolve the bone. The third is, that the finer tho bone 
 is ground or crushed, the more readily and perfectly the 
 compound will be found. These facts being settled, the la- 
 mented Norton, Dr. Higgins, our own State Chemist, and 
 some others, direct that the acid, as above diluted, should 
 be added to the bone by degrees, agitating tho mass fre- 
 quently for ten days or two ireeks, at tho expiration of 
 which time, the compound would be ready for use. As 
 this is a tedious and laborious process, I have sought to 
 supply its place by another and less objectionable one, 
 and have succeeded in a manner which I shall now give, 
 and which, as you will see, is so simple as to be accessi- 
 ble to all. 

I procure tubs of a capacity and number to suit the 
 amount of Super-Phosphate I wish to prepare, common 
 meat tubs answering the purpose perfectly well. Into 
 these I place my bones, carefully moistening them with, 
 water as I fill up the tubs, in which condition I permit,
