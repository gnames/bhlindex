order to do well. I should recommend throe apartments in 
 the box, two below, one to sleep, the other for their evacua- 
 tions. A square, thin board over the whole, resting on four 
 cleats, forming the upper story, about six inches high, a few 
 wires in front, to give air to each apartment, with a draw 
 trough in front, behind the wire, for food and water, this be- 

g necessary, on account of the straw being continually 
 cut up in small bits troubles them about eating, and some- 
 times fastens in across the roof of the mouth. Care should 
 be taken when the female has young, or suckling, that she 
 supplies her young, or is able, as they have been found dead 
 in the nest, inadequate to supply their young, it being natur- 
 al fur the female to hunt up prey and supply the defioienej'. 
 They have been known, when they had not sufficiency of 
 milk, to bring out their young, one by one, to their bread 
 and milk, taking back one and bringing out another, seeing 
 to it at the same time, that they did not take too much. The 
 first female I had, tried to carry dish, milk and all, in tohar 
 young. 

They are slow breeders, having one litter a year, from 
 about two to six or eight — rarely two litters a year. Thoy 
 are pregnant about six weeks, and the young are blind near- 
 ly as long, but not helpless. 

When used for hunting, it might be advisable to feed them 
 but little or nothing in the morning if they do not hunt 
 readily, at the same time not to over-work thon without 
 food. Two hundred dollars have been offered in Cleveland 
 for a single pair. Yours truly, John Gibbs. — Ohio Farmer. 

Culture of the HoUyliock. 

The soil most suitable for the growth of this noble early 
 autumn flower is a very rich sandy loam ; but it thrives well 
 in any good rich garden soil. Previous to planting, the 
 earth should be trenched at least two feet deep, and liberal- 
 ly mixed with well decomposed manure. If autumn plant- 
 ing is preferred, it should be done early, in order to allow 
 the roots to get established before severe frosts set in ; but 
 plants turned out in March bloom quite as early and equal- 
 ly well as those planted in autumn, the plants having been 
 kept growing throughout the winter. Care should be taken 
 that they receive frequent waterings during dry weather, 
 and a plentiful supply of liquid manure during the growing 
 season ; the earth should also be frequently loosened around 
 the roots. When the plants have thrown up spikes about 6 
 inches high, the latter should be thinned out, leaving not 
 more than three spikes on a strong plant, and on weak 
 plants, not above one, staking each spike separately when 
 about 16 or 18 inches high. To obtain fine blooms, all lat- 
 terals should be cut away, and the flower-buds thinned out 
 if too much crowded. The Hollyhock is in its beauty in 
 the mouth of August ; but a succession of bloom may be ob- 
 tained until about the end of October by later planting. 
 Immediately after the blooming season, it is advisable to cut 
 the old flowering stems from the plants about six inches 
 from the ground ; and in October or early in November to 
 earth up the crown with silver or road sand, which prevents 
 too much moisture getting to the roots during the winter 
 months. An occasional sprinkling of soot and quick-lime 
 ■ ehould be given to destroy slugs, which are the greatest ene- 
 my of this flower, and all decayed leaves should be picked 
 off to prevent rot. Early seed will produce young plants the 
 same autumn in which it is gathered ; it should be sown in 
 pans in light sandy soil, and plunged in a frame with gentle 
 bottoi5i heat. The mould should be moist at the time of 
 Bowing, and not watered until after the second knaves are 
 formed ; when strong enough, the plants should be trans- 
 planted into small pots, put into a close frame for a few days 
 and when established hardened off. They should then be 
 transferred to a cold frame, giving plenty of air in favorable 
 weather through the winter, and in the month of March or 
 April turned into the open ground for blooming. Late gath- 
 ered may be sown in the open ground in May or June, in 
 rows or drills ; it will only require hoeing and thinning, and 
 may remain for blooming. This plant may also be propa- 
 gated by dividing the old roots, which is best done in autumn, 
 taking care to leave plenty of root with each division. The 
 best blooming plants are raised from cuttings, which maybe 
 taken from the crown of the old root, when the shoot is about 
 an inch long, in the month of April or May, or by single eyes 
 from wood shodts in .July and August, taking care that the 
 bark is suflieiently hard, but not pithy. The cutting should 
 be potted singly in small pots ; the eyes placed five or six 
 round a 3-inch pot, in a light and very sandy loam, plunged 

in a close frame, with a little bottom-heat, very sparingly 
 watered, giving air every day fur a short time, to exclude 
 damp, and carefully picking oti all decayed leaves. In about 
 three weeks they will mostly be rooted, and should be im- 
 mediately potted ; when well established, they should be 
 hardened off, and kept in a cool airy frame until thej^ are 
 transferred to the open ground for blooming. — Gardeners

To Increase the Size of Fruit. 

Supporting Fruit a Ifeaut of Increasing its Size. — For the 
 last few 3'oars I have taken considerable interest in horticul- 
 tunil pursuits, and during that time I have, from observa- 
 tion and a series of trials, ascertained that all sorts of fruits 
 can be raised about one third larger than they usually arc, 
 and their qtialities much improved, simply by supporting 
 the fruit in the following manner : As soon as it is fully 
 developed, it should not be allowed to hang its weight upon 
 its stalk, as the increasing weight strains the stalk, and in 
 that way, lessens the quantity of nutritious fluid flowing to 
 the fruit. This may bo obviated in some cases, by laying 
 the Pear, Apple, orAvhatever it may be, upon the branch and 
 fixing it with a piece of matting, to prevent its being moved 
 by the wind ; or by putting it into a small net, made for the 
 purpose, at the same time keeping the stalk in a horizontal 
 position when it can be done v/ithuut twisting or bending it 
 — as the bending, either accidontally or by weight of the 
 fruit, is, in my opinion, most injurious to its growth ; for the 
 pores of the woody stalk are strained on one side of the bend 
 and compressed on the other, hence the vessels through 
 which the requisite nourishment flows being thus partially 
 shut up, the growth of the fruit is retarded in proportion to 
 the straining and compressing of the stalk. The fixing of 
 the fruit also prevents the risk of its falling ofi" and getting 
 damaged before it reaches maturity. I have grown Dahlias 
 upon the same principle, and with similar success, and I 
 have no doubt that the most of flower blooms, especially 
 those which are weighty and inclining, can be grown much 
 larger by the sj'stem referred to, and, in short, all sorts of 
 vegetables, trees, <tc. Shotild you deem this worthy of in- 
 sertion, it maj' be the means of attracting the attention of 
 parties more able than myself to carry out the principle of 
 support, which I conceive to be invaluable to everything in 
 the vegetable and animal kingdom. James Dohhie Dunsc.

Consumption in PhiladelpMa. 

The Philadelphia Sun says : As a result of the advanta- 
 ges enjoyed by our citizens on the occasion of Thanksgiv- 
 ing Days, we subjoin the following statistics of the amount 
 of articles consumed on Thursilay, which we have carefully 
 collected : 375 barrels of superfine flour, used in various 
 w.iys ; 169 bushels of potatoes, baked, roasted, boiled, Ac; 
 652 turkeys, 456 of which were roasted, and upon 
 which 25 small sacks of salt were used, and about 14 l):s. 
 of pejiper; 459 chickens, cooked in various ways: 396 ducks, 
 variously prepared; 261.021 pounds of butter; 260,000 lbs. 
 of cheese ; 572 pound cakes; 291,500 loaves of bread ; 450 
 roasting pigs ; and there were only 160 salt mackerel. — 
 There were also drank 161,221 gallons of coff'ee, in v.^hich 
 were used nearly the same number of quarts of milk ; 760 
 gallons of champagne ; 300 gallons of brandy ; and in the 
 district of Moyamensing alone there were drank 621 gal- 
 lons of whiskey; 760 casks of lager beer, and other liquors in 
 proportion. These statistics only show the propensity of 
 the human species in reference to their gastronomic charac- 
 ter, .and so far as our figures go in regard to drinking, the 
 number of arrests made for drunkeiiess substantially de- 
 monstrate them. 

Imported Sheep. 

We notice a recent importation by Col. .T. W. Ware. cT 
 Clarke county, Va., of improvid Cotswold SLcep, consisting 
 of eight bucks and tbree ewes. One of the bucks and the 
 ewes were winners of the first prizes at the late Exhibition 
 of the Royal Agricultural Society of Englaml ; which fact 
 stamps the high character of the importation. The other 
 bucks are of superior excollence, and do great credit to the 
 enterprise of the importer — two of the latter were imjiorted 
 for My. Carrol and Wm. Jessup, Es<is., of Baltimore county, 
 and are now with their flocks. — Amoican Farmer.
