GRAVENSTEIN APPLE. 

This celebrated apple is of Ger- 
 man origin, and so far as we have 
 lieard sustains fnlly its repntation 
 in all localities here. The name 
 is supposed to be derived from its 
 having been originalty found in 
 the garden of a castle called Gra- 
 fenstein, in Oldstein, to which it 
 is said to have been introduced 
 from Italy. It has all the charac- 
 teristics of a really desirable fruit, 
 being, in addition to fine quality 
 and large size, a vigorous and heal- 
 thy grower, and abundant bearer, 
 commencing wlien quite young. 
 The fruit is imifonnly fair, and is 
 one of those recommended by the 
 American Pomological Society as 
 woi'thy of general cultivation. â€” 
 Size, large, roundish, oblate, 
 broadest at the base and some- 
 what one-sided ; skin, gi-eenish 
 yellow, sti-iped and marbled with 
 red; stem, short and stout, deeply 
 inserted; calyx, large, in a wide, 
 deep, in-egular basin ; flesh, ten- 
 der, juicy, crisp, with a rich, 
 sprightly, somewhat aromatic flavour ; ripens in October and November ; shoots erect in habit 

mRBAlSriSTE PEAE, SYN : BEUERE PICQUEEY. 

This is one of the fine Flemish varieties, import- 
 ed into this country in 1823, and is recommended 
 by the American Pomological Society as worthy of 
 general cultivation. It succeeds finely on the quince, 
 coming into bearing sooner thaij on the Pear stock. 
 It requires strong soil and good culture, and in fa- 
 vorable localities bears abundant crops. Not being 
 so rapid a grower as some other varieties, it may 
 prove to be longer lived and healthier, and the delici- 
 ous flavor of the fruit will always place it in the first 
 rank. Fruit, often large, obconic pyiiform, of- 
 ten obtuse, obovate; skin, pale j'ellow, slightly rus- 
 seted ; stalk, one inch long, stout, inserted in a 
 large depression ; calyx, small, closed, inserted in a 
 deep, narrow basin; flesh, white, buttery, melting, 
 with a rich, delicious, highly flavored juice ; ripens 
 October and November. 

Straw Paper 

The New York Tribune notices a new discovery which 
 promi.ses to work a revolution in the production of newspa- 
 pers n? well a;< books, viz : the straw paper of Mr. Mellier, a 
 Froiicli chemist and ir.anufafturer. This article is made en- 
 tirely frum strnw. and is as good as can be made of rags. 
 liy auow cLuiiiicii.! prycoas, the new invention reduces the fibre 

of straw or other vegetable substances into pulp, which is 
 then finished as paper by the ordinary methods. The ad- 
 vantage of the use of straw comes from its exceeding cheap- 
 ness and abundance. Rags are scarce, and as the demand 
 for paper increases rags become dearer, but there is littlo 
 danger of a sliort supply of straw. To discover a way of 
 using it for piipor has long been desired, but until Mr. 
 Mellier, no seckor had found it out. We are informed that
