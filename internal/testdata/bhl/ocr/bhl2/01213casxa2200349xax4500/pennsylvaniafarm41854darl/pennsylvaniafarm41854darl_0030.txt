TIio aliove slieller has I'eceived premiums at several State 
 Fairs, ami is very highly commended by those who have 
 used it. It is said that a man and boy can shell with it 175 
 bushels per day, two men near 250 bushels, and a one horse 
 power froai four hundred and fifty to five hundred bushels. 

Itisreoommcndedfor shelling corn either damp ordry with- 
 out regard to the size of the ear, and separates the grain from 
 the cobs. By the change of a slide, it can be made into an 
 excellent vegetable or root critter. The box is about two 
 feet long, one and a half feet wide, and two feet high. In 
 the bottom is a concave shaped cylinder, 10 inches by 17, of 
 W0Gd,fenced with iron staves, teethed. Ears thrown in upon 
 a board, serving as hopper, are held up to the cylinder by 
 wood springs, so that butt and points have equal bearing as 
 they pass out, the cobs ou one side, and the grain drops be- 
 Ic T. It is double geared for hand power, with a fly wheel 
 and pulley for horse power. Price $22, and may be obtain- 
 ed at Paschall Morris & Go's., Agricultural Warehouse, 380 
 Market street, Philadelphia. 

POST OFFICE MANAGEMENT. 

It is seldom tliat wo trouble our rt;aders with complaints, 
 Mit the gross neglect, or something worse, of the postal 
 lu^'agement, requires a notice at our hands, as well as a 
 corrective remedy from the able and efficient head of the 
 depr xment. 

IViore than three tJionsand copies of the December number 
 o'' the Farm Journal lay in the Post Office at this place from 
 P/Iday until Wednesday, for want of bags in which to 
 transport them. The Postmaster here, wo have reason to 
 believe, did every thing in his power to procure tho mail 
 ba^s necessary, but they were withheld from some cause 
 best known at tho Post Office in Philadelphia. 

This is not the first, nor the second time, such a case has 
 orourred. Letters, too, which ought to reach us in three or 
 four days, are often as many weeks in coming to hand, 
 while numbers said to have been mailed to our address have 
 never been received. 

Tho Stata Agricultural Society. 

The E::eciuiye Committee of the State Agricultural 
 Society hold a meeting at their ofBce in Harvisbiirg re- 
 cently, when it wns a.'^certaiued that the receipts at the 
 exhibition held in Pittsburg, amounted to $17,500 â€” de- 
 ducting $8,000 paid in premiums and other expenses, a 
 balance will be left of $4,000 ; which, added to the ap- 
 propriation of $2,000 by the State, and the sura in the 
 Treasury and invested in stocks, will reach the sum of 
 $15,000. 

We remind our friends througli the State that the an- 
 nual meeting of the State Society will be held at Har- 

risburg on the third Tuesday of January, at which time 
 premiums will be awarded on crops, as noticed in our 
 last issue. These annual meetings shoxild be better at- 
 tended than they have been by our faimers, who, at 
 such a leisure season, could readily spare the time, and 
 would be well repaid. In other States they are made 
 occasions of great interest. Every county society should 
 be represented at Ilarrisburg, and a general interchange 
 of views as to the best plans for promoting agricultural 
 improvement in Pennsylvania, miiting the farming inte- 
 rests in some thorough and effective manner, developing 
 its resources, and enabling our State to hold that posi- 
 tion in this respect she is entitled to. 

We have before spoken of the advantage of a public 
 lecturer, well qualified, to traverse the State this winter, 
 and deliver lectures at suitable points on agriculture and 
 its kindred sciences, promote county or township socie- 
 ties and clubs, obtain and spread information, and estab- 
 lish a more perfect union betvfeen these and the State 
 society. We arc confirmed in the opinion much good 
 would result from this course. 

The project of a State Agricultural College and model 
 farm will no doubt be brought up again, and prepared 
 for legislative action during the winter. We hope pre- 
 vious difficulties are removed, and the interchange of 
 opinions as to the proper plan, since the efi'ort of last 
 winter, will result in the speedy passage of the bill. 
 The whole state is interested in having a State Agricul- 
 tural School, where the sons of farmers, at a moderate 
 price, can secure a liberal education, and at the same 
 time be made acquainted with the science as well as the 
 practice of agriculture. The increased production and 
 wealth to Pennsylvania from the establishment of such a 
 school, and hundreds of her young men, Avho would 
 come from there, and diffuse the benefits of agricultiiral 
 Icnowledge and skill into their various localities, cannot 
 be calculated. 

Philadelphia Agricultural Society. 
 We observe by the Germantown Telegraph, that 
 through the liberality of 'fifteen members of the above 
 Society who have contributed $1000 each, a permanent 
 Exhibition ground has been purchased, i^bove Mt. Airy, 
 a few miles from Philadelphia, convenient to seA-eral 
 public roads, as well as a rail road, and where the fu- 
 ture exhibitions will be held. This good example should 
 be followed through the State, wherever practicable. 
 The convenience of exhibtors and proper display of stock, 
 &c., can hardly be rightly attended to where fixtures 
 are merely tempoa-ary, and erected in a rough, incomplete 
 and hurried manner. The names of these liberal gentle- 
 men are: David Landreth, Phillip R. Freas, Algernon 
 S. Roberts, Anthony T. Newbold, Samuel C. Ford, John 
 S. Kaines, Owen Sheridan, James S. Ilubcr, George 
 Blight, Isaac Pearson, Charles P. Fox, Hulings Cowper- 
 thwaite, John Turner, Gen. Robert Patteison, Robert 
 P. Haines. 

Lycoming County. 

We observe the preliminary measures are being taken to 
 organize an Agricultural and Horticultural Society in this 
 county. A public meeting for the purpose was called at 
 Williamsport on the 7th inst.
