THE FAEM JOURXAL. 

[January 

of the New York State Society, and more recently James 
 E. Tcschmacher, of Massachusetts. Of the latter it is 
 said, "that, in his death, science, literature and the arts 
 have been deprived of an earnest student and faithful 
 expounder, one ever anxious to learn, and always willing 
 to impart knowledge." A beautiful and comprehensive 
 eulogy. The disposition "of being ever anxious to 
 learn and ever willing to impart" is a constant attribute 
 of all true genius. 

We believe iu both cases the removal was very sudden, 
 and while it illustrates the fact "that death loves a 
 shining mark," it also may serve to point out the moral 
 that, in addition to our responsibilities and duties to so- 
 ciety and our fellow men, which are no doubt more or 
 less obligatory on all, there are others of paramount im- 
 portance to ourselves in being prepared for the calls of 
 the undeniable messenger, "the loosening of the silver 
 cord and breaking of the golden bowl," which no one 
 knows how soon may overtake him.

Eemedy for Smoky Chimnies 

The Scientific American states on reliable authority, 
 that "if two feet above the throat of your chimney you 
 enlarge the opening to double the size, for the space of 
 two feet, then carry up the rest as before, your chimney 
 will never smoke." 

Domestic Recipes. 

Make Your Own Candles. — Take 2 lbs. alum for 
 every 10 lbs. of tallow, dissolve it in water before the 
 tallow is put in, and then melt the tallow in the alum 
 water, with frequent stirring. This will clarify and har- 
 deti the tallow so as to make a most beautiful article, 
 either for summer or winter use, almost as good as sperm. 

Buckeye Bread. — Take a pint of new milk, warm 
 from the cow ; add a teaspoonful of salt, and stir in fine 
 Indian meal ijntil it becomes a thick batter ; and a gill of 
 fresh yeast, and put it in a warm place to rise. When 
 it is very light, stir into the batter three beaten eggs, 
 adding wheat flour until it has become of the consistence 
 of doiigh; laiead it thoroughly, and set it by the fire un- 
 til it begins to rise ; then make it up into small loaves or 
 cakes, cover them with a thick napkin, and let them 
 stand until they rise again, then bake in a quick oven. 

Johnny Cakes. — Scald a quart of sifted Indian meal 
 with sufiicient water to make a thick batter, stir in a 
 tablespoonful of salt. Flour the hands well, and mould 
 it into small cakes ; fry them in fat enough, nearly to 
 cover them. When brovm upon the under side they 
 should be turned. It takes about twenty minutes to cook 
 them. When done, si^lit and butter them. 

Hoe Cake. — Sift a quart of Indian meal, and a tea- 
 spoonful of salt, and a piece of butter the size of an egg. 
 Wet it with milk, not very stiff; after you have stirred 
 all well together, spread j-our dough about half an inch 
 thick, upon a smooth board prepared for the purpose. 
 Rub it over with sweet cream, and set it iip before a good 
 fire, supporting the board with a flat iron. When it is 
 well browned turn it over, loosening it with a knife. 
 After moistening it with cream, brown the other side, 
 as before. AVhen it is done cut into square cakes, and 
 send them to the table hot, split and butter them at 
 table. 

A-merican Figs, also Preserved Pumpkin, Citron. — 
 Have any of our readers, ever prepared peaches in 
 the way recommended below, and do they come up to what 
 is represented. It appears to us a very simple and val- 
 uable process, can mostly be performed by children, and 
 in case of a glutted market for Peaches, as is often the 
 case in a prolific season, could be practised on a large 
 scale, to great profit. It is fear of an overburdened 
 market, which often deters the farmer from fi-uit culture. 
 If this difiaculty can be obviated on the plan proposed for 
 pe:tchcs and plums, it will be an additional inducement to 
 plant orchards. They are said to keep indefinitely and 
 are a great luxury. We extract the receipt from the pro- 
 ceedings of the Farmers' club, New York, to which we 
 are often indebted for valuable information. They are 
 published in the American Artizan of New York city. 

Mr. T. B. Catlin : — A lady in New Jersey preserves fine 
 peaches iu the style of figs. She scalds the peaches slightly 
 puts fine sugar in them, and gently dries them to the condi- 
 tion of good figs, and they are better than true tigs. She 
 preserves plums also, well. She makes as good citron out 
 of the citron melon as the true. She uses pumpkins also with 
 good results. 

Home-made Figs: — As manvfactured by Mrs. Margaret 
 Garretson, Somersoille, N. J. — Peaches to bo pealed, cut 
 in two, the pit taken out; make a thin syrup of sugar and 
 water, put the peaches in while the syrup is warm or hot, and 
 nearly boil fur a few minutes ; then take them out and place 
 in slow oven till dry. 

Pumpkin. — Cut in large pieces and boil until soft in a 
 little water, [cover the pot and a very little water will do] 
 stew them out close, so as not to loose the sweetness ; take 
 out with a fork and lay them on plates to drain and cool ; 
 afterwards dry them in an oven with a very slow heat or 
 dry them in the sun. When properly done, they have a 
 pale, yellow look. When wanted to use put to soak the night 
 previous to using. 

Homemade Citron. — Melon (Nutmeg) when full grown, 
 not ripe, and not soft, cut iu squares, put into salt and water 
 — mr.de strong enough to bear an egg — for, from nine to 
 thirty days, when they turn yellow, take out and put into 
 fresh water to bo freshened daily until the salt is all out. 
 Then to make them green again, put them into boiling, water 
 with a little alum, and kept hot for a while, but not to boil, 
 then take out and boil till tender, in water, afterwards boil 
 with sugar as with ordinary preserves say 3 quarters of a. 
 pound of sugar, to one lb. of citron, until the juice is all ab- 
 sorbed or nearly so, flavor with lemon peel or lemcm drops. 
 Take out and dry ; if any liquor is left it can be dropped 
 on while the citron is drying. 

The cost is from 5 to 6 cents per lb. 

White Sheep Skin Door Mats. — Take two long-wooled 
 sheep skins, and make up a strong lather of soap : the sign 
 of proper strength is when the lather feels slippery between 
 the fingers. When the lather is cold, wash the skins care- 
 fully in it, squeezing them between the hands so as to take 
 all the dirt outof the wool. When this is accomplished, lift 
 out the skins and wash them in cold water until all the soap 
 is extracted. Have a vessel of clean cold water ready, to 
 which some alum and salt, (about half a pound,) which have 
 been dissolved in a small quantity of hot water, are added, 
 and the skins left to steep all night. When the alum water 
 has dripped off, they are spread out on a board to dry, and 
 carefully stretched with the hand from time to time. Be- 
 fore they are thoroughly dry, a composition of two table 
 spoonsful of alum, and the same of saltpetre, are ground to 
 powder, in a mortar or otherwise, and sprinkled carefully 
 on the flesh side of each skin. They are then placed the one 
 on top of the other, leaving the wool on the outside, and 
 huu;; upon a rack of slats, in a barn, shed, or dry airy pl.ace 
 for about three days, or until they are dry ; they should be 
 turned every day. After this, they arc taken down, and the 
 flesh side scraped witli a liluut knife, and each skin trimmed 
 for a mat. The flesh side maj' then be rubbed over with pipe 
 clay, beat with a switch, and will then be found supple, of a 
 beautiful white color, and fit for a door mat for a mechanio 
 or prince. — Mai-lc-Laue Ejpress.
