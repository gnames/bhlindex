For the Farm JDiirn.il. 
 My Dear Editor: — Little did I thiuk when I trium- 
 phantly read "Tho Husband's Complaint" in your December 
 number to my wife, then seated at the ''frame — forever do- 
 ing fancy work" — that I should so soon be called upon to 
 address you; but so it is — "read that, my dear," said she, 
 "and send it to tho Farm Journal" — laying before mo tho 
 following answer. Of eourso I obey, and am ever your con- 
 stant reader. JERRY. 
 Wilmington, Del., Dec. 10th, 1853. 

The Wife's Defence. 

In answer to the Husband's Complaint, and all whom 

it may concern. 

"Well, to be sure ! I never did ! why what a fuss you make, 
 I'll just explain myself, my dear, a little for your sake ; 
 You seem to thiuk this worsted work is all tlio ladies do, 
 A very great mistake of yours, so I'll enlighten j'ou. 

I need not count, for luckily I'm filling in just now ; 

So listen, dear, and drive away those furrows from your 

brow : 
 "When you are in your study, dear, as still as any mouse. 
 You cannot thiuk what lots of things, I do about the house. 

This morning after breakfast, I heard the children spell. 

And I'm teaching little Mary to gather and to fell; 

I paid our washing bills, and then I wont to see 

What remnants in the larder for our dinner there might be. 

I've hemmed a duster, and I've made a bonnet cap for 

]\Liry, 
 I've finished Jenny's pinafore, and fed the green canary; 
 I've taken in your collar, for you said it was too full. 
 And after that I must confess I sorted out my wool. 

I've read the paper, setting forth that sweet confiding trust 
 Husbands should cherish for their wives, and I think it very 

just; 
 I've settled all my weekly bills, and balanced my account. 
 With a lot of German wool to a very small amount. 

Ah ! now at last, my rhetoric convinces you I know 

That pleasant smile, and "yes, my love," it does become you 

so; 
 Besides to tell the truth, love, all the worsted work I do. 
 My bags, ray cushions and my mats, are all in compliment 

to you. 

But now. my love, entirely to please you I declare, 

I've worked the splendid arabesque upon my vesper chair ; 

Two hearth rugs and an ottoman, seven chairs, and after 

that 
 I hope to do some groups of flowers upon a carriage mat. 

Enough of banter, yet believe, one word before wo part. 
 The rest perchance was fiction, but this is from the heart: 
 The loving wife right cheerfully obeys her husband still, 
 And even lays aside her frame, if it is his lordly will. 

PATENT CLAIMS. 

Seed Planters — By R. C. Wren, of Mount Gilead, 
 Ohio : I claim the corabin.ation of the slides, cams, and elbow 
 levers or shifters, arranged and operating as set forth. 

Combined India Rubber and Steel Springs — By E. T. 
 BusscU, of Shelbyville, Ind. : I do not claim surrounding 
 a column of vulcanized India rubber with a helical spring, 
 as that is (he subject of a patent granted to F. M. Ray. 

But I claim the fluting a column of vulcanized India rub- 
 ber longitudinally, and then so surrounding it with the hel- 
 ical spring, mine being an improvement upon Ray's 
 spring. 

Shingle Machine — By Israel Grave's & C. A. Bogert, of 
 West Dresden, N. Y. : We claim a machine for sawing shin- 
 gles, and which m.iy be adapted to sawing other irregular 
 shapes, constructed wkh a gang of stationary and movable 
 saws, arranged vertically in a saw gate, which moves up and 
 down, the movable saws of said g.ang being caused to have a 
 gradually lateral movement from and towards tho stationary 
 saws, while cutting by means of groved cams, which operate 
 apon the pintle of the sliding bars, carrying the movable saws, 
 and thereby commun:cating said lateral movement to the said 
 saws, at the same time having a movement slightly out of a 

parallel lino with the direction of food communicating to them 
 by other cams, which operate upon the pintle of the sliding 
 bars, the said movement causing tho stufi" to be cut tapering 
 or of any required form, as described. 

Machines for Polishing Leather — By Frederick Sei- 
 bort, of Williamsburg, N. Y. : I claim a circular or curvilli- 
 near glass rubber combined with giving it a tilting motion for 
 tho purpose of enabling it, after passing oS' the edge of tho 
 leathcr-attho end of the stroke, to rollback and mount upon 
 the leather without scraping it up, as described. 

Iron Fence — By B. F. Miller, of New York City : I 
 claim constructing the top iind bottom rails in lateral 
 halves, and holding said halves together by screws, rivets, 
 or bolts, in combination with bosses or pivots cast on the 
 inside of the respective halves of tho rail with correspond- 
 ing countersinks or perforations near the ends of the filling 
 bars, as shown. 

Frederick Smith, of Pontiac, N. Y., for Improvement in 
 Water Wheels : 

I claim ventilating water-wheels enclosed by a curb, 
 scroll, or box, by means of a tube communicating with the 
 wheel, or in any other manner substantially the same, in 
 combination with the buckets, constructed and arranged as 
 set forth. 

W. Pierpont, of Salem, N. J., for Improvement in Cutters 
 of Grain and Grass Harvesters : 

I claim hanging the cutter blade at e.ach end to a crank, 
 so as to cause the rotary draw cut in form of a circle, as do- 
 scribed, in combination with the counter rod for insuring 
 the perfect revolution of both shafts in unison. 

E. R. Morrison, of Troy, Pa., for Improvement in Shingle 
 Machines : 

I claim the combination of a reciprocating river and fin- 
 ishing knife, with a fixed knife, so that on the backward 
 motion of the river, one face of the shingle shall be dressed, 
 and by its next forward motion, the second face will be 
 dressed by the fixed knife, substantially as described. 

Wm. H. Hall, of Philliiipi, Va., for Improvement in Grass 
 Harvesters : 

I claim the tram in combination with tho staples on the 
 arms, as described. 

Management of Barn Yard Manure. 

We extract the following article by Ph. Pusey, M. P. from 
 the Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society. It contains 
 many excellent suggestions, for the American Farmer, in re- 
 gard to a matter, the importance of which, either theoreti- 
 cally or practically is but little appreciated, viz : the proper 
 and economical management of our common barn yard ma- 
 nure. 

The construction of farm-buildings, as I have always said 
 must depend on tho proposed management of tho manure. 
 But this is a doubtful question, even in practical farming; 
 and chemistry can as j'ct say little about it, because we have 
 analysis of the droppings or urine as thej- proceed from tho 
 animal, and if we seek to trace the changes whicli these af- 
 terwards undergo, we find, unfurtunately, Bousingaull's an- 
 alysis of prepared dung, on which wo might have hoped 
 to reason, are ])ronounced by Liebig* to be chemically in- 
 correct. AValking then thus in the dark, it behoves us to 
 bo wary in following lights that would divert us from tho 
 beaten track. Our practice hitherto has been to make tho 
 dung in open farmyard, but to this iiractico two objections 
 are raised, the escape of ammonia into the air, and of liquor 
 into the neighboring ditch. For these two defects then va- 
 rious remedies have been proposed, one of them the use of 
 liquid manure. Sometimes a drain is made from the cow- 
 house, conveying the urine into a tank from which it is cart- 
 ed, and so distributed over tho land. One farmer I see thus 
 distributed the urine to thirty beasts unmixed in the last 
 sprin.ir, having kept it throughout the winter. I fcA bound 
 to point out the heavy loss he has thus incurred. According 
 to Sprengel tho contents of a cow's urine stand as follows : 
 Water, 92,624 

Urea, -1,000 

Free ammonia, 205 

Other matters, 3,171 

100,000
