is important, that in well-made dung more or less of this 
 volatile ammonia is, in some unknown way, brought again 
 into a lixL'd state. Spreugel thinks this is brought about 
 by humio acid, arising from the decomposition of straw. 
 Liebig denies the existence of such an acid, but says that 
 decayed woody fibre has the power of absorbing ammonia 
 to seven hundred times its own bulk. 

Much ammonia, it --oems likely, must be fixed in some 
 way, because in dunghills which are ripe, and yet not de- 
 cayed, one perceives little or no pungency of scent, while 
 practice shows that such dung has not lost its vigor. There 
 is danger then, that after all in applying the liquid por- 
 tion apart, we may dissipate the very essence we are seek- 
 ing to save, which would otherwise have been fixed by a 
 natural process. Supposing, however, that wo adhere to 
 the olil practice of making dung in farm-yards with the 
 help of the rain from heaven, there remains the objecti(m 
 that the supply is sometimes in exce.'JS, and that a black 
 stream runs away into some neighboring ditch. This pic- 
 ture, a very common one, is, I think, somewhat overdrawn; 
 or rather, is sketched from dairy farms, where litter is 
 scarce. On arable farms I doubt if the waste be very great. 
 Much will depend, of course, on the average amount of 
 rain, which varies, as wo have seen in different countieg. 
 1 have no experience on the matter, because my own yards 
 Lave their vent upon catch meadows, over which the waste 
 fluid is dispersed by the stream that runs through each 
 yard ; but Mr. Thompson's plan of a tank, as improved by 
 Ilannam, seems perfect. The farm-yard should be hol- 
 low in one part, and drains from the stables may empty 
 into this part. Here straw may accumulate, and bo steeped 
 in the muckwatcr. To prevent its overflow, a drain should 
 be led from the upper level of this hollow to a tank out 
 of the .yard, and by the side or in the centre of a paved 
 hollow like a gravel pit. AVhen the yard is cleared the 
 dung can be deposited in this pit, and the liquid from the 
 tank be pumped over it as occasion requires. I should add 
 B well in case of dry weather, when the liquid in the tank 
 might not suffice to keep the heat moist without the use of 
 plain water. "Plain water," says Mr. Thompson, "has been 
 found to answer exceedingly well." When the manure is to 
 remain long in the pit, it is covered with soil, and both 
 moisture and gas are so completely retained, that nine peo- 
 ple in ten might walk unconsciously over it. 

A still simpler plan, I think, would be the following. Let 
 the straw-y.ard bo shaped hollow to the centre, like a 
 shallow dish. In the centre might be the tank, surrounded 
 by a low wail, and from thence, with a pump, and hose, 
 you might easily return the fluid drainings upon the straw. 
 If perfection be sought in fixing ammonia, a litle sul- 
 phuric acid might be poured into the tank. If there be oc- 
 casion to lead manure straight from the j-ard to a heap 
 in the field, I strongly recommend a foundation of road- 
 dirt or earth, which will absorb the escaping fluids, and 
 serve excellently afterwards to be drilled with artificial ma- 
 nures. 

Some farmers are trying the cutting up of their litter, 
 80 as to apply the manure at once to the land. The dif- 
 ficulty which I seo is in always finding land ready to re- 
 ceive manure. The manure is applied of course unfermen- 
 ted. Npw, so far as we know, manure must be fermented, 
 that is, the urea must become ammonia, before it can be- 
 come food for plants. Still this forms no objection, bo- 
 cause the transformation doubtless will take place under 
 ground. The box-feeding system seems to have been 
 firmly established by Mr. Warnes for fattening boasts. The 
 box, about nine foet square, is sunk two feet in the ground, 
 and is itself the tank in which the animal rises upon his 
 his own litter, and until his head touches the ceiling. Hero 
 the principle of pressure is relied upon singly for retaining 
 ammonia. Care is requisite in supplying the litter, for if 
 given on too freely, it heats; if not frequently enough, the 
 air is tainted. So, on a large scale in Lincolnshire, the 
 folding gates between yards are hung a yard high from the 
 ground, and the straw accumulating is trodden down in the 
 open yard by young cattle. 

Whether sheep dung should bo made artificially, under 
 sheds upon boards, seems to mo a doubtful matter. I have 
 left ofiF shedding my own sheep, having found that of two 
 weighed lots the sheddod lot did rather the best in .January, 
 and the folded lot in ^March. The sheep certainly has a 
 good great coat provided by nature, which moreover, can- 
 not be curried in confinement like the hide of a cow. My 
 shepherd says that the sheep fat fastest in clear frosty weather, 

because they eat more ; and this is quite reconcilable with the- 
 ory, if animals find fat ready made in their food as they do 
 muscle, because, while taking in more fuel, they would take in 
 more fat. It would be like an express-train, which uses moro 
 coals, but goes faster. On the other hand, I know as a certain 
 fact that sheep which have been kept very warm in sheds upon 
 boards, have eaten certainly very little, but have also been 
 exceedingly slow in laying on fat. But as yet theory is 
 at fault on this matter. Wet weather is what throws sheep 
 back, and then they must thrive best under cover, though 
 the alternation cannot be well reconciled with the animal's 
 health, so that we must decide one way or the other, but 
 which way seems to me as yet problemctical. The balance 
 seems to turn in favor of field-feeding on light land farms, 
 yet there is some waste of manure in feeding off" turnips 
 upon the ground, if the crop be a full one and artificial food 
 bo employed. Even if ploughed as close as possible up to 
 the fold, the plough cannot come in until a whole length is 
 cleared from end to end. Meanwhile, the loss of manure 
 has been in great part incurred. Every farmer knows the 
 pungent stench which proceeds, in dry weather, from a 
 fold of high fed-sheep, but in a few daj's, before the land 
 can be plowed, this disappears, and with it ammonia has 
 fled. Sheep-manure, is in fact peculiarly liable to thia 
 waste; for the solid proceeds from sheep contain ammonia 
 as well as the liquid, and both ferment immediately. The 
 remedy lies in using a breast-plow to turn over a thin par- 
 ing of soil by hand as fast as the hurdles are shifted. It 
 costs, perhaps, 5s. per acre; but this is no extra expense, 
 because it saves the second plowing, which is other-wise 
 needed to mix the the manure equally through the land: 
 an essential point, I need not say, for the barley crop. I 
 am determined in future to breast-plough when possible, even 
 within the fold; for the health of the sheep sometimes suf- 
 fers, though in the open air, from this intense escape of 
 ammonia. Professor Way, I may mention, has illustra- 
 ted this evil; for he has ascertained that the soil of my 
 own farm has the hitherto unknown property, that when 
 mixed with fresh urine it hastens the fermentation by two 
 or three days, which clay on the other band retards or 
 prevents altogether. Many other soils, no doubt, have the 
 same property; but once buried, the ammonia is of course 
 safe, and this practice of following the fold with the breast- 
 plough is found to answer in Oxfordshire and Gloucester- 
 shire, where it is used regularly by many farmers. 

On the management of manure generallj-, it seems to me 
 not that we should adhere rigidly to our present system, but 
 that before this system undergoes a radical revolution, the 
 various transformations of animal manure require to be trac- 
 ed by chemistry, with accurate investigation of its different 
 stages, and that these results must be introduced into our 
 practice, subject to the health of animals, and to the sea- 
 sons at which manure is required. AVe are thus brought 
 to actual cultivation. Before wo consider, however, what 
 a farmer should grow, the question arises, what ho may 
 grow according to the covenants of his lease. 

Horse Power, Actual and Nominal of Steam Engines. 

The Scientific American gives the following as the rule for 
 determining the power of steam engines : 

Horse power is an amount of mechanical force that will 
 raise 33,000 lbs. one foot high in a minute. This standard 
 was adopted by Watt as the average force exerted by a 
 strong horse. His engines were made of a certain size, 
 corresponding to their recorded horse power ; that is the di- 
 ameter of the cylinder afibrded a key to the power of the 
 engine, as the steam carried was uniform in pressure, and so 
 was the velocity of piston. At the present day, we cannot 
 say that a certain diameter of cylinder is the key to its pow- 
 er. The steam is the power, and some engines whose nomi- 
 nal horse power is given by the bore of the cylinder may 
 exert double the nominal amount 

The number of pounds pressure on the square inch multi- 
 plied by the number of square inches in the area of the pis- 
 ton, and by the number of feet the piston travels in one 
 minute gives the amount of impelling force — about one- 
 tenth the power so calculated is deducted in large engines 
 for friction — the remainder is the efi"ective force, which if 
 divided by 33,000 gives the actual horse power.
