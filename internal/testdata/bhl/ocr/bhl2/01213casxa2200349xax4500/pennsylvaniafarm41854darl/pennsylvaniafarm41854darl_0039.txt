Essay on Plaster, by Dr. John A. Warder. 
 ■yVe do not think we can present a more acceptable 
 leading article to our readers than the following excel- 
 lent address, delivered before the Ohio Agricultural So- 
 ciety, at Columbus, December 7th, 1853, by Dr. John A. 
 Warder, the learned and able editor of the AVestern 
 Horticultural Review. 

We studied Georgics in the same school, some twenty- 
 five years ago, under the same teacher, with but little 
 expectation then of laboring at the same oar in 1854. 

Plaster is very extensively used in Chester county, 
 and we think to a greater extent each year. In a re- 
 cently published memoir of Philip Price, now deceased, 
 but formerly one of our best farmers, it appears he was 
 the first to introduce it here, and communicate the re- 
 sults of his experiments in answer to the queries of 
 Judge Peters in 1796. He observes, "Eight acres then 
 sowed with it plentifuUj', without other manure, became 
 worth ten times what it was before I plastered it." 

In relation to what our friend. Dr. Warder, s.ays of 
 land becoming "plaster sick," we may remark that it is 
 now annxially sowed with decided advantage on the same 
 farm, (formerly Philip Price's,) although in a high state 
 of cultivation. Our farmers usually sow one to one and 
 a half bushels to the acre, and find it most available 
 when applied early in the spring, so as to have the ad- 
 vantage of the early rains. Where it has been sprinkled 
 on the corn hill, we have observed its effect in spots of 
 grass, indicating where the hill of corn had stood, and 
 this after passing through the usual rotation of com, 
 oats and wheat, in three seasons. 

It has been found here particularly beneficial on 
 clover, but the effects are not observed in a very dry 
 season. 

It is univer.siUly admitted, now-a-days, that although 
 plants can wonderfully extract from the soil, the water and 
 the air, those eloiuents from which they construct their or- 
 ganism, they can still create no atoms; what we find in them, 
 though gloriously fashioned and admirably compounded for 
 our use and support, they must have obtained from some 
 other source exoteric to themselves ; the matter pre-existed, 
 and so far as that matter consists of fixed or mineral ingre- 
 dients, it has come from the soil, which is thenceforward so 
 much the poorer in those ingredients. The relative quanti- 
 ties and quality abstracted in each case is ascertained by re- 
 ducing the plants to ashes, and then analyzing the residuum. 
 Having ascertained the constituents of mineral matter in 
 any plant, we know'exactly what it takes from the earth. 
 So now wo feel al)le to prescribe with more satisfaction for 
 the malady of a sick farm. We feel its pulse by analyzing 
 the soil to ascertain the deficiency, and then endeavor to 
 make up the want, or to restore the balance. 

Among the many special manures of the present day — 

and their name is legion, and their character, too, highly 
 respectable, many of them being the results of the highest 
 human skill and ingenuity, directed in this channel by men 
 who are real benefactors of their race — it is my purpose to 
 direct your attention, upon this occasion, to a chemical ina- 
 nure from the gre.at laboratory of nature, one whose wonder- 
 ful effects upon vegetation have long been known in some 
 parts of the world, and whoso influence, as reported in some 
 cases, appears almost to belong to the marvellous, but whose 
 action and modus operandi have been terribly misunderstood 
 by many of those who have attempted their explanation. I 
 refer to Plaster of Paris, Gypsum, or Sulphate of Lime, 
 a heavy mineral, not very soluble in water, requiring 600 
 times its own weight for solution, and which needs to be ap- 
 plied in a very small portion to produce great results. 

Among the explanations that have been offered to account 
 for the effects, the doctrine of stimidxis has been a favorite 
 with many ; the plaster was said to be to the clover what the 
 glass of bitters was to the man — it stimulated the individual 
 to great efforts, while it made him at least feel great; but in 
 time it was discovered that there was a limit, beyond which 
 exhaustion ensued. Now I beg you not to imagine that I 
 believe in any such notion — but that every manure is either 
 directly food for the plant, or it enables food to enter the 
 organism — as a botanist I can assure you that plants have 
 no nerves, why then look for stimulants ? 

The true stimulants of vegetable life, so far as we know, the 
 only stimuli are the wonderful agents. Heat, Liyht and Elec- 
 tricity. These certainly do exert a manifest and most im- 
 portant influence upon vegetation, which cannot proceed in 
 a perfect manner without them. 

The use of Gypsum was perhaps known to the Romans. 
 I In modern times it was discovered to be a manure by Myer, 
 a German clergyman, in 1768. The story is that he ob- 
 served the grass growing more luxuriantly beside a pathway • 
 than anywhere else in the field. Having his attention, 
 aroused by this observation he attempted to explain it, and' 
 while studying the possible causes, he discovered that the- 
 pathway was constantly used by workmen from a mill in i 
 which Plaster was ground for use in architectural ornaments; . 
 these workmen carried much of the dust from the miiy. 
 which fell from them beside the path, and might have pro- ■ 
 duced the effect. Experiments developed further proof, andi 
 this was afterwards confirmed by Dr. Franklin who applied 
 plaster to a clover field, in the form of certain letters, there 
 the crop was so much improved that the words could be 
 spelled in deep green letters, they indicated, "this has been 
 plastered." Here was a new kind of sympathetic ink. 
 Meyers an(t Franklin both contributed to the introduction of 
 this manure, in their respective countries, and it has beent 
 much used ever since. Wherever its virtues have been ap- 
 preciated and its introduction has been practicable and con- 
 venient, it has often been carried hundreds of miles. In the 
 old States especially, and on the Atlantic seaboard, where 
 water-communication is extensive, whole States are supplied 
 with this substance from Nova Scotia, where it abounds. 
 Western New York has a bountiful supply near Seneca Falls; 
 here in Ohio we have a deposit on Sandusky Bay, that has 
 long been worked by Mr. Lockwood, and where additional 
 mines have recently been opened by the brothers Marsh. 
 In western Virginia I dijoovered a deposit on the New Riv- 
 er, a branch of the Kenawha, upon a high road, and at an 
 important crossing place, the ferry near Paris , and yet at 
 this very ferry, wagons were crossing, loaded with plaster, 
 which they were transporting over the mountains for eighty,'
