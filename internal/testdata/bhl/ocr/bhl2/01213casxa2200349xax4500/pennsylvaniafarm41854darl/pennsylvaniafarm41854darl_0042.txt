Profits of Good Farming. 

Our friend, Mr. John Cuavun, of Beavor township, in 
 this county, furnishes us with tho following ostim.ite of the 
 proceeds of 6 acres of land, and the expenses of farming 
 the same : 

6G0 bushels of Corn, in the ear, at 25, $166,60 

ISO bushels of Potatoes, at 25, 45,00 

Fodder and Pumpkins, 48,00 

Whole Proceeds, 

Hire of Team, 

Board of hand and team. 

Planting, 

Harrowing, 

Horse and Cultivator, 

Horse Hoeing, 

Seed Corn, 

Husking, 

Board of hands, 

Seed Potatoes and working. 

Whole Expense, $77,63 
 Leaving a balance in his favor of $181,87. Mr. Craven 
 does not give this information by way of bo.asting, but mere- 
 ly for the purpose of showing the profits resulting from ju- 
 dicious farming. The crop is not so large as some raised in 
 counties farther south, but is an excellent one for the local- 
 ity. He is well known to the people of north-western Craw- 
 ford, as one of our best farmers, and is up with tho times in 
 all improvements necessary to carry on his business in the 
 most expeditious, least laborious, and most profitable way. 
 His implements are of the most approved kinds, and are al- 
 ways in good order. The result above shows that a single 
 crop has more than paid for tho land on which it growed, at 
 $25 per acre, a high price for land in his section.

Wintering Domestic Animals. 

A most important annual era is now commencing with the 
 farmers of the whole country. They are beginning a period 
 of nearly half a year, when all their domestic animals should 
 be fed chiefly with dried or artificial food, and when cold, 
 storms, wind, snow and rain, are all operating to weaken or 
 waste the flesh of their farm stock, uiiless a good system of 
 protection and precaution is adopted at the outset. 

The vastness and importance of this branch of successful 
 husbandry is almost beyond comprehension. The census re- 
 turns inform us that 600 millions of dollars are invested in 
 the live stock of the union; yet this does not furnish a full in- 
 dex to their value, which is intimately blended with the man- 
 ufacture of manure, the mainspring in tho production of all 
 crops — and on them depend the forces, the general economy, 
 and not only their direct profits in the sale of butter, cheese, 
 wool, beef, pork, lard and tallow, and living animals are .as 
 intimately connected as the woof and the warp of tho weav- 
 <er's fabric. 

The losses from the bad wintering of farm stock are enor- 
 mous. Estimating that one-half of their value is required to 
 carry them through the aver.age four months of winter, 
 (which in the extreme north is nearly six months,) we have 
 have three hundred millions of dollars to be expended upon 
 them the country over between the present time and the pe- 
 riod of the spring pasture. Would it not be safe to say one- 
 third or one kundred millions — enough to make a Pacific 
 railway — are a«iiiually lost, litorally sunk, by bad manage- 
 ment ? Let uB 'look a little at this part of the subject. 

We have shown on former occasions why animals must con- 
 sume food to sustain their warmth in cold weather, as well as 
 for the support of their flesh. A man who rides in an open 
 cutter in the coW all day, will find it necessary to eat nearly 
 twice as much as when taking as much exercise in a warm 
 stove-room; and every farm laborer has foutid that he eats 
 more when chopping cord wood in tho wintry frost, than when 
 .cradling wheat under a burning sun. It is the same with ani- 
 mals; when exposed to wind and storms, a large portioa of the 
 food they consume must of necessity go to keep up the heat; 
 and the farmer must either give them additional food, or see 
 them decline in fl«sh — for the warmth is a part of vitality^ and 
 must be kept up, flesh or no flesh, while the animal lives. 

Careful observers who have provided ample and comforta- 
 ble shelter, think that one-third of the food of cattle is saved 
 t>y such protection, the condition *s to the flesh remaining the 
 aame as when subjected to oxposur*, W'heu they are suffered 

to lie on wet straw, or on damp ground with no straw at all, 
 the cold affects their wet bodies still more. Milk cows give 
 more and better milk when well cared for, and horses are 
 stronger and more lively f(jr work. Sheep furnish finer wool 
 and more of it, fewer perish by winter, and all come out in 
 better condition in spring, when protected from the blasts of 
 the wintry tempests; a skilful sheep raiser thinks his sheep- 
 barns and sheds were thus paid for in two winters. The win- 
 tering of store pigs would be a far less expensive item of farm 
 economy, if warm, comfortable and clean quarters were al- 
 ways assigned them. 

In addition to the immediate and present loss from expo- 
 sure, there is another formidable loss of a more remote but not 
 less real character. This is the check or stunting in growth 
 which young animals receive, and which they never get over. 
 Let two be fed and treated precisely alike, at all periods of 
 their growth, with the exception of exjiosing one to snow, 
 rain, mud and discomfort for a single winter, while the other 
 has warm, dry quarters and good, regular food; and that win- 
 ter will be impressed upon them, and an indelible historical 
 mark, in their relative sizes, for the rest of their lives. To 
 say nothing about the loss of fodder by treading in mud, feed- 
 ing irregularly or in over and under doses, and out of time, 
 and other wasteful practices, we are satisfied that the above 
 mentioned causes occasion a waste of at least one-third of the 
 wintering, and that the hundred million estimate is not ex- 
 travagant. 

AVhy will farmers continue longer to pursue this costly, 
 slip-shod treatment ? Why not lay down for themselves a set 
 of rules, something like the following, and show that they 
 have industry and energy to practice them with rigid exact- 
 ness : 

1. To shelter all fodder well, so that the weather may not 
 waste its strength. 

2. To shelter well the straw for litter, so that it may be al- 
 ways dry and comfortable. 

3. To feed regularly, both as to time and quantity, that the 
 animals may never fret from delayed meals, or from stinted 
 supplies. 

4. To give every night a good bed of dry litter, that the 
 animals may not become chilly from dampness. 

5. To keep their places of repose dean, and their hides cur- 
 ried, that they may not suffer the discomfort of filth. 

6. To provide ample racks and feeding boxes to prevent a 
 waste of roots, meal and fodder. 

7. To give special attention to growing animals, that they 
 may not become irrecoverably stunted. — Country Gentle-

On the Disease and Preservation of the Potatoe. 

It is now more thnn ten j-ears, we believe, since what is 
 called "the potatoe disease" first appeared in ourcountry, and 
 every year since then, although many plans have been tried 
 to prevent it, its ravages have always been more or less 
 manifested every season, and in none more fatally and uni- 
 versally than the present, excepting the terrible year of 1846 
 when it may be said to have been the means of depeoploing 
 Ireland of more than two millions of inhabitants. This dis- 
 ease has not been confined to any locality, for it has extend- 
 ed with more or less virulence over every conptry in which 
 this useful tuber has been cultivated, consequently the cause 
 of the disease must have been general, and a remedy for it 
 would be hailed with gratitude by more than two hundred 
 millions of the human race. We have published much useful 
 information on the subject, and nothing but what was prac- 
 tical and sensible, and we take pleasure in laying before our 
 readers again some new information which we look upon as 
 valuable and worthy of being acted upon by our agriculturists. 
 T. J. Herepath, an English chemist of celebrity, has written 
 a letter to the "London Chemical Gazette," giving conclu- 
 sions at which he has arrived after a gre.at many experiments, 
 respecting the cause and cure of this disease. They are as 
 follows : 

1. That the potatoe blight is neither directly nor indirect- 
 ly caused by the ravages of any parasitical insect. 

2. That it is the effect of a species of putrefactive fermenta- 
 tion or incipient decomposition of the nitrogenous, j. e. al- 
 b.umenoid constituents of the §ap or cell-contents. 

3. That this decomposition, is either directly produced by 
 a peculiar fungus, tho "Botrytis tnfcstans"* — to which public 
 attention has been already directed by other writers or, what 
 is in my opinon a still more probable supposition, the fungus 
 referred to only makes its appearance after the fermentative
