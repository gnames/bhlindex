THE FARM JOUllXAL.

Berkshire Agricultiu-al Society. 

Our friend William H. Dillingham, of Philadelphia, 
 has f'lvcircd lis with a perusal of a letter addressed to 
 him in 18120 by Thomas Gold, one of the earlier presi- 
 dents of the B(M-kshire Agricultural Society, founded in 
 1811, and generally called "the parent one." As socie- 
 ties are now springing up in all directions the informa- 
 tion about the doings of this, which T. G. observes in 
 one part of his letter, "was the first in the world which 
 adopted a practical course for bringing into action the 
 physical means and energies of the country and popula- 
 tion," will, we think, be no less curious than interesting 
 and useful. Many of the suggestions are well deserving 
 of attention nnu\ and indicate sound judgment and prac- 
 tical foresight. 

The letter appears to have been in answer to an en- 
 quiry for information as to the best regulations for the 
 Philadelphia Agricultural Society, probably then about 
 being established. It says : 

''It will always be important to success that you ap- 
 point men of good standing, of competent learning, 
 much given to enquiry, reading and experiments. This 
 will be all important at the outset, and they should be 
 readj^ and alert in tlie discharge of every duty. Much 
 must be written or collected, and dispersed among the 
 members. There must be iised means of extensive ex- 
 citement. The business must be impressed as primary, 
 the foundation of all other pursuits. Agriculturists 
 must be taught to respect themselves and their employ- 
 ment. They are the re.al nobility of our republican 
 country. At your meetings, and especially the anniver- 
 sary, much must be done to explain and enforce the ob- 
 jects of the societ3'. We occupy two days most indus- 
 triou.sly; the first in viewing the animals, the manufac- 
 tures, specimens of agricultural products, mechanical 
 inventions and improvements, agricultural implements, 
 and the whole circle of the arts as presented. These 
 objects engage the several committees, and they prepare 
 reports for the second day. These reports are drawn up 
 accuratchj, making a schedule for inserting each article, 
 and adding such remarks as each committee think pro- 
 per. The second day is that which usually attracts a 
 more general attendance of people of fashion, ladies, &c. 
 The occasion is interesting. The morning is usually 
 opened with a snlute of cannon and ringing of bells. 
 The society assembles by 11 A. M., forms a procession, 
 and invites to it all the people attending. Having a 
 small uniform escort of about 30 or 40 men, with mili- 
 tary and other mu.sic, wo then move to some meeting 
 house where the exercises of the day are commenced by 
 prayer, preceded always by an ode or other composition 
 suited to the occasion. Then the President, or some 
 other person selected, addresses the society and audi- 
 ence. When this is closed another tune is sung. Then 
 6ne of the Vice Presidents, after a short address, de- 
 clares the premiums by reading each report. This cere- 
 mony is executed with much displaj', having marshals in 
 uniform to deliver the premiums to the ladies. The men 
 come forward and receive theirs. When these duties 
 are closed, there is usuallv sung an ode or some suitable 
 tune. The societj' and audience then form a procession. 
 and move to som.e place where they dine. The close of 

the day is usually spent in social and convivial engage- 
 ments, in which is displaj'ed all the good things, the 
 fruits of agriculture in elegance and plenty, but no li- 
 quors or wine saving such as individuals specially order. 
 The ladies arc always honored of evening by a grand 
 show in the ball room !" 

These are curious reminiscences of the past. The 
 singing part of the programme would be rather a novel 
 feature in these days. The following adverts to a diffi- 
 culty genei-ally experienced iioiv : 

"The most important means of prosperitj' in these as- 
 sociations are adequate funds. In the early stages of our 
 Society, we relied on subscriptions and private contribu- 
 tions. These were precarious. Three years ago our 
 Legislature voted us $200 a year for three years, and a 
 few months ago they adopted a permanent system for 
 the encouragement and support of such societies, by 
 which each society may receive $600 yearly, provided 
 the members of the society or others will place out on a 
 permanent footing, a sum that will also produce $600 a 
 year or any less sum. We have executed our part by 
 procuring good notes, of say $-50 each, from responsible 
 men, bearing an interest of six per cent payable yearly.

 Society, though genei'al and of long standing, never 
 were able to extend themselves beyond theories. They 
 therefore honored us with the appellation of Parent So- 
 ciety." 

Good Farming in Delaware. 

Daniel Cummins, Esq., near Smyrna, Delaware, has 
 raised the past season, on two fields of his Font Hill 
 farm, a crop of wheat averaging forty-two bushels to 
 the acre, and weighing 61 J pounds to the bushel. Three 
 or four bushels to the acre were supposed to have been 
 lost by a severe southwesterly storm in May. 

The first crop of wheat from these fields, three years 
 ago, prodixced fifteen bushels to the acre. Six years 
 ago ten bushels per acre would have been considered a 
 good croj). 

AVe should be pleased to hear from Mr. Cummins, the 
 process by which he has brought his fields up to their 
 present state of productiveness. 

Anthony's Patent American Churn. 

AVe observe, in our English Agricultural exchanges, a 
 notice of this churn having been ^Utgain" awarded the 
 premium of the Royal Agricultural Society at the last 
 meeting at Gloucester. At the trial it made 4 lbs. 6 oz. 
 of butter from four quarts of cream, while the best of 
 the other churns tried made only 3| lbs. from the same 
 quantity and quality. It says 2000 of them are sold 
 there yearly. 

Although a roundabout way of reaching the informa- 
 tion, we confess our ignorance about a churn in this 
 country under that n.ame, and should be obliged by any 
 of our readers informing us as to where it is made, and 
 what are its peculiarities. 

American implements appear to be taking the lead in 
 England. MoflSt's threshing machine in a recent trial 
 appears to liave surpassed all other horse power ma- 
 chinos j-ct known there. It is the invention of John R. 
 M..flit, Pi<|ua, Ohio.
