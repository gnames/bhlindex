Chester County Pigs. 

As our Chester county breed of pigs is becoming pretty 
 widely known, and the past season have taken first pre- 
 miums, not only at om* own State Exhibition, but also in 
 several States south of us, we give the following weights 
 of some which have been recently slaughtered in this 
 vicinity : 

Bazel Graves, of West Chester, killed one a few days 
 since, weighing 559 lbs., at 16 months old. On pre- 
 vious j-ears he has fed them up to as high as 830 and 
 795 pounds each, at 22 months old. 

Thomas Fitch, of East Bradford, a few miles west of 
 West Chester, slaughtered one on the 2d ult., 16 months 
 old, which weighed 6752- lbs. 

William D. Haines, of AVest Goshen, slaughtered one 
 on the 21st ult., 18 months old, and weighing 620 lbs. 

If any of oui- readers have done as well or better than 
 the above, we should like to record it. 

B. Graves, in feeding his animals up to these extraor- 
 dinary weights, informs us that he selected of our well 
 known Chester county breed, when quite young, such as 
 gave promise by their large bone of great growth, and 
 during the fattening process made it a rule alwaj's to 
 give a good feed about ten o'clock in the evening before 
 bed-time. In long nights and cold weather he consider- 
 ed the fast from 6 in the evening till 6 next morning en- 
 tirely too long. His practice in this particular is wor- 
 thy of attention. 

FARM ACCOUNTS. 

There is one subject much neglected by farmers, and 
 which in every pursuit is considered of the greatest im- 
 portance, viz : the correct keeping of regular book en- 
 tries. Dr. and Cr. accounts, so that a person may at 
 once, by reference to them, understand the profits and 
 condition of his farming operations. 

Each field on the farm should be named or numbered, 
 and an account opened with it in the day book, charg- 
 ing it with all expenses on each crop, and crediting it 
 with all receipts, the difference showing the nett profit 
 or loss as the case may be. In this way a farmer can 
 tell at a glance which is his most profitable crop, and to 
 which he should bestow his chief attention. By compar- 
 ing these for a series of years, he forms reliable data for 
 general management. A couple of dollars for a Day 
 Book and Ledger, and a few minutes each evening, will 
 be all the time and expense necessai-y. To these should 
 also be added a book for a diary of each day's opera- 
 tions, what the hands were engaged at, lost time, &c., 
 and general remarks as to any new process or change in 
 the mode of pei-forming work. 

We have also found it convenient to have a small pass 
 book to keep the mens' wages in and the amount paid 
 them, which may be transferred to the day book once in 
 two weeks or once a mouth. There is the same proprie- 
 ty in the farmer keeping his accounts accurately as the 
 merchant, and when the habit is once formed, there is a 
 real satisfaction in this daily inspection of tlic accounts 
 and business of the farm, and a real advantage in thus 
 keeping the mind posted up to its duties, and arranging, 
 the evening before, the work to be done on the mor- 
 row. 

A farmer should never be at a loss what to direct his 

men to do next. No job of work should be allotted them 
 without determining on the one to succeed it. We have 
 known the hands on some places to lose several hours a 
 day, in either seeking their employer for directions, or 
 awaiting his return. 

There is the same necessity for system, order, and ju- 
 dicious planning on the farm, as in the store or office, 
 and success is as dependent on it in one case as in the 
 other. 

Since writing the above, we find the following account 
 current with a field of corn and potatoes in the Ohio 
 Farmer, and which we copy to give some idea of the 
 plan we have suggested, and which should be carried out 
 on every field : 

Field No. 1 — 13 acres, planted in corn. A plain soil, 
 rather sandy, one half acre waste land, one and one half 
 acres in potatoes, the balance in corn.

National Exhibition of Poultry. 

Our friends in Now York have lately organised a Poul- 
 try Society, and elected P. T. Baruum, President, A. B. 
 Allen, Secretary, and R. B. Coleman, of the Astor 
 House, Treasurer, and thirty-three Managers. They 
 have concluded to have a grand poultry exhibition in 
 New York city on the 13th of February next, continuing 
 several days, which will include all kinds of fowls, and 
 at which pi'emiums will also be offered for the best speci- 
 mens of rabbits, rat terrier dogs and deer. 

It will immediately follow the State Poultry Exhibi- 
 tion at Albany, so that contributors can take their \>o\x\- 
 try to both exhibitions. Exhibitors are to be avlniitted 
 free at all times, food and water provided by the society, 
 and proper persons appointed to regularly feed and pro- 
 vide for them without inconvenience to the owner. 

There is nothing like taking a wide swath in these 
 matters. The term nalional sounds rather large, con- 
 sidering the short notice, and would seem to imply that 
 it is to eclipse, not only all State exhibitions yet held.
