or three daj's, and bore the horns on the under side, two 
 or three inches fi-om the head, so as to let in fresh air, 
 and let the putrid matter out if any is collected. I have 
 never known this fail if taken before too far gone. I 
 have cured one cow when the top of the head was so full 
 of matter that I opened a place above the ear which dis- 
 charged more than a half pint. This was in the sum- 
 mer, the cow was fattened in the fall and killed ; the 
 head was all right, excepting a place at the roots of the 
 horns about as large as a small spoon bowl." 

Agricultural School in Maryland. 

A special meeting of the Maryland State Agricultural 
 Society was held on the 13th of December, to take into 
 consideration tlie proposition to establish an Agricultu- 
 ral School and Experimental Farm under the auspices of 
 the Society. On motion of Mr. Key, the Secretary was 
 directed to prepare a heading for the subscription lists, 
 which was submitted to the society for its adoption, as 
 follows : 

"We, the subscribers, do agi-ee and bind ourselves to 
 pay the sum or sums of money set opposite our respec- 
 tive names, for the purpose of purchasing and establish- 
 ing an Experimental Farm, within five miles of the city 
 of Baltimore, to be conducted under the auspices of the 
 Maryland State Agricultural Society, and to be used as 
 a permanent show ground for the annual exhibitions of 
 said society. One-third of the subs9riptions will be paid 
 in cash, and the balance at the option of the subscribers, 
 in six, twelve and eighteen months." 

On motion of the President, the officers of the society 
 present were called on to pledge their respective coun- 
 ties to the raising of a certain fund to carry out the ob- 
 jects contemplated by the meeting. The invitation was 
 responded to by several of the Vice Presidents present, 
 ooe of whom pledged his county to raise $2,000, others 
 $1,000 each, and others in proportion to their ratio of 
 taxation, in comparison with those which had thus fixed 
 the amount to be raised by them. 

It would appear from the above that Pennsylvania 
 will soon find in the Stales joining her, both on North 
 and South, an Agricultural School of the kind which we 
 as yet have been only talking about. At the period of 
 our wiiting this, no action on the subject has yet been 
 made in our State. For the credit of Pennsylvania, as 
 well as for the positive benefit to result, we hope some- 
 thing definite may be concluded on the present winter. 

PROTECTION TO FRUIT GROWERS. 

Pittsburgh, Dec. 5, 1853. 

At the last meeting of the Allegheny County Agricultural 
 Society, the undersigned were appointed a, Committee to cor- 
 respond with you and others, and ask your co-operation to 
 procure at the coming session of the Legislature, an Act de- 
 claring the stealing of growing Fruit, Vegetables, Grain, <fec., 
 Larceny. 

Believing the common law distinction between stealing 
 from the ground or wagon and taking from the tree or vine, 
 absurd, and productive both of injury to the agriculturist and 
 evil to society, our Farmers and Fruit Growers urged on the 
 Legislature last session to pass such a law for this county, but 
 were mot by the objection that it would not do to have a 
 criminal law for one county different from that of the rest of 
 the State. 

Deeming such a law essentially necessary to protect the 
 farmers and fruit growers of Pennsylvania, who have so much 
 wealth and industry embarked in their vocations; and deem- 
 ing the present tresspass remedy entirely inadequate and use- 
 lessâ€” we respectfully and earnestly ask your co-operation, by 
 the votes of your members at Harrisburg, and by petitions, if 
 you think it advisable, to secure the passage of a simple law 
 declaring the wrongful taking of Fruit, Vegetables, Grain, 
 (fee., whether attached to the ground or not, Larceny, and to 
 be punished as such. 

Then may we hope to keep pace with the horticulturists of 
 our sister States, who are encouraged and protected by whole- 
 some laws. ROBERT M'KNIGIIT,

We fully approve of the above circular, which has 
 been issued by the Allegheny County Agricultural So- 
 ciety for general circulation through the State. We 
 hope it may receive attention in each county, and peti- 
 tions be prepared for Legislative action the present win- 
 ter. The want of some enactment of the kind indicated 
 in the petition, is a very gre;4t discouragement to plant- 
 ing fruit trees, and while it in fact prevents the farmer 
 from going into a most lucrative branch of his business, 
 it also operates against the consumer by shortening the 
 supply, and thus enhancing the price. We had the past 
 season to bear the loss and disappointment of having 
 nearly all our pears stolen from our dwarf trees, embra- 
 cing a large variety, and which we had designed for ex- 
 hibition. We were just a day too late. Being green 
 and unripe, we had considered ourselves tolerably safe, 
 but we suppose some other person found out that pears 
 will ripen well in the house. As remarked in the circu- 
 lar, the distinction now made between taking from the 
 ground or wagon and taking from the tree is absurd. 
 The principle is precisely the same between stealing 
 from your orchard and going into the house and stealing 
 from the pantry. The latter to be sure is more difficult, 
 and more liable to be discovered, but the principle is the 
 same, and it surely will not be pretended by our legisla- 
 tors that the old Spartan law is correct, that the crime 
 consists not in the act, but in the detection. 

We have known cases in this county where orchards 
 were visited by persons provided with three bushel bags, 
 and who have carried off apples by the quantity, without 
 leave or license, through the apple season. 

We know it is objected to a law of the kind proposed 
 that, in a plentiful season, fi'uit is often a mere drug, is 
 fed to the pigs, and that from a large orchaid a few ap- 
 ples or peaches would not be missed. This is nothing to 
 the point and docs not touch the principle. Laws must 
 be framed on the broad foundations of justice and right, 
 and be of general application. They must recognise and 
 settle broad principles. A man worth a million of dol- 
 lars would not suffer from the loss of $5 or $10, which 
 might be abstracted from his pocket, and yet he is as 
 much entitled to the protection of the law, and to the 
 absolute ownership of the fractional parts of his fortune, 
 as the man who is only worth one hundred. There is a 
 proper way to do every thing. No fanner would hesi- 
 tate to give of his abundance of fruit, when asked to do 
 so, if he had it to spare. What we contend for is his 
 primary claim of ownership, and his right to be asked, 
 and to dispense his favors in such cjuantities as he 
 chooses, and not to have his fruit filched from him with-
