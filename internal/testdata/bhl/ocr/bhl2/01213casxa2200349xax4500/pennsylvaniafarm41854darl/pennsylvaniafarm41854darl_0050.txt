report as it thought proper. The next thing I saw or 
 heard of the report was, when it appeared in print, 
 on the first page of the preface to "Gucnon's Discovert/," 
 Improved and simplified ^-c. ^'c, by John Nrfflin." From 
 this it may be perceived, that the action of the Society 
 in this matter, if not irregular, was rather hasty and in- 
 considerate, and should be received as doubtful evidence 
 In support of Guenon's theory; which, if erroneous, it is 
 much to be regretted that "The Philadelphia Society for 
 Promoting Agriculture" should have backed it so strong- 
 ly, for as it is the province of the society to promote 
 and establish correct principles, in view of advancing the 
 intei-ests of agriculture, its influence for good would be 
 sensibly impaired when attempting to disseminate sound 
 doctrines, should farmers have been misled by trusting to 
 former opinions and recommendations, emanating from 
 the same source. 

Having thus premised, I proceed to answer the ques- 
 tions propounded to me by "Science." To the rirst, 
 "whether I have ever studied Guenon's work and applied 
 it enough to find its incorrectness?" I answer, that I 
 have informed myself in regard to it, so far as reading 
 what was published of the discovery a few years back, 
 when my attention was first drawn to it, as well as by 
 perusing the pamphlet now the subject of remark, and 
 believe that I comprehend it fully, — further, that I have 
 frequently taken occasion to prove its inapplicability. 
 To tlie second "whether I have ever found a well 
 marked cow that was not a good milker, and an infe- 
 rior marked cow that was a good milker?" I answer, 
 that if this question rested upon the points or marks 
 established on correct principles, I seldom have found 
 them at fault; but as it means the "mirror" marks, I 
 say, that good, bad and indifferent marks may be found 
 among well marked cows. To the third — "did I ever 
 sec a long scanty haired animal that was a good animal 
 for milk or feeding properties ?" I answer that if this 
 question as to the state of the hair, referred to the hair 
 on the entire hide of the animal, it would be an unfa- 
 vorable sign of a good milker or feeder ; but as it refers 
 to the hair under the tail and inside the thighs, called 
 the miiTor, I say, that the length or scantiness of the 
 hair in that direction only, would determine nothing as 
 to the good or bad milking and feeding properties of the 
 animal. These answers having been freely and frankly 
 made, it is proper that they should be accompanied by 
 some coincident remarks, tending to show, that no con- 
 fidence should be put in the lines of hair their curves, 
 disposition, quality &c., as tests, in the region compris- 
 ing what is termed the escutcheons or "mirrors," and of 
 course, whether these mirrors be perfect or imperfect they 
 can have no bearing on, or relationship to, the good or 
 bad milking properties of the cow. But first permit me 
 to quote what is laid down in the pamphlet as the posi- 
 tion and form of the "mirror" — the true reflector and in- 
 dicator of the chai-acter of the animal. It reads — "The 
 position of the milk mirror is bordered by a frame of hair 
 which grows upwards, and of such as grows downwards ; 
 it begins in the middle between the four teats, ascending 
 between the thighs towards the vulva and anus." So much 
 for its position. Now follows a description of its form 
 and quality, as constituting the most desirable mirror, 
 classed No. 1,, and is "lyre shaped." "The complete 

mirror ■ commences in the middle of the four teats of 
 the udder, which is covered with a short fine down. It 
 passes upwards over the whole back of the udder, occu- 
 pies the inner and outward surface of the thighs and ex- 
 tends to a. a. (a certain distance on the escutcheon) 
 thence it curves inwards, rises to the anus IJ to 2 inches 
 wide on each side of the vulva a b. b. Above the teata 
 at c. c. we find two ovals 2 inches in length by 1 ,] 
 inches in breadth, with hair growing downwards. The in- 
 ner part of the thigh upwards towards the vulva, is of a 
 yellowish color, with scattered black spots where we find 
 the bran or dandruff." There are it appears, eight classes, 
 the first as above, called the "lyre shaped," second, &c., 
 "selvage shaped, fork shaped, club shaped, square shap- 
 ed, wedge shaped, shield shaped." To trace the metes 
 and bounds of these diagrams by the hairs which form 
 their boundaries is no easy task even with the pamphlet 
 in hand, without it and the pictures, it must be "sharp 
 work for the eyes ;" but feeling is called in to aid the ex- 
 ploration, as among the good qualities set down, "as good 
 qualities in every becd and every class" — "yellowish hair 
 in the mirror, from which on rubbing with the finger, a 
 yellowish bran like dustor dandrufi" appears." No dou}3t, 
 so far as the bran or dandruff is concerned, it Avill be 
 found on every escutchen of every breed, whether calf, 
 heifer, cow, bull or steer, — nay, on horses, goats, sheep, 
 swine, &c., &c. 

Now let it be observed, that this narrow and obscure 
 strip, beginning between the teats, ascending up to the 
 root of the tail, formed mostly for the accommodation 
 of the tail, and the tail formed to protect and hide the 
 delicate and ofl'ensive parts named in the mirror, is held 
 to be the tablet and only place, par excellence, on which 
 the seekers after reliable information, can trace the good 
 or bad properties of the cow ; and this, too, without the 
 least regard to physiological principles, as showing the 
 affinity existing betwixt this strip and the lactescent or- 
 gans of the animal, or the influence it exerts upon her 
 secretions, as necessarily controlling her health, or pro- 
 moting such condition as insures the property of deep and 
 enduring milking, or otherwise indifferent or bad milk- 
 ing. This influence is not pretended to exist by the 
 author of the "discovery." Then if it be not the cause, 
 it is incumbent that it should be shown, that these marks 
 are the signs or effects of the cause, impressed by the 
 workings of the vital and producing machinei-y of the 
 organs, which are made to reveal their capabilities on 
 this table or index, called the "mirror." But it were 
 impossible to establish either one or other of these prin- 
 ciples. Why palmistry that affects to tell the fortunes 
 of an individual by the lines on the palm of the hand, 
 may claim as much consideration, as the telling the good 
 or bad properties of the cow by the lines under her tail ! 
 The science of palmistry has the advantage, by being 
 more decent by far, than the science, which may aptly 
 be termed, "anusistry or anusism" — a new ww for the 
 philosophers! 

Is it not apparent to the most careless observer, that 
 the hair is given to the cow, and all other animals, for a cov- 
 ering and defence against the weather — that it is appor- 
 tioned in thickness and coarseness to places apporately in 
 proportion to the exposure each part of the body has to un- 
 dergo, from the muzzle to the tip of the tail ; that the Lair
