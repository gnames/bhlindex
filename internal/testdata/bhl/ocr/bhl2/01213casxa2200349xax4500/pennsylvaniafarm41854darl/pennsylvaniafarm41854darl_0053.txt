process goes on more rapidly. It is a nice point which 
 only close observation and attention can determine, how 
 much and how often food should be given. It should 
 not be allowed to accumulate, or it will become rancid 
 and offensive and spoil the appetite. A half hour at 
 feeding times, when the sashes may be raised to give 
 them a little exercise in the yard in fine weather, or 
 merely to open the shutters if the contrary, will give 
 them ample time to eat, pick up gravel, &c., any food 
 then left should be removed by drawing out the boxes 
 containing it, and which can be done from the yard 
 without disturbing the chickens. They should be made 
 to face with the weather-boarding on the outside, and 
 have a ring or loop to pull by. 

I vary the food constantly, never giving the same 
 twice successively. Small potatoes boiled, boiled oats 
 and Indian meal, a piece of cooked meat suspended from 
 the . rafters always accessible, milk to drink, and water 
 fresh every day, a heap of gravel, one of ashes, and 
 some charcoal, are my means of making poultry ready 
 for the mai'ket in two weeks from the time they are put 
 up to fatten. If longer than this time is required there 
 must be some mistake in the manngement. It should be 
 recollected that the sooner meat is put on a ftittening 
 animal, whether a steer or chicken, the more tender it is. 
 I place before my poultry all the materials for fattening 
 themselves, tempt their appetites by giving them varie- 
 tj', and keep them quiet and comfortable, as I have alluded 
 to. It is well known that the digestive process is soon- 
 er and easier finished during a state of rest. A chicken 
 f?hould have nothing to worry it, no anxiety of mind. 
 Could they anticipate their latter end, and the reasons 
 for our supplying them with the dainties of the land, 
 they would be held very tineasy, and I make it a point to 
 keep all such information from them. 

Jly chickens in the Pittsburg market bear a silent tes- 
 timony to the superiority of the above views, and are 
 caught up rapidly by purchasers. As they are unable to 
 make any noise about it themselves, please excuse j'our 
 subscriber and constant reader for thus contributing his 
 mite to the common stock. Your portraits of the thrif- 
 ty and thriftless farmer in last number are considered 
 the best things of the season, and are brought right 
 home to some in these parts. C. JACKSON.

 Outside Fainting. 
 People are not generally aware that paint exposed to 
 the weather, is far more durable if applied late in the 
 fall and during the winter, than at other times. Yet 
 such is the fact. A coat of paint applied in the winter 
 is at least equal to two put on in the summer. The rea- 
 sons are, that the oil is thicker and a greater quantity 
 is required to a given amount of paint; that it remains 
 on the surface, forming a hard enamel — if I may use the 
 term, instead of being quickly absorbed by wood, &c., 
 made porous by the heat ot the sun. To all who intend 
 having the outride of their houses painted the ensuing 
 season, I would say loose no time in having it done. You 
 will not then have the mortification of seeing your paint 
 ■washing off in a year or two by every rain, or soiling your 
 clothes like whitewash when rubbed against. 

The writer of this painted a house in December 1841, 
 with three good coats of white lead. It has never been 
 painted since, and at this time looks far better than one 
 painted equally well in June, 1849. S. P. R.

KEEPING POTATOES. 

Mr. Editor : — A short time back I dined with a 
 friend, upon whose table I found some extraordinary 
 good Irish potatoes. They were as fine as though they 
 had just been taken from the row. Desiring to know 
 how he kept them so fresh and fine, he informed me that 
 immediately after digging he packed his potatoes in 
 boxes sunk in the earth, and covered by a mound and 
 some corn fodder to keep out the frost, and surrounded 
 by a trench to draw off" the water. His boxes usually 
 contained three, four or five bushels, with a hole in them 
 four or five inches square, on which he set a board 
 chimney containing a flue about an inch square. This 
 could be lifted out, and thus made an opening for the 
 hand to reach in and take out the potatoes. Since 
 adopting this plan, as he informed me, his potatoes kept 
 unusualh' well, and were always fresh, totally unlike 
 the willed things kept in cellars and other places ex- 
 posed to the air. C. J. T. 

We have arrived at the same result by keeping our 
 potatoes in barrels in the cellar covered with a few sods

Mercer County Agricultural Society. 

Messrs. Editors: — In answer to your inquiry about 
 Mercer County Agricultural Society in the December No. 
 of the Farm Journal, we held our second annual exhi- 
 bition on the 19th and 20th of September (I send you 
 pamphlet containing the very able address delivered be- 
 fore the Society at its annual meeting by Mr. James 
 Gowen, Esq.) The society is in a very prosperous con- 
 dition, it was estimated near ten thousand person atten- 
 ded the last exhibition. The different departments were 
 generally very well represented. A considerable num- 
 ber of fine stock were on the ground, the Durhams 
 being most numerous. Some fine hoi'scs were also ex- 
 hibited, also quite a number of sheep, as this county does 
 a considerable business in wool growing. There was 
 also some good swine of the Berkshire and Byfield breeds. 
 Mr. Fell exhibited a herd of Buffaloes, a Bull and Cow 
 and two Heifers, that attracted considerable attention. 
 The first premium on wheat, the yield was 4',^ Ijushels 
 to the acre for two acres. I will now give a statement of 
 the condition of the society. They have lea.scd 5 acres of 
 ground for ten years, enclosed it with a close boai-d fence 
 erected sheds kc, the last year price of membersliip 
 is $1, that admits the person paying, and all his family 
 free. All ladies are admitted free and the Editors, prin- 
 ters, and their familes. The report of the society for 
 the last year is this.
