HOUSING STOCK. 

Mn. Editor : — Comparatively few farmers are aware 
 how much more food cattle exposed to the weather at 
 this season require, than when warmly housed or shel- 
 tered. At least such is the conclusion at which one 
 naturally arrives on observing the little attention paid to 
 the comfort of the "dry stock." Now it is a well as- 
 certained fact, admitted by all who have tried the ex- 
 periment, that the saving in food required by cattle 
 well sheltered from the cold and wet, over those exposed 
 to the elements, will considerably more than pay the in- 
 terest on the cost of the shedding, where the stabling is 
 insufficient. If, therefore, the sight of his shivering, 
 shrunk cattle, wading througli the mud, and striving for 
 every little sheltered nook in the yard, should not touch 
 the farmer's heart, let him observe the additional 
 amount of food required to satisfy the hunger of these 
 poor animals over those stabled, calculate the yearly 
 loss from his cruel custom, and another year will not be 
 likely to pass without amends being made. C.

WATERING CATTLE. 

Mb. Editor: — Among the many causes of stock not 
 thriving as much as might be desirable during the win- 
 ter, is their too scanty supply of water. A few have 
 running water in their cattle yards, and their stock 
 drink as nature requires it ; but most farmers water 
 their stock either by the pump, or by driving them to a 
 running brook twice, or often but once, a day. Water- 
 ing is done by rule from fall till spring, regardless of 
 weather or food. I have sometimes observed stock so 
 dry as to refuse to eat dry food, but after being watered 
 they eat it voraciously. Now it is a well settled fact 
 that no animal will thrive well while suffering for want 
 of food, water or shelter. Let those, therefore, who 
 want to turn out their stock in the spring in good condi- 
 tion, attend to these things, and let them see that the 
 poorer and weaker stock get as much as they want.

In addition to the remarks of our correspondent 
 above, we say also let them have constant access to salt. 
 They will then take it as nature prompts, and it will do 
 them much more good than when given only at stated 
 times. A lump of rock salt should always be kept in 
 the barnyard. What would a man think of having 
 a couple of handfulls of salt thrown down to him 
 once a week. It would neither satisfy the natural appe- 
 tite for it nor answer its true purpose, which is to be 
 used with the food and promote health and digestion. 
 "We have known salt fed in this way to cattle to disorder 
 the bowels. 

Plaster and Ammonia. 
 It has been generally considered that Gypsum or plas- 
 ter of Paris, when ground would absorb ammonia. The 
 Editor of the Rural New Yorker however, denies this un- 
 less, -"it be dissolved." The result of the following ex- 

periment of Professor Campbell of North Carolina will 
 go far in support of the popular belief, particularly as 
 almost every farmer has in a greater or less degree found 
 dry ground Plaster of Paris to be a most excellent and 
 thorough absorbent of Ammonia. 

"A barrel was filled with fresh scrapings from the stalls 
 of horses. Over the manure, as thrown in, a little ground 
 plaster was sprinkled from time to time. After the bar- 
 rel had been compactly filled, it was allowed to stand 
 some weeks until it had gone through the heating process 
 which always takes place when newly collectQd nianm-e 
 is thrown into heaps. But during this heating ov fermen- 
 tation (as it may with propriety be called,) there was none 
 of that 'vapor' or strong odor which ordinarily arises 
 from fermenting manure heaps. When the mass had 
 become cool, clean rain water was passed through it and 
 collected at the bottom of the barrel. This water was 
 found to contain one of the elements of plaster, and one 
 of the volatile substances (carbonate of ammonia) above 
 alluded to. On emptying the barrel, a white powder, 
 looking very much like plaster, was found mingled with 
 its contents. But when tested, this powder was found 
 to contain only one of the elements of plaster, while it 
 contained also one element of the volatile carbonate of 
 ammonia just mentioned." 

Cashmere Goats. 

The Southern Agriculturist states that Dr. Davis, of 
 Columbia, S. C, has a flock of Cashmere Goats, which 
 he is breeding with the common goats. The writer says:" 

"It is from the pile of this goat that all the commercial 
 'camel's hair shawls' are manufactured; it being finer than 
 the camel's turf, and superior to the Alpaca wool. These 
 goats readily cross with the common goats of the coun- i 
 try, and the fourth generation furnish wool equal to the I 
 full bred animals. The introduction of this animal is 
 destined to be of great value to the South, and in time 
 will fill our woods and mountain sides with flocks of hardy, 
 fine, fleece-bearing animals, whose products, with that of 
 Southern sheep, will eventually exceed many times in 
 value all the products of a similar character now affor- 
 ded by the flocks of the entire United States. The full bred 
 rams of the Cashmere goats were sold at $200 each." 

Premium Crop. 
 We see it stated that the Committee on Crops of the 
 Franklin County Agricultural Society have awarded the 
 first premium ($10) for the best crop of corn to Mr. 
 Robert Wallace, of Green township, in that county. 
 The amount farmed was five acres and eight perches, 
 which yielded 466 bushels of shelled com, or about 92 J 
 bushels to the acre ! This is an enormous yield, and Mr. 
 Wallace does credit to the "Green Spot" in the way of 
 farming.
