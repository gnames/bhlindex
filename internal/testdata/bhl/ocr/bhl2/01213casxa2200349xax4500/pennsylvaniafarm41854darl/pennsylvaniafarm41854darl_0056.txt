WOKK FOR THE MONTH. 

Farm. — This may be called the last leisure month 
 ■with the farmer, jjrevious to commencing active opera- 
 tions out of doors. But little more can be said than to 
 observe directions of last month. Have a full supply of 
 wood, to last during the whole season, cut up and stored 
 away, ready for use. Have all plows and other imple- 
 ments and tools examined and put in perfect order ; also 
 gears. Haul fencing materials where they are to be 
 used. Make daily use of the card on nil cows, calves, 
 and fattening animals. 

Fruit Ouchard. — Take off cuttings of gooseberries 
 and currants, and bury them § of their length in the 
 earth, till wanted for planting out: also quince cuttings, 
 grafts of apple, pear, plum, cherries, peaches, may now 
 be taken and preserved in damp saw-dust, or earth till 
 wanted. The two latter must be cut before any swell- 
 :'ing of the buds has taken place. Grafting the cherry 
 will not succeed unless performed very early. Budded 
 peach trees which have missed may be successfully side- 
 •grafted if the buds have not swollen. Mulch, during 
 -this month of comparative leisure, all young fi^uit trees. 
 •iPi'uning may now be attended to. Head down all apple 
 .-and other trees of worthless varieties which are for 
 -grafting and forming new tops. Leave some of the low- 
 • er branches for removal another season. If limbs are 
 ^^too large for grafting, the young shoots which will be 
 •thrown out, may be budded the following fall, or re- 
 served for grafting the following spring. Two seasons, 
 : at least, should be occupied in changing the heads of 
 Ua.rge ti-ees. A pole pruning-saw, pole-chisel, and pole 
 vpruning-shears, are necessary to perform this operation 
 'thoroughly. Cut out all inside shoots and branches, 
 \wiiich crowd the head, and are useless. Those limbs 
 wihich have free access to sun and air are the fruit-bear- 
 iing and productive ones. Branches should radiate from 
 the trunk, something after the fashion of an umbrella. 
 When large limbs are removed, coat the surface of the 
 wouiid with shellac dissolved in alcohol, to about the 
 consistency of paint. Go round every peach tree and 
 shorten m the last year's growth about one-third, with 
 the pole pruning-shears. This has been very fully 
 proven to result in larger and finer fruit, and may be 
 ;.applied to other trees beside the peach. Apply the wash, 
 Ibeforc recommended, to trunk and large limbs. Grape 
 'Vines should be pruned without delay. Trim gooseber- 
 iries and cuiTants, by cutting out old wood and branches 
 mear the ground, so as to give somewhat of the tree 
 ■shape. Cut off at ground old raspberry wood of last 
 year's bearing, and shorten in the new growth one-third. 
 'Leave only four or five stalks to each plant. Raspber- 
 ries must be well manured to be productive, and moved 
 "to a new place at least once in five yeai's. If frost 
 should be out of ground by last of month, strawberry 
 beds may be raked over, and short manure dug in be- 
 tween the rows. A good coat of ashes should be spread 
 over the whole bed. 

Flower G.^rden. — See directions for previous month. 
 Vegetable Garden. — Manures should now be com- 
 posted and prepared for frames. Turn over occasionally 
 to allow hot steam to pass off. From the middle to the 
 last of this month, frames may be set \\p, and some cab- 
 bage, lettuce, radish, tomatoes, egg-plant and pepper- 

seed sown for early planting. The two latter require 
 rather more heat than the others, and should have a 
 separate frame, and never allowed to become chilled. 
 Select a sheltered place for hot beds on the south side of 
 a building or tight fence. 

After seed is sown constant attention is required. 
 Cover with straw mats in nights and in cold weather, 
 and give air occasionally on fine days. 

Should it be necessary to let oft' steam, cover with 
 something to keep out cold, and prevent a check to bed 
 or plants. Radish and beet seed, early varieties, may 
 be sown on a rich warm border, in open ground, for 
 eai'ly use, as soon as frost is out of the ground. Cover 
 with straw in severe weather. 

By latter part of the month, extra early peas may be 
 planted in rows for early crop, and also potatoes. Rhu- 
 barb may be forced by covering plants with a barrel, 
 and filling up with manure. Continue to give air on fine 
 days to plants of last year's sowing, in cold and forcing 
 frames. 

By last of the month, if weather is open, fork in ma- 
 nure on asparagus beds, and give a plentiful dressing of 
 salt. 

Annual Meeting of the Pennsylvania State Agricultural 
 Society, 

The annual meeting of the State Agricultural Society as- 
 sembled in Ilarrisburg, agreeably to the requirements of its 
 constitution on Tuesday, the 17th of January. The meeting 
 was held in the Hall of the House of Representatives and 
 was attended by a large number of the sterling yoemonry of 
 the State. The utmost harmony and good feeling prevailed, 
 and a strong determination manifested to make it in all re- 
 spects worthy of the great intci-ests it was intended to pro- 
 mote. 

In the absence of the President, Judge Watts, A. R. Mc- 
 Ilvaine, Esq., was called to the chair. 

A committee consisting of Isaac G. McKinley, Algernon 
 S. Roberts, and A. M. Spangler, Esqrs., were appointed to 
 wait upon the Governor and the heads of departments to in- 
 vite them to be present during the meeting. 

H. N. McAllister, chairman of the committee on field 
 crops, stated that ho had presented the report of the com- 
 mittee to the Executive committee, and had been requested 
 by that committee to read it to the meeting. 

The report is as follows : 
 To the Executive Committee of the Pennsylvania State Agri- 
 cultural Society : — 

The Committee on Field Crops respoctfullj' report that the 
 following gentlemen were competitors : — 

Hamilton Vankirk, of AVashington county. Pa. ; John 
 McCord, of Bradford county. Pa. ; George Walker, of Sus- 
 quehanna county. Pa., and Benjamin Covert, of Fayette 
 county, Pa., for the premiums on Corn.

 Bradford county. Pa., for the premiums on Wheat. 

And James Sampson, of Erie county, Pa., and John

The several statements of these gentlemen of their modes 
 of cultivation, with the accompanying certificates as to the 
 product and measurement of the ground, are herewith pre- 
 sented and made part of this report. The Committee hav- 
 ing experienced some difficulty and embarrassment in 
 awarding and withholding premiums, deem it but just to the 
 competitors, the society and themselves, that the evidence 
 upon which they have decided should be made public.
