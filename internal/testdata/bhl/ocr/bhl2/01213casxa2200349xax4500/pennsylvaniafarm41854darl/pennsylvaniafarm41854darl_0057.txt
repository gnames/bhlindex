The published regulations of the Society in reference to 
 Field Crops are as follows : 

"Competitors for premiums for the above agricultural pro- 
 ductions must produce a full statement of the mode of culti- 
 vation, and accompany the same with a certificate of two 
 respectable men as to the product and measurement of the 
 ground, and also exhibit a sample of each crop at the annual 
 meeting in Ilarrisburg on the third Tues<lay of January 
 next, when these premiums will bo awarded." 

Does this rule allow the ascertainment of the product by 
 estimation from the measurement of a part or does it require 
 the actual measurement of the whole ? Samples are to be 
 exhi))it«d — certificates, <fec., produced at the annual meeting 
 in January, when the premiums are to bo awarded. The 
 crops are all gathered and housed, and the grains may all, 
 without inconvenience, be thrashed before the time at which 
 the certificates are required to be made. The best evidence 
 which the nature of the case reasonably admits of should be 
 produced. It seems, therefore, perfectly clear to the Com- 
 mittee that nothing less than actual measurement is a com- 
 pliance with the rule, and that independent of the rule 
 nothing le.-'S should be required. We are aware that a. dif- 
 ferent construction obtained with the Committee on Field 
 Crops a year ago, and this precedent created the only doubt 
 which existed in the mind of any member of the Commit- 
 tee. A moment's reflection, however, brought them unani- 
 mously to the conclusion that it is better to disregard than 
 to confirm a bad precedent, even though some of the exhibi- 
 tors may have been misled thereby. It maj' be very incon- 
 venient for the farmer to harvest, house, thresh and meas- 
 ure separately the exact quantity for which the premiums 
 are awarded ; but this is in no case necessary, as the Com- 
 mittee are of opinion that the actual measurement and as- 
 certainment of the quantity upon a larger number of acres 
 justly entitles the competitor to the premium on the smaller 
 number, if his average per acre exceeds that of the competi- 
 t-or who produces evidence only of the product of the exact 
 quantity. The product of twenty acres ascertained by ac- 
 tual measurement furnishes by average the strongest possi- 
 ble evidence of the product of any less quantity, whether that 
 q.'antity be five acres or one acre. AVhen, therefore, the 
 exhibitor, to enable himself to compete the more successfully 
 for the premiums, limits himself to the exact quantity, he 
 should not complain of inconvenience to which the regula- 
 tions of the Society do not necessarily subject him. 

Mr. Vunkirk claims to have produced the very extraordi- 
 nary yield of IS.Si bushels of shelled corn per acre upon five 
 consecutive acres, amounting to 766i bushels, and the claim 
 rests upon the certificate of two gentlemen that they meas- 
 ured J of one acre, being a fair average of five acres in afield 
 contAining more than five acres, and that they "husked it 
 and mensured a portion of the same," and that this made a 
 yield equal to 15SJ bushels. 

Mr. McCord having cut off his corn in a field containing 
 33 acres, the shocks ntunbered 39-4 — each shock having been 
 constituted of 36 hills, and two shocks having produced four 
 bushels of corn, he estimnten the whole quantity at 7S8 bush- 
 els of ears, and upon this estimate claims the premium for 
 one acre. It is true Mr. (luyer certifies that he "measured 
 all the corn raised on the SJ acres, and shelled it after dr3'- 
 ing six weeks in the crib, and the yield was 3485 bushels. 
 making 93 bushels to the acre" — but the rule is imperative in 
 requiring the certificate of at least tfro rcspoctnblc men. 

Mr. Walker, however, iaeasure<l and a.<cort;iincd the pro- 
 duct of the l-16i)th part of one acre prior to the 24ih day of 
 September, and by estimation, claims the premium for 
 having produced 155 bushels of shelled corn to the acre 
 upon a field containing five acres. 

If, in accordance with the rule prescribed, the product of 
 Jive acres of corn cannot be ascertained by estimation from 
 the measurement of the product of /ok;- acres, much less 
 can it be ascertained by the measurement of the product of 
 one-eighth of an acre; — 72 hills on the one hundred and six- 
 tieth part of one acre. 

Benjamin Covert, of Fayette county. Pa., is therefore the 
 only competitor, who seems to have complied at all with the 
 rule prescribed. He claims to have produced 158 bushels 
 and 7 quarts of shelled corn — pure j-ellow red cob gourd — 
 upon one acre of land — and of this extraordinary product 
 he produces the required proof by actual measurement. It 
 would however have been much more satisfactory that the 
 entire product had been shelled and measured a.s shelled corn 
 and especially that the time at which the measurement was 
 made had been specially stated. 

It is to be presumed, however, that the measurement was 
 made whilst the corn was comparatively green, and the 
 committee cannot but express the opinion that had the 
 product been suftered to dry, and been shelled and measured 
 in the grain, its quantity would have been considerably re- 
 duced. The yield, however, would still have been highly 
 creditable to the producer. The committee, therefore, 
 take great pleasure in awarding to Benjamin Covert, of Fay- 
 ette county. Pa., the premium of ten dollars. 

The competitors for the premiums on wheat the coiiiniittee 
 aro happy to report have complied fully with the regula- 
 tions of the Society. 

Mr. McCord seems to ckiim that his field, containing seven 
 ncre« and fiftxj two perches, should be reduced to six on ac- 
 count of the stumjjs and stones with which the surface 
 was partially covered, which is asking too much of a so- 
 ciety whose object is to encourage the farmer to render every 
 foot of ground productive. Taking the field, however, at 
 seven acres and fiifty-tvifo perches — the product, 354 bushels, 
 averages 50 bushels and 5 quarts to the acre by measure, 
 to which adding four pounds per bushel, as per certificate, 
 for overweight, and we have the surprising yield of 51V bush- 
 els per acre. The committee, however, weighed tlfe speci- 
 mens furnished the society, and ascertained that by pouring 
 the wheat from the bag into the half bushel cautiously, so as 
 not to touch or shake it, except in applying the strair/ht edf/e 
 to the surface, the wheat weighed 62J lbs. and that by shak- 
 ing the half bushel, so as to settle the wheat thoroughly it 
 weighed 66? lbs,; measured the ordinart/ icni/, and especial- 
 ly upon a barn floor the committee are of opinion it would 
 weigh sixty-four pounds. 

The committe therefore award to James McCord, of Brad- 
 ford county. Pa., the premium of twenty dollars for having 
 produced an average of 51^- bushels of white blue stem wheat 
 per acre upon a field containing seven acres and fifty-two 
 perches. 

They also award the premium often dollars to Amos Stone, 
 of Erie connty, Pa., for having produced 140 bushels of white 
 wheat by weight on 3i acres, being an average of 40 bush- 
 els per acre. The bushel on being tested by the committee 
 was of the same weight as that of Mr. McCord. 

The Committee award the premium often dollars to James 
 Sampson, of Erie county, Pa., for having jiroduced 334^ 
 bushels of barley weighing 48 II)s., per bushel, upon a field 
 containing seven acres and ninety-si.\ perches, being a yield 
 of 43J bushels per acre. 

The committee also award tlic premium of twenty <lollars 
 to John Iluthrauff of Franklin county, for having i)roduced 
 322 bushels of barley- weighing 48 lbs., upcm 6 acres and 
 112 jicrches, making an average of 53 l)ushels per acrce. 

The Committee most respectfully recommend that hereaf-- 
 ter the premiums on field crops be greatly enlarged. This
