adilitional inducement would seom to bo required to increase 
 the number of exhibitors so as to afford a fair indication of 
 the present cnpacity of the lands of the Commonwealth. 
 But when wo consider that the principal object of this So- 
 ciety is to increase that capacity — that this is the grand ul- 
 timate result at which wo aim in offering premiums for nu- 
 merous agricultural implements — for the best grains, seeds 
 and vegetables, et cetera — it would seem but reasonable and 
 just that we should offer such premiums for excellence in the 
 crops themselves, as to insure at future exhibitions a com- 
 petition worthy the vast resources of this groat agricultural 
 Commonwealth. The mechanic, the machinist, the produ- 
 cer of stock, the grower of fruits, and numerous other ex- 
 hibitors, are compensated by the increased demand which 
 the premium has created for his implement, machinery, 
 stock, fruit trees, and other articles, whilst the competitor 
 in "Field Crops" receives no pecuniary return for his time 
 and care in measuring hia ground, and in preparing and 
 furnishing evidence of its actual product, presenting speci- 
 mens, etc., except what he receives in the premium itself. 
 Wc desire to increase competition, and as the chances of 
 remuneration in t-he premiums are diminished in proportion 
 as competition is increased, the premiums offered should 
 greatly exceed mere remuneration, else they will fail to ac- 
 complish the end for which they are offered. 
 All of which is respectfully submitted.

 printed, together with evidence upon which it was based, 
 with the proceedings of the society. 

The Treasurer, George II. Bueher, Esq., made a report of 
 the financi.i] condition of the Society, showing the receipts 
 and expenditures of the past year, which was also unani- 
 mously adopted. From this report it appears the Society 
 has invested and in the Treasury the sum of $13,088 84.

On motion resolved, as tiie opinion of the Pennsylvania 
 State Agricultural Society, that the establishment, on a lib- 
 eral scale, of an institution with a model farm attiiched, 
 where the principles of a scientific cultivation of the soil, 
 and manual labor in that pi-rsuit, should bo joined by the 
 usual academic studies, would rank with the greatest benefits 
 to the agricultural interests of the commonwealth. 

Resolved, That this Society highly approve of the recom- 
 mendations of the Governor of the State, on the subject of 
 ■-auch nn institution, and earnestly urge upon the Legislature 

the importance of making provision by law at as early a 
 day as possible, for the establishment of the "Farmers 
 High School of Pennsylvania." 

The thanks of the meeting were unanimously tendered 
 to the House of Representatives for the use of the Hall, 
 and to the chairman of the meetinK. 

Transactions of the Middlesex County Agricultural So- 
 ciety. 

We are indebted to Simon Brown, editor of the New Eng- 
 land Farmer, for a pamphlet copy of the above for 1852, 
 handsomely printed and containing much valuable matter, 
 and reports relating to every department of farm business, 
 stock, cultivation, field crops, fruit, root culture, kc, togeth- 
 er with a list of the successful competitors for premiums at 
 the exhibition held .at Concord (we presume a state one), and 
 also an excellent address by Luther V. Bell. We extract 
 from among the reports two, on the cultivation of cranber- 
 ries and carrots. The Middlesex Society appears to have 
 been incorporated in 1803, and the Ji/t>/-eighth annual festi' 
 vnl was hold in Concord, Oct. 6th, 1852. 

This seems to conflict with the statement by Thomas Gold 
 to our friend W. H. Dillingham, of Philadelphia, in another 
 part of our Journal, that the Berkshire Society had the pri- 
 ority. Ho was one of its earlier Presidents, and wc pre- 
 sume meant that if not first in point of time, "it took pre- 
 cedence from its greater activity and energy, and was ac- 
 knowledged for this cause as the "parent one." "The 
 Massachusetts Society," he observes, "though of long stand- 
 ing, never were able to extend themselves beyond theories ; 
 they therefore honored us with the appellation of Parent 
 Society. During the period I was at its head, we furnish- 
 ed plans and instructions for numerous associations not only 
 in New England, but in New Ycrk, Connecticut, North and 
 South Carolina and Virsinia." 

The New England Farmer pays the following deserved 
 compliment to our artist, Edwaud Clarkson, for his two 
 admirable engravings — the thrifty and thriftless farmer — in 
 our last number : 

A GOOD HIT. 

The Pcniifiijlvania Farm Journal, published at West Ches- 
 ter, gives an excellent contrast between the thrifty and 
 thrift-/c»» farmer, in two engravings, opposite each other. 
 The picture on the left shows the nico and convenient farm 
 buildings, tastefully set off with shrubbery, shade trees, fine 
 fences, good gardens and roads, and .ill enlivened by the 
 most active industry of men and teams in the field. On the 
 right, not a shrub or shade tree is to be seen near the build- 
 ings. The roof of the bam is in waves, like a. troubled sea; 
 the weathercock is keeled over, while the doors look aa 
 though they had just come out of a dreadful spree and didn't 
 know which way to lean. Broken slabs, old wheels, tin 
 pots and cast off boots and us(jd up crockery, are scattered 
 in the door-yard. Emaciated cows aro mumbling away at 
 the hay stacks, while lank and haggard oxen are drinking 
 at a trough at the end of the house farthest from the barn, 
 and lean horses are collecting the scattered blades of grass 
 on the dreary looking pasture in the rear. The sheep, with 
 their backs all humped np, might stand "all fours" in a two 
 quart measvire. The foreground is embellished with the 
 skeletons of dead cows, pigs and poultry. The hogs have 
 just broken through the ricketty fence, which Tom is patch- 
 ing up, while Sam, club in hand, hangs on to the tail of a 
 long-nosed, lop-eared race-hog, which he is belaboring with 
 unmerciful blows. Tho bull-dog. Grip, has another by the 
 ear, whose direful squalliugs set thahens, tm-keys and geese 
 into a perfect flutter.
