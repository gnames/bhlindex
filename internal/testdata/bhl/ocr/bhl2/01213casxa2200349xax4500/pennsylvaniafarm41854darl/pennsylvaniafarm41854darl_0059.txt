To complete the picture, the lout-proprietor sits in the 
 piazza, perched on the hind legs of his chair, contemplating 
 the scene before him, and complacently listening to the re- 
 bukes of a woman who has popped her head out of a broken 
 window, just in time to sec the hogs destroy what few gar- 
 den vegetables were loft from former depredations. 

Your hit, Mr. Journal, is admirable — it is decidedly his- 
 torical, too. So were Hogarth's pictures, and told their 
 story to the public with as much directness and force as Ju- 
 nius or the Duuciad, and were felt as keenly as any of the 
 stinging sarcasms of cither. 

Hogarth would have found plenty of subject matter in 
 your picture on the right for one step in the Rake's Pro- 
 gress. Pass it along.

Agricultural and Horticultural Society of Monongahela 
 VaUey, 

Our friend Wm. Wickcrsliam writes us that an Agricul- 
 tm-al and Horticultural Society has been formed for the 
 valley of the ^Iononp;alicla, from parts of Allegheny, 
 Fayette, Washino;ton and Westmoreland counties. The 
 meetings are held at Monongahela City, and the society 
 bids fair to prosper. Those of our readers who know 
 anything of the valley of this noble stream know that 
 its bottoms are among the very riclicst in the countiy. 
 The hills bordering it are high and abrupt, containing 
 inexhaustible quantities of bitumous coal and limestone. 
 The soil on the hills is of an excellent quality and is 
 generally pretty much cultivated. The bottoms arc 
 far richer. What will our readers think when we 
 tell them that corn has been gi-own on portions of these 
 bottoms yearly ./o'" more than half a ccnluri/, without ap- 
 parently diminishing their wonderful fertility, and that 
 too without the hand of man applying a spadeful of ma- 
 nure ! Yet such is the fact. 

We shall be glad to hear from the officers of the so- 
 ciety.

Velocity of Hammering, 

Mr. Editor: — Many of your readers no doubt are in the 
 daily practice of using the hammer; perhaps few of them 
 have troubled themselves to ascertain the velocity with which 
 they are able to strike any material with the hammer. 
 From experiments made with hammers of various weights, I 
 have found the velocity not to exceed above 60 feet per sec- 
 ond; and that a velocity between fifteen and thirty feet per 
 second may, without much error, be considered the usual 
 velocity. J. S. G.

A Query for the Farm Journal. 

Suppose B, a farmer, when about to clean up his 
 wheat, should take a sample to C, who may be a miller 
 or the superintendent of a large school, and enquire if 
 he wishes to buy. C queries of him how much he ex- 
 pects to have? to which the farmer replies, that he 
 thinks he will have 500 or 600 bushels. If that is all, 
 answers C, I will take it, and if it should be as good as 
 the sample I will allow thee the fair market price. But 
 supposing the wheat is not I'eady for delivery sb.ort of 
 5 or 6 weeks from the time the agreement was made, and 
 in the mean time the price has changed to 50 cents more 
 or less than was the price at the time of agreement. AA'ill 
 the editor of the Farm Journal, or some of his corres- 
 pondents, please inform us which is to govern in this 
 case, the price at the time of delivery or the price at 
 the time of the agreement? 

I would not ask the above question if I did not know 
 that there was a difference of views on the sulyect, 
 and also that an open door had there been left for se- 
 rious misunderstanding, and as it is the proper office of 
 the peace makers to prevent as well as to heal difficul- 
 ties, a right solution of the question may do some good. 

We all know that the best way would be to guard 
 against any difficulty by having a clear understanding 
 at first ; but this is sometimes overlooked.

 ter, Esq., that the preliminary steps have been taken to 
 form an Agricultural and Horticultural Society in Ly-
