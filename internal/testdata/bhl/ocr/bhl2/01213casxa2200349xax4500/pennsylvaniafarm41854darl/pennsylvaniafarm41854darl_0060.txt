[February 

coming county ; a constitution having been adopted, 
 and a committee appointed to select officers for a per- 
 manent organization, to repoi-t in Williamsport at tlie 
 next meeting on the first Monday in February inst. 

With the incentives to excel, created by competing

 sister counties in the race for agricultural and horticul-

PROFITS OF FARMING. 

Coi.rMniA, Pa., Jan. 17th, 1854. 
 J. L. Darlington : — In the January niunber of "Farm 
 .Journal, page 12, you pidilish a ''report of tho Committee 
 on Pairies of the Chester County Agricultural Society." 
 The Committee .say, "they could not with justice close their 
 report without giving some of the details of the manage- 
 ment of the dairies examined." Now I think you will agree 
 with me, Mr. Editor, that it is much to be regretted that the 
 Comuiitteo did not give aU the details, or at least so far as 
 to give your readers .nn opportunity of making their own 
 calculations in regard to "profit and loss" — for after all, this 
 is tbe main thing worth knowing, supposing any one should 
 wish to embark in the .-ame business. 

The report says, "the amount of sales of tho Messrs. 
 Dickey was $21.38 39, expenses $287 70— leaving a balance 
 of $1850 RO ! !" From a superficial examination the reader 
 might be led to believe that this balance was all profits ! 
 Had the Committee ineUided in their report the feed con- 
 sumed by these 40 head of cows — the salaries paid for help 
 — to feed, to milk, to tend — the wear and tear of fixtures, 
 utensils- — -the depreciation of the value of tho cows from 
 sickness, old age and death, &c., — I apprehend the balance 
 would have been materially reduced. 

Such imperfect statements are calculated to mislead, and 
 are of no manner of use to the public — merely filling up the 
 pages of the Journal to the exclusion of more valu.able mat- 
 ter. How many statements, similar to the above, do we see 
 published time and again in the many agricultural journals 
 — on the different branches of agriculture — by committees 
 as well as individuals ? Some theorists in their closets will 
 take hold of these statements, examine, transcribe and com- 
 pare with other pxirsuits, and with a little coloring of their 
 own, give a picture of a farmer's life — greatly in favor of 
 the latter — making it appear (on paper) that the farmer's 
 business was all profits and no loss ! 

Wo occasionally see a person of this order leaving tho 
 towns or cities, where he has become heartily tired of reali- 
 zing his 10 or 12 per cent, and going into the country to be- 
 come a farmer. Here he intends "to sit under his own vine 
 and fig tree," and expects hero, at least, "there will be none 
 to make him afraid," (discount day may probably not annoy 
 him quite so frecpiently in the country as in tho city,) his 
 calculations and prospects based on the great profits of farm- 
 ing, which he has noticed in tho agricultural publications. 
 Without knowing the drawbacks, the expenses, the failures, 
 the short crops, and tho many other casualties incident to, 
 or bearing on, the profit of a tiller of the soil, and instead 
 of making his 10 or 12 per cent, without risk or trouble, 
 generally finds himself, as the saying is, "coming out at tho 
 little end of the horn" at the end of tho year, heartily tired 
 of the labor, the drudgery and slavery of a farmer's life. 

Now if such statements as have been the occasion of call- 
 ing forth these remarks would give «// the items bearing 
 on the subject, such disappointments need not so often oc- 
 cur, and tho farmers would be relieved from, at least in part, 
 tho many observations by men in other pursuits, that "tho 

farmer is the only independent member of society," that 
 "the grass grows while he sleeps," that "his income is all 
 clear profit." &c., &c. 

And "hereby hangs a tale" from which we might fill an- 
 other half sheet, but it is not our purpose to dilate on this 
 subject at present further than to say, that provided, as our 
 law makers have it, the State needs more funds for ordinary 
 and extraordinary expenses, these statements of great pro- 
 fits are a strong inducement for the "powers that be" to am- 
 plify the wealth, the prosperity and remunerative invest- 
 ments of our rural population, and our prosperous farmers 
 can bear a trifle more depletion for tho benefit of tho Com- 
 monwealth. J. B. G.

Mapes' Superphosphate of Lime. 

Mr. Editoe: — As you solicit facts and experiments from 
 any of your readers in farming operations, I am willing to 
 throw in my mito to the general good, by stating that in the 
 spring of 185.3, I sold to Jesse C. (Jreen, of this place, two 
 acres of land, situate on New street, north of the Borough 
 of AYest Chester. Part of it was a fresh clover sod, for 
 which he purchased of Pasehall Morris & Co., Professor 
 Mapes' Superphosphate of Lime, and applied at tho rate of 
 300 lbs. to the acre. So astonishing was the result, that in 
 three weeks time you could see the difference between it 
 and the adjoining portion, precisely of the same character, 
 at the distance of a mile, and at mowing time it produced 
 double the quantity of hay. Yours respectfully, 

AYost Chester, Jan., 1854. ENOS SMEDLEY.

Osage Orange Hedge. 

Mr. Editor: — As the subject of fencing is claiming much 
 attention among the farmers of Pennsylvania, I thought a 
 few remarks on hedging might not be out of place. When 
 we consider the growing scarcity of timber and the high 
 price of rails, commanding even now in many places, par- 
 ticularly near our borough, from six to ten dollars per hun- 
 dred, induces the enquiry what shall be found and used 
 as a substitute ? 

It is found that the Washington or Virginia thorn does 
 not now suit our climate, and in spite of the cutting and 
 twisting which it had to bo subject to; on account of it branch- 
 ing so sparsely at the bottom, there always would remain 
 holes sufiiciently large for tho egress of hogs, lambs and 
 poultry, &o. In my opinion we have found that sub- 
 stitute in the Osage Orange plant. A hedge of these if right- 
 ly managed, in three or four years, will make a fence impen- 
 etrable against all kinds of stock. Some of our farmers 
 have i^rocurod the seed to plant, but in consequence of being 
 boiled by unprincipled venders to get the seedovit more read- 
 ily they did not germinate. 

The better way is to procure the plants, which can be had 
 at almost any of our nurseries, you then save at least two 
 years, which in a fast growing fence is quite an object. If 
 tho farmer is at first doubtful of its efficiency let him pro- 
 cure two or three thousand plants, and put these out for a 
 trial; and my opinion is, that he will be so far satisfied with 
 tho experiment, as to replace his rail fence (though good) 
 with hegdes as soon as he can. 

The preparation of tho ground can bo carried on any time 
 through tho winter, when the weather will admit of its be- 
 ing dug; cover tho space where you wish to plant the hedge, 
 say three or four feet wide, well with short manure or com- 
 post, then dig it up as deeply as the spado will permit break- 
 ing the clods and making it quite mellow, when the time 
 arrives for pl.anting which will be about the first of April, 
 stretch a line of convenient length and dig out the trenob
