 TOOL HOUSE. 
 "A nepnrate place for each thing, and every thing in its place." 
 "All raiiKod in order, and disposed with grace, 
 Shape marked of each, and each one in its place; 
 Nor this alono the cu-ious eye to please, 
 But to be found, when'eer required, with case. 
 If used or loaned, and not returned by rule, 
 The vacant shape will show the missing tool ; 
 Thus often nr<^ed the careless will improve. 
 And rules of order soon will learn to love." 
 The Tool House, of which drawings are published in the 
 present number of the Journal, is at the summer residence 
 of a citizen of Philadelphia, located in this county. The 
 building is 20 feet long by 12 feet wide, and is lined with 
 smooth boards. The plates are an exact representation of 
 the building and its interior arrangements, with a few slight 
 exceptions ; and notwithstanding there are about 200 tools 
 or implements upon its walls, yet the number may be' con- 
 siderably increased by filling up the vacant spaces with 
 smaller articles, as there may be occasion. The tools are 
 well secured in their places, and yet may be taken down or 
 put up with ease. They are supported by means of nails, 
 iron hooks of different sizes (such as are used by plumbers), 
 stout iron staples, both flat and round, and lighter ones made 
 of wire with the ends sharpened, and of size proportioned to 
 the weight of the tool. 

The shape of e.ach article is marked upon the wall, with a 
 small stiff brush and ink, and the tools being upon the sides 
 of the building leaves the floor free for other purposes. 

Their methodical arrangement, and the shape of each be- 
 ing distintly marked, combines advantages as to economy of 
 sp.ace and security against loss, which could not perhaps be 
 so well attained by any other mode, and it is believed to be 
 the secret of causing things to keep in their places. 

The writer, with whom the idea of m.arking out the shape 
 originated, has had the plan in operation in various forms 
 for m.TJiy years, and always with satisfactory results, and 
 the illustrations are presented to the reader in the hope that 
 it may lead others to its adoption. 

We need not remind the farmer how important it is that 
 every one should have a work shop. A place where his 
 tools may be neatly and conveniently arranged, and safely 
 kept, and where those in his employ may occupy their leis- 
 ure time pleasantly and profitably. 

Carefulness is often the result of early training, but indo- 
 lence lies at the foundation of carelessness. Other things 
 being equal, the careful man is generally the prosperous 
 one, while carelessness and thriftlessness being nearly allied 
 always lead to loss, and frequently to disastrous results. 
 Hence the importance of encouraging in youth habits of 
 order, of carefulness, and of continuous useful industry. 

Some who are borrowers are habitually neglectful in re- 
 turning. Of these it has been humorously said, that "it was 
 trouble enough for them to borrow." In the arrangement of 
 tools as recommended, the v.aluo of the principle of associa- 
 tion is forcibly illustrated, and perhaps there is no mode so 
 efi'eetual in impressing the necessity of returning borrowed 
 articles. 

"Signs which address the ear .are lost and die 
 In one short hour, but that which strikes the eye 
 Lives long upon the mind. The faithful sight' 
 Engraves the knowledge with a beam of light." 
 If, therefore, when a tool is loaned, the shape of it is seen 
 distinctly marked in the place from which it is taken, it 
 makes an impression upon the mind of the borrower, 
 which is increased by a recollection of the fact that it will 
 act iis a tell-tale, and will not cease its importunities until 
 its demand for the return of the article is satisfied. 

It requires a little eflTort to carry the plan into efi'ect. But 

what that is valuable can be accomplished without it? To 
 the energetic mind there is a pleasure in overcoming difficul- 
 ties, and any one who will adopt the plan, however rude or 
 imperfect may be the arrangement, will find a virtue in it 
 in the preservation of his tools, and in promoting habits of 
 good order beyond his expectations. Every one is an ex- 
 ample to others for good or for evil, and he who has the 
 resolution to make even one step forward may render im- 
 portant services in his neighborhood. 

The writer would venture another suggestion. In every 
 kind of business, there are details often neglected for want 
 of being thought of at the proper time. To remedy this it 
 is recommended that a slate or pasteboard card, with a pen- 
 cil and a piece of India rubber attached, bo hung in the 
 shop, spaced and arranged under the proper head, so as to 
 show what special duties are to be performed, and by whom 
 to be attended to when at leisure. 

If the principal would carry with him a small book, com- 
 posed simply of two pieces of pasteboard, also spaced and 
 ruled, and in it note each matter out of the common order of 
 business, iis it occurred to him, that required attention, and 
 at convenience transfer them to the shop memor.andum, to 
 be there re.ady for suitable occasions, he would find it would 
 insure the prompt performance of m.any small duties liable 
 to be forgotten, the accumulation of which is often more 
 burthensome to the mind of a business man than those of 
 larger moment. MIQUON. 

N. B. — Previous to affixing the tools to the wall, the size 
 of the space to be occupied should be m.arked out upon the 
 floor, and the arrangement first made there. Some article 
 should be selected as a starting point or centre, around which 
 the others should be placed so as to produce a sj'mmetrical 
 efiect. If not at first satisfactory, change the position of 
 some, or all — arrange and re-arrange them, till thej' meet 
 approval. 

The ink for marking should be a little thickened, and 
 spread upon a slate or other smooth surface to prepare it for 
 use, as the lines should be made dark and distinct. A litlie 
 chalk rubbed upon the place to be marked will cause ir to 
 receive the ink without difficulty.

^Ir. Editor: — -I have just read some remarks hy >.'r. 
 .Tames Gowcn of Mount Airy, upon most of the v;niiii;s 
 races of cattle known in this country; and regret to 
 find that he has emptied the vial of his wrath upon 
 the devoted heads, of the ill formed, hide bound, (loat 
 akin, rictcety Aldernies," denouncing them as unfit for 
 the farmer and the butcher, as yielding very little milk, 
 furnishing straw colored butter, instead of yellow tinged 
 with "couleur de rose," &c. &e. 

Experienced as Mr. Gowen may be, and no doubt is, 
 with Shorthorns, it is very evident that he knows little or 
 nothing about the valuable animal he has so swecpingly 
 and unhesitatingly condemned, that jo?v;Mcf/cf, instead of 
 of reason, has so guided his pen and controlled his feel- 
 ings, as to render him incapable of forming a just esti- 
 mate of the merits of the animal in question. 

The wi-iter of this article has been perfectly familiar with 
 Alderney stoclc, for the last thirty years, has sojourned 
 for weeks at diiferent periods in the Islands of Guernsey 
 and Jersey, in the English channel, has travelled all over 
 them, and examined, critically, the character and points 
 of the cattle of each island, about which the inhabitants 
 have had from time immemorial, bitter and interminable 
 disputes — the Jerseymen contending theirs to be the
