best, and the Gueruseymen, with equal pertinacity, main- 
 taining the superiority of their own, whilst the unpre- 
 judiced stranger declares he can perceiA'e no difference 
 between them, botli being equally good. 

In opposition to Mr. Gowen's sentiments, it may be 
 rem.arked, that from the earliest periods down to the pres- 
 ent time, the best judges of cream and butter in all parts 
 of the world have awarded the palm to Alderney cows. 
 Why is it, that throughout England, Ireland and Scot- 
 land, the noblemen and gentry, the owners often of large 
 herds of Durhams and Devons, always have one or two 
 of these "rickety ffoatakins^' about their parlor windows 
 for their own use? Because they are well aware of the 
 superiority of their cream and butter over those of every 
 other cow. If otherwise wliy are the products of their Dc- 
 vons and Shorthorns sent to market, and not consumed 
 at their own luxurious and expensive tables? Why does 
 the cream from Alderney dairies in the vicinity of Lon- 
 don bring a higher price than any other cream ? Be- 
 cause it is thicker, richer, yellower and better than any 
 other cream? Mr. Gowen would say, this preference 
 "can be traced to some freak of fashion." Fashion, no 
 doubt, exercises a powerful influence upon the outer man 
 and woman, in the shape of garments and trinkets, but 
 the great inside pocket, the stomach, the seat of taste 
 and even of intellect in the millions, commonly revolts 
 sooner or later at unsavory viands and would soon de- 
 clare war, in spite of fashion, aganst thin and watery 
 cream and white insipid butter. AVhy did !Mr- Gowen's 
 quondam neighbor, the late Philip Physick, Esq., obtain 
 for twenty years in succession the premium for Alderney 
 butter at the cattle show of which Mr. G. is a promi- 
 nent member, over all other competitors, over every pound 
 of butter made from Shorthorns and Devon's and Hol- 
 stein, and native cows? Because the judges Avei-e influ- 
 enced by fashion, and were not as capable of judging of 
 the quality and color and taste of the numerous speci- 
 mens of butter presented for competion as Mr. Gowen, 
 who probably acting upon the principle of the juror, told 
 the court that he himselfwas perfectly satisfied, but eleven 
 obstinate fellows on the jury decided against him. Why 
 will Alderney butter now and at any cattle show in the 
 United States, obtain a premiiim over any other butter 
 however well worked and printed, in spite of its straw 
 color and deficiency of rosy hue? Because it is firmer, 
 sweeter, of a deeper yellow color and more grateful to 
 the palate in every way, whether salted or not salted, 
 than any other butter. But does Mr. Gowen really and 
 truly mean to affirm that Alderney butter is of a light 
 yellow or utraiv color, and does he seriously, or jesting- 
 ly avow that he, or any one else, ever saw butter the 
 color of a rose? The truth is, the great peculiarity of 
 Alderney butter so far as color is concerned, is the deep 
 orange or saffron color pertaining to it, a color peculiar 
 to it in winter as well as summer, independent, in a great 
 measure, of the food consumed by the cow, and equal at 
 all times to other butter made in May or June, wlien 
 cows are fed upon grass. So uniform and constant is 
 this deep yellow tint that it is almost impossible to per- 
 suade dairymen and marketmen themselves that it is not 
 colored â€” men who if they are honest, will acknowledge 
 that thej' all color, with annetta, and other articles, du- 
 ring the winter their butter made from common cows. 

If yellow butter, therefore, artificially colored, will 
 bring a better price in market than white butter, as all 
 marketmen well know, why should not butter, ceteris 
 paribus, colored by the cow, do the same, and why should 
 such cows be unprofitable to the farmer? In truth 
 every man who is /)rac/?crt/(!/, and not theoretically, ac- 
 quainted with the character of Alderney cattle, well 
 knows that the milk of a single full bred cow of that 
 breed will color the milk of 7 or 8 common cows. This 
 alone should be an inducement to farmers to possess 
 Alderney stock, independently of other considerations, 
 which might if necessary be easily enlarged upon. 

Mr. Gowen strongly intimates that an Alderney cow 
 gives very little milk, comparing her with common 
 road cows, that do the same thing. Now it is well known 
 that_a fine Alderney cow will yield 12 or 14 quarts of 
 milk a day, and that a large portion of that milk is con- 
 vei'ted into cream, which cream, in many instances, will 
 furnish 12 or 14 lbs. of butter a week. In extraordinary 
 instances 19 or 20 lbs. of butter a week have been made 
 from a single Alderney cow, or "rickctfy goat akin." 
 Will an enormous Durham, which consumes as much 
 hay or grass as an elephant, though she may yield 20 or 
 30 quarts, do any more? Admitting that she makes the 
 same amount of butter or more, which is the most pro- 
 fitable to the farmer, the great consumer of food or the 
 small one? We once stepped from curiosity into Pihoad's 
 great milk establishment at Islington, near London, and 
 saAv 999 cows, all of the Short-Horn Durham stock, un- 
 der diff"erent sheds. Upon asking the proprietor why he 
 preferred these animals to Devons and other stock, he 
 candidly replied, '"because I sell milk, and Durhams give 
 a larger quantity of their blue milk than any other cows, 
 and I can swear I don't water it. If," he continued, "I 
 wished to make butter T should select Aldernies or De- 
 vons." It is not calculated by these remarks to under- 
 value Durhams. Some of them it is known yield very 
 rich milk and a large amount of butter. But they are 
 "few and far between." Durhams, however, are objec- 
 tionable upon other grounds, and as IMr. Gowen proba- 
 bly alludes to them, when he speaks of "large, healthy 
 and fine animals," tliere can be no impropriety in stating 
 that a Durham is an artificial animal, very subject to 
 disease and peculiarly lialjle to consumption, especially 
 in this climate. This position could be abundantly for- 
 tified if necessary, and it is only mentioned as an ofi"set 
 to Mr. Gowen's assertion or insinuation that an Alder- 
 ney is delicate in constitution and liable to disease. This 
 is very far from being the case, so far from it indeed as 
 to be remarkable for their hardiness and freedom from 
 disease, and standing the cold of our -winter, and sum- 
 mer, as well as native stock. Mr. Gowen has stigmatised 
 Aldernies as "under sized, ill formed, and such hard 
 feeders that is impossible to get beef on them." 

A genuine thoroagh bred Alderney cow is not much, if 
 any, smaller than a common cow of native stock. The 
 "mouse colored" cow, so commonly considered by him 
 and by farmers throughout Bucks and Chester and other 
 counties of Pennsylvania as "Aldernies," have not a par- 
 ticle of Alderney blood in their composition. They are 
 commonly diminutive and mouse like it is true, but their 
 skins and udilers are white, their horns and tails thick, 
 marks perfectly indicative of their blue milk and white
