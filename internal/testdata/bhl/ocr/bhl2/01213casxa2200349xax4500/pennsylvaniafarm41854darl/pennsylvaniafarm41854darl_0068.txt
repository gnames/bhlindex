butter. As to the impossibility of getting beef upon 
 them, this is a gross mistake and altogether at variance 
 with the best European writers on cattle, even those 
 that object to Aklcrnies upon other gi-ounds, It is, on 
 the contrary, conceded by almost every one that they 
 fatten easily, and in a very short time are ready for the 
 butcher. That an Alderney is an ill formed and un- 
 sightly animal is admitted by most writers to be true ; 
 and yet these allegations ought to be received in a re- 
 stricted sense. It must be conceded, for instance, that 
 the (Old ensemble is disagreeable, and well calculated to 
 produce, at first sight especially, unpleasant reflection, 
 but when wo come to analyse individual points and dwell 
 upon conformation and expression, we are forcibly struck 
 with the sj'mmetry and proportion of numerous parts. 
 Whei-e shall we find, for example, a more bright, intelli- 
 gent and sparkling eye, filled at the same time with soft 
 and dreamy mildness. Look, again, at the small deli- 
 cately formed head and dished face, the small curved 
 horns, the neat, narrow, well proportioned ear, peculiar- 
 ly set on, and capable of being thrown by the animal 
 backwards and nearly parallel with the neck. Observe 
 the smooth, soft gloss and velvet like skin, the color of 
 saffron or gamboge, the long, very slender and tapering 
 tail, the thin, flat, deer-like legs, the large abdomen, a 
 sure indication of health and nutriment in all animals, 
 tlie uncommordy conspicuous milk veins, their unwonted 
 length, the size of gun barrels, the beautifully formed, 
 capacious udder, feeling and looking when cleanly milk- 
 ed out like a buckskin bag. Finally look at the step 
 and action of the animal, almost as quick and firm and 
 gi*aceful in its carriage or movement as a race horse. 
 But what have we to do with symmetry and beauty in a 
 cow. Do they conti-ibute to the secretion of milk ? On 
 the contrary all fat, round, well turned, closely filled up 
 cows are poor milkers ; their nutriment is converted into 
 fat and flesh, they are sluggish and ungainly in their 
 movements, and are better fitted for the knife than the 
 dairy. 

This comnmnication might be easily extended to a 
 greater length, but shall be closed for the present by an 
 extract from the work of the late Henry Coleman, well 
 calculated to present in an unfavorable light all Mr. 
 Growen has advanced on the subject : 

*'0f all the cows which I ever saw," says Mr. Cole- 
 man, "the handsomest — that which gave the best promise 
 of being what a cow should be — was an Alderney, or 
 rather, improved Guernsey cow, brought from one of the 
 Channel islands, and shown at the meeting of the Royal 
 Agricultur.al Society at Southampton. She was rising 
 two years old, of moderate size, compact and well 
 shaped, of that yellowish dun color which generally 
 characterises the breed, with a large and golden udder, 
 ear of an orange color in the inside, a clean and thin 
 neck, and the bright eye of a gazelle. They are valued 
 mostly for their milking properties, and not so much in 
 that respect for the quantity as for the extraordinary 
 rich and creamy quality of their milk, in which certain- 
 ly they surpass all other breeds. It is said that no ani- 
 mals will thrive faster when well fed, when off their milk, 
 and their size is not always inferior. I found at Wal- 
 beck, the residence of the Duke of Portland, a herd of 
 Alderney cows of the size of ordinary cows, and in good 

condition. Few gentlemen or noblemen in England, 
 resident in the country, are without one or more Alder- 
 ney cows for the supply of their tables with cream and 
 butter, and I never had the slightest difiBcultyin instant- 
 ly recognising their produce. They are kept, in some 
 proportion, at some of the large dairies in England for 
 the purpose, by mixing their milk with that of the cows _ 
 of a different breed, of giving color to the butter and 
 richness to the cheese. It is objected to their beef that 
 the fat of it is too deeply yellow, but otherwise it is of 
 excellent quality. Two oxen of this breed fattened by 
 Sir Charles Morgan, weighed alive, the one one thousand 
 six hundred and ninety pounds, the other otie thousand s.z 
 hundred and fifty pounds." 

To all which what will Mrs. Grundy say?

The American Handbook of Ornamental Trees. 

BY THOMAS Ml.EHAX, GAUUEXEll. 

A small work of 250 pages, duodecimo, under the 
 above title has just been issued by Lippencott, Gi'au\bo 
 & Co., of Philadelphia. It supplies a vacuum which has 
 long been wanted, is sufficiently scientific for all useful 
 purposes, and we think exactly adapted to the require- 
 ments of the present times. It will doubtless have a 
 wide circulation. Over three hundred trees and shrubs 
 are enumerated in it, with a description of their native 
 habitat, botanical character, mode of growth, habits, and 
 soil most congenial, together with the method of propaga- 
 tion. The proper grouping and arrangement of trees, 
 with respect to color, shade and contrast, to which but 
 little attention, has been paid as yet in this country, is 
 also treated of, together with the proper season, and cor- 
 rect mode of transplanting, prxining, &c. 

On looking over the work we have been surprised at 
 the amount of information contained in such a compass, 
 and cordially recommend it to every one who has ground 
 to be planted, either in town or country. The authors 
 extensive experience, both in this country and in Eu- 
 rope, as a practical gardener, has made him familiar 
 with every tree and shrub he has described, and with the 
 exception of the experienced Botanist who delights in 
 refined and extended technicalities, the work contains all 
 that is wanted to be known by 99 people out of a 100. 
 The Botanical and common names are both given, with 
 a short Botanical description, with the classes and orders 
 of both the Linncan and natural system, an index ac- 
 companies, and an appendix of plants but recently in- 
 troduced. Persons remitting seventy-five cents, to the 
 author, Holmesburg, Pa., will receive the work by mail 
 free of Postage. 

We extract the following excellent observations on the 
 Choice of Trees. 

For shade trees it is considered advantageous to po.ssess 
 the property of transplanting easily. This is a great reason 
 why certain trees become so popular in some districts as to 
 give them a character. But. in reality, there are no trees 
 difficult to transplant. AVhen the true principles of the 
 operation are understood, a beech may be trimpjilanted as 
 easily as an aihvnthus, or a sourgum as a maple. This I 
 hope to make plain to the reader as we proceed. 

In choosing trees, prefer tho.se raised in a nursery to those 
 growing naturally in the woods. MoJt persons are aware 
 of the difficulty of getting the latter to do well. A glance 
 at the nature of roots will teach us the reason. There are 
 two sets of roots to most trees, perhaps to all. One consists
