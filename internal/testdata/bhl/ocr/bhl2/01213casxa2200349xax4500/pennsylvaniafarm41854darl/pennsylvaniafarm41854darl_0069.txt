of fibrcD, the sole office of which is to draw matter from the 
 soil for the use of the tree ; the other of inie roofs, which 
 extend and keep the tree in its position, affording at the 
 same time channels for the conveyance of the matter alisor- 
 bod by tlie fibro?. This distinction must be well noted. Fi- 
 bres, as I have repeatedly proved, are ainnial. dying out af- 
 ter a season's service. New fibres make their ap])earanee as 
 the extendiug roots grow; and are. consequently, farther 
 aw.ay from the collar of the tree in proportion to its age. 

The roots of trees have their peculiarities of divarication 
 as well as the branches. Some trees grow erect, or hori- 
 zontal, making few side shoots, and looking always sparse 
 and thin; others branch and rebranch in every direction. So 
 it is with their roots. The sour-gum throws out a few strong 
 roots, scarcely nmking a single fork, while the linden throws 
 out an adundance of rootlets in every direction. If we at- 
 tempt to take up a specimen of the former by the common 
 practice, that is, by opening a trench but a few feet from 
 the trunk, wo fiml that though wo may have a great miiny 
 roots, we have very few or no Jib ret. They are left with the 
 roots in the ground, at their extremities. Such a tree is re- 
 duced to the condition of a mere cutting, and without the 
 treatment proper for a cutting cannot grow. Trees taken up 
 by the same mode, that have an abundance of branching 
 roots are more likely to have fibres near the stem and so suc- 
 ceed. This constitutes the chief difTerence between a tree 
 that will "remove easily" and one which will not. 

It should be an early inquiry whether a tree proposed to 
 bo transplanted have the above mentioned conditions of suc- 
 cess or not. A tree from a nursery has been transplanted 
 when very young, perhaps several times. The repented cut- 
 tings off of the young roots cause them to branch out nu- 
 merously, attended, of course, by an abundance of fibres. 
 That is exjictly the tree for the planter. Trees from the 
 woods will bo in a worse case. When they are ])articularly 
 desired, there are two ways of procedure. We may dig 
 out a space two feet deep, at from four to six feet from the 
 trunk of the tree, according to its size, which will cut all 
 the roots to that depth. Immediately replace the earth, into 
 which they will fibre. The following year the tree may 
 be removed with safety. In the other ease, the roots should 
 be followed to their extremities, the fibres gathered togeth- 
 er carefully, and rolled up with the roots towards the trunk 
 of the tree, where they can be protected from injury. The 
 ball of earth on which so much care is given to cultivated 
 trees, is of little importance in this case. There being but 
 few fibres at the base, the ball can be of slight service, while 
 it materially adds to the expense, and is actually a draw- 
 back by rendering the tree more unmanageable. 

In these two modes of removal, success greatly depends 
 upon the operator; a careful, persevering, determined hand, 
 performs more and with better results, than a hasty, unde- 
 cided, and unpractical individual. The latter mode, in the 
 right kind of hands, will give the most satisfaction in the 
 end. 

Wonders of the California Vegetable World. 

Dr. Gibbons, of San Francisco, speaks thus of the Agri- 
 cultural Fair lately held in that city : 

On entering the room you are struck with the tasteful de- 
 corations and the profusion of plants, many of which are 
 rare and beautiful. On the table are several varieties of 
 squashes, the largest of which weighs 21 pounds ; onions 
 weighing 4 pounds, and measuring 22 and 23 inches in cir- 
 cnmference ; beets .36, 38, 49, and even 51 pounds — several 
 of the long v.ariety, one of which measures 2 feet and 8 
 inches, to which another foot may be added for the missing 
 extremity, which appears to have been pulled through by 
 the antipodes; sweet pot.atoes from San Jose, 12 and 13 in- 
 ches long, 8 weighing 20 pounds; carrof.s 5, 8 and 10 pounds, 
 and turnips raised to order of any size called for ! The 
 most striking feature, however, is the potatoes, specimens of 
 which weighing 4 pounds, and measuring a foot or more in 
 length, have been sent from all directions, San .Jose, Santa 
 Cruz, Alameca, Oakland, &c. There are 72 bushels or 700 
 pounds, the potatoes raised at San Jose. Ii is a remarkable 
 fact that this vegetable requires no cultivation in any part 
 of California. The seed is planted with<mt manure, and not 
 a plough or hoe touches the field till the crop is gathered. 
 These large potatoes are always of the best quality and nev- 
 er hollow or false-hearted. In the vicinity of Santa Cruz 
 the potatoe has been attacked by an insect, which enters at 

the eyes and burrows through the tuber destroying it. The 
 appearance of this insect is an evil omen. 

Some ten or twelve varieties of wheat are exhibited, the 
 growth of California and Oregon, some of which produce 
 sixty to seventy bushels an acre : weight sixty-five pounds 
 per bushel. One specimen of barley is exhibited as part of 
 a crop of one hundred and forty-nine bushels to the acre. 
 OatvS nine feet four inches high, and one specimen ten feet 
 seven inches. The specimens of flour are very interesting. 
 They are from various quarters of California and equal in 
 quality to the celebrated brands of Gallego and Ilaxall. 

Among the fruits are grapes. A common weight of the 
 clusters being five and six pounds; delicious sugar peara 
 many of which exceed one pound — cluster of four on astern 
 weighing seven pounils from San .lose. Pound pears, tho 
 largest weighing two pounds, and AVashington pears of un- 
 common size and beauty. Apples from Oregon and Califor- 
 nia, one of which is twelve inches in circumference; three 
 apjdes from a single graft, one year old, from San Jose. 
 Pearmaius and Seck-no-furthers from the coast near Bolinas, 
 trees planted last year and growing directly on the borders 
 of tho ocean in a sunny nook backed by high hill? to lee- 
 ward. 

There are many choice specimens of embroidery and nee- 
 dle work, .«hell work, and wax fruit. Also, a collection of 
 beautiful alg», collected and tastefully arranged by Mrs. 
 Boston, of Monterej'. Some luxuriant specimens of a nox- 
 ious plant called "obacco. apparently not very interesting to 
 the lecturer. A quantity of mustard .«eed weighing five 
 ounces and a half, the product of three seeds, each seed pro- 
 ducing by computation seventy thousand. This is the most 
 troublesome weed in California, growing so high as to over- 
 t.op one's head when riding on a horse. It frequentlj' takes 
 possession of a field and ruins the crop, the stems growing 
 six inches in circumference, and effectually prohibiting the 
 use of the scythe or sickle. 

Regularity in Feeding. 

If there is one rule which may be considered more im- 
 perative than any other in Sheep Husband'y, it is that the 
 utmost regularity be preserved in feeding. First, there 
 should be regularity as to the times of feeding. However 
 abundantly provided for, when a flock are foddered some- 
 times at one hour and sometimes another — sometimes three 
 times a day and sometimes twice — some days grain and 
 some days none — they cannot be made to thrive. They will 
 do far better on inferior keep, if fed with strict regularity. 
 In a climate where they require hay three times a day, tho 
 best times for feeding are about sunrise in the morning, at 
 noon, and an hour before dark at night. Unlike cattle and 
 horses, sheep do not eat well in the dark, and therefore they 
 should have time to consume their feed before night sets in. 
 Noon is the common time for feeding grain or roots, and is 
 the best time if but two foddi'rings of hay are given. If 
 the sheep receive hay three times, it is not a matter of much 
 consequence with which feeding the grain is given, only that 
 the practice be uniform. 

It is also highly essential that there be regularity pre- 
 served in the amount fed. The consumption of hay will, it 
 is true, depend much upon the weather. The keener the 
 cold, tho more sheep will eat. In the south much would 
 also depend upon the amount of grass obtained. In many 
 pliices a light daily foddering would suffice — in others, a light 
 foddering placed in the depository racks once in two days 
 would answer the purpose. In the steady cold weather of 
 tho north, the shepherd readily learns to determine aliout 
 how much hay will be consumed before the next foddering 
 time. And tliis is the amount which should, a.* near as may 
 be, bo rc<julurly fed. In feeding grain or roots there i.« no 
 difficulty in preserving entire re'jnlarit;/, an<l it is vastly 
 more important than in feeding hay. Of the latter a sheep 
 will not overeat and surfeit itself. Of the former it will. 
 And if not fed grain to the point of surfeiting, but still over- 
 plonfeously^, it will expect a like amount at the next feeding, 
 and failing to receive it, will pine for it and manifest uneasi- 
 ness. Tlie effect of such irregularity on tiie stomach ami 
 system of any animal is bad — and the sheep suffers more 
 from it than any other animal. I would much rather that 
 my flock receive no grain at all, than that they receive it 
 without regard to regularity in tho amount. The »hepherd 
 should be required to measure out the grain to sheep in all 
 instances — instead of guessing it out — and to measure it to 
 each separate flock. — Sheep Jiunlandry.
