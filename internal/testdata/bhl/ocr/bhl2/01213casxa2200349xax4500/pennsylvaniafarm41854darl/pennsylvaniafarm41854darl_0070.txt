BREEDING STOCK. i 

The very eiToneous ideii is entertained by sonic far- 1 
 mcrs that the excellence of stock depends mcreli/ on food • 
 and keep, and its productiveness and profit on rich and 
 highly cultivated farms is adduced to sustain the posi- 
 tion. "Quality goes in at the mouth," "the value of a 
 pig depends upon the trough," are expressions not un- 
 frequently heard, and are most mischievous in their ten- 
 dency. They strike at the very root of all improvement 
 in stock breeding. 

"While it is true that a cow or steer will not make rich 
 milk or beef without proper food, and the quantity de- 
 pends to some extent on the amount of food, still there 
 are inherent tendencies and dispositions which distinguinh 
 individual animals, and which no treatment or manage- 
 ment can materially alter. 

These natural qualities often characterise the breed, 
 and produce different results under the same circum- 
 stances and from the same treatment. It is by selecting 
 such individuals as have certain desirable qualities, and 
 carefull}' breeding them with others, through a course of 
 years with a view to retain these and also secure others, 
 that they at last become y?;iYf/, constitutional and perma- 
 nent. Plerein lies the true science of breeding, which 
 was pursued with such success by Charles Colling, under 
 ■whose auspices the Short-Horns have attained their 
 present high degree of perfection. He was distinguish- 
 ed above all other breeders of his day by a fine discrimi- 
 nating touch, which enabled him to judge of the quality 
 of the flesh and tendency to fatten, to which much of 
 his extraordinai-y success is attributed. 

His great starting point was to secure such animals as 
 had the inclination to fatten. This he never lost sight of 
 whatever else he desired to secure, and the improved 
 Short-Horn of the present d.ay retains this peculiarity to 
 a greater degree than any other breed now kJiown. One 
 of our recent foreign exchanges has an excellent article 
 on the subject from which we extract the following, and 
 illustrates the above views by analogy in the vegetable 
 kingdom. Referring to the exj^eriments of Mr. Lawes 
 some years ago, it says : 

He showed that it was the quantity rather than the char- 
 acter of produce that was capable of modification by .skilful 
 management in this particular : that, whatever naturally 
 were the eh.iracteristic features of any plant, the develop- 
 ment and not the alteration of those features was all that 
 lay within the .scope of the mere art of cultivation. You 
 could not by the skilful use of nitrogenous manure increase 
 the nitrofjenoim character of the wheat grown upon it; all 
 that you could hope to do was to dovelope to its utmost the 
 character, whatever thnt might bo, of the grain that wns be- 
 ing grown. Wheat is particularly a st;irehy seed : and Mr. 
 Lawes found that, by the proper use of nitrogenous ma- 
 nures, that grain became richer, not in gluten and its other 
 nitrogenous ingredients, but in starch its natural product. 
 The whole ]>lant exhibited a more vigi>rons growth, and 
 proved both more abundimt in produce and more mnrked in 
 the natural character of that produce than ordinarily it wiis. 
 If, therefore, any one should desire to procure a produce of 
 a different sort, he uuist aim at it from the very beginning 
 by impressing a different cliaracter on the plant he grows, 
 rather than in the course of cultivation by varying the 
 treatment of the plant in respect of manure. It is by hy- 
 bridising artificially, or by selection, which is just choosing 
 instances of natural hyl>ridising — so obtaining plants with a 
 natural bent towards the end at which you aim — and then 
 by artificial stimulants which will give them an extra-natu- 
 ral impulse along the course their nature dictates, tluit tliis 
 end at wliich you aim can alone be fully reached. 

Now all this finds its parallel and close analogy in the an- 

imal world. We have, during the past week, examined sev- 
 eral herds of cattle comprising at least 500 head of stock, 
 and yielding among them three different kinds of produce. 
 And we have been exceedingly struck with the similarity of 
 the management, along with the diversity of the result. 
 Just as two fields shall be manured and cultivated alike, 
 and yet the vegetable produce at harvest differ exceedingly, 
 owing to original and iidierent difference in the plants, and 
 to that alone ; so hero were cattle yielding beef, or milk, or 
 young stock of peculiar qualitj', according to the original 
 and inherent character of the animals, and to that alone. 

The following is the treatment at one of the places wo 
 have lately visited. The cattle are fed at half-past 5 in the 
 morning with a bushel of grains between two, after 6 they 
 have about 4 lbs. weight of' hay apiece, and at 9 they get 
 an oilcake between two, or .3 IIjs. each ; after that another 
 bushel of grains between two, and the}' are then let out, two 
 at a time, for a few minutes to water ; they then come in to 
 a clean fresh bed. and lie down till the afternoon ; they then 
 receive .30 lbs. of Mangold Wurtzel apiece, and at night get 
 •4 or 5 lbs. more hay. Now can any one tell whether that is 
 meant for milk or beef — or breeding stock? Peih;'.])s the 
 last is the least likely to be named ; but wo know tliat tljo 
 proverb still detains with many, "that more than half the 
 quality of a beast goes in at the mouth."' 

The bill of daily fare just quoted is, in fact, that at tho 
 present tirje of a great dairy establishment in Camden 
 Town ; but that it would be as adniirally adapted for ma- 
 king beef as it is for making milk, is proved by experience 
 of it on the spot. Mr. Brown, the intelligent owner of tho 
 herd, tells us no difference is made in the treatment of tho 
 animals; and those which are running dry get rapidly fat on 
 the very same food as is given to the good milkers in ad- 
 joining stalls. Some of them may yield 1(5 to 20 quarts a 
 day, though the avor.age of the herd and of the year doe-s 
 not much exceed 10 quarts each a day, and good milkers are 
 bare of flesh on the very food which is making Christmas 
 beef beside them. Here, then, the lesson is plainly taught 
 that quality of animal, even more than quality of food, 
 guides an<l produces the result. And "quality of animal," 
 we must remember, does not "go in at the mouth ;" it i« 
 handed down from generation to generation until the tem- 
 perament, habit of growth and natural tendencies become 
 fixed and constitutional. At the Laker Street Bazaar, dur- 
 ing the past week, there has been many an animal covered 
 thick with flesli, which has been fed no better than many a 
 milk cow with projecting bones is now being fed in the Lon- 
 don byres ; and at Hendon we have seen heifers out at grass 
 in which no stinting of food seems able to keep down the 
 natural tendency to fat. 

Mr. Pusey takes the case of a farm maintaining a flock of 
 300 sheep half a century ago, but capable now of keeping 
 double the nundjer; and he shows how, though the number 
 is only doubled, the annual supply of meat from that farm is 
 six-fold what it was ; for if the art of the cultivator has 
 doubled its ability, that of the breeder has increased three- 
 fold — if owing to well directed exertions on the one side, 
 food for twice the number of stock is provided, yet, owing 
 to exertions on the other, the same number of stock will in 
 the consumption of the same food produce three times as 
 much flesh. 

In olden time the flock when numbered in summer would 
 consist of ewe and lamb, shearling, two-shear, three-shear, 
 and perhaps four-shear sheep, respectively, ordy the last be- 
 ing ready for the butcher ; the food of five and perhaps six 
 l)er annum thus resulting in the maturity of (me ; but now 
 the flock, counted earlier in the season than before, is tho 
 ewe, its laudi, and a shearling already fit for slaughter. The 
 food of four or five as one, was needed to produce one fat 
 ' sheep a year, but now the food of two suffices for that pur- 
 ! pose. And the history of cattle is quite as instructive : the 
 I influence of skill in the breeding has tended to as gre.-vt an 
 j economy in the feeding — as great a produce of meat from 
 1 the consumption of a given quantity of food^ — in the case of 
 i cattle as in that of shec]). All this is proved by the way in 
 ! which the same food acts respectively upon well-bred oxen 
 and on mongrels, in tho oxperici'.ce of all Vrecdcrs and all 
 feeders. 

A Gre.\.t Whe.vt Crop. — The Le Roy, (X. Y.,) Brumcrat 
 says that Hon. A. S. Upham, of that village, from a field of 
 100 acres, has raised and cathcrcd in good order 3,C00 bush- 
 els of wheat this season.
