An Interim Fruit Report for December. 

Piiii.ADJiLPniA, December 20, 1853. 
 To the President Ponn. Ilort. Society. 

The Fruit Committee respectfully report that since the 
 Xovomber meeting of the Society, "the following fruits have 
 been received by them : 

From Jfrn. J. R. Littimer. — Pears /or their Ha/He, grown 
 by Dr. Charles Kuhn of this city. These were unusually 
 fine specimens of the EnJtasen'e. 

From Lloi/d N. Roijcrs, Esq. — Baltimore — Fifteen varie- 
 ties of Pears. 

1. The Bir. — Although the specimen received was not so 
 largo as some we have seen, yet it was in quality "best." 

2. Pezi de la Motte. — This variety is exceedingly pro- 
 ductive; the fruit is fiir, of lino texture, and buttery, but so 
 utterly destitute of flavor as to be worthless. 

8. Urhaniste. — Specimens very fine. This Flemish varie- 
 ty is one of the best of the foreign pears. In the November 
 number of Ilovey's Magazine, we are told th.it "the Beurre 
 Soule has long been familliar to Boston Pomologists as the 
 Urbaniste."' In regarding the Beurre Soule and the Urban- 
 iste identical, the Boston Pomologists are, we think, in error. 
 The specimens of the former exhibited in 1848, as was re- 
 marked at the time hy one of their ablest Pomologists, bore 
 .some resemblance to the llanners (Cushing,) much more so 
 indeed than to the Urbaniste, though we do not consider it 
 synonymous with either of them. 

4. General Taylor. — Size, under medium, two .and a half 
 inches long by two and .a half wide; form, tni-binicate, ob- 
 scurely pj'riforra, broad at the crown ; co/or cinnamon russet, be- 
 coming fawn on the exposed side; stem, three-fourths of an 
 inch long and one-eighth thick, inserted into a very small cav- 
 ity; calyx, partially closed, set in a broad, not very deep, fur- 
 rowed basin; core, medium; seed, dark brown, ovate, no an- 
 gle at the obtuse end; flesh, yellowish white, granular, be- 
 coming buttery and melting, but somewhat gritty at the 
 core; flavor, as high as the Seckel. aroma delicious; quality 
 "best;" maturity, November. The General Taylor is believed 
 to bo a native of Maryland. The tree supposed to be the 
 original one grows near Baltimore, and is about 25 or 30 
 years old. It presents no evidence of h.aving been worked, 
 and Mr. Rogers assures us that scions taken from suckers, 
 which spring up from its root, h.ave born fruit similar in all 
 respects to that of the parent tree. Wo commend the vari- 
 ety to the attention of Pomologists. 

The following eleven kinds were not in condition for eat- 
 ing: Bleecker's 3feadoto, IJowiiton, Fii/ue, Fortunee de Paris, 
 Jekworth, McLauf/hlin, Ne Plus Jfeuris, Sabine d'Hiver,

 the table, scarcely "ijood" in quality.

 ately wide, not very deep, russeted cavity; calyx, small,

7. The Yost, — a fine apple which has been noticed in sev- 
 eral of our Reports. 

From Wm. V. Pettit, Esq., of Colonnade Row. — A very 
 large specimen of the Niles Pear. Size, four inches long by 
 three and three-fourths broad and weighing one and one- 
 fourth pounds ;/o)-Hi, roundish, oblong; color, yellow at ma- 
 turity, with many russet dots; «<ent, one and one-fourth inches

 nate; /?c«/i, somewhat granular, becoming buttery ;y/aror, not 
 high, but sacchiirine and i)leasant; quality "very good ;" ma- 
 turity, December; an abundant bearer of large and fair fruit. 
 Thisisa foreign v.ariety, imported from France, by the Hon. 
 Jno. M. Niles, of Hartford, Conn. The imported tree was sent 
 by him some years ago, to his friend Wm. V. Pettit, Esq., 
 of this city. Our attention was first directed to it, by Mrs. 
 Catharine Stanley, of East Hartford— an Hononary and Cor- 
 responding member of our Society, and distinguished as well 
 for her moral, social, and intellectual accomplishments, as 
 for her zealous, and untiring devotion to Horticulture. Being 
 unable to recognize the variety, and its true name having 
 been lost, we design.ated it the Niles. Some of the Boston 
 Pomologists, who are more familiar with the Easter Beurre 
 th.an we are, consider it that variety; while others unhesi- 
 tatingly .say it is not the Easter Beurre. AVithout giving a 
 decided opinion on this point, we will merely remark that it 
 differs from the specimens we have been in the hal)it of see- 
 ing of the latter, in being more oblong in form, of a more 
 yellow color, having a longer stem, a deejjcr and more reg- 
 ular basin, and in its earlier period of maturity. 

From Mr. Alexander I'arker — Tuo varieties Pears. — One 
 is called a Xative Butter Pear, and resembles the Petre; the 
 the specimen is too much dec.aj'ed for us to form any opinion 
 of its quality. The others, sent for their name, are tho 
 Echasserie. 

From J)r. J. K. Eshelman, Downingtown — Pears for their 
 name. — The specimens sent were not in eating order; but in 
 their configuration and general appearance they resembled 
 the St. Germain. 

From Mrs. .John B. Lattimer — The Cushing Raspberry, 
 grown by Hartman Kuhn, Jr., Esq., of this city. Specimens 
 remarkably fine. The autumnal fruit of this twice-bearing 
 variety is even larger than that which ripens in summer, at 
 the usual raspberry season. 

From Mr. H. B. Lindley, Athens, Ohio, through Caleb 
 Cope, Esq. — Fine Sjiecimens of an Ajiple for its name. Size,
