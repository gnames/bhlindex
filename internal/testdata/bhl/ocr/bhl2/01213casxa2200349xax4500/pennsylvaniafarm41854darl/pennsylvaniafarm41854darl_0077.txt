National Fair at Springfield, Mass. 

The success of the grand horse exhibition at this 
 place, last fall, has stimulated the good people therea- 
 bouts to attempt a grand national cattle show, to take 
 place on the first Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday of 
 September, 1854. The premiums will .amount to $5,000, 
 and be open to all the world. Ample and beautiful 
 grounds will be prepared, and arrangements made to ac- 
 commodate all who come without extra charges. 

To attempt any thing of this kind, with our Yankee 
 friends, is to succeed. They don't go into such measures 
 "without determining this point first, and erasing the 
 word /ai7 out of their vocabulary, and we therefore pre- 
 sume the national cattle show is a fixed fact. 

Largest Cabbage in the World. 

We received recently, says the Aha, a San Francisco 
 paper, from the garden of Mr. John Aldersey on the mission 
 road, the largest cabbage that, probably, the earth ever 
 produced — certainly the largest of which there is any 
 account. This remarkable plant, standing in its natural 
 position, measures three feet and one inch in diameter, 
 including the loose leaves surrounding the head. The 
 head itself, which is very solid and perfectly white, 
 measures thirteen inches in diameter, and the whole 
 weighs thirty-four pounds. 

Peruvi.vx Guano. — The Government of Peru lately 
 appointed a committee to investigate and report the 
 amount of guano still remaining on the Chincha islands, 
 estimate the stock at tweuty-five millions of tons. If 
 this be so, it would take 500 cargoes annually of 600 
 tons each three quarters of a century to clear these 
 islands !

At the Annual Agricultural Fair, lield in Niagara 
 county. New York, on the loth of October last, the fol- 
 lowing premiums M'ere awarded on Grain Crops :
