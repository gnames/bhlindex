Sklf-Acting Machi.ves for Weighing Giiain — By I. D. 
 Garlick, of Lynns, N. Y. : I claim the auxilliary gate, when 
 combined with the loaded bent lover and cam catch, or their 
 equivalents, which act upon the steelyard so as to lift short- 
 ly before the weight of grain in the weighing box becomes 
 sufficient t« raise it, as set forth. 

I also claim suspending the weighing box in the frame by 
 means of a rack pinion and loaded lever, whereby it is made 
 fco slide up and down within said frame at each weighing, 
 and to produce tJie movements as described. 

I also claim the arrangement and combination of the bent 
 cam lever, the pin ou the frame, and the curved elastic rod 
 connecting said lever with the lid, for the purpose of open- 
 ing tlie lid at each descent of the weighing box within the 
 frame, and again closing it by the ascent thereof, as set 
 forth. 

I also claim the suspended hopper, in combination with 
 the vibrating lever, arranged as set forth. 

I also claim the combination of the notches and catch 
 ■wire, with the clastic shoo and pin of the lever, arranged in 
 .«uoh a manner that said lever is successively set free from 
 the notch Q, catch, and notch R, respectively, by the ascent, 
 descent, and second ascent of the steelyard, as set forth. 

I also claim the adjustable cam catch, as described, in 
 combination with the shouldered rod, for the purpose set 
 forth. 

I also claim the slotted rod, in combination with the vi- 
 bratory lever, when arranged in such a manner that the as-

Pick Axes— By .L C. Conklin, of Peekskill, N. Y.. (as- 
 signor to D. Tompkins, of North Haverstraw, N. Y., and D. 
 F. Tompkins, of New York City) : I do not claim extending 
 the main Itar through the centre of the eye of the ))ick axe, 
 neither do I claim the braces which secure the handle; but 
 I claim the combination of the said bar with the braces 
 and tlie loops, as set forth. 

IIarvusters and Binders. — By J. E. Nesen, of Buffalo, 
 N. Y. Patented in England. Aug.' 185."!: I do not claim the 
 slotted fingers, nor the teeth, nor do I claim an endless 
 bolt, irrespective of the peculiar motion communicated to it. 

I claim, first, giving the endless apron an intermitting 
 motion, for the purpose of carrying the grain to the bind- 
 ing hooks, at intervals and in proper quantity, said motion 
 being communicated to the apron, by means of a belt ship- 
 per worked automatically, from some moving portion of the 
 machine, as described. 

Second, I claim gathering the grain in bundles or sheafs, 
 hy means of the binding hooks, or their equivalents, said 
 binding hook being arranged and operated as shown — motion 
 being communicated to them by means of the reciprocating 
 bars, as described. 

Third, I claim the binding hooks in combination with the 
 endless intermitting moving apron, the hooks and apron be- 
 ing constructed, arranged, and operated as set forth. 

Corn Shellers — By Banford Gilbert, of Pittsburgh, Pa.: 
 I claim constructing the teeth on the cylinder and concave 
 bed of the peculiar form described, and arranging the same 
 in curved rows, so that during the revolution of the cylinder 
 the concavity of the rows of teeth on the cylinder meets the 
 concavity of the rows of teeth on the concave bed. in com- 
 bination with the screen or separator and the self adjusting 
 concave, as set forth. 

Corn Planters — By Samuel Malone. of Tromont, 111. : T 
 claim the peculiar construction of the horizontal slide, made 
 reversible from end to end for the purpose of varying the 
 quantity of seed planted, as set forth. 

Machinery for Sawing Logs — By Oren Stoddard, of 

: Busti, N. Y. : I claim, first, the means set forth for elevating 
 ; the saw when it has cut through the log by means of the 
 ratchet, pawl, lever, and parts attached, in combination with 
 the retaining latch, operated upon by the log, when it has 
 been forced forward the required amount to disengage said 
 latch, and allow the s.aw to operate upon the log, as set 
 forth. 
 I Second, I claim forcing the log along the required amount 
 for each section to be sawn off by means of the roller opera- 
 ed on by the lever and pawl, when said pawl is brought into 
 action by the lever, as specified. 

Butter and Cheese. 

We give below for the benefit of a large portion of 
 our readers, engaged in dairying, the following i.»V)stract 
 of a report on butter and cheese, from the "Rhode Island 
 Society for the encouragement of Domestic Industry." 

We may also remark that in this section, which sup- 
 plies a large portion of the best butter of Philadelphia 
 market, it is a common practice with many to keep o. 
 pan of sour milk on hand, a small quantity of which is put 
 into the pan of new milk, with the view to induce its 
 becoming sour quickly. It is considered that all the 
 cream does not rise till this souring takes place, and 
 the sooner afterwards the skimming is done the better. 
 In cool weather especially, where the milk has to stand a 
 long time, to effect this, the butter is sure to be ran- 
 cid. 

From these experiments it is shown that to obtain the 
 best of sweet butter that will keep for a greater length of 
 time than any other without being rancid, we must churn 
 sweet cream, that if the butter-milk is valuable in market, and 
 the buttercanbedisposed of soon afteritis made, there will be 
 the greatest gainby churningthe sour milk and cream together 
 that by scalding the milk and then taking off the cream, the 
 milk is best for market — although the yield of butter is 
 greatest, and the flavor good, it must be put in market di- 
 rect from the churn and consumed without delay or it be- 
 comes rancid and worthless:— that in proportion to the (pian- 
 tity of butter produced from the cream of a given measure 
 of milk, reference being had to the length of time the 
 cre.am is suffered to remain upon it, will be its liability to 
 become soonest rancid: — that the excess of weight as exhib- 
 ited above is to be attributed in a great measure to the ab- 
 sorption and combination of casein (curd) with the olea- 
 ginous ('oily) portions of the cream; — that the prevalence 
 of casein, although it is not objection.able by imparting any 
 unpleasant flavor while new, renders the butter of less val- 
 ue, as it soon grows rancid: and for the further reason that 
 it is used, necessarily, more profusely than new butter, 
 which has less curd in it. It has been fully proved that 
 milk contains on an average oniy one per cent more curd 
 tlian butter. 

Dumas says, "that the facility with which butter becomes 
 rancid, depends on the presence of casein (curd,) from 
 which it is necessary it should be separated in order to its 
 preservation. 

This can be effected by fusion (melting.) For exportation 
 to hot climates, or for the purpose of preserving early-made 
 butter sweet through the heat of summer for winter's use it 
 should be clarified before salting or much working. For this 
 purpose it is imt into a lipped vessel and placed in another 
 of water, which is to be gradually he.ated, till the butter is 
 melted. Care must betaken not to over-heat it: it must 
 be kept melted until the curd and butter-milk have settled; 
 the clear melted butter is then jioured off from the sediment 
 into small white kegs, containing from twenty to thirty 
 pounds each, or into maple eannipails of Shaker manufac- 
 ture, for family use. When sufficiently cooled, and before 
 it hardens, it m.ay be s,alted with less than half an ounce of 
 fine rnch xalt to the pound, but as it is difficult to incorpo- 
 rate the salt well, the salt may he omitted and the butter 
 will keep perfectly sweet. What butter remains in the ves- 
 sel will rise to the top, and harden like tallow; when ta- 
 ken off the amount of curd and butter-milk will appear. 
 You will then have the pure article, equal to the best of ta- 
 ble butter for all the purposes to which (as we get it) or 
 drawn butter is ajiplied — it is perfect for shortening — melt
