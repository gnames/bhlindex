it in milk instead of water. It is not suitable to spread cold 
 on bread. 

One of your committee in the wrarm season last year, took 
 seventeen pounds of sweet salted lump butter and proceeded 
 as above directed. What settled at the bottom after melt- 
 ing, was composed of two ounces of limpid whey, two ounces 
 of fine salt, and twelve ounces of curd, in all one pound. 
 Had this curd not been extracted, the whole lone; before 
 this (2d of Feb.) would probably have been rancid. The 
 experiment proved perfectly satisfactory, and is recommen- 
 ded to the public. Store-keepers back in the country who 
 take in liutter. would find it to their account by putting it 
 in practice, thereby diminishing the amount of "grease- 
 butter" sent to market. 

Adulteration of Milk, from Bowmaim Medical Chcmistri/, 
 as published in the Pmrifleuce Joiinia/, some time since: — 
 "We have no chemical means of ascertaining whether water 
 has been fraudulently adtled to milk: the only effect being 
 to dilute it and render it of poorer quality. A knowledge 
 of the specetie gravity cannot here bo made available, since 
 the abstraction of cream, which has a lower specific gravity 
 than milk, may be made to neutralize the effect produced 
 by the addition of water, — the tendency of the removal of 
 the cream being to raise the specific gravity, or weight of the 
 milk, and that of the addition of water to lower it. A speci- 
 men of milk, therefore, which has been impoverished by the 
 abstraction of cream, and still further weakened by the ad- 
 dition of water, may be made to possess the same specific 
 gravity, or weight, as it had when taken from the can." 

The average product of cow's milk is 15 per cent, of cream 
 bj' the lactometer. 

It is of quite as much importance to ascertain the average 
 product of curd; but this can only be done by actual exper- 
 iment, as no instrument will show it. Liebig says the nu- 
 triment in milk depends on the amount of curd it contains; 
 and not on the amount of butter. An experiment was tried 
 by feeding a dog with butter only: he became very fat, his 
 hair was saturated with grease, and he died at the end of 
 thirty days. Those who were opposed to this view of the 
 subject repeated the experiment and the dog survived, but 
 this result was attrilnited to the great amount of casein 
 (curd) contained in the butter. 

If the object of a Dairy be to make Cheese, cows should 
 be bred and selected that give milk rich with curd; if the 
 object be Butter, those that give a light milk will produce 
 most; but if the object being the greatest profit in selling 
 milk, such cows should be selected as will give the most milk 
 and from weieh the least butter and cheese can be made from 
 a given quantity. 

It is a remark often made, and with truth, by those who 
 have the care of dairies, that there are individuals among 
 their cows, whose milk yields little or no cream, but abounds 
 in curd, but is not lacking in cream. The perfection of milk 
 is the union of these two desirable properties, and its great- 
 est defect in the absence of both. 

A cubic foot of pure water weighs 1000 ounces avoirdupois 
 very nearly. 

The weight of all substances, except the gasses, (all being 
 brought to one temperature,) is, in relation to that of pure 
 water, whose specific gravity (weight) is represented, by 
 unity, or one, thus: 

1.000 

Butter is lighter 0,942 

Cream " 0.9S0 

New milk average is heavier 1.02S 

Skim milk " " 1.088 

In a former communication on the subject of Butter ma- 
 king, we disapproved of the practice of ad<ling water to 
 the cream, and of washing the butter, to rid it of its butter- 
 milk. The carbonate of lime, found in water, causes the 
 incrustation, which forms on the inside of utensils in which 
 it is boiled. Butter absorbs the lime and magnesia, present 
 in salt and in water, when it comes in contact with them; 
 it has an injurious effect on its quality and preservation. 
 It is therefore in all cases safest not to wash it, even if the 
 water be pure, it will in a measure destroy its fine fragrance 
 and flavor. 

The use of pure salt cannot be too often recommended to 
 those who have dairies in charge. More than a million of 
 dollars can bo annually saved to our farmers in this country 
 by attention to this point. No one denies that good pure 
 salt is made at our salt springs by solar evaporation, if ta- 
 ken from the first pan where all the crystals are perfect- 

ly square; but this salt comes to the consumer with va- 
 rious degrees of adulteration ; and is therefore cheap, as to 
 the fiist cost. After the siiuure crystals of pure salt have 
 ceased to form : then, by further evaporation the salts of 
 magnesia and glaubers salts begin to show long-needle shap- 
 ed crystals very bitter to the taste; easilj- dissolved and al- 
 ways found moist in damp weather. It will not preserve 
 fish or meat, and when used for butter, will dissolve and run 
 from it like water. Whereas rock salt gives it firmness, 
 which facilitates the extraction of butter-milk and preserves 
 it sweet. Many bags marked rock salt, have been filled more 
 than once; and many others never came in contact with it. 
 Let the farmers club together, and send to a sea-port and 
 get the best of rock salt, sift out the fine, wash and dry the 
 lumps, and have it ground at any gristmill in the neighbor- 
 hooil, as our fathers did, liefore the introduction of the very 
 improved fine Liverpool bag or V)lown salt.

 WORSTED WORK. 

BY MRS. ABnV. 

0! talk not of it lightly in tone of scornful mirth, 
 It brings to me glad visions of the calm and quiet hearth, 
 Of seasons of retirement from the world's obtrusive eyes, 
 Of freedom from absorbing toil, of dear domestic ties. 

When I view the tasteful ottoman, or richlj' fancied 

screen, 
 I ever picture to my mind, a sweet, and social scene, 
 A group of sister's, young and fair, rejoicing to unite. 
 In bringing every flower, and vivid fruit to light. 

Perchance, in time they separate, the world's false joys 

they share; 
 And half forget their Father's house, and all the dear ones 

there; 
 Then on a brief and passing stay, how tenderly their 

gaze 
 Shall rest upon the common work of girlhood's sunny 

days ! 
 Perchance dissensions have prevailed, cold envy may have 

cast 
 A bleak and withering blight upon the peaceful past, 
 Then may not these mute witnesses, such changeful iovo 

condemn. 
 Bearing a record in each leaf, a lesson in each stem. 

May they not think in sadness on the swiftly fleeting 

hour, 
 When like Hernia and her gentle friend, each busied on 

one flower. 
 They warbled some familiar air and plied their skillful 

aft. 
 Owning a happy unison of voice, and hand and heart. 

Perchance some fragile girl, who shared that cheerful task 

of love. 
 Hath left that cheerful home on earth and gone to rest 

above. 
 Then how her fond surviving friends shall gaze in pensive 

thought. 
 On every graceful tendrill that her fairy fingers wrought. 

How shall they scan the chaplets, that she fancifully plan- 
 ned. 

To trace the individual buds, that grew beneath her hand, 

Feeling in softened grief, that she who once these flowers 
 portrayed, 

Is taken from a world of change, where ''all that's bright 
 rniint fade." 

The scoffer maj' in vain pursuits, and wasted moments 
 jest; 

Alas! the hu/h/i/ (ji/tcd mind, is most in need of rest; 

Exhausted, faint, and overwrought, the thoughts may pas- 
 sive lie. 

While actively the fingers their ingenious duty plj-. 

There is language in the blossoms of the meadows, and 
 the bowers. 

To me, the lifelcs canvass has its own sweet speech of 
 flowers; 

Its gay, and glowing garlands have amoral in their bloom, 

They tell of household quiet, of the tmmiuil joys of homo.
