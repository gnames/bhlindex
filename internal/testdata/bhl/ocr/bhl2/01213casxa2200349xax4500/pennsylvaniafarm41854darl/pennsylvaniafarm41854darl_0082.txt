ject, ample illustration of tho hereditary tendency of exter- 
 nal form, disposition, habit, and disease. Tho parent trans- 
 fers to its offspring size, shape, and fjeneral conformation 
 similar to its own ; and the aphorism "like produces like" is 
 as applicable to faulty and disproportioned as to beautiful 
 and synunetrical form, to diseased and debilitated as to 
 healthy and vigorous constitution, to gentle and tractable as 
 to fiery and indomitable disposition. The size, weight, gen- 
 eral appearance, expression of countenance, floetne.'S, and 
 temper of tho horse are all heredit;iry. Many illustrations 
 might be given of particular families being remarkable du- 
 ring several generations for good or bad point-s, as for well 
 or ill formed head ; for high and well developed, or for low 
 and weak withers ; for fine, strong, and well turned, or for 
 coarse, weak, and ill formed limbs. Peculiarities of color 
 often extend through many generations, and are so constant 
 in their transmission as sometimes to form one of the dis- 
 tinctive characteristics of a race. Indeed, most breeds of 
 horses have a prevailing color, to which there are few excep- 
 tions. The heavy horses of Lincolnshire, for example, are 
 generally black ; the Cleveland, bay ; and the wild horses of 
 the plains of Eastern Siberia, dun. Particular markings, 
 also— as white spots on various parts of the body, stars and 
 blazes on the face, one or more white feet or legs — often 
 continue for many generations peculiar to certain fami- 
 lies. 

The general constitution of an animal is no less heredi- 
 tary than the external qualities to which we have just allu- 
 ded. Some stocks of horses, for example, can sustain with 
 impunity an amount of labor which, in others of the same 
 breed, would cause serious bad effects : and the peculiar ac- 
 tion, both of medicines, and of morbific causes, is generally 
 observed to be similar in members of tho same family. But 
 besides the general constitution of the parents, their special 
 condition at the time of copulation also appears to bo to a 
 oertain extent transmitted to the offspring: andhence the ne- 
 cessity of selecting for breeding purposes only animals of a 
 strong and healthy constitution, and of using them only 
 ■when they are in full possession of all their physical ener- 
 gies. For a high state of the physical energies at tho time 
 of impregnation is believed to induce a correspondingly 
 great development of physical power in tho offspring ; and 
 of this we have a curious example in the fact that tho Arabs, 
 before bringing the parents together, give them a short gal- 
 lop, believing that the spirit and fleetness of the progeny is 
 thereby enhanced. On the other hand, wo find that even a 
 alight and temporary debility at tho time of copulation ex- 
 ercises a marked deteriorating effect upon tho spirit and vig- 
 or of the offspring, and it is well known that tho stock of old 
 stallions is generally weak and spiritless : "Sones valetudi- 
 narii, imbocilles . . . filios vitiosa constitutiono gignunt." — 
 Fernel. 

It must be observed that external circumstances, as diet 
 and temperature, exercise a powerful influence on animal 
 growth and development. With meagre fare and exposure 
 to cold, animals do not roach tho average size of their race, 
 and beget stock as much below the average as themselves. 
 In similarly unfavorable circumstances, these again do not 
 reach the size even of their own immediate parents, and 
 procreate a still smaller progeny. Conditions favorable to 
 growth and improvement operate in a simil.ar manner. They 
 improve each individual, and the descendants of each in- 
 herit to a greater or less degree the improvements on the 
 parent stock. Animals, then, are altered by circumstances, 
 and transmit to their progeny theiraltered forms. Thus, after 
 a few generations, the external characters of a breed are of- 
 ten greatly modified, and hence have arisen the permanent 
 varieties of horses and cattle met with in different parts of 
 the kingdom — -the tall, heavy horse of the Lincolnshire fens, 
 the light, active, but powerful thorough-bred, the small 
 pony of Shetland — and amongst cattle, the short-horned, 
 the Ayrshire and West Highland breeds, and many others — 
 varieties which have a common origin, but which are now so 

' distinct and permanent that each produces a progeny with 
 its own distinctive characteristics. Thus, even acquired and 
 artificial habits may become hereditary. Certain districts 
 are famous for their trotting horses, and many Irish hunters 
 are remarkable for their peculiar style of leaping. Some 
 years ago the Earls of Morton and Zetland imported from 
 Dongolia, in Upper Egypt, several entire horses, which were 

' remarkable for their high and prancing action. Their pro- 
 geny, both out of thorough-bred mares and those of the 

'heavier breeds, inherited the action of their sires to such a 
 degree that they had all to be sold as carriage-horeos, being 

unfit for racing, hunting, or almost any other kind of Trork. 
 Prichard states, in his "Natural History of Man," that the 
 horses bred on the table-lands of the Cordilleras "are care- 
 fully taught a peculiar pace, which is a sort of running am- 
 ble;" after a few generations this pace becomes a natural 
 one, young untrained horses adopting it without compnlsion. 
 But what is still more curious is tho fact, that, if these do- 
 mesticated stallions brood with mares of the wild herds 
 which abound in the surrounding plains, they "become the 
 sires of a race to which the ambling pace is natural and re- 
 quires no teaching." "The hereditary propensities of the 
 offspring of the Norwegian ponies," says Mr. T. A. Knight, 
 in a paper re.ad before the Royal Society in 18^7, "whether 
 full or h.alf bred, are very singular. Their ancestors have 
 been in tho habit of ohei/in/j the voice of their riders, and not 
 the bridle, and the horsobreakers complain that it is impossi- 
 ble to produce this last habit in the young colts; they are 
 notwithstanding exceedingly docile and obedient when they 
 understand the commands of their master. It is equally 
 diflBcult to keep them within hedges, owing, perhaps, to the 
 unrestrained liberty to which the race may have been accus- 
 tomed to in Norway." 

Much of what has boon already stated concerning the 
 hereditary nature of the external conformation and other 
 qualities of the horse is also applicablo to cattle. The pro- 
 geny of a common stock bear a close resemblance to their 
 parents and to each other in general appearance, length of 
 limb, development of chest, shape of carcass, position and 
 size of tho udder, adaptation for tho dairy, thickness of skin, 
 and length and texture of the hair. In some of tho hot 
 provinces of South America there are cattle "noted for an 
 extremely rare and fine fur. . . . The variety is reproduced 
 or descends in the stock." In tho same localities is also 
 found another race with an entirely naked skin, which pecu- 
 liarity is also hereditary. In our own country, too, there are 
 gre.at differences in the length and texture of the hair of 
 various sorts of cattle — difference which, as in the South 
 American animals, are transmitted to the progenj". The ex- 
 istence or non-existence of horns, their size, shape and cur- 
 vatures, are characters the hereditary nature of which is 
 generally admitted. But defect-s and deformities may also 
 become permanent in a stock. We are informed by a friend 
 that ho has soon several cattlo with a small portion of skin 
 covered with short hair situated on the eye, just within its 
 outer canthus; and that this peculiarity had been traced 
 back for five or six generations, and had occurred in every 
 case in exactly the same spot of the right eye. 

We have deemed it advisable thus far to consider the he- 
 reditary tendencies of external form, of habit, and of consti- 
 tution, in order to illustrate more fully and satisfactorily the 
 hereditary tendencies of disease, which we shall now proceed 
 to discuss. 

Hereditary diseases exhibit certain eminently characteris- 
 tic phenomena, some of which wo shall here enumerate : 

1. They are transmitted by tho male as well a? by the fe- 
 male parent, and are doubly severe in the offspring of pa- 
 rents both of which have been afli'octed by them. 

2. They develop themselves, not only in the immediate 
 progeny of animals affected by them, but also in many sub- 
 sequent generations : 

3. They do not, however, always appear in each genera- 
 tion exactly in the same form. One disease is sometimes 
 substituted lor another analogous to it, and this, after some 
 generations, becomes again changed into that to which the 
 breed was originally liable. Thus, stocks of cattle previous- 
 ly subject to phthisis often become affected for several gene- 
 rations with dysentery, to the total exclusion of phthisis, but 
 by and by the dysentery disappears to give place to the 
 phthisis. 

4. Hereditary diseases occur to a certain extent indepen- 
 dently of external circumstances, appearing under all sorts 
 of management, and being little affected by changes of lo- 
 cality, separation from tho diseased stock, or such other 
 causes as modify the production of non-hereditary dis- 
 eases. 

5. They ar-j, however, most certainly and speedily devel- 
 oped in ciniimstances inimical to general good health, and 
 often occur it certain so-called critical periods of life, when 
 unusual demands on the vital powers take place. 

6. They show a striking tendency to modify and absorb 
 into themselves all extraneous diseases. For example, in an 
 animal of a consumptive constitution, pneumonia .seldom 
 runs its ordinary course, and, when arrested, often passes 
 into consuiuption.
