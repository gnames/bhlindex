7. Hereditary diseases are less effectually treated by ordi- 
 nary remedies than other diseases. Thus, although an at- 
 tack of phthisis, rheumatism, or constitutional ophthalmia, 
 may be subdued, and the patient put out of pain and dan- 
 ger, the tendency to the disease will still remain, and be 
 greatly aggravated by each attack. 

Horedititry diseases do not necessarily show themselves at 
 birth. In horses and cattle there are only a few which do 
 BO. The scrofulous diathesis sometimes presents itself in 
 large collections of pus, which occasionally prove fatal with- 
 in a few dnys after birth ; and symptoms of hydro-cephalus, 
 ricketfl, and occasionally rheumatism — all hereditary com- 
 plaints — are also sometimes found present at that early pe- 
 riod. But most hereditary diseases develop themselves only 
 some considerable period after birth, and the inherent ten- 
 dency may even remain latent during many years. Thus, in 
 man, gout and gravel do not usually develop themselves un- 
 til after the meridian of life, and in horses and cattle the 
 tendency to consumption, scrofula, and rheumatism may re- 
 main dormant for many years. Nay, more ; diseases of an 
 undoubtedly hereditary nature may remain latent even for a 
 generation or two, and afterwards re-appcar with all their 
 wonted severity : "Silento saepe morbo in genitoro, dum ox 
 revo derivatur in nepotem ;" and such cases are not of uu- 
 frequent occurrence, and are certainly not at all incompati- 
 ble with the hereditary nature of a disease. They may be 
 satisfactorily explained in various ways. The morbid ten- 
 dency may be so slight as not to interfere with health, or the 
 animal may have been reared in circumstances where the 
 exciting causes of the disease have been avoided. But in 
 these eases, where a hereditary disease disappears for a gen- 
 " ©ration or two, the tendency to the disease and the condi- 
 tions in which that tendency consists are still transmitted, as 
 is obvious from the fact, that the disease develops itself in 
 the descendants with all the characters of a hereditary na- 
 ture. It requires, indeed, many generations, and a careful 
 selection of parents, to eradicate from a stock a hereditary 
 tendency to disease, and, for a considerable time after it has 
 been got rid of in the majority of the progeny, isolated in- 
 dividuals appear, which, in the phraseology of breeders, 
 "call back" to their more remote progenitors, and possess, 
 like them, an unusual tendency to disease. 

There are few diseases which invariably owe their devel- 
 opment to hereditary causes. Diseases usually regarded as 
 hereditary are sometimes produced accidentally, and with- 
 out the intervention of any hereditary tendency. Rheuma- 
 tism, which often owes its existence to an inherent rheuma- 
 tic diathesis, may be developed in mostanimals by continued 
 exposure to the ordinary exciting causes of the malady. 
 Specific or doep-soated ophthalmia, although generally de- 
 pendent on a constitutional predisposition, sometimes de- 
 stroys the eyesight of animals in whose pedigree no such 
 disease has been known; and even consumption and scrofula 
 — diseases easily traceable in the vast majority of cases to 
 hereditary prcdisposit'on — are occasionally developed in 
 previously healthy constitutions by the conjoined agency of 
 bad feeding, cold, and neglects From this it is obvious that 
 the production of any disease by extr.ancous causes is not at 
 all incompatible with its being in other cases decidedly he- 
 reditary. Such cases as wo have just adduced only serve to 
 show that the same disease is not always referable to the 
 same causes, and that causes very different in their nature 
 occasionally produce the same effects. 

Diseases accidentally produced during the lifetime of an 
 individuaH occasionally become hereditary, but not usually 
 80. Blindness produced by injury or ordinary external cau- 
 ses, and roaring produced by phlebitis, or even by bronchi- 
 tis, are seldom hereditary ; ami it appears as a general rule, 
 admitting, however, of some exceptions, that a local injury 
 or disease produced by accidental causes is not likely to bo 
 hereditary, although a generally deteriorated state of health, 
 however produced, is very apt to be so. 

There are various maladies whicli, from their simulating 
 some of the characters of heroditiry diseases, have been 
 thought by many to be truly hereditary. Abortion affords 
 an apt illustration of such a mistake. This disorder fre- 
 quently prevails in a stock for a long scries of years, and 
 sometimes oven during several generations. But although 
 corr.sponding in these respects to many hereditary diseases, 
 it differs essentially from them, inasmuch ns it attacks all 
 animiils alike when exposed to the same exciting causes, 
 shows no special preference for those bred from a stock in 
 which abortion has been prevalent, does not affect those re- 
 moved to a distance from the locality in which the disease 

prevails, and may sometimes be effectually and immediately 
 arrested by a radical change in the system of management 
 These conditions are quite suflScient to disprove the heredi- 
 tary nature of abortion; and when such conditions occur in 
 connexion with any other disease, they may be safely ac- 
 cepted as ample evidence of its being produced by external 
 or extraneous circumstances, independently altogether of 
 any hereditiry predisposition. 

There are some maladies in which it is comparatively easy 
 to trace the connexion between conformation and disease. 
 In the horse certain sorts of limbs notoriously predispose to 
 certiin diseases. Thus, bone spavins are most usually seen 
 where there is a disproportion in the size of the limb above 
 and below the hock ; curbs, whore the os calcis is small and 
 the hock straight ; strains of the tendons of the fore-leg, 
 where the limb is round and the tendons and ligaments con- 
 fined at the knee ; and navicular disease, where the chest is 
 narrow .and the toes turned out. Amongst horses so formed, 
 these diseases are unusually common, and are developed by 
 causes which would be quite inadequate to produce them in 
 animals of more perfect conformation. But it appears to us 
 that internal and constitutional hereditary diseases also de- 
 pend upon the altered conformati n or texture of ihe piirts 
 specially affected, or upon some l..-ti,rbance of the relation 
 which should subsist between the ilifferent constituents of 
 these parts. This abnormal state of the internal parts ia 
 seldom within the limits of our means of observation or in- 
 vestigation, but its existence in animals having a hereditary 
 predisposition to disease cannot, we think, be doubttd, aa 
 we shall now endeavor to show. The ground of our reason- 
 ing rests chiefly on the analogy which subsists in all re^ijeeta 
 between external and internal parts. The same law which 
 regulates the hereditary transmission of form, texture, and 
 relation of external and visible parts, also operates with 
 equal force in regard to the form, texture, and relations be- 
 twixt the components of parts internal, and, it maj' be. in- 
 accessible to ordinary powers of investigation. Then, if, as 
 we have shown, external hereditary diseases, such as lame- 
 ness, are traceable to external hereditiry peculiarities of 
 conformation, we do not think it pushing our analogy too 
 far to assert th.Tt, in like manner, internal hereditary dis- 
 eases must, in great part at least, depend upon some inhe- 
 rent hereditary peculiarity of the internal parts affected. 
 The following remarks will, we think, tend to sujiport our 
 hypothesis. Particular conditions of the blood often become 
 hereditary, and, if an excess of the red globules of the blood 
 be hereditary, the disease of plethora to which that excess 
 gives rise will also become lieredit.ary. We have a striking 
 example of this in many of the improved breeds of cattle, in 
 which is conjoined a remarkable excess of the red glubuloa 
 of the blood with a highly plethoric habit of body. If the 
 eye be predisposed to deep-seated ophthalmia, a slight expo- 
 sure to ctld, or even an error in diet, will be suflicient to in- 
 duce the disease But before an acute attack there is sel- 
 dom noticeable in the eye any alteration of texture (.r of 
 function indicating the existence of such a tendency. That 
 such a tendency does, however, exist there can be no doubt, 
 and we think that it must consist in an altered condition of 
 some of the deeply-seated parts of the eye. Our eonelusioa 
 is, therefore, that every hereditary disease depends upon 
 some hereditary abnormal condition predisposing to that dis- 
 ease. This abnormal condition may be either local or gen- 
 eral. It may aflect the form, structure, texture, quantitative 
 or qualitative composition either of solids or fluids. Jt may 
 constitute so powerful a predisponent to disease us speedily 
 to cause impairment of health, or it may be so slight, that 
 without tho co-operation of exciting causes it will fail to 
 produce any apparent disturbance of the general health. 
 But animals witii such inherent defects are always jiredis- 
 posod to disease. Influences which are harmless in others 
 often produces in them serious and irremediable disease. 
 Thus, ordinary work causes spavins or curbs in horses with 
 badly formed hocks; a slight exposure to cold brings on 
 phthisis in a cow of consumptive diathesis ; simple en!,'orge- 
 ment of the stomach causes an attack of ophthalmia in a 
 subject predisposed to it Hence, an animal having a he- 
 reditary tendency to disease labors under many di.<advanta- 
 ges, and his health, and even liis life, are in eonstint jeopar- 
 dy. He is alwnya liable to suffer from slight anil fem|)orar7 
 errors in diet and regimen, and bears about with him from 
 birth .an ill-fatid inheritance which affords a congenial soil 
 fer the reception and development of disease, and is trans- 
 mitted to his p isterity unim)>airod in power, and undimin- 
 ished in cx:ei;t. [to be contixued.
