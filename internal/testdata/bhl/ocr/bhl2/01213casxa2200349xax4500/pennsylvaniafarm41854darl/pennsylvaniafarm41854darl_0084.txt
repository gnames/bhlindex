Western Agriculture — Corn Cobs. 

I made a flying visit to our old friend Henry L. Ellsworth 
 of Patent Ofliee memory, one day last month. He is now a 
 resident of La Fayette, Indiana, where he is farming pretty 
 largely on the Prairie, about seven miles out, on which he 
 h;i!) II thousand acres of Indian corn in one field. The un- 
 common high prices of corn this summer has been the mov- 
 ing many an extra aero of it in the Waba.vh Valley, where, 
 if it ripens well, it will tell a pleasing cale, not only to the 
 cultivators, but to the starving millions of Europe. 

Mr. Ellsworth is as full of enthusiasm as ever, and no less 
 busy than he was in his office at Washington. He is an own- 
 er and manager of a vast amount of land, which he is soil- 
 in";, leasing, and improving, and which, together with all the 
 business operations that he is carrying on, keeps his office 
 crowded with the multitudes who deal with him. Yet ho 
 finds time to bo continually trying some experiments, for 
 the benefit of the agricultur.al community. 

I saw sis pigs in as many pens, just big enough to hold each 
 occupant without exorcise, which he was feeding on corn in 
 the ear, corn ground, but fed raw, and corn-meal made into 
 niU3h — two upon each kind. The pigs were all alike in age, 
 breed, size and weight, when commenced with, and after 
 being fed a certain time with carefully weighed quantities of 
 food, tn.'v are re-weighed and weights noted, and those which 
 had been fed upon one kind, are changed to another and so 
 on ; and when the experiment is finished, he assured nie he 
 would publish the table. The experiment thus far is very 
 largely in favor of the mush, bidding fair to produce enough 
 to i)ay toll and trouble for grinding, as well as for cooking, 
 and leave a profit. The number of pounds of good thick 
 mush, that one hundred pounds of meal, well worked, will 
 make, is astonishing to any one who has never thought much 
 upon the subject. It will not fall much if any short of six 
 hundred pounds. Mr. Ellsworth's kettle holds just fourteen 
 of meal at a charge, and several .leeurate weighings give 
 over eighty pounds when well cooked, and I saw myself that 
 no more water was used than the meal would absorb. But 
 it must be cooked — notmerelj' scalded. A little salt is added, 
 and occasionally and a little sulphur. 

Mr. Ellsworth assured me that he proved the mooted 
 point of nutritive food in corn-cobs. He says, "hogs will 
 live and thi'ive v.pon well (jronnd cob meal alone! At first 
 they did not take hold. I then added a small quantity of 
 meal of the grain principally of tlie grain, and then they 
 ate the whole, sind did wlII. I had great difficulty in getting 
 the cobs ground. Millers are so well satisfied in their own 
 minds that cobs are good for nothing, that they are not wil- 
 ling to let the experiment be tried whether they are nour- 
 ishing or not. I am satisfied that twenty-five pounds of 
 corn meal added to one hundred pounds of cob-meal, is more 
 valuable for feed for (jrowing stock, than seventy-five pounds 
 of corn-meal alone." Such is the language of Mr. Ellsworth. 
 Experiments of this land should be further tried. One-fourth 
 of the weigh of bushel of ears of corn, nature never intend- 
 ed should bo thrown away, and cobs vipon large corn-farms 
 in the West are literally thrown away. They are neither 
 used for food, fuel, feed, nor manure; for the latter is consid- 
 ered a nuisance. 

After my visit to Mr. Ellsworth, I met with our old friend, 
 Mr. Colt, of New Jersey, at the great Chicago Convention 
 tion. Owing to the vast crowd of people and business, I did 
 not have the opportunity that I wished to gleam intelligence 
 from so enterpriseing a Jersey farmer a.s ho is well known to 
 be; but as a matter of course, the things that our minds most 
 did dwell upon wore discussed over the dinner table, whore I 
 mentioned my conversation with Mr. Ellsworth, upon the 
 subject or corn-cobs, and my belief that they would be high- 
 ly advantageous to feed in sm.^ll quantities to all kinds of 
 stock, solely on account of the alkaline properties that many 
 an ancientdamo knows that they possess. For oftshehasmade 
 cob-ley when pearlash was high; and even if a little should 
 be mixed in human food it would not injure it; and in the 
 stomach of fattening hogs particularly, it would prove an ex- 
 cellent corrector of acidity. This idea was nothing new to 
 so inquiring a mind as that of Mr. C, and ho told me that 
 ho had tendered a donation of one hundred dollars to the 
 American Institute, for a complete analysis of corn-cobs, so 
 as to prove whether there was any nutritive quality in them. 

But my opinion is, that if the hundred dollars were spent 
 in actual exjierimonts of feeding live stock with cob-meal, a 
 a much more satisfactory result might bo arrived at, than can 
 possibly be done by any chemical analysis. If Mr. C. him- 

self will undertake the matter, I am sure that he will profo 
 some facts of vast importance to the corn growers of tho 
 United States. Where cobs are to be had in vast quantities 
 if they were used as fuel and the ashes carefully saved, I 
 have no doubt that they would be found mord than twice aa 
 valuable as wood-ashes for any purpose. If cobs are not 
 worth feeding to stock, and not of sufficient value as manure 
 or fuel, to be worth saving, then I am greatly mistaken, and 
 hope to have my mind enlightened with the truth; and when 
 that is done I shall not feel so grieved to see this bountiful 
 product of nature lying knee-deep across the public highway 
 in front of the door of many a hog and hominy farmer of 
 the West. But enough about one of nature's productions 
 which the world estimate as good for nothing. — Am, Agr'st,

Value of Leached Ashes. 

In conversation with an agricultural friend a few days 
 since, he mentioned that he had found great benefitfrom the 
 application of old leached ashes to wheat, especially on san- 
 dy soils. In one instance, 100 bushels of ashes per acre, 
 spread on the soil after the wheat was sown, gave him an 
 increase of ten bushels per acre. He has spots on his farm 
 where he can see the beneficial effect of unleached ashes, 
 appliednine years ago, every time thelot is sown with wheat, 
 lie has tried unleached ashes with no benefit to wheat, though 
 he thinks them good for corn. To what is the fertilizing 
 property of old leached ashes owing? We cannot definite- 
 ly answer this question. We are inclined to think, however, 
 that it is owing in some way to a substitution of the alkali 
 ammonia for the potash and soda which have been leached 
 out. It may be that they contain the double salt of sili- 
 cate of alumina and soda to which clay owes its power of 
 retaining ammonia. If this is the case, by adding leached 
 ashes to a sandy soil, we add ammonia, or at least, the means 
 of retaining the ammonia brought to the soil by rain from 
 the atmosphere: and that, too, in the best condition for assim- 
 ilation by the plant. Taking this view, it would follow 
 that the older the ashes, and the more they had been ex- 
 posed to rain, the better and stronger would they be. 

But whatever difl'crence of opinion there may be as to the 
 cause or reason of the fertilizing value of leached ashes, all 
 agree that they are valuable for wheat on sandy soils. 

There are in many parts of the country old asheries, from 
 whence leached ashes can be obtained at a mere nominal 
 price; and it is truly surprising that they are not more ex- 
 tensively used. The fall is the best time to apply them, 
 though they might be spread on the wheat while more or less 
 snow is on tho ground in the winter to advantage. — [Jiural

The Best Varieties of Pears. 

Hovey's Magazine speaks of the late exhibition of the 
 Boston Horticultural Society, as one of the most brilliant 
 and extensive ever held. The season in the vicinity of Bos- 
 ton has been very favorable for the production of that fav- 
 orite fruit of Bostonians, the pear, and tho contributions 
 were consequently very extensive, Hon. M. P. Wilder send- 
 ing in for exhibition .310 varieties, Hovey & Co. 300, J. S. 
 Cabot 120, Samuel Walker 100, &c. 

As among such a multitude of varieties some kinds must 
 be bettor than others, while many are of little or no value, 
 it will doubtless be interesting for our readers to know tho 
 twelve best varieties, which were selected by the committee. 
 They were as follows : 

From Hovey & Co.'s collection — 

Grey Doyenne, White Doyenne, Swan's Orange, Beurre 
 Bosc, Glout Morceau, Flemish Beauty, Doyenne Boussock, 
 B. Diol, Bartlett, Duchess D'Angouleme, Louise Bonne of 
 Jersey, B. D'Anjou. 

From Joseph Stickney — 

Louise Bonne of Jersey, Winter Nelis, Easter Beurre, 
 Marie Louise, Vicar of Winkfield, Beurre Diel, Urbaniste, 
 Glout Morceau, Belle Lucrative, Bartlett, Thompson, Flem- 
 ish Beauty. 

From Jos. Richardson — 

Beurre D'Anjou, Louise Bonne of Jersey, Urbaniste, B. 
 Easter, Bartlett, White Doyenne, B. Diel, Belle Lucrative, 
 Flemish Beauty, Dix, Duchesse D'Angouleme, Vicar of 
 Winkfield. 

These v.arieties may be said to be the cream of nursery- 
 mens' catalogues, being universal favorites everywhere. 
 They have all, with a few exceptions, proven themselves to 
 be of excellent quality in Iowa as well as in Massachusetts.
