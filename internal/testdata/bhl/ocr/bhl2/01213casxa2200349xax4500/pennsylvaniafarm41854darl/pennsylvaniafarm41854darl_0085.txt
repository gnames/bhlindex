''Honor to whom honor is due." 
 Several of our cotemporaries have spoken approving- 
 ly of suggestions by the Virginia press, favorable to 
 some solid and substantial token being conferred on 
 General Richardson, for services rendered by him to the 
 cause of agriculture, especially manifested in the great 
 State Exhibition at Richmond last fall. It would seem 
 that the awakening the planter, the farmer, and citizens 
 generally, to the landed interests of the State, which 
 had a long time lain partially dormant, was to some ex- 
 tent unknown until the contributions and attendance at 
 the State Fair demonstrated, that extraordinary effort 
 must have been made by some one to have brought about 
 a result so unlooked for and desirable. The feeling pro- 
 duced on the occasion led, as is stated, to the subscrip- 
 tion by individuals of fifty thousand dollars towards the 
 support of their State Society. This gratifying result is 
 ascribed mainly to Wm. H. Richardson, whose name is 
 familiar to us from a letter elicited by him on practical 
 agriculture, for the benefit of Virginia, from the pen of 
 James Gowen of Mount Airy, published in the Farmers' 
 Cabinet, Nov. 1845. We are not otherwise acquainted 
 with this distinguished person, whom we call distin- 
 guished, not because he is a General, but on account of 
 his having distinguished himself in the peaceful and 
 profitable pursuits of agriculture, which entitles him, as 
 a co-worker with us, to the right hand of fellowship. 
 The man, whether Virginian or Pennsylvanian, who has 
 devoted his time and talents to agriculture, thereby en- 
 larging the resources and promoting the prosperity of 
 the country, commands our respect and sympathies. 

Durham Bull Napier. 
 We neglected to state in our last number, in connection 
 •with the engraving of the splendid Durham Bull "Na- 
 pier," that he was bred by Thomas P. Remington, near 
 Philadelphia. This gentleman has gone to considerable 
 outlay of capital, and spared no pains to retain some of 
 the best and purest Short Horn blood in the country. 
 His herd consists of some very choice animals not ex- 
 celleil in Pennsylvania, both of Durhams and Alderneys. 
 The}' will repay a visit by the practical judge of stock, 
 and amateur who enjoys the sight of beautiful and high 
 bied animals. 

Durham Bull Calf. 
 To persons desirous of purchasing a very superior 
 Durham Bull Calf, we may mention that Juno the 3d, an 
 engraving of whom was published in our last number, 
 an I owned by Gerard Cope, has one now about seven 
 weeks old which can be purchased. It was got by Na- 
 pier, the fine bull engraved on the same page. The 
 blood is of some of the best in this section. 

FARM IMPLEMENTS. 

As the season for active, out of doors operations is 
 now at hand, it will be well for the farmer to look about 
 him, and see that his implements are all in proper order, 
 his selections m.ade of such as are wanted, tlie necessary 
 labor for the season secured, and the business of the 
 year well digested and arranged beforehand. When the 
 Bpring fairly opens, every thing of this kind should have 

been fully matured, so that work may go on with en- 
 ergy and despatch. 

In relation to farm implements, from a thrashing ma- 
 chine down to a hoe and rake, such groat improvements 
 have been made that there would be a real profit and 
 economy in throwing away such as are imperfectly con- 
 structed, and procuring others. 

Take, for instance, the old fashioned heavy iron corn 
 hoe, weighing several pounds, and compare it with the 
 light, cast steel implement of the same size now made, 
 and we contend that the hands on a farm could do as 
 much additional work with the latter in one season, do it 
 better and with less fatigue, than would pay for them 
 several times over. The same may be said in respect to 
 the cast steel garden rake, spades, shovels, and many 
 other tools. A few years ago it was thought farm im- 
 plements could have no slrcnr/th without ueight. Now 
 they are made of the best materi.ils, equally strong, but 
 much lighter and pleasanter to work with. They are also 
 in much greater variety, being con.>-tructed with refer- 
 ence to the tcork to be done. Instead of the common 
 pointed shovel for cleaning out a post hole, we now have 
 a perfect instrument for this purpose in the nearly cir- 
 cular post spoon or scoop, adapted to the shape of the 
 hole. Instead of a piece of old board or rail for ram- 
 ming the dirt, we have the cast iron post rammer, which 
 settles it much better and in half the time. 

Instead of one spade and shovel for every purpose on 
 the farm, we have trenching, garden, post, ditching and 
 field spades, with shovels of various sizes and patterns, 
 adapted for particular uses. Expanding and reversable 
 harrows and cultivators, with steel teeth, have superce- 
 ded the cumbrous and unwieldy ones of olden time. 
 Mowing and reaping machines are fast crowding out the 
 scythe and sickle, and with the unloading fork by means 
 of the rope and pulley, are greatly abridging the labons 
 of the harvest. In fine, labor saving machinery has be- 
 come not only a matter of choice but necessity. In noth- 
 ing is improvement more apparent than in the plow, 
 not only has great lightness of draft been attained, but 
 the work is much better done than formerly, and the soil 
 left in better condition for the growing crops. True 
 plowing is closely allied to spading, at least this should 
 be the point aimed at. A fine and minutely pulverized seed 
 bed greatly promotes the germination of seeds, attracts 
 moisture and nutritive gases from the atmosphere, and 
 may be cultivated and freed from weeds with much 
 greater facility than where the sod is turned and allow- 
 ed to h.arden and become baked by exposure to the sun. 
 The success of a crop depends very often on the char- 
 acter of the first plowing. A pi"W of wrong con- 
 struction, however skillful the plowman, can never 
 make good work. 

We would encourage farmers to select the be?t and 
 improved implements of all kinds at the commencement 
 of the working season.
