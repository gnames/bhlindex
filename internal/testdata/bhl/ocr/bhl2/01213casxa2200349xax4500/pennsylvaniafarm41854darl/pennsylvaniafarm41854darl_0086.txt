obliged to any farmer having practical information on 
 die subject, who will communicate it as early as conve- 
 nient through the columns of the Farm Journal. It is 
 proposed to bring tlie water from a well of about thirty 
 feet in depth, located on an elevation 5 or 600 feet dis- 
 t'lnt, by a lead pipe sunk to an average depth of three 
 feet, the pipe to be embedded in charcoal, tan, or some 
 other non-conducting substance, and the milk house to 
 be one half or nearly so below the surface of the ground 
 immediately surrounding the building.

Mr. EnrroR : — In looking over the Register & Examiner 
 of December 17th, my attention was taken by a communica- 
 tion signed "Pro Bono Publico." As he has made .some mis- 
 takes that may do harm where he least intended it, I will 
 make an effort to correct them. But as many of your sub- 
 scribers do not see the Register, I shall have to make a long 
 extract, though at the risk of being served like the Rev. re- 
 viewers, who converted Dr. Franklin to Deism by the long 
 extracts they made from infidel writers for the purpose of 
 refuting them. 

After speaking of ''gangs of men and boys roving over 
 tJio country, destroying the busy defenders of the farmer's 
 crops," and scolding parents for permitting their sons to 
 carry fire arms, ho continues, "Such sentiments are neither 
 now nor strange; they are as old as the settlement of the 
 country. They have been taught by the habits of the fathers 
 to the children from generation to generation, until they are 
 linked to our natures. It is not a century since game was 
 abundant, and hunting occupied a large portion of the time 
 of our ancestors. Habite acquired then cling to the chil- 
 drens' children now. Although game has greatly diminish- 
 ed, the pleasure of the sport is still relished, and the farmer 
 unwittingly encourages the habit by an example of his own. 
 An idea, generally diffused among the agricultural classes, 
 that birds were injurious to the crop.s, caused an indiscrimi- 
 nate war to be made, in times gone by, upon these creatures. 
 In this way while their sacredness was got rid of, their de- 
 struction wa,s endeavored to be accomplished. This idea 
 still exists among us. Nothing more fully establishes the 
 truth of this observation than the annual exhibition of what 
 are termed .scare crows in the corn fields of the country. 
 Rome kinds of birds it is true — the crow, the black bird and 
 the robin — will pull up corn, but who does not know that the 
 worms destroyed by them would, if unmolested, be infinite- 
 ly worse upon the crops than the birds. This old fashioned 
 idea should be abolished. The farmer who draws air lines 
 round his fields, or sets up on a pole a stuffed dress, not only 
 exposes his own ignorance of his true interests, but holds 
 out encouragement to the gunner to destroy the defenders of 
 his grain. AVo li.ave watched these obnoxious birds fre- 
 quently in their endeavors to get to the grain, and have seen 
 ill em commonly fail, wliile the worm at the stalk did not 
 escape their observation." 

Now, Mr. Editor, as I am an old farmer, whoso parents 
 permitted to carry a gun at twelve years of age, and one 
 that ahv.ays put up scare crows, you must acknowledge that 
 I have sufficient casus belli, and I think I will begin by 
 "carrying the war into Africa." AVriters of other profes- 
 sions are very much in the habit of speaking of the igno- 
 rance of farmers, advising them to do this and avoid doing 
 that, when perhaps if they had understood the matter a lit- 
 tle bettor themselves, it might have saved them some an.xie- 

ty. In the first place I deny that "Pro Bono Publico" ever 
 saw a crow "fail" to take up a hill of corn that he had once 
 attacked, unless driven away. And second, he does not 
 know what air lines are intended for. They are not intend- 
 ed to scare away birds in general, but crows in particular. 
 Any observing farmer could have told him that small birds 
 do not fear scare crows ; robins, black birds and wood peck- 
 ers will walk under air lines with as much unconcern as un- 
 der a spider's web. It is only by approaching the crow on 
 what he considers his strong side, (that is, his great cunning 
 and caution,) that human reason triumphs over him. I have 
 never known him to alight inside of a continuous line of 
 small twine stretched round a field ; he seems to think it a 
 wide-mouthed snare ready to spring. I use storekeepers 
 wrapping yarn a few balls will go round a large field. 

I feel sure that taking one year with another, more corn ia 
 destroyed by the crows in Chester county than by the cut 
 worm. Fall plowing is a sure preventative of the latter 
 evil, but I have never found any thing to answer for the 
 former but the much abused air lines. The crow also in- 
 jures corn very much in the fall of the year, by picking the 
 grains off all such ears as protrude from the husk, and fre- 
 quently striping the husk some distance down the ear. 

There is no difficulty in distinguishing the work of crows 
 from other birds. He always takes the whole hill, generally 
 from two to four hills together, scattering the stalks in every 
 direction, frequently in small pieces, (if the corn is very 
 young,) in his repeated attempts to pull it up. The great 
 ornithologist, Wilson, in describing the crow, says: "It is in 
 the month of May and to the middle of June, that the crow 
 is most destructive to the corn fields, digging up the newly 
 planted grains of maize, pulling up by the roots those that 
 have begun to vegetate, and thus frequently obliging the 
 farmer to replant, or lose the benefit of the soil, and this 
 sometimes twice, and even three times." And again, speak- 
 ing of the great crow roosts, he says, "The noise created by 
 those multitudes, both in their evening assembly and re-as- 
 cension in the morning, and the depredations they commit 
 in the immediate neighborhood of this great resort, are al- 
 mo.st incredible. Whole fields of corn are sometimes laid 
 waste by thousands alighting on it at once, with appetites 
 whetted by the fast of the preceding night, and the utmost 
 vigilance is unavailing to prevent a partial destruction of 
 this, their favorite grain. Like the stragglers of an im- 
 mense, undisciplined and voracious army, they spread them- 
 selves over the fields to plunder and destroy wherever they 
 alight." 

It is here that the character of the crow is universally ex- 
 ecrated ; and to say to the man who lost his crop of corn by 
 these birds, that crows are exceedingly useful for destroying 
 vermin, would be as consolatory as to tell him who had just 
 lost his house and furniture by the flames, that fires are ex- 
 cellent for destroying bugs. 

The history of the crow has never yet been written. As 
 Wilson failed we need look no further. The testimony I 
 have yet to offer will I am sure make his friend "Pro Bono 
 Publico" throw up his cause in disgust. Now, Mr. Cormis 
 Corone, stand up by yourself; the attempt made byyourable 
 attorney to unite your fate with the innocent shall not avail 
 you. I accuse you of not only robbing the nests of our do- 
 mestic poultry, but also of destroying the eggs and young of 
 the robin and other small birds. I have repeatedly caught 
 you in the act, flying from tree to tree without noise or even 
 raising above them, looking into every nest, even those he 
 had robbed a few days before, stopping occasionally to peep 
 through every avenue, and listen to every sound. 

My orchard is near and in full view of the house, and di- 
 rectly in my way to a detached part of the farm. As I have
