it to him, after ascertaining the fact in this way, about all 
 ttie ai'^uint'iits and theories of the philosophers that it could 
 oot be. With such reasoniuf; as Mr. Goweu's, every im- 
 provement and discovery in science may bo denied and ridi- 
 • uljd. Certivin principles have been applied in the con- 
 struction of the steam engine and the solar microscope. 
 Their truth has been demon.strated by the fact of those in- 
 struments having been niudc. Because Mr. Gowen and 
 somebody el.9e cannot understand and don't believe in them, 
 ore they therefore untrue? Is Mr. Gowen a believer in the 
 old Grecian philosophy "that universal doubt is the only 
 true wisdom." lie has certain indications by which he 
 judges of a milch cow, and suys that Guenon's system '"pays 
 BO regard to physiological principles as showing the affinity 
 existing between the strip and the lactescent organs of the 
 animal." Now will Mr. Gowen be kind enough to point out 
 •the affinity existing between a small, waxy horn, a taper- 
 muzzle, a mild eye, a bright nose, or a thin tail, (marks 
 which he considers of value,) and the lactescent organs of 
 the animal." Will he explain to tlio readers of the Farm 
 Journal "ihnir phyiioln^ical connection." 

What, Mr. Editor, are the facts in this ease, and matters 
 of undisputed history. Several learned societies in France 
 subjected Guenon's system *<i the severest test-s. Hundreds 
 of cows were examined by impartial committees under a 
 ftererity of circumstances, which made collusion utterly im- 
 possible. It was tested in various places there, under vari- 
 tras circumstances, and the result was positive proof of its 
 originality, its certainty and great value to farmers. Was it 
 not also fully proven in the report of the very respectable 
 ©ommittoe of the Philadelphia Society for Promoting Agri- 
 calture, and has its truth not been fully proven in the actual 
 experience of a large portion of the practical farmers and 
 dairymen of Chester and Delaware county? Is Mr. Gowen's 
 mere ipse dixit "that it is all "sheer nonsense," to weigh 
 against such evidence as this? Let me tell him that practi- 
 cal farmers are, of all classes, the least likely to be hum- 
 "bugged. They are slow, proverbially so, to believe new 
 things, but they have proved Guenon's system to be practi- 
 eally correct. There is evidence in the neighborhood of West 
 Ohester most amply sufficient to convince any man, who can 
 credit his own senses, even if they conflict with a favorite 
 theory. All the good cows in this neighborhood, that yield 
 •an extra amount of milk and butter, correspond with Guc- 
 «on's marks. If Mr. Gowen will produce an inferior mark- 
 ed cow, that holds on to her milk, gives a largo quantity, 
 iiud of a rich quality, I will go and see and yield my point ; 
 and I now challenge bim, or any one else, to produce such a 
 <>no. He attempts to explain those peculiar marks of Gue- 
 non on the escutcheon, by the switching of the tail, her lay- 
 ing down in an uncleanly place, Ac, <tc. This is "sheer 
 lonsense." AVhy, Mr. Editor, these peculiar marks are borii 
 fitli them. They exist in the calf before it has lain down 
 t all, and are well developed at a few woeks old. Mr. Gow- 
 r-n's marks very often accompany a deep milker, but they are 
 rkot invariable. I could show him fine looking animals with 
 iiis marks in perfection, and the cows not worth the'r keep. 
 They do not tell her real value, the qu:iiiiy of her milk, or 
 iho time she will go dry, as I assert Gucn'-n does. Among 
 oy first purchases was a cow with certain marks, which 
 Juenon denotes as indicating a bastard cow, th.at is, one of 
 ihe fir.<t class and order, but going dry directly after calving. 
 t iDouglit her on purpose to test its truth. She went dry six 
 veoks iiftor the calf went off. On another occasion I went 
 ■Tith a friend to a vendue of cows, quite celebrated in the 
 iieighborhoed for their groat aggrogato yield of butter. He 
 was not at all acquainted with Guenon's system, but was 
 coBntod an excellent judge by the ordinary method. He 

soon selected a beautiful animal to bid at. I told him, after 
 examination, she was good for nothing. lie seemed incred- 
 ulous, as the farmer was reported not to have an indifferent 
 cow in his dairy. I went to enquire about her, and found 
 she had been brought there to sell by a neighbor, on account 
 of her utter worthlessness, going dry so long. 

I have examined some of the most celebrated cows in this 
 vicinity by Guenon's system, and have found it invariably 
 correct. "Bessy," formerly owned by Paschall Morris, and 
 who made 15i lbs. of butter in a week, is a striking in- 
 stance of a full and well developed mirror. 

E. T. Cope, of East Bradford, has a cow, marked accord- 
 ing to Guenon, who has made ISJ lbs. of butter in a week. 
 E. T. Williams, of Westtowu, has one that has made 15 lbs. 
 in a week in the winter, and is a No. 1, 6th class cow. 
 W'illiam Ingram, of West Chester, has a small cow, with a 
 well developed mirror, and who makes 14 lbs. of butter per 
 week when fresh. Thomas B. Darlington, of East Bradford, 
 has one, selected according to Guenon's marks, making 12 
 jiounds per week on grass without feed. H. D. Court, of 
 East Bradford, had one selected out of a drove by this sys- 
 tem, and who made, when fed on grass, 16 lbs. per week. 
 Many other instances could be cited. Mr. Gowen says "he 
 can detect a hawk from a handsaw when the wind is south- 
 erly." Let me tell him there are practical farmers in Ches- 
 ter county who believe in applying lime and turning down 
 green crops, and "can see through a grindstone when there 
 is a hole in it." 

Many of the cows above cited, if examined by Mr. Gowen 
 in the dark, would be rejected, and I could show him others 
 which he would be likely to select, from the marks which he 
 relies upon, that no dairyman would own long. Not one of 
 the above cows will go dry more than a month, and some of 
 them milk till calving. Guenon's system is the ojj/y reliable 
 one, as far as my experience goes, which indicates the length 
 of time a cow will give milk, and its quantity and quality. 
 Cows have been selected by this rule, and sold subsequently 
 at vendues for $50 per head, and there is not a dairyman in 
 the vicinity of West Chester, who has given the subject any 
 attention, but acknowledges the truth of Guenon's system, 
 and selects his cows accordingly. 

Isaac Newton, an intelligent and observing farmer in Del- 
 aware county, has also fully proved its correctness, and I 
 have also understood the same of the Hon. M. P. Wilder, of 
 Massachusetts, and Mr. Wilkinson, the distinguished profes- 
 sor and successful farmer, at the Mount Airy Agricultural 
 Institute. I am, Mr. Editor, a bcliovor in the

Centre Counxy Agricultural Society. 
 J. L. D.VRLiNGTON, EsQ. — Dear Sir : — Happening to 
 be in your town some time ago, I was rather surprised 
 when one of the publishers of the "Farm Journal" in- 
 quired of me whether the "Centre County Agricultural 
 Society" was still in existence, and held a fair last sea- 
 son. At his request I will briefly inform you that the 
 society is in exist t-noe and in a prosperous condition. 
 The second annual fair and cattle show was held near 
 Bellefonte on the 5th, Gth and 7th days of October last. 
 The fair was attended by a large portion of the commu- 
 nity, and was certainly worthy of the patronage it re- 
 ceived. The display of stock and agricultural imple- 
 ments, as well as of fruit, and a variety of articles of 
 domestic manufacture, exhibited to a flattering degree 
 the industry and enterprise of our community, as well 
 as the future prospects and benefits of the society. The
