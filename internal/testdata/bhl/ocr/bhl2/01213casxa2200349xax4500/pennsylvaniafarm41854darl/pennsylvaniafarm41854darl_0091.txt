<THE LAWTON BLACKBERRY." 

The above is a drawing from nature of the leaf and 
 fruit of this valuable variety of the bl.ackberry, which 
 must be elevated to at least an equality with any of the 
 productions of the fruit garden. Its history may be 
 given in the following extracts from the official report of 
 the proceedings of the Farmer's Club of the American 
 Institute, at a regular meeting held at their rooms, No. 
 351 Broadway, in the city ofNcw York, August 2d, 1853: 

"A splendid specimen of the blackberry was presented 
 to the society by Wm. Lawton, Esq., of New Kochelle. 
 Many of the berries were from three to four inches in 
 circumference, and a large basket of them were parta- 
 ken of by the members of the Club. Mr. Lawton named 
 the fruit the 'New Rochelle Blackberry,' but the Club 
 changed Us name to the 'Lawton Blackberry,' and ten- 
 dered to him the thanks of the Association, the follow- 
 ing paper having been read previously by Mr. Lawton: 

"This Blackberry — to which I have before called the 
 attention of the club — has been cultivatsd, in small 
 quantities, for several years, in New llocln-lle, Westches- 
 ter county, where I now reside. 1 have not been able to 
 ascertain who first discovered the plant, and brouglit it 
 into garden culture, but am informed it was found on 
 the road siile, and from thence introduced into the 
 neighboring gardens. As it came to me witliout any 
 name to distinguish it from the 'Wild Briimblo,' I bog 
 leave to introduce it to the notice of the club as the 
 'New Rochelle Blackberry,' and, at the same time, pre- ' 
 6 

sent as a specimen a few quarts of the fruit, gathered 
 this morning, precisely as they came from the bushes, 
 without being selected. I have examined many works 
 with a view to ascertain if there has ever been any im- 
 provement on the well known wild varieties, but without 
 success. The 'Double Flowering,' 'Dwarf,' or 'Dewber- 
 .ry,' 'American Upright,' and the 'White Fruited,' are all 
 that are named. The Dewberry is the fir.st to ripen, and 
 the best flavored fruit. The White Fruited seems to bo 
 cultivated as a novelty more than for the fruit. The 
 Upright variety fruits late in the season, is of vigorous 
 growth, and under favorable circumstances produces 
 large mulberry shaped berries, but the seeds are not 
 thickly imbedded in the pulp, and are abundant as to 
 impair materially the quality of the fruit. The Black- 
 berry seems to adhere to its original character with sin- 
 gular tenacity ; or, from the many millions of plants 
 which spring up from "seeds annually distributed in al- 
 most every diversity of climate and soil, we should con- 
 stantly find new varieties. Improving the wild plant by 
 careful cultivation is one thing ; to produce a new varie- 
 ty is nother. The fruit now before you I believe to be 
 of the last named character. It is not like tlie Dewber- 
 ry, or long and mulberry shaped like the 'Upriglit 
 Blackberry,' and the seeds ;ire so completely imbedded 
 in a rich pulp as hardly to be noticed. I think in shape 
 and size tliey compiire very well with the llovey Seed- 
 ling Strawberry."
