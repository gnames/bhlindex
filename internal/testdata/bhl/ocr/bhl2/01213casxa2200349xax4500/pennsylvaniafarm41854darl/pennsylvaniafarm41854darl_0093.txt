The writer acknowledges liis inability to enter into a 
 proper investigation of this matter, and would thei-efore 
 call the attention of those to it who may consider them- 
 selves competent for such an undertaking ; that the 
 Pennsylvania Farm Journal would be a suitable medium 
 for the exposition of the subject ; that time and ta- 
 lents might be profitably applied in so doing, and the 
 farming portion of the community enlightened by the re- 
 sult of what may be produced. One of the questions 
 which has a very important bearing upon the agricultu- 
 ral interests of some sections of the country is that about 
 plowing ; the proper depth of it ; whether this should 
 not, in some measure, depend upon the kind of soil ; 
 whether some ground would not be the better of plowing 
 only three .nches deep instead of six, while a difierently 
 constituted sample would be benefitted by turning up 
 even eight or ten ; and that inasmuch as the upper stra- 
 tum of the earth imder cultivation is composed of so 
 many component parts, or materials, which vary very 
 much in their degree and proportion, when entering into 
 the composition of soils, in different places, should not 
 this circumstance be a modification to any general or 
 fixed rule which could be offered in favor of a uniform 
 standard of deep plowing. THOMAS WARNER.

For the Farm Jourual. 
 PECAN NTJT. 

Mr. Editor : — In the January number of the "Jour- 
 nal" is a very interesting article on the Pecan Nut, from 
 the pen of your correspondent W. D. Indeed, his com- 
 municationfl are always interesting. 

I have a tree of this species of hickory on my place 
 of some thirty years growth, now measuring at three 
 feet from the ground two feet eight inches in circum- 
 ference, and twenty-five to thirty feet high. It has an- 
 nually, for many years, produced a profusion of bloom 
 in the spring, but only within two or three years have 
 I discovered any of the nuts ; these are of full size, and 
 to outward appearance perfect, but not one thus far has 
 been found with anything like a perfect kernel — they 
 are all empty. I recollect many years since on stating 
 to Ct)l. Carr that my tree was large enough to bear, but 
 did not. Mr. Carr recommended that I should graft the 
 tree, for which purpose he offered to furnish me with 
 scions from his large tree, then growing on his grounds, 
 (Bartram's Botanic garden;) however, his tree, as he 
 told me, bore only a few nuts occasionally, and I am 
 not certain whether these were perfect or not. I did not 
 go to the trouble of re-grafting my tree, but let it take 
 its cour.se. 

As this tree is perfectly hai'dy and grows vigorou.«ly, 
 there is no difficulty in its cultiviition; almost any soil 
 suits it if not too dry, though a deep, loamy or alluvial 
 s.^il suits it best. If it would always bear perfect fruit 
 when becoming of mature age, it would be a valuable 
 ad lition to our nut bearing ti-ees. 

As there appears to be some uncertainty about trees 
 raised from the nuts bearing perfect fruit, I would sug- 
 gest, in addition to the recommendation of Mr. W. D., 
 that our nurserymen not only raise the trees from the 
 nuts, but that they also graft them from such trees as 
 a-c known to bear perfect fruit. This mode of propa- 
 gation would undoubtedly have the effect of bringing 

the trees into a bearing state earlier, becoming more 
 prolific, and if a good variety is discovered, when once 
 properly developed, would be perpetuated. Mr. Carr 
 informed me at the time that the grafts take kindly on 
 our common Hickory, and for want of a stock of the 
 Pecan these might be used to advantage. 

Respectfully, &c.,

 A QUERY ANSWERED. 

Mn. Editok: — In reply to the quer)/ in your last num- 
 ber, I would state, that I was formerly engaged in buy- 
 ing and selling grain in one of the largest grain mar- 
 kets in this country, and though I have bought and sold 
 many millions of bushels, yet I do not recollect of a sin- 
 gle difficulty of the kind ever having occurred, to which 
 your correspondent alludes. Nevertheless I can tell you 
 the cuatoni, without knowing any thing about the lato, in 
 such matters, as far as the same has come under my no- 
 tice. 

When a farmer or dealer offers a lot of grain at the 
 market price, we understand it to be the market price at 
 the time of making the offer, unless it is particularly 
 stipulated that the price shall be named at the time of 
 delivery. If the seller makes no allusion to the future, 
 in the transaction, the inference is conclusive that he is 
 selling at the then market price, though it may be some 
 days or weeks before the grain is delivered. 

I have frequently been called upon, in the course of 
 my business, to refer to my books and ascertain the mar- 
 ket price of grain at some previous date — perhaps weeks 
 or months distant— as grain had been engaged then, but 
 not delivered, and the infoi'mation desired was the price 
 of the article at the time of the engagement of it. There 
 is no doubt, therefore, that where there is no allusion to 
 the future, nothing said about the price at the time of 
 delivery, that the price is to be governed by the market 

at the time of the engagement of the grain. L.

Lehigh County Agricultural Society. 

Messrs. Editors: — Through the kindness of the pro- 
 prietors of the "Friedensbothe," I obtained several co- 
 pies of your "Farm Journal," in which I find descrip- 
 tions of different County Agricultural Societies, that 
 of our own excepted. I will give you some facts in re- 
 lation to our society, from which you are at liberty to 
 glean what useful or interesting you may find therein. 
 Allow me here to inform jou that Lehigh county can 
 boast of as good a society as any in the State, taking 
 into consideration the short time of twenty-three months 
 since our first meeting for organization was held, Ave now 
 number over (500 members. 

We have purchased and enclosed a beautiful lot of 8 
 acres of ground, bordering on our borough, upon which 
 we have at considerable expense erected permanent 
 buildings. The main building is 100 by 40 feet, two 
 stories high, also permanent stalls and shedding, suffici- 
 ent to shelter over 400 head of horses and neat cattle, 
 another building for the exhibition of poultry, besides 
 an office building. 

We have within the enclosure a circular rnce course of 
 about one-third of a mile in length, upon which some 
 very good stock in that lino was exhibited We. how-
