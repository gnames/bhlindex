THE FARM JOURNAL. 

[March 

ever, do not sport any of the celebrated Morgsm and 
 Black Hawk horses, (such as at the National Horse Ex- 
 hibition at Springfield, which we had the pleasure of 
 seeing,) but our stock of horses generally is pronounced 
 by competent judges as very good both for road and 
 farm. I, however, cannot speak too highly of the Black 
 Hawk and Morgans. It is a deplorable state of things 
 that our farmers and horsemen generally, not only in 
 this county, but throughout the State, do not see the ad- 
 vantage, use or benefit of introducing that valuable 
 breed of horses; but I am losing the subject. 

We held our second annual fair last September, (28th, 
 29th and 30th,) which was truly great, beyond all expec- 
 tations. I think I may safely say that 15,000 persons 
 were within the enclosure on the second day of the fair. 
 The receipts at the office would warrant my assertion. 
 The display of poultry was astonishing ; it was asserted 
 by visitors from a distance that in that department we 
 ■were equal to any in the State, (I will, however, except 
 that of the Pennsylvania Poultry Society, held in Phila- 
 delphia lately. 

In the horticultural department, as well as the vegeta- 
 ble, the eatables generally were very tastefully and co- 
 piously displayed. The machinery and farm implements 
 were not few. The field crops also had their competi- 
 tors, one of whom was claiming 133 bushels of corn to 
 the acre. 

A plowing match was held within the enclosure, at which 
 both skill and taste were fully brought forth. The me- 
 chanical display was extravagant ; as carriage building 
 is very extensively carried on amongst us, the competion 
 was spirited in that branch. 

Our annual meeting is held in February, when officers 
 for the current year are chosen. The affiiirs of our so- 
 ciety are carried on with spirit and harmony, and from 
 appearances our efforts are cheering. We are destined 
 to become a great and useful society. Truly yours,

EDUCATION WITH LABOH. 

Mr. Editor : — The sulyect of education is now such 
 a popular one, and so much said and written about it, 
 that it is matter of astonishment to see so little yet ef- 
 fected by its advocates. The p'an of Manual Labor Aca- 
 demies has always appeared to me as fraught with im- 
 mense advantages, both to the indigent and the wealthy. 
 An institution of this description, I believe, exists at 
 Gcrm;mtown, and, independently of its sectarian charac- 
 ter, de-erves to succeed. Establishments on this plan 
 must eventually become popular. Every child in those 
 States, wliere the wheel of fortune revolves with accele- 
 rated motion, should receive some kind of education in 
 addition to mere learning, by which a livelihood could be 
 obtoincdin cnses of vicissitude. On the Island of Nan- 
 tucket this is generally practiced, or was some years since. 
 The young men who come from there are many of them 
 coopers, and numerous instances have occurred where the 
 trade has become their sole mode of subsistence. 

These observations have been called forth by a desci'ip- 
 tion given me of the '■'■Manual Labor Academ;/ at Gcr- 
 vumiown,'" in this State, and near the city of Philadel- 
 phia. The premises, I have been informed, contain 
 forty-two acres of ground, several out houses, and a 

commodious dwelling on the main street, with other con- 
 veniences, workshops, gardens, &c. The scholars board 
 with the principal, on simple but wholesome diet, and as 
 much as possible the product of the pupils' labor on the 
 farm. Honest industry, learning and piety are here 
 united. The hours of recreation, I learn, are not hours 
 of waste, idleness and immorality. They are employed 
 in useful bodily labor, such as will exercise their skill, 
 make them dexterous, establish their health and strength, 
 enable each one to defray his own expenses, and fit him for 
 the vicissitudes of life. 

Here is a plan, surely, which unites to obviate every 
 difficulty in the way of learning, while it effectually pro- 
 motes health, prevents the student from becoming a mere 
 book-worm, and qualifies him for future usefulness in 
 two distinct modes — the body and the mind. They are 
 not afraid of the east wind: their limbs rejoice in mus- 
 cular efforts ; sleep comes uncoveted, and they rise from 
 its indulgence prepared for further efforts. Students 
 generally use so little exercise that their muscles dwin- 
 dle, their digestion is disordered, and their heads liable 
 to periodical pains. This health preserving labor, as is 
 justly observed by my informant, is also profitable, and 
 its results are placed to the credit of each manual labor 
 student. Several pupils were found at the end of the year 
 to have very small balances against them for their board- 
 ing and tuition, and some of them almost none, for their 
 labor is credited to each who labor. Some are said to 
 be employed in carpenter work, some gardening and 
 farming, &c., &c., &c. 

There are several prosperous institutions on the same 
 plan in the Union, and similar schools are Iseing located 
 in the western States. Cincinnati can now boast of a 
 like institution on an extensive scale; the west may yet 
 become the seat of the greatest number of well educated 
 men — she may yet show us practically the true way to 
 make education cheap and universal. New York, Mass- 
 achusetts, Kentucky .and Tennessee can boast of similar 
 institutions. I cannot but hope that a few single exam- 
 ples of success, let them occur in what quarter they niay, 
 will serve as beacons to light enquiring minds to the best 
 and most efficient, the chonpest and most healthful mode 
 of getting instruction. Trusting thus to render service 
 to the community, in gratifying my own feelings in ma- 
 king public so useful an undertaking, full of advantage, 
 and destined at no di.-tant day to supercede old nu'tliods, 
 and to coviquer manj' exis-ting prejudices. J. S. G.

C3CCINEL1A BOHEALIS. 
 Me. Editor : — I wish in this coniniuiiicatioii to correct 
 an error, which I fell into in reference to the ciiaracter 
 and habits of the .above named insect, as well as to say 
 simething about Coccinellas in general. In volume 2, 
 page 224, of the Farm .Journal, I stated that the large 
 yellow "lady bird" (spotted with black) did not attack 
 vegetnt'on, but was found upon vegetables only for the 
 purpose of devouring the plant lice (Aphids). That 
 they restrict their diet, however, to plant lice is not true, 
 as subsequent observation and the corroborative testi- 
 mony of several distinguished naturalists of this state 
 assure nie. 

I think it was as early as the year 1S39, that I heard
