a gentleman, an experienced melon grower, remark that 
 he never saw the "large yellow lady bugs" so abundant 
 or so destructive to vines, observing that they had much 
 injured his cucumber and cantelope vines after they were 
 in bloom and bore young fruit. A year or two subse- 
 quently F saw them myself in great numbers upon a wild 
 vine resembling cucumber,, growing along the margin of 
 a meadow. I saw that many of the leaves were eaten, 
 but being then untainted with the mania entoviological, 1 
 paid very little attention to the circumstance. After 
 having had a better acquaintance with this and other 
 insects, and seeing no confirmation of ray former expe- 
 rience, either from personal observation or from the ob- 
 servations of others in published works on the subject, 
 I very readily concluded that both the gentleman allu- 
 ded to and myself had confounded the above named in- 
 sect with the much smaller "yellow striped bug," (dia- 
 brotica vittata,) that is so destructive to all vines, 
 especially watermelon, when they are quite young and 
 tender. I am now convinced that coccinella horcalis, 
 wherever it appears in great numbers, is destructive, 
 and may be very destructive to vegetation, at least those 
 vegetables which are most grateful to its palate, which 
 seems to be the leaves of succulent vines I believe, 
 however, that this is the only true coccinella that does 
 attack vegetable, the others confining themselves to ani- 
 mal food, and as such are very useful in ridding plants 
 of the aphids. Coccinella borealis, from its color and 
 size, is readily distinguished from all others belonging 
 to the same genus. C. mali of a dark red color and 
 somewhat larger in size, is rarely found in this locality, 
 but is quite abundant in the latitude of Lake Superior. 
 The other most common species are c. quotata, "nine- 
 spotted ;" c. abreviata, spotted on the terminal half of 
 the elytrons, (wing covers,) the vasal half being plain; 
 c. 13 maculaia, "thirteen spotted ;" c. munda, without 
 spots; c. 7!or7nc^a, with two spots; and c. 10 maculata, 
 "ten spotted." The last named species is black with 
 yellowish red spots, and the others named are all red or 
 redish yellow with black spots. There are also other 
 allied species of similar habits, and agreeing in their 
 transformations with the description I gave of coc. bo- 
 realis, vol. 2, p. 224, Farm Journal. These insects are 
 generally regarded as the best friends of man, because 
 of the slaughter they commit amongst the plant lice, 
 and with the exception of coc. borealis they are so, and I 
 only regret that his herbivorous propensities has at last 
 compelled me to exclude him from the catalogue of in- 
 sect friends. 

To show how numerous they sometimes occur, and yet 
 the little danger to be apprehended from them, I will 
 quote an extract from "Maunder's Treatise, Nat. His., 
 p. 136: "On Friday, August 13, 1847, the whole of the 
 coast around Southend was visited by one of the most 
 numerous flights of insects on record. They consisted 
 of at least five species of lady-bird, and they came in 
 such dense numbers as for miles along the coast to re- 
 semble a swarm of bees during hiving. The sea de- 
 stroyed countless millions of them, and the grass and 
 hedge rows, and every crevice that afforded shelter from 
 the wind, were covered with their numbers, and for 
 many miles it was impossible to walk without crushing 
 numbers beneath the tread. Every true friend of agri- 

culture, however, hails the appearance of these insects, 
 as they are well known to be the destroyer of aphides, a 
 race of flies the most injurious to vegetation." 

It is stated on the authority of Blumenbach , that lady 
 birds are a good remedy for the cure of toothache, no 
 doubt the yellowish liquid they sometimes secrete on be- 
 ing taken in the hand, if properly analyzed, might be 
 applied to some useful purpose, either as a medicine, or 
 in the arts and sciences. S. S. R.

Mk. Editor : — I am neither so vain nor so silly as to e.x- 
 poct to pleaae every body, nor am I so timid as to shrink 
 from the discharge of whatever duty the dictates of reason 
 and unJcrstanding may impose upon me, through api-rehen- 
 sion of incurring the censure of those whose interests or 
 prejudices might incline them to difTer with me. The man 
 who shapes his courso to avoid all obstacles, and trims his 
 sails merely to cateh the popular breeze, will be found at the 
 end of his voyage to have achieved little else than bis own 
 complacency. Having risked nothing for the benefit of oth- 
 ers, ho will have loft them no now or more reliable landmarks 
 to steer by, nor have made any discoveries promotive of the 
 cause ho professed to have embarked in. Apply this to agri- 
 culture—will it increase the average per acre of wheat, corn 
 and other products of the field? Will it increase the si/.o and 
 quality of our cattle, and render us independent of other 
 states for our beef, butter and cheese ? No, never! It will 
 in this respect leave us where we were long, long ago, where 
 wo now are, and where we must remain, unless something 
 better than more show, glorifications, fine drawn speeches, 
 pretension and quackery bo brought into requisition to urge 
 us to look to a better destiny, and the attainment of a more 
 creditable position. A great man, I believe Mr. Webster, 
 once said, "fine words butter no parsnips ;" nor will editors 
 nor orators fill the barns and stalls as they should be filled, 
 unless they use their types and tongues more to the pur- 
 pose, moro undorstandingly, I had liked to say, more honest- 

ly- 

It had become manifest of late, that whatever improve- 
 ment had been realised, through honest effort, by the friends 
 of agriculture, was in jeopardy by the pretension and quack- 
 ery of those who wore overshadowing the cause by the 
 means they made use of to throw light upon it — the more 
 difficult and mysterious they could make the practice of 
 agriculture to appear, the greater need would there be for 
 the science they professed, to unfold its mysteries. Like the 
 juggler and the quack, they first address themselves to the 
 credulity and apprehension of their victims, in order to ren- 
 der their tricks and nostrums the more admirable and ne- 
 cessary. Under these circumstances, what farmer, having 
 the right spirit within him, could look on unmoved, and not 
 attempt to arrest, or whistle off the pack that, in full cry, waa 
 running agricultural improvement into the giound. It is 
 true that though many see and deplore these irregularities, 
 there are but few who will openly step forth to correct or re- 
 buke them. They complain in private, and disapprove only 
 by withdrawing themselves from associations they cannot 
 countenance, under the rule, "let every one take care of his 
 toes, as Jack Donkey said when he danced among the 
 chickens." But the rule should be, not to admit the donkey 
 or the fox into the poultry yard, and it should be the study 
 of every farmer to assist in keeping them out, no matter 
 what kickings and brayings, quirks and tricks they may 
 practice on account of their expulsion or exclusion. That 
 the philosophic and scientific faculty will raise a terrible
