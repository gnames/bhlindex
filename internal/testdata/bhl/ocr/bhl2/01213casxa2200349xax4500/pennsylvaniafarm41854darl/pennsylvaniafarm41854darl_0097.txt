butter," a designation significant of excellence in many of 
 the European market.'!, and it is surprising that '"Rusticus," 
 who, it seems is a traveller and made the grand tour, is not 
 familiar with the term. 

I must also deny in toto, without any qualification, that 
 the Durham, as your correspondent says, is "an artificial 
 animal, very subject to disease and peculiarly liable to 
 consumption, especially in this climate," and doubt whether 
 he can produce even the shadaw of proof to back this alle- 
 gation ; on the contrary they are the most healthy and ro- 
 bust animals to be found, and seldom are sick, except under 
 highly improper treatment. Another ill-judged, ill-ground- 
 od objection of his. (so notoriously erroneous, that I marvel 
 he should be so reckless as to have made it through a jour- 
 nal published at AVest Chester,) is that the Durhams 
 are hard feeders, "consuming as much hay and grass as an 
 elephant." Now the very reverse is the case, as admitted 
 by all, that in early maturing and easy feeding they have no 
 equals. Let any one observe the Durhams and Alderncys, 
 or common oattlo, at pasture in the .same field, and he will 
 perceive that the Durhams are lying a considerable portion 
 of the day ruminating, while he will scarcely ever find the 
 others at rest, but on foot, eating and grabbing, seemingly 
 all the time unsatisfied. Then as to winter feeding the same 
 ditference will bo app.arent, if the cattle have proper care in 
 common, the Durhams will be found plump, and if with calf 
 rather fat, while the others will appear gaunt and in lean 
 condition. Hundreds of examples might be adduced to 
 prove the extraordinary health and constitution of the Short 
 Horns or Durhams, and by consequence, their remarkable 
 aptitude in maturing and fattening; an instance of this may 
 bo found in the two young Short Horn steers, raised by Mr. 
 Brinton of Chester county, now exhibiting at the Black 
 Horse in Market street. It may be asked, could any two, 
 four or six pure Aldcrneys, bo fed for beef, to four years old, 
 the ago of the above steers, to sell for as much money as 
 these two steers shall have been sold for ? No, not six of 
 them, though two of them would consume as much fodder as 
 the steers. The .story of the London dairyman keeping 
 Durham.s because they gave thin milk, so as he could swear 
 "he did not water it," is unworthy to bo mentioned by your 
 correspondent, as it bears on its face such marks of fiction 
 that it would require a very responsible name, indeed, to ob- 
 tain credence for it with considerato people. I have heard 
 the same jest often before, but its paternity was ascribed 
 sometimes to an Irish New York milkman, and sometimes to 
 a Yankee. In the same disingenuous spirit, your correspon- 
 dent has quoted Mr. Coleman, whoso evidence he makes to 
 darken counsel, or to pervert what Mr. Coleman did really 
 say in chief of the Alderneys, in other words, the learned 
 "Rusticus" gives the exception and not the rule. I admit 
 Mr. Coleman as good authority, but then ho should bo per- 
 mitted to tell the ichole truth, and here it is. In volume 2d, 
 page 319, of his Agricultural Tour, made between 1814 and 
 '48, he says, "they are in general exceedingly ugly, small, 
 thin, coarse boned, and presenting little more than the skel- 
 etons of animals, covered with a yellowish, flabby and coarse 
 hide." Now I put it to all good judges of cattle, whether a 
 description can be conceived, conveying a worse condition of 
 unhcalthinemi, unprofilahlcncus and worthlessnens than this? 
 And yet this was the general condition in which Mr. Colo- 
 man found the Alderneys so recently in England, whore cat- 
 tle are so well cared for; and this is the very Mr. Coleman that 
 "Rusticus" made to tell a different Uilo, by which he thought 
 to overwhelm and confound me ! From this it will appear 
 that the worst I said of the Alderneys falls far short of tbo 
 bad character given them by Mr. Coleman ; it is, however, 
 but fair to state the exception to his significant, general rule. 

lie gives what he had heard, and what many have beard, of 
 two jxen fattened by Sir Charles Morgan, weighiog some 
 one thousand six hundred poun('a each, but does not speak 
 of the age of these oxen, or the e.-spense of producing these 
 monstrosities of the Alderney tribe. He mentions that ef- 
 forts were being made to improve this breed, and isays he 
 saw one of these improved animals, which "gave the best 
 promise of any he had seen of what a cow should be," but 
 he does not say from what quarter or cross this improvement 
 was derived ; if from the Alderneys themselves, and the rule 
 that "like begets like" holds good, it is little less than a mi- 
 racle that the animal was what a cow should be; it is-, how- 
 ever, a solitary instance — "one swallow don't make a sum- 
 mer." 

The late Mr. Physick, for several years a neighbor of mine, 
 is pressed into service by your correspondent to show that 
 Mr. P. took premiums for Alderney butter. Well, what if 
 he did ? Were his Aldcrnies a profitable investment? Quite 
 the contrary. The "thick cream and yellow butter" was a 
 hobby with him, and cost him dearlj-. lie had a beautiful 
 alcove lined with white marble for a spring house; when, ae 
 I often did, I remonstrated withhim for keeping such cattle, 
 which, in the language of Mr. Coleman, always looked like 
 "skeletons," and pointed out to him the danger of using th» 
 milk of such ill conditioned cows, ho would accord to me 
 that I was right, but still the "thick cream and yellow but- 
 ter" prevailed. This claim and boast of thick cream, Ac, i» 
 the delusive cry that leads U< the fashion of having Alder- 
 neys. Finding it so pervading, and the animals which 
 yielded it so ungainly and wretched, led me to observe more 
 closely the cause of this phenomenon, and I fonnd in general 
 the worst conditioned cattle, whether Aldemej's or common 
 cattle, giving the thickest milk and making the yellowest 
 butter, admitting, however, that the quality of the food af- 
 fects the color of butter,andthatmany have injured theircows 
 by over-feeding with corn meal, Ac, to produce a boastful 
 j-ield. When I have seen the wasted carca.'sesof the Alder- 
 neys, and have heard that their milk was too rich for checne, 
 it occurred to me that their thick milk was owing to .a weak 
 and deranged system that wastes, or suffers to escape in ex- 
 cess, fatty matter from the blood, not properly clabor.ited' 
 into a pure milk, such milk as a eow h.aviug a sound and" 
 healthy constitution would make. Should this be the ca*e, 
 the milk of such diseased cattle is neither fit for butter nor 
 cheese. Another common delusion is the claim that the 
 yellow skin of the Alderneys is a sign of their propen.'iity to 
 give rich milk : I consider this condition of the hide of the 
 animal to be more indicative of disease than of any thing 
 else, and in general it will be found, on close inspection, that 
 the skin is mangy or otherwise in bad condition — the milk 
 from such animals cannot be saf«; it may bo apprehended 
 that cutaneous diseases, and affections, both mental and 
 physical, may be imbibed from the milk of diseased cattle.. 
 The heads of families cannot bo too particular in this re- 
 spect, and physicians would render an essential service to 
 the community, which in no wise would derogate from their 
 professional stamling, did they point out these dangers to- 
 the families they visit, and take steps to insure to them' 
 wholesome milk. Let one of those yellow skin cows be 
 slaughtered, and her beef will look as if she had died of the 
 jaundice. 

I shall, Mr. Editor, have to invoke your j-ationce, and 
 likewise your magnanimity, for having control of the types, 
 and having, in common with "Rusticus," taken a premature 
 and decided stand against my remarks at Mercer upon the 
 Alderneys, it would be but equitable to permit your readers 
 to hear both sides by affording mo a fair hearing; in further- 
 ance of which I beg leave to refer to "Youatt on Cattle/' »
