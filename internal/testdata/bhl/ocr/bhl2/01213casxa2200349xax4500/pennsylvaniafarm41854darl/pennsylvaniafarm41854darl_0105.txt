of cultivation. He, however, had been for several years 
 iu the practice of selecting his seed potatoes -when he 
 gathered his crop, and of laying aside for that purpose 
 none but well grown and well formed tubers; while our 
 practice had been to put the potatoes in a heap in the 
 cellar for the family to select from as they were wanted 
 for use, until planting time came round, when the best 
 of what was lelt were selected for seed. These different 
 processes were thus carried on side by side, with the 
 same stock of potatoes, for eight or ten years, with the 
 result above noted, a result which was very striking and 
 constant for several of the last seasons. At length the 
 Mercer potatoes were introduced by both families, and 
 no opportunity for a similar comparison has since oc- 
 curred. Since then the subject has been too much ne- 
 glected, though occasionally I have selected my seed 
 with much care for two or three years in succession, and 
 I have believed that the quality of the produce was im- 
 proved in such cases; but not being in the way of raising 
 potatoes much beyond what was necessary for family use, 
 I have sometimes been scarce of seed, and have been led 
 to plant tubers of an inferior quality, so that what I 
 gained in one period has been to a large extent lost in 
 another from want of the necessary care and attention. 
 Last season I planted a small lot with a very large pro- 
 portion of branching irregular and ill formed tubers, cut 
 into pieces as usual ; while from another lot such pota- 
 toes were carefully excluded, and when we compared the 
 produce of the two lots with each other, it was found 
 that its character corresponded in both cases in a mark- 
 ed degree with that of the seed planted. 

These imperfect observations seem to show that con- 
 siderable improvement may be made in the quality of the 
 crop by a careful selection of seed, but I am not able to 
 say that the quantity was increased by such means. 
 Almost uniformly an increase of size seemed to be con- 
 nected with a diminution of numbers, so that the quan- 
 tity did not appear to be materially affected, though no 
 careful comparisons were made to determine the point. 

The general law or principle indicated by the above 
 facts is obvious, and it is obsei'vable in almost every de- 
 partment of animal and vegetable life. It may be sta- 
 ted thus, viz : â€” There is a tendency in individual plants 
 (particularly when under cultivation) to assume occa- 
 sionally some peculiarities of constitution and habit of 
 growth, and there is a further tendency in nature to 
 transmit these peculiarities to succeeding generations. 
 Thas some potatoe plants acquire the constitutional 
 habit of forming comparatively few tubers, and as a na- 
 tural result developing these mf-re perfectly, so that by 
 planting these and these only, we may bring our stock to 
 consist mainly of such individuals as possess this pecu- 
 liarity of constitution. In the same way any other de- 
 sirable property may propagated whenever a tendency 
 to it is observable, provided it be not inconsistent with 
 the health and vigor of the growing plant. 

It is this tendency in individuals of a species to as- 
 sume peculiar properties, which has given rise to all 
 those improved forms of fruits, flowers and vegetables 
 which fill our orchards and gardens, and which add so 
 much to our enjoyment that we may well consiiler it one 
 of Heaven's best gifts to man. It is. however, most fre- 
 quently manifested in plants which are raised from seed, 

though it is not confined to them as we have abundant 
 proof in different classes of vegetable productions. 
 Among tulips for instance I have frequently observed it. 
 Many instances have occurred in my own garden, where 
 individuals of this species have assumed peculiarities of 
 stripes and shades of color, after the parent stock had 
 been cultivated by offsets from the roots for a number 
 of years ; and where pains were taken to plant them, 
 they have generally maintained their distinctive charac- 
 ters so as to form new varieties. 

It must be admitted, however, that such changes as 
 those referred to are few, when compared with those 
 Avhich take place in plants of this species when raised 
 from seed; for among such the varieties of form and 
 color seom to be limited only by the number of plants 
 j'ou have propagated. So it is also with the potatoe ; if 
 you raised plants from seed you may expect to have al- 
 most as many varieties as j'ou have individuals, and 
 many of these will be widely different in appearance and 
 habit, so that you may occasionally develope a very supe- 
 rior variety. 

But although the range of the modifying power, which 
 may be brought into action when we propagate fi-om di- 
 visions of the root, is not sufficient to produce very great 
 changes from the parent stock in the case of j)otatoos, 
 I am well satisfied that it is sufficient to improve the 
 quality in some important particulars, so that it will 
 make an important difference in the course of a few 
 years whether we select the best or the worst of our crop 
 for planting. 

And I would advise every one who wishes to cultivate 
 only good potatoes, to avoid doing as I have done, that 
 is, leave the selection of seed potatoes till the cooks have 
 picked out the best, but let him regularly select his seed 
 from the head of the heap when he gathers in his crop, 
 for in this way only can the advantages of selection be 
 fully realised. 

I am fully conscious that the facts referi'ed to have 
 not been observed with that care and attention which is 
 necessary to guard effectually against error, or with that 
 particularity which is needed to define them with clear- 
 ness and precision ; yet I fully believe that they are in 
 the main correct, and that the conclusions drawn from 
 them may be of advantage to those who would cultivate 
 this delicious vegetable to the best advantage. In this 
 belief these remarks are offered, and such as they are 
 they are at the service of the Editor. W. J.

To one quart of new milk, add one pint of warm water 
 before it is strained, and it will increase the quantity 
 one-third. This is of great importance to the numerous 
 milk sellers of Delaware and Chester counties; first, by 
 increasing their profits, which is of some con.^equence to 
 them, and secondly, they can supply more customers 
 with milk, which is a wholesome luxury at this season 
 of the year. J. S. G.
