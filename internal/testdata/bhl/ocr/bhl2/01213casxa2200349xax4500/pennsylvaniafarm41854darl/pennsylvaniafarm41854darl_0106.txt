PIERMONT. 

The annexed engravings represent the beautiful resi- 
 dence, with ground plans, of Geo. Peppek Noreis, Esq., 
 near Wilmington, Del. — a fine specimen of pure Gothic 
 architecture. In the absence of a detailed description 
 of this very complete and elegant country seat, which 
 was promised but failed to reach us, we will briefly men- 
 tion that the building has been finished and furnished 
 with all the luxuries and conveniences of modern life ; 
 the out houses conform in style to the architecture of the 

main dwelling ; the grounds are being tastefully laid out 
 and planted with trees and shrubbery, and the whole 
 premises bear the impress of the good taste and liberal- 
 ity of the proprietor. 

The building is constructed of blue granite, taken 
 from quarries on the farm, and being situated on a com- 
 manding hill near the city, is a prominent object of at- 
 traction to the neighborhood. The building was design- 
 ed by .John C. Carver, Architect, of Philadelphia.
