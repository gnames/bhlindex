[March 

and we see them of all sizes from those drawn by old wo- 
 men and dogs, to those taken by two horses ; in every case 
 the place of chains being supplied bj' ropes to draw with. 
 Such are the objects that attract the farmer's attention on 
 getting upon one of the roads leading west of town. 

There are in the low lands bordering on the woods, 
 already noticed, large tracts of ground that have been plant- 
 ed with trees ; and so close together are they, in the wet 
 swampy ground, as well as on that which is somewhat dry, 
 that I rambled amongst them sometime, supposing I Avas en- 
 joying the scenery of the vegetable kingdom as it came 
 spontaneously from the earth, before I noticed that all the 
 trees were as regularly arranged as the corn hills in a corn- 
 field. But the larger trees in the forest do not present this 
 peculiarity. 

I have not yet been sufficiently far from town to get be- 
 yond the vegetable raising districts which extend for several 
 miles around where the land is sufficiently elevated to avoid 
 the floods of the river. Hundreds of acres without a fence 
 are used to raise such vegetables as are generally confined 
 to our country gardens. 

Late in the fall, we see th e remains of a crop which 
 can be distinguished for miles across the country, by its 
 deep yellow flowers, upon examination they prove to be of 
 the Natural Order Cruciferje I think the Brassica Napus 
 from which they extract large quantities of "rape-seed" oil. 

I am now writing by the light produced by burning it. It 
 is decidedly the best thing I ever met with for the purpose. 
 Our ordinary oil is not easily procured of a good quality, 
 (at least such was my experience in Chester county,) can- 
 dles burn down and leave a greasy residue, and burning 
 fluid is not at all times safe, besides the products of its de- 
 composition are injurious to the eyes. But this rape oil 
 combines all that is good, with nothing objectionable about 
 it. And German lamps are well worthy of imitation be- 
 ing so constructed as to allow one to fill it and regulate its 
 light without geting soiled fingers, a matter of no small im- 
 portance either to those who use the needle or the pen. 

I have been thinking seriously whether the manufacture 
 of this oil could not be carried on profitably in the United 
 States. I intend to visit the place in this city, at which it is 
 manufactured after which I shall detail to you the method 
 of doing it. In the meanwhile if any one of your readers is 
 disposed to try it, I shall be very happy to send over the seed 
 in time for a crop next summer; Will not some one volun- 
 teer to make an effiart to introduce it. Perhaps some one 
 has tried it; or at least calculated the cost of so doing; if so he 
 must pardon my ignorance on the subject. 

It might be remarked that the oil sells here at about the 
 same price as ordinary, or rather inferior oil, in the United 
 States, while other vegetable productions generally are rath- 
 er dearer, if there is any differrence. I remain yours, E. P. 

Notes from an Address delivered by Philip K. Freas, 
 Esq., before the Tredyffrin Agricultural Society, Dec. 
 10th, 1853. 

Mr. Editor; — I hope, on the recception of this, j^ou will 
 admit that something more than a "promise" (as you said in 
 the "Farm Journal" of the present month) of a notict> of 
 Major Freas' Lecture has boon received, and also hope, that 
 the author of that interesting and valuable discourse, will 
 excuse me for the p-ivilege I have taken, and if I have 
 made any errors that he will correct, or apprise me of them. 
 Such an address is well worthy of publication, and if I have 
 errod on any point, it is in notgiving him the credit he de- 
 Berves. In r.spoct to "the Major," all that I need say is, 
 that THE LADIES WERE DELIGHTED WITH HIM 
 AND HIS LECTURE— what more need I say in favor 
 of it? 

But to the Lecture — what did he say, and can we profit 
 by it? Let your readers peruse and consider these notes, 
 practice their precepts, &c., then report to us through your 
 valuable Journal, and we shall be better able to decide 
 whether they profit by it or not, certainly if they read, they 
 will find much of interest and worth. I. R. W. 

After a few preliminary remarks; Mr. Freas stated the 
 subject for his discourse. "Practical Horticulture, in its 
 relations to Ar/riculture." He stated that this subject, more 
 than anj' other connected with Agriculture, had engaged 
 his attention principally on account of its being more neg- 
 lected on the part of farmers, than any other, though, he 
 considered it by no means the least profitable of the farm- 
 er's business, even in a pecuniary point of view. But, said 
 he, when is added to this the comfort, and pleasure which it 
 bestows, and the harmonizing influence which it exercises on 
 the family, it transcends within its limited sphere, all others 
 in its social character. In passing through the country at 
 the proper season, there is nothing so pleasing to the eye, 
 or so grateful to the feelings, as a comfortable lookini;- dwel- 
 ling surrounded by choice shade trees and having attached 
 fo it a spacious, well laid, and well attended garden. But I 
 regret to say that this cheerful sight, this almost certain in- 
 dex to a happy intelligent family, is not encountered so 
 generally as it should be. 

He then proceeded in a conversational, plain and practical 
 manner, to communicate the plan on which he cultivates 
 his farm of two acres. 

Mr. Freas is an ardent lover of horticulture and agricul- 
 ture, and has for many j-ears endeavored to call the atten- 
 tion of the public to the importance of these subjects — in 
 fact, I have been informed, that he was the first person in, 
 or out of Pennsylvania, who introduced an agricultural de- 
 partment into a newspaper, which idea he conceived, when 
 an apprentice boy at Norristown, Pa., and has steadily pre- 
 sevcred in it from his dehut as an editor, to the present time, 
 a period, I think, of more than twenty-five years. 

In order to awaken the attention of the public to the 
 subject, and also that he might practice what he so earnest- 
 ly advocated, and recommended to others, Mr. Freas, about 
 six ye.ars and a half since, commenced this species of agri- 
 culture on his own premises. The plot of ground which 
 constitutes his vegetable garden is astonishingly small, in 
 proportion to the amount it produces — 225 by 82 feet. When 
 this spot of ground came into his possession, it was a quag- 
 mire, impassible to man and beast, escept in dry seasons, 
 a spring of water, rising in an adjacent lot, passed through 
 it, and the ground being low, a regular swamp was formed, 
 covered with basket willow. Not intimidated by appear- 
 ances, he set to work, deeply ditched the little stream and 
 walled it — a French Drain was made and about 500 cart 
 loads of earth hauled upon the plot. The whole was repeat- 
 edly plowed, and in a short time was ready for cultivation. 
 His garden was laid out with great care, not forgetting to lay 
 out the main and principal avenues of a good width, a very 
 important feature, which should never bo neglected. His 
 success in the culture of vegetables the first year, was so 
 encouraging that he e.xtended the variety of the products the 
 next year, and raised about three times the quantity con- 
 sumed in the family, (consisting of ten persons.) 

The following is the product of a season : 

Four crops of corn, commenced using, July 11th, Onions, 
 Lettuce, a general assortment of Herbs, Artichokes, Okra, 
 Oyster Plant, Endive, quantities of Asparagus, celery 4 J feet 
 long, 125 heads of Cabbage, (ho always puts up a quantity 
 of Saiir Kraut from the Drumhead Savoy variety) 6 kinds of 
 beans freshfrom beginning to end of the season, soveralkinds 
 of Peas, including the Japan Pea, Cucumbers, Tomatoes by 
 the cartload. Beets, Carrots, Radishes throughout the season, 
 squashes, the marrow pumpkin, (considered the best) five 
 baskets cantelopes, equal to to the best Jersey production. 
 Egg Plants, Turnips ; on a bed, 48 by 16 feet, he had 15
