for excellence — 2d, they still flourish in our cities — 3d, the 
 authority of our most distinguished pomologists has been 
 adverse to the doctrine of the wearing out of varieties. 

Some of the uppoucnts of Knight's theory point to many 
 of t!io new pears, as already exhibiting symptoms of dooay 
 or bad health, in localities whore the reputed worn out kinds 
 have ceased to flourish. This, we contend, is only an evi- 
 dence of the limited durations of these particular kinds. 
 For all will acknowledge that many others of the now varie- 
 ties have not yet exhibited the slightest symptoms of decay 
 or bad health in the infected districts, which they should do, 
 if the cause of the decay or bad health wore extraneous, in- 
 stead of being constitutional. Let any one plant a number of 
 eeed of pears, apples, or other fruit; and expose the plant 
 thus produced, as wo have repoatodl}' done, to the scorching 
 summer's sun, the extreme cold of winter, and to all the in- 
 clemencies and vicissitudes of our climate. The inevit.ablo 
 result will be, that many of them willpurish; some in a week, 
 some in a month, and others at dilToreut periods of time ; the 
 duration of the existence of each being limited, ceteris pari- 
 bus, by its natural constitutional feebleness. A similar di- 
 versity in the limited duration of the life of children is seen 
 by us daily; one will effectually resist the same influences 
 that will prove fatal to another; and this resisting power is 
 aot always dependent on external developments, but on an 
 intrinsiu constitutional vigor. 

In the article on the duration of varieties, in the Fruit 
 and Fruit Trees of America, Mr. Downing makes the follow- 
 ing remarks: "We consider the Belgian mode of producing 
 new varieties greatly inferior to the English one — since it 
 gives us varieties often impaired in health in their very ori- 
 gin. If any further proof of this is desired, we think it is 
 easily found by comparing the robust vigor and longevity of 
 many native pear trees to be found in the United States — 
 some of them 80 or 100 years old, and still producing largo 
 crops of fruit — with the delicate trees of several new varie- 
 ties, now in our gardens, from Europe. Those varieties are 
 delicate not only with respect to their constitutional vigor, 
 but th'^y are also more susceptible to injury from the severi- 
 ty of our winter's cold and summer's sun." 

After such an admission from one who advocated the un- 
 limited duration of varieties, we are not surprised that even 
 Mr. Downing, towards the close of his brilliant career, 
 should begin to question the correctness of the opinions he 
 had formerly entertained on this subject In the 6th vol- 
 ume of the Horticulturist, page 371, after giving the views 
 of De CandoUe in favor of the permanency of varieties, Mr. 
 Downing adds : '"We are not sure th.at De CandoUe's theory 
 will hold good with the finest fruits and florist's flowers. 
 The species might be recovered, bat we question whether in 
 many instances that will be the case with the variety." . 
 . . . . "With regard to improved varieties, as they are 
 understood in a horticultural point of view, they are doubt- 
 less prone to decay, in proportion to their degree of depar- 
 ture from the physiological perfection, which enables the 
 wild variety to maintain itself continually on the surface of 
 the globe, independent of the care of man. A wild variety 
 will produce seed under favorable circumstances, but many 
 highly improved varieties, in a horticultur.al sense, do not 
 perfectly mature their seeds under any circumstances what- 
 ever; and, therefore, must bo physiologically imperfect, and 
 being so, a priori, if it be admitted that imperfection is a 
 principle of decay, it will not be denied, that no plant im- 
 perfectly constituted can carry on its functions but for a 
 more or less limited time, even under the most favorable cir- 
 CumsUmces." 

This direct and unequivocal admission, by Mr. Downing, 
 that some varieties have a more or less limited duration, 
 clearly indicated that an important change had taken place 
 in his views respecting the wearing out of varieties ; — a 
 change which, we are inclined to believe, would have been 
 more thorough and complete h.ad his life been prolonged. 

A few of the advocates of the unlimited duration of vari- 
 eties attribute the cracking of the fruit of the White Doy- 
 enne and of other deteriorated kinds to the depredations of 
 insects or parasitic fungi. It is a well established fact that 
 insects and vegetable parasites are prone to attack enfeebled 
 or diseased plants in preference to others ; and that they 
 rarely do material injury to those in which the vital force 
 maintains its original vigor. A suitable nidus for the devel- 
 opment of the germs of the Cryptogami is not presented by 
 healthy vegetable productions. The commencement of de- 
 cay in a tree, or a decline in its constitutional vigor, from 
 some cause or other, are essential requirements to the growth 

of parasitic fungus sporulcs. Moreover, if the cracking of 
 the fruit were owing to the ravages of insects or cryptoga- 
 raic parasites, indep<'ndontly of any enfeebled condition of 
 the variety, then all other varieties grown under the same 
 circumstdfcces shall also suffer in a similar way from the 
 same causes ; but they do not 

AVe have already incidentally remarked, that the White 
 Doyenne still flourishes in our cities. Similar success at- 
 tends the inter-mural cultivation of most of the reputed 
 worn (mt kinds. >Since this is the case, it is triumphantly 
 asked — how can they bo considered worn out? The same 
 inquiry could have been just as appropriately and exultingly 
 made a few years ago, respecting these same varieties, which 
 then bore fine and fair fruit in various other localities in 
 which they are now utterly worthless. 

The truth is, these varieties receive a degree and kind of 
 protection in our cities which will enable them to resist and 
 counteract for a time, and it may be for a long time, the per- 
 nicious influences that tend to impair their constitutional 
 vigor. Medical men well understand the vast importance of 
 appropriate hygienic measures in oases of impaired health. 
 By judicious management, an improvement will generally 
 take jilace in all the functions of the body, and life may be 
 prolonged for years. But eventually a period will arrive, 
 when all human agencies will cease to be beneficial. By 
 well directed treatment, deterionited varieties of fruit may 
 also be partially renovated. And, in some instances, the 
 return will more than compensate for the outlay. But more 
 frequently the trouble and expense of the extra management 
 will bo ruinous to those who enijage in fruit culture for 
 profit. W. i). BRINCKLE, M. D. 

Corn Harvesters. 

Gardner A. Bruce, of Mechanicsburg, 111., hasinventod an 
 improvement in machines for harvesting corn stalks, on 
 which he has .applied for a patent. The nature of the inven- 
 tion consists in so arranging the cutters that they will bo 
 caused to revolve and cut in an upward direction and after 
 cutting the stalks will give them a direction toward the cen- 
 ter of the machine. Inclined revolving shafts are also employ- 
 ed with .arms for bending and holding the stalks while being 
 cut, and afterward throwing them into the receiver at the 
 centre of the machine. The propelling wheels are each pro- 
 vided with a separate axle, so that an open space is thus left 
 at the center, and two revolving shafts with radial arms, 
 in combination with a spring catch are employed for holding 
 the stalks until a bundle is collected. — Sci. Am.

The Society is in a very flourishing condition, and h.aa 
 had two very creditable fairs. It is an excellent way to gath- 
 er the men of a County, into one fraternal meeting each year. 
 It far surpasses militia trainings in the instruction gained and 
 the order that prevails. A. B. A.
