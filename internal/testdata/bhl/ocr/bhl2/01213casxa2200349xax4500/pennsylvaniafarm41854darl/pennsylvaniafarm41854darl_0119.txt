Eemarks at the Conversational Meeting of the National 

Poultry Society at New York, by David Taggart, Esq. ' 

Ladies axd Gentlemen : — As this is my "first appear- j 
 ance on any stage," you are expected to make largo allowan- | 
 ces for the performance. 

Mr. President : — I fancy I have been requested to open i 
 this most extraordinary council, not because of any great 
 fitness I possess, but, because, having been brought up to , 
 the law, I am sujiposed to have more impudence than an , 
 honest man. You know, sir, impudence is now-a-days at ' 
 least three-fourths of an orator's stock in trade. (Mr. Bar- | 
 num interposing, "I hope you don't mean to be personal.") 
 But seeing a medical lecturer, a clergyman, and two or three 
 editors about, I am inclined to question my title to the i 
 post. j 

As you are aware, sir, I made a chicken speech last week 
 at Albany, long enough to tire you and every one else that 
 heard it. In that I told all I knew. (If I told no more you 
 are probably surprised it was so long.) That speech has 
 been asked for publication, and unwisely given up for that 
 purpose, so that if I attempted to make another I might bo 
 caught at the very ungraceful trick of tolling an old story. 
 I will, therefore, content m3'self with the fewest possible 
 words to answer the jiurpose. 

If I were not entirely free from that blessing and cause of 
 humanity, which men call ambition — that Janns-faced pas- 
 sion, which in one age elevates nations to grandeur and 
 glory, in another desolates a world — I should have shuned 
 this and every other similar occasion. For although the 
 subject is highly useful and praiseworthy, it is not one that 
 a man can freight with the best jewels of h'S mind, and send 
 it forth to win for him a reputation before the world- But, 
 sir, I am not bound to adapt my fancies to the taste of every 
 brainless ass that chooses to bray at me. I intend to talk 
 about chickens whenever it suits me, either in private or 
 public. 

It is very common for men who don't know the difference 
 between a turkey and a goose, (it would puzzle some of them 
 mightily to tell tho difference between themselves and a 
 goose,) to ridicule us and what they are pleased to term our 
 chicken mania. Why should they ? 

The man who spends his life in fields, forests, deserts and 
 mountains, searching for and classifying wild birds and 
 beasts, is looked upon with admiration as tho friend and the 
 benefactor of humanity. As one who loves nature in all her 
 untold myriads of animated forms, I rejoice that it is so. 
 While birds send up their songs of praise to God for free- 
 dom and happiness, for the fullness and beauty of tho earth, 
 for the warmth and the light of Heaven, I rejoice that tho 
 names of Audubon and Wilson will be unforgotten. They 
 have built themselves monuments as imperishable as man's 
 love of genius, beauty and power. AVhilo perfumed and bo- 
 jeweled fools have sunk into graves that no man knows or 
 cares for, these uncouth searchers after science are passing 
 down the stream of ages to posterity, among "the few im- 
 mortal names that were not born to die." 

The man who searches life-long among shells and plants 
 and Howers is not ridueuled for his pursuit of nature's mys- 
 teries. He too is ranked as a benefactor of his race, for he 
 too contributed to the mighty mass of human knowledge. 
 Then why should wo be ridiculed ? The objects of our in- 
 quiry are not only most curious and beautiful, but most use- 
 ful and indispensible; promotive of man's comfort, wealth 
 and happiness in every ago and section of the world. They 
 are not of low degree in the grand scale of creation. In an- 
 imated nature thoy belong to the first great division — tho 
 same as man himself — and to tho second class — the next be- 
 low man. By their quick generations and proliiicness they 

enable us to find out more of the wonderful results and se- 
 crets of breeding in five years, than can be lourni-d from 
 your Durham cattle and Arabian steeds in twentj'. 

Mr. President, he who improves the meanest tiling on 
 God's earth, expands that instant into a philanthropist, for 
 God's earth is man's home, and ho contributes by his im- 
 I)rovement to its beauty, plenty or comfort. I care not if he 
 limit his energies to the improvement of musquitoes (if you 
 like) by breeding thorn withoni bilh, or the rearing of poiiti- 
 cians without so much love of country, or the propagation of 
 patriots without their ''blood and thunder" eloquence. Still, 
 sir, even for these littlo things he merits the thanks of the 
 world. 

Then why should not we bo entitled to some praise, when 
 our object is to improve greater and better things, such aS 
 geese, ducks, turkej-s and Shanghais? See, sir, what we 
 have done already. Four years ago, a well known and re- 
 spectable gentleman of this city wrote that it required a 
 good cock of any breed in line condition to weigh S pounds. 
 Now we have in this show stags ten months old that weigh 
 12 pounds, and quite a number that come pretty near it. If 
 all this has been effected in four j'ear-, who shall foretell the 
 final result of this most wonderful progression. Notwith- 
 standing some deplorable luck, I don't intend to give it up 
 until, in the language of our report. Shanghais are sold like 
 bull beef in the market by tho quarter, and in roasts, steaks 
 and chops. (It makes the Secretary's '"chops" water to talk 
 about it.) 

Of course, it would not be proper on this occasion to draw 
 these merely prefatory remarks out into a speech. Instead 
 of doing so I will throw a few shells into the camp, and if 
 they explode so much the better. It will set you talking, 
 and that is the object. Without pledging myself to back 
 them up with assertions or arguments, I will submit the fol- 
 lowing propositions : — 

First, That all the purely bred large Asiatic fowls, known 
 under the various names, buff, red, black, white, grey and 
 spangled Shanghais or Cochin Chinas, Chittagongs and 
 Brahma Pootras, are sufficiently alike to have one common 
 name — colorbeing the only appreciable distinction. 

Second, That all full crested or top-knot fowls should be 
 called Polands, and never Ilumburgs, because Hamburgs are 
 a distinct and well marked family, alreadj' sufficiently nu- 
 merous. 

Third, That no permanent intermediate variety can be 
 established. In spite of all that man may do to the contra- 
 rj^ things will get back to the path in which the great crea- 
 tor started them. Ho made all the kinds he wanted to peo- 
 ple this earth, and he will unmake all others. 

Fourth, That, under ordinary existing circumstances, 
 fowls will flourish in an inverse ratio to the numbers kept. 

Fifth, That not one pullet in ten of an}- breed will lay be- 
 fore six months old, and that a largo majority of big breeds 
 will not produce eggs before seven or eight months. 

Sixth, That no hen, without the aid of a patent nest, will 
 lay more than one egg a day. 

Seventh and lastly. That our President, to speak in poul- 
 try parlance, is a "good egg," and deserves great credit for 
 his successful efforts in tliis cause, and further that wo our- 
 selves are "some pumpkins ;" but for fear tho reporters 
 might pervert tho expression, and write it that "some of us 
 are pumpkins," I had better withdraw it. 

But seriously, sir, this show from beginning to end has 
 been a great and decided triumph, not only in regard to the 
 quantity and surpassing excellence of the specimens, but 
 the loud expressed and universal approbation of the people. 
 Better Black Spanish, Shanghais, or Brahma?, were never 
 seen anywhere, and this is the opinion of every unpreju-
