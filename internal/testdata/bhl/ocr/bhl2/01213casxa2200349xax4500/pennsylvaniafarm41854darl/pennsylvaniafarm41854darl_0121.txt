 THE DROP WORM.* 

Permit me to call the attention of the readers of the 
 Farm Journal, especially those who cultivate and value 
 good and beautiful shade and fruit trees, to the existence 
 of an insect enemy, whose presence is conspicuously vis- 
 ible at the present time, and the destruction of which is 
 easier affected now than perhaps at any other season of 
 the year. The particular species to which I allude, so 
 far as I can learn, has not been heretofore described, 
 (although analogous species have,) and I therefore pro- 
 pose to call it Oikrtkun Peiist/lvanici/s, but it is better 
 known, especially about Philadelphia, by the common 
 names of drop-worm and baakef-worm, and recently in an 
 editorial in the Ledger, it is called the tree-worm, a rath- 
 er vague and indefinite title, as there are so many differ- 
 ent kinds of worms that infest and injure trees. The 
 German name of Sacktrager, sack bearer, would be much 
 more applicable. No matter, however, about the name 
 just now, it is the animal itself which is of the most im- 
 portance. 

I have had this insect under observation for nearly 
 three years, and have been enabled to see it in all its 
 various states and transformations, and I do not hesitate 
 to say its history presents a phase of insect life that is 
 remarkably interesting. I have also made drawings of 
 it in its different states of progression from the ova to 
 the imaijo, and have written a scientific description of it 
 as well as its history, which only needs a single personal 
 observation on the tince, and its appearance on immedi- 
 ate exclusion from the egg, to be finished ; after which, 
 by your permission, I propose to publish it in your Jour- 
 nal. But as it may then be too late in the season to be 
 "forearmed" through this "forewarning," I have thought 
 it advisable to admonish all concerned of the necessity 
 of loping off from the trees all those little pendant folli- 
 cles, in which arc housed a multitude of eggs, which are 
 eure to bring forth a multitude of destroyers so soon as 
 the foliage is sufficiently advanced to afford them food 
 and shelter. Open and examine them, and you will find 
 no living insect there, but in the sack of the last year's 
 female you will find a number of eggs, varying from six 
 hundred to a thousand, (I counted 901 in one,) nicely 
 packed away, with short flossy silk, in the female pupa 
 case. From this it is apparent that they possess, in an 
 emineiU degree, the power to "multiply and replenish," 
 in the approaching season, the evils that were only inter- 
 rupted by an intervening winter ; for they go on multi- 
 plying and destroying as long as the foliage remains, .or 
 until cool weather sets in. In this locality they seem to 
 be partial to the linden trees, then silver maple and 
 Lombardy poplar ; but I have observed them in large 
 numbers, indiscriminately, also upon apricot, quince, 
 apple, plum, pear. &c. The only tree that seems to en- 
 joy an immunity from their depredations is the pe.'ich, 
 and also to some extent the cherry. 

Many no doubt will be cut off tlirough the pruning 
 operations that usually take place during this month, 
 but to get entirely rid of the evil, all of those little dan- 
 gling sacks should bo carefully removed from the trees 
 and burned. It will not do simply to cut off tlie bi-anch- 
 es and have them remain upon them, for the work is only 
 imperfectly done then. This should also be observed by 

the whole community, for if one individual removes them 
 from his premises, and others do not, his trees invite the 
 surplus population of his neighbors, or if only a single 
 person in a community neglects it, his premises form a 
 nucleus from which the evil radiates in all directions.

 SWEET POTATOES. 

Mk. J. L. Darlington : — Having seen something in 
 the Farm Journal upon the culture of the Sweet Pota- 
 toe, I am induced to offer the following crude remarks 
 thereon, which may possibly be acceptable to some of 
 your numerous readers. 

In the spring, as soon as all danger ft'om frost is past, 
 the hot bed for sprouting the potatoes should be made 
 by boarding off the space intended therefor in a warm 
 situation, and filling it to the height of two or three feet 
 with manure from the horse stable, and upon this a lay- 
 er of three or four inches of fine chip dirt must be 
 placed, upon which the potatoes may be laid as closely 
 as possible, and covered about two inches in depth with 
 the same material, or with any fine rich earth. If the 
 weather -should prove very dry, an occasional watering 
 with tepid water, or warm soapsuds would be beneficial, 
 or if the nights should be cold and frosty the hot bed 
 should be protected by covering it with any material 
 most convenient. When the sprouts are sufficiently 
 large to warrant good roots, they may be pulled from 
 the potatoes and planted in ridges previously pre- 
 pared. 

The ridges are mostly made by throwing two furrows 
 apart with the plow, and applying some M-ell rotted ma- 
 nure, then covering the same by returning the earth, 
 thus forming a ridge of the height of ten or twelve 
 inches, in which sets are to be planted six or eight inches 
 asunder. The best time to plant them is immediately 
 before or after a rain, or during a spell of damp weather, 
 or even in the cool of the evening, if watered occasion- 
 ally until faii'ly established. 

The ground must then be kept mellow and free from 
 weeds until the vines pi'event further culture. When 
 the vines are killed by frost, the potatoes should be ta- 
 ken up, and after remaining in the shade a short time to 
 dry, those not intended for immediate use may be packed 
 away in dry sand or earth in barrels or boxes, by first 
 placing a layer of sand and then one of potatoes, until 
 the vessel i.s filled. Upon the approach of cold weather 
 they should be placed in a situation secure from frost. 
 In this manner they have frequently been kept till May 
 or June. In packing them away, all potatoes that have 
 been injured in taking up sliould be laid aside for pres- 
 ent use. A soil moderately fertile and somewhat sandy, 
 with a southern aspect, is mostly prcfi'rred for the sweet 
 potatoe. AR. KF.
