No. 2. — Knight's Early Black. — A most admirable 
 eai'ly clieriy, resembling the Black Tartarian, though 
 much more obtuse in form, but ripening nearly a week 
 earlier, or about the tenth of June. It is one of Mr. 
 Knight's seedlings, a cross-breed between the Bigai-reau 
 or Graffion and the Mayduke, originated about 1810, and 
 is universally admired. 

Fruit large, a little irregular in outline, obtuse heart- 
 shaped. Stalk of moderate length, rather stout, (much 
 more so than in the Black Eagle,) and inserted in a deep 
 open cavity. Skin dark purple, becoming black. Flesh 
 purple, tender, juicy, with a rich and sweet juice of high 
 flavor. Tree spreading.

No. 3. — BiGARREAU. — Tliis noble fruit is the Bigar- 
 reau par excellence, and is unquestionably one of the 
 largest, most beautiful and delicious of cherries. It was 
 introduced into this country about the year 1800, by the 
 late William Prince, of Flushing, and has been very ex- 
 tensively dis-seminatcd under the names of Yellow Span- 
 ish, Graffion, and Bigarreau. The tree is short but 
 thrifty in growth, making strong lateral shoots, and 
 foi-ming a large and handsome head with spreading 
 branches — and it commences bearing abundantly and 
 regularly even while young. Its very large size and 
 beautiful appearance, together with the firmness of its 
 flesh, render^.it a very valuable variety to cultivate for 
 market. 

Fruit very large, and of a beautiful waxen appear- 
 ajice, regularly formed, obtuse heart-shaped, the base a 
 good deal flattened. Stalk stout, nearly two inches long, 
 inserted in a wide hollow. Skin pale whitish yellow on 
 the shaded side, bordered with minute carmine dots and 
 deeping into bright red finely marbled on the sunny side. 
 Flesh pale yellow, quite firm, juicy, with a rich, sweet, 
 and delicious flavor if allowed fully to ripen. In per- 
 fection the last of June. 

Tliis is often confounded with the following sort, from 
 which it is casilj' known by its long and broad leaves. 
 It is mo.st commonly known in the middle states as the 
 Yellow Spanish, an incorrect name, which has been ap- 

plied to two or three sorts, and the cherry so-called by 
 the older poniologists does not now appear to be Icnown. 

No. 4. — Doavning's Red Cheek. — A very handsome 
 and excellent seedling chei-ry, just raised at this estab- 
 ment, and which promises to be a charming addition to 
 the dessei-t. It somewhat resembles t'ne Bigarreau, but 
 is more tender and sweet, and rather more highly color- 
 ed. 

Fruit rather large, regularly obtuse heart-shaped, 
 with a pretty distinct suture. Skin thin, (slightlj' pellu- 
 cid when fully ripe,) white, with a rich dark crimson 
 cheek, (somewhat mottled,) covei'ing more than half the 
 fruit. Stalk an inch and a half long, set in an even 
 hollow of moderate depth. Flesh yellowish, half tender, 
 and of a very delicately sweet and luscious flavor. 
 Leaves coarsely serrated, with dark footstalks, llipens 
 a few days before the Bigarreau, or about the 14th of 
 June. 

FIG. 5. 

No. 5. — Elton. — The Elton, a seedling raised in 1806, 
 by the late President of the London Horticultural Socie- 
 ty, is certainly one of the first of cherries in all respects. 
 Its large size, early maturity, beautiful appeai-ance, lus- 
 cious flavor, and productiveness, render it universally 
 esteemed. It is a cross-bred variety raised from the Bi- 
 garreau or Graffion with the White Hart for its male pa- 
 rent. The trees grow very vigorously, and are readily 
 known, when in foliage, by the unusually dark red color 
 of the footstalks of the leaves. 

Fruit large, rather pointed, heart-shaped. Skin thin, 
 shining pale yellow on the shaded side, but with a check 
 next the sxm delicately mottled and streaked with bright 
 red. Stalk long and slender. Flesh somewhat firm at 
 first, but becoming nearly tender, juicy, with a very rich 
 and hiscious flavoi", not surpassed by any large cherry 
 known. Ripens about the middle of June, or directly 

after the JIayduke.

 REAPER TRIALS. 
 Dear Sir : — As a manufacturer, I desire to enter my 
 protest against any more petty trials of rcapei-s. They 
 cost a great deal and amount to nothing. The decision 
 at one trial is reversed the next week at another, per- 
 haps with the same machines, and often the competitors 
 can .show their defeat v.-as owing to some extraneous cii--
