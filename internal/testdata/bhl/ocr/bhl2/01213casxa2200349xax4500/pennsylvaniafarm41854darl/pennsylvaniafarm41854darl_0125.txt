In our huppy Anierieii, yea Pennsylvanlii, wc surely 
 stand in the midst of the mighty theatre of God's pro- 
 tective power; and we should feel an unusual proximity 
 to our Creator. Tha Wuj and tran<piil sky spreads it- 
 self over our heads, and wo acknowledge the intrusion 
 of no secondary agent in unfolding this vast aiul beauti- 
 ful expanse. Nothing but tlie great omnipotence can 
 work up the dark and fearful liorrors of the tempest, 
 dart the flames of lightning, and roll the long resound- 
 ing rumor of the thunder. The sweet and refreshing 
 breeze wafts to the senses tlie odor of God's benificence, 
 the voice of God's power is recognised in the forest, and 
 all the varied scenes of existence, activity and pleasure, 
 which he observes at every movement, in the crowded 
 citj-, where wealth and power corrupts the more nobler 
 virtues of man, down to the peaceful and huppy home of 
 the farmer of the soil, lead him impariially and irresis- 
 tibly, one vvould think, to tlie source of being, beauty 
 and gratitude. 

How propitious such an existence to tlie nobler opin- 
 ions of piety ! Besides, the situation of the husband- 
 man is peculiarly favorable, it would seem, to purity and 
 simplicity of moral sentiment lie is brought acquaint-

 Employed solely in bringing food out of the earth, he is 
 not liable to be fixscinated with the fictitious pleasure, 
 the imnatural wants, the fashionable follies, and tyranni- 
 cal vices of more bustling and splendid life. J. S. G.

Suggestions to the Ixecutive Committee of the Penna. 

State Agricultural Society. 
 To the President and Executivt Couimitice of the Feiuisi/lva- 

nia State Agricultural Sociefi/ : 

Gextlemen : — After having retired from your board, 
 I deliver to you my valedictory, and respectfully present 
 to you the following suggestions : 

You have the thanks of the farming community. You 
 have raised them out of a state of apathy throughout 
 the country. That salutary excitement has called into 
 existence agricultural societies in many counties. It has 
 also called into existence our excellent Fjvrm Journal, 
 which is really worth its dollar and ought to be in every 
 farmer's family. You have now kept up that excitement 
 for three years. If I have not attended regularly to 
 your stated meetings, it was because I thought it unne- 
 cessary to travel a long distance merely to assist in or- 
 ganising an agricultural show. 1 left it to those gentle- 
 men who lived in the immediate vicinity of Harrisburg. 
 Dut it is now higli time that something substantial — 
 sometlmig tangible — should be done that will be really 
 beneficial to the farmei", otherwise this now so salutary 
 excitement will soon die away. Agricultural fairs ought 
 only to be confined to county agricultural societies. It 
 is merely a secondary matter. Farmers are willing to 
 assist at them, but not to travel a considerable distance 
 with their stock. The State Agricultural Society ought 
 to occupy itself with more important matters. No prac- 
 tical farmer will pretend to say that agricultural exhibi- 

tions will directly and substantially improve agriculture. 
 County agricultural fairs are agreeable meetings among 
 farmers Avhero neighbors, who are mutually acquainted, 
 can give each otlier useful information. 

I am sori-y to see the committee on crops recommend- 
 ing to raise the premiums. It is a useless waste of the 
 funds granted by the State. AVhat benefit wiU it be to 
 agriculture? Has the Pennsylvania farmer no other im- 
 pulse than to be stimulated with a few dollars to im- 
 prove his fai-m ? Don't present him with reports of 
 doubtful authority ? No farmer in Chester, Lancaster 
 or Berks county, will undertake to raise one hundred 
 and fifty-ciglit bushels of shelled corn to the acre. Such 
 a phenomenon appears to be reserved to thenoilhwest and 
 southwest of this State. 

The farmers of Pennsylvania have hundreds of thou- 
 sands of horses and cattle, and no veterinary sui-geons 
 to attend them but self styled horse doctors and cow 
 doctors. The Pennsylvania State Agricultui-al Society 
 has now a fund of fourteen thousand dollars' Now, 
 gentlemen, choose a central town, accessible by different 
 raihoads, erect a building for a veterinai'y college, and 
 geological and mineralogical institute. Pi-ocure compe- 
 tent professors of the veterinary art, also a professor of 
 geology, mineralogy and agricultural chemistry. Give 
 each a salary of one thousand dollars, the amount grant- 
 ed to you by the State. I will not ent«r into a more 
 minute detail of its organization, which is left to the 
 consideration of your board. 

lii my youth I attended a course of lectures for two 
 months on practical anatomy in dissecting horses. It 
 has given me so much information, that Avith the assis- 
 tance of veterinary works, as to attend to my own horses 
 when sick without the assistance of so-called horse doc- 
 tors. It would soon be seen that our young farmers 
 would flock to such an institution, principally in winter 
 time : seasons when practical anatomy can be performed. 
 It would also throw much light on the merits of the dif- 
 erent breeds of cows, to ascertain where t!ie milk oi-gans 
 are the strongest developed. 

The geological department would al.-o find much favor 
 with our farmers' sons. The professor taking his pupils 
 on frequent excursions to explain the different parts that 
 constitute the soil, its bearing and effect to the growth 
 of plants, also what is necessary to promote and stimu- 
 late vegetation, &c., &c. 

The farmer would see there its real utility, and give 
 his hearty pecuniary support to the State Agricultural 
 Society. It would, of course, be more useful if an ex- 
 perimental farm and farm school could be connected 
 with it, but the present situation of the State finances 
 will not permit it. To organise them on a small scale to 
 admit only a few pupils would create dissatisfaction and 
 jeahAisy. Such schools should be located in different 
 parts of the State, according to the different quality of 
 the land, and accessible to a largo number of pujuls.
