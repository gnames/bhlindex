ken roots ; make the cut from the lower part, so that 
 the cut surface may be down. Head in, by cutting off 
 the ends of branches of hii-ge trees. See to peach trees 
 that the worm is not at work. If the earth was removed 
 from the body of the trees hist fall, put a shovel full or 
 two of wood ashes around each tree, and return the 
 earth that was taken away. Quince trees should be dug 
 around and well manured ; we have found that salt scat- 
 tered under them answers an excellent purpose in pro- 
 ducing fair fruit. Gooseberries, currants and gi'ape 
 vines two years old, from cuttings, should now be trans- 
 planted in places; in digging the holes, make them large 
 and deep, filling in what was before occupied with sub- 
 soil witli sui-face loam, leaving the subsoil on the top to 
 become improved by the contact of sun and air. These 
 should be heiivily manured, as the goosebery and currant 
 are rank feeders. All transplanted trees should be 
 mulched by putting around the roots manure hay or 
 straw. Grafting apple and pear trees may still be con- 
 tinued till the leaves begin to expand, if the grafts were 
 cut in season and properly taken care of. Cherries, 
 plums and peaches should have been done last month. 
 Remove all insects from trees, and apply wash before 
 recommended, and remember that trees need cultiva- 
 tion. 

Vegetabie Gakden. — This is an important month 
 in the garden. Finish planting out esculents for seed, 
 and at a distance from others of the same genus. All 
 kinds of seed may usually be planted this month, reser- 
 ving such as are tender of frost till the last. Make 
 plantations of asparagus. Plant out rhubarb, horse 
 radish and onion setts. Sow peas, radishes, lettuce, 
 every few days for a succession. Plant out cabbages, 
 cauliflower and lettuce from cold frames. Plant Lima 
 beans, cucumbers and melons in pots, under frames or 
 in inversed sods, to set out when weather is settled. 
 Transplant medicinal herbs, and, sow seeds for more. 
 Keep ground hoed and stirred and free from weeds. 
 500 pounds of guano to the acre has been found equal 
 to ordinary dressing of manure for vegetable grow- 
 ing. 

Flower Garden. — Conthiuo the directions given last 
 month, all such work as pruning roses, and flowering 
 shrubs, honeysuckles and creepers of ail kinds, laying 
 sod, planting box edging, transplanting herbaceous 
 l^lants, manuring and digging the flower beds, should be 
 concluded this month. Continue to plant evergreens, 
 and all kinds of shrubbery. In the rage which exists 
 for ever blooming plants, some of the brightest gems of 
 the flower garden seem to be thrown completely in the 
 shade, we Avould gladly lend a hand to bring them into 
 the simshine, (especially WiegUia Rosea, Forsythia 
 Veredissiraa, Spirea Revesii, do Prunifolia,) for this rea- 
 son, that they bloom before the earliest rose. If the 
 weather is suitable, flower seeds may be sown on a warm 
 border the latter part of the month. A good method to 
 plant them is to break the soil very fine, (if the soil is of 
 a clay nature, mix a little sand to loosen it, otherwise 
 the seeds ■will not be able to germinate,) then take a six 
 inch flower pot inverted, and press the soil, sow the seed 
 in the ring made by the flower pot, if the seed is very 
 fine, merely pressing it with the flower pot will be found 
 sufiicient ; other kinds should have a little soil Btrew(,d 

lightly over them. A good lesson is to be learned on 
 this subject if we observe the successful germination of 
 seeds di-opped from the parent plant. Tulips, hyacinths. 
 Narcissus, &c., may be planted the early part of this 
 month. Plants that have been wintered in cellars should 
 be brought out the latter part of the month ; but previ- 
 ous to that they should have fresh air admitted to them 
 as freely as possible. 

Clements' Live Stock Agency. 
 The Plow, Loom and Anvil says : While in Philadel- 
 phia recently, we visited the extensive live-stock agency 
 of Aaron Clements, Esq., in Cedar street. Mr. C. has 
 the choicest breeds of cattle, horses, sheep, turkeys, 
 ducks, hens, &c., &c., constantly on hand, which he is 
 selluig at a fair price, and thus affording the agricultu- 
 ral community easy and cheap facilities for improving 
 their stock. He ships to any part of the Union, and or- 
 ders may be given by mail with every assurance they 
 will be promptly and satisfactorily answered. Mr. C. 
 has been engaged in i-aising stock for more than a quar- 
 ter of a century, and possesses unusual qualifications for 
 conducting such an agency.

RAISING WHEAT AND CORN. 

[The following directions for raising wheat and corn 
 are from the pen of an excellent practical farmer:] 

In order to raise a good crop of wheat on most soils, 
 it will be necessary to sow no more ground than you can 
 well manure. If the land is good, the wheat may either 
 be sowed broadcast over the ground, say two bushels to 
 the acre, or drilled in. After the ground is well plowed 
 and harrowed, sow from the middle of the 9th to the 
 1st of 10th month. Select the best wheat for seed. Be 
 careful to have it free from other seeds. On 9^ acres I 
 x'lJised the last year 333 bushels of wheat, averaging 36 
 bushels to the acre, and weighing G2 lbs. to the bushel. 
 It was the white chaffed jMediterranean variety. 

My method of raising corn is to lime the ground the 
 summer before it is intended to be planted, say from 40 
 to 50 bushels to the acre; plow the following spring 
 about eight inches deep before the ground has ceased 
 freezing; plant about the 1st of 5th month, and not later 
 than the 10th. I have raised for years in succession 
 from 50 to 80 bushels to the acre, planting the same 
 ground but once in 8 or 10 years. I select when we are 
 husking the best com for seed. Tliine respectfully,

Apples without Seeds or Cores. 
 A correspondent of the Memphis Whig gives the fol- 
 lowing receipt for obtainmg apples without seeds and 
 cores : — Take the ends of the limbs of an apple tree, 
 where they hang low, so as to reach the ground, dig a 
 hole for each end imder the tree, bend it down and bury 
 it in the hole, confining it down so that it will remain. 
 Do this in the winter, or beginning of spring. The end 
 of the limb thus buried will take root, and put up sprouts 
 of scions, which, when they become sufliciently large to 
 "set out," dig up at the proper season, and transplant 
 shem in the orchard where you wish them to remain. 
 When they get large enough to bear, they will bear ap- 
 ples as above. [Doubtful.]
