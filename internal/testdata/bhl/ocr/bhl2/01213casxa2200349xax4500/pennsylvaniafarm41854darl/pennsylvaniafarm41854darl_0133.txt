DEEP PLOWING. 

We must again urge upon our readers the great im- 
 portance of deep plowing in the first breaking up of their 
 ground for corn. We hear it often said that it is better 
 to plow shallow for corn, and to go deeper for the suc- 
 ceeding crop of oats, but we have seldom found this to 
 be done, if the proper depth was not attained in the first 
 breaking up of the sod. 

In nearly every section of the country there will be 
 found farms where the soil has not been stirred, since the 
 forest was cleared, deeper than three to five inches, the 
 latter depth being considered an extreme. We know of 
 one case where a farmer tlireatened to whip a lad about 
 16, who was his plowman, all around the field, if he was 
 able to detect the least evidence of upturned yellow clay 
 when the plowing was finished. 

The consequence of this unreasonable practice has 
 been to restrict the supplies of food for crops to a given 
 and limited portion of soil, and by a continued pi'actice 
 of cropping for a long series of years, to exhaust this of 
 the necessary inorganic elements which enter more or 
 less into the constitution of plants, and are as indispen- 
 sable to their healthy growth as air, light or heat. A 
 friend of ours, near Philadelphia, raised last season one 
 of the best crops of oats in his township by simply plow- 
 ing six inches deeper, on an old, worn out and neglected 
 field, than the plow had ever before gone, and â– ftdthout 
 any manure. Our fi'iends in the South are often ridi- 
 culed for their wasteful habits of farming, and disposi- 
 tion to leave their lands worn out by improvident cul- 
 ture, and commence again their system of exhaustion on 
 a new soil. The sons of many of our northern farmers 
 are guilty of the same thing, and consider farming 
 will not pay when their crops are yearly diminishing, 
 chiefly for want of going a trifle deeper with the plow. 
 There is literally a mine of mineral wealth very often an 
 inch or two below the depth of our ordinary plowing, 
 and which only needs turning up to the influence of sun 
 and air to be immediately available. Another very im- 
 portant advantage is, that by a greater depth of soil you 
 counteract the effects of a too dry season, or a too wet 
 one. In the one case, the roots have a chance to pene- 
 trate in search of moisture, and in the other, the excess 
 of water has an opportunity to pass oS", and not stagnate 
 about the roots of plants. 

Subsoil, double Michigan, and deep mould board 
 plows are more sought for the present spring than we 
 ever recollect to have known, and we hail it as one of the 
 very best signs of the times. The reason and common 
 sense of the thing are too obvious to escape the atten- 
 tion of the intelligent farmer. While we willingly admit 
 that a cold subsoil, turned up to the sun for the first 
 time, may not be immediately favorable to the quick ger- 
 mination and early growth of seeds, we also say that the 
 remedy is most obvious. In the present era of fertili- 
 zers, a very trifling expense for superphosphate of lime, 
 guano or poudrette, to each hill of corn, will stimulate its 
 early growth till the roots are able to push down in search 
 of food. We have repeatedly seen and known corn 
 planted on contiguous farms the same season, on shallow 
 and deeply plowed land, where no stimulu.'- was applied 
 to the hill, and although on the former the oorn appear- 
 ed to have the advantage for the first few weeks, it has 

been invariably excelled by the latter before the season 
 was over, both in quality of product and appearance. 
 We hope where farmers are dubious on the subject, they 
 may be induced to try part of the field, by attaching an 
 extra pair of horses or oxen to the plow, and letting it 
 sink 8 to 10 inches, and then giving us the comparative 
 results next fall in the Farm .Journal. 

ROOT CKOPS. 

We hope farmers, who have heretofore neglected the 
 appropriation of a piece of ground for root crops, will 
 not neglect it the present spring. To those who have al- 
 ready proved their great value for winter feeding to 
 stock nothing need be said. No farmer who has once 
 raised a crop of roots would ^Nallingly be without them. 

Carrots, sugar beets, ruta baga, parsnips, all have 
 their advocates, and it would be well for the beginner in 
 root culture to try a portion ot ground with each, and 
 thus test their comparative value and productiveness. 

Carrots are the general favorites, both for horses and 
 neat cattle, and the demand for them for the former is 
 rapidly on the increase in our large cities. At the pres- 
 ent price of grain, there is great economy, as well as ad- 
 vantage to the horse, in substituting a half peck of car- 
 rots for the oats once a day, and his condition will be 
 greatly improved by it. Carrots have been frequently 
 raised at the rate of 1000 to 1400 bushels to the acre, 
 and for milch cows in the winter season they are proba- 
 bly unequalled by any other root crop. With their aid 
 and a very small quantity of meal, cows may be kept to 
 their milk for the three or four winter months without 
 difliculty. It is often said that a winter dairy Avill not 
 pay. This we can readily believe if cows are confined 
 to dry hay and meal, especially at the present prices of 
 grain. To make good butter in winter, they must not 
 only be supplied with plenty of nutritious food, but par- 
 ticularly such as is juicy and succulent. Eutter of the 
 first quality has readily commanded in Philadelphia mar- 
 ket, the past winter, from 31 to 50 cents per pound, and 
 nothing has been quite so difi&cult to obtain even at those 
 prices. AVith the aid of roots and proper management 
 of cows in other respects,' they may be kept in profit at 
 least one-fourth of the year longer. It is idle to expect 
 cows to give rich and wholesome milk and butter, unless 
 some attention is paid to the requirements of the animal 
 economy, and the raw materials furnished them from 
 which only it can be manufactured. 

Several requisites are important to root culture. A 
 deep and rich soil, thorough preparation of the ground, 
 and fine pulverization, effected by repeated plowings and 
 harrowings. The ground after being deeply plowed, as 
 soon in the spring as possible, should be kept harrowed 
 every few days till the seeds are planted. This has the 
 effect to destroy millions of weeds, which just germinate 
 and will be killed by exposing fresh surface.* of earth to 
 the hot sun before they become rooted. If the seeds of 
 weeds are left to start, and grow to some size, and their 
 extirpation postponed till tlie crop is in the ground, a 
 vast amoimt of labor with the hoe will be required and 
 great additional expense. 

Carrot seed is often steeped with advantage from 12 to 
 24 hours in soft water, and then rolled in sand or plas- 
 ter. It is rather slow in vegetating.
