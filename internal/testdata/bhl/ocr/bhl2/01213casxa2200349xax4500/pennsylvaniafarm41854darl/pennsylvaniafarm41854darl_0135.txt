number of six inch pots with a compost of two-thirds 
 loam, and one-third rotten dung, as follows : three stout 
 pieces of broken pots were placed in the bottom, and a 
 full handful of the compost put in ; a stout wooden pes- 
 tle was then used with all the force of a man's arm to 
 pound it, and then another handful and a pounding, and 
 another, till the pot was brimful, and the compressed 
 mould as hard as a barn floor. The pots were then ta- 
 ken to the straAvberry bed, and a runner placed in the 
 centre of each, with a small stone to keep it steady. 
 They were watered in dry weather, and have had no oth- 
 er care or culture. For two or three years I have had 
 the very finest crops, from plants after this method, and 
 those under notice promise well. If the pots are lifted 
 it will be apparent that a large quantity of food is in a 
 small space. I may add that from some recent experi- 
 ments with compressed earth to potted fruit trees I have 
 a high opinion of its effect, and I fully believe that we 
 have yet much to leai-n on the subject. 

Guano and Superphosphate of Lime— Answers to Corres- 
 pondents. 

In reply to enquiries by several subscribers about the 
 best mode of applying guano, we recommend that it be 
 plowed in as soon as possible after being spread. Its 
 most valuable constituent, the volatile carbonate of am- 
 monia, being dissipated and lost by long exposure to the 
 atmosphere. In cases where it has been profitably ap- 
 plied as a top dressing, it has probably been chiefly owing 
 to particular circumstances, such as a wet spell 'of weath- 
 er, or immediately preceding a fall of rain. There is 
 very little danger of covering too deep. We have known 
 it plowed in, and the ground subsoiled at the same time, 
 with very mai'ked benefit. 

C. M. A. asks us, "what is the most valuable fertil- 
 zer for grass lands in the spring." We reply superphos- 
 phate of lime, and of the many ai'ticles sold under this 
 name, we can only say our oion experience, and that of 
 many farmers in this section, is in favor of that made by 
 Prof. Mapes. This has been fully tested on pasture and 
 mowing grounds near West Chester. As to the way of 
 making the superphosphate at home, we refer to an arti- 
 cle in our .January number by Thomas Sims. 

We have written twice to H. A. AVelch, Hartford, Ct., 
 about the People's Churn and Butter AVorker, but have 
 yet received no answer. 

Shang/»'^As have fallen a peg or two from their high 
 estate, and can now be had at from $2 to $3 per pair. 
 We will procure you a pair at that figure if desired. 
 Whether the great reduction in pi-ice, in this vicinity, is 
 partly owing to a daguerreotype of one, icithout his 
 feathers, which a friend of ours near Downingtown talked 
 of having taken, we cannot say. If so, we consider it 
 rather afoul business to spread the information of how 
 the carcass looked before the present stock in Chester 
 county is disposed of. We observe our friend Freas, of 
 the Germantown Telegraph, has proposed, under certain 
 contingencies, to eat all the chickens at the New York 
 Poultry Exhibition. Atleast so says the American Agri- 
 culturist. We hope (supposing the aforesaid Shanghai da- 
 guerreotype to be correct,) that the Major is fond of the 
 muscular portions of the fowl, and docs not care for the 
 white meat. One great merit, at least, in the breed is. 

that they are not fond of roaming, or scratching in the 
 garden. For this reason they would suit very well his 
 two acre lot, where the soil is finely pulverised, and ev- 
 ery foot of ground turned to good account. We doubt 
 whether there are any two acres in the country more 
 productive than Mr. Freas' two acres in Germantown. 
 When next in that ancient borough, we shall indulge our 
 curiosity by looking over his board fence, if he has no ob- 
 jections. A really well managed and productive farm, 
 whether large or small, is to us a great attraction.

Milk for Manufacturers. 
 We find the following in the London Medical Journal : 
 Milk now possesses other offices besides the production 
 of butter and cheese, and the flavoring of tea. It has 
 made its way into the textile factories, and has become a 
 valuable adjunct in the hands of the calico-printer, and 
 the woolen manufacturer. In the class of pigment- 
 printing work, which, indeed, is a species of painting, 
 the colors are laid on the face of the goods in an insolu- 
 ble condition, so as to present a full, bi-illifint face. As 
 a vehicle for effecting this process of decoration, the in- 
 soluble albumen obtained from eggs was always used un- 
 til Mr. Pattison, of Glasgow, found a more economical 
 substitute in milk. For this purpose buttermilk is now 
 bought up in large quantities from the farmers, and the 
 required insoluble matter is obtained from it at a price 
 far below that of the egg-albumen. This matter the pa- 
 tentee called "Icabrine." A second application of the 
 same article — milk — has just been developed, by causes 
 arising out of the recent high price of olive oil. The 
 woolen manufacturers are now using the high priced ar- 
 ticle mixed with milk. This mixture is said to answer 
 much better than oil alone, the animal fat contained in 
 the globules of the milk axparently furnishing an ele- 
 ment of more powerful efi"ect upon the woolen fibres than 
 the pure vegetable oil alone. 

National Poultry Show. 

We clip the following account of the National Poul- 
 try Show from the Plough, Loom and Anvil : — The 
 largest collection of the feathered tribe ever collected 
 in this or any other city in this country, has been on 
 exhibition at Barnum's Museum, during the past month. 
 The number on exhibition is said to be about 4000, and 
 embraces the common domestic fowl, geese, turkeys, 
 ducks, pigeons, praire-hens, pheasants, pea-hens, quails, 
 guinea-hens, eagles, swans, &c., each species and varie- 
 ty being represented by both males and females. Be- 
 sides these, are deer, terriei'-dogs, gazelles, rabbits, pigs, 
 &c. &c. They occupy all the room to be spared for 
 them in the three stories of those large halls. The 
 number of exhibitors exceeds a hundred. The most ex- 
 tensive of these are Mr. McCormick, of Long Island. (?) 
 and Mr. Piatt, of Rhinebeck, N. Y. The States of New 
 York, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and 
 New Jersey, are represented in the coops, by natives of 
 almost all the countries of the globe. 

We cannot enumerate the various birds by their names, 
 but were very glad to hear Mr. McCormick in his ic- 
 marks on the 17th, recommend that all the fowls from 
 Eastern Asia be called by one name, Shanghais, and the 
 varieties be known by their color only, as white Shang- 
 hais, speckled Shangliais, Sic, and to find that this plan
