THE FAKM JOURNAL. 

[April 

was adopted by a resolution of the Society here and at 
 Albany. We could never distinguish between several of 
 the "varieties" by their appearance, and perhaps it was 
 not from ignorance, but because they were all alike. 

The addresses, on the 17th, were by several gentle- 
 men, but we were disappointed in the amount of well- 
 ascertained facts that were presented. We call to mind 
 but two items of practical importance, and these were — 
 1st, that pullets seldom commence laying eggs till they 
 are six months old ; and 2d, that the best fowl for gen- 
 eral use is the cross of the Shanghai and Dorking. 
 These statements may be reliable, or they may not. 
 We should be sorry to eject the beautiful "black Span- 
 ish" from our yards, and still hope good reason may be 
 assigned for retaining them. The most beautiful birds, 
 of these varieties, in this exhibition, were the Mexican 
 game-cock, and the handsomest of the feathered race, 
 the "golden pheasant." Then came the "silver pheas- 
 ant," peacock, some varaieties of i:)igeons, &c. &c. 

The only pigs exhibited were a beautiful pair of Suf- 
 folks, ticketed $150. 

Farms Improved by Keeping Sheep. 

Citizens of Wool growing districts, as parts of Wash- 
 ington and Fayette counties, are familiar with the rapid 
 improvement of "Sheep farms," by sheep grazing alone. 
 It is the belief of many whose opinions have been form- 
 ed by observation and experience, that, by placing as 
 large a flock of sheep on a poor farm as the land will 
 sustain, and in five years, without any other means, it 
 will be comparatively rich. Were this fact more gener- 
 ally known, it might change the husbandry of consider- 
 able portions of this state, the lands of which are better 
 adapted to wool growing, than grain growing, to say 
 nothing of remoteness from produce markets. The fol- 
 lowing quotations from the Transactions of the Norfolk 
 Agricultural Society, which we find in the AVool Grower, 
 are worthy of consideration : 

"A man having a small farm, formerly kept forty 
 sheep, four cows and one horse, and had food enough for 
 them the year round. The price of wool falling, he sold 
 his sheep, and for a number of years has kept other 
 stock altogether. He now keeps but three cows and 
 one horse the year round, and pastures two cows extra 
 through the summer, sells very little hay — not half 
 enough to keep another cow ; he has the same amount 
 of pasture and mowing land as when he kept the forty 
 sheep in addition to his other stock, and yet his farm 
 does not look near as well as then. He used to raise 
 turnips among the corn for his sheep to eat in winter, 
 and gave them besides, a few bushels of grain. The 
 lambs, however, more than paid for his extra feed. 

"Another farmer for a great number of yeai's kept 
 aboiit sixty sheep, eight or nine cows, (or other stock 
 equal, ) one jjair of oxen and one horse. After keeping 
 the sheep for a mxmber of years, he found he could then 
 keep as large a stock on his farm with the sixty sheep, 
 as he could keep without them before ; showing that 
 'they had improved the farm to furnish their own sup- 
 port. To stock a farm entirely with sheep would not be 
 so profitable as to keep a limited number — yet it woiild 
 pay as well as other stock. The object is to keep enough 
 to consiime that part of the vegetation peculiarly fitted 
 to sheep ; and which other stock will not eat, adding at 

the same time enriching elements to the pastures and 
 yards by their manure. It is the opinion of many farm- 
 ers, that pastures for other stock may be improved by 
 keeping a small flock of sheep upon them a portion of 
 the time, and the opinion seems fairly supported both by 
 reason and experiment."

Domestic Becipes. 

PoTATOE Pie. — Boil until soft as many potatoes as you 
 like ; then peel and mash through a tin seive. To a quart 
 of potatoes add one quart of milk, three spoonsfuls of melted 
 butter, four beaten eggs, and sugar and nutmeg to the taste. 
 Bake in tins as you would custard or pumpkin. — Rural New 
 Yorker. 

Egg Dumplings. — Make a batter of a pint of milk, two 
 well beaten eggs, a tea?poonful of salt, and flour enough to 
 make a batter as thick as for pound cake ; have a clean 
 sauce pan of boiling water, let the water boil fast, drop in the 
 batter by the table spoonful ; four or five minutes will boil 
 them ; take them with a skimmer on to a dish, put a bit of 
 butter and pepper over, serve with meat. 

Baked Apples. — The person who has eaten baked sweet 
 apples with milk needs no commendation of the article. But 
 those who have tart apples only, may secure a delicious 
 dish by the following process : Pare them, if thick skinned, 
 cut out the the largest portion of the core from one end, 
 and place the fruit on well glazed earthen dishes or pans, 
 with the cored end upwards, and the cavity filled with refin- 
 ed powdered sugar. Then bake them. 

Nourishment of Meat. — To preserve, in dressing, the 
 full nourishment of meats, and their properties of digestive- 
 ness, fornft a most important point of the art of cooking ; 
 for these ends, the object to be kept in mind is, to retain as 
 much as possible, the juices of the meat, whether roast or 
 boiled. This, in case of boiling meat, is best done by pla- 
 cing it at once, in briskly boiling water. The albumen on 
 the surface, and to some depth is immediately coagulated, 
 and thus forms a kind of covering, which neithers allows 
 the water to get into the meat, nor the meat juice to get into 
 the water. The water should then be kept just under boil- 
 ing until the meat be thoroughly done, which will be when 
 every part has been heated to about 165 degrees, the temper- 
 ature at which the blood coagulates or fixes. At 132 degrees 
 the albumen sets, but the blood does not, therefore the meat 
 is rod and raw. The same rules apply to roasting; the meat 
 should first brought near enoughto a bright fire to brown the 
 out side, and then should be allowed to roast slowly. — ^.r. 

Feieb Oysters. — Select the largest oysters for frying. 
 Take them out of their liquor with a fork, and endeavor, in 
 doing so, to rince off" all the particles of shell which may 
 adhere to them. Dry them between two napkins; have ready 
 some grated cracker, seasoned with Cayenne pepper and salt. 
 Beat the yolks only of some eggs, and to each egg add half a 
 tablespoonful of thick cream. Dip the oysters one at a time 
 first in the egg, then in the cracker crumbs, and fry them 
 in plenty of butter, or butter and lard mixed, till they are 
 of a light brown on both sides. Serve them hot. — Ex. 

To Cook Parsnips. — Persons who have never eaten pars- 
 nips cooked according to the following mode, have no idea 
 what an excellent dish they are. Scrape the parsnip, wash 
 and slice them lengthwise ; boil them in just water enough 
 to cover them when done. Then put in a piece of butter, 
 salt and pepper. Boat an egg with a spoonful of flower and 
 pour over them — they are then ready to dish up. Parsnips 
 are likewise very good split once and roasted with pork in 
 the dripping pan. 

To Make Crackers. — One quart of flour with two ounces 
 of butter rubbed in; one tea-spoonful ofsalerutus in a wine
