THE FARM JOURNAL. 

[April 

foro, or to adopt the cash system without reserve. We chose 
 tlie hitter, and in order that all might bo made aware of the 
 proposed change, we sent the notice above alluded to. In 
 looking over our mail books, wo find the names of hundreds 
 who have not received the February and March numbers, 
 who, we are persuaded, desire to continue their subscrip- 
 tions, and are probably wondering why their accustomed 
 monthly visitor has been withheld. To these we would 
 gladly send the Journal, but our friends will perceive that 
 by so doing we would be giving just grounds of offence 
 to' many others. We cannot properly, to use a homely 
 phrase, make fish of one and flesh of another.

Corrected Lists. 

We have used every exertion during the last two months 
 to have pur lists perfectly correct, but we found several er- 
 rors and omissions when recently comparing our letters with 
 our new mail books. Should any errors still exist we shall be 
 thankful to jiostmasters and others to inform us of them. 
 When it is remembered that our entries have been made from 
 some four thousand letters, many of them almost illegible, 
 and the post office address often entirely so, the difficulty in 
 obtaining correct lists for a new volume may easily be ima- 
 gined. 

Asparagus Seed a Substitute for Coffee. 

We have observed the following recommendation of "a 
 gardener" — name not given — in several of our exchanges. 
 It may be like other substitutes, but we should be glad to 
 hoar of its trial by some of the fair readers of the Journal. 
 We have great faith in their skill and judgment. 

"Asparagus seeds," he remarks, "contain, according to 
 Liebeg, in common with tea and coffee, a principal which 
 he calls 'taurin,' and which he considers essential to the 
 health of all who do not take exercise; this led me to think 
 that asparagus might be made a good substitute for coffee. 
 The young shoots which I first prepared were not agreeable, 
 having an alkaline flavor. I thou tried the ripe seed ; these, 
 roasted and ground, make a full flavored coffee, not easily 
 distinguishable from fine Mocha. The seeds are easily freed 
 from the berries by drying them in a cool oven, and then 
 rubbing them on a sieve." 

Nitrate of Soda. 
 We see it stated in the transactions of the Royal Agricul- 
 tural Society of Bngland, that a Mr. Stevenson, of Edin- 
 burg, has made an experiment on his wheat crops of one 
 cwt. of nitrate of soda and two cwt. of salt per acre, which 
 resulted in an increase of nine bushels of wheat per acre. 

Missing Numbers. 
 We have received information of a number of packages 
 having miscarried during the last two months, and in every 
 case made known to us have forwarded others. As there 
 may be others of which we have not hoard, we will most 
 cheerfully forward duplicate copies upon application. 

Agricultural College. 

The Carlisle "Volunteer" says: — We notice among the bo- 
 t(ucsts of the late Elliott Cresson, Esq., one of five thousand 
 dollars to the fund for the establishment of an Agricultural 
 College by the Pennsylvania State Agricultural Society. 
 We are pleased to see capitalists and men of position turn 
 their attention to this subject. It is one of great impor- 
 tance to the community. Educated farmers, who are ac- 
 quainted with the theory as well as practice of germination 
 and maturing, are imperatively demanded, if we expect an 
 advancement in agriculture proportionate to that of the oth- 

er sciences. In the present state of the science its votaries 
 know, that if they sow the seed at a certain time a certain 
 result will be produced, but of the reason and the process 
 they are entirely ignorant, and any effort to advance the in- 
 terests of our farmers will meet with the hearty approbation 
 of all classes. 

A New Manure. 
 We are informed that Robert Bryson, Esq., of Cumber- 
 land county, about eight miles from Harrisburg, Pa., has 
 been experimenting for the last ten years, to make exhaust- 
 ed tan bark available and valuable as manure. Besides his 
 magnificent farm, he likewise carries on the tanning busi- 
 ness. Finally, after a great deal of expense, and failures, 
 he has succeeded in discovering a method of producing from 
 tan an efficient manure. This is his plan: He has his tan 
 wheeled out on a level pieces of ground, and leveled off two 
 or three feet thich. Over this he spreads a layer of two or 
 three inches of lime, and over that again a strata of tan — 
 then a layer of lime, and so on. He lets the bed so 
 prepared remain for two years ; at the end of that time he 
 finds abed of manure, the effects of which upon the land can 
 hardly be surpassed by the richness of its product, and the 
 durable fertility which it imparts. 

Spring Wheat. 

Reuben N. Woods vrrites to the Ohio Farmer as follows: — 
 A neighbor of mine, (Mr. 11, Baker,) formerly of this place, 
 but now residing in Rockford, Winnebago Co., 111., has just 
 left here for that country, and agrees to furnish all the Wheat 
 that is wished for Seed. lie says they have a beautiful kind 
 of Wheat, called the White Club which looks as white as 
 any of our white varieties of Winter Wheat, and often yields 
 forty-five bushels to the acre on those rich prairies. The 
 said Wheat is selling from ninety cents to one dollar per 
 bushel there, and the freight will bo fifty cents per 100 lbs. 
 to Cleveland, from whence it can be forwarded in sacks. 

"Mr. Baker is quite anxious that this kind of Wheatshould 
 be introduced into this State, as he believes there are many 
 locations on which it will do better than Winter Wheat. Mr. 
 Baker is an upright, responsible man, and I have no hesita- 
 tion in saying that any business entrusted to his care will be 
 promptly and satisfactorily attended to."
