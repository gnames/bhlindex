Guenon's System and James Gowen. 

Mr. Editor: — It seems equivocal that your corres- 
 pondent, •who styles himself "Science," should defer to 
 me, a plain farmer, while he keeps so closely to his eru- 
 dite character. Ilis familiarity with Loi'd Bacon, Doc- 
 tors Parr and Franklin, and the Grecian Philosophy, 
 with his reliance upon the philosophers of the i:>resent 
 daj', Isaac Newtown, of Chesuut street, Philadelphia, 
 Marshall P. V/ilder, of Boston, and "the distinguished 
 Professoi'" John Wilkinson, now of Gi'eat Barrington, 
 Massachusetts, make it sound strangelj^ that he should 
 yield to me in the accomplishment of writing or speak- 
 ing. But he is, in common parlance, I suppose, only 
 "poking fun at me ;" be this as it may, when I see such 
 an array of dead and breathing philosophers strung to a 
 cow's tail, I cannot but exclaim with Hamlet: "To what 
 base uses may we come at last !" That I should, as 
 "Science" saj-s, oppose my "ipse dixit" to the aforesaid 
 homogeneous galaxy is no doubt verj' presumptuous, but 
 he little knows how many competent judges of cattle now 
 living, I could name, who would be ready to sustain me 
 in the position that Guenon's system is "sheer nonsense," 
 besides referring to a proof that is more than negative in 
 this, that the best and greatest breeders, improvers and 
 delineators of fine stock should, while developing points 
 and defining standards, never have noticed or discovered 
 the escutcheons and mii-rors, so potent and wondrous in 
 reflecting the true properties of the cow ; such men as 
 Bakewell, Mcynard, Collings, Culley, Bates, Whitaker, 
 Vouatt, &c., &c., who, from the care, pains and skill be- 
 stowed by them upon this branch of husbandry, reduced 
 it to a science, and to whom we are indebted in the 
 largest sense for their intelligent labors and commenda- 
 ble examples. Had any such tests as are claimed for 
 the inin-ors existed, they could not, in the nature of 
 things, have possibly escaped the observations of these 
 keen, practical and discerning men, especially the pene- 
 trating and indefatigable Robert Bakewell. 

The mischief in adopting the mirrors and escutcheons 
 as standard tests would be immense, because there is 
 nothing definite or tangible in them ; they would set 
 breeding to points, blood and properties at defiance; this 
 man would lose the sale of a good animal, because some 
 Guenonlte might happen to conjure up for her what he 
 9 

might conceive he saiv in her escutcheon an imperfect mir- 
 ror ; the other man would lose the chance of having a 
 good cow from the same cause, and so on. No two dis- 
 giplcs of this school, if tried apart upon an animal per- 
 fectly unknown to them, will agree as to its mirror ; 
 when found at fault in pronouncing a perfect mirror to 
 a bad milker, then comes the tug at amending the deci- 
 sion by pointing to some hairs, indefinite and obscure to 
 every one but the conjurer himself, who will explain how 
 these hairs broke the line that misled him. The sj^stem 
 is so absurd and ridiculous, that it is really a misnomer 
 to call it a system. It is so vague and intangible as 
 gives rise to as many illusions, as hinted in my former 
 communication, as the imagination may create, affording 
 a range of opinion in determining the object, as wide, 
 as from that of "a weasle to a whale;" it is, there- 
 fore, as easy for "Science" or any of the enlightened, on 
 finding a cow that makes from 16 to 18 lbs. of butter in 
 a week, (facts that should be taken not only with many 
 grains of allowance but ounces and pounds) to apply to 
 such cows first class mirrors, and just as easy to desig- 
 nate others, which they know don't give 6 lbs., having 
 similar marks, as faulty in their mirrors. 

If what "Science" calls ''facts and undisputed history, 
 are, that learned Societies in France subjected Guenon's 
 system to the severest tests," he should have designated 
 those societies, and given the places where those savans 
 experimented ; even had he done this, still it would not 
 be conclusive. France is a broad field, and it must be 
 admitted that many a fantasy and vagarj' have been en- 
 acted there ; nor can any one doubt but she can boast of 
 philosophers and professors of every type and emblem. 
 We can ourselves reckon not a few self styled savans 
 and professors, who can do up a thing or two of as nmch 
 value to themselves and the community as the endorse- 
 ment of Guenon's theory, of which Nefilin's pamphlet is 
 a fact indisputable. 

I pass by the personalities of "Science," as to my 
 crops on paper, &c., with this remark that, if he be a 
 farmer, let him visit me and look at my cattle, and into 
 my management, and then judge for himself ; but I can- 
 not oveidook so easily his gratuitous remai'k of vulgarity 
 applied to the response I made to him. The truth is, 
 the only thing vulgar in it was the quotations I made 
 from his refined and orthodox pamphlet, describing the 
 seat of a first class, "lyre shaped mirror;" and consider- 
 ing the subject, ground work or text, no one, I think, 
 could have handled it more dextrously to avoid defile- 
 ment than I did. Let any prudent, disinterested indi- 
 vidual take up the pamphlet and pictures, and then 
 glance at my article, and say whether I did not treat the 
 matter with great caution and delicacy ? The whole 
 system in fact, in all its pai-ts and tendencies, is as vul- 
 gar as it is stupid and unmeaning. 

"Science" seems to console himself by answering my 
 question or remark, that it was incumbent on Guenon to 
 show that there existed some affinity between the curves 
 and lines of hairs ami the lactescent property of the cow, 
 by another question to me, as to the connection there is 
 in this respect with the muzzle, eye, neck, flank, <S:c., 
 and in asking this without answering mine, he exposes 
 the air blown foundation upon which Guenon's system 
 rests, as effectually as if he had answered, that these
