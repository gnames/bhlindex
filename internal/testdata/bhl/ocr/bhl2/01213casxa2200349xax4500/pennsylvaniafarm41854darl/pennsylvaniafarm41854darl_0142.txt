[April 

Tines of hair have no influence, or were not influenced 
 by the milking property of the cow. Now without pre- 
 suming to be versed in physiology, I shall give a cora- 
 nion sense answer to his question, which 1 have no doubt 
 will be satisfactory to every experienced breeder: that 
 there is tangible and physical affinity between those parts 
 or points to which a good judge can address himself with 
 entire confidence, in order to determine the character of 
 the animal. As thus, constitution and good health are 
 the basis of good milking, as well as of easy feeding, in 
 selecting for the latter we look for its evidence mainly in 
 the shoulder, chest and conformation of the ribs. I 
 need not say why. In choosing for milking, the muzzle 
 will as invariably indicate the health of the cow as to 
 feverish excitement and deranged secretions, as nearly 
 as the pulse can indicate these conditions ; this is not 
 all, the muzzle, with every part of a perfect cow, and 
 consequently a good milker, should in the extreme be 
 feminine; hence the muzzle, cheek, horn, throat, neck, 
 breast, crops, rump, buttock and tail, should differ as 
 widely from the bull or male as possible. A bull-headed, 
 throaty, &c., cow will always be a bad milker, not only 
 so, but she will be prone to breed bull calves. Now is 
 "Science" answered, and can he say that such bull- 
 necked, throaty cows will not be likely to have such es- 
 cutcheons as the most perfectly formed cows. No one 
 dai-e answer tliat, if an escutcheon was definite, or tangi- 
 ble to handle, feel or measure. I need not enlarge fur- 
 ther upon this point, for the most simple, if unpreju- 
 diced, will perceive the reason why those points or parts 
 are referred to as indicators of the qualities of cattle. 

I was about to close here, when I observed in another 
 part of the Journal, that Marshall P. AVilder, President 
 of the United States Agricultural Society, with Chaun- 
 cey P. Holcomb, Esq., of Delaware, have been formally 
 arrayed against me ; this, however, gives me as little 
 or less concern than that you have been authorised to 
 resolve "Science" into Mr. Eusebius Townsend, of West 
 Chester. I could call to my support very many reliable 
 names to sustain my position, but it would savor too 
 much of management, to my taste, to be drumming up an 
 array to give effect, or make an impression upon youi- 
 readers. I choose rather to go before them upon the 
 simple merits of the case. If my position be sound, it 
 cannot be affected by all the puffs and breezes that can 
 be directed against it. I feel a confidence that the unu- 
 sual efforts made to impair it, Vv'ill only give to my views 
 more force, and secure for them a m9re general accep- 
 tance. 

There is, however, a matter connected with this late 
 denouement that bv.comes me to advert to, and that is 
 the action of the "Philadelphia Society for Promoting 
 Agriculture," through a committee in this connection. 
 I stateri in a former communication my opposition to the 
 society having anything to do with the matter, and with 
 the desi re to absolve the society, in the main, from the 
 pei'ilous position the committee had placed it, I most 
 ingenuously stated the manner in which the committee 
 had been appointed, and the direction given to the re- 
 port published in the jiamphlet, from which nothing 
 could be inferred but an irregularity or precipitancy that 
 sometimes will happen in the best regulated associations; 
 this irregularity is manifest even as to the names on the 

report as published. The names of the committee on 
 the minutes are A. L. Elwyn, Samuel C. Ford, Isaac W. 
 Roberts, Samuel Cooper, Casper W. Sharpless, Samuel 
 Williams, Dr. James A. McCrea and Isaac Newtown, 
 eight in all; four only of these, not a majority, appear 
 to have acted; those who did not act, or who have not 
 signed the report, are Isaac W. Roberts, Samuel Cooper, 
 Casper W. Sharpless and Dr. James A. McCrea. There 
 are six names appended to the report, two of them, aa 
 may be seen by the names composing the committee pro- 
 per as above, are informal, one of whom is .John Wilkin- 
 son. So much for the action of the Philadelphia Agri- 
 cultural Society, so much relied upon by "Science," — Mr. 
 Eusebius Townsend. I reiterate, that I objected to any 
 committee, refused to appoint a committee on such a 
 business, and stated that any or all of the members 
 might go on their own account if they pleased ; and that 
 I never saw the report or heard it read, until I saw it 
 published in the pamphlet, for had it been read before 
 me it could not have passed. With this I take my leave, 
 making mj best bow to the distinguished gentleman en- 
 gaged on the side of the tail — In tail vs. head, neck, &c., 
 &c. Respectfully,

 JERSEY HOGS. 

Mr. Editor : — As a strong prejudice exists in the 
 minds of many persons against the State of New Jersey, 
 I thought it might alter the opinion of some such per- 
 sons by stating to them, through your Journal, the kind 
 of hogs we raise in Gloucester county. One of my 
 neighbors. Mi-. John W. Ilazelton, killed a lot of hogs 
 two weeks ago, twenty-one in number, and weighing as 
 follows: 550, 545, COO, 476, 526, 512, 540, 495, 430, 
 584, 494, 531, 485, 472, 577, 571, 489, 429, 455, 563, 
 581 pounds, average weight 518 lbs. These hogs were 
 but twenty-one months old. Let those try who can beat 
 this. But until they do they may do well to cease sneer- 
 ing at New Jersey. PHILLIP A. MASON.

 FARMING IN DELAWARE. 

Mr. Editor : — Upon a perusal of the February number of 
 your valuable Journal, I observed a statement of the crop 
 of wheat raised the pastyear upon two fields of my 'Mansion' 
 or "Font Hill Farm," and you desired to bear from mo tho 
 process by which the said fields were brought up to their 
 present state of productiveness. 

In answering this as well as many other inquiries addres- 
 sed to me upon the subject, I propose doing so through your 
 Journal, which I hope will bo satisfactory to all. The sub. 
 ject of Agriculture is one upon which I delight to converse, 
 and tho pursuit enlists my greatest plea.suro; but when cal- 
 led upon for my experience and practice to be placed upon pa- 
 per I fear it may be wanting of interest. 

In order fully to give 3'ou my course of improvement it 
 becomes necessary for me to enter into a more elabor- 
 ate statement than I should desire, and I fear it will be con- 
 sidered a more expensive one tlian will be sanctioned by 
 your many Agricultural readers. 

Tho two fields referred to and upon which you desired my 
 process of improvement I will first confine myself to. 

During tho spring of 1847, one yearprevious to my getting 
 possession of tho farm, these fields were plowed for Oats, and
