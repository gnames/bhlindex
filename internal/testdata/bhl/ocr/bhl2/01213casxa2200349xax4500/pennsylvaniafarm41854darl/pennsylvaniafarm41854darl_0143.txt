an application of 50 bushels of slacked lime per acre, was 
 made, and Clovorseed sown upon the Oats, only a small por- 
 tion of the Clover seed took root, consequently the fields 
 were sparingly set in grass, when the farm camo into my 
 possession ; early in March, 1848, I applied 50 bushels more 
 of my slacked lime per acre upon the grass leaving it lay 
 until the following August, at which time I commenced plow- 
 ing for wheat, finishing about the first of September. I then 
 applied upon these fields all the barn-yard manure I was 
 able to make from March 1st, until August 1st, (which as 
 you may suppose, was a small quantity, verj'wtak and poor- 
 ly raked,) covering the balance of the fields with Peruvian & 
 I'atagonian Guano. The following spring seeded 1^^ gallons 
 of clover seed per acre. This crop of wheat yielded about 
 15 bushels per acre. After cutting and housing the wheat, 
 from these fields I applied 50 bushels more of slacked lime 
 [ler acre upon the sod, and let it remain until the spring of 
 1851, at which time I plowed the sod to the,depth of 7 inches 
 and applied 100 bushels more of slacked lime, prepared the 
 land and tilled it in corn. The yield averaging about 60 
 bushels per acre. 

I then let these fields remain over until the fall of 1852 
 (giving mo what we call a corn-stalk fallow) I commenced 
 plowing for wheat about the first of August and had to en- 
 counter a growth of weeds, averaging about 4 feet, these 
 weeds were all green and in good condition to plow under, 
 I attached ox chains to my plows (Beach PatentNo.lO) and 
 succeeded in getting them all under handsomely; haying ap- 
 plied Gypsum at the rate of two bushels per acre, early in 
 the morning whilst the dew was upon the weeds, taking care 
 not to spread over more ground than could be plowed during 
 the day; after plowing I had spread at the rate of 80 bushels 
 of wood ashes per acre, immediately after spreading the ashes 
 had the fields rolled, 10 days after I had the ground harrow- 
 ed each way, harrowing the way it was plowed first. In the 
 course of 10 days more I applied 150 lbs. of Peruvian Guano 
 per acre, mixing it with the earth by running cultivators over 
 it. I then fallow harrowed it cross wise of the cultivating, 
 then rolled again, and commenced drilling my wheat in on 
 tho 22d day of September and finished on the 26th, and seed- 
 ing at tho rate of 2 bushels per acre of Euteriau white wheat, 
 the yield of which was agreeable to your statement. 

"Font Hill Farm" (or the farm upon which I now reside) 
 I purchased in the month of November, A. D., 1847, contain- 
 ing about 200 acres of land, all arable. The farm was in the 
 most delapidated condition and exceedingly barren, but on 
 account of its desirable soil and location, being immediately 
 contiguous to the thriving town of Smyrna, I was induced 
 to purchase it at a cost of nine thousand dollars. The whole 
 tract including buildings having been rented for years pre- 
 vious for the sum of eight}' dollars per annum. I obtained 
 possession of it the first day of March, A. D. 1848, and the 
 first object I desired was to inclose and divide it into fields 
 with the best Chesnut and white Oak fence, which I accom- 
 ]ilished by the following winter at the expense of $1500 and 
 in the course of the same year spread 25000 bushels of the I 
 best Schuylkill and North River Lime upon it covering every | 
 aero at the rate of over 100 bushels. About thirty acres of I 
 which I also covered with labratory refuse at the rate of 100 ' 
 bushels per iicre, besides spreading .SOOO bushels of good Bos- i 
 ton wood ashes and using teutons of Peruvian Guano. From , 
 these applications I derived great benefit, all of my crops 
 showing a considerable increase. ! 

My crop of corn, was planted upon an old sedge field and 
 the most remote from the buildings, containing 90 acres. 
 This field had been cultivated but twice for twenty years 
 previous, the greatest yield from either tillage as I was 
 credibly informed being but 5 bushels of corn per acre. 

The course I pursued was to spread 50 bushels of slaked lime 
 per acre on the sedge before plowing and 50 bushels of do. 
 together with 50 bushels of good wood ashes per acre imme- 
 diately after plowing, and beforerolling and harrowing. Af- 
 ter having the land marked out for planting, I had dropped, 
 a small portion of Peruvian Guano in the hill, covering it first 
 with earth, then had tho corn dropped and covered by hoes. 
 After the corn came up and we had finished replanting it, 
 I had the earth leveled down by passing fallow harrow up 
 and down the rows : my tillage then was entirely with cul 
 tivators, with the exception of hoeing it once. Notwithstand- 
 ing the great outlay at first I considered I was well remun- 
 erated, having gathered and housed that fall ?>oOO bushels of 
 corn or an average of about 37 bushels per acre, leaving the 
 land in an improved condition equal the whole cost of tho 
 applications or outlay. During the autumn of 18481 conclud- 
 ed to move upon the farm and immediately employed work- 
 men and had tho dwelling and kitchen thorough.lj- repared 
 and painted, and commenced occupying it on the first day of 
 March, A. D, 1849. After having got settled down upon it 
 and taking a general view of the condition of the land, ad- 
 ded to my experience of the past year, I found it necessary 
 to pursue for two or three years a hard course of tillage, be- 
 sides employ much extra labor iu order to eradicate the per- 
 nicious weeds and distructive insects with which the land 
 did abound. Pursuing this hard course of tillage I made 
 liberal applications of Lime, Guano, Labratorj' refuse, wood 
 ashes, barn yard and stable manures, and bj' reference find 
 up to this time I have used sixty thousand bushels of lime, 
 twenty thousand bushels of wood ashes, fifty tons of guano, 
 besides a variety of other concentrated fertilizers, and cover- 
 ing all the land over twice or thrice with stable and barn- 
 j'ard manures, and plowing under green crops of buck- wheat 
 oats and clover. 

This course of tillage prevented ray being able to get into 
 a regular system of cultivation as soon as would be generally 
 desired. 

The past two years I have allotted about 50 acres for 
 standing pasture or grazing land, 50 do. for mowing' about 
 50 do. for corn, 40 do. for wheat, 5 do. for jjotatoes and 5 do. 
 for orchard and truck patch. My crops now are about 80 tons 
 of hay, 12 to 1500 bushels of wheat, 3000 bushels of corn, 
 600 to 800 Potatoes, a variety of fruit and vegetables, besides 
 fattening from 40 to 50 western bullocks. The property cul- 
 tivated must improve and increase in crops without further 
 outlay for years to come. 

I was obliged to add building to building as the increase 
 of my crops demanded it which now comprise every building 
 requisite, viz: stable for 8 horses, 36 by 23 feet, cow-sheds 
 12 by 17 feet, with calf house, stalls mangers and chains for 
 12 cows. Granary and Corn-cribs; Barn and Corn-cribs 
 in which can be housed 3000 bushelsof Corn and 1500 bush- 
 els of Wheat, Hay house and Wheat house each 50 bj- 23 ft. 
 Beef house for stall feeding 60 bj' 17 feet, 12 feet overshoot, 
 stalls for ten bullocks, with gates, halters &c., and food room 
 at one end, ox-shed with stalls and gates, for 6 head, at the 
 end of which is stabling for Brood mares and Colts, waggr.n 
 and cart sheds. Carriage houses tool house (to. 

The Barn Yard is conveniently divided into four yard.=, in 
 order to separate the diS'erent cattle and horses, and each 
 yard well supjilied with water, and is imloscd by builil- 
 ings and board fences, with shedding around and through 
 it to shelter tho stock, under which are good oak 
 manger.s, besides square mangers and good racks about 
 and over it. 

The Dwelling House is a two storj' brick, with a large and 
 commodious Kitchen attached, both of which have under- 
 gone a thorough repair and painting, situated conveniently 
 is a good smoko house, ice house, wood and ))oultrj' house. 
 In order to make the situation a desirable place of residence, 
 my cfl'orts have been directed to transplanting fruit and or- 
 namental trees, evergreens, shrubbery. Three acres are now 
 occupied with apple and peach trees of the most choice fruit
