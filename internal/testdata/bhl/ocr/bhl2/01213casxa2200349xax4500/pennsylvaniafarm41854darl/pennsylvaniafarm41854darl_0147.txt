eerning the experiments in progress, yet the result will nev- 
 ertheless be hefore them for their judgment." Should Mr. 
 Meehan, in this large collection, be so fortunate as to find, 
 (and if his theory be true ho undoubtly will,) three plants 
 possessing tho several distinctive sexual characteristics of 
 the three he exhibited on the former occasion, we trust they 
 will not be "tlirown aw.ay," but be experimented with, by 
 him, in the manner already suggested, or else placed in the 
 hands of some cither reliable person, for this purpo.'e. In his 
 communication to one of the Committee, Mr. Meohan also 
 states explicitly, that the plant sent to us is not one of the 
 three exhibited before the Society, but was from a plant that 
 had borne hermaprodito flowers. It appears, then, that it, at 
 any rate, has not changed its sexual character, the blossoms 
 having been hermaphrodite before, and are herma}d»rodite 
 now notwitlistandiug its present feebleness. 

It is probably within the recollection of many of the 
 members of the Society, that views somewhat analogous to 
 those of Mr. Meeh.".u were, at one time, maintained by the 
 late Mr. Downing. He contended thatthe natural condition 
 of Ilovcy's Seedling was staminate ; but l\v permitting the 
 old plants to bear for several successive j-ears, their luxur- 
 iance was impaired, and their sexual character altered — in 
 other words — they became pistillate. And to prove the cor- 
 rectness of his position, he announced his intention of send- 
 ing the Massachusetts Ilorticulturiil Society several of his 
 plants in pots. After that announcement, as nothing more 
 is found in the Horticulturist on the subject, it is probable 
 that he abandoned the doctrine. Bo this, however as it may, 
 we have been credibly iufw'nied that he did send tho plants 
 to Boston, andtliat the Fruit Committee of the Massachusetts 
 Horticultural Society decided that thej' were not Hovey's 
 Seedling. 

In Concluding our Ad Interim Report, we take great 
 pleasure in stating, that several of our Rail Road Companies 
 have given practical and substantial evidence of their inter- 
 est in the cause of Horticulture, by extending to us im- 
 portant facilities in the prosecution of our pomological inves- 
 tigations. The facilities to which we allude <are free tickets, 
 kindly presented to one of the Committee, to be used by him 
 ,as often as required, during the entire year 1854. For these 
 privileges wo are especially indebted to John Tucker, Presi- 
 denl of the Philadelphia, Reading and PottsvilleR. R. Com- 
 pany : to J. Edgar Thompson, President of the Pennsylva- 
 nia R, R. Company ; to Joseph Yeager, President of the 
 Harrisburg an<l Lancaster R. R. Company: to S. M. Felton, 
 President of the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore 
 R. R. Company, and to Wm. H. Gatzmer of the Camden and 
 Amboy R. R. Company. Such liberality on the part of the 
 Presidents and Managers of tho Companies, in aiding Horti- 
 cultural explorations and researches, and diminishing the 
 taxes levied from individuals in their disinterested labors to 
 promote a great national interest, merits our cordial thanks 
 and public acknowledgements. 

FLAX GROWING. 

CiRcrLAK. — Having made extensive arrangements, within 
 the past two years, for the spinning and weaving of Flax, 
 and tho manufacture of Linen Goods, which will enable us to 
 consume annually a much larger amount of the raw material 
 than is at jiresent prepared or sent to market in this coun- 
 try, we have been obliged to import from Europe several 
 hundred tons of the Flax fiber to supplj' our immediate con- 
 sumption. This necessity has existed, not from the fact of 
 the growth of Flax being uuadapted to our soil or climate, 
 but because the attention of our farmers has not for many 
 years been drawn to the subject by any demand for the pre- 
 pared fiber. Recent investigations have .'^hown that more 
 than two hundred thousand acres have been occupied the 
 past year in our Western States with the Flax crop, it being 
 grown entirely for tho seed; in many places the stock and 
 its fiber being wasted and thnjwnawaj'. In Ohio alone over 
 eighty th(jusaud acres have been under Fla.x cultivation for 
 the supplj' of tho Linseed Oil Mills in Cincinnati, Dayton 
 and other parts of the State. 

But while the seed is a valuable and important portion of 
 the Flax crop, the fiber is deemed in Europe even inoro so; 
 and in msiny places the latter only is cared for, from a false 
 impression, that the two objects are incompatable with each 
 other. The reports and exertions of tho Irish Flax Society 
 however, and the experience of many parts of Europe, and 
 of all modern science have shown that fo far from the fiber 
 being injured by a sufiBcient maturity of tho Flax plant to 

I fit the seed for the market the reverse is the case, and with 
 proper management both can be advantageously preserved. 

We are therefore desirous of calling the urgent attention 
 I of the growers of Flax and of tho farmers generally in tho 
 ] West, to this long neglected branch of industry; and are 
 prepared to offer direct inducements to them, so to modify 
 their method of cultivation, as to accomplish the end in view. 
 In a letter from Mr. Thomas Kimber, Jr., of Philadelphia,, 
 (who has spent some time in investigating the subject of Flax 
 culture.) to Gov. J. A. Wright, of Indiana, says: 

"The secret lies in ihe proper pvcparotiuu of (/rouiidhc[<iro 
 sowing the seed. If the farmer would give tho land a fall 
 jilowing, and leaving it over tho winter to mellow then plow 
 it deeply again in the spring, reducing it as fine as jiossible 
 withiiut two much labor, he woidd on good ground, average 
 20 bushels of seed to the acre. Tlie Flax plant is peculiarly 
 sonsativo to such attention, and amply repays them; the roots 
 striking downward almost as deep and straight, where the 
 ground is open and "mellow, as the slock shoots ujiward. It 
 is not too much to saj' that taking into consideration Il:e in- 
 creased seed as well as the fiber, every dollar so s]ient in 
 plowing and pulverizing the ground would yield ton-fold in 
 the harvest gathered. 

"The land best suited for flax is an open, rich loam, wiih 
 a clay sub-soil if possible. In the next place for the filjer: If 
 the farmer would sow 2 bushels or 2i to tho acre, on rich 
 grounds so prep.'ired, he would while obtaining 20 bushels of 
 seed, also obtain 2 tons to 2^ tons of flax straw per acre. At 
 present, with the poor preparation and thin cowing not over 
 one or one and a quarter tons are c>btaintd on an average. 
 Every ton of straw yields 300 pounds of flax fiber, so that 
 he would then obtain if be chose to rot and prepare it as was 
 done in the days of our grandfathers about GOO or 650 lb.«, 
 per acre of flax fiber rotted and scutched. This would give, 
 by the slight addition of fall plowing, enriching if the land 
 needs it, and after sowing a light brush harrowing or rolling 
 a great increase of profit to the farmer." 

Wo propose, in order to give the grower an idea of our 
 wants to deposit with well known parties in each State, ad- 
 equate samples of the flax fibre grown in our own and oth- 
 er countries, and imported by us within tho past few months, 
 and to afiix to each sample the cash price we paid for those 
 qualities, when laid down in New York, adding the charges for 
 commissions, freight, duties, exchanges expenses .ic. We wiU 
 then bind ourselves to pay for twelve months from this date tho 
 same price in cash, for all the flax fibre of equal qualities to 
 the samples so deposited, which m.ay be prepared and forward- 
 ed to New York by western parties, or to pay such prices, less 
 the freight and other charges to New York, on all Flax so 
 delivered to our agents in Louisville, Cincinnati or in 
 Chicago. 

By this means the American farmer will secure to himself 
 not only the profits which have been found sufficient to re- 
 munerate the European cultivator, but the many charges to 
 which such articles are subject in the transit; and also may, 
 with proper management obtain a larger amount of Flax 
 Seed per acre than he now realizes. And we fully believe 
 that, after having been induced bj- the above extraordina- 
 ry oficr, to try tho experiment fairly for one year, he will 
 find flax to be the most profitable crop he can turn his at- 
 tention to. 

We propose taking the Flax at some rate, unless it should 
 fall too far below the lowest sample furnished, to be of any 
 advantage for us to manufacture. We wisli all the Flax 
 either pulled or cut with a cradle so carefnily as to pre- 
 serve the stalk uninjured at the ends, and iho seed taken 
 off by a rippling comb, or by passing the heads of stjilks 
 through rollers, so as to avoid the present destructive ef- 
 fects of threshing : the Flax to bo water-rotted and scutch- 
 ed : to be sent in bales or package.', so as to be ready for 
 heckling on reachin.g our mill
