THE FARM JOURNAL. 

[ArniL 

cussion for to-day until this moment, I am, of course, un- 
 preparo'.l to offer anything except such remarks as most na- 
 turally arise in the minds of all present. Before entering 
 upon the subject proper, permit me to offer some general 
 remarks embracing the principles necessary to bo under- 
 stood in the preservation of fruits, for the purpose of making 
 a platform on which to found our modes of action. Apple 
 and other fruits containing a largo amount of water, in 
 which is held in solution the different proximates, and these 
 undergo a variety of changes, some of which are favorable 
 to the preservation of the fruit, and some incidentally to 
 their decay. Those changes, therefore, which produce do- 
 cay should be avoided. 

The Professor then gave all the facts relative to the ace- 
 tous fermentation, the methods of avoiding it in the drying 
 of fruits, ifcc. lie referred to the necessity of adopting such 
 processes as should not abstract the aroma from fruits. He 
 stated that if the fruits be buried in the soil, the alumina and 
 carbon of the soil would abstract the aroma, and render the 
 fruits nearly valueless. 

Indeed, plaster of Paris, cotton, cotton cloth, and many 
 other substances, have that power to a very great degree. 
 Thus Isabella grapes preserved in cotton, will be protected 
 from the deleterious effect of the moisture given off by the 
 grapes, but they will lose their aroma so completely as to 
 become valueless. He also spoke of the oxidation of the 
 «ugar in fruits, and of the different properties of cane and 
 grape sugar; the propensity of the one to attract moisture 
 and thus to render the solution more dilute. He spoke of 
 the exposure of a broken apple to the atmosphere, turning 
 it to a brown color, in consequence of the sugar of the ap- 
 ple combining with the oxygen in the air, and changing it 
 to that state known as trecle, or molasses. Thus an ap- 
 ple ground to a pommace, exposing its surfaces to the at- 
 mosphere, would change color, and the expressed juice 
 would be colored, and have that peculiar flavor which we 
 know as belonging to cider — but, that if a whole apple be 
 suddenly pressed, the juice would be white, have the true 
 flavor of the apple, and quite unlike that of cider. That 
 a Tozzle Joint Press might bo made with a hopper admit- 
 ting one apple at a time under a Plunger, through which 
 the juice may bo expressed, and that cider from juice so 
 procured would be of superior quality; for, although the 
 intestinal commotion of the fluid mass by fermentation, 
 will cause its particles to come in contact with the atmos- 
 phere, they would be different ; with a small amount of 
 carbonic acid on the surfaces, preventing immediate con- 
 tact of the atmosphere to a full extent, and thus tho cider 
 would bo lighter colored and finer flavored. 

He spoke of the superior qualities of fruits dried rapid- 
 I3', compared with those prepared by slower processes, by 
 which a larger amount of their aroma is retained; the ace- 
 tous fermentation is prevented, and the fruit not so much 
 darkened by the operation as when more slowly dried. 

Hi* described the apparatus now in use by the Ameri- 
 can Phalanx, of Monmouth county, New Jersey, by which 
 they are enabled to dry Okra while it is in the unripe state 
 (that is, proper for working) ; also, green corn, Lima beans, 
 young green peas, peaches, apples, ifec., &c.; and that the 
 vegetables and fraits so dried, readily swell to their origi- 
 nal size in cooking, and have their true flavor — a very 
 superior result over tho ordinary methods. This is done 
 by placing the young fruits and vegetables in drawers with 
 bottoms of wire, or any thing which will let air pass freely; 
 these drawers are placed in a wooden chimney, at the bot- 
 tom of which a blower, revolving with great rapidity, 
 causes a strong stream of pure air to pass through these 
 drawers — a moderate heat being supplied to the blowers — 
 the vegetables and fruits are rapidly and perfectly deprived 
 of all their water, and come out in fmo condition. He 
 spoke of the valuable uses of the vacuum pans, invented 
 by Howard, in which the juices of spirits could be evapo- 
 rated to a solid extract, at a low temperature, without the 
 admission of atmospheric air, and without material loss in 
 color, or aroma, &o. He also detailed the various processes 
 established in France and elsewhere, for preserving fruits, 
 Ac, by placing them in bottles, in hot water, heating thom 
 sufficiently to drive off the excess of atmospheric air, and 
 then instantly closing the bottles to prevent air from re- 
 turning to the fruit. He mentioned the late Mr. Downing's 
 American figs, made of rich peaches — heretofore spoken of. 
 That Mr. Browne, of the Patent Office at Washington City, 
 exhibited to him last week American prunes made of plums, 
 in the State of Maine, superior in quality to auy imported 

from abroad. 

The Professor gave, at full length, the whole scientific ra- 
 tionale of the process of preserving fruits and vegetables, 
 He adverted to the successful methods adopted by Mr. Pell, 
 of Pelham, to export to Europe, in perfect, sound condition, 
 very large amounts of his best apples. It would be difficult 
 for us to render justice to the very valuable remarks of Pro- 
 fessor Mapes on this occasion. Ho spoke nearly an hour to a 
 most attentive audience. 

Curiosities of the Patent Office— Agricultural Imple- 
 ments. 

During the last year, 141 patents were granted for ag- 
 ricultural implements, twenty-seven of which were for 
 harvesters, power reapers, mowers, &c. The following ab- 
 stract of this interesting department of invention, as exhib- 
 ited in the Patent report is given in the Scientific Ameri- 
 can : 

Three patents were granted for horse power potatoe dig- 
 ing machines ; the models of two of these we have seen, but 
 have not yet had the pleasure of seeing a largo one in oper- 
 ation. Fifteen patents were granted for improvements in 
 ploughs, and four for cultivators. No loss than twenty-six 
 were granted for seed planters. This number is very large 
 considering that such machines are of no recent origin; it 
 shows the importance of this class of mechanics, and the 
 dissatisfaction entertained with those already in use. Tho 
 devices patented, however, were mostly confined to the mode 
 of distributing the seed — the novelties patented are said to 
 be small, but that of B. D. Sanders, of Holiday's Cove, Va., 
 for operating the shove rod to work the valves by friction 
 rollers and rotary cam. is a very good one. Three patents 
 were granted for horse rakes, and threshers and separators; 
 one of the latter consisted in having an inclined rotary cyl- 
 indrical straw carrier supported on friction rollers. This 
 cylinder is full of holes, and as the straw is carried, the grain 
 falls down through tho openings. Ten patents were gran- 
 ted for hullers and smut machines — one of them being for 
 washing and scrubbing, and dr3'ing the grain. One patent 
 was granted for a weigher combined with a winnower. The 
 weighing apparatus is secured in such a manner to tho ma- 
 chine that when the measure is filled up to the proper 
 weight, the balance tips the weighed grain, which is thrown 
 upon inclined ways, and immediately starts off on a rail- 
 road track to the grain depot. Four patents were granted 
 for corn shellers; in one the ears are allowed to accumulate, 
 to act in the mass as an elastic bed against the spiral shel- 
 ling projections. Three patents were granted for straw cut- 
 ters, and nine for miseollaneous agricultural implements, 
 one of them being for a metallic tube scythe snath. 

Vegetable Monsters. 

Oregon seems to rival oven California in the productive- 
 ness of its soil, and the mammoth size to which vegetables 
 attain. Mention is made by the papers of a huge cauli- 
 flower, raised opposite Portland, weighing forty-five pounds 
 and the world is challenged to beat it. Mr. Justin Chen- 
 owcth writes fromthe Dalles that he is growing in his gar- 
 den a cabbage, which he has carefully measured, and found 
 it to cover a space embraced in a circumference of nearlj' 
 fourteen feet, being four feet and six inches in diameter 
 The solid head is twelve inches in diameter. lie thinks 
 that the whole would weigh over fifty pounds. The seed 
 which produced this plant was not sown until the 21st of 
 May, and the head will probably attain to sixteen inches in 
 diameter. In the same garden hehasgi-own turnips, many 
 of which weighed ten pounds ; and watermellons and toma- 
 toes, rivaling both in size :ind flavor, the Lest that he has 
 seen in the Mississipjii Valley — all being of the first crop, 
 without either ploughing or spading, the planting and tend- 
 ing having been done exclusively with a light Yankee weed- 
 ing hoe, and a garden rake.

A Profitable Farm. 

The farm of Bryan Jackson, near Wilmington, Delaware, 
 consists of 220 acres. On this farm he employs three hands 
 all the year, at $1.'?2 per annum, each; two men extra for 
 six months, at $12 per month, and day hands, whose wages 
 amount to about $50 a year ; making in all, for labor, a cost 
 of $590 a 3'ear, Mr. Jackson, in tho American Farmer, 
 says : "The sales of the farm the past year will not vary 
 much from fiftv-three hundred dollars."
