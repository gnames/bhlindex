JiheuniHtisin is neither so common, nor are its symptoms 
 so well marked in horses as in cattle. When, however, it 
 does occur in the horse, it manifests the same well known 
 appearances which characterise it in all other animals. It 
 aifects the fibrous tissues of joints, the coverings of muscles, 
 tendons, and ligaments, and the valves about the heart and 
 larger vessels, and manifests a peculiar tendency to shift 
 from one part of the body to another, often affecting in suc- 
 cession all the larger joints, at one time chiefly located in the 
 neck, and at another in the back and loins, while in many of 
 its more acute attacks it appears to involve almost every por- 
 tion of fibrous and fibro-serous tissue throughout the body. 
 In all its varieil types it exhibits a full, strong, hard, and 
 unyielding pulse, caused by the inflammation involving the 
 serous and fibro-serous tissues of the heart and circulating 
 vessels. During its existence various excrementitious mat- 
 ters accumulate in the blood, and its fibrinous constituents 
 aj-o found to exceed their normal proportions, as indicated 
 by the production of the buffy coat on the blood. In severe 
 or badly treated cases the inflammation is very apt to be 
 transferred from the joints and muscles to the heart and its 
 investing membrane, and it is the danger of this change in 
 the seat of the disease that renders rheumatism so formida- 
 ble, and often so fatal. It always leaves the parts affected 
 so altered as to be extremely predisposed to subsequent at- 
 tacks ; and it is more than probable that this altered condi- 
 tion is reproduced in the progeny of rheumatic subjects, 
 and constitutes in them the inherent tendency to the dis- 
 ease. 

Horses sometimes suffer from rheumatic inflammation in 
 the fil)rous sheating envelopes of the muscles of the neck, 
 constituting what is popularly known as the chords. When 
 thus affected the animal is very stiff, remains as much as 
 possible in one position, and is unwilling to bend his neck 
 cither to one side or another, or to elevate or depress his 
 head. There is always more or less fever, with a strong 
 full pulse. Sometimes, as in lumbago in the human sub- 
 ject, it affects tho muscles of the back and loins, causing 
 stiffness, tenderness, and pain, which are especially evinced 
 on moving or turning the animal. These rheumatic affec- 
 tions are very readily produced in predisposed subjects by 
 exposure to rain and cold, especially when accompanied by 
 over-heating or exhaustion. Rheumatism sometimes occurs 
 in horses as a prominent symptom of that epizootic affection 
 which usually receives the much-abused title of influenza. 
 In such cases the rheumatism is of a somewhat more sub- 
 acute or chronic character than common, and is accompanied 
 by that low debilitating fever so often the concomitant of 
 epizootic maladies. It usually affects all parts of the body 
 susceptible of the rheumatic inflammation, is attended par- 
 ticularly by those symptoms which indicate disease of the 
 heart and pericardium, as an irregular intermittent pulse, 
 and often terminates fatally by effusions into the pleurae or 
 pericardium, thus causing death by arresting the motions of 
 the heart. As we shall have again to notice rheumatic dis- 
 eases when .speaking of cattle, we leave tho subject for the 
 present, and proceed to the scrofulous or strumous inflamma- 
 tion. 

The scrof along diathesis, or constitution, is not uncommon 
 among horses. It assumes many degrees of intensity, and 
 predisposes to many diseases. It is most apt to discover it- 
 self in horses with narrow chests, large flat sides, weak loins, 
 soft flabby muscular systems, soft thin skins, fine silky hair, 
 large badly proportioned limbs, and large weak joints, and 
 in those in which digestion is often impaired, excretion ir- 
 regular, and circulation weak and easily accelerated. In an 
 animal affectod by scrofula the blood is in an abnormal con- 
 dition. There is an alteration in the relative quantity and 
 quality of its various constituents, consisting chiefly in a 
 diminution of the red corpuscules, and an excess of fibrine, 
 which is besides in a less elaborated state than usual; tuber- 
 cular deposits are also found in various parts of the body. 
 This alteration in the healthy quantity and ciuality of the 
 albuminous ingredients of the blood, and in the integrity of 
 the various tissues, is transmitted from the parent to the off- 
 spring ; and, in proportion to the amount of deviation from 
 the normal state, constitutes a scrofulous diathesis more or 
 less decided. The diathesis is strikingly hereditary, often 
 affecting many individuals of the same family, often tracea- 
 ble through many generations, and sometimes ascribable to 
 the sire, sometimes to the dam. It is always, however, 
 greatly aggravated (and may be developed dc novo) by cir- 
 cumBtances pr^udicial to health â€” by insufllcient food, by ex- 

posure to damp and to low temperatures, and, in a marked 
 degree, by "breeding in-and-in." By this system of breed- 
 ing, any inherent tendency to disease, however slight, is 
 greatly aggravated, and always in a rapidly' accelerating ra- 
 tio in each succeeding generation so long as the faulty sys- 
 tem is continued. 

The scrofulous diathesis affects various parts of tho body, 
 and assumes different forms in different animals, and at dif- 
 ferent ages in the same animal. It develops itself as rickets, 
 hydrocephalus, tabes mesenterica, and pulmonary consump- 
 tion, and in these, and all its other forms, is alike heredi- 
 tary. 

jackets, like the other diseases indicative of a scrofulous 
 habit, depends on malnutrition. The bones are defective in 
 earthy constituents, and consequently give way under the 
 weight which they ought to sustain, becoming bent and de- 
 formed. Amongst our patients, however, rickets is neither 
 so common nor so serious as in the human subject, and the 
 young animals affected by this complaint generally gain 
 strength and vigor if they get a sufficient nutritive diet, and 
 are otherwise carefully tended. 

Hydrocej)h(du8, or water in the head, in one of its forms, 
 is a tuberculous inflammation of the internal serous mem- 
 branes of the brain. It is ushered in by languor, disordered 
 digestion, irregularity of the bowels, and a falling off in con- 
 dition. The limbs become weak and tottering ; the head is 
 hot and tender, and held in a dependent position ; the eyes 
 are impatient of light, and the pupils partially closed; there 
 is more or less fever and an accelerated pulse. These symp- 
 toms, indicative of active inflammation, give way, after a 
 variable time, to others significant of effusion and pressure 
 on the brain. All the external perceptions become blunted, 
 and tho pulse is slow. As the fluid accumulates, the head 
 enlarges, and the bones become soft and thin. This state of 
 depression usually continues till death. This disease is one 
 of early life ; it is rarely met with in animals of more than 
 six months or a year old. As has been already remarked, it 
 is sometimes congenital, and, in such cases, there is usually 
 a great increase in the size of the head, from the amount of 
 the effusion and the soft, yielding nature of the cranial 
 bones. Tho substance of the brain is found, on examina- 
 tion, to be expanded by the contained fluid, and soft and 
 infiltrated with a thin serosity. The membranes of the brain 
 are much inflamed, coated with lymph, and studded with 
 granules and tubercules, which are also found in other parts 
 of the body, especially In the mesenteric glands, and are in 
 all respects identical with those found in ths lungs of con- 
 sumptive patients. These facts establish the scrofulous na- 
 ture of the disease, and its close connexion with consump- 
 tion. 

Tabes Mesenterica is more common in foals than is gener- 
 ally supposed : it occurs at various ages, but seldom affects 
 animals more than two years old. The matter of tubercle is 
 deposited in the mesenteric glands ; and this, interfering 
 with their functions and preventing the due elaboration of 
 the chyle, speedily causes derangement of digestion, imper- 
 fect assimilation, and consequent rapid wasting and death 
 from inanition. Apparent recoveries occasionally take place, 
 the tubercular matter becoming cheesy, hard, and gritty ; 
 but as the lungs also are usually diseased, recovery is often 
 only temporary, and the animal by and by dies either of 
 phthisis pulmonalis, or of glanders. 

We have noticed that variety of consumption affecting the 
 limbs, or rickets ; that variety affecting the contents of the 
 cranial cavity, or hydrocephalus; that variety affecting the 
 abdominal cavity, or tabes mesenterica ; and have now to 
 notice that variety, perhaps, of all the most common and fa- 
 tal, and which has its seat in the lungs ; this is pulmonary 
 consumption, m phthisis j>ulmonalis. It consists in a depo- 
 sition of tubercular matter in the lungs ; at first soft and 
 eheesy, or gluey and fibrinous, and becoming, after a time, 
 hard and gritty, but always unorganisable. Its symptoms 
 are irritation of the mucous lining of the bronchia and 
 lungs, as evinced by cough ; occasional febrile symptoms, 
 wasting, and debility, which, in bad cases, sets in early, and 
 is so excessive as speedily to destroy life. We have treated 
 very briefly of tabes mesenterica and of consumption in 
 horses, because we shall have to return to them when speak- 
 ing of the hereditary diseases of cattle, in which they are 
 more common than in the horse. 

These are the most common forms in which a scrofulous 
 diathesis shows itself, but there are other irregular forms 
 which it also sometimes assumes. In early life especially, 
 we recognise it in intracttiblo swellings of the joints, from
