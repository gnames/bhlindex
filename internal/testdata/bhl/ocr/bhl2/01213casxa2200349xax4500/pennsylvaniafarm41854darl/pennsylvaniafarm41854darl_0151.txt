unhealthy inflammation of their synovial fringes, and in ac- 
 cumulations of pus in various parts of the body. These two 
 forms are often met with in different individuals of the same 
 stock, and are always notoriously hereditary. I know at 
 present of two entire horses, both of fine symmetry and ap- 
 parently sound and vigorous health and constitution, that 
 have for several seasons got stock, many of which have died 
 within a short time after birth from these complaints, and 
 others have long continued sick and ailing. A pony, in 
 sound health, and which had previously reared a strong and 
 vigorous foal, got by another sire, had a foal to one of these 
 horses. From birth it was weak on its legs, and died before 
 it was three weeks old: an immense accumulation of pus 
 was found underneath the psoae muscles, and all the larger 
 joints wore inflamed especially the stifle joints. In the suc- 
 ceeding year the same pony had another foal to the same 
 horse, which again showed similar symptoms, and died about 
 the same time after birth. Again, in the next year the pony 
 was put to another horse, and had a foal which remained 
 perfectly free from disease. This case, we think, distinctly 
 proves the transmission by the sire of a scrofulous diathesis. 
 The disease of the foals could not depend upon accidental 
 circumstances, for a similar afi'ection occurred in many of the 
 stock got for several seasons by the same horse. The dis- 
 ease was in this instance ascribable to the sire, and not to 
 the dam, — which is obvious from the fact, that the same 
 mare produced and roared a healthy foal both before and 
 after she had the two diseased ones. This last observation 
 must not, however, be misconstrued, as leading to the belief 
 that diseases are inherited from the male alone ; on the con- 
 trary, form, disposition, and tendency to disease, all depend 
 quite as often on the mother as on the sire. 

But a scrofulous diathesis, besides appearing in the forms 
 above noticed, also constitutes a powerful predisposition to 
 many diseases. In scrofulous subjects sore shins often occur 
 — a common complaint in many racing studs, appearing 
 chiefly in young and rapidly-growing animals, depending on 
 the excessive exertions to which they are subject in train- 
 ing, consisting of inflammation of the periosteum investing 
 the cannon bones, especially of the hind limbs, and, when 
 neglected, often running on to caries and necrosis. 

From their weak and unsound constitution, horses of a 
 scrofulous diathesis are unusually prone to glanders a,nd farcy 
 — two forms of a disease peculiar (at least as an original 
 disease) to the equine species. As has been already remark- 
 ed, it is characterised by a specific unhealthy inflammation, 
 identical in all important characters with the syphilitic in- 
 flammation in man. From the dire and loathsome nature of 
 glanders, and the terror in which it is held, animals affected 
 by it are never used for breeding, so that we have little op- 
 portunity of judging of its hereditary nature. There is no 
 evidence (so far as I know) which proves it to be directly 
 hereditary, but there is no doubt that the progeny of a glan- 
 derous horse would exhibit an unusually strong tendency to 
 the disease. Its ordinary predisposing causes are, many of 
 them, hereditarj' : it is very prone to attack animals of a 
 weak or vitiated constitution. It is emphatically the disease 
 which cuts off all horses which have had their vital energies 
 reduced below the healthy standard, either by inherent or 
 acquired causes. Glanders is also sometimes caused by in- 
 oculation; is frequently produced in healthy subjects by mis- 
 management, as by insufficient food, want of shelter, and 
 overwork; and often supervenes on bad attacks of influenza, 
 strangles, diabetes, and other diseases which debilitate the 
 system, or impair the integrity of any of its more important 
 parts. These causes appear to possess the power of engen- 
 dering in the constitution of the horse a peculiar poison, 
 which, as it reproduces itself, and spreads to all parts of the 
 body, gives rise to the characteristic symptoms of glanders, 
 causing, sooner or later, a breaking up of the sj'stem, and a 
 fatal prostration of the vital powers. This poison produces 
 in the blood abnormal changes, which vitiate that fluid, and 
 unfit it for healthy nutrition. From the irritant action of 
 the morbid fluids passing through them, the lymphatic glands 
 and vessels become inflamed, and lymph is deposited. This, 
 however, being of an unhealthy nature, soon runs on to soft- 
 ening, which extends to the skin overlying the part, and ul- 
 cerating farcy-buds are formed. On the surface of the more 
 vascular mucous membranes effusions of tubercular matter 
 are also poured out; these take on an unhealthy inflamma- 
 tion, and degenerate into chancrous ulcers, which may gen- 
 erally be seen on the mucous membrane of the nostrils in 
 most bad cases of glanders. 

These are the most common scrofulous diseases of horses ; 

but an animal of the scrofulous diathesis, besides being 
 specially subject to these, is little able to withstand ordinary 
 morbific causes, and hence is also unusually liable to many 
 ordinary diseases; in such a subject, too, disease is very apt 
 to be severe and complicated, and to be acted on tardily and 
 imperfectly by all remedies. 

A New Theory of the Fotatoe Disease and its Remedy. 

The following article from the London Farmers' Mag- 
 azine possesses very great interest, and would seem to 
 have solved the very difiBcult question of the origin of 
 the potatoe disease, and at the same time demonstrated 
 the principal operation in the destruction of all kinds of 
 engrafted fruits after a certain lapse of time. But with 
 all its plausibility, there are certain facts which seem to 
 militate against the conclusions deduced by Mr. Fergu- 
 son, one or two of which we shall mention. In the first 
 place the potatoe disease, where it has been very preva- 
 lent, has shown little, if any, diflfcrence as to the kind of 
 seed used, all crops having been attacked by it, even those 
 from new seedlings. Sometimes the potatoes in one spot 
 would suffer, whilst others from similar seed would, for 
 some reasons connected with the locality, exposure, or 
 stage of growth, escape the disease. This would leave 
 us to infer that the malign influence existed in the at- 
 mosphere, rather than in the condition of the potatoe, 
 induced by its age reckoned from the perfection of ita 
 germ. Notwithstanding these objections we regard the 
 article as extremely suggestive and of the highest inte- 
 rest. G. E. 

Philadelphia, Feb. 4, 1854. 

"The potatoe plant is only an annual, empowered by God 
 with two modes of reproduction. The one, like the oak 
 tree, lives only for years; the other, like the acorn, liveth 
 forever. Both reproductions are deposits from the plant, 
 different in chemical properties ; "live and die" independent 
 of each other, with the plant providing for, but independent 
 of both. 

"Here (exhibiting a potatoe stalk) is the plant. This 
 stalk, with its small fibres, is the annnal. These eight ap- 
 ples upon the top possess each from three hundred to three 
 hundred and twenty seeds ; each seed has the germ of a 
 plant with seed lobes, which perform the same office to the 
 germ that the yolk of an egg does to the germ of a bird, 
 supplying it with nutriment until all its parts are perfected 
 by germination to supply itself. 

"Hence the seed of the potatoe apple is, like the acorn of 
 the oak, the seed in the apple of the tree, or the egg of a 
 hen. These eight potatoes at the bottom of the stalk possess 
 each a quantity of eyes; each eye possesses the same prop- 
 erty /oj- a time that the seed or egg of a hen does; but the 
 patatoe, like the tree and hen, becomes aged and past bear- 
 ing; the oak lives after it ceases to bear, as do also the apple 
 tree and the hen, and so does also the potatoe. But the oak, 
 the apple tree, and the hen die from age, and why not also 
 the potatoe? Has nature made it an exception? 

"Besides, like the oak, the apple tree, and hen, the potatoo 
 has a graduating scale of ascending and descending life. 
 Here ^exhibiting a potatoe stalk) is a plant grown direct 
 from the seed. Observe the potatoes ore small, like marbles. 
 This stalk blossomed, but had not strength enough to form 
 an apple. Here (exhibiting a large stalk) is another which 
 is one year older. Observe the difference in the bulk of the 
 tubers which are produced. They may be compared to a 
 small egg increasing. This stalk also blossomed, and pota- 
 toes thus grown from seed continue to blossom up to five 
 years, and then first begin to form apples. Here (exhibiting 
 a stalk) is a plant six years old which bore an apple; conse- 
 quently, I call the parent of this apple a potatoe; the plants 
 before it not being able to perform the functions of a pota- 
 toe, I call germs, Nos. 1, 2, 3, and so on, ascending accord- 
 ing to their age. 

"Now, to get at the descending germ, let us take this 
 lumper (now exhibited). I can trace the history of this kind 
 of potatoe back to the year 1818; and I am told that, from
