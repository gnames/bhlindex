1825 to 1835, it was so charged with vitality that it would 
 grow without manure in any soil, of large size, and produ- 
 cing one hundred and sixty barrels to the acre, but of a 
 quality more fit for cattle than for man. Then was the time 
 to take seeds from its apples, and have the young rising into 
 strength for cattle, and the old losing strength, but becoming 
 more dry and floury, for man's use. 

"This lumper, once the prince of potatoes, like its great pro- 
 genitors, the barbers, kerkippins, white Turks, red Turks, 
 slipper potatoe, peeler potatoe of Connaught, black-bull of 
 Kerry, and a host of others, each in their turn ruled su- 
 preme. They are now gone, llere is the lumper, the cup, 
 English red, and Irish apple; look at them. The red, 12 
 years ago, produced 160 barrels to the acre; at present, in 
 the best land, it produces only 60 barrels ; lumpers 40 bar- 
 rels, and cups 30 barrels ; and, like the ascending germs, 
 they now blossom, but cannot grow apples ; consequently all 
 these kinds of potatoes enumerated may be called 'descend- 
 ing germs.' See this diagram, showing the life of the lump- 
 er. (Two ingenious diagrams, which, of course, we have no 
 means of representing, were here exhibited and explained 
 by the Rev. Mr. Porter.) 

"The first diagram shows the potatoe existing for thirty- 
 four years in three states of being ; first as an ascending 
 germ in blossom for five years; a potatoe, with apples, for 
 nineteen years ; and there not being any apples seen upon 
 the stalks for the last ten years, they then become descend- 
 ing germs, unable now to give any produce on mountain 
 land where they formerlj- grew. The law laid down in this 
 diagram rules every potatoe, and the same law guides its 
 seed : thus we find the plant to grow apples for nineteen 
 years. 

"The second diagram shows the plant ascending in vitali- 
 ty for ten years, its longest day, and green from five to seven 
 months, in proportion to its age; then descending, losing its 
 vitality, from its tenth to its nineteenth year, at which pe- 
 riod it remains green only five months, and produces no 
 seed. Thus the seed supplied by the parent plant at its 
 longest period mu.st of necessity be best and strongest. The 
 descending germ of the tenth year will remain green only 
 three months, and with little produce. Hence, seed from 
 the plant at ten years is perfect; the other only in propor- 
 tion to its place in the diagram ; consequently, I fear it is 
 hardly possible to procure good seed now, and I question if 
 ever perfect seed has been sown, except by fortunate acci- 
 dent ; the belief hitherto entertained being, that the seed 
 was only to give variety of kinds. 

The plant at transplanting is as perfect in all its parts as 
 the oak, the apple tree, or the female bird from the egg. 
 The root performs the same functions to the plant that the 
 stomach does to the animal — absorbs juices from the earth 
 and transmits them through one set of vessels to the leaves, 
 which are a continuation and extension of the same vessels 
 and matter. These extend their surface for absorption and 
 transmission of air and moisture, assimilate the juices, and 
 return them through another set of vessels to nourish and 
 enlarge the various parts of the plant. Thus, the leaves per- 
 form the same functions as the lungs of the animal, besides 
 giving shade to the vegetable. These truths point out the 
 true mode of cultivating ascending and descending germs, 
 and also the potatoe. The plant from a perfect potatoe lives 
 seven months, perfecting its fruit before it dies. The plant 
 from a descending germ lives only from five to three months, 
 unable at either stage to perfect its fruit. Therefore, when 
 the plant dies, the fruit not being ripe, continues to absorb 
 the decomposing matter in the leaves and vessels until these 
 vessels cease. Consequentlj', when we see the leaves getting 
 spotted and black, and emitting an ofl^ensive smell from de- 
 composing matter, wo should at once dig the crop to save 
 what potatoes exist, and turn the land to some useful pur- 
 pose. This is what we, in our wisdom, call the 'incompre- 
 hensible potatoe disease,' produced, you will observe, by 
 our own neglect of the immutable laws of God and na- 
 ture. 

The largest potatoe, being first from the plant, and conse- 
 quently longer in the world than the small one, is best for 
 .seed. This (producing a tuber) is a potatoe with twelve 
 eyes, consequently containing twelve plants. If I set it 
 whole, I put twelve plants to live upon the land of one ; in 
 other words, I put twelve cows to live upon one cow's grass. 
 Therefore, scoop out the eyes of the large potatoes for seed, 
 and use the rest. Let seed potatoes be the largest, and left 
 in the light until they become green. They are thus best 
 for seed, but not so good for the table, the oxygen having 

escaped. To keep potatoes for use, turf char is best; it will 
 keep them perfect, though not a month old. 

"To give an idea how to manage potatoe seed for sale or 
 use : Hans up the apples in the barn or other out-house, in 
 the light, until they become white, soft and pulpy, like a ripe 
 gooseberry; then press out the seed into water, and throw 
 away the hull ; wash the glutinous matter from the seed by 
 change of water, and dry it in the sun; or take a pulpy ap- 
 ple and press out the seed between the folds of blotting pa- 
 per; the paper absorbs all the glutinous matter, and you 
 will find from 300 to 320 seeds (a sufficient quantity for one 
 farmer). Another mode : Cover the apples in sand, which 
 will absorb the hull and glutinous matter; and in spring 
 sow sand and seed together in a hot-bed, which is simply 
 twelve inches of stable manure covered with two inches of 
 earth. I transplanted 800 plants from a box four feet long 
 by one foot wide, when the plants were from four to six 
 inches above the earth, to drill eighteen inches apart, and 
 sixteen inches between each plant. March or April is the 
 best time for transplanting, and drills should bo adopted in 
 every instance in preference to lazy beds, because the latter 
 retain rain and grow weeds, which prevent the circulation of 
 air, and cannot be easily got at. ^The juices of the potatoe 
 sleep during the winter and awake in the spring ; therefore, 
 do not plant before February. The experiments stated in 
 this paper can be tried and tested equally by the learned 
 sage or unlettered peasant, for one shilling. 

"This paper demonstrates, from the leaf being the lung of 
 the plant, that the potatoe cannot possibly grow after the 
 leaf dies, except we suppose it to grow upon decomposing 
 matter; and the diagrams demonstrate that there never was 
 any disease in the plant or potatoe. Why and whence are 
 these various antidotes against the "mysterious, incompre- 
 hensible potatoe disease," leading the peasantry of these 
 realms to lose their land, manure and labor, year after year? 
 A Frenchman tells us to insert a pea in each to absorb the 
 superabundant moisture — the cause of blight. An English- 
 man bids us plant in tan ; a Scotchman tells us to plant in 
 peat char, because, having ninety-six per cent, of carbon, it 
 is, like the pea and tan, a certain cure. The Royal Agricul- 
 tural Society of Ireland has a gentleman that professes to 
 take the sting or disease out of the potatoe by some mechan- 
 ical charm; and there is another gentleman who undertakes 
 to extract the sting from the earth ! but neither of them tell 
 how. 

These, like other varieties of mysterious cures and causes 
 whispered from man to man, stagger the senses, and make 
 reason reel. Therefore, in order that the truth of my views, 
 and the virtues of these charmers may be fully tested, I have 
 lodged £500 in the Provincial Bank, which I now freely offer 
 to them and the world, if they bring to this society, within 
 three years, the following potatoes, which have been the 
 principal support of the peasantry of this country for the last 
 thirty-four years — namely, the old Irish apple, the cup, the 
 English red, and the lumper — in the same strength that I 
 show this stalk, with apples upon the top, potatoes at bot- 
 tom, and remaining green from 12th April to 12th Octo- 
 ber. 

"The potatoes now exhibited (and which are open to in- 
 spection until seed time) show ten distinct varieties, ranging 
 from one to six years old ; these h.ave never been in the 
 world before, and their existence demonstrates that the pow- 
 er to grow them existed previous to, and since the blight of 
 1846.

Orchard Manuring. 

Messrs. Editors: — In an earlj^ number of the "Country 
 Gentleman," a subscriber inquires for the best method of 
 manuring an orchard, situated upon a portion of land so ele- 
 vated as to render the cartage of barnyard manure too ex- 
 pensive to be profitable. Having seen no suggestions that 
 correspond exactly with our notions of expediency in such 
 cases, we are induced to submit the following. The plan is, 
 perhaps, equally advisable in situations of easy access to the 
 common method of manuring. 

We believe every plot of land contains within itself the 
 elements of fertility. The richest soils in our country have 
 become so by the decay of vegetable matter, originating 
 from the very soils its decomposition enriches. If land in a 
 state of nature grows rich by retaining the products of its 
 own fertility, then nature can be imitated, and every farm, 
 not absolutely sterile, made of any desirable degree of rich- 
 ness by plowing in green crops. 

When green manuring is practiced, clover is the crop gen-
