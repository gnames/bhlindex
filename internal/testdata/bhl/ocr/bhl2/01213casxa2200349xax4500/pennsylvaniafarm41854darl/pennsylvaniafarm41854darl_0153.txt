erally preferred; but where constant cultivation is desirable, 
 as in orchard, rye possesses some advantages. 

A luxuriant growth of rye, harrowed down and plowed in, 
 when just commencing to head, furnishes a large amount of 
 valuable manure : and when sown early, say late in July, 
 the growing crop furnishes a clean, green surface, very desi- 
 rable for the harvesting of later fruits, and aiTords a larger 
 supply of late fall feed, such animals as will not materially 
 injure the fruit trees. 

It is difficult to say what point of fertility or productive- 
 ness may not be reached by a repetition of this process. 

It may be objected that this method is expensive, — the 
 same labor being required to produce the crop for manure as 
 for harvesting. 

But in reply, it may be said, that cultivation icitJiout croj)- 
 ping is absolutely essential to large profits in fruit raising, 
 and the above plan of manuring incurs no labor or expense 
 aside from that necessary to good tillage, save the small out- 
 lay for seed, which canuot exceed eight or ten shillings per 
 acre ; an expense much less than that of any other method 
 of equally efficient manuring. 

In seasons of non productiveness, or rather of failure of 
 fruit crops, the rye crop may be allowed to stand and ma- 
 ture, and the product of every season may be one of profit.

Improved Superphosphate of Lime. 

This article is manuftxctured in New York by Frederick 
 McCready, 351 Broadway. Many hundred pounds of this 
 compound have been sold the past year to farmers and oth- 
 ers. Prof. Mapes, Editor of the Working Farmer, invented 
 the article some five or six years ago, and has used it exclu- 
 sively on his farm with very favorable results. 

Meeting with a farmer about a year ago, who had been an 
 eye witness to its fertilizing power on Prof. Mapes' farm, I 
 was induced to try it myself. With your request, Mr. Edi- 
 tor and others, I give you the results. It may be proper to 
 say, that I had two objects in view: first, to test its value as 
 a manure, and second, its relative value compared with gu- 
 ano, the price of both articles being the same. On 480 feet 
 of ground, of uniform character, (that had been in Libby 
 beans the year before — of a black mellow loam,) I planted 
 320 hills of potatoes with 320 potatoes of equal size, that is, 
 one potatoe in a hill, uncut, 160 of those hills being manured 
 with one table spoonful of powdered guano, the other 160 
 with the same amount of improved superphosphate of lime. 
 They received no attention through the season, except to 
 keep the weeds down, and the surface level. The potatoes 
 were dug in August, (being an early kind.) The 160 hills 
 that received the Im. Sup. of Lime produced 1 J bushels over 
 the guanoed half, the potatoes being of a more uniform size. 
 For beets or turnips I can see no difiference between the two 
 applications. On gooseberries, which I have heretofore cul- 
 tivated to little purpose, the fruit all, or nearly all, falling 
 oflF when about half or two-thirds grown, I applied about a 
 gill of the lime to each bush, working it into the soil, the re- 
 sult was I had a most luxuriant growth of gooseberries, and 
 they staid on until picked for the market. Here also I see 
 no difference between tbe lime and guano as I dressed a part 
 of the gooseberries with guano. 

On peas, its efi'ect was very perceptible, as compared with 
 guano or a stable compost. On my carrots, the experiment 
 partly failed. That part of my carrot field which received 
 the lime being so dry, but a small part of the seed vegetiited, 
 those that came up did remarkably well, many of thorn girt- 
 ing 18 or 20 inches. 

But its most marked efi'ect was upon cabbages, the ground 
 was plowed twice, harrowed and furrowed out as for corn, 
 the plants set in the common way, with half a gill applied 
 at the next harrowing, making a gill to each cabbage. 

On grass, I applied it without any visible effect — sowed it 
 on in May, broadcast, at the rate of about 220 pounds per 
 acre, and I got (what the paddy told his son ho would got if 
 he fell into the water) a deal of a ducking, for it was in the 
 midst of a rain storm, so that its failure cannot be attributed 
 to a want of moisture. 

I think, Mr. Editor, you was at my place last season; and 
 had pointed out to you the different crops then growing un- 
 der tlie influence of the improved superphosphate of lime, 
 and also guano. 

Many scientific and practical men have come to the con- 
 clusion that for most crops that mature their seeds, guano is 
 too soluble, too quick, and limited, to carry the plant suc- 

cessfully through the latter part of the season. On the con- 
 trary, phosphate of lime (bone dust) is much less volatile, 
 the two principal elements of bone earth being phosphoric 
 acid and lime, two substances absolutely important to planu 
 in tbe forming of their seeds. They, however, possess no 
 direct power of forming the vegetable structure of the plant, 
 and this guano possesses it in a very high degree. Hence 
 by combining guano with bone dust, the volatile salts of the 
 guano are changed into the sulphates, consequently they 
 will last or remain in the soil until taken up by the plants. 

All the volatile salts being changed, the seeds are not in- 
 jured by coming in immediate contact, as is the case with 
 guano. The sulphates, being moderately soluble, are able 
 to impart the needed nourishment to the plant. — B. Shat-

Sawdust for Orchards. 

A year last fall I hauled a load of old rotten sawdust and 
 threw it around my young apple trees. My neighbor over 
 the way is one of those characters who plod on in the same 
 old track that his father and grandfather did, believing that 
 they knew all, and more too. My neighbor said if I put 
 sawdust around my trees I would surely kill them. Ho said 
 he put manure arfiund some of his trees, and killed them. I 
 told him I would risk it "any how." 

I put fresh stable manure around one row and sawdust 
 around the next; around another row I put leached ash- 
 es; and the remainder of the orchard I manured with 
 well rotted barn3'ard manure, and in the spring spread it 
 and well planted tho ground with corn and potatoes. The 
 result was many trees grew very luxuriantly, but the trees 
 where the sawdust was grew the best, the bark being smooth- 
 er and the tree^ had a healthier appearance. I will also 
 state that part of the orchard planted to potatoes grew 
 greatly better than that part planted in corn. The sod was 
 clay loam. — Ex.

How to Mend a Chain Pump. 

Chain pumps are very much in use at present. They are 
 very good pumps, especially in wells that are not protected 
 much from the frost, as they seldom get frozen so as to pre- 
 vent their operating unless the water in the well itself freezes. 
 Sometimes, however, the chain breaks or parts, and ttien it 
 has been thought necessary to take up the whole pumj) in 
 order to mend and replace it. A friend told us, the other 
 day, a method which he has adopted in such cases with per- 
 fect success. The chain with its plugs, you know, is an end- 
 less one, going over a pullo}' at the top, down outside the 
 pump into the water in the well ; then over a pulley under 
 the water at the lower end of the pump tube, thence up tho 
 tube. Now if the chain parts, it is difficult getting one end 
 over the lower pulley and up to other side, unless you take 
 up the pump to do it» 

Take a strong string of sufficient length to reach from the 
 bottom of the lower pulley to the surface of the water in the 
 well; tie a cork to one end of it and tie the other end to the 
 chain. Then winding the string round the cork put it into 
 the tube, and let the chain follow it down. As soon as it 
 gets down under the puUej', the cork will rise to the top of 
 the water in the well, from which it may bo hooked up. The 
 chain will be hauled up with the string, and the two ends 
 may then be fastened together in the usual waj'. — Maine

Soils for Apples. 

1st. On what kind of soil will the Swaar anple succeed 
 best? 

2d. On what do the Esopus Spitzenbnrg? 

3d. On what do the Roxbury Russet? 

4th. Is the Melon apple equal to any of tho above varie- 
 ties for the desert or domestic use, is it productive — is the 
 fruit fair or imperfect ? 

My reason for making the above inquiries is, the soil of 
 my orchard varies from a dry gravelly' soil to a strong clay 
 loam, and I wish to jilnnt in each kind the variety most suit- 
 able for it. Respectfully yours, N. S. Rok. 

A very extensive observation is needed to pronounce upon 
 the right kind of soil required for cerUiin varieties of tbe 
 apple, tlioro ;ire so man}- causes to influence suecei^s, that it 
 is difficult to arrive at a general rtile applicable everywliere. 
 Within our own limited experience, however, we have found 
 the Swaar to do much the best on strong rich, rather heavy 
 soil, and the Roxbury Russet rather best on those of lighter 
 character. Not much difference has been observed relative
