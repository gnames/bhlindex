"Tlie mixed-blood mothers had been formed from 
 breeds in general small, and possessing the usual quali- 
 ties of small breeds, delicacy of shape, smallness of the 
 head and the bony structure, temperance as to food. 
 The Merinoes alone had not these valuable qualities, but 
 tliey entered in the proportion of 25 per cent, only into 
 the mothers, and consequently of 12^ per cent, only into 
 the offspring. Their disadvantage, too, in these re- 
 spects was compensated by their influence on the 
 fleece. 

"I may here remark that, in founding a breed, it is far 
 better to choose ewes from small breeds, Avith the qualities 
 already mentioned, than from breeds that are stronglj^ 
 timbered, bony, coarse, greedy, like those of northern 
 and western France, which I tried myself, to my own 
 heavy loss. Accordingly as fine or coarse ewes are used, 
 so in proportion do the offspring show that coarse or fine 
 character, difiicult to describe for a writer, but easy to 
 perceive for a connoisseur." 

The Charmoise breed of sheep have taken prizes 
 whenever they have been shown at Versailles or Poissy. 
 Ph. Pusey, who translated the essay fi-om the French, 
 concludes by saying that, as a farther confirmation of 
 the truth of these views, he was informed by the late 
 Lord Spencer that he had observed that the worse bred 
 the female is, the more likely is the offspring to resemble 
 a well bred sire, and that he should practically prefer a 
 cow of no bi'eed to an indifferent pure bred cow for a 
 good thorough bred bull. The principle, however, has 
 never been so thoroughly carried out as in the above ex- 
 periments at La Charmoise, which throws some light on 
 one of the most mysterious of all physiological problems, 
 the renewal of the features of parents in the reproduc- 
 tion of animals. 

WORK FOR THE MONTH. 
 Farm. — One of the most profitable crops of the season 
 — Indian corn — now requires the special attention of the 
 farmer. The ground should be made in good order. If 
 it has been plowed deeply, and the sod well turned un- 
 der, a thorough harrowing and pulverization of the soil 
 is the next requisite. Farmers should remember that if 
 the ground is not put in good order before planting, it is 
 rarely made so after. The time of planting depends 
 most upon the season. We have known corn planted 
 during the last week in April in some seasons to do well, 
 while in others the yqvj early planted received a back- 
 set from subsequent cold, which placed it behind that 
 planted two and even three weeks later. Corn is often 
 severely affected by the drouth in the latter part of sum- 
 mer, but both the early and late planted are alike sub- 
 ject to this, one escaping the one season and suffering 
 the next. Some farmers distinguished for their success 
 in raising corn, have adoj)ted the old Indian rule of 
 planting when the dog wood blooms. This usually oc- 
 curs between the 1st and l.'Sth of last month. Unless 
 the ground is unusually rich, some special manure ap- 
 plied to the hill is of great surface to the young plant in 
 hastening its early growth. Spent ashes, plaster, mild 
 compost, &c., richly repay the cost of their application. 
 While the corn is young, grass often gets root in the hills 
 that is afterwards difficult to extirpate. The corn field 
 should be kept "clean" and mellow for the start. The 

principal crop of potatoes may be planted this month. 
 By planting at three or four periods, of a week or ten 
 days apart, the farmer is almost certain of a portion of 
 his crop "hitting" the season, as one or the other usual- 
 ly escapes the drouth which so often impairs the crop. 
 Where pasture is not likely to be abundant, ground 
 should be prepared to sow corn for fodder. This crop 
 cut in its green state is greatly relished by cattle, and is 
 an invaluable substitute for scant pasture. Avoid turn- 
 ing stock too soon to pasture fields. Sow one bushel of 
 plaster to the acre on all grass fields. Inspect fences all 
 around the farm, and make them secure against the 
 stock. Clean out and whitewash cellars, remove pota- 
 toes to barn floor, or other dry place, to retard their 
 sprouting. Cover manure in barnyard from action of 
 sun and rains, or compost it with alternate layers of soil 
 if not already done. Watch the stock on rank pasture, 
 every morning, to guard against hoven, Avhich may be 
 quicklj' relieved by hay rope, drawn tightly in the mouth 
 and extending back of the horns. The motion of the 
 jaws, thus produced, liberates the gas in the stomach. 

Feuit Orchard. — Finish planting fruit trees, straw- 
 berries, raspberries, grape vines, &c., as soon as possi- 
 ble. Wash the bark of newly planted trees with a mix- 
 ture of soft soap and weak lye — equal parts — to prevent 
 their becoming bark bound. Trees in blossom against 
 walls or trellises, should be protected against late frosts 
 by covei'ing with sheets, or shading with evergreen boughs 
 to keep off the sun's rays. Destroy Avebs and larvse of 
 insects. Mulch the ground under gooseben-ies with 
 coarse hay or litter, and sprinkle salt. Mulch raspber- 
 ries and strawberries with spent tan bark. Shorten in 
 raspberry canes one-third, and dig in mamire. Apply 
 salt to quince trees. Caterpillars mtij be found close to 
 body and limbs of trees morning and evening, and before 
 dew is off in the morning may be readily destroyed with 
 a brush or swab aflixed to a pole. Pyramidal trees 
 should be headed back, and useless shoots pruned away. 
 Renew with fresh manuring grape vine borders. De- 
 stroy ants with boiling water poured into their holes. 

Vegetable G.vrdex. — Plant and sow such seeds as 
 were omitted last month. Thin out early plantings of 
 beets, carrots, parsnips, salsify, &c., and transplant from 
 frames and warm borders tomatoes, egg plants, pepper 
 and lettuce. Those tender of frost should be reserved 
 till last of month. Sow peas for succession crops at least 
 twice in this month. Plant bush and pole beans, the 
 latter should have the poles set in first, and the beans 
 planted around them. The ground being cleared of early 
 crops of radishes, spinach, &c., should be prepared for 
 beets, carrots and cabbages. Keep the ground free from 
 weeds, and stir frequently with the hoe. Fine pulveri- 
 zation and frequent stii-ring of soil are indispensable to 
 good gardening. Plant cucumbers, melons and squashes 
 in open ground towai-ds last of month. Sow a few tur- 
 nips for early crop, so as to get them of good size before 
 heat of summer. Draw earth up to stems of cauliflow- 
 ers, and water in dry weather Finish sowing seed of all 
 kinds of pot and medicinal herbs. Sprinkle tobacco 
 dust, unbleached ashes, or quick lime, every morning on 
 such plants as are being injured by insects, till they are 
 destroyed.
