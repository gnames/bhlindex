[May 

garden, laying sod, planting box edging, should be con- 
 cluded the early part of this month. Grass plots will 
 soon require mowing, which should be evenly and neatly 
 done, at least once a month from May till October. It 
 requires considerable practice to enable one to mow short 
 grass as it should be. Continue to plant flower seeds 
 according to the directions given last month. Annuals 
 that have been forwarded under frames, should have air 
 admitted to them freely, and after the middle of the 
 month finally transplanted to where they are to bloom. 
 Roses that have been kept under glass may now be plant- 
 ed out; also, petunias, verbenas, salvias, heliotrope, 

and scarlet gei-aniums. Plant dahlia roots, but those 
 which have been grown under glaw, should not be set 
 out till the latter part of the month. Plant tuberoses, 
 gladiolus and tiger flower roots. Plants that have been 
 wintered in cellars should be brought out now. If they 
 require re-potting, do it immediately. If the pots or 
 tubs are as large as desired, take the plants out and re- 
 duce the roots considerably, and shake the old soil well 
 out of them, re-pot with good fresh soil. Oleanders, 
 pomegranates and myrtles do well if planted out in good 
 rich groimd, to be taken up in the fall.
