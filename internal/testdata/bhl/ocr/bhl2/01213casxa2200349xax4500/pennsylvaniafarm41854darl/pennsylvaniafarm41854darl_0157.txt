Belmont. 

American. By some stated to have originated in Virginia, by others in Pennsylvania, ami, on the authority of 
 Prof. Kirtland, Mr. Downing, in his first edition of "Fruits and Fruit Trees," made it synonymous with the "War- 
 ren" of Coxe. As this is yet uncertain, we adopt the name by which the fruit is most largely known. 

Tree, healthy, vigorous, spreading, wood yellowish, good bearer, does not succeed on the alluvial soils of the 
 West, but on all high, warm, or limestone soils does finely, and makes a large tree. 

Size, medium to large ; form, ii-regular, usually roundish, sometimes oblong rounded. South it grows very 
 large, and also West, on new rich soils in Wisconsin ; but grown South its delicacy, fine grain and flavor are lost. 
 Skin, thin, smooth, glossy or oily ; color, rich clear light yellow ; at South with a few dark brown specks, and 
 North with a clear vermillion red cheek, with carmine spots ; South slight russet marblings, and much of mould or 
 fungus ; stem, medium length, projecting slightly beyond the surface, always slender ; calyx, varying from small 
 and close to open and reflexed ; basin, from shallow to rather deep, always furrowed ; flesh, yellowish white, fine 
 grained, very tender, juicy, sprightly, sub-acid ; core, rather large ; seeds, ovate, pointed, abundant, brownish red. 
 Season, November to February. 

Bockport. 

Raised by Prof. Kirtland in 1842 ; gavelly loam. Tree, strong, vigorous grower, forming 
 a very upright habit, more resembling the Black Tartarian than any other variety we know. 
 It is one of the first, of Prof. Kirtland's seedlings, that was described, and feeling interested 
 in its success, in various parts of the State we distributed it pretty liberally in shape of buds 
 and grafts. It has now been fruited extensively, and we feel confident while recommending 
 this, that other varieties of the same origin will be equally successful. The tree wants good 
 culture, and its period of maturity is materially altered both by soil and culture, while its 
 character appears unchanged. Valuable, either for private or market gardens. 

Fruit, large, round, obtuse heart shape, surface generally slightly uneven, and always with 
 a knobbj^ or swollen projection on one side ; color, clear brilliant deep red, shaded and mot- 
 tled on a pale amber yellow, with occasional carmine spots ; flesh, yellowish white, radiating 
 lines irregular, a yellow tinge around the pit, firm, juicy, sweet, with a rich, delicious flavor; 
 pit, oval, regular and without ridges; stem, usually of medium length â€” one to one and a half 
 inches. Season, 20th to last of June. 

Eenicott. 
 Raised by Prof. Kirtland, and named after the most 
 enthusiastic horticulturist in the West, J. A. Kennicott, 
 M. D., of Northfield, 111. Tree, vigorous, hardy, spread- 
 ing, very productive. Fruit, large, oval heart shape, 
 compressed; suture, shallow, half round ; color, amber 
 yellow, mottled and much overspread with rich bright, 
 clear, glossy red; flesh, yellowish white, firm, juicy, rich 
 and sweet ; pit, below medium size, smooth and regular; 
 stem, short in cavity, with bold surrounding projections. 
 Season, 8th to 16th .July. As a market fruit, the time 
 of ripening, size and beauty of this variety will make it 
 popular when known.
