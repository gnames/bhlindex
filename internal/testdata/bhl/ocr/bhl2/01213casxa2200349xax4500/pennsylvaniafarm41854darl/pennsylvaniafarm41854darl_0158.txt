Practical Work of the Farm. 

Mk. Darlington : — -1 have sometimes thouglit you 
 might devote a column or two of the Journal to short 
 communications on the practical work of the farm, with 
 some pecuniary advantage to your subscribers. I think 
 it more than likely that the farmers who take this Jour- 
 nal, as a whole, perform their work in as neat and labor 
 saving a manner as any in the Union, but some have a 
 better mode of doing one thing, and others a better way 
 of doing another ; and as farmers are a stay-at-home 
 people, we do not always profit by the example of our 
 neighbors. To give us the advantage of each other's 
 experience, without neglecting our farms to look for it, 
 I propose that every subscriber to the Farm Journal, who 
 thinks he knows how to perform any branch of farm la- 
 bor better, or quicker, than the generality of his neigh- 
 bors, shall write out his plan, if not in the most ap- 
 proved style, never mind ; I know from experience that 
 the editor is a scholar and a gentleman, and will correct 
 our grammatical errors, and if he should be tempted to 
 laugh at our manuscript, will keep all the fun to him- 
 self. 

As I do not propose a plan without being willing to 
 assist in carrying it out, I will give you one or two ex- 
 amples of my own gains from seeing what others were 
 doing. 

I have helped to plant potatoes in the usual way (ev- 
 ery thii'd furrow) ever since I could carry a school bas- 
 ket full, and thought I could not be taught any thing 
 further about it ; but not more than two years since, I 
 discovered that one of my neighbors planted about twice 
 as many with the same force of men and horses. The 
 only difference was that we opened both planting fur- 
 rows at the same round, and he plowed a round and a 
 half after crossing the first row before he planted the 
 opposite row. We waited for the plow, and the plow 
 had to wait for us, while he kept both going all the time; 
 and I am well satisfied that any man having more than half 
 an acre to plant will save from one to two dollars by the 
 difference of time. 

And as it happens to occur to me, (although rather 
 out of season,) I will give you another of my acquire- 
 ments, obtained in the same way. I have always stack- 
 ed my own corn fodder, and never had a sheaf to spoil 
 except the top course; but as I run the rick parallel with 
 the yard wall, I always thought it necessary to plant two 
 or three poles or scantling to keep the ends perpendicu- 
 lar, but last fall I noticed one of my neighbors had built 
 a rick perpendicular at the ends, in fact rather over- 
 hanging, without supports of any kind. As I had rath- 
 er prided myself on stacking fodder, I began to grow 
 less almost as fast as Davy Crockett, when the Indians 
 were prying into the tree top in which he had concealed 
 himself; but as I was not too old to learn, I soon discovered 
 that it was done by placing the end sheaf, and bending 
 four or five stalks back, lengthwise of the rick, and then 
 placing the adjoining sheaves ; the four or five stalks 
 bent back from the band of the end sheaf, having the 
 weight of the adjoining fodder on them, prevents the end 
 of the rick from slipping out. 

Now, gentleman, the track's clear and the way open, 
 do not keep your light under a bushel, but give us the 
 benefit of your experience. V. W. I. 

"A Query Answered." 

J. L. Darlington: — The case stated in the February 
 number of the Farm Journal, in regard to the sale and 
 purchase of grain, and the query propounded in connec- 
 tion therewith has been answered by your correspondent 
 "L," in the last number of the Journal, in a manner not 
 quite satisfactory to some of your readers. 

A presents B with a sample of wheat for inspection, 
 with the information that he has five or six hundred 
 bushels for sale, according to sample. B replies that he 
 will give him the market price for the wheat. But it 
 happens that the grain in question is not delivered for a 
 few weeks, during which time the market price rises or 
 falls, as the case may be, some fifty cents per bushel. 
 What is the rule or custom observed in the purchase of 
 grain to be applied in the case supposed. 

B says I will give you the market price. Now it ap- 
 pears to me that this expression must be allowed to be 
 governed by circumstances as to its sense and evident in- 
 tention. Every port in the Union where grain is pur- 
 chased has rules and regulations to govern, and a price 
 which is deemed a market price. New Fork has a mar- 
 ket price, and New Orleans has a market price, varying 
 as to amount, and each governing, to a certain extent, at 
 the different depots on. the channels for communications 
 to these ports respectively. I refer to these facts merely 
 to show, that in almost every community there is a point 
 for concentration, wherein the rules for pui-chase are 
 made and established ^hich govern in that community. 

In conclusion I will revert to the regulations which 
 are adhered to in this section of the country, (with 
 which I am best acquainted,) which have been establish- 
 ed by the millers on the Brandywine, Wilmington, Del. 
 The rule is, as I am informed, to pay the market price 
 at the time of delivery, \uiless a special contract has been 
 previously made as to time and price. The justice and 
 propriety of this rule I think must be apparent. If the 
 seller is allowed a few iveeks for delivery at his discre- 
 tion, and without special contract, he may, to carry out 
 the principle, postpone the time for delivery for six 
 months or a year, or any other indefinite period. T.

Improvement of Stock. 
 Mr. Editor : — I admire the sentiments of Mr. Gille- 
 land's preamble and resolution, so far as it advocates the 
 improvement of stock in our State. By all possible 
 means each and every man should try to convince his 
 neighbor that there is more profit in raising one good 
 animal than there is in two or three poor ones. Now 
 admit a law were passed to tax all male stock, would it 
 have the desired effect ? I am of the opinion that it 
 would not. There is a great deal of humbug practised 
 on farmers in regard to stock ; many, if not being ac- 
 quainted with the different breeds, would be as likely 
 to be deceived as under our present system. I think be- 
 fore our Centre county friends urge the passage of a 
 general law to that effect, they should confer with agri- 
 culturists from different sections of the State. I would 
 prefer that the State and County Agricultural Societies 
 should hold out inducements to township and neighbor- 
 hood clubs to buy bulls, rams and boars, of undoubted 
 merit to improve theii' stock.
