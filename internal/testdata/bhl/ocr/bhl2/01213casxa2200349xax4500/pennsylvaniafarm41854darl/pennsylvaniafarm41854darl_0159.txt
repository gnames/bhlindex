I throw out these hasty remarks, Mr. Editor, in the 
 hope that it will call out those who are competent to dis- 
 cUss the matter with the Centre county gentleman. I 
 am satisfied that Mr. Gilleland, and others of that meet- 
 ing, are men of good judgment, and quite as anxious as 
 I am myself to arrive at tht . v^. ^ ^u of improving our 
 stock. This can more readily be effected by comparing 
 views and opinions, through your valuable Journal, by 
 our most experienced farmers. Yours respectfully,

Milk House. 

Editor of Farm Journal: — I observe, in March num- 
 ber, "A Subscriber" wishes some information respecting 
 a milk house. If the subscriber would come to my 
 place, I will inform him what I know about them. I 
 have used one for five years, and find it will answer. As 
 for bringing the water the distance he says, it will not do 
 I think. The way mine is fixed will cost less than to 
 bring the water 600 feet in pipes ; mine answers the 
 warm weather as well as the best spring house in the 
 State. Yours, &c., BENNETT M. TEMPLE.

Sowing Grass Seed. 

J. L. Darlington: — The importance of having the 
 land that is laid down to grass for pasture, or other pur- 
 poses, well and completely covered, is a consideration, I 
 think, of more importance than many farmers have as 
 yet esteemed it. 

The unnecessary exposui-e of the soil to the rays of a 
 summer's sun, I have ever regarded as injudicious and 
 unwise. Every practical agriculturist must have ob- 
 served that, wherever and whenever the soil is complete- 
 ly covered and protected from the rays of the sun, that 
 invariably it becomes rich and fertile. Notice, for in- 
 stance, the character of the soil which has been covered 
 for some time by rails that have been thrown upon the 
 ground, or by stones that have been gathered from the 
 fields and deposited in heaps, by boards, brush, or any 
 thing else, that will serve to protect the soil from the 
 rays of the sun for a considerable length of time, and 
 you will perceive that the soil thus protected has become 
 a black, rich loam. And let it not be said that it is ow- 
 ing to the rest that the soil has obtained by being placed 
 in this situation, for if it is compareil with the soil adja- 
 cent thereto, and of the same natural quality, and. in ev- 
 ery respect similai'ly situated, except the protection thus 
 casually aff"orded, and you will find by every test that 
 may be applied that the portions thus pi'otected hav.e 
 become infinitely more fertile than that immediately ad- 
 joining. 

Observe, too, the condition of our forest lands. No- 
 tice, if 3'ou please, lands that are covered with a kind of 
 timber, aff^ording an abundance of foliage, such as our 
 native oaks, and you will there find a rich, fertile soil ; 
 unless, as is often the case in exposed situations, the 
 swift winds sweep the fallen leaves from the position in 
 which they were wont to lie, seemingly to protect and 
 nourish the parent tree ; then, to compare the soil thus 
 exposed to the other portions, where the foliage has ac- 
 cumulated, and you will again find further proofs to sus- 
 tain our position. 

In accordance, therefore, with the views herein pre- 
 sented, I conceive it to be a consideration of the utmost 
 importance to the interests and prosperity of the farmer, 
 whenever, in the cultivation of his fields, he anticipates 
 putting them do'wn to grass, to sow plenty of seed. Say 
 of timothy six quarts, and of clover a peck per acre, in 
 order (if for no other reason) to have the soil protected 
 from the rays of the sun. T. 

Experiments with Manures. 

J. L. D.vrlington: — All persons engaged in farming 
 to any extent have felt the necessity of increasing the 
 size of the manure heap. Having some experience in 
 that line, I have concluded to give the result of that ex- 
 perience to the readers of the Farm Journal. 

We have a stable separate from the barn where twelve 
 mules are kept. For several years after this stable was 
 put up, we threw out all the manure at the end of the 
 stable, where, between the rains that leached out the 
 soluble parts, and the fermentation that was almost con- 
 stantly going on, causing the escape of the gasses, and 
 consequently from this cause the quantity also was very 
 much lessened, M'e were able to obtain in the coui-se of 
 the year from forty to fifty loads, and rather poor stufif 
 at that. After following that plan for several years I 
 came to the conclusion to make some alteration in that 
 department. I put up a shed at one end of the stable 
 for the better protection of the manure. The plan then 
 adopted, and the one I still continue to pursue, is to 
 spread a layer of manure and then a layer of earth, (say 
 about three inches thick each,) the earth we obtained 
 from the sides of the road, the scrapings of ditches, &c. 
 When we come to take out in the fall of the year, instead 
 of forty to fifty loads as heretofore, we obtain from one 
 hundred and forty to fifty loads. The quantity not only 
 greatly increased, but the quality also. 

In the fall of 1852 I had a favorable opportunity of 
 comparing the efl'ect of the compost manure with that 
 from the barnyard, also of testing them in comparison 
 with guano and Chappell's chemical salts and guano mix- 
 ed together. The field these experiments were tried on 
 contained a little over twenty-five and three-fourth acres. 
 It might be well to state how this field had been cropped 
 for some years previous. For three years previous to 
 1851 it had been in clover, that spring it was planted in 
 corn and yielded seventy-five bushels to the acre, the 
 next spring it was sown in oats and turned ofif near fifty 
 bushels to the acre, in the fall of 1852 it was sown in 
 wheat and manured as follows: No. 1, eight acres, re- 
 ceived a coat of manure from the barnj'ard, about six- 
 teen cart loads to the acre spread on the stubble, and 
 plowed under ; No. 2, four acres, had sown upon it 
 about 300 lbs. of guano to the acre, and plowed under ; 
 No. 3 manured with the compost, about the same quan- 
 tity as No. 1 per acre ; No. 4, four and three-fourth 
 acres, received 150 lbs. of guano and 200 lbs. Chappell's 
 salts. The guano moistened with pickel, made of salt 
 and water, as strong as it could be made, and then mix- 
 ed with the salts, and sown on the top after the ground 
 was plowed. I cannot come at any great degree of ac- 
 curacy in the result as the wheat which was sown upon 
 it, was not kept separate from the different parts of the 
 next harvest. All I could judge from was the difference
