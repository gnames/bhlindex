he who set out with the belief that all were fools but 
 himself finds that he has, with much expense, madehim- 
 <te\f ridiculous with much iincalled for labor ; reared a 
 column on which he himself stands, an object most prom- 
 inent and conspicuous for folly, extravagance and igno- 
 rance. 

Such is the fate of unprepared and uneducated agri- 
 cultural endeavors. All who take to agriculture, even 
 in the humblest view of the art, find that there is an 
 amount of practical details absolutely necessary to be 
 known, that require vigorous, active, practical talent to 
 attain, and that no man can conquer these but by perse- 
 vering cff"ort. By one bred upon a farm, to whom woi-k 
 is a habit as well as a necessity, these details are imper- 
 ceptibly acquired; they are not to him laborious exer- 
 tions, but a routine that forms his life and his daily oc- 
 cupation, but to one whose sniff of fresh air has not been 
 gathered beyond his place of business, and whose mus- 
 cles have not been hardened by toil, the necessary ex- 
 posure and the necessary labor of a farmer's life are 
 nearly insurmountable obstacles to success. 

This applies, however, rather to one who intends to 
 work than to one who intends to make high farming his 
 pursuit. The first must have muscle as well as mind, 
 the other makes money a substitute, and by its useless 
 and unnecessary expenditure tries to conceal and overlay 
 the consequences of ignorance. Still to him the knowl 
 edge of details is necessary, for if entirely ignoi'ant of 
 them, he will find that he has entered a powder maga- 
 zine with a lighted match. 

It should be impressed on all who enter upon agricul- 
 tural pm-suits, that as a business they are not profitable. 
 The art of husbandry seems to have been especially de- 
 signed as a healthy and happy occupation, as the means 
 of erecting a vigorous people, one on whom, whether in 
 war or peace, the strength and stability of empires re- 
 pose. Their lives and fortunes are fixed, but they are 
 not exposed to the fluctuations of trade, nor to the haz- 
 ard of speculation. Still, whoever becomes a farmer 
 should be aware that he has not chosen the path that 
 leads to a rapid or large accumulation of wealth, nor is 
 it the career of ambition. The pride, vanity and active 
 selfishness of those who seek power are, by no means, 
 compatible with the plain and frugal life, and toil, and 
 sweat of a husbandman. It is possible to gi'atify that 
 ambition that prefers usefulness to eminent position, but 
 agriculture has no honors for those whose hearts are fill- 
 ed with discontent, and whose brains ai-e filled with the 
 excitement of p?ission. 

Those, then, who turn to agriculture, must set out 
 with the clear understanding that they are to derive no 
 profit from their investments, that they may do much 
 good, or, by the judicious expenditure of money, be of 
 the greatest use, but that if they start with the conceit- 
 ed assurance that they already know as much or more 
 than men whose knowledge is a tradition and an ancestral 
 inheritance, besides being objects of continued ridicule, 
 they will find that they have found TTldUom, and subdued 
 weeds, at a very heavy cost. 

We do not mean by these remarks to deter any one 
 from engaging in agricultural pursuits. There are cer- 
 tainly none more engaging or interesting, but we w-.^n 
 to warn off from the very precincts of the art o^" hus- 

bandry a class of men, who, by their extravagance, ill 
 success and disappointment, make the name of agricul- 

ture a by-word.

For the Farm .Tournal. 

The Persevering Farmer. 

Picture to yoursel' an anxious elf, 
 With large, stout limbs and little pelf, 
 Striving to be master for himself. 

By leasing a sluggard's farm. 

The house is old, and needs repairs, 
 Utensils all are worse of wears, 
 The doorless stable — how it stares! 

The roof is off the barn. 

The foatherless fowls do hoarsely crow, 
 The fleshlcss cattle dimly low, 
 Ilurses to work can scarcely go, 

I wish the winter by. 

The breeding sow, she loudly squeels, 
 She gets each week but seven meals, 
 She's dizzy in the head, and tumbles "the creels," 
 My family sit and cry. 

In spring the grass begins to grow, 
 Some fielils with summer grain I sow, 
 And plant five acres with potatoe, 

In hopes they'll all do good. 

Next I plant a field with corn, 
 With wearied soul, and heavy mourn, 
 My jaws are thin, mj' clothes are torn, 
 I scarce get any food. 

Now the grass has grown up fall, 
 I free the cows from out the stall. 
 They run to pasture — how they bawl, 

With heads as light's a feather. 

Now see them gaze around the field, 
 Now they milk and butter yield, 
 I've built a shed for them to shield 

From rain and stormy weather. 

The hens have, too, begun to lay. 
 Each pays my wife an egg per day, 
 Mag now smiles, and seems to say 
 Now well all get rich. 

Our daughters blithe, their dresses kilt, 
 To strip the cows and churn the milk. 
 On Sundays they are clothed in silk, 
 We all attend the church. 

Our grain fields now hang full of ears. 
 The horses now prick up their ears. 
 This change of things dispels our fears, 
 Our sturdy sons rejoice. 

At harvest time we gather in, 
 Filling barn, cellar, crib and bin. 
 Never tasting whiskey, rum and gin, 
 Good cider is our choice. 

The house and implements are mended, 
 The barn is now with roof defended, 
 The stable now with door is blended, 
 Every thing looks snug. 

We're well fed now, and trimly go, 

We are snuglj clothed from "top to toe," 

We have pleasure now in place of woe, 

That makes us cock om- lug. 

We are rosy now, though once so blue. 
 Stout perseverance took us through, 
 And drove all obstacles from view. 

Likewise distress and poverty. 

To God each day we kneel and pray. 
 To keep us all from going astray, 
 Our yea is yea, our nay is nay. 

Our worldly friend is Industry. 
 Philadelphia, Jan. 23d, 1854, WALTER ELDER.
