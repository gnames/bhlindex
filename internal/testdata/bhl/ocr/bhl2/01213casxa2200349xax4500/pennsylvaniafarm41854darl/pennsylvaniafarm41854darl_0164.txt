BREAD-MAZING. 

We shall not presume to instruct our fair readers in the 
 art of bread-making. The process, however, involves some 
 scientific principles, which we propose to explain in contin- 
 uation of our series of familiar remarks on chemistry. 
 Wheat flour contains two principal ingredients, gluten and 
 starch, besides a small per cent (4-100 to 8-100) of sugar. 
 The outside of the kernel of wheat contains a larger propor- 
 tion of gluten than the finer flour. These two parts of the 
 flour may be separated easily by enclosing a little flour 
 made into a stiff paste, in a linen bag, and kneading it in a 
 basin of water, until the water that comes through is no 
 longer white. The starch by this process escapes from the 
 bag, and the gluten, a tough, adhering mass, remains within. 

If flour were simply mixed up with water, and baked 
 without raising, it would make a very close, indigestible and 
 unpalatable bread, hardly worthy of the name. To become 
 soft, light and palatable, the dough must be raised. This is 
 effected, ordinarily, by one of two common processes. In 
 making what is generally known as raised bread, — improp- 
 erly so disdnguishod, because all bread is raised either be- 
 fore baking or in the process, — the dough is made up with 
 water only, it may be, and a small portion of yeast, which is 
 to act as a ferment. In the making of cream-of-tartar or 
 sour-milk bread, the means of raising it are different and act 
 in a very different way, chemically. In the first, the fermen- 
 tation of the yeast or leaven is extended to the mass of fresh 
 dough. The decomposing gluten acts upon the sugar and 
 resolves it into alcohol and carbonic acid gas. This gas, in 
 the form of little air bubbles, is disseminated through the 
 loaf, and expands or raises it, being prevented from escaping 
 by the glutinovis nature of the dough. The alcohol formed 
 by the fermentation is expelled from the dough by the heat 
 of the oven. It has been collected sometimes, in large ba- 
 keries, but hardly pays for the trouble. The dough some- 
 times becomes sour before baking, in consequence of a sec- 
 ond fermentation — the acetous — by which the alcohol is con- 
 verted into vinegar, on the absorption of oxygen from the 
 air. It then becomes necessary to introduce into the dough 
 some alkaline substance, as soda or saleratus, which unites 
 with and neutralizes the acid, and makes the dough sweet 
 again. 

In the second kind of bread named above, the carbonic 
 acid to raise it is obtained from the carbonate of soda, or of 
 potassa, (saleratus) by mixing with it in the flour some acid, 
 as sour milk, cream of tartar, or cider, or vinegar, or hydro- 
 chloric acid — either of which, by its stronger affinity for the 
 alkaline base — the soda or potassa — unites with it and libe- 
 rates the carbonic acid. We see that by this mode of raising 
 the bread, the sugar of the wheat is retained in it; whereas 
 by the other process it is converted into alcohol and carbonic 
 acid. We see also that the use of soda or saleratus is very 
 different in the two kinds of bread-making. In the first, 
 the alkaline base is required to neutralize the acetic acid, — 
 in the second, the carbonic acid is needed to raise the bread. 
 In each case a neutral substance is left in the bread; in the 
 first, an acetate of soda — in the second, a base of soda or 
 potassa, united with whatever acid is used. 

Bread when baked is neither starch nor gluten. The glo- 
 bules of starch which remain unbroken in the flour, swell 
 and burst under the influence of the moisture and heat, and 
 with the gluten unite chemically with the water of the dough 
 and form bread. No separation of the starch and gluten can 
 be effected after baking. Even a portion of the water chem- 
 ically united with the bread cannot be separated fro.,^ it by 
 evaporation. The hardest and driest bread has water cv.*n- 
 bined with the flour. 

Gluten is the most nutritious part of the flour. The bran. 

therefore, should not be excluded from the bread, if we have 
 regard to its highest nutritive qualities. 

The crust of broad, when moistened and returned to the 
 oven, becomes smooth and shining. A portion of the starch, 
 in the process of baking, is converted into gum. This gum 
 on being moistened spreads over the surface of the bread 
 producing the smooth surface, and also giving the crust a 
 taste which the bread does not have. Corn bread has a pe- 
 culiar aromatic flavor, owing to an oil which is disseminated 
 through the meal. The inferiority of meal long ground, to 
 that which is fresh, is due to the change which exposure to 
 the air has made in these oily particles. — Portland Eclectic.

 Pump. 

The above engraving represents one of these valuable 
 articles. The following description is by the Judges on 
 machinery at the last New York State Exhibition : 

"The cylinder is 4 inches in diameter; length of stroke 
 6 inches. At the ordinary speed of hand pumping, it 
 throws a stream through 18 feet of hose and a f nozzle 
 to the distance of 80 feet. When the point of delivery 
 is 4 feet 4 inches above the surface of the water in the 
 well, ten strokes of the lever raise three gallons of water; 
 or it will raise, with ease, 27 gallons per minute, at the 
 ordinary rate of leisurely pumping. In cases of emer- 
 gency, with rapid action, it could be made to raise double 
 or treble that amount. It has a movable air-chamber, 
 carries a steady, continuous stream, is dui-able and un- 
 affected by frost. Where a farmer desires to have a 
 pump in his well, which besides supplying his family and 
 stock with water, will answer for a fire engine, when 
 connected with a hose and pipe, he cannot have a pump 
 bef^er suited to his purposes than this one."
