Six Reasons for Planting an Orchard. 

Mk. Editor : — In glancing over an agricultm-al work 
 this morning, I came across the following "six reasons 
 for planting an orchard." They are so sensible, and so 
 much to the point, that I would by permission transfer 
 them to the pages of the Farm Journal, for the benefit 
 of such of your readers who do not fully appreciate the 
 benefits of a good fruit orchard on a farm. It will be 
 too late to induce any one to plant this spring, but they 
 can begin to get ready and have the ground prepared 
 for planting next fall: 

"1. Would you leave an inheritance to your chil- 
 dren ? — plant an Orchard. No other investment of mo- 
 ney and labor will, in the long run, pay so well. 

2. Would j-ou make home pleasant — the abode of the 
 social virtues — plant an Orchard. Nothing better pro- 
 motes among neighbors a feeling of kindness and good 
 will, than a treat of good fruit often repeated. 

8. Would you remove from your children the strong- 
 est temptation to steal — plant an Orchard. If children 
 cannot obtain fruit at home, they are very apt to steal it; 
 and when they have learned to steal fruit, they are in a 
 fair way to learn to steal horses. 

4. AVould you cultivate a constant feeling of thank- 
 fulness towards the great giver of all good — plant an 
 Orchard. By having constantly before you one of the 
 greatest blessings given to man, you must be hai-dened 
 indeed if you are not influenced by a spirit of humility 
 and thankfulness. 

5. Would you have j'our children love their home, 
 respect their parents while living, and venerate their 
 memory when dead — in all their wandei'ings look back 
 upon the home of tlieir youth as a sacred spot — an oasis 
 in the great wilderness of the world — then plant an Or- 
 chard. 

6. In short, if you wish to avail yourselves of the 
 blessings of a bountiful Providence, which are within 
 your reach, you must plant an Orchard. And when you 
 do it, see that you plant good fruit. Don't plant crab 
 apple trees, nor wild plums, nor Indian peaches. The 
 best are the cheapest." L.

BROOM CORN. 

Mk. Ebitor: — Why is it that so little attention is 
 paid in Chester county to the cultivation of Broom Corn. 
 There is scarcely a farmer in the county, I presume, that 
 supplies his family with brooms of his own growing, and 
 yet he could readily do so, and sell several dollars worth 
 besides, and tliat, too, with so little expense and labor 
 in the cultivation as would make no perceptible increase 
 of either. I have no means of ascertaining the amount 
 expended by the farmers of Chester county in the pur- 
 chase of brooms for family use, but it no doubt amounts 
 to a good many dollars. Whatever it may be, however, 
 it is just so many dollars thrown away, and which ought 

to be applied to such purposes as purchasing fruit trees, 
 improving the grounds around our houses, or if you 
 please, Mr. Editor, in subscribing for the Farm Jontr- 
 nal. 

As a general rule a farmer should buy nothing that he 
 can raise on his own land, and there is nothing easier to 
 be accomplished than every farmer to grow and make 
 his own brooms. As a profitable crop, too. Broom Corn 
 could be grown to advantage in many situations. The 
 Rev. Henry Colman — we can have no better authority 
 — says, that the seed is considered about two-thirds the 
 value of oats ; and that mixed with corn it is excellent 
 for the fattening of cattle and swine. The return of 
 seed is often precarious, but still it is frequently abun- 
 dant, and will often more than pay the whole expense of 
 cultivation and preparing the crop for market. The seed 
 varies from twenty to one hundred and fifty bushels to 
 the acre, according to the nature of the soil, the quality 
 of seed, culture and season. One thousand pounds of 
 broom, and seventy bushels of seed to the acre, are con- 
 sidered a fair crop in those parts of New England where 
 special attention is devoted to the culture. The quanti- 
 ty rarely falls below four hundi-ed and fifty pounds per 
 acre, and as seldom exceeds twelve hundred. The aver- 
 age, at the present day, is probably seven hundred 
 pounds to the acre, which, with very little extra atten- 
 tion, might be easily brought up to one thousand, now 
 considered by many cultivators a fair crop. 

In an old number of the Farmers' Cabinet, I find the 
 following remarks by a correspondent upon this subject: 
 "The seed of the broom corn makes excellent food for 
 hogs and cattle. Its nutritious quality may easily be 
 discovered from the fine color and taste which it imparts 
 to butter from the cows which are fed on it. The best 
 way to use the grain is to grind it with a portion of oats 
 — say about one-third of oats to two-thirds of the seed. 
 Indeed it is so hard and flinty that it should always be 
 ground before feeding it to any kind of stock. 

Good broom corn seed weighs about fifty pounds to the 
 bushel. Its value compared to oats may be considered 
 as about half as much again ; so that should the market 
 price of oats be, say, twenty-five cents per bushel, the 
 broom corn seed would be worth thirty-seven and a half 
 cents. 

Brooms. I think there is a difi'erence of twenty-five, 
 if not thirty per cent., in the quality of brooms sent to 
 market, from such as I generally use in viy family. I 
 always endeavor to procure from the manufacturer, 
 and for which I pay him an extra price, such as are 
 made from the stalks before the seed ripens on them. A 
 broom made from such tops will last much longer than 
 one made from the ripe brush. But the peculiar excel- 
 lency of the broom consists in its fibres being more soft 
 and elastic, and performing the act of brushing or 
 sweeping, similar to the brush made of bristles, without 
 injuring the carpet if used prudently. After the broom 
 shall have been used in sweeping the parlor, and the 
 finer parts worn away, it will then be as good to sweep 
 the other parts of the house as the best new broom 
 made from the ripe corn. Ladies wdio set so deservedly 
 such a high value upon their beautiful Turkey and Brus- 
 sels carpets, should purchase none other than such as 
 are made from the unripe brush. The broom made from
