Committee be instructed to recommend a Convention to 
 be }ielil in Harrisburg." 

The above being all the information we have been able 
 to collect, seems to show that the first movement with 
 reference to a State Agricultural Society took place in 
 the Philadelphia Society for Promoting Agi-iculture. 
 AVithout a State Society there would have been no State 
 Farm School, and as we consider the latter will, if right- 
 ly managed, prove hereafter to be one of the most im- 
 portant movements of the present times, it is desirable 
 that the high honor of originating it should be placed 
 where it properly belongs.

 tain by gift, grant or otherwise, a tract of land contain- 
 ing at least two hundred acres, upon which they shall 
 procure such improvements and alterations to be made, 
 as will make it an institution properly adapted to the in- 
 struction of youth in the art of farming, according to 
 the meaning and design of this act ; they shall select and 
 choose a principal for the said institution, who, with such 
 scientific attainments and capacity to teach as the Board 
 shall deem necessary, shall be a good practical farmer ; 
 he with such other persons, as shall from time to time be 
 employed as teachers, shall compose the faculty, under

 ified to impart to pupils under their charge, a knowledge 
 of the English language, gi'ammar, geography, history, 
 mathematics, chemistry and such other branches of the 
 natural and exact sciences, as will conduce to the proper 
 education of the farmer; the pupils shall themselves at 
 such proper times and season, as shall be prescribed by 
 the board of trustees, perform all the labor necessary in 
 the cultivation of the farm, and shall thus be instructed 
 and taught all things necessary to be known by a far-
