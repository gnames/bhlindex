HORTICULTURAL IMPLEMENTS. 

With the view of adding to the very great interest, to 
 be seen both in town and country at the present time, in 
 favor of agricultural and horticultural pursuits, we an- 
 nex a few cuts of improved implements, which should be 
 found in every garden and orchard, and are indeed ne- 
 cessary, each for its particular purpose. A complete set 
 of tools, well made, with a place to keep them in, some- 
 thing like the admirably arranged tool house, (portrayed 
 in a former number,) of our friend Townsend Sharpless, 
 contributes greatly to the zest and enjoyment of either 
 the practical or amateur gardener. However little a 
 man or a woman may work in the garden or orchard, 
 there is a satisfaction in doing it well and nicely, with a 
 suitable and convenient implement. A limb or shoot 
 wants to be lopped from a favorite pear tree. If to do 
 this one must send to a neighbor to hunt up a heavy lad- 
 der, which perhaps is twice as long as necessary, if a 
 common carpenter's saw, intended for dry timber, has to 
 be hunted up in addition, which is altogether unsuitable 
 for green wood, the probability is too much time will be 
 lost, and the over luxuriant branch will have to remain.

or averancator, with a long handle, figured below, if con- 
 venient as they should be, in a room suitable for the 
 purpose, would convey to the mind a pleasant idea of 
 their exact adaptation to the purpose, and confer a real 
 enjoyment on the operator. This is merely one instance, 

and many more might be cited of the improvements in 
 all kinds of tools, and their construction for particular 
 uses. We believe there is a real wholesome, moral in- 
 fluence produced in a family, or on a farm, by such ar- 
 rangements as the tool house of our friend T. Sharpless 
 in our February number. The habits of order, system 
 and method, induced particularly on the young, are high- 
 ly important. 

Formerly a heavy iron hoe, spade and axe to chop off 
 limbs, were considered all that was necessary about the 
 gai'den or orchard. Now we have, first, the fiuit or 
 folding ladder, light and yet strong and convenient ; 
 when shut up, as in the right hand figure, it can be laid 
 away in a corner, or on a shelf, and occupy but little 
 room. It is very portable, is made of diffei-ent lengths, 
 and can be placed among the branches of the tree with 
 great facility. It can also be used for washing windows 
 and other domestic purposes, and may be found valuable 
 in cases of fire from its great facility of moving 
 about. 

Fig. 2 is the averancator or pruning shears, which is 
 attached to a pole and operated by means of a lever 
 moved by a cord and pulley. It enables a person stand- 
 ing on the ground to prune trees, the branches of which 
 could not well otherwise be reached. Branches an inch 
 in diameter may readily be cut off with them. They are 
 used Avith great advantage for cutting off ends of limbs 
 to which insects are attached, and scions and buds from 
 the topmost branches. 

Fig. 3 is a pruning saw and chisel fastened on a long 
 handle, also used for trimming trees. The blade of the 
 saw is about 12 inches long, and the chisel 3 inches wide, 
 made of the best cast steel. It is also a valuable imple- 
 ment. 

FIG. 4. 

Fig. 4 is a grass lawn rake, having teeth sharpened on 
 both edges, and is used for raking clean, grass plots and 
 lawns, and also cutting off flower heads or buds of dai- 
 sies, dandelions, and uneven tufts, which cannot be done 
 with ordinary rakes. 

FIG. 5. 

Fig. 5 is a floral rake with six teeth, and a polished 
 steel hoe blade upon the opposite side, with handle 15 
 inches long, for weeding beds, and is a very neat imple- 
 ment for ladies' use. 

FIG. 6. 

Fig. 6 is a convenient little pronged hoe or weeder.
