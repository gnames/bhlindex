FIGS. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 

represent a light cast steel garden hoe, transplanting 
 trowels and scufle hoes. These latter are exceedingly 
 valuable in the garden, performing their work much bet- 
 ter, in half the length of the time of the hoe. We would 
 not have a garden without one. The operator walks 
 backwards, thus leaving the ground newly worked and 
 untrodden. They stir up the soil beautifully, and can 
 be worked very nicely around the plants. They are also 
 exactly adapted for cleaning walks of weeds, grass, &c. , 
 and are made of different sizes from three to twelve 
 inches wide. 

FIG. 12. 

Fig. 12 is a garden reel and line, made of cast steel or 
 wrought iron, and is indispensable for laying out beds 
 and walks with regularity. The axle is extended so as to 
 stick in the ground when the desired length of line is run 
 off. An iron rod also accompanies for the other end of 
 the line. This reel will last for many years. 

FIG. 13. 

Fig.l3 is a grass edging knife, fitted to a straight han- 
 dle, used for paring the edges of grass bordering walks, 
 and cutting the outlines of sods, which may then be rais- 
 ed with the spade.

FIG. 15. 

Figs.l4& 15 are bill hooks, usedfor cutting small bush- 
 es,briars, and for pruning hedges, and may be used with 
 one hand. Those with longer handles require both 
 hands, and can be used where the branches cannot be 
 reached with the other. 

FIG. 16. 

Fig. 16 are large garden shears, used for trimming 
 hedges, shrubbery and box edging. They come of vari- 
 ous sizes, and arc adapted for ladies' use. 

FIG. 17. 

Fig. 17 is a very convenient grafting saw, for sawing 
 off small limbs, previous to splitting for inserting the 
 graft. 

We shall continue these illustrations in next number. 

THE CONCORD GRAPE. 

Some of the New England States, and especially the 
 atmosphere around Boston, appear to be the prolific 
 source of the most extraordinary productions, both in 
 fruit, flowers and vegetables, on this continent. Nothing 
 small or inferior originates near Boston. Her pumpkins 
 and strawberries are the largest, her seedling pears, 
 cherries and seedling verbenas, are said to surpass every 
 thing yet known, and when the Diana or some other of 
 her own seedling grapes, gets a little stale, and some fresh 
 novelty is wanted, the Boston nurserymen are ready for 
 the occasion, and manage to get hold of something else 
 near to keep up the excitement. The Concord Grape is 
 now fairly launched, and Messrs. Hovcy & Co. offer to 
 furnish one year old vines at the low price of $5 each,
