or $iO per dozen to the trade. This extraordinary 
 grape is thus spoken of by Messrs. Hovey : 

'â€¢This remarkably fine American variety is the great- 
 est acquisition which has ever yet been made to our hardy 
 grapes, and supplies the desideratum, so long wanted, of 
 a superior table grape, sufficiently hardy to withstand 
 the coldest climate, and early enough to ripen its fruit in 
 any part of the Northern or New England States. 

"It is a most vigorous growing vine, perfectly hardy, 
 with bunches of large size, handsomely shouldered, often 
 weighing a pound, and with large, roundish oval berries, 
 frequently measuring an inch in diameter, color very 
 dark, covered with a thick blue bloom, flesh free from all 
 pulp, flavor very rich and luscious, with a fine sprightly 
 aroma. The foliage is large, broad and tliick, and the 
 berries have never been known to moulder, rot, or drop 
 off, under any circumstances, during the five years since 
 it has borne fruit. All good judges who have tasted it 
 pronounce it far superior to the Isabella in its ripest 
 condition." 

If the above description is not calculated to make one's 
 mouth water, and to enclose a $5 note at once, by the 
 first mail, to secure a vine of the Concord grape, it will 
 be, when a further notice is read, "that orders will be 
 attended to in the rotation in which they are received." 
 This seems to indicate the danger of delay. 

We, of course, have not tasted the Concord grape, and 
 should not have had a word to say about the above gla- 
 ring dscription, but that a cotemporary, also published 
 at Boston, dissents from 'Sir. Hovey's opinion, and says, 
 "before the Concord was placed in his hands for sale, he 
 spit it out of his mouth as a poor thing ;" and "among 
 the good judges, who do not pronounce it superior to the 
 Isabella, are the present President of the Massachusetts 
 Horticultural Society, the Chairman of the Fruit Com- 
 mittee, and the two surviving Ex-Presidents." The edi- 
 tor of the Practical Farmer says, he sat within a yard of 
 Mr. Hovey, at the annual dinner of the Horticultural 
 Society, when the Concord gi-ape was very generally pro- 
 nounced by good judges "to be good for jellies." 

Messrs. Hovey & Co. also advertise that they possess 
 X\ie entire stock of the "Boston Pear," and the "Hovey 
 Chen-y." The former can be had at $5 each, a /ew large 
 trees at $10 each, and the Hovey Cherry at $5 each. 
 They also advertise new seedling verbenas fully equal to 
 "America." We have had America in our collection, 
 and should suppose unless they are fully equal to it they 
 would not be worth much. 

Should any of our friends determine to possess them- 
 selves of any of the above novelties, we hope they will 
 request Mr. Hovey to pack in the bundle for us some 
 samples of the genus ^'E^ilops, during its several stages 
 of transformation into ^'Triticum." He devoted several 
 pages of his Magazine, in an editorial article, to prove 
 this possible, and as having been done, and although re- 
 peatedly' requested in our Journal to send on specimens 
 to us has fiiiled to do so. Probably he dislikes to tax us 
 with freight. This dif&culty can be obviated in the plan 
 now proposed. 

are sometimes fod in England, and his belief was really stag- 
 gered by some of the report;^; but he saw in one butcher's 
 shop, four sheep, which had been raised and in Gloucester- 
 shire whose weight whou .slaughtered end dressed for sale 
 as mutton was 250, 245, 216, and 197 pounds respectfully. A 
 shoulder, cut fairly from the largest, weighee 42 i lbs. Two 
 Lincolnshire sheep in the fame shop weighed 216 and 201 
 pounds respectively.

BOOK NOTICES. 

Elliott's Fruit Book, or the American Fruit Grow- 
 er's Guide in Orchard and Garden, by F. A. Elliott, 
 near Cleveland, Ohio. 

The above work, which has been long expected, has at 
 last appeared, and from the examination we have been 
 able to make, consider it a valuable addition to our list 
 of fruit books. The author is well known as an experi- 
 enced and careful pomologist, and his book is the result 
 of ten years close personal observation, as well as aid 
 derived from other practical growers, and reliable au- 
 thorities. He describes minutely the characteristics of 
 )ver 900 names & synonyms of apples, 400 cherries, 900 
 pears, 400 peaches, 300 plums, 180 grapes, besides 
 gooseberries, currants, raspberries, strawberries, &c. 
 The subjects of propagation, culture, pruning, packing 
 trees, keeping of fruit, soils, exposure, and specific ma- 
 nures are also severally well treated. 

It is especially valuable in making us acquainted with 
 many native fruits of the west and north western sec- 
 tions of our country, not much known hei"e, but which 
 are well worthy of trial from their very sujjerior quali- 
 ties, among which are the celebrated Cleveland cher- 
 ries. 

The woi'k is well illustrated with cuts, a new feature 
 of which is exhibiting the internal structure of fruits, 
 their size, and arrangement of cores, seeds, kc, which, 
 as is well remarked, are often more sure guides to indi- 
 cate varieties than the external form. We extract in 
 present number illustrations and descriptions of fruits, 
 to show more distinctly the plan pursued. The same 
 variety often varies so much in external characters, as to 
 make it very difficult to be recognised, even by the most 
 careful pomologist, without reference to the growth 
 and form of the tree. The internal structure, as exhib- 
 ited in the book before us, will be a great additional help. 
 Every fruit grower should have a copy of it. 

The Culture of the Grape and Wine Making by 
 Robert Buchanan, with an appendix, containing di- 
 rections for the Cultivation of the Strawberry by W. 
 LoNGWORTH, of Ciucijinati. 

The publishers have obligingly forwarded us a copy of 
 the above valuable treatise, containing a large amount of 
 infoi-mation about grape vines and vine yards, their pro- 
 pagation, culture, diseases, insects, spring and summer 
 pruning, cost and profit to the acre, with the art of ma- 
 king wine, gathering and pressing the grapes, fining the 
 wine, &c. It, in fact, embodies all the experience of the 
 vicinity of Cincinnati in grape culture and wine making, 
 which is s.aying suflicient to make the work sell even as 
 a matter of general interest and curiosity. The Cincin- 
 natians are the best authority on these matters. We 
 wish we could say as much for them about strawberries. 
 It appears, within a circle of twenty miles around Cin- 
 cinnati, there are 1200 acres under vine culture, produ-
