ducing on an aA^erage 240,000 gallons of wine annually. 
 Tlie number of acres now in bearing is 740, containing to 
 the acre of vines, at a distance of three by six feet, 2400 
 plants. We have no doubt there are many portions 
 of Pennsylvania, where vineyards could be planted to 
 great profit. 

The appendix on Strawberry Culture, by N. Long- 
 worth, who is so identified with the great "Strawberry 
 Question," is also interesting. We shall publish in next 
 number, the report of the committee to whom was referred 
 the investigation of the sexual character of the straw- 
 berry. They seem to have arrived at certain conclusions 
 or postulates. Dame Nature has many vagaries in her 
 disposition, and it is doubtful if she will allow her freaks 
 and fancies to be disposed of in that style. Matters of 
 fact are not always settled by resolutions. President 
 Polk premised in his message to Congress, "Whereas war 
 exists by the act of Mexico." Some people did not be- 
 lieve it notwithstanding. 

Peddek's L.\nd Measurer. â€” A new edition by C. M. 
 Saxton, New York. 

This little work has never been so well appreciated as 
 it deserved. It is highly useful and valuable to the far- 
 mer, containing tables sufficiently accurate for all prac- 
 tical pm-poses, for finding the contents of any piece of 
 land from dimensions taken in yards, also tables for ma- 
 nuring land, tables of planting distances, tables for 
 plowing, measuring corn in the ci'ib, measuring live cat- 
 tle, &c. 

In hauling the manure, spreading lime, plaster, &c., a 
 certain quantity to the acre, which is now generally done 
 by guess work, the farmer will find it highly useful. The 
 author was formerly editor of the Farmer's Cabinet, now 
 of the Boston Cultivator. 

Either of the above works, with most others on agri- 
 culture and horticulture, may be obtained at Paschall 
 Morris & Co.'s agricultural warehouse. West Chester, 
 and corner of Seventh and Market streets, Philadelphia, 
 and at the book stores generally. 

The "Practical Farmer" is a new and attractive 
 looking visiter upon our table. It takes the place of the 
 New England Cultivator, and is under the management of 
 Wm. S. King, the accomplished Editor of the "Journal 
 of Agriculture," assisted by Prof. Mapes and L. Bart- 
 lett. Published weekly in Boston, at $2 per annum. 

The "Working Farmer," since the commencement of 
 the fifth volume in March, also comes to us in a new 
 dress and otherwise improved. It will be illustrated in 
 future with cuts of improved stock, implements, &c., 
 thus giving increased attraction to this popular work. 
 Published monthly in New York by F. McCready, at $1 
 per annum. 

The "Country Gentleman" is now in its third vol- 
 ume, and more than sustains the high character antici- 
 pated for it. In mechanical execution, and general ap- 
 pearance, it stands in the front rank of the agricultural 
 press. Published weekly in Albany, N. Y., by Luther 
 Tucker, at $2 per annum. 

"Alcohol, and the Constitution of Man," being a 
 popular and scientific account of the chemical proper- 
 ties of alcohol, and its leading effects upon the healthy 
 human constitntiim. Illustrated by a beautifully color- 
 ed chemical chart. This publication is intended to dif- 

fuse a kind of information among the people in which 
 they are too generally deficient. The eflects of alcohol 
 upon both the mental and physical condition of man are 
 very ably discussed and forcibly illustrated. The work 
 is very interesting as well as useful, and should be gen- 
 erally circulated. 

Extracts from the Proceedings of the Philadelphia So 
 ciety for Promoting Agriculture. 

[We have been requested to publish the following ex- 
 tracts from the proceedings of a stated meeting of the 
 Philadelphia Society for Promoting Agriculture, held 
 April 5th, 1854. It will be remembered that Mr. Gow- 
 EN, in a communication published in the February num- 
 ber of the Farm Journal, called in question the regular- 
 ity and deliberation of the Society, in reference to the 
 appointment and report of a committee selected to inves- 
 tigate Mr. Nefflin's version of "Guenon's theory. The 
 remarks of Mr. Gowen caused some feeling among the 
 members, particularly as the recollection of many of 
 them did not correspond with Mr. Gowen's statement. 
 Under these circumstances the matter was brought be- 
 fore the Society at its last stated meeting. The follow- 
 ing is the report of this portion of the proceedings as 
 published in the Germantown Telegraph:] 

Mr. Isaac Newton called attention to an article in the 
 Farm Journal, by Mr. J.\mes Gowen, in which the au- 
 thor criticises the conduct of Mr. Newton and others. 
 Several members objecting to the introduction of perso- 
 nal differences on the floor, the Chair sustained the ob 
 jection, but stated that if any portion of the article re- 
 flected on the Societj-, it might be introduced: when a 
 motion was obtained that the article, so far as it referred 
 to the acts of the Society, be read by the Secretary, 
 which was done. 

On a motion that he be allowed to explain, Mr. Gowen 
 disclaimed all intention of disrespect to the Society, but 
 mentioned that the manner of the appointment, in De- 
 cember, 1852, of a committee to examine the merits of 
 Guenon's method of determining the milking properties 
 of cows, was informal, because it had been done by the 
 Society, and not by himself, who Avas then presiding, 
 lie further afiirmed that the report of said committee, 
 submitted at the subsequent meeting, was verbal, and 
 that it had been adopted without due reflection. 

Several members, who had been present at the adop- 
 tion of the report, certified that it had been presented in 
 writing and properly considered. 

On motion, that the minutes of the two meetings 
 aforesaid be read, which was so ordered, when it appear- 
 ed on the record, that the report had been read and or- 
 dered to be printed, if its authors approved. 

Dr. Kenneby submitted the following resolution : 

Resolved, That the action had at a meeting of the So- 
 ciety, held December, 1852, appointing a Committee on 
 the subject of Guenon's method of determining the value 
 of milch cows, was perfectly i-egular, and that the re- 
 port of said committee, at the following meeting, was 
 regularly made, read and approved. 

After some remarks in favor of tlie resolution by Mr. 
 J. C. Montgomery, and in opposition by Mr. James 
 Gowen, it was adopted unanimously.
