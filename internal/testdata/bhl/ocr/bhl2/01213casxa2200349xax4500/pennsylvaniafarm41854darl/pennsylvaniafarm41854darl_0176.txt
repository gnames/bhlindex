Quantity of Seed to the Acre for Root Crops. 

Parsnip seed sliould be sown iu drills, and about four 
 lbs. to the acre will be required. This will be increased 
 or diminished, according to the skill Avith which it may 
 be sown. A little radish seed dropped along the rows at 
 the same time will soon indicate them, and allow the 
 ground to be stirred early, before the parsnip has germi- 
 nated. We consider parsnips one of the most valuable 
 and desirable roots which can be grown for stock. They 
 will readily yield nine to ten tons to the acre. Davy 
 found 1000 parts to yield 90 parts of saccharine matter 
 and 9 of mucilage. Sow in May. Of ruta baga or tur- 
 nip seed three-fourths to one lb. per acre will be suffi- 
 cient. 

Carrot seed should be sown in drills about one inch 
 deep, and from three to five lbs. to the acre. There is 
 an advantage in rubbing the seed well between the 
 hands, before sowing, to break off the hairy edge, which 
 causes them to adhere so as to prevent regular distribu- 
 tion. Radish seed may also be sown with it as with 
 parsnips. Carrots are a highly valuable crop, and yield 
 from 600 to 1000 bushels to the acre. According to An- 
 t«ine's tables 276 lbs. of carrots are equal to 100 lbs. of 
 hay. They are coming greatly into use for feeding 
 horses through winter, giving them sleek coats and 
 greatly promoting digestion. J. C. Curwen, of England, 
 who was in the habit of constantly employing eighty 
 horses on his farm and coal mines, says that where eight 
 ibs. of oats feeding was allowed to draft horses, four lbs. 
 might be taken away and supplied with an equal quan- 
 tity of carrots, and the ability of the horses be quite 
 equal to that from the whole quantity of oats. In his 
 opinion an acre of sarrots supplied food for working 
 horses equal to fifteen aci-es of oats. 

Sugar beet or mangel wurzel will require three to 
 four poiuids to the acre, and should be steeped before 
 being planted, and rolled in plaster. Plants which are 
 transplanted do not grow so well as the others, besides 
 the additional disadvantage of the time and labor re- 
 quired for the purpose. 

For general rules in root culture, we advise plenty of 
 seed. It is much easier to thin out than to transplant, 
 and much more economical. Manure heavily, plow deep, 
 and thoroughly pulverise. Plant on the level, and not 
 on ridges. Keep the ground well stirred and free from 
 weeds. We hope every reader of the Farm Journal will 
 experiment the pi-esent season, to some extent at least, 
 with root culture. Put in a portion of each kind, and 
 give us the comparative results. 

A Fanciful Gate. 

A correspondent of the Ilome Journal gives a pleasant 
 account of a gate he passed through. The gate was a 
 common one, shut by a chain and ball. But the post to 
 which the inner end of the chain was attached was 
 carved and painted in the likeness of a negi-o, with one 
 hand raised to his cocked hat, and the other extended to 
 welcome you in. As you opened the gate toward you, in 
 going in, the negro post-pointer bent toward you, by a 
 joint in his back fairly bowing you in. Upon letting the 
 gate go to, a spring in his back "brought him up stand- 
 ing" again, ready for the next comer. This faithful fel- 
 low performed the amiable for his master for many years, 

without reward, except now and then a new coat — of 
 paint ; and finally died of a rheumatic back, contracted 
 in his master's service. 

DOMESTIC RECIPES. 

Beef Steaks Broiled. — The inside of the sirloin is the 
 best steak — but all are cooked in the same manner. Cut 
 them about half an inch thick — do not beat them : it breaks 
 the cells in which the gravy of the meat is contained and 
 renders it drier and more tasteless. 

Have the gridiron hot and the bars rubbed with suet — the 
 fire clear and brisk; sprinkle a little salt over the fire, lay 
 on the steaks, and turn them often. Keep a dish close to the 
 fire, into which you must drain the gravy from the top of 
 the steak as you lift it to turn. The gridiron should be sot 
 in a slanting direction on the coals, to prevent the fat from 
 dropping into the fire and making a smoke. But should a 
 smoke occur, take off the gridiron a moment, till it is over. 
 With a good fire of coals, steaks will be thoroughly done in 
 fifteen minutes. These are much healthier for delicate sto- 
 machs than rave done steaks. 

When done lay them in a hot plate, put a small slice of 
 good butter on each piece — sprinkle a little salt, pour the 
 gravy from the dish by the fire, and serve them hot as possi- 
 ble. Pickles and finely scraped horse-radish are served with 
 them. 

Mutton Chops. — Cut the chops off a loin or the best end 
 of a neck of mutton ; pare off the fat, dip them in a beaten 
 egg and strew over them grated bread, seasoned with salt 
 and finely minced parsley — then fry them in a little butter, 
 and make a gravy, or broil them over coals and butter them 
 in a hot dish. Garnish with fried parsley. 

Curries. — Chickens, pigeons, mutton chops, lobsters and 
 veal, all make good curries. If the curry dish is to be made 
 of fowls, they should be jointed. Boil the meat till tender, 
 in just sufiieient water to cover it, and add a little salt. 
 Just before the meat is boded enough to take up, fry three 
 or four slices of pork till brown — take them up, and put in 
 the chickens, Let them brown, then add part of the liquor 
 in which they were broiled, one or two tea spoonfuls of cur- 
 ry powder, and the fried pork. Mix a tea spoonful of curry 
 powder with a tea cup of boiled rice, or a little flour and 
 water mixed — turn it on to the curry, and let it stew a few 
 minutes. 

Fire-Fanged Manure. 

The season of the year has arrived when stable manure is 
 prone to fire-fang — a chemical change that lessens its value 
 from 50 to 60 per cent. To prevent such a loss is an object 
 of much importance in farm economy, and we will endeavor 
 to explain the subject in a way that will render it plain to all 
 interested in providing food for plants. 

Few are ignorant of the fact that a mass of dung thrown 
 from a stable, and particularly that from horses and mule, is 
 apt to heat, and sometimes it proceeds to spontaneous com- 
 bustion. This heating is not injurious, if only moderate in 
 degree, for it always precedes, and attends fermentation, 
 whether vinous or putrefactive. The latter is what the skil- 
 ful farmer desires to increase the solubility of manure ; for 
 Nature rots vegetable and animal substances to prepare their 
 elements for reorganization in the cells of living, growing 
 pl.ants. Fire-fanging is a peculiar chemical operation analo- 
 gous to burning wood into coal, or charring hay and straw 
 by imperfect combustion. It not only checks putrefactive 
 fermentation in a manure heap, but drives off in a gaseous 
 state all the nitrogen and ammonia it may contain. Half 
 burnt dung and straw (fire-fanged manure) refuses to fer- 
 ment, rot, or dissolve for the nourishment of crops, for along 
 time after it is buried in tilled ground. Ilonco, it is not too 
 much to say that a farmer who allows his dung-heaps to fire- 
 fang really loses nearly three-quarters of the value of the 
 same, and often more than that.
