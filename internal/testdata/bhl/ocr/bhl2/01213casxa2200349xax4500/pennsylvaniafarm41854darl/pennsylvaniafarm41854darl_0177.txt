How one can best prevent this excess of heating is the 
 point new to be considered. It is done simply by spreading 
 the mannro over a greater surface so thin as not to heat at 
 all, but thicker or thinner according to the weather and the 
 nature of the manure. To adopt the language of farmers, 
 some excrements are of a more heating nature than others; 
 and no one rule will apply to every condition and composi- 
 tion of the dung-heap. It should not, however, be long ex- 
 posed to the open air, rain, and sunshine, but be covered over 
 with loam, clay, or vegetable mould. In this State Scotch 
 farmers call their dung-heaps "pies;" the covering of earth 
 being the upper crust, and of clay or leaf-mould being the 
 under crust. The right management of these "pies" is quite 
 as difficult as the management of a coal-pit, or burning 
 brick-kiln. All air must not be excluded, for that would ar- 
 rest decomposition. To learn the condition of the mass, the 
 farmer sticks a stake into it, which being drawn out, he 
 learns from the steam, gases and temperature of the air that 
 issue forth, how his pie is baking. If the heat is too great, 
 the heap should be forked over immediately to cool it, as you 
 would separate the sticks in a burning brush heap; or you 
 may cover it deeper and closer to exclude the air as you 
 would close the draft in a coal-pit, a lime or brick-kiln. If 
 water is convenient, make stake holes into the heap and 
 pour water into them just enough to put out the latent fire 
 below. 

To avoid all loss and labor of this kind, we prefer to haul 
 most of our manure in a raw, unfermenied state, into the 
 field, spread and plow it in at once, and let it rot in the soil. 
 This course is not always practicable, and the dung has to be 
 preserved in some form for future use. To have it rot and at 
 the same time decompose a good deal of cornstalks, straw 
 and forest leaves, mixed therewith, and loss nothing of its 
 volatile elements, is the end to be aimed at. D. Lee.

 EXPERIMENT IN FEEDING. 

BY JOHN BROOKS, OF PniNCETON, MASS. 

Herewith, you have an account of some trials in feeding, 
 which I have made at the time mentioned, with a view to de- 
 termine the regular value of different kinds of food for pro- 
 ducing milk, and the proportion of solid manure to the hay 
 consumed. 

December 17, 1851, commenced feeding two cows about 7 
 months after calving; the cows were gravid and expected to 
 calve about March next, live weight 1600 lbs., one of them 
 44 and the other 31 months old. Each trial continued 5 
 days : 

First 5 days fed on 2 per cent of live weight, 

of hay cut daily 32 lbs. 

2 lbs. of Indian Meal, hay Vu.lue, 8 " 

Hay value of daily. food 40 " 

Hay value of 5 days food 200 " 

Cost of 5 days food, hay at i lb., $1,00 

Milk in 5 days 61.875 lbs. 

Cost of milk, (hay at i cent per lb.) 1.6 cents to the lb., or 

3.2 cents the wine quart. 

SECOND TRIAL. 

Fed 5 days on 2i per cent, of live weight of cut hay. 

Cut hay daily 40 lbs. 

Cut hay in 5 days 200 lbs. 

Cost of 5 days food, hay at i cent, per lb. $1,00 

Milk in 5 days 60 lbs. 

Cost of milk, (hay at i cent per lb.) 1.6 cents the lb., or 

3.3 cents the wine quart. 

These trials show that 2 lbs. of Indian meal are very 
 nearly equal to i per cent, of live weight of hay, or that one 
 pound of meal is equal, nearly, to 4 lbs. of good English 
 hay. 

THIRD TRIAL. 

Fed 5 days on cut hay 16 lbs. 

32 lbs. oat straw, hay value 16 " 

2 lbs. Indian meal, hay value 8 " 

Hay value of food daily 40 " 

Hay value of 5 days food 200 " 

Cost of 5 days food, hay at i cent per lb. Si, 00 
 Deduct 5 lbs hay and straw not consumed 2i 

$0.97i 
 Milk in 5 days, 50 lbs. 
 Cost of milk, hay at i cent per pound, 1.99 centa the lb., 
 or 3.9 cents the wine quart. The hay and straw cut, given 

wet: the meal sifted over the hay and straw. This trial 
 seems to show that 2 lbs. of oat straw is not equal for milk 
 to 1 lb. of hay. 

FOURTH TRIAL. 

Fed 5 days on cut hay daily 16 lbs. 

Oat straw cut, 32 lbs. hay value, 16 " 

2 lbs. Indian meal, hay value, 8 " 

Hay value of 5 days food, 200 " 

Deduct 6 lbs. not consumed, 6 " 

194 
 Cost of 5 days food, hay at i cent per lb. $0.97 
 Milk in 5 days, 48 6-16 lbs. 
 Cost of milk, hay at i cent per lb., 1.9 cents per lb., or 3.9 
 cents the wine quart. The hay, straw and meal were given 
 dry. This trial shows that haj', straw and meal is not so 
 good for milk as when wet. 

February .'?, 1852, commenced feeding two cows one 33 
 months old, 14 days after calving, live weight 1000 lbs. The 
 other 31 months old, 7 months after calving, not now in calf, 
 live weight 690 lbs. These cows were fed 5 days on 42 lbs., 
 or 2i per cent, of their live weight of uncut hay and 50 lbs. 
 of flat turnips daily. 

Uncut hay daily, 42 lbs. 

Turnips, 501b3., hay value, 10 " 

52 

Hay value of 5 days food, 260 lbs. 

Cost of 5 days food, hay at i cent per lb. $1,30 
 Milk in 5 days, 153.6 lbs. 
 Cost of milk, hay at i cent, per lb., .846 of a cent the lb., 
 or 1.6 cents the wine quart. 

SECOND TRIAL. 

Fed five days on cut hay. 

Cut hay daily, 42 lbs. 

Turnips, 52 lbs., hay value, 10 " 

62 

Hay value of 5 days food, 260 lbs. 

Deduct 5 lbs. not consumed, 5 " 

255 
 Cost of 5 days food, hay at A cent per lb. $1.27.5 
 Milk in 5 days, 152.2 lbs. 
 Cost of milk, ,837 of cent per lb., or 1.6 cents the wine 
 quart. 

The cows did not eat the hay quite so well as the long hay 
 on the first trial, so that the whole experiment shows a small 
 difl'erence in favor of cut hay. 

THIRD TRIAL. 

Fed same as second trial, except gave 3 lbs. of Indian 

meal instead of 50 lbs. of turnips. 
 Cut hay daily, 42 lbs. 

3 lbs. Indian meal daily, hay value, 12 " 

54 

Hay value 5 days food, 270 lbs. 

Deduct 10 lbs. hay not consumed, 10 

260 
 Cost of 5 days food, hay at i cent per lb. $1,30 
 Milk in 5 days. 153 lbs. 
 Cost of milk, hay at i cent per lb., 0.849 of a cent per lb., 
 or 1.6 cent the wine quart. This trial seems to prove that 3 
 lbs. of Indian meal is equal to 12 lbs. of English hay or 50 
 lbs. of flat turnips, for milk. 

FOURTH TRIAL. 

Fed cut hay daily, 42 lbs. 

33 lbs. carrots daily, hay value, 11 â€¢' 

53 

Hay value 5 days food, 265 

Deducts lbs. of hay not consumed, 5 

260 
 Cost of 5 days food, hay i cent per lb., $1,30 
 MUk in 5 days, 150.5 lb. 
 Cost of milk, hay at i cent per lb., 0.863 of a cent per lb., 
 or 1.7 cents the wine quart. This trial shows that 33 lbs. of 
 carrots are not quite equal for milk to 50 lbs. flat turnips or 
 3 lbs. of Indian meal. The cows in all the trials had freu 
 access to water. 

December 10, 1851, commenced feeding 1 cow, 72 months 
 old, one ditto, 96 months old, one ditto, 48 months 6 old,
