heifers 32 months ohl, 7 heifers 22 months okl, 4 calves 9 
 months old, and 4 calves 8 months old. These cattle weigh- 
 ed live weight. 14,507 lbs., and were fed 5 days on 277 lbs. 
 of cut hay daily, and drank daily 887 lbs. of water, dropped 
 daily 6C8 lbs. of solid manure, or 2.41 lbs. of manure for one 
 lb. of hay consumed. 

Second trial commenced December 16, 1851. Fed same 
 cattle five daj's on 352 lbs. hay daily, solid manure dropped 
 daily 860 lbs., or 2.44 lbs. for one lb. of hay consumed ; 
 drank daily 868 lbs. of water. 

February 28, coiunienced feeding one cow 72 months old, 
 one ditto, 96 months old, and one 48 months old, 3 heif- 
 ers 32 months old, and 6 heifers 22 months old. The live 
 weight of these cattle was 9,472 lbs.; they were fed 5 days, 
 240 lbs. cut hay daily; solid manure dropped daily 594 lbs., 
 or 2.47 lbs. of manure for one lb. of hay consumed. Drank 
 daily 542 lbs. of water.

The proportion of manure to hay is as 2.44 lbs. of manure

Songs of the Poultry Yard. 

Now that poultry-keeping has become as fashionable as 
 crochet, and every well-regulated young lady keeps her Co- 
 chin Chinas in preference to a canary, we may naturally ex- 
 pect the mania will soon aflect the inspiration of our lyric 
 writers. We are convinced, indeed, that songs for the poul- 
 try yard will be counted very shortly with the wants of the 
 age, .and will soon supplant those senseless "WiU-yo'i-luve- 
 me-theii-a^-vow's," with which the sentimental school has far 
 too long afflicted us. We are, therefore, tempted to antici- 
 pate the national demand, and to supply at once a specimen, 
 which any poultry-minded maiden has our full permission to 
 inscribe in her album — supposing that exploded nuisance 
 can be anywhere found extant: 

Air — "Labia hath a Beaming Eye." 
 Lesbi.a hath some Cochin Chi- 
 na fowls of most superior breeding; 
 Every one too fat to fly. 

So constantly she keeps them feeding. 
 Daily wakened by their crows, 

At some precocious hour she rises, 
 And while tlieir breakfast forth she throws, 

Her pets she thus apostrophizes: 
 "0 my Cochin China dear — 

(I mean expensive) — Cochin China; 
 Most hens lay 
 0.10 egg a day. 
 But you lay two, my Cochin China !"

Pulse of Various Animals. 

The pulse of several of our domestic animals, as given by 
 Vatel, in his "Veterinary Pathology," is nearly as fol- 
 lows: 

Horse, from 32 to 38 pulsations per minute; Ox or Cow, 
 35 to 42; Ass, 48 to 54; Sheep, 70 to 79 ; Uoat, 72 to 76; 
 Dog, 90 to 100; Cat, 110 to 120; Rabbit, 120; Guinea Pig, 
 140; Duck, 136. Hen, 140. 

The Cranberry. 

It has frequently been asked — "What is the most success- 
 ful method of ndtivatiug the cranberry?" This may perhaps 
 be a somewhat difficult question to answer, .as it "has been 
 grown "successfully" in a great variety of ways, and on .al- 
 most every description of soils intervening between dry .and 
 dusty sands, and those composed of viscid and tenacious 
 clay. It is indigenous in low boggy lands and consequently 
 to such its cultivation has, till recently, been almost exclu- 
 sively confined. When grown on such lands, the plants are 
 generally "set" in the fall. The bog land requires no pre- 
 paration, except a covering of sand about two inches deep. 
 The vines .are removed from tlieir original position, with a 
 small quantity of soil attached to their roots, and tr.ans- 
 planted two or three feet apart. They develope foliage ra- 
 pidly, 'and require hoeing only during the first two years 
 after being set out. When cireumstunces admit of it, it is a 

good plan to keep the water on them from December till 
 about the first or second week in April, and after that, to 
 keep it, if possible, level with the ground's surface, so as to 
 retain a supply of moisture about the routs during the first 
 part of the season. E.arly frost, or frost in the autumn, be- 
 fore the fruit begins to ripen, proves fatal to the crop. Cran- 
 berries are obtained from vines thus managed, the second or 
 third year, and the plants when once established never run 
 out. 

A writer in the Massachusetts Plowm.an, gives an experi- 
 ment in transplanting cranberries from low, swampy land 
 into good corn land, "in hills far enough apart to admit the 
 cultivator and clean hoeing." The work of transplanting 
 w.as performed early in the spring; at midsummer they 
 blossomed, and in fall produced fine fruit. The berries were 
 large, very handsome, and many of the hills produced apint 
 of fruit. 

In 1840 the Cultivator contained nn interesting article on 
 cranberry culture, in which it w.as asserted that Mr. Sullivan 
 Bates, of Bellingham, Mass., had raised this fruit in great 
 abundance, "by transplanting the vines from low ground to 
 high." The system this gentleman pursues is, it seems, to 
 plant them in lines, or drills, twenty inches a])art, (whether 
 vines or seeds it is not stated,) and seven inches in the drill. 
 His plan is always successful. He had from a siugle acre, 
 in one season, cranberries to the amount oi four hundred 
 bushels ! It is essential, however, to the success of this 
 plant, that the soil be such as will not p.areh or bake, and 
 should be replete with energetic humus in a state of slow 
 but uniform decomposition and decay. 

It is also asserted in the Farmer's Dictionary, that the 
 cranberry is a plant easily and successfully cultivated on up- 
 lands, and that its powers of prolific.ation, and the general 
 health and physiological character of the production, appear 
 to be ameliorated and greatly improved by changing its me- 
 dium, and also that the product is more desirable, being of a 
 fairer development and superior flavor. "Tlie runners," 
 says the authority, "can be 'layered,' or seed sown in the 
 spring. They grow rapidly, covering nearly everj'thing, 
 and are but little subject to the .attacks of insects. The 
 plants are set about eight inches apart, and are kept clean 
 at first. The yield increases for several j'ears, and becomes 
 as groat as four hundred bushels per acre in five years, al- 
 though two hundred is a good average. The fruit is gather- 
 ed with rakes, which serve to prune the plants at the same 
 time. When the berries are intended for keeping, they 
 should be rolled over a gently inclined plane of wood, in or- 
 der to remove such as are soft or rotten. They keep well 
 for a year in tight casks, filled with water, and headed 
 close." 

It is stated in the American Agriculturist, that Mr. Wm. 
 Hall, of Norway, Maine, "sowed the berries on the snow, in 
 spring, on a boggy piece of land, about three rods square. 
 The seed took well; rooted out the weeds, and produced ac- 
 cordingly." It is greatly to be hoped that the cultivation of 
 this plant, now ascertained bj' so little trouble and expense, 
 will become more common. — A New Exglaxdeu. — German-

Should Cattle be Fed Three Times a Day 1 

A correspondent of the Ohio Farmer thinks that sheep 
 and cattle should not be fed three times a day. He says a 
 cow, when turned into good grass, will eat with avidity for 
 an hour or so, the ruminating process is then commenced, 
 and continued for three or four hours more. The food is in 
 this w.ay thoroughly masticated and mixed with saliva be- 
 fore it enters the second stomach to be acted on by the gas- 
 tric juice and digested. The digestive process will occupy 
 four or five hours. We have, therefore, "allowing two and 
 a half hours for eating, one hour for rest, four hours for ru- 
 minating, and four (jr five for digestion, eleven or twelve 
 hours between the times when an animal would naturally 
 need feed." He thinks from this that feeding animals threo 
 times a day is not only unnecessary, but positively injuri- 
 ous. 

If the animal is fed at 6 A. M., and again at noon, the ru- 
 minating process is not completed, and if fed at 5 P. M., it 
 will not give the animal sufiicient time to masticate the 
 food, even by keeping its grinders in constant motion, so 
 that .at the best there must be forced on the digestive organs 
 a portion of the food improperly masticated, causing an ex- 
 tra amount of labor fur these organs, and at the risk of cn» 
 gendering disease.
