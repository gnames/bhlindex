His practice has conformed to this theory, and he thinks 
 his stock at least as good as liis neighbors', who feed three 
 times a day. He asks those who think differently to give a 
 reason for their belief, and also to try a lot fed twice a day 
 against a lot fed three times. 

We have always considered it advisable to feed animals 
 throe times a day, and have observed animals so fed, on an 
 occasion when the noon's feed has been omitted, manifest all 
 the symptoms of real hunger, eating substances which, un- 
 der ordinary circumstances, they would not touch. But per- 
 haps we are wrong : at all events, let us have the experiment.

The Object of Plowing. 

The object of plowing is not fully understood and consid- 
 ered by the majority of those who perform the work ; if it 
 were, it would be done more faithfully and thoroughly. It 
 is not alone to kill the weeds and grass, nor even to furnish 
 a seed bed of fresh turned soil for planting or sowing — nor 
 anything which looks merely to the inversion of the sod — 
 which constitutes good plowing. Largo plows, turning a 
 wide and shallow furrow, will show a large day's work — but 
 the work is very imperfectly accomplished, when the true 
 object of plowing is considered. The chief value of plow- 
 ing isthe preparation it gives the soil for producing vegeta- 
 tion — for giving to the plants sown or planted, the elements 
 of growth and fruitfuluess. It should thoroughly pulverize 
 and loosen the texture of the soil, and thus admit a free cir- 
 culation of air and moisture, which, bj' chemical action, dis- 
 integrates or breaks down the stony or mineral portions of 
 the same, so that they may be more readily dissolved and 
 taken up b.y the roots. 

In a soil thus plowed — thus prepared for yielding its sup- 
 port to vegetable life — plants can appropriate from far and 
 near the nutriment needed for their growth. It is dissolved 
 and ready for their use — not hidden in unbroken clods or 
 slumbering in an undisturbed subsoil — but awaits their ac- 
 tion in a friable and penetrable state, where every hungry 
 rootlet, sent out to gather nourishment for its parent plant, 
 may find and appropriate it. It is truly wonderful how full 
 of minute roots the soil of a cornfield becomes, and if that 
 .soil is fine and deep the deeper and closer together will the 
 fibres permeate and intersect it. This is true of all other 
 crops, and while the leaves and fruit depend so intimately on 
 the vigor and extent of the roots, these facts should always 
 be taken into consideration among the objects of plow- 
 ing. 

Fineness and depth of soil are requisite in order to re- 
 ceive the full benefit of the manures applied. It is not fer- 
 tilizing food in its crude state which assists vegetation — it 
 must first become intimately mixed with, or, in fact, a part 
 of the soil. Barnyard manure, especially, seems of little 
 worth while forming visible layers between the clods of a 
 half plowed soil — it is often dry and coarse— and rather 
 shunned than sought by the roots sent out to forage for suit- 
 able food. If a well prepared soil has any strength and 
 virtue it will yield it readily : and poor land in good tilth is 
 often more productive than better soils less perfectly pre- 
 pared. The influences of air and moisture have freedom to 
 work, and they are no laggards in gathering means to sup- 
 ply the wants of vegetation. 

With those hints on the object of plowing, we might con- 
 nect others on the process — the best means of accomplish- 
 ing that object — but prefer to leave it for other pons. Will 
 our practical farmers, who have thought and experimented 
 upon the subject, tell us what plow, and what depth and 
 width of furrow, taking .ilso soil, season, team, and time 
 into consideration, most thoroughly loosens, pulverizes, and 
 inverts the soil? This information would be of much value 
 to every farmer, and is especially needed in the present state 
 of agricultural progres.s — for taking the country at largo 
 into account, plowing is more imperfectly performed than 
 any other part of farm husbandry. — B. — Rural Ncxc York- 

Culture of Pie Plant. 

All who have had any experience in this matter are fully 
 convinced of the luxury and healthfulness of fresh and suc- 
 culent substances for pies at all seasons of the year. Yet 
 the idea has never suggested itself to the many, or if it has 
 it is not pr.icticed upon, that a cycle of such substances may 
 be had so as to furnish fresh material through the year. The 
 Pie Plant furnishes a beautiful link in this connecting chain, 

coming, as it does, when apples begin to lose their freshness 
 or, as they are in many families, not to be found at all, and 
 before gooseberries, which have not yet found place in one 
 garden out of twenty to any considerable extent. Yet how 
 few cultivate the pie plant! Why, we know not, for nearly 
 all are fond of it when properly cooked, and it can be raised 
 as easily as the Burdock when once introduced into the soil. 
 Neither of them will grow successfully in poor soils. The 
 Burdock chooses a location for itself, and the pie plant is 
 nearly always thrust into some poor corner of the neglected 
 garden, and then blamed excessively if it will not produce 
 large, fine foot stalks where even common weeds would re- 
 fuse to grow, and where no grass would vegetate, unless it 
 be the ever intrusive qu.ack. AVe once planted some misera- 
 ble, puny roots of the pie plant in a rich, deep soil. The 
 consequence was, the next year the size of the foot stalk in- 
 creased one-half. The following autumn, before the setting 
 in of frost, wo covered the bed some three or four inches 
 deep with fresh horse manure. This kept the roots in fine 
 preservation through the winter, and early in spring, when 
 the ground was fairly settled, the manure was mixed with 
 the earth by a deep and thorough forking. No wonder that 
 the vigor of our plants was increased in a wonderful propor- 
 tion ! As soon as any buds appeared they were taken off — ■ 
 the leaves were cut as often as tlioy became large enough for 
 use. The next spring we gave the usual protection of ma- 
 nure, and the following spring we forked it in. This course 
 we have now followed for four years with some plants we 
 took from neglected grass land. Now mark the result: 
 from the miserable, puny leaves and stalks of the first year's 
 growth, when the stalks were not more than six inches long 
 and proportionately slender, wo have now large, broad 
 leaves, and stalks so strong thiit all who see them are inqui- 
 ring where we got our new variety of plant, so luxuriant, 
 strong and beautiful. The answer is conclusive : cultivation 
 has done it ; and the simple process we have followed, if 
 pursued bj"^ others, will, on a small piece of land, and with 
 very little labor, furnish them with an abundance of pie ma- 
 terial at the season when, with many, there is the greatest 
 dearth in that article. If gypsum is sown on the young 
 leaves when the dew is on. it will push their growth finely 
 by aiding the manure at the I'oots in giving them nourish- 
 ment. We have no doubt but this article can be raised in 
 the way we have adopted, so as to furnish it to cultivators at 
 the rate of enough for a pie for half a penny. What a com- 
 fort ! — Horticulturist. 

Ripening of Winter Pears. 

A gentleman writes us : — "This fall I put in boxes Louise 
 Bonne de Jersey Vears; some were in average temperature 
 of 55°, others from 50° to 55°. Those in the coldest room, 
 left there to ripen, were infinitely superior to the others. I 
 assure you I had no idea of the value of that jiear before." 
 This agrees with our own experience. A moderate tempera- 
 ture is better for the ripening of soft, melting pears. 

Another correspondent writes: [Dec. 10.] — "I havejusteat 
 my last specimen of Beiirre Diel and Beurre d' Aujou. It is 
 not generally known, that these two noble pears, if gathered 
 late and kept cool, will keep nearly as long as either the 
 Lawrence, Vicar of Wakejiekl, or Winter Nelis ; they ripen 
 perfectly well in the cellar, too. My Winter Xelis and Glout 
 Moreenu are both ripe, and will not keep much longer. 
 Nothing can be more delicious than the Winter Xelis ; the 
 Glout Moreeau is also fine, but it would bo better if ripened 
 in a higher temperature. The T7cro- will not ripen so as to 
 be presentable at dessert without the aid of a higher tem- 
 perature than the cellar. My specimens are now as beauti- 
 ful as they can be in color, a pale, clear straw color. The 
 other day I was tempted to put some on the table, but my 
 guests, who seized them eagerly, were sorely disappointed. 
 It is an invaluable fruit: but it must have a temperature of 
 50° or 60° before it is fit to be eaten. My Easter Beurres, 
 picked in the iliiddlo of September, are now rijie, and how- 
 delicious ! I cannot praise this pear too highly. It ripens 
 to complete perfection in the cellar without any other care 
 than we give apples, and we can hnve it all winter by pick- 
 ing at different times. Those picked in tlie middle of Octo- 
 ber are now green and hard, and will l;eep sound and fresh 
 till April. Epine Dumas [Due de Burdenuj) is a bo.iutiful 
 and fine fruit, but requires ripening in heat to bo perfected. 
 It is as beautiful and better than Vicn; and must be more 
 extensively grown than I think it is. .Insrphine dc Maline 
 begins to ripen, and is good ; an excellent keeper. It has
