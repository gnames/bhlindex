Putting up the Clothes Line. 

[We commend the following and unique mode of putting 
 np a clothes line to our readers generally, but particularly to 
 those whoso grounds are small. It was furnished by a cor- 
 respondent of the Ohio Cultivator :] 

Deak Mrs. Bateham : — We always bad so much trouble 
 at our house on washing days to get the clothes line put up 
 so as to hold the clothes until they were dry. We had a big 
 naU driven in the post at the corner of the wood house, to 
 which we tied one end of the line, then we took it to an ap- 
 ple tree, about four rods ofiF, and gave it a turn around a limb, 
 from there it is carried to the high post of the garden gate, 
 and then brought back to the well curb. If it was a still, 
 bright day, and the folks were not at work in the yard, we 
 along well enough, but sometimes the winds would blow and 
 flap the clothes about, and being so far from the wood house 
 to the apple tree, they would sweep the ground, unless we 
 propped them up with a forked stick; in which case the 
 whole stretch would sail over, just as a clipper's sail jibes, 
 when the bow is brought into the wind's eye, as the sailors 
 say : and after a few such somersets, the old line would give 
 way, and let the whole washing down in the mud! Mrs. B., 
 did you ever see a woman with a whole washing upset in 
 that way? Its of no use talking to her then! Another 
 trouble was, that the lino from the gate to the well curb was 
 right over the path from the barn to the house, so that the 
 men in passing with the horses generally left their mark 
 upon the clean clothes. Wo worried over these annoyances 
 along while, "until forbearance ceased to be a virtue," for 
 we were growing wickeder every week, and Pa said he would 
 see to it as soon as ho had time, but it seemed to us the time 
 would never come. So when he went to Columbus to stay a 
 day or two, we bribed Billy — a good natured fellow, who is 
 half a carpenter — to make a nice, revolving frame — two cross 
 sticks, with a hole for a peg at the crossing to fasten it flat 
 on the top of a post in the ground. The post is about as 
 high as our heads, and all along on the tops of the cross 
 sticks are pegs like those on a bedstead, about a foot apart, 
 to hold the line, which is run around from one arm to an- 
 other, almost like a spider web. 

The arms of the cross timbers on our frame are about two 
 yards and a half long from the post, and this will hold a 
 large washing. When wo carry out a basket of wet clothes 
 we can set it down and hang one angle full, and turn it 
 around and fill another, without taking up the basket ; and 
 by hanging the sheets, &c., on the outside ropes, which are 
 longest, we can get places for all, where they will not sweep 
 the ground, or be in any body's way; and by turning the 
 whole, once in a while, the sun will dry them all alike. Pa 
 was a little surprised when he first discovered what we had 
 done, but when he saw how much better natured we were 
 on washing days, he said there was more morality in a good 
 clothes line than he had imagined.

Value of Turnips as food for Stock. 

Wo have always thought that turnips, both the flat and 
 ruta baga, were underrated among us as food for stock, while 
 in England they are looked upon almost as the cattle grower's 
 sheet anchor. In this country they are considered by the 
 majority of farmers as rather inferior feed. It is true that 
 the climate of England is better adapted to raising of tur- 
 nips than ours, and it is also true that they cannot raise that 
 king of all provenders — Indian corn, as we can, but never- 
 theless, turnips are valuable as food for stock, and every 
 farmer who raises a good supply, will see a decided profit in 
 feeding them out to stock. 

Recent experiments demonstrate the value of this root on 
 the farm, more clearly than has heretofore been done. They 
 contain quite an amount of what is called nitrogenous mat- 
 ter. Now the flesh or muscles of animals is made up in part of 
 nitrogenous matter, and hence, turnips supply material use- 
 ful in the formation of muscle. Our friend Martin Mower, 
 of North Bangor, once said to us, that ho thought he could 
 add more muscle to his farm stock by the use of turnips as 

feed, cheaper than by anything else. He was experienced 
 much in this kind of feed, and his opinion is valuable on 
 this point. 

Mr. Lawes of England has been experimenting upon tur- 
 nips as a feed, also on the different qualities of turnips grown 
 by different manures. An opinion prevailed that when tur- 
 nips were manured with highly nitrogenous manures, such 
 as barn yard manure, and also with guano they contained 
 uiore nitrogen, and that the more nitrogen in the turnip, the 
 hotter feed it become, The experiments prove the fact, that 
 the more nitrogen in the manure applied, the more nitrogen 
 in the turnip, but that this difierence was not enough to 
 make any essential difi"erence in their value as food. But we 
 look upon the experiments of feeding as valuable, as demon- 
 strating the feeding powers of this root. 

Without giving the details we will state the results. Three 
 lots of cattle being weighed, were put into separate situations, 
 and fed twelve weeks. Their daily allowance each was 1(58 
 pounds of turnips, 10 pounds of small diseased potatoes, and 
 5 pounds of cut hay mixed with cut straw. 

At the end of the twelve weeks they were weighed again, 
 and found to have gained on the average 13^ bbs per week. 
 This proves that there is nutritive power in turnips which 
 some deny. The exact profit of this nutrition we cannot tell, 
 without knowing more of the turnips, and the market worth 
 of the animal thus fed. — Maine Farmer. 

An Ohio Com Crop. 
 The Ohio Cultivator contains a statement of a corn crop 
 raised by A. H. Thompson, of Union County, Ohio, which is 
 the biggest story of the biggest crop we have found going 
 the rounds of the papers for some time. On a field of 20 
 acres, a clover sod, an average of 100 bushels per acre was 
 obtained. But there was one acre of these 20, in a cove "in 
 the second bottom, which I plowed about t«n inches deep in 
 the winter ; — about the first of May, harrowed my sod entire- 
 ly loose ; furrowed my ground two feet each way and had 
 three stalks to each hill ; plowed three times each way, once 
 in each row ; the corn was gathered the first of October, and 
 measured in a large basket, and an average basket-full shel- 
 led in my presence — the amount was ISSij bushels. The re- 
 mainder of the lot was only measured by the wagon-load." 

Action of Frost on Vegetables. 
 The action of frost on potatoes and other vegetables is not 
 clearly understood. It disarranges the particles of matter 
 and induces speedy fermentation. The nitrogenous matter 
 acts on the starch and converts it into sugar, similarly to the 
 action of malting. Hence the sweet tasto of frozen pota- 
 toes. 

Sugar Beet. 

We cannot too often or too confidently recommend the 
 cultivation of this excellent field crop. It is a great yielder, 
 hardy, easily raised, and is superior, we think, to any vege- 
 table grown for milch cows and fattening cattle, especially 
 when fed raw. We have grown large qu.antitiesfor our own 
 use the past seventeen years, and therefore can speak of it 
 practically and experimentally. One of our neighbors — a 
 lady farmer — informs us that she made thirty pounds of but- 
 ter per week from six cows in December, fed on hay and sugar 
 beets. She adds, that the butter was fully equal to the best 
 made in September and October on rich pasture. 

The sugar beet does best in moderat«lj' rich and loamy 
 soil, but will grow where any other root does. The seed 
 should be soaked two to four days in terpid water previous 
 to planting, so as to insure its germination. If planted 
 without first soaking, its shell is so hard it is a long time 
 germinating. Hence the ill success of many who do not 
 take this into consideration. 

For field cultivation the rows should be three feet apart, 
 so as to admit working easily with the cultivator among the 
 rows. The plants, when finally thinned out, should not stand 
 nearer to each other than six inches in the row. It can be 
 pulled and secured in the fall the same as turnips. 

The best variety is the AVhite Silesian, though the French 
 Yellow has been so much improved lately, we are informed 
 it has become nearly as good as the latter. We have never 
 found it to keep so well. 

The boot requires about four pounds of seed per acre, and 
 can be planted very rapidity in drills with a seed-sower, cost- 
 ing about eight dollars. — Am. Agriculturist.
