PENNSYLVANIA FASMERS' HIGH SCHOOL. 

[Immediately on the passage of the act incorporating 
 the Farmers' High School, we applied for a copy for 
 publication, but not receiving it we were compelled to 
 copy it from one of the Harrisburg newspapers. Upon 
 comparing it with a "tnie copy" we find it contains sev- 
 eral errors, and therefore re-publish it for the benefit of 
 our readers. â€” Ed.]
