very fond of it until its culms or sterns become dry, when 
 iieee are pushed aside for fresher grass. 2. It possesses an 
 aromatic principle capable of communicating a delightful 
 flavor to the milky products of the cow, as well as to the 
 meat of sheep and other stock grazed upon it. It furnishes 
 a fine aftermath and rich autumnal pasturage in moist sea- 
 sons. These, I think, are suflBcient reasons for regarding 
 the sweet-scented vernal grass, making, as it does, an im- 
 portant portion of all the best pasture lands of Europe, wor- 
 thy the attention of the American farmer. As the seed sells 
 readily here for seventy-five cents to one dollar per pound, a 
 bushel weighing six pounds, being sufiieieut to sow two or 
 three acres, some might think this alone a suflBcient induce-

 read this, and have the opportunity, will refer to my former 
 communications relative to this grass, I remain.

History of Limeetone and its Constituent eleincntu from 1775 
 up to the present time. 

Leipsic, Feb. 1854. 

Mn. Editor: — It was not until the year 1775 that the dif- 
 ference between the limestone ani burned lime was fully 
 recognized, or the cause of it understood. A short time 
 previous to this period, an importa.ut discussion arose in 
 England among physicians as to the best means of remov- 
 ing the urinary calculi, in cases where such depositions 
 took place. They sought medicines to dissolve the calculi, 
 and thus remove them from the body. For this purpose, 
 lime water was recommended: but that made from limestone 
 was bett-or than t2iat made from oyster shells. A Joseph 
 Block, who was one of the first promulgators of chemical 
 science in Great Britain, entered into this discussion. He, 
 as did the physicians of his time, sought the remedies for 
 this most painful of diseases in alkaline substances, and to de- 
 velop their resources, undertook their investigation by ex- 
 periment. He commenced his investigations under the er- 
 roneous impressions of the times, that by burning mild lime 
 or magnesia, or the carbonated (mild) alkalies, they become 
 caustic by the absorption of this fire material or phlogiston. 
 He knew that caustic lime, exposed a long time to the air, 
 lost its causticity and became mild lime. He reasoned that 
 if its causticity was due to the presence of phlogiston, it 
 must become lighter when this left it, but, on the contrary, 
 he found it became heavier. He found that with magnesia 
 the same eflect was produced, and that after burning, the 
 magnesia was much lighter, and no longer effervesced with 
 acids, but it formed the same salts with acids as when the 
 unburned magnesia was heated with them ; (i. e. that 
 whether burned or unburned magnesia was mixed with the 
 oil of vitriol, the result would be the same ; Epsom salts 
 would be produced.) 

The next object was to find what substance left the mag- 
 nesia when it was burned, by which it became lighter. Ac- 
 cordingly, he put a weighed quantity of the unburned mag- 
 nesia in a glass retort, which was placed in connection with 
 a well cooled condensing apparatus, and then the glass 
 heated to redness. By this means he only obtained a few 
 drops of water in the condensing apparatus, while the re- 
 tort lost quite a considerable portion of its weight. 

The next conclusion was that the loss of weight was due 
 to the evolution of a gas; and that it was the some that 
 passed off when the unburnt magnesia was heated with an 
 acid. Thus were two important starting points reached. 
 The magnesia alba of the physicians was made by burning 

magnesia, and dissolving the caustic substance formed in 
 water, and to this solution adding a solution of the ley ob- 
 tained from ordinary ashes, when the magnesia alba would 
 fall to the bottom of the containing vessel, and the liquid 
 over it could be poured or filtered otf. 

This magnesia alba, efiorvesced with acids, was insoluble 
 in water, possessed no causticity, and lost weight by heating 
 when it became caustic ; but on solution of this caustic 
 magnesia in water, and adding a ley solution to it, the mag- 
 nesia alba was produced again. 

Black went to work to find the source from which the 
 caustic magnesia derived its gas when in solution, by which 
 it was thrown down from the solution, and took on the prop- 
 erties of the mild magnesia, or the magnesia alba. He 
 concluded that it could only he obtained from the ley which 
 was added to the solution ; that the ga,s was in union with 
 the ley salts, (potash and soda,) and that when these came 
 in contact with the caustic magnesia, this gas left them and 
 united with the magnesia and made it fall out of solution. 
 To confirm this idea, he made a quantitative examination 
 thus : He weighed a portion of magnesia alba, and then 
 heated it to drive off its gas, and dissolved the caustic mag- 
 nesia thus obtained in dilute oil of vitriol, (by which it was 
 converted into a solution of Epsom salts,) and to the solu- 
 tion added a potash solution, (solution of corbonato of pot- 
 ash,) and obtained a white precipitate of magnesia alba, 
 which was separated from the water, dried moderately, and 
 weighed, when the weight was found to be very nearly 
 equal to that of the maguesia alba first heated. The con- 
 clusion was satisfactory, that the gas obtained from the ley 
 or potash solution, was identical with that driven off by 
 the heat, or expelled with efiervescence by acids, and that 
 this gas entered into combination with lime magnesia and 
 the alkalies of ashes. He gave it the name of yfaerf air. 

It could be driven out of the first two by heat, though not 
 out of the last ; but acids expelled it from them all. That 
 the earths and alkalies owed their causticity, when this gas 
 w.as driven out of them, not to the presence of a fire mate- 
 rial ; not to phlogiston, but to their own peculiar properties 
 when not in combination with fixed air. 

But the world was not prepared to give up its long cher- 
 ished phlogiston theorj'. This was modified to suit the in- 
 creased knowledge of the times, and still clung to by the 
 opponents of Black ; and many plausible arguments were 
 adduced to maintain the fast falling theory of the day. Its 
 last important modification to suit the times, was in 1764, 
 by John Frederick Meyer, and a few years after, it wa8 
 abandoned as untenable by the principal part of those in- 
 terested in the subject 

Between the years 1770 and 1780. a now era dawned upon 
 the chemical world through tlie efforts of the immortal La- 
 voiser, who first introduced the balance into the hands of 
 the chemist, and taught him that his business was to invest- 
 igate, observe and weigh ; and thus get facts from nature 
 with all possible accuracy, instead of following investiga- 
 tions suggested by the imagination with no other view than 
 to establish some old theory. The sphere of his activity 
 was in France, where, after rendering his country lasting 
 services by his discoveries in <>cience and art, lie was put to 
 death to gratify the murderous hate of Robespierre, (179-1,) 
 in tho fifty-first year of his age. 

He struck the final blow to the phlogiston theory, and 
 this out of the way, the progress of chemical science was 
 more rapid. 

The experiments of Black were confirmed, and the study 
 of this fixed air and that of lime became distinct objects of 
 investigation. It is interesting to contemplate the efi'orts of 
 philosophers to ascertain the character of this fixed air. It
