Fig. 10, Small Seed Sower. — This cut represents a small 
 hand drill for sowing garden seeds. For those who cul- 
 tivate vegetables to any extcat, this will be found indis- 
 pensable. It is so constituted that it opens the drill, 
 drops the seed, covers it, and rolls it at one opera- 
 tion. 

WORK FOR THE MONTH. 
 Farm. — Where a sufficiency of potatoes have not been 
 planted already, the planting may be continued this 
 month. The corn crop now requires particular atten- 
 tion, and its early growth should be stimulated as much 
 as possible. Superphosphate of lime, a compost of gu- 
 ano and plaster of Paris, with a sufficient amount of soil 
 to prevent its caustic effect, or poudrette, should be applied 
 to each hill and well stirred in. The cultivator should 
 be kept at work till harvest time, but the plow kept 
 away. The cut worm will soon be active cool mornings 
 and in damp cloudy weather. Fall plowing, or a dress- 
 ing of five or six bushels Of salt to the acre, before 
 planting, is generally regarded as a preventive. When 
 these have been omitted the cultivation and stimulants 
 should be even more thorough so as to push it forward. 
 Carrots and beets may still be planted in rich, deep soil, 
 and should be attended to at once. Ruta Bagas will do 
 for a month later. Put in corn for fodder, without fail, 
 when there is the least prospect of a short crop of hay. 
 Plaster should be sown occasionally over barnyard, hog 
 pen and stables, as it prevent,s the escape of the ammo- 
 nia. Place lumps of rock salt in fields, so that cattle, sheep 
 and horses may have access to them at pleasure. Latter 
 part of this month, hay, particularly where clover pre- 
 dominates, may be cut. Ilay should not be stirred often 
 in the field, as its quality is injured by too much drying. 
 Salt spread over the mow prevents danger from heating.
