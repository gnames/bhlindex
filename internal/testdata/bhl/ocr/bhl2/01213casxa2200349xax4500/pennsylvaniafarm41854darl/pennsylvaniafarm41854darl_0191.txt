top of tlie post should be sawed sloping, at an angle of 
 about 45 degrees, and have a board nailed on it about 
 two inches broader and longer than the square of the 
 post. 

Gates sliould be barred from eight to nine feet long 
 and from four to five feet high. In order to hang them 
 to shut well when the post is in a true perpendicular, 
 draw a plum line on it; on this line, at a suitable height, 
 ti.N. the top hinge to project three inches and a half from 
 the post, the lower hinge is to be put IJ inches to one 
 side of the perpendicular line, and to project two inches 
 from the post. 

Pastuue. — Elevated dry land is best for bi-eediug 
 sheep, low fat land for fattening cattle. Old pastures 
 are best for fattening stock, while new lays are more 
 fitted to feeding young store cattle. Nothing improves 
 pasture land more than a judicious top dressing of lime, 
 lime compost, artificial marl, well rotted dung or the 
 compost of urine and dirt. 

Rolling two or three times in the spring at j^roper 
 intervals is a benefit. As clover strikes root from every 
 branch in contact with the ground, it will produce a fine 
 thick sward that will cover the whole surface of the pas- 
 ture, and flourish among the most parching droughts. 

Ti.ME OK TiRMNG TO PASTURE. — When Cattle are 
 turned early to pasture they eat off the central stems of 
 the plants, on which they shoot out new leaves around 
 the first joint of the stems; when left late the pasture is 
 more coarse and does not reproduce so well. The time 
 for turning on clover is when it is about shoe top high. 

Meadow. — No land will make good meadow unless it 
 be sufficiently deep to admit the roots of grass to run 
 down out of the reach of summer heats, and also suffi- 
 ciently retentive to hold water long enough to produce 
 fermentations, together with such an absorbent substra- 
 tum as will drain it before putrefaction takes place, and 
 if it be not so by nature it must be rendered so by 
 art.

Explanation of the first two rows of figures in the 
 preceding table : The number of heaps of one load each 
 laid at five yards distance from each other is 193 loads 
 per acre, at two heaps to a load 96, at three heaps to a 
 load G4, at four 48, and so on to the end, each of the 
 following rows read in a similar manner. 

IMPROVED FARMING. 
 One of our correspondents having taken in hand the 
 subject of "High Farming," we have a few words to say 
 appropriate to the season on "Improved Farming." 
 .'VTiother branch of the subject may well be styled "Low 
 Farming," and which we may advert to at another time. 
 Improved Farming may be defined to be that system of 
 cultivation, which extracts from the soil the largest 

amount of production, in the shortest time, and with the 
 least outlay of money and labor. 

We have always endeavored to avoid recommending to 
 our readers the adoption of new theories, however plau- 
 sible in appearance, which would tend to lead them into 
 unproductive outlays, and are more suitable to the ama- 
 teur than the practical fai-mer. We would not adoj't 
 every new ism or ology or pathy that is brought up ; 
 neither should we reject every innovation on our estab- 
 lished systems. Either extreme is to be equally avoid- 
 ed, and to adopt or reject indiscriminately is as rational 
 as the position of the politician, who defined his posi- 
 tion as one "favorable to all the great questions of the 
 day." 

There are certain improvements we would ui-gently 
 bring to the notice of our readers, as having passed 
 through the necessary ordeal of a full trial by practical 
 experiments, and which can be recommended without 
 the least hesitation. That they are but sloivly working 
 their way to favor is but evidence of the prudent hesita- 
 tion, which all those who earn their bread l)y hard labor 
 do and should feel before abondoning old and well tried 
 systems. 

From otir own experience and observation, the follow- 
 ing comprise some important improvements in farm 
 management, attention to which is more or less neglect- 
 ed, and will be found highly profitable. They may be 
 considered a kind of synopsis of improved farming: 

1 . Corn sown for fodder. 

2. Root culture. 

3. Deep plowing and subsoiling. 

4. Proper management of manures. 

5. Proper application of manures. 
 G. More attention to fruit culture. 

7. Greater use of improved and labor saving implements. 

8. The keep always of the best stock of all kinds. 

By the time this number reaches our readers, it will 
 be the proper time for sowing corn for fodder. Ilay is 
 increasing highly every year. The great increase of 
 railroad facilities enables the fanners to pack and for- 
 ward it to the large cites to very great pj"ofit. To sell 
 off a crop of hay will impoverish a field less than a crop 
 of grain. The exhaustion of a soil is a general term, 
 often used without a precise meaning. Different crops 
 exhaust a soil of different constituents, and it is the 
 succession of the same crops which may be said truly to 
 exhaust the soil. If a good substitute exists for the 
 consumption of hay on the farm, and of a less mer- 
 chantable article, more hay can be sold and more profit 
 obtained. 

It may be safely assei-ted that on an acre of corn fod- 
 dei', properly cured and cut by a machine, more nutri- 
 ment is obtained for stock through the winter than at 
 least four acres of hay. AVe believe it would enable the 
 farmer to keep better four times the amount of stock 
 than could be kept on one acre of hay. To those who 
 doubt this, we say try one acre or half an acre. Some 
 disappointment has ensued to those who have tried sown 
 corn fodder, for bad management, not only in preparing 
 the ground, but also the manner of seeding and curing. 
 It should never be sown broadcast, but in rows three 
 feet apart, previously marked out with the plow. Plow 
 well and deeply, manure heavily, pulverize thoroughly.
