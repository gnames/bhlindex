transfer the gist of the book to your own mind, as well 
 as to the paper. Great facts and principles require elu- 
 cidation it is true, but I have often thought that thej' 
 were comparatively lost to the general reader, when em- 
 bodied in long pages of close type, instead of being sep- 
 arated and put distinctly before the eye in bold, brief 
 declarations. A good illustration of the difference be- 
 tween a book as written and its real matter, may be seen 
 by looking at Prof. Norton's Prize Essay on Agriculture, 
 published by the New York State Society. In that es- 
 say Prof. Norton first writes out the matter in words, 
 and then gives a review of its contents, not in an index 
 above, but in a brief abstract of notes, stating in half a 
 dozen pages, or thereabouts, the substance of more than 
 ft hundred pi-obably. Young readers should make such 
 abstracts of all scientific works for themselves. 

In this article, I propose to give you a few facts and 
 principles in agricultural chemistry, without many words 
 about them, to show how they look thus separated. 

Organic Elements of Vegetable Matter — Oxygen, Hy- 
 drogen, Nitrogen and Carbon. 

Inorganic Elements consist chiefly of four acids and 
 four alkalies. The four acids are silicic acid, phospho- 
 ric acid, sulphuric acid and muriatic acid. The four al- 
 kalies are potash, soda, lime and magnesia. 

It is useless to give a plant abundance of any one of 
 its constituents — lime for instance — unless you are sure 
 at the same time that the other ingredients are present 
 also. 

Ammonia is the great stimulant of vegetable growth, 
 without which all other nutriment may remain inert and 
 dead. It is a compound of nitrogen and hydrogen 
 gases. 

Nitrogen is the nutritous, or flesh making principle of 
 vegetables. It is found in great abundance in some 
 grains (as wheat), and such grains are always exhaust- 
 ing to the soil. Carbon, in the shape of gum, starch, 
 sugar, butter, oil, fat, syrup, &c., never enters into the 
 composition of flesh to any great extent, and is chiefly 
 used to admit breathing, and to sustain the beat of the 
 body by being consumed in the lungs. It is also depos- 
 ited in the body as fat. 

In the germination of seeds a small portion of vine- 
 gar, or acetic acid, is found. Alkalies, as potash and 
 soda, combine with and neutralise this acid, and thus 
 assist germination. Hence one important use of wood 
 a.sho3, containing potash, in the hill with potatoes. 

Organic matter as muck, leaves, tan, sawdust, &c., 
 can be of little use iintil it has undergone decomposi- 
 tion, 80 as to put its salts and gases in a condition to be 
 taken up by plants. Hence the reason why some per- 
 sona find so little benefit from the use of raw muck, half 
 rotted tan, &c. 

Peaty soils are always acid. Seeds will not germinate 
 well in such a soil without the aid of potash, soda and 
 lime to neutralise the acid, and perfect the decomposition 
 of the organic matter. 

Lime, in a caustic state, possesses the power of setting 
 free, or bringing into action the potash which a new soil 
 may contain, and hence may serve as good a purpose as 
 lime and ashes. 

Anthracite coal ashes are of little value in agriculture 
 except to open a heavy clay soil. The chief ingredients 

of any value are charcoal and sulphate of lime or gyp- 
 sum. 

Charcoal decays very slowly under ordinary circum- 
 stances. It will last fifty or a hundred years in a dry 
 loam, perhaps longer. In a moist soil, rich in muck, it 
 decays more rapidly, and furnishes carbonic acid to 
 plants or carbon. It is chiefly valuable, however, as an 
 absorbent of ammonia, and for giving a dark color to 
 light sandy soils. It also retains moisture. 

Nitrates, as nitrate of potash (saltpetre) produce 
 straw in grain ; sulphates, as sulphate of soda and sul- 
 phate of lime, promote the growth of grain, beans, peas, 
 &c. 

It is not known how far soila is able to take the 
 place of potash in the soil, or whether it is indifferent 
 which of the two alkalies is supplied to plants. It is 
 better to furnish both soda and potash when absent from 
 the soil. 

Phosphate of lime is a combination of lime with phos- 
 phoric acid. It is the chief constituent of the earth of bones. 
 It exists in the seed of many plants, in all the varieties 
 of grain which are cultivated for food, and in the ashes 
 of most common plants. It exists also largely in milk. 
 It is almost always deficient in the soil. 

A sandy soil admits the heat of the sun more rapidly, 
 and retains it longer, than any other soil ; but it is not 
 so retentive of moisture. The application of charcoal 
 and salt increases the moisture of sandy soils, and so does 
 deep plowing. 

The roots of plants require a supply of oxygen in or- 
 der that they may be maintained in a healthy condition. 
 The atmosphere and water furnish a supply of oxygen, 
 but such possibly can only be obtained where the soil is 
 sufficiently open to permit the free circulation of air 
 and water among its pores, and to carry off excess of 
 water, or water robbed of its fertilizing properties. Plow 
 deep and drain. 

Sulphate of lime (plaster of Paris) requires much heat 
 and moisture to render it useful on land. In dry sea- 
 sons sulphate of soda (Glauber's salts) will prove more 
 beneficial. Bones dissolved in sulphuric acid and com- 
 mon lime are generally more valuable than gypsum. 

Quick lime expels ammonia from decomposed or fer- 
 menting manures. Lime should never be used in the 
 manure heap, unless covered with a large quantity of 
 well pulverized muck. 

Lime has little or no effect upon soils in which loam 
 or vegetable matter is deficient. The effect of lime is, 
 in fact, to eat out vegetable matter. 

It is important to bear in mind that the application of 
 lime, soda, potash, or bones, forms a primitii^e addition of 
 mineral or inorganic matter to the soil, while by plow- 
 ing in green crops we return to the land only the inor- 
 ganic salts which the plants have taken from it during 
 their growth — the rest is organic matter. 

Plants require all their constituents present in the 
 soil, in small quantities at least, to furnish a full crop. 
 Hence the principle that the mora various the fertilizing 
 materials added to the compost heap the better, if a good 
 supply of dry muck be supplied to absorb the ammonia 
 produced by decompo.sition. 

Potatoes and tomatoes flourish best in soils which 
 are not very rich in nitrogen Pig manure and night
