soil are oot useful for these crops unless very minutely 
 divided by loam. The chief ingredients of potatoes are 
 carbon, in the shape of starch in the organic portion, 
 and potash in the organic constituents. Hence fresh 
 muck and ashes are the best fertilizers. 

Turnips require less organic matter (loam or mould) 
 than many other crops. Their chief constituents are 
 phosphate of lime and potash. 

Peat meadows require sand to render them fertile as 
 imperatively as sandy soils require muck. 

And so I might go on through fifty, or any indefinite 
 number of columns, giving facts and principles observed 
 in reading, which are worthy of being specially noted 
 and remembered. I have taken these few passages at 
 random from some works lying near me at this moment, 
 partly copied and partly made up from hints which met 
 my eye. I have done this, not so much on account of 
 the great value of the facts set forth, as for the purpose 
 of showing the student in these matters how much 
 clearer a fact looks, and how much more easily it may 
 be studied and remembered by separating it from the 
 substance of a volume as above. 

Now if the reader of this article had just read the 
 works from which the quotations are made up, and then 
 had exercised his eye and mind and hand in t'^" art of 
 selecting and writing down the passages " readi- 

ly suppose that he would be mov , vo remember 

them, than if he had only trl'vi ..» eye over them in 

the comparatively /wy'"'- ji reading. I trust that 

the valuable sn"- „ ncre given will not be lost

 TIME FOR OUTTIlirG HAY. 

Mr. Darlington : — The practice among farmers of 
 permitting grass to stand in most cases until the seeds 
 are formed, and not unfrequently until they are ripe, has 
 become so general that it seems almost folly to call in 
 question its correctness ; but it is so manifestly at vari- 
 ance with reason and analogy, and with the experience 
 of those who have thoroughly tested the merits of early 
 and late cut hay, that it may be worth an effort to arrest 
 the popular custom. 

Science, has long since incontestably demonstrated that 
 plants in arriving at maturity have large quantities of 
 their starch, sugar and gum — their most nutritive ele- 
 ments — converted into woody fibre, which contains com- 
 paratively very little nutriment. 

Experience has proved that cattle will thrive on hay 
 cut before the seeds were formed, while the same cattle 
 when fed on larger quantities of the same kind of hay, 
 but cut after the seeds were ripe, required the addition 
 of grain to "keep them up." 

Again: AVhen the experiments of making sugar from 
 corn stalks were being tried some years ago, it was found 
 that to retain the sacharine matter in the stalks, the 
 ear shoots had to be stripped off as soon as they 
 made their appearance, as they became worthless. The 
 moment the ears or seed commenced forming, the starch, 
 gum and sugar left the stalk and became concentrated in 
 the grain, and of course the stalks, to the sugar maker, 

were valueless. This observation and reason has taught 
 man. The instinct of animals — an unerring guide as to 
 what is best suited to their wants — leads them to prefer 
 the early to the late cut hay, as every observing farmer 
 is aware. Even when in pasture they invariably leave 
 the ripe stalks and eat only the younger shoots, although 
 they may have to pick it blade by blade, and are com- 
 pelled to be constantly feeding to get a sufficient quan- 
 tity, while the ripe grass stands thick, affording abun- 
 dance in quantity. 

The proper time to cut grass, I repeat, is when the 
 heads begin to bloom. It will not make as much hay, but 
 an acre thus cut is much more nutritious, and will go 
 much farther in keeping stock than if left for the seeds 
 to ripen. Any one who will ti-y this experiment will 
 never again leave it to ripen, although by so doing he 
 may save himself some trouble in the making. J. G.

The Dignity of Labor. 

In the earliest times the occupation of the husband- 
 man was held in honor, not only for the profit which it 
 brought, but from the circumstance that it was support- 
 ed and protected by the fundamental laws of the State. 
 All who were not set apart for religious duties, such as 
 the priests and the Levitcs, whether inhabitants of the 
 country or of the towns and cities, were considered by 
 the laws and were, in fact, agriculturists. The rich and 
 the noble, it is true, in the cultivation of the earth, did 
 not always put themselves on a level with their servants, 
 but none icere so rich or so noble as disdain to put their 
 hands to the plow. 

The esteem in which agriculture was held diminished 
 as luxury increased, but it never wholly came to an end. 
 Even when most of the .Jews had become merchants and 
 mechanics, the esteem and honor attached to this occu- 
 pation still continued, especially under the dynasty of 
 the Romans, who were agriculturists from motives of I'C- 
 ligion. 

The inhabitants of the old world possessed a knowl- 
 edge of agriculture. Man, we are told, was made to 
 dress and till the earth ; Cain was a husbandman, as 
 was also Noah, who, besides, understood the planting of 
 vineyards. Pasturage is an occupation coeval with the 
 birth of man. Adam had domii.ion over cattle. Cain 
 and Noah, in their agricultural pursuits, must have in- 
 cluded pasturage, and Abel seems to have been exclu- 
 sively occupied as a keeper of sheep. From the circum- 
 stance of the early post diluvian patriarchs constantly 
 migrating from place to place, there is good reason to 
 think that pasturage occupied so much of their attention 
 as to form their almost exclusive employment. The 
 golden age of the heathen world was said to be under 
 the government of "shepherd kings," and it may be rea- 
 sonably supposed that in the world before the flood, the 
 same occupation ranked high. In fact we find this dis- 
 tinctly intimated in Scripture. W. H. D.
