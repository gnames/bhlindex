A large number are still indulging in fancied security, 
 and leave their property exposed, -when a few dollars in- 
 vested in conductors would furnish a guarantee of safe- 
 ty better than that of an insurance office. 

These buildings will in a short time contain the pro- 
 ducts of the present year to which hundreds look as a 
 reward for their toils ; forgetting that there is an ele- 
 ment more to be dreaded than the Hessian fly or mildew, 
 and which may in a few moments reduce their all to 
 ashes. This subject is certainly Avorthy of attention, 
 and cannot be too strongly urged on those who have 
 hitherto neglected it. Some, it appears to me, are so 
 regardless of their own interests, that nothing but bitter 
 experience can teach them to guard against these acci- 
 dents which are of such frequent occurrence, and they 
 regret, when it is too late, their want of foresight in not 
 providing against an evil it was in their power to 
 avoid. 

Two wagons, one carriage, probably from twenty to 
 thirty tons of hay, a large quantity of straw, three head 
 of cattle, one horse, and a number of farming utensils, 
 were destroyed in the two barns above mentioned, and 
 no one will for a moment suppose that either the barns 
 or their contents would have been injured had conduc- 
 tors been properly affixed to them. Poor Eichard says, 
 "a stitch in time saves nine," and one dollar well appli- 
 ed in such a case may save a few hundred. J. S. G.

BOOTH'S PATENT GRAIN SEPARATOR AND "WIN- 
 NOWER. 

For Millers. 
 These cuts give a pretty correct idea of the appear- 
 ance of Booth's Patent Grain Separator and Winnower, 
 which have been fully tested for a couple of j-ears, and 
 gained much favor Avith the farmer. They have been 
 awarded a silver medal at the Franklin Institute, Phila- 
 delphia, in 1853, also at tlie Fair of the New York State 1 
 Agricultural Society, and numerous diplomas and pre- \ 
 miums at county fairs. Over a hundred of them are in ' 

operation in the State of New Y'ork, and a number in 
 Philadelphia county. They not only operate with great 
 speed and efficiency for all ordinary uses of other fans, 
 but also separate completely chess, cockle, smut, white 
 heads and other impurities, and also grass seeds and 
 garden seeds. We have a seen a lot of very fair clover 
 seed put through it, and were surprised at the quantity 
 of refuse stuff which was separated. 

The selves, five in number, have not the shake side- 
 ways, as is customary, but are jogged in front by a cam 
 on the shaft of the driving wheel. The draft of air is 
 made from below through an air tight trunk, and can be 
 increased or diminished with tlie greatest facility. 

The cleaned seed or grain falls into a receiver at the 
 bottom, which can be graduated to be used as a measu- 
 rer. We annex one of the many recommendations which 
 might be given, and add that the machine may be ob- 
 tained of Paschall Morris and Co., corner of 7th and 
 Market streets, or David Landreth, 23 South Sixth st., 
 who are agents in Philadelphia: 

Messrs. Slai'SON & David : — I had the present sea- 
 son a lot of wheat of good quality, but so dirty with 
 smut that the miller to whom I took a sample (which 
 had been run twice through one of Grant's Fans) de- 
 clined taking it on any terms. I then obtained the use 
 of "J. L. Booth's Grain Separator and Winnower," for a 
 short time. Between the hours of 10^ A. M. and 6 P. 
 M., we ran twice through this machine 140 bushels of 
 grain, from which the chaff had been fii'st cleaned by 
 running once through Bamborough's Fan. (Seven 
 bushels of smut were taken out the first time through.") 
 By tlus means were obtained eight bushels of sn^ut, light 
 grains, &c., and 132 bushels of clear wheat; for which 
 the miller above referred to now paid the highest market 
 price. From the time spent in cleaning this grain, I 
 should estimate the average speed of the machine in 
 question at sixty bushels per hour. SAML. MORRIS.

Young Animals. 
 Young animals should be kept growing until they reach 
 maturity. If they are sufTered to got poor and stop grow- 
 ing, they will retrograde and never attain a full size ; and 
 without grain, or something better than hay, it is next to 
 impossible to keep them in that condition, ecpeciall}' the first 
 winter.
