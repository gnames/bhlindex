I observe there is hardly any thing in the Journal

 art of bee keeping, would occasionally occupy a column

Crueaon's System, James Gowen and Agricultural So- 
 ciety. 

Mr. Editor : — It is not that I am emulous to have the 
 last word in the tete-a-tete, or rather the head and tail con- 
 troversy with your correspondent "Science," that I again 
 trouble you, but that I am unwilling that Guenoii's foolish 
 system should acquire any degree of credit, in Pennsylvania 
 at least, through the ignorance imputed to me by your cor- 
 respondent; for if, as alledged, I be ignorant .as to the princi- 
 ples and history of Guenon's discovery, it would follow that 
 my objecting to the system should go for nothing. But I 
 submit whether this mode of upholding the system is strict- 
 ly fair, for from my former articles on the subject, it is pre- 
 sumable that you and your readers must be convinced that I 
 knew what I was writing about. 

It will be recollected that I intimated to "Science," that 
 in proof of his "facts, undisputed history, and of learned 
 societies iu France having subjected the system to the se- 
 verest tests," he should have designated those societies, and 
 given the places where the savans experimented ; instead, 
 however, of enlightening me upon these matters, he unchar- 
 itably leaves me to my ignorance, and felicitates himself 
 upon having been right from the beginning in thinking that 
 I was not properly versed in the sublime mysteries of Gu- 
 enonism ; and, because I hinted at the propriety of such 
 proofs, it seemed to my amiable friend "Science" that I was 
 not posted up in his facts, which caused him to excbaim : — 
 "This (my ignorance I suppose) is indeed astonishing, and 
 boems to prove what I before thought, that Mr. Gowen has 
 not even read Guenon's book, to say nothing about making 
 himself master of the system." He further adds, "I have 
 never yet seen an edition of Guenon which does not contain 
 the very certificates and endorsements of the learned socie- 
 ties I alluded to, with localities, mode of examination, award 
 of premiums to Guenon for his discovery and all about it." 

By way of excuse for my apparent dullness, permit me to 
 refer to Nefflin's edition of Guenon, the Simon Pure, Ortho- 
 dox, Coke upon Littleton Treatise, published in Philadel- 
 phia, ISS.*?, to which is prefixed the "perfectly rer/ulo.r" re- 
 port of a committee of the Philadelphia Society for Promo- 
 ting Agriculture, certifying the infallibility of Guenon's 
 system. Now in this edition, under seal as it were of the 
 Philadelphia Agricultural Society, there are no certificates 
 or endorsements of learned societies or undisputed history, 
 except it be the history of John Nefflin's agricultural quali- 
 fications, which I do not mean to dispute, and 3'et my friend 
 "Science" says he never saw an edition of Guenon which did 
 not contain the endorsements of learned societies of France, 
 with other testimonials in favor of Guenon. How can the 
 discrcpant^y between us be reconciled? In no other way I 
 imagine than by supposing there has been a second edition, 
 with additions^ of Nefflin's tran-slation published, and that I 
 being behind the times have not road this second edition 
 with additions, while my progressive friend "Science" has 
 it all at his finger ends. If this be so, his holding on to the 
 last, and I to the first edition, may be taken as a curious co- 
 incidence of our relative positions in another aspect of the 

case, for while I t;vke hold of the bull by the horns, ho 
 clutches the animal by the tail — which is the more perilous 
 position it would not be difficult to say, nevertheless it is 
 more to my taste to run the risk of a toss, than a hick with 
 other unmentionable accompaniments. 

As it is important to establish my knowledge in mirrorism 
 on a basis as solid as the foundation on which "Science" pre- 
 dicates his high opinion of my erudition in other respects, I 
 presume to tell him that I am not so deficient in Guenon lore as 
 he supposes me to be, for I have studied Consul Trist's transla- 
 tion of Guenon, and examined with some care the certificates 
 made by the committees of the societies of Bourdeaux and Au- 
 rillac, and if these committees represent the "learned socie- 
 ties of France" alluded to, I can perceive nothing in them 
 to respect beyond the pretensions of the Philadelphia So- 
 ciety's Committee, other than that of Bourdeaux having a 
 horse doctor, yclept a veterinary surgeon, for chairman, 
 and the Aurillac committee a nobleman of the Count grade 
 at its head ; two points of difference which, if the Philadel- 
 phia Society had been hard pressed, could easily have been 
 reconciled and matched, for as the immortal Sam Patch said, 
 "some things can be done as well as others." Considering 
 then the extent of my reading, and the profoundness of my 
 research in the mysteries of Guenon, and which might en- 
 title me to a professorship in tailology, I may ask was it 
 reasonable in "Science" to deny to me a fair measure of ex- 
 perience in escutcheons and mirrors, so as to weaken the 
 force of all the good things I have said or sung ag.ainst the 
 discovery ? Moreover, after all, the escutcheons are not so 
 incomprehensible, but that any one might master them, 
 maugre their susceptibility of being taken for either a moun- 
 tain or a mole hill, agreeably to the fancy or desire of the 
 explorer. The simplest cow boy might in a week compre- 
 hend them so as to demonstrate the "orders and classes" of 
 mirrorism as clearly as the most astute savan of France, or 
 even "Science" himself, could or can explain them, but it 
 would be a shocking waste of time in the boy to employ 
 himself upon a matter so utterly nonsensical and useless; as 
 well might he spend his time in counting the hairs on the 
 end of the cow's tail, or noting the curves of hairs on her 
 shoulders and flctnke, as in tracing the "hairs that turn up- 
 wards and downwards" under the tail in the region of the 
 escutcheons, by way of eliciting information as to the milk- 
 ing properties of the animal — the one pursuit would be 
 about as rational and sane as the other. 

A word as to the attempt made to show that I misstat;ed 
 the proceedings of the Philadelphia Society for Promoting 
 Agriculture in the matter of Guenon's discovery. Had it 
 not been for the great regard I had, <and ever have cherish- 
 ed for the practical character and soundness of the Society's 
 opinions and views relating to the theory and practice of 
 agriculture, I should not have entered upon a discussion 
 with "Science" on the merits of mirrorism. It pained me 
 to see the society's unqualified endorsement of such a whim 
 as Guenon's system, placed so prominently before the public 
 as a prefix or passport to the pictures and stuff contained in 
 Nefflin's pamphlet on Guenon. Holding, as it is well known 
 I did, so low an opinion of the system, I felt constrained to 
 weaken the force of the committee, by way of absolving tho 
 society, to some extent, from the responsible position it had 
 been made to assume upon a matter so very questionable; in 
 furtherance of which, in all sincerity, and according to my 
 recollection of the proceedings, I stated that I refused to 
 appoint the committee, and instanced irregularities touching, 
 the action of the committee. In your last number, under 
 the caption, "Extracts from the proceedings of the Philadel- 
 phia Society for Promoting Agriculture," is a lengthy detail 
 of sayings and doings by individual members at the stated
