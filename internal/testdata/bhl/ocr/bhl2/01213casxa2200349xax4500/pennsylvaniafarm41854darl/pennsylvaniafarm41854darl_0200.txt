[Juke 

meeting of last month, the purport and object of which 
 i<cemofl to be, to affirm the regularity of the action of the 
 society ami committee in the Guonon affair, and to discredit 
 what I said in regard to them. So far as I am concerned, 
 this unique proceeding affects me less, porsonallj-, than as a 
 member of the old society, for, us a member, it moves me to 
 witness the pains taken to make it minister to the promul- 
 gating of such doctrines as are set forth in the Guenon dis- 
 cover}', and to confirm the society's faith in the silly and ab- 
 surd tests of "escutcheons and mirrors," as is declared and 
 embodied in the report of the committee, affirmed to be 
 perfectly regular in every respect by a resolution unani- 
 moxisly carried, as appears by the extnicts referred to. Thus 
 then, "The Philadelphia Society for Promoting Agriculture" 
 Stands gravely, deliberately and officially, in the eyes of 
 every intelligent agriculturist at home and abroad, sponsor 
 and endorser of Guenon's system, and, as such, will be held 
 accountable for whatever evil the false testa or standards 
 may exert upon the interests of agriculture — to this com- 
 plexion has the society come. No blame can attach to me, 
 be the consequences what they may, for I did every thing in 
 my power to prevent the society assuming such an atti- 
 tude. 

The exception taken to my statement of the proceedings 
 is, that the report was read, while I stated "without the re- 
 port having been read, the committee had authority to give 
 such direction to the report as it thought proper;" this is the 
 point in dispute, for it is conceded that I refused to appoint 
 a committee. The minute relating to this point in the pro- 
 ceedings of the meeting of the first of .January, when an 
 election for officers took place, reads, "that the committee 
 (on Guenon) made (not read) a report through their chair- 
 man. Dr. A. L. Elwyn, Ac, &c. Now on fair presumption, 
 considering the strong and decided endorsement of Guenon's 
 tests, as appears in the report published, with its obvious in- 
 formality, of being signed by individuals not on the com- 
 mittee, and by less than a majority of the committee proper, 
 is it probable that with all these awakening circumstances on 
 its face, that, if read, there was no member present to protest 
 against such a report being either approved or published? A 
 re port of a committee may be made verballj-, or may be made 
 referring to a written report under preparation, or in hand, 
 and in such manner, to the best of my recollection, and I 
 have an excellent memory, was the report in question made. 
 There is one circumstance alone, connected with the report, 
 which at present I do not choose to mention, that had the 
 report been read could not have failed to have elicited my 
 strenuous opposition to its being .approved or published. I 
 need hardly repeat that I did not appoint the committee, 
 while it may he proper to give the following extracts from 
 the minutes of the December meeting, 1852, thus: "Dr. A. 
 L. Elwyn proposed that a committee be appointed for the 
 purpose of making inquiry into the principles contained in 
 Guenon's work on milch cows, and on motion the following 
 gentlemen were appointed (by the meeting), viz : Dr. A. L. 
 Elwyn, Samuel C. Ford, Isaac W. Roberts, Samuel Cooper, 
 Casper W. Sharpless, Samuel Williams, Dr. J. A. McCrea 
 and Isaac Newton," eight in all. The manner of appointing 
 this committee was irregular, so far as usage goes, for the 
 President invariably appoints, but as I refused to appoint, 
 the meeting was competent to perform that act. It may be 
 asked, can a report, published as the act of a society, be va- 
 lid or regular without being attested by the secretary ? 
 There is no such attest-ation to the report published. But 
 this is a trifling irregularity compared to the faet that a ma- 
 jority of the committee, the eight .appointed, did not sign 
 the report, while the report exhibit.s a majority by two ex- 
 traneous names being added to it, without the color of au- 

thority for such a proceeding. Under these circumstances, 
 does not the resolution passed at the last meeting of the so- 
 ciety, affirming that the proceedings in the matter of the 
 Guenon committee were "perfectly regular," prove too 
 much. 

The only satisfaction, Mr. Editor, that this review of the 
 matter affords to me is, that you and your readers will per- 
 ceive that I refused to appoint the committee, as before 
 stated, and that so many of the committee appointed by the 
 meeting, among whom are some of the most intelligent 
 members and best judges of cattle in the country, kept their 
 hands clean of giving currency to Guenon's discovery, all of 
 which tend to show that the society's endorsement is not of 
 such potency in establishing the doctrine of mirrorism, as 
 the disciples of Guenon would fain represent it to be. 

Respectfully yours, JAMES GOWEN.

 MANUEE. 

The subject of manure is certainly one of unlimited im- 
 portance to every farmer. It is admitted at leiist by common 
 consent to be the foundation of agricultural prosperity. Its 
 acknowledged importiince in successful farming is so great 
 that the most untiring investigations of science are directed 
 to it. Our cities and villages increase so rapidly in popula- 
 tion, and draw so constantly from the soil its most precious 
 constituents of human food and clothing, that unless we are 
 on the alert in adopting the principle of restoring to the soil 
 as much potash, phosphorous, sulphur, chlorine and ammo- 
 nia as we take from it, at no distant day it must of necessity 
 become too sterile for profitable cultivation. Now, instead 
 of impoverishing the earth, a sound public policy demands 
 that we should rather increase its natural fruitfulness in or- 
 der to meet the increasing wants of an ever augmenting 
 population. How to achieve this result in the most econom- 
 ical manner should be the study of every agriculturist. 

The best way to impart the high degree of fertility to any 
 given area of earth is a problem often very difficult of solu- 
 tion. In many cases a little gypsum scattered broadcast 
 over a clover field operates like magic ; in others this fertili- 
 zer produces no effect whatever. The same is true of lime, 
 salt and potash, but compound fertilizers, as guano and 
 stable manure, seldom, if ever, fail to improve the produc- 
 tiveness of land for one or more crops. 

The reason of this difference is obvious, while lime adds 
 to the soil only one element, the excrements of animals ap- 
 plied to it contain not only lime, but some twelve or more 
 other ingredients, equally necessary to the cultivation of 
 plants, which shows its great value as a fertilizer. Now, 
 unless a part of anything is equal to the whole, the excre- 
 ments of animals, or of human species, must ever be more 
 reliable to increase the earth's productiveness than any one, 
 two or three simple elementary bodies, consumed in the for- 
 mation of the crops. 

Although much has been written on agricultural chemis- 
 try by venerated names both in Europe and America, still it 
 is clear that one of the best general fertilizers — one on 
 which every farmer may with the most unwavering safety 
 depend — is barnyard manure. There lies his pearl of great 
 price — there his mine of wealth. 

Experience teaches us that the farmer who uses proper 
 efforts to accumulate it, discretion in preserving it, and 
 withall proper economy and judgment in its application, is 
 on the highway to wealth and prosperity, and may soon en- 
 joy the appellation of the nobility of America — nobility con- 
 stituted by their skill with the plow, and their success in 
 making bread for the million. It then becomes a matter of
