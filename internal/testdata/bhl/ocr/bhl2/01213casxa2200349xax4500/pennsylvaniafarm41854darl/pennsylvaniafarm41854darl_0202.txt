Falling us rain, it brings to the roots of planU^, as food, what- 
 ever impurities the air contains ; and then, after sinking 
 deep in the earth, it is drawn back by capillary attraction, 
 bringing with it such salts as it may have found and dis- 
 solved by the way. 

The free passage of the air through the soil is almost as 
 important as that of water. These considerations are wor- 
 thy of the attentive study of the practical farmer. They 
 teach him how to prepare his lands for crops. There must 
 be in the soil that which the plant requires ; and not only 
 ."0, but it must be brought within the reach of the plant. 
 Water and air are the plant's travelling agents. They must 
 have free course; and to this end, the soil must be deeply 
 mellowed. It would not be extravagant to say, that after 
 having manured your soil the best you can, you have not 
 put within the reach of plant-roots all that they require; 
 that still food is to be brought to them all the way from far 
 above the surface of the field to far below it, and that water 
 and air are the carriers. 

There is hardly a more important principle in agriculture 
 than the one I have now endeavored to illustrate — that of 
 deepl.y jdowing and finely pulverizing the soil. A caution 
 is, however, here necessary. Sujipose a field has hitherto 
 been skimmed over to a depth of only five inches. Just at 
 the termination of these five inches is what be denominated 
 the plow-floor — that stratum of earth on which the plow hag 
 always run, about as hard as a cart-path. Above this is a 
 thin and exhausted soil. All below is hard, impenetrable 
 by the roots of plants, and almost impervions to water. 

If now the })low be put down to twice the depth before 
 reached, and the whole ten inches inverted, it is manifest 
 that the surface will be made up of soil that never saw the 
 light before ; and that the original top-soil will be buried at 
 too great a depth. It would seem to be a safer course to 
 lower the furrow one inch a year till the requisite depth were 
 reached. In this ease, the change would be less violent; the 
 upper and lower soils would bo perfectly mixed, and the 
 whole would be thoroughly pulverized. 

Nothing is better established than the benefit of mixing 
 unlike soils; as peaty with sandy or with clayey soils; or 
 swamp muck with any soil essentially unlike it. Now, 
 wherever the soil is different from the surface, this gradual 
 deepening of the furrow enables us to mix soils without the 
 labor of tj-ansportatJon. The farmer should carefully mark 
 the effect. If good, he shonld continue the practice. If 
 bad, he should investigate the cause. It might be owing to 
 protoxide of iron in the subsoil. Should the subsoil be of a 
 sickly j-ellow, when first turned up, but afterwards turn to a 
 reddish brown, ho might conclude that such is the case ; and 
 he might then add to the soil a little lime, or a compost con- 
 taining it, and continue the process of deepening his soil; or 
 should he deepen his furrows very gradually, this protoxide 
 of iron would cease to be hurtful, merely by exposure to the 
 air. 

A deeply cultivated soil — one properly amended, if not 
 originally good and well manured, is a laboratory in opera- 
 tion — at work for the owner's benefit. By moans of the sili- 
 ca and alumina, its chief ingredients, it aff"ords a safe an 
 chorage for his plants; its salts and organic matter supply 
 them food ; and more than this, it is at work, drawing other 
 food from above and below. The subsoil sends up its treas 
 ures, and the plaj-ful breezes pay it their contributions as 
 they pass. 

Such a soil, one perfected by dilligence and skill, is in al- 
 liance with the silent and often unobserved but mighty pow- 
 ers of nature, for the farmer's good. It gathers from above 
 and below for his benefit. It subsidizes the powers of na- 
 ture in his behalf. It is thus that the God of nature rewards 

diligence and skill ; thus that He verifies his own truth, that 
 ' the hand of the dilligent maketh rich." 

For the Farm Journal, i 
 PENNSYLVANIA FARM SCHOOL, 

Mu. EniTOu : — ^llnder this caption in the last number of 
 the Farm .lournal, you give "extracts" as from the minutes 
 of the Philadelphia Society for Promoting Agriculture, in 
 reference to the initial of the Pennsylvania State Agricultu- 
 ral Society, and its bearing upon the Farmers' High School; 
 and, as a "matter of history," accredit the paternity of those 
 institutions to certain individuals, or rather, the extracts 
 confer that honor, almost exclusively, on one of them. But 
 I must be allowed to say that these extracts are, in spirit 
 and letter, neither just nor generous, leading as they do to 
 inferences not in accordance with facts, aiul therefore should 
 not be received as "matter of history." If credit should bo 
 given to those who first recommended or originated the idea 
 of a State Agricultural Society, "the motion of Dr. Elwyn 
 in 1845," was not, as the extracts would imply, the first 
 movement in this regard by half a century in point of time ; 
 for, in 1794, the Philadelphia Society appointed specially a 
 committee "to prepare outlines of a plan for establishing a 
 State Society, for the promotion of agriculture, connecting 
 with it the education of youth in the knowledge of that most 
 important art, while they are acquiring other useful knowl- 
 edge suitable for the agricultural citizens of the State. And 
 a petition to the Legislature with a view to obtain an act of 
 incorporation." This committee at a special meeting of the 
 Society, Jan. 28th, 1794, makes report, and presents a peti- 
 tion to the Legislature for an act of incorporation, together 
 with outlines of a plan for estitblishing a State Societj- for 
 the promotion of agriculture. The petition reads : "That 
 finding the important object of their association not to be 
 sufficiently attained on the limited plan, and by the means 
 hitherto pursued, they are desirous of promoting an estab- 
 lishment on a broad and permanent basis, which may afford 
 more certain prospects of advancing the interests of agri- 
 culture. They also conceive that the acquiring knowledge 
 of it may be combined with the education which is practica- 
 ble and moat useful /or the great body of citizenn, &c., &c." 
 "Signed by order and on behalf of the Society." John B. 
 Bordley, George Clymer, Timothy Pickering, Richard Peters. 
 "The outlines of a plan" to carry this institution into effect 
 are admirable, but too lengthy to be copied here ; thej' can 
 be found in the first volume of the Society's Transactions — 
 so much for the priority of action in behalf of a State So- 
 ciety connected with agricultural education. It seems to 
 me hardly possible that any one having the least regard for 
 the truth of history in this matter, could have attempted, 
 through the columns of the Farm Journal, to deprive the 
 old Society and the patriotic men that managed its concerns 
 some sixty years ago, of the credit of originating a State 
 Agricultural Society, in connection with agricultural educa- 
 tion. I am sure whoever was so blind or foolish as to furnish 
 the Journal with the "extracts," purporting to be "a matter 
 of history," could have been no friend to Dr. Elwyn. 

But let us follow the impartial "extracts as matter of his- 
 tory," which show, that Nov. 1st, 1848, on motion of Dr. 
 Elwyn, a committee of five was appointed for the purpose of 
 conferring with the Agricultural Society of Bucks county, 
 and all those of adjoining counties, with a view of giving 
 greater force and effect to the operations of the different 
 societies in their efforts to promote the cause of agricultural 
 improvement." What effect or force this operation had or 
 was intended to have, in favor of a State Societj' and Farm 
 School, is not stated ; until (I quote from the extracts) "Jan. 
 3d, 1849. — The committee appointed to confer with the
