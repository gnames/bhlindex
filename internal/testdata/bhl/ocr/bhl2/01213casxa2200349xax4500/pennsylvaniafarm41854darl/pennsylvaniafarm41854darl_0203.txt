Lucks Cuunfy Society reported having met and agreed to 
 appoint' a coinmitt-ee to confer with gentlemen in other coun- 
 ties on the subject of a State Agricultural vSocietj', and to 
 meet again Jan. 6th, 1849." "At this postponed meeting 
 very little appears to have been done, (as might have been 
 expected,) and the subject rested till the 5th of Dec, 1849, 
 ■when the President of the Society. Dr. Elwyn, appointed a 
 committee to take measures towards the formation of a State 
 Society, as follows: Messrs. Gowen, A. S. Roberts, J. P. 
 Wetlier- 1, J. C. Ford, Robert Hare, to which Dr. Elwyu's 
 name was afterwards added." There is a sad hiatus and 
 jumbling in the "matter of history" in this part of the ro- 
 cord.s, for surely it was not regular in the President to ap- 
 point a committee on any special matter, unless a reaolutioit 
 or motivn to that effect hrtd been previouxly made and citm'cd. 
 It is clear that Dr. Elwyn could not have made the motion, 
 and it is equally as plain that he could not have appointed 
 the committee without the motion had been made and car- 
 ried. Then who made it? Somebody must have made it, 
 yet the "extracts" are silent as to who that somebody was, 
 leaving the making or offering of the resolution, for a com- 
 mittee of five, to the agency of that universally mischievous 
 i;np, nobody ! Whether nobody or somebody offered the 
 resolutions "to take measures for the formation of a St;ite 
 Agricultural Society," I do know that it was made, and 
 remember well the opposition it met with in its passage — 
 don't the reporter of the "extracts" and every member re- 
 (Hilleot that? For never in all my experience have I seen 
 anything so warmly contested in the Society's rooms as that 
 resolution was ; the matter of the "escutcheons and mirrors" 
 was not a circumstance to it. How unaccountably oblivious, 
 Mr. Editor, your matter of history is, in regard to him that 
 offered and carried through that resolution ; the very begin- 
 ning of anj- thing since 1794 that held out hope, promise or 
 determination towards a t-riumphant result. This is not all 
 that we are made to wonder at in these remarkable extracts, 
 fur it appejirs from them, that in "Feb. 6th, 1850, the above 
 committee was continued, and an address prepared by Dr. 
 Elwyn to the farmers of Pennsylvania was read by Mr. 
 Freas, tvaiX pluccd in the hands of the ch"inna)i, Mr. Goicen." 
 "March 6th. — Mr. Gowen read an address which was after- 
 wards published, <tc." 

Tliese extract~s are quoted literally from the Miiy number 
 of the Farm Journal, see page 1.38. Now let any candid 
 man say what impression do the extracts convey, or were 
 made or intended to convey, as to the history of the forma- 
 tion of the Pennsylvania State Agricultural Society and 
 Farmers' High School ? AVhy nothing less than a, partial 
 and highly erroneous one. A word as to the address said to 
 bd prepared by Dr. Elwyn, "and ])laced in my hands as 
 chairman," and of my reading an address afterwards which 
 was published. If it be intended by the report of the "ex- 
 tracts" to convey the idea that the address read by mo, and 
 published, was not of my own preparing, but Dr. Elwyn's, 
 or that I made up mine from his, I must say that such an in- 
 sinuation is so unjust, and withal so petty a piece of disin- 
 genuousness, as to entitle it to more of my pity than my re- 
 sentment. The truth is, I was not present at the meeting of 
 ths 6th of February, wlien, !is is said. Dr. Elwyn's address 
 was placed in my hands, as no doubt the minutes of this 
 meeting will show; nor was I even in the city on that day, 
 for my diary reminds me, that on that day "I stayed at 
 home to superintend the filling of my ice house.'' It re- 
 quires no effort of mine at this day (beyond that which is 
 enjoined upon every man as a duty to himself and the com- 
 munity, in not t.:icitly submitting to a wrong meditated I 
 against his principles or position.) to place myself in a pro- 
 per attitude before the intelligeat farmo.-s of Pennsylvanin, ' 

relative to my exertions in furtherance of the establishment 
 of the Pennsylvania Stat* Agricultural Societj', for I have 
 long since realised the import of the old proverb that "good 
 wine needs no bush." There is one of my fellow membeiV 
 named in this connection, that to his credit may it bespoken 
 has luckily escaped a prominent place on the record of the 
 "extracts as a matter of history ;" I allude to A. S. Roberts, 
 whose efforts wore neither few nor unavailing in canvassing, 
 and circulating the address that mainly raised the dormant 
 tsnergies of our farmers, and convoked that noble and never 
 to bo forgotten convention held at llarrisburg, on the third 
 Tuesday in January, 1851, and which resulted in the fornui- 
 tion of the State Agricultural Society. The assistance ren- 
 dered by Mr. Roberts was, in the highest degree, creditable 
 to himself and beneficial to the cause — success to him for 
 it! 

Aj to agricultural education, it is well known that sonie 
 years ago I made a strenuous effort to establish an Agricul- 
 tural College at my beautiful place, at Mount Airy, but it 
 proved a mortifying failure. In regard to the State College, 
 or "Farmers' High School," the most efiicient suggestion, or 
 movement of modern times, came from the best quarter 
 possible, through the Hon. A. llussel, when Secretary of the 
 Commonwealth, in his official comuion school report, where- 
 in he recommended the endowment of an Agricultural Col- 
 lege. \umerous pertinent articles by private individuals, 
 published in the first volume of the Farm Journal, followed 
 Mr. Russel's lead, which told well on the public mind. At 
 the annual meeting of the State Society in '53, A. S. Rob- 
 erts, as chairman of the committee on an agricultural school, 
 made a report in favor of such an institution. The present 
 E.xecutive, Governor Bigler, in his last annual message took 
 occasion to impress upon the Legislature the expedienc}- of 
 agricultural education, for which he is entitled to the thanks 
 of every right minded farmer. And last, not least, the late 
 lamented Elliot Cresson bequeathed to the Pennsylvania 
 State Agricultural Society the sum of five thousand dollars, 
 for the use of an Agricultural College in Pennsylvania. Fi- 
 u.ally, the Legislature granted a charter for such an institu- 
 tion, under the name and title of "The Farmers' High 
 School of Pennsylvania;" but our worthy Representatives 
 forgot to endow it with the funds necessary for its su]>port, 
 though I have no doubt but this neglect will be remedied by 
 the next Legislature. "We shall see if it don't.

A Public Benefactor, 
 He is a public benefactor who, liy the prudent and skilful 
 outlay of his money in bettering its condition, shall make a 
 single field yield pcrmanentlj' a double crop ; and he who 
 does this over a square mile, virtually adds a square mile to 
 the national territory — nay, he does more, he doubles to this 
 e.xtcnt the territorial resources of the country, without giv- 
 ing the State any larger actual area to defend. All hail, 
 then, to the improvers of the soil! health and long life be 
 their fortune — may their hearts be light and their purses 
 heavy — may their dreams be few and pleasant, and their 
 sleep the sweet repose of the weary — may they see the fruits 
 of their own labor, and may their sons reap .-till heavier 
 harvests. — Blaekwood' h Jfai/azine.
