earth, suitable for the growth of cucucibor.-'. IMaiit your 
 seed midway between the edjjes of the barrel and the keg, 
 and make a kind of arbor a foot or two hi;^h for the vines to 
 run on. AVhen the ground becomes dry, pour water in the 
 keg in the evening — it will pass out at the bottom of the keg 
 into the barrel and rise up to the roots of the vines, and 
 keep them moist and green. Cucumbers cultivated in this 
 way will grow to a great si/.e, as they are made independent 
 both of drought and wet weather. In wet weather the bar- 
 rel can be covered, and in dry the ground can be kept moist 
 by pouring wat«r in the keg. 

ROSE PILLARS. 

Wc have had the above engraving made with the view 
 of showing a very simple and beautiful mode of growing 
 climbing roses. A simple post, twelve feet long, so as to 
 be about ten feet out of the ground, and having holes in 
 both directions about six inches apart, through which 
 tlic stem must be trained, will in a verj' short time make 
 a perfect pillar of roses, and be one of the greatest or- 
 r.amonts of the lawn or garden. If of chesnut or cedar 
 it will last for many years. 

The main stems of the roses thus support themselves, 
 and a little attention, by the aid of a light step ladder, 
 ia training them through the holes at first will dispense 
 with much care afterwards. With some of the thrifty 
 .'^rowing noisettes, constant bloomers, the entire post is 
 soon concealed under a covering of roses. A profusion 
 of bloom may be still further promoted by keeping 
 .shortened-in all straggling branches. 

A dozen or more of these rose pillars, properly ar- 
 ranged, and with all the striking contrast of colors, from 
 the deep scarlet and intermediate shades down to the 
 pure white, would at all times be a conspicuous and at- 
 ti-active object. Cedar trees of small size, by having 
 their branches shortened about one foot long, and plant- 
 ed for this purpose, also make an excellent support, but 
 require more attention to keep tied up than the simple 
 posts.

Culture of Roses. 
 To the Editor of the Farm Journal : — Can you inform 
 one of the constant readers of your valuable Journal, 

any thing about the cultui-e and management of roses. 
 I am ail enthusiastic admirer of them, and endeavor to 
 have a few of the fine kinds always in bloom in my win- 
 dow or small garden, and whenever I see a tine bloomei 
 along our markets, or corners of the streets, purchase 
 and carry it home; but from some cause or other, the 
 buds soon wilt away, the leaves turn yellow, and even 
 after turning it out of the pot and planting it in the bor- 
 der, it does not seem to recover and thrive till towards 
 fall. I avoid the extremes of watering, keep them as 
 much as possible in an even temperature, turn the pots 
 round to the light, apply guano, water, &c., and still am 
 most unfortunate. Thei-e seems no way for me to keep 
 up a succession of blooming roses, but to continue buy- 
 ing all the time, and throw them away whenever they 
 begin to droop or lose their buds. If there i.s any se- 
 cret in the matter will you inform me what I can do. 

JULIA. 
 [We suspect the difficulty arises from buying plants 
 which have been forced and kept in flower through the 
 winter, as is the case with many, and perhaps most of 
 those offered for sale in the streets of Philadelphia. 
 Plants must have a season of comparative rest. In the 
 city green houses, roses are re(|uired for bouquets, and 
 they are kept in a very different and much warmer tem- 
 perature than that they are introduced into when sold. 
 It is this sudden change of temperature which causes them 
 to lose their leaves and decay. The fault is not so much 
 with the vendors as with the purchasers. The latter 
 will not buy unless plants are in jloxver, and of course 
 the forcing process has to be resorted to, to make them 
 saleable early in the spring. Hoses that have been kept 
 blooming all or great part of the winter cannot be ex- 
 pected also to keep blooming all summer. We greatly 
 prefer such as have been kept dormant through the win- 
 ter in a cold house, and if our fair correspondent would 
 visit the green houses and enquire for such, she would 
 have better success. — En.] 

Mulching Trees. 

We cannot too earnestly or too often call attention to 
 the necessity of mulching all newly planted trees, vines, 
 roses, &c. (]are in this particular is becoming almost 
 as indispensable as skillful planting. It is the only 
 safeguard against our increasingly variable climate, the 
 frequent extremes of which from warm to cold and from 
 wet to dry, and vice versa, induces a diseased condition 
 of the sap vessels, gives a sudden check to its circula- 
 tion, and we believe is very often the cause of blight in 
 the pear and diseases in other trees. The instinct which 
 prompts insects to prey upon all forms of diseased or 
 decaying vegetable life is often shown in this way, and 
 is considered the source of injury to the tree, while it is 
 really sometimes a mere effect from the other cause. 

Mulching is merely covering the ground under the tree 
 or plant, according to its size, from a circle of one foot 
 to perhaps three or four feet, with half decayed manure, 
 partly decomposed chip dirt from the woodshed, leaf 
 mould, hay or straw, to shade the soil and preserve an 
 even temperature about the roots. The soil under this 
 covering will be observed to be always damp by the pre- 
 vention of evaporation. If manure is used it will also 
 be carried down rapidly by rains, thus keeping the tree
