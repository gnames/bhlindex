in a vigorous growing state. Mulching does away wltli 
 the necessity of fre({uent watering. In a dry spell of 
 weather we have known newly planted trees and shrubs 
 kept literally drenched daily with buckets of water. If 
 the poor subject shows yellow leaves and other symp- 
 toms of disease, it is thought an indication of requiring 
 more drenching. Hj'dropathy is again administered in 
 increased quantities, till life is at last actually drowned 
 out. The nurseryman then comes in frequently for the 
 whole responsibility of having sold an unhealthy ti-ee. 
 And few there are, having planting to do, who under- 
 stand its true philosophy and modus operandi ; how few 
 x'eflect, when disappointed in not having fruit or shade 
 as soon as they expected, that the skilful propagation. 

plantmg and management of a tree requires the nicest 
 and most dextrous appliances of both scientific and 
 practical study, that its growth from a small seed to its 
 full size for removal and afterwards requires care, anxi- 
 ety and close attention for years, and that while its pro- 
 gress is more interesting and beautitul than any handi- 
 work of the manufacturer or mechanic, it requires at 
 least no le.ts patient industry and skilful treatment to 
 bring about the desired resiilt. 

We recommend every one having an acre of ground, 
 in addition to regular periodicals like the Farm Journal, 
 to possess one or more of the many works on the man- 
 agement of fruit and other trees, ornamental grounds 
 and shrubbery.

SFANGLED SHANGHAI COCK. 

This splendid bird weighs lOJ pounds, and is owned 
 by J. Dorwart, Lancaster, Pa. The breed is valuable 
 on account of their laying qualities. They feather 
 sooner than the other colors, being in full plumage at 

two months old. The pullets lay from forty to eighty 
 eggs before inclining to set, beginning at the age of six 
 months. Mr. Dorwart has bestowed great attention Xo 
 his unsurpassed stock of fowls. 

Curculio Remedy. 
 We see it sUited that a Mr. Mathews, of Coshocton, 
 Ohio, has discovered what he claims to be an infallible 
 remedy for the curculio, but he has determined to sub- 
 mit it to no one till he has received "the favorable re- 
 port of at least three horticultural committees, composed 
 of men in whose skill and integrity the public will have 
 the gieatest confidence," and that afterwards he wi 1 

communicate the discovery, with specific printed instruc- 
 tions, whenever he has received from horticultural com- 
 mittees or individuals, offers of rewards, which, in the 
 aggregate, shall amount to such sum as he may think a 
 sufficient remuneration for his trouble, or if the Legisla- 
 tures of one or more States will make satisfactory ap- 
 propriations, he will make the remedy public for the 
 benefit of every body.
