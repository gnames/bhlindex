If a real remedy foi' the curculio, as cheap and effi- 
 cacious as the remedy for musquitoes, which consisted 
 of first catching and then extracting the sting, has been 
 discovered, it will be a valuable discovery and worth 
 paying handsomel3' for. The curculio at present seems 
 to do away with the occasion for planting plum trees, 
 c>specially the finer varieties. There is no probability of 
 obtaining any fruit. Requests have been made that 
 committees of three be appointed by the Boston Horti- 
 cultural Society, the New York State Agricultural Socie- 
 ty, and the Onondaga County Agricultural Society, to 
 examine and report its effects on the crops of plums the 
 present season. We shall hope for the best, but are 
 doubtful.

 great pleasure to see you and other Pennsylvania gentle-

 meeting to conflict I believe." 

Vegetables in California. 

The California Farmer, published at San Francisco, 
 contains an .account of some extraordinary products ex- 
 hibited at an agricultural exhibition at San Francisco, 
 which seem entirely to distance competition in the At- 
 lantic States. They are as follows, by different exhibi- 
 tors : — 12 bushels of potatoes, the product of three po- 
 tatoes ; one large and splendid beet weighing 36J lbs.; 
 three sugar beets weighing 19, IG and 14 lbs. ; one po- 
 tatoe weighing 3J lbs.; three onions weighing 9 lbs.; one 
 measuring two feet in circumference; four squashes, 87, 
 70, 01 and Co lbs. each; one drumhead cabbage, 25 lbs.; 
 two specimens potatoes, oh lbs. each ; one blood beet, 
 65 lbs. when cleared of leaves, 52 lbs. after being out of 
 the ground sometime. 

What will our friend P. A. Mason, of New Jersey say 
 to this. He lives in a region famous for large pumpkins, 
 watermelons, &c. Can they heat California in beets, or 
 must we undertake it in Chester county ? 

Farming in Wisconsin. 

We have been favored with the perusal of a letter 
 from A. I}«GHAM, Esq., Secretary of the AVisconsin State 
 Agricultural Society to Dr. A. L. EiiWYN, of Philadel- 
 phia, which gives a flattering account of the condition 
 of agriculture in that section of our country. Although 
 iu a large majority of cases our young farmers will per- 
 haps do better to stay at home, and improve their sys- 
 tems of farming on their own paternal acres by deep 
 plowing, scientific manuring, and the culture of new 
 crops, which the extraordinary railroad facilities to and 
 from our large cities h.ave made profitable, rather than 
 to emigrate to distant regions, yet to those who have de- 
 termined to look out for new homes in the west the fol- 
 lowing extract from the letter may prove interesting. 
 It says : 

"Certainly our climate is colder than yours, but yet 
 we raise Indian corn in it,s greatest perfection, and I 
 have now lying on my table a corn stalk grown on my 
 own farm measuring 18 feet 6 inches in length, and I 
 had 100 bushels per acre as my crop. You know corn 
 want" warm weather, too. This was, however, more 
 than an average crop. 

"I also cut three tons of grass per acre from my farm 
 last fall, and I apprehend this must be a good yield al- 
 most any where. Still there are no doubt better grazing 
 counties, but I am satisfied with this answer. 

'■Our fair this year take place on the 4th, 5th and 0th 

Chester County Hogs. 

This valuable breed of hogs bids fair to become com- 
 mon in all parts of the country. Where they are known 
 they are appreciated highly, and, with rare exceptions, 
 their superior excellence has alone brought them into fa- 
 vor. There are no persons engaged exclusively in breed- 
 ing them, on the contrary they are kept by plain, practical 
 farmers, who having discovered that tliey grow rapidly 
 and produce a greater amount of ham and shoulder, 
 particulai'ly the former, of a first rate quality, than any 
 other breed, raise them as the most profitable of the hog 
 kind. The growing and now extensive demand from all 
 parts of the country is working a change, however, and 
 young roasters have become scarce. There is scarcely a 
 week that we do not hear of one or more pairs being 
 sent to distant points. A few days ago our friend Thos. 
 Wood sent some to Indiana and four to Oliio. Mr. W. 
 has some fine animals. 

Fourth Annnal Exhibition of the Pennsylvania State 
 Agricultural Society. 

The necessary funds having been obtained, it is now 
 understood as settled that our next State Exhibition is 
 to be held in Philadelphia. Highly eligible grounds, 
 very near the city proper, Avith the great central rail- 
 road on one side, and the Schuylkill river on the other, 
 aflbrding unusual facilities for bi'inging stock, imple- 
 ments, &c., from a distance without the expense of cart,- 
 ing or driving them for two or three miles after arri- 
 ving at their destination, have been procured, and there 
 is every probabilitj' of an exhibition which shall eclipse 
 all which have preceded it. 

Some of our cotemporaries have been mourning over 
 the great delay in raising the funds, and both surprise 
 and some little indignation has been talked about as to 
 the want of liberality in Philadelphia, that the neces- 
 sary means for the exhibition were not sooner forthcom- 
 ing. 

This has all been unnecessary. There never has been 
 the least doubt on the subject. It was considered so 
 simple and easy an affair, that even an effort was not 
 made till very recently, and if the fact of the exhibition 
 being held in Philadelphia depended on it, double or tre- 
 ble the amount could have been raised in a few hours. 

The premium list was published in our last, and we 
 hope soon to be able to give further details of the minor 
 arrangements.
