Delaware County Agricultural Society. 

We observe with much pleasure this organization in 
 an adjoining county. The movement is in the right 
 hands, and we have no doubt of its entire success. The 
 Delaware County Institute of Science has been in highly 
 prosperous operation for many years, and has exhibited 
 more intrinsic usefulness, activity and perseverance than 
 any similar society in the State out of Philadelphia. A 
 large number of its members, both male and female, are 
 of a high order of intelligence and varied scientific 
 knowledge, and have kept up their regular meetings and 
 exhibitions uninterruptedly for a long time. 

The schoolmaster was abroad in that little county, 
 some years before he was awakened up in other portions 
 of the State, and we shall consequently look for valuable 
 aid to agriculture in Peimsylvauiu, from the associated 
 efforts of her well skilled practical farmers in the new 
 society. We know some of the officers just elected can 
 hold the plow, and speak and write for the public with 
 equal efficiency. 

We hope they will adopt the plan of having, at least, 
 monthly meetings for discussion or exhibition of agri- 
 cultural or horticultural products. Interest in this way 
 is well kept up, and greater vigor of the Society promo- 
 ted. We have known many county societies to languish 
 and finally die away, because meetings were held only 
 once or twice a year. 

New Ornamental Tree. 

The Horticulturist of last mouth has a communication 

respecting Rhus Cotinoides, discovered by Nuttal on the 

high rocky banks of Grand River, Arkansas, which 

would no doubt be hardy here, and would be a valuable 

iic(|iiisiriipii to vav stock of flowering ornamental trees. 
 As its miiue iinpoi-t:\ it is similar to wluit is known so 
 lavo) iibly as the Purple Fringe or mist bush, one of our 
 most beautiful and generally cultivated shrubs. 

Rlius Cotinoides attains the size of a tree at least a 
 foot in diameter, and 30 to 40 feet high, and flowers 
 some weeks earlier than the purple fringe. When in 
 full blossom it must be a magnificent tree, and we hope 
 with the writer of the article in the Horticulturist, some 
 one will introduce it into cultivation. 

Black Spanish Fowls. 

Mr. Darlington : — lu the rage for choice fowls, it 
 may be well for those interested to keep an eye to the 
 nest, as well as to the carcass of the birds, particularly 
 as the profit or loss of the "fancier-" is likely to depend 
 considerably upon the laying — not lying — qualities of 
 the "hens," until the expectations of the great "fowl 
 king of Pennsylvania" shall be realized, when "Shang- 
 hais will be sold like beef in the market by the quarter, 
 and in roasts, steaks and chops." It is therefore impor- 
 tant, at present, to know which variety are the best lay- 
 ers, and I hope the owners of fine fowls will give the re- 
 sult of their observations in the Farm Journal. 

To begin, I beg to state that one of my neighbors, 
 James H. Bull, Esq., of this place, has a Black Spanish 
 pullet, that laid seventy-nine eggs, consecutively, during 
 the past spring, before manifesting any notion of setting. 
 After clucking two or three days, she retm-ued to laying 
 again, and is going it as strong as ever. I may give 
 you the result for a subsequent number. W. H.

 HIGH FAEMING.— No. 2. 

There are points of view in which the result of High 
 Farming is of much interest, and the first that comes before 
 us, and which all will acknowledge to be of the highest im- 
 portance, is what amount of capital one is justified in ex- 
 pending on land, consistent with what should never bo lost 
 sight of, a romuuerative and profitable return. This point 
 involves so many conditions that, in a country broad as our.i, 
 it is very difficult to gather them up, and then treat the sub- 
 ject as a topic, single and unconnected, or as a niero abstract 
 question. The fairest way, perhaps, to start in the exami- 
 nation, is to place the person intending to farm in circum- 
 stances that admit of high farming, and not to deposit him 
 on the cheap lauds of the west, or among its wild and un- 
 reclaimed forests ; farming, in the best sense of the word, is 
 not there possible. One may buy land at low prices and sup- 
 port himself and his family from the products. But these 
 do not increase his wealth, they are not taken as interest on 
 his capital, they are merely such returns as provide him 
 with the necessaries of life, while the profit on liis invest- 
 ment comes from the rise in the value of his land, with the 
 clearing and filling up of a new country. There are many 
 instances of great wealth obtained in this way, in whoso ac- 
 cumulation the individual has had no other part than the 
 enterprise and resolution displayed in taking the hazards 
 of a settlement in a wilderness, and the sagacious selection 
 of a good site and soil. Large estates have in this way, a.s 
 if by the waving of a wand, fallen to individuals — a very 
 few years have enriched men without an ell'urt on their 
 part. 

But these accidents of fortune are not to be ascribed to 
 farming, nor does the west offer examples or opportunities 
 for the best development of agricultural skill. At present.
