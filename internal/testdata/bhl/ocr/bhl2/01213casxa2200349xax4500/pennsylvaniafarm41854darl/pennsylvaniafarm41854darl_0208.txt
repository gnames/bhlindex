THE FARM JOURNAL. 

[June 

though not perhaps for many more years, the abundance of 
 land in that part of th* country, and the cheapness of all 
 produce, will make agriculture a loose, inartificial and un- 
 scientific department of industry. Men must feel the pros- 
 sure of competition, the active urgency of necessity, before 
 they will make great efforts, and as yet, the west is not so 
 compactly settled as to make hard labor an absolute duty, 
 or a rigid requisition. 

We must then, in our examination, select some other por- 
 tion of the country, where land is dearer, population denser, 
 competition more active, and all the circumst-ances more 
 nearly resembling those of an old country, where land may 
 be considered as capital and yielding revenue. There is, as 
 yot^ no part of this country where land rents for a sum that 
 is considered a good interest on its value. Even in the 
 neighborhood of large towns, where dairies are established, 
 land at eight, twelve or sixteen dollars aa acre does not pay 
 an interest on the amount for which the land would sell. 
 Railroads, which are every j'ear becoming more numerous, 
 give access so immediate to the interior, even to the remo- 
 test interior, that the necessaries of life cannot rise to a very 
 high price, without calling out the accumulations of distant 
 though easily accessible territory. It is true that the value 
 of produce in the west is assuming a more fixed nature — a 
 homo market is growing up there, with the increase of popu- 
 lation, that will necessarily keep up prices here, but these 
 will only stimulate our farmers to farm better and produce 
 more, for nothing is wanted to effect this but the assurance 
 that a profit will follow on the outlay of capital. 

In a new country like ours, farms are very seldom select- 
 ed as investments by the capitalist. As a source of amuse- 
 ntent, sometimes as a speculation, but very seldom as a per- 
 manent investment, a farm may be purchased. As no one 
 in this couuti-y is mad enough even to dream of doing that 
 which in older countries is considered a duty, the purcha- 
 sing a landed estate for the purpose of founding a family 
 and transmitting a niune. Land and farms bring up before 
 the imagination of the moneyed man, no other idea than 
 that of a most ti-oublesomo and unprofitable investment — no 
 titles of dignity — baronetcies, earldoms or dukedoms— rise 
 in the distance or are figured to the fancy, as illustrating a 
 remote posterity, but the unhappy capitalist, who has been 
 induced to buy large tracts of wild and unsettled territory, 
 finds a half savage squatter, a dishonest agent, or a sharp 
 and sponging lawyer, as very frequently among the realities 
 of his landed possessions, and among other sharp rebukes to 
 his wealth, and perhaps his avarice, his restless fellow citi- 
 zens plunder him by a tax for non-residence, or by acts no 
 gentler or more comfortable than their admiration and esti- 
 mation of the value of his estate. 

This condition of our country does not invito capitalists to 
 buy farms, so that there is very little opportunity, or even 
 possibilitj', for high farming. The land is owned, with very 
 few exceptions, by those who cultivate it; a body of men, 
 who, however great their industry or ability as farmers, 
 have generally very little money, and who are well aware 
 that any outlay beyond that which keeps up their fences, or 
 prevents their barns from tumbling down, or preserves their 
 implements in order, or their land in an ordinary productive 
 state, is money lost, and is more likely to ruin than to enrich 
 them. There are exceptions to this, but as a general rule it 
 is, we think, true. But it is a condition of things which is 
 rapidly parsing away — the increase of population, the facil- 
 ity of access to markets, and the sympathy and combination 
 of interest and feeling that has been produced by agricultu- 
 ral societies and agricultural periodicals, has awakened far- 
 mers to their true position, and broken through the apathy 
 that arose from laboring in a depressed and unprofitable 

pursuit. There is a spirit of inquiry abroad, a desire of 
 knowledge, and an activity of mind among farmers, that will 
 soon disj)laco all old ideas, break down prejudices, and raise 
 their art to a science, and themselves to a power in the re- 
 public. 

Farmers have been charged with being slow to adopt any 
 thing new, and as indisposed to examine or listen to any 
 thing which was considered an improvement. Their knowl- 
 edge of their art h;is been, it is said, merely transmitted in- 
 formation, that they did not use their own brain or senses, 
 but labored dully on with the narrow intelligence and shal- 
 low load of facts inherited from a father, grandfather, a 
 great-grandfather, or, it may be, some one even nearer the 
 time of our first parents. The charge has some foundation 
 and it may be true, that generations have successively 
 through ages tilled their land on a mistaken, stupid and er- 
 roneous system. But it may be asked who wa,s to tell them 
 this ? Were they to listen to inexperienced enthusiast,?, 
 surrender habits of action on whose results they could rely, 
 and take up some now agricultural manoeuveror, whose prac- 
 tice was conjectural, whose purpose and plan were as yet 
 doubtful, and whose end was uncertain; the light weight of 
 luck being in one scale and the heavier items of ruin and 
 beggary in the other. 

Can any one wonder that farmers are slow to change or to 
 be changed, that they examine closely, and receive with 
 doubt and even suspicion ? They live by the sweat of their 
 brow, their business is a struggle with nature ; everything is 
 let loose upon them — sun, earth and sky, all the elements 
 existing therein, all existences, animate or inanimate, are 
 the farmer's foes to battle with and conciliate, or his friends 
 to aid, relieve and sustain him ; which they are to be is con- 
 cealed from him, but he must be prepared for the alternative, 
 for each season is big with his fortune and his fate; yet his 
 only weapons are this meagre knowledge that it pleases the 
 inexperienced to ridicule, and the array of facts which have 
 come to him by his own observation, or been transmitted 
 through the instruction of others. Yet have not farmers 
 adopted such changes, even innovations on their old practi- 
 ces, as have boon recommended and shown to be of value 
 by one of their own body, and can finything more be ex- 
 pected of men subsisting by their labor, and engaged in a 
 pursuit so precarious, and so dependent on influences over 
 which they have no control as that of cultivating the earth. 
 If it were a possible thing to suppose that all the farmers of 
 a nation were at the suggestion, or under the guidance of 
 some empiric, or charlatan, to whirl round at his command, 
 to throw up their whole experience, and take to some new 
 plan of action, it might require some neat and nice calcula- 
 tion to sum the profit and loss, and the value of the crops. 
 We are inclined to think that gaping and vacant pockets and 
 pinched and peevish stomachs, would irritate and disturb 
 the numerals of the arithmetician, and stir, in no small de- 
 gree, the sensibilities of the nation. 

Let farmers then be considered as understanding their 
 business, and as the best judges of their own circumstances, 
 and let those, who think they know more than they do, 
 prove it by increased productiveness, larger profits, and a 
 balance sheet, where the gains are manifest and the losses 
 not concealed. Let this be done honestly and unequivocally, 
 and the superior wisdom and superior ability of the innova- 
 tor will be gratefully acknowledged and unhesitatingly fol- 
 lowed, but till this is done let no nina run his head against 
 that solid wall of discretion and good sense, that it may 
 please him, wise in his own conceit, to call ignorance or stu- 
 pidity. 

But those men, who under the resistless impulse of a ge- 
 nius for agriculture, or from vanity, or ambition, or the less
