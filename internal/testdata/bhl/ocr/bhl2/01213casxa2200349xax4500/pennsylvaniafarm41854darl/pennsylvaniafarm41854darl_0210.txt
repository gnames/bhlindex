Philadelphia Society for Promoting Agriculture. 

The Secretary of the Society, Alfred L. Kennedy, has 
 kindly forwarded us the proceedings of its last monthly 
 meeting, which we publish with pleasure, and shall hope to 
 receive them regularly for the future. There is much prac- 
 tical talent among its active members, and its proceedings 
 are of much importance and interest to the public : 

STATED MONTHLY MEETING. 

Stated Meeting at Masonic ILall, South Third street, 
 Wednesday morning. May .3d, 1854. 

Dr. Elwyn, President, in the chair. 

Minutes of preceding meeting read and approved. 

The following gentlemen, proposed at previous meeting, 
 were elected resident members : Mr. W. II. Gatzmer, of Ta- 
 cony, and Br. Charles Willing, and Messrs. M. A. Kellogg, 
 T. T. Lea, and W. R, Morris, of Philadelphia. 

A proposition for resident membership was received. 

The committee appointed to secure, by subscriptions from 
 citizens generally, the holding of the next State Agricultu- 
 ral Fair at Philadelphia, reported subscriptions amounting 
 to $2,8.35, which amount would be increased several hun- 
 dred dollars when full returns were received. The commit- 
 tee had not yet waited on retail dealers. It was so obvious- 
 ly the interest of that class, that the State Fair should be 
 added to the business attractions of Philadelphia, that any 
 deficiency in the required amount would doubtless be speed- 
 ily supplied. 

The President stated that little or no doubt existed that 
 Philadelphia would be selected by the Executive Committee 
 of the St-ate Society, for the next grand autumnal display. 
 lie inquired if the committee had visited the grounds liber- 
 ully offered for the purpose by the Pennsylvania Railroad 
 Company. 

Mr. A. T. Newbold had visited the grounds in company 
 with Mr. A. R. Roberts, and examined their suitableness for 
 the State Fair. It has been objected that the locality was 
 too near the city, and not well watered. AVere such found 
 to be the case, no difficulty could arise, as Mr. 0. Jones' 
 grounds, eligibly situated, one and a half miles from the 
 bridge, were also at the disposal of the Executive Commit- 
 tee. 

The President requested Mr. Coolf, an English farmer 
 present, to inform the Society of the estimation in which 
 Italian Rye grass was held in England. The grass had been 
 sown on Mr. Reybold's farm, in Delaware, and was much 
 approved there. 

Mr. Cook had sown the Italian Rye grass alone, two bu.«h- 

els to the acre— or better with eight lbs. red clover — late in 
 the season. He had mowed four times a season, others five 
 times, when used for soiling purposes. Ho knew no grass 
 preferable to the Italian Rye grass. 

Dr. Emerson called attention to the preference of the 
 English farmer for imported seed, and thought that tho 
 American would do well to imitate his example. 

Mr. Cook gave as a reason, that seed raised at home was 
 generally mixed with that of other grass seeds. The yield 
 of Rye grass was three tons per acre at first cutting, and 
 one and a half tons at second. The best hay was worth £5 
 per ton, ordinary £4 per ton. The Rye grass sprang early. 
 Ho had seen it one and a half yards high in April. It was 
 eaten by cattle at all seasons, and did not purge. For soil- 
 ing purposes in England, he had seen it mowed on 1st April. 
 The orchard grass, extensively sown in America, was not 
 approved of in England. A few pounds were sometimes 
 sown at seeding time. 

Mr. A. Clement did not regard tho Italian Rye grass as 
 affording good pasture. He acknowledged that it had an 
 early start. He had seen it this season a foot high in patch- 
 es in the city. 

Mr. H. IngersoU reminded the Society that the value of 
 hay differed in the two countries. Our Timothy had not 
 met with much favor at the London stables. Here it brought 
 the highest price. When it sold at $20 a ton alone, mixed 
 with half clover it was rated at $15. 

Mr. C. W. Harrison inquii'ed if cattle fed on rye grass 
 hay, second cutting, slobbered or were saliviited; other 
 grasses caused the affection in this country. 

Mr. Cook stated that such salivation was unknown in 
 England. 

Dr. Emerson remarked that the disease, if so it might bo 
 called, was ascribed, not to the grass, but to certain milky 
 weeds. He felt more disposed to attribute it to the clover 
 seed Tyhich produced salivation in the human subject, when 
 given in decoction. 

Dr. King had not observed oows salivated by the after- 
 grass. 

Mr. I. Newton's observations so far from agreeing with 
 those of Dr. King, had taught him that cows were so affect- 
 ed. 

Mr. Newbold mentioned that tho Rye grass on Mr. Rey- 
 bold's farm had been first brought from England about fif- 
 ten years ago, by a Mr. Blandon. 

Mr. Cook thought that the plant had been unknown in 
 England until about that time. 

Dr. A. L. Kennedy, in reply to a question from the chair, 
 mentioned that there were three species of Lolium growing 
 in this country. The Italian Rye or Ray grass was tho Lo- 
 lium mxiltlforiim. 

The President said there was no doubt that the Italian 
 Rye grass thrived in this climate. It furnished pasture sev- 
 eral weeks earlier than the Poa family. It was less exhaust- 
 ing than Timothy. He invited an expression of opinion on 
 the subject of subsoiling. Ho believed that in England the 
 practice was not regarded with as much favor as former- 
 ly- 

Mr. Cook said that with shallow draininjc, say one to two 
 feet deep, subsoiling possessed value ; but the present meth- 
 od of draining, three to four feet in depth, superceded the 
 necessity for subsoiling. He had abandoned the practico 
 entirely since he began to drain deeply. 

Mr. Gustavus Engle had a neighbor who had subsoilod for 
 corn with great success. The surface soil was light, the sub- 
 soil a yellow loam not tenacious. Tho first plowing was four 
 inches deep, the second nine. Mr. E. had never seen finer 
 corn.
