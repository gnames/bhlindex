Dr. King had experimented in subsoiling land previously 
 drained. He did not think that draining superceded the ne- 
 cessity for subsoiling. Lauds whiieh, with drains two feet 
 deep, had yieUK-d in 1852 but ton bushels of corn per acre, 
 was sown with oats the followiug year, after a portion hud 
 been subsoiled. On this, although the whole was otherwise 
 similarly treated, both head and straw Wore much fuller. 
 The present season the wheat on the part subsoiled, looks 
 far better than that on the portion which had been merely 
 drained. His subsoil is a stratum of clay four feet thick. 

The President admitted that root crops required a loose 
 poll, but questioned if herbaceous plants sought food very 
 far beneath the surface. 

Dr. Emerson had seen the roots of wheat three feet long. 
 He would inquire what root crops were preferred in Eng- 
 land. 

Mr. Cook. — The purple-top Swedish turnip, which on land 
 impoverished by contiimous grain cropping, will, with three 
 to four cwt. of guano per acre, yield thirty to forty tons of 
 roots, tops off. These turnips are fed whole to stock. A 
 large ox will fatten on a weekly ration of ten to fifteen cwt. 
 of Swedish turnips and barley. The white turnip is seldom 
 used. The average weekly allowance of a bullock may be 
 twelve cwt. turnips and sixty lbs. straw, equal to two cwt. 
 hay and three bushels corn. The corn being taken at sev- 
 enty lbs. the bushel. 

Mr. Newton preferred a mixture of turnips and Indian 
 meal. Bullocks would fatten half as fast again, on a mi.x- 
 ture, say half and half, than on either alone. 

Mr. Ingersoll insisted that we forgot differences in cli- 
 mat-e. Our turnips, as food, are not equal to the English. 
 Our cattle would not fatten on them alone, although cows 
 might be kept in condition. 

Mr. Harrison thought that root crops were overrated in 
 America. Grain was certainly cheaper in the end. 

Mr. Cook hoped that members would not lose sight of the 
 fact that graiu iinpoverislied the soil, while roots enriched it 
 and left it in fine order. 

Mr. Newton specified two bushels of corn and one and a 
 half bushels turniii.-^ per week for .a bullock of a thousand 
 weight. Sheep fed on roots alimc yielded mutton of infe- 
 rior quality, by no means comparable in flavor to that from 
 sheep fed on .a mixed diet. 

On motion of Mr. Ingersoll, that the further discussion of j 
 the subject be jiostponed until next meeting; which was so 
 ordered. 

A communication was received from Marshall P. Wilder, 
 President of the American Pomological Society, inviting the 
 election of delegates to the next annual meeting of the Po- 
 mological Society to be held in Boston. 

Dr. Kennedy submitted for action at next meeting, a res- 
 olution, providing that new members on the paj'ment of one 
 dollar, be furnished with a framed certificate of member- 
 ship. 

On motion, adjourned.

Farmers' High School of Pennsylvania and the Death 
 of Elliott Cresson. 

The following resolution, offered by .James Gowen, Esq., 
 at a meeting of the Executive Committee of the Pennsylva- 
 nia State Agricultural Society and unanimously adopted, 
 has inadvertentlj' escaped notice in the Farm -Journal. Tho 
 liberality of the donor in a matter of such vital interest to 
 Pennsylvania, deserves a permanent record in its pages, and 
 we make the insertion with much pleasure : 

The death of Elliot Cresson, Esq.'r, which occured at 
 Philadelphia, on the 20th of February, IS54, in the 5Sth 
 year of his age, has left a void in the ranks of Philanthro- 
 py, Benovelance, and private worth, difficult to be supplied 
 or filled, causing a deep sensation of sorrow and regret 
 that his labors in the broad field of human rights and human 
 progress had not been vouchsafed a longer day, with a 
 slower setting sun for the further development of his noble 
 efforts, and to mitigate tho grief of his brcaved relatives 
 and friends. But they, and the whole comunity, have the 
 consolation to reflect that however brief his probation, he 
 did not live in vain: and "though dead he yet spcaketh" 
 in the memorials he has left for their example and contem- 
 plation. In these regrets, and in these mcnioriiils, this So- 
 ciery is deeply a sympathiser and most grtaefuUy a debtor. 

Resolved, That this Society, at its first meeting since 
 tho decease of the lamented Elliot Cresson, offers ite tri-
