and pliable, through which the sap can flow unobstruct- 
 ed to perform its proper ofSces, which is the same in 
 both fruit and ornamental trees whatever the report may 
 assert to the contrary. We doubt very much if the laics 
 of nature are difi'erent in New England and Peuusylva- 
 nia, and we can point in this vicinity to many places 
 where marked and extraordinary benefit has resulted 
 from the very practices the Massachusetts Society has 
 condemned. We submit below the report of the com- 
 mittee, parts of which are somewhat contradictory, and 
 may be made to mean any thing or nothing. It will be 
 observed that not only whitewash, now generally and 
 properly discarded, but all other applications to the 
 trunks of trees, are condemned: 

"That, whereas it is a common custom to scrape off 
 the outside baik of fruit and ornamental trees, and wash 
 and plaster them with lime and other preparations, in 
 the hope of benefiting the trees by the destruction of 
 parasites .and insects injurious to vegetation, and of im- 
 proving their general appearance, the Massachusetts 
 Horticultui-al Society do hereby resolve, for reasons 
 which have been stated, they consider this practice of no 
 benefit to the tree froin its inability to affect the majority 
 of the insects ichich are really injurious; and unnecessary 
 in the case of lichens and mosses, they being not the 
 cause but the consequence of disease and decay; and a posi- 
 tive violation of the laws of vegetable physiology, and 
 consequently an injury to all trees, but ornamental in 
 particular, to an incalculable amount. 

"Resolve 2d, That as lichens and mosses, in a healthy 
 state of the tree, are, so far as can be ascertained, no 
 injury to the bark, but, from their varied colors and 
 forms, one of its chiefest ornaments, any operations for 
 their removal are to be scrupulously avoided, and repre- 
 hended. 

"Resolve Sd, That as strict inquiry has shown that 
 bark lice, woolly aphis, and some borers do lay their eggs 
 and hatch their young upon the bark of apples, pears, 
 peaches, and maples, 7iear the ground, and in the forks of 
 the branches, a gentle rubbing with some pliable but stiff 
 wire or other brush, on the parts affected, to be followed 
 by a washing with weak, soft or whale oil soap suds, is 
 ■ desirable and will be of benefit, when a careful exami- 
 nation shall have shown that the eggs are deposited 
 upon any tree in question, but that this process is unneces- 
 sary, and uneconomical when the presence of the enemy has 
 not been most clearly proved. 

"Resolve ith, That nature is the best and only true 
 guide in horticultural operations ; and that if we wish 
 to equal her in the health and beauty ot our plantations, 
 we must as nearly as may be follow in her footsteps ; 
 that as she provided some trees with rough, and some 
 with smooth bark, there can be no doubt that the corti- 
 < cal differences have an intimate connection with, and re- 
 lation to, the vitality and economies of the tree, and we 
 view any separation of it from the tree, or any opera- 
 .tions on its surface having for their aim to reduce the 
 rough bark to the smooth, or vice versa, decidedly imsci- 
 •^entific, and unworthy improved horticulture. 

"Resolve bth, That as it has been shown that fruit 
 trees are specially liable to be in_^ured by a few insects, 
 -whose eggs may be removed by proper rubbing, it by no 
 means folloics that all trees are to be subjected to the same 

j treatment; that ive would most strenuoudy discountenance 
 ■ any such miiversal medicinal practice ; that it must not be 
 forgotten in reasoning with regard to horticultural ope- 
 rations, that fruit trees are sui generis, and being neces- 
 sarily diseased need much more care and attention than 
 ornamental ; and as we grow the one for fruit alone, and 
 the most of it we can get, and the other for beauty and 
 shade, so each needs a separate culture ; and as one of 
 the most delightful charms of the ornamental tree is 
 this very roughness of bark, with its accompanying li- 
 chens, we consider that man's taste unworthy and unculti- 
 vated who can lay a rough hand upon the tree to reduce all 
 to one unvarying uniformity. 

"Resolve Gth, That as all bark is, from its composi- 
 tion, open to the attacks of alkaline preparations, and as 
 no good and sufficient reasons can be adduced for their 
 use, and as their caustic and cement-like nature tends to 
 destroy the tissues, and prevent a proper expansion of the 
 bark and stem, and as they are necessarily accompanied 
 with considerable outlay, ice most sincerely hope the prac- 
 tice will cease. 

"Resolve 7th, Although the subject of pruning has but 
 little connection with bark culture, still, as they go hand 
 in hand, they may not unreasonably be discussed at the 
 same time ; and whilst, for the reasons above stated, fruit 
 trees need peculiar cultivation, and a certain amount of pru- 
 ning, ornamental require only to be well planted and ma- 
 nured, and should never be touched by a pruner's hand 
 farther than to remove dead icood, and we do regard with 
 great sorrow and regret, all those efforts by the ignorant 
 to trim away the beauty of the lower and hanging branches, 
 reducing the tree, in too many cases, to a close resemblance 
 of a bunch of brush elevated on the top of a pole." 

Soiling Cattle. 

Are any of our readers able to give us practical data 
 from their own experience with soiling. Despite the 
 difference in climate between this country and England, 
 we have always believed, with the right management, it 
 could be made, even with our drier temperature, exceed- 
 ingly profitable in particular locations. That the health 
 of animals, when confined in small enclosures, or even in 
 well ventilated airy stables, is as good as when allowed 
 a large range, appears to be well established, not only 
 here, where experiments on a small scale have been 
 made, but also in England, where in many of the largest 
 dairies, the cows are wholly soiled, and never moved 
 from their first being tied up till they go to the butch- 
 er. 

In some of the larger establishments there, it is as- 
 serted that the amount of milk in the year is greater 
 than when the cows are pastured, which is owing to their 
 being less exposed to the vicissitudes of the seasons, 
 and to regularity in the quantity and quality of food. 
 In the vicinity of large cities where land is valuable and 
 every rod should be turned to good account, it is well 
 worth a fair trial. The advantages are : 

1st. That at least double the stock may be kept on the 
 same land, and probably treble. 

2d. The great increase, easier control and better man- 
 agement of the manure heap. 

3d. The very great saving of inside fencing, which 
 will be found a very important item.
