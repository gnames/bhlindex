THE FARM JOURXAL. 

[JULT 

immense amount of timber used in the construction and 
 management of railroads can hardly be conceived. Bridges, 
 ties, and fuel, create such a demand for the products of the 
 forest, that they disappear before it as they do before a de- 
 vouring fire. Nothing is spared. The noble tree of a cen- 
 tury's growth is called for, to take its place in some gigantic 
 structure over a river or a yawning chasm ; the vigorous 
 yo\ing oaks are imbedded in the mud every two or throe feet 
 ap-irt I'or hundreds of consecutive miles, there to rot away 
 and perish within five years. Even the decaying and oth- 
 erwise worthless tree is cut up into fuel to supply tho-never- 
 to-be-satisiied cravings of the iron steed, that thunders in 
 his swift career over tlie plains. 

The demand for fuel, even in this city, to supply the loco- 
 motives alone, is perfectly astounding. A railroad train is 
 run regularly every day out of town, over the Lockport road, 
 for the sole and only puri)ose of bringing in fuel ibr the lo- 
 comotives of the Central road. How much longer is this to 
 last '! How soon, at this rate, will the last stick be cut from 
 all our hills and jilains? And yet, the Central is only one 
 of a countless nunil>er of the like destroyers of the forest — 
 consuming in a day the product of a century. 

vSome jirocess ought to be immediately adopted to render 
 rii.il:o.i<l ties less perishable, and to substitute coke or some 
 other material for wood as fuel for the locomotive; for un- 
 less this is done, a forest tree will live ere long only in his- 
 tory. AVo would end as we have begun, with the significant 
 v.'arning — farmers, look to your forests ! — Rural New Yorker. 

On Biight in Pear Tress. 

BV A. H. EliNST, CINCINNATI. 

[1^0 man in the Western country is better qualified to 
 vfTita about pears and pear culture than Mr. Ernst ; and as 
 his advice or opinions are based on his own experience and 
 years of careful observation, much reliance may be placed 
 on his conclusions. In the Hurticultiiral Review for the past 
 month, is an essay by him, on the diseases of the pear tree, 
 read before a recent meeting of the Cincinnati Horticultural 
 Soiiety, from which wo take the following extract. — Ohio 
 Cultivator.] 

''Long experience has confirmed my judgment that the 
 disease [blight] is chargeable mainly to atmospheric influ- 
 ences. The Great Creator has, in his wisdom, so ordered it, 
 that the vegetation, soil, and climate of every part of the 
 globe act in perfect harmony, for the best development of 
 the former. A departure from this state of nature is at the 
 ha/.ard of the health and longevity of the plant or tree, 
 tliough this result does not invariably follow. The pear 
 tree, as before observed, is not a native of this continent, 
 but of a ditiorenfc hemisphere; where it grows to largo size 
 and great ago, as other forest trees do. All intelligent wri- 
 ters, so far as I know, arc agreed that the improvement of 
 the fruit has generally been at the expense of the hardiness 
 and durability of the tree (not a necessary consequence). 
 However, we find it so. Wo have imported an enfeebled 
 race, and arc exposing it to a new climate, the vicissitudes 
 of which it is not fully capable of resisting. I care not for 
 terms: whether you call it Frozen Sap hliylit, or Sun hliijht; 
 whether the effect is produced by sudden and rapid changes 
 of temperature, or an excessive ^aunnler sun. In either case 
 it is the destruction of the natural functions of the tree, pro- 
 ducing disease and death. The former is often tardy in its 
 work, but the latter generally rapid and instantaneous. In 
 the one case, it is brought to bear on the tree in a state of 
 reiit, when their juices have been expended to form wood, 
 which is immaturcly ripened. In the other case, when the 
 sap-vessels are extended to their utmost c.ipacity, to supply 
 the demands of a rapid and luxuriant growth ; when this 
 growth is in its most tender and delicate condition, the 
 scorching raid-day sun does the mischief; the sap, by its 
 rays, is scalded and vitiated, a chemical process of decom- 
 position takes place, its poison is soon carried to and mixed 
 with other portions of the tree, and the whole is often irre- 
 trivably lost in a few hours. The only remedy is, the mo- 
 ment that it is discovered on the limb, whore this form of 
 blight always makes its appearance, to hip oft' until you 
 come to the sound and healthy wood, and thus prevent its 
 spreading. Do not stop to hunt insects, until you have per- 
 formed tins work, when you can do so leisurely. 

.S'»n hliyht, or Fire llirjht, is always most prevalent in a 
 wet and hot summer. There has been but little the last 
 three years, and wo shall certainly have no frozen sap blight 

to complain of next summer. This is to bo attributed to 
 rather unusually dry summers during this period ; the wood 
 having ripened well before winter set in, and the growth not 
 so luxuriant as in wet seasons. 

As a remedy, or rather a preventive to the frozen sop 
 lilight, I would suggest the shortening-in application, in 
 September or October, to check the growth, and induce the 
 maturing of the wood. This system is, perhaps, only appli- 
 cable to dwarfs, as standards cannot well be reached. What 
 is understood by shortening-in, is to cut back the present 
 year's new shoots to the firm wood, say one-third or one-half 
 of it, as the case may require, so that the sap remaining 
 shall be expended in perfecting the wood which is left, and 
 not be stimulated by the leaves on the ends of the shoots to 
 continue growth. This system is also practiced to force tho 
 tree into forming fruit spurs, and thus facilitate the produc- 
 tion of frait. Care must bo observed in tho time of per- 
 forming this operation. It must not be so early in the sea- 
 son as to cause the bursting of tho lateral buds, and thereby 
 cause a more injurious growth than it is attempted to check. 
 There need be very little risk in this ; we must be governed 
 by the state of the season. It is better a little late than too 
 early ; when tho majority of the leaves on tho shoot are 
 rigid and hard, is a suitable indication of the proper lime. 

Having said so much about the want of hardiness of tho 
 tree, it may be asked, how I account for the trees that are to 
 be found up and down our land, which have withstood the 
 winter's storms and summer's heat from one to two hundred 
 years ? Before I answer the question, allow me to ofler them 
 as standing monuments against the exhaustion and insect 
 theories. We have had some specimens in this vicinity — 
 until tho spirit of city improvoments required their room, 
 when the rude hand of the workman brought them low — 
 whose existence was co-eval with the first impress of civili- 
 zation ; they remained sound, healthy, and fruitful to tho 
 last. Such specimens, it will be found, have all originated 
 from seed, and always from a hardier stock than tho varie- 
 ties of more modern introduction. A friend has just given 
 me the history of one in Guilford, Conn., which he says is 
 over two hundred years old, measuring fifteen feet in cir- 
 cumference at five or six feet from the ground. It is now 
 beginning to decay, but yields a considerable quantity of 
 fruit. He says the fruit does not compare with the best now 
 in cultivation, but when he was a boy, more than fifty years 
 ago, it was considered very superior. 

It is to these hardy remains of ancient days, wo must look 
 for constitutions to hybridize with our finer sorts, say, if you 
 please, the Seckel, which is as hardy as any of them, for a 
 class of trees producing superior fruit, and, at tho same time, 
 such as we can trust out of doors." 

Double Michigan Plow. 

The following strong testimony as to tho merits of the 
 above plow, wo copy from the Ohio Farmer : 
 lieport of Committee on Trial of Plows at Tiffin, Ohio, Sa- 
 tnrday, 3Iay 13, 1S54. 

Four plows were entered for trial, as follows: — The Steel 
 Sod and Trash Plow, which won the first premium at the 
 last Ohio State Fair, as a plow for general purposes, having 
 changeable mould board .and beam ; a two, and a three-horse 
 Cast Plow, made by Mr. Sheiber, and the Michigan Double 
 Plow. 

The ground selected was bottom land sod, having been in 
 pasture for several years. 

The Steel Plow, entered by Mr. Ogle, did good work 
 with the power of two horses, cutting a furrow 9 by IG inch- 
 es. The two-horse Cast Plow, entered by Mr. Sheiber, cuts 
 a furrow readily, 16 inches in width, but works best at a 
 depth of 7 inches. The only material difierenoo apparent, 
 between the working of the plows, was that the Steel Plow 
 required nn average draft of 250 pounds less than its com- 
 petitor. A careful trial of the Michigan Double Plow, by 
 the Dynamometer, proved it to require the same power when 
 cutting a furrow 9 by 16 inches, with three horses attached, 
 as was required by tlio Steel Changeable Plow named above, 
 and consequently 250 pounds less than tho Cast two-horse 
 Plow. 

It was conceded that the Double Plow performed better 
 work than it is possible for any single plow to perform, pla- 
 cing the sod, and all trash, in the bottom of the furrow, and 
 covering it to a good depth with well pulverised soil, ready 
 prepared, without harrow or clod-crusher, for the seed.
