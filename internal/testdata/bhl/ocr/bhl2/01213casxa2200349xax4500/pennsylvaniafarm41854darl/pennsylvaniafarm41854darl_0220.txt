The Strawberry Question. 

J. L. Darlincton : â€” As facts iire iilwajs more impor- 
 tant in the settlement of disputed points than mere ar- 
 guments, we may state as having sonie bearing on the 
 changeableness (so asserted) of the strawberry blossom, 
 that one year ago we planted out a large bed of straw- 
 berry plants, selected iudLfcriminately from one of the 
 most productive strawberry patches of a somewhat cele- 
 brated grower near Philadelphia, who is i-ather famed in 
 the markets for the fine size and productiveness of liis 
 crops. Our object was merely to grow the fruit for 
 market, and we did not care about any particular varie- 
 ties, being well aware that the truckers near the city do 
 not keep them very select. We sent a man to get them, 
 who had seen the previous season the very extraordinary 
 yield from the very piece of ground where he selected 
 our plants. 

Oar ground was well manured and otherwise prepared; 
 they grew well, and the present spring when we expect- 
 ed a very large crop are disappointed in the bed proving 
 nearly barren. From nearly' an acre of ground hardly 
 half a bushel of strawberries will be obtained. The 
 blossoms proved chiefly staminate with some hermaphro- 
 dites. Now we think this must be owing to one or two 
 causes : 1st. That from change of soil, location, or other 
 imknown causes, the strawberries have changed their 
 sexual character after removal, or else that the man who 
 procured them, hj chance, selected several thousand un- 
 productive plants from a very large productive bed. 
 That such only should be selected from a place produ- 
 cing three to five thousand quarts to the acre, and where 
 an unproductive plant could hardly be found if closely 
 hunted for, is rather an improbable assumption. 

My opinion is that the strawberry docs change its sex- 

ual character, that it is liable to become staminate, pis- 
 tillate or hermaphrodite, and although I do not believe, 
 as Mr. Mekiian has been cbai-ged with asserting, that 
 this can be done at will, I do believe that it sometimes 
 happens from causes beyond our control, and for reasons 
 which we cannot understand. I often hear of disap- 
 pointment similar to my own, in a new plantation of 
 strawberries, where fruit was expected and none found, 
 and how are we otherwise to account for it. I do not 
 care what the books or learned societies may saj', how 
 unscientific it may be called, or how much it may mili- 
 tate against Princely theories, I am apt to believe what I 
 see and know from actual experiment. One other simi- 
 lar case now occurs to me : A friend of mine, two or three 
 years ago, visited a bed to procure plants for setting out, 
 where the owner had taken unusual pains to have a 
 staminate plant about every fifteen feet apart from the 
 pistillates, and by careful watching to prevent the run- 
 ners from these extending themselves. The new bed 
 was set out, and behold ! at least nineteen-twentieths 
 were staminates, hardly a pistillate plant among them, 
 and the bed of course entirely unproductive, and had to 
 be dug up. I believe, whatever the wise men may say 
 to the contrary, that the strawberry plant cuts strange 
 freaks sometimes, and is no more to be relied on than a 
 fickle young lady who does not know her own mind, and 
 it seems no especial cause of ivondermcnt. The normal 
 character of the strawberry is that of a j^erfect flower ; 
 All the present variations are but types of the original, 
 varied according to circumstances, and all have a ten- 
 dency to change and revert back to their original char- 
 acter. In England the distinctions we make are said to 
 be unknown. A PRACTICAL GARDENER.
