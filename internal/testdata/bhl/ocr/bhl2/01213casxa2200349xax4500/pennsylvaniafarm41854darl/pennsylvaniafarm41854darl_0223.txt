Strawberry Question, 

In the Farm Journal for May (page 162), ive acknowl- 
 edged the receipt of a small volume entitled "Grape Culture 
 and the Strawberrj'," and intimated an intention of copying 
 from it the report of a committee on the ''Strawberry Ques- 
 tion" in our next (June) number, but it was found necessary 
 to postpone it until the present. The following is the re- 
 port : 
 The Committee to whom was referred the investigation of the 

Skxuaij Character of the Strawberry, beg leave to 

report : — 

That they have endeavored to discharge, in the most 
 thorough manner, the duty imposed upon them, by investi- 
 gating, with note-book in hand, the condition of various 
 kinds of Strawberries, at the different stages of their pro- 
 gress, from the blossom to the ripened fruit, so as to observe 
 any peculiarities of infloresonce, and watch the consequent 
 effects upon the fruetiSeation. As an evidence of the fideli- 
 tj- with which your Committee have discharged their duty, 
 allow them to say that this Report is based upon more than 
 two hundred and seventy recorded observations, which were 
 made with critical accuracy, and as extended, in almost 
 every instance, as it were possible to render them ; hence it 
 may be safely assumed, that they have now sufficient data 
 and abounding testimony to prove the postulates they intend 
 to lay down in this report. The whole subject has been so 
 ably and so frequently explained to this society and com- 
 munity that there is nothing new left for your Committee, 
 who only reiterate truths well established and generally ad- 
 mitted among us. 

After carefully collating and reviewing the facts which 
 they have observed and recorded, the Committee present the 
 following concluMinnii or postulute-i, which have been deduced 
 from their united observations: 

1. That there are many different varieties of the Straw- 
 berry, which a.-e characterized, in part, by the foliage, 
 pubescence, mode of growth, and fruit, and, also, by their 
 iiiflorc-icetice. 

2. That the varieties in inflorescence (the most important 
 to the cultivator) consist in the greater or less development 
 of the stamens and pistils, respectively, upon which are 
 based our terms and classification, "atamiuate" and "jjintil- 
 late," or, more familiarily with the mass of cultivators, male 
 and female. 

3. That these classes nre permanent aberrations from what 
 the great Linnteus considered the normal condition of this 
 genus of plants, as of its natural family Rosace.e. 

4. That nearly all botanists ^and among them our most 
 enlightened modern writers) have overlooked the important 
 error of Linu;eus, and have simply copied after him in their 
 descriptions of the strawberry, without veryifying for them- 
 selves; while a plain, unlettered market gardener, but a 
 practical and observing man, discovered the important fact, 
 tliat while in some plants the flowers are apparently perfect 
 in both sets of organs, one set is really defective, to a great- 
 er or less extent, and, in others, the flowers which we style 
 jiUtiUatc, have the stamens so imperfectly developed as en- 
 tirely to elude a casual observation, and onlj' to be discover- 
 ed by a critical observer, and then, in most instances, found 
 to be wholly abortive. 

5. That no pintillnte plant will bear a perfect fruit, if kept 
 entirely apart from staminate varieties. 

6. That no atamtnate plants, which we have yet seen, can 
 be depended upon by the cultivator as heavy bearers, though 
 from some unknown causes, the pistils may be so well devel- 
 oped as to be followed by a good crop, some years, and in 
 6ome situations. 

7. That there is no such thing yet known to us as a per- 
 fect flowered strawberry plant, in which the blossoms will 
 all be uniformly so well provided with both sets of organs as 
 to be followed hy j^erfeet fruit every 3"ear. 

8. That the only method of producing this dolioious fruit, 
 with any degree of certainty as to the result, is that now 
 adopted by our intelligent cultivators, namely : To set out 
 plants of both of the sexual classes, the relative proportions 
 of each to be determined by experience, selecting such pis- 
 tillate kinds as may prove of good size and flavor, and only 
 so many staminates as may be found necessary for impreg- 
 nation, 

9. That the runners from a strawberry ))lant are as inte- 
 gral portions of itself as the branches and buds of a tree ; 
 and, therefore, that we maj' always propagate any variety 
 by this means, with as much certainty as we perpetuate 
 any variety of apple, or other fruit, by grafting or inocula- 
 tion. 

There are great differences in the productiveness of the 
 staminates, from those which are entirely l>arren to those 
 which may bear tolerably well, or even very well, under pe- 
 culiar circumstances; but our cultivators have been unable 
 to ascertain any regimen, soil, oi treatment, that will insure 
 a full crop of berries upon any staminate variety, in a suc- 
 cession of j'ears ; and thej-, therefore, condemn them as un- 
 worthy of cultivation, except as impregnators, and for this 
 purpose recommend the selection of those which are remark- 
 able for the size and flavor of their fruit, time of flowering, 
 hardiness, etc. 

Since the great "Straiclerry Queation" has attracted so 
 much attention, very many persons, anxious to verify for 
 themselves the new doctrine, have tried the experiment of 
 planting pistillate kinds separate and apart from all others. 
 These efforts have been carried on with more or less care and 
 precision ; but the results, in all cases that have come within 
 our notice, confirm the Committee in their fifth conclusion, 
 that no piatillaie plant will bear a perfect fruit, if Iccjyt entire- 
 ly apart from aiaminate varieties. And they are perfectly 
 satisfied that where anj' person thinks he has met with a 
 different result, he must have been deceived by overlooking 
 some male plants in the bed, or near it. 

The Committee, having examined a great many new seed- 
 lings, which have not yet been tested sufficiently, have ob- 
 served this fact, that, admitting them to be equally divided 
 in their sexual character, the majority of the staminates will 
 prove to be entirely barren. 

All those who would enter upon the business, or try ex- 
 periments, are advised to commence by impregnating the 
 best and largest pistillate? with the largest and most highly- 
 flavored staminates ; keep each plant and its ninners cntirc- 
 \y separate from all others; test them well before exhibition, 
 and lasllj', if they be not decidedlj' superior to the kinds al- 
 ready grown, in size, flavor and productiveness, or, unless 
 the}- have some peculiarity of lateness ur early ripening, it 
 will bo best to say nothing about them; for we have aereral 
 kinds alreadj- that are worth raising, and are not confined to 
 a selection of four sorts, as some suppose, namely, Hovey's 
 Pistillate, Boston Pine, Wood and Scarlet, the three latter of 
 which are here condemned as unproductive, being stami- 
 nates. A, H. Ernst,
