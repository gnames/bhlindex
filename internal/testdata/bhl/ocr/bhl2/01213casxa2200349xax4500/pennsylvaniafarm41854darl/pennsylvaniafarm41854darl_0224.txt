Domestic Recipes. 

Rice Balls. — A few days since we s:it at the table of 
 a Connecticut la'ij, who has fortunately been rightly 
 cducalcd to look upon the care of her own household af- 
 fairs and the proper instruction of her own children, as 
 a higher and nobler occupation than nursing poodles and 
 lap-dogs, or pursuing the gay baubles of fashionable life. 
 We need not say that her house was in order, and that 
 under her superintendence food was prepared and the 
 table arranged to please both eye and taste. But we did 
 not commence to write this about household arrange- 
 ments — for, although we have an eye upon such matters 
 wherever we go, we leave the subject to our fair corres- 
 pondents who have promised us aid in this line — we now 
 only wish to give what we cnll (he best method of cook- 
 ing rice to our taste. At our request, the lady above 
 referred to, furnished us the following recipe, which is 
 simple and i/nod we knov; : Boil rice until it is soft, and 
 while warm make it into cakes or flat balls. Dip these 
 balls into a beaten egg, and then roll them into Indian 
 meal till thoroughly coated. This done, fry them in 
 lard, which is better than butter for this purpose. Serve 
 them with sauce, or with butter or cream and sugar. 
 Try tliem, ladies, and in return for this recipe send us 
 one of your best. — Amer. Agriculturist. 

A Good Way of Putting Down Carpets. — A foreign 
 correspondent of the Newark Advertiser in writing from 
 Florence says: — Here iron rings are fastened in the flooi-s 
 when the carpets are laid, and they have large hooks in 
 the binding, for which these rings are eyes; so that 
 there is no taking out and nailing in of tacks, and car- 
 pets are raised and laid as noiselessly and easily as bed- 
 covers. 

To Drive Away Red Ants. — Sprinkle the floor, 
 shelves, &c., which they infest, with fine shore-sand — 
 from a saltwater beach if possible. A correspondent 
 says this is true. 

To Preserve Barberries. — To one povmd of the 
 berries add one pound of sugar, a pint and a half of mo- 
 lasses ; and simmer them together half an hour or more, 
 until they become soft. 

Calf's Foot Jelly. — Boil four feet, nicely cleaned, in 
 a gallon of water, till reduced to one quart ; strain it, 
 and when cool take off the top. In taking out the jelly 
 avoid the settlings. Add a half pound of sugar, the 
 juice of two lemons, and, if you please, the whites of 
 four eggs to make it clear: boil all together a few min- 
 utes, and strain it through a cloth. 

Currant Jelly. — Place ajar of currants in a kettle 
 of boiling water till the currants become wilted ; then 
 .squeeze them through a cloth. Add a pint of sugar to a 
 pint of juice; boil it slowly till it becomes ropy. It 
 should be frequently stirred and skimmed while simmer- 
 ing. 

Lemon Cake. — Take one tea cup of butter, and three 
 of powdered loaf sugar ; rub them to a cream ; stir into 
 them the yolks of five eggs well beaten ; dissolve a tea 
 spoonful of saloBratus in a tea cup of milk, and add the 
 milk ; add the juice and grated peel of one lemon, and 
 the whites of five eggs ; and sift in, as light as possible, 
 four tea cups of flour. Bake in two long tins about half 
 an hour. It is much improved by icing. 

Cup Cake. — Rub to a cream three cups of sugar, with 

one and a half of batter ; stir in three well beaten eggs, 
 three cups of sifted flour, and rose water, or essence of 
 lemon to the taste. Dissolve a tea spoonful of salasratus 
 in a cup of milk, strain it into the cake, and add three 
 more cups of sifted flour: bake immediately in cups or 
 pans. 

Measure Cake. — Rub to a cream two cups of sugat 
 and one of butter; stir in four well beaten eggs, a gra- 
 ted nutmeg, and three cups of flour ; stir it till just be- 
 fore baking. Bake in cups or in pans. 

Good Family Cake. — Take two pounds of flour, half 
 a pound of butter, half of white sugar, one gill of yeast, 
 half a spoonful of mace, or other spice, to your taste. 
 Mix well half your flour with the yeast and milk, and 
 let it stand till perfectly light. Add the butter, eggs, 
 sugar and spice together, and stir in the remainder of 
 your flour ; then gently pour this to the first mixture ; 
 let all stand till perfectly light ; then bake it in pans. 

Jumbles. — Rub to a cream a pound of sugar, and half 
 a pound of butter ; add eight well beaten eggs, essence 
 of lemon or rose water to the taste, and flour to make 
 the jumbles stiff" enough for rolling out. Roll out, in 
 powdered sugar, about half an inch wide and four inches 
 long, and form them into rings by joining the ends. 
 Lay them on flat buttered tins, and bake in a quick 
 oven. 

Preserving Flowers and Fruit. — Dip them in a 
 solution of gum arable and water two or three times, 
 waiting a sufficient time between the immersions to let 
 them dry. 

To Take Ink out of Mahogany. — Mix in a teaspoon- 
 ful of cold water, a few drops of oil of vitriol ; touch the 
 spot with a feather dipped in the liquid. 

Fly Poison Without Arsenic. — The following pre- 
 paration is much used in Europe for the destruction of 
 flies: — Quassia, eight parts; water, five hundred parts ; 
 molasses, one hundred and twenty-five parts. Boil the 
 quassia and water ten minutes : strain and add the mo- 
 lasses. The preparation can easily be made by any one. 
 Flies are attracted bv this and soon killed. 

Tomatoes and Lima Beans. 

We commend the following paragraphs, which we find 
 in the Working Farmer, to our gardeners In this lati- 
 tude the per centage is too high, but approximates the 
 truth : 

During the early part of the growth of these crops 
 the surface of the soil should be frequently disturbed. 
 When tomatoes have set their fruit, they should be shor- 
 tened in, and it may be deferred until the laigest of the 
 fruit is of half size, Avhen it may be readily observed 
 that ninety per cent, of the fruit is within eighteen inch- 
 es of the ground, while ninety per cent, of the vine or 
 bush is beyond that distance. The vines, therefore, 
 should be trimmed in within half an inch of the tomato 
 nearest the end of each ; — this will admit sun and air 
 freely, and although ten per cent, of the tomatoes th.at 
 might have grown will be taken away, still the remain- 
 ing portion will be greater in weight and measure, than 
 if the vine had not been shortened in. Tomatoes are 
 also several days earlier by this treatment, and therefore 
 bring a much higher price in the market. 

Lima bean vines are usually suffered to Avind them-
