THE FARM JOURNAL. 

[July 

in France, which introduced Guenon to the notice of the 
 public, I observe that Mr. Gowen speaks very contemp- 
 tuously of the chairman of one of those committees, 
 ■whom he styles "a horse doctor, yclept a veterinary sur- 
 geon." Is Mr. Gowen aware that in France a veteri- 
 nary surgeon is a man of respectability, and stands upon 
 the same footing as the medical practitioner — 'both be- 
 ing well vci'sed in that science which has of late so much 
 unveiled thr spriiigs of animal life, viz: comparative 
 anatomy ? Notwithstanding Mr. Gowen's sneers at 
 ''horse doctors," I imagine the world will have some re- 
 spect for the opinions of men whose anatomical knowl- 
 edge has divulged facts of which be is not likely to be 
 very conversant. 

The suggestions I made to the State Agricultural So- 
 ciety, in a former communication, to establish a veteri- 
 nary college, which, I repeat, is so much wanted, that it 
 would be of more immediate benefit to the farmer than 
 the proposed farm school, which will be on so small a 
 scale, from present prospects, as to confine its usefulness 
 to rather contracted limits. H. SHUBERT.

Lice on Chickens. 

Mr. Editor : — Yoxir correspondent P. G., in the June 
 number of the "Journal," enquires "how lice on chick- 
 ens can be destroyed," and although the subject has 
 long since been exhausted, I will give him my plan, 
 which, if i^roperly adhered to, will eflfect the object de- 
 sired. In the first place I put into the box intended for 
 hatching, a layer of ashes, either leached or not, three 
 or four inches deep, and when I take the hen from the 
 nest I give her a thorough greasing with lard over the 
 lower part of the body and under the wings. On cover- 
 ing the chicks enough lard is imparted to them for all 
 practical purposes. I again repeat the dose in about 
 ten days, which is generally sufficient. 

After taking the hen from the nest, I am also particu- 
 lar in destroying the straw tipon which she may have 
 set. Other precautions are also necessary. White wash- 
 ing the roosting department, sprinkling lime under the 
 roosts, greasing the chickens if they become droopy, 
 and greasing the roosting poles with lard, or some rancid 
 grease, occasionally I have found highly essential, and if 
 properly and rigidly attended to, I think our friend P. 
 G. will have but little room to complain of the depreda- 
 tions of vermin on chickens. I have raised as high as 
 130 in a season in a yard not exceeding 20 feet square, 
 and have found no difficulty in mastering the vermin 
 when I set myself about it. Yours truly,

A Valuable Cow. 
 Daniel Miles, residing in East IMarlborough, Ches- 
 ter county, has a cow of native breed, weighing nett 
 four hundred and fifty pounds, that produces fortj'-four 
 pounds of milk per da}', and from one week's milking 
 recently made sixteen pounds of marketable butter. 
 This large yield was not the result of heavy grain feed- 
 ing, but simply from his pasture fields, and there is no 
 reason to suppose she will produce less per week for 
 many weeks to come. Indeed Mr. Miles confidently 

expects, when the pasture is at full maturity, that she 
 will increase rather than diminish her yield. Wc hope 
 he will keep a record of the produce of this cow during 
 the season, and let us have it to lay before the readers 
 of the Journal.

Tax on Breeding Stock, 

Mr. Editor : — I notice in a late number of the Jour- 
 nal that Mr. Daniel Baird, of Mexxer, is making objec- 
 tions to that part of the I'esolutions relating to the levying 
 a tax on male stock that are kept to breed from, which 
 passed our Agricultural Society, and recommending in its 
 place that inducements be held out by the State and 
 County Agricultural Societies, to townships and clubs to 
 purchase bulls, rams and boars of good breeds. In reply 
 to Mr. Baird I would say that it is the very object I 
 had in view iu bringing that resolution before our Socie- 
 ty. I can't conceive that there can be any inducement 
 for a person to purchase good seed stock at high prices 
 until we have a law that will remove our scrubby ani- 
 mals. The more I thmk on the subject the stronger I 
 am convinced that the levying a suitable tax on all male 
 seed stock, would have the eti:'ect of soon replacing infe- 
 rior animals by those of superior breeds and quality, 
 and would prove to be a very essential advantage to the 
 farming interest, and secure to the treasury a handsome 
 fund. In our county there would be needed about eighty 
 bulls; put a tax on them of ten dollars each, it would 
 bring into the treasury a fund of eight hundred dollars 
 annually ; it would require about forty stallions, a tax 
 on them of fifteen dollars each would amount to six 
 hundred dollars ; about- eighty boars would be required, 
 a tax of five dollars on each of them would amount to 
 four hundred dollars ; and one hundred rams taxed two 
 dollars each would amount to two hundred dollars. 
 These sums put together show an amoimt of two thou- 
 sand dollars, which would be secured to our county 
 treasury annually, and if caiTied to all the counties in 
 the State, it would secure to the treasury of the Com- 
 monwealth about one hundred and twenty thousand dol- 
 lars annually — and I think it would be very acceptable 
 there, at least till we get rid of our State debt — and the 
 advantage that would be derived by the raisers of stock 
 would be almost beyond calculation. 

Mr. Baird correctly remarks that there is more profit 
 in raising one good animal than there is in raising two or 
 three poor ones of inferior breeds. If we were to make 
 a calculation from that statement to show the advantage 
 in raising stock of superior bi-eeds, it would overreach 
 one hundred dollars on an average to each farmer annu- 
 ally, and I think if the farming community was con- 
 vinced of that fsxct, our stock would be improved in a 
 very short time. The attempt has been made at differ- 
 ent times to improve the stock of this neighborhood. 
 Messrs. J. & S. Potters have purchased bulls of good 
 quality frequently, and loaned them to their neighbors, 
 but owing to the scrubby animals running our public 
 highways breaking fences into fields, they accomplish 
 but little; here and there there is a cross of them, but 
 the blood is now so much mixed thej^ are scarcely dis- 
 cernible.
