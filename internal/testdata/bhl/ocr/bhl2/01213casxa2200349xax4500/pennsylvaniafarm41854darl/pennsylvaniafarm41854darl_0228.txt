unnecessary pains ; with such I will have no controversy. I 
 will only say to them, try your kind of breaking, or rather 
 no break or gait at all, with a thoroughly-broken horse on 
 the road, and satisfy yourselves. I am confident that who- 
 ever will follow ray mode of breaking will feel themselves 
 well paid for their trouble. I am well satisfied that there 
 are many that would have been valuable horses ; but, for the 
 want of thorough and proper training, they have become 
 nearly worthless. There are some persons who have not a 

suitable horse to break a colt with. When this is the case, 
 it would be better for the owner to put his colt into the 
 hands of some man who has the proper means to do it. I 
 have broken a number of colts and never had one that 
 proved unkind in my hands. Some^of them were very met- 
 tled animals. AVith such much care is necessary in train- 
 ing. Such horses are generally much more to be depended 
 upon when they are broken. — Patent Office Report. 

LAPHAM'S PATENT CULTIVATOR. 

The annexed cut represents an improved form of Cul- 
 tivator, (for two horses,) adapted for working among 
 corn and other growing crops ; also for preparing land 
 for wheat, &c. It is the invention of the late Seneca 
 Lapham, of Champaign county, Ohio, and possesses 
 several important advantages over other implements of 
 the kind in use in this country. 

By means of two long levers — one connected to the 
 axle or shaft which supports the machine, and to which 
 the wheels are hung, and the other to the tongue, to 
 ■which the team is attached — the cultivating teeth can he 
 raised or lowered, to suit the unevenness of the ground, 
 and the machine directed independently of the team, by 
 the person driving, and walking behind. 

When a depression or elevation renders it necess.ary 
 to change the depth of the teeth, by raising the lever 
 •which is attached to .the axle, the teetli are lowered, or, 
 by lowering the lever, the teeth are raised ; and when it 
 is desirable to change quickly the direction of the ma- 
 chine, to avoid an obstruction, or a hill of corn or pota- 
 toes, by moving the lever connected with the tongue, the 
 cultivator is readily turned, without the trouble and de- 
 lay of guiding the team. 

When it is desir.able to use this machine for cultiva- 
 ting young corn, the front tooth is removed and mould 
 boards affixed, which will prevent the earth from cover- 
 ing the corn, while the teeth break the soil and destroy 
 the weeds ; or, by placing the boards in a different posi- 

tion, earth may be thrown around the corn. 

Suitable devices are provided for retaining the levers 
 in place, and for rendering their motion easy. 

Any information respecting this Cultivator can be ob- 
 tained by addressing the Patentee, Wm. Lapham, West 
 Liberty, Logan county, Ohio.

A Wash for the Hair. 

Mr. Editor : — I observe a large number of patent 
 preparations advertised, warranted to promote the growth 
 and beauty of the hair, preventing its turning grey, re- 
 storing it, &c., most of which are absolutely prejudicial 
 to health. Now, with your permission, I will give you a 
 recipe which is in the reach of all, which will prevent 
 the hair falling out or turning grey, and besides will 
 prevent its becoming offensive. It is simply Castile soap 
 and ivater, applied once a week in warm weather and 
 about once a month in cold. This preparation cleanses 
 the hair, removes dandruff, scruf, great sweat and other 
 impurities, and besides promoting hcaltli and comfort it 
 removes all offensive odors from the hair. The writer of 
 this recently sat in a railroad car with a finely dressed 
 lady, whose head smelled so strongly as to be offensive 
 to all in the car. She informed a friend of mine that 
 she had put cologne, pomatum, bear's oil and other pre- 
 parations on her head in the hope of "killing the smell," 
 but it was of no use. Nothing but soap and water will 
 do it. ■ T. M.
