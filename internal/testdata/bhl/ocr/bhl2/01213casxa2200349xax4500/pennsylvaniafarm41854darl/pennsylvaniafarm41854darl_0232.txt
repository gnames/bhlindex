shall deem meritorious, but beyond their power to award 
 a premium to, they will furnish a note of the same to 
 the Committee on Discretionary Premiums, for their con- 
 sideration and action. 

No animal or article can take more than one premium. 
 All productions placed in competition for premiums must 
 be the growth of the competitors. 

When there is but one exhibitor, although he may 
 show several animals in a class or sub-division of a class, 
 only one premium will be awarded ; that to be the first, 
 or otherwise, as the merit of the animal or article may 
 be adjudged. And a premium will not be awarded, 
 when the animal or article is not worthy, though there 
 be no competition. In any case the person to whom a 
 pecuniary premium may have been awarded, may elect 
 to accept a diploma instead thereof. 

Superintendents. — It is expected that the Superin- 
 tendents will take particular direction of all articles in 
 their respective departments, and see that all such arti- 
 cles are arranged, as near as may be, in some numerical 
 order, for their easy approach and examination. 

Plowing Match. — The Plowing Match will take place 
 on Friday, the 29th, at 9 o'clock, A. M., in a field adja- 
 cant to the place of exhibition. Persons competing in 
 the plowing match are requested to have their teams 
 hitched, and ready to move off' at the appointed hour. 

The Address. — The Annual Address will be delivered 
 at 1 o'clock, P. M., on Friday, the 29th of September ; 
 and immediately after the address, the Reports of the 
 Viewing Committees or Judges will be read, and the pre- 
 miums awarded and distributed. 

Hay and Str.\w. — Hay and straw will be furnished 
 gratis for all animals entered for premiums, and grain 
 will be provided, at lowest cost price, for those who de- 
 sire to purchase. 

Payment of Premiums. — The Premiums awarded will 
 be paid by the Treasurer at his office on the grounds till 
 the close of the day, and on Saturday at the same place. 
 All cash premiums will be then paid and delivered if 
 called for. 

Pei'sons to whom premiums have been awarded are in- 
 formed that imless they call for their premiums at the 
 Fair, application must be made, by letter, to the Treas- 
 urer, George H. Bucher, at Hogestown, Cumberland 
 county, with whom the Book of Awards will be left. 
 Persons to whom medals and silver plate have been 
 awarded will please furnish their names to the Record- 
 ing Secretary', in order that the engraving of names may 
 be properly done. 

The Secretary will forward the Diplomas awarded in 
 such manner as may be directed by the persons entitled 
 to receive them. 

The Reports of the Judges will be published by the 
 Society, as soon after the Fair as practicable. 

Notice to Exhibitors. — The Executive Committee 
 will take every precaution in their power for the safety 
 of stock and articles on exhibition, after their arrival 
 and arrangement upon the grounds ; but will not be re- 
 sponsible for any loss or damage that may occur. They 
 desire exhibitors to give personal attention to their arti- 
 cles and animals, and at the close of the Fair to attend 
 to their removal. 

Mr. John Clark, of Arch street, above Broad, Phila- 

delphia, has been appointed General Superintendent of 
 the Exhibition, to whose care all ai'ticles intended for 
 exhibition and not accompanied by the exhibitor must be 
 directed. R. C. Walker, Sec'y. 

Fair Grounds, RegTilations for the Fair and Exhibition 
 of the Pennsylvania State Agricultural Society. 

AVe are happy to be able to announce that the Fourth 
 Annual Exhibition of the Pennsylvania State Agricultu- 
 ral Society will be held on the Powelton and Bingham 
 estates, at the tenninus of the Columbia Railroad, in 
 what was recently West (now City of) Philadelphia. 
 The grounds are eminently suited for the display, while 
 in facility of access by public communication the loca- 
 tion is probably unequalled by any spot in the State. 

Removal — Agricultural Reading Room, &c. 
 Since the issue of our last number, we have removed 
 to our NEW OFFICE on High street, one door south of 
 the Agricultural Warehouse, where we shall be happy to 
 see our friends from far and near. The office of the 
 Chester County Agricultural Society is in the same 
 building. All the principal Agricultural Journals pub- 
 lished in America, as well as some foreign ones, will be 
 kept on file in this office for the perusal of the members 
 of the Agricultural Society. We trust our friends hav- 
 ing an hour's leisure when in town will be able to find 
 this a pleasant and profitable retreat. 

Annual Exhibition of the Chester County Agricultural 
 Society. 
 The Executive Committee of the Chester County Agri- 
 cultural Society met at the office of the Society on the 
 18th ult., and fixed the time for holding the Annual Ex- 
 hibition on Friday and Saturday, the 8th and 9th days 
 of September. The committee meet again on the 1st of 
 August, when the final arrangaments will be made. The 
 exhibition will probably be held in Everhart's Grove in 
 this borough. 

Growing Strawberries. 

We hear from various quarters of failures of straw- 
 berry crops, in some cases where extraordinary care and 
 labor had been bestowed. One of our friends put out a 
 large bed last spring, trenched the soil two spades deep, 
 manivred heavily, and has literally no fniit this sea- 
 son. 

As enquiries are often made of us on this subject, we 
 may remark that we entirely agree with No. 8 in the 
 pronunciamento, in our present number, of the Cincin- 
 nati Horticultural Society. Whatever diflferences of 
 opinion there may be as to the possibility of their being 
 a strawberry from a pistillate blossom, without the in- 
 fluence of staminates, there is none, we believe, as to 
 the necessity of the latter to produce a full crop of fruit. 
 We recommend that beds of pistillates be set out, and at 
 certain intervals between a single row of staminates. 
 These latter are apt to overgrow the others, and should 
 be watched closely, and all runners cut off. Their blos- 
 soms only are wanted for fertilization. One staminate is 
 sufficient for twenty pistillates. Sometimes the entire 
 failure of a strawberry crop is owing, as we think it may 
 have been this season, to late frosts, but is much oftener
