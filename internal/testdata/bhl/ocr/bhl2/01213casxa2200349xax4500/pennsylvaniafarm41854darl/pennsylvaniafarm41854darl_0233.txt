Strawberry Question and Ad Interim Report. 

The following paragraphs of the proceedings of a sta- 
 ted meeting of the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society, 
 held February 21st, 1854, appear to have been accident- 
 ally omitted in the report published in the Farm Journal 
 about that time. Our attention has now been called to 
 them in connection with an observation in T. Meehan's 
 article on the Strawberry Question, that that part of the 
 Ad Interim Report had been "rejected" by the Society. 
 It appears only to have been referred back for reconsid- 
 eration. The omitted extracts from the minutes are as 
 follows : 

'•The Fruit Committee made their Ad Interim Report, 
 a portion of which, relating to the Strawberry question, 
 was objected to by Mr. Cope, and upon his motion re- 
 ferred back to the committee with instructions to recon- 
 sider the subject thereof, and report after the next 
 Strawberry season. 

"Some remarks were made by Mr. Haksox, and on his 
 motion it was resolved, that the subject of the change- 
 ableness or otherwise of the sexual organs of the Straw- 
 berry be referred to the Committee of Botany." 

Superphosphate of Lime. 

The above fertilizer, manufactured by Prof. Mapes 
 (being the article chiefly used in this section, others as 
 j^et not having been much tried,) is confirming this sea- 
 son its previous high reputation. For wheat, grass and 
 corn it has been found equally valuable, and some of our 
 farmers who have made extensive use of it prefer it to 
 guano. One of them informs us that he experimented in 
 ditferent parts of his corn field, in alternate sections in 
 the hills, with Mapes' superphosphate, ashes and plaster, 
 guano, bone dust, and manure from the henery, proper- 
 ly composted. Its singular appearance, of various col- 
 ors and height, attracted much attention of passers-by — 
 the part where the superphosphate had been applied in 
 the hill and the corn di'opped on it being considerably 
 ahead of any other portion. 

Its effects have been particularly striking on pastures 
 and mowing ground, and we know of no application 
 equal to it, from our own observation of its effects, to 
 renovate and fertilize such fields and lawns where the 
 grass has run out, and where it would be inexpedient to 
 plow it up. We have latterly also heard it very highly 
 spoken of by those who have tried it as a manure for 
 pear trees, slightly dug in around the trunk. 

One kind of manure for all soils, and under all cir- 
 cumstances, is hai'dl}' more rational than one kind of 
 medicine for all diseases. What Mapes' superphosphate 
 of lime has done, within our knowledge, in three or four 
 counties around Philadelphia it may not do everywhere 
 else, but we advise those farmers, who require something 
 more than their barnyards can yield them, and who can 
 obtain it, to buy a portion the present season. 

suited from a scarcity of vessels, as is alleged, or wheth- 
 er with a view to enable speculators, with heavy stocks 
 on hand, to realize fortunes at the expense of the far- 
 mer, and in an article now considered almost indispensa- 
 ble, we are unable to say. It is a matter we tliink re- 
 quiring the interposition of government to place the 
 guano trade on a different and more permanent footing. 
 Could not a treaty be made with Peru, by which, on the 
 payment of a stipulated sum, and under any reasonable 
 restrictions, the trade should be opened to any one to 
 send a vessel at his own risk, and obtain a cargo. 

An immense outlay has been made for a commercial 
 treaty with Japan, and why should not the farming in- 
 terests, in a matter of such importance as the supply of 
 guano, be attended to. After enquiry all we can learn 
 is, that "the subject is claiming the attention of govei-n- 
 ment." This has been the report from Washington for 
 a long time, and nothing else is known, but with the 
 very great anticipated demand for the coming crop of 
 wheat in the fall, it is time something should be done. 
 Thei'e is reason to fear that in this country, no less than 
 in England, an adulterated article is often sold. We 
 copy the following letter from the English Agricultural 
 Gazette, as to the extent of the business of adulteration 
 there : 

"Will you allow me to call your serious attention to 
 the extensive adulteration which is just now being prac- 
 tised by the dealers in guano ? Few people are aware 
 to what an extent this nefarious business is carried on, 
 nor how deeply many credulous farmers are fleeced. It 
 is true that some of them are becoming awake on the 
 subject, and show a good deal of skill in protecting 
 themselves : but the bulk of them sufl'er unsuspectingly. 
 I knew a case where two brothers bought of one dealer 
 out of the same cargo; one used all his quantity, the 
 other kept a bag. When pay-day came, the first-named 
 paid in full ; the other demm-red, expressed doubts 
 about the genuineness of the guano, thought he should 
 have it analysed. I need not pursue the story further 
 than to say, that, rather than have any enquiry institu- 
 ted, the scoundrel of a dealer took half the amount of 
 the bill and settled it in full. 

"Another course has recently been adopted. Rascally 
 firms in London get respectable tradesmen to become 
 their agents in the country, and through them distribute 
 worthless trash for Peruvian guano. Recentlj- a friend 
 of mine bought a parcel in this way, price £12 per ton, 
 cash down. Some doubts having arisen as to the article 
 being genuine, it was submitted to Professor Way, and 
 his analysis was as per copy inclosed :
