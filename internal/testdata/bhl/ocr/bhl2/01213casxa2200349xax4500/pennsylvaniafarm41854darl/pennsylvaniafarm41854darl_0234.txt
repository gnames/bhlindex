Eeaping and Mowing Machines. 

The demand for these the present season has far ex- 
 ceeded what was considered the too sanguine expecta- 
 tions of manufacturers, and many farmers in all sections 
 of the country, whose minds were not made up early to 
 purchase, find it impossible to be supplied. 

One agricultural house in Philadelphia, Paschall Mor- 
 ris & Co., have sold nearly 200 machines, and many oth- 
 'Crs have no doubt been disposed of at other places. Of 
 mowing machines alone, Allen's and Ketchum's have 
 been most sought for, and so far as we have heard up to 
 this present time have given general satisfaction. As 
 regards combined reapers and mowers, public opinion 
 seems to be more undecided. Manny's, McCormick's, 
 Hussey's, Atkins', and Seymour & Morgan's, (the last 
 two self rakers,) whose reputation is chiefly as reapers, 
 are also recommended for mowers, and the experience of 
 farmers this harvest will test whether a combination for 
 both reaping and mowing has yet been made, which will 
 give entire satisfaction. We hope our friends in diiferent 
 sections of the State, so soon as hay and harvest time is 
 over, will write for the Farm Journal their experience 
 with these diiferent machines after trial. It is a matter 
 of considerable importance to be settled, which is the 
 best mowing machine, which is the best reaping ma- 
 chine, and which is the best combined reaper and mow- 
 er. AVe anticipate the demand next season will far ex- 
 ceed the present — many being deterred from purchasing 
 by the uncertainty as to which is the best. Will our 
 friends please write us as to the amount of work their 
 machines have performed in a day, their simplicity or 
 otherwise of construction, liability to get out of order, 
 ease of draft, names of manufacturers, &c., so that our 
 readers can have all the material to form correct conclu- 
 sions in the case. 

Fruit Prospects for 1854. 

It is almost impracticable, with such a variety of soil 
 and climate as exists in the United States, to collect re- 
 liable information as to the prospects for fruit. Since 
 railroad facilities have so greatly extended, a deficit sup- 
 ply in one section is immediately filled up from other 
 points, as was the case in Philadelphia last season with 
 apples : notwithstanding a great failure of the apple 
 crop in Pennsylvania aud other Atlantic States, the 
 Philadelphia market was probably never more abundant- 
 ly supplied. 

The present season, so far as we have heard, in Penn- 
 sylvania, Delaware, and many parts of Jersey, there is 
 another failure of the fruit crop, probably worse than 
 last year. The peach crop in Delaware will not make 
 more than half a crop. In this immediate section not 
 only will the apples be more scarce than has been 
 known for years, but also pears, peaches, cherries, and 
 the smaller fruits, gooseberries, strawberries, &c. The 
 disappointment is greater, as this is what is called the 
 fruit year. The cause is doubtless owing to the extra- 
 ordinary mild spell of weather very early in the spring 
 causing the flow of sap and premature swelling of tlie 
 buds, which were killed afterwards by the subsequent 

hard frosts and sleets. About the 1st of May, often so 
 very mild, there were one or two cold nights sufficient to 
 produce quite a layer of ice on the surface of the water. 
 This probably finished what had been left unhurt be- 
 fore. 

Every year proves that fruit culture is a business of 
 itself, requiring for success the same skill, foresight and 
 perseverance as any other. The watchful eye of the 
 fruit grower must be ever on the alert. The healthy 
 growth of trees, the excellent quality of fruit, the guard- 
 ing against insects, are matters to some extent within 
 our own control. The danger from late frosts, or mild 
 weather in mid winter is not so much so, but even this 
 may be regulated to some extent by choosing high ex- 
 posures where the air will circulate freely, (northern 
 ones are generally the best,) and also attention to shel- 
 ter. It is often expedient to have a sti'ip of woods on 
 the south side of an orchard. Kindling fires in difi"erent 
 parts of it, so as to cause a free circulation of smoke, 
 have also been found frequently a preventive of damage 
 from a hard frost. Let no one, however, be discouraged 
 from planting orchards. One thing is certain the eating 
 of fine fruit is not going out of fashion, and we know of 
 no application of land, speaking in a general way, that 
 offers equal remuneration, taking an average of five, ten 
 or twenty acres, as fruit culture. A single good j'ear 
 often pays for land, labor and other expenses. 

Alderney Stock. 
 Some fine animals of this kind were lately disposed of 
 at public sale by Dr. Gibson, on his farm near Philadel- 
 phia. We had hoped for particulars for this number of 
 the Farm Journal, but they have not arrived in time be- 
 fore going to press. We understand Aaeon Clement, 
 of Philadelphia, was one of the purchasers. 

Beapiug and Mowing Exhibition. 
 We obsei"ve a trial of reaping and mowing machines 
 is advertised to take place on the farm of William 
 Stavely, in Bucks county, on the 4th of July. A large 
 committee of practical fixrmers aud judges will be present 
 to decide on their respective merits, and the award will 
 be looked for with much interest. Manufactm-ers should 
 avail themselves of these opportunities for exhibition, 
 and we hope there will be one of each kind on trial. 
 $20 is offered for the best mower ; $20 for the best 
 reaper ; aud $20 for the best mower and reaper com- 
 bined. 

Canada Thistle. 

Me. Editor : — Since we have commenced taking the 
 Journal in the club (Fork's township farmers' club. No. 1), 
 we find that you are so obliging as sometimes to give 
 your opinion to perplexed mortals, and answer the en- 
 quiries of subscribers. We wish to ask your opinion upon 
 the matter below: 

"Is there any chemical agent that will permanently 
 eradicate the Canada Thistle, or are there any other 
 means of destroying it permanentlj-." 

Our reasons for asking the above questions are these : 
 There is a gentleman in our neighborhood who has a so- 
 called Eradicator, which he says will destroy them per- 
 manently. It is a white powder, but what the name of it
