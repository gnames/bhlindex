Is we do not know. It seems to have a caustic effect, 
 for by cutting off tLe top of the thistle and applying it 
 to the cut surface of the root, it immediately dries it up 
 as it were, and which he affirms will totally eradicate it. 
 Now is there any chemical agent that has that effect. 
 One of the undersigned has a small farm, but unfortu- 
 nately the Canada thistle, by some means or other, has 
 taken root there, and as he wishes to have them ex- 
 purged from the farm, if possible, he has come to you 
 to ask your advice. He would be willing to employ the 
 gentleman above alluded to, and pay him his prices 
 (which are not very moderate), but he would like to be 
 sure that when they are once eradicated that they would 
 stay so. Please inform us in your next issue of the 
 Journal if there is any agent, chemical or otherwise, 
 that has that effect, and what it is. By doing which you 
 will greatly oblige your friends, JOHN RAHR, 

Easton, June 8, 1854. W. H. SEIP. 

We hope our friend W. H. S. will not pay any thing 
 for the alleged chemical discovery. We have no faith 
 in any specific of this kind against the Canada thistle, 
 which will Yid practically available, or will not cost more 
 than it will come to. There are a great many chemical 
 agents, which will not only kill Canada thistle, but grass, 
 weeds and every thing else, but it won't pay to apply 
 them on an extensive scale. To cut the plant down and 
 apply salt immediately in sufficient quantity, will also 
 kill the thistle as well as most other plants, and we 
 would trust to this with as much confidence as any other 
 . chemical application, where it is found only in occasion- 
 - al spots, and is not widely spread. 

When this latter is the case, nothing but constantly 
 mowing or cutting down wherever it shows itself, togeth- 
 er with a system of continued plowing and cropping, will 
 answer. Plants cannot live without light and air. If 
 krjH under the surface they must dwindle and die. They 
 grow and turn towards these as naturally as water down 
 hill. As a general rule, all nostrums, specifics and secret 
 processes, such as the above, may be safely discarded. 
 They are money making speculations and nothing more. 
 Agricultural and horticultural pursuits are so ennobling 
 and elevating in their tendencies, that the scientific in- 
 vestigator who has been fortunate to discover any of the 
 secret processes of vegetable life, which will have the 
 effect of making two blades of grass grow instead of one, 
 and thus benefitting the whole race, rejoices at an op- 
 portunity of being a public benefactor. This is entirely 
 different from a display of inventive genius, as in the 
 case of improved machinery, and where a man is very 
 properly- and fairly entitled to the reward of his labors. 
 In the growth of plants, it should be recollected we are 
 but discoverers. There is no invention. 

Hnman Excrement as a Manure. 
 While the earth is raked from one end to the other for 
 fertilizers, and all the ingenuity is put in operation to 
 manufacture them, the most important of all manures is 
 thoughtlessly wasted. Not only in all our large cities 
 and towns, over the whole width and breadth of this 
 country, but on most of the farms themselves, the hu- 
 man excrements are cither dsposited into deep excava- 
 tions in the ground and when full covered with earth, cr 

into streams to be carried away. Is not this a most un- 
 reasonable course and the worst of policy, especially 
 while millions are annually paid by the farmers to 
 obtain the elements of fertility for their exhausted 
 fields ? 

Could not the people of this Republic be urged to 
 study the common good of all ? the soil would certainly 
 remunerate them richly for it in the case in question. 
 All the efforts that can enter the minds of men are made 
 to take from the soil to its utmost, the grain, the beef, 
 the pork, &c., are carried to market, in this and all the 
 other States in the Union, and that is the last. The land 
 is thus robbed of all the elements of fertility without any 
 restitution. 

One scarcely knows how to propose a plan for saving 
 and deodorizing the elements above alluded to, without 
 incurring the sneers and abuses of ignorance, but if stu- 
 pidity can find delight in it, let it do so. 

Why cannot every family in the country have a fish- 
 barrel cut through the middle, with convenient handles 
 fastened to it, and pushed under the back-house, and 
 keep a supply of pulverized charcoal and ground plaster 
 to fix the azotic matter (both well known fertilizers), and 
 then carry it on the barnyard manure heap, or apply it 
 in such a form as seems best to them. And why cannot 
 city and town authorities pass ordinances regulating the 
 erection and arrangement of these buildings, with mova- 
 ble vessels, and cheap and suitable deodorizers, and em- 
 ploying persons to empty those vessels at stated periods, 
 or whenever it becomes necessary, carting their contents 
 under roofs a short distance out of the inhabited por- 
 tions of cities and towns, where it could be prepared for 
 the use of the farmer and gardener, and conveyed on 
 their grounds? It would be a considerable source of 
 revenue, besides a removal of the seeds of disease and 
 infection from cities and towns. Almost everybody can 
 testify to the fact that the apartments in question are 
 sometimes entered with the greatest difficulty, and that 
 the olfactory nerves are so shockingly attacked, that one 
 sometimes feels disposed to commit a little more than 
 was intended should take place, in fact it is almost im- 
 possible to enter without departing sick from those mis- 
 erable nuisances. But the person or town council es- 
 tablishing this reform would likely suffer from ignorant 
 stupid, slandering tongues. No sooner, however, than 
 its beneficial results would be felt, than the people would 
 be unwilling to dispense with such arrangements. 

A little plain reasoning on this subject can do no 
 harm. Is not the very food that we consume the pro- 
 duct of similar substances, and vice versa ? Why then 
 this foolish disgust and contemptible nicety about a fer- 
 tilizer so important to the community at large ?

 conditions is it modified, and what is destruetive of it? The
