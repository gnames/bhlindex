ring long periods of time, in which the question, "do thoy | 
 pay," or "will they pay," frequently engages his thoughts, 
 but as to the question how they will pay, or fur what reason 
 thej' will pay, it seldom or never enters his tuind. 

Why will a hundred pounds of guano produce a greater 
 increase in a crop of wheat than an equal amount of sand? 
 Such a question is not generally a subject of thought with 
 the farmer, if it does produce a greater crop it is enough to 
 know this fact, and the article is used accordingly. 

'Tis true a knowledge of the practical use of a thing is of 
 vast importance ; but we never can learn all the practical 
 uses of any thing till we can ascertain the real nature of the 
 thing, and the cause of its being practical. So when we 
 learn what vegetable growth consists of, what is essential to 
 it, and study the relation of lime, manures, &e., to it, we will 
 be prepared to judge more correctly of how far we are to de- 
 pend upon certain manures to insure a crop. 

To look for a moment at the process of vegetable growth 
 throughout the entire period of its existence, we will select 
 as an example the common Indian corn, which, if not the 
 best for illustration, is certainly tho best adapted to the time 
 of year, and the present labor of the Pennsylvania farmer. 
 Vt'hat is the earliest stage of growth in which we can observe 
 the corn plant ? It is not at the period of its first coming 
 up through the corn hill, nor is it even at the time of ger- 
 uiination, but in the hard grain tho cornstalk in miniature 
 i-esides. 

The grain consists of two parts, an organized structure en- 
 dowed with a vital principle, and a nutritious deposit which 
 constitutes the solid part of the grain. The organized struc- 
 ture is the soft part selected by mice as food ; and when the 
 mouse eats out the "eye" of the grain, it in reality eats a 
 stalk of corn, with stem, leaves and all. This organic struc- 
 ture first came into existence while its parent stalk was "out 
 in silk." Every grain has a fibre of silk extending to its 
 destined locality. A small portion of dust from the "tassel" 
 falls on the silk, and is conveyed down the latter to a very 
 small sack within which is contained a mucilaginous mass; the 
 dusty (now moistened) material is absorbed through the sub- 
 stance of this sack, and coming in contact with the matter 
 thereof the vital principle of the stalk originates, and un- 
 der its influence the entire plant is developed. This plant 
 as truly grows from this time to that of the ripening of the 
 grain as does the parent stalk that bears it. Around it is 
 deposited a hard mass which is principally composed of 
 starch, the use of which we shall presently see. 

When the grain is ripe the growth of this embrio plant is 
 arrested, and can be kept at this point of its partly finished 
 growth a long time. (All authors on botany mention cases 
 of seeds preserving this vital principle thousands of years, 
 so that at the expiration of this time when planted they 
 grew.) As soon as the little plant thus enclosed in the seed 
 is placed in suitable circumstances it continues its course of 
 development, the greatest object of which is to produce other 
 organized structures like itself. These "suitable circum- 
 stances" are a certain degree of warmth, not less than 45° 
 or more than 113° for our ordinary plants as wheat, rj'e, 
 oats, &c.,* air and moisture. 

The plant wants the last two agents in order to convert its 
 starch into sugar; until this is done it cannot germinate. 
 The water is absorbed from the moisture that is always pre- 
 :seut in a good soil, and the air penetrates the earth so as to 
 supply the requisite amount of its elements. 

The grain absorbs oxygen from the air at the same time, 
 that its integuments are softened by the absorption of water; 

*Experiment has shown the Indian corn can be heated 18 
 degrees higher than the above mentioned plant seeds with- 
 out destroying its vitality. 

at this period, a peculiar substance (diastase) combining ni- 
 trogen appears in the grain, and through its influence the 
 starch is transformed first into dextrine and then into sugar; 
 the presence of the latter causes the sweet taste of the ger- 
 minating grain. Starch and dextrine have the same com- 
 position, and sugar only differs from them in chemical com- 
 position by having a little more of the elements of water. 

The embryo plant, now surrounded by sugar, resumes its 
 growth, but it no longer receives its nutriment from the pa- 
 rent stalk, but from the rich share of material which the 
 parent stalk has stored up for it in its earlj- existence, before 
 it is able to derive any thing from the soil or the air. 

The first efibrt is to get organs developed suitable for de- 
 riving nutriment from the air and earth, accordingly the 
 root i)enctrates the soil, and the stem soon has two leaves 
 spread out above the corn hill to collect nutriment from the 
 air. 

Thus far it has subsisted on the product of the decomposi- 
 tion of the starch in the grain, but this being exhausted an- 
 other process of nutrition commences, viz : that of .absorb- 
 ing water and such inorganic constituents as are dissolved 
 therein at the roots, and carbonic acid in the leaves. At 
 this third period of its existence, it presents its most inter- 
 esting and important character for the consideration of the 
 scientific farmer. 

We have seen that in germinating the plant must have 
 water. It would be well to remark here, that the practice of 
 spreading hot, caustic, unslacked lime on land, particularly 
 in a dry season, and then planting it in grain immediately 
 afterwards, is decidedly injudicious, as the hot lime absorbs 
 all the moisture and combines with it, which otherwise might 
 have been obtained by the grain. 

With respect to the inorganic materials, which the plant 
 takes up at its root, the quantity and quality of the same 
 that are required by the plant, has been a source of no small 
 degree of difference in opinion among chemists and vegeta- 
 ble physiologists. 

When chemical analysis was first applied to the investi- 
 gation of this subject, much more was anticipated from its 
 results than was possible to realize. The farmer got the 
 idea in many instances — indeed the chemist was not without 
 it — that with a knowledge of the composition of the soil and 
 that of the grain he would raise on it, and the different kinds 
 of manures, he could take slate and pencil and caluculate 
 how much manure was required to raise a given croji. 
 But as soil analyses and ash analyses multiplied, a thousand 
 conditional circumstances were found to modify the re- 
 sult. 

The ash of plants was found to vary so much as to lead 
 some to coucludo that its presence was merely accidert'il in 
 tho plant. Others charged the re-actions upon the imperfect 
 method of analysis; and many chemists gave up the prose- 
 cution of the subject as not being sufficiently definite to 
 allow of satisfactory conclusions. It is now admitted that 
 nearly all the earlier analyses of plants are not to be relied 
 upon for accuracy. Modern investigations curried out on a 
 large scale, and with greater care, and the use of better 
 methods, are leading to highly interesting results, which 
 promise to be of vast importance to tho agriculturist. 

These investigations consist of learning the composition of 
 inorganic constituents of each of the several organs of the 
 plant in the different periods of its growth, when it grows 
 on different soils, or with an excess of different kinds of ma- 
 nure supplied to it. Regard must also be had to the weath- 
 er, and indeed all the circumstances tending to influence or 
 modify vegetable growth. 

It is a subject that never can be satisfactorily settled till 
 we have a country of scientific farmers ; men who under-
