stand the seieutific nature of the operations by which they 
 obtain their practical results. The future promises fairly to 
 produce such a class in the United States. 

The present state of our knowledge, with regard to inor- 
 ganic coustituents of plants, is such as to lead to the con- 
 clusions, that there is a certain amount of inorganic matter 
 required by plants, without which they cannot grow. 

That this inorganic matter is liable to considerable varia- 
 tion, both in the kind of matter and the amount of the 
 same j that these changes are due to cultivation, the nature 
 of the soil, and the healthy or diseased state of the plant. 
 Further, substances are taken into the plant, and are found 
 in its ashes (the inorganic part) that are essential to its 
 growth, but that arc taken in as the mere result of accident, 
 just as the sand and mud are taken into the stomach of the 
 OS. when he drinks muddy water. 

Now how are we to ascertain what substances are really 
 essential to the growth of the plant? If analysis should 
 detect grains of sand in the stomach of an ox, we would bo 
 at no loss to decide that they were not necessary to his 
 nutrition ; but when we find in the plant potash, soda, lime, 
 magnesia, alumina, iron, copper, &c., how are we to tell which 
 of them stand in the same relation to the nutritious plant of 
 the group as the sand does to the corn and hay in the sto- 
 mach of the ox ? 

Again : the ox can have one kind of food substituted for 
 another. How far can such substitution take place amongst 
 vegetables? These questions are of vast importance to the 
 agriculturist, and as yet they are not satisfactorily answered. 
 Liobig supposes potash and soda could replace each other, 
 ay also could lime and magnesia. Such a supposition is con- 
 sistent with the known chemical relations of these bodies, 
 and the facts of early analysis seemed in a measure to cor- 
 roborate it, but these analyses have to a great extent proved 
 inaccurate ; and those of a later date go to show that soda 
 plays a very insignificant part in the plant, so much so that 
 in many cases its presence appears to be merely accidental, 
 as we shall see hereafter. 

Lime is an important constituent, but seems to act prin- 
 cipally as a secondary agent in fitting other materials for the 
 plant. It is in but small quantity in our ordinary crops, as 
 may be seen by the following analysis of the ash of 100 
 bushels of each of the following grains : 

Wheat, 115 lbs. ash, of which about 4 lbs. are lime. 
 Oats, 104 lbs. do do do 6 do do 
 Eye, 104 lbs. do do do 3 do do 

But more of this hereafter, in the meantime think of four 
 lbs. of lime for 100 bushels of wheat, and ask where all the 
 lime goes that farmers put on land. E. P. 

THE aUAIL, OR PARTRIDGE. 

Can the rartridge he domesticated? 

Alexander AVilson, the p:reat American Ornitholo- 
 pi.^t, tlius flipcourses upon tliis topic : â€” The eggs of the 
 Quail have been frequently placed under the domestic 
 hen, and hatched and reared with equ.al success .ns her 
 own ; though, generally speaking, the young Partridges 
 heing more restless and vagrant, often lose themselves, 
 and dissappear. The hen ought to be a particularly good 
 nurse, not at all disposed to ramble, in which case they 
 are very easily raised. Those that survive, acquire all 
 the familiarity of common chickens; and there is little 
 dou1)t that if proper measures were taken, and perse- 
 vered in for a few years, that they might be completely 
 domesticated. They liave often been kept during the 
 first season, and through the whole of the winter, but 
 have uniformly deserted in the spring. Two young Par- 
 tridges that were brought up by a hen, when abandoned 
 15 

by her, associated with the cows, which they regularly 
 followed to the fields, returned with them when they 
 came home in the evening, stood by them while they 
 were milked, and again accompanied them to the pas- 
 ture. These remained during the winter, lodging in the 
 stable, but as soon as spring came they disappeared. Of 
 this fact I was informed by a very respectable lady, by 
 whom thoy were particularly observed. 

It has been frequently asserted to me, that the Quails 
 lay occasionally in each others nests. Though I have 
 never myself seen a case of this kind, I do not think it 
 altogether improbable, from the fact, that they have of- 
 ten been known to drop their eggs in the nest of the 
 common hen, when that happened to be in the fields, or 
 at a small distance from the house. The two Partridges 
 above mentioned were raised in this manner; and it was 
 particularly remarked by the lady, who gave me the in-
