the acre I have seen growing. How they will answer for 
 cabbages and carrots I am not advised. Parsnips, I know, 
 will grow luxuriantly on such land; why this luscious and 
 pleasant flavored plant is not more extensively grown, I am 
 unable to conjecture. For the feed of many animals noth- 
 ing can be better. 

Boy-Thrift. 

In looking into the position and treatment of boys upon 
 farms, as we have done lately, our notion has more and more 
 strengthened that it is as easy as it most certainly expedi- 
 ent, to give every boy a chance of earning a little money 
 for himself. This can be done by allowing him to set apart 
 a corner of a garden, or pay rent for a single field ; but we 
 find, in the American Agriculturist, the following suggestion 
 of another way to make the laboring lad proud of his home, 
 anil interested in his occupation. It is from the report of a 
 "Fanner's Club:" 

"J. Reynolds said he knew a lad who five years ago began 
 to keep poultry. lie bought tive or si.\ hens, raised chick- 
 ens, and sold chickens and eggs. He fed largely upon 
 fresh fish. He has now a flock of some fifty hens, has pur- 
 chased a cow, repaired his little barn, clothed himself, as- 
 sisted his mother more or less, and is now, from the sale of 
 his milk and the produce of his poult'"y, quite a thriving 

young man, accumulating a very pretty capital."

Concrete Cellar Bottoms. 

The facility and cheapness with which the bottoms of cel- 
 lars may be made clean, sweet, and impervious to water, is 
 generall}' but little known to house owners; nor the ease 
 and certainty with which water may be excluded from cel- 
 lars where it is difficult to drain. 

In soft and pervious soils, this process is best performed 
 by paving with small stones, laid in sand ; but in common, 
 compact soils, the natural surface, well leveled, will answer 
 all purposes. Make a thin mortar with water, lime, and 
 coarse sand, of the consistency called (jroiit, or so thick that 
 it can be poured from a pail on the ground. Commence 
 with a portion of about eight or ten feet at one end, and 
 throw on sufficient to cover it an inch or more thick, and 
 with a scraper, or rakehcad, spread it evenly and smooth ; 
 then throw on as much clean, coarse gravel as it will absorb, 
 and so continue until it is finished. In twelve hours, or so 
 soon as it has set, sweep the overplus gravel evenly over the 
 surface, and ramp it down with a short plank and a. pound- 
 er, until it is smooth and compact, and in a few days of 
 good weather, it will become like a solid rock. It assists 
 its duraliility and firmness, to give it several good dashes of 
 water after it is dry. 

To render the sides impervious to water, where drainage 
 is difllcult or costly, requires that the wall should be laid 
 with mortar originally: and at the time of constructing the 
 bottom, a good, well-proportioned water-lime mortar should 
 be plastered on, a little higher than the source of water, 
 and well and firmly slicked down when about half dry, and 
 followed by another coat of the same : when, if a proper 
 time intervenes before there is any outward pressure of wa- 
 ter, it becomes tight as a barrel or tub ; it is always sweet, 
 clean, and cool, and no vermin can enter or find lodgment. 

The sand used in the grout and mortar should bo coarse, 
 clean and sharp, and the gravel from the size of walnuts 
 down to coarse sand. — Rural New Yorker. 

I obviates, too, the supposed necessity of moistening the teata 
 I by milking a fine stream into the hands and washing the 
 j teats therewith — a filthy practice, followed by almost all 
 men, and too many women. 

The udder being now cooled and cleansed, wo are ready 
 to begin milking. If the cow be well trained, she will now 
 extend backward her hind leg for your convenience, without 
 a word accompanied with the word of command "hoint." 
 They understand what is recjuirod of them, and need only 
 at times a gentle reminder. But it is a singular fact, that 
 men who are kind in every other relation of life, as husband, 
 father, neighbor and master — are rough in their treatment 
 of gentle "bossy." If they say "hoist," it is in stentorian 
 tones ; and too generallj', the first intimation of their wishes 
 is conveyed in a striking manner, by the edge of a heavy 
 milking stool. Now a considerable experience among the 
 "milking mothers of the herd," has convinced us thatharsh- 
 n'ess of tone, or petty cruelty, is not only not productive of 
 good results, but is extremely disadvantageous. Many cows 
 that hold up their milk to a cross milker, will give down 
 freely to one more gentle. And the sack of grain, or other 
 weight across the loins, which is well used to compel the an- 
 imal to give down, would have been uncalled for if a kind 
 hand had alwaj^s drawn her milk, or could be dispensed 
 with, if gentleness takes hold of the teats. 

Now the cow may kick. Well, we have in previous num- 
 bers of this journal shown that to return kick for kick is a 
 poor method of converting Mooley from the error of her 
 ways, but she may be completely cured by kindness. 

When fairly seated, it is of the utmost consequence that 
 the milking should be done without violence, and as rapidly 
 as possible. Many persons who pride themselves on their 
 fast milking, jerk the teats violently, and others will cause 
 them to become sore by the pressure of their finger' nails. 
 The best milkers scarcely move their elbows, but with the 
 upper portion of the hand grasping and compressing the 
 teat, force the jet of milk by the pressure of the lower fin- 
 gers. 

Whether a cow should be milked before, after, or during 
 feeding is a question of minor importance, and must be de- 
 cided by circumstances. R. L. Allen, in his excellent work 
 on "domestic animals," recommends, if we rightly remem- 
 ber, that they be milked while feeding, for the reason, that 
 while thus engaged they will more readih' let down their 
 milk ; but many cows, at other times quiet, will be a little 
 uneasy while eating, and anxious to got not only all that 
 belongs to them, but a share of their neighbor's meal aiso. 
 For this reason we alwaj's milked before feeding that the" 
 feed might appear as a reward of merit. Where one has but 
 one or two cows, it is of course a matter of little mo- 
 ment. 

In fine, we recommend to those who want much milk and 
 good milk, kindness and cleanliness. — Journal of Agricul- 
 ture. 

Milking Cows. 

To insure the greatest yield of milk from a cow, she 
 snould not only bo well fed and well tended, but also well 
 milked. Now it is not every man or every maid, who can 
 squeeze fluid from a cow's udder, that is a good milker. 

It is important, in the first place, that a cow's bag should 
 be clean. For this purpose, when the animal is stabled — as 
 they are, or should be, during the winter, on all farms, and 
 throughout the year, by manj' — let the whole udder be wash- 
 ed with cold water, and immediately thoroughly dried with 
 a towel. The advantages of this practice to the health of 
 the animal, and the healthiness of the milk, are great and 
 manifest; and in this way, too, wo escape the black sediment 
 of which milk-buj'crs so constantly complain, and which is 
 nothing else than small particles of manure, brushed from 
 the bag and belly of the cow into the milk-pail. The hands 
 of the milkmen by this process become washed clean, of ne- 
 cessity ; an operation too generally omitted by those who 
 consider themselves neat and careful. The same process 

How to Caponize Fowls. 
 The practice of the French country-woman is to select the 
 close of the spring, or the beginning of autumn, as well as 
 fine weather, for the performance of their work. The parts 
 necessary to be removed, being fixed in the abdomen, and 
 attached to the spine at the region of the loins, it is abso- 
 lutely necessary to oj^en the abdominal cavity for the purpose 
 of their extraction. The bird should be healthy, fasting, 
 and about three months old. He is then to be secured by an 
 assistant, upon his back, his belly upwards, and his head 
 down, that the intestines, itc, may fall up toward the breast; 
 the tail is to be towards the operator. The right leg is then 
 carried along the body, and the left brought backward and 
 held in this position, so as to leave the left flank perfectly 
 bare, for it is there that the incision is to be made. The 
 said incision is to be directed from before to backwards, tra- 
 versely to the length of the body, at the middle of the flank 
 and slightly to the side, between the ends of the breast-bone 
 and the vent. Having plucked away the feathers from the 
 space where it is intended to make the incision, you take a 
 bistoury or a razor, and cut through this skin, abdominal 
 muscles and peritoneum; it is better to do this at two or 
 more cuts, in order to avoid the possibility of wounding the 
 intestines — a casualty that would, in most cases, be attend- 
 ed with fatal results. The intestines present themselves at 
 the orifice, but you must not sufler them to come out; on the 
 contrary, you press them gently aside, so as to have room 
 for action, I may observe, that the incision should have
