been sufficiently large to admit of the fore-finger, previously 
 well oiled, being passed into the abdomen, and carried care- 
 fully towards the lumbar regiona of the spine; you will 
 there find what you are in search of. You first reach the 
 left substance, which you detach with your nail, or with your 
 finger bent hook-fashion; you then arrive at the right, 
 which you treat similarly ; bring both substances forth ; you 
 finally return the intestines, sow up the wound with a silk 
 thread — a very few stiches will suffice — and smear the place 
 with a little fresh butter. Some persons recommend the 
 amputation of the comb, close to the skull of the newly- 
 made capon ; but this is surely an unnecessary piece of tor- 
 ture — a useless addition to the sufferings of the poor bird. 
 The proposed object of this amputation is to insure the re- 
 cognition of the capon amongst his co-mates of the poultry- 
 yard. Were such a distinctive mark necessary, it strikes us 
 that the operation must have been, so to speak, thrown 
 away; inasmuch as the superior size and bulk of the capon 
 should, of themselves, be sufficiently indicative of his iden- 
 tity ; but independent of these, I may observe that the comh 
 of the capon does not grow to any size, and always retains a 
 jxtlUd Color. Should it be proposed to caponize cocks be- 
 longing to varieties not naturally possessing combs, it will 
 surely be found, at the very most, sufficient to cut the taU 
 feathers down to a stump. In some parts of the continent, 
 the caponizers resort to still more unnecessary brutality. 
 They cut off the spurs of the poor caponized bird, and ma- 
 king an incision in its comb, as it were plant them in it : 
 they are so held for about twenty minutes — in short, just 
 until the blood coagulates ; they then become not merely 
 permanently adherent, but actually groie. The less, how- 
 ever, said about these very, and needlessly, inhuman prac- 
 tices the better. 

To return to our more immediate subject : — The process 
 having been performed as above described, the bird is placed 
 in a warm house, where there are no perches, as if such ap- 
 pliances were present, the newly-made capon might very 
 probably injure himself in his attempts to perch, and per- 
 haps even tear open the sutures, and possibly occasion the 
 operation, usually simple and free from danger, to terminate 
 fatally. For about a week, the food of the bird should be 
 soft oatmeal porridge, and that in small quantities, alterna- 
 ted with bread steeped in milk; he may bo given as much 
 pure water as he will drink, but I recommend that it be te- 
 pid, or, at least, that the chill be taken off it. At the end 
 of a week, or, at the farthest, ten daj's, the bird, if he has 
 been previously of a sound, vigorous constitution, will be all 
 right, and may be turned out into the walk common to all 
 your fowls. — Richardson. 

Milk and Butter Cows. 

A statement is published, verified by a responsible name, 
 of the product of milk and butter, of 14 Ayrshire cows, the 
 property of Edward M. Shepard, of St. Lawrence county, 
 New York, which is worthy of being laid before our readers. 
 It is briefly as follows : 

"Mr. Shepard had 14 cows, Ayrshires and their crosses 
 on natives, half bloods, six heifers milking for the first time 
 — time, the first week in June — feed, grass only. 

"Allowing one cow for family use, and deducting 40 per 
 cent, from heifers, and his trial stood thus : 

Cows, 8 

Heifers 6, reduced to cows is, 3.6 

11.6 

Deduct one cow for family is 1.6 

"The product for the week was 12 lbs. 12 oz. per cow. 
 The first week in Juh-, feed, grass only, and much afi'ected 
 by drought, he milked twenty, eight of whom were heifers, 
 milking for the first season, and his trial stood thus : 

12 cows, less one for family, is 11 

8 heifers, 40 per cent, off, is 4.8 

Full cows, 15.8 

"The product for the week, per cow, was 14 lbs. 13 oz. 
 and a fraction over. 

"But lest you might think my allowance for heifers too 
 much, which, however, is considered a just allowance by the 
 dairymen of this country, the result of the last trial, without 
 any deduction for their being heifers, and four of them only 
 two years old at that, was 12 lbs. 5 oz. and a fraction per 
 head, per week." 

Farmer's Girls. 

Up in the early morning, just at the peep of day, 
 Straining the milk in the dairy, turning the cows away. 
 Sweeping the floor in the kitchen ii;aking the beds upstaira, 
 Washing the breakfast dishes, dusting the parlor chairs. 

Brushing the crumbs from the pantry, hunting the eggs at the 

barn. 
 Cleaning the turnips for dinner, spinning the stocking yarn, 
 Spreading the whitening linen down on the bushes below, 
 Ransacking every meadow where the red strawberries growj 

Starching the"fixen8"for Sunday, churning the snowy cream. 
 Rinsing the pails and strainer down in the running stream. 
 Feeding the geese and turkies, making the pumpkin pies, 
 Jogging the little ones's cradle, driving away the flies. 

Grace in every motion, music in every tone. 
 Beauty of form and features thousands might covet to own, 
 Cheeks that rival spring roses, teeth the whitest of pearls. 
 One of these country maids is worth a score of your city girls.

New Importation of Stock. 

A late number of the Mark Lane Express contains the 
 following account of a new importation by the Clarke coun- 
 ty (Ohio) Cattle Importing Company, which were shipped 
 for Philadelphia. It will bo seen prices are well kept up: 

In accordance with my promise I send yon some further 
 particulars of a valuable cargo of Short-Horned cattle, Cots- 
 wold and Southdown sheep, which left Liverpool during the 
 past week, in the "Bailey," for Philadelphia. The stock in 
 question were those purchased by Dr. Watts and Mr. AV ad- 
 dle, the gentlemen I named in my former report as having 
 made great search throughout the United Kingdom, they 
 having visited most of the principal herds of England, Ire- 
 land, and Scotland, as agents for a spirited company in 
 Clarke county, Ohio, United States. When we mention that 
 amongst these cattle, which consisted of 10 Short-Horned 
 bulls and 20 cows and heifers, were animals that cost 200 
 guineas, several 150 guineas, and most of them averaging 
 over 100 guineas each, it may be readily inferred that ample 
 funds were placed at their disposal ; coupling with this tho 
 heavy personal expenses of those gentlemen, with freight, 
 fittings, and food for the stock, each in itself an item of no 
 small amount, some idea may be formed of the enterprise 
 and spirit of our transatlantic brethren; and we may heart- 
 ily wish them the reward which such patriotic conduct so 
 richly deserves. Every facility was given us by those gen- 
 tlemen for the inspection and particulars of the animals 
 during their stay in Liverpool: several breeders also, some 
 of them from a distance, came to view them ; and we are 
 happy to have their testimony in confirmation of our own. 
 They were indeed a prime lot, and to collect such was a 
 work of no little difiiculty. Dr. Watts paid a visit of the 
 kind in the year 1862, and we learn that he was one of the 
 original shareholders in the first Ohio company which im- 
 ported largely from this country in the years 1834 and 1836, 
 and that such stock proved a great benefit to Kentucky, 
 Ohio, and other Western States, over the vast extent of which 
 we are told the produce of this valuable race of cattle (the 
 "Short-Horn") are widely spread, and that many of them 
 are such as would do credit to the parent country. 

Amongst those now shipped were eight lots purchased at 
 Mr. Wilkinson's sale at Lenton, many of them very superior 
 specimens of the breed ; three very promising animals from 
 Mr. Fawkes' herd, at Farnley Hall ; a fine young white bull, 
 called "Medalist," bred by Mr. Torr, of Aylcsby, which at- 
 tracted a good deal of attention — this animal is closely al- 
 lied to the blood of Mr. Booth, of Warlaby ; Mr. Torr also 
 sold them a bull, cow and heifer ; there were four good spe- 
 cimens from the herd of Mr. Ambler, of Watkinson Hall, Hal- 
 ifax, besides others bred from the stock of Lord Feversham, 
 Sir T. Cartwright, Messrs. Birchall, Clarke, Dudding. Mitch- 
 ell and Wood, all English breeders; three splendiil bulls, 
 purchased at the Royel Dublin Show (two of theiu winners 
 of the first prize in their classes), which were bred by 
 Messrs. Farrel, Lee, Norman and Topham ; there were also 
 several promising yearling heifers from the herds of Messrs. 
 Barnes and Chaloner, celebrated breeders of Short-Horns 
 in the Sister Isle. The Cotswold sheep were from the cele- 
 brated flock of Mr. Hewer, of Northleach, and the South 
 Downs from that of Mr. Webbs, of Babraham. Messrs.
