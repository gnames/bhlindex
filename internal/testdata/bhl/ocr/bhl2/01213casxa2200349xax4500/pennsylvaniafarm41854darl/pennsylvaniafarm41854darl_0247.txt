deciding the qualities of milch cows by certain tufts of hair 
 called escutcheons. The public announcement of this theory 
 was made in France ten or twelve years ago, and it has since 
 been disseminated in other parts of Europe, and in America, 
 by means of pamphlets, charts, &c. M. Guenon assumed to 
 be able to determine by these hair-marks, the exact quantity 
 of milk a cow would give in a day, or a year. It was obvi- 
 ous enough to people of common sense, that whatever foun- 
 dation there might be for his system, no such precision as 
 he laid claim to could be maintained. 

Having had extensive opportunities for the application of 
 Guenon's system, we are satisfied in regard to the following 
 points : — 

1. There are some cows in which the external marks de- 
 scribed by Guenon do not exist at all. Among these, supe- 
 rior milkers are not uncommon. 

2. The greater number of cows have the so-called es- 
 cutcheons, and among these, there is, in general, some cor- 
 respondence in their milking qualities with Guenon's rules, 
 though the agreement is not sufficient to justify his claims. 

It results, therefore, that the system of Guenon is inade- 
 quate to form a proper guide for the selection of mUch cows, 
 because 

1. It cannot comprehend all, and 

2. It is imperfect in regard to those to which it does ap- 
 ply- 

Besides the objections already given, there are others of 
 still more importance. If it were admitted that Guenon's 
 system is correct, it would evidently be an unsafe one to fol- 
 lew, without other aids, as it only proposes to judge cows by 
 the quantity of milk they yield. Conceding that a cow may 
 have the milking properties which the rule would allow, she 
 may still be a very bad animal from which to propagate a 
 stock. She may be large-boned, a great consumer of food 
 in proportion to the jirofit afforded, and of poor constitution. 
 A good, or really profitable breed of cattle, cannot be pro- 
 duced without strict attention to the points on which health 
 and strength of constitution depend. 

It may be said that Guenon derived the ideas which led 
 to the formation of his system from actual observation. 
 But it does not follow that the marks on the cows which he 
 examined would apply to other races. Many external marks 
 — as the length and appearance of the horns, the color, <fcc. 
 — differ in the different breeds. The fifth toe in the Dorking 
 fowl may be of use in that it denotes affinity with a valuable 
 family, but cannot form a rule in judging other fowls. In 
 applying Guenon's system (as we have lately done) to twen- 
 ty Jersey cows, it was found that several, which are known 
 to be very superior for dairy qualities, would be, if judged 
 by their escutcheons, placed in the lowest ranks. 

We have before us a translation of a work entitled "How 
 to Choose a Good Milk Cow," by J. H. Magne, Professor of 
 the Veterinary School at Alfort, France. The remarks of 
 this author in regard to the value of Guenon's system are of 
 so much importance that we make the following extracts. 
 As showing the complication of this system, he says it "at 
 present comprehends twenty classes, and 480 orders, and 
 each of these 480 orders is understood to give a fixed quan- 
 tity of milk, and continue to give it during a definite pe- 
 riod !" 

Having shown that the quantity and quality of milk de- 
 pend in a great degree on "management, climate, the sea- 
 son, the temperament, the size and energy of the principal 
 internal organs, the capacity of chest, the influence of the 
 generative system, <tc.," he says : — 

"It might, therefore, have been argued A priori that the 
 mathematical precision, assigned to a classification of cows, 
 is contrary to the most general laws of physiology; to pro- 

pose a mark indicating that a cow will give so much milk 
 daily, and for so many days, is to deceive ourselves, or to 
 attempt deceiving others ; the study of the phenomena of 
 life proves that the action of the organs depends not only on 
 their size and form, but on the general condition of each 
 indixddual. 

"We are able not only to oppose argument to the asser- 
 tions of Guenon, but we can also appeal to the difficulties 
 hitherto experienced in applying his classification to prac- 
 tice. 

"All the attempts made on the Guenon method, not ex- 
 cepting those of the author himself, prove the soundness of 
 our opinion. The most skillful, when called to decide on 
 the quantities of cows whose yield of milk was well known, 
 erred seven times on eight cows, and fifteen times on twen- 
 ty-one. And lest these errors may be attributed to chance, 
 on account of the small number of cows submitted for trial, 
 we should mention that other estimates proved erroneous 
 152 times on 174 cows,* and 321 times on 352, and that the 
 error amounted to 921 pints of milk on a total of 2683 pints, f 
 in other words, there was error in regard to almost all the 
 cows ; and error amounting on an average, on each, to more 
 than a third of the yield. On some individuals the esti- 
 mates were wrong to the extent of from 17i to 21, and even 
 from 26 to 28 pints a day ! 

"Such is the truth as to the perfect nicety (exactitude) 
 claimed for the escutcheon system. This system cannot do 
 more than furnish an approximate estimate of the quantity 
 of milk, and that in regard not to all, but only to the ma- 
 jority of cows."

Best Time to Plant Trees. 

[We extract the following excellent article by our friend 
 Thomas Meehan from the Germantown Telegraph. His 
 experience gives weight to the recommendation for autumn 
 planting, and fully coincides with the views we have long 
 held, and with our own observations. We would only add 
 one remark in addition to what he has so well said, viz : — 
 that in fall planting it is indispensable that trees should be 
 well staked and secured from being blown about by the high 
 winds. This prevents the fibres from taking hold of the 
 ground, and is often the cause of bad success with fall 
 planting.] 

So much has been said and written on this subject, that 
 there seems to be little left to say or write. I have nothing 
 new to offer, but aim at lending "fresh interest to a twice 
 told tale." 

The readers of the Telegraph will not, I am sure, consider 
 the information very original, that of the numerous trees 
 annually planted, great numbers die; but I am not so sure 
 that they would not attribute the deaths to very opposite 
 causes. Yet the facts of the "millions of cases" lie in a nut 
 shell. I will explain. 

At the outset let it not be forgotten, that to the roots of 
 plants, small rootlets or Jibres are attached ; and that all 
 fluids for the support of the plant have to be chiefly received 
 through these fibres. 

When a tree is transplanted, many of the fibres are broken 
 off or damaged ; and, if it has never been transplanted bo- 
 fore, most of the fibres being at the ends of the principal 
 roots, far away from the base of the tree, will be left in the 
 ground, and very few come away with it. If tlie operation 
 is performed late in the spring, the buds burst and the leaves 
 unfold, they ask for moisture, and if the trees have an abun- 
 dance of fibres, they get a fair supply ; if they liave few or 
 none, they wither and wilt, and no matter how carefully 
 planted, no matter how carefully pruned, mulched, er water-
