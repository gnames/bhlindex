unerringly fixes its nest in the spot best suit«d for the com- 
 ing summer, or the snail whose tubercles begin to grow ten 
 days before the rain they are preparing to receive, appear, 
 at first sight, to surpass the more developed men. But the 
 inferiority of those lovyer orders of animals is in the quanti- 
 ty of their endowments, rather than in the quality ; they 
 have a single faculty developed to an extraordinary degree, 
 while man has, as it were, faculties almost infinite. In thus 
 adapting each organization to its special position, the wis- 
 dom of the Creator is forcibly exhibited. — Philada. Ledger,

Sulphate of Ammonia for Plants. 

There seems to be but little doubt that this article is a 
 most valuable stimulant for promoting the health and vigor 
 of bedding out plants in the garden. Our attention was at- 
 tracted to the subject some time ago by reading an article in 
 the Gardeners' Chronicle (Eng.) on the use of Ammonia, 
 and the high encomiums bestowed on the Sulphat« of Am- 
 monia by a correspondent of the Horticulturist a year or two 
 ago. We give below extracts from both articles, that our 
 readers may understand how the application is made to the 
 plants : 

By Mr. Deane, Vice President of the Pharmaceutical So- 
 ciety : "My attention was first effectively turned to the sub- 
 ject about eight or ten years since, when an extensive grow- 
 er of Pelargoniums, Fusehias and Roses, applied to me for 
 some remedy for the sickly condition of his stock, which, if 
 left unchecked, would insure a very severe loss to him. On 
 examining the plants they were found to be in a starving 
 condition, the roots having filled the pot and exhausted the 
 eoil ; consequently the leaves had lost their healthy green 
 L color and become very p.ale with a strong tinge of yellow; 

the lower leaves were quite spotted, yellow and falling ofi". 
 The natural remedy was obviously fresh potting, but as the 
 plants were already in pots best adapted to the purposes of 
 the grower, some other remedy had to be devised. I there- 
 fore made a very weak solution of Sulphate and Carbonate 
 of Ammonia, and therewith watered the roots of the plants 
 once a day in the evening; and to insure any observed re- 
 sults as to the efi"ect of the ammonia, certain rows of the 
 plants %vere selected for the experiment. In a few days the 
 ofiects of the ammonia were most marked and satisfactory. 
 The leaves began to put on a very remarkable appearance, 
 the course of the vines or spinal vessels becoming perfectly 
 green, the color spreading through all the reticulations, un- 
 til the tissues were restored to their healthy condition. In 
 fact the plants thus treated looked more vigorous than they 
 had ever done before, being much darker in color and firmer 
 in texture. The contrast between these plants and those 
 which had received no ammonia left no doubt about the 
 eflttciency of the application. 

"I forget the effects upon the flowering of the Pelargoni- 
 ums, but there was certainly no deficiency of flowers upon 
 the Fusehias and Roses ; they were moreover finer and bet- 
 ter colored than usual. The following is the formula for the 
 solution applied by Mr. Deane : 

Sulphate Ammonia, 14i oz. 

Carbonate do 2 " 

Water, 4 pints. 

Of this solution, one fluid ounce to a gallon of water will 
 make a solution sufiieiently strong for all ordinary pur- 
 poses. 

The correspondent of the Horticulturist says : — "I am 
 confident many of your lady readers, and perhaps those of 
 the other sex, are puzzled to choose among the many new 
 manures, and having failed with some, and injured their 
 plants with others, they end by raising only sickly and mea- 
 gre plants, when they might have them presenting a luxu- 
 riant and satisfactory appearance, with leaves of the darkest 
 green, and flowers or fruit of double the usual size. 

Having made a trial for three years past, with a perfectly 
 safe and satisfactory liquid fertiliser, which appears to suit 
 all kinds of vegetation, which is clean and easily applied, 
 and procured without difficulty, in any town, I confidently 
 recommend it to your readers, especially those who wish to 
 give special pains to, and got uncommon results from, cer- 
 tain favorite plants, either in pots or in the open garden, 
 plants whose roots are in such a moderate cou:pass that they 
 can bo reached two or three times a week, if not oftener, by 
 the watering pot. 

This liquid fertiliser is made by dissolving half an ounce 
 of the Sulphate of Ammonia in a gallon of water. Nothing 
 60 good or can be cheaper, and the substance can be obtain- 
 ed at almost any apothecary's. 

Now for the mode of using it. I say at the outset that 
 weak as the solution appears to be, and is, if plants are 
 watered with it daily, they will die, just as certainly as a 
 man would if he drank nothing but pure brandy. 

The right way to apply it, is to water the plant with this 
 solution every sixth time, the other five times with plain 
 water. The proportion is so simple, and the mode of using 
 it so easy to xinderstand, that tho most ignorant person can- 
 not possibly blunder about it, if he can count six. If wo 
 water our plants with the solution every Saturday, and all 
 the rest of the time with plain water, we shall have a safe 
 rule. 

The result, I am sure, will delight and surprise every per- 
 son who will make a trial of it. It has become such an in- 
 dispensable thing with me that I regularly mix a barrel of 
 it every Friday, and use it on Saturday, upon any plants that 
 I particularly wish to invigorate and stimulate. I do not 
 know that I have known a single instance of its disagreeing 
 with any plant, ammonia being the universal food of vege- 
 tation. Of course, the more rapid growing plants, thos< 
 with foliage that perspire a great deal, are most benefitted 
 by it. Of course, also, plants that are at rest, or not in a 
 growing stfite, should not be fed with it; but any plant that 
 is about starting, or is actually in a growing state, will not 
 fail to be wonderfully improved by it. I will enumerate 
 some of the things I have had success with. 

Strawhcn-ics — Beds of indifferent appearance at the open- 
 ing of the spring, last season, after being watered four times 
 with this solution, grew very luxuriantly, and bore a crop of 
 remarkably fine fruit. I have repeated the experiment on 
 half of every bed ; both foliage and blossoms are as large 
 again on the watered as on the unwatered portion. By way 
 of comparison I watered some with plain water also, and find 
 that though rather benefitted, (for the strawberry loves wat- 
 er,) they have none of the depth of verdure and luxuriance 
 of those watered with ammonia. 

Early Pears. — At least a week earlier than those watered, 
 and much stronger in leaf and pod. 

Dwarf Pears. — Some sickly trees, that I have given the 
 best attention for three years without being able to get eith- 
 er good fruit or healthy foliage, after being watered four 
 times with the solution — of course with the usual interme- 
 diate supply of common water — became perfectly healthy 
 and luxuriant, and have ever since (two years) remained so.

The Digging HacMne. 

An implement under the above designation, invented by 
 Mr. Matthew Gibson, of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, already 
 known to agriculturists as the originator of the Patent Nor- 
 thumberland Clod Crusher, has been daily at work for sev- 
 eral weeks past on the farms of Sir Hedworth AVilliamson, 
 Bart., at Monkwearmouth, and of Mr. Barnes, at Whitburn, 
 near Sunderland. During the past week the [lOwers of this 
 admirable appliance to agricultural tillage have been further 
 tested on the farms of Mr. T. T. Hall, of Ovingham, Tyne- 
 side; Mr. R. W. Swan, of Wallsend, and Sir W. C. Trevel- 
 yan, Bart., of Washington, Northumberland. Its powers, 
 in .all the trials referred to, were exhibited on tough clayey 
 soil, and working at a depth of nine inches, at the rate of 
 three-quarters of an acre per hour, with four horses, through- 
 out the whole day, with no more exertion than that required 
 for ordinary plowing. The implement consists of a number 
 of cylinders of about three and a half inches in diameter 
 and six inches long, revolving on a fixed axle. On each of 
 the cylinders is cast a disc, twelve inches in diameter, which 
 is furnished with ten teeth, or prongs, of hardened mallea- 
 ble iron or steel, of a curved or cat-claw form, springing 
 from its periphery, and which, partly by the weight of the 
 implement, and partly by the strain of draught, is forced 
 into the ground, and, as the implement advances, digs or 
 forces up the soil — in fact, each prong performs precisely the 
 oflice of a pick or hack in loosening the soil. This forking 
 up or loosening of the soil is not the only important oflice of 
 the implement, but from the curved form of the teeth, it 
 brings all roots and fibrous matter within the depth of its 
 operation to the surface, thus producing a clean as well as a 
 free tillage, or at once acting most effectively as a grubber 
 in bringing up root-weeds, and at the same time performing 
 the most important function of the plow in aerating the soil. 
 The implement is mounted on a strong frame, partly of cost 
 and partly of malleable iron, and furnished with a siranle 
 but most ingenious apparatus for regulating the depth of its 
 working in the soil. — Mark Lane Express.
