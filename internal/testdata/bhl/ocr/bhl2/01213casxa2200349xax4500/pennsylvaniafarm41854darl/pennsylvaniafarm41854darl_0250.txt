Squashes aud PumpMns. 

BY THADDEUS W. HARRIS, HARVARD COLLEGE 

I am now acquainted with ten different kinds of pumpkins 
 and sijuashes belonging to the same group as the Valparaiso, 
 Cuba, aud Marrow. 

1. The mammoth pumpkin of Potiron {Cucurhita maxima.) 
 The fertile flowers have five stigmas, and the fruite tive car- 
 pel? ; having raised it in my own garden during the past 
 summer, I can vouch for the fact. 

2. A glaucous or greyish-green pumpkin or squash, more 
 or less turbinated or top shaped, growing to a large size 
 (three and a half feet or more in circumference,) mistaken 
 by some seedsmen for the mammoth pumpkin. It was raised 
 iu my garden in the sumer of 1851, and was found to have 
 four or tive stigmas, and the same number of carpels. 

3. Mr. Cole's Connecticut pie-squash or pumpkin. Spheri- 
 cal or spheroidal, three and a half feet in circumference. 
 Raised in my garden in the summer of 1851. Stigmas most- 
 ly four; ii) a few flowers, five. Carpels mostly four; a few 
 of the ''ruit had five. 

4. Elongated Valparaiso squash, tapering very much at 
 each end, striped longitudinally with white. Raised from 
 Valparaiso seed in the summer of 1815, in my garden. 
 Sti.ninas and Carpels five in mumber, 

5. The common oveta Valparaiso I have not raised ; but 
 have bought and cut many specimens, in all of which I found 
 four carpels. I examined the young fruit, growing in 
 grounds of my friends, aud found, often, five carpels. 

6. The autumnal marrow, introduced into notice and used 
 by Mr. Ives, of Salem. This forms an exception to the 
 general rule in the fruits of this group ; having ordinarily 
 only three carpels, and but three stigmas. Four iu some 
 cases are, however, to be found, as already stated. 

7. The Cushaw squash probably introduced from Louisiana 
 wliere it was known and cultivated more than one hundred 
 years ago. It is mentioned by Le Page du Pratz, in his 
 llistorio de la Louisiane, vol. ii., p. 11, by name of Giromon 
 en forme de cordf-c/io«8e(hunting horn,) and by the translator 
 of tho work by the vernacular name of Cimlmiv. This is a 
 crook-neck squash, with permanent nipple-formed style, and 
 sloui like that of the marrow. It has only three carpels, at 
 least I found but three in the few specimens that grew in my 
 garden in 1852. It is so tender and delicate, that it rots in 
 our climate before it becomes fully ripe. 

8. Tho Acorn-sqviash, evidently nothing but a variety of 
 the one called by French writers Le Fepon turban {Cucurhita 
 2>Hlforinx of Duchesne.) Fine specimines were raised in my 
 garden in the summer of 1851. It is the heaviest squash 
 of its si.;e that is known to me, and one of tho best flavor. 
 Flowers mostly with five stigmas, some with four ; carpels 
 five or four. 

•J. M. Stetson's Cuba squash. Though I have not yet cut 
 it, 1 am convinced from its external characters that it must 
 contain five carpels. 

10. Mr. Dunn's rougli-skined pumpkin or squash, weigh- 
 ing one bunded and fifty pounds, which was exhibited at 
 tlio lust annual Horticultural Exhibition. This probably 
 had five earpels — if its external characters are to be relied 
 upon. Coquimbe squash, and Mr. Pope's California squash, 
 which were exhibited last September. The number of 
 car])els in those unknown to me, not having seen them cut 
 Probably in both will be found more than throe carpels. 

I have enumerated these kinds in order to show that the 
 ground, characterized by me, has been established upon per- 
 sonal examination and desieion of the most of tho known 
 varieties; and that the character of five or four stigmas and 
 tho same number of carpels (rarely three) is one which pre- 
 vails in this group. 

Heretofore it has generally been understood and is so stated 
 hx most botanists, that pumpkins and squashes were origi- 
 nally natives of Asia. On the contrary, I find iu ancient 
 works abundant evidence that they were unknown in the 
 Eastern Hemisphere before the diseoveri' "f America, and 
 that they were originally natives of the tropical and warm 
 parts of America, and that they were extensively cultivated 
 by the native Indians from Canada to Chili, before any Euro- 
 pean settlements were made on this Continent. 

After a very careful examination of the plants and the 
 fruits of as many kinds as I could obtain or raise, I have dis- 
 covered certain distinguishing characters which will enable 
 us to class all of them in three natural groups. These are :- 
 1st. Summer squashes — such as tho broad scalloped, tho 

long and warted, the round or orange, the varigated or gourd 
 squashes, and various other kinds. Most of these (but not 
 all) have upright vines which do not run, (hence sometimes 
 called bush squashes,) and small or feeble tendrils or elaspors. 
 Their leaves are very rough, and mostly five lobed (like a 
 grape vine loaf.) The fruit when cut across is found gen- 
 erally to have tive double rows of seeds ; more rarely , 
 only three double rows. The fruit-stem is enlarged next the 
 fruit, and is deeply five furrowed and five-angled. The 
 fruit (which ripens early) is fit to be eaten only in an unripe 
 state, or while it still remains tender. When fully ripe, the 
 rind becomes whiteish or pale, hard and brittle, like a gourd 
 shell ; and the pulp is dry and spongy. Tho seeds are 
 small and thin, and of a grayish or dirty yellow color. 

2d. Pumpkins and winter squashes — including our common 
 New England field pumpkins, tho crooked-necked squashes, 
 the custard squash' and many other kinds. All these have 
 running vines, with strong branched tendrils or claspers, very 
 rough more or less deeply five lobed leaves, and a five furrow- 
 ed and five angled fruit-stem, which is very much enlarged 
 towards the fruit. On being cut across, the fruit is found to 
 have only three double rows of seeds. The fruit is fit to be 
 eaten only when fully ripe, and it may be kept, with care, all 
 winter. It does not dry up like summer squashes, but finally 
 rots and becomes soft and spoiled throughout. The rind, 
 mostly thin and tender, never becomes dry, woody, and 
 brittle; and the pulp remains fleshy and succulent till it 
 decays. The seeds are larger than those of summer squashes 
 but are also thin and grayish or yellowish. 

3d. Nippled pumpkin and squashes — such as the Mam- 
 moth pumkins or potiro, your Cuba squashes, Valparaiso 
 squashes, acorn squash, the autumnal marow squash, 
 and some others. All these have running or climbing 
 vines, with strong branched tendrils. The leaves are 
 rather soft, some of them as soft and velvety as those of the 
 the mellow ; they are never deeply lobed, but more often 
 nearly round ar heart-shaped. The fruit stem is short, 
 thick, angled, but not five angled aud not five furrowed, 
 and when green is nearly as thick at one end as at the other. 
 The fruit when cut across, is found gennerally to have four 
 or five double rows of seeds, more rarely three double rows ; 
 and I have found this smaller number only in the autumnal 
 marrow squashes, and it is by no means a constant character 
 even in them, four or five double rows being occasionally 
 found in them. The fruit is fit to be eaten in autumn and 
 winter, and only when fully ripe. It is always distinguished, 
 however various the shape and size, by having a small nip- 
 ple-like projection at the blossom end, this projection being 
 the permanent style of theblosom, the rind, which is gener- 
 ally remarkably thin and tender, never becomes hard, dry, 
 wood}-, and brittle. Tho flesh often of a rich orange color, 
 and remarkably sweet and fine grained, never dries up or 
 becomes spongy like that of summer squashes, but remains 
 succulent till it rots. The seeds are large, broad, thick or 
 plump, mostly of a beautiful color ; but in certain very dark 
 fleshed varieties, the seeds are of the color of old ivory 
 cream colored. 

Now, I am strongly inclined to the belief that all the 
 pumkins and squashes of this third division were originally 
 luitices of the western side of America, as Chili, Peru Mexico 
 and California. Some of them have doubtless been intro- 
 j duced into the West Indies, whence they occasionally are 
 brought to our markets. — Journal U. S. Ayricnltural So-

Domesticating Strange Animals. 

Geoffrey Saint Hilaire, and other eminent naturalists in 
 France, are begining to turn their serious attention to the ac- 
 climation or domestication of animals which have hitherto 
 been totally unknown to Europe, or known only as objects 
 of scientific curiosity: Within the month they have received 
 for the Gardin des Plants, a number of Yaks from China — an 
 animal which Buffon says " is more precious thanall the gold 
 of the New World-" In Thibit and China this animal serves 
 as a horse, an ass, a cow, and a sheep ; he bears heavy bur- 
 dens, draws large loads, supplies milk, has flesh which is ex- 
 cellent, and hair which can be wrought into warm clothes. 
 To naturalize him therefore, in Europe, would be an immense 
 service to mankind, and as he bears cold bravely, the French 
 naturalists have every hope that they will be able to do so, 
 though, by the way, the late Lord Derby made the attempt 
 and failed. Some Chinese have been brought over to attend 
 the Yaks.
