in cows which have all these they often discover certain 
 marks of "Guenon's system," causing them to be reject- 
 ed entirely, and also find Guenon's marks, indicating very 
 desirable properties, in cows which would be otherwise 
 rejected by nearly all. 

Thick and Thin Sowing. 
 We observe in one of our foreign exchanges some dis- 
 ^ussion on the above subject. One farmer, who thinks 
 le are in the habit of sowing our seeds too thick, ob- 
 /erves he has proved this season that single grains of 
 wheat, at the extreme distance of three feet apart, will 
 yield eighty perfect ears, containing fifty kernels each, 
 or more than four thousand fold. This is ten quarters 
 per acre (about eight bushels) from two pints of seed. 
 He also says he is prepared to prove that isolated plants 
 one foot apart, at about six pints of seed per acre, will 
 produce as great a crop, but if planted closer it is an 
 utter impossibility, as the plants then cannot perform 
 their natural capabilities. He also asserts that every 
 grain of either wheat, barley, or oats, sown in Great 
 Britain, does not yield forty fold from each grain, sim- 
 ply from its extreme thickness. He further says that 
 mildewed crops, the result occasionally of thin sowing, 

may be prevented by sowing early. These are rather 
 startling assertions, and well worthy of attention and 
 experiment here. One argument in favor of thick sow- 
 ing is that a large portion of the seeds of wheat, oats, 
 &c., are imperfectly covered, and the vegetative power 
 lost by exposure. The increasing use of the drill, which 
 covers more regularly and evenly than broadcast sow- 
 ing, may obviate this objection, and we should like to 
 hear of careful comparative experiments on the subject. 
 The art and science of farming are not yet perfected. 
 We believe there is much yet to learn. 

Speaking of thin sowing reminds us that within a few 
 days we have heard of an excellent crop of wheat, grown 
 from an application of a little over fifty pounds of guano 
 to the acre. Jt was sown by the guano attachment to 
 Pennock's seed drill, being deposited in the drill at the 
 same time with the wheat and through the same tube. 
 So small a quantity was not injurious in contact with 
 the seed, and none was lost by either exposure to the 
 atmosphere or imperfect covering. This guano attach- 
 ment to Pennock's drill, which before seemed as perfect 
 an implement of the kind as could be wanted, we have 
 heard highly spoken of. It will drill in from fifty to one 
 hundred and fifty pounds per acre.

DURHAM BULL "DUKE OF GLOSTER." 

This superior bull is the property of Lewis G. Morris 
 and Mr. Becar, of New York, and was purchased by 
 Ihem at the great sale of Earl Ducie in 1853. His cost 
 was 650 guineas ($3,250), with the restriction that he 
 was to be retained in England for one year. He was 
 considered the best bull at the sale, and the agent was 
 authorized to go as high as $6000 for him. He is ex- 
 pected to arrive in this country in August or September. 
 The following is his pedigree :
