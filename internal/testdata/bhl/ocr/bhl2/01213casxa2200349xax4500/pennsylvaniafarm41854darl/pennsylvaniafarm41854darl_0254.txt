THE FARM JOURNAL. 

[August 

Book Notices. 

Country Gentleman. — This well conducted weekly 
 journal commenced witii July its fourth volume. It is 
 published by Luther Tucker, Albany, N. Y. $2 per 
 year iu advance. Joseph Warren, assistant editor. It 
 is a family, no less than a farmer's paper, and in varie- 
 ty, no less than quality, of both original and selected 
 matter takes a high rank, and well deserves the exten- 
 sive patronage it has received. 

Wool Guowee & Stock REcasTEK. — Published at 
 Rochester, New York, monthly; price 50 cents per year. 
 1). D. T. Moore, proprietor, T. C. Peters, principal edi- 
 tor. The July number commenced the sixth volume, and 
 it has also been enlarged to thirty-two pages. Although 
 especially devoted to the department of stock, it also 
 contains much valuable matter on kindred subjects, and 
 should be in the hands of every stock breeder in the 
 country. The only fault in the Wool Grower is the price. 
 It is well worth $1. 

W.^TEK Cure Journal. — Published by Fowler & Wells, 
 308 Broadway, New York; $1 per year. A new volume 
 of the above commenced with July. We commend the 
 work to all who consider prevention better than cure, 
 and wish to obtain good health by the natural remedies 
 of pure air, pure water, regulated diet and exercise. 
 Many suggestions on all these points can be from time 
 to time culled from it highly valuable to a family. Hy- 
 dropathy is evidently on the increase, and as a necessary 
 consequence the disuse of tea, coffee, tobacco and all 
 other stimulants. The Journal is handsomely printed 
 and illustrated. 

American Phrenological Journal. — Published as 
 above and same price. The only periodical in the coun- 
 try we believe devoted to phrenology'. It is also a lite- 
 rary paper, containing numerous illustrations and bio- 
 graphies, with portraits of distinguished characters. 
 The July number contains four engravings of Niagara, 
 and also portraits of G. N. Frankenstein and Bayard 
 Taylor, with their phrenological developments. The 
 portrait of the latter, who is a native of Chester county, 
 will be recognised by his friends, and his biography 
 truthful, and evidently written by one who knows. 

Warder's Western Horticultural Review. — We 
 have not received a copy of the above for the last four 
 months. What is the matter ? Is the fault with the 
 mail, or does the editor intend cutting acquaintance with 
 tlie Pennsylvania Farm Journal ? A subscriber near us, 
 who sent on the money, says he is also in the same pre- 
 dicament. 

People's Journal. — This is the title of a beautiful 
 work published monthly by Alfred E. Beach, of New 
 York, devoted to agriculture, mechanics, science and 
 useful knowledge. Each number contains thirty-two 
 pages super royal octavo, embellished with numerous 
 engravings upon almost every conceivable subject. The 
 paper is of excellent quality, and each volume will make 
 a handsome addition to the library. 

Ailanthus Trees. 

In accordance with what seems to be the spirit of the 
 age, the ailanthus tree has been made the occasion of at 
 least two conventions in different cities, and some very 
 formidable strings of resolutions. We should be glad to 

see it killed off, and its place supplied with other and 
 more beautiful shade trees not liable to the same objec- 
 tion, of which there are not a few. AVe believe in some 
 places persons have hesitated to cut down the ailanthus, 
 for fear of a multitude of suckers springing up and ta- 
 king possession of the ground. This has often happened 
 and made much trouble. We have lately seen a case 
 where a large one was cut down, and the roots most ef- 
 fectually destroyed in a slioi't time, by simply boring a 
 two inch augur hole in the centre of the stump, and also 
 in the side, tending downwards, and filling it with salt. 

There never was the slightest appearance of a sucker.

A Washington County Farmer. 

A letter from a friend of one of the publishers resi- 
 ding in Washington county. Pa., contains the following 
 information, which we transcribe for the Journal: — I am 
 still attending to the farm, to which I removed a short 
 time before you left ; like the business, and have suc- 
 ceeded well. Farming is indeed at present a profitable 
 business — grain and stock of all kinds commanding high 
 prices. Wool, however, is an exception. But Uttle has 
 been sold as yet (.lune 12) this season. Prices in this 
 neighborhood range from 30 to 40 cents pound, wheat is 
 $1 60, corn 65 to 70 cents, and oats 40 to 45 cents per 
 bushel. Good horses sell from .$100 to $150 per head ; 
 cattle at $3 50 to $4 00 per hundred, gross weight; 
 sheep (good wethers) $3 00 to $3 25 do do 

"My attention has been confined principally to horses 
 and sheep. I have found the latter, on the whole, the 
 most profitable branch of farming. I am touching the 
 French stock lightly, and thus far like them well. 

"I have a Durham calf — not full blood — which when 
 four months old M'eighed 550 pounds, at seven months 
 800, at twelve months 1,080. He is now thii'teen months 
 old, and I think will weigh 1,200 pounds. His color is 
 deep red. He took the first premium at our fair last 
 fall. 

"The wheat crop in this county will be a great failure 
 — will not be half a crop at the best." 

Preparation of Ground for Reapers and Mowers. 

Mr. Darlington : — As you and most of your readers 
 are aware, the scarcity and high price of labor has com- 
 pelled the introduction of reapers and mowers into the 
 grass and grain fields to a considerable extent in Penn- 
 sylvania and some other States ; and the indications are 
 that the demand for them has only commenced. The 
 experience of the present season has been highly favor- 
 able, and a year oi two more will probably find them 
 among the implements of nearly eveiy close calculating 
 farmer in the* State. But while the experience of the 
 present season has been highly favorable, as above ob- 
 served, it has also served to show the necessity of more 
 carefully preparing the ground with a view to their fu- 
 ture use. Many farmers purchased and used reapers 
 and mowers this year, who scouted their practicability 
 last; and not a few of these found, to their cost, that a 
 Uttle more care in the preparation of their ground be- 
 fore seeding Avould have been much to their interest. 

The machines are not yet perfect, but the patentees 
 and makers will take care to remedy all defects in their 
 construction. It would be a miracle, however, to make
