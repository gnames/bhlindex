a mowing machiue capable of cutting tlirough rocks, 
 mounds, &c. I hazard tlie assertion, without the fear of 
 contradiction, that the smoother the ground is prepared, 
 and the cleaner it is made from obstruction, the better 
 any machine will work. This being the case, — and the 
 strong probability that many, who yet doubt the success- 
 ful adoption of these implements in lieu of the scythe 
 and sickle, will, ere long, be compelled to use them, — 
 would it not be well to have an eye to this while the 
 ground is under tillage ? J. W.

 Blind Ditching. 
 Mr. Editor: — The subject of reclaiming land in wet 
 locations becomes of more importance as our population 
 increases. A wet piece of ground is mostly of the best 
 quality after a judicious system of draining has been ap- 
 plied, where stagnant water and springs can be led from 
 the ground. Much depends on the knowledge and ex- 
 perience persons have in the matter, to do it in the most 
 economical way ; an unskillful method may cost much 
 money and hard labor, and accomplish very little com- 
 paratively in the end : for example, in draining a piece 
 of ground which has a number of springs, either tem- 
 porary or continual, which is frequently the case at the 
 foot of rising ground, an inexperienced person would be 
 likely to construct a ditch over a large field for each 
 spring, where all might be accomplished by running a 
 single ditch along the foot of the rise as near as possi- 
 ble, and as circumstances would allow, to the springs, 
 and short branches to those which cannot be reached 
 otherwise, and the main ditch will carry away all the wa- 
 ter into some stream or other place where it does not hin- 
 der. It is frequently that water oozes out in or near 
 the flat valleys, from the fact that the ground is more 
 compact than on the sides of rising ground, thus the 
 water is brought on the top and rivulets or wet spots are 
 produced. By studying the nature of the subject we 
 will be able to arrive at a proper conclusion. If a ditch 
 be sunk a proper depth (much depending on the thick- 
 ness of strata) and stones laid in the bottom, covered by 
 flat ones so as to leave a passage for the water, and the 
 balance filled up with stones within ten inches of the 
 top, will make make what is termed a blind or covered 
 ditch. Experience in this part of farm economy is re- 
 quisite as this article will show, and a person unac- 
 quainted with the business would do well to spend a few 
 dollars for a survey and directions by a person under- 
 standing it practically and theoretically.

Domestic Recipes. 

Green Corn Cake. — Mix a pint of grated green corn 
 ■with three table spoonfuls of milk, a tea cup of flour, 
 half a tea cup of melted butter, one egg, a tea spoonful 
 of salt, and half a tea spoonful of pepper. Drop this 
 mixture into hot butter by the spoonful, let the cakes fry 
 eight or ten minutes. These cakes are nice served up 
 with meat for dinner. 

Peach Jam. — Gather the peaches when quite ripe, 
 peel and stone them, put them into a preserving pan, 
 and bake them over the fire till hot; rub them through 

a sieve, and add to a pound of pulp the same weight of 
 poiuided loaf sugar, and half an ounce of bitter ahuonds, 
 blanched and pounded ; let it boil ten or twelve minutes; 
 stir and skim it well. 

Tomato Catsup. — Take two quarts skinned tomatoes, 
 two table spoonsful pf salt, the same of black pepper, 
 and one of allspice ; four pods of red pepper, two table 
 spoonsful of ground mustard ; mix and rub these thoi'- 
 oughly together, and stew them slowly, in a pint of vin- 
 egar, for three hours ; then sti'ain the liquor through a 
 sieve, and simmer it down to one quart of catsup. Put 
 this in bottles and cork it tight. 

To Keep out Red Ants. — Place in the closet, or 
 wherever they appear, a small quantity of green sage. 

Keeping Tomatoes. — A friend of ours tells us he has 
 had no difficulty for several years in keeping tomatoes, 
 by placing tlicm when ripe simply in a barrel filled with 
 strong brine, and keeping them covered with the liquid 
 by a board on top and weight. The barrel is kept in a 
 dry, cool cellar, free from frost, and the tomatoes are 
 ready for use through the winter and till spring. 

Will some of our readers try it, and report the result, 
 to the Farm Journal. Tomatoes will be very abundant 
 this season from present appearances, and if the season 
 of their use can thus be prolonged by so simple a pro- 
 cess, it will be a great desideratum. 

Salad without Vinegar. — Editor Farm Journal — Dear 
 Sir: — I lately had the pleasure of eating a dish of salad 
 which was so deliciously dressed, that I obtained the re- 
 cipe to send it for the benefit of your readers : 

Take the yolks of two hard boiled eggs, and wash 
 them well on a plate, adding the juice of half a lemon; 
 cut fine a large crisp head of salad and mix well with 
 the egg ; give a top-dressing to the whole of two or 
 three large table spoonfuls of fine white sugar. The 
 quantity of lemon juice and sugar, of course, depend 
 much on the size of the heads and the taste of the eater. 
 Salad so dressed will be found the "ne plus ultra." 

Yours, P. K. 

The above is rather late for this season, having been 
 intended for our last number, but was not received until 
 after our form had gone to the foundry to be stereotyped. 
 Our lady friends may bear it in mind until next spring. 
 About Cleaning W.\ll Paper. — "In your last paper 
 it is stated, that the very best method of cleaning wall 
 paper is to sweep ofi' the dust and then rub the surface 
 with stale bread. This may be one of the lest ways, but 
 it is not first best, as they say at the county fairs. I can 
 clean wall paper just as nicely, with less than half the 
 time and labor, by taking a quantity of wheat bran, say 
 two quarts at a time, and enclosing it in a piece of thin, 
 open flannel cloth — so that the bran will work tlirough 
 — and rubbing the paper with this, shifting and shaking 
 up the bundle once in a while to keep the surface fresh. 
 Another advantage of this rubber is, that it can be fas- 
 tened on to a broom or other handle, and then you can 
 reach the top of the wall without getting upon a chair 
 or bench. If you have not flannel suitable, a piece of 
 strainer cloth or such like will answer. With tliis appa- 
 tus, wall paper that is badly smoked can be restored in 
 a short time, so as to look almost as good as new. 
 Grease spots can be considerably improved by fii-st rub- 
 bing them well with chalk, and then laying over them
