Indelible Ink. — Durable or indelible ink may be 
 made by dissolving a couple of drachms of lunar caustic 
 and half an ounce of gum arabic in a gill of rain water. 
 Indelible red ink is made by mixing and reducing to a 
 fine powder half an ounce of verniillion, a drachm of the 
 salt of steel, and linseed oil enough to render it of the 
 consistency of black durable ink. 

To Polish Mauouany Furnituee. — Rub it with cold, 
 drawn linseed oil, and polish by rubbing with a clean, 
 dry cloth, after wiping the oil oflF from the furnitui-e. 
 Do this once a week, and your mahogany tables will be 
 so finely polished that hot water would not injure them. 
 The reason is this, linseed oil hardens when exposed to 
 the air ; and when it has filled all the pores of the wood 
 the surface becomes hard and smooth like glass. 

Large Pumpkins. — Having had good success the past 
 season in raising fine large pumpkins, I will give you my 
 plan and experiment. The ground planted was a warm, 
 clayey loam, descending to the south. I planted the 
 20th of May, with corn and one and two pumpkin seeds 
 in a hill; used about one table spoonful of plaster, or 
 gypsum to the hill. The field was a clover sod, plowed 
 once and harrowed thi'ee times. AVhen the vines com- 
 menced to run, say one foot in length, I gave them a 
 careful hoeing. After the fruit was well set, or some 
 was six to eight inches in diameter, I covered the stem, 
 and a small portion of the vine joining the stem, with 
 moist, loose soil ; the result was, that roots directly from 
 the stem of the pumpkin were formed, and the fruit de- 
 rived sustenance, and plenty of it, judging from the size 
 and weight, which was from eighty to ninety pounds. —

To Make Washing Fluid. — A correspondent who writes 
 from Casco, gives us the following receipt for making washing 
 fluid :— 

Take, 1 gallon of soft soap, 2 quarts of soft water, 1 gill, 
 of spirits of tirpentine, and one quarter of a pound of sal soda; 
 boil them together for five minutes. When wanted for use, 
 put your clothes to soak over night, and in the morning add 
 one pint of the fluid, and then boil the cloths for fifteen 
 minutes, after which rinse twice, in cold water. — Maine 
 Farmer. 

be filled up again a little above the level, a peck or more 
 of leached ashes being applied also around each tree, 
 according to size. This application greatly promotes the 
 thrift and growth of the peach. By attending to these 
 recommendations, instead of being a short li'"ed tree, 
 having but two or three crops, and then dying off, as is 
 the case with many orchards, we believe it can be made 
 to live and be productive and profitable from ten to fif- 
 teen years at least, and perhaps longer. We know of 
 peach trees in this vicinity, apparently perfectly healthy 
 and bearing well, twenty-five years old. To those who 
 consider this plan too troublesome, we only say do with- 
 out peaches and make no complaints. Fruit of the best 
 quality cannot be grown without care and trouble, and 
 if it could, would not be valued so much as it is. The 
 yellows in the peach is far more difficult to manage, and 
 indeed no remedy has yet been found. Whenever it 
 makes its appearance, the tree should be exterminated, 
 root and bi-anch. 

Peach Worm. 
 In many of the papers at this season may be found 
 remedies for the peach worm. They may be called stan- 
 dard remedies, because they appear periodically year 
 after year. There is no harm in trying them, but the 
 only remedy we believe in and have found efi'ectual, as 
 well as simple, is to examine each tree, spring and fall, 
 with a knife tapering to a sharp point, hunt up the in- 
 truder and destroy him. If he is about at all, there is 
 no diflSculty in finding him immediately under the sur- 
 face of the ground, his presence being indicated by the 
 gum. Just below the surface the bark is tender, which 
 makes it the point of attack. In the hard bark above 
 the ground he cannot make an entrance, and to guard 
 against him below we have pursued the plan each fall of 
 exposing the trunk, by di-awing away the earth around 
 it down to where the large roots begin to branch out, 
 and leaving it exposed all winter. The bark thus be- 
 comes hard and impenetrable. In the spring it should 

Faulownia Imperialis. 

We have lately met in the streets of Philadelphia, 
 along the side pavements, a few specimens of Paulownia; 
 the top and side branches of which had been well shor- 
 tened in, presenting one of the most beautiful and effec- 
 tive shade trees we have met with for a long time. 

It is highly probable that the Paulownia will soon be 
 much sought for as an ornamental tree; the fear enter- 
 tained when it was first introduced from Japan, that, 
 like the ailanthus, catalpa, &c., whose spongy wood it 
 resembles, it would be liable to sucker, being proved to 
 be groundless, at least we have not observed this ten- 
 dency in quite a large number of trees in and around 
 West Chester. Another objection is the long straggling 
 branches, with the consequent liability to be blown off 
 by high winds, and its rather open head. This can be 
 entirely obviated by the shortening in process, as above, 
 when a compact, dense mass of beautiful broad foliage 
 is obtained, sufficient almost to turn a shower of rain 
 like an umbrella. 

As an offset to these di-awbacks, the Paulownia offers 
 as a shade tree, either for city streets or for country, 
 several very decided advantages: its entire freedom thus 
 far from insects, its unequalled strait and rapid growth, 
 broad leaves, beautiful blossoms, and ease of transplant- 
 ing. 

Where shade is wanted soon, nothing equals it. It 
 has made a growth with us of ten feet from the ground 
 in a single season, where it had been cut off close. The 
 second season a head will begin to form. The blossoms 
 are purple, show themselves very early in the spring ; 
 the little brown, button-like envelopes containing them 
 being curiously developed the fall previous. For street 
 planting especially, we consider the Paulownia well deser- 
 ving of extensive trial. 

Ammonia in Clay Soils. 

Professor Way, in a recent lecture before the Royal 
 Agricultural Society, made the startling assertion that 
 ordinary clay soils contain ammonia per acre, locked up 
 in their substance, corresponding to the quantity present 
 in three tons of guano. 

He also stated facts in relation to the use of lime,
