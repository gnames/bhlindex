 be applied at short intervals in small doses, instead of 
 large doses at longer intervals, which is the general 
 plan. 

The editor of the English Agricultural Gazette says : 
 •'When the lecture shall be published, the facts of which 
 it speaks, and the inferences to which they lead, will we 
 believe be seen to stand high among the very important 
 additions to agricultural truth, for which we are already 
 indebted to the chemist of the English Agricultural So- 
 ciety." 

We hope to condense some valuable facts from this 
 lecture for the Farm Journal. 

Gain of Weight in Cattle Feeding. 

A correspondent of one of our English exchanges gives 
 the following as the result of his observations on the above 
 subject : 

In the various publications to which I have had recourse, 
 with the view of informing myself as to the treatment of cat- 
 tle, I have found no attempt to estimate and distinguish the 
 gain of useful material made by them in the process of fat- 
 tening. On seeking to explain my views on this subject, I 
 feel less hesitation, as I supply data and figures from which 
 my conclusions are derived, the soundness of which it is not 
 difficult to estimate and ascertain. 

The cattle I prefer for fattening are well -grown heifers, or 
 cows which have had their first calf at three to five years old. 
 The breeders of this district are to a considerable degree 
 short-horns, the bulls used being more or less of this descrip- 
 tion ; they may be termd of 'fair' quality. Their live weight 
 when bought in a lean store condition, ranges from 7 cwt. to 
 6 cwt. ; their capability of carrying weight, when prime fat, 
 may be taken at an addition of 3 cwt. Although it is not 
 usual to kill beasts in a store state, and litle positive infor- 
 mation can be gained as of the carcase weight of lean stock, 
 yet, from observation and inquiry, I am disposed to think that 
 this will be less than one-half of the live weight probably 
 not more than 43 to 47 per cent. In Morton's Cyclopedia 
 treatise " On meat," the comparison of carcass to live weight 
 is stated as 50 to 55 per cent when half fat, and as 61 to 63 
 when prime fat, for cattle of the like quality. I quote this 
 as tending to confirmwhat I have stated as to the compara- 
 tive probortion in lean stock. 

I will consider, for example, a lean animal weighing 8 cwt., 
 and capable of weighing when prime fat 11 cwt., live weight : 
 when fairly started, and with proper feeding, I should look 
 for a gain of 14 lbs. per week, which in my practice is a 
 moderate avrage ; at this rate it would require 24 weeks to 
 bring it to a state of prime fatness. On comparing the 
 weights when lean and fat — 8 cwt. or 64 stones lean, at 45 
 per cent, will leave 28} carcase weight; 11 cwt. or 83 stones 
 fat, at 60 per cent., will leave 52| carcase weight. The difFer- 
 ance is 24 stones, or 14 lbs. per week, being precisely the 
 gain per week in live weight. 

During the progress of feeding there is a gradual increase 
 of interior fat of two descriptions — fixed fat in the loins, 
 commonly called suet, which will vary from 8 lbs. when loan 
 to more than 30 lbs. when fat, this is weighed with the car- 
 case ; and loose fat, or tallow, which counts as ofi'al. If we 
 take two beasts of equal live weight, and suppose, on killing, 
 one contains 9 stones of loose fat or tallow, the other only 5 
 stones ; now, though this loose fat counts as ofi'al, t is known 
 that the carcase weightof the animal with the 9 stones of loose 
 fat will bo heavier than the one with only 5 stones. A consid- 
 eration of this matter led me to infer that, with the increase of 
 interior fat, there occured a displacement of material in the 

process of evacuation. On inquiry of butchers of experience 
 with whom I deal, they tell me that it is a characteristic of 
 a beast, which " proves" well, to have a litle stomach. On 
 looking over the items of ofial they appear capable of littlo 
 increase or variation in one and the same animal, with the ex- 
 ception of tallow and of the stomach, in the weight of each of 
 which there is a difference of 100 lbs. or upwards. I observe 
 that the writer of the paper of which I have quoted attributes 
 this comparative increase in the carcase weight of fattened 
 beasts to its greater solidity, to hollows being filled up, and 
 protuberances being formed; it seems, however, clear that 
 this would equally effect the live with the carcase weight, 
 and therefore does not satisfactorily explain the matter. 

If my premises be correct, it will appear that besides the 
 gain of carcase weight (which is shown by comparison to be 
 14 lbs. per week on an animal which gains this in live weight), 
 there is an additional gain of interior loose fat which counts 
 as offal. From observation and inquiry I am led to think, 
 then, that this will not be less on the average than 3 lbs. per 
 week, or, in the 24 weeks, 72 lbs. of loose fat, making tog.ither 
 17 lbs. per week gain of useful and vendable material — a 
 result at variance with the impression I had before I entertain- 
 ed upon this inquiry. I may at some future time seek to draw 
 to the probable proportion and description of this material 
 gained in the process of fattening. Y.

We clip the following judicious remarks from the Ohio 
 Journal of Education, which, although not "agricultural," 
 we trust our patrons, most of whom are parents, will pardon 
 us for inserting : 

Onties of Parents to Schools. 

1. Parents should send their children to school constantly 
 and seasonably. 

2. They should see that they are decently clothed, and 
 cleanly in their persons. 

3. They should encourage them to respect and obey the 
 rules and requirements of the school. 

4. They should encourage them to be orderly in theii 
 deportment, aud studiously to regard right. 

5. They should encourage them to be studious, by manifes- 
 ting an enterest in their lessons. 

6. They should have a regard for the character of the books 
 their children read, and see that they read understandingly. 

7. They shoidd cultivate in their children habits of true 
 politeness and courtesy. 

8. Besides visiting the school and co-operating and 
 sympathizing with the teacher, they can do much for its 
 improvement and success, by manifesting at all proper 
 times and in all proper places, an interest in its welfare, 
 and a deep solicitude for its reputation ; by speaking well of 
 the teacher and of all his judicious plans; by palliating or 
 excusing his faults or failings, (of which every teacher must 
 be expected to have some; ) and by inducing their neigh- 
 bors to visit the school and take anintrest in its exercises ; 
 thus showing to their children, in the most convincing man- 
 ner, that they feel that their present employment is an im- 
 portant one, and that the duties of school are not to be re- 
 garded as of little consequence. 

Destruction of Bashes. 

The Boston Cultivator makes the following seasonable and 
 sensible remarks, which are alike applicable to Pennsylva- 
 nia and New England. We would simply add that "now is 
 the appointed time :" 

In many places there are grounds which cannot be well plow- 
 ed, that afford tolerable paBture,if not to much occupied by 
 bushes. The shrubs which are inclined to grow in these sit- 
 uations, are alders, briers of several kinds, whortleberry, Ac.
