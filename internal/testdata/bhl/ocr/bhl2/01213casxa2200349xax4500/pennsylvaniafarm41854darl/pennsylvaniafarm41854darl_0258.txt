where these are permitted to grow, they prevent the growth of 
 grass to a great extent, and make that which does grow sour 
 and worthless. 

The mode usually adopted for killing bushes, in such cir- 
 cumstances, is to mow them. The eflRciencyof this has been 
 found to depend much on the time of the year in which the 
 work is done. Cutting in winter seems to have little effect 
 towards destroying them; they start with the return of spring 
 and grow rapidly. The effect is nearly the same if they are 
 cut while the foliage is developing. All trees and shrubs 
 make their annual growth in a few weeks from the time of put- 
 ting out leaves. During the remainder of the season, the 
 wood hardens, and the buds of next season's foliage are set. 
 The juncture when the leaves have attained their full size, 
 and the growth of the season is checked, is sometimes called 
 "turn of the sap." The vitality of many plants is grcatlj' 
 impaired if they are cut ofiFat this time. But with another 
 species, cutting at another period — the last of August — is 
 most fatal. 

The black alder usually .grows in moist rich ground, such 
 is very natural to grass. From their rapidity of growth they 
 as soon occupy the ground to the exclusion of other veg- 
 tation, and appropriating the best soil to their use, they oc- 
 casion much loss. Attempts are often made to eradicate 
 them, which do not succeed, and this produces discourage- 
 ment, which induces the farmer to allow them to grow unmo- 
 lested. The result of trials at cutting alders at various sea- 
 sons of the year, have proved that the above mentioned is 
 preferable. We might cite much evidence in support of this ; 
 but, perhaps, what we have already said may induce some 
 to undertake the work. 

In killing briers and small bushes, hruisiiij/ sometimes an- 
 swers better than cutting. A tool called a "brush whacker," 
 had been used for this purpose. 

Briers and whortleberry bushes may be kept down by sheep, 
 after having been closely cutdowu with a scythe. It is necessa- 
 ry, however, to stock heavily in order to compel the sheep to 
 eat the bushes as soon as they start. If the bushes are closly 
 kept down for a year two, the grass will spread and form so 
 close a sward, on good land, that the bushes will have little 
 chance to gow. It is important that when the work is be- 
 gun it will be followed up. Once mowing may be partly 
 effectual, but if the sprouts are not cut at a proper time the 
 next season, the labor is in a great degree lost [Boston Cul- 
 tivator. 

Spare the Birds. 

On no pretext whatever should farmers or gardeners per- 
 mit their birds to be disturbed. Instead of killing them or 
 frightening them away, they should make use of every means 
 in their power to induce them to increase in number, and 
 become tame and familiar. The worst of them earn twenty 
 times what they eat, and then, what exquisite pleasure to 
 have your garden, yard, orchard, or wood, alive and vocal 
 with the music of the merry birds; plant trees for them, build 
 houses, if necessary, for them, and they will teach you less- 
 ons of domestic bliss — preach you sermons — and warble 
 you such hj'mns as you never heard elsewhere. Be kind to 
 your birds. Warn off, and if necessary expel all transgres- 
 sors upon your premises, who seek the lives of these de- 
 lightful companions. The law is now ample to protect your 
 premises. — £x, 

Do Soils Lose Their Manures By Leaching 1 

Not often. 'Tis only the coarsest sands or gravels, and 
 such as are almost wholly destitute of clay or vegetable mat- 
 ter, that permit manures to pass downward through them. 
 Nearly all soils .absorb the valuable portion of the manures 
 • which have dissolved by rains after applications, before it 

has decended five inchco'. To be satisfied of this, one has 
 only to examine the f-oil at the bottom of the barn-yard, and 
 he will find a few inches only that have become at all charged 
 with extract of the superincumbent manure. 

The true source of escape is by evaporation. -If only partial- 
 ly buried, or the soil is principally silicious and coarse, the 
 iimmonia, carbonic acid, and other fertile gases, which may 
 have been developed by decomposition, or dissolved by rains, 
 may evaporate from the surface or through the loosely as- 
 sociated particles of the soil, and pass ofi' into the general 
 storehouse of the atmosphere. And it is in this nearly all 
 manures escape from the soil. A perfect correction of this de- 
 fect, is to bury the maHures at a sufficient depth, and keep 
 the soil above, well supplied with vegetable matter both 
 living and dead. 

AVe have seen the principle above asserted most fully proved 
 by the appearance of a muck heap made by compounding 
 fish with loam. — When made with a single layer of Manhad- 
 den or Moss Bankers in the middle of a heap four feet high, 
 the oil and the other fertilizing matters disolved in the decay 
 of fish, has been found to mark distinctly to the eye and 
 smell all the superincumbent mass of earth, while it had not 
 reached four inches below it. — New- York Agriculturist, 

Fencing out the Curculio. 
 W. Maine, of Long-Island, constructed many years ago, a 
 tight board fence around his plum-orchard, about nine feet 
 high, with tight board gates. The curculios did not fly high 
 enough to enter, many striking the sides of the fence and 
 falling outside. An acquaintance who visited the garden 
 when in full fruit, informs us that all the trees xoithin the en- 
 closure where heavily loaded with plums ; at the same time 
 he observed a tree outside that had lost every specimen. 

To Keep Birds from Pecking Fruit, 

As the season is at hand for the depredations of birds, I 
 beg to report my experience of last year, when I saved my 
 cherries by hanging up several pieces of tin with strongthread 
 in the different trees two pieces being hung ne.nr together to 
 clash with the wind, which sound, with the bright reflection 
 of the tin in the sun, certainly frightened them away ; and I 
 had my due share of the fruit, which, the preceding year, I 
 was obliged to relinquish to them. So says a New Jersey 
 Farmer.

lianure for Boses. 

Thomas Rivers, in his last rose catalogue, says that for a 
 neat surface dressing for Autumnal Roses, to be applied 
 late in the spring, wood ashes and guano have proved most 
 excellent fertilizers, in the proportion of half a peck of 
 guano to a bushel of ashes applying two quarts of the mix- 
 ture to each tree, in a circle 18 inches in diameter round the 
 stem, and suffering it to remain undisturbed upon the sur- 
 face. The ashes retain the moisture from the dew and 
 showers, and the effect, in giving a vigorous growth, with 
 an abundant crop of the flowers in the autumn, has been very 
 apparent. In our dryer climate, an occasional copious wat- 
 ering of a thin grass mulching, placed over this compound, 
 would doubtless be of decided benefit, and during dry pe- 
 riods would in fact be indispensable. 

The Elm as a Shade Tree. 

What is our best shade tree? After some years of ob- 
 serving and comparing, we have no hesitation in saying 
 that here it is the Elm. The Rock Maple grows so slow 
 that people cannot be persuaded to plant it. The varieties of 
 the Soft Maple are scarcely to the Locusts for city planting. 
 They are so tender in their bark, and their liabilities are so 
 many, to get wounded, that it is a chance if two out of five can 
 be got to grow up healthy and strong trees. A little bit of 
 rubbing, the bite of a horse, or any similar thing, and 
 a wound is made where insects fasten themselves, and the tree 
 is ruined. The only way it can be got to come to anything 
 is, to protect it effectually, and cultivate it well, so that it 
 shall grow forward at once from the planting. One summer 
 of ill health is death to a Soft Maple. But'the Elm, while 
 more beautiful than almost any, has a constitution worthy of 
 a salamander. It cares nothing for insects, or cattle, or 
 horses, but grows right on against wind and tide : and one 
 Elm is equal to four Maples. 

[The experience in this region does not at all corroborate 
 the above from the Prairie Farmer, on the superiority of the
