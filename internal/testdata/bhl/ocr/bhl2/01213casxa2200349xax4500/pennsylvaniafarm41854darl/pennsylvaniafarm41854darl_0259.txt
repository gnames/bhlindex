elm as a shade tree. We have tried it in various locations 
 for four or five years past, and find that not only the English 
 elm, which is particularly affected, but also the Scotch and 
 American elm, are liable to have their foliage entirely eaten 
 and perforated with insects, so as to make them quite un- 
 sightly and undesirable. We would not think of planting 
 an elm tree for ornament. — Ed.] 

Osage Orange. 
 Mr. M. L. SuLLiVANT has a number of hands employed 
 sowing osage orange seed, of which he designs putting in 
 20 bushels, on a piece of bottom land near this city, with a 
 view to removing the plants to Illinois next year. If the 
 seed does moderately well, it will produce fco million plants, 
 which at 25 plants to the rod, will set two hundred and fifty 
 miles of hedge! Enough for a commencement on one farm, we 
 should judge. — Ohio Cutioator. 

Salt your Chimneys. 
 In building a chimnej', put a quart of salt into the mortar 
 with which the inner courses of brick are to be laid. The effects 
 will be that there will never bo any accumulation of soot in 
 that chimney. The philosophy is thus stated; The salt in the 
 portion of mortar which is exposed absorbs moisture from the 
 atmosphere every damp day. The soot becomes damp, falls 
 down to the fire-place. This apears to be an English dis- 
 coveiv. It is used with success in Canada. 

New York State Agricultural Exhibition. 

The annual exhibition of the New York State Agricul- 
 tural Society is to take place in the city of New York on 
 the 3d, 4th, 5th and 6th of October next. H.amilton 
 Square, comprising eighteen acres of ground and conve- 
 niently situated between two railroads, will be enclosed 
 and arranged for the occasion. The premium list ex- 
 ceeds $8,000. 

The exhibition of the Pennsylvania State Society at 
 Philadelphia occurring the last days of September, will 
 enable persons from a distance to attend both exhibitions 
 ■without inconvenience. We anticipate at both places a 
 turn out of people, and a display of stock, implements, 
 products of the farm, garden, conservatory, &c., yet un- 
 equalled in this country. 

Improved Stock. 
 We have received from Lewis G. Morris, Mount Ford- 
 ham, New York, a printed catalogue of his stock, which 
 he holds at private sale. It consists of Durhams and 
 Devons, South Down sheep, Suffolk, Essex and Berkshire 
 swine, all bred from the best sources, and comprising 
 some of the best stock now in the country. The prices 
 in most cases are attached, and vary fi-om $100 to 
 $2500 each for Durhams, $150 to $350 for Devons, 
 South Downs according to age and quality from $25 to 
 $125, Suffolk and other pigs $40 per pair at ten weeks 
 old. 

Allegheny County Society. 

The fifth annual fair of tlie Allegheny County Agri- 
 cultural Society for Western Pennsylvania and Ohio, will 
 be held at Pittsburgh on the 3d, 4th, 5th and Gth days 
 of October. We are in receipt of a neatly printed 
 pamphlet containing the arrangements for the same, with 
 list of premiums, embracing not only farm and garden 
 products, but also manufactured articles in great variety 

and fine arts. Handsome gifts, of the value of from $5 
 to $30, have also been conti-ibuted as premiums for lady 
 equestrians and lady drivers, who are to have certain 
 hours exclusively appropriated to themselves. A horse, 
 price $200, is offered to the best and most skillful rider; 

a fine Brocha shawl, price $20, to the second best.

Fulton County Society. 

The Fulton County Agricultural Society will hold ita 
 second annual exhibition in McConnellsburg on Thurs- 
 day, Friday and Saturday, October 26th, 27th and 28th. 
 A liberal list of premiums is offered. 

We should be obliged if the Secretaries, or other ofii- 
 cers, of our different county societies would advise us of 
 the times of holding their coming annual exhibitions. 
 We wish to give notice of all of them, but shall not be 
 able to do so unless this information is forwarded to us.

 ber, but failed to reach us.] 

Mercer County Society. 
 The Mercer County Agricultural Exhibition is to be 
 held at Mercer on the 19th and 20th of September. A 
 premium list is offered embracing a wide range of all 
 kinds of stock, farm implements, vegetable productions 
 of the fai-m, garden and fruit orchard, and mechanical 
 arts, as well as those of the household, and domestic 
 economy. Mercer is one of our best western counties, 
 and there will no doubt be a display well worth attend- 
 ing. The name sounds familiar to farmers of eastern 
 Pennsylvania, as the place where was delivered the cele- 
 brated "Mercer address" of our friend J. Gowen, which 
 excited so much attention. The name of the orator for 
 the present year is not mentioned. In the premium list 
 the Pennsylvania Farm Journal is made to form a part 
 of all premiums above two dollars. This example is 
 well worthy of imitation. We are surprised that our 
 Journal does not receive more patronage from county so- 
 cieties. 

Somerset County Society. 

The Somerset County Exhibition is to be held at Som- 
 erset on the 5th of October. A permanent enclosure of 
 four acres has been purchased. This looks as if Somer- 
 set county farmers are determined that their exhibition 
 shall be a fixed fact hereafter, and their public spirit is 
 to be highly commended. The premium list we have not 
 yet seen. 

Westmoreland County Society. 
 The first fair of the Westmoreland County Society will 
 be held at Grcensbnrg on the lltb, 12th and 13th days 
 of October next. We shall hope to hear of its complete 
 success, of which we have no doubt, as the farmers of 
 that region don't undertake any thing without carrying 
 it through. The Intelligencer says :
