All writers on organic chemistry, agree, I believe, that the 
 chief agents which promote the growth of plants, and without 
 which no vegetable matter can possibly be organized, are 

CARBONIC ACID, WATER, and AMMONIA. 

Now if these substances be present in any soil, it is pro- 
 bable that no farmer can fail to secure a fair crop, of any de- 
 scription, (furnishing seed, of course) because there are few 
 soils so utcerly bereft of the inorganic or mineral constituent, 
 as not to produce one crop — at least no soil which any rational 
 man would attempt to cultivate. 

How to accomplish this object is the question. Let us see 
 if it can be easily or cheaply done. 

Carbonic Acid, it is well known, is a gas, produced by the 
 decay of vegetable matter or loam, and by the breathing of 
 animals and men. These are the two chief sources of it. It 
 of course exists in the atmosphere, to a variable extent, 
 though not forming a part of the air as a body. 

The most ready way to secure carbonic acid in the soil, is 
 to add to it decaying muck, peat, leaves, straw, grass, weeds, 
 chips, tan, or any vegetable substance in a well rotted state. 

It is not necessary that these substances should have been 
 used as litter in the stable, or in the hog pen. It is only ne- 
 cessary that they should be well rotted, or so far rotted as 
 still to continue the process of decay, for during such decay 
 carbonic acid gas must be given off. It is not positively ne- 
 cessary that lime, or potash, or ashes, should be used to 
 hasten such decay, for if the materials be thrown into a heap 
 and wet with water, and occasionally exposed to the air by 
 turning, decay must take place. Potash, and ashes are the 
 best agents to hasten decay; better than lime, for many 
 reasons. 

If the soil bo very sandy, or if it have but little loam, and 
 the farmer cannot command an adequate supply of the ma- 
 terials above named to make a compost of, then he must have 
 resort to green crops turned under, to furnish the carbona- 
 ceous matter, if he can start a green crop. But you may say 
 that his soil may bo so poor that he cannot start even clover. 
 This is probably not true. I am of opinion that clover may 
 be grown on any soil, (themostsandy,) without muck or veg- 
 etable matter, by the aid of fifteen bushels of lime, one bushel 
 of plaster Paris, and three hundred pounds of guano to the 
 acre ; the guano and plaster to be ploughed under, and the 
 lime to be on the surface of the ground. 

If the soil be hard and compact, deep ploughing, and con- 
 stant stirring, will enable the air and water to penetrate it, 
 carrying with them the gas in question. If very loose and 
 sandy, ploughing should be followed by rolling as far as prac- 
 ticable. 

Water is the next substance to be secured. Too much 
 water is also to be avoided. I will not advise irrigation in 
 any of its forms, for this is difficult and expensive, and 
 few will or can avail themselves of it. Draining should of 
 course be done a? far as practicable, the more thoroughly the 
 better. 

To obtain the aid of water, cheaply and surely, or mois- 
 ture, (which is essentially the same thing,) there are two 
 convenient and successful methods, viz : flat cultivation, (as 
 opposed to the practice of ridging or hilling up) and sub-soil 
 ploughing. By flat cultivation you prevent surface water from 
 draining oS; And by sub-soil ploughing you permit plants 
 to go down to the reservoir of moisture in the earth below, 
 and also keep the earth so open that when the surface is 
 heated, moisture will rise by the same law which induces 
 vapor to rise any where when it becomes lighter than the 
 surrounding atmosphere. 

So you perceive, that if you only plough deep, and sub- 
 soil, and keep the surface of the ground flat, you will have 
 in any soil, a never failing supply of water, one of the chief 

agents of vegetable growth, if not the chief and the most es- 
 sential. 

Remember this : subsoiled ground rarely suS'ers from 
 drought 

Ammonia, or spirits of hartshorn, is the third general 
 agent needed to create vegetable matter. 

How shall we obtain this cheaply and in sufficient abun- 
 dance ? Ah ! this is the most valuable and costly of all, and 
 most difficult to be obtained ; but still the sources of it are 
 somewhat numerous. 

Every reader of any intelligence upon the subject knows, 
 I presume, that ammonia is found in comparatively large 
 quantities in all animal substances, such as flesh, hair, hide, 
 <fec., in night soil, in fish, in guano, <fec., <fee. But these sub- 
 stances are all costly and difficult to be obtained. Where, 
 then, shall we seek this valuable and powerful agent ? 

The larger portion of the atmosphere (common air) is a 
 gas called nitrogen, which is capable of being converted by 
 union with one of the elements of water into ammonia. 
 That the atmosphere does supply plants with ammonia to 
 any great extent is a debatable point in chemistry, because 
 not capable of perfect demonstration. But practice has 
 shown that such is positively the fact, for the finest crops 
 have been grown in fair loam, without manure, by deep 
 plowing, trenching and subsoiling, thus securing the pres- 
 ence of adequate supplies of air and water. 

My own opinion is (made up from theory, from practical 
 experience on my farm, and from the reports of English ex- 
 periments,) that good crops may be produced on any fair soil 
 by the use of seed, deep plowing, sub-soiling, and the most 
 thorough cultivation, without the aid of auy manure or fer- 
 tilizer, as the use of the means above named wUl secure, in- 
 fallibly, the presence of carbonic acid, water and ammonia, 
 sufficient to start the crop, and enable it to gather its own 
 appropriate food by means of leaves and its roots, from the 
 air, water and soil. 

It would, of course, be advisable to give tho crop a little 
 ammonia in the shape of guano, or otherwise, to start it at 
 first, and enable it to make roots and leaves, to begin its 
 work of feeding itself; but, as a matter of scientific fact, 
 seed, water, air, and the most exhausted soil, (no soil being 
 positively exhausted as many people suppose,) are all that 
 we need to start and grow plants, for in seed, water, air and 
 common soil (the most worn out) are all the elements and 
 agencies necessary to grow a fine crop of wheat. 

I do not, by saying this, mean to advise any body to go 
 and buy a sand heap, and try to raise plants in perfection 
 without manure, because this theory is true : for, although 
 true, it would be a hard truth to live by. But what I wish 
 to accomplish bj' this argument is this : I wish to show 
 young farmers, especially those of limited means, how much 
 nature will do for them if they will only plow, cultivate, 
 subsoil, and till the earth. Good manure is a first rat« 
 thing, guano is admirable, superphosphate of lime is 
 highly valuable, but deep plowing, constant and thorough 
 cultivation, and subsoiling, are equal to any of tho best 
 modern fertilizers ; and without the aid of the above named 
 means, he who buys guano and other rich manures loses half 
 the benefit he might enjoy by more thorough cultivation. 
 Don't cultivate too much land, but cultivate a little thor- 
 oughly, and you will get larger crops at less cost. Keep 
 more land in good grass and work the soil deeper and better. 
 Remember that air and water at the roots of plants (con- 
 stantly passing into the soil and passing ofiF) are as valuable 
 as guano.
