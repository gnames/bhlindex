cut its lot, and, in the opinion of the Committee, did its 
 •work very well. So well, indeed, was the work done, 
 that we could not come to a conclusion as to which to 
 give the preference, until we had an opportuniy of ex- 
 aming the ground after the hay was made and taken off; 
 and accordingly postponed our decision for that purpose. 
 Having viewed the ground after the hay was taken off, 
 we came to the conclusion stated below. 

The morning being occupied in mowing, we assembled 
 in the afternoon to try the reaping qualities of the ma- 
 chines. For reaping the following machines were enter- 
 ed, viz : 

McGormick's Mower and Reaper, of 1854, by Lloyd 
 J. Hunt. 

Manny's Mower and Reaper, of 1854, by John Poin- 
 sett. 

Manny's Mower and Reaper, of 1853, by Tylee W. 
 Burr. 

Manny's Mower and Reaper, with Wood's improve- 
 ment, by Hartshorne White. 

Manny's Improved Mower and Reaper, by Elisha and 
 Edwin Roberts. 

Atkiu's Mower and Self-raking Reaper, by John 
 Brown. 

This last named machine did not compete for mowing, 
 because, as your committee understood, some part of the 
 machinery to be used in mowing had not yet reached the 
 purchaser, Mr. Brown. 

The wheat had been portioned out in lots of about 
 half an acre each, and hei-e, as in the grass, after draw- 
 ing for their lots the machines stai-ted. They soon com- 
 pleted the task of cutting the grain upon their respec- 
 tive lots, and so perfectly did they seem to cut, that 
 scarce a head of wheat was to be seen standing on the 
 ground over which the machines passed. They all per- 
 formed the cutting of the grain so well, that we were 
 obliged to look beyond that for something else to base a 
 preference for one over the other. The self-raker at- 
 tached to Atkins' machine performed its work to the ut- 
 ter astonishment of all persons who had never seen or 
 heard of its performance. It enables one person to 
 work the machine, whilst each of the others require a 
 second person to deliver the grain, when cut, from the 
 machine. 

The estimation placed by the committee upon this ma- 
 chine may be seen by referring to the awards made by 
 us and announced below. The committee deem it an 
 act of justice to state, that although McCormick's ma- 
 chine did its work well, and deserves, no doubt, the high 
 estimation in which it is held by agriculturists general- 
 ly, yet, upon this occasion, it seemed to be out of order, 
 and did not do as good work as we think it capable of 
 doing when in good order. 

After much deliberation and hesitation as to what in 
 some respects should be our decision, we award as fol- 
 lows : 

To John Poinsett, $15, for the best Mower and Reap- 
 er combined, beuig Manny's Mower and Reaper of 1854. 
 To Elisha and Edwin Roberts, $10, for the second best 
 Mower and Reaper combined, being Manny's improved 
 Mower and Reaper. 

To Jerome & Ellison, $15, for the best Mower, being 
 Manny's Mower, with Wood's improvement. 

To Stacy B. Lippincott, $10, for the second best Mow- 
 er, being Allen's, made in 1853. 

To Hartshorne White, $15, for the best Reaper, being 
 Manny's Mower and Reaper, with Wood's improvement. 
 To John Brown, $10, for the second best Reaper, b?- 
 ing Atkins' Self-Raking Reaper and Mower.

Poultry and Eggs. 

A commercial contemporary in a recent article, based 
 upon statistical information says ; — The amount of sales 
 of poultry at the Quincy market, Boston, in the year 
 1848, was six hundred and seventy-four thousand four 
 hundred and twenty-three dollars, while for the city of 
 Boston, they exceeded four millions. The number of 
 eggs sold in Quincy market was 1,129,735, the price 
 paid for them being about $203,352, or an average of 
 18 cts. per dozen. The sales in the whole city, it is 
 supposed, fell little short of $1,000,000. The daily av- 
 erage consumption of eggs at three of the hotels, in 
 that year, was 200. 

The city of New York, however, is estimated, expends 
 a million and a half of dollars yearly, in the purchase 
 of eggs. Probably the amount in 1853 was much lar- 
 ger, as the above estimate was made 1848. One single 
 dealer in Philadelphia sends to this city daily, one hun- 
 dred bai'rels of this commodity. 

Ireland and France are great egg-exporting countries. 
 We have not the most recent statistics, but they are of 
 sufficiently late date to approximate to the present condi- 
 tion of the trade. M'CuUoch says that the amount paid 
 yearly by England to Ireland for eggs and poultry is 
 from £200,000 to £300,000. The yearly value of eggs 
 alone exported from Ireland to Great Britain exceeds 
 £100,000. The number is probably 70,000,000 and 80,- 
 000,000. The British census for 1841, gave an ad valo- 
 rem estimate of the poultry stock in Ireland, in which 
 each fowl was valued at only sixpence sterling. Accord- 
 ing to this estimate, it showed that in the province of 
 Leinster the stock of poultry amounted to £56,243; in 
 Connaught, to £35,216 ; in Munster, to £62,830, and in 
 Uulster, to £47,883 making a total of £202,172. But 
 even at this low average named, the amount pi'obably 
 much exceeds this, as the people supposed the inquiry 
 was made to obtain the basis of some new tax, and re- 
 ported the number as being less than it really was. 

The number of boxes of eggs shipped by the city of 
 Dublin steam packet company's vessels to London during 
 the year 1844-5 was 8,874. A box of the usual dimen- 
 sions contains 13,000 eggs, but occasionally larger ones 
 are used, containg four times that number ; so that about 
 23,565,500 are annually shipped from Dublin to London. 
 To Liverpool in the same year, in the same company's 
 vessels, were shipped 5,135 boxes containing 25,565 
 Qcrcts • giving a total export from Dublin to two ports of 
 England of 48,539,900, valued at £122,500. Since then 
 however, the trade has enormously increased.
