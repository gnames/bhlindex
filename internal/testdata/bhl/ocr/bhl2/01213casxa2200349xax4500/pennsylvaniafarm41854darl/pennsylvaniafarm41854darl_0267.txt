gium 90,000,000 of eggs the duty upon which (one pen- 
 ny per dozen) amounted to £34,000. Nine-tenths of 
 the foreign eggs imported into Great Britain are from 
 France. The importation thence in 1842 was 89,548,- 
 741 ; in 1843, 70,415,831 ; and in 1844, 67,487,920. 
 The yearly importation exceeds 80,000,000. The con- 
 sumption of eggs in Paris is estimated at upwards of one 
 hundred millions yearly. Supposing a fowl to produce 
 one hundred and twenty eggs annually — which is per- 
 haps a fair average — the reader may imagine the im- 
 mense stock of poultry that must be kept in France. 
 Any one who has travelled in that country is aware that 
 they are reared in vast numbers, they being the most 
 profitable stock on the many small farms owned or ten- 
 anted by the French peasantry,

Paschall Moi-ris & Co., who are agents for the above 
 machine in Philadelphia, recently submitted it to a Com- 
 mittee of the Franklin Institute, as entitled to the Scott's 
 Legacy Premium. X trial of it was made near the city 
 in presence of the committee, and its performance was 
 highly satisfactory. We insert below their report and 
 award of premium :

 Philadelphia, July 13th, 1854. / 

The Committe on Science and the Arts, constituted 
 by the Franklin Institute of the state of Pennsylvania, 
 for the promotion of the Mechanic Arts, to whom was 
 referred for examination, an automaton, or Self Raking, 
 Reaper and Mower, — invented by Mr. Jearum Atkins, 
 of Chicago, Illinois, Report : 

That they have carefully examined its structure, and 
 also made trial of it in actual use in grain and grass in 
 a mani.er adapted to test its capability of doing its work 
 in very unfavorable circumstances ; the field on which 
 it was tried being very uneven, and the rye that was cut 
 was much beated down and entangled. 

In the general form and arrangement of its cutting ap- 
 paratus this machine doos not diflcr materially from ma- 
 ny others in common use ; and therefore requires no de- 
 scription or remark with regard to these parts. Its 
 peculiarity consists in an apparatus termed "Self Ra- 
 king," which by an ingenious arrangement that cannot 
 well be explained intelligibly without the aid of a work- 
 ing model, causes a rake, armed with a few long fingers 
 to sweep at regular intervals across the receiving plat- 
 form, from which it gathers the cut grain and deposits it 
 in bundles ready for binding, on the stubble in the rear of 
 the machine out of the track of the horses when they 
 come round on the next swath. The combination used 
 to produce these results appears to be as simple as the 
 complex movements required will permit ; being compo- 
 sed essentially of a few jointed levers which receive 
 their motion from a point inserted in the dLsk of a revol- 
 ving wheel. These peculiar motions bear a striking re- 
 semblance to those of the human arm at the shoulder 
 and elbow jvlnts in the act of being placed a-kimbo; 
 now suppose a bundle of straws to have been gathered 
 by a scraping motion of the hand and held by compres- 
 sion between the fingers and the hip, while the person 
 turns on one heel quarter round ; then dropping the 
 bundle by extending his arm to an angle of about 45 

degrees with his erect body ; and while his arm is thus 
 extended turning on his heel back to his original posture 
 there to recommence these manouvres, a pretty correct 
 notion of the movements of this curious apparatus may 
 be obtained. 

The intention of the contrivance is to save the labor 
 of a man who must be employed on other reaping ma- 
 chines to throw the cut grain off the platform on which 
 it falls as fast as it is cut, and also to diminish the labor 
 of the binders ; who must follow with rakes to gather 
 the grain into bundles for binding. 

The trials made by the committee show that it can 
 perform completely the duty of the first mentioned ope- 
 rator, and also reduce the labors of the others. In con- 
 clusion, as it is believed that this combination is new 
 both in its form and application, it is deemed to be a 
 proper object for the Scotts Legacy premium, an award 
 of which is accordingly recommended by order of the 
 committee. (Signed) W. HAMILTON,

Danger of Fainted Fails. 
 The editor of the Scientific American publishes the fol- 
 lowing communication from James Manleo, of New York 
 with the advice for all persons to avoid painting pails. 
 A coat of varnish on the outside, is all the embellishment 
 we ever desire to see on a water pail : 

"The oxide of lead with which pails are painted, is a 
 dangerous poison, and I know that it is productive of 
 evil in many cases. Last week, having occasion to take 
 a cb-ink of water from a painted pail, which had been in 
 use for some months, I was convinced by the taste of the 
 water, that it had taken up a portion of the paint, and 
 having analyzed the water, I found it to contain a very 
 minute quantity of it, sufficient however, if a large 
 amount of water were taken, to produce those fearful 
 diseases peculiar to lead poisonings." 

Flanting Strawberries. 

Strawberries may be planted out this month, and will 
 yield a moderate crop of fruit next season. Advantage 
 should be taken of a damp spell of weather, and the 
 ground kept well mulched, and watered if necessary. 
 Young plants should he selected, and the roots well pud- 
 dled in soft mud, before planting. Where a large plan- 
 tation is to be made, we would recommend it should bo 
 deferred till spring, as the produce coming season, from 
 planting now will not compensate, for the care and trou- 
 ble required. Unless thej' become well rooted and es- 
 tablished before winter they are liable to be thrown out 
 by frosts and perish. 

Ground for strawberries should always be trenched or 
 subsoiled and well manured. No crop will be more ben- 
 efitted, by being able to extend its roots downward than 
 the strawberry.

 Wm. Harper, Esq., a gentleman of this cit}-, has grow-

 different in their sexual characters. Their history, as
