was presented with some large and delicious apricots, 
 and brought two of the pits home and gave them to his 
 Bister (a young lady gardener) ; she planted them in a 
 box of earth in the cellar, and in the following spring 
 they sprouted and were planted where they now grow ; 
 since then they have never been transplanted, gi-afted 
 nor pruned. The trees are now about eighteen feet tall 
 with wide spreading heads, and stand so close that some 
 of their branches mix ; they bloom profusely at the same 
 time every spring. One has borne a plentiful crop of 
 fruit each for the last six years, the other has never set 

a fruit, and although its stamens and pistils appear 
 large, they are without pollen, stigma and germen. 
 Now one or other of these trees refutes the doctrine 
 lately promulgated, "all varieties of plants when left to 
 themselves take the sexual characters of their originals." 
 The next query is, would scions or buds of the barren 
 tree, worked on other stocks, produce fruit. Mr. Har- 
 per will no doubt part with a few twigs for experiment, 
 so that those who believe in sexual mutation can con- 
 vince themselves of the wisdom or folly of their theory.

Insects on Silver Maple and Linden Trees. 

Messrs. Editors: — The appearance of white downy, 
 or cotton like globular tufts upon the branches of the 
 Silver Maple and Linden trees in and about our city, 
 has been the subject of much curiosity and speculation 
 for more than a week past. Although their appearance 
 is not entirely new to me, yet I never saw them in such 
 vast numbers as they are on the trees in East King street 
 near the new Court House. On examining one of the 
 downy tufts under a glass, I found it contained 564 liv- 
 ing insects, and over .300 eggs not hatched. As it was 
 one of the smaller ones, it would be a fair computation 
 to set down 1000 to each globular mass. On a branch 
 one foot in length I counted 60 of these tufts, and allow- 
 ing 100 feet of branches infested with them, we would 
 have the enormous number of 6,000,000 of insects on a 
 single tree, which, I think, falls short of the reality in 
 reference to one of the trees alluded to. 

Each tuft is partially covered by a scale or "scab-like" 
 process, with one end adhering to the branch, and ap- 
 proximating in color and appearance to it. This is the 
 parent female and is the production of last year's de- 
 posit. All on the trees alluded to have doubtless sprung 

from a few, perhaps not more than a dozen, that ma- 
 tured there last year. 

The insect belongs to the genus coccus (bark-lice) of 
 the order hemiptero. According to Dr. Harris, an emi- 
 nent entomologist of Boston, Mass., they may be de- 
 stroyed by taking in the proportion of eight quarts of 
 water, two quarts of soft soap and sufficient lime to make 
 it to the consistency of white wash, and giving the 
 branches a thorough painting with the mixture. Where 
 trees only contain a few, I would recommend a small 
 swab put on the end of a pole and dipped in thick tar, 
 to which the cotton globules will adhere. Thus thou- 
 sands may be removed and destroyed. Swabing with a 
 solution of common salt will destroj' those who have es- 
 caped from their nests. As these insects belong to the 
 suctorial class, and live entirely upon the sap of the 
 trees, there is no telling the amount of injury that may 
 be done in another year. As I intend to publish an ex- 
 tended article upon these insects after I have more fully 
 investigated them, I deem these few hints sufficient now. 
 Yours, &c., very truly, S. S. RATHVON.
