 Daily, but having had further opportunities of observa- 
 tion, Mr. R. has kindly acceded to our request, and no-

Mr. Editor: — I am able to add little more to the his- 
 tory of the insect alluded to in the foregoing communi- 
 cation, that is of much importance to the general reader, 
 any more than that it seems to be more abundant on 
 some trees in this vicinity the present season than it was 
 the last. From my own trees I removed all I could find 
 last season, and cannot discover any there now. I, how- 
 ever, permitted them to remain upon the main stem of a 
 common wild rose bush, which was destroyed entirely as 
 far down as the surface of the ground. This I do not 
 think would be the case with trees of vigorous growth in 
 one, or even two or three seasons. I observed in trim- 
 ming ray trees in the spring, that tiiose limbs from which 
 these insects had been removed had not the smooth 
 healthy appearance of those where they had not been, 
 on the contrary they looked scruffy and diseased. 

They are even much more numerous this season than 
 the calculations I made on a former occasion. On a sin- 
 gle branch brought to me, only 14 inches in length, there 
 were over 150,000 of the eggs and young insects, a por- 
 tion of which branch is represented in the above illus- 
 tration; it is from a silver leaved maple tree, (^Acer dasy- 
 carpitm.) 

The female is a brownish yellow on the back (1) until 
 all the eggs are deposited, when she dies and turns to a 
 darker color, and resembles what is known in common 
 language as a "scab." Beneath (2) the female is of a 
 dirty bluish-white, without any appeai'ance of feet, and 
 adhering closely to the bark of the smaller branches of 
 trees by a simple anterior process, which I have not yet 
 been able distinctly to discover. The posterior portion 
 of the body of the female is free, to which is attached a 
 "globular mass" of white, very elastic cotton like fibre, 
 which serves as a shield or protection to the eggs. The 
 eggs (3) are white or yellowish white, in shape similar 
 to a common hen's egg and so minute as to be scarcely 
 perceptible to the naked eye. The young (4) immedi- 
 ately after exclusion are also very minute, yellowish 
 white, with a brownish line down the middle of the body, 
 legs and antenna white, nearly of equal length, and the 
 latter terminated by a seta or diverging hairs. The ab- 
 domen is terminated by two very slender, white, hair-like 
 appendages about two-thirds the length of the body; 
 there are also a few spiney hairs upon the legs and the 
 anterior margin of the antenna, at the base of which are 
 the eyes which are black and distinct. They occur in 
 such countless millions that I propose to name the insect 
 ooccus innumerabilii until a better or a prior one may be 
 found ; — for I have never yet seen a description of them 
 any where. I placed two small branches (each about a 
 foot in length) in a perpendicular position in a basin of 
 water, in order that the insects might not escape, and 
 that I might be enabled to observe their gradual develop- 
 ment, but they fell in such vast numbers into the water, 
 that their dead bodies formed a bridge over which many 
 of those later hatched passed to the outer rim of the 
 basin. It is impossible to estimate the injury that may 
 be done by them under circumstances favorable to their 
 development. There are certainly vast numbers of them 
 17 

destroyed one way or other : — By heavy showers of rain 
 and storm, for although they are tolei-ably active, yet so 
 delicate are they that in their incipient stages thej' are 
 easily destroyed. Many of them also furnish sustenance 
 to other predaceous insects, as I observed the larva, and 
 also the adult of a species of "lady-bird" (ehilocorus bi- 
 vulnerus Muls.), in considerable numbers upon some 
 trees noar my residence that were infested with the coc- 
 cus. 

I have not been enabled yet to see or identify the 
 adult male ; he certainly does not survive the winter as 
 there seems to be no necessity for him. I presume, how- 
 ever, he will not be found to differ much from the young, 
 except the addition of wings, an extension of the anal 
 filaments, and a perceptible increase in size. 

These insects are usually found arranged along the 
 sides and underneath the small and smooth branches of 
 the trees they infest. In the early part of spring they 
 are scarcely perceivable, being small scaly appearances 
 that might be readily taken for something naturally be- 
 longing to the bark of the ti-ee. About the middle of 
 May the white cotton-like substance begins to appear, at 
 which time the females commence depositing the eggs, 
 which is accomplished in the beginning of June ; about 
 the 10th of which month the hatching process commences 
 and continues for a week or ten days, when the yotmg 
 come forth from the cover that has hitherto protected 
 them, and scatter in every direction over the trees. In 
 the foregoing illustration the female is represented as 
 the natural size, but the young and the egg are both 
 greatly magnified. 

For a further description of cocci in general, and the 
 injuries that vegetation sustains from them, see Harris' 
 Treatise, p. 218, Maunder's Treas. Nat. His., p. 137, 
 Harper's Fam. Lib., p. 1G7, &c. 

Since writing the foregoing, I have observed that 
 those trees that were infested by the above insects ex- 
 tensively last j'ear have been more or less injured: many 
 of the smaller branches being entirely dead at the ex- 
 tremities, and new buds having shot out nearer the base. 
 This would seem to suggest the propriety of "heading 
 in" all the branches early next season, and making use 
 of the wash recommended. I treated my own trees so 
 and now there are no insects present, and the trees have 
 acquired an additional density of foliage and beauty; 
 whereas those in other places, left with nothing done to 
 them, have the insect in greater numbers this season, 
 and all in proximity to them, also, more or less infect- 
 ed. 

The "silver leaved maple" (Acer dasycarpum, Esh.) 
 seems to be the greatest suflTerer, and there is not a 
 doubt of the partiality of the insect for that particular 
 tree, although they are also found on others when stand- 
 ing near them. In addition to the larvae of tlie "lady- 
 bird" mentioned, I have also observed the larvaj of a 
 "lace-wing" [Ilemerobius) very actively engaged in their 
 destruction, and from the summary and adroit manner 
 in which they "pick them up," I have no doubt thou- 
 sands are thus destroyed daily; but this even seems to 
 be a slow process compared with the countless millions 
 that are brought forth at a single brood. After the 
 young insects have all left the parent nest, they leave a 
 concretion of such fine, white, elastic and soft fibre at-
