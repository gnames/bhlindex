Lightning Rods. 
 Friend Daklington : — Allow me a small niche in the 
 Farm Journal for a few brief remarks concerning light- 
 ning rods. 

"Led by the phosphor light, with daring tread, 

Immortal Franklin sought the fiery bed 

Where nursed in night, incumbent Tempest shrouds 

His embryo thunders in circumfluent clouds, 

Besieged with iron points their airy cell, 

And pierced the monsters slumbering in thoir shell." 

Yes ! the memory of Franklin has been immortalized 
 by the sublime idea of the identity of electricity, as ex- 
 cited by the friction of a glass tube, and the lightning, 
 which glares in the heavens, and rends the sturdy oiik 
 with its desolating stroke — and, still more, by the grand 
 conception and bolder execution of the proof of its cor- 
 rectness. This once established, it was a natural and 
 easy inference that they are governed by the same laws; 
 and consequently that a pointed metalic rod, properly 
 circumstanced, would silently draw off the lightning 
 from the cloud before it came within striking distance of 
 an object, just in the same manner which it was known 
 to do from the prime conductor of his electrical machine. 
 The prime conductor very aptly representing the cloud, 
 and the table the earth in miniature. Brilliant, but in 
 some instances disastrous, experiments verified the truth 
 of the inference. In accordance with these views, light- 
 ning rods have been extensively employed for the pro- 
 tection of life and property, and the security which they 
 afford has been obvious. It must, however, be acknowl- 
 edged that the protection has not been complete. Too 
 often, instead of preventing an explosion, as in theory 
 they ought to do, the rod has been struck, and after 
 following it to, or near to, the surface of the earth, the 
 fluid has left the conductor, and, by a kind of lateral 
 stroke, passed into the basement of the building. 

The purpose of this paper is to call my readers' atten- 
 tion to the cause of the failure alluded to. Either we 
 must more strictly attend to what we do already know 
 respecting the construction of lightning rods, or some 
 additional knowledge must be obtained before we can 
 confidently rely upon them for protection. It has been 
 usual to explain the failure by saying that dry earth is a 
 non-conductor of electricity, and when the earth ai'ound 
 the base of the rod becomes dry, it has the effect to in- 
 sulate it, and prevent the passage of the fluid into thp 
 ground. Tills is entirely correct, and, in many cases, 
 fully adequate to explain the phenomenon in question, 
 but not in all. Where the rod penetrates far below the 
 surface in situations, and in seasons, where the earth 
 cannot possibly become dry, we must seek a different 
 explanation. 

In a case which recently occurred the rod was deep in 
 the ground, which was not unusually dry tlie yard around 
 the house was level, densely covered witii short grass, 
 and completely inundated with the falling rain. The 
 rod was struck, the fluid passed down it to the ground, ' 

then taking a lateral course passed through a thick stone 
 wall into the cellar, completely tore to pieces a dry oak 
 joist, and then passing out through the wall on opposite 
 sides of the house, cut paths through the grass across 

CU 

both the front and back yards. The diagram will show 
 this curious freak more clearly : a. the rod at the west 
 end of the house ; b. the joist which was torn to pieces; 
 c. c. paths through the yard, about an inch wide, in 
 which the grass was cut off very close, with the appear- 
 ance of having been scorched, and the fragments scat- 
 tered many feet around. 

It is generally admitted that the electric charge re- 
 sides upon the surface of the charged body, and that a 
 kind of electrical atmosphere is formed around it, the 
 density and extent of which is mainly proportionate to 
 the intensity of the charge. This is the result of the 
 combined action of two forces — the attraction between 
 the body so charged and the electric fluid, and the repul- 
 sion between the particles of the fluid itself. But if this 
 is true when a body is permanently charged, or when 
 the fluid is in a state of repose, it must be equally true 
 when the charge is only transient, or when the fluid is in 
 a state of transition along the charged body, as from the 
 cloud to the earth. Any circumstance in the construc- 
 tion and adaptation of the rod, which would prevent the 
 formation, or impede the transition of this electrical at- 
 mosphere, must have the effect of rendering it inopera- 
 tive. 

If the views thus briefly noticed are correct, it would 
 not seem unreasonable to suppose as the earth becomes 
 compacted and consolidated around the base of the rod, 
 that it must prevent or very much impede the passage 
 of an electric atmosphere along that portion of the con- 
 ductor which is beneath the surface. The idea may be 
 original for what I know, but I am willing to throw it 
 out for the con|ideration of those who are more conver- 
 sant with electrical science, and possessed of better 
 means of testing its truth by direct experiment. If 
 nothing more, it may elicit further inquiry upon this in- 
 teresting subject. E. M.

"Wheat vs. Cheat," &c., Answered. 

Mr. Darlington : — The prevalence of the erroneous 
 idea, that wheat turns to cheat, seems to be fraught with 
 so much mischief to the best principles of farming, that, 
 though myself an humble backwoodsman, I cannot for- 
 bear casting in my mite, with others, to endeavor to 
 repel the encroaching evils whenever an opportunity 
 offers. 

Mr. Miller, of Northumberland county, thinks he has 
 arrived at something "conclusive" when he finds a ten 
 acre field, after producing two succesive crops of wheat, 
 without cultivation, fail of producing the third, and for 
 want of a suitable kind of seed, bring nothing but a 
 crop of cheat. There are some farmers who have met
