THE FARM JOURNAL. 

[August 

itim. Will H. J. hunt up a pen of twenty-five or fifty 
 hogs in Chester county to beat it, and not to pick out five 
 or six of the premium hogs and want us to beat them, 
 but take a large pen ? 

I should be pleased if H. J., and his neighbors, would 
 visit our exhibition, to be held at Woodbury, on the 19th 
 of September, where he can see something beside hogs, 
 sweet potatoes and water-melons.

Digging Machines. 

As there is considerable speculation among farmers, 
 about the merits of the new digging machines, which, it 
 is said, will supersede the plow, we have been looking 
 for some account of its progress in England, and find in 
 a late number of the English Agricultural Gazette, a 
 letter from a farmer who purchased one in 1853, and 
 says his favorable impression is confirmed by another 
 year's trial of it. He has used it on all his turnip fal- 
 lows, and found it superior to any other implement, both 
 in the economy of labor and the excellency of its work. 
 He finds two horses and three bullocks, will do three 
 acres per day, on a strong retentive loam. 

To Preserve Fence Posts. 
 A writer, E. H., in the Rural New Yorker, speaks con- 
 fidently of the following preserving posts: — "I prepare 
 my posts for setting, and then let them season. I then 
 take coal tar, and paint them with three coats of the 
 same. I paint the post from about four inches above 
 ■where they set in the ground to the bottom, and the end 
 that sets in the gi'ound also, — putting the paint on hot. 
 A gentleman informed me that he had known a fence 
 set in this way, that had stood forty years, and was as 
 permanent then as at first. I think this way is easier 
 and cheaper than lime, and more durable." 

Work for the Month. 
 Farm. — At no season of the year is greater care re- 
 quired to prevent weeds from going to seed than during 
 tliis month. Remember that weeds, like some other 
 things, grow from seed, and that if they be entirely jn-e- 
 vented from seeding, the seed now in the earth will soon 
 be exhausted, and that the prudent farmer will only 
 have to contend against those blown by the wind, or 
 washed by i-ains from the fields of his more careless 
 neighbor. The cultivator and the hoe should be in re- 
 quisition in the corn field, among potatoes, &c., and the 
 briar scythe should now be used wherever required. 
 Briars cut the early part of this month are less liable to 
 sprout than if cut at any other season. Weeds, &c., 
 may be gathered into heaps and composted with ashes, 
 soil or other substance, but care should be taken that 
 the seeds be well rotted before the compost is used. 
 When there is danger of this not being the case they 
 had better be burned. Large potatoes should bo kept 
 well cultivated, which obviates to some extent the eifect 
 of dry weather, usually prevalent this month. Gi'ound 
 for wheat should be plowed as soon as oats is gather- 
 ed, and allowed to lay till towards seeding time, when 
 guano or manure should be spread and plowed in. Twice 

plowing, and the consequent fine pulvei'ization, greatly 
 facilitates the germination of grass seed, and enables the 
 drilling to be much better done. The advantages of 
 drilling over broadcast sowing have been so fully tested, 
 that it is presumed no good farmer will continue the lat- 
 ter if a ch-ill can be obtained. Much of time after har- 
 vest and before seeding is occupied with hauling out ma- 
 nure. This should be spread evenly, and plowed in as 
 soon afterwards as possible. Much of the manure now 
 taken on may be compared to the dregs of tea, after re- 
 peated infusions to obtain all its strength. The usual 
 practice of letting it lay exposed in yai'ds all summer, 
 open to sun and rains, will have dissipated the best and 
 largest portion of its virtue. What little is left had bet- 
 ter be saved by plowing in at once. Turnips should now 
 be sown on ground vacant from early potatoes, or other 
 removed crops. Drilling in rows will admit of easier 
 cultivation and management. Feeding cattle and cows 
 suffer considerably this month in their condition from the 
 dry weather and toi-ment from flies. Where they have 
 access to shade and water to stand in and cool them- 
 selves, they abandon the open fields during the heat of 
 the day. This matter of shade trees for stock is too 
 much lost sight of by farmers. It is as grateful to them 
 in hot weather as us, and considerably promotes their 
 thrift and comfort. Milch cows now generally fall off in 
 their milk, and should have a portion of sown corn fod- 
 der occasionally. Have a lump of rock salt convenient 
 of access in each field. Ditches and drains should now 
 be opened and cleaned out, and the stuff hauled to the 
 compost heap to mix with the weeds. Cradle and grass 
 scythes should be oiled, and with other harvesting tools, 
 collected and laid avi^ay for another season in a dry place. 
 Those who enjoy a fire of dry hickory wood in the win- 
 ter season should remember this is the best month for 
 cutting it. It will now season perfectly, and not become 
 worm eaten. The same rule applies to oak and chesnut 
 for fencing purposes, which have been very fully proven 
 to last much longer. 

Vegetable Garden. — Keep the ground well stirred 
 and weeds destroyed. Peas may be sown for fall crop. 
 Carry off pea haulm and refuse stuff to the compost 
 heap. Cut and gather such hei-bs as are in flower, and 
 lay them in a dry and shady place. Take up onions and 
 onion sets, and prepare gi-ound for other crops. They 
 should be dried and hardened by exposure to the sun be- 
 fore laying away. Gather seeds as they ripen. In the 
 latter part of the mouth cabbage and lettuce may be 
 sown for cold frames. Also, onion seed to stand the 
 winter. Turnips, spinach and radishes may be sown 
 now. Earth up the celery as its growth requires. Trans- 
 plant endive. 

Fruit Orchard. — Pears, cherries, apples and plums 
 may be budded this month whenever the sap flows free- 
 ly, and the bark will separate. Buds for insertion 
 should be well ripened. Strawberry beds may jbe plant- 
 ed out, advantage being taken of a damp time. Finish 
 summer pruning of fruit trees and vines. Apply wash 
 before recommended to ti-unks of trees, if not previously 
 done. Thin out fruit where trees are overloaded. Cut 
 out all blighted limbs. 

Flower Garden. — Tie up dahlias to stakes, and at- 
 tend to general directions of last month.
