Farmers' High School. 
 A preliminary meetiug of the Board of Trustees, in 
 accordance with the provisions of the act to incorporate 
 "The Farmers' High School of Pennsylvania" was lately 
 held, but not much business transacted. A committee 
 was appointed to procure further legislation and to issue 
 an address. Another committee was appointed to solicit 
 subscriptions for the purchase of the farm. Judge 
 ] Watts is chairman of both committees. 

Uonongahela Valley Agricultural and Horticoltiiral So- 
 ciety. 
 This Society will hold their second annual exhibition 
 at Monongahela City on the 28th and 29th days of Sep- 
 tember. An excellent premium list is published, and 
 the Farm Journal, and agricultural periodicals of other 
 States, are offered as inducements to exhibitors, in addi- 
 tion to premiums in cash. Where societies are in their 
 infancy, as this one, and expenses of enclosing gi'ounds, 
 &c., heavy, the plan is a good one, as well as in other 
 cases, to offer such works as premiums. Wherever they 
 circulate they are sure to create a taste and enterprise 
 for agricultural knowledge and improvement. If some 
 few hundred copies of the Farm Journal were subscribed 
 for by each of the county societies in the State, and dis- 
 tributed as premiums, or circulated gratuitously among 
 their farmers, we are sure it would tell with good effect. 
 D. Moore is the President of the Board of Managers of 
 the Monongahela Valley Society, and J. W. Smith, Se- 
 cretary. A splendid horse ring for display of horseman- 
 ship is to be provided inside the enclosure. 

Dauphin County Society. 
 The first annual fair of the Dauphin County Society 
 will be held on the common around the arsenal at Har- 
 risburg, on the 13th, 14th and 15th days of September. 
 A most excellent address is published in connection with 
 the premium list by the President of the Society, David 
 Mumma, Jr., inviting the farmers, manufactures and 
 ether citizens of the county to lend their aid in making 
 this their first exhibition a creditable one. As is well 
 remarked, "to do so needs but the will." Dauphin 
 county contains some of the best farmers, as well as 
 some of the best stock, in Pennsylvania, and we have no 
 doubt the anticipations of the energetic President of the 
 I Society will be realized. An address is to be delivered 
 at one o'clocK, P. M., on the 15th, and a plowing match 
 is to take place on the same day at 9, A. M. 

Lawrence County Society. 
 The Agricultural and Horticultural Society of this 
 county will hold their fair this season on the 11th, 12th 
 and 13th of October. We obtain this information from 
 a letter from the Treasurer, but have yet seen no sche- 
 dule of premiums, and do not know of the place of ex- 
 hibition. 

Hontgomery County Society. 
 The Montgomery Agricultural Society will hold their 
 exhibition this season at Springtown some time in Octo- 
 ber. The exact time we have not yet ascertained, but 
 hope some one of the ofiicers will inform us. A liberal 
 and extensive premium li?t is published. A plowing 

match is to take place on the second day of exhibition. 
 A diploma and $20 is offered for the best farm not less 
 than 60 acres, reference being had to the general condi- 
 tion of the land, appearance of crops, convenient ar- 
 I'angement of buildings, state of fences, care of manure, 
 and good order of eniire property. Award te be made 
 on the second Monday of August, 1855. 

Cumberland County Society. 
 The first annual exhibition of the Cumberland County 
 (New Jersey) Agricultural Society will be held at Bridge- 
 ton, on Thursday, the 15th of September next. 

Tioga County Society. 
 The first annual exhibition of the Tioga County Agri- 
 cultural Society will be held at Tioga village on Wednes- 
 day and Thursday, October 4th and 5th. John W. 
 Guernsey is chairman of the committee of arrangements 
 and marshal of the day. There is also a ladies' commit- 
 tee of arrangement and a discretionary committee. A 
 large premium list is published, and the arrangements 
 are calculated to promote an orderly and satisfactory 
 exhibition both to exhibitors, spectators and judges. 
 We wish this their first fair the best success. William 
 B. Clymer is President of the Society. A plowing match 
 is also to take place. 

Delaware County Society, 
 Although an Agricultural Society has but very lately 
 been organized in this flourishing little county, they have 
 concluded to hold an exhibition (their first one) on the 
 14th, 15th and 16th of September, in the borough of 
 Chester. Very liberal premiums are offered for almost 
 every thing agricultural, horticultural and mechanical, 
 for the best flour, butter, cheese, ice cream, honey, best 
 cultivated flower garden, do farm, flowers, boquets, de- 
 signs, fruits, vegetables, hams, household manufactures, 
 manufactures of iron, steel, harness, boots and shoes, 
 bricks, cabinet ware, cotton and woolen goods, fishing 
 skiffs, and corn brooms. The miscellaneous list includes 
 every thing else. Our neighbors in Delaware county 
 propose to take a wide swath, and as they never do any 
 thing by halves, we shall expect an exhibition quite up 
 to, if not a little ahead of, the times. 

Importation of Cattle. 
 The valuable stock, both cattle and sheep, purchased 
 in England for the Ohio Importing Company, and noticed 
 in our last number, page 229, we are happy to state have 
 arrived at Philadelphia in the ship T. W. Bailej'. They 
 were landed in excellent order, except one bull which 
 died on the passage. The cost of the purchase was 
 about $20,000. One of the bulls, a year old in .January 
 last, weighs upwards of sixteen hundred pounds. They 
 were all obtained from the best sources in England, and 
 are one of the most valuable importations ever made, 
 and an acquisition to the substantial wealth of the whole 
 country. 

Proper Food of Man. 
 We have received from Fowlers & Wells, publishers, 
 308 Broadway, New York, a smaU work entitled "Fruits 
 and Farinacc*, the Proper Food of Man," being an at-
