Pennsylvania Horticultural Society. 

The stated meeting of this Association was held in the 
 Sansom Street Hall, on Tuesday evening. July 18. The 
 President in the chair. The display exceeded anticipations 
 for mid-summer, where little from conservatories could be 
 expected. There were six largo collections of green-house 
 plants, among which were many of much beauty and inter- 
 est. The new plants from Mr. Cope's were objects of at- 
 traction, especially so the Nepenthes lavh, a new species of 
 the pitcher plant in bloom. The finely flowering plants from 
 Mr. Fahnestock's were admired; the choice varieties of Mr. 
 Knorr commanded attention ; the flourishing specimens in 
 Mr. Buist's were noticed, and the well grown, large plants in 
 Gen. Patterson's and Dr. Rush's merited praise. The fruits 
 comprised delicions Grapes from three green-houses — the 
 BLack Hamburg?; AVhite Sweet Water, from Eden Hall ; the 
 Black Hamburg and AVhite Frontignac, from the Insane 
 Asylum, and the White Frontignac, from Mr. Cope's, were 
 specimens seldom surpassed at this season of the year. The 
 Peaches from the latter were very handsome ; the Goose- 
 berries from Mr. Baxter were large ; a Fig, weighing six 
 ounces, was brought by Dr. Rush's gardener. Apricots, 
 Pears, Raspberries, Gooseberries, etc., from various sources, 
 served to complete the exhibition of fruits. Vegetables of 
 the best quality came from A. L. Felten's and Alfred Cope's 
 grounds.

Deep Ploughing. 

The following extract from an essay "on worn out Lands" 
 by Charles Painter, we copy from the American Farmer. If 
 we mistake not, the author formerly resided a few miles from 
 West Chester, on what was then as well as now, one of the 
 very best farms in this section. No one is better able to speak 
 of the advantages of improved farming. 

"The practice of plowing dceji — deep ! cannot be too high- 
 ly recommended in every and all soils. Many farmers have 
 an erroneous impression, that if the sub-soil is brought to the 
 suriiice its apparent want oi strength v}\\\ injure the quality 
 of the surface soil: but if they will reflect that all trees, and 
 very many plants draw their nourishment from the depths 
 of the earth, where the plow cannot reach, it will be admit- 
 ted there must unavoidably be found there matter of a fer- 
 tilizing nature. The writer has seen the most astonishing 
 effects produced by turning up to the surface three inches of 
 vihsiihad been sub-soil! — in one instance where the landhad 
 been in cultivation under a ruinous system for more than 
 half a century, and had become completely impoverished, it 
 was made to yield at least two tons of clover and timothy to 
 the acre, without any other assistance whatever than deep 
 plowing. 

"There is no doubt whatever, that those two or three inches 
 of sub-soil now lying dormant under tens of thousands of 
 acres of ^)oor land, if brought to the surface and properly 
 pulverized and incorporated with the soil, would be equally 
 valuable with a costly application of manure. 

"It is not contended that wonderful results would be pro- 
 duced in cve'^y poor soil by the means above specified, but 
 where the virgin soil has been fertile, there, without doubt, 
 may the constituents of rich earth be found, perhaps hoard- 
 ing up for ages the very ftit of the land, and awaiting only 
 the plow-share to restore it to its destined uses."' 

Striped Bug on Squashes, Cucumbers &c. 

A correspondent of the Boston Cultivator, writes as fol- 
 lows about this destructive insect, and although we do not see 
 the philosophy of the remedy, it is so easy of trial as to com- 
 mend itself to the attention of the gardener who will please 
 report his success to the Farm Journal, 

"Last week the 'striped bug' came in showers, on my vines, 
 and in less than two hours the latter were covered with them. 
 It appeared as if they would be devoured. I put on plaster 
 (gypsum) but it did not remove them. I then put on a quan- 
 tity af coal ashes, about half a pint to a hill, by sifting it on, 
 and in less than an hour not a bug was to be seen. Then, to 
 try the comparative effect of plaster and ashes, I put ashes on 
 one hill and plaster on the next, and so on alternately, and I 
 found in all cases where the ashes were put on, the bugs left, 
 while they remained where the plaster was used. 

"I found my melons beset with the small black bug that so 
 often destroys melons and cucumbers. I directed my man to 
 put ashes on them, and I was much pleased to find the insects 
 immediately left them, and they have not re-appeared. I 
 feel confident that the ashes of either hard or soft coal will 
 prove a sure remedy for keeping bugs from the vines; and 
 as they are now considered almost worthless, I think we shall 
 find that no individual thing is made in vain."
