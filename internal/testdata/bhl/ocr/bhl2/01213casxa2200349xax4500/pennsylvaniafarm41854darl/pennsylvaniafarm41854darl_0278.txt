THE FARM JOURNAL. 

[Septembek 

It cannot be doubted that if an opportunity be offered to 
 the Farmers of the State by which their sons may be well 
 instructed in all the elements which compose a good English 
 education, embracing Mathematics, Chemistry, Botany, Min- 
 eralogy, and all these kindred natural sciences, the study of 
 which can alone make a perfect farmer, they would be glad 
 to avail themselves of it, when the entire expense shall not 
 exceed seventy-five dollars a year. While the youth is being 
 instructed in all those branches of science which at all per- 
 tain to agriculture, and his mind is being enlarged to greater 
 capacity for thought, he will bo engaged in the actual busi- 
 ness of the farm ; so that when he returns to his family and 
 home, it is but to continue his daily occupation, and with a 
 zest which knowledge always imparts to labor. His atten- 
 tion will not be turned to those professional pursuits in 
 which so few attain that degree of eminence which gives 
 them even respectability of standing, and in which so many 
 sink into utter worthlessness and even degradation. 

To call a young graduate from the unmingled literary pur- 
 suits of a College and its concomitant associations to the ev- 
 ery day occupations of a farmer, of which he knows nothing, 
 and to a society which he cannot appreciate, is a draft upon 
 his endurance well calculated to excite disgust. But give 
 him a knowledge of the reasons which Nature's God has as- 
 signed for all those things in which he is engaged : let him 
 understand the mechanism of the implement he uses, permit 
 him to exercise the dictates of his own educated mind 
 amongst his associates and others to whom it will be his 
 pleasure and pride to impart his information, and this, too, 
 ■with hands accustomed to labor, and you will ever after find 
 him pursuing the happy occupation of a farmer, with profit 
 to himself, great advantage to his neighbors, and a conse- 
 quent benefit to the interests of the State. 

If the Legislature at its next session will sanction this 
 enterprise, by amending the bill, and making such an appro- 
 priation as is here suggested, we have the most entire confi- 
 dence in the ultimate success of the work, and that there 
 will be more applicants for admission to such an Instiiution 
 than should be brought together at one point, and that this 
 will be followed by others to be located at different points in 

' the State. All of which is respectfully submitted. 

FREDERICK WATTS, Chairman. 
 This report having been read, and there not being a quo- 

•rum present legally competent to transact business, Mr. 
 Mcllvaine, of Chester, offered the following resolution, which 

■ Avas agreed to : 

Resolved, That the report just read be referred to Fred- 

• erick Watts, Geo. W. Woodward and A. L. Elwyn, whose 

• duty it shall be to address the people of the State on the sub- 
 .ject, and ask the next Legislature to amend the Bill as indi- 

■ cated in the report, and that said committee make all neces- 
 : sary inquiries where the Farmers' High School of Pennsyl- 
 'vania may be most advantageously located, and that they 
 Mnvite propositions from all parts of the State for its loca- 
 rtion. 

Address to the People op Pennsylvania : — We refer 
 ■you to the foregoing proceedings for the subject upon which 
 Tve address you ; and we can offer little else to explain the 
 object in view. There is no business in life which can derive 
 more aid from the light of knowledge than the pursuit of 
 ^agriculture. There is no business which can conduce so 
 much to human happiness as this — there is no business in 
 'which there are so many persons employed — all others in 
 •the aggregate do not make so many — and yet it is a fact that 
 .there is no school in our State adapted to educate a farmer. 
 It may be truly said that the Farmers of Pennsylvania have 
 ■never derived any advantage from the large appropriations 

which have been made by the Legislature to the several Col- 
 leges of the State. The price of an education at those In- 
 stitutions has always been beyond their means, and the 
 quality of it, when obtained, has added comparatively little 
 to benefit them. AVhat we now propose is to establish a 
 school where practical farming, and all the knowledge which 
 pertains to a right understaiiding of that subject shall be 
 taught, and that the product of the labor of the pupil shall 
 be ajipropriated to his education and maintenance, to such 
 an extent as to bring the price of learning within the reach 
 of those whose business and habits require the study of 
 economy. How many are there who, knowing the value of 
 an education, feel desirous that their sons should have its 
 benefit, and yet look around in vain for an Institution whose 
 teachings are so practical as to prepare youth for the pursuit 
 of Agriculture ? How many, too, fear the dissipations of a 
 town — the temptations of a period alone devoted to study — 
 the conviction that the son will be educated in mind and 
 habituated in body to a state of entire unfitness for practical 
 and active life? If this want is to be supplied, it behoves 
 those who are interested in Agricultural pursuits every 
 where, to interest themselves in the establishment of a "Far- 
 mers' High School." Individuals, who have no feelings to 
 gratify, and no interests to subserve, beyond the mere desire 
 to do good, are willing to devote their time and their money 
 to the organization of such an Institution. They, too, pre- 
 pose to appropriate a much larger sum than that asked of 
 the State, and the question is submitted to Iho reflection of 
 the people, whether they will not take an interest in a pro- 
 ject which so much concerns them, and urge upon their 
 Representatives the importance of the measure. 

With a determined purpose that this design, which promi- 
 ses such important results, shall not fail for want of an 
 effort, and anticipating the favorable action of the Legisla- 
 ture at its next session, we have been instructed to examine 
 into the subject of where the "Farmers' High School" shall 
 be located. It is very certain that its location will confer 
 great advantages on the community around it. The exam- 
 ple which it will afford — the knowledge it will impart — the 
 expenditure it will annually make — are matters worthy of 
 consideration, and will probably induce individual exertion 
 to have it located at different points in the State. We are 
 instructed to solicit and receive propositions on this point, 
 to be submitted to the Board of Trustees as soon as the In- 
 stitution shall have been organized. Any communications 
 on this subject, addressed to either member of the Commit- 
 tee, will receive a right direction.

 Natural Compo^nids of Lime — The Best Metliod of Using it 

— The Source of its Beneficial Effects, &c. 

In concluding the subject of lime, and the incidental re- 
 marks that its consideration has suggested, we will glance 
 at the most important compounds of it with other substan- 
 ces. They are as found in nature : 

1. Common limestone — lime and carbonic acid. 

2. Plaster of Paris — lime and oil of vitriol. 

3. Apatite — lime and phosphoric acid. 

4. Bones, shells, <fec., or common phosphate of lime, the 
 same as the last. 

5. Silicate of lime — lime and silicic acid (sand). 

6. Nitrate of lime — lime and nitric acid. 

It is also found in combination with arsenic, boracic, ti-
