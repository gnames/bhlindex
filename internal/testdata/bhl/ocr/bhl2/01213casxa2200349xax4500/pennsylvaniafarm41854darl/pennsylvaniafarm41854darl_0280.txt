load of sour swamp muck, would remedy the fault on a large 
 lime heap. Putting on very heavy doses of lime, as 60, 70, 
 or even 50 bushels to the acre undoubtedly subject it to a 
 greater proportional base, both from washing away and its 
 actions upon the aramonical compounds of the soil, and un- 
 less the difference between putting on 00 bushels at two dif- 
 ferent coats and putting it on at one coat will compensate 
 the loss, it would be best put on in smaller doses. In order 
 to decide such questions as these the farmer should be fa- 
 miliar with the theory of the action of lime, and ever be 
 ready to reckon in his own mind how far circumstances will 
 justify him in following out the theory. 

Without much difficulty in observing facts, we could es- 
 tablish the correct theory that plants require water to pro- 
 mote their growth. An inference would be, that in a dry 
 time the farmer should carry water to his fields and water 
 his growing grciin. But he will readily answer that such an 
 inference suggests a thing not practicable. This may be 
 granted, still it does not invalidate the theory nor disprove 
 the assertion, that a knowledge of it should be a part of the 
 farmer's education. If he have a very important plant, it 
 will enable him to suggest that it should be watered. If he 
 have a race or ditch running around a meadow, the theory 
 will suggest that it be opened to let the water flow out upon 
 the meadow. This may seem like a very simple case for 
 illustrating the advantages of knowing correct theories, but 
 there are thousands of cases, in which a knowledge of the 
 theory of the action of the agents that fall within the scope 
 of the farmer's avocation, would afford him vast service had 
 he a knowledge of them. He might find cases in which 
 they would not be practical, but he would not ignorantly 
 triimple on the inference drawn from the theory, and he 
 would ever bo prepared to avail himself of their advantages. 
 Those who study tlieories of agriculture, and make sugges- 
 tions from them, sometimes make many that the farmer will 
 recognise at first sight as impracticable, and he may be dis- 
 posed to doubt the truth of all the author may say, because 
 of this impracticable suggestion — at least he will conclude 
 that such knowledge is of no use to him. But, as in the 
 case of watering plants, the theory may be correct, and the 
 knowledge of it of essential importance to enable the agri- 
 culturalist to avail himself of it when it is possible to do so. 
 But to conclude, we have taken a glimpse at the history of 
 lime for the last one thousand years, have considered its 
 most important properties that interest the farmer, its rela- 
 tion to the vegetable kingdom in comparison with other sub- 
 stances, and finally its natural compounds and the mode of 
 applying thorn. Thus imperfectly glanced over we close the 
 subject. E. P.

 Atkins' Automaton Self-Raker, Reaper and Mower. 

Mr. Editor: — In the July number of the Journal you re- 
 quest information in regard to the different kinds of mowing 
 and reaping machines in use the present season, in order 
 that your readers may be enabled to form a proper estimate 
 of the value of each. With so many rival candidates for 
 public favor in the field, it is rather dangerous to assert the 
 superiority of any one machine over the others, and yet I 
 cannot withhold my decided preference for the machine the 
 name of which heads this .article. And in yielding to this 
 preference, I wish to be understood as entirely free from 
 prejudice, my opinion being based upon actual experiment 
 with this and observations of several others now before the 
 public. 

An all important feature in Atkins' reaper and raker is 
 the workmanship upon it. Involving as it does some of the 
 most beautiful movements in machinery, the parts are nev- 

ertheless so accurately fitted, that when once put together 
 nothing short of absolute carelessness or design can put 
 them out of order. Another advantage gained by this ex- 
 cellent style of finish is superior lightness of draught, and 
 .still another, the ease with which even inexperienced per- 
 sons may put it up .and operate it. The reaping parts are 
 as simple as those of any other machine, and are of the most 
 durable character, while the raker is so very simple and 
 and strong, that it appears almost impossible for it to get 
 out of order. 

The driver's seat being considerably elevated it gives him 
 a complete view of the operation of the knife, reel and ra- 
 ker, while the arrangement for throwing it out of gear is 
 within reach, enabling him to perform that operation, when 
 necessary, in an instant and without leaving his seat. 
 The front wheels relieve the team of the weight of 
 the machine, as well as the side draft, so objectionable in 
 nearly all other reapers. Besides these advantages every 
 part of the frame work is strong and remarkably well braced 
 and strengthened with iron where necessary. The differ- 
 ence of the style in which it is built is well worth the differ- 
 ence in the price between it and a number of other ma- 
 chines I could name. 

The arrangement by which the knife is operated is most 
 excellent, and the advantages are seen in the precision with 
 which it works, and its little liability to get out of repair. 
 I have not heard of a single instiince in which any repairs 
 were needed for the knife, or the gearing which drives it. 
 The pitman is of wood instead of iron, and the rapid move- 
 ment of the crank being regulated by a good sized balance 
 wheel, the great noise and rapid wear and tear of these 
 p.arts in other machines are in a great degree obviated in 
 this one. 

But apart from all other advantages which it pos.sesses, 
 there is one which must eventually place it in the front rank 
 of reapers, and which destines it to take the lead of all oth- 
 ers now in use. I mean the self-raking apj)aratiis. Not 
 being well versed in mechanics, a description of this truly 
 admirable invention is beyond my powers ; but although un- 
 able to describe the arrangement of its parts, I have seen 
 enough of its practical operations to satisfy me that it is the 
 only raker ever invented that will take the grain from the 
 platform of a reaper as it should be done. It is impossible 
 to convey by mere description any satisfactory idea of its 
 modus operandi. It is entirely sui generis, and must be seen 
 to be appreciated. 

I have seen it work with complete success in grain of the 
 lightest, as well as of the heaviest kinds, standing and fallen, 
 operated by a small boy, and drawn with entire ease by two 
 small horses. No man can possibly deliver the gavels or 
 grips from any other machine as regularly or as well as it 
 is done by this one, nor can the binding be done so easily 
 after raking done by hand. It has been objected to by some, 
 because it does not make the gavels of the same size in all 
 kinds of grain. Admit it. The raker is designed to make 
 a fair sized sheaf in good grain. By good grain, I mean 
 grain of the average quantity on good land. If the grain is 
 light, it is easier and speedier to double the gavels than it 
 would be to rake the same distance .after a cradler ; and just 
 as easy as to gather up the scattered gavels as delivered from 
 the generality of other reapers. Besides, the gavels are de- 
 posited in better style, from the fact that the raker holds 
 them with such force against the iron apron while turning 
 around to deliver its load, that the tangled straw is generally 
 laid nearly straight. 

But let us admit that it rakes only as well as it can be done 
 by hand, and still its advantages are great. On McCor- 
 mick's machine one hand only is necessary to rake off, but
