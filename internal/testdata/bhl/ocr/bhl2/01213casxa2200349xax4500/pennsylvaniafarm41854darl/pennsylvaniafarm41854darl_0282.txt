ment — got up by the inventors at Yardleyville, iu our coun- 
 ty, and being the first one made, it must bo acknowledged 
 worked admirably well. AVith a little more fixing, it promi- 
 ses to be a No. 1 machine in the catalogue of mowers. 

Bean's Mower is also something new — just come out; but 
 not being on the ground in time, no opportunity was alTord- 
 ed for seeing much about it. It is said to work well by the 
 one who tried it. 

Hallenback's mowing machine is probably the simplest of 
 them all in its construction, and none present seemed to 
 work more easily, doing it well, but cutting a swath some- 
 Avhat narrower than the others. 

Rugg's mower and reaper is entirely diflferent from the 
 others in its mechanical construction, except in the cutting 
 apparatus, which is somewhat similar in them all. The side 
 draught, a seeming objection appertaining to the others, in 
 this is wholly avoided, the horses walking behind it and 
 propelling it forward — moving in a direct line with it, and 
 walking upon the swath that is cut down before them, which 
 is six feet wide, considerably wider than any of tho rest 
 mentioned. The driver guides tho machine by a rudder-like 
 wheel attached to and immediately under tho seat on which 
 he sets. Inasmuch as it performs more work in its opera- 
 tion, so it necessarily seems to require more power to move 
 it. It performed in a creditable manner. 

The several portions cut by Manny's, Allen's, and McCor- 
 niick's machines, were done in a workmanlike manner. 
 They all seemed to get'along very well, and it would take a 
 very nice discrimination to perceive any groat diflTerence in 
 their performance. That the whole of the mowing was done 
 up in a style fully equal to expectation there is but little 
 doubt. As some ulterior evidence of it, the worthy proprie- 
 tor of the premises writes : "Sixteen largo loads of hay were 
 hauled from the ground mowed, and when raked off the 
 surface looked beautiful." 

The committee had not an opportunity of witnessing and 
 examining every part of the work performed, nor every 
 movement of the several machines; their attention could 
 not bo devoted to it thoroughly and minutely, consequently 
 they are not sufiiciently booked up on the subject to be able 
 to speak thereof as they would like : neither are they fully 
 prepared to judge and decide of the particular merits and 
 superiority which one machine possessed over another that 
 was presented on trial. They saw enough, however, to sa- 
 tisfy thorn of the practicability and utility of mowing ma- 
 chines (as well as reaping), and from what was exhibited 
 concluded to make the following awards : 

To Alfred Blaker, of Newtown, for Hallenback's Mower, 
 $10. 

To W. & C. Crook, of Now Hope, for Rugg's, $10. 

To George Goslin, of Newportville, for Allen's, $10. 

To R. T. Elkinton, of Philadelphia, for McCormick's, $10. 

Beau's Mower not arriving in time, according to the pub- 
 lished regulations, could not come in for a premium. Wil- 
 son & Moore's mower giving out, as heretofore mentioned, 
 debarred it from the same privilege. 

The reaping was done in tho afternoon, iu a field of well 
 grown wheat, which stood up remarkably well for the sea- 
 sod, and was estimated to make at least thirty bushels per 
 acre. This was also laid off in sections for each of the fol- 
 lowing machines, which wore entered and competed for the 
 premiums : 

McCormick's Reaper, of 1851, by Oliver Balderston, of 
 Solobury. 

McCormick's Mower and Reaper, of 1854, by R. T. El- 
 kinton, of Philadelphia. 

Rugg's Mower and Reaper, by \V. & C. Crook, of New 
 Hope. 

Manny's Mower and Reaper, of 1851, by A. Cornell, of 
 Northam])ton. 

Manny's Mower and Reaper, of 1853, by the same. 

Manny's Mower and Reaper, by Good & Gillingham, of 
 Solebury and Buckingham. 

The several reaping machines commenced operations 
 about three o'clock ; they all cut tho grain as well as if done 
 with a scythe and cradle — some of them better — and with 
 ease and expedition, and in some of the swaths which were 
 done the best not a stalk was left unsevered. But there was 
 more difference in the operation of putting off the grain 
 from the platform into suitable bunches for binding. The 
 machine itself, from the manner of its arrangement, may 
 havo more or less to do with this, but take them as they are, 
 it evidently requires the greatest skill and dexterity of the 
 person managing this part of the business to do it in a 
 workmanlike manner. Here is where tho greatest difBculty 
 seems to be, and perfection is hardly attainable by manual 
 efforts. An additional apparatus seems to be required to 
 make the thing complete — it is that of a self-raker, which is 
 understood to be already invented, and applied with admi- 
 rable success. 

After witnessing the performance of the several machines 
 (but they were not sufficiently tested in down, tangled and 
 whirled about grain), there was no hesitation in giving the 
 preference to McCormick's Reaper, of 1851, entered by Oli- 
 ver Balderston, and accordingly awarded him the full pre- 
 mium of twenty dollars. And for the best Mower and 
 Reaper combined, a like premium of twenty dollars was 
 awarded to Adrian Cornell, of Northampton, as the one used 
 by him, being Manny's, of 1851, was considered to be the 
 best one on trial. 

In closing this hasty and imperfect acconnt, it will not be 
 unappropriate to make honorable mention of the liberality, 
 kindness and public spirit of the fortunate possessor of the 
 beautiful and productive farm on which the exhibition was 
 held, in so generously offering it for the occasion, while at 
 the same time the hospitalities of his house were extended 
 to strangers present, to the committees and others — a large 
 number of whom availed themselves of the boon that was 
 offered. Such a laudable act of benificence on the part of 
 one who holds a prominent position among the farmers of 
 our county, who has so truly dignified his profession, will be 
 appreciated and gratefully acknowledged.
