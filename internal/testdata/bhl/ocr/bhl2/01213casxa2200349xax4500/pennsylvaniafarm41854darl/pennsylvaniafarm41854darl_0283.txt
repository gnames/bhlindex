The Guano Trade and its Horrors. 
 Frightful accounts are given of the manner in which the 
 guano trade is conducted at the Chincha Islands. The work 
 it is stated is done by contract, and the contractors some 
 time since imported as laborers about 600 Chinamen. They 
 are hired for five years, at the rate of forty-ei;;ht dollars per 
 annum, and the New Orleans Picayune .states that they cosn- 
 mence in the mol-ning as soon as they can sec to work. They 
 have five tons of guano to dig and wheel to a distance of 
 over one-eight of a mile. It is all so hard that it has to be 
 picked up, and if they do not accomplish the tons by five 

o'clock, P. M., they are flogged with raw hide whips, some 
 five feet long, receiving one dozen stripes, each of which 
 starts the blood, and then are driven back to finish their 
 work. The guano has a very bad effect on them, swelling 
 their legs and arms, and giving them sores on their legs, 
 feet and arras. Notwithstanding all these, however, if they 
 can get along they are compelled to finish their task. Our 
 informant says he has known .as many as thirty flogged in 
 one day. They have no Sunday allowed, with the exception 
 of one in a year, the same work going on upon the Sabbath 
 as during the rest of the week. The consequence of this ill 
 treatment is suicide in various forms, such as leaping from 
 the rocks one hundred feet high, cutting their throats, and 
 burj'ing themselves alive. 

Circular of the United States Agricultural Society. 

At a meeting of the Executive Committee of the Uni- 
 ted States Agricultural Society, held in the City of Wash- 
 ington, in February last, it was resolved that the Society 
 ■would hold no Exhibition in any State having a State 
 Agricultural Society, without the assent of the Officers, 
 or of the Executive Committee of such Society. 

The citizens of Springfield, Ohio, having requested 
 this Society to hold an Exhibition of Cattle, at that 
 place, during the current year, and generously sub- 
 scribed about ten thousand dollars to defray all the ex- 
 penses of the same, and to guarantee the Society against 
 loss ; and the Executive Committee of the Ohio Agricul- 
 tural Society uniting in the request, the Executive Com- 
 mittee of this Society have concluded to hold a National 
 Show of Cattle, open to general competition, without 
 sectional limit, on the 25th, 2nth and 27th days of Octo- 
 ber next, at Springfield, in the State of Ohio. 

The friends of Agriculture in all the States of the 
 American Union, and in the neighboring provinces of 
 Canada, are invited to co-operate w^ith us, so that this 
 Exhibition may be the more extensively useful, and be 
 alike creditable to the generous citizens of Springfield, 
 with whom it originated, to the contributors and visitors 
 who sustain it, and to the United States Agricultural 
 Society, who are so deeply interested in its success. 

In consequence of the holding of this Show of Cattle, 
 the contemplated Exhibition of Horses, at Springfield, 
 Mass., and the Show of Sheep, in Vermont, will bo 
 omitted. 

The Journal of the Society, which the Executive Com- 
 mittee have concluded to issue once in each year — four 
 numbers in one — will appear in January next ; and will 
 contain the Transactions of the Society at its last An- 
 nual Meeting, the Lectures and Addresses delivered at 
 that time, a full and faithful account of the Springfield 
 Show, with other valuable papers, by eminent members. 
 This volume will be forwarded to all members who have 
 paid their annual assessments for the year 1854.
