were bred by James Douglass, of Athclstaneford, East 
 Loihian, Scotland, and bought of him. They Avere 
 shipped on the John Bull at Liverpool, ]\Lay 29th, and 
 after a voyage of fifty-one days arrived at New York, 
 July 19th. They ■were brought over by Robert Stewart, 
 an experienced herdsman, in good order. 

The following is a list of the names, color, prices, and 
 ages of the Short-Horns :

They had in addition a Leicester Ram which cost $125, 
 and six ewes which cost $30 each. The entire importa- 
 tation, when landed' at their place of destinatination, 
 will have cost about $9,000. 

Ohio is doing more to-day than any two States in the 
 Union for the improvement of cattle, and the recent im- 
 portations to Clinton, Clark and Warren, furnish a por- 
 tion of the evidence of the fact. 

The instructions given to Mr. Douglass by our Warren 
 county friends, were to buy the best cattle to be had 
 without regard to price, and so we believe all the Ohio 
 purchases have been made. In view of this fact, the 
 Mark Lane Express says : 

"The buying of the best Short-Horned cattle for 
 America, together with the increased value and demand 
 for the best sorts of feeding cattle at home, have of late 
 •wonderfully increased the value of really superior ani- 
 mals, and this description are at present worth more 
 money than they have been at any former period, which 
 must have the effect of giving a direction and incentive 
 to breeders of this most interesting and valuable species 
 of cattle to breed from nothing but the very best on 
 either side. These shipments of the best cattle are more 
 likely to increase than diminish, at least for some years 
 to come ; and it is not improbable that the result will be 
 that, in the long run, breeders in the parent country will 
 find it necessary, and to their advantage, to select their 
 herd-bulls in the New World." — Ohio Farmer, Cleveland.

Milk Houses. 
 Mr. Editor : — In your May number there is a com- 
 munication from Mr. Bennett M. Temple, in answer to a 
 communication which appeared in the March number 
 from a "Subscriber," relative to a "Milk House." As I 
 am rather far from Mr. Temple to pay him a visit to re- 
 ceive any information upon the subject, perhaps he will 
 give a description of his in the columns of your Journal. 
 I did propose conveying the Avater into a milk house from 
 my well which is about twenty-five feet distant, I have 

just put into my well one of Warner's patent iron pumps 
 which appears so far to work very well ; it has impreg- 
 nated the water with the iron, which, although very 
 healthy, is decidedly disagreeable, but I am in hopes 
 that will wear oflF. Yours, respectfully, 

Bellevue, Md. WM. C. DIAMOND.

Oiketicus Pensylvanicus. — (Drop Worm.) 
 The insect which is the subject of the following re- 
 marks belongs to a family of sack-bearing Lepidojitera, 
 called Rcijchadce, which takes its name from Psyche, the 
 typical genius of the family, and, together with others 
 of approximating form and habits, constitutes the Lin- 
 nffian group Bomhyces, or spinners. 

There seems to be much difficulty in determing pre- 
 cisely the proper relations of this moth. In its meta- 
 morphosis and its habits it approaches the genus Psyche, 
 but the perfect insect is very dissimilar in appearance. 
 The genus Fumea is also similar in its habits, but Mr. 
 Guilding, the original discoverer of the genus, has con- 
 jectured that it might be more nearly allied to the genus 
 Zeuzera. Mr. Westwood considers it as the connecting 
 link between the ITepiallidw (wood-boring moth) and the 
 remaining Bombycidcc. 

Oiketicus,'^ the generic name given the insect by the 
 Rev. Lausdown Guilding, is from the Greek, and literal- 
 ly means a solitary inmate of one's own house, '^qici ha- 
 hilaculum queer ere solel." The trivial name Pensylvani- 
 cus-\ is one I propose myself, to distinguish it from other 
 species of the same genus that may be known now, or 

*Dr. Harris says that this name should be QHceticus, 
 in which, if I knew enough of Greek, I should certainly 
 coincide, for the dictionary interpretation of the former 
 term does not convey to me the idea of Mr. Guilding's 
 translation of it. 

•j-Very recently I saw an article from the pen of Dr. 
 Harris, in the October number of the Albany "Cultiva- 
 tor" for 1853, giving a brief notice of a species of Oi- 
 keticus, which may possibly be the same that I have been 
 describing, to which he has given the trivial name of 
 Coniferum, from the circumstance of its being found on, 
 and being partial to, conebearing trees. Of course I am 
 unable to confirm this, for in all my experience I never 
 found but a single specimen on such a tree, (and that 
 was a diminutive follicle that had been vacated,) and my 
 first notice of the insect was in September, 1849 or '50, 
 near this city ; but I have an indistinct recollection of 
 having read something .about certain pendant follicles 
 upon trees containing insects, in the vicinity of Phila- 
 delphia, at least ten years ago.
