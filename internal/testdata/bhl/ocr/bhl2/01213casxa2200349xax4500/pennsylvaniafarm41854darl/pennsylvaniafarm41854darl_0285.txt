that may be discovered hereafter ; and also because it 
 appears to have been common in Pennsylvania for many 
 years. 

My observations include a period of nearly five years, 
 ■which in the beginning was attended with difficulties and 
 disappointments, eliciting only very partial results ; nor 
 am I assured that even noio I shall have discovered any 
 thing new to the experienced naturalist ; but after hav- 
 ing noted the developments, habits and transformations 
 of nearly one hundred subject specimens, I may be en- 
 abled to interest the general reader, add a moiety to his 
 stock of knowledge, and instruct him as to the cause of, 
 and the means to evade, the ravages of a very destruc- 
 tive insect. 

When the young "Drop Worm" is first excluded from 
 the egg (the earliest period of which I observed was the 
 24th, 25th and 2Gth of May), it is about one-sixteenth 
 of an inch in length (Fig. L.); the head and three ante- 
 rior segments, and also the pectoral or proper legs, are 
 of a dark, glossy chesniit-bi-own or nearly black color, 
 tlie remaining portion of the body is a little lighter, or 
 rather a tawney. They descend by a fine silken cable, 
 in rapid but regular successive order, from the lower 
 end of the suspended follicle of the previous season and 
 light upon the branches and foliage immediately beneath, 
 unless they should be blown to otie side or the other by 
 the wind ; and are very active, using only the front or 
 pectoi'al legs in locomoting and carrying the abdominal 
 portion of the body erect. Immediately, or in a very 
 brief period, after exclusion, they commence forming a 
 cylindrical covering for the body out of silken tissue, 
 coating it externally with small particles of whatever 
 substance they may come in contact. These coverings 
 in a day or two assume a truncated cone shape, are car- 
 ried erect, having both ends open (through the upper 
 one of which tJie excrement is ejected), and may be 
 found distributed along the smaller branches, or upon 
 the \ipper surface of the leaves of trees ; at which 
 time they appear like minute deadened leaf-buds natu- 
 rally belonging to the tree, but on a closer examination 
 it will be found they have gnawed away a small portion 
 of their epidermis, which has been added as an outer 
 covering to their habitations, perfectly disguising them, 
 but at the same time leaving a trait of the inner bark 
 exposed to view. Those that are not so much given to 
 the spirit of migi-ation, but commence operations upon 
 the leaves where they first drop ; their habitations being 
 of the same color as the leaf, they appear not much un- 
 like galls or warts, and were it not that the leaves soon 
 begin to present a punctured aspect their presence might 
 not be noticed. They are the most restless and perse- 
 vering little animals that have ever come under my ob- 
 sei-vation, for as soon as they see the light of day their 
 instinctive mandate seems to be "scatter and destroy"; 
 and being singularly endowed with the faculty of adapt- 
 ing themselves to surrounding circumstances, they are 
 able to endure much and live on little. As an instance, 
 I may remark that some that hatched in my cabinet de- 
 scended to the floor and formed coverings out of bits of 
 straw and matting, some gnawed oflF bits of a blue 
 painted shelf and thus decorated their habitations, whilst 
 others appropriated for the same purpo.'ie small particles 
 of lime flora a whitewashed wall. In a month after, or 
 18 

about the 20th of June, their presence and their destruc- 
 tive qualities are quite apparent ; and a month later the 
 havoc to foliage is truly menacing, of which they are the 
 concealed cause. It is about the former period just 
 named that their habitations begin to assume a pendant 
 position and spindle shape. 

The Jarvce of the "Drop Worm," or Oikeiicus, when 
 matured is about an inch in length (Fig. A.), robust in 
 front, and slightly tapering towards the anal extremity; 
 composed of head .and twelve segments, and in color 
 very much the same as when first excluded from the egg, 
 perhaps a shade paler beneath than formerly. The first 
 three segments, together with their legs and head, are 
 hard, glossy and mottled with bluish white. The pec- 
 toral legs are each armed with a single claw, and the 
 pro-legs, of which there are ten, like many other Lepi- 
 dopterous larvte, are provided with a cornet of small 
 hooks. The head is armed with short robust mandibles, 
 maxilla and palpi, brownish at base, terminated with 
 glossy black; the lahrum and the antennce are mahogany 
 colored, retractile, the latter terminated by a single seta 
 or hair ; five ocelli, or eyelets, on each side of the head 
 near the base of the antennce, arranged three above and 
 two below. A few sparse hairs are distributed over the 
 whole body, but mainly issuing from the trachea, or 
 breathing spiracles, and the anterior and posterior seg- 
 ments. The adult larv£e are by no means remarkable for 
 their activity when divested of their external covering, 
 on the conti-ary they seem literally like a "fish out of 
 water;" in that respect having retrograded materially 
 since the period of infancy. The adult larvte of the fe- 
 male is usually much larger than that of the male, being 
 also of a deeper color, and having a ring of brown be- 
 tween each of the three anterior segments. 

From the first until the end of August, these larvte 
 are engaged in securing their sack-like habitations, pre- 
 paratory to undergoing their medial and final transfor- 
 mations ; and here they seem to be gifted in an extraor- 
 dinary degree with the instinct of self-preservation and 
 perpetuation. The female, in whose habitaculum is stored 
 the seeds of the subsequent generations, is careful to 
 fasten it securely to a small healthy and living branch, 
 where it may bear the rigorous exposure of the "wind 
 and weather" of a winter season without injury; and 
 when divested of the rough superficial exterior, which 
 was composed of pieces of shrivelled leaves and leaf- 
 stems, it assumes the shape of two cones united by their 
 bases, or rather a spindle shape, tapering towards the 
 ends, one of which is united by a narrow neck to the 
 branch above. On the other hand, the male is altogeth- 
 er indiscriminate as to a proper situation to move his 
 castle, and as often attaches it to a leaf-stem as any oth- 
 er place: for, as he issues forth from it before the leaves 
 fall in autumn, and as he shall never need it again, it is 
 of no consequence what becomes of it afterwards. 
 Therefore, many of those that remain dangling upon the 
 branches of trees during the winter and spring, espe- 
 cially the larger ones, are those of the females. 

After having observed the necessary precaution in se- 
 curing properly their habitations, the upper ends being 
 now effectually closed; in about thirty-six hours thereaf- 
 ter the larvre is transformed into a dark brown chrysalis, 
 (Fig. C. & G.) ; the male about five-eights of an inch in
