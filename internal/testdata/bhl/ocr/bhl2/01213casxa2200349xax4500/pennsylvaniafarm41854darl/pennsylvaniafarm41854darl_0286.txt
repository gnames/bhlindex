length, and the female from one to one and a quarter 
 inches. In the pupa of the male, the wings, legs and 
 dntennaj of the future insect arc visible ; the anal seg- 
 ment is terminated by two hooked spines, and upon each 
 of the abdominal segments are transverse rows of dorsal 
 spines and hairs leaning backward and forward. By the 
 aid of these spines, the male pupa is enabled to thrust 
 itself more than half its length from the lower opening 
 of its habitation, in order to effect its final transforma- 
 tion (Fig. F.). There is not least resemblance between 
 the male and female pupa, except in color ; the latter 
 (Fig. G.) is much larger than the former, something 
 darKcr, .and appears to be merely a series of transverse- 
 ly united rings or segments, gradually tapering towards 
 â‚¬ach end, exhibiting no outline of wings or other organs, 
 and were it not for the presence of a slight thoracic, 
 dorsal ridge, the question as to which was the anterior 
 or posterior extremity might be involved in serious doubt. 
 At or near the period of final transformation, the head 
 of the pupa is turned towards the lower end of the ha- 
 bitation which is open. 

In about four weeks after, and at different periods 
 from the beginning until the end of September, the final 
 transformation takes jjlace ; when the male insect comes 
 forth a sm.all mole-colored moth (Fig. F.) from a half to 
 three-quarters of an inch in length, and expanding from 
 seven-eights to one inch across the wings, thickly cover- 
 ed with rather long downy hair or fur, with an indis- 
 tinct band slightly tinged around the anterior transverse 
 margin of the thorax. The antcnncn are twenty-eight 
 articulate, deeply pectinated, or feathered, on both sides 
 near the base, which gi-adually diminishes towards the 
 middle, from whence to the apex, which is slightly curved 
 inward, there is only a kind of serration along the ante- 
 rior or upper margin. The tarsi are all pentamerous or 
 five jointed, the hinder or posterior pair dilated and shor- 
 tened, and, together with the terminal portion of the anten- 
 nas and caudal portion of the abdomen, are a very glossy, 
 reddish brown; the ungues or claws are black. The eyes 
 are prominent, complex and lusterless black ; the mouth, 
 and the usual characteristic appendages thereto belong- 
 ing, are merely rudimental or entii-ely obsolete. The 
 wings in a state of repose are deflexed, and do not cover 
 the whole length of the abdomen, which this insect has 
 the most extraordinary power of elongating and con- 
 tracting at pleasure ; the anterior wings are twice as 
 long as the posterior pair, and immediately after being 
 evolved from the chrysalis they are all covered with veiy 
 dark, nearly black, farina, or minute scales, which are 
 soon lost however, especially from the anterior pair, 
 from the restless and fitful character of the insect when 
 it takes to flight ; after which the wings become trans- 
 parent, leaving only a small portion of it near the base, 
 and a marginal band around the posterior pair, which 
 often reaches no farther forward than the anal angle. 
 At this period the male might easily be taken for an in- 
 sect belonging to the order Hymenoptera, unless closely 
 examined. From the organization of the mouth, or 
 rather from the want of it, it is apparent that the male 
 insect never partakes of food during its natural life in 
 the Imago state, which is very brief, from a few hours 
 to a day at the longest, unless some interruption to its 
 natural development and destiny takes place. 

The female (Fig. H.) differs so much from the male, 
 whom she is destined never to see, that it would require 
 no ordinary amount of credulity to believe there was any 
 analogy between them, unless convinced of it by perso- 
 nal observation. The perfectly developed female entire- 
 ly separated from, and disconnected with, the habitacu- 
 lum and pupa case, is not much unlike the larvre of some 
 Ili/mcnopterous or Dipterous species, and might readily 
 be mistaken for them. Unless the ordinary course of 
 the female is disturbed, she never leaves her habitation 
 until she is ready to die, and then with barely life and 
 strength sufficient to draw her attenuated body from it ; 
 and this she is not always able to accomplish, in which 
 her shi'unken carcase may be found filling the orifice of 
 egress to the no small detriment of the young brood who 
 expect to pass through a few months after. The female 
 imago corresponds in size to the female chrysalis or pupa, 
 and of a yellowish white color, without wings, antenna;, 
 or feet, minute wart-like concretions supplying the place 
 of the latter organs, head very small in proportion to 
 the size of the body, eyes minute and rudimental, ovi- 
 positor exserted and prominent, a ring of brownish floss 
 around the terminal abdominal segment, and a small 
 quantity of orange-colored floss along the ventral margin 
 of the antepenultimate segment. The anterior or tho- 
 racic segments are also covered with silken tissue or floss 
 of a similar color, which is all rubbed from the body of 
 the female in her passage from the pupa case, and with 
 which the eggs are protected ; after which the dorsal or 
 upper portion of the thorax presents a smooth glossy 
 surface of a yellowish brown color. The whole internal 
 cavity of the female is filled with ova, which ai-e visible 
 through the external integument, and after having ovi- 
 posited the space that she formerly occupied in the pupa 
 case is nearly filled with eggs ; these are smooth, light 
 yellow or nearly -white, nearly as large as white clover 
 seed, and securely packed and interlaced with the floss 
 above alluded to, numbering eight or nine hundred, and 
 even one thousand in some instances, showing the power 
 to increase in a fearful and remarkable degree. 

Amongst the many singular characteristics of this in- 
 sect, the most remarkable is the peculiar manner in 
 which the female is rendered fruitful, or the eggs im- 
 pregnated. Seeing that she never leaves the pupa case, 
 or the habitaculum, until she is about to die, or quite 
 dead, and that fecundation must take place before that 
 period, I was not a little puzzled how to solve the enig- 
 ma. But after long, patient and frequent observations 
 upon a number of larger .and smaller follicles that I 
 placed in a case covered with glass, I had the gratifica- 
 tion of seeing the males evolve ; and, in a restive, im- 
 patient manner, search about for something I could not 
 immediately divine, for I was looking for the females 
 also to come forth and pair with the males in the usual 
 way. I, however, was soon relieved from doubt at see- 
 ing the males betake themselves instinctively to a follicle 
 that contained a pupa of the female, and insert the 
 whole abdomen as far as the wings would permit into 
 the opening below, and there remain in a quiet state 
 from five to ten minutes, after which thej' would with- 
 draw themselves, and in from twenty to thirty minutes 
 thei-eafter die. On opening several ot the follicles after 
 the sexual union of the male and female, I found the fe-
