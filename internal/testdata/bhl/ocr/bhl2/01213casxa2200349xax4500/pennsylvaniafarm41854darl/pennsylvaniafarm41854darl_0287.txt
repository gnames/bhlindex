male with her head down towai-ds the orifice from which 
 the male had just withdrawn himself, having the thora- 
 cic ridge (alluded to above) cleft asunder, and also two 
 lateral clefts of about half the length of the former, but 
 all else was entire. Through these clefts the females 
 were forcing themselves, and had already commenced 
 the work of oviposition. I imagined there might have 
 been some mistake in all this, and therefore I attempted 
 to bring the sexes together in the usual way, but they 
 did not seem to be conscious of each other's presence ; 
 and a year after I found that the impregnation had been 
 complete : for, on hanging one of the female habitacu- 
 lums aforesaid on a quince tree, to make some observa- 
 tions on the young larva3, I very much jeopardized a 
 crop of quinces and otherwise disfigured the tree. Fe- 
 males that had no connection whatever with the males, 
 would come out witliout ovipositing, and, after moving 
 about with a maggot-like motion, would make an abor- 
 tive attempt to do so, and after surviving from two to 
 four days would die. 

Here then we have as singular and as wonderful an 
 instance of procreative economy as the most fabled or 
 mythological. A female subject of the animal kingdom 
 completely closed up in her solitary habitation, destined 
 never to behold her suitor for amatory favor, rendered 
 fruitful merely by a contact of spheres, or an oversha- 
 dowing with a seminal atmosphere by the male, which is 
 accomplished by tlie unerring leading of his instincts to 
 the habitation occupied by her, and there with the same 
 unfailing guidance accomplishing the end of his proba- 
 tion by "so simple and so chaste an embrace." 

Immediately after impregnation no aperture can be 
 discovered in the body of the female, except that through 
 which the eggs are deposited ; and as the pupa case is 
 found entire, except the cleft in the dorsal ridge on the 
 thorax, the contact or connection, whatever the nature 
 of it is, must be ultimated there. It is a matter of as- 
 tonishment that the male should be able to even reach 
 the head of the female, the neck of the habitaculuni hav- 
 ing considerable length, but this he is enabled to accom- 
 plish by the more astonishing facility with which he can 
 elongate his retractile abdomen : therefore, he has only 
 to pat her amatively and cozily on the back, and say, in 
 effect, "be fruitful and multiply," and it sufiices. 

'Tis a pity that animals having so chaste and classic a 
 germination should develope such stealthy and destruc- 
 tive characters in maturer age. I think with a little 
 protection, these insects might be produced in sufficient 
 numbers to destroy all the foliage in Eastern Pennsylva- 
 nia in ten years. 

At this present writing the insect, whose history I 
 have been attempting to commit to paper, is in the full 
 tide of its devastating career in many places. There is 
 no ostentation in its appearance and presence, all is done 
 under cover. Ensconced in a silken habiliment, covei'ed 
 over with slu'cds of leaves, stems and woody fibre, so 
 disguised as not to be perceived by its natural enemies, 
 it proceeds from bra nch to branch and leaf to leaf in its 
 silent but untiring work of indiscriminate destruc- 
 tion. 

"Drop AVorm," the common name that has been ob- 
 tained for these insects, seems to be very apposite; not 
 only because the adult larvic are in the habit of dropping 

down by a fine cord in changing their location from one 
 branch to another, but also because, even in their state 
 of pristine infancy, they thus drop out of the lower ori- 
 fice of the old habitaculum, and, in au easy, active, and 
 very knowing way, immediately commence their masti- 
 cating and building opei-ations, just as if they had re- 
 cently come out of a regular apprenticeship to the busi- 
 ness. 

I know of no mode of successfully destroying them 
 without injui-ing the trees they infest, save bj' hand as 
 recommended in a former communication. No depen- 
 dence can be placed upon the "feathered tribes," for 
 alas ! their visits are every year becoming fewer and 
 farther between. I am very doubtful, however, if birds 
 could succeed in dislodging them from their well protec- 
 ted castles, if they should be fortunate enough to discov- 
 er their presence: for, they have the singular tact of 
 collapsing the ends with remarkable quickness at the 
 least disturbance, nor can they be forced out of their 
 snug lodgings without in many cases being torn out 
 piece-meal. 

The "Drop Worm" was exceedingly numerous in and 
 about Lancaster city during the summer of 1851, and 
 either greatly disfigured or totally destroyed the foliage 
 of some of the most beautiful shade trees. Dui-ing the 
 summer of 1852 there were comparatively few to be seen 
 in this locality, which may, I think, be attributed in 
 some measure to the intensely cold and protracted win- 
 ter that immediately prececded. Many of them are also 
 destroyed in embryo from another cause which I discov- 
 ered. It sometimes happens that the female has not 
 sufficient strength left to extricate herself from the out- 
 let of her habitation; in which case her shrivelled body 
 remains effectually closing it up. On the following sea- 
 son after the young are excluded from the eggs, they 
 have not the power to penetrate the walls of the habita- 
 culum (which are perfectly water tight) and make their 
 escape from it, and thus many perish, as I elicited by 
 actual experiment. 

During the summer of 1853 they were here in in- 
 creased numbers, more indiscriminate in their attacks, 
 and of course greatly enlarging the field of their opera- 
 tions. They seem to adapt themselves to any tree they 
 are placed upon e-xcept the peach, at least it is so in re- 
 gard to the domesticated fruit and shade ti-ees, but are 
 usually found most abundant on the linden, silver maple 
 and Lombardy poplar. Many persons have availed 
 themselves of the caution thrown out in a former com- 
 munication, and notices of the press in general; not- 
 withstanding, I find some trees in my immediate vicinity 
 that are sufl'ering, in appearance at least, from them at 
 the present time. I have also discovered two species of 
 parasitic llymcnoptera that destroy the larvoe of Oikelicus, 
 or Drop Worm; as these may be regarded as insect friends, 
 I may write out their description and history when I have 
 extended my observations upon them farther. In con- 
 clusion I can only recommend a simultaneous manual 
 effort during the pruning operations of early spring, as 
 the most effectual means to accomplish the so much de- 
 sired extermination of these insects: for, as they do not 
 furnish food for birds or domestic fowls, I can discover 
 no possible use tliat they are ever likely to perform.
