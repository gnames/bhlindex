page 110, may be found a description of an allied spe- 
 cies from the South by Mr. Guilding, extracted from the 
 transactions of the "Linncoan Society" of the City of 
 London. From the illustrations accompanying the de- 
 scription, the species appears to be much larger than 
 ours, or at least than the species I have attempted to 
 describe, with the posterior wings more angular, and the 
 head larger and more projecting and distinct. The larvae 
 and the female also differ very materially, but their 
 transformations and habits, so far as described, seem to 
 be merely identical. We may also have different species 
 amongst those that inhabit our own country, but I have 
 not been able to discover more than one in this immedi- 
 ate locality, and I have examined no others.

 Mowing Machines. 

Dear Sir: — As you desire your friends shall give you 
 their experience in the use of such reaping or mowing 
 machines as they may h^v a practically tried this hai'vest, 
 I proceed to give mine : 

I purchased one of Ketchum's mowers for the harvest 
 of 1853, and have used it (or tried to) for two seasons. 
 I believe it to be one of the cleanest cutters among the 
 mowers, and to cut as low to the ground with facility, if 
 not lower, than any other. An improvement was made 
 upon it this year I am told, by which it can be driven 
 when running to the right or left; mine turns only to 
 the left. 

I consider that I have given Ketchum's mower a fair 
 trial for two season — nay, I have "picked the flint and 
 tried her again" so often that the neighboring blacksmith 
 can speak most favorably of my custom, and can say 
 something for my patience and perseverance likewise. I 
 will say that all due precautions were used while run- 
 ning the machine, as to oiling, &c., and as to keeping the 
 nuts screwed up tight, as far as this latter teas possible. 

In my experience this mower will ?iof cut heavy down 
 clover or other grass without repeatedly breaking. I 
 think I have been taught by this experience what its de- 
 fects are. The pitman bar connecting the knives to the 
 machine is too slight, and not sufficiently heavy and 
 stout. The motion of this bar or connecting rod is more 
 rapid upon this machine than upon any other I have 
 seen, and the quick, jerl-ing motion it imparts to the 
 knives is the reason, I pi-esume, that it is so clean a cut- 
 ter, and it may likewise be the reason why it breaks so 
 frequently. 

Another fault I find with it is, that the nuts confining 
 nearly all the important bolts are most difficult to get at, 
 in attempting to lighten them, after the machine is pre- 
 pared for running. These nuts are all under, instead of 
 on top, the plates, as I think they should be, and where 
 they could be much more readily reached. The nuts on 
 the end of the pitman bar, which confine the brass box, 
 are also very difficult to reach, and are consequently of- 
 ten working loose. To this may be added that most of 
 the iron works, such as cogs, bolts, keys, nuts, &c., 
 should be made of better iron. They are very defective 
 in this particular, and so I have reason to believe are 
 most of the modern machines. The truth is they are 
 made too much for sale. Two horses, or better two well 

broken mules (for they pull more evenly and steadily 
 than the horse), will carry Ketchum's mower in any field 
 with ease. 

In this county a great many of the different mowing 
 and reaping machines have been tried this har\-est, and 
 used with diversified results. Where the grass or grain 
 stood up well, and was not too heavy, and all proper 
 pi-ecautions taken to keep a sharp look-out for the nuts, 
 bolts, &c., they did their woi-k — and paid something to 
 the blacksmith besides. 

I will venture the opinion here, be it worth much or 
 little, that none of the combined mowers and reapers 
 now in use will answer to depend upon on farms of any 
 extent. I would not oppose the purchasing by a small 
 farmer of a good combined machine, if he find one. 
 Their economy, if they stand, is manifest. But upon 
 larger farms the less complication the better, and the 
 less running to the blacksmith will there be. Let each 
 machine do its own work if it ivill, and be thankful if it 
 does. The best of these machines yet invented will, in 
 my opinion, (I except Hussey's old reaper, which for 
 durability is most excellent and for draught most exe- 
 crable,) break down before you want them to. 

We want, and will yet have, Mr. Editor, more relia- 
 ble machines. Yours, &c., B.

Advantages from Liming. 

Mr. Editor : — In August and September, 1842, 1 
 commenced liming a piece of new ground on t'ne "Mun- 
 cy Hills" for the second crop of wheat, instead of rye 
 for the second crop, which is the practice on that kind 
 of land generally, but only got three-fourths of the 
 field limed (about twelve acres). I put it on in half 
 bushel heaps, spread as soon as slacked, fifty bushels to 
 the acre. The advantage was so great that the wheat 
 looked as if the ground had been manured and the rest 
 of the field not. On the twelve acres thus limed the clo- 
 ver took and grew finely, on the rest of the field the 
 clover was small and but little of it. In 1844 there was 
 a drought; the clover that had been limed stood it well, 
 while the clover in the rest of the field was literally 
 burned up. It showed here, as it does every where else, 
 that there is no use in putting up stakes to tell where 
 you limed or manured a part of a field. 

After putting on over 1500 bushels of lime on that 
 kind of land in various ways, I concluded that thirty 
 bushels was enough, and did as much good as where we 
 put on fifty or sixty on our bottom lands along Muncy 
 creek and the West Branch. I have raised the "big 
 clover" four feet long on that hill land after it was limed 
 with thirty bushels to the acre. 

The bottom lands are generally alluvial, and hence 
 more vegetable matter, which accounts for its requiring 
 more lime. I have put on the bottom lands along the 
 creek 100 bushels to the acre with less perce2jtible bene- 
 fit than 30 on the hills. Nature provides all things 
 right; the uplands belong generally to people hardly 
 able to make a living, and if ihe land required as much 
 lime as the creek and river farms, they would be a long 
 time in getting them limed; as it is, they are more 
 equal.
