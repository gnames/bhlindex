digested ; this is the reason why the rich and epicures 
 prefer them, because they can eat a larger quantity 
 ■without overloading their digestive faculties. 

Vegetable Food. — The quantity of actual nutriment 
 in the following grains ranks them as follows : Indian 
 corn, wheat, barley, rye, (potatoes, ) buckwheat and oats. 
 Rice in a i-ice country is the cheapest article of diet, but 
 not here in Pennsylvania. Among the roots, such as 
 beets, parsnips, &c., the sweeter the root the more nutri- 
 ment it contains.

Long continued gentle heat, whether in roasting, boil- 
 ing or simmering, renders meat more tender, juicy and 
 digestible. Stewing is the most frugal, most wholesome, 
 and may be made the most palatable. 

Method of Cultivating a Swamp. — Divide it into 
 lots about three rods wide by ditches, the middle of the 
 lands to be the highest ; plow it in the fall and haul on 
 to it gravel or upland soil ; in the spring stir it and 
 plant potatoes ; the next year ha,ul on more top soil, give 

a coat of dung, sow grain, and lay it down to grass,

Wheat and Cheat. 

Mr. Editor : — Since the article of Mr. Henry Miller, 
 in the Farm Journal for June, relative to wheat turning 
 into cheat, has not been replied to, I beg leave to offer a 
 few remarks in order to bring the "matter to a correct 
 conclusion." 

The ten acre wheat field in Pickaway countj', Ohio, 
 will readily be explained by the fact that the wheat was 
 ripe enough to shell a quantity sufficient for another 
 crop, which, in consequence of moist weather, was pro- 
 duced, and again left to ripen for experiment's sake to a 
 degree to shell for a third crop, "when lo ! the entire 
 field was turned to cheat." In the first instance of the 
 wheat shelling, the cheat also shelled ; for when wheat 
 is ripe enough to shell by the harvest operation, suffici- 
 ent to cover the ground for another crop, the cheat will 
 be found to shell all during that operation, and as most 
 all wheat has some cheat accompanying it, in the second 
 shelling (if the wheat had as much cheat as I have seen 
 in excellent wlieat fields, ) the quantity must have been 
 more than sufficient to become master of the field, if the 
 term is admissible, and the weather may have been dry, 
 the cheat, being more hardy than the wheat, survived, 
 while the wheat dried up, hence "the entire field was 
 turned to cheat." As to the "freaks of nature" con- 
 tended for in the case in question, I know of no "prin- 
 ciple of philosophy" that proves more conclusively the 
 plain and acknowledged laws of nature, instead of the 
 freaks, than the ten acre field in Pickaway county, Ohio. 
 The two plants are so entirely different in root, stem, 
 leaf and seed, that it needs no more than an impartial 
 comparison to show that they are totally dissimilar in 
 every respect, and that it would be as reasonable for an 
 apple tree to turn to a chesnut, as wheat to undergo the 
 transmutation in question. The malformations of a 

child with a horse's head, or a calf with two heads, 
 which Mr. M. produces as an argument to prove the 
 transmutation of wheat to cheat, falls to he ground, 
 when the child in fact cannot be called a horse, but is 
 still a child, nor the calf a sheep, so that neither of 
 these malformations can be called a transmutation, 
 "The disturbing cause," why "the husbandman gathers 
 tares instead of wheat," is that the seed of the tai-es are 
 carried into his field by some means or other.

The Points of the Spanish Fowl. 

A writer in the Poultry Chronicle thus describes the 
 "points" in the Spanish fowls: 

"The cocks should have upright, the hens falling, 
 combs ; but there is a peculiarity in this point, the birds 
 reversing the cai-riage of combs, with perfectly white 
 faces, would be judged more meritorious than others, 
 faultless in this particular, but having red intermixed 
 with white. It cannot be too strongly impressed on 
 Spanish breeders and amateurs, that the purely white 
 face is the most arbitrary rule in judging fowls in this 
 breed, and will cover many trifling deficiencies. Of 
 course the plumage should be black, without mixture of 
 any other color. The body should incline to a point, ev- 
 ery way, to the tail, which should be ample, and can-ied 
 cheerfully. The head should be long, and the face skin- 
 ny; the beak strong, the legs long, compared with 
 many other breeds, and, invariably, of a leaden blue 
 shade. 

"Although cocks at seven months, and pullets at ten, 
 ought to give promise of what they will be when they 
 come to maturity, yet I would not advise the beginner to 
 be precipitate in forming a judgement, and condemning 
 those that are not apparently perfect, as manj% and more 
 especially pullets, are from eighteen months to two years 
 in becoming really white, and it is undeniable that a 
 Spanish hen improves up to three years old." 

Points of the White Dorking Fowl. 

Another correspondent in the work above referred to 
 gives the following as the points of the White Dorking 
 fowl of the most approved standard : 

"First, the color : This should be a pure white, with- 
 out any shade of yellow, or any other colored feather of 
 tiuj description about the body. AVhen the attention of 
 the novice is directed to this single feature, he will be 
 astonished to find how few specimens (especially of the 
 cocks) will pass in this respect ; but still it is essential : 
 for as beauty is the only point in which the White Dork- 
 ing is superior to the Grey or Speckled, so much more is 
 it necessary that the feature which gives them this pre- 
 eminence should be distinct and perfect. 

"Second, the comb: Both single and double combed 
 birds may be pure bred, but it is now, I think, almost 
 decided that this beautiful appendage should be double ; 
 indeed, any person of taste, who has no knowledge what- 
 ever of poultry, would immediately pronounce for the 
 double, as being more graceful, and more in harmony 
 with the general appearance of the bird ; in the cock it 
 should be very broad at its base near the beak, gradual- 
 ly passing over the back of the head in the form of a 
 triangle, the point of which should be slightly curved
