upwards ; the whole of the surface should be evenly ser- 
 rated, and not ragged and unequal ; the color should be 
 a bright red, indicating a healthy state and good condi- 
 tion ; the same remarks will apply to the hen, only tliat 
 the comb will bo much smaller. 

"Third, the form : The back should be broad, and 
 from the point of the beak to the root of the tail should 
 be almo?t straight; the breast should be broad, full, and 
 gracefully rounded — wherever a large bird is found with 
 a concave back, a straight instead of a full breast, legs 
 large and not white, and a short instead of a flowing 
 tail, 3'ou may strongly suspect a trace of the Cochin 
 ^ood ; the legs should be white, a proportionate length, 
 and a fair distance apart to allow of a good broad breast; 
 each foot should have five claws, the fifth being as dis- 
 tinct as any of the rest. Viewing the bird as a whole, 
 tlie attitude should be erect and bold, lively in its mo- 
 tion; and appearing full of spirit tit all times. 

"Fourth, the qualities: In breeding Dorkings, one 
 thing is essenti.al to success — I here refer to a dry soil ; 
 if this is present, and they receive an ordinary amount 
 of care, they will be found a prolific bird, very fast 
 growers, and easy to rear; my broods, this year, vary- 
 ing from ten to fourteen chickens in each, and up to the 
 present time we have only lost one, .and that a weakly 
 one, the day after it was hatched. All our broods to a 
 bird arc in strong aud healthy condition ; they are small 
 eaters, good laj'crs, and though not laying to the same 
 extent as the Cochins, their eggs are finer and more de- 
 licate ; as mothers they are excellent, taking great care 
 of the young chickens, and not forsaking them at so 
 early an age as the Cochins. Their superiority for the 
 table is so well known, that it will be unnecessary to en- 
 large on that point." 

Canker Worms. 

We clip the following extracts, relative to preventing 
 the ravages of these pests, from a letter written by 
 Thaddeus William Harris to the New Engl.ind Farmer : 

"Fourteen or fifteen years ago, when canker worms 
 were very plentiful and destructive in this vicinity, the 
 use of tin collars, applied around the trunks of the 
 ti'ees, in the form of inverted funnels, was recommended 
 to prevent the ascent of the female insects. In the au- 
 tumn of 1852, they were employed in this place by sev- 
 eral persons, who have reported favorably concerning 
 them. The feet of the female insects are not provided 
 with suckers or clasperS like those of flies; and their 
 structure seems to be such as would necessarily prevent 
 their walking or retaining their foothold against gravity, 
 beneath a perfectly smooth, polished and dry surface. 
 Hence, when Mr. Everett first showed me his glass col- 
 lars, I was very favorably impressed with the contri- 
 vance, and accepted his offer to apply them to some of 
 my trees, in order to test their eCBcacj'. Two of my 
 cherrj' trees and two small plum trees were provided 
 with glass collars in the autumn of 1853 ; and these four 
 trees have almost entirely escaped injury, while some 
 other trees in my garden, not protected with collars or 
 with tar, have been more or less seriously injured by 
 canker worms. I do not consider this experiment as 
 conclusive, because there have been some canker worms 
 on the protected trees ; those on the cherry trees may 

have come from two infested elm trees, growing near the 
 fence in a neighboring lot, and so close as to interfere 
 with some of the branches of my two cherry trees ; the 
 plum trees, on the contrary, were sufficiently distant 
 from infested trees. Moreover, a friend tells me that he 
 saw a female insect pass over the glass collar on one of 
 his trees last autumn. The glass in all cases may not be 
 sufficiently smooth ; or perhaps moisture on the foot of 
 the female or on the glass may enable the insect to stick 
 to the glass. Further experiments in the use of this 
 contrivance seem, therefore, to be wanting before an un- 
 conditional verdict can be given in its favor. It is my 
 intention to apply these glass collars to other trees in 
 my garden next autumn ; in the expectation that, if ef- 
 fectual as a preventive to the ascent of the female in- 
 sect, they will prove in the course of time cheaper and 
 better than any other remedy hitherto employed. 

"Applications of tar, or of oil, aecording to the well 
 known methods, if made in season, and renewed as often 
 as necessary, have proved good remedies against the de- 
 predations of canker worms. My own confidence in 
 them not only remains unimpaired, but is confirmed by 
 continued experience. Tlie use of these remedies is at- 
 tended with much trouble and considerable expense, 
 against which are to be taken into account the satisfac- 
 tton and profit arising from the preservation of the fo- 
 liage, the fruit, aud even the continued health of the 
 trees. 

"In the enumeration of remedies we are not to forget 
 the services of the feathered race. The warblers, bunt- 
 ings and other small birds devour great numbers of can- 
 ker worms. Even the cherry bird earns a sliare of ovs: 
 early cherries by the havoc he makes among the canker 
 worms. I wish as much could be said in favor of the 
 robins, but candor obliges me to confess that insects form 
 but a very small portion of their food, while they arc 
 unsparing in their attacks upon our chei-ries. Domestic 
 fowls, if allowed to go at large among the trees during 
 the seasons when the female insects are rising from the 
 ground, devour gi'cat numbers of them. During the 
 present summer, some cherry trees growing in a yard 
 where fowls are kept have entirely escaped the attacks 
 of canker worms ; while trees in an adjacent yard from 
 which the fowls were excluded have had their leaves 
 wholly destroyed by the insects." 

Pumpkins for Milch Cows. 

Many of our Chester county dairymen are in the habit 
 of raising pumpkins for fall feeding to their milch cows, 
 which they find are eaten with a great relish, and help 
 very much to keep them to their milk, both before and 
 after the season of pasturing is over. It is important 
 that cows, which are generally allowed to go dry all 
 winter, should be made to milk on as late as possible in 
 tlic fall, and by the aid of pumpkins stored away for the 
 purpose, we have known them to milk well until the fii-st 
 of January, and at least two months longer than they 
 otherwise would do. 

Moderate feeding with them should be commenced 
 early in October, even while pasture is plenty. The va- 
 riety or change in food, vrhich for man is desirable to 
 promote appetite and relish, is generally unthouglit of or 
 neglected when applied to stock, but wc think is of some
