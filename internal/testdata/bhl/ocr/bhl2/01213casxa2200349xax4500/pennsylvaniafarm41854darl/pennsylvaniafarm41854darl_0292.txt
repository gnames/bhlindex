importance. Every farmer has observed how eagerly 
 cattle -will embrace the chance of a fresh field of clover, 
 •when turned into it even from an abundance of more 
 nutritious and valuable natural grasses, and we think an 
 occasional feeding of some corn fodder, pumpkins, cab- 
 bages. &c., even when pasture is plenty, increases the 
 appetite and promotes liealth and thrift. 

A very large quantity of pumpkins can be grown 
 among the corn with but trifling expense, and we would 

recommend farmers to experiment the present full with 
 feeding them to their cows, so that if they prove as val- 
 uable as we have found thera, a larger quantity may be 
 raised for this purpose another season. On some farms 
 in Chester county where lime has been extensively used, 
 it has been found very difficult to raise a crop of pump- 
 kins, the cause of which has been attributed to the lime. 
 Have any of our readers experience on this point ? If 
 so we should like to hear from thetn,.

Pecan Nut. 
 Mr. Barlikgton :— On reading the article on the cul- 
 tivation of the Pecan tree, over the well known signa- 
 ture of W. D., in the Farm Journal, it occurred to mc 
 that I had seen a sapling of the same kind of a tree 
 growing on the farm of W. R. Parker, in New Castle 
 county, near Middletown, Delaware. The nut being a 
 great favorite with mc, at Rrst leisure I went to see the 
 sapling, and was surprised to find that it had grown to 
 be a tree, which I found from measurement to be five 
 feet one inch in circumference at four feet above the sur- 
 face of the ground, carrying its thickness well up, and 
 making a tree that Mr. Parker and myself judged of 

sufficient size to produce fully three-quarters of a cord 
 of wood. The nut from which this tree grew waa 
 brought from Illinois in the year 1819 by Hon. A. New- 
 ton, formerly a United States Senator from Delaware. 
 Mr. Parker saved a good sized dairy s.alt sack full of the 
 well matured nuts. I first saw them on the high landa 
 of Missouri and Illinois. I have also seen them in high 
 perfection at a place called "Pecan Grove," on the low 
 lands on the margin of the Mississippi river below Nevf 
 Orleans, near the celebrated battle gi'ound. The nuts 
 are excellent and the tree of quick growth, as you may 
 perceive from the above statement. Respectfully, 
 New Castle county, Del. J. JONES.
