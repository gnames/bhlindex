less than with other kinds of stock, prices are not merely 
 speculative, but represent and indicate a real value and 
 superior qualities. Every year predictions have been 
 made that stock must come down, but they, have contin- 
 ued to go up, and the present j^ear shows a larger 
 amount of money invested in improved and imported 
 cattle and sheep than any one previous season. 

Chinese Wistaria. 
 The Chinese Wistaria, if trained to a pole eight or ten 
 feet high, and kept well cut back for some years, will in 
 process of time have all the beauty and appearance of a 
 weeping tree, and, what is even more valuable, bloom in 
 succession all summer. So says the Michigan Farmer. 
 Have any of our readers proved this last to be correct ? 

A Word to Correspondents. 
 Many of our correspondents seem not to be aware of 
 the fact that it is necessary for us to have all the type 
 set and pages imposed, ready to send to the foundry for 
 stereotyping, by the 20th day of the month preceeding 
 the intended issue. Communications sent to us after 
 that time must of necessity lay over until the succeeding 
 number, which not unfrequently throws them so much 
 out of season that their usefulness is almost wholly de- 
 stroyed. Will our correspondents, therefore, do us the 
 favor to send in their communications early each 
 month ? 

Veterinary Homoeopathy. 

We have lately had placed in our hands a small vol- 
 ume, published in Philadelphia, with the above title, 
 containing homoeopathic remedies, with the diseases and 
 symptoms for all kinds of farm stock, horses, cows, 
 sheep, hogs, &c. We never had much confidence in ho- 
 moeopathy for the human subject, and still less when 
 applied to animals, but are nevertheless open to the pre- 
 sentation of any facts bearing on the subject. In this 
 progressive age it will hardly do to condemn any thing 
 on first impressions, however ridiculous and absurd it 
 may appear. The remedies for all the known diseases 
 of animals noted in the book, and which are very mi- 
 nutely described, have been it is said applied most suc- 
 cessfully in a large number of cases. We are told by 
 some of our friends of cases they have seen cured, or 
 relieved, by this system in almost an incredibly short 
 time. One of the ti-avelling menageries, owning some 
 very valuable and well trained horses, it is said has a 
 homoeopathic physician employed to accompany it on a 
 regular salary. As the work is but of trifling cost, and 
 the remedies also very cheap, it may be an advantage 
 for those owning valuable stock to obtain a copy, and 
 give the system a trial. We always thouglit homoeopa- 
 thy had one merit at least, of doing no harm if it did no 
 good, unless harm should result indirectly fi-om delay. 
 \ correspondent of the Wool Grower, who appears to 
 have had some experience in it, writes as follows. What 
 he calls the "■rationaV treatment is to be understood as 
 meaning the homoeopathic. This is yet the disputed 
 point: 

"The rational treatment of Domestic Animals is gain- 
 ing ground daily, and fast superseding the old and bar- 
 barous system. I have tried it to some extent, and find 

it acts more promptly on animals than on persons, for 
 the simple reason that their food is not so artificial, and 
 besides they have no imagination to draw upon. I have 
 treated successfully various cases of acute colic in horses, 
 "hollow horn" in cows, catarrh or influenza in hoi'ses, 
 even when it was supposed to be glanders ; also the va- 
 rious stages of distemper, and other ailments too nume- 
 rous to mention. All roweling, bleeding, drenching, and 
 kindred heroic remedies can be dispensed with. 

"Though not a "graduate" nor a "practitioner," I 
 have no small medical knowledge — and great desire to 
 lessen the suffering of both man and beast ; hence I 
 trouble you in this way, and would bespeak for this 
 beautiful system your candid consideration. 1 have re- 
 ceived a medical education at tlie Homoeo. Med. College 
 in Philadelphia, but attended more as an amateur than 
 with a view of going into, and becoming a general prac- 
 titioner, — for the reason that I had too much other busi- 
 ness on my hands, and was too old a man to undergo the 
 fatigue of a country practice. 1 feel well satisfied that 
 the general introduction of this system among farmers, 
 will be the means of saving the lives of much valuable 
 stock, and eradicate many hereditary taints to which 
 they are heir." 

Cooked Food for Stock. 

The following from one of our foreign exchanges con- 
 firms the advice we have long been urging in the Farm 
 Journal, of the gi-eat advantages of cooked over uncook- 
 ed food. This is one of the improvements in farm man- 
 agement, which is sure to make its way, and where the- 
 ory and practice go hand in hand. We contend that 
 there is the same reason to cook food for stock as for 
 people, viz : to develope the nutritious matter and to make 
 it easier digested. That animals will thrive and grow fat 
 on uncooked food only shows that their power of consti- 
 tution and digestion is stronger than in men, and not 
 that they would not thrive faster and get fat sooner on 
 food which has its whole nutritive matter brought out by 
 steaming or boiling. We have never yet seen a complete 
 ai'rangement for steaming food for stock attached as it 
 ought to be to the bai-n, convenient to stalls and feeding 
 troughs, but we think something of the kind is greatly 
 wanted, and we should be pleased if any of our readers, 
 who know of any plan for a boiler to accomplish this, 
 and also avoid all danger from fire, would send a de- 
 scription for the Farm Journal. The steam distributing 
 pipes should be arranged convenient to the place of de- 
 posit for hay, corn fodder and other bulky articles, to 
 avoid the loss of time and labor in much carrying. The 
 boiler should also be readily supplied with water, and 
 be so constructed as to economise fuel and heat up quick- 
 ly. These are desiderations more readily obtained in a 
 plan for new buildings than adapted to some of our 
 present old fashioned barns, where they cannot conve- 
 niently be arranged. Mott's patent portable boiler is 
 the best we know of. Having a double casing to prevent 
 any loss of heat or waste of fuel, it will kindle up very 
 quickly with a few light pieces of wood, and when placed 
 near the pig pen will be found a very valuable aid in 
 fattening hogs. In the fall of the year there is a very 
 large quantity of refuse vegetables, which generally go 
 entirely to loss, such as small potatoes, beet^, cabbages,
