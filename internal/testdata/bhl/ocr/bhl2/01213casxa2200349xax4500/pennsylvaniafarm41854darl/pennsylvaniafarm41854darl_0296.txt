soft corn, pumpkins, &c., not worth storing away nor 
 saleable, but by boiling or steaming would supply the 
 place of a large amount of sound corn, and be equally 
 valuable in the fattening process. 

We have known corn fed to hogs in such quantities in 
 the fall of the year, much of it passing through them in 
 an undigested state, that we are satisfied money would 
 have been made by the farmer if he had bought hi? pork 
 instead of feeding it. 

Mott's boilers arc of sizes from 15 to 120 gallons. 
 The boiling and steaming of food for stock, in connec- 
 tion with cutters for cutting hay, straw and corn fodder, 
 we have entire confidence will make their way into gen- 
 eral use among farmers. We have never known them 
 fairly tried with any but good results. The article is as 
 follows : 

"Four heifers were selected, as equal in all respects as 
 possible, and six pigs were also selected, from the same 
 family ; each lot was divided by the selection, alternate- 
 ly, of an animal. All were weighed, and at the end of 
 each week during the experiment each animal was 
 weighed. 

"In the first week of the experiment the fermented 
 food consumed was much less than the other, and the 
 increase of the pigs in live weight is considerable more ; 
 and the heifers also seemed to have made rapid advances. 
 The second week, however, changed the scene entirely. 
 Those on cooked food were making steady progress, 
 "while those on fermented food had produced scarcely an 
 increase from the preceeding week. It was then ob- 
 served that the bowels of the lot using fermented food 
 had been confined, and had become free in the second. 
 The apparent success in the first week was the result of 
 indigestion and accumulation of undigested matter in the 
 intestines. 

"The experiment continued for twelve weeks — those 
 on cooked food thriving and increasing, the others not. 
 On slaughtering them, it was found that the intestines 
 of the three fed on fermented food were full of worms — 
 thus accounting for their not advancing. There was a 
 difference in the return of the lots of pigs in favor of 
 those fed on cooked food of £1 7s. 3d. This experiment 
 suggests the importance of great care and caution in 
 feeding, before a decided opinion is adopted in so nice 
 and delicate a subject as the nutrition of animals, the 
 health and constitution of which is so various." 

Adulteration of Manures. 

Judging from an article in a late number of the Eng- 
 lish Gardeners' Chronicle, as well as other advices, it 
 appears the English farmers are having their own trou- 
 bles with the manufacturers and vendors of superphos- 
 phates and other fertilizers. All the honesty at least 
 does not appear to be centered on the other side of the 
 water. The editor of the Chronicle says, "there was a 
 time when cheating a Scotchman was about as difficult 
 as cheating a Greek," but that they have sadly degene- 
 rated in this particular. In the transactions of the 
 Highland Society, a Mr. G. William Hay, a distinguished 
 agriculturist, gives a kind of autobiography of how he 
 was victimized, which, for the benefit of our readers, we 
 copy. A word to the wise is sufficient. 

It appears that being desirous of trying experiments 

with various manures in the cultivation of turnips, he 
 put himself in communication with a dealer in agricul- 
 tural manures. Among the substances he wished to em- 
 ploy were superphosphate of lime, nitrate of soda, phos- 
 phate of soda, sulphate of potash, sulphate of ammonia, 
 nitrate of potash, phosphate of magnesia, sulphate of 
 magnesia and muriate of ammonia. When the parcels 
 came to be chemically examined, the nitrate of soda was 
 found to contain only 56 pounds of that substance in 
 every 100 pounds ; the phosphate of soda just 6 pounds 
 in the 100 pounds ; the sulphate of potash GO pounds ; 
 the sulphate of ammonia not quite 9J pounds ; the ni- 
 trate of potash about 11} pounds; the phosphate of 
 magnesia 2| pounds, and the muriate of ammonia 54 
 pounds only. The superphosphate of lime (so called) 
 only contained 4 per cent, of soluble phosphate of lime, 
 the other 96 pounds consisted of water, gypsum, silice- 
 ous matter, some kind of free acid, and insoluble phos- 
 phate of lime, a perfectly useless substance. On com- 
 plaint being made, the only satisftaction he got was that 
 they could not think of taking the rubbish back, as it 
 was the usual qxiantity for agricultural purposes. 

Mr. Hay also informs the public that in Scotland ani- 
 mal charcoal is not what it ought to be, and that London 
 night soil consists of the scrapings of the streets, with a 
 little limestone and soil, and that gypsum contains 40 
 per cent, of sulphate of baryta.

Management of Manure Heaps. 

One of our foreign exchanges, has a communication 
 from Mr. Robert Austin, Manchester, who says that up- 
 wards of a ton of horse dung is produced in his stables 
 daily, and the usual offensive odor and evaporation from 
 it entirely prevented by sprinkling over the dung heap, 
 by means of an ordinary water can, a solution of a pound 
 of common green copperas in a gallon of water. 

"The value of tliis chemical agent in fixing ammonia 
 and strengthening manure, has long been known, but 
 Mr. Austin's practical application may be considered sim- 
 ple, effective and easily adopted in similar cases." 

Tax on Breeding Stock— Book Farming— Crops in Mer- 
 cer County. 

Mr. Editor : — I notice in a late number of the Farm 
 Journal, that Mr. Samuel Gilleland, of Centre County, 
 holds out the idea, that the levying of a suitable tax on 
 all male stock that are kept to breed from, would be the 
 means of removing our scrubby animals, and bringing in 
 their places, good seed stock of superior breeds. But it 
 appears to me if Ave had a law to put a fine on all male 
 seed stock found running at large, off the owners premi- 
 ses, — say two dollars for ahull, and one dollar for a boar, 
 or ram, — farmers then would try to keep such stock 
 within their own inclosures. 

It would prevent them running the highways, and 
 breaking in the enclosures of farmers that are raising 
 good stock. Now it is almost an impossibility for you to 
 take a cow, or a sow, any distance to where good male 
 seed stock is kept, without meeting with, and beating 
 away mean scrubby animals at every nook and corner. 
 But in regard to levying a tax on all male seed stock, 
 it might not be the means of improving stock, as fast as 
 might be supposed, for this reason, we find too many
