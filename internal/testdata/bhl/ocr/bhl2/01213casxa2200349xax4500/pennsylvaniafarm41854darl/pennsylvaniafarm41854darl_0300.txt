Lancaster County Agricultural Society. 
 Mr. Darlington : — The "Lancaster County Agricul- 
 tural Society" will hold lis first annual exhibition at Co- 
 lumbia, on the 13th, 14th and 15th days of September. 
 Though the Society has been in existence some five or 
 six yeais it has thus far made "no noise in the world," 
 the managei-s having heretofore deemed it inexpedient to 
 hold exhibitions ; but now from the great and increasing 
 favor with which such fairs are viewed by all classes of 

the community, and general success attending them, the 
 managers have come to the conclusion that now is the 
 proper time to make a display. If the managers are 
 properly seconded in their eflorts, of which they have 
 every assurance, the "rest of mankind" will see that old 
 Lancaster county when once fully aroused will not lag 
 far behind her sister counties in the march of improve- 
 ment of agriculture and mechanics — like her "Conestoga 
 teams" not "fast but sure." 

Columbia has been selected as the place of holding the 
 exJiibitiou on account of its convenience to the various 
 railroads, its many large and well conducted hotels, the 
 liberality of the inhabitants, &c. 

The officers of the Society are : 

President — Benjamin Herr, Esq. 

Vice Presidents — John ISIiller, J. B. Garber. 

Managers — Hon. John Strohm, Benj. Eshleman, J. 
 Frantz, J. Hartman Hershey, J. H. Hershey, Levi P. 
 Reist, Abraham Peters. 

Secretary Eshleman. 

Corresponding Secretary — Hon. A. L. Hays. 

Librarian — J. Myers.

. Bucks County Agricultural Exliibition. 

While preparing our forms for the foundry we received 
 a "poster" containing a schedule of premiums, instruc- 
 tions to committees, regulations, and a "general invita- 
 tion to the citizens of Bucks and neighboring counties, 
 and of New Jersey, to attend the exhibition and bring 
 with them articles of their own growth and production." 
 The prizes are open to competition for all who choose to 
 attend v/ithout regard to locality. This liberal course, 
 now being followed by several counties, is worthy of the 
 intelligent farmers of Bucks, and we trust it will meet a 
 generous return. The schedule is very extensive, very 
 general and very liberal. For further information see 
 poster, or address John S. Brown, Esq., Secretary. The 
 officers of the Society are : 

President — James C. Cornell. 

Vice Presidents — Wm. Stavely, Hector C. Ivines, Jolly 
 Longshore and Jacob H. Rogers. 

Corresponding Secretary — Thomas Warner. 

Recording Secretary — John S. Brown.
