Westmoreland County Agricultural Society. 

Mr. Editor — Dear Sir : — The Westmoreland County, 
 Agricultural Society, was organized on the 18th day of 
 February, 18-33, by appointing the following officers : 
 President, HON. WM. JACK, 
 Vice President, ALEXANDER CUBBERTSON, 
 Rec. Secretary, FRED. J. COPE. 

Treasurer, JOHN MORRISON. 

At an adjourned meeting of the Society, held on the 
 25th, of the same month, a constitution was reported and 
 adopted, and a large number of persons from all parts of 
 the County, gave in their names as members of the So- 
 ciety, but owing to the demise of both the President and 
 Vice President, nothing further was done until the 23d 
 of November, when, at the call of the Secretary, a meet- 
 ing was held at the Court House, in Greeusburgh, and 
 the Society was re-organized, by electing officers, and 
 adopting the old constitution. Our Fair will be held at 
 Greeusburgh, on the 11th, 12th, and 13th days of Octo- 
 ber, which time docs not interfere with that of any other 
 Fair in Western Pennsylvania. 

We have offered a better list of premiums, than any 
 other Society in the State did last j^ear, at least so far, 
 us they have been reported in the transactions of the 
 State Agricultural Society, amounting to nearly five hun- 
 dred dollars, and the several committees have power to 
 award discretionary premiums on all meritorious articles 
 not enumerated in the premium list. 

The following gentlemen, have been appointed as offi- 
 cers of the society, for the present year.

Chester County Agricultural Society. 

The exhibition of this Society, is to take place on the 
 8th and 9th of September, in Everhart's Grove, in West 
 Chester. A liberal and extensive premium list is pub- 
 lished, and as Chester County is generally admitted to 
 contain more good stock than any other county in the 
 State, a very gratifying display may be anticipated. 

The Chester County Horticultural Society will hold 
 its exhibition, commencing one day previous, and contin- 
 uing till the evening of the 9th. 

Perry County Society. 
 Perry County Exhibition will be held on the 18th 19th 
 and 20th of October.

Georgia, Augustsa, Oct. 23-26

National Cattle Show,.. Springfield, Ohio, Oct. 25-27 

From this list it appears that three great commercial 
 cities, Philadelphia, Baltimore and New York, Avill each 
 be the scene of a State Fail-, almost at the same time. 
 Those at Baltimore and New York will be exactly on the 
 same days, the 3d, 4th, 5th and Otli of October, while 
 that at Philadelphia will be a few days in advance. 
 Those citizens of Philadelphia who are expecting to reap 
 great benefit from our own exhibition, will see from this 
 that thej" will have rivals to contend with. No effort, 
 therefore, should be spared to make the demonstration 
 there a great one, and nothing that can be done to ren- 
 der it attractive and useful, and to call to it the attention 
 of a wide circle of country should be neglected.

 Those of our h'.dy friends who would like to treat their 
 lords to a green peach pie, or a dish of nicely stewed to-
