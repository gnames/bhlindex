torily,) from Giddes, Marsh & Co., manufticturers at 
 Lewisburg, Union county, Pa., "Hussey's Reaper and 
 MoAver." I used it to cut my -wlieat, barley and oats. 
 No machine could have done its work better. I cut and 
 put up fourteen acres of heavy wheat in ten hours, and 
 the next day finished the field, containing eighteen acres, 
 and cut five acres of barley. In cutting oats and barley 
 I had two men besides the driver, using a second plat- 
 form that the bundles might be hooked off at the side, 
 they rcquiiing to remain a few days before being bound. 
 I failed, however, in my attempt to cut grass. The fail- 
 ure, I am now satisfied, was no fault in the machine, but 
 in the man who had charge of it. This season the man- 
 ufacturers having sold a number of these machines in 
 this (Wyoming) valley, sent with them men to put them 
 in working order. The result was that in ten minutes 
 after my machine had been put in the grass, the same 
 man who had failed last year worked it to perfection I 
 cut with it twenty acres of heavy timothy and timothy 
 and red top, averaging one acre per hour, doing the 
 work much better than it could have been done with the 
 scythe. A part of my grass was much tangled and 
 lodged, and covered with a small running vine usually 
 found in timothy meadows along the banks of the Sus- 
 quehanna. 

The mowing and spreading of my grass, which gave 
 an average of two and a half tons to the acre, cost me 
 about thirty-seven and a half cents per acre. Some of 
 my neighbors paid three dollars per acre for scythe 
 mowing. Very respectfully yours,

Wire Fence. 

"Will some of the readers or corresrondents of the 
 Journal be so kmd as to give their experience in regard 
 to building wire fence, the best manner of constructing 
 it, cheapness and durability -considered, cost per perch, 
 &c. If so, I will be under quite an obligation, and no 
 doubt others will be equally well pleased to see the sub- 
 ject treated in the Journal. J. GORSUCII.

away into a heap, or for use, nnd the Lolu again tillod up 
 with similar earths; in this manner tiie liquid as well as all 
 other matter will bo saved, and be judiciously applied, which 
 otherwise would be lost. Another boneiicial effect is that it 
 prevents the accumulation of matter which if not removed 
 for a long time, becomes very offensive to the olfactory or- 
 gans. 

In fact in this as well as in all other manures, farmers can- 
 not be too careful, for by i<pending a few dollars in jirotoct- 
 ing the manures of their farms, and a proper attention to 
 composting, thej' will be amply repaid by an increase of 
 their crops and seldom be under the necessity of purchas- 
 ing Guano and other fertilizers. A.

 Manures. — Be Frugal. 

Mn. Editor : — Now that grain of all kinds is bringing a 
 price quite remunerative to the farmer, and as these high 
 prices are likely to continue, owing to the unsettled condition 
 of Europe, farmers have been desirous of increasing their 
 crops to the greatest extent ; consequently large crops have 
 been put out by many, who will not have the means of ma- 
 nuring well the grounds now under tillage for ensuing crops, 
 without the aid of Guano or other fertilizers : — as no kind of 
 grain can be raised successfully without the aid of manure, 
 I will give my plan of manuring two acres annually with 
 fourteen pigs. 

The pen is of boards, raised about two and a half feet from 
 the ground ; the floor is made close, and standing from the 
 trough so as to drain off all excrements, Ac. On the side of 
 the pen oppji.-iito the trough is a hole dug capable of liolding 
 fix or eight eart loads of earth, tliis being filled with rliich

Mowing and Reaping Machine. 

[We find the following, in a Jersey paper, which refers to a 
 county, Somerset iu New Jersey, not in Pensylvania. Dun- 
 ham's machine, we never before heard of. 

Can any of our readers inform us what it is and where 
 made?] 

It is our oj/niion that the Dunham's is the best combined 
 Mower and Reaper. That it does its work satisfactorily, 
 both in Mowing and Reaping; and is entitled to the premium 
 offered by the societ3% 

W^e ask permission also to state that as a Reaper ulune, 
 we think McCormick's the best maohine. Its work being 
 done in a surperior manner, and in the shortest time. 

As a Mower alone, Kotchum's machine does its work re- 
 markably well, and easily kept in order; a valuable consider- 
 ation to the farmer. Very respectfully,

Massachusetts Horticultural Society. 

The Massachusetts Horticultural Society has recentlj' a- 
 dopted the report of a committee which states that the 
 prizes awarded to Messrs. Ilovey & Co., of Boston, for the 
 Boston Pear and Hovey Cherry were obtained by improper 
 means, and recommending the amendment of the laws so 
 as to prevent such abuses in future. AVe are surprised that 
 this matter should have been allowed to rest until the fruits 
 have been widely disseminated upon the strength of the 
 prizes and committee reports. Such proccdings on the part 
 of the most influential society in America, can hardly fail to 
 shake the confidence of the comunity in all Horticultural 
 Societies. [Horticulturist. 

Mules vs. Horses. 

The following estimate in the difference of expense of keep- 
 ing Mules and Horses, is made by The Southern I'htntcr, 
 which from our acquaintance with these animals, we can en- 
 dorse : 

Ten horses will consume each 12 bbls. of corn per an- 
 num, say for twenty years, which is equal to 2,400 

bbls., worth on an average, $2.50 per barrel $6,000 

Shoeing ten horses will cost $30 per annum, (§3 each 

or more, which we have to i)ay,) say for twenty years, 000 

Cost of feeding on corn and shoeing ten horses for 

twenty years, $6,000 

Ten mules will consume each Obbls. of corn per annum, 
 say for twenty j-ears, which is equal to 1.200 bbls., 
 worth on an avrage, $2,50 per bu^hcl — no crpcuce 
 of shoeimj S.S.OOO 

Amount saved in twenty years by mules $3,000 

According to this estiinate wo save S."..()00 in twenty years, 
 or about $200 per annum, liy liaving mules instead of horse."; 
 and then the mules are umeh longer-lived and less liable to 
 disease.
