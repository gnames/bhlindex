Cultivation of Rye. 

Nest to Indian corn, no cereal is of so much importance 
 to this section of the country as rye. It differs from wlieat 
 in its adaptation to soil. The former succeeds best on a soil 
 which contains so much alumni as to give it censidcrable 
 tenacity. The latter seldom does well on such a soil, but 
 flourishes on those of a more silicious and porous character. 
 It is well adapted to the light soils of New England, while 
 on the slate loams of the valley of the Hudson and other 
 similar localities it is quite at home. The value of the crop 
 in this neighborhood is not fully appreciated. Thegreat re- 
 quisite in regard to its culture is that the soil and subsoil be 
 properly drained. It cannot bear cold water about its roots. 
 The crop can bo cheaply raised. It requires but little pre- 
 paration of the soil, though the yield is in proportion to the 
 goodness of the land and the favorableness of the season — 
 ranging from five to forty bushels to the acre. It is some- 
 times effected by blight or mildew, but less frequently than 
 wheat, and on the whole is comparatively a sure crop. 

The value of rye per bushel does not differ much in the 
 eastern markets from that of northern corn. The straw con- 
 stitutes an important item in the advantages of its cultiva- 
 tion. It is worth in this market an average of $15 per ton. 
 A fair crop, say twenty bushels to the acre, will give a ton 
 of straw to the acre. We are informed that two tons to the 
 acre have been obtained. The straw is used here chiefly as 
 bedding for horses; but among the Germans of Pennsylva- 
 nia, who generally understand the economical management 
 of horses, the grain is ground and the straw cut, and the 
 two mi.xod together forms the principal food of these noble 
 teams which always attract the attention of strangers. The 
 Oormans, too, make great use of rye in feeding themselves. 
 They are fond of the bread, and say it is stronger than that 
 from wheat. But good rye bread is no despicable food in 
 the best of families. When made from good sweet grain, 
 properly ground and bolted, and the proper skill used in all 
 the manipulations, it is not only wholesome but palatable, 
 and our city bakers who make it right, dispose of large 
 qu.antities. It was not so great a hardship as some suppose 
 that our New England ancestors were chiefly confined to 
 "rye and Indian" for bread-stuffs. According to some anal- 
 yses the proportion of nitrogen (the muscle-forming principle) 
 18 nearly the same in rye as in average samples of wheat. 
 Rye bread contains more sugar and keeps moist longer than 
 wheat-bread. 

Rye is not a hard crop for land, though land may be ex- 
 hausted by it. Grass grows far better after it than after 
 oats, and even better than after any grain except barley. 
 The proper time for sowing it is the same as that for winter 
 wheat — the fore part of September. Pasture land, or that 
 from which a crop of hay has been taken the present season, 
 may be used for it. It is better to plow it as soon as prac- 
 ticable, in order that the sod may become partially decom- 
 posed before sowing the grain. Light land plowed well once, 
 may be so worked with the barrow and field cultivator as not 
 to need another plowing. Six or seven pecks of seed to the 
 acre is the proper quantity. There is considerable difference 
 in varieties of rye. A variety called the multicole, intro- 
 duced from France several years since, was unusually pro- 
 ductive, but was not thought quite as good for bread as the 
 white rye. 

On dry ground, not likely to heave by frost, clover and 
 grass seeds may be sown with the rye. But where the ground 
 is not well drained, there is a liability to winter-killing, and 
 in such situations it is better to sow the clover and grass 
 seeds just as snow is going off in the spring. — Boat. Cnl.

A New Mowing Machine. 

The country gentleman, of July 15 th states. — Mr. Fisk 
 RussEL, of Boston, a practical mechanic of largo experiance, 
 has invented a mowing machine which differs in several par- 
 ticulars, both in principle and construction from those now 
 in successful operation, and decided advantages are claimed 
 for it. The driving wheel is the same as in Ketchum's; but 
 the vibratory motion is obtained from a wheel consisting of a 
 series of cams, by the undulating rim of which a lever is 
 made to move the knives. The knives are each seperate, 
 and play upon a steel pivot, acting as they vibrate, like a 
 pair of shears. The frame of the machine is supported by a 
 second wheel of the same size and oposite to the driving 
 wheel, which renders the movements of this machine more 
 steady, and obviates in a great measure, the side draught. 

The machine was tried last week on the farm of B. B. 

KiRTLAND. of Gi'cenbush, and did its work admirably. 
 There was no clogging, and apparently less power was re- 
 quired to operate it than other machines. It is simple in its 
 construction, and works with very little friction. Mr.RrsSEL 
 intended to devote the remainder of the hay season to experi- 
 menting with and prelecting his machine, and it will not be 
 offered for sale till another year. Any judgement as to the 
 superiority of the machine would be premature until further 
 trials are made but it certainly promises to be a valuable 
 labor saving impliment. 

Hedging. 

The enterprize and economy of our American farmers, are 
 carrying everything that pertains to the interests of ngrioul- 
 ture to a high degree of perfection. Everything that can be 
 made profitable and pleasing is vigorously engaged in by 
 them, except improvement in fencing their lands. In this 
 they are lacking. 

It is true, however, that many farmers throughout our 
 country are awakening up to their intere»its upon this Kub- 
 joet. They are throwing away their old, labor-expending, 
 timber-wasting and land-cncumbcring worm-fences; and 
 in their stead are cultivating straight and beautiful hedges, 
 which when at full maturity, and if properly managed, will 
 turn most all kinds of animal?, and not occupy over one-half 
 the ground taken up by the common rail fence; and aside 
 from their efficiency to protect crops, they adorn and beauti- 
 fy a farm. 

We think that no other subject in rural economy demands 
 more immediate attention and thorough investigation than 
 this, the hedging of our land.-*. The great amount of hard 
 labor it requires to make mil fences, and the growingscarci- 
 ty of timber in many parts of the United States, demand it. 
 Perhaps not more than one-half the improved farms in the 
 State of Ohio have a sufficiency of timber to refenco them. 
 Hence it is becoming necessary for us to fence our lauds in 
 some other way than to split our best timber into rails, and 
 thus deprive ourselves of an article which we will need more 
 for other purposes. 

Since this evidently is the case, it is to our interest, and 
 really our duty, to ascertain which is the cheapest and most 
 durable among other modes of fencing. This wo can only 
 learn by demonstration or critical investigation. 

We will now notice some of the advantages that a hedge 
 has over the ordinary rail fence. Many of our farmers have 
 from 80 to 100 acres of cleared land, and some of them much 
 more. We will put the average number of acres generally 
 enclosed at 80. Dividing tiiis into fields containing nine 
 acres each, we will have almost nine fields. It will require 
 960 rods of fence to enclose all these fields, and by jaitting 
 18 rails to each rod, which are not too many to make a good 
 fence, we will see — thus, 960x18 — 17280 — the amount of 
 rails that is used in building the fences. It will take two 
 logs three foetin diameter to make one hundred rails. Then 
 upon calculation, that it requires 345 logs, and a little over, 
 to make the 17,280 rails; each of the logs would make f.OO 
 feet of inch plank, which at its lowest market price, SI 25 
 per 100 feet, would make the lumber ^that all these logs 
 would make) worth $2587. This amount, and lunro, tho 
 majority of farmers have lost by not hedging; for it would 
 cost no more to have the lumber manufactured than it would 
 to have tho timber split into rails, and tho rails laid up and 
 arranged into a fence, and we will show clearly before we get 
 through with our thoughts upon this subject, that the cost of 
 labor in cultivating a hedge will be paid from heretofore 
 dormant sources. 

AVe have already said that the common worm fence is a 
 land-encumbering worm. It is impossible, from the man- 
 ner in which these fences are generally constructed to culti- 
 vate tho ground close up to them with our ordinary inijile- 
 ments of agriculture. The strip of land occupied by fences 
 between fields is generally nearly a rod wide, wo nuiy safely 
 say three-quarters of a rod. We will now see how much 
 land the farmer throws away, and worse than throws awoy. 
 for these strips of land are generally very productive ofbrush 
 and briers, and the farmer is obliged to expend nearly as 
 much time and labor to keep them down, as would be ncces- 
 sarj' to cultivate a good hedge. We have already seen that 
 it requires 960 rods of fence to enclose and divide SO acres 
 of land into conveniently sized fields, and this strip of land 
 occupied by the fence being three quarters of a rod wide, 
 wo will find upon calculation, that four and three quarters 
 acres of land are taken up by the fence, while a properly
