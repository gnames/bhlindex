green food in summer. It stands drought better than any 
 other crop ; and if the soil be rich, an immense amount of 
 nutrieious food can bo obtained per aero — certainly more 
 than from any other summer crop. For this crop the soil 
 should bo either naturally very rich or bo well manured. 
 Let it be prepared as you would your other corn lan<l. The 
 deeper it is plowed, and the mellower it is made, the better. 
 Four bushels of seed should bo sown broadcast per acre, as soon 
 after corn planting as possible. If the soil is moist and in 
 good, fine order, soak the seed corn for twenty four hours 
 previous to sowing. In this way it will be up in two or three 
 days, and will get the start of the weeds ; and if the corn is 
 sown thick, and grows well, it will smother them all, and leave 
 the land in good condition for the following wheat crop. 
 Perhaps, however, it would be best to sow the corn in rows 
 twelve or fifteen inches apart, and hoe it once or twice ; the 
 corn would grow more rapidly, and the soil would be 
 cleaner. 

Lucerne answers well for soiling purposes, but its culti- 
 vation is attended with considerable labor in keeping the soil 
 free from weeds. It is a perennial plant, and does not roach 
 its full growth till the third year. On a rich, sandy loam, 
 well underdrained, jdowed, and subsoilod, immense crops oi 
 lucerne can bo grown. Guano is a splendid manure for this 
 crop, and possesses the advantage of being free from weeds. 
 Lucerne is sown earlier in the spring, in rows from one to 
 two feet apart ; eight or ten pounds of seed per acre. It 
 must be frequently hood and kept free from weeds, and should 
 bo cut hut once the first year; it will afford three or four 
 crops in a season. 

A Barn. 

The Enfield Shakers are building a granite barn for their 
 cows. It is to bo two hundred and fifty feet in length, fifty 
 feet wide, and will probaply cost $13,000. Mr. Elkinds the 
 artist, gives the following description of the edifice : 

"The location and arrangemouts of this barn edifice, are in 
 many respects admirable. Its outer walls are of stone and 
 its roof of slate. It is located across a gentle ravine, open- 
 ing from bank to bank, and is arranged that teams laden with 
 hay may enter at eather gable, precipitate the load to the 
 bay below, pass on, and make their egress at the other end. 
 Such a situation has enabled them extend a cellar its whole 
 length for the reception of the manures, both solid and liquid 
 which are kept from filtration or otherwise escaping down- 
 wards by a plank floor laid upon a stratum of clay, wrought 
 as a bed if morter. The descent of the grounds upon the 
 back part of the barn renders ingress and egress to and 
 from the cellar convenient and easy for carrying pond mud 
 and manure. The cows will be tethered all upon the .south 
 side of the barn, and in one continuous longitudinal stable 
 si.\teen feet in width, with walls plastered inwardly with lime 
 morter. and le.aveing a wall behind the gutters, of four feet 
 in width, and a corridor or passage between the cribs and 
 mows upon the North side, (preserves the warmth of the barn 
 throughout,) sufiiceatly wide for a horse and cart to pass, 
 which is often conveniant, when feeding with green food. 

The scaffolds above the cows are the best depository for 
 litter, which is letdown through a trapdoor in the rear of the 
 cows; an also, when partitioned into rooms, serve as a place 
 for a herdsman's otfieo. All these .arrangements render it 
 perhaps the most convenient, and it is undoubtedly the most 
 e.xpensive barn in America. Its hight to the eaves, upon the 
 back side, ''s to be thirty-feet, stables, eight feet, [including 
 timbers] and scaftolds, sixteen feet. Flooring for teams 
 framed four feet below the eaves." 

Guanite. 

The .appendix to the report of the Department of Science 
 and art contains some correspondence respecting the crystals 
 of guanite, which, it is stated, is found in considerable quan- 
 tities .at the Falkland Isles. The duko of Newcastle 
 requested Dr. Lyon Playfair to obtain some information with 
 respect to its value. Mr. Way, the chymist reports that gu- 
 anite' when properly ground to powder for application to the 
 land, will make an excellent manure, suitable for corn and 
 green crops, andthat it would be worth from 11. to 8^. per ton 
 in England. leahboe guano, ho s.ays, which had a ready s.alo 
 at 7/., contained on the average a littlemore ammonia, but 
 only half as much phosphoric .acid as gnanite. Dr. Lj'on 
 Playfair had before drawn attention to the crj-st.als of guanite 
 which he observed in the samples of guano sent home from 
 the Falkland Islands ; he stated that guanite, being in reality 

phosphate of magnesia and ammonia, must form a rich ma- 
 nure, well worthy of being imported.

Mowing Machine Trial. 

Casadigua, Friday July 7. 
 In the case of Howard and others vermis Forbush and 
 others, in the U. S. Circut Court, Judge Hall presiding, a 
 verdict has just been rendered by the jury in favor of plan- 
 tiffs on every issue. The jurj' found first, that Wm. F. 
 Ketchum was the original and first inventor of the improve- 
 ments in mowing machines claimed in his re-issue patent of 
 April 185.3. Second, that the re-issued patent of Ketchum of 
 April 1853, is for the same inventions desired and intended 
 to have been patented in his original patent of July, 1847; 
 and third, that the Forbush machine embraces both the 
 foregoing claims, and is an infringement of Ketchum's re-is- 
 sued parent.

Worms on Quince Trees. 
 I heard various accounts of the disease now threatening the 
 entire destruction of the Quince tree, which so conflict with 
 e.ach other, that they are entirely unsatisfactory. There is 
 one matter, however, upon which they all agreej that it is 
 the work of an insect or worm. 

The practice of gr.afting pears on quince stocks has become 
 so common, that it is important to know weather the stump 
 on which the graft grows will in time be subject to this affec- 
 tion, if as, to endeavor to find a preventative. 

Many persons are in the habit of examining their Quince 
 trees twice a year, April and October, and if they succeed in 
 finding the worm in April, it has been eating the tree all 
 winter, and done all the harm it can; and if in October, it has 
 bored so far into the tree as to render it almost impossible 
 to get at it without cutting away large portions of the tree, 
 and when accomplished seems " like locking the stable after 
 the horse is stolen." 

I have some trees which a few years ago bore smooth, large 
 and round fruit. Three or four years ago they became un- 
 health}', gradually declining; the limbs and fruit became 
 knotty, the latter entirely worthless, the trunk bored full 
 of holes, .almost destroying vitalitj'. 

Determined if possible to stay their depredations, in the 
 month of May of last year I carefully removed the earth 
 from the trunk of the trees, together with the loose b.ark and 
 decayed wood, that I might have this portion of the tree 
 smooth and thus be enabled to discover at once any change 
 that might occur. In the forepart of June the wasps, hor- 
 nets and blow-flies collected on spots over the tree nearest to 
 the ground, and on the most healthy parts, and from which 
 there was a, slight discharge of moisture, that they fed on 
 upward, and appeared to be very fond of, as they could not 
 be driven away, and must have appropriated much to their 
 use which should have been given to the fruit. The dis- 
 charge gradually increased until the tenth of July, when it 
 became dry, and instead of s.ap a substance resembling saw- 
 dust was excluded. Upon examination I found just beneath 
 the bank, in all the parts atTected, from one to four worms 
 of the order Lepedoptera, with black heads, from an half an 
 inch to an inch in length. The bark over them had not been 
 eaten ; they prey exclnsivelj' on the wood. 

The trees from which the}' were destroyed last year exhib- 
 it no marks of the worm having wintered with them through 
 last winter, but they have been again pierced, and within a 
 few days I have taken m.au}' worms ; but find the health of 
 the trees much improved, and am satisfied that dstroying 
 these worms every summer will entirely restore the health 
 of the trees and quality of the fruit. The latter part of July 
 and fore part of August is the proper time to destroy them. 

In addition to what is said .above, it should be remember- 
 en that the pear on quince stock may bo secured entirely 
 .against the quince borer by burying the quince stock in 
 planting below the surface. The borer works only at the 
 surface. The quince is not so readily injured by deep plant- 
 ing as other trees, and sends out lateral fibres on all sides. 

Fertility of Nile Mud. 
 Tho celebrated microscopic philosopher, Ehrenberg, 
 has examined this mud, and finds its great fertility to be 
 owing, not so much to any peculiar mineral contribution, 
 or to tho presence of vegetable matter, .as it is to the vast 
 accumulation of extremely minute forms of microscopic 
 animals, which, by their decomposition, enrich the soil.
