he is over-heated ; he luys the foundation of troubles, that 
 are perfected in the full grown horse. 

For the first six months of his life, the chief food of the 
 foal is "mother's milk," although he will pick up, now and 
 then, a little else with all the pride of incipient horsehood. 
 If the mare be insufficiently fed during this period, or over- 
 worked, (which lessens her yield of milk,) the foal is, in 
 either case, half-starved ; and a half-starved colt is almost 
 never well made when he arrives at maturity. lie is always 
 a weed. He should be well fed from, and before the time of 
 his birth. 

At one year old, though the colt has by no means attained 
 his fullness of form, it may be decided whether or not to re- 
 tain him as a Stallion. If, at this age, however many good 
 points he may possess, indicafiona of contracted feet, foun- 
 der, or any of the other diseases heretofore mentioned as 
 transmissible, be seen, geld him at once. He ought not to 
 serve as a Stallion. 

At three j'ears old, a horse may be allowed very moderate 
 service. Over-taxation of his powers at this age — or at any 
 age, for that matter — is short sighted policy for the owner. 
 As a four-vear old, he will be more matured and full of vig- 
 or, aod at five he is still more able to do service. It is a too 
 common fault — this over-taxation of a Stallion's powers ; 
 and it tells both on himself and on his get. The English 
 limit for a prize horse, that "travels his district," is sixty 
 mares in a season, but eighty are often covered, without pre- 
 judice. What shall we say of horse-owners, who boast of 
 having had double these numbers served in a season by 
 their horse — sometimes three a day! 

A notable instance of the evils of over-taxing a horse's 
 proereative powers occurred in England, many years ago, in 
 the case of a celebrated stud belonging to H. R. H., the 
 Prince of Wales. The groom was permitted to pocket a 
 half-guinea fee from all comers ; and it may well be guessed 
 that no applicants were refused. The consequences were 
 serious to the horse, and to very many of his get. Another 
 instance is within our knowledge. A Stallion of some re- 
 pute in New England was allowed to serve one hundred and 
 forty-three mares in a season, and was then sold to go to 
 Virginia. Most of the colts of that j-ear proved to be mis- 
 erable creatures ; and in Virginia, in the year following, he 
 himself proved perfectly impotent. 

The small size of very many — I may say of a large ma- 
 jority — of our horses is an evil that is great, and growing 
 (like a cow's tail — downwards.) This may be attributed to 
 a poor selection of breeding mares ; the scant feeding of the 
 dam, before and after foaling — thus half starving the foal ; 
 bad usage of colts by stinted food or unsheltered exposure 
 to cold and storms, and the general over-taxation of the 
 powers of stallions. 

We are well aware that seme persons, who pass for wise 
 men in matters of horse-flesh, contend that the smallness of 
 size is no objection to a horse ; and cite for proof the fact 
 that some of the fleetest Arabian coursers are but 14J hands 
 high. Admit that these Arabian lightning-streaks are of so 
 small a size, and what does it prove ? Nothing. When the 
 American's horse has nothing to do, but to bear a hirsute, 
 pinguid vagabond, over sand deserts, on hen-roost-robbing 
 expeditions, 14J hands will be high enough (until the rider 
 rivals Haman.) But so long as the farmer has sward-land 
 to plow, cord-wood to draw, and a stout wife and half-score 
 of stalwart sons and buxom daughters to bo driven to meet- 
 ing, or to the State Fair ; — so long as our city carriages are 
 ponderous and trucks weighty ; — so long shall we need a 
 little more height in our horses, and that not all in the 
 legs. 

The subject of increasing the size of our horses will more 

properly be discussed in an article on Ereeding Mares ; for 
 it is with the mare that the improvement must commence. 
 To subject small mares to large sized stallions will uot effect 
 the desired change. It will give us, as it did to the York- 
 shire farmers, who tried a similar experiment, "a race of 
 long-legged, large-boned, small-chested, worthless animals." 
 Such, also, was the ill effect, said our lost friend J. S. Skin- 
 ner, of the cross by a large "Cleveland Bay" Stallion, im- 
 ported and sent to Carroll's Manor, Maryland. 

"The proper method," says Professor C'line, of London, 
 "of improving the form of animals consists in selecting a 
 iveli-Jormed female, prtq^ortlonately larger than the male. 
 The improvement depends on this principle : that the power 
 of the female to supply her offspring with nourishment is iii 
 proportion to her size, and to the power of nourishing her- 
 self from the excellence of her own constitution." 

"The size of the foetus (he continues) is generally in pro- 
 portion to that of the male parent, and therefore, when the 
 female parent is disproportionately small, the quantity of 
 nourishment is insufficient, and her offspring has all the dis- 
 proportion of a starveling." 

"To produce the most perfect formed animal," adds the 
 same high authority, "abundant nourishment is necessary 
 from the earllext jieriod of its existence until its growth is 
 complete." This sustains the view that we have hereinbe- 
 fore advanced. 

On the Choice of Brood Mares. 

There can be no doubt but that the breeding of horses of 
 a superior description would amply repay those farmers who 
 are possessed of the requisite knowledge ; and whose farms 
 present a suitable combination of light, productive, arable 
 land, with pasture of good quality. The price of first rate 
 horses has advanced in a remarkable degree of late years, 
 and is not likely to decline so long as the country enjoys an 
 ordinary degree of prosperity. It is every where matter of 
 complaint among buyers that good horses never were so 
 scarce as at the present moment ; and the man who is pos- 
 sessed of a weight-carrying hunter, or a fine carriage horse, 
 will, if inclined to sell, not find himself long without a cus- 
 tomer. Still, notwithstanding these inducements, the breed- 
 ing of horses on a large scale is confined to a few districts, 
 of which the principal are the East and part of the North 
 Riding of Yorkshire, Lancashire, and part of Northumber- 
 land. On the Y^orkshire Wolds it is a pleasant sight to see 
 field after field with its half-score of handsome colts ; some 
 of them adapted for the chase, while others are destined for 
 London carriage horses. Though not so plentiful as I re- 
 member them twenty years ago, especially the higher bred 
 ones, they are still to be found in sufficient numbers to show 
 that the farmer considers them a portion of his stock pro- 
 ductive of profit, and consequently worthy of attention. 
 Even there, however, breeders might with advantage pro- 
 pose to themselves a higher standard, and aim at producing 
 hunters of the first class, which would surely remunerate 
 them better than the leggy and somewhat underbred coach 
 horses, which are every way less suited to the requirements 
 of customers. One reason why hunters are not bred there 
 so extensively as in former years, is, that farmers, either 
 tempted by the high prices offered by foreigners, or under 
 the pressure caused by agricultural distress, have, from time 
 to time, parted with their best brood mares. Much as it is 
 to be lamented that either good mares or stallions should 
 ever leave the country, there are, nevertheless, abundance 
 remaining from which to rear, with judicious management, 
 a valuable breed of young horses. In the hopes of afford- 
 ing some encouragement to the extension of this impor- 
 tant department of agriculture, I offer the following hints : —
