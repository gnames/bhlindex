One of the most important elements of success is the choice 
 of brood mares. Never breed from a mare which is not well 
 bred. By well bred I do not mean having many crosses of 
 blood ; for many mares, nearly and even quite thoroughbred, 
 are very undesirable animals to breed from. A well bred 
 mare, in the true sease of the word, is one of which the pro- 
 genitors for many generations back have been carefully se- 
 lected. In this respect Yorkshire breeders possess a consid- 
 erable advantage over those who reside in districts where 
 breeding is less extensively carried on. In the former coun- 
 try it is easy for a farmer, even of moderate means, to pro- 
 cure mares which are above the suspicion of being tainted 
 with cnrt-blood. Owing to the abundance_both of thorough- 
 bred and "nag"* stallions, a roadster-mare is seldom or 
 never put to a horse of inferior stamp to herself. Thus with 
 little or no trouble or cost, a class of mares is in the hands 
 of Yorkshire farmers which elsewhere it would require much 
 expense and research to gain. With but little of outward 
 show to recommend them, they breed excellent hunters, 
 when put to a suitable thoroughbred horse ; whereas mares 
 of similar appearance in other countries would only produce 
 stock fit for harness — if, indeed, they were good for any- 
 thing. The reason is, that in the latter case the cart or oth- 
 er inferior crosses would re-appear, and thus baffle the calcu- 
 lations of the breeders. ' 

Perhaps mares such as the Yorkshire farmers use are, on 
 the whole, the safest for the agriculturist to breed from. 
 Although not so high bred as some others, they are less ex- 
 pensive to purchase, and require less judgment in their choice 
 than those of a more ambitious character. They possess 
 one recommendation which the farmer should never lose 
 sight of — I mean power. Let his object be to produce a colt 
 which, if it fails as a hunter, will be useful in harness ; or, if 
 some accident should unfit him for fast work, will at any rate 
 take his share of work on the farm. I know no better test 
 of success than this, viz : That the colt which loses a por- 
 tion of its conventional value should yet retain its real use- 
 fulness. Always make strong, well-set-on forelegs a prima- 
 ry object. They should be placed forward, so as to be an 
 efficient support to the animal ; and the shoulder ought to 
 stand backward, in order to allow the legs liberty of action; 
 but it must be somewhat round and full, not thin and con- 
 fined, which some persons conceive to be a /iiie shoulder. 
 Never breed from cither mare or stallion with a decidedly 
 bad shoulder. An animal may dispense with almost every 
 other point of excellence, and yet be of some value ; but if 
 it has a bad shoulder, it bears so thoroughly the stamp of 
 worthlessness, that nothing else can make amends for this 
 fundamental malformation. If }'our mare is tolerable in her 
 shoulders, but not very good, endeavor to find a stallion 
 which is particularly excellent in this respect. The fore- 
 legs and shoulders being right, action usually follows. But 
 this being a very important point, do not take it for granted, 
 but subject it to your strictest scrutiny. For my own part, 
 I almost think as highly of action in a horse as Demos- 
 thenes did of it in reference to an orator ; at any rate, not 
 even the most fabulous combinations of beauty, breeding, 
 temper and shape, would induce me to buy a horse which 
 did not possess it. 

The foot ought to be taken up straight by a graceful bend 
 of the knee, and sot down again flat, without any deviation 
 either outwards or inwards. The most common faults of 
 action are a sort of shovelling movement forwards, with the 
 knees almost straight, and a sideways motion, either out- 
 wards or inwards, with one or both feet. But it is quite 
 possible for the knee to be too much bent, and the foot to bo

apparently pushed backwards when taken up instead of for- 
 wards, thus causing it to be set down too near the place 
 whence it was raised. Objectionable, however, as such 
 stand-still action may be in a hack, I should prefer it in a 
 brood mare to the opposite defect. 

The great reason why action in the mare is so essential is, 
 that she having the roadster blood ought to supply it; 
 whereas, it is not always possible to find it in a stallion ; it 
 is, indeed, very rare to see a thorough-bred horse whose ac- 
 tion is such as would be desirable in the park hack, the 
 roadster, or the hunter. The racing man cares not, provi- 
 ded his horse's head is first seen at the winning-post, in 
 what form he moves his forelegs. The qualities which win 
 fame for the racer are speed, endurance and pluck. The 
 conformation most conducive to speed depends more on the 
 back, loins and hindlegs than on the forelegs ; it is there- 
 fore by no means uncommon to find horses, whose perform- 
 ances on the turf have been above mediocrity, with forelegs 
 such as would not wear for three months on the road, and 
 with action such as no man would willingly endure in his 
 hack or his hunter. Thoroughbred horses, with every point 
 such as the breeders would desire, combining power and 
 beauty, equally excellent in their forelegs, their ribs, and 
 their hindlegs, are not to be met with in every neighbor- 
 hood, and even when found will seldom cover half-bred 
 mares at all, and then only at exorbitant prices. These are 
 the magnates of the stud which will not condescend to 
 mates of descent less illustrious than their own. If, then, 
 you cannot secure their services, you must avail yourself of 
 the best within your reach. Supposing your mare has the 
 forelegs of the action which I have recommended, you may 
 safely put her to a horse which has tolerable forelegs, provi- 
 ded he is in general power, in pedigree, and in performance 
 such as you desire. I mentioned in a former letter that I 
 once put some mares of my own to "Tomboy ;" his forelegs 
 were by no means first rate, and his front action was deci- 
 dedly scrambling and bad; but my mares being excellent in 
 both these points, their stock showed no traces there of their 
 sire's deficiency. To breed colts with bad forelegs and in- 
 sufficient bone, is to encumber your land with stock neither 
 useful nor saleable. With mares of first rate excellence in 
 that respect, you greatly extend the range of stallions which 
 it is safe to put to them. 

I shall not enlarge upon other points of the mare in de- 
 tail, for the reason that their selection may in general be 
 left to the discretion of the beeeder ; and also, because there 
 are many of them which in practice will be more frequently 
 supplied by the horse than the mare. I must say, however, 
 that I should not like to breed from a mare with a bad head 
 or a small ej'e. Natural soundness, especially in the feet, 
 is very important, and so is good temper. With mares, as 
 with cows and ewes, there is a certain character difficult to 
 describe, but which the experienced breeder knows by in- 
 stinct, as belonging to those likely to produce good stock. 
 It is not the largest, or the most showy, but those which 
 have a certain refinement of form, and a gracefulness of out- 
 lino, (which are as characteristic of the well-bred female as 
 power and muscle are of the male,) which will most faith- 
 fully reflect in their offspring their own merits, and those of 
 its sire. Many a large, showy mare, on the contrary, will 
 be provokingly uncertain in her produce ; one year bringing 
 a foal as much undersizo .ts next year it is overgrown. Such 
 a mare ought to be discarded as soon as possible. 

By observing the course which I have recommended, far- 
 mers who exercise ordinary judgment will make as safe an 
 investngent as they would in the breeding of any other kind 
 of stock. Their colts will make either hunters, carriage 
 horses, or hacks of a useful and powerful kind.
