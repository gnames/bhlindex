Self-Eegnlating Windmill. 

Daniel Halliday, a mechanic in an obscure country village, 
 Bellington, Connecticut, has done what the world of mechan- 
 ics have sought for in vain for centuries . He has invented 
 and put in successful operation a Windniill with self furling 
 sails. The mill built by him has five feet wings, that is, the 
 diameter of the wind-wheol is ten feet, and it has been in 
 operation for si.x months without a hand being touched to it 
 to regulate the sails. It ran fifteen days at one time with- 
 out stopping day or night, and it has stood through hard 
 gales: the beauty of the improvement is, that it does standstill 
 when the wind rages hardest, with the edge of the wings to 
 the wind, and as it lulls they gradually resume their position 
 for a gentle breeze. It is so contrived th:it nothing but a 
 squall of great severity falling upon it without a moment's 
 warning can produce damage. 

The mill mentioned has drawn water from a well twenty 
 eight feet deep, one hundred feet distant and forced it into 
 a small reservoir in the upper part of the barn, sufiicient for 
 all farm purposes, garden irrigation, "and lots to spare. " 

The cost of such a mill will be $5(1, and the pipes about 
 4>25. It is elevated on a single oak post a foot square, the 
 turn circle being supported by iron braces. The wings are 
 made of one longitudinal iron bar, through which run smoll 
 rods; upon these rods narrow boards half an inch thick are 
 fitted, holes being bored through from edge to edge, and screw 
 ed together by nuts on the ends of the rods. This makes 
 strong light sails, but as will be seen are light fixtures not 
 to be furled or clewed up; but they are thrown up edge 
 to the wind by a very ingenious and simple arrangement of 
 the machinery, which obviates the great objection to wind- 
 mills for farm use; the necessity of constant supervision of 
 the sails to suit the strength of the wind. 

Wind is undoubtedly the cheapest power that a farmer 
 can use, and, notwithstanding its inconstancy, if this im- 
 provement operates as well as it bids fair to in the single 
 mill erected, it will be applied to many valuable u.ses. By 
 windmills swamps may be drained and upland irrigated. 
 What an advantage would be the latter in such a draught as 
 prevails now in many parts of the country, besides the great 
 amount of fertilizing matter in water at all times. The 
 windmill could be used too for all grinding of grain for farm 
 use, driving the washing machine and the churn, pumping 
 the water I'rom the well or spring — often one of the hardest 
 kinds of labor about the house. Liquid manure, and the solid 
 excrement made to liquid, could be sent to a field through 
 leading pipes by the same power. 

We do earnestly hope for the success of this improvement 
 — that it will not only be an ornament but a thing of useful- 
 ness to many Ameican farmers. 

What the Farmer most Needs. 
 They need organization. Thej' want farmers' clubs, and 
 neighborhood libraries of agricultural books. They need 
 discussion. They need more intercourse, not only in their 
 own town and county, but throughout the state and country, 
 to see and learn what other farmers are doing, and adopt 
 the improvements made bj' them. They need to become 
 satisfied with their vocation; to get rid of the prevailing notion 
 that farming is necessarily an uumental employment; that 
 is, that the farmer has no occasion to think; has no occasion 
 for education, and never can become wealthy or what tho 
 world would call respectable, while engaged in the culture of 
 the earth, and therefore he seeks the first opportunity to 
 escape from an avocation placed under ban not only by all 
 others, but his own class also. The great need of the far- 
 mer is, that he shall declare himself independent of all 
 other classes, at least more so than they are of him, and of 
 course he is entitled to engage in any other calling what- 
 ever; and if he is a man of toil, that is no reason why he 
 should not be a man of intellect. The great need of the 
 farmer is organization, and this must bo accomplished by 
 a few self-sacrificing men, who will undertake the labor of 
 establishing and maintaining farmers' clubs in everj' neigh- 
 borhood. Farmers need to drop politics, and take up ag- 
 riculture. They must talk, and read and think, and they 
 will be sure to act or their children will act for them. 

Death of an Agricultural Editor. 

Prof. Charles Fox, senior Editor of the Farmer's Compan- 
 ion, died of cholera at Detroit, Mich, .on the 24th ult. This 
 occasions a serious loss to the community generally, and to 
 that State in particular.
