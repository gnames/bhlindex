PATENT GUANO SPSEADER. 

The above is an engraving of a Patent Guano Spread- 
 er, which, we are assured, has been found on trial to 
 answer the purpose most completely of crushing and 
 distributing guano with groat evenness and regularity. 
 The spreading of guano, and the necessary pulverization 
 of its hard lumps, is one of the most unpleasant and te- 
 dious operntinns of the farm. The want of a good ma- 
 chine for the purpose has been a great desideratum, and 
 the patentee of the above has been experimenting for 
 several months with the view to make it as perfect as 
 possible. Tlie construction is very much on the prin- 
 ciple of Cooper's Lime Spreader, and it can be regulated 
 to sow from 80 to 400 pounds to the acre. 

The patentee is willing to submit it^ to the test of a 
 full trial, and c;in ])roduce certificates from those who 
 have already used it. 

Paschall Morris & Co., corner of Seventh and Market 
 streets, Philadelpliia, are ngents for the above Guano 
 Spreader. Price ,$85. 

llore Imported Stock. 

The Boston Cultivator of .Vugnst 12th informs us that 
 the steamer Herman landed iit New York on the 2d ult., 
 for Messrs. Morris & Becar, three v.aluable Short-Horn 
 cows, as follows: 

Duchess 6(jth — bred by Thomas Bates — rich roan ; 
 calved October 25, 1 850 : got by Fourth Duke of York 
 (10167), .dam (Duchess 55th) by Fourth Duke of Nor- 

thumberlan.l (8649), (Duchess 38th) by Norfolk 

(2.377), (Duchess 33d) by Iklvidere (1766), 

(Duchess 19th) by Second Hubback (1423,) (Duchess 

12th) by the Earl (1C46, (Duchess 4th) by Eetton 2d 

(710), (Duchess 1st) by Comet (155), by Favor- 
 ite (252), by Daisy Bull (186), by Favorite (252), 

by Hubback (319), by J. Brown's Red Bull. 

Duchess 06th was purchased in 1853 at the sale of the 
 stock of the late Earl Ducie, by L. G. Morris and N. J. 
 Becar, for £735 (.$3675), a larger sum than is known to 
 have ever been brought by any other cow. She is of 
 medium size, for the breed, and is almost perfection in 
 the points aimed at by the leading breeders of Short- 
 Horns. A heifer calf of hers, by Duke of Glo'ster, was 
 left in England, being too young for shipment. 

Oxford 6th — bred by Thomas Bates — red ; calved No- 

vember 6, 1846 ; got by Second Duke of Northumber- 
 land (3646), dam (Oxford 2d) by Short Tail (2621), 

(Matchem Cow) by Matchem (2281), by Young Wy- 

nard (2859). 

Oxford 6th was purchased at the sale of Earl Ducie's 
 stock by J. S. Tanquery, for £215 5s., and was sold by 
 him at the same price to N. J. Becar, of New York. 
 She is a cow of great size and substance, but by no 
 means coarse. We have seldom seen her equalled in 
 fineness and symmetry by one so large. 

Miss Belleville — bred by John Mason Hopper — roan ; 
 calved February, 1853 ; got by Belleville (G778), dam 
 (Carnation) by Goldsmith (10277), (Crocus) by Pe- 
 trarch (7239), (Violet) by Forester (3825), by 

son of Fleetham (2028), from the herd of Mr. Whit- 

aker, of Gi-eenholme. 

Miss Belleville was engaged of Mr. Hopper by Mr. 
 Becar last season. She will be a decided acquisition to 
 Mr. B.'s herd, as she possesses a strain of valuable 
 blood which is very rare in this country, and is, individ- 
 ually, nearly a model. Her sire, Belleville, was the most 
 remarkable prize taker of any bull ever bred in Great 
 Britain. He took the highest prizes in the class of 
 Short-Horns of the Royal Agi-icultural Society of Eng- 
 land, the Agricultural Improvement Society of Ireland, 
 the Highland and Agi-icultural Society of Scotland, the 
 Yorkshire Agricultural Society, and after receiving all 
 these honors, capped the climax by carrying a sweep- 
 stakes of £70 ($350) at the Show of the Highland So- 
 ciety at Glasgow in 1850, against twenty competitors. 

More Imported Stock. 

The ship Antartic arrived at New York the last of Au- 
 gust, and had on board a fine lot of stock for the Ken- 
 tucky stock importing company, consisting of six Dur- 
 ham cows, eight heifers, one calf, fifty-four Cotswold 
 sheep, eighteen swine, five bulls, and one Cleveland Bay 
 stallion, a fine animal, costing over $1,000. 

Another lot on the same vessel, belonging to Col. Wm. 
 Alexander, of Woodford county, consisted of eight heif- 
 ers, four cows and three bulls. They all arrived in fine 
 condition, and have been well cared for during the voy- 
 age. These additions to our improved stock cannot but 
 be of great advantage to the country.
