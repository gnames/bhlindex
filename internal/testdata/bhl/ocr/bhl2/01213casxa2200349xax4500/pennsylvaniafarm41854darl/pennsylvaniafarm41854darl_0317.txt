Lime a Preservative of Potatoes. 

We find the following report of experiments in keep- 
 ing potatoes in the English Gardeners' Chronicle. The 
 experiments were made in a more humid climate than 
 our own, and where greater precautions are necessary to 
 prevent stored potatoes from decaying. There are, how- 
 ever, some localities within the "bailiwick" of the Farm 
 Journal where these hints may be of service : 

1. Twelve sacksful of potatoes, lifted October 25th, 
 1853, stoi-ed with lime, the lime being placed in small 
 bundles in the middle of each sack. Tubers all pre- 
 served; whereas, some of the same potatoes, stored 
 without lime, were much affected. 

2. Fifty busliels of potatoes, dug up towards the end 
 of October, were pitted with three bushels of quick-lime, 
 the latter being placed at the bottom of the pit, and cov- 
 ered over with a thick layer of Gorse. On opening the 
 pit it was found that the diseased tubers did not amount 
 to more than two dozen. Tubers stored in the ordinary 
 way, in pits without lime, were almost entirely destroy- 
 ed by disease. 

3. 4, 5. Potatoes stored with and without lime quite 
 untouched by the disease. 

6. Roots stored in a large chest or box with lime, and 
 the latter being placed in a small clothes-basket, and 
 covered over with faggots. On opening the box the tu- 
 bers were found quite he.althy, while some that had been 
 kept in a cellar without lime were much diseased. 

7. Twenty bushels of tubers were placed in a large 
 bin with three bushels of lime, the latter forming a stra- 
 tum at the bottom, and covered over with a thick layer 
 of coarse cinders. At the end of three months the roots 
 were found to be quite soimd, while another lot which 
 had been put into another bin without lime were very 
 much diseased. 

8. Potatoes housed in sacks, one or two large lumps 
 of lime being put into each sack, tubers quite dry, and 
 all preserved. 

9. Potatoes first dried by exposure on a gravel walk 
 to the heat of the sun, and then stored away in large 
 boxes with lime, all healthy. Tubers housed in their 
 natural condition become diseased. 

10. Potatoes housed with lime, all healthy. 

11. Same result. 

12. Several bushels of potatoes were pitted with lime, 
 and when examined, at the expiration of several months, 
 were found to remain untouched by the disease. Roots 
 pitted without lime became quite rotten. 

13. Two or three hundred bushels of potatoes were 
 divided into four equal lots. Three of these were pitted 
 with lime, the other in the ordinary way. In the first 
 of the three lots stored with lime, the lime was placed 
 at the bottom of the pit, with the proper precautions ; 
 in the second it was thrown into a conical heap in the 
 centre of the tubers ; and in the third and last, it was 
 placed on top of the potatoes, being separated from ♦,he 
 latter by a layer of brushwood, &c. On examining the 
 tubers at the end of some months, those in the first pit 
 were found to be much diseased, while those contained 
 in the other three were nearly healthy. "The best re- 
 sults," says this correspondent, "I am disposed to think 
 were obtained by placing the lime on the top of the tu- 
 bers, and this is the plan I intend to follow."

Book Notices. 

"The Modern Horse Doctor," by George H. Dadd, 
 Boston, published by John P. Jewett & Co. We have 
 received a copy of the above work, which, from the ex- 
 amination we have given it, appears to us the best prac- 
 tical treatise on the diseases of horses we have yet seen. 
 It contains numerous illusti-ations, is written in plain, 
 pi-actical style, embracing the author's own extensive 
 experience, with the most recent and approved methods 
 for preserving the health and curing all the diseases 
 horse flesh is heir to. In another column we give part 
 of the chapter on bots. 

The author discards many of the cruel and inhuman 
 practices often applied in treating diseases of horses, 
 and urges more scientific, rational and successful meth- 
 ods. 

We do not know if others have been as unfortunate as 
 ourselves with works on farrierj', but when we have had 
 occasion to refer to them for a sick hoi-se, it seems near- 
 ly alwaj'S to have happened that all the diseases and 
 symptoms ever heard of or thought of were minutely 
 described, except the particular case or cases then re- 
 quiring attention and about which we wished informa- 
 tion. 

Dadd's Modern Horse Doctor does not seem liable to 
 the same objection, and for the young student in veteri- 
 nary science, no less than for the practical farmer, who 
 wants a really practical work for daily reference, we 
 think it can be recommended without hesitation. 

A list of receipts used in veterinary practice is given 
 at the conclusion of the work with directions for prepa- 
 ring. It is in octavo form, containing 432 pages. 

Imported Cattle and Sheep. 

In our last we gave the pi-ice list of a recent importa- 
 tion of Short-Horns into AVarren county, Ohio. In Clin- 
 ton county, Ohio, thei-e has recently been a public sale 
 of Durhams, South Downs and Cotswold sheep and shep- 
 herd dogs, belonging to the Clinton county association. 
 It was held at Wilmington and resulted as follows : — 
 Seven bulls sold for $9,525. H. H. Hankins & Co., 
 Bloomington, Ohio, paid $3,700 for the Short-Horn bull 
 Wellington. This was the highest figure, the lowest be- 
 ing $G25. Three bull calves sold for $845. Seventeen 
 cows sold for $10,760, and one heifer calf for $525. 
 Three South Down bucks brought $315, and six ewes 
 $380. One Cotswold buck $70, and two ewes $170. A 
 shepherd dog and five pups sold for $170 50. The cost 
 of the importation up to the time of sale was $17,000, 
 and the sales amounted to $22,060 50. 

From the above and other similar results, it appears 
 that fine stock may be imported into the United States, 
 even at the present high prices, to good profit. With 
 the increased experience of caring for their comfort and 
 proper management on board ships, and selecting the 
 season of mild weather for the voyage, the risk is much 
 diminished from what it was a few years ago. It has 
 been found there is a real economy in employing a regu- 
 lar herdsman to attend them on the passage, instead of 
 leaving it to the mere chance and irregular attention of 
 the steerage passengers or sailors. Many of the recent 
 arrivals have come off ship in good condition. Wc would 
 however not advise, except under very special circum-
