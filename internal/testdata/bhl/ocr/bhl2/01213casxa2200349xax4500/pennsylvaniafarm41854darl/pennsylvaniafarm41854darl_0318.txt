stances and sidviintages, any farmer to uuiiertake by 
 himself tbc impoitation of blooded stock. There are 
 ten chances to one he will be cheated in the blood, or 
 lose by the operation. Some of the best blood of Eng- 
 land is now in this country, and we would greatly pre- 
 fer the importing of stock should be made by companies, 
 where the risk would be divided, and a qualified judge of 
 stock specially deputed to make the selections. 

What we most fear is that the present high prices may 
 have the effect to induce unprincipled persons to purchase 
 and collect stock to send to this country of impure blood 
 and imperfect pedigrees. We have reason to believe some 
 of Whitaker's importations a few years ago, which were 
 sold at public sale near Philadelphia, contained animals 
 of this description. A good pedigree is all important, 
 as it afibrds a reasonable certainty that the offspring will 
 inherit the qualities of the dam or sire. Grade animals 
 sometimes look like thorough breds, but their progeny 
 is not reliable. Neither is the mere fact of having a 
 pedigree, and a long one too, sufificient. It must be a 
 good one, tracing the descent not merely from a herd- 
 book animal, but from such as are di.itinffuia/ird for su- 
 perior qualities. This is the secret of the high prices of 
 the much sought for Bates blood, and the Duchess and 
 Princess family of Short-IIoi-ns. Their acknowledged 
 superiority in England is the result of the long continued 
 care and skill, for many years, of T. Bates. Other ani- 
 mals equal them in length of pedigree, but like other 
 patents of nobility do not represent distinguished ances- 
 try or qualities. There are unworthy scions from noble- 
 men so called, as well as noble cattle, and worth makes 
 the real value in both cases. 

For convenience of future reference, we give in anoth- 
 er column the names and residences of the purchasers of 
 the Clinton county association. None of the arrivals 
 ■went out of the State. 

Valuable Queries. 
 [We ask the attention of the farmers of Pennsylvania 
 to the following circular of the Montgomery County 
 Agricultural Society. If it is responded to, as we trust 
 it will be, the information thus obtained will be of great 
 advantage in enabling the inquirers after practical results 
 from the use of different manures, to select such only as 
 may insure a profitable return, and save them from be- 
 coming the dupes of arrant knaves who are palmina; 
 worthless trash on many unsuspecting victims. We hope 
 to have the pleasure of laying this laudable effort before 
 the readers of the Farm Journal :] 

Circular. 

In view of the importance to Farmers of an early ac- 
 quaintance with the fertilizing properties of substances 
 offered for sale as chemical or concentrated manures, 
 such as Phosphate and Super-Phosphate of Lime, im- 
 proved or prepared Guano, Fertilizers (so called) of 
 which the composition is unknown, and other manures 
 of the same class under other names ; and as their value 
 can only be determined by experience, 

TJiercfore, The Montgomery County Agricultural So- 
 ciety respectfully requests of the friends of Agriculture, 
 who have used or are about to use any of said manures, 
 that each will reply to the following Queries as promptly 

as he may deem proper, and furnish in addition such 
 other information not specially enquired after as he may 
 believe necessary to the forming of a correct judgment 
 of the value of such of said substances as he shall have 
 used, in oi'der that the information contained in the an- 
 swers collectively, which the Society propos'es to publish, 
 may be sufficient to prevent the sale of the inert and 
 worthless, and to encourage the purchase of those that 
 it shall be found profitable to use.

Work for the Month. 

Farm. — This is the mouth the "buskers" generally 
 commence their work, and in many cases finish it also. 
 Where seed corn has not been previously selected in the 
 field, care should be taken in husking to lay by the 
 largest and best ears for that purpose. A good way to 
 preserve it from mice is to hang it by the husks to raf- 
 ters, or other convenient places. Continued care in se- 
 lecting the earliest and best corn for seed will be well 
 repaid in a few years by improved general quality. 
 Corn is liable to heat in the crib if husked too early, 
 particularly in warm moist weather. The best way to 
 guard against this is to let it "cure well" in the shock, 
 but here danger is to be apprehended of cold fingers in 
 late huskings. Advantage will be found in putting only 
 sound, well ripened corn in the crib, leaving the "nub- 
 bens" and unripe ears for stock. Potatoes, if not pre- 
 viously gathered, should be "picked" without delay. 
 The ground should be immediately prepared for gi-ain, 
 and in order to avoid the delay of manuring previous to 
 plowing, it may be subjected to a top-dressing of well 
 rotted manure or superphosphate of lime. If the tim- 
 othy has not been sown it should now be done. Five 
 quarts of seed per acre are not too much, to be followed 
 by clover in oai'ly spring. If there is leisure plow the 
 corn ground for next season's crop. Plow deeply, and 
 where the subsoil is clay follow with a subsoil plow. At 
 leisure times collect leaves from lieadlands, coarse grass, 
 and other articles suitable for bedding stock and making 
 manure in the winter. 

Vegktable Garden. — Towards the latter part of the 
 month, cabbage, cauliflower and lettuce sown last month 
 may be transplanted into frames to be kept through the.
