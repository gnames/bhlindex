•which deposits its eggs on the horse's coat in such a 
 manner as that they shall be received into his stomach, 
 and then become bots. When the female fly has become 
 impregnated, and the eggs are sufficiently matured, she 
 geeks among the horses a subject for her purpose, and 
 approaching it on the wing, she holds her body neai'ly 
 upright in the air, and her tail, which is lengthened for 
 / the purpose, carried inwards and upwards. In this way 
 she approaches the part where she designs to deposit the 
 eggs, and suspending herself for a few seconds before it, 
 suddenly darts upon it, and leaves the egg adhering to 
 the hair by means of a glutinous liquor secreted with it. 
 She then leaves the horse at a small distance, and pre- 
 pares the second egg; and poising herself before the 
 part, deposits it in the same way ; the liquor dries, and 
 the egg becomes firmly glued to the hair. This is re- 
 peated by various flies, till four or five hundred eggs are 
 sometimes deposited on one horse. They are usually 
 deposited on the legs, side, and back of the shoulder — 
 those parts most exposed to be licked by the animal : in 
 licking, the eggs adhere to the tongue, and are carried 
 into the horse's stomach in the act of swallowing. The 
 bots attach themselves to the horse's stomach, and are 
 sometimes, though less frequently, found in the first in- 
 testine. The number varies considerably; sometimes 
 there are not half a dozen, at others they exceed a hun- 
 di'ed. They are fixed by the small end to the inner coat 
 of the stomach, to which they attach themselves by 
 means of two hooks." 

Cure. — It has been remarked that no effectual rem- 
 jedy has ever been discovered for the cure of bots. Yet 
 we venture to say that, in nine cases out of ten, if the 
 animal be premitted to run a short time at grass, when 
 the bot has attained its full growth, and is capable of 
 exercising an independent life, it will detatch itself from 
 the stomach and pass off with the excrement. We have 
 frequently brought away large quantities of bots during 
 the administration of the following articles, and we do 
 not hesitatate to recommend them as safe and efficient. 
 As a vermifuge, they are unrivalled ; at the same time 
 they restore the tones of the digestive organs.

The nit or egg can easily be got rid of by greasing the 
 horse's hair, and then rubbing it with a coarse cloth, or 
 by applying warm water, which loosens their hold on the

A Wool Grower's Method of Improving Ms Stock. 
 . [The following communication is from one of the most 
 distinguished wool growers of Western Pennsylvania. 
 We shall be glad to hear more particularly about his fine 
 flock of sheep, as well as about his fine Durhams, im- 
 proved swine, poultry, &c.] 

Mn. Editor : — At your request I will communicate to 
 you some facts in regard to my flock, which has obtain- 
 such a reputation throughout the United States, and has 
 more than realized my most sanguine hopes. When I 
 first engaged in the business of wool gi-owing, I soon 
 discovered that fine wool could be sold for more per 
 pound than coarse; also, that four pounds came to more 
 than two. The problem was how to get four pounds in 
 place of two, and keep up a fine silky fibre in order to 
 obtain the extra price. I thought the most reasonable 
 plan was to keep the best of my flock each j-ear, and 
 also to purchase the best sheep from flocks known to 
 contain the best and purest blood sheep to be found re- 
 gardless of cost. I soon learned by experience that lead- 
 ing wool gi-owers would not sell their best sheep unless 
 they obtained a fair price for them, preferring to sell 
 the refuse at reduced pi-ices ; and to get such as I want- 
 ed I had to pay for them. I am equally interested in 
 Spanish and French sheep, but prize the latter most, and 
 think they will take the lead among wool growers. My 
 sheep are very large, handsome in form, long and fine 
 quality of wool, fleece very compact and heavy ; many 
 of them have a very dark sui'face on the wool. I will 
 send you an engi-aving this fall or winter of one of my 
 Durham cattle. Respectfully, &c., J. S. GOE.

Plain Facts for Farmers. 

Mr. Editor : — The following plain facts are known to 
 every intelligent farmer in the land, and yet, strange to 
 say, even in Chester county, where we hold ourselves up 
 to the world as model farmers, one-half of us pay little 
 or no attention to them. Why it is that such a singular 
 indifference to our welfare should prevail so generally 
 among us I shall not pretend to explain, further than 
 that I myself habitually neglect attending to many of 
 these facts, though at the same time perfectly aware 
 that I am a daily loser to a considerable amount by this 
 very neglect. 

Perhaps it may stir up the negligent and indifferent 
 by giving place in the Farm Journal to these 

PLAIN FACTS FOR FARMERS. 

Feeding cattle and milch cows, particularly, should be 
 protected by stabling or otherwise from the cold and 
 storms of winter. The cows will give one-third more 
 milk from the same food, while your steers will consume 
 twenty per cent, less feed, and leave the barnyard in 
 better condition in the spring than if unprotected. 

Horses should be kept in warm but well ventilated 
 stables. Every horse should have his blanket on at 
 night ; an old piece of rag-carpet will answer a good 
 purpose when you are not disposed to incur the expense 
 of a regular horse-blanket. At any rate have a cover- 
 ing of some kind for your horse at night, and use the 
 curry comb freely by day, and with ordinary attention 
 to his other wants, you will have the services of a good 
 horse for twenty to twenty-five years instead of eight or 
 ten, as is generally the case. 

Make it an invariable rule to cut all your hay, straw 
 and fodder, before feeding it to your stock. Your cattle 
 will thrive better on less food, and you will save not less
