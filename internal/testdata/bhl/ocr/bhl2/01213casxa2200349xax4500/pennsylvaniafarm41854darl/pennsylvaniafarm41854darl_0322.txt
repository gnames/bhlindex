than twenty per cent, of your whole winter's consump- 
 tion. 

Devote every year one acre at least of your farm to 
 the cultivation of rootri as winter feed for your stock. 
 A good root crop "will pay" better for this purpose from 
 one acre than three times that quantity of land devoted 
 to grain or hay. 

Keep your poultry warm through the winter; and with 
 judicious feeding (every farmer knows how to feed his 
 his poultry if he would only take the trouble to do it,) 
 you can have about as many eggs during the Avinter as 
 at any other season of the year. 

Preserve carefully the droppings from your hen-roosts, 
 and by the mixture of a little plaster of Paris as j'ou 
 put them away in a dry place, you will have a manure 
 very little inferior to the best Peruvian guano, and at 
 one-tenth the cost. 

Never allow a stick of wood to be put on your fire, or 
 in the stove, that has not been cut and piled up under 
 your wood shed from three to six months before hand. 
 You will be sure of good fires with no greater consump- 
 tion of wood, and be spared the infliction of a "smoking 
 house and a scolding wife." 

Have a convenient tool-house on your premises where 
 every tool and implement must be returned immediately 
 after being used. Yoii will always know where to look 
 for your tools when you want one, and ordinary farm 
 implements will last nearly a lifetime. I have imple- 
 ments on my faimi that have been in constant use for 
 thirty-two years, and are in good condition yet. 

Keep a subsoil plow and use it, at least, every time 
 you break up your sod ground, and previous to putting 
 in your wheat crop. It will pay for itself in one season. 
 The subsoil plow should only be used in soils that have 
 been under-drained, or are naturally not wet. The best 
 subsoil plow, in my opinion, is Roger's pattern with one 
 handle. 

Cultivate no more land every year than you can ma- 
 nure thoroughly. Half a field well manured will pre- 
 duce more abundantly, and at less cost of labor, than a 
 whole field will that is only half manured.

 Our wheat in the lower end of the count}' was very 
 poor ; it was injured by the fly, and just before harvest 
 by the wheat midge ; many fields of fine looking grain 
 were scarcely worth cutting, except where the farmers 
 sowed Mediterranean, and where it was put in late it 
 was nearly good for nothing. The rye is good, except 
 the "buckwheat rye" — the midge destroyed it altogeth- 
 er. The oats was a good crop. Corn was very much 
 injured by the drouth — the late planting looks the best. 
 Wheat is worth $2 per bushel for bread, seed $2 25 to 
 $2 Zll; rye $1; oats firm at 40 cents, farmers holding 
 on for 50 cents on account of the unfavorable prospect 
 of the corn crop and the great use that viust be made of 
 it for bread this winter; corn selling at 75 cents. The 
 buckwheat looks as if it was a good deal injured — may 
 be half a crop. The potatoes for the same reason poor. 
 Our farmers are afraid to sow much wheat on account of 

the midge — will put in more rye. There wUl be very 
 little smooth wheat sown — Mediterranean is all the rage 
 and that to be sowed very early. Yours, in haste

Allen's Mowing Machine, 

Mr. Editor : — In compliance with your request, as 
 stated in the last two numbers of your Farm Journal, I \ 
 have to say that I used one of Allen's patent mowing 
 machines during the past harvest, mauufactui-ed by Lee, 
 Peirce & Thompson of this county, and its performance 
 exceeded my most sanguine expectations. No matter 
 what kind of grass, heavy or light, lodged or standing, 
 it will cut it better than it can be cut with the scythe. 
 I ti-ied it on some timothy stubble, which had been 
 topped for some length of time, and was very dead, and 
 it shore it off as clean as if it had been young timotht. 
 As to the number of acres it will cut in a day, I, with- 
 out any extra exertion, cut from eight to ten, and if it 
 were pushed a little it woiild go fifteen. There is no 
 side draft, and it is about as hard for the team as plow- 
 ing stubble ground. They are vei-y simple and strong 
 in their construction, there is nothing liable to get out of 
 order except the knife, and that very seldom ; with care 
 they last a number of years. I cut about sixty acres 
 with mine the past harvest, and it is very little worse of 
 the wear ; the knives may last several years yet with I 
 the same usage. 

As it was something new in this part of the country,*^ 
 there were hundreds come to see it perform, and all 
 seemed pleased with it, and found no fault whatever with 
 the machine or its work. Yours, ^:c.,

J. L. Darlington, — Sir: — I feel it a duty to you, as 
 editor of the only Farm Journal in our State, and to the 
 farming community, that the propagation of sound, un- 
 biassed information should be properly circulated through* 
 the columns of your excellent Journal. The reports 
 that flow through other journals, based upon the limited, 
 not to say often prejudicial minds, as regards the weather 
 and prospects of crops, the latter particularly, yours 
 should at least be standard source. 

Our season has been uncommonly dry and warm, pro- 
 ducing light crops. The spring, though unusually late, 
 was followed by genial weather, that clothed the grass 
 of the fields with hues of the deepest green, and hopes 
 were entertained of an unusual yield of grass ; indeed 
 we thought the h.arvest would teem with unbounded lux- 
 uriance and plenty. Alas ! the highest hopes then en- 
 tertained are sadly blasted and withered, like the parch- 
 ed fields and sunburnt meadows. There will not be half 
 an average crop. Were it proper, I would say there is 
 something truly sublime in the moral thus taught. How 
 often we suppose that to-morrow will be as to-day, that 
 the plenteous hand that last season filled our barns with 
 plenty will do so next, and much more abundantly. And 
 so on, forgetting that there is an over-ruling Providence 
 pervading and predisposing all things for his own glory
