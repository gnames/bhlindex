Domestic Fowls. 

We extract the following excellent remarks from the 
 Practical Farmer:— 

In eelecting eggs for incubation, care should be taken 
 that they are all laid nearly at the same time. Those that 
 have been laid 24 hours will be hatched some time before 
 older laid ones. It is always well to reject the eggs first 
 laid by young pullets; for if they do incubate, of which 
 there is often great risk, the chicks .are much more delicate, 
 and are longer in feathering than those from the eggs of 
 more matured fowls. 

The best mode of keeping eggs intended for hatching is 
 to place them in boxes filled with brnn, which should be 
 kept in a moderate temperature. The bran should not cov- 
 er them. In this manner eggs could be kept in boxes la- 
 belled with the date on which they have been laid. If 
 kept longer than two weeks, the chances of fertility in eggs 
 greatly diminished. 

If it is not designed that a hen should sit, the best and 
 most humane mode of divesting her of the inclination is to 
 place her in a dark coop, alone for two or three days. If 
 the weather is fine, place under a box in a grassy place; 
 but if stormy or wet, it is dangerous to do so. It is however, 
 necessary for the health of hens, that they should have 
 opportunity to produce one brood of chickens every year — 
 provided they are in the habit of often demonstrating the 
 inclination to sit. 

The sitting hen, after she has chosen her nest, which she 
 should, if possible be allowed to do, ought to be confined to 
 her adopted location for a few days, that other fowls may bo 
 out of her way. If this is not attended to, troubles ensue, 
 from which the eggs suffer. If another hen has been in the 
 habit of laying in the same nest, it is proper that the sitting 
 fowl should be confined until the other hen has chosen a new 
 laying place. At the same time, care should be taken to 
 allow her voluntary/ liberty, cat least twice a day, to feed and 
 to drink. The nearer the ground nests can be furnished the 
 better; provided other circumstances favor. Above all. let 
 cleanliness and reasonable ventilation bo secured — neither 
 of which are available, when the close boxing system is 
 adopted. If the nests could be with safety permitted to rest 
 on the ground, would be the best situation; for every poul- 
 try breeder knows, that the birds of the stolen nest are 
 hardest and best — and oftentimes they are hatched beneath 
 a fence, or in tlie stump of an old tree, exposed to rainsand 
 dews, but safe from them all, through the untiring vigilance 
 of the maternal Biddy.

Wheat vs. Cheat. 

Mr. Editor : — While citing the case of a whole field of 
 wheat turning to cheat, I was not aware that I was advan- 
 cing "an erroneous idea fraught with mischief," that would 
 occasion Mr. Sehreiner so much trouble "to 7-epel the evil ;" 
 I merely intended to produce facts as conclusive evidence 
 that there is an affinity between wheat and chess, alias 
 cheat; or rather that chess is nothing more nor less than 
 stinted, shrivelled or dwarfish wheat. 

If Mr. S. considers chess to be sui generis a distinct spe- 
 cies or variety of grain, we would like him to classify it and 
 tell us of its botanical traits. It is not a satisfactory way of 
 accounting for a whole field of chess, to conjecture that there 
 "mat/ have been a little chess among the seed wheat," for 
 "there is a little in many a fine crop ;" or that "an enemy 
 came by night and sowed it there," and another enemy came 
 and plucked up the wheat. We hope our opponent will not 
 expect to establish his hypothesis by substituting conjecture 
 for analogy. I did not intimate that "creative power is still 

emerging upon the earth," but accounted for the change of 
 wheat to cheat in the same way that wo account for diver- 
 sity in the human countenance or human form. 

"Like produces like," save when some extraneous influ- 
 ence or disturbing cause occasions a difierent feature, form 
 or complexion. By this remark I would not throw the blame 
 upon the laws of nature, nor attempt to prove that nature is 
 fallible. 

Mr. S. gravely asks "who has ever seen a single stock of 
 wheat turn to cheat ?" In reply I would say every person 
 who has seen a stalk of cheat-wheat has seen that which has 
 turned from wheat, which having been sowed and vegetated, 
 but the growth being choked by other plants, or impeded by 
 draught, or other disturbing cause, yielded naught but 
 cheat. 

We did not assert that no kind of grain turned into an- 
 ther kind, nor would we admit that such has ever been the 
 case. Wo intended to convey the idea that the good wheat 
 changed to a different condition or quality of the same kind. 
 I might add many instances where good wheat was sowed, 
 but upon harvesting a large portion was found to be cheat ; 
 and the case which Mr. S. gave from his own observation in 
 the June number of the Farm Journal, of "four large grains 
 of oats growing out of the side of a sheaf of loheat," is pre- 
 cisely analagous to the specimens produced by Prof. Mapes 
 of cheat and wheat growing on the same stalk. All are 
 familiar with the mixture that is often found on a single ear 
 of corn where several kinds are planted near together. This 
 shows that difl'erent kinds of grain will fructify and grow 
 together when the pollen of the one fertilizes the other, and 
 establishes the affinity that exists between the cereals. 

The fact that cheat is seldom found, except when growing 
 among wheat, proves it to be an offspring of wheat, else why 
 not find it as much among other grains. Not wishing to be 
 a competitor, I nevertheless await with interest the result of 
 the experiment being made for the wager of a farm offered 
 by Mr. S. 

The motto "clean seed upon clean soil, and a clean har- 
 vest will follow," may be relied upon, save when some dis- 
 turbing cause may change the natural tendency to mere 
 cheat. If Mr. S. is called upon to execute a deed for his 
 farm in accordance with his own proposition, he will then 
 see that there are other contingencies than those of clean 
 seed and soil. Truly yours, H. MILLER.

Shortening in Lima Beans and Squashes. 

The Granite Farmer stiitos that clipping the shoots of Lima 

beans when about six feet high, produces an abundant crop, 

the beans ripening in August. Squashes, the vines of 

which were nipped after two or three squashes had formed, 

were larger and ripened better. By cutting out the early 

bearing br.anches, a succession of squashes was obtain through 

the snmmer. Tomatoes which grew on an excessive rich 

piece of ground were benefited by shortening, new and more 

vigorous shoots successivly pushed out in place of those 

which were clipped.

Killing Fowls. 

Only turkeys and geese should be bled to death — the flesh 
 of the chicken becomes dry and insipid from loss of blood. 
 The best plan, says the Poultry Chronicle, is to take a blunt 
 stick, such as a child's bat or boy's wooden sword, and strike 
 the bird a smart blow on the back of the nock, about the third 
 joint from the head ; death follows in a moment

Plum Treks are generally benefitted by spreading a few 
 quarts of salt under the tree; and also by washing tho 
 trunk with weak lye.
