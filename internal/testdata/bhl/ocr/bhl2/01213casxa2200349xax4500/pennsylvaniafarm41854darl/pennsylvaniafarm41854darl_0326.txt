fOcTOSEli 

Temple to furnish through the Farm Journal a descrip- I 
 tion of his Milk House. Mr. Temple's family's health 
 ■will not permit a reply from him direct in time for your 
 next number, and he desired the undersigned to forward 
 to you such a description, as one unacquainted with the 
 business of dairying, but fully willing to do his best, 
 shall be able to do. 

The building is situated near the foot of a steep hill, 
 fronting the south, with but little shade near. The heat 
 of the sun's rays and the obstructions to currents of air 
 by the surrounding hills would seem to render the spot 
 most unsuitable for the purpose. The structure is of 
 stone; walls eighteen inches thick, one story high, and 
 ten feet wide by twenty feet long in the inside, with 
 the ceiling ten feet high ; it is provided with seven six- 
 light windows for ventilation, the bottoms of which are 
 seven feet from the floor, and are himg with glass shut- 
 ters inside, wire netting in the centre of the walls, and 
 outside shutters on the north and west sides. The ends 
 of the building face the north and south. On the east 
 and west sides of the building, inside, provision is made 
 for double rows of milk pans the entire length, and be- 
 tween them at the north end for the cream kettles. The 
 structure for these purposes is as follows : Around the 
 two sides and north end, solid stone masonry is carried 
 up to a suitable height and width to form the troughs 
 upon, say two feet high for the milk pans and one foot 
 for the cream cans, and of such width as will accommo- 
 date two rows of pans inside of the raised rims; these 
 rims ai*e constructed of brick, on the sides next the 
 walls of the building the thickness of a brick, on the 
 fronts next the floor the width of a brick, the height of 
 these rims are six inches. The troughs thus constructed 
 are covered entirely on the inside and tops with a coating 
 formed of two parts of Roman cement and one part of 
 fine washed sand, laid on about the consistence of thick 
 cream with the greatest possible expedition, and sprink- 
 led during the operation with water by an assistant to 
 prevent it hardening before it can be properly adjusted. 
 The bottoms of these troughs have a descending grade 
 of one inch in twenty feet; of course the south end of 
 the right hand trough, as you enter fi-om the south, is 
 two inches higher than the south end of the left hand 
 trough, where the whole of the water from both is dis- 
 charged, passing through the cream trough between 
 tkese from the right hand trough to that on the left. 
 The cream trough between the north ends of the milk 
 ti'oughs, as has been said, has its bottom eighteen inches 
 below the rim and is made water tight, as the others, 
 with a separate emptying pipe for the discharge of such 
 •water as is below the level of the milk troughs, and all 
 such as may be wanted for washing the floors and other 
 uses about the building. Into the cream trough all the 
 water is received from the pump, (in a well immediately 
 opposite to it outside of the north wall, well protected 
 from the weather, &c.,) for the use of the milk troughs, 
 which are made to be filled as well as emptied through 
 U. Mr. Temple has never found it necessary to change 
 the water more frequently than morning and evening ; 
 even during the warm days of my visit with the temper- 
 ature at 85°, once in twenty-four hours was found to be 
 isufficient. In the warmest weather of summer (as well 
 as at all other times) sour milk, say a large spoonful to 

each pan of new milk, is required to produce the neces- 
 sary acidity to separate and throw up the cream, as in 
 the best spring houses. When the hot weather abates, 
 the water is entirely withdrawn from the troughs. 'La- 
 ter, the pans of milk are raised to a level with the top 
 of the rims, and when the cold increases the room la 
 heated with a stove to maintain the desired tempera- 
 ture. 

The entrance to the milk house is in the so\ith end, 
 over and around which a frame building extends of like 
 dimensions with the milk house, some fifteen feet south- 
 ward, wliere cliurning, washing pans, drying all the im- 
 plements, and other necessary operations, are perform- 
 ed. 

Mr. Temple has used this milk house six years, after 
 long experience with a good spring, and much prefers 
 the former. The quality of his butter is such as to 
 command the highest price in the Philadelphia market, 
 and no difference has been found in the quantity. It 
 may be proper to say that fresh water from tlie well is 
 required much more frequently in the cream trough than 
 in the milk troughs ; plugs in the rims on each side be- 
 tween them admit this when desired. The pump is an 
 iron patent pump, but nothing objectionable has been 
 noticed on that account. 

In the building in front of the milk room are the ne- 
 cessary fixtures for carrying on the operations, amongst 
 which is a large trough to receive the waste water from 
 the milk troughs ; through the cream trough is received 
 the water for cleansing, &c., inside the milk house, from 
 the floor of which a pipe leads away the water under the 
 front building. AVith the above rather awkward descrip- 
 tion, it may be said that Mr Temple resides on Chester 
 creek, about three and a half miles from Chester, where 
 he would receive with pleasure any one desirous of in- 
 formation on this subject. The milk house was calciila- 
 ted to accommodj^te a dairy of 16 cows, and is found to 
 be of suitable size. Respectfully yours, &c., J. E. 

Koo Sung. 

In answer to a letter of inquiry as to the manner of 
 of growing "IIoo Sung," Mr. J. B. Garber states that 
 its cultivation is the same as any other lettuce. It is 
 sowed in beds of rich garden soil in the spring, or at 
 any time diiring the summer for a successive crop. If 
 the plants grow very vigorous it will much improve its 
 size and quality, rendering the plants larger, more ten- 
 der and consequently more delicious, and to still further 
 improve, it would be well to thin out the plants when 
 small to about two or three inches apart each way, and 
 the thinnings can be used as ordinary lettuce. The soil 
 cannot be too rich.

In a letter received September 9 from Mr. Garber, we 
 are informed that since our first publication he has had 
 applications from Maine to Georgia, and that his stock 
 is nearly exhavisted, two dozen small packages alone re- 
 maining. jMr. G.'s public spirit and desire to dissemi- 
 nate what he considers a valuable acquisition to our 
 stock of vegetables has caused him no little trouble, but 
 doubtless like other good acts it wiU bring its own re- 
 ward.
