Com and Potatoes at the West. 

We learn from our Western exchanges that the corn 
 crop in the West and South is better than was recently 
 supposed. 

In the western portion of Ohio, including the Miami 
 and Scioto bottoms, and all the northwestern part of the 
 State, the corn crop promises well and will j'ield an ave- 
 rage ci'op. In the northern portion of Indiana and Illi- 
 nois, the crop is also good, and the same remarks will 
 apply to Michigan, Iowa, Minnesota, and the northci-n 
 part of Missouri. From the Southern States the advi- 
 ces are very encouraging, so that taking the whole West 
 together, there is no cause for alarm, nor is there much 
 safety in speculations based upon a failure of the corn 
 crop. We hear of no place, however, where the potato 
 crop is good, or even middling. 

In Central Missouri, Illinois and Indiana, and in South 
 Kentucky, and the northwest part of Tennesee, north- 
 en stei-n portion of Ohio, and Western Pennsylvania, 
 there is no doubt that the drought liae proved very dis- 
 astrous to corn and potatoes, and in these sections there 
 will be a scarcity. 

Virginia State Agricultural Society. 

The second annual exhibition of this Society will be 
 held at Richmond, commencing October 30th and con- 
 tinuing till Frid.ay November 3d, at 10 o'clock of which 
 day the reports of the Judges will be read from the 
 stand, and a valedictory address delivered by B. Johnson 
 Barbour, Esq. 

Exhibitors must have their ai'ticles and animals regis- 
 tered on or before Monday, October 30th. 

The regular annual address will be delivered by the 
 Hon. Wm. B. Preston, at 11 o'clock on Wednesday, No- 
 vember 1st. 

The schedule of premiums embraces a wide range, 
 and is of the most liberal character, containing several 
 premiums of $50 and $100 each, many of which are for 
 essays on subjects of interest to the farmer, such as 
 draining, rotation of crops, guano, hay making, diseases 
 of crops, &c., also on corn culture, wheat, tobacco rais- 
 ing, poultry, &c. These will no doubt elicit and circu- 
 late much valuable information. 

Alleghany County Agricultural Society. 

The Alleghany County Agricultural Society will hold 
 its fifth annual fair at Pittsburg on the 3d, 4th, 5th and 
 6th days of October. We have received a pamphlet, 
 containing an extensive premium list, with minute direc- 
 tions to exhibitors, instructions to Judges, and rules for 
 their decision. There is also to be a sale of stock, and 
 an address delivered by Hon. A. U. Loomis. 

The committees are not confined to that county, but 
 selected from various parts of the State. 

The premium list is so comprehensive, as well as lib- 
 eral, in the amounts to be .awarded, that it looks as if 
 intended to rival the State Exhibition at Philadelphia. 
 This is all right, as the mountain barrier and distance 
 necessarily prevents contributions from either extreme 
 point to much extent. The absence of the State fair 
 from any one locality ought not to have the effect of dis- 
 couraging efforts at home and in the county societies. 
 On these must devolve very much the task of stirring up 

and keeping stirred up the spirit of improvement among 
 the farmers of their own district. 

The Alleghany County Society offers quite a list of 
 premiums to lady equestrians for the best and most 
 graceful riding and driving. The highest premium for 
 this accomplishment is $200. The officers of the Alle- 
 ghany County Society are : 

President — William Martin, Sr. 

Vice President— P. A. Way. 

Recording Secretary and Treasurer — A. B. M'Quewan. 

Corresponding Secretary — Jas. S. Negley. 

Executive Committee — John Young, Chairman, Benj. 
 Kelly, Robert M'Knight, John 8. Hall, John Murdoch, 
 Jr., Alex. Speer, (City.) J. E. M'Cabe, Mansfield B. 
 Brown, J. M. K. Snodgrass, James Kennedy, G. W. G. 
 Payne, John M'Kelvy, J. A. Guy, Henry Ingram. 

Honor to the Farmer's Wife. 

A. G. Comings, of Mason, New Hampshire, writing to 
 the New England Farmer, gives'the following adenda to 
 the "Thrifty and Thrifless Farmer," which we had the 
 honor of introducing to the world last Januarj', since 
 copied into nearly every paper in .Vaierica. He says ; — 

We have had some interesting articles from the pen of 
 the editor upon Farmer Thrifty and Farmer T/iriftlesf. 
 These have had a very favorable reception in all quar- 
 ters, and "have gone the rounds" among the scissored 
 fraternity, very much to their honoiv 

It is never desirable to cripple a fast sailing ship, nor 
 do anything of the kind ; but I cannot help cherishing 
 an inclination to try, at least, to take some of the wind 
 out of those sails, and turn it in a different direction. 
 Having been favored with a view of the inside of "River 
 Cottage," some time since, I am entirely removed from 
 any feeling of danger, if I shall venture to suggest to 
 my esteemed friend,' the editor, th.^t Farmer Tlirifty's 
 ivife was justly entitled to a very large share of the hon- 
 or which has been given to Jiim.. 

A thrifty old bachelor farmer is a most unnatiu-al, un- 
 usual and impossible idea. Mercantile money-worship- 
 ers, commercial adventurers, an'l political fire-eaters, 
 can be made out of those unsocial things called old 
 bachelors. But that first of all employments, and great- 
 est of all, agriculture, requires a being of sense enough 
 to know that he is a man, and to know that no man hon- 
 ors his manhood who is willing to live alone in this world, 
 that is, without a wife. The natural design and first 
 proper use of a farm is as a home. What a home that 
 would be where woman should have.no place ! Call for 
 Robinson Crusoe, and let him sing of i,ts "charms !" 

In an old bachelor's garden, flowers could not bloom 
 for any good cause. Fruits could not ripen, except the 
 sour crab apple. He wh9 woi\ld not have a wife .'rad 
 children about him could' never care for cattle, horses, 
 sheep, hogs or hens, except with the sahie hoggish care 
 that gru liter has for his provender. It is a settled ques- 
 tion. No man can be a f:\rmer who is so much a brute 
 as not to be a social being. But this is all out-door 
 talk. We must go into the hoiise, and take a look at 
 things there, if we w.aut to understand why Farmer 
 Tlirifty is alwaj's so thrifty and so cheerful. 

The chances of thrift in t\u< world, without a wife, are 
 hardly one to a thousand. The chances with a wife
