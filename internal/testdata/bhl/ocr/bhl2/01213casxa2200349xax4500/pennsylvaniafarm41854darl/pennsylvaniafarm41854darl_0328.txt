THE FARM JOURNAL.

may be reckoned about by square numbers ; as, in 
 some communities, about one in four; in others about one 
 in nine; and in othei's not more than one in sixteen, or 
 perhaps one in twenty-five. We reckon in this way. The 
 faculty to accumulate, and the ability or faculty to save, 
 are two distinct faculties; which have their application 
 both out of doors and in the house. Without two inter- 
 ested persons, to direct or use these faculties and inter- 
 ests, one in the house and one outside, there is scarce a 
 possibility of success. In the most intelligent and well 
 trained communities, of either men or women, not more 
 than one out of two are capable of managing their part 
 successfully. The probability for the success of the 
 couple will be a square of the chances. The chances 
 are two for the man, out of which to bring one ; and in 
 the same manner for the woman. Or, more correctly I 
 should say, the chances of each are as one-half ; which, 
 squared, leaves one-fourth, or one in four. Where not 
 more than one in three for each, their united chance 
 would be one in nine, and so on. 

The faculty in the exercise of which the man is to ex- 
 cel, is an ability to earn or accumulate ; while the fa- 
 culty necessai-y for the woman is an ability to preserve, 
 to keep, to economize. 

Now if, as poor Richard says, "A penny saved is as 
 good as two pence earned," then Farmer Thrifty is not 
 entitled to all the credit of the success which has at- 
 tended him. 

The amount which can be laid up, yearly, after meet- 
 ing all expenses, is but a small per centage of the stock 
 employed. If the farmer pays interest on his farm, and 
 the farm is worth no move than the sum upon which he 
 pays interest, then he has properly nothing invested ex- 
 cept his labor. If his own labor -would be worth four 
 hundred dollars, and the economical support of his fam- 
 ily would cost him four hundred, the management in the 
 house will decide whether he shall have any profit on 
 this four hundred dollars. If, with the most economical 
 and careful management of his affairs in the house, he 
 could lay up six per cent, profit on the worth of his la- 
 bor, it would be only twenty-four dollai-s per year. If 
 he could lay up twelve and a half per cent., it would 
 only amount to fifty dollars in a year. 

Some women are always very careful not to encroach 
 upon the time of their husbands. Their meals are al- 
 ■ways ready at the time which will favor the out-door 
 ■work. If they must call for the assistance of "the 
 boys," or the farmer, or for the use of "the horse," it is 
 cafl^^Uy planned so as to cost as little hindrance as 
 possible. They study economy in the use of fuel, 
 whether it is obtained from the farm or not ; and every 
 article of clothing, or of provisions. Everything is put 
 away in the best order for preservation, or in the proper 
 place for convenience. Then they gi-eatly increase the 
 strength and activity of the farmer, by the cheerful 
 manner and spirit, and the constancy of life, with which 
 they seek to promote his wishes. 

The fact is, the wife of Farmer Thrifty makes butter 
 and cheese, when she makes any, which will add twenty- 
 five per cent, to the butter which Farmer Thriftless car- 
 ries to market. Her boys and girls will be kept in as 
 good order nearly twice as long, with the same clothing 
 and shoes, as those of Farmer Thriftless. Crockery, 

glass, china ware, &c., can be used upon her table much 
 longer, by reason of a ready care. Farmer Thrifty's 
 wife is a cheerful woman, and people like to visit at her 
 house. This costs something ; but good cheer does so 
 ease the burden of life, that, after all, it is no tax, if not 
 carried to excess. 

Now all I have to say about the matter, further, is, 
 that there is no such man as Thi-ifty in the list of far- 
 mers or mechanics, whose wife is not entitled to as bright 
 a feather in her cap as her husband can wear. 

I have no fear that any of the women will get angry 
 with me for what I have said, for none of them read the 
 papers, only the wives of the Thrifties. 

Chester County Exhibitions 

The annual exhibitions of the Chester Count}' Agri- 
 cultural and Horticultural Societies took place on the 
 7th, 8th and 9th insts., being the first in the State of our 
 fall exhibitions, and the only ones occurring previous to 
 going to press with our October number. 

The borough of West Chester was enlivened as usual 
 during three days with double its usual populaiion, 
 showing no lack of interest, and making reasonable al- 
 lowances for the dry season, the display of stock and 
 productions of the soil, except fruit, exceeded expecta- 
 tions. More horses were exhibited than last season, and 
 some very fine ones, including some of the Morgan and 
 also Norman stock. Durhams, Devons, Aldernies and 
 Holsteins were on the ground in considerable numbers, 
 though not quite so many as last year, nor in as good 
 condition. One exhibitor, A. Bolmar, exhibited twenty- 
 six head, including two bulls. One of the latter re- 
 ceived the first premium as the best Durham bull. Geo. 
 Brinton, Jr., John and Paschall AVorth, Francis and 
 Marshall Strode, Gerard Cope, and Richard Pim, were 
 the principal other contributors of neat cattle. 

Joseph Cope and John Worth exhibited some of theii- 
 superior Southdown ewes, which attracted much atten- 
 tion. We observed no Bakewells or Cotswolds. The 
 swine were chiefly of the Chester county breed. Vege- 
 tables were not very numerous, but very excellent in 
 quality. We have never seen finer sweet and white po- 
 tatoes, or much finer egg plants. Samples of wheat and 
 corn were also very superior. The dairy productions 
 were not so abundant as they should have been ; our 
 friends Job Hayes and wife carried the premiums for 
 their butter and cheese. A large and excellent display 
 of agricultural implements was made by S. & M. Pen- 
 nock & Co., including their improved wheat drills, corn 
 shellers and iron plows. Lewis Cooper, of Lancaster 
 county, exhibited his lime spreader, guano spreader and 
 combined machines for both lime and guano. A capital 
 butter mould was exhibited by the Messrs. Dickey, of 
 Chester county, and used by them in their extensive 
 dairies. It saves labor, and makes a square print much 
 more convenient tor packing for market, A sample gate 
 was erected oa the ground by our energetic and public 
 spirited friend Townsend Sharpless, of Philadelphia, to 
 show a very simple and complete mode of hanging and 
 fastening. The gate is made to shut itself, simply by a 
 strong chain a few feet in length, one end of which is 
 fastened by a staple in the lower part of the heel of the 
 gate and the other near the top of the gate post. It is
