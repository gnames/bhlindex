and its fruit are iujured. We cannot, therefore,, vecoramend 
 for imitation tlio practice in some places to strip the colza 
 leaves for food for cattle, or even men. If tbis is the ob- 
 ject of the crop, it would be much better to raise green 
 cabbage and some other varieties which have more leaves 
 than the colza, and from which those leaves can be butter 
 spared, because they are all consumed before runninpj to seed. 

A variety of colza — spring colza — is sown in the month 
 of May, either broadcast or in furrows, or to bo transplanted. 

Like all annuals in the same category, it yields fewer and 
 smaller seed. It ought not, therefore, to be raised when it 
 can be avoided. 

It is manifest from what has been said that the cultiva- 
 tion of colza is a substantial benefit in di.striuts where yet 
 prevails the disastrous fashion of leaving ground iu fallow; 
 for it is planted after the wheat crops of one year, and 
 gathered before the seeding of the next. It ought to enter, 
 then into the rotation of all rich and moist lands. The 
 hoeings which are necessary in this crop clear the ground 
 of weeds and prepare it for the next j'oar's crop. But, as 
 like all plant:^ that furnish oil, it is vcvy exhausting to the 
 land, it should not come in turn till after a period of five or 
 six years at least. 

One principal advantage of introducing colza into the ro- 
 tation of crops is, that by planting it immediately after the 
 wheat is cut otF, the ground is thus used before it has 
 become dried, and also at a season when, for the most part, 
 it would otherwise be bearing nothing.

If any of our readers can give us information as to the

How nitich. Pork will a Bushel of Corn Make. 

Lender this head B. J. Harvey makes some sensible obser- 
 vatioDS in the Michigan Farmer; which, although better cal- 
 culated for Michigan than Pennsylvania, may bo read with 
 profit by some of our farmers. He says: 

Perhap? there is no class of people in the world, who work 
 go much without system, and labor so much at random — none 
 that know so little about their expenses and their incomes — 
 none that make use of arithmetic so little, as those who till 
 the soil for a .subsistence. There is certainly a want of a 
 due exercise of the organ of calculation among this class. 
 The farmer plows, sows and cultivates his crops — harvests, 
 threshes and makes sale of them, or feeds them to his stock, 
 — but how rarely does ho keep an accurate account of the 
 ojitire cost of production, so as to know whether he gains 
 OT loses by the operation. 

I have been led to make this communication from see- 
 ing the question asked, at the head of this article — "how 
 much pork will a bushel of corn make" — in one instance 
 the answer is 15 pounds. This result was obtained, as in 
 some similar ones, from first weighing partly grown hogs, 
 and then feeding for a time, and then again weighing: when 
 the only true way to ascertain the actual cost of making a 
 pound of pork, would be to take into account the entire 
 amount of food consumed from the time the .animal corumeu- 
 eos to eat, up to the time of slaughtering. I have not insti- 
 tuted any perfectly accurate experiments, but sulBcient to 
 induce me tf) believe that reckouiug as above, an ordinary 
 hog will consume on an average five pounds per day or 
 aJiout thirty bushels in one year. Now it is an extra good 
 hog that will weigh 365 pounds at that age; but this estimate 
 gives only about eleven pounds of pork, 'o Uio liushel of corn 
 cojisumed. The average price of corn for this State, may 
 be estimated at 50 cents per bushel, which ui.ikes the cost of 

production §4. 11 per hundred. But the actual average of 
 hogs at one year old dues not exceed 250 pounds per head, 
 or less than eight pounds to the bushel of corn; or at an 
 actual cost of six dollars per hundred to the producer, when 
 fed whollj' on corn. 

Now it will bo seen that if the above estimate is anything 
 like an approximation to the truth, pork cannot be profitably 
 raised in Michigan from corn alone. And I have no doul>t 
 that if this question were put to every farmer in the State, it 
 would be answered by nine tenths of them in the negative. 
 Yet the most of our pork is made almost wholly from corn. 
 Why is it persevered in from ye.ar to year? Will not the an- 
 swer be found in the first paragraph of this communication. 

I do not mean to say that pork cannot be profitably grown 
 at all. No doubt with the right kind of food and manage- 
 ment, it may be made at a cost of three or four dollars per 
 hundred. Boiled potatoes and pumpkins, mixed with a por- 
 tion of corn meal, will make hogs thrive faster than corn 
 alone — changing the kind of food often is advantageous. 
 Hogs will do well in summer in good clover pasture, with 
 little else. Try it, you who are in the habit of keeping your 
 hogs in the highway. Apples are good. 

In conclusion I will say farmers, if you have nothing but 
 corn and the highway, to make pork of, take your corn on 
 the highway to market, and buy your pork. 

Goal Ashes. 
 A writer in the Practical Farmer gives his experience in 
 the use of coal ashes. He says, I have now abed of carrots, 
 about two hundred feet long, and ten wide, in drills. The 
 seed was sown unusually late, and I did not expect much of 
 a crop. I had about a cartload of coal ashes — the result of 
 the cooking stove — which had not been mixed in the manure 
 he.ap; and not having any other use for them, I had them 
 spread on one end of this piece of ground which I sowed 
 with carrots. The ashes spread over about a third of the 
 bed, and the carrots, where the ashes were spread, are more 
 than twice as large as the other portions of the patch; — the 
 stalks are much greener, and also double the size of the 
 others. — The whole piece was manured very lightly, as the 
 manure yard was empty at the time. 

How to get rid of Rats. 

Prof. Bascom, of Oberlin, in a letter to the Ohio Farmer, 
 says: 

"Would it not be well to call the attention of your readers 
 to the ease and certainty with which they may be relieved 
 from the annoyance of the large brown rat. This impudent 
 intruder often visits my labratory and other premises. As 
 tJiey come singly, I take off' each, the night after I discover 
 signs of his presence, in this wise: I take half a tea spoonful 
 of dry flour or Indian meal on a plate or piece of board, and 
 sprinkle over it the fraction of a grain of strichnine. Tliis 
 is set in a convenient place, and I invariably find the culprit 
 near the spot dead in the morning. Th.> peculiar advantage 
 of this poison is, it produces muscular spasm.-?, which pre- 
 vent the animal from reaching his hole to die and decom- 
 pose. It is needless to add that such a violent poison should 
 be used with care. 

Clover. 
 M'hen clover was first introduced into llermnny to fill up 
 the year of naked fallow, in the triennial course of cropping, 
 its effects appeared so extraordinary, that it was pronounced 
 to be the limit of the art of culture. It gave fodder for cattle 
 during the formerly naked year, it gave u bettor crop in the 
 following year, and it was supposed to choke the weeds 
 which infested the fields ol grain. — Vuii Thuer.
