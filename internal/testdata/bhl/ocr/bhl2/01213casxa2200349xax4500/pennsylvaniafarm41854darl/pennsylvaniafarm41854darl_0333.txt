most desirable trees for shade or ornament. A very 
 large proportion of trees die for want of care in planting 
 and want of care afterwards. Fine fruit and fine shade 
 are both objects worth having, and those who do not 
 think so we would advise not to plant. 

In this utilitarian, money-making age, hundreds of 
 persons will plant simply as an operation in the money 

market, and because it increases the value of their pro- 
 perty to surround it with ornamental trees and hand- 
 some suruDoery. Others more patriotic and mindful of 
 posterity will do it from better motives, but whatever the 
 stimulus may be, all we have to say is plant, plant, plant 
 and plant well. If you do not reap the reward others 
 may. 

DEVON STEER. 

We have had the above engraving taken for the Farm 
 Journal as an illustration, of a pure North Devon steer, 
 to show some of the points for which this valuable breed 
 can be so highly recommended. It is described in Col- 
 mau's agricultural tour as a correct portrait of a fat 
 steer, which took the first px-ize and silver medal at one 
 of the Smithfield cattle shows. 

Of late years the Durhams from their larger size and 
 more showy appearance, with the enormous prices they 
 have readilj' commanded, have to some extent thrown all 
 other breeds into the shade. We believe it is as desira- 
 ble here as in England not to have one breed for all 
 situations and localities, but to select such as are adapt- 
 ed for the particular circumstances of each district or 
 section. Durhams and Bakewells are not at all suited 
 to the chalky hills of Devonshire, or to thin soils, rough 
 treatment and severe exposures anywhere. A South- 
 down would thrive where a Bakewell would starve. 
 Devon cattle have their peculiar excellencies for which 
 they are unsurpassed, and no one breed can be found 
 combining every good quality which may be wanted. 
 They lack size, and, so far as we have known them, are 
 not extraordinary milkers. We have known, however, 
 part bred Devons to come well up in this respect, and in 
 this section they probably comprise the larger part of 
 our most productive djiirics. One of our friends, who 
 had a fancy for an entire dairy of all red cows, informs 
 us that his thirty cows averaged him for six months 1\

pounds of butter per week. They were a beautiful lot, 
 all of them more or less crossed with Devon blood, and 
 for six years there was not the least sickness of any kind 
 among them. 

Tlie Devons are a distinct breed, having in the district 
 in England, where tliey are found in the greatest perfec- 
 tion, their distinct characteristics from the earliest re- 
 cords. Within the last thirty years some improvement 
 has been made in their size as well as aptitude to fatten, 
 but in other respects they are essentially the same as 
 they have always been. The points of Devon cattle will 
 be found fully described in our 3d volume, page 34. 

The Devons when pure are invariably of a red color, 
 with a fine, mellow, elastic skin, indicating in every 
 breed fine feeding qualities. The nose is always light 
 colored, and around the mild eye there is a peculiar 
 bright orange colored ring. These are marks of impor- 
 tance. 

Altliough smaller than the Durhams and some other 
 breeds, they yet have a great disposition to fatten, and 
 their meat is of the finest quality and beautifully mar- 
 bled. It is as oxen, however, that they are altogether 
 unrivalled. Youatt says of them, that they are often 
 trotted along in their native district with empty wagons 
 at the rate of six miles an hour, and that four good 
 Devon oxen will do as much work in the field or on the 
 road as three horses, and in as quick and often quicker 
 time. They are usually taken into work at two years
