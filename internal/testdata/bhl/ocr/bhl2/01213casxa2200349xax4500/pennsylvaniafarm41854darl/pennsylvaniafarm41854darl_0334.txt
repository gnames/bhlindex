The form of the Devon ox indicates the truv """■ *"'^r a 
 working animal, combining strength with comparative 
 speech The legs are longer than in the Durham, and 
 the bone small below the fore arm, which is lar.ge and 
 powerful. The back is generally straight from the with- 
 ers to the setting on of the tail, and the hind quarters 
 from the hip to the point of the rump are long and well 
 filled up, a point of importance both for grazing and 
 working. 

The whole appearance of the Devon is that of a clean, 
 neat, well made animal, fine in the bone and free from 
 any coarseness. Mr. Patterson, of Maryland, and C. P. 
 Holcomb, of Delaware, have both imported Devons from 
 England, and are the principal breeders of this stock we 
 are acquainted with in the United States.

The Melon Apple. — The Horticulturist pronounces 
 this the "finest of American apples." It was first 
 brought to notice by Ellwanger & Barry in 184-5. The 
 Horticulturist continues : — 

"It has been disseminated to some extent by tl>e 
 nurseries ; but the tree being a delicate grower ren- 
 ders it somewhat diflScult of propagation, and the stock 
 has consequently been very limited. The best way to 
 obtain good standard trees for orchards within a reason- 
 able time is to top-graft it on strong growers, siich as 
 the Northern Spy or Baldwin. The fruit, we think, has 
 no superior, if an equal. It is tender and juicy as a 
 peach, with an agreeable and peculiar perfume, which 
 suggests the name of Watermelon originally. AVe once 
 carried some specimens with us to Europe, and present- 
 ed a few to Mr. Rivers, who pronounced it the most ten- 
 der and delicious apple he ever tasted. 

"Size — large, three to three and a half inches broad 
 and three inches deep. Form — round, slightly flattened 
 on the ends. Stalk — about an inch long, rather slender, 
 and inserted in a pretty deep, regular cavity, covered 
 with russet. Calyx — closed, large, in a large, deep ba- 
 sin. Skin — smooth generally, but often rendered rough 
 to t)ie touch by a tracing of russet, pale whitish-yellow 
 in the shade, nearly covered with light red, and fre- 
 quently with bright vermillion stripes. Flesh — white, 
 remarkably tender, with abundance of juice, very mild 
 sub-acid, with a sort of melon flavor. Season— Novem- 
 ber to March in Western New York. Tree — erect when 
 young, spreading as it grows older, but still compact 
 and regular. Shoots — slender, olive-colored, with nu- 
 merous russet specks. Leaves — large, folded, serate, 
 smooth and shining above and wooly uuderneath. It 
 grows well on the Paradise stock, and makes a hand- 
 some, prolific bush, for small gardens."
