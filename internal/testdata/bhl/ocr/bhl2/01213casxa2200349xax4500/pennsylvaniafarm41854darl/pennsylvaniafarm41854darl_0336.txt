THE FARM JOURNAL, 

[October 

County Societies. 
 We hope our different county societies through their 
 officers, or other interested persons, will forward us an 
 abstract of their different exhibitions the present fall for 
 publication. We are desirous to preserve in the Farm 
 Journal a record of these annual festivals in different 
 parts of the State for future reference, and as matters of 
 history. In this way only shall we keep advised of the 
 progress of agricultural improvement and enterprise. 

NEW IRON PLOW. 

The above cut represents a new iron plow, manufac- 
 tured by Hall & Spear, Pittsburg, Pa. It is very sim- 
 ple in its construction, and is pronounced by those who 
 have tried it to be a most excellent plow. 

Female Compositors. 

A few weeks ago we intimated a determination to em- 
 ploy female assistants in the composition, folding, and 
 packing departments of this office. Before the number 
 containing this announcement had time to reach our most 
 distant subsci'ibers, we had .two young ladies engaged, 
 whose first efforts to gain a knowledge of the art of 
 printing were commenced upon the present number. 
 The progress one of them has made will be observed by 
 every practiced eye, in the regularity and exactness of 
 this article, which will be "set" by her hands. The 
 other, at the time we are writing, has just been intro- 
 duced to the "case," or we would also give an example 
 of her progress. 

Although sufficient time has not elapsed for our new 
 compositors to tell whether they will like the business, 
 we are satisfied the experiment will prove successful, 
 and that there will be no want of applicants for the sit- 
 uation, as we have already had more than a score of 
 offers since those we have were engaged. 

Lawrencs County Agricultural and Horticultural Exhi- 
 bition. 

The third annual exhibition of the above Society will 
 be held .at New Castle, Pa., October 5th, Gth and 7th. 
 A liberal premium list is published, embracing a wide 
 range of useful objects. We are pleased that the Farm 
 Journal is offered among other premiums, not solely be- 
 cause we are interested in it, but because we know of no 
 one way in which improvement in agriculture may be so 
 well promoted as the circulation of agricultural papers. 

Sale of Durham Stock, Maltese Jacks, Southdowns, &c. 

AVe call the attention of our readers, particularly in 
 Western and Central Pennsylvania, to an extensive sale 
 of high bred stock in our advertising columns by Seth 
 A. Bushnell, Trumbull county, Ohio, immedi.ately over 
 tho line. This is an excellent opportunity to secure some 

of the best blood in the country. The animals have 
 been bred with great care, the father of the present 
 owner, Andrew Bushnell, having been for twenty-five 
 years the most prominent breeder of blooded stock in 
 that section. Ilubliack cost $800. We hope the far- 
 mers there will avail themselves of so good an opportu- 
 nity. 

J. Thome's Improved Stock. 

The editor of the American Agriculturist has been 
 paying a visit to the farm and stock of J. Thorne, 
 Dutchess county, New York, and gives in his paper the 
 following very interesting details of the different ani- 
 mals, all high bred and probably not surpassed by those 
 of any other person on a single farm in this country. 
 Such men are public benefactors on the largest scale and 
 in truest sense, and will be remembered and their useful 
 influences felt long after the names of the mere politi- 
 cians of the day are forgotten. The account goes on 
 thus : 

Short-Horn Cf(«Ze.— Of these Mr. Thorne hasalnr.sjo herd. 
 Ho began their importation several years since. The most 
 renowned of these, however, were selected for him last sum- 
 mer by Mr. F. M. Rotch, of Otsego, who went out to En.sliind, 
 with a son of Mr. T., for this express purpose. Mr. R. was 
 well-prepared to execute tho coniinissiun before stiirtiiisc, by 
 a previous careful study of animal anatomy and physiology, 
 and considerable practical kowledge at the sMie time, of 
 breeding. 

Of the animals selected by Mr. Rotch, Grand DnJce (10, 
 284,) stands at the head of the list. His color is a deep, rich 
 red, interspersed with a few small spots of white in the low- 
 er part of his body. He was calved February, 1848, and 
 bred by the late Mr. Thomas Bates, of Yorkshire, England. 
 He is by 2d Clevolaud Lad (.3,408,) dam Duchess 56th, by 
 4th, Duke of Northumbeland (3,049.) With the exception 
 of Duke of Northumberland (1, 940,) whom we saw in Mr. 
 Bate's yard in 1841, he strikes us as being the best Short- 
 horn bull within our recollection; and we do not know liut 
 take him all in all, he is fully his equal. It is impossible for 
 us to say at this distance of time, and without being able to 
 compare the two together. 

His head, and the set of it, eyes, horns, neck, shoulders and 
 arms, are particularly fine; the fore-ribs and crop as well 
 rounded and full as the best of Devons: he is level on the 
 back, has good width of loin, long quarters, deep, full twist 
 small tail, fine legs, soft furry hair, rich cream-colored skin, 
 and mellow handling. He is of large size, imposing pres- 
 ence, .and majestic carriage. What more one can desire in 
 a bull, we are at aloss to ii:rngine, and shall not exlniust a 
 diction.ary of adjectives — American fashion — in undertaking 
 to define. 

The price paid for Grand Duke in England was 1000 
 guineas — $5, 000. To this, add the risk and expense of 
 getting him to the United States, and then every ounce of 
 his blood will have cost a round sum. 

Of the females, LallaJi Jiookh in her present form is upon 
 the whole, perhaps tho most perfect in Mr. Thome's herd; 
 altough she does not quite equal Duchess filth in the width 
 of her brisket and manner of standing on her fore legs, nor 
 is she hardly so full in her quarter; but then we must re- 
 collect she is not so old as the Duchess, and may yet equal 
 her in these points. The reader, however, must not mis- 
 understand such criticisms; for it is like trying to point out a 
 flaw in the statues of a Power, or a Crawford. L.allah Rookh 
 is as near perfection as an animal probably ever attained. 
 We need not particularize her fine head, eyes horns. <tc. 

She was calved December, 1851. Her color is a rich red 
 Bred by Mr. Townley, of Townley Park, and is by ih^ 
 Sqnire(i2,217) dam Lavinia by Prince Ernest (4,818.) She 
 cost 499 guineas— $2,000. 

Frederilca was calved .Jannunry. 1S51. She is the same 
 color, and nearly as perfect as Lallah Rookh. She was also 
 bred by Mr. Townley; and is bv Upstart (9,760,) dam Feath- 
 ers, by the Duke of Cornwall (5,947.) She cost 300 guineas 
 —$1,500.
