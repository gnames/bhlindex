In gardens and sheltered grounds this difficulty is of less 
 account; but how small a number of all the trees planted 
 oojoy the benefits of shelter! Scarcely any one dreams of 
 nursing and hardening their trees for a period previous to 
 their final planting; and yet in a multitude of ca?es, it vpould 
 be a prudent and profitable course — and so espeeialy with 
 all the more rare, valuable, and delicate trees, shrubs and 
 plants. Even in England, where the climate is much less 
 rigorous and changeable than ours, such proceeding is recom- 
 mended and practiced. In a work which wo noticed some 
 time ago, [Practical Hints on Ornamcntiil Trce», Standiiih & 
 Noble, page -179, vol. iii.] it is recomended, in jjlanting val- 
 uable and delicate evergreen trees, to plant them first in 
 Bome sort of open boxes that would allow of their removal, 
 once or twice a year, from a more sheltered to a more ex- 
 posed place, until they would finally become sufficiently 
 hardened to bear the exposure of their permanent situation. 

It is quite unecessary to multiply illustrations showing the 
 advantages which young trees derive from being reared in 
 open situations, sufficiently exposed to admit of the growth 
 of side branches, and acquire what we call hardiness. Our 
 nursery trees are in general too close in the rows: we grow 
 three or four times too many on the gound. AVo are aware 
 that it would add considerably to the cost of the trees, to 
 give thorn so much more space; but would it not be a sav- 
 ing for the purchasers to pay one-third or one-fourth more 
 for them? Wo very much fear that wo shall have no very 
 extensive reform on this head until people become much 
 better informed on the subject of arboriculture — when, in- 
 stead of looking for the tallest trees in the nursery, they 
 look for stout, well-rooted trees, that have been well ex- 
 posed to the sun and air, and thus hardened and fitted to 
 encounter the trials of a removal. 

One reason why so few good pyramidal-shaped young trees 
 are to bo found in the nurseries, is their closeness. Al- 
 though they are cut back, no stout side branches are pro- 
 duced, because of the want of a full share of light around 
 the lower part of the trees any shoots that do start out 
 are smothered, and the entire growth is thrown into two 
 or three shoots at the top. A good pyramidal tree cannot 
 be produced — wo cannot secure the first branches — without 
 a clear space of two or three feet on each side; whereas, 
 they usually stand within a few inches in the nursery rows. 
 Another advantage in giving trees abundant space, of 
 which wo have already alluded is, that it promotes the ex- 
 tension of roots. In fact whatever favors the extension to 
 branches, also favors the roots; because, they depend so 
 much upon each other as to be coextensive. But the soil 
 has a powerful influence on the roots. In stiff, clayey soils, 
 trees have bare, forked roots, and few fibres, and that too 
 when the growth of the tree is good. Such trees do not 
 transplant well. Bry, friable soils are more favorable to 
 the growth of numerous fibrous roots, and taken from them 
 transplant more suecessfuly. Culture has a great influence 
 on the roots, too. If the ground be kept continually free 
 and pliable by cultivation around the roots, they become 
 much more fibrous and better for transplanting than if the 
 srurfaee of the ground bo permitted to harden into a crust or 
 to be covered Avith weeds or grass. 

Having the trees thus properly grown in abundant space, 
 dry, friable soils, and clean culture, the next important 
 point is to take them up properly; because no matter how 
 a tree is grown, if it be badly taken up it is not fit for suc- 
 cessful transplanting. Trees are more universally injured 
 — ruined — in this operation than in any other. AVe believe 
 it is so in all parts of the world, for our trees imported from 
 Europe are about as badly bruised and mangled as anj' we 
 have ever seen at home. At the seasons of transplanting, 
 nurserymen are generally hurried, and have to employ raw, 
 untrained laborers, who know or care as much about roots 
 R3 they do about conic sections. A man may stand over 
 them, and show them, and talk to them, and yet the roots 
 will be cut and mangled. It really requires considerable 
 skill and experience, and a great deal of care, to dig trees. 
 Some have long tap-roots that penetrate the ground deeply, 
 while others spread widely near the surface of the goound. 
 These different characters require diflferent modes of pro- 
 ceeding. Some insist that it does a tree no harm to cut 
 off -some of its roots; but we hold that the roots should bo 
 token out of the ground without the slightest bruise or mu- 
 tilation, if possible. The necessity for curtailing the tops 
 would thus bo obviated, and there would be some hopes for 
 the tree*. Wo are utterly opposed to the lopping off both 
 roots and branches of trees, and thus converting them into 

bare poles "before planting. The generally commended pro- 
 ceeding of pruning or shortening the tops, is a necessity 
 only because the roots, scarcely ever escape injury in some 
 way or other; and as loaves must recieve a supply of nutri- 
 through the roots, it is only reasonable that when the roots 
 are reduced, the loaves should also bo reduced in a corres- 
 ponding degree. 

Then comes packing for transportation. The loss the roots 
 of trees are exposed to the air, between the time they ai-e 
 taken from the grouud and the time they are jjlauted tbo 
 better. This should never be forgotten. If roots be of any 
 value, it can only be when they are sound -and fresh. More 
 than nine-tenths of all the trees planted have to be carried 
 a greater or less distance from the nursery, and ccmsequently 
 require packing; and many people, to save a little cost, will 
 run the risk of having their trees ruined. We are satis- 
 fied that vast quantities of trees die from bad packing and 
 exposure in transportation. It requires considerable skill 
 and care to pack well. Very few of the European nutsery- 
 men can pack for America, as importers well know; and on 
 this account we are always comjielled to purchase at higher 
 prices than we might do, in order to secure good packing; 
 for if we were to get trees for nothing, they would bo a 
 hard bargain unless well packed. Good packing is equally 
 essential in transporting trees from one part of our own 
 country to the other, because we have great delays. Wo 
 can get a package almost as soon from Liverpool to New 
 York as we can from New York to Iloche>ter; so that parcels 
 of trees should always befitted up to go safely twice the 
 distance intended, or twice the time that ought to carry 
 them to their destination. What signifies fifty cents or a 
 dollar per hundred in the cost of securing trees for carriage, 
 compared with running the ni?k of losing them or having 
 thein so damaged tjiat they will not recover for years. Ev- 
 ery man who orders trees should say emphatically, "Pack 
 my trees in the best manner;" and nurserymen should bo 
 held responsible for this, as much, at least, as for the quality 
 of the trees. 

Advice to Housewives 

Britannia should be first rubbed gently with a woolen 
 cloth and sweet oil, then washed in warm suds and rubbed 
 with soft leather and whiting. Thus treated it will retain 
 its beauty to the last. 

New iron should be gradually heated at first. After it 
 has become inured to heat it is not likely to crack. 

It is a good plan to put new earthenware into cold water 
 and let it heat gradually until it boiL«, then cool again 
 Brown earthenware particularly, maj' be toughened in this 
 way. A handful of rye or wheat bran thrown in while it is 
 boiling will preserve the glazing, so that it will not be de- 
 stroyed by acid or salt. 

Clean a brass vessel with salt and vinegar, before using it 
 for cooking. 

The oftuer carpets are shaken the longer they will wear. 
 The dirt that collects under them grinds out the threads. 

If you wish to preserve fine teeth, always clean thorough- 
 ly after j'ou have eaten j'our last meal at night. 

Woolens should be washed in very hot suds, and not 
 rinsed. Luke-warm water shrinks them. 

Do not wrap knives and forks in woolen — wrap them in 
 good strong paper. Steel is injured bj' lying in woollens. 
 Suet keeps good all the year round, if chopped and packed 
 down in a stone jar, and covered with molasses. 

Barley straw is the best for beds. Dry corn husks, slit 
 into shreds, are better than straw. 

When molasses i.s used in cooking it is a prodigious im- 
 provement to boil and skim it before j-ou use it. It takes 
 out the unpleasant raw taste, and makes it almost as good 
 as sugar. When molasses is used much for cooking, it is 
 well to prepare one or two gallons in this way at a time. 

Never allow ashes to be taken up in wood, or put into 
 wood. 

Always have your matches and lamp ready for use in 
 case of sudden alarm. 

Have important papers all put together, where you can 
 lay your hand on them at once in case of fire. 

Use hard soap to wash your clothes, and soft to wash 
 your floors. Soft soap is so slippery that it wastes a good 
 de.al in washing clothes. 

It is easy to have a supply of horse-radish all winter. 
 Have a quantity grated while the root is in perfection, put 
 it in bottles, fill it with vinegar, and keep it corked tight
