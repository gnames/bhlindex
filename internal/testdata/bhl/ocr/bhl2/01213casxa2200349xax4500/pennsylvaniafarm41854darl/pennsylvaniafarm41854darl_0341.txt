NUMBER 11. 

A Word of Apology. 

Our readers, we trust, Tvill overlook the want of va- 
 riety in this number, inasmuch as the publication of the 
 reports of the State Agricultural Society and synopsis 
 of the reports of county societies, where we could obtain 
 them, have taken up so much room as to preclude the 
 possibility of giving the usual amount of varied matter. 
 In our next, we trust to make up for all deficiencies in 
 this respect. 

Work for the Month. 

Farm. — In ordinary seasons this is the last month in 
 the season for out-door labor, and before it terminates 
 the farmer should be prepared for the "blasts of win- 
 ter." If not already done, proper shedding and shelter 
 should at once be made for stock not stabled. Remem- 
 ber that the more exposed stock are in cold and stormy 
 weather, the more food they will require. Where the 
 stabling is insufficient, good shelter should be substitu- 
 ted and the animals carefully protected from the wet, 
 and from the east, north and west winds. When it is 
 practicable they should have free access to running 
 water for drink ; if otherwise, the pump trough should 
 never be empty. A lump of rock salt should be within 
 constant access. It is scarcely necessary for us to re- 
 mind farmers to avoid commencing the winter with more 
 stock than their amount of provision- warrants. It is a 
 great mistake to stint animals. They should have not 
 only enough to live upon, but also enough to thrive upon. 
 Implements not already collected and carefully put away 
 in the dry, should be attended to without further delay. 
 Leaves, and all other refuse from which manure can be 
 made, should be collected for litter, &c. If not already 
 provided it is now too late for farmers to supply them- 
 selves with sugar beets, caiTots, turnips, &c. Where 
 these are at hand commence using early, as cows require 
 succulent food as soon as taken from pasture to keep up 
 a full flow of milk. If allowed to fall off, much difficul- 
 ty will be experienced in inducing a return. 

Flower Garden. — Orange and Lemon trees, Pome- 
 granates, Lagerstremias, Abutilons, and such half har- 
 dy ornamental shrubs as have been standing out, should 
 now be taken up immediately, and placed in a dry cel- 
 lar. Oranges and Lemons should be placed where there 
 is no danger of frost, and to prevent losing their leaves 
 should have plenty of light and free circulation of air in 
 open weather. Should the leaves drop they will not 
 flower the next season. Lift and pot at once Geraniums, 
 Salvias, Heliotropes, and such other plants as are tena- 

cious of frost. If taken up with care they will reward 
 with bloom through winter. Verbenas with good roots, 
 if potted and placed in a warm room where they will 
 continue growing, will keep flowering for some time, but 
 for this purpose it is much better that they should have 
 been kept in pots through summer. Take up also for 
 blooming in parlor Mignionette, Neapolitan Violets,. 
 Sweet Alyssum, Stock Gillys and Chinese rrimrose. I£ 
 the ground is very dry water well before lifting, so as toi 
 have some earth adhering to the roots. All freshly 
 potted plants should for a few days be kept closely 
 shaded. Cut down and carry away all such plants as- 
 have been hurt by frost. As soon as Dahlia tops are; 
 killed, lift the roots, cutting off within a few inches of 
 the ground. Dry them a short time in the sun, remove' 
 carefully the earth which adheres, then invert tliem for 
 a few days with tops down to drain off moistaire, after 
 which they may be removed to their winter quarters, 
 which may be on a shelf in a dry cellar, free from frost, 
 or they may be packed in dry sand. Lift all tender 
 Bulbs, Tuberose, Gladiolus, Tiger flowers, Amavyllis, 
 &c., and lay away as Dahlias in a dry plaxje. If not al- 
 ready done, plant beds of Tulips and Hyoicinths. Trench 
 a piece of gi'ound, enriching well witk short manure. 
 Plant the Bulbs nine inches apart and three inches deep. 
 When hard weather approaches cover with long litter or 
 leaves. Now is a good time to di-vide and replant Her- 
 baceous plants, Peonies, &c. X^ate out seedling Holly- 
 hocks where they are to bloom^ Lift Carnations and 
 Pinks which have been layered, arod place in a cool frame 
 for the winter. Water occasionally, and give ficsh air 
 in mild days. Chrysanthemums, if taken up carefully 
 and potted in large pots and well watered, may be re- 
 tained in bloom for a considei-able time in the house. 
 The Lilliputian or dwarf varieties which are generally 
 much later than the othens,. should be taken up at once 
 and potted. They bloem much finer in the house. 
 Water occasionally with gaano water, or liquid manure, 
 to increase the size of fic^wers. One pound of guano to 
 five gallons of water is a suitable strengtli. Take \\\> 
 roses for early !»p»-iiyg blooming. We recommend for 
 this Pink Dailies^ wnd most of the Bengals, Tea Cels, 
 Devonicnsis, Souvenir dc M.nlmaison and Hermosa. To 
 make an attractive display of flowers in-doors, earlj- iu 
 spring, when they will be most highly valued, take up 
 and pl.ice in large pots Wiegelia Rosea, Persian Lilacs, 
 Spirca Keevesii, Prunifolia, and Forsythia Viridissinia. 
 Our native Kalmia Latifolia is much esteemed in Eng- 
 land for early spring forcing in pots. Hardy annual
