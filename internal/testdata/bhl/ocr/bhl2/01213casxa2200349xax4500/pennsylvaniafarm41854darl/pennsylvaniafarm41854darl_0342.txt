seeds, such as dwJirf German Larkspurs, purple and 
 white Candytufts, Collinsia Bicolor, ditto Verna, Clarkia 
 Grandiflora, and Elegans. Gillia Tricolor should have 
 been sown last month, but if the weather keeps open 
 may still do on a warm rich border ; cover up with 
 leaves on approach of severe weather. For potting 
 earth, mix well decayed sods, with short manure, equal 
 parts of each. Plants in windows should be turned 
 around once a week to prevent growing one sided. 
 Timely hints will be given how to treat plants through 
 winter. 

Vegetable G.\ui)ex. — Dig or plow up ground for 
 next year's crop, trenching with spade or subsoil plow. 
 The exposure to frost and alternate freezing and thaw- 
 ing mellows the soil and destroys weeds and insects. 
 Cut off asparagus tops close to the ground, and clear out 
 thoroughly all weeds. Spread manure over the bed 
 three inches deep, covering slightly with earth from the 
 alleys. These should also be manured, the whole to be 
 forked in and spaded in spring. Take up and secure 
 before severe frosts beets, carrots, salsify, turnips, &c. 
 Place them in moderate sized heaps out of dooi's, cover- 
 : ing first with straw, and then with a few inches of earth, 
 , or if cellar room is convenient they may be placed in 
 .barrels or casks, mixing earth throvigh them and cover- 
 ing with sods. Have shutters or straw mats at hand 
 for covering cold frames of cabbages, cauliflowers, &c. 
 ' These should be inured to cold by exposing in moderate 
 ■ weather, covering only at nights. Give air to forcing 
 .frames to prevent plants from drawing. Take up cab- 
 .bages, arranging them in beds, and burying roots and 
 .lower leaves in earth, cover with boards, straw or corn- 
 fodder on approach of severe weather. Dig up celery, 
 . and for winter use place in beds, planting the first row 
 .against a ridge, then fill in earth nearly to the top, then 
 junother row of celery, leaving four or five inches of 
 (Carth between each row. Cover the outside row with 
 ■straw or manure, and a good covering of straw or corn- 
 rfodder over the top. Manure rhubarb beds with a 
 iiieavy coat, both on plants and in alleys, which should 
 . be dug in the latter ; cover with straw, litter or cedar 
 brush, &c., lettuce, spinach, corn salad and parsley. 
 'Take up horse radish, and lay away in sand or earth for 
 -.winter use. Dig up parsnips for early consumption, and 
 , place in barrels, covering with sod. Collect and pre- 
 serve pea sticks, bean poles, &c. Gather up cabbage 
 -stumps ajad all other rubbish, and haul to the manure

State Fair. 
 Thfi v.ery full report in the present number, of the late 
 State exhibition, makes it unnecessary to add much more. 
 In every respect, it exceeded any heretofore held in Penn- 
 sylvania, and in manj"^ departments surpassed all others 
 yet held in this country. The nett proceeds we under- 
 stand from the Treasurer, will exceed $10,000. This 
 would have been materially increased, but there is every 
 reason to believe that i?ja«y persons were admitted by the 
 unwarantable use of juembers tickets. We heard of one 
 tavern keeper who boastted of his ticket having admitted 
 fifteen persons. Tickets were also freely passed by those 
 inside, through crevices in the fence to outsiders, who 
 jthus gained admittance. In no other way can the dis- 

crepancy be accounted for, between the total amount re- 
 ceived, and the vast number of visitors to the grounds, 
 variously estimated from 150 to 250,000. The results as 
 they are, however, are cause of congratulation and just 
 pride to the whole State, and the good effects of the exhi- 
 bition will we trust be long felt. Owing to the judicious 
 arrangements of the managers, and especially of the in- 
 defatigable secretary, E. C. Walker, no disorder or con- 
 fusion occuiTcd, and with one or two exceptions exhibi- 
 tors and contributors were well satisfied with their ac- 
 comodations. We do not think there was an absolute de- 
 ficiency in a single department of live stock ; although 
 the number perhaps was not quite so large as has some- 
 times occurred in other states, this was amply made up 
 in their very superior quality. Some of the very best 
 horses, neat cattle, sheep, swine and poultry, ever seen at 
 a single exhibition in this country were on the gi-ound and 
 attracted universal admiration. We ourselves had not 
 expected so lai'ge or so fine a display. Pennsylvania now 
 has within herself the means of rivalling in this particu- 
 lar any other section of the union. 

In agricultural and horticultural implements and ma- 
 chinery contributed by the Philadelphia Houses, embra- 
 cing every conceivable implement for the farmer or gard- 
 ncr, of the highest finish and best construction, it was uni- 
 vcrs.ally admitted that the display had never been equall- 
 ed. Many farmei's from remote corners of our State went 
 away with eyes wide open at the new and improved labor 
 saving machinery exhibited, which solved the problem 
 of how to remedy the scarcity and high wages of farm 
 hands. Mowing and reaping machines, unloading forks, 
 threshing machines, horsepowers, hay and straw cutters, 
 about twenty varieties, butter workers, and improved 
 churns, grain fans, cider mills, lime and guano spreaders, 
 hay presses, and innumerable other articles, also demon- 
 strated in language louder and stronger than either 
 books or orators speak, that genius and science have 
 embraced at last the occupation of the farmer, the noblest 
 one on earth, and given him the means of lightening his 
 labors, simplyfying his daily operations, and largely aug- 
 menting his profits. This department of the late exhi- 
 bition will, we have no doubt, be worth hundreds of thou- 
 sands of dollars to Pennsylvania, in originating new ideas 
 and suggesting improvements to the farmers present. In 
 another column we call attention to several new articles, 
 new at least to most of us in Pennsylvania, where the 
 adoption of improved implements has not quite kept pace 
 with that in other states. The Horticultural display, 
 perhaps excepting quaniity of fruit, notwithstanding 
 the imfvorable dry season was thought to equal the usu- 
 al fall exhibitions of the Philadelphia Horticultural so- 
 ciety. 

We certainly never saw finer specimen plants from the 
 Green House, finer roses, or larger and more attractive 
 vegetables. Philadelphia already has a fame in these 
 matters, both far and near, which was well sustained to 
 her own credit. 

The fine arts were also well represented, and the articles 
 usualy embraced in the exhibitions of the Franklin Insti- 
 tute were brought out, adding greatly to the interests of 
 the occasion. The crowd for the last two days in the 
 tents appropriated to these objects, was so great as to 
 prevent any thing being seen to much advantage. Some
