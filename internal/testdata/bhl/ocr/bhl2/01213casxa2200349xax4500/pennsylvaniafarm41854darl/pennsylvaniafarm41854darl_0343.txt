THE FARM JOURNAL.

efforts were made to have the period of exhibition exten- 
 tended, which was very properly declined by the Presi- 
 dent and executive committee. However gratifying this 
 might have been to the citizens, it would have been un- 
 just to the farmers, who had their live stock away from 
 home at great expense and loss of time, and who had de- 
 pended on the published arrangements of its lasting but 
 four days. Many contributors also had arranged to be 
 at the New York and Maryland Fairs, which closely fol- 
 lowed o\ir own. 

The eminent sucess of the late exhibition has caused 
 a large expression of opinion in favor of the State Fair for 
 1855 being held at Philadelphia. It is indeed urged ve- 
 hemently in the city papers. We take opportunity to ex- 
 press our hope that wherever else it may be held the 
 place may not be Philadelphia. The reasons against it 
 strike us as most obvious. First, it should be recollect- 
 ed that the object of the Pa. State Agricultural Society, 
 is not directly to make money by its exhibitions, but to 
 benefit the cause of agriculture by awakening a spii-it of 
 improvement in all parts of the State, and displaying 
 most especially to remote and inaccessible districts, what 
 has been done already, thus showing what may be done. 
 If the society was now able to afford it, instead of lo- 
 cating the fiiir where there is the densest population, and 
 the most improved farming, we would rather take it into 
 one of our remote counties, and stir up the farmers there. 
 Let its benefits be extended where they are most wanted. 
 In this w.ay all parts of the commonwealth will be roused 
 lip and the good results finally seen by all, and felt in 
 an aggregate of greatly increased productiveness and de- 
 velopment of resources- 
 Pennsylvania is so favored that her resources, both ag- 
 ricultural and mineral, only want developing to place her 
 far ahead of any state in the Union. She has not to 
 create but only to develope. Among other results of the 
 late fair is the brightening prospect it gives for the 
 "State Fai-mers' School." A liberal spirit in the legisla- 
 ture, or rather the absence of a mean, contracted and 
 suicidal spirit, aided by the increased funds of the society, 
 would soon establish on a proper basis, that great pro- 
 ject for the welfare of Pennsylvania. We hope, at the 
 coming session, that the Act incorporating the Pennsyl- 
 vania Farm School may be modified and put into some 
 rational form. 

Among otlior very prominent attractions at the exhibi- 
 tion, the twenty yoke of oxen from Chester county were 
 conspicuous. They were driven around the grounds, to- 
 gether to the very great admiration of the spectators. 
 They wei'C all vci-y Large, of fine forms and in fine condi- 
 tion, well broken and tractable. Not a pair of them, but 
 would separately have graced any exhibition in the 
 country. They of course received the $50 premium. 
 Thirty-five yoke were offered by Chester county farm- 
 ers for the occasion, but as only 20 were required the 
 other 15 were left. These were nearly, if not quite, 
 equal to those taken. 

Suffolk Swine. 
 We observe by the Auburn .Journal, that our friend 
 John R. Page carried off some of the best premiums 
 for Suffolk swine at the recent Cayuga County Agricul- 
 tural Fair. 

A Superior Southdown Back. 

Our friend John AVorth, near West Chester, already 
 widely known as a breeder of fine Southdowns, has late- 
 ly made a visit to J. Thorne, Duchess county, New York, 
 and purchased of him at a high figure, a buck lamb for 
 the improvement of his own flock. With the exception 
 of two or three bucks, which had been previously re- 
 served on account of their being bred by different per- 
 sons in England, and therefore valuable for crossing and 
 to avoid too close breeding, J. Worth was allowed the 
 pick of the whole flock. With his long experience and 
 discriminating judgdment in such mattei's, and with the 
 best and most carefully selected sheep in all England to 
 choose from, it may of course be supposed the opportu- 
 nity was fully embraced. 

A buck was chosen sired by the imported buck which 
 was let at Jonas Webb's letting for 130 guineas (about 
 $G50), and out of one of the celebrated Lugar ewes. 
 Mr. Lugar is the only breeder, with one exception, who 
 has won both the first and second prizes with yearling 
 Southdown ewes at the fairs of the Royal Agricultural 
 Society. 

We congratulate our Chester county farmers, and 
 those of the State, that so valuable an anim.al has been 
 introduced. A cross from him, with such ewes as are 
 already owned by oiu' friend Worth, will no doubt result 
 in something equal at least to any flock in the country, 
 or perhaps elsewhere. 

Experiments with oats. 

Friend Daelington: â€” Some experiments I made last 
 spring in growing oats I thought might not be uninterest- 
 ing to the readers of the Journal, though a little out of 
 season. 

I plowed about half of a corn stalk field, and drilled in 
 the oats; the other half I put in with a large hoe-harrow 
 without plowing, intending to hoe-harrow it both ways, 
 but by the time it was half harrowed the second time, 
 there came a heavy rain and it was not finished. The 
 oats grew about equally well all over tliis part of the 
 field and was decidedly better than the part plowed and 
 drilled, (about the same quantity of seed to each part.) 
 A second stalk field I plowed about one third, sowed it 
 broad cast and harrowed with a spike harrow. The bal- 
 ance of this field was put in with the two horse hoe-har- 
 row, as a part of the other had been, with only once going 
 over; about the same quantity of seed sown on all parts. 
 At harvest the oats was near a fourth better on the part 
 not plowed. 

Both these experiments are in favor of not plowing, yet 
 I presume if the fore part of the season had been dry in- 
 stead of wet, the result would have been difl'event.

White Golden Flint Wheat. 
 A sample of this superior wheat wa.'; exhibited by Wm. 
 Stavely, Esq., at tho recent lair in Buiks county, and attract- 
 ed unusual attention and commendation. The grains wore 
 about twice tlio size of tho ordinary white wheat, round and 
 phmip: while tho color was about the same as tho old, and 
 with the millere, favorite variety. Mr. Stavely informs us 
 th.at he sowed two bushels on an acre last full, which pro- 
 duced about twenty five bushels last harvest. The ground 
 upon which it grew, ho does not think the best, and ijf of op-
