Itch, or Scab, in Sheep. 

A correspondent of the New England Farmer communi- 
 cates the following in relation to this disease :■ — 

"There are few diseases, perhaps, more generally or more 
 deservedly dreaded than the "scab". In many sections of 
 the country, where sheep husbandry is pursued on an ex- 
 tensive scale, the losses resulting from its prevalence, in 
 years past, have been immense. It is, indubitably, a conta- 
 gious disease, and while it is easily propagated by simple 
 contact, is often communicated to animals that have never 
 been brought in collision with those diseased. Like many 
 of the virulent and loathesome diseases which have of late 
 astonished mankind by their unheralded appearance, and 
 perplexed medical men by their inveteracy, it may well be 
 called" a pestilence which walketh in darkness;" though 
 we are not perhaps warranted in consdering it strictly ep- 
 idemic, though it sometimes seems to be conveyed through 
 the atmosphere, and particularly in those seasons when there 
 is a super-abundance of wet, and which are generally un- 
 favorable to sheep in various other ways. The diagnoses, 
 and treatment of this troublesome disease, are thus explained 
 by one whose experience in veterinary practice entitles his 
 opinions and prescriptions in this, as well as in aU other 
 matters connected with his profession, to respect : — 

"It is discovered by the animal's constantly rubbing or 
 scratching itself, and making at the same time a peculiar 
 motion with the lips. The scabs are sometimes dry and 
 sometimes moist, and spread very rapidly, though the ani- 
 mal continues healthy in other respects, and generally more 
 healthy than before. Afterwards, however, the disorder be- 
 comes internal, the sheep becomes emaciated, and dies from 
 weakness and pain. If the scab is observed at an early 
 period, it may easily be cured, or at least prevented from 
 spreading. One of the best remedies is a strong decoction 
 of tobacco to be applied to the diseased parts, after scratch- 
 ing off the scabs with a comb or other instrument. The de- 
 coction of tobacco mixed with lime-water and oil of vitriol, 
 and used constantly for some time, will generally effect a 
 radical cure : another excellent remedy is a decoction of 
 hellebore mixed with vinegar, sulphur and sijirits of turpen- 
 tine. Internal remedies are of no use, except when the dis- 
 order has induced other complaints by weakening the gen- 
 eral health." 

"Sheep are no doubt greatly injured, oftentimes, by con- 
 finement to low, wet pastures, whore they are forced to eat 
 aquatic grasses, and repose on damp and cold ground. It 
 is generally well known that the most favorable regions for 
 sheep breeding, and those in which it has been most success- 
 fully pursued, are those of a hilly, mountainous description, 
 and where little or no aquatic vegetation is ' produced. 
 High lands, even if dry and arid, are always favorable to 
 this animal." 

Death of a Distinguished Horticulturist. 
 Captain Josiah Lovett, 2d, of Beverly, died at his resi- 
 dence Tuesday morning, at the age of 63 years. The de- 
 ceased was widely known as a scientific horticulturist, a 
 public spirited man, and an intelligent citizen. He has 
 been one of the most active members of the Massachusetts 
 Horticultural Society for a long series of years, and was 
 highly esteemed by his associates for his attainments. Mr. 
 Lovett has been a member of the Massachusetts Senate, and 
 filled other public trusts. — New England. Farmer. 

Beport on Guano. 

[The following Report on Guano by the Committee of the 
 Chester County Agricultural Society, was recently published 
 in the Regisier & Examiner, from whence we transfer it to 
 our pages :] 

J. L. Darlington, Corresponding Secretary of the Chester 
 Count// Agricultural Society: — Sir, — It will be recollected, 
 that at a former meeting of this society there were several 
 committees appointed to collect facts and report on various 
 subjects of interest to the society and the friends of agricul- 
 ture, and amongst them the undersigned were appointed to 
 report on the utility of Guano as a manure. Your committee 
 therefore respectfully report that they have given the subject 
 what attention it appeared to demand. Their chairman ad- 
 dressed circulars containing interrogations calculated if 
 truthfully answered to bring out much useful information to 
 a number of gentlemen in this county and elsewhere, who 
 are known to have been in the practice of using guano ex- 
 tensively. Many of these responded promptly to our inter- 
 rogations. The practical experience of your committee en- 
 ables them, as they believe, to arrive at just conclusions. 
 Guano, as is well known, is composed of the excrements of 
 fish-eating birds, and the decomposed carcases of fowls and 
 fish that may die or be killed on the island where those de- 
 posits are to be found. It is not deemed necessary to enter 
 into the detailed analysis of guano in this report, but rather 
 to confine ourselves to facts shown by actual e.xpei-iments on 
 the soil and crops either within our own knowledge or the 
 knowledge of those on whom we can rely with confidence. 
 We will however mention the several kinds, with such re- 
 marks uj^on each as may be suggested to our minds as we 
 proceed. 

The Ichaboe Guano found on an island of the same 
 name on the coast of Africa was a good article. Some of 
 your committee have seen it used to great benefit; but the 
 supijly was very limited, and it has been exhausted. It 
 was generally known as African guano. 

Anagamos Guano is similar to the Ichaboe, but very 
 limited in extent. It is said to be gathered by the natives 
 with their hands from the rocks. It is presumed that but 
 little if any of this kind of guano was ever imported into this 
 country. We have not therefore any evidence of its utility 
 before us. 

Bolivian Guano which is found on the west side of South 
 America, had at one time a high reputation, but some cargoes 
 proving of but little value it was not sought after by farmers, 
 and hence but little if any has b^en in the market for some 
 time. Mr. Robison, a scientific gentleman who has with 
 praiseworthy zeal devoted much time to this important sub- 
 ject, says, "that the Bolivian guano being found in a latitude 
 where it sometimes rains or where it is liable to be drenched 
 with the sea spray, fully accounts for portions of it being of 
 little value to agriculture. 

Taldana Bay Guano. — Considerable quantities of this 
 guano has been ship«d to England, but so far as your commit- 
 tee are aware none of it has reached this market. It being 
 found in a climate similar to Patagonia, it is presumable that 
 its qualities are not dissimilar to Patagonia guano of which 
 we shall presently sp«ak. 

Chilian Guano. — The reputation of this guano is by no 
 moans good, but in a trial of this article on the farm of one 
 of your committee the i>resent season, on oats, the result was 
 fully equal to that of Peruvian, and at a less cost; but wheth- 
 er it can always be relied upon is a matter of doubt to your 
 committee. 

Patagonian Guano. — This kind of guano has been more 
 extensively imported into the United States than any other 
 except Peruvian, but owing to the fact of its being found in
