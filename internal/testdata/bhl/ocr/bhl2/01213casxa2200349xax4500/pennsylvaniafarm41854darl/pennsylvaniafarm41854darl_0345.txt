a latitude of sunshine and showers, both of the utmost inten- 
 sity, its quality has been considered by scientific men as 
 far inferior to Peruvian. One of your committee having 
 used it frequently, is of the opinion that it is not so much 
 inferior to Peruvian as some writers would make it appear; 
 he has frequently tried the two in the same field, at the same 
 cash out-lays per acre, and could not see any difference in 
 the result, there being about 30 per cent difference in the 
 cost per ton, and whilst 300 lbs per aero of Peruvian will 
 raise as good crops as 400 lbs of Patagonia. The preference 
 is, however, in favor of Peruvian on account of freight, 
 hauling, sowing, &c. 

Peruvian Guano. — This is not only found in the largest 
 quantities, but is really the most valuable guano yet known 
 to the agricultural world, and wo trust it will not be thought 
 out of place hero to dwell some what more at large on its his- 
 tory and character than wo have done on the other kinds. 
 This kind of guano is found, as its name indicates, along the 
 coast of Peru in South America, on rocks and islands, and 
 History informs us that it was known and much used by the 
 natives in tiie early part of the sixteenth century some three 
 hundred years ago. In the time of the Incap, anterior to 
 the invasion of that country by Spain, and inhuman barbar- 
 ity of Pizarro, the country along the coast for two hundred 
 leagues had been manured and made fertile by the use of 
 guano, and so highly was it valued at that time, that the 
 Inca's government made it a capital offence to kill any of 
 tJie sea fowl by which it was deposited. It has ever since 
 been employed along the coast as a manure, and the agri- 
 cultural success of tiiat thinly peopled region is mainly de- 
 pendent on guano for success at this day. The Peruvian 
 guano imported in this country was principally taken from 
 the Chincha Islands in latitude 13° and l-i°, about 12 miles 
 from the coast of Peru in the Bay of Pisco, with a few car- 
 goes from the Lobos Islands near the same coast. Peruvian 
 guano derives its superiority over all other guano, principally 
 from the fact that rain never falls on those islands where it 
 is found. The waters around these islands are alive with 
 fi^h and countless thousands of fish-eating birds make this 
 their abode; and after satisfying their ravenous appetites on 
 the finny tribe, retire to these islands until hunger and an 
 empty craw prompts them again to deal destruction among 
 the watery inhabitants; and this process having been going 
 on and this mass of excrement accumulating for thousands 
 of years, the amount of guano first found on those islands 
 was immense. Humbolt in his history of South America 
 gives the thickness of some deposities as 50 to 60 feet, and 
 although many doubted the correctness of this historian we 
 find that the actual surveys made by the Peruvian Govern- 
 ment some years since, have proven that the guano depos- 
 ites in some instances are from one hundred to three hun- 
 dred feet thick, and that there was at least twenty millions 
 of tons at that time available. 

Wishing to be as brief as possible your committee will now 
 proceed to answer some of the inquiries that are involved in 
 this important subject. 

First^ — Is guano Profitable as manure? 
 In answering this inquiry wo will lay before you the tes- 
 timony of gentleman of large experience and undoubted ve- 
 racity, and in connection therewith give you the individual 
 experience of those of your committee who have used it to 
 some extent For some of the testimony adduced we are in- 
 debted to a work on guano by Jlr. Robison. Thomas P. 
 Stabler, of Montgomery county, ^Id., who is a gentleman of 
 the highest degree of intelligence and integrity, a practical 
 and scientific farmer, an exemplary member of the society 
 of Friends, and with whom one of your committee is happy 
 to have sonic acquaintance, thus writes: "In the summer of 

1845 I prepared 17 acres for wheat; about 5-6 of it was ex- 
 tremely poor; upon a portion of the field was put 112 c.art 
 loads of manure from the barn yard and stable; on the re- 
 mainder of the 17 acres I sowed 270 pounds of good African 
 guano per acre; there were two small pieces left without ma- 
 nure of any kind on the best part of the field. Men of good 
 judgment and experience were of the opinion that without 
 the aid of guano, I could not have saved ni'ire than from 60 
 to 70 bushels of wheat from the field; and the product was 
 320 bushels or nearly 19 bushels to the acre, while the parts 
 not manured were scarcely worth cutting." Let us see how 
 far friend Stabler was benefitted in this experiment. On 
 that land where no manure was put he raised about 4 bush- 
 els of wheat to the acre worth say $4; where the guano was 
 sown ho raised over 19 bushels (he says it was decidedly the 
 poorest part of the' field) worth $19; deduct $4,82, (the cost 
 of the guano which was African at $40 per ton,) which 
 leaves a clear profit of $14,18 per acre, with an ample sup- 
 ply of straw to pay incidental expenses. Nor is this all ; 
 hear him fiH-ther in reference to this same field. "This field 
 was sown dowu with clover the next spring, and this time 
 (that is two years after) its ajipearaneo affords as strong evi- 
 dence of great improvement in the land as it did during the 
 growth of the wheat; it has been pastured freely during two 
 summers, and been exposed to the action of the frosts of two 
 winters, and upon the guanoed portion of the field I have 
 not seen a single clover root thrown out by the frost, while 
 from the part manured from the barnj-ard it has almost en- 
 tirely disappeared." 

The Hon. James A. Pearee, U. S. Senator from Maryland 
 a farmer in high repute says: — "In April, 1845, 1 applied 350 
 lbs of Patagonia guano to an acre of growing wheat, the land 
 being entirely unimproved and very poor. It was applied as 
 a top dressing mixed with a small portion of plaster, and the 
 wheat crop was doubled at least; fine clover suceeded it, and 
 in two crops one of corn and one of small grain, three and 
 four years afterwards, the effect of the guano are still appa- 
 rent." Here is strong testimony not only as its utility to the 
 present crop, but of lasting qualities as a manure, and that 
 too when applied as a top dressing, which is now well known 
 to be the most unfavorable way it can be applied. 

The Hon. John M. Clayton, of Delaware, bears the strong- 
 est testimony to the profitable and lasting effect of guano on 
 his lands: and in adilition we have before us an account of 
 experiments tried by C. P. Holcomb, Esq., of the same state 
 whose fame is abroad as a scientific farmer, and a gentleman 
 of veracity. lie says a farm" he owns near Dover which 
 was celebrated for its poverty before he used guano on it is 
 now equally celebrated for its productiveness, and that no 
 greater blessing was ever bestowed on the stite of Delaware 
 than the discovery of guano." Your committee have before 
 them certificates of numerouscxperimontswith guanoinPenn- 
 sylvania all tending to confirm their good opinion of it as a 
 manure. In New Jersey, we have ample and convincing 
 evidence that it acts well upon their sandy soil. Edward 
 Harris, an enterprising farmer at Moorestown, on the sandy 
 region east of Philadelphia .speaks in the highest terms of 
 guano as a cheap and lasting manure. To his name we 
 might add those of .James Buckalew, Commodore Stephens, 
 and Professor Mapes, all men of eminence, experience and 
 integritj' who bear their united testimony to the great in- 
 crease in crops and fetility of the soil of New Jersey from 
 the use of guano. Your committee might thus bring testi- 
 mony from intelligent and enterprising Rgriciilturalists in 
 almost every state in the Union to sustain the assertion that 
 guano is a cheap and lasting manure. But the length of this 
 report admonishes to be more brief, nnd after a few experi- 
 ments in our own and adjoining counties, and a brief expo-
