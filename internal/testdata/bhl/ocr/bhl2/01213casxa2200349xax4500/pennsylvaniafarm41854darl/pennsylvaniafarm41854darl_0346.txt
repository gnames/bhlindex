[November 

sition of our conclusious we -svill close. In the southern 
 part of this county (once known as "scrogy") and the ad- 
 joining portions of Lancaster and Cecil counties, guano has 
 worked wonders. Two of your committee are familiar ivith 
 results, and will give a few of them. An enterprising farmer 
 near the Brick meeting House, Md., two years ago raised 
 twenty five bushels to the acre (on worn out land,) with 250 
 lbs to the acre, mixing it with plaster and ploughing it down. 
 We have repeatedly soon good crops of grass follow a crop of 
 wheat raised on worn out land which mowed well for two or 
 three years afterwards. One of your committee tried a piece 
 of miserably poor land in corn last year with guano; and the 
 result was at least 40 bushels to the acre. About two acres 
 was taken into ono of his improved fields by moving the 
 fence, and on the unimproved part he sowed about 300 lbs of 
 guano per acre and ploughed it under, the result was as 
 above stated oiid the whole field was this year in oats, with 
 :i light coat of guano on it all, and the two acres produced 
 decidedly the best crop, uotwithstanding the improved part 
 of the field had been four times limed and twice heavily ma- 
 nured witliin the last 12 years. Your committee have seen 
 farms, that scarcely produced enough to sustain the occu- 
 pier, m.nde to yield an abundance by a moderate use of 
 guano, and such has the effect produced that (" scrogy ") is 
 now no whore to be found. Unimproved lands in the region 
 alluded to have more than doubled in value since the dis- 
 covery of guano. And why?. Because with it as a manure 
 the poorest land can be brought at once into profitable cul- 
 ture. We have assurance by a Newlin farmer of high repu- 
 tation that 300 pounds of guano to the acre has producdhim 
 hotter wheat and grass than a heavy coat of manure in the 
 snme field. The clover stood the winter better and mowed 
 .ind pastured equally well. AVe have before us the strongest 
 t'.'stimony that guano is a superior article for all kinds of 
 vegetables, and many of the peach growei-s testify that guano 
 will pi-evcnt and cure the yellows in peach trees, and pre- 
 vent (he worms from injuring all kinds of trees. 

Your committee therefore arrive at the following conclu- 
 sions: — That guano is a cheap, profitable and lasting manure; 
 tliat it not only increases the quantity but materially improves 
 the (juulity of every thing that is grown by it; that by causing 
 young clover to grow more vigorouslj' it is prevented from 
 being thrown out by tho winter frosts; that guanoed wheat 
 is not so liable to be injured by fly. There is no kind of 
 manure in the opinion of your committee, so profitable to 
 the farmer. Peruvian guano is believed by your committee 
 to be preferable to any in the market; it should be mixed 
 with plaster (at about one-half a bushel of the latter to one 
 hundred pounds of the former) before sowing, should be 
 sown broad cast and immediately ploughed under, at the 
 rate of from 300 to 405 lbs to the acre. It is good for all crops 
 on all soils, but acts better in wet seasons than dry.

How to clean Animals and Plants of Vermin. 
 M. Pvaspail, in the English "Journal of Agriculture," gives 
 an account of a plan for destroying vermin on animals, 
 iind also on trees and plants. The process he recommends 
 is to make a solution of aloes, (ono gramme of that gum to 
 a litre of water,) and by means of a long brush to wash over 
 tho trunks and br.inches of trees with this solution, which 
 will speedily, ho says, destroy all the vermin on them, and 
 effectually prevent others from approaching. In order to 
 clean sheep, or animals with long hair, they must either be 
 bathed with this solution, or be well washed with it. The 

writer mentions several trials which he made of the solution 
 with the most complete success, and very strongly recom- 
 mends it to general use. — London Advertiser.

Advantages of Under-Draining, 

Waring, in his "Elements of Agriculture," states that the 
 advantages of under-draining are many and important, and 
 enumerates the following : 

1. It entirely prevents drought. 

2. It furnishes an increased supply of atmospheric fer- 
 tilizers. 

3. It warms the lower portions of tho soil. 

4. It hastens the decomposition of roots and other organ- 
 ie matter, 

5. It accelerates the disintegration of the mineral matters 
 in the soil. 

6. It causes a more even distribution of nutritious mat- 
 tors among those parts of soil traversed by roots. 

7. It improves the mechanical texture of the soil. 

8. It causes the poisonous oxcrementitious matter of 
 plants to be carried out of the reach of their roots. 

9. It prevents grasses from running out. 

10. It enables us to deepen tho surface soil. 
 By removing excess of water — 

11. It renders soil earlier in the spring. 

12. It prevents the throwing out of grain in winter. 

13. It allows us to work sooner after rains. 

14. It keeps off tho effects of cold weather longer in the 
 fall. 

15. It prevents the formation of acetic and other organic 
 acids, which induce the growth of sorrel and similar weeds. 

16. It hastens the decay of vegetable matter, and the fi- 
 ner comminution of the earthy parts of tho soil. 

17. It prevents, in a great measure, the evaporation of 
 water, and the consequent abstraction of heat from the soil. 

18. It admits fresh quantities of water ft-om rains, etc., 
 which are alwaj'S more or less imbued with the fertilizing 
 gases of the atmosphere to be deposited among the absorb- 
 ent parts of soil, and given up to the necessities of plants. 

19. It prevents the formation of so hard a crust on the 
 surface of the soil as is customary on heavy lands. 

Marrow Squash. 

This delicious vegetable is grown in great abundance on 
 the fertile fields of Marblehead. While the crops in other 
 places are cut o£F by the bug on the leaf, or the Maggot at 
 the root, there it would seem, the jilants find no obstacle in 
 the way of going ahead. 

Perhaps it may interest some to know how this is brought 
 about. As I passed the field of Mr. Hathaway, situate on 
 the right hand side of the road as you go from Lynn to 
 Marblehead, I saw more than two acres covered with squash- 
 es as luxuriant as though no drouth had prevailed. On in- 
 quiry of the proprietor, I learned that the sod was turned in 
 the spring, and pulverized with a fair coating of compost 
 thereon, and the seeds were planted in hills eight feet apart 
 leaving three plants in a hill. Now the ground is covered 
 with an abundance of squashes, varying in size from three 
 to ten pounds each, estimated to exceed ten tons to the acre, 
 commanding in the market $35 a ton — amounting to $300 
 an acre. This was not the only field I saw ; others of like 
 character are to be seen. On the ground of Mr. Washburn, 
 Mr. Howe, Mr. Stone and Mr* Brewer, and others in the 
 nedghborhood — though not so abundant. Whether those 
 crops are brought about by a peculiarity in the soil — or in 
 the manure applied, or in the vigilance with which they are 
 tended — they are to be seen by any one who will look at 
 them. — P., in New-England Farmer,
