N. B. — The Committee in awarding the premiums desire 
 to say, that in consequence of the close competition in the 
 best Shanghai and Cochin China fowls, and "best display," 
 to do justice to the parties, agreed to award premiums of 
 equal merit. 

The Committee with groat pleasure state that they confi- 
 dently believe the display of poultry in every department far 
 exceeded any thing of the kind previously presented at any 
 of our Agricultural Fairs ; and the Committee feel that those 
 who add so much to the beauty and attraction of the grand 
 display deserve to be most favorably noticed. Many of the 
 fowls were very superior, and consequently the competition 
 very close. The Committee in some instances transcended 
 their powers, but believed it just to act as they did. 

In addition to the premiums awarded above, the Commit- 
 tee ask respectfully to recommend the following
