Your Committee beg leave to say, that there were many 
 other articles on exhibition, which were well worthy of at- 
 tention; but, owing to the great amount of labor attending 
 the duties of the Committee, and a want of proper arrange- 
 ment of the articles, we could not give them that examiaa- 
 tion which many of them merited. 

We would respectfully suggest, that the duties of this 
 Committee, at another exhibition, bo subdivided into not 
 less than three Committees. 

We beg leave to report that we have examined tho "Self- 
 Shutting Farm Gate," deposited by Townscnd Sharpies?, 
 exhibited by Paschall Morris & Co., and pronounce it admi- 
 rable in every particular, and therefore award him a diplo-
