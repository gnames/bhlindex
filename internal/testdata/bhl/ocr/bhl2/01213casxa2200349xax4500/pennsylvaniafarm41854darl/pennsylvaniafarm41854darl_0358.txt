An almost endless variety of implements were presented 
 under this class (No. 2.), principally by Paschall Morris & 
 Co., and D. Landreth, which were not entitled to premiums 
 by the printed catalogue. 

Your committee would do violence to their feelings, and 
 injustice to Messrs. Paschall Morris & Co. and D. Landreth, 
 did they not take further notice of the very large and fine 
 display of implements made by those gentlemen, of every 
 variety and of the finest quality for agricultural and horti- 
 cultural purposes in the most extended applications of the 
 term, giving an earnest to the agricultural community that 
 they are capi^lo of supplying any demand made on thom 
 for imfilements in all their variety. The Committee feel 
 much pleasure in awarding to each a silver modal. 

In condlusion your Committee would respectfully suggest 
 the propriety of having all articles that may be presented 
 for exhibition hereafter, placed together under their respec- 
 tive classes or numbers. Such an arrangement would save 
 the Judges treubio in their arduous duties, as well as much 

dissactisfaction among contributors. Thomas P. Knox,

No. 20. — Farm Implements, No. 3. 
 To Hon. F. Watts, President of the Pennsylvania State 
 Agricultural Society : — The Committee, No. 20, on Farm 
 Implements and Machinery have examined with as much 
 care as time would permit, the articles submitted to their 
 inspection, and have been greatly gratified with the appear- 
 ance of the exhibition, and feel that, although they have en- 
 deavored to do justice to the exhibitors, yet in much they 
 possibly have failed. The great variety of implements ex- 

hibited to us, and the necessity of examining each separate- 
 ly, prevent the Committee from particularizing. 

The Committee would most respectfully suggest that here- 
 after a separate committee be .ippointed on Steam Power 
 and Hydraulics, as a knowledge of farm implements and 
 machinery does not necessarilj' imply a knowledge of either 
 of the former.
