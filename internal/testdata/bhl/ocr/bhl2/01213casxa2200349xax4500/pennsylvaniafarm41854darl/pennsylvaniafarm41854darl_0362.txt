Your Committee, befoi^e closing their report, cannot but 
 express regret that the uopropitious nature of the season, 
 which has been almost unexampled for drought, has limited, 
 in a great degree, the quantity and quality, especially of 
 those rich varieties of fruits which, under more favorable 
 circumstances, would have^ in all j^robability, furnished the 
 most splendid display ever presented for exhibition.
