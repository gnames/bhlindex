■will ever succeed well with it. The Cylindrical Root 
 Cutter, built by Ruggles, Nourse & Mason, is the best, 
 and we believe the only one in use that answers the pur- 
 pose fully. With it a bushel of turnips may be sliced or 
 cut into sizes fit for feeding in one minute. 

Among the smaller implements with which the hall 
 devoted to farm implements was filled, we were forcibly 
 struck with the remarkably well finished forks, spades, 
 shovels, hoes, &c., many of which were finished in a 
 style of excellence suflBcient to fit them for parlor orna- 
 ments instead of the rough purposes of the farm. We 
 particularly noticed a case of Set/the Snathes, manufac- 
 tured by Lanson, Goodenow & Co., which exceeded any 
 thing we had ever seen. There were six difi'erent 
 kinds, each excellent, and combining all the valuable 
 improvements in this important department of farming 
 tools. 

KimbalVs Improved Patent Shovels and Spades. — The 
 manufacture of these has been greatly improved upon 
 recently, those on exhibition being finished in a very 
 superior manner. A strong strap is substituted for the 
 old fashioned socket for fastening the blade to the han- 
 dle. Kimball's shovels are rapidly gaining favor with 
 our farmer friends, and are warranted by the manufac- 
 turers fully equal to any in use. 

Tutlle Hoes. — Of these superior and generally used 
 hoes quite a large display was made, a number of them 
 finished in the highest style of workmanship. The old 
 adage that "good wine needs no bush," may very appro- 
 priately be applied to these excellent tools. 

Wooden Shaking or Straw Forks. — Some of these were 
 very superior. They were made in Chester county, and 
 partook of all the excellence and beauty of finish of all 
 the articles above named. 

Reynold's Hay Forks, Batchelder's Hay and Straw 
 Forks, Morse's ^Manure Forks, and the Hay Manure 
 Forks of Sheble & Lawson, to which the first premium 
 was awarded, were all of them got up in fine style, and 
 can be confidently recommended to the attention of those 
 desirous of purchasing really good articles. 

Apples for Hogs. 
 Some of our distant northern and western exchanges 
 are still discussing the "value of apples as a food for 
 hogs." In most parts of this State, the people are dis- 
 cussing their value as a luxui-y for themselves. Some 
 believing three shillings a half peck too much to pay 
 even for a good thing. Perhaps in another year we, 
 too, may be willing to think of their value as a food for 
 hogs, but just now the idea is ludicrous. 

The Jennetting Apple. 
 Micajah Burnett, of the United Society of Shakers, 
 Pleasant Hill, fiercer county, Kentucky, states in the 
 last volume of the Patent Office Reports, "that the Jen- 
 netting is a most important vai'icty. The tree grows 
 with usual thrift, and is nearly three weeks later in 
 blooming than all others we have made trial of, and thus 
 escapes the late frosts." Among the varieties he enu- 
 merates as grown by the Society are the Queen, Rambo, 
 Fall Pippin, Spitzenburg and Relle-fleur. As the late 
 frosts in spring frequently destroy all hopes of a crop of 
 the usual varieties of apples, the importance of obtain- 

ing "Jennetting'* grafts must be apparent to all ; and 
 we therefore take the liberty of calling the attention of 
 nurserymen and others to the subject. W^e shall en- 
 deavor to obtain further information in relation to this 
 apple for the benefit of our readers.

Wintering Stock. 

Mr. Darlington : — We have sacred authority for say- 
 ing that "the righteous man is merciful unto his beasts." 
 If this be true, (and who can doubt it ?) I fear there are 
 few among us who will be reproved for their "righteous- 
 ness sake." In fact the text is universally disregarded, 
 and those making the strongest professions of piety 
 amongst us base their pretensions on other gi-onnds. 
 As this is the season when the poor brutes usually suffer 
 most, I beg to ask your permission to endeavor to arrest, 
 in a small degree, the attention of one class of the pub- 
 lic to some of the merciless practices they sanction or 
 permit. 

Let us take this cold, wet winter's morning to visit 
 my neighbor A. B., and his live stock. He is a good 
 neighbor, a good citizen, and esteemed a good Christian. 
 We find him in his barn-yard feeding his steers, young 
 cattle and dry cows, with corn fodder. There is a shed 
 along a part of one side of the yard, where a few sheaves 
 have been thrown, and where the stronger portion of the 
 steers have taken exclusive possession ; the stronger 
 portion of the remainder are crowding about their own- 
 er as he trudges on with his fodder, and every now and 
 then receiving a kick from his heavy boots on the head 
 or abdomen, to teach that /ear should ever overcome hun- 
 ger, how urgent soever the latter may be ; while the 
 others, helpless and hopeless, are standing with their 
 backs bowed, and their bodies shrunk to the smallest 
 compass, shivering with the cold and wet. After a time 
 the food is so scattered that these poor creatures can get 
 enough to keep life and carcase together, but not enough 
 to keep them in a thriving condition. 

We turn with a shudder from these poor brutes, as wc 
 think of the misery they are suffering, and the yet 
 greater misery they will have to endure, when snow and 
 slush are added to their discomforts. We next enter 
 the cow stable, and here we find the opposite system to 
 prevail. The cowa are packed as closely as possible, 
 the windows have been carefully closed to exclude the 
 fresh air, the manure has been suffered to accumulate 
 for several days, and notwithst-anding the "litter," the 
 hind quarters of the cows when lying are really imbed- 
 ded in their own excrement. From the hoof to the hip 
 it is a mass of dried dung. The air of the stable has 
 been breathed over and over again, and is so mingled with 
 the odors of the foetid mass that it is absolutely sicken- 
 ing. Yet in this place Mr. A. confines his cows fifteen 
 or eighteen hours out of twenty-four. 

We will next enter the horse stable, which, although 
 not quite as bad as the cow stable, is obnoxious to the 
 same objections. The noble animals, well fed and well 
 curried as they may bo, cannot bid defiance to one of the 
 fundamental laws of health — pure air. An ammoniated 
 atmosphere, and a bed of their own excrement, is as un- 
 fitted for them as for their master. So it is through- 
 out. 

Even the dog, the most faithful animal in his servic^
