t-eaches a reliance upon our own efforts for reward, and dig- 
 nifies labor by the noblo enterprise of subduing even the 
 elements to the purpose of human subsistence. The pal- 
 miest diij-s of Rome were distinguished for their reverence 
 to this worthy oni{)loymont ; Cinoinnatus, on his return from 
 conquest, was more impatient to retire to his little villa, than 
 to bo greeted in triumph by the whole Roman people. The 
 hand of Rogulus fitted the plough as well as the sword. 
 Whilst he w:is absent in Africa, the Senate attended to his 
 crops, and sent him word that they would continue so to do, 
 as long as he remained at the head of their armies. 

Julius Agricolahns the merit of being one of the earliest 
 benefactors of Great Britain, in inculcating the art of cul- 
 ture, which afforded abundant supplies not only to the army 
 but largo quantities of grain were exported from the Island. 
 After the Roman power declined, the constant predatory in- 
 cursions of the numerous clans upon each others' posses- 
 sions, rendered the tillage of the ground a precarious pur- 
 suit. The spirit of the warrior seemed humbled in the 
 exercise of works so pacific and bloodless. Hence on such 
 grounds must we infer those laws were founded which treat- 
 ed the cultivation of land as unworthy the notice of men, 
 and prevented it from being followed except by women and 
 slaves. There is in the character of the North American 
 Indians a similar disregard for any occupation of industry. 
 Thcj' leave all that is to be done by handicraft to women 
 .and slaves. The attractions of the chase are more conge- 
 nial with their pleasures than those which of necessity are 
 more sedentary and tedious. What is the Rod Man with 
 such antecedents but a wanderer upon the face of the earth. 
 Vainly have efforts boon made to instruct him in the arts of 
 civilization; he becomes an adept only to such as administer 
 to his untamed passions, and his mission is closed wherever 
 the stroke of the axe opens a path through the forest, and 
 invites the fostering hand of industry to awaken the latent 
 virtues of the soil. In a political as well as moral view 
 there is much to be acquired from a permanent investiture 
 of the soil. The principal charm of life is identified with 
 it. Not only is it promotive of the right of propertj- and a 
 consequent dependence upon the safety and security of the 
 Btato, but the cottage reared by our forefathers, and the old 
 oak that overshadows it, impress us with pleasing recollec- 
 tions. The associations of youth, of middle age, or of de- 
 clining years, cluster around the heart in memory of the old 
 homestead. The family altar is there — there the first les- 
 sons of instruction have been inculcated, and character has 
 been formed to mark the progress of life with good or evil. 
 The spirit of good is peculiarly the invocation of the hus- 
 bandman. His daily observations of phj'sical changes as 
 tonish his senses, and load him onward to a study of the 
 Bourco from whence they emanate. The truths of Revela- 
 tion become manifest before him, without which civilization 
 itself were but half accomplished. Just .as well might we 
 hope for bountiful crops from a parched and sterile desert, 
 as that the best fruits of human knowledge could be gleaned 
 without the salvo of some guiding principle, to renovate the 
 mind and establish its future destiny. Advantages arising 
 from the influences of agriculture upon the character of na- 
 tions are palpable and of easy discernment. Wherever la- 
 bor is degraded, and lu.xury, idleness and pride predominate, 
 nations or individuals sink into insignificance and reproach, 
 but where industry lends its vigorous features to civilization, 
 the blessings of peace, prosperity and happiness ensue as 
 well to the people as the State. 

The prosperity of a nation is also augmented when the 
 domain is .apportioned into such divisions as may increase 
 the number of landed proprietors, thus to insure not only a 
 better appreciation of every acre, by making it thoroughly 
 productive, but also to rear a permanent yeomanry as ready 
 to pay her taxes as to fight her battles. Thus the progres- 
 siva spirit of the age points to the Homestead bill as a ra- 
 tional measure, by which humanity is elevated beyond the 

common vicissitudes of fortune in assuring a home for the 
 homeless. By such means the burdens of taxation will bo 
 lessened, and ,as small f:irms afford the largest profits, the 
 value of productive wealth must be largely increased. 

The quiet serenity and composure of rural districts, com- 
 pared with the noise and turbulence incident to cities, would 
 indicate that whilst commerce feeds the passions agriculture 
 calms them. The agitations of trade are not congenial to 
 the enlargement of human knowledge, or to the improve- 
 ment of that perception of pleasure which makes content- 
 ment the principal object of human happiness. Districts 
 and sections of country occur in which that happiness is a, 
 reality. 

Imagine, if you please, an area of .300 square miles with 
 a population of 400 persons. The inhabitants reside in nu- 
 merous small hamlets neatly elevated by the hill side, and 
 by common consent their local government is patriarchal. 
 The aged of the village are generally the ancestors of the 
 rest, and all seem to be united as one family. Their occu- 
 pations are various, for none are idle. Some are agricultu- 
 ral, some pastoral, some fell the forest, and some penetrate 
 the thickets in the chase, or perchance lure with gilded bait 
 the lithesome trout. They spin and weave the fleece of their 
 own flocks, and color their clothes with native hues that vie 
 in lustre with the tyrian dye. Their fields afford them 
 bread, and their own herds present rich rashers of beef, re- 
 dolent with the fragrance of sweet pastures and fresh air, 
 that would bring tears of delight to the admirer's cf "Eng- 
 land's staple," and make even a monk of La Trnppe solicit 
 temporary absolution. The wide spreading maple renders 
 the tributo of sugar, and the wild bee brings them its case- 
 ments of honey. Their trj-sting times are constant and not 
 periodical. Hospitality to the stranger is their ruling virtue. 
 On such occasions the tables are laden with the choicest vi- 
 ands. Water sparkling and bright, f^esh as from the rock 
 of Horeb graces the festival, fit emblem of innocence and 
 purity that adds now charms to every repast. There wa« 
 but one fellow being whom they could not encourage; he 
 was the physician, and old age was the only disease, for 
 which Materia Mcdicaj suggested no remedy. The tax 
 gatherer was provided for, and beside him they owed no man 
 any thing. Their every want was supplied, and their every 
 wish gratified: whilst care, the constant companion of mor- 
 tals, seemed not yet to have discovered this liftle nook of 
 Paradise. This is a truthful description of a township in 
 this Commonwealth, whoso virtues may well bo imitated. 
 There are doubtless many political theorists who would ob- 
 ject to tho unproductive character and apparent letharg}' of 
 a community whoso commerce is complete without any for- 
 eign import, and whose requirements are supplied without 
 the need of money. To such as desire to enlarge the area 
 of exchanges, and believe in the importance of increasing 
 the mutual relations of nations by commercial intercourse, 
 there may be gleaned but a sorry consolation from these sta- 
 tistics. Yet en the other hand, if the object of government 
 is the alleviation of human suffering, and the assurance of 
 man's highest happiness, it may bo well to inquire whether 
 these objects are not better obtained in this simple manner, 
 than by those ingenious devices of art which constrain an 
 increase of exertion to attain an end already accomplished. 
 If we are independent of foreign nations, and have within 
 ourselves all the resources of abundance to supply our wants, 
 the danger of war is not to bo dreaded, because without an 
 object of gain it is unfashionable to provoke it The wealth 
 of the government in our system of liberty is rather an evi- 
 dence of misrule than of good fortune, for whatever may be 
 the wealth of individu.als, that can only be maintained and 
 protected by tho most simple and economical administration 
 of public affairs. With us, excessive accumulations in the 
 treasury are a nucleous around which disasters cluster like 
 moths around the glare of a lamp ; it beguiles them from 
 their bettor instincts, and draws them into a vortex of ruin
