the boughs and barks of troos, whilst in winter it is conten- 
 ted with the dried leaves of the forest Its uiilk has more 
 consistency than cow's milk, keeps sweet <a longer period, 
 and is also richer in caseous matter. Its flesh proporlj' pre- 
 pared, is not inferior to venison, and whilst its hair possesses 
 but little value, its skin is known everywhere in the shape 
 of kid gloves and morocco shoes. 

The fact that the goat will thrive where sheep will not, 
 entitles this animal to more notice than it has hitherto re- 
 ceived. 

With all the attractions of interest that surround the far- 
 mer, the most skilful efforts remain unfruitful without 
 favourable seasons. Beside the rust and smut, new en- 
 emies of the insect species are becoming formidable. For 
 rust and smut there appears to be no certain prevention, it 
 being a parasitic fungus which insinuates itself into, and 
 diseases the plant, but for the ravages of insects there 
 should be some remedy. The wheat midge has been des- 
 troyed in a degree by burning Orpimont, a mixture of sul- 
 phur and arsenic, before sunrise, or after sunset when the 
 plant commences to flower. Care must be taken not to in- 
 hale the fumes. A simple remedy, is to carry strong lights 
 around the field when the night is dark. A greater cure for 
 this evil would be, to stop the war of extermination now 
 constantly being waged against the feathered tribe. If this 
 amusement were confined to mere birds of prey, or to those 
 which inhabit the sedgy margins of our lakes and rivers, or 
 delight in sporting their graceful forms upon the summit of 
 our rock bound mountains, it is probable that the order of 
 nature which assigns them food in their secluded haunts, 
 would keep them from being considered of great conse- 
 quence. But the wanton and indiscriminate slaughter of 
 the minutest warbler that nestles in the cottage eaves, of the 
 numerous and innocent birds that guard your orchards, and 
 watch the destroyers of your grain crops, is a barbarity un- 
 worthy Uie dignity of a sportsman. What a trophy it is, for 
 a stalwart specimen of humanity to while away all the ante- 
 cedents of his moral and social qualities, in exchange for 
 the life of a harmless sparrow. There is a sympathy in ev- 
 ery heart, which renders us feelingly alive to the pain and 
 sufferings of the humblest object of animated nature. It 
 was this sympathy that caused an act of Parliament in the 
 days of Charles the 1st "against the cruelty of ploughing 
 by the tayle, and pulling wool off living sheep." Now ev- 
 ery act of cruelty has a tendency to extinguish the senti- 
 ment of sympathy, and stifle the feelings of tenderness and 
 benevolence. If a child be early trained to such exhibi- 
 tions, the vicious propensity grows into a habit, and his sen- 
 sibility even to human suffering, will be proportionally di- 
 minished. The torturer of a kitten, or the murderer of a 
 bird, will, by degrees, become unrestrained from positive 
 acts of violence towards his own species, whenever goaded 
 thereto by the influence of interest or passion. Upon this 
 foundation crimes are soon erected, until at length, wrown 
 callous to every social and moral impression, he closes his 
 profligate career by the perpetration of deliberate murder. 
 Is it a wonder that the corn worm revels, or the wheat 
 midge swarms, or the caterpillar clusters, in untold myriads, 
 when the race of birds that feed upon them is almost extinct. 

The emulation which societies like yours inspire, is condu- 
 cive to the public good, and in all your public exhibitions 
 there is something to be learned, for which those who pro- 
 mote them may be congratulated. Knowledge is becoming 
 so universal, that the complications of civil government 
 vanish before it, and what were once known as learned pro- 
 fessions, will be less distinguished through the general diff- 
 usion of public education. What nobler pursuit remains 
 than agriculture, as a source of study and employment. 

The day cannot be far distiint, when the plough will be the 
 first instrument with which the scholar may diversify his 
 exercises, as it surely must become the only reliable basis 
 upon which a free government can be maintained. It is a 
 vast field of contemplation, in which all are interested to as- 
 certain whether we can keep up the proper condition of the 
 soil to afi'ord sufficient food for the wants of an increasing 
 population around us? Let this inquiry be fairly investiga- 
 ted. The fiite of empires may be read in its detail, and me- 
 morials of former grandeur be gleaned from crumbling rel- 
 ics upon a desert waste. 

New England Horse Exhibition. 

Wo clip the following notice of the New England Horse 
 Exhibition from the Rural New Yorker : — 

"The New England Horse Show came off at Brattlo- 
 boro, Vt., Oct. 18, 19, and 20. It was, on the whole, quite 
 successful. About 150 animals were entered, four-fifths of 
 which were of the Morgan varieties — Black Hawks pre- 
 dominating. The trotting match was an attractive feature; 
 13 geldings and mares were entered for competition. The 
 first prize of $50, was taken by Nelly A. Sherman, an eight 
 year old Morgan mare, owned by G. R. Orcutt, of Middle- 
 bury, Vt, — time 2 minutes and 49 seconds. Lddy Becmcorth 
 by Rattler, a four year old, owned by H. H. Thaxtjer of 
 Rutland, came in second. Abdullah, a six year old mare 
 owned by J. L. Briogs, Springfield, Mass., came in third, 
 and MinHcstiqne Belle, a four year old, of old Nimrod and 
 Messenger blood, owned by A. N. Stevens, of Engsburg, 
 last. Flying Jfurgan owned by Mr. Adams of Burlington, 
 trotted a match against time, making the mile in two min- 
 utes and fifty four seconds. Two Black Hawk and Morgan 
 colts, each throe years old, owned by Mrs. Hatch of Bethel, 
 and Grosvenor of Bridgeport, trotted a mile, the former in 
 three minutes, and the latter in three minutes and three 
 seconds. 

It is to be feared that these tiotting matches, useful and 
 harmless in themselves, will engender a love for the race- 
 course, than which few things are more pernicious to the 
 morals of a community." 

Experiments with Potatoes. 

A correspondent of the Practical Farmer gives the follow- 
 ing as the result of his experiments with potvtoes last sea- 
 son. Ilis ground was divided into squares of fourteen paces 
 each, making about the one twenty-fifth part of an acre. 
 The following is the yield : 

Lot No. 1. — The potatoes were covered with salt hay, a- 
 bout six inches thick, over the whole square. Yielded four 
 bushels. 

Lot No. 2. — The potatoes were covered with slaked lime; 
 then covered with soil, then spread half a bushel of salt 
 over the square. Y'ielded four bushels. 

Lot-No. 3 — The potatoes were covered with soil, then a 
 coating of lime on the top. Yielded four and a quarter 
 bushels. 

Lot No. 4. — -The potatoes were placed in the hills on the 
 lime, and then covered with soil. Yielded four and a quar- 
 ter bushels. 

Lot No. 5. — First put a shovel full of tan in the hill, then 
 the potatoes on the tan, and covered with soil. Yielded 
 four and three quarters bushels. 

Lot No. 6. — Put a shovel full of barn manure, from the 
 stall where my oxen were kept, and covered with soil. 
 Yielded four bushels — the poorest lot in the field. 

Lot No. 7. — Dropped the potatoes and threw a shovel full 
 of tan upon them, and then covered with soil. Yielded four 
 and a half bushels.
