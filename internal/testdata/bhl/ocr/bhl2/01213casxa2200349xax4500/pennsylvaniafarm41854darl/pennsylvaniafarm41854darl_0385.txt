Lot No. 8. — Dropped the potatoes and throw a shovel full 
 of meadow mud upon them, and then covered with soil. 
 Yielded four bushels. 

Lot No. 9. — The same as No. 8, with the potatoes dropped 
 on the mud. Yielded four bushels. 

The potatoes in Nos. 5 and 7 were up a week before the 
 others. 

In most of the parcels, except where the tan was used, 
 there were found more or less of defective potatoes. Those 
 that grew in tan were larger, smoother, and of better qual- 
 ity than the others. 

New Varieties of the Grape. 

We o-xtract the following description of two new varieties 
 of Grapes produced by J. F. Allen of Salem, Mass., from 
 the Boston Cultivator: 

One is a white grape produced by a cross of exotic and va- 
 riety on the Isabella. This has been exhibited at the meet- 
 ings of the Massachusetts Horticultural Society this year, 
 end it? quality has been unanimously pronounced delicious. 
 The skin is thin and tender, the seeds few and small, with 
 no hardness of pulp, and the flavor very sweet and luscious, 
 without any foxinesa. It is about the size of the Isabella. 
 Mr. A's other seedling is purple. It is not so sweet as the 
 former, but sweet enough for many palates, and of a very 
 high, vinous flavor. It is of medium size, and globular form. 

These varieties have been produced in a cold vinery. 
 Either of them are ten days or two weeks earlier than the 
 Isabella grown in the same situation. They are now to be 
 tried in the open air, and should they succeed here, they 
 will be a great acquisition.
