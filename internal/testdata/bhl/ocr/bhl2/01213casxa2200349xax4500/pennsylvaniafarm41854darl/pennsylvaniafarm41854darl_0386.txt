a capital horse. 20. "Morgan Eagle," L. Dyer, Youngs- 
 town, Ohio. 

Tho first premium was awarded to "Champion," James D. 
 <t Thomas Ladd, Richmond, Ohio. 

There were so many other good horses, that the Ju^lgea 
 found it impossible to make a selection for a second pre- 
 mium, and therefore none was awarded, 

LADIES RIDING. 

This lasted one hour — from 12 M. to 1 — and interested 
 the people more than any other portion of tlie exhibition. 
 Tho riders were Mrs. C. H. Cornwell and IVIiss Ileaton, of 
 Salem, Miss Do Ett Pclton, of Gustavu?, Trumbull county, 
 Ohio, Miss Peebles, of Now Castle, Pa., Mrs. Eckhart, of 
 AVooster, and Mrs. Eunice Hall, of New Lyme, x\sbtabula 
 county, Ohio. They all rode well, but Mrs. Cornwell and 
 Miss Pelton rode with an ease and daring, which I never 
 saw equalled. Miss Pelton rode a "G iffbrd Morgan" stallion, 
 out of a Messenger mare, which she had trained herself, 
 lie would obey every motion of his rider instantly. Mrs. 
 CJornwell rode an Arabian stallion, that was as lieautiful as 
 a picture and fleet as the wind, but he was not near so well 
 trained as Miss Pelton's. 

THOROUGH BRED Sl'ALLIONS — EIGHT KNTRIES. 

1. ''Hastings Morgan," E. B. Hastings, Hanoverton, Ohio. 
 2. "Clay Trustee," John V. Pierce, Lancaster, Ohio. He is 
 a magnificent horse, 16;^ hands high, and took the Irst pre- 
 miums last year at the Ohio State Fair. 3. "Napoleon," J. 
 B. Welsh, Boavor, Pa. 4. "May Day, Jr.," Samuel Sillim, 
 New Waterford, Columbir.na county, Ohio. -5. "Consterna- 
 tion," A. K. Milan, Dalton, Wayne county, Ohio, dark, four 
 years old. Sire old Consternation, dam Messenger mare. 
 6. "Virginia Dudley," W. T. Ingfritz, Dalton, Ohio. 7. 
 "Black Hav/k," Isaac J. Thomas, 14 years old. 8. John 
 Byrns, New Lisbon, Ohio. 

The iirst premium was .awarded to Clay Trustee. No sec- 
 ond premium was awarded, for want of satisfactory pedigree 
 — although the animals were — many of them — superior. 

THOROUGH RltED MARES — FIVE ENTRIES. 

1. Premium, Levi Mills, West Liberty, Va. 2. A. M. 
 Wilson, Mahoning county, Ohio. 

TROTTING HORSES- — FIFTEEN ENTRIES. 

1. "Old Joe," G. W. Wilson, Canton, Ohio. 2. "Spile 
 Driver," John Fee, Bloomfield, Ohio. 

Many of the trotters were fine animals ; this was especial- 
 ly so with a four year old sorrel mare, belonging to D. B. 
 Updigraff, Mount Pleasant, Ohio. An iron grey horse, call- 
 ed "Bob," and owned in Salem, is a fine trotter. The best 
 time made was 3.03. — Ohio Farmer. 

Bucks County Agricultural Society. 

The following is the repoi-t of the Committee on Field 
 Crops of the Bucks County Agricultural Society : 

They deem it a matter of surprise and regret, that, not- 
 withstanding the good farming and general success of the 
 crops the present season through this section, wo have been 
 called upon to inspect but one set of crops, viz: those on the 
 farm of Mr. William Stavely, consisting of one field of wheat, 
 and two of corn. As we consider the aforesaid crops of su- 
 perior growth and quality, we here insert his mode of cul- 
 ture, for the benefit of the agricultural community: 

First, A field of Mediterranean wheat, consistinc,- of twenty- 
 two acres, oats stubble fallow, heavily manured, and plowed 
 in during the month of Augvist. plowed a second time about 
 the middle of September, and drilled in at the rate of one- 
 and-a-half bushels per acre. We estimate the average yield 
 at thirty bushels per acre, and award him tho first premium 
 of $5. 

Second, A field of corn, (on the Street Road,) containing 

about twenty-two acres, w.asan old sod, and was plowed in 
 the fall to the depth of about nine inches. One-half was 
 manured in the fall before plowing; the other half was ma- 
 nured after plowing, in the spring, and well harrowed in. 
 The whole was then ridged, and planted on the 13th of May, 
 throe by four foot, four stalks in a hill. Although the crop 
 is evidently cut off from ten to fifteen bushels per acre on 
 account of the storm which passed over it during the month of 
 July, and the severe drought of the latter part of the season, 
 yet tho committee fully agree in estimating the average yield 
 at 70 bushels per acre, for which they award the first pre- 
 mium of $5. 

Third, A field of corn, containing about twenty acres, 
 Was an old sod of six years' standing, principally of natural 
 grass; about one-half plowed in the fall, the remainder in the 
 spring. It was furrowed but one way, and planted, about 
 three by four feet, on the 6th of May. As this field had not 
 the advantage of manure, we consider it fully equal, in pro- 
 portion to the cost of cultivation, to tho field first noticed, 
 and estimate the average yield at fifty-five bushels per acre. 

The best product was from tho fall plowing. 

The committee concur in opinion that the extraordinary 
 success which Mr. Stavely met with the present season in 
 growing corn, is in a great measure attributable to his mode 
 of deep ploughing,

Bedford County Agricultural Fair. 

The third annu.al fair of the Bedford County Agricultural 
 Society was held at Bedford, on tho ISth, 19th, and 20th of 
 October. We condense the following notice from the Inqui- 
 rer and Chronicle :^ The Exhibition, considering tho 
 drought, and generally unfavorable season, was very credit- 
 able, and equal in many respects to any of the former ones. 
 It brought together a vast concourse of people from all parts 
 of the county, and cheerful countenances and friendly greet- 
 ings were witnessed everywhere. 

Tho exhibition of stock was quite creditable. The dis- 
 play of draft, harness, and saddle horses, colts, brood-mares, 
 itc, giving evidence that in this respect tho farmers of Bed- 
 ford County will not long be behind those of any other 
 county in tho Commonwealth. Several fine teams also 
 were entered, as will appear more full}' in the report of the 
 committee. The display of cattle, whilst perhaps equal to 
 former years, is still not what it might be, and what we 
 should like to see it. The Cotswold and Southdown sheep 
 were of reasonable quality. The hogs chiefiy consisted of 
 Berkshire and Chester breeds, and some most beautiful pigs 
 owned by Mr. Wm. Hartley were on exhibition.

New Castle County Fair. 

Want of room prevented us noticing the annual exhibition 
 of the New Castle (Delaware) County Exhibition, which 
 was held in the city of Wilmington on the day of Oc- 
 tober. The display, although highly creditable, was not in 
 all reo^ects what we had expected, and what we think New 
 ^ustle county farmers should have made. There were sev- 
 eral fine horses on the ground, among which we noticed 
 some Morgan Bl.ack Hawks that would have graced even a 
 Vermont fair. As an offset to these we saw a mare and colt 
 — the former of which was far, very far, on the downhill of 
 life, and, as a necessary consequence, the latter languid and 
 emaciated. Surely no one but the owner could have sup- 
 posed them worth a premium. 

Among tho neat cattle, the Dovons were the most nume- 
 rous, and some of them were truly splendid animals. There
