wore also a fow fine Durhams. Little attention was paid to 
 sheep and swiuo. The vegotablo, produce and domestic do- 
 partraents oontainod some superior articles, but the variety 
 was limited. The implomout department was very fine. 
 The difTerLTit agricultural warehouses in Wilmin^'tou exhib- 
 ited numbers of the best and most vnluablo implements in 
 use, most of which were finished in an elegant manner. We 
 do not remember to have seen as large a display of imple- 
 ments at anj' otlior exUibitiou this season, except at the 
 State Pair, and from the attention bestowed upon them, they 
 were far from being the least observed articles on the 
 ground.

 have all been well represented.

I Westmoreland County Agricultural Fair. 

I The third annual fair of the Westmoreland County Agri- 
 j cultural Society was held at Greensburg on the 11th, 12th 
 [ and 13th d:iys of October. The array of horses, neat cattlff 
 j of the improved breeds, sheep and swine, was highly credit- 
 i able. The ladies' department was particularly Mne. The 
 display of vegetables, fruit, &c., was good for the .•reason, but 
 I not whi't might be looked for in a more favorable year, 
 j The Hdn. R. R. Reed, of Washington, Pa., delivered an ad- 
 I dress repieta with information and good sense. Our friends 
 in Wostmorelnnd may congratulate themselves on the suc- 
 cess of their third eflbrt of the kind. We trust to be pree- 
 '. ent at their next exhibition, .and report in per on oi:r notions 
 I of the merits of articles on the ground. 

Porry County Agricultui'al Fair. 
 The third annual fair of the Perry County Agricultur.al 
 Society was held at Bloomficld on the ISth, 19th and 20th 
 days of October. The attendance was large. We append 
 the following notice from the Frecmayt : "There was quite a 
 praiseworthy display of horses, cattle, farming implements, 
 manufactured articles, Ac. The excessive drought of the 
 season, which withered and dried up all kinds of vegetable 
 matter, caused a great falling off since last year's fair in the 
 voget.able and cereal dej)artmont. But notwithstanding all 
 this, the fair exceeded the expectations of its managers in 
 quality and quantity of all things exhibited. In a pecuni- 
 ary point of view, it exceeded all previously formed expec- 
 tations, and demonstrated that, with a proper care and ju- 
 dicious attention to its interests, the agriculturists and me- 
 chanics of Perry county can make their annual exhibitions 
 a "fixed fact" and a permanent institution." 

McKoan County Agricultural Fair. 
 The annual exhibition of this Society was hoM .at Smeth- 
 port on the 4th and 5th of October. The array of animals 
 and articles was quite imposing. It is but recently tliat the 
 farmers in McKean have turned their attention to improving 
 their stock. Wo trust by another j'e.ir, or two at the farthest, 
 a number of noble Durhams and Devons Will take the place 
 of some of the native stock recently shown at the fair. 
 Many of the articles on exhibition were ti-ul}' very fine, and 
 on the whole our friends in McKe.-in xnay take credit to 
 themselves for their effort. 

Cumberland County Agricultural Fair. 
 We have looked in vain for some account of the .annual 
 exhibition of the Cumberland County Agricultural Society. 
 We have been informed that it was a verj' fine one, but 
 neither the communication promised, or even a paper con- 
 taining the report, have yet reached us. Perhaps our breth- 
 ren of the press .at Carlisle had so many culls for copies, that 
 they had to give their exchanges the go-by.

Carmichaelstown (Greene County) Fair. 
 We learn from the Waynesburg Eayle that tlie display of 
 live stock, gi-ain, fruits and manufactured articles, were ex- 
 cellent. Greene county has the soil and the citizens to ren- 
 der it a rich agricultural country, but they need the influ- 
 ence of a few hundred copies of the Furtn JounmH-o awaken 
 thom to the advantages they possess. 

Nortiiumberland County Agiicultiiral Fair. 

The annnal exhibition of the Northumberl.and County 
 Agricultural Society was held at Shamokin, on the 17th of 
 October. The display in many respects was very fine, par- 
 ticularly in the poultry department. Our friend David Tag- 
 gart, Esq., who has done so much to draw public attention 
 to the utility of improvement in fowls, had one hundred and 
 sixty specimens on the ground. We learn from the list of 
 jiremiums, that D.avid Haas took the premium for the best 
 st.allion ; Wm. M. Marshall for best mares ; A. R. Fisk for 
 best single horse; S. .John for the be.it bulls and cows; and 
 Samuel Slenkcr for best oxen. The premium list for grain, 
 vegetables, fruits, implements, dairy, domestic manufactures 
 and miscellaneous articles, indicates that those departmontB 
 were .all well represented. 

Horatio G. Taggart has been appointed Treasurer of the 
 Society. 

Northampton County Agricultural Fair. 
 The second annual fair, recently held at Nazareth, was 
 highly creditable to the Society. Some dissensions had 
 been occasioned by the location, and it was feared by many 
 that both the display and attendance would bo small. The 
 Society has reason to congr.itulate itself, however, on both
