tho quantity and quality of tho articles oxliibitod, and on 
 the numbers of visitors. We have been assured that many 
 of the animals and articles deposited possessed very decided 
 merit. 

Sullivan County Agricultural Fair. 
 The Sullivan County Agricultural Fair was held at La- 
 porto on the 3d of November. The day was unfavorable 
 for exhibiting animals, and coini)arativeIy few were on tho 
 ground. The produce department of tho exhibition was 
 held in a hall, and this part of the display appears to have 
 been very good. The Sullivan County Democrat states that 
 potatoes, beets, turnips, squashes, <tc., &c., wore fine and in 
 large quantities. In running over the premiums awarded, 
 we perceived that tho number of articles of domestic and 
 other m.anufacturos was quite laige. The exhibition ex- 
 ceeded the expectation of its friends, which is saying a good 

deal.

Clarion County Agricultural Fair. 
 The Clarion County Agricultural Society held their first 
 annual e.xhibition on the 17th of October. Tho display and 
 attendance exceeded the most sanguine hopes of tho society. 
 The fresh flowers, vegetables and domestic manufactures were 
 all excellent. Many of the horses were exceedingly fine. 
 On the whole our friends in Clarion are more than pleased 
 with this their experimental exhibition, and they are satis- 
 fied they can maintain their organization.

Munich, August, 1851 
 A day spent in the Agricultur.al department of the Ex- 
 hibition of German Industry at this place, I trust will ena 
 ble me to furnish some material upon this subject, that may 
 be interesting to your readers. The general exhibition eai- 
 braces such articles as are appropriate to its name, which 
 are produced throughout the German states. The building 
 is glass similar to that of the Now York exhibition, and the 
 quantity and quality of materials exhibited were not far in- 
 ferior to those of that city. But I shall confine my remarks 
 exclusively to the agricultural department. A cursory ex- 
 amination of the articles served to confirm vrhat almost ^v- 
 ery thing I see in Germany suggests, that we have more to 
 loam from them of scientific agriculture, of the proper use 
 and application of manures, the methods of collecting, man- 
 ufacturing, and preserving them, than we have of the con- 
 struction of materials with which to perform the labor of the 
 farm. Tho difference in the kind of land, the price of labor 
 and the method of farming by organised communities ren- 
 der many of their utensils useless to the American farmer. 

They have wheat drills to go by hand instead of horse- 
 power. Feed grinding and threshing machines turned in 
 the same way, none of which our farmers would think of a- 
 dopting with our system of wages. 

Their ploughs and harrows are not at all adapted to 
 stumpy or rocky land. Iron fr.amed spike-toothed harrows 
 with teeth made of three quarter or five eighth inch iron, 
 and tho frame even lighter in proportion. Wooden framed 
 spike-toothed harrows with the teeth curving around and 
 pointing forwards ; it would bo impossible to clean them 
 from roots, Ac., by raising the harrow as is usually done. 

I saw nothing to correspond to our common hoe-harrow, 
 so indispensable in working corn ; but something of similar 
 shape though t-en times as heavy and strong, with the same 
 namber of teeth or hoes; they appeared to bo adapted to 

four horses and are most probably used to tear up such 
 ground as our oat stubble or cornstalk instead of plowing it. 
 But the iizc of the beam required renders them objectionable. 

The number and variety of ploughs exhibited were quite 
 large. Holland supplied a great number, or rather tho ma- 
 kers of difl"oront parts of Germany, supplied tho Holland ar- 
 ticle. Nono of them have much more resemblance to oar 
 ordinary ploughs than if not made for a similar purpose. 
 A very sKall short mouldboard .and short wrought iron share 
 roughly made, and with or without a cutter attached t^o tho 
 beam. Tho bar-share plough having tho coulter on its 
 point was not here; sovoral mouldboards were without twist, 
 and set perpendicularly on the ground; they were made to 
 regulate so as to stand nearer square (as in a Wiley) or more 
 slantingly as (in a barshare) to tho furrow, or beam, if we use 
 it for comparison; but as in all ploughs with moveable moul- 
 boards the strength was sacrificed to the desire to get motion. 

As one with some experience both in making and dressing 
 plow irons, and in using and in seeing them used when made, 
 I would venture to assert, that tho plough department pre- 
 sented nothing to American farmers, equal to what they 
 now pososs in their Prouty, their modification of Wiley, and 
 the well made good old barshare Ac, Ac., yet it would bo 
 deeply interesting to an American farmer to see what they 
 use hero, to carry on his occupation ; a great many of the 
 ploughs have but one handle; tho end of tho beam, indeed 
 almost the entire length of it to the cutter, is ironed like the 
 tongue of a wagon, or cart, and through this iron at every 
 four or five inches are holes, which fit around corresponding 
 holes in tho beam. Tho latter is straight and nearly round. 
 It extends forwards, and raises so that the end of tho beam 
 is six or eight inches higher than the part bearing tho cut- 
 ter. A little axle-tree with two low wheels pass under the 
 beam to which it is pinned, at distances from the end of the 
 latter corresponding to the depth to which the ploughman 
 wishes to run bis plough. 

Horse rakes were very indifferent. The principal struc- 
 ture of tho winnowing mills ("fans") for cleaning grain was 
 bad. They were heavy, clumsy, high, and very long and 
 narrow. They had one improvement that I never saw in 
 our American article. I think it is good, and could be easi- 
 ly introduced. A rod of iron was made to slip back and 
 forth across the fan a short distance behind the hopper, or 
 that part of the hopper through which the grain passes on to 
 the riddle. On this rod were welded three iron rods that 
 extended into this part of the hopper at right angles to the 
 principal rod. The motion of the principal rod being al- 
 ways tho reverse of the moveable bottom of the hopper, 
 causes these rods that are welded to it to stir up the chaff, 
 and hastens its passage through, as is sometimes done by tho 
 farmer's hand when the hopper is clogged, as often happens 
 with not vor}' well raked wheat ch.afi". The motion is com- 
 municated to this rod in the same waj- that it is to tho rid- 
 dles in our American fans. If manufacturers would think 
 of this small improvement, I think they might introduce it 
 with profit. 

Corn shellors, straw cutters, pumps, guano spr-eading ma- 
 chine, butter churns, <tc., <fcc., presented some peculiarities 
 but no extra qualities. Apparatus for testing the quality of 
 milk, tho amount of cream it will produce, Ac, will bo in- 
 teresting to Americau dairymen when they become chemists, 
 and keep a small labratory to investigate milk, and tho 
 changes produced upon it by different kinds of food, as is 
 done hero. Such apparatus was also here in considerable 
 quantity. 

A machine for making clay pipe of any desired length, I 
 think would prove good in America. Its structure is simple, 
 and any common hand could make the pipe. E. P,
