STRODE' S HYDEATJIIC RAM. 

The above drawing represents an Improved Hydraulic 
 Ram, for which a patent was granted to J. C. Strode, of 
 West Chester, in the State of Pennsylvania, on the 29th 
 of August, 1854. The improvement consists in such an 
 an-angement of the puppet valve, that as the puppet 
 valve rises, the water enclosed between the top of the 
 puppet valve and the valve seat is made fo escape at the 
 side of the puppet valve down into the valve cliam- 
 ber. 

The drawing represents a vertical section through the 
 air chamber B, and the puppet valve and valve chamber 
 K represents the puppet valve on its spindle 11. G G is 
 is the top of the valve chamber. The valve K has a re- 
 cess a a extending around the upper portion. The re- 
 cess a a slides in perfect contact like a piston within the 
 surface b b, in the top G G. The surface f f is not cy- 
 lindrical but slightly conical or tapering; the top of the 

taper given to f f. It should be a very smÂ»Il passage, 
 so that the water shall escape slowly, and thus offer a 
 gi-aduated and regular resistance to the ascent of the 
 puppet valve to its seat, and so prevent the shock of the 
 puppet valve K against its upper scat b b. As soon a? 
 tlie puppet valve has reached its upper seat and begins 
 to fall, the water finds its way slowly between f f and 
 g g, and thus prevents the formation of a vacuiun be- 
 tween the valve K and its upper seat. Thus the valve 
 K falls without sticking. By this improvement Mr. 
 Strode claims to attain a much liigl*er per ccntnge of 
 useful cifect than has been obtained, by any ram hereto- 
 fore in use. 

J. C. Strode had previously m.%de another improve- 
 ment in i'am valves for a similar purpose. In this im- 
 provement he connected the upper valve seat by a tube 
 with the lower part of the air cltjinibcr, so that the shock 

valve seat at g g is also made tapering at g g, so that as j of the valve is transferred directly to the air chamber. 

the puppet valve rises towards its upper seat a small 
 nnnular passage will be left open between f f and g g, 
 through which the water ordinarily retained by the re- 
 cess a a may escape back into the valve chamber. Tlie 
 velocity of this escape can be regulated by the degree of 

and thus was avoided. A scries of small vertical tubes 
 opening to the air. with valves kept closed by a spring, 
 adm't nir and jrevent the valve from sticking. This 
 improvoment was patented .May 2:>d, 18o4.
