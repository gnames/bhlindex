engender positive disease. An animal going from such 
 an atmosphere into the pure fresh air would, of course, 
 very naturally at first shiver, which is understood to be 
 a sign that they cannot bear the cold, and the confine- 
 ment is made more rigorous. What is considered some- 
 times also a great improvement is the introduction of 
 water in pipes within the stables, so that the poor animals 
 can have it convenient in their very mangers. This de- 
 prives them of their only chance of a little pure air once 
 a day while being turned out for water. 

Cows and calves suffer most especially from this mis- 
 taken kindness, and we believe it is sometimes the cause 
 of abortion. We prefer our stock to be, during the 
 whole twenty-four hours, except while eating, in the 
 open yard, fronting the south, and sheltered on the north 
 and east sides by good shedding. If kept well littered, 
 as all barn-yards ought to be, they greatly prefer it to 
 warm unwholesome stables, and go out to pasture in 
 spring in much finer condition. 

We intended the above remarks for neat cattle, but 
 they are still more true with respect to sheep. To these 
 a confined atmosphere is almost certain death. 

To Save Hay and Fodder. 

Owing to the extreme drought in many sections, and 
 consequent short pastures, farmers have had to com- 
 mence foddering their stock much sooner than usual. 
 Should the winter prove severe, the supplies of proven- 
 der will, we fear, be found short. It is, therefore, im- 
 portant to economise as much as possible, and if there 
 are any of our readers who still have doubts about the 
 economy of cutting hay, corn stalks, &c., we would now 
 urge them to make trial of the plan, and let us hear 
 from them in the spring. At the price hay is selling, a 
 good cutter can be bought for little more than the price 
 of half a ton, and we doubt whether next spring they 
 would part with it for many times its cost. We believe 
 it would save them several tons of hay and fodder. It 
 saves in various ways, first, by preventing any ivaste. 
 The stock cannot drag cut feed, as they would long hay 
 or straw, out of their mangers or boxes, and destroy it 
 undt-r their feet. Secondly, they will reject when whole 
 much that they will cat freely when cut up or crushed, 
 and moistened. Thirdly, cut feed presents more points 
 in the stomach to the action of the gastric juice, 
 and is much easier digested. Men and animals are alike 
 in this particular. Our ow'n food, swallowed without 
 mastication, is only partly digested, and does not yield 
 the nutriment it otherwise would. Fourthly, animals 
 masticate their food with less labor when cut, and have 
 more time to rest. 

In addition to cutting up their food, we would also 
 recommend the free use of the cattle card. This is 
 grateful to the animal, promotes the free circulation of 
 the blood, and consequent thrift. It is particularly ad- 
 visable for young stock and fattening animals, and will 
 benefit them as much as it ynW horse flesh. As regaixls 
 the question, which is the best cutter for hay and straw 
 among the multitude of patents, it is really difficult to 
 decide. Farmers have had the opportunity of judging 
 for themselves at the late exhibitions. In -New England, 
 where all the new patents have mostly sprung from, we 
 are informed the raw hide cylinder cutters are most in 

demand. We have seen none better made, and which 
 gave promise of durability as well as rapidity of cutting, 
 equal to the Hovey pattern, described page 104 in our 
 March number. One farmer informs us he has had one 
 in use for four years, and it works as well as ever. 
 They are sold at prices from $6 60 to $26, the latter 
 being adapted for horse power, and said to be capable of 
 cutting nearly a ton of hay per hour. Large and more 
 powerful machines, adapted also for fodder, are Pott's 
 cutter and crusher, an excellent article, Daniel's, Sin- 
 clair's, Whittemore's, Catchpole, and many others, which 
 have been adverted to previously in the Journal 

"Work for the Month. 

Farm. — When it is at all practicable, ground intended 
 for next years com crop should be plowed and subsoiled, 
 especially on heavy soils, that the frost may be permitted 
 to do its part in mellowing and pulverizing. It is well 
 known that teams are much more able to stand the con- 
 tinuous draft of the plow at this season, than in the 
 spring, notwithstanding the ground may be more com- 
 pact and require greater force to break it up. In this 
 connection, we say that the Michigan double plow is bet- 
 ter adapted to plowing sod than any other in use. Stock 
 should be now well attended to, as it is far more easy to 
 keep them in a thriving condition than to get them into 
 it. The stables should be well ventilated and kept free 
 from an accumulation of manure. A few minutes each 
 morning will suffice to "clean" a large stable; but if the 
 manure is sufi"ercd to accumulate for a week or more, it 
 will require hours, while the health of the animals will 
 be promoted or impaired, as the one or the other of these 
 practices prevail. Cattle should have free access to 
 water during the day. A lump of rock salt should also 
 be at hand for them to lick at pleasure. Cows should be 
 supplied with a few beets, carrots, or turnips each day. 
 If the last is fed, the tap roots should be cut off as they 
 have a tendency to render the milk bitter. Give plenty 
 of litter, either straw or leaves, to all cattle, horses, sheep 
 and hogs. Economise hay and straw by use of straw- 
 cutter. Com fodder should also be cut, before feeding, 
 and if no steamer is at hand, empty the tough ends of the 
 stalks, or buts, which will generally be refused by the 
 cattle, into a large hogshead, into which pour boiling 
 water, and cover the top. After being softened by this 
 process, feed with a little bran or meal sprinkled over. 
 Have the manure, as it accumulates, collected under a 
 rough shed in the middle of the barn yard, and occasion - 
 ly throw some muck from swamps, or soil over it, also 
 sprinkle with plaster. The drainage should be collected 
 at one side or end, and frequently pumped or poured 
 over the heap. Manure saved in this way is worth at 
 least four times as much as if suffered to be scattered 
 over the barn yard. Avoid turning cattle in pasture 
 fields in "soft weather." Open drains, ditches, &c., that 
 the superabundant water may be carried off without oc- 
 casioning gullies, &c. See that all implements are prop- 
 erly housed. When the ground is frozen haul fuel, and 
 h.avc it properly prepared for the fire and kept under 
 cover.
