frozen. Take advantage of open weather, to prepare for 
 spring planting, by deep plowing and subsoiling. Where 
 the object of pruning young trees is to promote growth, 
 now is the proper time. The amount of food collected by 
 roots through winter is thus confined to the remaining 
 branches instead of being distributed throughout the tree 
 and lost. 

Flower Garden. — The principal work for the garden 
 this month, will be cleaning borders and removing decay- 
 ed plants and weeds, renewing walks, tying up to stakes 
 and protecting half hardy plants and shrubs. Running 
 roses should be secured firmly to their stakes or trellisses, 
 to preserve them from being broken by storms. Chroma- 
 tellas, Solfatares, and similar roses not perfectly hardy, 
 should be well covered with straw or cedar boughs. Teas 
 and other dwarf varieties may be protected with cedar 
 boughs tied together at the top. Mulch well all roses and 
 plants with short manure. Tie up junipers and other 
 bushes with straggling branches. 

Persons wishing early blooming plants in the spring 
 may keep them through the winter in cold frames. Dig 
 out a hole a foot deep of the size required, and fit in a 
 box, sloping to the south if possible, two feet deep at 
 back and 18 inches in front, bank up the earth from the 
 hole on the outside, lay a bed of coal ashes in the bottom, 
 to make the drainage and prevent ingress of worms. 
 Cover with sash, and protect in severe weather with straw 
 mats and shutters. Verbenas, Primroses, Polyanthus, 
 Pansies, Petunias, &c., will keep nicely in this way, and 
 bloom eaj-ly. 

See that plants in windows are not killed with water- 
 ing. The only rule for this, is appearance of soil in pots. 
 Water only when it appears dry. Keej) them near the 
 light and turn round occasionally. The farther plants are 
 from the light the less water they require. Change the 
 water in hyacinth glasses, everj' week or ten days 

Vegetable Garden. — Attend to directions of last 
 month. Finish covering with straw or litter everything 
 that needs pi-otection. Commence composting manures, 
 ^0 as to prepare them for spring use. Attend to arrang- 
 ing and securing all such seeds as will be required for 
 spring planting. 

Domestic Recipes. 
 Temperance Mince-Meat. — Take three pounds of 
 the lean of a round of fresh beef, that has been boiled 
 the day before. It must be thoroughly boiled, and very 
 tender. Mince it, as finely as possible, with a chopping 
 knife ; and add to it two pounds of beef-suet, cleared 
 from the skin and filaments, and minced very small. 
 Mix the suet and the lean beef well together ; and add 
 a pound of brown sugar. Pick, wash, and dry before 
 the fire, two pounds of Zante currants. Seed and chop 
 two pounds of the best raisins. Sultana raisins have no 
 seeds, and are therefore the most convenient for all 
 cookery purposes. Grate the yellow rind of three large 
 lemons or oranges into a saucer, and squeeze upon it 
 their juice, through a strainer. Mix this with the cur- 
 rants and raisins. Prepare a heaped-up table-spoonful 
 of powdered cinnamon ; the same quantity of powdered 
 ginger ; a heaped tea-spoonful of powdered nutmeg ; the 
 same of powdered cloves ; and the same of powdered 
 mace. Mix all these spices into a quart of the best 

West India molasses. Then mix well together the meat 
 and the fruit ; and wet the whole with the spiced mo- 
 lasses ; of which you must have enough to make the 
 mixture very moist, but not too thin. If you want the 
 mince-meat for immediate use, add to it four pounds of 
 minced apple. The apples for this purpose should be 
 pippins or belle-fleurs, pared, cored, quartered, and 
 chopped fine. Add, also, half a pound of citron, not 
 minced, but cut into long slips. 

If you intend the mince-meat for keeping, do not add 
 the apple and citron until you are about to make the 
 pies, as it will keep better without them. Mix all the 
 other articles thoroughly, and pack down the mince- 
 meat, hard, in sinall stone jars. Lay upon the top of it 
 a round of thin white paper, dipped in molasses, and 
 cut exactly to fit the inside circumference of the jar. 
 Secure the jars closely with fiat, tight-fitting corks, and 
 then with a lid ; and paste paper down over the top on 
 the outside. 

West India molasses will be found a good substitute 
 for the wine and brandy generally used to moisten 
 mince-meat. 

Indian Crumpets. — A quart of Indian meal. — Half a 
 pint of wheat floui*. — A quart of milk. — A heaping salt- 
 spoonful of salt. — Three eggs. — Two large table-spoon- 
 fuls of strong fresh yeast. — Warm the milk. Sift the 
 Indian meal and the flour into a pan, and mix them well. 
 Then stir them into the milk, a handful at a time ; add- 
 ing the salt. Beat the eggs very light in another pan, 
 and then stir them, gradually, into the milk and meal. 
 Lastly, add the yeast. Stir the whole well ; then cover 
 it, and set it to rise in a warm place, such as a corner of 
 the hearth. When it has become very light, and is cov- 
 ered with bubbles, have the griddle ready heated to be- 
 gin to bake the cakes; first greasing the griddle. For 
 each crumpet pour on a large ladle-full of batter. 
 Send them to table several on a plate, and as hot as pos- 
 sible. Eat them with butter, to which you may add mo- 
 lasses or honey. 

If the batter should chance to become sour by stand- 
 mg too long, you may remedy it by stirring in a level 
 tea-spoonful of pearlash, soda, or saleratus, dissolved in 
 a very little lukewarm water. Then bake it. 

Corn Meal Breakfast Cakes. — A quart of Indian 
 meal. — A handful, or more, of wheat flour. — A large 
 salt-spoon of salt. — A quart of warm water. — An addi- 
 tional pint of lukewarm water. — A bit of pearlash the 
 size of a hazle-nut, or the same quantity of soda or sal- 
 eratus. Mix over night, in a large pan, the Indian 
 meal, the wheat flour and salt. Pour on gradually a 
 quart of warm water, (warm but not hot,) and stir it in 
 with a large wooden or iron spoon, so as to form a very 
 soft dough. Cover the pan, and set it on the dresser 
 till morning. In the morning thin the dough with an- 
 other pint of warm water, so as to make it into a batter, 
 having first dissolved in the water a salt- spoonful of 
 powdered pearlash or saleratus, or a bit the size of a 
 hazel-nut. Beat the mixture hard. IChen covel it, and 
 let it stand near the fire for a quarter of an hour before 
 you begin to bake it. Bake it in thin cakes on a griddle. 
 Send them to table hot, and eat them with butter, and 
 molasses or honey. 

Stewed Beef's '^ongue. — Take a fresh beef's tongue
