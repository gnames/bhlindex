THE FARM JOURNAL. 

[December 

most productive aud biglily cultivated districts that can 
 be found in the Union. 

After "crossing the mountains," or about 150 miles 
 east of Pittsburgh, the road enters the valley of the Ju- 
 niata river and follows its windings to its confluence witli 
 the Susquehanna. There are many fertile slopes and 
 fine farms with substantial old dwellings and spacious 
 barns along the Juniata; but the greater portion of the 
 land, especially a little distance from the river appears 
 too poor and hilly to be worth cultivating. On approach- 
 ing the Susquehanna the prospect rapidly improves,- and 
 the barren hills are less frequently seen, while fine farms 
 and frequent towns along the valley bespeak fertility 
 aud wealth. 

Our train of cars failing to connect at Harrisburg gave 
 us half a day for inspecting that place and its vicinity. 
 The city is not as large as we expected to find the capi- 
 tal of the State — not more than half as large as Colum- 
 bus — and has but few public or private buildings de- 
 serving of notice. The Lunatic Asylum is a handsome 
 and spacious establishment, and the most conspicuous 
 building in the vicinit}'. The river, canal and railroad 
 I^assing right through the city, and the abundance of 
 coal and iron, give the place very good facilities for man- 
 ufactures. 

A short ride from Harrisburg brought us into the 
 county of Lancaster, which together with the adjoining 
 county of Chester, are so noted for fine farms and tho- 
 rough farmers, nor does the reality at all disappoint the 
 high anticipations of the ti-aveler, for certainly we have 
 no where else in America seen such general evidences of 
 thoroughness and skill in farming as here met our eyes. 
 The abundant yield of the corn crop just harvested, and 
 the sleek looking herds of cattle in the meadows, gave 
 proofs that the skillful labors of the farmers were well 
 rewarded, notwithstanding the general drought of the 
 season. 

Whfai culture is practiced here with more skill and in- 
 dustry than is often witnessed in Ohio, as was evinced 
 to us by the beautiful appearance of the newly sown 
 fields with the yo\ing wheat plants just appearing in green 
 rows and showing the almost universal use of the drill as 
 well as finest harrows and the roller. We noticed also 
 that very many of the wheat fields gave evidence of the 
 application of lime and other kinds of manure directly 
 for this crop, and we were told that the use of guano 
 and artificial manures is beginning to be practiced con- 
 siderably in the eastern part of the State, and more still 
 in New Jersey. ]\Iachines for spreading these manures 
 along with the seed, as done in England, are coming into 
 use here, aud are for sale at the implement stojes. 

The cosily barns for which the farmers of eastern Penn- 
 sylvania are every where noted, are a marked feature in 
 the agriculture of Lancaster and Chester couties, and 
 while we admit that many of our Ohio farmers are sadly 
 negligent in this respect, we could not avoid feeling that 
 much of the money spent on these structures here, might 
 have been used to better purpose. 

The value of good farming lands in eastern Pennsylva- 
 nia is much greater than Ohio, and moi-e of skill and labor 
 is bestowed on their cultivation. Clean and thorough 
 tillage, and a liberal use of manures are the essential ele- 
 ments of successful agriculture here, as all other coun- 

tries where the virgin fertility of the soil has been 
 exhausted. The natural fertility of the soil — its almost 
 spontaneous productiveness in our western States, is the 
 principal cause of the slow progress of scientific farming 
 amongst us. But the time will soon come, and now is, in 
 many parts, even of Ohio, where the farmers must till 
 their lands more scientifically or quit them, (as some of 
 them are now doing,) and give place to those who have 
 more intelligence and industry. 

From Philadelphia we took a ride to Germantown, to 
 visit our old friend, Jas. Gowen, Esq., whose farming and 
 fine cattle, &c., have been noticed in previous volumes 
 of this papei', and than whom we know not a more intel- 
 ligent agriculturist in the United States. His new dwel- 
 ling house at Mt. Airy, is one of the most beautiful and 
 perfect specimens of rural architecture to be found, and 
 the gardens and other surroundings all bespeak cultiva- 
 ted taste and skill, combined with wealth and a disposi- 
 tion to enjoy the blessings of rural life. We were glad 
 to find Mr. G., in better health than at the time of our 
 visit 3 or 4 years ago, and manifesting more of his form- 
 er enthusiasm in agricultural pui'suits. His farm, con- 
 sisting of over 100 acres, is in a high state of cultivation 
 and although not naturally rich, he manages to obtain 
 such crops as astonish those who witness them, and his 
 Durham cattle and white Berkshii-e pigs excite admira- 
 tion wherever exhibited. We have on former occasions 
 spoken of Mr. G.'s remarkable crops, and his method of 
 producing them, also of his extraordinary cows. 

Docking Horses Useless and Barbarous. 

We find the following in several of our exchanges 
 without credit, and without knowing its paternity most 
 cordially adopt it : 

We are glad to see that the abominable practice of 
 docking and nicking horses is getting out of fashion. It 
 prevails in no counti*y in the world but England and the 
 United States; we got it from the mother country and the 
 sooner we leave it off the better. It is wonderful how 
 anybody but an ignorant, narrow-minded block-head of 
 a jockey, should ever have thought of it, being as ofi'ensive 
 to good taste as a violation to every humane feeling. 
 Has nature done her work in such a bungling manner in 
 forming that paragon of animals, the horse, that he re- 
 quires to have a large piece of bone to be chopped off 
 with an axe, to reduce him to symmetry — or that beauty 
 and grace can be obtained only by cutting a pair of its 
 large muscles ? 

"The docking and nicking of horses," says an intelli- 
 gent writer on farriery, "is a cruel practice, and ought to 
 be abandoned by the whole race of mankind. Every hu- 
 man being posessed of a human heart and magnanimous 
 mind, must confess that both the docking and nicking of 
 horses is cruel; but that creature called man attempts thus 
 to mend the works of his Almighty, wise creator — in do- 
 ing which he often spoils and disfigures them. What is 
 more beautiful than a fine horse, with an elegant long 
 tail and flowing mane, waving in the sports of the wind, 
 and exhibiting itself in a perfect state of nature? Be- 
 sides, our Creator has given them to the horse for de- 
 fence as well as beauty. 

The same author relates an instance of a fine hunting 
 horse owned by an Englishman, which could carry his
