send you a drawing of the run-round, now in rig in my 
 yard for breaking colts. To the machine thus completed 
 I harness the colt, I care not how ugly or ungained, 
 buckling the pole strap so short that he will have no 
 slack harness ; then tying his halter to the cross-bar, I 
 pull off his bridle and let him have a fail* chance and his 
 own course. He never runs at fii'st, for fear of the 
 wheel before him, but alternately trots and stands still. 
 After the colt has been harnessed an hour or so, I seat 
 myself astride the rear pole at the point where the in- 
 ner end of the bar supporting the whipple-trec is at- 
 tached, when he generally stai-ts oflF at a rapid speed ; I 
 retain my seat until the colt comes to a stand, which is 
 alwaj's after he has been from six to twenty rounds. I 
 then feed him a handful of oats, and put a wisp of hay 
 in the rope which confines the pole strap, and leave him 
 to pursue his own course. He should be kept harnessed 
 in this way through the day, being visited frequently 
 with the oat dish, and supplied with hay, where he can 
 help himself at will. 

"The second day let the colt be bridled, with leading 
 lines attached, and feed a few oats as soon as harnessed, 
 then left for some time to promenade at his leisure, then 
 drove, and taught to start and stop at bidding. After 
 being drilled in this way for half an hour, make fast one 
 of the wheels to a post a little outside of the range, and 
 leave him for an hour or more, thus teaching him to 
 stand ; keep him harnessed through the day, occasion- 
 ally feeding, driving, backing, and teaching liim to stop 
 and to stand still, but using no harsh measures, for none 
 are needed. After three such days of training, I have 
 always succeeded in making a colt completely manage- 
 able, and hesitate not to take my wife on board a cutter 
 or wagon for a ride, having done so repeatedly. I con- 
 sider the above method for breaking colts cheap, safe, 
 expeditious and effectual, and those who have examined 
 the affair, say that a colt broken to go in that ma- 
 chine will go anywhere." 

The machine is so simple that any one can construct 
 it. 

CHOICE FRUITS. 

No. 1. — W.vxEN OR Gate, White Apple, Belmont. — 
 This very superior fruit, whose history for a while was 
 involved in much uncertainty, is now settled to be of 
 Pennsylvania origin, and will no doubt be found well 
 adapted to our soil and climate. It is more known in 
 Ohio than here from where it was first taken. We first 
 saw it at the National Pomological Convention in New 
 York, and were much attracted by its fine size and beau- 
 tiful appearance, having a clear skin, with a peculiar 
 waxy or oily appearance, and bright vcrmillion red cheek. 
 It is a most showy fruit, and from this no less than its 
 fine eating qualities, is worthy of extensive cultivation. 

Size, medium to large, form irregular, usually round- 
 ish, sometimes oblong rounded; skin thin, smooth glossy 
 or oily color, rich light clear yellow, with a clear vcrmil- 
 lion red cheek, with carmine spots; stem medium slender, 
 calyx small sometimes open, but often closed; baain shal- 

to deep fun-owed; /wA yellowish white, fine grained, very 
 tender, juicy sprightly sub-acid, core rather large; ripe 
 November to February. 

No 2. — llnoDE Island Greening. — This apple is wide- 
 ly known, and as universally esteemed, for its general 
 fair and smooth appearance, great productiveness, and 
 value either for the table or cooking. Thousands of 
 barrels are brought to Philadelphia market, from the 
 north and east, and probably no variety is much more 
 in demand. It seems to succeed well on all soils 
 and localities, the tree being a strong though rather 
 crooked grower. Our engraving is taken from Elliott, 
 but in the generality of specimens the stem we think is 
 somewhat curved, and thicker at the bottom. 

Fruit large, roundish, somewhat flattened; skin oily, 
 smooth dark green, pale or yellowish green when ripe 
 with a dull blush near the stem ; calyx small, wooly,
