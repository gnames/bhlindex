Some of the solidified milk which had been grated and 
 dissolved in water the evening previous, was found 
 covered with a rich cream. This skimmed ofiF was soon 
 converted into butter- Another solution was speedily 
 converted into wine whey, by a treatment precisely sim- 
 ilar to that employed in using ordinary milk. It fully 
 equaled the expectations of all, so that solidified milk 
 will hereafter rank among the necessary appendages of a 
 sick room. In fine this article makes paps, custards, 
 puddings and cakes, equal to the best milk ; and obtain- 
 ed from well pastured cattle, and not the produce of dis- 
 tillery slops; neither can it be watered. 

For our steamships, our packets, for those travelling 
 by land or by sea, for hotel purposes, or use in private 
 families, for young or old, we recommend it cordially 
 as a substitute for fresh milk. 

We look with interest for the scientific report of the 
 committee of the Academy of Medicine, in which we hope 
 for an exposition of the domestic culinary, and hygeienic 
 properties of solidified milk. 

Colic. 

The following remarks on colic are from Dr. Dadd's 
 "Modern Horse Doctor." They embody some new ideas 
 of this disease, which it may be well to consider : 

In nine cases out of ten, colic is the result of impaired 
 digestive organs; the food runs into fermentation, and 
 evolves carbonic acid gas. In view of prevention, then, 
 it becomes a matter of importance to know what are the 
 caxisfe of indigestion ; and the most frequent may be said 
 to be immoderate feeding — eating or drinking whatever 
 disagrees with the stomach, in regard to quantity or 
 quality. Every tyro in medicine knows that a drink of 
 hard water will often produce colic, both in man and 
 beast, provided the digestive functions shall be impaired. 
 Mr. White says, "When the Royal Dragoons were quar- 
 tered at Croydon, scarcely a day passed without one or 
 more horses being attacked with flatulent colic, and on 
 examining the water made use of in the barracks, it was 
 found remarkably hard." Our own experience confirms 
 this fact, for before the introduction of Cochituate water 
 into Boston, very many of our employer's horses were 
 frequently attacked with both flatulent and spasmodic 
 colic, which are now entirely free from it, since they use 
 pure soft water. 

The treatment should consist, first, in the use of diffu- 
 sible stimulants, (not alcoholic,) of a carminative nature, 
 such, for example, as grains of paradise, carraway seed, 
 ginger, &c. ; and these should be given in a liquid form. 
 Stimulants of a sanative nature are always indicated in 
 the treatment of colic ; for if the stomach be distended 
 with a load of semi-putrid food, how can we get rid of it 
 except by the ordinary way, when the parts are in a 
 healthy state ? IVlen have strangely erred in recommen- 
 ding medicine — castor oil, salts, aloes, opium, turpentine 
 &c. — for the colic, and, perhaps, we ourselves are not 
 free from blame in this matter. Experience, and nothing 
 else, has changed our views, and we give them for the 
 benefit of man and horse. "JEzperence is the only true 
 guide." 

We select the following case as an example of treat- 
 ment. The subject was a grey mare, seven years old, 
 remarkable for her capacious belly. The attack was 
 ushered in with the usual appearance of uneasiness. 
 We found her lying down, her legs gathered up groaning, 
 and lookijig anxiously round at the flanks. She would 
 occasionally roll on her back, but the abdomen was so 
 enormously distended with flatus, that it is with much 
 difficulty she could get on her side again. We commen- 
 ced the treatment with the following: — 

Powdered grains of paradise, 1 tea-spoonful. 

" caraway, J tea-spoonful. 

Oil of peppermint, 20 drops. 

Powdered slippery elm, 1 table-sijoonful. 

Hot water, 1 pint. 

These were mixed together and given from a bottle. An 
 injection of common soap suds was then thrown into the 
 rectum. In a few minutes the mare voided a mass of ex- 
 crement, accompanied with slime and wind. She now 
 appeared to grow easier, and in a few minutes was free 
 from pain. Very simple treatment, the reader may ob- 
 serve, yet we will'venture to say very efiicient. We have 
 frequently cured alarming cases with a little peppermint 
 tea alone; whereas, had the subject been treated after 
 the fashion of some, the malady might, as it often does, 
 have run on to a fatal issue. Those who prefer to use 
 powerful remedies, as they are called, may ask, what 
 good can peppermint tea accomplish? We an.swer, na- 
 ture delights in simples; the mother finds it good for 
 infants, and men almost invariably take peppermint, in 
 some form, for the relief of colic; and we have tried it, 
 and found it good for horses. 

Inflammation of the bowels is very apt to set in du- 
 ring an attack of colic from the use of spirits of turpen- 
 tine, and other popular nostrums; and it is much to be 
 deplored that so noble an animal as the horse should be 
 made to undergo such torture as he is known to do from 
 the administration of turpentine. If any of our readers 
 wish to satisfy themselves of the irritating properties of 
 turpentine, let them apply a small quantity to the 
 skin of a horse, and they will perceive that it is an irri- 
 tant of no ordinary character; the restlessness of the 
 animal, his efforts to " get at the part, " and the tume- 
 faction that follows, all denote the pain he suffers.

The Concord Grape. 

The merits of this grape have been discussed very 
 generally, but we have seen nothing which we like bet- 
 ter than the following article from the Horticulturist. 
 We may add that the TForticulturist is "authority" of the 
 best character : 

"It is a large, handsome grape, both bunch and bciry 
 resembling the Isabella in appearance, save that the 
 bunch is more compact and the berry rounder and 
 has a thicker coat of bloom. It has the same foxy per- 
 fume and flavor of the Isabella, but stronger ; when a 
 few berries are eaten, a prickling sensation is produced 
 on the tongue. This has been remarked by all who 
 have tested it, as far as we know. It is very juicy, and 
 we think will prove to be an excellent wine grape. For 
 the table, however, we do not consider it equal in quali- 
 ty to the Isabella ; and in this opinion nearly all disin- 
 terested parties, whom we have conversed with, agree.
