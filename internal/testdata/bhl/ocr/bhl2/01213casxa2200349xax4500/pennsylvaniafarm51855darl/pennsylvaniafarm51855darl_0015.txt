NUMBER 1. 

The Fifth Volume. 

In presenting to a discerning public the first number 
 of the fifth volume of the Farm Journal, it is proper we 
 should offer due acknowledgments to the many friends 
 who have stood by the work from its commencement, 
 and aided it by contributions from their stock of agri- 
 cultural knowledge, and by forming clubs and collecting 
 subscriptions in their respective localities; thus cheer- 
 ing the different publishers on, and dispelling all fear 
 that Pennsylvania farmers could not, or would not, sup- 
 port a first class agricultural publication in their midst. 
 Our acknowledgments are also due to a vast number of 
 friends who have more recently taken us by the hand, 
 and by whose aid we have been enabled to send the 
 Farm Journal to nearly every post-office in this State, 
 to most of those in Delaware, and to many in other 
 States. To these, first and last, we tender our most 
 hearty thanks. 

It is our purpose to render the Form Journal in every 
 respect equal (and we hope superior,) to any similar 
 publication in this country. We expressed this, deter- 
 mination one year ago, and we refer the reader to the 
 last volume as an evidence of how well it has been thus far 
 realized. We point to that volume with pleasure and 
 with pride, and may, perhaps, be permitted to add, that 
 we doubt if there be a single subscriber who would be 
 willing to divest himself of the information derived from 
 it, for five times the price of subscription. 

The present volume, we have reason to believe, will 
 be an improvement on the last. We have been enabled 
 to secure a larger list of able contributors, who will give 
 their experience in different modes of culture, &c, in 
 its pages. We shall continue to present engravings of 
 the best stock in this and adjoining States, representa- 
 tions of all new agricultural implements of any value, 
 choice fruits, pestiferous insects, &c, &c. 

We have made ample arrangements for issuing a very 
 large edition of this volume, and trust that by strict at- 
 tention and a continuation of the kind exertions of old 
 friends and new, to be enabled to mail Twenty Thousand 
 Copies at least. 

We shall send this number to a few first class farmers 
 and public spirited gentlemen, in the hope that they will 
 bring it to the notice of their neighbors, and induce the 
 formation of clubs. For terms see last cover page. 

The "back numbers" of the first and second volumes 
 having been exhausted, we are preparing a second edi- 
 tion, which will be ready for delivery early in March 
 when we will again supply full sets. 

Suburban Residences. 

The rapidly increasing taste in all our large cities, 
 even among those actively engaged in business, for 
 Country Residences, is a new and one of the most promi- 
 nent features of the times. As we consider it, both 
 physically and morally, a most healthy and commenda- 
 ble feeling, we have a few words to say as to the causes 
 which have induced it, and also, by way of caution, to 
 prevent disappointment from expectations often too ar- 
 dentlj- entertained. 

There is no doubt that the great and rapid increase of 
 population in the cities, the consequent increased ex- 
 penses of living, high rents, luxurious habits, as well as 
 positive wants of the people, which increased production 
 of the country has hardly kept pace with, have created 
 a necessity for additional outlet, which has been supplied 
 as wanted, by the unexampled increase of railroad facil- 
 ities and accommodations, extending in every direct 
 tion. 

Whether the country is resorted to for the summer 
 months, as we believe it is by large numbers, merely be- 
 cause it is fashionable, or by others for economy, health 
 or enjoyment, the fact exists that there now is, and we 
 fully believe will continue to be, a regular exodus from 
 the cities, every spring, of a large portion of their popu- 
 lation, some for a few months and others for a longer 
 period. By the conmutation system of tickets, cheap 
 fares, and frequent trains, a business man, actively en- 
 gaged in his daily duties, finds he can select a. permanent 
 residence five to twenty or thirty miles from town, and 
 still be within an hour of his office ; and that in addition 
 to the greatly increased health of himself and family, he 
 can also have about him, at almost nominal cost, com- 
 pared with what he would have to pay for them in the 
 city, a large amount of what are there considered luxu- 
 ries. An abundance of fresh fruit at all seasons, fresh 
 vegetables, gardens, lawns, graperies, conservatories, 
 carriage and horses, pure air, delightful scenery, &c, 
 we know, arc attainable with the greatest ease, at a very 
 small comparative investment, and it is because some of 
 our friends have been a little disappointed in some of 
 these particulars, that we now have a few words to say 
 and a little advice to give. 

In the first place, do not emerge at once from the 
 densely populated city and its attractions into a sparsely 
 settled, obscure neighborhood, away from schools, 
 churches, stores, post-office, &c. A bit of romance, or 
 transient enthusiasm towards some sequestered spot, has 
 sometimes caused this to be done, and the result has
