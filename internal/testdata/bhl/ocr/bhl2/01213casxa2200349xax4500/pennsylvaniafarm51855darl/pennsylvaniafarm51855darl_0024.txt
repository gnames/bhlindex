of the rabbits is reduced to shreds and drops from the 
 bones, which will not be in less than five hours, if boiled 
 as gently as it ought. When quite done, strain the soup 
 into a tureen. Have ready the grated yolks of six hard 
 boiled eggs, and stir them into the soup immediately af- 
 ter it is strained, and while it is very hot. Add, also, 
 some bread cut into dice or small squares, and fried 
 brown in fresh butter. Or substitute for the fried bread 
 buttered toast, with all the crust removed, and cut into 
 very small bits or mouthfuls. 

Hare soup may be made in this manner. It is also an 
 excellent way of disposing of old fowls. A similar soup 
 may be made of fresh-killed venison. 

For hare or venison soup, add (after straining it) 
 about half an hour before you take it up, two glasses of 
 sherry or Madeira, and a lemon sliced thin. 

Chicken Soup. — Cut up two large fine fowls, as if 
 carving them for the table, and wash the pieces in cold 
 water. Take half a dozen thin slices of cold ham, and 
 lay them in a soup-pot, mixed among the pieces of chick- 
 en. Season them with a very little cayenne, a little nut- 
 meg, and a few blades of mace, but no salt, as the ham 
 will make it salt enough. Add a head of celery, split 
 and cut into long bits, a quarter of a pound of butter, 
 divided in two, and rolled in flour. Pour on three 
 quarts of milk. Set the soup-pot over the fire, and let 
 it boil rather slowly, skimming it well. When it has 
 boiled an hour, put in some small round dumplings, 
 made of half a pound of flour mixed with a quarter of a 
 pound of butter; divide this dough into equal portions, 
 and roll them in your hands into little balls about the 
 size of a large hickory nut. The soup must boil till the 
 flesh of the fowls is loose on the bones, but not till it 
 drops off. Stir in, at the last, the beaten yolks of three 
 or four eggs; and let the soup remain about five minutes 
 longer over the fire. Then take it up. Cut off from the 
 bones the flesh of the fowls, and divide it into mouth- 
 fuls. Cut up the slices of ham in the same manner. 
 Mince the livers and gizzards. Put the bits of fowl and 
 ham in the bottom of a large tureen, and pour the soup 
 upon it. 

This soup will be found excellent, and may be made of 
 lar<:e old fowls, that cannot be cooked in any other way. 
 If they are so old that when the soup is finished they 
 still continue tough, remove them entirely, and do not 
 serve them up in it. 

Similar soup may be made of a large old turkey. 
 Also of four rabbits. 

SotJP-MEAT. — To make the soup very good, the meat 
 (of which there should be a large proportion, rather 
 more than a pound to a quart of water,) must remain in, 
 till it drops entirely from the bones and is boiled to rags. 
 But none of these fragments and shreds should be found 
 in the tureen when the soup is sent to table. They 
 should all be kept at the bottom of the pot, pressing 
 down the ladle hard upon them when you are dipping 
 out the soup. If any are seen in the soup after it is 
 taken up, let them be carefully removed with a spoon. 
 To send the soup to table with bits of bone and shreds 
 of meat in it, is a slovenly, disgusting, and vulgar prac- 
 tice, and should be strictly forbidden ; as some indiffer- 
 ent cooks will do so to save themselves the trouble of 
 removing it. A mass of shreds left at the bottom of the 

tureen, absorbs so much of the liquid as to diminish the 
 quantity of the soup ; and if eaten is very unwholesome, 
 all the nourishment being boiled out of it. 

Mutton, however, need not be boiled to pieces in the 
 soup, which will have sufficient strength if the meat ia 
 left whole. A piece of loin of mutton, that has been 
 cooked in soup, is to many persons very palatable. It 
 is well worth sending to table. 

Grease for Coarse Boots. — Take a coal made of 
 white pine, of the size of a hen's egg, well burnt, pul- 
 verise it finely, mix it with enough of clean melted tal- 
 low to make it of the consistence of thick paste. Two 
 or three applications will make the leather soft, and will 
 keep the water out. 

A Good Recipe for Bread, Breakfast and Tea 
 Cakc — "Aunt Ann," in the Ohio Cultivator, communi- 
 cates the following receipt for Bread, Breakfast and Tea 
 Cake, and says she has seen nothing in that paper like 
 it. — "Please try it, and if it answers satisfactorily, give 
 it to the public in thy own name." — It is as follows: 

"Take buttermilk, or any other sour or thick milk, let 
 it boil, and then staud till cool enough to prevent scald- 
 ing, have ready some flour and pour the whey over it so as 
 to make a thick sponge, beat it well and then stir in the 
 yeast, (which should be good,) then cover with a cloth 
 and let it stand till it becomes light, make the bread en- 
 tirely of the sponge, and make it quite soft and pliable, 
 knead it some fifteen minutes, then let it get very, very 
 light before moulding into loaves, but do not let the 
 loaves get too light, and bake it slow. If the sponge 
 should become sour, dissolve a little soda, or saleratus, 
 and stir in. I often work sugar and butter into the light 
 dough and make rusk, or a little butter alone to make 
 rolls for dinner or tea; but if I want them for breakfast, 
 I take some whey, butter and yeast, and make the dough 
 over night. 

"I also make a nice cake which suits very well for 
 winter. Take half cup of butter, two of sugar, three of 
 flour, and one of thick sour cream, (instead of eggs,) get 
 it ready for the oven in the usual way, then sprinkle and 
 stir in a tea-spoonful of soda, bake it slow : both the 
 bread and cake suit farmers' wives better than our city 
 Aunts and Cousins, who sometimes lack cream, &c. 
 But tell the girls to try it, and if they miss once, try, 
 try again, for they are all good." 

Price of Land. 

The increase of population in Philadelphia, and ex- 
 tended limits of the new consolidated city, have embra- 
 ced much land that has heretofore been occupied for farm- 
 ing purposes. Farmers pursuing the ordinary routine 
 of business to which they had been accustomed, raising 
 corn, oats, wheat, potatoes, dairying or grazing, some 
 eight or ten miles as they thought from town, have been 
 startled by the visits of the city tax collector, the superin- 
 tendent of pavement, requiring curbing to be done in front 
 of some of their pasture fields, or perhaps some operator 
 in land companies has enquired the price per foot of this 
 or that field fronting on the highway, with a view of 
 erecting a row of brick houses. 

Nearly all the land within and around the new city 
 limits has risen very much in value. Railroads have 
 licen made, or are now making, leading out in various
