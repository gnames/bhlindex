directions, and into fertile agricultural districts before 
 inaccessible, and the facility of getting produce from 
 thence to market, has become so easy as to place farm- 
 ers one hundred or one hundred and fifty miles from Phil- 
 adelphia, quite on a par with those within reach of the 
 pavement. 

We would not wish to unsettle improperly any of our 
 young farmers, who are laboring on their old paternal 
 acres, but we cannot help observing many of them within 
 a circle of ten to twenty miles of Philadelphia, occupying 
 farms worth from one hundred and fifty to two hundred 
 dollars per acre, performing the same amount of labor, 
 and getting no more nett profit from their produce than 
 those living on belter land, valued in the market at only 
 fifty or sixty dollars per acre, but farther off from the 
 city in respect to distance though almost as near in refer- 
 ence to time 

A farmer some few years ago used to be an hour from 
 the city at the distance of six miles, now he is equally 
 near at thirty miles off, and can bring his milk, butter 
 poultry &c, quite as soon, and with more convenience. 
 What we have to suggest, is, that some of our young 
 farmers instead of emigrating to the west, or even set- 
 tling down at home under the disadvantages we have al- 
 luded to, should take advantage of the present leisure 
 season and visit some few of our flourishing counties 
 within one hundred and fifty or two hundred miles of 
 Philadelphia, through which railroad facilities now exist, 
 or are progressing; examine the quality of the land, its 
 productiveness, buildings, healthiness, and real, not appa- 
 rent, distance by time from Philadelphia, and we think they 
 would feel inclined to sell their city farms by the foot and 
 buy by the acre, at one fifth or sixth the cost. Take any of 
 the counties beyond the circle of Lancaster, Berks, Bucks, 
 Montgomery, &c, and prime land maybe obtained, with 
 good improvements from fifty to seventy five dollars per 
 acre. We were particularly struck with this fact not long 
 since, in passing up the valley of the Lehigh from Eastown 
 to Allentown, in Northampton and Lehigh counties, a 
 most beautiful section of country, with fertile and highly 
 improved farms, second to few others in the state, but 
 comparatively unknown. The same may be said of Cum- 
 berland, York, Dauphin, some parts of Schuylkill, North- 
 umberland, and many other counties, and we should be 
 obliged if some of our subscribers in those sections would 
 give the information through the Farm Journal of the 
 value per acre, of good farms in their vicinity, the price 
 of produce, and facilities of access to market. Such in- 
 formation is much wanted, and we believe would prevent 
 many from leaving our good old state for the far west. 
 Produce is now selling in many if not most of our best 
 agricultural sections, at the same rates as at the head of 
 market, and the necessities of the case will soon compel 
 a change of system, by which land adjacent to the city 
 must be abandoned for the heavy articles which can be 
 raised any where, and reserved for those more perisha- 
 ble, such as the smaller fruits, fresh vegetables and 
 truck of all kinds, &c. They must be converted from 
 grazing farms into truck gardens, and cut up into smaller 
 divisions, and supply the city with all such as will not 
 bear extensive carriage. The district called the "Neck" 
 which for the last half century has furnished the city 
 with the best of vegetables, is now being rapidly en- 

croached upon with houses, and has been selling at one 
 thousand dollars per acre. The circle of cultivation must 
 be extended, and we believe many are suffering from 
 an annual and heavy pecuniary loss by remaining on 
 farms under the circumstances mentioned, and cultivating 
 the larger and heavier crops, which may be raised with 
 as much profit one thousand miles off. 

Grass Land— Grass Seed. 

The following judicious observations from the New 
 England Farmer are not less applicable to Pennsylvania 
 than to New England: 

It has frequently been remarked by practical men, 
 that, in laying down lands to grass, the bestowment of a 
 few extra pounds of seed, is not to be considered by any 
 means as a useless expenditure of capital, but the re- 
 verse. Farmers often subject themselves to serious in- 
 convenience and loss, by being too parsimonious in this 
 particular; they proceed upon the erroneous principle that 
 all seed sown will germinate, and that all that germinates 
 will produce plants; whereas the truth of the case is, 
 that under ordinary circumstances, a considerable por- 
 tion of the seed never vegetates, or if it vegetates, does 
 not obtain root, or produce plants. When allowance is 
 made for loss and for defect in seed, when there are any 
 indications that it is of a bad quality, we shall hear less 
 complaint that "grass seed has not taken well." On 
 light soils, which are deficient in retentive power, and 
 where the requisite degree of compressibility is not easily 
 attained, nothing is more certain than that a considera- 
 ble portion of the seed committed to it — unless in a pe- 
 culiarly modified season — will fail to sprout. The rapid 
 descent of such soils, and their extreme permeability to 
 atmospheric influences, causes them to become dry — a 
 condition in which no seed can be made to develope 
 healtnily, or if it should, to produce a vigorous plant. 
 The application of an extra allowance of seed, followed 
 by the roller for the purpose of consolidating the surface 
 is indispensable to success in stocking lands of this de- 
 scription. 

Warts on Plum Trees. 

The following is an extract from some remarks by 
 Prof. T. W. Harris, the distinguished horticulturist. 
 Those who are acquainted with the reputation of the 
 author, will receive them with more than ordinary con- 
 fidence : 

' ' These have been attributed by many persons to the 
 punctures, or to the presence of insects therein. I have 
 not been able to find either the one or the other in the 
 incipient warts, or in their immediate vicinity. It was 
 only when these excrescences were well grown and were 
 approaching to maturity, that insects were discovered in 
 them, and not always even in this stage. Some of the 
 twigs, containing incipient warts, were enclosed in a 
 tight vessel in May, and were examined in August, when 
 they were entirely free from the vestiges of insects, al- 
 though the tumors, when cut open, presented the porous 
 and cancellated structure peculiar to them when dry. 
 The insects to be found in the warts in the course of the 
 summer are of sundry kinds ; such as the grubs of the 
 plum-weevil, borers similar to those that attack peach 
 and cherry trees, and the worm-like caterpillars of min-
