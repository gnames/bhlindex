Pure Durham Oxen. 

On the opposite page is a representation of a pair of 
 Durham cattle, bred and fattened by George Brinton, of 
 Birmingham, Chester county. They were slaughter- 
 ed in March last, when five and a half years old, and 
 weighed respectively one thousand eight hundred and 
 forty-three, and one thousand six hundred and thirty- 
 two pounds. They were sold to a Philadelphia drover 
 for seven hundred and fifty dollars, and afterwards, we 
 are informed, re-sold for one thousand dollars. Their live 
 weight on the 30th of January preceding, when they 
 were sent to the city, was two thousand seven hundred 
 and twenty-four, and two thousand five hundred and 
 sixty pounds. From the time of their arrival in the city 
 until they were slaughtered, they were kept as "show 
 cattle," and before being killed they had probably fallen 
 away a hundred pounds each. 

These cattle, as observed above, were pure Durhams ; 
 they were not raised with a view to making them extra- 
 ordinary of their kind, and until the grass began to fail 
 in September, 1853, had no grain whatever. From that 
 time they received about four quarts per day until the 
 beginning of December, when it was considerably in- 
 creased. Their extraordinary growth, therefore, was 
 almost entirely due to their breed, and to the rich green 
 grass pasture with which the extensive domain of their 
 owner abounds. 

One of the pair, as will be observed by a glance at 
 the engraving, was somewhat disfigured by large masses 
 of fat on either side, but the other was as comely an ox 
 as we ever saw; and although his back was not so broad 
 as his mate's, yet it was very broad and level — so broad 
 and level, indeed, that a large man might have found 
 it a comfortable couch on which to repose without 
 the fear of rolling off. They were worthy representa- 
 tives of their race, of the superior herd of their owner, 
 and of fields once enriched by human gore, the bloody 
 fields of Brandywine. 

Governor Brown. 

Simon Brown, editor of the "N~ew England Farmer," 
 has just been elected Lieutenant Governor of Massachu- 
 setts by a large majority. If the farmers of the coun- 
 try, who constitute a vast majority of its voters, would 
 entrust the offices to such hands, Politics and Politicians 
 would soon cease to be a by-word. 

The Grape Disease. 
 "The fate of European Vineyards may be regarded as 
 sealed, for the present. The ruin of the grapes in Por- 
 tugal, France, Italy, Germany, and the Balearic Islands, 
 appears to be so extensive that the price of wine must 
 rise considerably, unless its consumption should much 
 diminish. And this becomes the more certain when it is 
 remembered that Madeira is in the same predicament, 
 and when we add, as we can upon good authority, that 
 mildew has begun to show itself in Sicily, whither it 
 seems to have travelled from the kingdom of Naples, 
 where the grapes are in the same state as in France. 
 How far Spain is exempt we are as yet uninformed, but 
 we know that mildew prevailed largely in Grenada last 
 year, and we have reason to believe that the mischief 
 this year has been much greater." 

From the above, which we copy from the London Gar- 
 deners' Chronicle, we learn that the grape disease is ex- 
 tending throughout Europe. No remedy has yet been 
 discovered which can be relied on to stay its ravages; 
 and the vtjne makers and wine bibbers are casting their 
 eyes to South Africa, Australia, and adjacent islands. 
 Unless our countrymen are lacking their reputed shrewd- 
 ness, they will not let this calamity to the vine district* 
 in Europe pass unimproved.

Hop Culture. 

We have lately received several calls for information 
 relative to hop culture, but having no personal knowl- 
 edge on the subject, or of any of our correspondents be- 
 ing engaged in the business, we have selected the follow- 
 ing from the pen of Wm. Blanchard, Esq., originally 
 published in the New England Farmer, as the best arti- 
 cle we have met on the subject : 

"The hop is a native plant. It is found growing 
 spontaneously on the banks and intervals of many of our 
 large rivers. There are several distinct species, all 
 bearing a near affinity to each other, (I have noticed 
 five.) At present they are cultivated together, promis- 
 cuously ; no preference having been given to any partic- 
 ular one of them by the brewer. 

"The soil best calculated for the production of hops 
 i3 a sandy loam, rather low and moist. F am led to this 
 conclusion from my own observation, and from finding 
 the lands which produce them to be naturally of this 
 kind. Yet I have seen fine crops raised on very differ- 
 ent soils. 

"I should recommend the following mode of preparing 
 the land and managing the crop. In the fall (October) 
 plough the land deep, nine or ten inches. In the spring 
 following, pass a heavy, sharp, iron-toothed harrow over 
 the land, in the same direction' it was ploughed ; after 
 which, spread your manure evenly over the same, six- 
 teen cords per acre, and more if the land be much re- 
 duced ; then cross-plough the land nearly the same 
 depth, and furrow it as for planting corn, the furrows to 
 be at least four feet apart. 

"It is customary to plant corn or potatoes with the 
 hops, (I should prefer potatoes. ) Plant every other hill 
 in every other row with hops, thus placing the hop hills
