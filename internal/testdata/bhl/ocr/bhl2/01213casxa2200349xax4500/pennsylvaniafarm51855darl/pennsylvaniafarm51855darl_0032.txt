at least eight feet apart. Put four cutting from the 
 running roots, about eight inches in length, into each 
 hill, and cover them the common depth of potatoes. 

"Many yards have been much injured by being plant- 
 ed too closely. It is of great importance to lftive the 
 hills so far distant from each other as to admit a free 
 current of air to pass through the yard. 

"All the attention requisite the first season after the 
 hops are planted, is to keep them clean from weeds, 
 which is easily done when hoeing the crop planted 
 amongst them. In the fall (October), to prevent their 
 being injured by the hard frosts of winter, carry on and 
 lay out of your cart one shovelful of compost manure on 
 the top of each hill; manure from the hog-sty I should 
 prefer 

"In each following spring, before the hops are open- 
 ed, as it is termed, spread evenly over the yard about 
 eight cords of manure per acre, (coarse, strawy manure 
 I should prefer, as it will have a tendency to keep the 
 land Idose,) and plough the field both ways at the first 
 hoeing. They require but three hoeings in a season, 
 unless necessary to subdue the weeds; the last of which 
 should be performed when the hops are in full blossom, 
 (about the beginning of August.) 

"After the first crop, it is necessary to open the hops, 
 every spring, by the middle of May ; which is performed 
 by making four furrows between the rows, turning the 
 furrows from the hills, and running the plough as near 
 to the same as possible without injuring the main roots.- 
 Then the earth is removed from the roots with a hoe, all 
 the running roots cut in, with a sharp knife, within two 
 inches of the main roots ; the tops of the main roots 
 must also be cut in, and then the hills covered with earth 
 about two inches deep. 

"The next thing necessary to be done is to set the 
 poles. This should be done as soon as the hop-vines 
 begin to make their appearance. By so doing, much 
 time and labor will be saved in tying up the vines to the 
 poles, as many of the vines will naturally take to the 
 poles. There should not be to exceed two vines to one 
 pole, nor to exceed two poles to one hill, nor any pole to 
 exceed sixteen feet in height. Many yards have been 
 very much injured by letting a greater number of vines 
 grow on one pole, and almost destroyed by over-poling. 

"Very much depends on paying due attention, in the 
 spring, to select the most thrifty vines, and training 
 them to the poles, which is done by fastening them to 
 the poles with a piece of yarn, slightly twisted together 
 with the thumb and finger. 

" It will be necessary to inspect your hop-yard fre- 
 quently, until the hops begin to blossom, and 'tie up the 
 vines,' as it is termed, as they are subject to be blown 
 off the poles by every high wind. 

"As soon as the hops are ripe, which is about the be- 
 ginning of September, they must be immediately gath- 
 ered, or the crop is lost. The quality of the hops de- 
 pends considerably on their being picked clean from 
 leaves and stems. The labor of picking or gathering 
 the hops may be well performed by women and children, 
 having one man to a bin to handle the poles and to in- 
 spect the pickers. The bin is a wooden box, about nine 
 feet long, three feet wide, and two and a half feet high, 
 made of thin pine boards, that it may be easily moved 

over the yard, across which the poles are laid, and into 
 which the hops are picked by hand. Care should be 
 taken, when gathering the hops, to cut the vines two 
 feet from the ground, that the roots may not be injured 
 by bleeding. 

"The most important part in the management of hops 
 is the curing or drying them. Here I would note, that 
 hops always grow first sort, and that all second sort and 
 refuse hops are made so by unfortunate or unskilful 
 management. 

"Much depends on having a well constructed kiln. 
 For the convenience of putting the hops on the kiln, the 
 side of a hill is generally chosen for its situation. Care 
 should be taken that it be a dry situation. The kiln 
 should be dug out the s.aroe bigness at the bottom as at 
 the top; the side walls laid up perpendicularly, and fill- 
 ed in solid with stone, to give it a tunnel form. Twelve 
 feet square at the. top, two feet square at the bottom, 
 and at least eight feet deep, is deemed a convenient size. 
 On the top of the walls sills are laid, having joists let 
 into them in like manner as for laying a floor; on which 
 laths, about one and a half inches wide, are nailed, 
 leaving open spaces between them three-fourths of an 
 inch, over which a thin linen cloth is spread and nailed 
 at the edges to the sills. A board about twelve inches 
 wide is set up on each side of the kiln, on the inner edge 
 of the sill, to form a bin to receive the hops. The lar- 
 ger the stones made use of in the construction of the 
 kiln, the better; as it will give a more steady and dense 
 heat. The inside of the kiln should be well plastered 
 with mortar to make it completely air-tight. Charcoal 
 [that made from yellow birch or maple I should prefer] 
 is the only fuel proper to be used in drying hops. The 
 kiln should be well heated before any hops are put on, 
 and carefully attended, to keep a steady and regular 
 heat.

George E. Waring, Jr. â€” Agricultural Pretension. 

"A person called George E. Waring, Junior, has late- 
 ly published a book on the Elements of Agriculture, de- 
 dicating it to his "friend and tutor, Prof. James J. 
 Mapes," whom he calls "the pioneer of agricultural 
 science in America." Of course, "Prof. Mapes" recom- 
 mends the book as "superior to any other elementary 
 work extant." From what we learn of this "pupil," he 
 bids fair to soon equal his famous instructor. He ad- 
 vertises himself in his book, and elsewhere, as "Consult- 
 ing Agriculturist," and offers to visit farms, recommend 
 treatment, and give "letters of advice" at $25 each." . 

We copy the above satirical reference to the author of 
 the "Elements of Agriculture" from the Boston Cultivator. 
 It appears as editorial, and has appended to it an article 
 from the Ohio Statesman, in which he is farther alluded ': : 
 to in terms more appropriate to the columns of a low, 
 political and reckless newspaper, than one intended for 
 the benefit of the farmer. The opportunity has been 
 cheerfully embraced as usual for a "hit at Mapes." 

We are beginning to tire at this continued tirade of 
 abuse and defamation. Every tub should stand on its 
 own bottom. If the superphosphate of lime is as worth- 
 less as' certain of our cotemporaries at the north assert, 
 there is still no reason, we think, for the rude and ruth-
