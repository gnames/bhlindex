less personalities against J. J. Manes with which their 
 columns continue to teem. He has done the State some 
 service both as a first rate pi-actic.il farmer, and as the 
 working editor of one of the best agricultural papers in 
 the country, which has performed its full share, and 
 more than most others, in spreading broadcast improved 
 and scientific suggestions and practices. If the real 
 value of his superphosphate, the actual bona fide results 
 from its use, are made the test, whether he or his deta- 
 iners are in the right, we have in this State, particularly 
 in the eastern section of it, any amount of the most 
 positive, substantial and reliable evidence to prove the 
 extraordinary and unprecedented benefits from its appli- 
 cation to corn, wheat, oats, potatoes and pasture. What 
 matters it to the farmer if certain wise and knowing 
 ones to the east of us have examined it in their labora- 
 tories, and find it good for nothing, when a well filled 
 corn crib or hay mow, proves directly the contrary ? 
 Which is the most reliable ? We have never analysed 
 Mapes' superphosphate, and have had no occasion to do 
 so. We have, however, tried it on our farm with the 
 happiest results, have had our oats field dotted over with 
 luxuriant spots, indicating where it had been applied to 
 each hill of corn. Whether he is or not a regular 
 Professor, whether he is as learned and scientific as his 
 opponents, whether the superphosphate is a new article 
 or an old one, whether he knows any thing or is a know 
 nothing, is short or tall, good looking or otherwise, are 
 all irrevalent matters to those who judge of things by 
 their results. 

In respect to Goorge E. Waring, he is entitled to the 
 credit of having, although a young man, written one of 
 the best, most usefid and practical works on the Ele- 
 ments of Agricultural Chemistry yet published in this 
 country. For its particular use as a hand-book, simpli- 
 fied and adapted to the use of schools, no less than an 
 introduction for the farmer to a most important, though 
 to him often abtruse, department of his business, it is 
 precisely what was wanted at this time. Many an ex- 
 perienced author has written volumes destined to be far 
 less useful, and make far less impression on the mind of 
 the masses than this unpretendiug little volume. We 
 should be glad to sec it in every district school in the 
 land. Let the Boston Cultivator disprove of its con- 
 tents rather than chime in with the scurrilous language 
 of the Ohio Statesman against a young author. If we 
 cannot have decency and charity in all things, let us at 
 least adopt a grade applicable to agriculture and horti- 
 culture. 

To Destroy Moles. 

Mb. J. L. Darlington. — Dear Sir: — I find in the last 
 number of the Farm Journal, an inquiry in relation to 
 ground moles and the best mode for destroying them. 
 Mr. Ivelsey, states that they have been injuring his corn 
 crop, and fears by present appearance they may be still 
 more hurtful next season. The best manner ot destroy- 
 ing them is one that is within the reach of every farmer, 
 and he only need complain of their havoc in the planted 
 field who has not given the remedy below a fair trial. 

Take one scruple of strychnine, one half pound of corn 
 meal, and and a tea spoonful of lard. Take the lard and 
 warm to soften, then stir it thoroughly with the corn 

meal, then add strychnine — by these means the strych- 
 nine will adhere to the meal, place this at such a place 
 in their roads where they meander along frequently, and 
 cover the top with a stone that it may not be covered up 
 with earth. The smallest quantity will be sufficient to 
 destroy them, and also posessing a peculiar qualification 
 in action that when once in the system in a poisonous 
 dose, death will be inevitable and may take place mo- 
 mentarily. I deem it unnecessary to enter into any detail 
 respecting its action, suffice it to say, that it is supposed 
 to act altogether on the nervous system. 

This poison will also answer for other vermin such as 
 mice, rats, &c. I need hardly add that the most pro- 
 found precautions are necessary, in using the same for 
 the reason indicated, being poisonous alike to all animals 
 and should always be placed with a certainty beyond the 
 reach of those which it is not desired to destroy. The 
 article can be obtained at any drug store or country 
 physician. E. K. BEAVER.

The best Soil for Fruit Trees. 

The editor of the American Agriculturist, good author- 
 ity by the way, says: 

After almost a half century of experience in raising 
 fruit, we are decidedly of opinion, as a general rule, that 
 the best soil on which to raise fruit, is that just cleared 
 of a forest. The surface should be rolling or descending, 
 and moderately dry and rich. Such ground needs little 
 or no preparation ; the roots of the forest trees as they 
 decay keep it loose and mellow, and afford the exact 
 food necessary for a rapid and healthy growth of the 
 fruit trees ; and the soil abounds plentifully in those ele- 
 ments which are requisite to form the most perfect fruit. 
 Another consideration, and a very important one is, that 
 fruit trees grown on recently-cleared forest land, are 
 much less diseased than those grown on old land, and 
 the fruit is not near so liable to be attacked by insects. 

Information Wanted. 

J. Lacet Darlington, Esq. — Dear Sir: — Allow me to 
 inquire if your experience has placed you in possession 
 of any means to prevent stall feeding cattle from licking 
 themselves. As I have a pair of cattle now feeding 
 whose joint weight yesterday w^as four thousand one 
 hundred and ninety seven pounds, and who have a desire 
 to the above vice, I wish to prevent .them from it as I 
 think they do not fat st) well. I have heard that out- 
 ward applications of some kind could be applied to allay 
 the irritation in the skin. If you or any of your corres- 
 pondents know of any thing valuable in this way, I 
 would be greatly obliged if you could communicate it 
 through the pages of the Farm Journal. M. J. P.

Distant Subscribers. 
 On the eleventh of December we received a letter from 
 Plympton Kelley, dated, Portland, Washington County, 
 Oregon Territory, containing the money for his own sub- 
 scription and that of F. N. Elliott to the fifth volume of 
 the Farm Journal. Mr. Kelly has been a subscriber for 
 the last three years, and all that time has not missed a 
 single copy, although the Journal has to travel over three
