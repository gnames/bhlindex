Address of the Hon. MarshaU P. Wilder, 

DELIVERED AT THE BANQUET AT THE RATIONAL CATTLE SHOW, 
 SPRINGFIELD, OHIO. 

Friends of Agriculture and Fellow Citizens : — In behalf 
 of the United States Agricultural Society, under whose au- 
 spices this exhibition is held — In behalf of the citizens of 
 Springfield, by whose liberality we are here assembled — and 
 in my own behalf, I present you cordial salutations, and bid 
 you welcome to this our festive board. 

Come ye from the Pilgrim shores of New England, from 
 the plantations of the sunny South, from the great valley 
 and fertile fields of the West! Come ye from the walks of 
 professional life, from the halls of legislation, from the 
 marts of business, or from the high places of power — from 
 whatever section of our land, from whatever station of so- 
 ciety, welcome — a right hearty welcome — to the joys and 
 pleasures of this occasion. 

We have suspended our ordinary cares, toils and conflicts 
 of business, and come up to this thriving city from our diff- 
 erent and distant homes, to give expression to a common 
 and important sentiment — the love of Agriculture. 

We meet here for no sinister motive, no sectional object, 
 no partizan purpose. We stand here upon a platform, broad- 
 er, deeper and firmer than that of any politician or parti- 
 zan : a platform upon which those may stand side by side 
 with the noble yeomanry of our country, honoring them and 
 honored by them. We are here for the promotion of a de- 
 partment of that great art, upon which, more than upon any 
 other, depend individual happiness and national wealth, 
 prosperity and power; an art which is the parent of every 
 other industrial pursuit, and to which the special blessing 
 of Heaven is vouchsafed. 

I congratulate you upon the great interest awakened, in 
 our age and country, in the cause of Agriculture; an interest 
 manifested by the multiplication of societies and periodicals 
 throughout the land. I congratulate you upon the wonder- 
 ful improvement which science has recently made in tho 
 implements of husbandry, and in the arts of cultivation — 
 upon the facilities for tho transportation of agricultural pro- 
 ducts to the great markets of the world — and especially 
 upon the improvement of our domestic animals, and the 
 laudablo enthusiasm which many of our worthy citizens 
 have manifested in the importation of the best breeds of 
 cattle. 

It was the latter that suggested the idea of this exhibi- 
 tion, and it was deemed suitable by the Executive of the 
 United States Agricultural Society to encourage this praise- 
 worthy enterprise, and to accept the generous invitation of 
 its projectors, approvod as it was by the Ohio State Board 
 of Agriculture. 

This is tho first National Exhibition of Cattle ever held 
 in America ; and I do but express the common sentiment of 
 this assemblage, when I say that it has more than realized 
 the anticipation of all concerned. It has been eminently 
 successful, aud alike honorable to the citizens of Springfield, 
 to the State of Ohio and to this great Republic. 

There have been about two hundred entries at this show. 
 Among them we have soen such samples of the Durhams, 
 the Herefords, the Devons, tho Ayrshires, the Jerseys, and 
 grade animals, as it has seldom or never been the happiness 
 of man to behold in one show ; and larger premiums havo 
 been offered for the encouragement of that department of 
 American husbandry than ever beforo excited competition. 

Among so many spooimous of rare excellence, no wonder 
 that the judges hare found it difficult to decide upon their I 

respective merits. Our only regret is that premiums caunot 
 be awarded to each competitor. But there is one honor 
 which seems sufficient to satisfy the ambition of any one, 
 the honor of adding to the interest of this exhibition, and of 
 thus promoting a pursuit second to no other in the country. 

The report of these proceedings will oocupy an important 
 place in the transactions of this Society, and will go down to 
 posterity honorably associated with the history of this place, 
 and of American agriculture. 

And here permit me to tender our most cordial thanks to 
 the donors whose liboral contributions have supplied the 
 funds for this exhibition ; to its Board of Officers and Mana- 
 gers, to whose skill in designing, and whoso energy in exe- 
 cution, we are so much indebted to the order, convenience 
 and taste, which have characterized these proceedings ; to 
 tho judges, on whom has devolved the onerous duty of a- 
 warding premiums; to the contributors, who so nobly have 
 endured the risk and expense of placing their valuable ani- 
 mals on exhibition. Especially do we present our heartfelt 
 acknowledgements to our distinguished guests who have 
 honored us by their presence, and who, we trust, will instruct 
 and encourage us by their speeches ; to the good citizens of 
 Springfield and vicinity, whose large hospitality we have 
 enjoyed; and last, but first in our affections, to the ladies, 
 whose presence adds so much to the interest and beauty of 
 this banquet, and whose approving smiles encourage us in 
 the laudable pursuits of life. 

Friends and Fellow-citizens : — In conclusion, permit me 
 to extend to you the right hand of fellowship, and to invoke 
 your aid in favor of the cause we seek to promote. While 
 the nations of the Old World seek for glory in war and the 
 acquisitions of the sword, let us cultivate tho arts of peace, 
 and let us remember that the history of a prosperous people 
 is inscribed, not on tho star spangled banner of military 
 fame, or of political preferment and power, but it is seen in 
 the peaceful triumphs of the plow, in fields of waving grass 
 and grain, in thriving flocks and herds, in highly cultivated 
 farms and gardens, in the refined arts of rural life and cul- 
 tivated taste, and in the grateful incense which rises from the 
 altars of an industrious, intelligent aud virtuous yeomanry. 

Extracts from an Address Delivered by the Hon. Jere- 
 miah S. Black, before the Somerset County Agricultural 
 Society. 

Without Science, man the ruler of this world, would be the 
 most helpless of all animated beings. His Creator made him 
 the monarch of tho earth, and gave him dominion over it; to 
 govern and control it; to levy unlimited contributions upon 
 it, and convert everything in it to his own use. But he found 
 himself at the head of a revolted empire. All its physical 
 forces were in a state of insurrection against his lawful au- 
 thority. The inferior animals were his enemies. The 
 storms poured their fury on his unsheltered head. He was 
 terrified by tho roar of the thunder, and the lightning seared 
 his eye balls. He was parched under the hot sun of sum- 
 mer, and in winter he was pierced by the cold. The soil, 
 cursed for his sake, produced thorns and thistles. The food 
 that might sustain his lifo grew beside the poison that would 
 destroy it, and he knew not how to distinguish tho one from 
 the other. The earth hid her minerals deep in her bosom, 
 and guarded them with a rampart of thick-ribbed rocks. 
 The rivers obstructed his passage; the mountains frowned 
 their defiance upon him; and the forest spread its gloom 
 around him, breathing a browner horror upon the dangers 
 that beset his way. If he left the dry land and trusted him- 
 self to the ocean, the waters yawned to engulph him, and 
 the tempest came howling on his track. He seemed an exile 
 and an outcast in tho world of which he was made to be the
