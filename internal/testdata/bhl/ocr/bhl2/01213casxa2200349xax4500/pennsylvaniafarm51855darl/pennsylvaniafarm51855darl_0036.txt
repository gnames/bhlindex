faculty of her miud. She knew the whole subject by heart, 
 as soon as she heard it explained. Henceforth she had 
 neither eye nor ear for any thin- else. She gave herself up 
 entirely to the one great task of spreading agricultural 
 science. Every day wielded to her own knowledge, and to 
 the irresistible power with which she impressed it on other 
 minds. She grew up with a lustrous beauty, which seemed 
 more than mortal. Her elocution, though gentle and persua- 
 sive, had all the vigor which springs from enthusiasm; 
 She swayed thoje rude men with an influence they hail nev- 
 er felt before. One after the other, her countrymen threw 
 away their bows and spoars, and, with hoes in their hands, 
 came and placed themselves under her tutelage. What she 
 was unable to teach, they learned from their own experi- 
 ences mutually communicated. Soon all the hill sides were 
 covered with rich crops of waving grain, and the heavy 
 timber began to disappear from the bottom lands. Stately 
 houses took the place of the mean hovels which the hun- 
 ters had occupied. All the beasts of the forest, which 
 could be made useful to man, were domesticated. The wild 
 boar was captured and tamed for the sake of his flesh; 
 the slice)) submitted to the shearer; the ox bowed his shoulder 
 to the yoke: and the mouth of the horse became acquainted 
 with the bridle bit. The wild fruits were transplanted into 
 gardens and orchards, and were totally changed under tho 
 influence of a careful culture. The sour grape became a 
 delicate luxury: the useless crab grew to be an apple; the 
 sloe expanded into a delicious plum; and a nameless fruit, 
 resembling the bitter almond, swelled out into a peach, with 
 surpassing richness of flavor. New implements of husban- 
 dry were successively invented. The plough, the harrow, 
 the sickle and the scythe, each had its share in making the 
 general prosperity greater. 

Agriculture once established, became the parent of other 
 arts. Nayigation, commerce and manufactures added to 
 their wealth. Cities rose up, filled with a refined population. 
 The nation grew strong and powerful, and spread its domin- 
 ion far and wide. The name of a Greek became synony- 
 mous with all that was great among men. Their descen- 
 dants were painters and sculptors, who furnished the models 
 for every succeeding generation; poets, whose sublime strains 
 have been AScbly imitated ever since; philosophers and 
 statesmen, whoso words of wisdom will be heard with rev- 
 erence to the end of time; warriors, whose deeds made 
 Thermopylaj and Marathon the watchworks of the free; and 
 orators, 

" Who wielded the fierco democratic at will, 
 Shook the arsenal, and fulminod over Gerece." 

They were not unmindful of the benefactress, who had 
 given the first impulse to their high career. They assigned- 
 her a celestial parentage. Temples wero erected to honor 
 her. They believed, that though her home had long been 
 fixed among the stars, she still presided over their affairs and 
 pleaded their cause in the Senate of the Gods. They paint- 
 ed her figure, as they imagined it, all radiant -with super-j, 
 natural beauty — her hand bearing the horn of plenty, and 
 her head garlanded with ears of wheat. They worshiped her 
 with all the fervor of idolatrous veneration, and for a long 
 lapse of centuries they knew not, that the labors of the farm 
 were blessed and rewarded by a greater deity than CERES. 
 To this day, we keep her memory alive by calling the most 
 useful of agricultural products after her name — the cereal 
 grains. 

ect the taste of the milk and butter. So it does if fed ra w ; 
 this can be avoided by boiling. — For each bow bjpil half a 
 bushel of turnips soft: while hot add. fivo or six quarts of 
 shorts, which will swell and you will get the full worth of it. 
 A mess like this fed to a cow once a day, will produce more 
 milk of a good quality, than any other feed at the same cost. 
 Turnips fed in this way do not taint either the milk or tho 
 butter. One thing in favor of turnips as feed for cows, is, 
 they can be sown in August, or as late as the first of Sep- 
 tember. I sowed some as late as September last year, which, 
 were very fine. Turnips are also very profitable feed for 
 pigs, when boiled in the same way as for cows. 

The Lawton. Blackberry. 

We gave on page SI of the last volume, an engraving 
 and description of this popular fruit. As many of our rea- 
 ders may desire to plant a few stalks, we have procured from 
 Mr. Lawton the following directions: 

•'Have your ground ready, and do not unpack them so as 
 to expose the roots to the open air for more than a few min- 
 utes ; plant them as soon as possible ; cover the roots with 
 light litter the first season so as to keep off the effect of the 
 hard frost as long as possible — when firmly rooted they are 
 so hardy as to require no particular care summer or winter, 
 and I made the latter suggestion as a matter of prudence — 
 I seldom lose a plant in aututan or spring planting, and 
 have used no great care in removing them, only the precau- 
 tion of covering the roots." 

The Best Feed For Milch Cows. 
 A correspondent of the Michigan Farmer recommends 
 the white flat turnip as the best for milch cows. He adds : 
 — Some perhaps, will object to the turnip, because it will aff- 

Ihe Preservation of Fruit. 

Now that farmers have become aroused to the profits of 
 fruit culture and planting of orchards, the following remarks 
 by M. P. Wilder, at the late meeting of the Pomological So- 
 ciety, on the proper maturing and preservation of fruits will 
 attract attention. 

It is a subject much misunderstood, and the theory that 
 by the natural process of ripening on the tree, nature acts 
 for the benotit of the seed,- will commend itself to all, except 
 perhaps the authors of the celebrated report of the Massa- 
 chusetts Horticultural Society, who think nature should not 
 be interfered with, but left to herself. 

To them, perhaps, tho sight of a rotten pear or apple 
 dangling from the limbs may bo as ''beautiful an ornament'' 
 as Mosses and Lichens on the trunk. He says : 

There is but one other topic to which I will advert — the 
 preservation and ripening of fruit. 

Much progress has been made in this art within a few 
 years, and important results have been attained. This prin- 
 ciple has been settled that the ripening process cannot be 
 controlled. Autumnal fruits have boon kept and exhibited . 
 the succeeding spring. We have seen the Seckel, Bart let t 
 and Louise bonne de Jersey pears, in perfection in January, 
 and even later. Tho maturity of fruits depends on saccha- 
 rine fermentation. This is followed by other fermentations, 
 as the vinous and acetous. To prevent these, and preserve 
 fruit inVill its beauty, freshness and flavor, tho temperature 
 must b\y uniform and kept below tho degree at which tho 
 fermentation' or tho ripening process commences. Our re- 
 marks, like our experience, have special regard to the apple 
 and the pear, though the principle is doubtless susceptible 
 of a more extensive application. Fruits, designed to be 
 kept for a considerable time, should bo gathered with great 
 care some days before tho ripening process commences, es- 
 pecially summer pears. A summer pear ripened on the tree 
 is generally inferior. In respect to the latter, Mr. Barry, 
 Editor of the Horticulturist, has so aptly expressed my own 
 sentiments, that I use his.language. "The process of ripen- 
 ing on the tree, which is the natural one, seems to act upon
