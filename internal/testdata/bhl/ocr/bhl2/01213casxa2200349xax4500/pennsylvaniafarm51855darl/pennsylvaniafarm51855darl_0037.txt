the fruit for the benefit qf the seed, as it tends to the forma- 
 tion of woody fibre and farina. When the fruit is removed 
 from the tr»e, at the very commencement of ripening, and 
 placed fn a still atmosphere, the natural process seems to be 
 counteracted, and sugar and juice are elaborated instead of 
 fibre and farina. Thus, pears which become mealy and rotten 
 at the core when left on the tree to ripen, become juicy, 
 melting, and delicious when ripened in the house." Various 
 fruit houses have been built both in this country and in 
 Europe : and experience shows that their object can be at- 
 tained only by a perfect control of the temperature, moisture 
 and light. Hence, they must bo cool, with non-conducting 
 walls, or with exterior and interior walls, or a room within a 
 room. Thus the external atmosphere, which either starts 
 the saccharine fermentation or co nveys the agents which 
 produce it, can be admitted or excluded at pleasure. It is 
 possible, however, to preserve the temperature at so low a 
 degree and for so long a time as to destroy, especially with 
 some varieties of the pear, the vitality, and therefore all 
 power ever to resume the ripening process. Experience 
 proves that for the common varieties of the apple and pear, 
 about forty degrees of Farenheit is the temperature best suit- 
 ed to hold this process in equilibrium. 

The proper maturing of fruit thus preserved demands skill 
 and science. Different varieties require different degrees of 
 moisture and heat, according to the firmness of the skin, 
 the texture of the flesh, and the natural activity of the 
 juices. Thus, some varieties of the pear will ripen at a low 
 temperature and in a comparatively dry atmosphere; while 
 others, as the Easter Beurro, are improved by a warm and 
 humid air. 

.Some varieties of the pear, ripening with difficulty, and 
 formerly esteemed only second rate, are now pronounced of 
 excellent quality, because the art of maturing them is better 
 understood. 

But so many experiments have been tried, or are in pro- 
 gress, and so much has been written on this branch of our 
 subject, that I need not enlarge except to say that the art of 
 preserving and ripening fruit in perfection, involves so 
 much scientific knowledge as to require great attention and 
 care; and until its laws are more fully developed, must be 
 attended with considerable difficulty. I therefore commend 
 it to your special attontion, as second in importance only to 
 tie raising of new varieties. 

Hoof Bound. 

The following are the directions of Dr. Dadd for this dis- 
 ease : — In all cases we must endeavor to give the frog a 
 bearing on the ground; and in order to do this the shoe 
 ought to bo removed. A dry, brittle, and contracted hoof 
 may be improved by repeated poulticing with soft soap and 
 rye meal, applied cold. So soon as the hoof softens, let it 
 be dressed, night and morning, with turpentine, linseed oil, 
 and powdered charcoal, equal parts. Yet, after all, a run at 
 grass in a soft pasture, the animal having nothing more than 
 tip* on his feet, is the best treatment. A very popular no- 
 tion exists, that cow manure has a wonderful effect on a con- 
 tracted hoof; but it is the candid opinion of the author, and 
 no doubt the reader will coincide, that tilth and dirt of every 
 kind are unfavorable to healthy action. Such remedy, aside 
 from its objection on tho score of decency, savors too much 
 of by-gon^ days, when live eels were sent on an errand 
 down hoivsu's- throats to unravel their intestines. If any 
 ben. -tit belongs to such an objectionable application, it is 
 due to the propefty it possesses of retaining moisture ; there- 
 fore cobl pouljices and water are far superior. Clay and 
 moist earth, placed in the stall for the horse to stand on, 
 are far Inferior to a stuffing of wet oakum, which can bo re- 

moved at pleasure. In order to keep it in contact with the 
 sole, we have only to insinuate two strips of wood between 
 the sole and shoe ; one running lengthwise and the other 
 crosswise of the foot. It affords considerable pressure to the 
 foot, is cooling and cleanly, and is far superior to the above 
 articles. 

Address of Samuel John, Esq. 

Mr. J. L. Darlington: — The following pertinent re- 
 marks were made by Samuel John, Esq., when he was 
 declared unanimously elected president of the Northumber- 
 land count}- agricultural society, and conduoted to the chair. 
 You will gratify your numerous readers in this section of 
 country, by giving them a place in the Farm Journal. 

J. S. 

Farmers, Mechanics, and Gentleman, I feel it my duty to 
 say to you that I am not ignorant of the distinguished 
 honor 3-ou have shown me in appointing mo your president. 
 It is not. an. office that will yield its occupant dollars and 
 dimes, but it is an honorable and important office, because 
 the farmer's occupation is an honorable one ; if there were 
 no other honor attached to it than that of occupying the 
 chair of my illustrious predecesors it would bo sufficient to 
 make it desirable. There once sat the gallant and lamented 
 Hunter; the honest and upright Priestly; while the seat 
 has been but recently occupied by the industrious and inde- 
 fatigable Cameron. Tho farmer's occupation is as ancient 
 as it is honorable; the father of all living men was a far- 
 mer, he was appointed to cultivate the beautiful farm of 
 Eden, laid out and planted by Eternal wisdom; his birth 
 was an honorable one, being created by an Almightv Father. 

The agricultural interest of this county requires an impe- 
 tus to induce the honest and hard working farmer to ex- 
 amine causes and events; and if by our arduous labor we 
 are able to induce any one to raise two blades of grass 
 where only one grew, we have our reward. We greatly err 
 when we say our fathers lived well and died happy, with- 
 out any of this fuss about book or scientific farming, and 
 we will do so too ; the ancients even in the time of Pharaoh, 
 far surpassed us as tillers of the ground, and they wire sci- 
 entific farmers too, they understood the principal of irriga- 
 tion as a grand auxiliary to the propagation of plants, and I 
 apprehend they practiced it well, or else Joseph would not 
 have been able in seven years, by exacting one-fifth of tho 
 corn that grew along the valley of the Nile during that time, 
 to swell the amount so that no man could number the bush- 
 els — a sufficiency to feed millions for years. 

The farmer's latitude for information is so extensive and 
 his fields for moral improvement are so wide, that it can 
 seldom fail to produce serious impressions on a reflective 
 mind; our divine master while ou earth frequently used the 
 fanner as the basis of his parables. "The kingdom of heav- 
 en is like unto a householder who went out to hire bands to 
 labor in his field." "The kingdom of heaven is like unto a 
 man who soweth good seed in his field." It is also compared 
 to "a husbandman who went into a far country, &c," and 
 many other paragraphs equally strong may he gathered 
 from the pages of sacred writ, to show that the farmer al- 
 ways has been held up as a beacon-light to moralize the 
 world. When we see the arts and sciences advancing a- 
 round us, the grain drills, the grain reapers, and threshers, 
 all got up to alleviate the labor of tho husbandman, and hear 
 the shrill whistle of the iron-horse as he purls along the 
 plain, pulling her tremenduous load with the speed of the 
 wind; when we see men talking together at a distance of 
 thousands of miles with ease anil facility: when we see all 
 of this and more, we are constrained to think that if Solo- 
 mon lived in these days he would not say " there is nothing
