tint will not produce double that amount per acre. Thir- 
 ty years ago there was more rye grown than wheat in 
 this region, because the land would not produce wheat 
 without manuring, and enough manure for all the winter 
 grain could not be got. And even of the comparatively 
 little wheat sown, a comparatively less quantity was 
 raised than at present, for the reason, that the farming 
 was less carefully performed. 

I know a "homestead" in this county comprising some 
 sixt}' acres, which is a part of a large tract taken up by 
 one of my ancestors; the remainder going to different 
 branches of the family, and sometimes sold to other par- 
 ties. Now from the papers of my father and grandfather, 
 I' learn that the entire merchantable produce of the orig- 
 inal tract, later of one third, and still later of one half 
 of this one third, was far less than the present propri- 
 etor from the sixty acres. In fact strange as it may 
 seem, the marketable produce increased with each divis- 
 ion, and I have no doubt, that if another division was 
 to take place the thirty acres would nett more than the 
 sixty now do. 

What is necessary to make small tracts remunerative, 
 is to enrich them to the fullest extent to make "Each 
 rood of ground maintain a man," and to produce thosi 
 articles for which rich ground is best calculated. 

I am aware that these observations apply with greater 
 force to land in the neighborhood of large towns than at 
 a distance from a good home market, but their truth 
 will be evident on reflection in places at a greater dis- 
 tance. WILLIAM ZELL.

An Interesting Inquiry. 

Mr. Editor. — Will you permit me through the medi- 
 um of your columns to state a case of particular interest 
 to myself, in the hope it may elicit from yourselves edi- 
 itoi'ially or from some of your scientific correspondents a 
 satisfactory solution. For a number of years past, a 
 part of my farm has almost entirely refused to produce 
 corn: that part most effected, was twenty years ago cele- 
 brated for producing a uniformly large crop, say from 50 
 to 80 bushels per acre, now 10 bushels and often less 
 than 5 bushels is the common yield. Manure and lime 
 have been used liberally and I reap most bountiful crops 
 of wheat. The grass crop produces according to the sea- 
 son from 14 to 2), tons (timothy and clover) per acre. 

The soil is a black mould, semi-alluvial, and in a high 
 state of cultivation, potatoes grow luxuriantly. 

I had occasion to enlarge one of my fields, thus effectu- 
 ally removing a partition fence, and adding several acres 
 of old pasture that had never previously been planted 
 with corn, the whole was in May last planted with corn; 
 now mark the result; on the old pasture I gathered 5 
 bushels of ears from one shock of 48 hills, immediately 
 adjoining on the sick part it required 4 shocks of equal 
 size to make 1 bushel, the hills being 5 feet apart each 
 way. 

My neighbor on the adjoining farm is in a similar fix, 
 he however applied to a celebrated professor of chemistry 
 in a neighboring city, and furnished him with a portion 
 of soil to be analyzed, the worthy professor prescribed 
 lime and guano and took a $20 bill. 

The corn usually looks right until about 5 ft high, the 

leaves then become striped with yellow, and the bark 
 or outer covering of the root, appear to be decayed and 
 readily slips off. C. W. B.

Stock Breeding— Deteriorating Effects of Contact with 
 Inferior Animals. 

Friend Darlington : — In compliance with a promise 
 made some months since, I will give you a suggestion in 
 regard to sheep breeding, hoping it may bring out some 
 one better qualified to discuss the subject and better ac- 
 quainted with stock breeding, or with the effects of 
 which I shall speak. My opinion is that sheep cannot 
 be bred in their purity if allowed to run with other 
 kinds during pregnancy. For example, take a lot of 
 pure bred Southdown ewes, and let them run with a lot 
 of common sheep during the period alluded to, without 
 allowing any connection between them, and in the course 
 of a few generations they will undoubtedly degenerate, 
 and assimilate to their associates, the common stuck. I 
 think I have seen similar effects from a similar cause, 
 and will mention a case which occurred in my neighbor- 
 hood, a few years ago, in regard to deformed colts. A 
 poor man owned and kept in his lots, or about the roads, 
 a poor old mare with a nose on one side of her head, 
 and ears drooping something like the English rabbit's. 
 Three or four of his neighbors had mares with foal 
 pasturing in fields near or adjoining this man's lot, so as 
 to be frequently in sight of and in contact with this hid- 
 eous looking animal. The result was that all had colts 
 so deformed and so exactly resembling the old mare as 
 to head, nose and ears, that two of my neighbors killed 
 them. One of the colts, which I frequently saw, that 
 was not quite so bad, and was raised, had its nose con- 
 siderably to one side of its face, and the owner kept its 
 ears tied up while rearing it. This man's neighbors had 
 much better make him a present of a good looking horse 
 and put the old thing out of the way, for she was a pub- 
 lic nuisance. Respectfully, THOMAS WOOD.

Super-phosphate of Lime for Corn. 

Mr. Darlington: — Allow me through the columns of 
 your valuable journal to call the attention of farmers 
 to the value of super-phosphate of lime as a manure for 
 corn. It is my impression that the farmer cannot use 
 any manure that will so amply repay him for the money 
 and labor expended. I wilL give you the result of an ex- 
 periment with super-phosphate the past season. I plowed 
 up about fifteen acres of sward which was manured 
 broad cast with stable manure, say twenty five loads to 
 the acre ; part of it was manured in the hill with a mix- 
 ture of soil, stable and hen manure, and part with un- 
 leached ashes and plaster; and about one fourth of the 
 field with super phosphate of lime (Prof. Mapes' im- 
 proved, purchased of P. Morris & Co.,) about one gill of 
 which per hill was applied in the hill at the time of plant- 
 ing. I took notice as soon as the corn came itp that the 
 part of the field on which I had applied the super-phos- 
 phate, was of a brighter green and grew decidedly more 
 rapid and when we came to husk the corn it yielded from 
 ten to fifteen per cent more than the other portion of the 
 field. I entered my crop for the premiums offered by our
