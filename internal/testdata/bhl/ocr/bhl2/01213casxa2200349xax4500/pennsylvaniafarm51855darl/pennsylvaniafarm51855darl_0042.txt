THE FARM JOURNAL. 

[January 

into the secret of my good fortune. I am very sure that a 
 good wife is quite as useful to a farmer as a good horse ; but 
 I am not sure that a good wife for a farmer won't bo a scarce 
 article after while — the present generation of girls are get- 
 ting so many ridiculous notions in their heads. Therefore 
 if I can encourage the growth of good wives by telling the 
 printer of the farm journal about mine, I shall take as much 
 credit to myself as has been proclaimed due to the man that 
 makes two blades of grass grow where but one grew before." 
 Becky's reply to my long speech, was cut short by one of 
 the girls coming from the kitchen to invite her mother out 
 to taste the mince-meat to see if it was spiced according to 
 her notion, as a failure in tho mince pies for our Christmas 
 dinner would be a blunder, yet to be recorded in the house- 
 keeping history of Homespun Hall. But, Mr. Printer, while 
 Becky is out in the kitchen and the coast is clear for a gos- 
 sip, I will chat awhile with you about the Farm Journal. 
 From tho very first copy printed by my old friend Col. 
 Spangler, down to the present time, I have been its constant 
 reader, and, though I can boast of an apprenticeship of more 
 than forty years on a farm, I do not remember to have read 
 a single number of the Farm Journal, without getting some 
 direct practical information, or more expanded views of the 
 dignity and greatness of the farmer's calling, that more 
 than repaid me my subscription for the whole year. I 
 have taken two or three good Agricultural papers for a 
 great while, and I frequently noticed tho salutary influence 
 which that class of reading carries into a family of children 
 For a long time after the arrival of these papers, their con- 
 tents are the every day topics of discussion at the table and 
 the fireside. The housekeeping items are pounced upon by 
 Becky and the girls, who approve or condemn as they test 
 the merits or demerits of the various matters in their de- 
 partment, — while the boys take hold of such subjects as 
 manures, improved implements, Ac., and there is no end to 
 the experiments set afloat by reading the Farm Journal and 
 kindred works. The farmer's family, I am sure, can not 
 keep your Journal lying upon the table of the sitting room, 
 without having a spirit of enquiry stirred up in the house- 
 hold, and becoming more intelligent and better fitted to be 
 employed in one of the most ennobling vocations of man, Far 
 niing. I have long since satisfied myself that the true dig- 
 nity, tho real greatness of our calling, has never been appre- 
 ciated by the great mass of farmers. The idea is entirely 
 too prevalent, all tho world over, that any stupid country 
 bumpkin will mako a good farmer; hence if one of our sons 
 shows an inclination for books, or exhibits intellect beyond 
 driving a yoke of oxen, he is packed off to college to be ed- 
 ucated for a profession, while his less favored brother is lim- 
 ited to tho winter sessions of the public school, and kept 
 the remainder of the year at hard work on the farm, with- 
 out, perhaps, even the privilege of reading the Farm Jour- 
 nal to remove the mists of ignorance and prejudice from his 
 mind. IIis"thirst for knowledge" therefore, can readily be 
 slaked in tho pages of a Dutch almanac, studying out the 
 right "sign" to plant radishes or set a worm fence. Is it 
 any wonder that so many slurs are cast at us "Country Haw- 
 Bucks?" I am satisfied Mr. Printer, from personal observa- 
 tion, that quite a respectable doctor or lawyer can be made 
 out of a natural born fool, if he has good clothes and plenty 
 of assurance, but a good farmer can never bo manufactured 
 out of any such material. Hence the city merchant makes 
 a woful mistake when he sends his son to the country "to 
 learn to be a farmer" because he is not sharp enough to 
 drive a good bargain behind the counter; and it is about 
 time, in my opinion, that all the fools in the world were put 
 to somo other business than farming, for it is the last busi- 
 ness that "will pay," or become respectable, under the man- 

agement of any such slack-twisted specimens of humanity. 

Well, really, Mr. Printer, my paper is full before I have 
 had half of my talk out, — but if you don't get out of pa- 
 tience puzzling over my long yarns, and would like to hear 
 once in a while how we farmors in the Pequa valley manage 
 to get through the world, why. you will bo likely to hear 
 from me again. Yours to serve,

Extracts from an Address Delivered by C. P. Holcomb 

Esq., before tbe Montgomery County (Maryland) Ag- 
 ricultural Society. 

The permanent wealth of tho country undoubtedly con- 
 sists in tho landed estate of the country. It is a safe fund 
 for those to possess who make the acquisition, and it is a safe 
 fund for those to hold who inherit the property so acquired; 
 while that class whose cupidity induces them to seek the 
 highest paying stocks, may literally be said to "toil for heirs 
 we know not who." 

For some reasons already assigned, and for may others 
 that might be assigned, the landed class is undoubtedly to 
 constitute the first class in American society. They will be 
 more homogenous, constituting a distinct type. They will 
 be highly educated; the increasing wealth of the landed 
 proprietors will justify this. An elevated moral tone, a 
 gentle and high-bred courtesy should distinguish them, and 
 make them fit representatives of the best American society. 
 Where, as in our cities, fashion is allowed to govern, and 
 without much reforence to the antecedents of the party, ad- 
 mit, for most pait, such as can boast a palatial residenco, a 
 splendid equipage, and can afford to give elegant entertain- 
 ments ; such a circle, however elevated the character and 
 refinement of a portion of it may be, can never be consider- 
 ed, as a whole, as a polished, high, superior order of society, 
 or be allowed to pass as representing the first class of Ameri- 
 can society. 

Professional life has hitherto been much sought in this 
 country, and the learning and science it has embraced has 
 very properly given its members a high social position. But 
 the facilities to the admission to tho professions . will lower 
 the standard ; it has done so to some extent already, and the 
 same cause has greatly diminished the emoluments of pro- 
 fessional life, and the professions will be much less sought 
 hereafter, and agricultural pursuits, by this class, will be 
 much more frequently sought. 

Let me not be understood as saying that it will be for the 
 petty distinction of occupying the first place in fashionable 
 society that the landed interest will seek to highly educate 
 their sons and daughters This will follow. But more 
 worthy objects, more enlarged and patriotic views will have 
 reference to the wholesome action of the public mind, to the 
 safe and prosperous existence of our institutions.

But, to accomplish all these results, one thing is necessa- 
 ry. It is necessary that, in every dwelling and farm-house 
 in the land, from one end of the country to tho other, that 
 the mother should train; ay, and that the father ahould 
 train.' train! train! This is the word, if the goal is to be 
 reached. We have formerly trained our horses, trained our 
 dogs, trained our cattle. But a greater race is to come off, 
 we enter our children, our sons and our daughters, for the 
 great sweepstakes over tho Union course! Train, then, 
 early. Train late. Train in the nursery; train in the school 
 room; -train in the drawing room, and in the field, and train 
 at the altar. Erect your college courses. The farm of Sil- 
 ver Sprinsr, Francis P. Blair, Esq., has exhorted the Con-
