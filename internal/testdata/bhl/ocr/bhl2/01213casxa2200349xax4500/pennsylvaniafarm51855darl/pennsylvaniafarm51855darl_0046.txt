THE FARM JOURNAL. 

[January 

in November or December. Thus they will remain all win- 
 ter without injury from the frost. 

In spring they should have the cultivator run between 
 them again, and weeded, or another slight earthing given 
 thorn, which will groatly strengthen the plants. 

The quantity of seed to bo sown, should be from five to 
 eight pounds per acre, and this should be sown in the bed or 
 in the rows evenly. It is a great advantage, that the cost 
 of the seed is so trifling in proportion to the value of the 
 crop. 

It is ready to cut and reap when the upper branches turn 
 brown, which will be in June or July. Be sure not to let it 
 be too ripe, for if the pods be too dry at reaping, they will 
 shed the seed in the field, and cause much loss. 

It can be reaped in the same manner as wheat, but the 
 hand fulls should be laid singly and light upon the stubble, 
 behind the reapers, and thus it should lie without stirring, 
 until it is ready to thresh out, which will be in a short time, 
 particularly as generally at that time, theweather is dry and 
 warm. 

When it is ready and perfectly dry, prepare a floor in the 
 middle of the field, by levelling the ground, on which should 
 be spread a largo muslin cloth, twenty to thirty feet square; 
 spread the rows round, and thrash round. One man or a boy 
 to spread before the thrasher, and another to turn ; or it can 
 be thrashed by a thrashing machine, in this case taking care, 
 if the seed is intended to be thrashed on the barn floor, to 
 remove the plants on a large sheet, spread on the wagon, to 
 prevent loss of seed, by the jolting and shaking of the 
 wagon. 

The seed can then be stored in a dry and airy granary 
 until it is sent to be sold or crushed. 

The Rape, in good ground, well treated, does not fail to 
 make strong stems and succulent leaves, so that by the 
 middle or latter end of November, it will be strong enough 
 to bear pasturing; then turn in the sheep, but take care they 
 do not eat but just the loaves, which they will crop first, not 
 suffering them to touch the stalk?, as that would be injurious 
 to the plants. This will form one of the best pastures for 
 your sheep, if you keep any, and will make them fat and in 
 good condition; or the leaves can bo gathered for hogs or 
 cattle, but I do not advise by any means to turn in horned 
 cattlo or hogs, for the damage they will do to the stalks. 
 The only safe stock to turn into Rape, in my opinion, being 
 sheep. 

The produce of a-n acre of Rape, will be according to the 
 condition of the land, management and care, from twenty 
 bushels upwards to fifty, which will command from three 
 and a half to four dollars a bushel, in Philadelphia, New 
 York, Boston, or Baltimore. The yield will be materially 
 affected by the care given to it in thrashing it properly. 
 A very full crop will be from fifty to sixty bushels, and 
 upwards of eighty bushels have been and are raised fre- 
 quently in Flanders. 

Great advantage may be derived from cultivating it in 
 the following manner: 

Take half an acre of good land, or make it so by ma- 
 nuring, and work it a little better than ordinary land, or as 
 you should your garden. At mid-summer (June or July) 
 sow on this half acre, thirty pounds, or two pecks of Rape 
 seed — this will produce a plentiful crop, as few grains will 
 miss ; let them grow until the middle of September ; take 
 eight or ten acres of wheat or oats, or early corn ; plough 
 the stubble, and let it lie a month or six weeks to rot; 
 then plough it again; if the land has been manured pre- 
 viously well, it will thus be in good condition. 

Begin at one side, plough a furrow, sot the plants in the 
 furrow, at the distance of a foot, leaning against the side of 

the furrow; set the plough and make another furrow, at two 
 feet distant from the first, and in returning it will cover the 
 first furrow planted, and continue so until the whole field is 
 set.

Feeding Pigs. 

Pigs are very gross feeders, nothing comes amiss to a 
 greedy hog — roots, herbs, fruit, grain, flesh, fish, and even 
 hay, straw and fresh manure. In the fold yard and fallow 
 fields he is a very useful fellow; but in grazing lands he 
 does injury by rooting, by pulling up grass roots, and by hi? 
 dung proving nauseous to other stock. He is very soon 
 affected by change either of food or weather. Frozen swill 
 and putrid flesh are very pernicious. Night air and cold rains 
 are the great cause of every ill suffered by young pigs^ sour 
 milk, butter-milk, or bran mixed with water, will make them 
 scour; but steamed roots, mixed with meal, whey, or even 
 water, given warm and in warm sties, will make them thrive 
 faster than any other animal. Raw Potatoes or other roots 
 are injurious to them, while old pigs will get fat upon such 
 food. Pigs should not be put together for fattening in too 
 groat numbers. Few feeders take a physiological view of 
 the subject; nevertheless, they mostly adopt the principles. 
 Young pigs require those varieties of food most adapted to 
 promote the healthy development of frame — older pigs those 
 kinds that fatten fastest, hence Pea and Bean meal, Indian 
 meal, Oatmeal, milk, whey, Ac, are best for young pigs ; 
 while in addition to these potatoes and other roots, steamed 
 and Barley meal, greave-cakes, bran, pollard, Ac, are best 
 adapted to fatten older pigs; greave cakes are highly recom- 
 mended for quick fattening. It is improper in breeding to 
 put two animals together under any great disparity of kind 
 or circumstance — the produce will assuredly bo defective in 
 many points; there should be assimilation in size and frame. 
 It is best that the female should be of the larger breed in 
 crossing, and in all cases of attempted improvement, a fine 
 well-formed female must be selected. The most symmetri- 
 cal animals in all breeds have been produced from a rather 
 large, good, and well-made female, and a good male of mod- 
 erate size. Pigs will fatten rapidly on grains for a time, af- 
 terward they must have more nutritious food. 

Fatening on crude or dry grain is not good management; it 
 will sometimes cause death by swelling in the stomach, which, 
 indeed, it sometimes bursts after eating to excess; it should 
 always be soaked if given as grain— much better to grind it. 
 If made into malt, all the bettor. Barley bread or cake, 
 soaked in milk or whey, is said to be unsurpassed for effica- 
 cy in fattening. Bean-meal fattens rapidly, but makes the 
 bacon hard and 'craunehy.' Indian meal fattens very quickly, 
 and makes solid, firm good becon. Barley-meal is superior 
 to either, and produces excellent qnality in tho bacon. Pea- 
 meal, mixed with whey or milk, fattens young pigs admira- 
 bly, and produces the finest quality of pork. Wheat-meal: 
 this is too expensive, and only the coarsest kind is used; it 
 will fatten freely, but the meat is light and flabby. Oat-menl 
 fattens satisfactorily, and produces the most delicate meat as 
 to flavor. Tare-meal — a meal from Tares — is similar to 
 Bean-meal, but not equal to it in efficacy. Linseed meal fat- 
 tens very rapidly in mixtures with other meal, but make* 
 the bacon oily and flabby. Acorns and Beochmast are good 
 for store pigs, but fatten very slowly, and never well 
 Acorns produce good firm bacon; but the bacon from Beech- 
 mast feeding is coarse and flabby, with unsound oily fat. 
 Bran, pollard, and seeds of weeds are very slow fatoners. 
 Much more might be said, but I will merely add feed them 
 carefully from the first. — Ex.
