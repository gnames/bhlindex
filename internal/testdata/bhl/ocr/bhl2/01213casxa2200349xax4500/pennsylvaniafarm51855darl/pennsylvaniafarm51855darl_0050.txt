Agricultural Experiments at Moeckern on Sheep — Stall 

Keeping, Fattening, §c, §c. 

Having laid the avowed objects of the Agricultural 
 Investigation Station at Moeckern before the reader in 
 uy last, the present article shall be devoted to the man- 
 lier in which its operators have been carrying them out, 
 and the means they have employed for the same. This 
 [ shall endeavor to do, by condensing from their annual 
 reports, of which three have already been issued, vary- 
 ing in size from sixty to one hundred and seventy 
 ^ages. 

These reports are characterised by the same practical 
 bearing, which was so conspicuous in the plan of opera- 
 tion laid out by the committee for investigation. And 
 what is more they are original — entirely original ; an 
 attribute of which few in these days of copying can 
 boast. But since the circumstances of the places are so 
 'liferent from the agricultural affairs of the United 
 States, the experiments will lose the value for the trans- 
 Atlantic farmer which they have for the German. Yet 
 to suggest plans of operation in our own country they 
 are excellent. The question, what are we ignorant of, 
 and what do we wish to learn, should proceed every ra- 
 tional investigation. 

In the days of our great-grandfathers, when farmers 
 lisdained agricultural reading, and wanted no better 
 vidence that a thing was false than that it was in the 
 newspapers, and boys knew no further use for books 
 'iian to confer a good threshing upon them for the half 
 - ommitted lessons they contained — in such good old 
 -imes it would have been almost an insult to the intelli- 
 gence of the wielder of poverty's staff beneath the 
 1 hatched roof, beside the old barrack and open cow-yard 
 with a barbarous mud hole in the middle of it, to pro- 
 pose such a question for his consideration. 

But the more enlightened views of our reading agri- 
 culturists of the present day know full well that this 
 question can, even yet, with some degree of propriety, 
 be asked. But with what unhesitating confidence these 
 veterans of the barshare plough (there are none such 
 now) could defy the efforts of those who would mention 
 uch a thing as scientific farming in their ears. "You 
 talk about scientific farming, the philosophy of deep 
 plowing, &c. I know more about farming, &c, &c." 

But their day is past ; they cut down our rough for- 
 ests, and did much good for us — peace to their ashes ; 
 yet, perhaps it be cruel to do so, one cannot help wish- 
 ing that a few of these old men had been spared, or that 
 •hey had some like descendants in this generation, till 
 we could have the pleasure of collecting them together, 
 and after their honest protestations against any necessi- 
 ty for more knowledge on the subject of their art, the 
 following questions were put to them. 

1. How much corn, oats, beans or potatoes, is required 
 to keep cows, oxen, sheep and swine ; what fraction of 
 the weight of such animals, of each of these substances, 
 will do it ? 

2. What is the most profitable mixture of the above 
 concentrated foods with hay, straw and chaff, to keep 
 stock with the least expense ? 

3. What quantity of each article of food has the 

greatest fattening power, and what is its relation to the 
 other substances in this respect ? 

4. What admixture of light food, (hay, straw, &c.,) 
 with concentrated food (carrots, &c.,) will produce the 
 most fat with the least expense ? That is, what relation 
 should the nitrogenous (nutricious) substances of the 
 food bear to the non-nitrogenous (not nutricious, not 
 capable of producing flesh and blood) in order that the 
 digestive system of the animal may extract all the for- 
 mer (the nitrogenous) and manufacture it into flesh, that 
 none may be found in the excrements ? 

5. How much of each of the foregoing foods is equiv- 
 alent to, or can produce, one hundred pounds of flesh 
 and fat. 

6. What is the value of the above foods to supply 
 milk, and to sustain strength in working cattle ? 

We will not multiply the above questions at present, 
 or complicate them by asking the modifications produced 
 by temperature and other controlling agents, but merely 
 require that the answers be given, and the facts upon 
 which they are founded definitely stated. 

The assertion is safe that there are not known facts in 
 the agricultural world sufficient to found a rational an- 
 swer to these questions on. Many will answer about 
 two bitshels of oats are equal to a bushel of corn, and 
 about twenty bushels of corn are equal to a ton of hay, 
 &c, &c. And why ? Because the prices are about in 
 this ratio. There is "about" as much relation between 
 the datum upon which such answers are given, and that 
 upon which alone their solution can depend, as there is 
 between the price of a hoe harrow and the time required 
 to plow a field. Suppose the same about system was 
 generally followed in surveying land, what would be the 
 result ? Sometimes it has been followed, as thousands 
 of dollars spent in worrying law-suits about old half re- 
 corded land marks testify. Yet at this day, the want of 
 proper land marks in the field of agriculture is causing 
 a thousand times more waste of money than ever was 
 pocketed by lawyers, for talking about the probabilities 
 of this stone, or that stake, or the other marked tree, 
 being the one that some old-time, inaccurate, careless 
 surveyor had in his mind, as he went blundering along 
 about on the line one hundred years ago. 

The first experiment made in the Moeckern institution 
 had for its object the solution of some of the above ques- 
 tions. To accomplish which, with regard to sheep, 
 twenty-one sound, healthy, two-year old Merino wethers 
 were selected from a large flock, in order to get them of 
 as near the same size and appearance as possible. They 
 were fed from the 9th to the 23d of March on the same 
 kind of food (wheat straw and second crop hay, the lat- 
 ter such a mixture as usually grows on the better class 
 of meadow land,) with as much as they would eat. On 
 the 24th of March the trial commenced. They were all 
 weighed and divided into seven stalls, three in each 
 stall. The food for trial was rye meal (rye ground down, 
 not sifted), rye bran (from what I have seen of the wind 
 mill ground grain here I think the bran is richer than 
 ours), potatoes (not of the very best quality), rape cake 
 (the residue of the vegetable oil process here, which is 
 very extensively carried on, it corresponds in some de- 
 gree to the pummace of the cider mill), linseed cake 
 (similar to the last, except that it is produced from flax-
