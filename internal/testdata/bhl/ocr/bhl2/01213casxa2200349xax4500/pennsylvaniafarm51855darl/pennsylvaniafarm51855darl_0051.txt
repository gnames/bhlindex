seed instead of brassica rapus), barley, ground down, 
 and ground oats, and not very good hay the first win-

The entry was supplied with thermometer, weigh 
 scales, meal chest, and all necessary apparatus, with a 
 large black-board to record the amount of substances 
 fed, the temperature, &c, till it was more permanently 
 recorded. They were fed three times daily, seven o'- 
 clock, morning, only hay, at 1 P. M. a little hay and 
 half a pound of the concentrated food, and at 7 P. M. 
 the same quantity of food as at noon. The stall 1 re- 
 ceived a like quantity of hay at each foddering. The 
 temperature of the air at each foddering was recorded. 
 Each morning at seven o'clock, after the first fodder had 
 been distributed, each stall received a portion of fresh 
 water, (varying from sixteen to twenty pounds,) which 
 was also accui-ately weighed. 

The animals were all weighed every Saturday after- 
 noon, or Sunday morning before the first foddering. 
 Three trials were made of them. 

FIRST TRIAL. 

The object of which was to learn the amount of food 
 required to keep sheep without increase or decrease of 
 weight:

 The manure was weighed on the 23d of May, at which 

time the sheep were allowed to remain out of the stalls 
 part of the day. The manure was then made between 
 the 24th of March and the 23d of May. 

The second and third of the above columns gives the 
 weight at the commencement and end of the trial, which 
 was continued till the weight became constant for each 
 week. Each number is the sum of the weight of three 
 sheep. To show the weight and its variations each week 
 I will select a single example, stall III weighed each 
 successive week from first to last : 257, 236, 228, 237, 
 325, 233, 235, 229, 225, and lastly 231. The great loss 
 of weight the first week must not be attributed to loss 
 of fat and flesh, but to the more concentrated food ma- 
 king less weight in the stomach. The last four or six 
 weeks show variations back and forth, consequently 
 proving that the fodder can keep the sheep at this weight. 
 For a few days at first some of the stalls did not eat all 
 their food, but they cleaned all up before the close of 
 the first week, so that half an hour after feeding not a 
 vestige remained. They all continued healthv and 
 hearty during the trial. In the 

SECOND TRIAL 

All the precautions and observations were attended to 
 as in the first. The fodder was changed, thus the stall 
 1 received nine pounds of hay, and all the rest the same 
 hay as in the first trial; but their solid food was doubled, 
 each stall receiving three pounds daily, except that VI 
 and VII had, the former three pounds of barley and the 

last three pounds of oats, instead of potatoes and beets. 
 The same sheep were experimented upon, and the weight 
 obtained was (the sheep having been sheared) : 

I. II. III. IV. V. VI. VII. 
 June 1, 228 233 213 206 200 214 22 
 July 27, 244 263 233 232 226 240 23 7 
 And as an example of the weight at the end of each 
 week stall III gave 213, 210, 223, 217, 225, 228, 232, 
 229, 238, and lastly 233. We thus have the datum for 
 getting the ratio between the food and this weight and 
 increase of fatness in sheep. The hay was of better 
 quality than that of the first trial, and from the 15th of 
 July they received new hay. The food was all eaten up 
 by the sheep from the first, and they continued healthy 
 and brisk. The manure was also accurately weighed at 
 the close of the trial. They received four pounds of rye 
 straw weekly to each stall ; and in the last and 

THIRD TRIAL, 

which commenced on the 27th of July, the food wa? 
 again changed by increasing the hay of stall 1 to eleven 
 pounds, and the hay of all the others to six pounds, 
 daily. This was a fattening food, but with quite differ- 
 ent results. Stall 1 received in the morning four pounds, 
 and at the other two fodderings three and a half pounds 
 each of hay. The other stalls received three pounds of 
 hay in the morning and one and a half pounds at the 
 other fodderings.

 They also received some salt once a week. 

By the above it will be seen that sheep drink more 
 water with barley, oats, linseed cake and hay, than with 
 rye and rye bran, and that the manure is in proportion 
 to the water drank. It also was found on analysis to 
 contain more water, so that there would not be so much 
 difference in the water-free manure. The state of the 
 weather was also found to make a difference in the quan- 
 tity of manure. In warm weather it is materially les ■: 
 with the same quantity of food, owing no doubt to a 
 greater portion of water passing iff in perspiration, as 
 well as evaporation in the stall. Tl e fleece of the sheep 
 fed on hay was black and dirty, more so than any of the 
 rest, and on slaughtering weighed decidedly the most. 
 The fleeces of IV and V were remarkably clean and 
 white, which was supposed to be due to less oil bein^ 
 distributed upon the fleece, as the result of the rape ami 
 linseed cake feeding. The manure from the cake show- 
 ed the greatest amount of unappropriated nitrogenous 
 (nutricious) substance. The conclusion was that it was 
 not mixed in as suitable proportions as the other sub- 
 stances. 

In the first trial (for stall keeping) the sheep eats its 
 weight of hay in thirty-four days, in the second trial 
 (preparation for fattening) in twenty-seven days, and in 
 the third trial (for fattening) in twenty-five days. The 
 best substances for keeping were found not to be the
