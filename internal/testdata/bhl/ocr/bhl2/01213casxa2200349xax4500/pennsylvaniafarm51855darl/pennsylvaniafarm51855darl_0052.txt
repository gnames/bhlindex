the best for fattening, and it is not very easy to find an 
 unobjectionable rule for calculating the results obtained 
 from the experiments made. 

For instance : If on two sheep of equal weight, seven 
 pounds of hay produce precisely the same result on one, 
 as four lbs. of hay and one and a half lbs. of rye bran 
 do on the other, it by no means follows that three pounds 
 of hay are equal to one and a half pounds of bran. If 
 such were the case, by simple calculation, (3 : l*! - : : 7 
 is to 3£) we would have three and half pounds of bran 
 the daily food of a sheep, which is absurd ; we have 4 
 lbs. hay and 3 lbs. hay equal to 4 lbs. hay and 1$ lbs. 
 bran, but we can't here take equals (4 lbs.) from equals 
 and have equals, or 3 lbs. hay and l? r lbs. bran. 

We can only say that 1$ lbs. of bran (mixed with 4 
 B>s. of hay) are in effect to 3 lbs. of hay (mixed with 4 
 lbs. of hay). Then it is altogether dependent upon the 
 relative price of bran, or hay, which we bad better use, 
 all hay, or part bran ; and so of the other concentrated 
 foods. But there is a certain relation that hay cau be 
 mixed with concentrated foods that will produce the 
 greatest effect with the least quantity. This relation is 
 different for keeping from what it is for fattening, and it 
 can only be learned by direct experiment, and from the 
 relation of the foods thus obtained we can calculate their 
 relative values. The experiments at Moeckern seem to 
 lead pretty satisfactorily to the conclusion that 100 lbs. 
 of hay was equal to 43.99 rye meal, or 54.65 rye bran, 
 or 58. GO rape cake, or 64.38 linseed cake, or 215.05 po- 
 tatoes, or 444.85 of beets, for the purposes of stall keep- 
 ing — at least these are the exact results obtained in the 
 first trial, where 3-7 of the hay was replaced by the food 
 it is compared with here. 

For fattening, as found in the third trial, the results 
 showed that 100 lbs. hay was equal to 51.53 lbs. rye, or 
 59.41 bran, or 58.59 rape cake, or 63.69 linseed cake, or 
 54.95 barley, or 60.61 oats. For all the experiments 
 bran gave a surprisingly good result. 

The fodder was analysed, and its starch, gum, sugar, 
 dextrine, pectin, pectic acid, albumin, caseine, fibrine fat, 
 water, mucic acid, nitrogenous substances, ashes, sand, 
 &c, estimated, and from the results some of the fore- 
 going conclusions are in part derived ; but as the raising 
 of sheep is not so important in Pennsylvania as here, 
 probably the above sketch is quite as much as will be of 
 interest to the reader. I give it more to show what the 
 station is doing, and what such places can do, than for 
 its practical importance in America, where different fod- 
 ders would require the same kind of experiments re- 
 peated with different articles of food. 

The labor of carrying out such experiments is im- 
 mense, several thousand weighings of weight from that 
 of a sheep down to less than a flea being required. But 
 nothing short of these can accomplish the object desired, 
 and when stations spring up over the civilized agricul- 
 tural world, and they exchange reports and compare 
 notes and labor for a few years, the questions proposed 
 to the old farmers at the outset will find a solution. 

I shall in the succeeding letters notice the experi- 
 ments with crops and with cows, and finally the experi- 
 ments of the coming winter with swine. Adieu,

Vegetable Seeds. 

Mr. Darlington: — Perhaps there are few farmers 
 who have not been very frequently disappointed in their 
 crop of vegetables, both in field and garden, from de- 
 fective seeds, and there is no one department of rural 
 economy where want of care in selection, growth, and 
 knowledge of the habits of certain varieties to mix with 
 each other, occasions such a positive and irreparable 
 loss. A farmer at the usual time for sowing (and un- 
 fortunately there is but one right time for May crops.) 
 sows in his field for part of his winter supplies a crop of 
 carrots, beets, turnips or cabbages. Many kinds of 
 seeds, such as cabbage or turnip, are very similar ; the 
 growth of many varieties of the same species are the 
 same, and he has no way to ascertain till near the time 
 of gathering, and too late for replanting, that his ex- 
 pected crop of large orange or Altringham carrots are 
 the early Horn variety, that his large sized drumheads, 
 so noted for a profusion of leaves and immense heads, 
 are a much smaller kind, and that his turnips are mixed 
 up of half a dozen sorts and shapes of no market value 
 whatever. 

The writer of this was once deceived in this way with 
 more than an acre of turnips, which grew finely, but 
 upon gathering yielded only five or six bushels fit for 
 market, the rest being many of them shaped like a car- 
 rot, and there were at least half a dozen kinds. The 
 seed had evidently been grown contiguous to other 
 plants of the same natural family. 

Now what is the remedy for this great evil ? A man 
 buying a few yards of cloth or calico can easily detect 
 by examination any imperfection, but in the matter of 
 seeds he must depend on the seller, and has no means of 
 detecting a mistake till too late for remedy, and the loss 
 is often very heavy, the mere cost of the seed itself be- 
 ing of no importance. 

In my own experience, Mr. Editor, I have been more 
 unfortunate in seeds purchased of farmers than from seeds- 
 men, and was long puzzled to account for it, particularly 
 a.s I often read in your and other agricultural papers 
 advice to farmers to grow their own seeds, in order to 
 be certain of their genuineness. Reflection, observation, 
 and some little experience, have satisfied me that it has 
 resulted often from real ignorance among farmers ; that 
 there is an art in the business, which consists partly in 
 keeping the same family of plants widely enough sepa- 
 rated, in selecting such portions of the seed as are found 
 to be generally most productive, and also in choosing at 
 first pure specimens to grow seed from. Cabbages, tur- 
 nips, parsnips, and indeed nearly all other vegetables, I 
 have also been told, must always be transplanted before 
 being allowed to run up to seed, otherwise it will not be 
 very reliable. This many of us have proved by plant- 
 ing seed from a chance vegetable of any kind, which 
 has happened to grow up in some neglected corner of 
 the garden. 

Safety in this, as in other business, depends on a prc- 
 per division of labor. The growing of seeds is a dis- 
 tinct business from farming or growing vegetables, re- 
 quires long practice and experience to understand it 
 propei-ly, and a very nice and discriminating perception. 
 I am informed our most careful seed growers always 
 raise nearly double the quantity of any particular crop
