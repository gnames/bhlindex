"Free Martin" Cows. 

The following communication from onr friend Dr. Win. 
 H. Worthington contains some interesting facts, and will 
 throw additional light upon the mystery that has en- 
 veloped that "very singular anomaly in natural his- 
 tory," the sterility of Free-Martin cows. By way of 
 introduction to the Doctor's remarks, we append the fol- 
 lowing notice of "Free-Martins," by Youatt, in his ex- 
 cellent work on cattle : 

"The opinion has prevailed among breeders from time 
 out of date, that when a cow produces two calves, one 
 of them a bull-calf and the other a heifer calf, the male 
 may become a perfect and useful bull, but the female 
 will be incapable of propagation. The curious name of 
 free-martin has been given to this animal. That accurate 
 inquirer, Mr. John Hunter, spared no pains or expense 
 to ascertain the real foundation of this belief ; and he 
 availed himself of the opportunity of examining three of 
 these free-martins. In all of them there was a greater 
 nr less deviation from the external form and appearance 
 ■>f the cow; and in the head and the horns some ap- 
 proach to those of the ox; while neither of them had 
 shown any propensity to breed. The teats were smaller 
 than is usual in the heifer; but the outward appearance 
 of the bearing was the same. 

"They were slaughtered, and he examined the inter- 
 nal structure of the sexual parts : he found in all of 
 them a greater or less deviation from the form of the 
 female, and the addition of some of the organs peculiar 
 to the male; and he ascertained that they were in fact 
 hermaphrodites. 

"It is not then a mere vulgar error that the female 
 twin is barren; on the other hand, there are several well 
 :r.ithenticated instances of these free-martins having 
 bred. 

"It would hence appear that the rule is, and a very 
 singular anomaly in natural history it is, that the female 
 twin is barren, because she is an hermaphrodite; but in 
 some cases, there not being this admixture of the organs 
 of different sexes, or those of the female prevailing, she 
 is capable of breeding. If the free-martin have entire- 
 ly the appearance of a cow, she will breed; if she be 
 coarse in the horn, and ox-like, she will be barren." 

West Chester, Jan. 2, 1855. 

J. Lacet Darlington, Esq. : — The cause of sterility 
 in Free-Martin cows having engaged the attention of a 
 gentleman of science, who had never seen an article 
 purporting to explain it, through his instrumentality I 
 was placed in possession of the genital organs of a heifer 
 (if this description for examination. The result of 
 which being deemed important to your readers as breed- 
 ers of stock, I have concluded to send them to you with 
 a drawing of the parts for publication. 

Webster describes a Free-Martin cow thus: — "When 
 ;;t twin births the mother has a male and the other ap- 
 parently a female, the latter is most generally (but not 
 invariably) barren, and, on dissection, will be found to 
 have some organs of each sex, but neither perfect." 

Among most of the farmers a cow of this character is 
 deemed invariably sterile, and if the organs of all were 
 like the one examined, it would not be surprising that 
 such should be the case, but this most probably is not 

so. To enable us to satisfy ourselves and to settle the 
 cpuestion satisfactorily, I would request of those who 
 may have, or know of any one having in their posses- 
 sion, an animal of this kind, that they will, when 
 slaughtered, forward the organs of generation to your 
 care for further examination. 

The annexed sketch will more clearly demonstrate the 
 condition of things found as described below : 

■Zfmm 

Vagina or funnel. 

Cordy condition of peretoneum. 

Cornua. 

Impervious fallopian tubes. 

Ovaries or pink colored bodies. 

Continuation of pink colored bodies. 

Peretoneum. 

H. H. External parts with their hairy investment. 
 The organs having been carefully examined external- 
 ly, the dissection was commenced at the external orifice 
 of the vagina, A (or funnel as it is commonly called 
 among farmers,) and opened longitudinally to the extent 
 of seven inches, where it terminates in a cul-de-sac ; 
 funnel shaped ; the apex being at the upper internal 
 part. The diameter of the external orifice when laid 
 open was three inches. Above the termination of the 
 vaginal canal there was to the extent of five inches no 
 opening, but simply a thickened cordy condition of the 
 peretoneum, B, when there commenced a cavity lined by 
 mucous membrane, and running out at acute angles, two 
 cornua, C. C, three and a half inches long, the right 
 one inch, the left three-quarters of an inch, in width. 
 At the upper external angle of these hollow cornua were 
 found abortive fallopian tubes, D. D., impervious, of one 
 and a quarter inches long, when a pink body, one inch 
 in length, E. E., and one-half an inch in thickness, sup- 
 posed to be imperfect ovaries were found, they tapered 
 down to a line of the same color, and continuing about 
 three inches they were lost in a duplicature of the pere- 
 toneum, F. F. ; G. G. shows the peretoneum spread out ; 
 H. H. shows the external parts covered with their hairy 
 investment.
