Such is a brief account of the result of the examina- 
 tion made, and contains all the important facts elicited. 
 It will be seen that no womb was found, an imperfect 
 vagina and ovaria, with impervious fallopian tubes, and 
 no evidence of the fimbriated extremity of these tubes. 
 It will not, therefore, be thought strange that amid all 
 this imperfection on the parts of nature to adapt her 
 organs to the accomplishment of such a complex process 
 as that of reproduction, that she should be sterile. 

That all Free-Martins are organized in the same 
 rianner is hardly possible ; there may be other changes 
 from a normal condition of the parts than was found in 
 this case, yet explaining as clearly as this the cause of 
 their sterility, and it is to be hoped that the farmers, 
 who are to be benefitted by the investigation, will inter- 
 est themselves in procuring specimens for a more thor- 
 ough elucidation of this subject. Yours,

 Out West — State Fairs— National Cattle Show, &c. 
 Many departments of the Ohio State Fair were defici- 
 ent in consequence of the extremely dry season. Of live 
 stock throughout there was a very respectable show; the 
 grounds and fixings were good, but the railroad facilities 
 snd the small, town accommodations were not equal to 
 the occasion ; yet if we could get a rail to sleep on and 
 ;i yard of tape for covering for fifty cents, we should not 
 complain. There was much of the game played there 
 that was complained of at our State Fair — of a whole 
 neighborhood coming in by one ticket or badge. The 
 plan adopted at the National Cattle Show at Springfield, 
 Ohio, was much more effective. They sold to persons 
 f >r the three days admission three tickets for one dollar, 
 marked Wednesday, Thursday and Friday ; and on en- 
 tering give up one of the tickets each day, and should 
 you wish to go out and return the same day, an officer 
 was at the gate with little exit tickets which he would 
 give you to be given up again on your return. This 
 plan, I believe, had the desired effect, and this or some 
 similar plan will have to be adopted at fairs generally to 
 avoid so much fraud. The single tickets at this show 
 were 37£ cents. I was much pleased with the exhibi- 
 tion throughout at the National Cattle Show, but as an 
 account of it has already been published, I need only 
 say that we had a fine big dinner on the ground, and 
 some short but very fine speeches upon agricultural sub- 
 jects by Gov. Wright, of Indiana, Cassias M. Clay, of 
 Kentucky, Ashew, of Canada, Allen, ,of New York, II ol- 
 comb, of Delaware, &c. The inhabitants of Clark coun- 
 ty, where the cattle show was held, are quite ambitious 
 upon the improved cattle subject, and have some very 
 fine imported Durhams — one of which I saw, a two-year 
 old bull, cost $3500. This is a fine district for stock. 
 The Mad River valley passes through it, and affords fine 
 pasture. This and the adjoining county of Montgomery 
 are thickly settled, being about sixty-two persons to the 
 square mile. There is a great deficiency in farm build- 
 ing, there being very few barns or good shelter for stock; 
 no where else could I find such buildings or agricultural 
 improvements as are to be found in eastern Pennsylva- 
 nia. In Wayne county, Indiana, I saw some pretty well 
 done up farms, and some fine lots of improved sheep and 

cattle. Governor Wright has a large room in the capi- 
 tol at Indianapolis wholly occupied as a Farm Library, 
 with thousands of volumes on the subject of agriculture, 
 minerals, implements, &c, and seems to take pride in 
 showing these things to persons interested in the sub- 
 ject. He is President of the State Society, and takes 
 quite an interest in promoting agricultural improvement. 

Corn and pork is the principal staple of this State, and 
 Cincinnati is their chief market, to which they have one 
 railroad finished and one or two more in progress. The 
 dry season has shortened their corn crop, which will ne- 
 cessarily shorten the pork crop. Corn will be scarce in 
 Ohio and Illinois also. Railroads in those States are 
 numerous, running in every direction, connecting at al- 
 most every place of any importance, and I should judge 
 from the amount of travel and freight, that they arc 
 generally good stock. There are some very extensive 
 farmers in Illinois, who occupy and stock from 500 to 
 2,500 acres. Many thousands of cattle are fattened, 
 drove to Chicago, slaughtered, and packed for foreign 
 markets; and many thousands drove east and west t<> 
 furnish beef for the seaboard towns and stock for the 
 new States and Territories. Iowa is settling so rapidly 
 that it takes many thousand cattle annually to supply 
 them with stock. They have rich land there, but a 
 great deficiency of stone and timber for building, &c. 
 The State is chiefly prairie, and too cold and dry through 
 the winter for winter wheat. They sow spring wheat, 
 and while there in October I did not see a green field in 
 the State. The grass, principally prairie, was all dead 
 and dry, and many hundreds of acres of it on fire. They 
 burn off the old grass every fall. Land sells from $1 25 
 to $40 per acre, according to location and improvement. 

I was somewhat surprised that the farmers of these 
 States (whose principal business is pork growing,) had 
 paid so little attention to improving their hogs; they 
 might just as well have a breed that would make fifty 
 pounds more pork per hog with the same feed. There 
 are a few exceptions among the Ohio and Indiana far- 
 mers — they have made some valuable improvements, 
 which I think others would do well to follow. Yv'here a 
 farmer kept from 50 to 500 hogs, if he got a breed that 
 only made five or ten pounds more it would be quite an 
 object, and would pay well for a little extra expense in 
 procuring a pair or two from a distance. 

Agriculture being the business of the United States — 
 five million of farmers now being engaged in it — and 
 more capital employed in it than in all other pursuits 
 combined, and what have the agriculturists received from 
 Government, which is every year making appropriations 
 to advance almost every other important or unimportant 
 branch of business. They have given us only the Pa- 
 tent Office Reports, good enough as far as they go, but. 
 unless a prominent political farmer, we are not likely to 
 see even that. We want more aid, we ought to ask for 
 more, we ought to, and we will, insist on more. If it is 
 because we have so few farmers in the National Legis- 
 lature to urge our claims we will send more there. We 
 want an Agricultural Bureau established — a national one 
 — to give its undivided attention to rural affairs. We 
 want an Agriculturr 1 College, Experimental Farm, &c. 
 with publications to issue, teeming with agricultural 
 knowledge, and so directed that every farmer may re-
