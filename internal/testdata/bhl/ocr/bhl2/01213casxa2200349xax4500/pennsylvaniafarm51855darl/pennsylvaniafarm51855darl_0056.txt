ceive benefit therefrom. It Would take but a small pit- 
 tance of government funds compared with those ex- 
 pended in unimportant expeditions, &c. Governments 
 generally legislate for and aid the agricultural interest 
 of their constituents, but the United States agriculturists 
 work independent of government aid. They sustain 
 more agricultural papers than all the rest of the wdlid. 
 These papers are doing a great good, and should receive 
 aid from every farmer. THOMAS WOOD.

To Destroy Moles. 

To the Editor of the Farm Journal: — I take this op- 
 portunity of answering the enquiry of John Kelsey in 
 the December number of the Farm Journal. In the 
 springs of 1850 and '51, I was annoyed with moles and 
 ground mice beyond endurance. My garden, and even 
 my potatoes, were subject to their depredations. I first 
 tried trapping, but all to little or no purpose. I next 
 set about discovering a remeny in the shape of poisoned 
 corn, which proved a very effectual one. I procured 
 some of the roots of the plant known by the name of 
 hellebore ; I then boiled it in a sufficient quantity of 
 water to make a strong liquor, and put the corn to soak 
 in it until perfectly swelled, when it is fit for use ; and 
 to my great satisfaction it entirely enterminated all 
 moles and ground mice. It is also very good to stop 
 Mister crow, black bird, or chicken, from taking up corn 
 in the field. It will kill every thing that eats it, and it 
 does not appear to hurt the germination of the com, 
 providing the corn is not put to soak while the liquor is 
 hot. Yours truly, HWD. WILLIAMSON.

Ch6ap Ico House. 

As many farmers have probably neglected the build- 
 ing of a substantial and commodious ice house in the 
 proper season, I propose a cheap and convenient mode 
 of constructing a small ice house for domestic pur- 
 poses. 

The two most important requisites in a family ice house 
 are, exclusion of surrounding atmosphere and rapid 
 drainage. There is some disagreement as to which, on 
 the whole, is the best, an ice house built wholly above, 
 or partly below the surface of the ground. Either plan 
 though, if properly constructed, will preserve ice ac- 
 cording to their capacity, in the warmest seasons. 

The following is about the cheapest plan of preserving 
 ice, all things considered, in use: "Select a dry site — 
 clean off a spot eight feet square — in each corner plant 
 a pest. Let the front posts be ten feet high and the 
 back posts seven, which will give three feet of a slant 
 tor the roof — fasten any common boards to the outside 
 of these posts by nailing them or otherwise — extending 
 them to the roof on all sides except the front, which 
 may not be extended higher than seven feet, allowing 
 the remaining three for ventilation and passage way. 

The hull of your house being finished, you commence 
 in the inside by placing a layer of sawdust in the bot- 
 tom, twelve or more inches deep, over which place some 
 loose boards to support the ice — on these boards you 
 place a tower of ice six feet square, which leaves a space 
 of one foot between the ice and the wall, which is to be 

packed tight with sawdust — all the crevices between the 
 ice in packing should be closely filled up with the same, 
 and about eighteen or twenty inches on the top — tho 
 whole to be capped with a good water proof roof, and it 
 is finished." J. GORSUCH.

The Crawford County Agricultural F?.ir. 

In our notices of Agricultural Fairs we omitted that of 
 Crawford county, or rather Ave had not the data from 
 which to compile a notice- — neither letter nor newspaper 
 containing a report reaching us in season. Our friend 
 R. Ljde White, Esq., of the "Banner," recently supplied 
 this deficiency. We append the principal paragraphs of 
 his editorial notice. Mr. White will please accept our 
 thanks for this and other favors : 

"The exhibition of stock, especially cattle, cannot be 
 excelled, if equalled, by any county in the State. It did 
 more credit to the enterprise" and judgment of our far- 
 mers than any thing else at the Fair. AVe have attended 
 a good many Fairs, but never saw a better show of cat- 
 tle. In this respect we believe Crawford county is ahead 
 of any other in the State. 

"The exhibition of swine and sheep was just about so 
 so — nothing extra — if any thing it was inferior to any 
 we have seen heretofore in other places. There is great 
 room for improvement in both those classes of stock. 

"There was quite a large number of horses on the 
 ground, but not more than one-half of them were worth 
 taking to a Fair. The better portion of them made a 
 very respectable appearance, and their owners deserve 
 credit for the pains they have taken to secure good 
 stock. We are far from believing, however, that the 
 exhibition of horses was a fair show of what our county 
 can do in that line. From the interest manifested in 
 that department we may look for something rare next 
 year. This part of the exhibition was pronounced by 
 those from a distance to be superior to any of the kind 
 they had witnessed in New York State or Ohio. The 
 same remark was also made in regard to the cattle 
 show. 

"The show of crops, fruits, vegetables, &c, was tole- 
 rable — nothing more— but was as good as could be ex- 
 pected this year. We noticed two or three specimens of 
 corn which were very good — what was of them. The 
 specimens of grapes were as good as can be seen any 
 where in this section of the Union, or perhaps any oth- 
 er. 

"The poultry was fine. The Shanghaes and other 
 long-legged species predominated, but whether they will 
 be in the end considered the most profitable remains to 
 be proven. The Society offered no premiums on Poland 
 fowls, and none of that kind were exhibited ; but we 
 venture the opinion that they are the most profitable and 
 handsomest species of poultry in the country. 

"The ladies' department of the Fair was very good, 
 but the chance to see what they exhibited was very poor. 
 We hope the Society will make better arrangements for 
 them hereafter. Their exhibition of manufactured and 
 fancy articles was as far ahead of that of the "sterner 
 sex" as it well could be. Quilts of the most beautiful 
 style, tidies of the neatest workmanship, and a thousand 
 articles of utility and beauty, were spread before the
