The rapid, settlement of lands in the west has dimin- 
 ished the supply, of stock cattle eastward, and turned it 
 westward. We believe, by using improved breeds, hav- 
 ing suitable protection in the barnyard, devoting a cer- 
 tain space to root culture, and stimulating growth of 
 calves a little during their first year, when they most re- 
 quire it, many of our Pennsylvania farmers will find it 
 to their interest to raise instead of buying their stock.

Coveney's "Economical" Manure. 

This article enjoys a reputation in England similar to 
 some of the patent manures of this country, and like the 
 latter, although advertised as adapted to all soils and all 
 articles of vegetable growth, it not unfrequently entire- 
 ly fails in producing good effect, but even sometimes 
 proves deleterious. From the following report of a trial 
 in the Court of Exchequer, the defendant was released 
 from payment of the cost of the manure on the ground 
 that he received a spurious article, although he obtained 
 it at the manufactory of the patentee. Some of our 
 correspondents who complain of not receiving the re- 
 turns expected from superphosphates, &c, may find in 
 the verdict a possible cause : 

Court of Exchequer — Wednesday. (Sittings at Nisi 
 Frius at Guildhall, before the Lord Chief Baron and a 
 Common Jury.) Coveney vs. Lovick. — Mr. M. Cham- 
 bers and Mr. James appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. 
 Atherton and Mr. IIoll for the defendant. The defen- 
 dant in this action is a farmer, who occupies 600 acres 
 of land in Norfolk, under the Earl of Leicester ; and the 
 plaintiff is the agent of a M. Papillot, a manufacturing 
 chemist, and the inventor of the British Economical 
 Manure, which it is almost unnecessary to state was, in 
 the language of the advertisements, endowed with every 
 fructifying quality that can be conceived, as well as the 
 advantage of drawing to the soil the moisture of the at- 
 mosphere. Attracted by these, Mr. Lovick purchased a 
 considerable quantity for 111., applied it to dress his - 
 turnip land, and waited anxiously for the result. In 
 due course the turnips came up ; but instead of attain- 
 ing the corpulence of a turnip, they never exceeded that 
 of a good-sized radish, and for the most part were never 
 gathered. The season, moreover, was very dry, and the 
 moisture which ought, under the influence of the ma- 
 nure, to have been deposited, remained, so far as the de- 
 fendant was concerned, with all its other advantages, in 
 nubibus. Such being the state of things, the defendant 
 refused to pay the price, on the ground that the article 
 furnished was not the genuine British Economical Ma- 
 nure. The fertilizing powers of the real thing might 
 be, and probably were, excellent ; but if that were so, 
 Mr. Lovick had not received what he had ordered, and 
 was not, therefore, bound to pay for it. On the other 
 wide arguments were used to show that the ingredients 
 of the manure had beed misused by the defendant him- 
 self, by being mixed in improper proportions, and that 
 the plaintiff could not be responsible for the defendant's 

negligence The jury eventually gave a verdict for the 
 defendant, expressing their belief that he did not get 
 the genuine Economical Manure. 

Mildew on Gooseberries. 

My father had some nice gooseberry bushes ; every 
 year they would blow and show a fair prospect of fruit, 
 until they would be about half grown, when they would 
 all mildew, and not one be fit to eat. This state of 
 things continued for several years, when we happened 
 to hear that to pour strong soap suds over the bushes, 
 once or twice a week, when the fruit was setting, would 
 prevent the mildew. Last summer we tried it, and the 
 bushes fairly bent with fruit, which would fairly make 
 one's mouth water, instead of their eyes as before. A 
 neighbor of ours . had gooseberries which mildewed in 
 the same way. Last spring, while cleaning out his stove 
 pipe, the idea was suggested of putting the soot upon 
 the gooseberry bushes. It was accordingly done, and 
 the result was he had gooseberries without mildew.

New Food for Sheep. 

Whilst I Was at Geneva, I observed every one collect- 
 ing careftilly the fruit of the horse-chestnut, and on in- 
 quiry I learned that the butchers and holders of grazinjr 
 stock bought it readily at a certain price per bushel. I 
 inquired of my butcher, and he told me it was given to 
 those sheep in particular that were fattening. The 
 horse-chestnuts were well crushed; something in the 
 way, so I understood, that apples are previous to cider 
 being made. They are crushed or cut up in a machine 
 kept solely in Switzerland for that purpose ; then about 
 two pounds' weight is given to each sheep morning and 
 evening. It must be portioned out to the sheep, as too 
 much would disagree with them, being of a very heating 
 nature. The butcher told me that it gave an excellent 
 rich flavor to the meat. The Geneva mutton is noted 
 for being as highly flavored as any in England or Wales.

To Promote the Health of Cattle. 

Feed all animals regularly. They not only look for 
 their food at the usual time, but the stomach indicates 
 the want at the stated period. Therefore feed morning, 
 noon and evening, as near the same time as possi- 
 ble. 

Guard against the wide and injurious extremes of sa- 
 tiating with excess and starving with want. Food 
 should be of a suitable quality, and proportioned to the 
 growth, and fattening of animals, to their production in 
 young, and milk, and to their labor or exercise. Ani- 
 mals that labor need far more food, and that which is 
 far more nutritious, than those that are idle. 

In dry time, see that the animals have a good supply 
 of pure water. When the fountains are low, they drink 
 the drainings of fountains, streams, and passages of 
 water, which are unwholesome. 

If barns and stables are very tight and warm, venti- 
 late in mild weather, even in winter. — New England 
 Farmer.
