ing the State Society, and to throw the strength of their or- 
 ganization for the benefit of the' State Fair, determined to 
 intermit their annual county exhibition, and appointed a 
 committee of arrangement of their number to assist in ma- 
 king the necessary preparations. 

The Pennsylvania Horticultural Society, at Philadelphia, 
 also suspended their annual exhibition, and appointed a 
 committee to superintend the horticultural department of the 
 State Pair. The committees appointed by these two Socie- 
 ties did efficient service in the discharge of the laborious 
 duties, which were incumbent upon them in their respective 
 capacities. 

Philadelphia and her citizens did much to promote the 
 interest of the Society during the continuance of the fair, 
 and great credit is due the people who attended the exhibi- 
 tion for their strict observance of temperance and good or- 
 der. The Mayor and Police of Philadelphia extended the 
 aegis of their municipal authority over all the ramifications 
 of the fair, and protected alike persons and property until 
 the Society had woundup its exhibition, and the last article 
 was removed from the ground. 

The closing of the fourth year of the Pennsylvania State 
 Agricultural Society affords the members thereof great 
 cause of congratulation, and promises for the future contin- 
 ued usefulness in the promotion of agriculture and encour- 
 agement of the domestic and mechanic arts. 

The Treasurer, George II. Bucher, Esq., made his report

The Committee on Field Crops for the year 1854 made 
 the following report, which was also unanimously adopted, 
 as was also a resolution thanking the author for the clear 

and comprehensive manner in which it was drawn : 
 To the Executive Committee of the Pennsylvania State Agri- 
 cultural Society : 

The Committee on Field Crops, organized by the appoint- 
 ment of John P. Rutherford, of Dauphin county, and John 
 II. Ewing, of Washington county, to fill the vacancies oc- 
 casioned by the absence of Thos. B. Bryson, of Cumberland 
 county, and Jonathan Payson, of Chester county, respect- 
 fully report: 

That owing to the very severe drought of tho last sum- 
 mer, which affected injuriously every product of tho fan:!, 
 there has been no competition for the premiums on any of 
 the field crops, except corn. George Drayton, farmer fco 
 Christopher Fallon, of Delaware county, and "William Drippy, 
 of Chester county, being the only applicants for the premi- 
 ums on corn, John Ruthrauff, of Franklin county, the only 
 applicant for the premiums on barley, and there being no 
 applicants for any of the numerous other productions for 
 which premiums were offered. 

From tho certificates and statement furnished by Mr. 
 Drayton, farmer to Mr. Fallon, which are herewith present- 
 ed and made part of this report, it appears that he produced 
 from five acres of ground in one contiguous piece, accurate- 
 ly measured by a surveyor with chain and compass, five 
 hundred and eight and one-fourth bushels of shelled corn, 
 being one hundred and one bushels and twenty-seven quarts 
 per acre, as ascertained by actual measurement of the whole 
 in a sealed half bushel between the 18th and 28th days of 
 December last — all of which is certified to by the surveyor 
 and two disinterested witnesses. ■ The Committee take pleas- 
 ure, therefore, in awarding George Drayton, farmer to Chris- 
 topher Fallon, the premium of fifty dollars for the best five 
 acres of corn, as taking into view the great drought they 
 consider that product highly commendable to the producer. 
 Mr. Drayton, farmer to Mr. Fallon, also furnished more than 
 half a bushel of shelled corn, besides a quantity in the ear, 
 as a sample of his crop, together with a full statoment of tho 
 mode of cultivation, thus complying literally with every re- 
 quisition of the Society. 

They also award to William Dripps, of Chester countj', 
 the premium of twenty dollars for the second best five acres 
 of corn — Mr. Dripps having produced on five acres and 
 twenty -one perches of land four hundred and nineteen and 
 one-fourth bushels of shelled corn, being eighty-one busheLs 
 and twenty-one quarts per acre, as appears by the accom- 
 panying statement and certificates, which are also herewith 
 presented and made part of this report. 

By tho statement and certificates furnished by Mr. Ruth- 
 rauff, which are also herewith presented and made part o? 
 this report, he appears to have produced on five and one- 
 fourth acres of ground two hundred and sixty-four and one- 
 fourth bushels of barley, being fifty and one-third bushels 
 per acre, and on two acres and sixty-four perches one hun- 
 dred and thirty-nine and one-half bushels, being fifty-eight 
 and ono eighth bushels per acre. The product of the larger 
 as well as the smaller lot, is highly creditable to Mr. Ruth- 
 rauff, and wo therefore award him a premium of twenty-fivo 
 dollars for the best five acres of barley. Mr. Ruthrauff pre- 
 sented a few quarts, but not the required quantity of the 
 barley as a sample, which prevented the Committee from 
 testing its weight. 

Your Committee have noticed with pleasure the enlarge- 
 ment of the premiums offered for field crops, as well as the 
 requisition from applicants of stricter evidence than in for- 
 mer exhibitions of the measurement both of the ground and 
 product. The award of premiums for an amount of produce 
 per acre, which the great majority of the farming communi- 
 ty believe (erroneously, if you please,) could not have bees
