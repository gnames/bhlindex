grown, keeps back competition, and tends to bring discredit 
 upon the Society. It is due, therefore, to the interests of 
 the Society, if not more to this incredulity itself, that the 
 evidence upon which premiums for extraordinary produc- 
 tions are awarded should be such as to satisfy, at least, the 
 honest, intelligent, practical agriculturist. Would it be too 
 much, therefore, to require the several certificates of the 
 surveyor, the applicant and his assistants, not only to be full 
 and explicit, but to be verified by affidavit ? We are not 
 aware of any objection to the substitution of affidavits for 
 the certificates, that would not apply with equal force to the 
 requisition of the affidavit in any case whatever, nor can we 
 believe that the honest applicant for a premium would make 
 any objection to the substitution of the one for the other. 
 Certain it is that if the solemnity of the affidavit induces 
 caution, prevents evasion and gives additional credulity to 
 the statements, it will answer a most beneficial purpose. 

To insure accuracy and relieve the applicant from unne- 
 cessary embarrassments, your Committee would most respect- 
 fully suggest the propriety of more spocific requisitions and 
 instructions in reference to the statement of the nature, 
 depth and quality of the soil, the crop which for years was 
 produced, the kind, quality and quantity of the manure used, 
 the mode of cultivation, the kind of seed and the manner of 
 sowing it, together with the publication of the forms of cer- 
 tificates or affidavits for the surveyor, applicant and assis- 
 tants. All of which is most respectfully submitted.

The election of officers for the next year being in order, the 
 chair stated that Judge Watts, the able an* accomplished 
 president of the Society from its organization in a letter ad- 
 dressed to the Secretary, R. C. Walker, Esq., preemptorily 
 declined a re-election, and desired him to make this deter- 
 mination known at the annual meeting. The following is 
 the letter. 

Carlisle, Jan. 15th, 1855. 

Robert C Walker, Esq. Secretary. — Dear Sir:— 
 I have always said to you that it was my purpose to decline 
 a re-election to the office of President of the State Agricul- 
 tural Society. I desire that you will make this determina- 
 tion formally known at the annual meeting. I must not be 
 understood to mean that I intend to abate, in any degree, 
 the interest I take in the useful purpose which our Society 
 is destined to mark out; on the contrary, I will always be 
 ready, in any subordinate position, to contribute all my abil- 
 ity to an enterprise, which I estimate, in point of public 
 economy, above all others. 

It has always been a subject of regret to me that our 
 annual meetings should necessarily be held at a period when 
 professional duty commands my attention elsewhere. It 
 would afford me great satisfaction to meet farmers from all 
 parts of the State, and aid them to devise plans and means 
 to promote their interest ; I should especially bo pleased to 
 have an opportunity to urge upon them the assertion of 
 their right to the establishment of a school, where their sons 
 may be taught the science, as well as the practical operations 
 of agriculture at a cost, commensurate with the profits of 
 their business. But this opportunity is denied me, and I 
 can only add the expression of a well matured opinion, that 
 without that appropriate education which is sought and 
 deemed essential to professional success, the progress and 
 profits of agriculture, must be slow — very slow. I have the 
 honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient,

Harrisrtjrg, Jan 16th, 1855. 

To the Executive Committee of the Penn. State Agricultu- 
 ral Society. — Gentlemen : — Believing the Agricultural inter- 
 ests of our state may be eminently promoted by the early 
 establishment of tho Farmers High School, where a thorough 
 practical and scientific education may be acquired by the 
 youth of our state, who desire to make the tillage of the soil 
 the business of their lives, I beg to make known to you, 
 and through you to tho gentlemen, who are, or may be ap- 
 pointed trustees of the Farmers' High School of Pennsylva- 
 nia, that I will give to tho Institution, two hundred acres of 
 land, situated in Girard township, Erie county, provided 
 said school be located on said land. Yours truly, 

JAMES MILES. 

David Mumma offered the following preamble and resolu- 
 tion, which were adopted : 

Whereas, it is generally believed that a large portion of 
 the several kinds of guano, now sold rn our market, are, 
 many of them, of a very inferior quality, and some of them 
 almost worthless, and tho frequent impositions practiced 
 upon our farmers, in consequence of the great difficulty in 
 discriminating between a good and an inferior article, has 
 much lessened, if not entirely destroyed, the confidence in 
 this highly valuable manure. Therefore; 

Resolved, That we recommend, and respectfully urge, 
 upon the present Legislature the propriety of passing a law 
 providing for the appointment of an Inspector of Guano for 
 this State. 

On motion of A. M. Spangler, it was 

Resolved, That there be appointed by the chair, a com- 
 mittee consisting of five members to attend the annu;\ 
 meeting of the United States Agricultural Society for 
 1855. 

On motion of Isaac G. McKinley, it was 

Resolved, That tho Pennsylvania State Agricultural So- 
 ciety takes a deep interest in tho establishment of an insti- 
 tution for the instruction of the sons of the farmers of Penn- 
 sylvania in the most approved practical and scientific mode
