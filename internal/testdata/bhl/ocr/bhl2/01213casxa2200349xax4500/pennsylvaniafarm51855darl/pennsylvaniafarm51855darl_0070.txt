Finger and Toe in Root Crops. 

BY JAMES BUCKMAN, F.G.S., F.L.S. 

The so-called disease of finger and toe in root crops is 
 a subject which has for a long time occupied the atten- 
 tion of those connected with agriculture, but apparently 
 without at all settling the questions as to its nature and 
 origin, as we find that up to the present time one section 
 of practical men hold the opinion that the malformation 
 of the root, which has given rise to the designation, is 
 caused by uneven manuring ; another, that it is due to 
 the presence of stones, or a want of due pulverisation of 
 the soil ; whilst a third attributes the whole matter to 
 attacks of insects. 

Now, this discrepancy of opinion results from a va- 
 riety of causes, the most prominent of which is a want 
 of agreement as to the nature of the matter under in- 
 vestigation, inasmuch as we find that it is not restricted 

• to a designation of that peculiar branching or growing 
 of the roots in a digitate form, from which the term fin- 
 ger and toe is derived ; but the excrescences caused by 
 the bulging out of the root around the larvse of insects, 
 cracking and splitting of the root, and bletting or rot- 
 ting of its parts, are all somehow or another included in 
 the category of finger and toe ; and though it is possible 
 that most of these may be found to operate under some 
 of the circumstances by which the peculiarity of growth 
 it is my present object to describe is produced, yet the 
 following remarks are meant to apply only to an ex- 
 planation of the facts connected with the branching or 
 forked method of growth of some roots, as Parsnips* 

Carots, and Turnips (see accompanying drawings 1 and 

2), as distinguished from the smooth outline and un- 
 branched condition which mark well developed root 
 crops. 

As my conclusions upon this subject have been ar- 
 rived at in experimenting upon the growth of cultivated 

roots from wild kinds, I shall, in illustrating the subject, 
 describe — 1st, Some experiments on the growth of wild 
 roots, and the conclusions I have been led to in conse- 
 quence of my observations upon these. 2d, I shall at- 
 tempt to show that the history of root crops confirms 
 the view of "finger and toe," to which such experiments 
 have led. 

1st. Experiments with Wild Roots, &c. — In the 
 spring of 1848 I planted two of my experimental plots 
 with seeds of the Pastinaca sativa (Parsnip), and Daucus 
 carrota (Carrot), both of which grew spontaneously in 
 the garden precints ; the seeds were gathered in the 
 previous summer from wild plants. On being sown, 
 both species came up well ; but as they advanced, many 
 of the specimens showed a disposition to run to seed the 

first year ; and as seed from these would have been of 
 no use in my after experiments, which were designed to 
 enable me to note the effect of cultivation upon wild 
 specimens, the plants in which the running disposition 
 showed itself were hoed out. An examination of tl>e 
 crop in the autumn showed, in the Parsnip more partic- 
 ularly, some interesting results, the most prominent of 
 which were, that whilst most of the specimens presented 
 the dark green hairy leaves peculiar to the wild plant, 
 there were a few examples in which the foliage had as- 
 sumed the light green and smooth aspect, devoid of hairs, 
 which characterises the cultivated plant ; and amongsi 
 the latter there were a few with larger leaves and broad- 
 er divisions or leaf-lobes than the rest, the leaves, too, 
 all growing symmetrically around one central bud, whilst 
 others showed a disposition to throw up more buds than 
 one. Here, then, it was evident that the examples with 
 the single central bud were best calculated to carry on 
 the experiments, and consequently the remainder we»e 
 rooted out, when it was observed that the roots were for 
 the most part more fleshy than those of quite wild ex- 
 amples; and while they were as much forked as wild 
 roots (see drawing 8), the increased fleshiness extended 
 to the forks equally with the larger part.
