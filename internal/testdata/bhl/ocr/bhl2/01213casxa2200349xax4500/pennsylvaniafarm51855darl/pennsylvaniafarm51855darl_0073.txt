'large compact beast — somewhat coarser than its neigh- 
 bor, but remarkably thickly covered with useful flesh. 

There was a fine show of South Down sheep, a com- 
 paratively inferior one of long wools, and a very good 
 display of the crosses between them. Samuel Deuce, of 
 llynshani, Oxfordshire, "who deserves great, credit for 
 bis energy and success in enforcing the profitableness of 
 the cross bred Down and long wooled sheep," carried off 
 the prize in the class of cross breeds. The Mark Lane 
 j'lxpress says: "In the down classes we think great 
 progress is yet making; our taste accords with the pro- 
 duction of a great weight of food of good quality, in a 
 j iven time, either in growth or feeding. We think the 
 Hampshire Downs shown gave decided advantages on 
 ( his point, being very large and heavy. The pure Downs 
 also gave evidence of improvement. We never saw the 
 Duke of Richmond's Downs show so well; they retain 
 their symmetry under a broader frame of greater sub- 
 stance. 

The show of pigs appears to have been rather mea- 
 gre. The celebrated Coleshill breed, though fairly rep- 
 resented, were not equal to former years, and the fine 
 porkers bred by Fisher Hobbs, and others of the same 
 school, were missing. 

Large Beet. 

Mr. Darlington: — We have just weighed and measur- 
 ed a fine beet, of the blood root variety, which grew in 
 our garden during the past excessively dry season. 
 Length twenty inches, circumference twenty one inches, 
 weight ten pounds and two ounces. 

Thei'e is deep soil in Crawford county, and plenty of it. 
 Thousands of acres to be had yet at $5 per acre -and some 
 for less. F. SCHREINER.

Domestic Recipes. 

To Clean Rings, Brooches, and other Jewelry. — 
 Put a little hartshorn into a saucer ; dip into a clean, 
 soft rag, from an old cambric handkerchief. With the 
 ike rag, go carefully over the jewelry, on both sides. 
 Then dry and polish, with another bit of soft rag ; and, 
 iinally, with a soft piece of old silk. Precious stones, 
 mosaics and cameos may be cleaned in this manner. 
 To brighten pearls, tear off a small bit of pin-paper, 
 (such as rows of pins are stuck in,) roll it up, and, with 
 the end of the roll, rub each pearl, separately ; renew- 
 ing the paper frequently. 

To Remove Acids, and other Stains fbom Silks, : 
 Gloves, and Woollens. — The application of hartshorn, 
 rubbed on with the finger, will generally remove the 
 stain-spots that are sometimes found on new silk, and 
 m new kid gloves. There are few stains, indeed, that 
 may not be obliterated by hartshorn. If too strong, 
 dilute it with a little water. Pour out.,' into your sau- 
 cer, but very little hartshorn* at a time, as it evapo- 
 rates almost immediately. 

Reddish stains, on black silk, or worsted, can, almost 
 always, be removed by hartshorn ; and the original 
 black color will immediately re-appear. 

To Keep Brittania-Metal Bright. — Dip a clean 
 woollen cloth into the best and cleanest lamp oil, and 
 rub it, hard, all over the outside of your Brittannia- 

ware. Then wash it well in strong soap-suds, and af- 
 terwards polish with finely powdered whiting and a 
 buckskin. 

Indian Hasty Pudding. — Put two quarts of milk in- 
 to a clean pot or sauce-pan. Set it over the fire, adding 
 a level tea-spoonful of salt, and, when it comes to a 
 boil, stir in a lump of fresh butter about the size of a 
 goose-egg. Then add (a handful at a time) sufilcient 
 Indian meal to make it very thick, stirring it all the 
 while with a mush-stick. Keep it boiling well, and con- 
 tinue to throw in Indian meal till it is so thick that the 
 stick stands upright in it. Then send it to table hot, 
 and eat it with milk, cream, or molasses and butter. 

Indian Muffins. — A pint and a half of yellow Indi- 
 an meal, sifted. — A handful of wheat flour.— A quarter 
 of a pound of fresh butter. — A quart of milk. — Four 
 eggs. — A very small tea-spoonful of salt. Put the 
 milk into a sauce-pan. Cut the butter into it. Set it 
 over the fire and warm it until the butter is very soft, 
 but not until it melts. Then take it off, stir it well, till 
 all mixed, and set it away to cool. Beat four eggs very 
 light ; and when the milk is cold, stir them into it, al- 
 ternately with the meal, a little at a time of each. Add 
 the salt. Beat the whole very hard after it is all mixed. 
 Then butter some mivffln-rings on the inside. Set them 
 in a hot oven, or on a heated griddle ; pour some of the 
 batter into each ; and bake the mffiuns well. Send 
 them hot to table, continuing to bake while a fresh sup- 
 ply is wanted. Pull them open with your fingers, and 
 eat them wiih butter, to which you may add molasses 
 or honey. 

A Good Milking Alderney. 

To the Editor of the Farm Journal:— I send you for 
 publication a copy of a letter lately received from Wm. 
 C. Wilson, Esq., of Baltimore, to whom I sold an. im- 
 ported Alderney cow. She was purchased by me of 
 Roswell L. Colt, of Patterson, New Jersey, in March 
 1851, for Mr. Wilson. 

I noticed her at the Maryland State Fair in October 
 last, when Mr. W. informed me that she had given in 
 the summer of 1853, as high as 36 qts. of clear milk in 
 one day. His farmer, who was present, willingly offer- 
 ed to testify to the fact. She then had a bull calf about 
 four months old, which I was induced to purchase on 
 account of the milking properties of the dam. 

The Alderneys in genera^ have not had the character 
 of being great -milkers ; but in richness and quality 
 their milk exceeds all others. It will be seen by the 
 following letter that some of them are very great milk- 
 ers also. Respectfully yours,

 Dear Sir :— I enclose Mr. Brooks' deposition in re- 
 gard to the Alderney cow, "Lady," made before Justice 
 Morrison, one of our most respectable magistrates. 
 On my telling Brooks that you wanted this statement, 
 he expressed the greatest readiness to confirm it, and is 
 well aware of the sacred responsibility of an oath. At 
 one time I thought there might be some mistake in the 
 matter, but on procuring a new stamped measure, I 
 found the old measure precisely the same size, and the
