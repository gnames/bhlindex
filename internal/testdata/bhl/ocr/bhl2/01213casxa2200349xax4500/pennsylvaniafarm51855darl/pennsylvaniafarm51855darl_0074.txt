dairy maid and two men on the farm, confirmed the 
 statement. Brooks' wife expressed her willingness to 
 swear also to the fact. You will observe that the yield 
 is one quart less than you supposed. Mrs. B., who has 
 been milking cows for 25 years, says that "Lady" is the 
 best cow she ever milked; that her milk is as rich when 
 she is fresh as at any other time, and she never goes 
 dry. Her first heifer, now three years old, had her first 
 calf in March last, and three or four months after, on 
 good pasture gave 16 qrs. per day. "Lady's" second 
 calf, a heifer, now two years and four months old, a 
 beautiful animal, and has taken three first premiums, 
 our friend Martin Goldsborough offered me a few weeks 
 since $200 for, but I declined. She has since dropped 
 a fine heifer calf, that could not be bought for $100. 
 "Lady's" third, 15 months old, is also very promising. 

As you no doubt take an interest in the cattle I pro- 
 cured through you, I may ask you if you recollect a 
 yearling heifer I purchased of you at our Fair in 1851. 
 Mr. Calvert obtained one from you also. Like "Lady," 
 this heifer (Fannie,) was from Mr. Colt's, and descend- 
 ed on or both sides from Biddell Stock. She gave last 
 summer, 27 or 28 qrs. per day, being then about three 
 years and nine months old, and with her third calf; 
 goes dry about four days. The yield, &c, of these two, 
 would seem to confirm a remark Mr. Colt made in my 
 hearing that "the Biddell stock proved better with him, 
 than his own more recent importation. ' 

The deposition, you will observe, refers to season of 
 1853. She gave about the same quantity, judging from 
 the pail, this season. I had made arrangements to have 
 all accurately measured, and quality tested, at various 
 periods of their milking, but was compelled by an at- 
 tack of rheumatism, to be absent at the Virginia 
 Springs, nearly all the summer. Another season I will 
 oarry this out, and send you the result.

State of Maryland, City of Baltimore, S S : 
 On this, 19th day of December, 1854, before me the sub- 
 scriber, a Justice of the Peace of the State of Mary- 
 land, and for the city aforesaid, personally appeared 
 William Brooks, and made oath, that in the summer of 
 1853, the Alderney cow "Lady," belonging to Wm. C. 
 Wilson, then in his charge and management, did at the 
 period mentioned, give in one day, thirty-six quarts of 
 milk, and that her daily yield was about the same be- 
 fore and after that period. (Signed)

Indiana County Agricultural Society. 

The farmers of Indiana county, as we learn from the 
 Register, met at the court house for the purpose of 
 forming an Agricultural Society. They adopted a con- 
 stitution well calculated to promote the object in view. 
 A committee was also appointed to publish an address 
 to the citizens of the county. 

The following are the officers elected for the ensuing 
 year : 

President— Hon. Thos. White. 

Vice Presidents — Wm. H. Coleman, Jacob Gamble. 
 Samuel S. Marshall, Hugh M. Speedy, Moses T. Work, 
 Wm. Evans, Adam Johnston. 

Corresponding Secretary — Jonathan Row. 

Recording Secretary — George Shryock. 

Librarian — John H. Lichteberger. 

Managers — James Hood, John G. Coleman, Robert 
 H. Armstrong, David Ralston, James Baily, J. T. Van- 
 horn, S. Johnston. 

JgggfUpon referring to our mail books, we find th;it 
 several of the above have omitted subscribing to tin- 
 Farm Journal. Certainly no good farmer, much lees 
 an officer of an Agricultural Society, should hesitate 
 about subscribing to the only Agricultural Journal pub- 
 lished in the State. 

Burning the Ends of Fence Posts. 

A correspondent of the Ohio Farmer, gives the follow- 
 ing common sense reasen for not adopting this practice 

'Tis known to be a fact that charcoal will not rot, 
 hence the idea has obtained, that to char the posts will 
 preserve them; but if the timber is scorched it will cer- 
 tainly crack into many small seams — and probably some 
 of them from one to two inches deep — which of course 
 will admit the damp and water about as freely as if the 
 coal was not there; consequently the posts are injured 
 and the durability decreased. Many years ago, I too was 
 under the: impression that to burn posts would make 
 them last longer. I have been a cultivator of the soil 
 for upwards of 55 years, and am now upwards of 77 
 years old, consequently have some experience in these 
 matters. 

The Oregon Pea. 
 J. L. Darlington Esq. — One of your correspondents, 
 who signs himself "Horticola," inquires in the January 
 number, of your Journal where he may be able to obtain 
 certain seeds, which he names, and among which is the 
 Oregon Pea. Permit me to inform him, through you. 
 if you are acquainted with the writer, that I can furnish 

him with a small quantity of these peas(say one quart 
 — possibly a gallon) in the latter part of the ensuing 
 month. I own a small farm in Tennessee, where these 
 peas have been grown two seasons, and from which I can 
 get them through a friend who will visit this city in Feb- 
 ruary. I obtained in the winter of '52 about a half rv 
 pint of seed, from which I presume more than a bushel 
 was gathered in the fall of '53. The long continued and 
 severe drought last summer cut the pea, as wellas the 
 grain crops, short in Tennessee — and as the Oregon 
 Pea, was not planted till May or June, it suffered great- 
 ly from the drouth. 

Your correspondent also desires to know where he 
 may obtain the "Chick Pea." Allow me to say that I 
 was on the Island of Malta in 1852, where I saw the pea 
 growing which he describes, and which is extensively 
 grown and eaten there by man and beast. The natives 
 (the poorer class) seem to make a very satisfactory meal 

off a three ct. loaf of wheaten bread and a few pennys 
 worth of Chiche (as they call the vegetable) which they 
 pick from the pods and eat raw. As there is pretty free 
 communication between this city and Vallette in Malta, 

I think your correspondent will have but little difficulty
