 Shading Poor Land. 

BY J. S. HOUGHTON, M. 

I am not one of those who believe that mere shade is. 
 in itself, equivalent to manure, or that shade really cre- 
 ates any materials of value in the soil so shaded. But I 
 believe that it is highly important to keep all land, and 
 especially that which is light and porous, and compara- 
 tively poor, well shaded during the hot season, in order 
 to prevent the too free evaporation of the gaseous ele- 
 ments of plants from the soil. 

Under good management, and especially where land is 
 well manured, no fields should be permitted to lie idle, 
 broken into ridges, and uncovered by the foliage of 
 growing plants, making some kind of crop. The loss 
 caused by neglect of this rule, both by want of shade, 
 and by the exhausting influence of weeds, is greater 
 than the profit to be derived from any single crop that 
 can be grown. 

I am induced to write this article for the purpose of 
 bringing to the attention of farmers two occasions on 
 which the best farmers in Virginia resort to shading 
 the land as a means of protecting the soil from exhaus- 
 tion, and two means by which they do it, which appear 
 to me to be worthy of extended imitation everywhere. 
 We are in the habit of supposing that the farmers of 
 Virginia are behind the age, in improvements and meth- 
 ods of cultivation ; and so they are, many of them, just 
 as many of our farmers are in Pennsylvania ; but in the 
 art of renovating exhausted soils, I am of the opinion 
 that there is as much skill exhibited by a few planters 
 in Virginia, as there is in any part of the United 
 States. 

The two plans for shading light soils in summer, above 
 alluded to, are as follows : 

The first is top dressing clover immediately after mowing, 
 the same day or the next morning, with a view to shade 
 the plants and the soil. To effect this object long ma- 
 nure is employed, leaf mould, dried peat, muck, loam, 
 or any other carbonaceous matter ; or if these materials 
 be not abundant on the farm, then a light drilling of 
 plaster of Paris and salt is employed, say one or two 
 bushels of plaster, and a bushel or less of salt, to each 
 acre. The heavier the dressing is on light soils, of 
 course the better ; but even the slight coat of plaster 
 and salt is said to be highly beneficial, shading the na- 
 ked plants, to some extent, and keeping the land moist, 
 and preventing the too rapid evaporation of valuable

One of the best farmers in Virginia, from 
 whom I obtained this hint, is celebrated for his success 
 in improving poor soils, and he attributes much of his 
 success to top dressing clover with plaster, or plaster 
 and salt, coarse manure, &c, as above described, imme- 
 diately after mowing in hot weather. I think the sug- 
 gestion a very valuable one, and strongly advise the trial 
 of it by farmers generally, when the soil is not well cov- 
 ered with clover. 

Another method of shading the soil much practiced in 
 Virginia is the sowing of the field pea immediately after 
 wheat, or any other crop, is removed, when the land is 
 not to be used directly for any other seed or vegetable 
 crop. A fair growth of vines may no doubt be obtained 
 even as far north as Pennsylvania, before cold weather, 
 to be turned under as a fertilizer; and as the pea grows 
 very quickly, it will soon shade the ground, especially if 
 sown broadcast. The merits of the field pea for this 
 purpose, and as food for stock, I have discussed at length 
 in other articles in the Farm Journal. If it is found 
 that the pea will not make sufficient growth to pay for 
 the expense of sowing it, after wheat or oats, (which I do 
 not anticipate, ) then the farmer may try corn fodder, (corn 
 sowed thickly in drills or broadcast,) or corn and buck- 
 wheat, or buckwheat alone, to be used as a green manu- 
 ring crop. The seed of either of these plants would 
 cost but little, and the benefits to be derived from the 
 shade afforded by the peas, corn and buckwheat, with 
 the additions which they would make to the soil, and the 
 absence of weeds would afford a good profit on the ex- 
 pense and labor. 

In some of the Northern States, it is the custom 
 among the best farmers to top dress timothy fields with 
 manure immediately after mowing, and the result is that 
 a second growth of grass is obtained, half the weight of 
 the first, on land which, without such treatment, would 
 scarcely afford decent grazing. 

As all farmers may not have manure to spare for grass 
 lands, to be used in this way, I do not expect the prac- 
 tice of summer manuring to be very generally adopted ; 
 but surely all farmers might find some kind of top dres- 
 sing, such as muck or leaf mould, to be used chiefly for 
 shading clover lands ; or if not this, they could dress 
 them with plaster and salt. For fields which have been 
 stripped of their crops (as on truck farms,) early in the 
 season, and cannot be worked with any crop requiring 
 much cultivation, there is no plant equal to the field pea 
 for shading and enriching the soil.
