result. The crop not equalling the gain guaranteed, the 
 purchaser declined payment. The vendor brought suit, 
 but failed to recover ; the court holding that he had not 
 complied with his terms of the contract. 

Mr. Roberts had sown guano on his lawn. The first 
 year the grass was beautiful, the second inferior, the 
 third worse than before the manuring. He should buy 
 something else. . 

H. Ingersoll, Esq., stated that his experience agreed 
 perfectly with that of Mr. Roberts. He deemed guano 
 too stimulating, acting, so to speak, as a blister, and 
 when the stimulus was over, say in three years, leaving 
 the soil poorer than before. 

Mr. Isaac Newton had a large estate in Virginia. 
 Four years ago he had sown six hundred acres of worn 
 out lands near the Potomac with guano. The yield of 
 wheat was wonderful, and the clover which had been 
 plentifully sown at the rate of ten quarts of seed to the 
 acre, was most luxuriant. The year following he had it. 
 spread with plaster, turned the clover under and guano- 
 ed again. The crops since had been very fine. Last 
 year was not favorable to guano on account of the 
 drought. That manure needed moisture. In Virginia 
 the practice had been under slavery to sow no grass seed 
 with their wheat. Give him guano, free labor, grass 
 seed, and a little plaster, and he would undertake to re- 
 new, in a short time, all the worn out lands in the Old 
 Dominion. Adjourned. 

Renovating Old Meadows. 

Mr. J. L. Darlington : â€” Would you oblige a subscri- 
 ber by inserting in your next number a piece, informing 
 me how to regulate an old meadow, and also to answer 
 these questions: 

1st. Whether old meadows should be invariably plow- 
 ed? 

2d. Will not lime, top dressings of compost and ma- 
 mire, together with drainings, revive old meadows ? 

3d. What is the best way of renewing grass seed in 
 old meadows, and the best kind to sow ? 

4th. What kind of drains are the best, and the man- 
 ner of constructing them ? 

5th. Cannot the farming of old meadows be obviated 
 by proper management ? 

. Allow me to suggest to you the benefit arising from 
 the publishing (in your numbers) of Leibig's Agricultu- 
 ral Chemistry, the reading of which 'would diffuse a 
 spirit of investigation and close observation among the 
 intelligent portion of your readers. 

The answering of the above in your next would much 
 oblige An Earnest Inquirer. 

In reply to our correspondent, we answer that the first 
 and most indispensable preliminary to getting an old 
 meadow into a good productive condition is thorough 
 draining. Without this being first clone, lime, compost 
 and manure are very nearly thrown away. 

After being well drained, and its unhealthy condition 
 thus meliorated, a heavy top dressing of lime may be 
 applied, and seed of timothy and herd grass sown in the 
 fall. These will, in time, take root, and crowd out the 
 rank and coarse herbage, provided there are insuperable 
 difficulties to plowing it, which without any doubt would 
 be the speediest way to get it into good condition, and is 

decidedly to be recommended. If our friend's moadow 
 is of great extent, part might be plowed each season. 

We once had a piece of over two acres of land on our 
 farm wet, marshy, and overgrown with tussocks. A 
 small part higher than the rest contained some good 
 grass, which, when mowed, had to be carried off by 
 hand, a horse and cart sinking down so deep on any 
 other part as to be unable to get out without the great- 
 est difficulty. By the following process we brought this 
 meadow to be the most productive and valuable two 
 acres on the farm. We first cut a wide open ditch on 
 the lowest side, into which we run what are called 
 French or covered drains, intersecting the meadow in 
 various directions, so as to catch the heads of all the 
 springs, which were made to run into the one open out- 
 let. The surface soon showed indications of becoming 
 dry, and the rushes and coarse grass, which only can 
 thrive in a wet, spongy soil, soon began to dwindle. The 
 following spring we had a large, stout, steel hoe in the 
 shape of a V made by a country blacksmith, with which 
 we cut off all the tussocks, piled them in heaps, and 
 burnt them as soon as they became dry. When these 
 were off, the surface of the meadow looked tolerably 
 level and respectable. The next thing was to obtain the 
 large iron township plow and four stout yoke of oxen, 
 and the way they turned up the black vegetable mould, 
 about ten inches deep, was a caution to all shallow plow- 
 men. Occasionally the point of the plow would stick 
 into a half decayed tussock root, and hoist the plowman 
 several feet off the ground, when the team had to be 
 backed and begin again, to the great amusement of the 
 passers by. When the plowing was finished, one hun- 
 dred bushels of lime were applied to the acre, and a 
 crop of buckwheat sown. The next spring (the third) 
 oats was sown, and a heavier crop of oats and straw ob- 
 tained than had ever been know* in that part of the 
 country. After this it was put down with rye and grass 
 seeds, and is now perfectly smooth, and as dry and well 
 set with grass, and more productive, than any part of 
 the farm, paying about fifty per cent for all ex- 
 penses. 

The covered drains alluded to above are very simple 
 and economical, skill of course being required where to 
 dig them, so as to head the springs. A thin wall of 
 rough stone, to be gathered off of most farms, is made 
 on each side, and covered over with one long enough to 
 rest on the side walls, the openings being filled up with 
 smaller stones, so as to prevent dirt from falling through. 
 Inverted sods are then placed on top, and the whole 
 covered up with dirt, offering no obstacle to cultivation, 
 and no unsightly and expensive open ditches. We used 
 merely the rough stones from the fields, wherever they 
 could be gathered, and considered it quite an economy 
 to get rid of them. 

In case of the bottom of the drain being soft and in- 
 clining to quick sand, old boards should be laid in the 
 bottom along that portion for the water to run over. 
 These being always under water will last a long time. 
 If something of this kind is not used in such places, the 
 side walls would be apt to tumble down. 

We have thus answered all the queries of our coiree- 
 pondent, and hope from time to time to attend to the 
 latter part of his request
