Work for the Month. 
 Farm. — Clover seed should now be sown before the 
 ground becomes hard. Five or six quarts is about the 
 proper quantity for an acre. Timothy, green grass, &c., 
 if not sown in the fall, should no longer be delayed. It 
 Li scarcely necessary we should add, use none but clean 
 seed. In many parts of this country farmers will do 
 well to manure their corn ground with barnyard manure 
 in the spring, and use guano and superphosphate of lime 
 in the fall for their wheat, thus making more corn and 
 more wheat. Corn ground should be plowed in this 
 month, and where the soil is not very light deeply sub- 
 soiled. The oats ground should also be prepared and 
 sown as soon as the weather will permit, sowing from 
 two to three bushels per acre. After harrowing the 
 ground should be rolled, as should mowing and pasture 
 land. When mowing fields are stony, the stones should 
 be carefully picked before rolling, and while the ground 
 is comparatively bare of grass. Plaster should be sown 
 early this month, so as to have the full benefit of the 
 spring rains. When guano is used as a top dressing, it 
 should be in connection with plaster, or some other sub- 
 stance that will fix the ammonia. Top dress winter 
 grain which was not manured last fall. Plant potatoes 
 for early crop, as soon as the ground will admit. Give 
 particular attention to cows which have calved, and ewes 
 lambed. Succulent food, such as turnips, carrots, beets, 
 &c M increases the flow of milk, and should always be 
 given in addition to grain and hay. Feed the mothers 
 well, is the true plan to make good calves and lambs. 
 Have a piece of early pasture ground to turn them on. 
 Give extra feeding to working cattle. At leisure times, 
 olean out thoroughly and whitewash poultry houses in- 
 Btde. Open the mouths of drains. 

Fruit Orchard. — Attend to directions of last month, 
 and perform what was omitted. Planting trees in this 
 section can be done during this month. Select the best 
 •varieties of fruit trees, and plant apple trees from 35 to 
 40 feet apart; peach, pear, plum and cherry trees 20 
 feet apart ; dwarf pears from 10 to 12 feet apart, 
 drafting may be done this month. Prepare grafting 
 wax by mixing three parts of bees- wax, three parts of 
 rosin, and two of tallow. Plant out gooseberry and cur- 
 rant cuttings, first removing all the lower eyes. Trench 
 and prepare the ground thoroughly with short manure. 
 Grape vine cuttings should be planted with two eyes out 
 of the ground, and in a soil rather sandy and moist. 
 Trim grape vines at once, if not already done, and dig 
 it* around the roots well rotted manure. Strip off of all 
 trees cocoons and larvae of insects, and apply wash be- 
 fore recommended. Apply salt to quince trees. Manure 
 aud clear up strawberry and raspberry beds, and make 
 new plantations of each. Uncover such of the latter as 
 were laid down last fall for protection. 

Vegetable Garden. — The operations of the garden 
 f> ir this month must depend on the weather, and the con- 
 dition of the ground. Seeds not easily injured by frosts 
 should be sown, such as peas, beets, parsnips, lettuce, 
 radish seed, onion seed and sets, early carrots, aspara- 
 gus seeds for new beds ; and plant out two year old roots, 
 cabbage seed, &c. If the weather is suitable, cabbage, 
 lettuce and cauliflowers may be planted out from frames. 
 Uncover spinach, parsley, lettuce, &c. Trench ground 

for horse-radish, and set out pieces of old roots in rich 
 soil. Dress up rhubarb, and manure thoroughly if not 
 already done. Give close attention to frames, &c, and 
 cover on cold nights. Give air on fine days. Tomato, 
 pepper and egg plants, which have grown thickly, should 
 be pricked out into other frames. Start Lima beans in 
 sods inverted, within doors, so as to be ready for plant- 
 ing out for early crops, as soon as the weather is settled. 
 Set out beds of sage, sweet marjoram, winter savory, 
 pennyroyal, and other perennial herbs, by dividing the 
 roots of old plants. Plant sweet potatoes in hot beds 
 for sprouting, and cucumbers in frames for forcing. As 
 a general rule in gardening, make deep soil, manure 
 heavily, and use plenty of seed. Better to thin ont than 
 have to re-sow. 

Flower Garden. — This is a busy month in the Flow- 
 er Garden. Remove the covering from the roses, and all 
 half hardy things. Loosen the fastenings of junipers, 
 Irish yews, &c, by which they had been secured against 
 winter storms. Prune roses and flowering shrubs. To 
 prune roses, observe in the running varieties to cut as 
 much old wood as possible, leaving only shoots of the 
 previous summer's growth; shorten them one-third, and 
 secure them firmly to the trellis or stake. Daily roses 
 treat as above, only shorten their shoots two-thirds. 
 The hybrid perpetuals and hardy garden roses should be 
 pruned back to three or four eyes of the old wood, 
 Roses will give more satisfaction by being closely pruned 
 than otherwise. In pruning shrubs, cut out any dead 
 wood ; thin out the branches where they crowd each oth- 
 er ; shorten any straggling branches ; by this means 
 they will assume a good shape. Secure honeysuckles, 
 clematises and other running vines firmly to their trelli- 
 ses. Manure liberally roses and flowering shrubs. This 
 is a good time to plant all kinds of shrubbery and ever- 
 greens, and all kinds of hardy biennials and perennials. 
 All such as have grown too large should be taken up, 
 separated and re-planted immediately. Remove the 
 covering of leaves or litter from the tulip beds, or other 
 articles which had been protected by them during the 
 winter. Tulips, hyacinths, and all other hardy bulbs, 
 may be planted early this month. Trim and re-plant 
 box-edging. Manure and dig flower beds. Sweep clean 
 and roll well lawns and grass plats. Laying sod should 
 be attended to this month. Clean and roll gravel walks 
 and add more gravel where required. Now is the 
 time to raise annuals from seed for early planting. 
 Plants in windows, which have done blooming, should 
 be removed to a cooler place, and their shoots shortened 
 considerably. Plants in cellars should have air admit- 
 ted to them freely in mild weather, and be watered more 
 liberally than during winter. 

Answers to Questions. 

In our last number, page 39, a correspondent en- 
 quires "why wheat grows and yields better on a clover 
 sod plowed three months before sowing than on that 
 plowed only a few days before." 

Without knowing any of the particular circumstances 
 of the case, such as the amount of green crops plowed 
 down, &c, we should attribute such a result to the fact 
 of the fermentation and decomposition having been in 
 great part completed, and the surrounding soil having
