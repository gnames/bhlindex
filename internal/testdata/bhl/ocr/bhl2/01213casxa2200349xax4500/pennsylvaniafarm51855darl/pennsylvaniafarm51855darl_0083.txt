become enriched by the fertilizing gases which had pen- 
 etrated every portion of it, thus making it fit for the re- 
 ception, growth and nutriment of the seed. It should 
 be recollected that in the excessive fermentation and de- 
 composition of a heavy green crop immediately plowed 
 down, a very considerable expansion of the soil is pro- 
 duced, as well as fertilizing gases liberated. This may 
 possibly render the soil too open at the critical period of 
 the germination of the wheat, and the immediate stimu- 
 \\s from the enriching gases thus liberated produce a 
 too rapid and unnatural growth of vegetation. The 
 effect might be similar to that from a heavy dressing of 
 unfermented manure, which we think should never im- 
 mediately precede the sowing of a wheat crop. An over 
 rapid growth of any crop is not always a healthy one ; 
 a regular, continued, natural progress to maturity of a 
 crop unchecked and not stunted by sudden changes is 
 more likely to result in a heavier yield than with an 
 unnatural stimulus created at one of its stages, and 
 which cannot be sustained throughout. 

Another cause of the difference alluded to no doubt is 
 that with clover immediately plowed down before seed- 
 ing, the wheat cannot either be drilled or harrowed in 
 with evenness and regularity. 

As to the second query of our correspondent, "why 
 committees award premiums on implements that are 
 good for nothing, and that they know nothing about." 
 The reason is that at our exhibitions the duties of com- 
 mittees are too laborious, and they have not time to 
 make the necessary examination. . The committees are 
 too few, and the implements to be examined are too 
 many. Instead of having the very large number and 
 great variety of implements, as at present, under the 
 supervision of two, three, or even four committees, they 
 should be more subdivided. There should be a separate 
 committee on plows, one on corn shellers, another on 
 cultivators, one on straw cutters, another on lime 
 spreaders, a separate one on reapers and mowers, an- 
 other on churns, &c. In this way the examination 
 would be thorough, the decisions more satisfactory, and 
 justice better rendered to contributors. As generally 
 managed it is physically impossible for committees to do 
 what is required and expected of them. 

Third query. "Will sheep sustain any injury from 
 hen lice?" Of course they will, and no decent farmer 
 who had any regard for his sheep would subject them to 
 so foul an influence. Hen lice will hurt sheep just as 
 much as people, and we should as little think of placing 
 our sheep among the hens as to quarter ourselves among 
 them, or permit our farm hands to do so. Cleanliness 
 contributes to the health of animals as well as people. 

Lime and Fancy Farmers. 

We extract the following remarks from the reported 
 proceedings of the Massachusetts Legislative Agricultu- 
 ral Club, not for the information it contains, but to show 
 the nonsense that is palmed off for sense, by intelligent 
 men undertaking to enlighten the world on a subject of 
 which they appear to be profoundly and ludicrously ig- 
 norant : 

"Mr. Bull remarked that Mr. Brown, of Concord, who 
 had raised fine crops of wheat, had made use of lime to 
 the extent of 15 bushels to the acre, sown broadcast, 

and perhaps to this manure his good crops were attribu- 
 table." 

"Mr. Bradbury, of Newton, said that in the wheat- 
 growing counties of Pennsylvania and Maryland, great 
 quantities of lime were used, and it was considered in- 
 dispensable. They formerly raised large crops of wheat 
 without any manure ; but their lands gave out, and ge- 
 ologists advised the farmers to apply lime. They did so, 
 and the result was that they obtained as good crops as 
 ever. Lime was generally abundant, but its good effect 
 was so obvious, that the farmers in the non-limestone 
 counties transported limestone from the others to ma- 
 nure their lands. In some parts of these States the 
 roads are macadamized with limestone, which, becoming 
 finely pulverized, is blown by the wind upon the adjoin- 
 ing fields, and has a sensible fertilizing effect upon them. 
 It is the practice among farmers in Cumberland, Dauphin 
 and Franklin counties in Pennsylvania, and in Mary- 
 land, to apply 80 bushels of unslacked lime per acre 
 once in about seven years, plowing it in after it becomes 
 pulverized by the action of the sun and rain. They do 
 not expect much from*it the first or second year, but 
 during the third and fourth they reap the benefit." 

"Hon. Seth Sprague asked, what was the action of 
 lime ? It had been said that it exhausts land. Is it so? 
 He had seen little benefit from lime on sandy land. Mr. 
 Jenkins said two of his neighbors used several wagon 
 loads of lime on various crops. The effect was rather 
 injurious." 

We fancy we see a smile, perhaps of derision, playing 
 upon the faces of the farmers of Adams, Berks, Bucks, 
 Chester, Cumberland, Dauphin, Delaware, Franklin, 
 Lancaster, Washington, and many other counties in this 
 State, where lime is used in large quantities, on learn- 
 ing that lime is applied at the rate of eighty bushels per 
 acre before being slacked. 

Rolling Pasture and Mowing Fields, &c. 
 We would especially encourage at this season, the use 
 of the field roller, not only on grass fields but also on the 
 wheat. The advantages of it are not fully estimated or 
 its use in the spring of the year would be more common. 
 Independent of the benefit of reducing down inequalities 
 of surface, and making a field more level for the opera- 
 tion of the reaper or mowing machine, or even scythe, it 
 presses the earth around the roots, which had been heav- 
 ed up by the frost, and which by exposure to the sun 
 and air, would otherwise be destroyed. We have seen 
 roots of clover, as has every farmer, on fields recently 
 seeded down, raised entirely out of the ground by the 
 alternate freezing and thawing in the spring. The roller 
 closes up these open fissures, compresses the soil around 
 them, and thus prevents their being entirely killed off. 
 Many of the bare places to be seen in fields, are attrib- 
 utable to this cause, more than any other. We are 
 often astonished, and indeed somewhat disheartened, to 
 see intelligent farmers, who take the greatest pains to 
 have their fields well set with grass, buy only the best 
 quality and extra quantity of seed, considering the 
 loss of the grass field in their usual rotation greater 
 than even the loss of a grain crop, and after having 
 done every thing else to attain the desired object, yet en- 
 tirely neglect the use of the roller in the spring, particu-
