THE FARM JOURNAL. 

[March 

iarly on such fields as have been recently seeded. It 
 seems a blindness to their own interests entirely inexpli- 
 cable, and iuexcuseable to us as the theory of rolling and 
 operation are both so simple. 

These remarks will also apply with equal force to the 
 wheat field. 

In seeding oats, its use is more common, although the 
 effects are no more beneficial. It breaks the clods and 
 presses earth to the seed, much of which would other- 
 wise be uncovered and lost. 

The proper season for rolling is also important, as if 
 done too early, and before the severe freezing spells are 
 past, the ground will become poached by the animals' feet 
 and much injured. If left too late till the ground becom- 
 es hard, but little comparative benefit will result. Every 
 farmer can judge for himself of the right time. 

The best wooden rollers are made,of two sections, with 
 an iron bar passing through each, and should be at least 
 three and a half feet in diameter. A box may be con- 
 structed on the frame over the roller, to contain the stones 
 collected on the field. We do not know the cost of these, 
 but iron ones we believe may tee obtained at a cost of 
 about $50, six feet long and thirty inches in diameter, 
 consisting of six sections, with box and tongue complete. 
 They are of course more durable and greatly to be pre- 
 ferred. 

Shropshire Sheep. 

A new and distinct breed of sheep are now exciting 
 some attention in England under the name of Shrop- 
 shire. They are described as of a large and robust 
 character, and the breeders in the county of Salop, ad- 
 joing Worcester and Warwick, where they may now be 
 found, appear to have originated their present distinct 
 type by following the example of Ellman with respect to 
 the Southdowns. 

Commencing with the very excellent breed, which has 
 existed in that section for many centuries, they have 
 now obtained a much larger size and greater aptitude to 
 fatten ; and the only question would seem to be, has 
 fixity of type been obtained, so that their present char- 
 acteristics may be perpetuated ? 

Several sales have been made the past season, when 
 shearling rams have brought as high as $100 to $150, 
 and ewes $20 to $30 per head. One ram sold for $250. 

There is no evidence at present to show in what re- 
 spect, if any, Shropshire sheep are superior to South- 
 downs, and we shall continue to prize the latter till we 
 gee the plainest kind of testimony to prove that they are 
 not deserving of their present high position, as the best 
 breed of sheep for the carcass, which we opine will not 
 be very soon. 

A New Plant â€” Holcus Saccharatus. 
 Our foreign exchanges advise us of a new plant under 
 the above name being introduced into France from the 
 north of China, which promises to be of considerable 
 value. A pamphlet has been published on the subject 
 by M. Louis Vilmorin, of Pax-is, who is considered high 
 authority, from which it appears that the juice of the 
 Holcus furnishes three important products, sugar, alco- 
 hol and a fermented liquor analogous to cider; and that 
 it may be profitably cultivated for sugar in any region 

between where the sugar cane ceases to thrive and the 
 forty-fourth degree of latitude, and that elsewhere it will 
 be profitably cultivated for its alcoholic products. 

He obtained from stems, from which the peel had 
 been stripped, at the rate of fifty-five to sixty per cent, 
 of juice. The upper joints and spikes were only cut off, 
 but by cutting off more and subjecting the stems to a 
 better process of crushing, he thinks that seventy per 
 cent, uf juice could be obtained. The quantity of stems 
 employed, large and small together, was 553 lbs., giving 
 twenty-three gallons of juice of the density of 1.052. - 
 The quantity of sugar from the Holcus is estimated 
 higher than from the beet root, but involves more labor 
 and expense to extract, and the quantity of spirit ex- 
 ceeds that from beet root by about sixty gallons per 
 acre. The amount of juice yielded from an acre is 
 about 1207 gallons. 

The refuse also consists of excellent fibre, easily ex- 
 tracted and easily bleached, and worth at least $50 per 
 ton to the paper makers, and probably much more. 

A more detailed account of the process of cultivation 
 in France is about being published. 

Fruit Catalogue for General Cultivation. 

We have lately received a copy of the report of the 
 American Pomological Society, at its last convention in 
 Boston. It contains very much of interest and impor- 
 tance to the fruit grower, and we have made in the pres- 
 ent number of Farm Journal copious extracts, which we 
 shall occasionally continue. As the season is now at 
 hand for planting fruit trees, we give below the last re- 
 vised list of fruits recommended by the society for gen- 
 eral cultivation. It contains several alterations and ad- 
 ditions from the first one published, and is eminently 
 worthy of attention, combining as it does the long ex- 
 perience of our most distinguished Pomologists from all 
 parts of the United States. Many fruits of local interest 
 and value are of course omitted, but the list, as far as it 
 goes, is entirely reliable. The biennial meetings of 
 the American Pomological Society have developed a vast 
 amount of information, and have been of immense ad- 
 vantage to the cause of Pomology. 

We give on another page, from the appendix to the re- 
 port, the valuable communication from Dr. Harris, on 
 the diseases and insects affecting fruit trees and vines, 
 which we especially commend to all our readers.
