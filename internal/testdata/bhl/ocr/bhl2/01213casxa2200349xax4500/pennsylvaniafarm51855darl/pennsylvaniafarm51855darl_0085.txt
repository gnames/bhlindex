The Black Gum on Peach Trees. 

A correspondent of the Country Gentleman, throws 
 out the following hints as to the cause of this disease: 

Last year I noticed a disease which had shown itself 
 among the peach trees in this vicinity, and which was 
 noticed in the March number of the Cultivator. The 
 fruit last year, wherever the trees were much affected, 
 was entirely destroyed, while others bore but two or 
 three here and there. At the present time the bark of 
 some of the trees looks as if scathed by fire, and last 
 year the trunk, (from the many exudations of the sap) 
 presented during the warm wet days of spring, an ulce- 
 rated character. In some respect? the disease resembles 
 the black knots, which often cover the damson plum 
 tree, and there are grounds for believeiug it to be anal- 
 ogous, but whether caused by the same insect remains 
 to be shown. 

Some years ago, the Morello cherry became in all this 
 region of country affected by the black knots, and, 
 wherever it was not watched, covered the trees and soon 
 left them leafless, and disgusting objects. If the disease 
 can diffuse itself from the plum to the cherry tree, why 
 may it not also to the peach? As a general rule, it is 
 true, that each species of trees have insects that feed 
 on them, peculiar to the species; but there are excep- 
 tions to the general rules, and we find the common 
 caterpillar feeding on the leaves of the apple, pear, and 
 cherry. 

It is yet a disputed question, whether the knots on the 
 damson plum are caused by an insect ; for although the 
 curculio eggs have been found in the knots, it is under 
 such circumstances as would not lead us to infer, that 
 the excresences are its work. The aspect of the interior 
 of the knots looks as if made by insects, and these may 
 be so minute as to escape detection by the naked eye or 
 a common microscope. In all these fruit trees the foli- 
 age of the sap appears to be arrested by the compres- 
 sion of the fibres of the wood. 

I have noticed that a number of gardens west of mine 
 have a great many plum and Morello cherry trees com- 
 pletely covered with the black knots; and the prevailing 
 wind is a north wester. The peach trees east and south 
 of these gardens, as far as I have observed, with a few 
 exceptions, exhibit the disease of the black gum ; while 
 those north and west are sound, and bore last year good
