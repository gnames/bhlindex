crops. Hence I would argue, that the insects are borne 
 on the wind from tree to tree. In my own garden, I 
 mentioned last year that some trees were diseased more 
 than others, which I attributed to their bearing early or 
 late fruit; but which I now think, is owing to their loca- 
 tion with respect to the wind. I should mention the 
 fact, that I have green and yellow fruited plum trees in 
 the same garden, which exhibit no appearance of the 
 knots ; and an individual told me this day, that he had 

plum trees covered with the knots in his garden inter- 
 mixed with peach trees, and yet his peach trees were 
 sound. I do not at present see how to reconcile these 
 facts, but further experience may show whether or not, 
 the disease mentioned is the same with that of the pur- 
 ple plum. 

I have tried ashes, lime, and washing the trunks with 
 sulphate of iron with some apparent benefit, but with- 
 out any radical cure.

LEICESTER EWE. 

The above is a portrait of a very beautiful Leicester 
 ewe, which, with three other ewes and two bucks of the 
 same breed, were imported in August last by Christo- 
 pher Fallon, Esq., of Philadelphia, and are now at his 
 farm in Delaware county, a few miles from the city. 

The ewe, above engraved by Clarkson, is a very beau- 
 tiful specimen of the breed, large size, round barrel 
 form, heavy in most profitable points, and with very small 
 offal. She took the first premium at the late Pennsyl- 
 vania State Fair, and also at the exhibition in Delaware 
 county, as did also a buck lamb from her, now a year 
 old, as the best of his age and class. 

This buck lamb is for sale, and those who wish to pro- 
 cure stock of this valuable breed, we would recommend 
 to visit Mr. Fallon's farm, or address his manager 
 George Drayton, Upper Darby Post office, Delaware 
 county, Pennsylvania. We do not at this time know of 
 any other pure Leicester stock in this section of the 
 State. 

Mr. Fallon deserves great credit for his liberality and 
 public spirit in importing improved stock. 

Butter Stock. 
 Alexander Neave_ Springdale, Ohio, states in the Coun- 
 try Gentleman, that in 1851 he made from sixteen cows, 
 3,137 lbs. of butter, or 196 lbs. per cow. It sold for 
 $881,90, or $55,12, per cow. In 1852 from seventeen 
 cows was made 3,312 lbs. butter or 195 lbs. per cow, 
 and the butter sold for $876,57 or $51,56 per cow. This 
 statement includes all the butter, but makes no allow- 
 ance for cream and fresh milk used in a family of four- 
 teen persons. He also states that E. R. Glen received 
 the premium, three succesive years, of the Hamilton 
 County Ag. Society, for the greatest quantity of butter 
 made from one cow. She made sixteen pounds per week 
 at each trial, and in five weeks, at one trial, eighty-one 
 pottnds. They are called of " native" breed, but were 
 selected.
