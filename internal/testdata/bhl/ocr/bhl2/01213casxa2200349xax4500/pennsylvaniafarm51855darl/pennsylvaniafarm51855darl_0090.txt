in your fields, at 40 or 50 feet apart, and set four posts 
 round them to prevent cattle and plows hurting them. 
 Every tree that yields on an annual average, twenty 
 bushels of apples, or forty bushels each alternate year, 
 is worth $100 invested at five per cent; and by planting 
 orchards, you are leaving a fortune to your posterity, or 
 adding to the value of your farm if you wish to sell it. —

 Poultry Manure. 
 Mr. Editor : — The horticulturist cannot value too 
 highly the droppings of poultry. For the past two or 
 three years I have tested fully its properties, and feel 
 satisfied that one bushel of poultry manure mixed with 
 plaster, and used as a top dressing, is equivalent to ten 
 bushels of stable manure put into the ground in the usu- 
 al manner. It is particularly valuable for onion sets, as 
 well as for almost every other garden vegetable. My 
 process for its use is this — I dig and plant my seed, and 
 in the course of a few days, or about the time I think 
 the seed is begining to germinate, I take the manure, 
 previously mixed with a small portion of plaster and put 
 upon the hills or beds containing the seed. By the time 
 the shoots come up the manure is in a proper state for 
 working, it having decomposed by losing much of its am- 
 monia, and I find it requires less labor to keep the ground 
 loose than when not used, to say nothing of its effects 
 upon vegetation, which are incalculable. The season 
 for saving this manure is now at hand, and I feel satis- 
 fied that if once tried will never be abandoned, if the 
 manure can be had. 

I might also say in this connection that in conse- 
 quence of the attacks of the striped bug upon the cucum- 
 ber plant, it has become almost an impossibillity to cul- 
 tivate that much admired vegetable. By the use of air 
 slacked lime, sprinkled every few days over the plant, 
 their ravages may be checked, and the horticulturist find 
 no difficulty in raising any quantity of the vegetable. 
 The same remedy will apply to pumpkin and squash 
 vines. Yours, P.

 Productive Fowls — Gapes. 

Friend Editor: — Having recently become a subscri- 
 ber to the Farm Journal, with which I am well pleased, 
 and having seen an article in the last number headed 
 "Profitable Hens," by Joseph A. Woodward, I thought I 
 would give an account of our hens the past year, and 
 leave it to you whether to publish it or throw it into the 
 scrap bag. 

On New Year's day, 1854, we had thirty hens, which 
 were about one-fourth Shanghai, and two crowers, one 
 of which was about one-half Shanghai, which had mix- 
 ed with our common or mongrel breed. In the spring 
 we sold eight of our hens, which left twenty-two, from 
 which we sold 2760 eggs, and raised 145 chickens. The 
 eggs used in our family, or set under the hens and not 
 hatched, and the chickens lost when young, are not ta- 
 ken into account. 

I think we are a little ahead of J. A. W., as he had 
 thirty-five hens, which laid 2405 eggs, which included 
 those from which the chickens were hatched, if I under- 

stand him. Our hens run at large, and were fed on 
 corn, oats, and the screenings of wheat, and made their 
 nests where they could find a place. 

You may see that I have not got the Shanghai, Cochin 
 China, Black Spanish, or any other imported chicken 
 fever very badly, nor do I think I'll take it very soon. 
 I will just add that a little pot skimmings, or salty fat, 
 rubbed on the chicken's head, and a small portion put in 
 their feed has effectually cured the gapes with us.

 Barns. 

The barns of Pennsylvania are among the most conve- 
 nient, as well as most durably constructed, in the Union, 
 if not superior to any in these respects ; but the ques- 
 tion arises whether they are the "thing," as regards the 
 feeding purposes of cattle. Every farmer who has the 
 experience of feeding cattle must have seen them refuse 
 the very best of hay, and ask himself the question why 
 is this ? As a matter of course, there are different no- 
 tions advanced ; but is it not most likely owing to the 
 fact that fodder is generally stored immediately above 
 the cattle, and the ammonia and other volatile matter 
 arising from their excrements and breath is more or less 
 absorbed by the fodder, which is afterwards refused by 
 the cattle ? I have seen them walk up to the fodder, 
 smell at it, and leave it, or eat but very little — no more 
 than, barely enough to keep them from starving. Ani- 
 mals have the sense of smell more fully developed than 
 man, having instinct instead of reason to govern their 
 actions. 1 shall be happy to hear from one better qual- 
 ified than myself to write on this subject. J. S. K.

Oregon Pea. 
 Mr. Editor. — The article on the Oregon Pea, in your 
 January Tiumber, has no doubt made many of your read- 
 ers anxious to give it a trial. For the benefit of such I 
 would state that I have a small quantity of seed, which 
 I am willing to distribute in small parcels without 
 charge. 

I planted some seed the latter part of April. The 
 plants made a large growth, and produced an enormous 
 quantity of pods, but very little of the seed was ripe 
 when frost set in. My plot, however, was not adapted 
 to its proper growth; it was a level cold clayey soil, 
 which, with heavy spring rains, retarded the gi owth so 
 much that the plants did not begin to thrive until some 
 time in June. 

If the seed was sown as early as the season permitted, 
 in a warm sandy loam, I have no doubt but that it would 
 have ample time to come to perfection.

Homemade Guano— How Should it be Applied? 
 Mr. Editor: — I have observed many communications 
 in your valuable Journal, relative to "homemade guano," 
 hen manure, &c, but none of your correspondents have 
 written a word concerning the manner of applying it to 
 the crops. Every farmer knows that poultry manure is 
 very strong, and if applied in too large quantities will
