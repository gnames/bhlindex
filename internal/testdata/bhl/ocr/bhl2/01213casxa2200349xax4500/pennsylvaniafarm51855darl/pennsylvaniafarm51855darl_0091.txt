have an injurious effect on vegetation. We have been i the next or second generation, in the same ratio as the first, 

told to make alternate layers of this manure in our poul- 
 try houses, with peat, muck, wood ashes, plaster, &c, 
 &c. Now I will be much obliged to some one of your 
 numerous practical readers, if I am informed of the best 
 mode of applying hen manure to the corn crop. I have 
 probably from fifty to seventy-five bushels of this manure 
 and would like to apply it to my corn crop in the spring, 
 and not having experimented wih it am afraid lest I may 
 ut too much in the hill, and thereby injure the grain.

Raising Fruit and Grain from Seed, with the View of 
 Originating New Varieties. 

Mr. Darlington: — Sir: — With the desire of interesting 
 some of your numerous readers in the delightful study, or 
 employment of originating new varieties of grain, fruit, flow- 
 ers, &c, I wish to offer a few hints through the "Journal," 
 trusting that — should a single new variety be brought to 
 light by means of this crude article, my labor in preparing 
 it, will have been fully rewarded. 

With the object of raising something new; fruit or grain 
 that has not been before, we should attend to planting the 
 seed. There is a wide field open to the "experimenter" to 
 employ his time, in increasing the number of our enjoyments. 
 All our superior varieties of grain, fruit and vegetables, orig- 
 inated from seed — accidentally indeed, in most cases, but by 
 sowing any kind of grain, as for instance, take several kinds 
 of wheat, intermix and sow it, — the produce, or first crop 
 will not apparently vary from the kind sown; yet by re-sow- 
 ing this mixture, several years in succession, and closely ex- 
 aming the heads at maturity, we will find some among them 
 that differ — and by selecting and sowing the produce of 
 these heads separately, we may produce new and distinct 
 varieties, or a new kind of wheat, — then, by constantly se- 
 lecting the best, and rejecting the rest, permanent varieties 
 will be the result 

Planting the seeds of Apples, Pears, Grapes, &c, and care- 
 fully raising the young seedlings until they show fruit, is a 
 most pleasing employment for a person who has spare time 
 to devote to such an object. In this manner, you may origi- 
 nate a new fruit of value, and those stocks, that produce in- 
 ferior fruit, are not "labor lost," but are the very best to work 
 on superior fruit by engrafting. In this way most of our 
 choice fruits have originated, mostly, however, by mere 
 chance. Almost every neighborhood has some superior 
 apple, pear, plum, or grape, that came up accidentally in a 
 fence-row a clearing, or some other "out of the way place,' 
 and in all probability, was completely surrounded, and pro- 
 tected by a stockade of briars, and not cared for, till the 
 fruit recommended it to especial protection and notice. 
 Thus, many valuable fruits are added to the list by mere 
 accident. 

Personal experience induces me to urge this matter to the 
 favorable notice of all lovers of good fruit, and particularly 
 and especially to the young, as having a fair prospect of 
 longer time to operate, and consequently more encourage- 
 ment to test the result of experiments. 

During my short career, I have succeeded in raising va- 
 rious fruits from seed, though none of any extraordinary 
 merit. From the Seckle Pear, I have fruited a number of 
 seedlings, some superior in size, but all inferior to the parent 
 in quality; from the Choke Pear, I have a seedling of 
 "good" quality, and should seedlings of this improve with 

we might look for something worth "further trial." In plant- 
 ing some seeds of the Alexander grape, a blue or black varie- 
 ty, about one half proved to be males ; tho balance bore fruit 
 of every imaginable variety, size, color, form, &c, but all 
 except one or two, inferior to the parent ; one, and the only 
 one I retained, is a white or yellow grape, bunches small, 
 berries medium size, in quality superior to its parent— hardy, 
 healthy, and free from mildew, a decided acquisition. 

I might enlarge on my own experiments, but prefer to 
 refer to other experimenters. The "Hovey strawberry" is 
 the result of raising seedlings, and is now known, and ac- 
 knowledged, "the world over," almost, as standing iu the 
 first rank of that delicious fruit. — -the Mc'Avoy's superior, 
 Longworth's Prolific, Moyamensing, and many others, have 
 been raised from seed, and are an earnest of what can be 
 done. Then we hear of several persona, who are experi- 
 menting with the Grape, by artificially impregnating the 
 native with some Foreign varieties — the result thus far 
 augurs favorably. The "Houghton Seedling Gooseberry" 
 is the offspring of native and European parentage; if we 
 are rightly informed, the originator planted a native or wild 
 gooseberry, and surrounded it with some of the large English 
 varieties; thus being in close proximity, the wind, bees, and 
 other insects, carried tho pollen from one plant to the other, 
 and thereby impregnating the seed, — this seed produced by 
 the native plant was planted, and the young seedlings left 
 pretty much to take care of themselves; the consequence 
 was, that none but the most hardy could withstand such 
 rough usage, and all the weaker and more delicate, had, of 
 course, to "knock under" to the more hardy and thrifty 
 plants ; one of these was honored with a "habitation and a 
 name," and is worth more in our climate, than all the Euro- 
 pean kinds put together; and although not so largo as the 
 English prize berries, makes up for all deficiencies in that 
 respect by its enormous crops and healthy growth. 

The "New Rochelle" or "Lawton Blackberry," now so 
 much sought after, that plants can scarcely bo raised fast 
 enough to supply the demand, is no doubt a hybrid, acci- 
 dentally produced in the same way. 

We have on trial a new kind of wheat, which goes by the 
 name of "white blue stem, with red chaff," which we con- 
 sider a very superior artiele — it was started from a single 
 head found in a wheat field, and considered by the person 
 who discovered it, as something different from any thing he 
 had ever seen; he planted the seel separately, and again 
 planted the produce, till a sufficient quantity was had to 
 sow a field, — it turned out well, the grain is heavy, tho ker- 
 nel small, round, very white, and the flour extra; the neigh- 
 bors admired it, procured seed, and thus it is fast replacing 
 some other, and less valuable kinds. 

Again, we hear of a new Pea being originated by a gen- 
 tleman of Virginia, which is said to be proof, against the 
 pea bug, and it is believed when once disseminated, will prove 
 to be a valuable variety, — he having planted a row of the 
 common garden pea in his garden, and during their growth, 
 found a wild pea vine coming up and intermixing with the 
 others; on picking off the pods, he discovered one pod of a 
 different appearance from the rest; this he secured, and plan- 
 ted next season; this second crop was a well developed 
 hybrid, and for the three years that it has been planted, 
 retains its distinctive character. 

Instances might be multiplied, but enough has been said 
 to show what has been done, and this too, mostly, by mere 
 chance, or accidentally,— what then may we not hope for, 
 if persons will devote their attention to the subject, and 
 institute a regular set of experiments, with the intention of 
 raising new species, or varieties of grain, fruit, vegetables
