Seeds and New Plants. 

Mr. Darlington: — Your correspondent "Agricola" in 
 Jan. No. says '"he has been trying to procure seeds," of 
 some plants he names, "but without success." Now had he 
 given his real name and address, I should have been pleased 
 to have corresponded with him direct, but as he prefers to 
 remain incog. — "asking for light, yet preferring darkness," 
 I will, with your permission, notice some of the plants he 
 names through the "Journal." 

The Oregon Pea, I had on trial last year, — it is by far too 
 late for our climate, barely coming into flower when the 
 frost cuts them off. The Japan Pea, however, suits our cli- 
 mate, ripens early, and is far superior to the Oregon, in size 
 productiveness, and vigor of growth ; of this I have seeds 
 for further trial, and could spare a few. 

Oralis Crenata, I had some years since, but lost it; it 
 succeeded admirably in pot culture, producing its small tu- 
 bers in profusion, yet as soon as planted out in the open 
 ground, it would barely live through the season, without 
 increasing to any extent. If it would succeed in out-door 
 culture, it would be a valuable addition to our list of culi- 
 nary vegetables; the tubers are far more delicious than the 
 potatoe. The others I am unacquainted with, unless what 
 I cultivate as the cherry bean should prove the same as the 
 ohick-pea the description answers for both. But why rec- 
 ommend the Pea for poultry ? I doubt if Shanghai, would 
 relish it, unless ground or cooked ; at least, other grain 
 would have to be kept out of the way for some length of 
 time. The Douri corn is an excellent feed for poultry, and 
 succeeds well; even the Chocolate corn, and Broom corn are 
 greatly superior to peas in productiveness, and a good feed 
 for small and large chickens. 

In this connection, I may add a few remarks on another 
 vegetable, which was highly recommended at the time, as a 
 substitute for the potatoe, I allude to the Aracacha, of South 
 America; this, like the Oxalis crenata, seemed to do pretty 
 well in pot cultivation, but as soon as planted in the open 
 ground, would barely live,making no growth in consequence . 

From failing to grow to perfection any new plant or veg- 
 etable on a first trial, we ought not to be discouraged, as I 
 well remember the Mediterranean wheat that I had on trial, 
 some five or six years before it was brought into general 
 notice. It was then a large, rough, dark, yet shrivelled and 
 imperfect berry, nothing but "skin and bone," as a miller 
 remarked at the time. I discharged it from my premises. 
 It is now more generally distributed, and a more certain 
 crop in all localities, than any other variety extant, — thus 
 improving greatly in quality since its first introduction. 

A new esculent root, recently introduced into France, and 
 which is highly spoken of as a substitute for the Potatoe; 
 the Gesneria Eseulcnta ; this also does well in pot cultivation, 
 increasing fast; I have not yet tried it in open culture, but 
 fear it will not succeed. Very respectfully,

Grafting and Pruning Fruit Trees. 
 Mr. J. L. Darlington: — I take this opportunity of giving 
 my experience in the art of grafting fruit trees of different 
 kinds, together with a few rules, to the readers of the Farm 
 Journal, which, if strictly adhered to, will enable them to be 
 their own nurserymen, so far as raising fruit trees is concerned. 

Inoculating is the operation of transplanting any partic- 
 ular variety of tree, to the stock of an inferior, or wild one. 
 It is generally performed on small trees, and only during 
 the time when the sap flows most freely, which is about 
 July, August and September. Select for the buds the ripest 
 and strongest young twigs of the year, which should be taken 
 from tha top of the tree, because they have all the advan- 
 tage of the sun, and free circulation of air, and are more 
 likely to be thrifty, than those from lower limbs and middle 
 of the trees. Cut off the leaves, leaving the foot-stalks 
 entire; having selected a smooth place in the stock, make 
 a perpendicular slit downwards, quite through the bark, an 
 inch or more in length; make a cross cut at the top of this 
 slit, a little slanting downwards; next proceed to raise the 
 bark, being careful not to injure the sap-wood in the least; 
 then, with expedition, take off a bud, which is effected by 
 entering the knife half an inch above or below the bud or 
 eye, and slicing it off with the bark, always leaving a thin 
 slip of wood, of about one third the length, immediately 
 under the bud ; the bud is to be immediately inserted in the 
 stock, to the bottom of the slit, and between the bark and 
 wood, and the top squared even with the cross cut; then it 
 is to be bound above and below the bud, with either cotton, 
 woolen yarn, or bass matting. The string is to be taken off 
 in a few days, or whenever appearances indicate that it 
 may girdle the trees. The following spring, as soon as the 
 buds begin to swell, cut off the portion of stock abovo them, 
 of all that have taken well, and saw the top off, and graft 
 those missed. 

Scollop budding is done, by cutting from a small stock a 
 thin narrow scollop of wood, about an inch in length, and 
 taking from a twig, a thin scollop of wood of the same 
 length, containing a bud; this is applied instantly, and fitted 
 at top and bottom, with at least one of its sides, and bound 
 down as before directed. This can be done in the spring, 
 and if it fails, another chance will be afforded in July or 
 August, 

Next in order is grafting, — this is performed in spring 
 I always have found it a good rule to do it just before the 
 buds began to swell. 

Whip or Splice Grafting. — This mode is practised gener- 
 ally on small stocks, and is most successful when the stock 
 and scion are of equal size; then the adjustment can be 
 made perfectly. The scion which consists of the young wood 
 of last year's growth, is cut to the length of about four in- 
 ches, this and the stock are each to be cut sloping, an inch 
 or more, and tongued. Tonguing consists in cutting a slit 
 in the middle of the stock downwards, and a corresponding 
 one, in the scion upwards ; both are now to be nicely joined 
 so that one of the sides at least, if not both, shall perfectly 
 meet, and to be securely bound, as before, and covered with 
 grafting wax; as soon as the stock and scion are completely 
 united, the string is to be removed. 

Cleft Grafting is performed on stocks from one to two 
 inches in diameter. The head of the stock is sawed off, at a 
 part free from knots, and the top pared smooth with a sharp 
 knife; slit down the stock, through the centre, to the depth 
 of about one and a half or two inches, and insert a wedge 
 to keep it open for the reception of the scion, which is to be 
 prepared in the shape of a wedge, with an eye if possible in 
 the upper part thus formed ; and always turn the eye in 
 next to the heart of the stock; success is thus more certain 
 The scion is now to be inserted, so that the sap-wood of 
 the two will exactly meet. 

In cleft grafting, it is best to put in two scions, and then 
 they heal both ways, and cover the stock much sooner. 
 When they entirely heal over, cut off the weakest, and leave 
 the others to make the tree.
