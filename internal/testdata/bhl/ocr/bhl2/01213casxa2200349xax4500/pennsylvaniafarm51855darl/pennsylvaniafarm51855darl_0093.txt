Scollop Grafting. — Prepare the stock in the form of a wedge 
 by two sloping cuts, one on each side. The scion is pre- 
 pared by splitting it upwards, and paring out the middle 
 part to a point, both sides. When the stock and scion are 
 of equal size, the adjustment may be made perfectly; but if 
 unequal, one side must exactly meet; the whole is secured 
 by a string, and covered with grafting wax. I grafted two 
 May-Duke cherries, in this manner, six years ago last 
 March, and now they will measure threo inches in diameter 
 t the place they were grafted; when at the time of grafting 
 hey were about one quarter of an inch in diameter. 

Root Grafting. — This operation is intended for the grape 

ine, just below the surface of the ground. It is performed 

the same as cleft grafting, except it is waxed up and the 

dirt replaced. It can also be performed on pieces of roots, 

where suitable stocks are scarce. 

Side Grafting. — This mode may be practised on parts of 
 a tree, where a limb is wanting. It may be done in two 
 ways, first, the scion is prepared in the same manner as for 
 splice grafting; the bark and wood, on the side of the stock 
 is cut sloping, and the scion being adjusted as carefully as 
 possible, it is bound and covered with wax. Second, the 
 scion being cut sloping, as in whip grafting, a cross cut is 
 made in the side of the tree, on the top of a perpendicular 
 slit, the bark of the tree above the cross cut, is pared down 
 slanting to the wood ; the bark is now raised as in inocula- 
 ting, and the scion inserted, bound fast, and covered with wax. 

Inarching or Grafting by. Approach. — This mode will ap- 
 ply to all such trees and shrubs, which succeed with difficulty 
 by other modes. The tree to be grafted must be growing 
 very near the tree that is to furnish the grafts. The limbs 
 of each tree, to be thus united, must be pared, with a long 
 sloping cut of several inches, nearly to their centre, and the 
 parts thus prepared are to be brought together, and firmly 
 seoured, so that the sap-wood shall exactly meet, on at least 
 one side, and then covered with grafting wax. When a com- 
 plete union has taken place, the trees are separated with a 
 knife, by cutting off the scion below the junction, and cut- 
 ting off the stock above 

Grafting Clay is made of one third part of fresh horse 
 manure, free from litter, one third of cow manure, and one 
 third of good clay, with a small mixture of hair well beaten 
 and incorporated several days before using. 

Grafting wax is made, three parts rosin, three parts bees 
 wax, and one part of tallow, melted together; when well 
 mixed, it is poured into cold water, and worked up like shoe- 
 makers wax, by hand. This wax may be melted, and spread 
 with a brush on strong brown paper, and cut into strips of 
 a suitable size, when it may be quickly applied. In cool 
 weather it may be warmed by the breath, so as to become 
 adhesive. 

• Grafting Wrappers can be made by cutting thin gum- 
 elastic into strips of a suitable size, which are easily applied, 
 and answer a very good purpose; they keep out wet and air, 
 and can be taken off and used again. 

Pruning. — If the branches of a young tree, issuing at, 
 and above the requisite height, be made by pruning to 
 strike out from the main stem in every direction, above the 
 horizontal, and the interior of these be carefully kept from 
 interfering with each other, for a fow years, little or no pru- 
 ning will ever afterwards be needed. I have reference to 
 orchards of the apple, peach, pear, plum and cherry. It is 
 not necessary to lay open, and expose all parts of the trees 
 to the direct rays of the sun, the atmosphere being sufficient 
 of itself to ripen the fruit. Heavy pruning should be 
 avoided as much as possible, but when in the case of grafting 
 or heading down for a new growth, it becomes necessary, it 
 should always be performed between the time the frost is 

coming out of the ground in the spring, and the opening of 
 the leaf. The most suitable time for moderate pruning, 
 which is needed every year, is about the 21st of June; 
 wounds, of all kinds, heal over then much quicker and bet- 
 ter, the wood remaining sound and bright. I have even 
 debarked a j'oung apple tree at this time, that renewed its 
 bark in three or four days. 

The above are the principal rules, that I have adopted in 
 the grafting and propagating of fruit trees, for the last seven 
 or eight years, and I have found, that they were attended 
 with good success; and so will any, and all your readers, if 
 they will pick up the resolution to try. If he fails once, let 
 him try again, let him kill all the natural fruit trees on his 
 place in the attempt, rather than not have them grafted 
 with some desirable varieties. 

Before I close this communication, I must drop a hint 
 about transplanting. When trees are removed, for the pur- 
 pose of being finally transplanted, their roots should bo pre- 
 served, fresh and entire. If this has not been done, their 
 tops must be shortened in proportion to the loss their roots 
 have sustainod. October, November, and immediately after 
 the first hard frosts have arrested vegetation, is the best 
 time in the whole year for transplanting trees. (I am well 
 aware, that this theory is contrary, to the general opinion, 
 but my observation is, that a tree planted in the spring, 
 will stand until the first of May or June, before it comes 
 into leaf, and then grow but feebly the rest of the season.) 
 But when trees are transplanted in the fall, the earth be- 
 comes consolidated at their roots, and they are ready to 
 vegetate with the first opening of spring. I have seen men 
 plant, or more properly speaking, cram trees into a hole the 
 size of a half peck measure, wind up the roots into a lump, 
 tramp the dirt on them, and then wonder that they would 
 not grow. 

The holes for receiving the trees should be dug from four 
 to six feet in diameter, according to the size of the tree, and 
 eighteen inches deep; the subsoil should be thrown out, and 
 replaced with rich soil, with a mixture of manure; the tree 
 should be set no deeper than it stood before, otherwise the 
 roots will bo farther from the surface than nature designed 
 them, and consequently will bo injured by it. The fibres 
 should be spread in a lateral direction, and tho soil inti- 
 mately and compactly placed about them. Manure may be 
 placed beneath, above and on all sides, but ought never to 
 bo allowed to come in contact with the roots, as it is liable 
 to corrupt and injure them; finish by treading the ground 
 hard. When evergreen trees are planted, it is generally a 
 good rule to pour a few gallons of water around the tree, 
 previous to treading hard the earth ; finish earthing, and 
 tread hard, in about an hour afterwards. This is an excel- 
 lent and safe mode with regard to any tree.

Information Wanted. 

J. L. Darlington: — Dear Sir: — Allow me to inquire if 
 you have been placed in possesion of any means to prevent 
 cows from calving prematurely, as I have lost fifteen calves 
 within the last twelve months in that way. I noticed, the 
 last two years, that my calves were very feeble, when they 
 were dropped. I have the water forced into my barnyard 
 through leaden pipes, whether that is the cause, or some 
 other disease, I can not account for; if you or any of your 
 correspondents, know any thing that would prevent them, 
 in this way, I would be greatly obliged if you could com- 
 municate it through the Farm Journal. J. B. 

Our correspondent will find the information desired in the
