Scott's Little Giant Corn and Cob Mill. 
 We had an opportunity within a few days past of 
 witnessing the operation of this mill, of which we are 
 informed over two thousand were sold during the past 
 season. It crushed and ground corn and cobs with more 
 rapidity than any other portable mill we have seen, and 
 quite fine enough too for feeding purposes. We are in- 
 duced to believe it a valuable acquisition to the farmer. 
 The economy of grinding up cobs with the corn is hardly 
 now an open question. Full experiments have been 
 made, and the results frequently published. It is not 
 pretended that cobs are rich, in the elements of nutrition, 
 compared with the grain, but they have been found to 
 yield spirit on distillation — a proof that they are far 
 from valueless, — and also answer admirably the purpose 
 of procuring the necessary distension of the stomach, 
 and promoting digestion. H. Ellsworth asserted some 
 years ago he had fattened hogs on cob meal alone, and 
 most of our best feeders have now adopted the practice 
 of grinding corn and cobs together for fattening cattle. 
 "The Little Giant" is of three sizes, costing respectively 
 6 

$44, $55 and $66. The first will grind with one horae 
 eight to ten bushels of corn and cob meal per hour; the 
 second or medium size, ten to fifteen bushels ; and the 
 largest size requiring two horses from fifteen to twenty 
 bushels per hour. Estimating the usual toll for grind- 
 ing of one-eighth, the time lost in going to mill at a sea- 
 son when the roads are generally in their worst condi- 
 tion, the inconvenience to the horses, and the fact that 
 trips have to be made frequently, as a large quantity of 
 corn and cob meal together will soon heat and spoil, wo 
 think the Little Giant Corn Grinder is well worthy of a 
 trial. It can be graduated to grind either fine or 
 coarse, as may be required. 

SELF CLOSING GATE AND DOOR HINGES. 

The above engraving represents a new article of 
 hinges for gates and doors, which will cause them when 
 open to close gently of their own accord, and without 
 the gate or door being thrown out of a perpendicular 
 position. These hinges, we can assure our readers, are 
 no humbug. They are made by Messrs. Woolman & 
 Coffin, No. 52 North Fourth Street. Samples have 
 been left at this office, where they can be inspected by 
 farmers. For further information apply to the manu- 
 facturers as above. Fastenings of new and simple con- 
 struction, not liable to get out of order, may be had 
 with or without the hinges. 

Stapleton's Fat Chester County Steer. 

This fine animal was slaughtered in Philadelphia 
 about two weeks ago, and proved to be the heaviest ever 
 killed in the city, except one, the Berks county steer, 
 some few yeai's ago, which weighed over 2300. 

The present steer was fed by Mr. Stapleton, of Willis- 
 town, Chester county, and purchased of him by Messrs. 
 A. R. Paul & John Jones, two of our most respectable 
 and enterprising victuallers. We understand they gave 
 for him, and a three year old steer, the sum of one thou- 
 sand dollars. The large one weighed nett 2054 pounds, 
 and had in him 265 pounds rough fat. He is said to be 
 the fattest steer ever killed in Pennsylvania. We regret 
 not having yet obtained his measurement, girth, length, 
 width over the hips, &c, but hope to have it for our 
 next number. The dimensions of so fine an animal 
 should be preserved for future reference.
