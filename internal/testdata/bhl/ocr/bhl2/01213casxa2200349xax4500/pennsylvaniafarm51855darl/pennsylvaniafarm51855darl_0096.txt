other, proved only small by comparison, as he reached I 
 the extraordinary weight for his age of 1220 pounds. ] 
 His history is no less extraordinary than his weight, and 
 speaks a whole volume of instruction to feeders as to the 
 importance of good, vigorous keep from the start. He 
 was what might be called a foundling. A drover pass- 
 ing along with a drove of cows had one that dropped a 
 calf; as it was unable to travel he threw it over the 
 fence, where it was picked up by Mr. Stapleton's son, 
 put to another cow, and otherwise well cared for. This 
 attention and care was no doubt continued throughout. 
 We have often observed, when boys have had animals 
 given to them to bring up, and no restriction about ac- 
 cess to a good meal chest, they somehow or other have 
 grown larger and done better than the rest of the stock. 
 It was so with this steer, and it suggests a good practi- 
 cal hint to farmers generally. 

Mr. Paul adverted to another very important fact il- 
 lustrated by these fine cattle, in the heavy loss sustained 
 by feeders in undertaking to fatten too many head, in- 
 stead of concentrating their efforts on a smaller num- 
 ber; in other words, obtain a given amount of weight, 
 viith fewer mouths to feed. If a farmer can make four 
 steers weigh 4000 pounds, he will be greatly the gainer 
 rather than getting the 4000 pounds from six steers. 
 His additional profit will be just the difference in cost 
 between raising four and raising six, the latter also be- 
 ing at an increase of risk. The principle also applies to 
 a small and a large quantity of land — the true rule be- 
 ing, keep a few cattle, and keep them well, rather than 
 many cattle, and only moderate keep — small farms well 
 tilled and manured rather than many acres half cultiva- 
 ted. Napoleon owed his success to concentrating his 
 efforts on a given point, and every farmer, as well as 
 other business man, must succeed on the same princi- 
 ple. 

In addition to the splendid display of beef from these 
 two steers, which graced a couple of stalls in our Phila- 
 delphia market, always celebrated in this respect, John 
 Jones also exposed for sale at the same time beef from 
 the large steer which took the first premium at our late 
 State Fair. He purchased him from Mr. Palmer, of 
 Delaware county, by whom he was fed and exhibited. 
 His nett weight was 1520 pounds. It is a matter of re- 
 gret he was not kept for another year, as he had the 
 frame for filling up a much greater weight, and was evi- 
 dently not mature. 

Lolium Perenne — Perennial Rye Grass. 

The accounts we hear from different sections of coun- 
 try as to the merits of this grass induce us again to call 
 attention to it, and we believe, both from what we have 
 seen and heard, it is going to form a valuable addition 
 to our pasture and mowing fields. AVe would greatly 
 prefer it ourselves for seeding with clover to timothy. 
 It has several very important recommendations. It is a 
 rapid grower, is perennial, is well furnished with radi- 
 cal leaves, stock are particularly fond of it either for 
 hay or pasture, it will bear easily two good cuttings, 
 and keeps green to a later period in the fall than most 
 other species. 

We have known cattle to leave all other kinds of pas- 
 ture when they had access to the rye grass, and one of 

our friends, who has several acres of it in a most luxu- 
 riant condition, informs us that in some parts of Eng- 
 land, he has known the hay from it to be reserved espe- 
 cially for choice feed to the carriage horses. The most 
 extensive cultivators of it, that we know of, are tbe 
 Messrs. Reybold, of Delaware. In the second volume of 
 the Farm Journal, page 356, one of them in answer to 
 an enquiry says: "it will afford more feed than any oth- 
 er kind of grass, and its fattening qualities are equal to 
 the best natural green grass." "One peck is sufficient 
 to the acre if sown with clover, or two pecks if sown 
 alone." "Cattle, sheep and horses prefer it either for 
 pasture or hay to timothy." 

A late number of the American Agriculturist say3 
 that "ray and rye grass are entirely different grasses, 
 and should not be confounded with each other." We 
 consider them synonymous terms, applicable to one kind 
 of grass, and they are thus generally used; the latter, 
 however, being the more proper term. It further says, 
 "rye grass is not equal to American orchard grass." 
 Our experience in the latter is, that it is more worthless 
 than any other grass for either hay or pasture, and un- 
 fortunately like many other evil things, it is also hard 
 to get rid of. The rye grass on the contrary is eaten 
 with avidity, and is highly nutritious. Where our 
 neighbor received his impressions we do not know, for 
 Donaldson, one of the best English authorities and latest 
 writers on grasses, says, "Rye grass is regarded in 
 England as not far removed from being the first in point 
 of general utility, and forms the plant of all others best 
 suited for general purposes. For a crop of hay along 
 with clovers, no other grass will afford an equal quan- 
 tity and quality of produce on all the different vai-iety 
 of soils on -which they are sown. It yields very readily, 
 and with much less comparative trouble, an abundance 
 of sound healthy seed, and of certain growth ; it rises 
 early in the spring, and is much relished by all kinds of 
 stock ; the hay is good and fetches a high price, and it 
 is used with much advantage when sown in autumn 
 along with other plants as spring feed for sheep." 
 Donaldson also says, "It produces stems during the whole 
 season, while some grasses produce only one." 

We have sometimes, but very rarely, heard a similar 
 opinion about rye grass to that of the American Agri- 
 culturist, but it is far overbalanced by other favorable 
 testimony from those who have tried it. It probably 
 succeeds best on strong land, developing most in such 
 circumstances its peculiar and valuable tendency to 
 throw up stems and radical leaves in profusion. 

Loudon says, "After all the experiments that have 
 been made on the other grasses, none have been found 
 to equal the perennial rye grass for a course of mowing 
 and pasturing for two, three or seven years. It is sown 
 in Italy, and especially in Lombardy, and also in France 
 and Germany, along with clover, for the same purposes 
 as in England." Von Thaer remarks, "Though some 
 have tried other species, both in these countries and in 
 England, they have in the end returned to rye grass." 
 Such highly favorable testimony from abroad is fully 
 corroborated by the experience of our best farmers here, 
 and we only wonder that it is not more generally known. 
 Seed can be obtained at nearly all the seed stores in our 
 principal cities.
