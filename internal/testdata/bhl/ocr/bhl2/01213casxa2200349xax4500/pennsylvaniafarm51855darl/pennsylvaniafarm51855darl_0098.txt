you to the echo, and to-morrow, however faithful to the dic- 
 tates of conscience, might attempt to bury yon in the depths 
 of obscurity. Nor was it snatched from the unholy fires of 
 fanaticism or faction, whose false glare might for a time 
 emblazon, but in the end would be sure to consume and vic- 
 timize you. Nor was it won on the tented field, a bloody 
 trophy, to deck your victor brow. 

No, sir, none of these. This testimonial was earned by 
 you, in the peaceful, unpretending field of agriculture ; it 
 is a sheaf most worthily reaped from a harvest, the seed of 
 which you most faithfully sowed. It is a tribute from the 
 friends of agriculture in Philadelphia, who witnessed your 
 unsurpassed exertions in conducting the late exhibition at 
 Powelton — an exhibition that did credit, I might say honor, 
 to the State, and enriched the treasury of the State Agri- 
 cultural Society. 

Without further preface I shall refer to the inscription on 
 these beautiful articles, illustrated by devices emblematic 
 of Agriculture, Horticulture, and Industry, richly chased 
 and of exquisite finish, reflecting credit upon the taste and 
 skill of the artificer. It reads : "Presented to Robert C. 
 Walker, Esq., Secretary of the State Agricultural Society, 
 by the friends of Agriculture in Philadelphia, as a token of 
 their high appreciation of his devotedness and zeal in pro- 
 moting the interests of Agriculture, and of his gentlemanly 
 deportment, during their intercourse with him, pending the 
 great Agricultural exhibition at Powelton, September, 1854." 

This, sir, with the emblems, is sufficiently indicative of 
 the merits and motives of you and your agricultural friends. 
 Receive, then, this splendid Silver Tea Set, and long may 
 you live, in peace and prosperity, to enjoy them in your 
 family circle ; and at length, when your days shall be closed, 
 may the name I am sure you will transmit to your children 
 be cherished and preserved unsullied by them ; and may 
 these memorials, under the guidance of Divine Providence, 
 tend to inspire them to follow in the footsteps of their 
 honored father. 

Mr. Walker's Reply : — Sir : — In preforming the duty 
 imposed upon you by citizens of Philadelphia, to make a 
 formal presentation of this flattering token of their esteem 
 and friendship, you have kindled emotions of thankfulness 
 and gratitude not easily expressed. I am sure, however, 
 that I fully appreciate this valuable testimonial, coming as 
 it does, from the friends of Agriculture as a reward for my 
 attention to the cause they wish to promote. It is, indeed, 
 more highly prized than if it were a memento to record 
 some political party ascendancy, or some heroic deed upon 
 the battle-field. 

In accepting, gratefully as I do, this beautiful gift you 
 have offered on behalf of the friends of Agriculture in Phil- 
 adelphia, I would ask you to tender them my sincere thanks 
 for their disinterested kindness, and assure them, I cherish 
 the hope, that this testimonial may never be dismembered 
 from the family circle, which it will grace by its usefulness 
 and beauty, and that there it will ever be consecrated to the 
 memory of the donors. In according my deep indebtedness 
 to those whom you represent, I must not forget my obliga- 
 tion to you, sir, for the kind manner in which you have dis- 
 charged your duty. And when I reflect that you are a dis- 
 tinguished farmer of the practical school, and that Mount 
 Airy, your residence, has become celebrated by your im- 
 proved husbandry, the compliment is the more to be appre- 
 ciated and the favor the more highly esteemed. 

If you want to ascertain whether a soil or substance 
 contains lime, you may pour upon it a small quantity of 
 vinegar, or dilute muriatic acid. If lime is present, the 
 mixture will froth up or effervesce. — Dr. Kent.
