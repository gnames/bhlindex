ral society in this Commonwealth, which shall have been 
 organized at least three months preceding the time of elec- 
 tion; and it shall be the duty of the said board of trustees, 
 to appoint two of their number as judges, to hold the said 
 election, to receive and count the votes, and return the same 
 to the board of trustees, with their certificate of the number 
 of votes cast, and for whom; whereupon the said board shall 
 determine who have received the highest number of votes 
 and who are thereby elected. 

Section 6. That on the second Thursday of June, after 
 the passage of this act, the board of trustees who are hereby 
 appointed, shall meet at Harrisburg, and proceed to the or- 
 ganization of the institution and selection of the most eligi- 
 ble site within the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for its 
 location, where they shall purchase or obtain by will, grant 
 or otherwise, a tract of land containing at least two hundred 
 and not exceeding two thousand acres, upon which they 
 shall procure such improvements and alterations to be made, 
 as will make it an institution properly adapted to the in- 
 struction of youth in the art of farming, according to the 
 meaning and design of this act; they shall select and choose 
 a principal for the said institution, who, with such scientific 
 attainments and capacity to teach as the board shall deem 
 necessary, shall be a good practical farmer; he, with such 
 other persons as shall from time to time be employed as 
 teachers, shall compose the faculty, under whose control the 
 immediate management of the institution and the instruction 
 of all the youth committed to its care shall be; subject, how- 
 ever, to the revision and all orders of the board of trustees ; 
 there shall be a quarterly meeting of the board of trustees 
 at the institution, and as much oftener as shall be necessary, 
 and they shall determine; the board shall have power to 
 pass all such by-laws, ordinances and rules, as the good 
 government of the institution shall require, and therein to 
 prescribe what shall be taught to, and what labor performed 
 by the pupils, and generally to do and perform all such ad- 
 ministrative acts as are usually performed by and within 
 the appropiate duty of a board of trustees, and shall, by a 
 secretary of their appointment, keep a minute of the pro- 
 ceedings and action of the board. 

Section 7. That it shall be the duty of the board of trus- 
 tees, as soon and as often as the exigencies of the institution 
 shall require, in addition to the principal, to employ such 
 other professors, teachers or tutors, as shall be qualified to 
 impart to pupils under their charge, a knowledge of the 
 English language, grammar, geography, history, mathemat- 
 ics, chemistry, and such other branches of the natural and 
 exact sciences as will conduce to the proper education of a 
 farmer; the pupils shall themselves, at such proper times 
 and seasons as shall be prescribed by the board of trustees, 
 perform all the labor necessary in the cultivation of the 
 farm, and shall thus be instructed and taught all things 
 necessary to be known by a farmer, it being the design and 
 intention of this law to establish an institution in which 
 youth may be so educated as to fit them for the occupation 
 of a farmer. 

Section 8. That the board of trustees shall annually elect 
 a treasurer, who shall receive and disburse the funds of the 
 institution and perform such other duties as shall be required 
 of him, and from whom they shall take such security for the 
 faithful performance of his duty as necessity shall require ; 
 and it shall be the duty of the said board of trustees annu- 
 ally on, or before the first of December, to make out a full 
 and detailed account of the operations of the institution for 
 the preceding year, and an account of all its receipts and 
 disbursements, and report the same to the Pennsylvania 
 State Agricultural Society, who shall embody said report in 
 the annual report, which, by existing laws, the said society 

is bound to make and transmit to the Legislature on, or 
 before the first Monday of January of each and every year. 

Section 9. That it shall be lawful for the Pennsylvania 
 State Agricultural Society to appropriate out of its funds to 
 the object of this act, any sum not exceeding ton thousand 
 dollars, whenever the same shall be required, and to make 
 such further appropriation annually out of their funds as 
 will aid in the prosecution of this object, and it shall be 
 the duty and privilege of the said society, at such times a* 
 they shall deem expedient, by their committees, officers or 
 otherwise, to visit the said institution and examine into the 
 details of its management. 

Section 10. That the act to incorporate the Farmers' 
 High School of Pennsylvania, approved tho thirteenth day 
 of April, Anno Domini, one thousand eight hundred and 
 fifty four, bo, and the same is hereby repealed. 

Cutting Briars and Bushes. 

Me. Darlington : — Enclosed I send you one dollar — an- 
 other year's subscription for the Farm Journal. I will also 
 take this opportunity of requesting you to enquire through 
 your Journal, whether any of your subscribers have experi- 
 mented on the cutting of briars and bushes in the dark of 
 the August moon and sign of the lion. I believe it was 
 suggested by a correspondent a couple of years ago, when 
 the subject was spiritedly discussed by both male and fe- 
 male writers, through your Journal, and it was proposed 
 to settle the matter by actual experiment. I have been 
 waiting patiently to hear the result, but nothing has ap- 
 peared yet, that I have seen. I think time enough has 
 elapsed to show something. It is true that each one might 
 experiment for himself, but the affirmative of these ques- 
 tions has been held by many old and experienced persons, 
 as has also the negative, and I hope they have not ended in 
 loud talk and nothing more. A number, certainly, have 
 been making trials, and if we wish to have those questions de- 
 cided in a true philosophic manner, as they should be, let us 
 have the results of any experiments made on them. I felt quite 
 interested in the contest when it was going on, and I should 
 like much to learn the results. If the affirmative is true, 
 practicing accordingly would be of very great advantage to 
 the community ; if not true, then we could go on with our 
 work without any doubts that we might be doing it in wrong 
 season. At tho time recommended I cut several patches of 
 blackberry, sumac and other bushes. I have observed that 
 some did not grow at all, and that those that did have not 
 made much progress, but appear to be rather sickly — wheth- 
 er the cause is the time of cutting, or the very dry summers 
 that we have had, or both, I do not know. 

Will you please endeavor to keep us posted up as to the 
 advantages of the system of subsoiling? If it is of any ad- 
 vantage, I should suppose that it would speak a plain tale 
 this last summer; if of no marked benefit, those of us who 
 are not yet into it had better of course remain where we 
 are. Yours, HUGH HAMILTON.

The above was intended for our February number, but 
 was crowded out at a late hour. We confess we have no 
 belief in the signs of the moon, but have great faith in the 
 efficacy of the season — the hottest and dryest period of 
 summer for preventing bushes, &c, sprouting after cutting.
