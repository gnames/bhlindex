ii"wly inveuted agricultural implements, although a little 
 out of season, I wish to say something about Allen's mow- 
 ing machiDO. This I am induced to do on account of your 
 correspondent from Honeybrook,(P. Darupman) giving such 
 a glowing inscription of the performance of Allen's mower, 
 made by L;e, Peirce & Thompson. He says in October No. 
 ol the Joui nal, that he used one last harvest, which cut bet- 
 terthan can be done with the scythe; that he cut from eight 
 to ten acre* per day, and if it was pushed a little it would 
 go fifteen ; that it had no sido-draft, and is about as hard 
 for the team as plowing stubble ground ; and the hundreds 
 w'\o came to see it were all pleased, and found no fault with 
 it*: performance, &c, &c. 

Now, had I not already owned one of Allen's mowers 
 made by the firm above spoken of, I should have been in- 
 duced (by his description) to have gone at once and ordered 
 a machine, for fear in the rush I might be too late to get one 
 ready before another harvest would be over. 

We commenced mowing with the machine around a five 
 acre lot, wiih two ordinary horses, a young man to manage 
 thj machine and team, and a boy to throw away the cut 
 grass when it is so heavy as to be in the way of the machine 
 passing over. We were a good part of four days getting it 
 out, and had to go to the blacksmith's nine times to get the 
 knives mended; a man part of the time occupied in cutting 
 out the fence corners and around the corners of the field 
 where it was difficult to operato with a machine. The field 
 had been plowed twice for wheat, harrowed as usual and 
 drilled, and stone picked for mowing with the scythe; it 
 wa -6 the first season in grass. Our next trial was in a larger 
 field that had been mowed the year before; this worked 
 rather bettor, but the knives frequently broko loose and 
 caused much hinderance. The machine runs quito hard for 
 two horses, as is well known, and of the dozen, not hundreds, 
 that came to see it all had some fault to find with it : — it run 
 too hard, bioke too easily, would not cut clean at the cor- 
 ners without too much trouble, would not back, and had the 
 drat't too much to one side, the screw burs would get loose 
 too easily, <&c, <!bc. 

Our Hone} brook friend must have very hard kind of stub- 
 ble ground, if it plows as hard for two horses as mowing 
 with Allen's mower, as some in these parts put three horses 
 to the mowev, but can readily plow stubble with two, and I 
 think the machine would not only have to be pushed a little, 
 but pulled pretty hard and fast also, to cut 15 acres in a day. 
 While I have my hand in, I will say a word about the 
 Lime Spreaders that are puffed and bio wed about as supe- 
 rior labor-sa\ ing machines, and awarded premiums by com- 
 mittoes who never saw them perform. I was induced by 
 such influence to buy one, with which I tried to spread lime 
 last spring, I ut failed to do any good with it. I concluded 
 it was too we u for that kind of a machine and took the old 
 fashioned shovel. After harvest one of my neighbors who 
 had 1 000 bushels of limo in heaps, got my machine to spread 
 it wilh, thinking surely it would not be too wet at the end 
 of a dry summer, although there had been a shower lately. 
 I sent a hand along who had been instructed (as we thought) 
 in the mysteries of lime-spreading; two or three hands work- 
 ed, trying to spread for a half a day, when the machine 
 was sont homo, and one of another patent (celebrated for 
 spreading wet lime) procured, and my neighbor, after loos- 
 ing another half day with his hands, sent that machine 
 home also and spread his limo with a shovel. 

As we too ol ten see exaggerated accounts of the wonder- 
 ful peiformanco of machinery of different kinds, in our ag- 
 ricultural and olhor papers, I think to keep the unsuspecting 
 farmer frombehig imposed upon, it would be well to publish 
 also, some of the unsuccessful experiments and failures.

Our friend has certainly been unfortunate in his purcha- 
 ses. His mower appears to have been imperfectly made — • 
 indeed, the demand was so great that we have frequently 
 wondered there were not more complaints. Any machine to 
 work well, must work with precision ; and we trust the 
 manufacturers having more time to perfect their machines, 
 will profit by the past. 

Address. 

Mr. Editor : — The following address was read before tl e 
 Farmer's Club of York Township, Northampton county.' 
 The subject, — "Will the Improvement of the Parmer's mind 
 tend to the improvement of his soil," — is very ably handled, 
 and worthy to be preserved in your pages for future reading. 
 By a proper improvement of the mind, we mean, in this 
 case, the acquirement of such knowledge as will better en- 
 able the farmer to understand, and prosecute the business of 
 his profession, — knowledge, which shall bear the same rela- 
 tion to his vocation, as that whieh is possessed by the Law- 
 yers, the Physicians, the Ministers, the Merchants, and the 
 Mechanics, bears to their pursuits. 

The idea, we trust, is not now very extensively held, that 
 little or no intelligence is necessary to direct rightly the 
 operations of agriculture ; though we fear the supposition 
 is too frequently indulged, that the circumstances in which 
 farmers are placed are unfavorable to mental energy and 
 the culture of the mind. It is admitted that severe bodily 
 labor is prejudicial to the energies of the mental faculties; 
 but we are confident that the organs of both mind and body, 
 are developed and strengthened by a due degree of muscular 
 exercise. Hence the circumstances best calculated to im- 
 prove the condition of the farmer, are those which call into 
 proper action the intellectual and physical powers with 
 which he is naturally endowed. 

But there are now, fortunately, many farmers in our coun 
 try whose labors are not so constant as to interfere will* 
 the improvement of their minds ; many, indeed, are thinking 
 and reading men; and we are forced to conclude, that it is 
 more from lack of inclination, than the existence of real 
 obstacles, that the class is not more numerous. The long 
 winter evenings and stormy days afford many hours of lei- 
 sure, during which a great amount of useful information 
 might be gathered. 

We have spoken of that kind of knowledge, which is to 
 assist the farmer in his business ; and the question naturally 
 arises, how can this knowledge be most readily obtained ? 
 We answer, by observation, by conversation, and by the read- 
 ing of agricultural papers from the different parts of our 
 country. 

But while we would urge the importance of inquiring, we 
 would by no means advise a credulous assent to every story 
 which may be heard or read. The mind of the farmer 
 should be so enlightened, that he may be capable of judging 
 for himself. It is only by observation, by reading, study, 
 comparison, and reflection, that this important faculty of 
 discrimination can be acquired. 

It is often said of farming, "yes, it is a very fine thing 
 to write about, and talk about, but when it comes to the la- 
 bor of it, it is a great deal of hard work for a very little 
 money." No doubt, as farming is generally conducted, thil 
 is a truth — but are there not disadvantages connected with 
 the pursuit of agriculture, as it has been followed in times 
 past, and at the present day, which would operate as strongly 
 against the profits of any other occupation, as it has done 
 against agriculture. 

The improvement, which has been made in farming, with- 
 in the last few years, or rather this improvement, so far as
