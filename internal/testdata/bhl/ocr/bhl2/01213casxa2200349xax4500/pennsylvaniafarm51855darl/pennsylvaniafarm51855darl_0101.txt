THE FARM JOURNAL.

the more intelligent portion of farmers is concerned, is 
 graphically and truly described; the contrast of our best ag- 
 ricultural districts, with what they were in past years, is 
 worthy of contemplation. 

Relying on the earth, which ever yields measurably to 
 the rudest cultivation, the farmer joggs on in the track of 
 his fathers, trusting Providence for seed-time and harvest. 

Every other occupation, followed with as little disposition 
 to improve, would bankrupt all who relied upon it for sub- 
 sistence ; the impression has been with all, and quite as 
 much with farmers as others, that it required little or no 
 brains to be a 'farmer; law, divinity, medicine, trade — any 
 vocation, other than agriculture, required mind and thought, 
 enlarged and cultivated. 

The farmers have been content to hew the wood, and draw 
 the water for the community at largo, to feed all, and pay 
 most of the taxes, to obey the laws of the country, made 
 by others, and disregarded by their authors. The farmer 
 thought himself wonderfully well paid if, on political occa- 
 sions, and at political gatherings, politicians and dema- 
 gogues classed him with the dear, dear people ; with the 
 independent yeomanry of the land, and the bulwark of the 
 nation. Politicians flatter his pride, feed his predjudices, 
 geek the farmer's vote, and get it. As farmers, we have 
 carried the burdens of the community, while others have 
 thanked God for creating so patient a class as the farmers 
 for their convenience. 

This is what the farmer has been, and what he has done, 
 and, I regret to say, it is what the farmer is yet in too many 
 instances all over the United States. This is not a flattering 
 picture, and yet such has been the position of far too many 
 of our American farmers. The time has arrived, when far- 
 mers as a class should understand their true position, and 
 should arise in their might to vindicate the dignity of their 
 profession. 

We often hear farmers complaining that their class is not 
 fairly represented in the national councils ; and these com- 
 plaints are often well founded, and who are to blame but 
 themselves, for it is through their ignorance that they are 
 made the tools and dupes of politicians. 

Gentlemen — I remember to have seen it asserted, some- 
 thing to this effect, by John Q. Adams, ''that if there was 
 one business, profession, or any other calling, that was more 
 independent than another — one that could be strictly called 
 more noble, it was Agriculture." And it was doubtless true. 
 Agriculture is the great centre around which all the other 
 occupations of society revolve. Trade, Commerce, Manu- 
 facturers, even the learned professions, owe their welfare to 
 Agriculture. Look at it from any point of view we may, 
 the farmer, simple homespun name, as that has become, 
 wields a tremenduous influence over society. Little does 
 that man who is quietly cultivating his potatoe-patch, or 
 hoeing his cornfield, think of the importance of his calling. 
 He is part of a great whole, that, to do without, would be 
 to bring dearth and famine upon the land. 

If such is agriculture, then let us hopo that the dark night 
 is passing away, and that a bright day is dawning upon us, 
 and upon our children, and let us prepare for them, at least, 
 if it be too late for us, a wider range of education, finer tastes 
 and deeper sensibilities. 

The good work has begun — there seems to be a general 
 stir upon the subject of educating the farmer — the text ought 
 to be in every man's mouth, and ways and means ought to 
 bo devised for educating the mass of farmers, and let it no 
 longer be necessary for lawyers, doctors, ministers, — any 
 body else but farmers, to deliver addresses, or make speeches 
 upon the subject of Agriculture. Let them understand their 
 own business, both theoretically and practically, and let 

them bo able to tell what they do know when it is required 
 of them. 

The farmers, from their number, hold the balance of 
 power in their hands in this country, and must continue to 
 do so for years and years to come ; educate them, and our 
 republic will stand, the model and glory of the world ; let 
 them remain ignorant and uneducated, and who shall dare 
 to solvo the enigma of the future. 

A great many people are opposed to the hard work on 
 farms, for my part I like it ; in our days, when men are turn- 
 ing and twisting, and using every subterfuge to escape from 
 labor, and live by their wits, I welcome that calling which 
 brings man to acknowledge the great law of God and of 
 nature — that of labor. Excessive labor, whether physical 
 or mental, is injurious, but rational labor is a blessing. That 
 some men do not labor enough, and others too much, is the 
 fault of a corrupt state of society, not of their occupation. 

There is one thing, against which I would caution my 
 fellow-farmers, and especially the experimental farmer, and 
 that is, never to suffer their minds to run wild, while they 
 are bestowing so much care on their farms. Depend upon 
 it, Science and Agriculture must go hand in hand ; science 
 will aid you much, and save you from much of that unre- 
 mitting, physical exertion, of which you sometimes complain. 

I shall now mention Book-Farming as a very necessary 
 thing for the successful pursuit of agriculture. Yes, book- 
 farming, that terrible bug-bear to the so-called practical 
 farmer — for notwithstanding all the attempts which have 
 been made to define book-farming, and to show that it is 
 in the main, but the gathering up of practical experience, 
 still the practical farmer, as he calls himself, flies from it as 
 the wild horse would from before the locomotive. 

I am sometimes ready to ask, were there ever men in the 
 world, savage or civilized, so blind to their true interest as 
 many of our farmers are ? Books have been written upon 
 almost all subjects — trade, commerce, manufactures, the 
 sciences, the mechanic arts, and navigation, have all come 
 in for their share ; but does the merchant, the manufac- 
 turer, the mechanic, find fault with them ? Does the navi- 
 gator, as he sails over the wide expanse of ocean, throw 
 aside the chart that was to guide him on his way, and when 
 he nears some perilous shore, some rocky coast, does he ex- 
 claim, "Charts are of no use to me, I heed them not — if there 
 are hidden rocks here, I will strike them, and by this means, 
 will discover them for myself." Suppose for a moment, that 
 something too theoretical has been advanced, something that 
 practice will not bear out, — is it the right way to correct tho 
 error to turn one's back upon every thing that has ever 
 been written, to pronounce it all bad and dangerous, and to 
 brand it with infamy? Have not wild theories been advan- 
 ced, at different times, in Philosophy, and the Sciences ? 
 How have they been corrected ? Why, simply by men rea- 
 ding them, reflecting upon them, and by the aid of their 
 intellects, working out truth from amid the mass of rubbish 
 beneath which it was buried. And so too, must the truths 
 of agriculture be worked out from the mass of rubbish 
 beneath which they are buried. 

Farmers, we are here in an age of improvement; inven- 
 tions and discoveries are crowning every art and science. 
 Shall we remain torpid, while every thing around us is 
 teeming with the impress of intellect ? Depend upon it, we 
 are but in the infancy of our occupation, so far as mind Is 
 concerned. Can any man of ordinary intelligence look 
 upon the present system of agriculture, without discovering 
 in it some of the grossest errors ? Men wonder that agri- 
 culture is not more profitable but are too indifferent to seek 
 for remedies. Let us awake from this indiffqjence — let us 
 seek and examine, let us bring hidden things to the broad
