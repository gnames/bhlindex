"As a material for rose-trellises, grape-trellises, and 
 ornamental work in gardens, I think it unequalled in 
 cheapness, durability and beauty, by any thing yet de- 
 vised. It will, without doubt, eventually be received 
 into general use, when its merits are appreciated by the 
 public." 

Figure 4 represents an elegant trellis-work for roses, 
 grapes, etc., varying in width from 16 inches to 4 feet ; 
 in mesh from 1 to 6 inches ; in wire from No. 10 to No. 
 18. The price varies according to the size of the wire 
 and mesh, and the width of the netting itself.

Rape Seed Oil.— Extracts from Report of Light House 
 Board. 
 In lS41-'42 the price of Sperm oil was $0,55 per gallon. 
 In 1847-48 do do $1.07.18 " 

In 1851-'52 do do $1.19.37 " 

In 18J3-'54 do do $1.38.75 " 

and the last purchase made by public contract for the light- 
 house establishment was at $1.58 for full-strained sperm oil. 
 The most respectable merchants and ship-owners, engaged 
 in the sperm whale fishery, are of opinion that there will be 
 a considerable advance upon the present price ($1.60 per 
 gallon) for winter oil during the present year, and that it will 
 probably be as high as $2.00 per gallon, at no distant day. 
 The rapid advance in the price of this essential article for 
 light-house purposes is said to be attributable to the limited 
 and annually diminishing supply, and to the increased de- 
 mand for it, for lubricating and manufacturing purposes in 
 this country and in Great Britian.

Numerous experiments have been made to test the practi- 
 cability of using lard oil, cotton seed oil, and some of the va- 
 rious patent oils, both animal and vegetable, in light-houses; 
 but it is believed, that with the exception of the Colza or 
 rape seed oil, none of them are suited to purposes of light- 
 house illumination. 

The light-houses and light vessels on the continent of Eu- 
 rope and in Great Britian, with few exceptions, are now 
 illuminated by the colza or rape seed oil. It has been found 
 after careful test, and by trial, to be superior in many re- 
 spects to the best sperm oil, while its cost, is only about one 
 half the present price of sperm oil. 

This valuable agricidtural product occupies an important 
 place in the economy of the farmers of France, Belgium, Hol- 
 land and many parts of Germany. It is in fact the great 
 agricultural staple of many districts, and from which the far- 
 mers derive their entire living income. 

In England this vegetable is cultivated, not so much for 
 the production of oil which it yields, as for grazing and fer- 
 tilizing purposes. In this country it is cultivated to some 
 extent for grazing and as a fertilizer of the soil. 

Among the German population of Texas, the Colza is cul- 
 tivated, and the oil expressed from its seed in sufficient quan- 
 tities to supply the domestic wants of the cultivators. 

In Mexico it has been introduced, and it is understood that 
 many villages, towns and cities, including the city of Mexico, 
 are dependant upon it for oil to light their streets and houses. 
 There is no doubt that this valuable vegetable could be 
 very successfully cultivated in nearly every portion of the 
 United States; and even at the present European price for 
 the oil, it would prove quite as remunerative as tobacco, 
 wheat, and Indian corn. 

The annual diminution in the supply of sperm oil, and the 
 increasing demand for it for mechanical purposes, would 
 seem to render it indispensable, that an article of good qual- 
 ity, and adapted to purposes of illumination, should be found 
 as a substitute for it. 

With these facts and results, it is believed, that it is only 
 necessary for the agriculturists of the country to give their 
 attention to the subject, to insure the production of an oil, 
 that will be superior to that from the sperm whalo for pur- 
 poses of illumination, and which will be highly remunerative 
 to the producer, at one half the present price of sperm oiL 

The cultivation of this vegetable on a large scale would 
 prove a great boon to the country, as well as a source of 
 profit to the producers. It would also be the means of ren- 
 dering us altogether independant of European markets, and 
 of their fluctuations, for oil for illuminating our light-house3 
 in case of a failure of the supply from the sperm whale fish- 
 ing grounds, and also in the event of the interruption of the 
 fisheries, and of commerce by war with a powerful maritime 
 State.

Should the agriculturists of this country not commence 
 the cultivation of this valuable and remunerative product, 
 and should the supply of sperm oil continue to diminish in 
 the same ratio it has done for some years past, this govern- 
 ment will be reduced to the necessity of importing rape-seed 
 oil from Europe for the light-house service. 

It is believed that this course could be advantageously 
 adopted now.

 Wheat vs. Cheat.— A Challenge. 

Turbotville, Pa., Oct. 26th, 1854. 

Francis Schriner: — Dear Sir: — Having noticed your state- 
 ment in the June No. of the Farm Journal, that you had 
 sown a patch of wheat in your garden that a "neighbor 
 had undertaken to turn to cheat," and feeling some desire to 
 know the result of the effort, I will be thankful if you will 
 inform me whether he was successful. 

If his method failed, I may be able to suggest several other 
 different methods, that I presume has been more successful 

I would not desire so liberal an offer as that of a farm 
 with stock, but if you desire to see the matter fully tested, 
 and will make a pledge not exceeding two hundred dollars, 
 to be available, provided it is successful, I will make the ex- 
 periment on a square rod of good wheat, beginning the 
 latter part of next April, and demonstrate that the thing is 
 practicable. In order to satisfy you that there will be no 
 deception, and that you shall be at no other expense on 
 account of it, I will be willing to perform the experiment for 
 you in your own neighborhood ; and when it is satisfactorily 
 accomplished, and you pay the two hundred dollars, the same 
 shall bo appropiated to the cause of Agricultural Science. 
 I have the pleasure to be yours, Very respectfully, 

H. MILLER. 

THE CHALLENGE ACCEPTED. 

Mr. Henry Miller: — Dear Sir : — Yours of the 26th Oot. 
 is received, and after deliberation, I would say, I am not in 
 the habit of betting, but upon such a subject as the Science 
 of Agriculture, I can see no harm in a mutual agreement 
 for one or the other of us to forfeit a certain sum for the 
 benefit of the Science. I will therefore accept your chal- 
 lenge, with a little alteration in the modus operandi. 

An experiment made "upon a square rod of good wheat," 
 whatever I might think of it, would not be satisfactory to 
 an incredulous public. They might not be willing to awaid. 
 to you the merit of having accomplished the proposed change.^ 
 upon the ground that they could not know what plants might 
 be growing on, or what seed lurking in, "a square rod of 
 ground," so our experiment might end just where it begins, 
 proving only, that cheat grows where wheat has been killed 
 out, which we well know. I would therefore suggest that I 
 be permitted to select a number of plants (say ten) which I
