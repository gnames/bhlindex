will be certain have sprung from good wheat, and upon 
 these I invite you to operate at any time, or at all times, be- 
 tween this and next harvest, by "freezing, drought, choking" 
 or hanging, or any other, penal or fancy process, so as to cause 
 them to produce cheat, without bringing the influence of any 
 other grain, except clean ivheat to bear upon them. For which 
 services I am ready to enter into obligations, secured by 
 real estate, to pay to the Agricultural Society of Pa., two 
 hundred dollars when the job is completed, or twenty dol- 
 lars for every plant so changed. It is as easy "for an entire 
 field of wheat to turn to cheat as a single stalk,"and vice versa. 

You will of course be expected to enter into similar obli- 
 gations, to pay the same sum for the same purpose, in case 
 of failure. This I hope will bring a fair experiment before 
 our neighbors. There must be a committee appointed to 
 watch the ten plants, and not permit any other than wheat to 
 grow near them. With much respect, Yours,

Although aware that our friends are beooniing tired of the 
 discussion of wheat and cheat, we insert the above corres- 
 pondence in the hope that it will bring the matter to a point. 
 Should Mr. Miller succeed, we will cheerfully chronicle the 
 fact, although it'be contrary to the united voice of science 

and of observation. — Ed.

Poland Oats. 

B. P. Foster, in the Michigan Farmer, says: 

I have raised the Poland oats for three years past. The 
 weather has been very dry here in that time, and from my 
 own experience, I think this kind of oats well adapted to the 
 climate of Michigan. I have tried several kinds, and these 
 have done the best of any that I have sown. 

I obtained a sample of Mr. Tucker's oats, and on compar- 
 ing them with mine, find them to be the same, and both are, 
 to all appearance, and according to the descriptions I have 
 seen, the true Poland oats. 

I will now state in what respect I consider them superior 
 to any other kinds, for this country, so far as I have tried 
 thorn. I simply give the facts : 

1st. They require less seed to the acre, as they tiller, or 
 stool, out a great deal, from five to ten stalks springing from 
 one kernel. One bushel to one and a half is enough to the 
 acre. (This year I sowed mine very thick — two bushels to 
 the acre.) 

2d. The straw is longer and stiffer, and not so liable to 

3d. They yield more, and are heavier, and better to feed. 

4th. They will produce more on poor land than any other 
 kind I ever tried. 

5th. They will stand the drouth remarkably well. 

They need not be sown early. Mine were ripe when my 
 wheat was. They were sown the first of May. 

Average Yield of Wheat in Great Britain. 
 In reply to an enquiry, the Mark Lane Express says : — 
 "The average of the three Scotch counties last year per aore 
 stands thus : 

Roxburgshire, 22 bushels. 

Haddington, 26 " 

Sutherland, 32 " 

giving a general average of abour 26 bushels ; but this is 
 under ordinary years. Upon the whole our averages are ri- 
 sing — that is, they now exceed what they were a few years 
 back ; and probably 28 bushels per acre may not be far from 
 the average of England. "With regard to the average of this 
 year, opinion is so much divided that, as yet, it is hardly 
 safe to give a definite estimate, some setting it at one-fourth 
 above that of ordinary years, others at a great deal less."
