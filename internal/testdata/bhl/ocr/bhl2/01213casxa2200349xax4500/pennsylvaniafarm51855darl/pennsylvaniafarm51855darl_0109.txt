will but give this subject the attention it merits, we are 
 sure they will insert in the general appropriation bill, an 
 item of ten thousand dollars to the Farmers' High 
 School, and complete the work they have begun. This 
 sum, with a like amount to be given by the State Agri- 
 cultural Society, together with what will be added from 
 other sources, will place the institution on a solid foun- 
 dation, and go far towards insuring its success. 

, Mangold Wurzel Leaves 

I From an article in the English Agricultural Gazette, it 
 appears to not have been an uncommon practice in Eng- 
 land, to strip off successive crops of leaves of mangold 
 wurzel or sugar beet, for feeding to the cows, under an 
 impression that the roots were not materially injured. 
 We do not know that it has been done here to much ex- 
 tent, but careful experiments have now been made, 
 which prove conclusively that it is injurious in every re- 
 spect, not only to the yield per acre, but the intrinsic 
 qualities of the roots also. 

The leaves it is also found have deteriorated the qual- 
 ity of the* milk by careful analysis, and promoted diar- 
 rhaaa in the cows. 

The conclusions arrived at are, that leaves cannot be 
 systematically taken from the growing plant, without 
 lessening the quantity of roots. 2. The decreased quan- 
 tity of*roots does not yield so large a per centage of nu- 
 tritive matter, as are contained in those that are uninju- 
 red, and 3. That the injury to the roots is by no means 
 counterbalanced in quantity or quality, by any value we 
 might attach to the leaves. 

Fruit and Ornamental Trees. 

Before another number of the Journal reaches our 
 readers, the season for planting will fully have arrived, 
 and we hope every owner of an acre of land, for his own 
 pecuniary benefit, (which in some cases is the most im- 
 portant consideration,) for the benefit of those who are to 
 come after him, and for the health, comfort and enjoy- 
 ment of himself and family, which will be almost an 
 immediate result, will not forget to plant. Plant, Plant, 
 Plant, should be the one idea ever present for the next six 
 weeks. Let every fence corner, every open space, every 
 good exposure, be watched for and hunted out, where a 
 tree of some kind can be not merely stuck in, but plant- 
 ed as it should lie, and with the object of making it not 
 merely live but grow, thrive and bear fruit, or foliage for 
 ornament or use. In former numbers of the Farm Jour- 
 nal, we have treated copiously of the mode of planting, 
 and the varieties of trees best adapted for fruit and 
 ornament, &c , and as our space is too limited now to go 
 over the subject at length, we will recommend two books 
 better adapted than any two we know of, for conveying 
 all necessary information in a cheap simple form â€” Bar- 
 ry's fruit book, and Median's hand book of ornamental 
 trees. The two can be obtained for a couple of dollars, 
 and we will furaish them, or send them to any of our 
 friends who will enclose us that amount. Many, very 
 many other excellent works can be obtained, but none 
 equal to those two for condensed, practical, useful infor- 
 mation on the subjects of which they treat. 

In our present number will be found the list recom- 
 mended by the American Pomological Society, which is 

entirely reliable, as regards fruit. In respect to orna- 
 mental trees and shrubbery, there is a wide selection. 
 Of evergreen trees, first and foremost we recommend the 
 Norway Spruce, Abies cxcelsa, as being unsurpassed, 
 and perhaps unequalled as a tree for all localities. To 
 this we would add for every lawn, some White Pines, 
 (Pinus Strobus,) Hemlock (Abies Canadensis,) European 
 Silver Fir (Picea Pcctinata,) a magnificent tree, witli 
 dark rich foliage, and not half so much known as it 
 should be, aud also our Balm of Gilead or Balsam (Picea 
 Balsamea,) witli a specimen at least of Scotch and Aus- 
 trian Pines, both quite distinct in habit from either of 
 the others. These are all of large growth and size. 
 For smaller trees, which will admit of planting nearer 
 the house, purchase Abies Alba, or European Double Whi te 
 Spruce, a beautiful tree of very compact habit, and pe- 
 culiar tint, the unrivalled Deodar Cedar, Cryptomeria 
 Japonica from Japan, proved to be entirely hardy here. 
 There is nothing yet known we think to equal these 
 two last. For evergreen shrubbery, to fill jndicious- 
 ly the smaller spaces, ask at the nurseries for English 
 and Irish Yew, American Arbor Vitse, Euonymus, Amer- 
 ican, Irish and Swedish Junipers, Thuja Plicata, a very 
 beautiful species of Arbor Vita?, also Mahonia, Tree Box. 
 of which there are several species, all beautiful, and 
 American Holly. The latter is somewhat difficult to 
 plant, but is so beautiful in its green leaves and scarlet 
 berries, hanging on all winter, as to pay well for extra 
 pains and expense. 

For deciduous trees, where a shade is wanted very quick- 
 ly, nothing is so well adapted as Silver Maple, Silver 
 Poplar and Pawlonia. These are very rapid growers, 
 the Poplar however being somewhat objectionable from 
 liability to sucker. This will not interferes witli it 
 for street planting. To those, however, who can afford 
 to be somewhat patient ami wait a little longer for 
 more desirable trees, but slower growth, who will bo 
 satisfied with acquiring beautiful shade, at a pace of 
 thirty miles an hour instead of sixty, we recommend, 
 by all means, three species of Maple as not being sur- 
 passed by any other shade trees, Acer Saccharinum, 
 (Sugar Maple,) Acer Platanoides, (Norway Maple,) Acer 
 Psesudo Platanus, European Sycamore or English 
 Maple. These are all of the very first class. Add to 
 them, English Horse Chesnut, which, however, loses it? 
 leaves too soon and suffers rather much from hot weath- 
 er, and Tulip Poplar, not half so much planted as it 
 deserves, also the many beautiful species of ash, Magno- 
 lia Acuminata, Tripetala, and Macrophylla, the different 
 species of oak much undervalued and very ornamental, 
 also Tilia Americana, American Linden, Willows and 
 Deciduous Cypress, European White Birch and Larches. 
 For second size of Deciduous trees and shrubs obtain 
 Rhamnus Carolinianus, a very showy tree, also Halesia 
 or Silver Bell, Laburnum, Purple Beech, Judas trees, 
 Rhus Cotinus or Mist Bush, Chionanthus or White 
 Fringe, Dogwood, Double Flowering Apple and Cherry. 
 Virgilia Lutea, Cydonia Japonica, Deutz ia Scabra and 
 Gracilis, Wiegelia Rosea, Ribes Sanguineum, hardy at 
 Philadelphia, Lilacs, Spireas assorted a beautiful family of 
 shrubs, a continuation of bloom being kept up all summer 
 with the different species, Hydrangia Quercifolia, one of 
 our most magnificent flowei'ing shrubs, Euonymus Amer-
