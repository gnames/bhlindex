far the richest. The farm on which they were kept had 
 a very dry, sandy and gravelly soil, such as that of the 
 Pine woods in Georgia. It might be remarked that the 
 climate of Georgia is warmer than that of Switzerland. 
 I must say, thereupon, that the dairies in Lombardy and 
 Italy are always stocked with cows from Berne, which 
 thrive as well in those southern latitudes as in the cold cli- 
 mate of Denmark. The finest cattle are found in Emmen- 
 thal, Ilaslithal and Oberimthal. For more than five cen- 
 turies the Swiss have given to the raising of cattle their 
 full and whole attention, as the only source of their exis- 
 tence ; and while it can be justly said that some English 
 races are artificially good, it can be said with a certainty 
 of the Berne race that it is good from its nature, and 
 also of its continuance, which is very important for a 
 cattle raiser or dairyman. 

"For fifteen years I have examined from 200 to 300 
 Bernese cows, and am, therefore, so convinced of their 
 preference to all other races for Georgia, that I will be 
 glad if any body will send me more information from 
 certain sources, as it will show I have not said too much 
 in their favor ; .and although I am well acquainted with 
 all the other races of the continent of Europe, still I 
 would not recommend them for Georgia, as they are not 
 suitable for us." 

Thus far what is said of the Swiss race is true with 
 regard to their milk giving, and the good quality of their 
 meat ; but the males or oxen of the same race are unfit 
 for beasts of labor, being too slow and indolent in their 
 nature, which is derived from their nervous constitution 
 as well as their conformation. 

Their height is about four feet ten inches to five feet 
 in the two sexes ; the males and females do not differ in 
 the size of their bodies ; they weigh not less than 1000 
 to 1200 lbs. each ; the skin is mottled with black, white 
 and red, the latter usually predominating on all parts 
 of the body, except the head, which is generally white ; 
 this part is short and large ; the cleft is thick and large; 
 the dewlap is loose and hangs low; the body is massive ; 
 the belly very large ; the head of the tail very high ; the 
 extremeties and the hoofs particularly do not show a 
 conformation and strength to support easily such a 
 heavy mass, which imparts to them a slow motion, badly 
 fitting them for work. The cows have enormous udders, 
 out of which commonly flow from twenty-four to thirty 
 quarts of milk per day. This race, however, are great 
 consumers ; habituated to the luxuriant Swiss vallies, 
 they cannot be maintained but on rich pastures, or sta- 
 bled with abundant fodder. F. A. N.

 Compost. 
 A few years ago I had a quantity of rough straw ma- 
 nure in my barn-yard, and having no ground upon which 
 I cared to put such stuff, I thought I would try an ex- 
 periment with it. The first thing I did was to plow a 
 few shallow furrows in a good sod on the side of a road 
 in a lane. I then had a load of this barn-yard litter 
 brought and thrown down on the sod where it had not 
 been plowed, and spread to an extent of about ten by 
 twenty feet. We next brought a load of lime, and 
 spread it all over the manure ; and while the wagon 

went for another load of manure, we covered the lime 
 with a layer of sods, perhaps to the amount of a wagon 
 load. Thus we went on with as many covers of manure, 
 lime and sods, as we could heap on, and finished by cov- 
 ering all over with loose soil. We then made another 
 similar heap, which used up all our materials. 

This was done in May or June. The following April 
 we opened our compost heaps. The whole mass was 
 like bone ashes, and in the cavities, the niti*e evolved in 
 the process of decomposition was deposited or precipi- 
 tated in great abundance, and had the appearance of 
 heavy white frost. We spread it at about the rate of 
 two hundred bushels to the acre on a piece of ground 
 that had been severely cropped for thirty or forty years 
 without manure, plowed it in, and planted corn. It 
 yielded fully one hundred bushels of ears to the acre, 
 and subsequent crops have abundantly attested the value 
 of that manure. The decomposition appeared to be 
 perfect, and at the same time the volatile salts (the most 
 valuable part) were absorbed or condensed by the earthy 
 matters, with which the animal and vegetable ingredi- 
 ents of the mass were incorporated. 

Muck or swamp mud would be better than sods where 
 it can be obtained. In the compost of which I have 
 spoken, the lime did not form more than one-fourth of 
 the weight of the masses — in bulk much less. It was 
 fresh, and for several days the heaps were warm and 
 sent off a little steam. J. C.

Rape. 

J. Lacey Darlington : — In the last two numbers of 
 the Farm Journal, I observe a communication concern- . 
 ing "Rape," signed F. N. Nauts, which holds out strong* 
 inducements for farmers to engage in its cultivation. 
 According to his statements, seventy dollars an acre can 
 be realized even from a minimum crop. That will do 
 very well, even at the present time, when corn and wheat 
 command such high prices ; and if the crop of rape should 
 be a good one, the proceeds would be double that amount. 

A communication from the same correspondent ap- 
 peared in the July number of 1853 of a similar charac- 
 ter, and I have been looking for some account of the ex- 
 perience of those who were induced to go into the busi- 
 ness of raising rape ; but as none has appeared, I offer 
 the following relation of a very small experiment made 
 by myself. 

In the spring of 1853, I received a package of seeds 
 from the Patent Office, and in it was a paper of rape 
 seed. The seed was planted carefully some time in . 
 June, and not long afterwards the communication above 
 referred to appeared, which induced me to bestow extra 
 care on my rape patch. It came up and grew luxu- 
 riantly, and in the fall a piece of ground was prepared, 
 and a large portion of the plants were transplanted ac- 
 cording to directions, and some were left standing where 
 the seed was sown. Although the weather was dry, the 
 moved plants took root and grew, and as every thing in 
 the experiment thus far appeared so favorable, I began to 
 indulge in rather extravagant dreams about the money 1 
 should make in raising rape; in fact quite an air castle 
 was erected. 

The winter passed ; and in the spring I went to look
