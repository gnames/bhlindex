Col. Ware's Cotswold Sheep. 

Having heard much of the celebrated flock of improved 
 Cotswold Sheep of Col. Ware, of Clarke county, (Va.,) 
 we asked him for some account of them. In connection 
 with his answer which we publish below, he sent us 
 some beautiful specimens of wool, and a printed circu- 
 lar, from which we learn he has added to his flock for 
 six or eight years past, by annual importations of the 
 best to be procured in England, obtaining in several in- 
 stances, animals which had received the first prizes at 
 the exhibition of the Royal Agricultural Society: 

Luther Tucker, Esq. : — In compliance with your re- 
 quest, I send you this notice of my sheep . I had a flock 
 of good sheep, but found, besides the fleece, each sheep 
 at 4 years old on grass, would not command more than 
 $2.50 — the best, fed on grain in the winter, would bring 
 over $4.00. To supply a butcher each year a lot of 
 fat sheep of a farmer's own raising, would require him 
 to keep 4 lots on hand to sell one, the fleece but little 
 more than paying for the keep. To rely npon a fleece 
 alone for profit was too insignificant a matter. At the 
 highest price per lb. given in the U. S., it would require 
 too many sheep to make a small sum of money. Not 
 being satisfied with this state of things, I determined to 
 purchase some of the large mutton sheep of England, 
 the improved Cotswold, and try what_ could be done with 
 them ; and as independent of the pride, I believe it the 
 true policy to have the best as it soonest returns the 
 outlay, I imported, and I do import each year winners of 
 the high prizes of the Royal Ag. Society of England. If 
 they beat England, I must surely have the purest breed 
 and best. 

I soon found, after putting 3 crosses of my imported 
 bucks on my ordinary flock, that the fleece greatly in- 
 creased in weight, and sold for as much per lb. as the 
 fleece of the ordinary sheep, and I sold the mutton from 
 these crosses (not thorough bred) without difficulty, the 
 fall after one year old, for $10 each on the farm, so that 
 I sell out clean every year, keeping none over the win- 
 ter but the breeding ewes and the lambs of the same 
 spring. 

You will see from my circular sent you by remarks of 
 others about my sheep, that I have sold some mutton for 
 $35 and $25 each, and you will see from the no. of lbs. 
 of washed wool to the fleece, that we make more money 

to the fleece than any other breed. I send you samples 
 of wool — the longest is from a fleece of 18| lb. — the 
 next 17| — the next 16 — the next 14, the growth being 
 from the shearing of 1853 to that of 1854. All is not 
 so long. I have had it longer. I always wash my sheep 
 before shearing, but admit that the flock from raising 
 lambs and losing some wool, avei'age only 6 lbs. washed. 
 We never sell under 30 cents per lb. and sometimes get 
 40, and you will see we still make as much money or 
 more to the fleece than, any other breed. Selling out 
 clean every year enables. .bs to keep all our sheep of the 
 most profitable size — ewesf-that bring us- lambs every 
 year (and being prolific mostly bring twins and wool 
 too). We are never overstocked. The butcher is al- 
 ways ready for the overplus. 

I consider the improved Cotswold the most profitable 
 sheep for general farming purposes (wool and mutton), 
 for while I formerly sold one mutton 4 years old for 
 $2.50 on grass, and $4 on grain in the winter, in the 
 same time, besides getting more money for fleece, I sell 
 4 of this breed for $40 ; and that profit is in that pro- 
 portion, allowing that each bring the same no. of lambs,* 
 for I never sell one of them the fall after one year old 
 for less than $10 each, part bred at that — butchers have 
 offered $6 and $8 cash for some lambs and been refused. 
 The thorough bred are too much in demand, and too 
 costly to alter. 

Seeing these results, naturally the farmers in this sec- 
 tion have occasionally procured of me rams, and im- 
 proved their flock, until this little county of Clarke that 
 I live in, has now a reputation probably unequalled by 
 any State in the Union. Is it not the true policy of the 
 farmer to keep that breed which will produce the great- 
 est amount of money from the smallest number ? It is 
 not unusual in this county, for a flock of from 40 to 50 
 ewes, part bred, to yield in mutton and wool each year 
 from $500 to $650. 

I know it is a theory with some that these large sheep 
 require more food to sustain them than the small breed. 
 Some say double. My experience is the reverse. I 
 cannot, nor can any person else, form any correct idea 
 of the fact on grass, but nearly correct conclusions can 
 be arrived at when you feed them on grain for the 
 butcher. In this way I have tested it. I have, begin- 
 ning at the same time, fed a lot of ordinary sheep 4 
 years old, the pick of 700 good ones, and a lot of year- 
 ling Cotswolds, the same number in adjoining fields, the 
 most indifferent field to the Cotswold— the same amount 
 fed at the same time to each lot. The former always 
 eat up dean, and wanted more ; the latter always left 
 some, and were sold January 1st, rolling fat, for $10 
 each ; the former not until some time in March ; then 
 with difficulty and grumbling by the butcher for $4 
 each, having the advantage of the others also in age. I 
 have come to the conclusion that at least 2 (I believe 3) 
 Cotswolds, even yearlings, can be fattened well for the 
 butcher on the grain it takes to fatten one of the others 
 of any age. The Cotswolds have great propensity to 
 take on fat, are always mutton. Indeed you cannot lay 
 the fat on any other, as you can on them. It is their 
 nature. All others travel a great deal, and ramble off 
 their food. The Cotswolds are heavy, sluggish sheep, 
 fill themselves and lay down and ruminate like cattle,
