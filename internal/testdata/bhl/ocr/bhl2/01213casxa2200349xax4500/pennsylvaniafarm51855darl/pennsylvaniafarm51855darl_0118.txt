site for a protective hedge. In our present number will 
 be found some practical remarks on the Osage Orange 
 by Dr. Warder, before the Philadelphia Society for Pro- 
 moting Agriculture. The experience in the region of 
 country around Cincinnati and west of it, where hun- 
 dreds of miles have been planted successfully, entitle his 
 remarks to great attention. We do not see why every 
 hundred acre farm should not have an Osage Orange 
 hedge on all its outside boundaries, especially along 
 roads. The first cost and subsequent contingent expen- 
 ses of ordinary fencing have been so long considered 
 among the necessary expenditures of the farm, that we 
 lose sight of the enormous outlay they require. Esti- 
 mating a hundred acre farm to be divided into ten fields, 
 each enclosure would require about one hundred and 
 seventy-five panels, which, at eighty cents per panel (a 
 moderate estimate), amounts to one hundred and forty 
 dollars, on which the yearly interest is eight dollars 
 and forty cents, or about eighty-four dollars on the 
 farm. On an average of from twenty to thirty years 
 this fence would require renewal, at a cost of one 

thousand four hundred dollars. This is money posi- 
 tively sunk, to the owner of the land and the country,, 
 to say nothing of the time and expense of repairs. 
 Nicholas Piddle once remarked that the cost of fencing 
 in Pennsylvania was sufficient to pay the State debt — 
 forty millions. 

In the rich land and deep soils of the west, Osage 
 Orange hedge Will grow large enough for protection in 
 three to four years ; here more time will be required, 
 but depending much on the manner of planting and 
 management. Plants one and two years old can be 
 bought at the nurseries at from $6 to $10 per thousand, 
 and the seed at about $1.50 per lb. — a pound will con- 
 tain some thousands of seeds. 

In the third volume of the Farm Journal, page 216, 
 our readers will find minute information about the man- 
 agement, planting, &c, of Osage Orange, with an en- 
 graving representing the proper mode of trimming, &c, 
 and we recommend the subject to their earnest atten- 
 tion. In our advertising pages will be found proposals 
 for planting and setting the hedge. 

WAKEFIELD'S HAND 

This implement is designed for planting corn, broom 
 corn seeds, beans and similar seeds. It is carried and 
 used (as represented in the above engraving) as a cane 
 or walking-stick ; requiring no delay and no additional 
 motion or effort. Is adapted for planting in rocky and 
 uneven ground, and in all kinds of soil, is easily ad- 
 justed to plant at any desired depth, and to drop any re- 
 quired number of seeds in a hill. 

We have not had an opportunity of witnessing the 
 ■©peration of this machine in the field, but judging from 
 a somewhat minute examination of its parts, we can see 
 2io reason why it should not do all that is claimed by the

"The method or mode by which the seed is planted 
 with this planter is new, and it is believed possesses ad- 
 vantages over every other, not only in facility of use but 
 in hastening germination. The seed is forced by pres- 
 sure obliquely from the surface of the ground to the 
 required depth, thus ensuring the immediate absorption 
 of moisture, by bringing it into perfect and hard contact 
 with the soil under and around it, while the earth fall- 
 ing loosely over, cannot obstruct the coming up and 
 growth of the blade.
