EXPANDING AND REVERSIBLE HARROW. 

Many of our readers are doubtless familiar with the 
 harrow represented in the above engraving, but as others 
 may never have seen it, we thought best to introduce it 
 at this season, when such implements are most in re- 
 quest. 

As will be seen at a glance, this harrow is so con- 
 structed as to be widened or narrowed at pleasure, so as 
 to do coarser or finer work, by shortening or lengthen- 
 ing the chain on the top. 

BENEFIT OF DRAINING. 

The above engravings represent the three varieties of 
 draining tile in most request. In order to show what has 
 been done by these tile, &c, we copy the following letter 
 from a printed pamphlet, which has lately been handed 
 us, on the benefits of land-drainage, by John S. Hilles. 

He has commenced the manufacture of draining tile, 
 at Wilmington, Delaware, and will shortly be able to 
 supply all the different varieties of Sole, Pipe, and Horse 
 Shoe Tile, as stated in his advertisement on our cover. 

The pamphlet states that samples of his manufacture 
 may be seen at P. Morris & Co's Agricultural Warehouse, 
 Seventh and Market streets, Philadelphia, who are agents 
 for the sale. He has issued a large number of the pam- 
 phlets for distribution, containing the most satisfactory 
 references, as to the use of the tile, and also numerous 
 cases similar to the letter below, of the satisfatory results 
 of draining. The subject is one of great importance. 

It will be observed that C. P. Williams' land was not 
 springy, but the clayey substratum prevented the surface 
 water from passing off, and retained it to the great inju- 
 ry about the roots of plants. How much of this kind of 
 land there is in this State, which would be equally 
 benefited in addition to others decidedly wet from springs. 
 We anticipate a large demand for the tile in this section 
 of Pennsylvania, as it has heretofore been impossible to 
 obtain it, except at expensive carriage from a distance. 
 Albany, Dec. 25, 1852. 

A. S. Babcock, Esq. — Dear Sir: — In May, 1851, I 
 came in posession of a lot of ground of two acres in the 
 suburbs of the city, The soil is a clayey loam ; the sub- 
 soil stiff clay and quite retentive of water. The neigh- 
 bors who were acquainted with the ground, told me it 
 was a cold piece of ground, could not be made to produce 
 anything but grass; and that a market gardener who had 
 attempted to work the ground adjoining, precisely like 
 this, had been almost broken down by it, and was obliged 
 to quit. 

I was desirous to put the ground in good order for a 
 fruit garden, and nursery purposes, and concluded that 
 draining was what it needed as the first step towards 
 improvement. A practiced English drainer was engaged 
 and the whole piece thoroughly drained with your tile, 
 drains laid twenty-one feet apart and two and one-half 
 to three feet deep at an expense of some $50 per acre. 
 I then had the ground plowed three times, at intervals 
 of three or four weeks; and at each time well subsoiled 
 with the subsoil plow, thus breaking up the subsoil 
 pretty thoroughly to the depth of eighteen or twenty 
 inches. At the last plowing, the land was dressed with 
 about twenty loads to the acre of stable manure. 

Last spring, (1852,) the whole ground was planted 
 with seedling trees for propagating, in rows three and 
 one-half feet apart. After planting the trees, I had on- 
 ions sowed — a single row between the rows of trees on 
 about one-third of the ground; beets in the came manner 
 on about another third; and carrots on about one-fifth, 
 and on the remainder nothing but the trees. The ordi- 
 nary mishaps followed — perhaps rather more than ordi- 
 nary. The wire-worm took a large part of the onions 
 clean, soon after they came up, and left but now and
