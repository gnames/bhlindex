loosened, from the depth of from two to ten inches, 
 which loosening may be supposed to regulate the depth 
 to which they will be likely to sink. The wheel and its 
 accompaniments being of considerable weight, great mus- 
 cular exertion would be required of the attendant to 
 prevent its falling on one side, but for a simple and very 
 effectual provision for its support. The stout iron shaft 
 on which the main wheel revolves, is prolonged some two 
 or three feet on each side and provided with a light car- 
 rying wheel mounted loose, as in a common carriage axle, 
 to run upon the ground. These wheels are to maintain 
 the upright position of the machine; but the weight 
 must, at all times, when in operation, be allowed to rest 
 upon the diggers. In short, the main wheel and the 
 whole machine must be allowed to sink down into a ditch 
 or rise to the surface, while the carrying wheels simply 
 run lightly on the surface at the sides. This end is ac- 
 complished by bending the axle into the form of a large 
 crank at each side and releasing it from all connection 
 with the machine, except that of passing loosely through 
 the centre. A catch is provided by which the atten- 
 dant (who is supposed to be grasping a pair of handles 
 in the rear) may make the connection a fixed one at 
 pleasure, and when desiring to leave the field and travel 
 the road the weight may by this means be thrown entire- 
 ly upon the carrying wheels. — iV. Y. Tribune. 

Currants. 
 The fruit of the currant is universally admired. Its 
 pleasant sub-acid flavor renders it peculiarly excellent 
 in tarts and pies, and makes, with a small addition of 
 sugar, a very desirable substitute for apple sauce. 
 From -the ripe fruit an excellent and cheap wine may be 
 manufactured, either with or without alcoholic proper- 
 ties. No fruit is susceptible of more easy cultivation. 
 It will readily adapt itself, in some degree, to every de- 
 scription of soil, and may, without much trouble, be 
 made to produce, even prodigiously, on those which are 
 constitutionally moist and wet. In cultivating it, how- 
 ever, it is better to adapt the soil to the plant, rather 
 than endeavor, by forced efforts, to adapt the plant to 
 the soil. Acclimatory changes are generally slow, and 
 have a decided tendency to destroy the strength and 
 hardihood, as well as the prolific power of all plants. 
 Yet circumstances, as well as the capriciousness of taste, 
 often demand this. — N. E< Farmer. 

The Apiary. 

Its Location. — In the location of the apiary, one im- 
 portant consideration is that it is convenient to watch in 
 the swarming season; that the bees may be seen at any 
 time from the door or window, when a swarm rises, with- 
 out the trouble of taking many steps to accomplish it; 
 because if much trouble is to be taken, it is too often 
 neglected. Also, if possible, the hives should stand 
 where the wind will have but little effect, especially from 
 the northwest. If no hills or building offer a protection, 
 a close, high board fence should be put up for the pur- 
 pose. It is economy to do itr-^-bees enough may be saved 
 to pay the expense. During the first spring months, 
 the stocks contain fewer bees than at any other season. 
 It is then that a numerous' family is important, for the 
 purpose of creating animal heat to rear the brood, if for 

nothing else. One bee is of more consequence now than 
 a half dozen in midsummer. When the hive stands in a 
 bleak place, the bees returning with heavy loads, in a 
 high wind, are frequently unable to strike the hive, and 
 are blown to the ground, become chilled and die. A 
 chilly south wind is equally fatal, but not so frequent. 
 When protected from winds, the hives may front any 
 point you choose; east or south is generally preferred. 
 A location near ponds, lakes, large rivers, &c, will be 
 attended with some loss. Hard winds will fatigue 'the 
 bees when on the wing, often causing them to fall in 
 the water; where it is impossible to rise again until waf- 
 ted ashore, and then, unless in very warm weather, they 
 are so chilled as to be past the effort. I do not mention 
 this to discourage any one from keeping them, when so 
 situated, because some few must keep them thus or not 
 at all. I am so situated myself. There is a pond of 
 four acres, some twelve rods off. In spring, during high 
 winds, a great many may be found drowned, and driven 
 on shore. Although we cannot miss so few from a stock, 
 it is nevertheless a loss as far as it goes. 

Decide Early. — Whatever location is chosen, it should 
 be decided upon as early as possible; because, when the 
 chilling winds of winter have ceased for a day, and the 
 sun, unobstructed, is sending his first warm rays to a 
 frozen earth, the bees that have been inactive for months 
 feel the cheering influence, and come forth to enjoy the 
 balmy air. As they come from their door, they pause a 
 moment to rub their eyes, which have long been obscured 
 in darkness. 

Bees Mark their Location on Leaving the Hive. — 
 They rise on the wing, but do not leave in a direct line, 
 but immediately turn their heads towards the entrance 
 of their tenement, describing a circle of only a few inch- 
 es at first, but enlarge as they recede, until an area of 
 several rods have been viewed and marked. 

Changing Stand Attended with Loss. — After a few 
 excursions, when surrounding objects have become fa- 
 miliar, this precaution is not taken, and they leave in a 
 direct line for their destination, and return by their way- 
 marks without difficulty. Man with his reason is guided 
 on the same principles. There are a great many people 
 who suppose the bee knows its hive by a kind of in- 
 stinct, or is attracted towards it, like the steel to the 
 magnet. At least, they act as if they did ; as they move 
 their bees a few rods, or feet, after the location is thus 
 marked, and what is the consequence? The stocks are 
 materially injured by the loss of bees, and sometimes en- 
 tirely ruined. Let us trace the cause. As I remarked, 
 the bees have marked the location. They leave the hive 
 without any precaution, as surrounding objects are fa- 
 miliar. They return to their old stand and find no home. 
 If there is more than one stock, and the removal has 
 been from four to twenty feet, some of the bees may find 
 a hive, but just as liable to enter the wrong one as the 
 right. Probably they would not go over twenty feet, 
 and very likely not that, unless the new situation was 
 very conspicuous. If a person had but one stock, very 
 likely the loss would be less, as every bee finding a hive, 
 would be sure to be home, and none killed, as is gene- 
 rally the case when a few enter a strange hive. — M. 
 Quinby.
