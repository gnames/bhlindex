[April 

ticularly in the tender issues of the new wood, where warts 
 are most commonly developed. 

From experiments made upon my own trees, I have rea- 
 son to believe that the growth of these tumors may, in great 
 measure, be prevented by severe root-pruning, stimulating 
 the bark in the spring, or before the buds expand, by wash- 
 ing it with soft soap, and by cutting off the warts as soon as 
 formed, and applying salt or brine to the wounds. 

Curl of the Leaves of the Peach Tree. — This affec- 
 tion, to which the tree is subject during the month of May, 
 and by which it often loses all its first leaves, has been com- 
 monly attributed to the punctures of insects, such as aphides 
 and the thnps. It is, however, very doubtful whether these 
 insects are the real cause of that diseased change in the 
 texture and form of the leaf which is called the curl, be- 
 cause the insects in question are rarely seen on the affected 
 leaves, and never in such numbers as sufficiently to account 
 for the extensive injury sustained. The surface of these 
 leaves is swollen into irregular and crisp tumors, often of a 
 reddish color, and of a spongy texture, formed of thick- 
 ened and succulent cellular tissue. These tumefactions 
 present some analogy to the warts of the plum tree, and 
 may have a similar origin. The affection has often been 
 observed to follow a cold storm in May, whether connected 
 therewith or not. If sudden cold and moisture have a ten- 
 dency to check evaporation from the leaves, fluids will accu- 
 mulate therein, and may thus bring about the changes by 
 which they become blasted. It is confidently stated that 
 soaping the iirnbs of the trees early in spring, or washing 
 them with a solution of sulphur and potash, will prevent 
 them from suffering from the curl. Peach trees on plum 
 stocks seem to be nearly exempt from this affection, perhaps 
 because the supply of this nourishment from the roots and 
 the exhalation from the leaves are more nearly balanced in 
 them; for the plum stock makes fewer or smaller roots than 
 the peach on its own stock. 

The Yellows. — For the first time in eleven years the 
 symptoms of this disease have appeared in my garden. It 
 is confined to two branches on the north side of one peach 
 tree, the fruit on which is becoming red some three or four 
 weeks too soon, while a few wiry shoots, clothed with dimin- 
 utive and pale leaves, have sprouted upon these branches. 
 Neither borers nor the Tomicus liminaris have been discov- 
 ered in the tree ; and the cause of the disease remains as 
 much a mystery to me as to other cultivators. I propose cut- 
 ting off the diseased branches, and dressing tho soil around 
 the tree with ashes and urine, as an experiment towards 
 checking the further developement of the disease. In for- 
 mer years peach trees have rarely suffered from the yellows 
 in this neighborhood, where now many trees are affected 
 with it. Has the severe drought of tho present season had 
 any influence in producing the disease? 

Insects of the Apple Tree. — My remarks will necessa- 
 rily be confined to a very few of the numerous insects infes- 
 ting fruit trees and vines; there being nothing new or par- 
 ticularly interesting to be stated concerning the greater part 
 of them. 

Canker-worms. — There are some parts of the country in 
 which these insects have never appeared: in other parts 
 their visitations occur several years in succession, are then 
 suspended for an uncertain term of years, after which they 
 recur again as before. Thus, in the vicinity of Boston, these 
 insects prevailed from 1831 to 1840, increasing yearly in 
 numbers till the last date, after which they disappeared al- 
 most entirely till 1847, when they began again to attract 
 attention, and have become more numerous every year till 
 the present time. Their ravages during the past summer, 
 in Cambridge and some of the adjacent towns, have been 

very serious, but have not yet reached the height they at- 
 tained in 1S39 and 1S40. Canker-worms are generally found 
 upon the buds and leaves of the trees before or about tho 
 middle of May, and disappear before or-about tho middle of 
 June, their depredations lasting nearly or quite four weeks. 
 The parent insects, consisting of winged males and wingless 
 females, ascend from their burrows in the ground in the lat- 
 ter part of October, and during the month of November, 
 and again in the spring from tho middle of March to about 
 the tenth of April. Their spring rising is sometimes retarded 
 and prolonged a week or more by the backwardness of tho 
 season. In mild winters a few of tho insects may ascend 
 at various times between the periods for the ordinary au- 
 tumnal and spring risings. It is during these same periods 
 that our trees require to be protected against the ascent 
 of the females. Soft tar, seasonably applied around the 
 trunks of the trees, and frequently renewed, is the rem- 
 edy which has been longest and most relied upon for this 
 purpose. Various other expedients have been tried to 
 prevent tho insects from ascending the trees and deposi- 
 ting their eggs upon the branches. Those most worthy 
 of confidence are circular and leaden troughs, containing 
 cheap oil or gas-tar, secured in a horizontal position 
 around the trunks of the trees, and the glass rings, late- 
 ly invented by Mr. George Everett, of Roxbury, the effi- 
 cacy of which, however, has not yet been sufficiently tested. 
 Canker-worms are very injurious to cherry and plum trees, 
 and to elms and maples, all of which will have to be sec ured 
 from their anticipated depredations in the same way as 
 apple trees. 

Palmer-icorms. — In the second edition of Dr. Deane's 
 "New England Farmer and G-eorgical Dictionary," published 
 in 1797, there will be found the following account, under the 
 article Insect : 

"The Palmer-worm, a wanderer, as its name signifies, is 
 a small worm, about half an inch in length, with many legs, 
 and extremely nimble. It appears at different times in diff- 
 erent parts of the country. I have seen them only on apple 
 trees and oak trees, in great abundance. They give the trees 
 the same appearance that the canker-worm does. They ap- 
 peared in the county of Cumberland [Maine] in the year 
 1791, about the middle of June, eating off the covering of 
 the leaves on both sides, and leaving the membranous part 
 entire. The following year there were none to be seen, 
 and I have not known them in any place two years in suc- 
 cession. The seeds of them may be constant, wanting only 
 a particular state of the weather to produce them. The 
 spring which preceded their appearance had been remarka- 
 bly dry, both in April and May. The history of this insect 
 is so little known, that I will not undertake to say how they 
 may be successfully opposed. I made smoke under the fruit 
 trees, without any apparent effect. As they let themselves 
 down by threads, they may be thinned by shaking the trees 
 and striking off the threads. Their ravages had not any 
 lasting effects, for the orchards, that had been visited by 
 them, bore plentifully the following year." 

During the month of June, 1853, a small worm, or naked 
 caterpillar, whoso history accords, in every particular, with 
 the foregoing account, was observed in great numbers on 
 apple, cherry and plum trees, and on oaks, throughout the 
 greater part of New England and the valley of tho Hudson 
 in New York. In some places, orchards suffered from these 
 insects as much as from the ravages of canker-worms ; 
 and not only the leaves, but also the fruit was injured or 
 destroyed by them. By many persons they were mistaken 
 for canker-worms. Tho latter disappeared here about the 
 tenth of June, at which time the palmer-worms were just 
 beginning their depredations. These worms, differed from
