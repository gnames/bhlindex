the former in having sixteen legs, in being much more ac- 
 tive in their motions, and in creeping without looping or 
 arching up their backs at every step. They wero also small- 
 er and differently colored. Towards the end of June, they 
 came to their growth and left the trees, their disappearance, 
 in many places, coinciding with the heavy showers which 
 fell at that date. Some of the insects which were secured, 
 covered themselves with little transparent silken webs or 
 cocoons, in which they took tho chrysalis form immediately, 
 ?nd came forth as moths betwoen the 8th and 25th of July, 
 /bout the same time they were seen in the moth state in 
 orchards, and in great numbers among the grass under fruit 
 and forest trees. They soon entirely disappeared, nor have 
 they been observed under any form since that time. In an 
 article printed in the "Cambridge Chronicle," for July 23d, 
 1853, I gave to this insect the scientific name of Rhinosia 
 pometella, the little Rhinosia or snout-moth of the orchard, 
 with a scientific description of it in all its stages. That ar- 
 ticle, and another in the "Journal of the New York State 
 Agricultural Society," for October, 1853, and also Dr. Fitch's 
 account in the same Journal for September, 1853, may be 
 consulted for further particulars. 

The New York Weevil. — In some of the Western States, 
 apple trees, and occasionally pear, plum and cherry trees, 
 have been injured by a large weevil, specimens of which, 
 taken from these trees in Michigan and Wisconsin, have 
 been sent to me. This is tho biggest weevil known in the 
 United States, measuring half an inch or more in length. 
 It is of a grey color, striped with white, and dotted with 
 black spots on tho back. Tho celebrated naturalist and 
 voyager, John Reinhold Forster, first described it in 1771, 
 under the name of Curculio Noveboracensis, the New York 
 weevil. It belongs to the modern genus Ithyeerws, and has 
 also been described by Mr. Kirby under the name of Pa- 
 chyrhynchus Schonherri. According to Mr. A. H. Hanford 
 cf Waukesha, Wisconsin, and Mr. T. E. Wetmore, of North 
 Cannon, Michigan, this weevil attacks the buds and young 
 shoots of the trees, gnawing them to the very pith, so that 
 they break off, or wither and die. Mr. Wetmore informs 
 mo that their numbers are greater this year than heretofore, 
 and apprehends great injury from them should they continue 
 to increase. They are found on the trees in May and June; 
 appear to be active during the night, and drop off by day 
 when the trees are suddenly jarred. I have taken them in 
 June and July on oaks and maples, but never mot with them 
 on fruit trees. Though not a very abundant species in Mass- 
 achusetts, it is by no means rare, and has a wide range 
 through the country, being found in most of the New Eng- 
 land, Middle and Western States, in Canada, and in New- 
 foundland. There is an account and figure of it in the 
 "Horticulturist," for August, 1853, page 3S6. The "Journal 
 of tho New York State Agricultural Society," for September, 
 1853, may also be consulted for notices of it by Dr. Fitch 
 and myself. 

Apate Bicaudatus. — This is the scientific name given by 
 Mr. Say to a little beetle, whose injurious habits have lately 
 been observed in Michigan and Wisconsin. Professor S. 
 P. Lathrop, of Wisconsin University, and Mr. T. E. Wet- 
 more have sent specimens to me, with accounts of tho dep- 
 redations of the insects, which are found burrowing in the 
 pith of the young branches of the apple tree, during the 
 spring. Tho branches above the seat of the attack soon dio. 
 These beetles are from one-quarter to more than three-tenths 
 of an inch long, cylindrical, dark chesnut brown, roughened 

1 like a garter, on the foro part of the thorax, with short 
 spines pointing backwards, and armed, in tho males, with 

1 an incurved spine, near the tip of each wing-cover. Be- 
 sides those sent to me from Michigan and Wisconsin, I havo 
 8 

specimens from Ohio, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina; 
 but havo not mot with any in New England. 

The Oak-pruner (Sienocorus putator) occasionally attacks 
 the small branches of the apple tree; and the blight beetle, 
 Scolytus, or Tomicus Pyri, whose perforations blast and kill 
 tho branches of the pear tree, has also been found equally 
 injurious to those of the apple tree. 

Dr. William Le Baron, of Geneva, Illinois, has contribu- 
 ted some interesting observations on the Bark-Lice, or scale 
 insects of tho apple tree, to the "Prairie Farmer," for June, 
 1854. He finds that there is only one annual brood of these 
 insects, that they are hatched in May, and that tho females 
 often produce from seventy to ono hundred eggs. He thinks 
 that remedies for the destruction of the insects should ba 
 applied soon after the hatching season.

 "what's the use." 

"Where's Sam?" said Joe Dennet, coming into Mr. 
 Powers' yard, and seeing Mr. Powers at the door. "Up in 
 his study," answered Sam's mother. "And where's that?" 
 asked Joe ; "I did not know that Sam had a study." Sam's 
 mother smiled, and told him to go into the garden, and may- 
 be he would find it. He did so, and shouted "Sam, where 
 are you ?" "Hallo !" said a voice from above. Joe looked 
 up, and saw his friend perched in tho crotch of an apple- 
 tree, with slate and book in hand. 

"Come," said Joe, "the boys are going a-boating, and 
 want you to go." "Can't," answered Sam; "I am trying to 
 master this algebra; we all missed to-day." "Why it is 
 Wednesday afternoon, and that is our time. I would not 
 study, I am sure: what's tho use?" asked Joe. "Well, 
 for my part, I am bound to get this lesson the first thing I 
 do," said Sam. "Pooh ! it's too hot to study; beside, I hate 
 algebra; what's the use puzzling your brains over xplus y?" 
 "I think it is of use to get our lessons," said Sam. "What 
 are you going to do after that ?" asked Joe. "I am going 
 to weed the onion beds." "Oh ! it's too pleasant to work; 
 what's the use tying yourself up here all the afternoon? I 
 would not," said Joe Dennet. "Well, I think its of use to 
 do what needs to be done," was Sam's answer. 

This was a fair sample of Sf.m Powers and Joseph Den- 
 net, two boys who lived in tho same neighborhood. It is 
 twenty -five years or more, since this kind of talk took place, 
 and the boys are now men. Sam Powers is called a man of 
 "iron will," because he lays plans and carries them out 
 with a patience and energy which never gives up. He is 
 one of tho first business men in the State, and a truly pious 
 man, too. How is it with Joe ? He goes through life a man, 
 just as he did a boy. If there is any extra exertion to bo 
 made in his business, he asks "What's the use?" and goes 
 to it with so little heart that he is sure to fail. He is always 
 complaining of hard times, and wondering how people get 
 ahead so. As for his religion, he does not live as if it wero 
 of much use to him or any one else. 

Thero are some boys who, when they have anything to 
 do, or are called upon to do a little more than usual, try to 
 shirk off by asking, "Oh! what's the use?" The fact is, 
 boys, there is use in doing, like a man, what you have to do. 
 There is use in getting your lessons, and getting them well, 
 and making extra exertions to get them, if they are difficult 
 There is use in weeding the garden, chopping at the wood- 
 pile, finding the cows, cultivating a taste for reading, and 
 in doing what your parents ask of you. Whenever I hear 
 a boy trying to excuse himself from duty, by asking, fret- 
 fully, "Oh, what's the use ?" I mark him as a lazy, shirking, 
 shuffling boy, who ti ill be very likely to be good for nothing
