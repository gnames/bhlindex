New Substitute for the Potatoes.

Dioscorea Batatas. {Igname of China.) 
 New observations relative to it. 

We live at a time when it is not necessary to struggle 
 forever against popular prejudice as to a new and useful 
 thing in agriculture. If some resistance is experienced 
 in our country population, yet enlightened men are now 
 numerous enough everywhere to encourage a new and 
 useful plant. 

The great amelioration in our State by the use of the 
 most perfect types of a race, borrowed from our neigh- 
 bors and elsewhere, are incontestible proofs of advance. 
 Culture, drainage, &c, are so many happy reforms in 
 our domestic affairs, and in our comforts and manners. 
 We do not flatter ourselves with making popular at the 
 first onset, the Igname of China; bui we do hope that its 
 introduction to general use will not be opposed, as the 
 potato was for nearly tico hundred years! Its malady is, 
 we trust, but temporary. Malady might assail this new 
 Batatas, but perhaps not ; so that we may henceforth not 
 fear a famine. 

Five j'ears ago the first Dioscorea Batatas was brought 
 to us. It has attracted attention now almost everywhere, 
 and the calls for them to plant are numerous from all 
 quarters. 

My mode of cultivating them. 

Towards the middle of April, when I believed that we 
 should have no more frost, I planted some of them in 
 pieces and whole, in good light garden beds, at the Mu- 
 seum of Natural History. I set them about twenty inch- 
 es apart every way ; this was wrong — they should have 
 been set much nearer together. The future alone will 
 teach us what effect our climate may have upon it. All 
 that I can now say is, that my plants have this year (1854) 
 grown well, their long shoots being very vigorous and 
 covered with thick foliage. They produced many flow- 
 ers (all of which were male) about the beginning of Au- 
 gust. At the end of August, the growth of stalks and 
 leaves ceased, and they assumed that yellowish hue 
 which indicated, after the middle of September, the ap- 
 proaching maturity of the tubercles. 

I set apart some square feet of the plants for other 
 experiments, while two of my lots were covered, one 
 with strong poles about ten feet long, the other with 
 poles about seven or eight feet long. The branches and 
 stalks of the igname twine around these poles as beans 
 do, and soon run beyond the length of their poles. 

In the third lot I let them have their own way, and 
 the vines did not root at their joints, and twisting togeth- 
 er, grew nearly as long as those on the poles. 

The tubers which I planted whole, gave remarkably 
 vigorous plants, each of which gave a new tuber — of 
 these, two were quite large. When pulled, one weighed 
 nearly three pounds, (1 kilo. 3G0,) the other 1 kilo 1G0. 
 The third was injured by the insect Ilanneton. The or- 
 iginal batatas which I planted were still on, very much 
 wrinkled. The beds of cut tubers did not produce well, 

weighing on an average not over a quarter of a pound. 

Of the whole, the result was from twenty-eight plants, 
 each giving one tuber — on an average the tubers weigh- 
 ed about five ounces each. (345 qrs. 18.) Wo found 
 on the whole, from fifty-seven plants, seventeen kilo- 
 grammes, or nearly forty-three pounds weight of tubers. 

The result of these experiments shows, that a hectare 
 can produce 0000, kilogrammes of igname, or that an 
 acre may yield something like two hundred bushels. We 
 think, from what we have seen of the growth, that ten 
 inches apart every way will be room enough for the root 
 — for this plant seems to live upon the air by its vines and 
 leaves. The product of tubers was nearly double, our 
 late usual crops of potatoes. These ignames are from 
 ten to twenty inches long; the upper third of the roots 
 very slender, about the size of our little finger. I think 
 that this part should be reserved for planting. Tho 
 digging of them is a difficulty. In China they always 
 plant them in sand}' soil. 

I do not hesitate to prefer the Chinese igname to tho 
 common potato for quality; I believe the igname to be 
 more nutritious. The flesh of it is as white as snow 1 it 
 has no apparent fibre in it. By boiling it becomes so 
 tender that under the lightest pressure it becomes a 
 paste, like that made of the finest wheat flour. Cooked 
 by steam, or roasting in hot ashes, it hns the appear- 
 ance and taste of the best of our common potatoes. 
 Two pieces of the root as large as a common Dutch po- 
 tato were boiled together, with a potato of same size, and 
 the ignames were done in ten minutes, while the Dutch 
 potato was twenty minutes in cooking. This is a valua- 
 ble property, saving both time and fuel — and that \% 
 one reason why the potato was so much valued originally. 
 And this igname keeps well from one year to another. 
 The igname has been successfully cultivated in Algiers. 

Many of the dioscoreas have the property of multi- 
 plying by these bulbs, which become detached from the 
 plants when at maturity. — Working Farmer.

Schexck's Gardeners' Text Book. — We have re- 
 ceived from the publishers, John P. Jewett & Co., Bos- 
 ton, a copy of the above work, treating very fully of 
 every thing appertaining to a well regulated kitchen 
 garden, from the first selection of the site to the pre- 
 paration of the soil, manuring, mode of planting tho 
 seed, tending and gathering the crop ; also the methods 
 of cooking and preparing for the table every variety of 
 vegetables. It describes all the different varieties of 
 vegetable seeds, often so puzzling to the gardener which 
 to select from the extensive list of names and synony- 
 mes, and recommends such as are most desirable. 

Wc copy in another column an extract on the "Selec- 
 tion of Seeds," also on their vitality or length of timo 
 they will continue fit to plant, which will be useful for 
 reference hereafter. The present edition is the "fourth 
 thousand." It contains over three hundred pages, is in a 
 very portable form, and we think a very valuable treatise*.
