tremely cold weather has done much damage to the 
 approaching peach crop in the middle and northern 
 counties in this State, as in many localities the mer- 
 cury was lower than above indicated, 

We observe that L. B. Langworthy, of Greece, New 
 York, states, in the Rural New Yorker, that he has ex- 
 amined branches of ten different kinds of peach 
 trees, from the earliest varieties to the latest clings, and 
 in over one hundred buds found the germ black and dry 
 and not one alive, — -from which fact he is persuaded 
 that the peach crop in that region is lost for this year at 
 any rate. 

Planting Trees. 

There are several requisites, to successful planting of 
 trees and shrubs, if the object is to make them, thrive, 
 grow, and bear fine fruit or foliage. We have frequently 
 adverted to these in the pages of the Farm Journal, and 
 only now remind our readers, that if there is one error 
 more fatal than the rest, or more frequent it is planting 
 ton deep. After the earth settles the tree should be no 
 deeper than before. The way to prevent it from being 
 blown about and disturbed by the winds is to secure it 
 by a stake, not by burying in the ground, where the air 
 cannot penetrate. 

A certain Professor C.omstock, has been going the 
 rounds in New York State, and we believe petitioning 
 the legislature for one hundred thousand dollars, as 
 an inducement to reveal what he calls a great secret of 
 vegetable life, of his own discovery. The good people 
 there seem to have been willingly paying two dollars, as 
 a kind of initiation fee, to his lectures, when the great 
 secret turns out to be nothing more than the aforesaid 
 fact, avoid deep planting, known before the Professor 
 was born, and we dare say recited by Virgil inhisGcorgics. 

The small space or neck of the tree just above where 
 the roots diverge, the Professor calls the "seat of life," 
 and which he thinks should not be choked off under 

ground. A great discovery truly!

Draining Tile and Draining. 
 There are very few farms, on which more or less acres 
 are not lying unprofitably and unproductive for the want 
 of proper drainage. The constant eye sore of a wet field 
 or meadow, on which nothing grows but the rankest and 
 coarsest herbage, is allowed to remain year after year, 
 when a very small comparative outlay, would convert it 
 into the most productive part of the farm. Stagnant 
 water at the roots of growing crops, is as detrimental to 
 them, as to animals. The temperature of the soil, where 
 water cannot pass off is so reduced, that vegetable de- 
 composition is retarded, and plants and crops are actu- 
 ally starved off, and dwindle away in the midst of abun- 
 dance, because the food is not in such a condition as to 
 be assimilated and taken up by the absorbent vessels. 
 Give such places a vent for the surplus water, allow the 
 warm sun to penetrate the soil and act upon the mass of 
 vegetable food, which has long lain dormant, and the 
 effects will be surprising. We have known many a farm 
 sold at a low price, on account of the supposed great 
 drawback of a wet meadow. An estimate is made of the 
 number of acres of woodland, acres of arable land, and 
 waste land, the latter never having been drained or made 

productive, is supposed not to be capable of being so r 
 and when a very trifle, would convert it into the most pro- 
 ductive part of the farm. In many places, where stone 
 is scarce there has been an obstacle to under ground and 
 surface draining, which is now remedied by the manu- 
 facture of draining tile. This we have ascertained, can, 
 now be purchased at the agricultural warehouses very 
 cheaply, the best sole tile, four and a half by five inches, 
 costing not over forty dollars per thousand feet, and 
 smaller sizes much less. Two or three manufacturers 
 have lately started in the vicinity of Philadelphia. 

These covered drains offer no obstacle to culture, per- 
 form their work under ground silently and effectually and 
 in one case we have lately heard, where they were laid 
 down last season on a large scale, have added at least 
 fifty per cent to the value of land. 

Before our young farmers think of moving to the far 
 west, and before they ought to complain of farming not 
 making money fast enough, we think they are bound to 
 turn to the best account, the means of production with- 
 in their reach. It is possible to hold a sixpence so close 
 to the eye, as not to see the dollar beyond, which we 
 think is the case with neglected draining. Productive 
 industry should be the watchword, that industry, which 
 can turn every thing to best account, convert the stub- 
 born and useless glebe, into a fertile and remunerating 
 channel, which will make two blades grow instead of one, 
 and use, not abuse, or neglect the means of wealth, and 
 support, which nature throws so liberally before the far- 
 mer. 

Crawford County Agricultural Society, 
 We are indebted to A. Lyle White, Esq., editor of the 
 American Republican Banner, for the following: — At the 
 annual election of the Crawford County Agricultural 
 Society, held in Conneautvllle, on Monday, January 1st, 
 1855, the following persons were elected officers for the 
 ensuing year: — President, J. E. Fatton, Vice President, 
 Jas. L. Beatty, John F. McDowell, Wm. T. Ilorsmer, 
 Recording Secretary, A. J. Foster, Corresponding Sec- 
 retary, J. W. Patton, Treasurer, Wm. Power, Executive 
 Committee, A. J. Whipple, T. J. Lowry, Asa Sturtevant, 
 John Thompson, and James Sterling, Auditors, Frank 
 Mantor, Daniel Harnmon and Alva Beeman. 

Hints for the Season. 

Ploir deep, andpulverize thoroughly before seeding by 
 repeated harrowings. The seed will grow and vegetate 
 much better, be brought into contact, and extract nutri- 
 ment from more particles of soil, which will also be more 
 open to the fertilizing influence of the atmosphere 
 Use plenty of seed, the first cost is trifling compared with 
 the increased aggregate yield, at harvest time. 

Prepare ground speedily for at least an acre of root 
 crops, Sugar Beet, Carrots, and Ruta Baga. These will 
 all be wanted next winter. Deep plowing, heavy ma- 
 nuring, and fine pulverization are essentials in root cul- 
 ture. 

Roll pasture and mowing grounds. 

Feed liberally horses and working cattle, with grain 
 while on duty. 

Spread plaster early so as to take advantage of spring 
 rains.
