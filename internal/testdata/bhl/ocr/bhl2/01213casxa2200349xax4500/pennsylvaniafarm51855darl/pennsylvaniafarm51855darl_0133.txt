to the improvement of its agriculture, therefore 

Resolved, That agriculture should be the first interest 
 considered in legislating for the general welfare, and 
 that such legislation should be had as will foster and 
 protect this interest, which is paramount to all others. 

Resolved, That the time has arrived for the agricultur- 
 alists of the whole country to meet in convention, and 
 determine for themselves what legislation is necessary 
 for their protection. 

Resolved, That such a convention, to be composed of 
 delegates from each State of the Union, be earnestly rec- 
 ommended by this Society, in order that an agricultural 
 platform may be established, which will meet the views 
 of, and be sustained by, the whole body of agricultural- 
 ists as a profession. 

Mr. Wager, of New York, submitted a report on the 
 proposed amendments to the constitution, which was dis- 
 cussed by Messrs. Fay and Waters, of Massachusetts, 
 Cook of Rhode Island, King of New York, Hamilton of 
 New Jersey, Calvert of Maryland, and Worthington of 
 Ohio. 

The constitution was so amended as to have the pay- 
 ment of ten dollars constitute life membership. 

Various reports were read, among them one on the 
 Chess in Wheat, from the Smithsonian Institution; on Ag- 
 ricultural History, by B. P. Poore; on Mr. Glover's Collec- 
 tion, by Mr. Peck; and on Western Fruits, by Dr. Warder. 

Mr. reck, of Maryland, reported that the committee 
 appointed to urge upon Congress the purchase of Mr. 
 Glover's collection of modelled fruits, had had an inter- 
 view with the proper committee of Congress, and receiv- 
 ed assurances that the matter would receive their atten- 
 tion. 

A communication from Professor Henry was read, de- 
 tailing experiments on the culture of the "Oregon Pea," 
 made under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution, 
 at the request of the Society. The results at Savannah 
 proved it worthless for that region. 

A paper on "Alderney Cattle," by Dr. W. J. G. Mor- 
 ton, was read and referred. Also, a paper on "Potato 
 Oat," from New York. 

Dr. Warder, of Cincinnati, exhibited over thirty 
 different varieties of western apples, which he descanted 
 upon with his wonted accuracy. 

An invitation was received and accepted inviting the 
 Society to visit the Metropolitan Mechanics' Institute to 
 day at 11 o'clock. Invitations to visit the office of the 
 Coast Survey and the agricultural room at the Patent 
 Office were also accepted. 

After some remarks by Mr. Custis, giving his experi- 
 ence in growing wheat in Virginia, the Society adjonrned 
 until 7 o^clock, when the Hon. G. P. Marsh had been 
 invited to address them on the Rural Economy of Conti- 
 nental Europe. 

The lecture was listened to with great interest, em- 
 bodying, as it did, a great amount of original information, 
 and its publication will constitute a valuable addition to 
 agricultural literature. 

Dr. Warder followed, with an eloquent lecture on 
 hedges, replete with practical information. 
 Friday Morning, March 2. 

The Society met at 10 o'clock, and passed an hour in 
 familiar conversation on agricultural subjects. 

After a discussion on the appointment of Commission- 
 ers to the Industrial Exhibition at Paris, the matter was 
 referred to the Executive Committee. 

On motion of Mr. Poore, of Massachussetts, it was 
 unanimously 

Resolved, That the thanks of the United States Agri- 
 cultural Society, be presented to the Regents of the 
 Smithsonian Institution, for the facilities afforded for 
 holding this session. The utility of this Institution, in 
 thus serving as a nucleus, around which all useful asso- 
 ciations can rally, at the capital of our Republic, shows 
 the wisdom of the course pursued by the present Regents. 
 Col. Kimmel, of Maryland, read a curious extract from 
 the Maryland Gazette, of September 8, 1747, showing 
 that "cattle shows" were established at Baltimore in 
 that year. 

On motion of Mr. Waters, of Massachussetts, it was 
 unanimously 

Resolved, That the thanks of this Society be proffered 
 to the Hon. Geo. P. Marsh, for the beautifully written 
 and exceedingly interesting lecture he was so good as tD 
 present to us last evening, and that Professor Henry be 
 requested to wait on him and request a copy for publi- 
 cation. 

On motion of Col. Calvert of Maryland, it was unani- 
 mously 

Resolved, That the thanks of this Society be presented 
 to Dr. Warder, for his interesting lecture on the culti- 
 vation of hedges, and that he be requested to present a 
 copy of the same for publication in the transactions of 
 the Society. 

At eleven o'clock, in accordance with their acceptance 
 of the invitation, the Society adjourned to visit the exhi- 
 bition of the "Metropolitan Mechanic's Institute." 

After visiting the Exlribition yesterday the society re- 
 turned to the "East Room," and on motion of Mr. King, 
 of New York, it was 

Resolved, That the thanks of the society be presented 
 to the officers of the Metropolitian Mechanics' Institute, 
 for their polite invitation to attend their exhibition, 
 which they have visited and examined with great pleasure. 

After sone debate, in which a strong desire for concer- 
 ted action on the part of American Agriculturists was 
 manifested, it was on motion of Col. Calvert, of Mary- 
 land, 

Resolved, That the first Friday after the next annual 
 moeting be fixed for the assembling of the Agricultural 
 Convention, and that the press be requested to urge the 
 importance of the subject. 

Resolutions were passed complimenting the agricultu- 
 ral press, and urging its conductors to consider political 
 economy, and urge united action on such matters con- 
 nected with it as their judgement may suggest. 

On motion of Mr. Taylor, it was 

Resolved, That the thanks of the National Agricultural 
 Society, be tendered to the Hon. Mr. Morton, of the 
 United States Senate, for his able report upon the sub- 
 ject of an Agricultural Department. 

Resolutions were passed complimentary to President 
 Wilder; of the Smithsonian Institution; to Lieut. Maury, 
 (for an invitation to visit the Observatory;) to Mr. King, 
 the Secretary of the society; and to Mr. Poore, of the 
 executive committee. *
