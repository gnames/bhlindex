hyacinths, Narcissus, &c , may be planted the early 
 part of this month. Plants that have been -wintered in 
 cellars should be brought out the latter part of the 
 month ; hut previous to that they should have fresh air 
 admitted to them as freely as possible.

The Moon Theory Exploded. 
 In August 1852, to test the theory of Lydia Jane Pier- 
 Bon, that briars, bushes, &c., were more certainly des- 
 troyed by being cut in the old of the moon in August 
 where its place is in Leo, than at other times, I made 
 the trial on a field too stony to be plowed, on which 
 were some bunches of briars, tho bunches that were on 
 one-half the field were cut in the afternoon of the 14th 
 of August, being the old of the moon, the change taking 
 place next day and being the first day of the sign being 
 in Leo— the other half were cut on the 23d, about the 
 first quarter The result was, that the cutting was very 
 effective in weakening the briars, for they were not en- 
 tirely killed, but on closer examination there was no 
 perceptible di (Terence in the effect from cutting at the 

different times. I believe August is a proper time to cut 
 up briars for the purpose of destroying them, and that 
 the moon's place in the ecliptic need not be attended to. 

At the same time I provided many blocks of wood 
 about three inches square and an inch thick, placing 
 one each morning on a tough grass sod where the grass 
 made little growth at that season, for the purpose of 
 showing the moon's power or want of power to depress 
 the blocks when the moon points down according to tha 
 almanac makers, or to raise them when the moon points 
 up. I had purposed to continue putting clown a block 
 each morning for several months, but it was only con- 
 tinued till the 20th of September when I left home and 
 was away for a considerable time and on my return 
 found that those that I had put down, had been dis- 
 placed, and I did not again commence. I would recom- 
 mend this last experiment to the attention of the curiou? 
 and scientific enquirer, not that I expect that the moon 
 would be implicated in the derangement, but that the 
 causes that have produced effects which she has been 
 charged with may be discovered. A. W. C

View of Osage Orange Hedges, I 

The above cut was intended to be placed in connection 
 with an article on Osage Orange Hedges, on page 103 
 of our present number, but was not received in time. 
 It presents a view of a property npon which these 
 hedges are growing. Our friends in reach of Philadel- 
 phia, desirous of witnessing them growing in perfec- 
 tion, have only to call on James Gowen, Esq., Presi- 
 dent of the Pennsylvania State Agricultural Society, at 
 his beautiful farm at Mount Airy, near — or rather in — 
 this city, who we doubt not will take pleasure in show- 
 ing them, as well as some other things of interest to 
 the agriculturist to be seen there. 

Our Native Oaks. 
 Among the large variety of trees planted out annually 
 for shade or ornament, it is much to be regretted onr 
 native oaks are so lightly esteemed, and we can think of 
 no reason for it, but a general impression which pre- 
 vails that they are of so slow growth. From our own 
 observation, when planted as trees always should be, 
 they are in this particular but very little, if any, behind 
 many others more often enquired for. 

We have frequently noticed with great pleasure, th<? 
 oaks in the extensive ornamental grounds — over thirty 
 acres — attached to Friends! Haverford School in Dela- 
 ware county, a few miles from Philadelphia, as well as 
 the profusion of other native trees — ash, beach, poplar, 
 elm, maple, pines, firs, &c. These grounds were plant- 
 ed about twenty years ago, and We have never seen else- 
 where a more complete exemplification of the results of 
 good planting. Many of them now, in respect to size, 
 come up to the idea usually understood by forest trees, 
 The circle may still be distinctly seen, indicating the size 
 the holes were dug, from six to eight feet in diameter 
 The trees when planted, we understand, were about the 
 ordinary size, and, in addition to the large holes, pro- 
 perly prepared soil was also plentifully used, and the 
 result of the skilful management of the gardener, who 
 was an Englishman, has been a rapid and symmetrical 
 growth that we have not seen equalled elsewhere. 

The oaks are' now nearly as large as many of the 
 other trees, although several of the species are those of 
 slowest growth, such as Quercus, Bicolor obtusiloba. 
 Alba and Nigra. Of Q. macrocarpa there are several 
 specimens of great beauty about thirty feet high, with
