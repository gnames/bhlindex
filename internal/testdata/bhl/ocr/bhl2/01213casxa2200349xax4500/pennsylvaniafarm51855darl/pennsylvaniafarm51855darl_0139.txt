office, among others, to the principal of the collegiate depart- 
 ment of the University of Maryland. In the spring of 1853, 
 Dr. Higgins, the agricultural Chemist of Maryland, requested 
 me to write it out for his report to tho Legislature of that 
 year, and it was published in that report, verbatim with tho 
 manuscript copy now in my possession, with the remark 
 that it was the best formula for qualitative (the quantitative 
 is not mine) analysis, with which he was acquainted. Since 
 its publication, 1 have made the most important improve- 
 ments that have ever occurred to me in regard to this for- 
 mula; and now, that a premium of $100 is offered for the 
 best essay and formula, in this relation, by the Maryland 
 State Agricultural Society, and I am appointed Chairman of 
 the Committee with Dr. Higgins, I am anxious to see some 
 improvements made on these formula by others, especially 
 by the agricultural department of Delaware College; in my 
 relation to the matter, I cannot participate in the contest 
 The premium is to be awarded in May next 

If there is a state in the Union where agriculture is of 
 paramount importance, and rural economy should be the

President of the Pennsylvania State Agricultural Society. 
 The American Farmer thus notices the election of Me. 
 Gowen to the Presidency of the Pennsylvania State Agri- 
 cultural Society: — "Judge Watts having declined a re-elec- 
 tion to the Presidency, James Gowen, Esq., the distinguish- 
 ed farmer of Mount Airy, was chosen in his place; and we 
 congratulate the Society on the honor done itself, in confer- 
 ring tho Presidency upon this veteran in the cause of agri- 
 cultural improvement. Few men now living have labored 
 more assiduously and effectually than Mr. G., in arousing 
 that spirit which is so rife throughout the land, for the de- 
 velopement of the agricultural resources of our country. 
 A3 far back as wo can remember, since our connexion with 
 this press, now for more than twonty years, has his name 
 been familiar to us, in this connexion — and our pages, as 
 well as those of many other agricultural journals of the 
 United States, bear witness to his indefatigable efforts for 
 tho exaltation of the character of tho farmer, and the im- 
 provement of his condition." 

T. P. Remington's Improved Stock. 

We recently paid a visit to tho farm of Thomas P. Rem- 
 ington of Philadelphia, situated on the Lancaster Turnpike, 
 about six miles from Market st., and were agreably surprised 
 to find so largo a number of high bred animals, consisting 
 of Durhams and Alderneys, together about fifty-three head. 
 Owing to their owner having made no effort to make his 
 herd extensively known, the public generally are not aware 
 that this large collection comprises some of the best blood 
 now in the country, no pains or expense having been 
 spared to obtain them from the very best sources, both here 
 and in England. 

The splendid Bull 1st Lord Barrington, which took the first 
 premium at the late Pa. State Fair, now owned by Dennis 
 Kelly, was bred by T. P. Remington; he still owns his 
 dam, Lady Barrington 4th; who, although thin in flesh, 
 attracted our attention, by her fine proportions, and evident 
 marks of high breeding; she is a good milker, and has 
 given thirty quarts of milk per day. We noticed particu- 
 larly among the Short-horns, for their fine tapering muzzles, 
 delicato head and horns, and other indications of high 
 blood, Pocahontas, roan; Sophia, rod; Milk-Maid, who gives 

twonty-six quarts per day; Adriana white, a very fine cow, 
 and Donna Maria, now in calf the second time, which 
 gave twenty quarts per day with her first calf; Perfection, 
 red, has the framo for a very large animal, is very broad 
 behind, and over tho hips and back, and in other respects 
 is a true Durham. Imported Rowena, roan, is the mother of 
 young bull, Richard Booth, now about fifteen months old; 
 he is certainly a very superior young bull, of very fine qual- 
 ity. In his head, neck, eye, muzzle and horns, he remindod 
 us of C. J. Wolbert's* celebrated Bull, Colostra, that was 
 never surpassed, so far as we know, in these points. Rowena 
 was bred by Hon. II. N. Hill of Barrington, and got by Sir 
 Walter 2nd, E. H. B., 10834. 

Young Richard Booth was sired by Mr. Richard Booth's 
 celebrated "Monk." 

T. P. Remington has at present three Durham bulls in 
 his herd, viz., 2nd Lord Barrington, two and a half years 
 old, that took a special premium at the late Pa. State Fair, 
 Richard Booth, and a younger one, "Yorkeshireman," about a 
 year old ; also two Alderney bulls, one of them, Patrick 3rd, 
 as stylish an Alderney bull as we have ever seen. The 
 Alderney cows are, several of them, very fine. 

At our special request, and in answer to enquiries from ub, 
 T. P. Remington addressed us the following letter, giving 
 the pedigroo of his Bulls, and has also kindly added the 
 other remarks about his herd. His opinions as to the great 
 merits of tho Alderneys for milking, are confirmed by nearly 
 all who have tried them. 

To tho Editor of the Farm Journal : — I owe you an apol- 
 ogy for not having sooner replied to your solicitations for 
 pedigrees of my cattle. As regards the 1st Lord Barring-

 in 1S50, by the New York State Agricultural Society, in 
 class of Milk Cows, being a thorough bred improved short 
 horn. She gave in eighty days on grass feed only, over 
 two tons of milk, and made from June 10th to the 20tb, 
 and from August 10th to the 20th, over forty pounds of 
 butter. The dam of Ruby was Willy 2nd, see American H.
