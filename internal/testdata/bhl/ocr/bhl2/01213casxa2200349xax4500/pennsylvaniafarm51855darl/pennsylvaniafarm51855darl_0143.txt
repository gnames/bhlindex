Sowing Corn Fodder— Drilling—Deep Plowing. 

"It is an ill wind that blows no one any 
 though a trite proverb is often verified in the experience 
 of the farmer. We believe it will be found true, as re- 
 gards the effects of the late very severe winter on our 
 mowing and pasture fields, the alternations of which from 
 mild to extreme cold, together with the small amount of 
 snow fallen, acting as a protective covering to the 
 ground, have apparently killed out the grass, especially 
 in fields recently seeded down. Roots of both grass and 
 wheat may be seen in many farms of eastern Pennsyl- 
 vania laying on the surface of the ground, heaved up by 
 the frost, entirely dead ; and this, too, at a time when 
 wheat is worth $2.50 per bushel, and beef and butter 
 higher than for many years. There are two or three 
 practical inferences suggested by these facts which we 
 wish to call attention to. We say facts, because they 
 are plain and obvious to every farmer on his own farm, 
 and may prove, if wisely reflected upon and digested, 
 more valuable than many pages of reading. 

1st. We have known, this spring, fields of wheat appa- 
 rently almost killed out, with the roots lying on the sur- 
 face, the seed having been sown broadcast, adjoining 
 other fields looking green and healthy where the seed 
 had been drilled, no roots in the latter, comparatively, 
 having been heaved up by the frost. This we consider 
 a strong argument in favor of drilling, which puts the 
 seed in deeper, with more regularity and evenness, the 
 small ridges between the rows mouldering down during 
 the winter and covering the wheat as required for pro- 
 tection. Here is one practical deduction of great value. 

2d. It has also been found that on those fields where 
 the ground was deeply plowed or subsoiled to the depth 
 of eight to twelve inches, these effects of a severe win- 
 ter, which will shorten the hay and pasture crop at least 
 one-third, and in some cases probably one-half, have not 
 been observed to the same extent as on others. This 
 we consider a second practical deduction of great impor- 
 tance. 

The 3d point we have to make is a remedy for this 
 state of things fortunately within reach, and which will 
 go far to make up the loss, viz : where the grass has 
 been observed to be thus killed out, plow up the fields 
 immediately, and sow corn for fodder. It has been fully 
 proven that nothing will turn off so much acreable pro- 
 vender, nutricious and palatable to stock, as sown fod- 
 der. By successive sowings a supply can be kept up 
 the whole season, and for cows, when fed green, it is 
 9 

fully equal to the best pasture, and will make as much 
 and as rich milk and butter. 

We have frequently urged upon our readers the im- 
 portance of the corn fodder crop, and as the present is 
 a most opportune period for the experiment, we hope 
 they will give it a trial. There are two methods of put- 
 ting in the crop, by drilling in rows and by broadcast- 
 ing. We prefer the former, and would recommend, 
 after the ground has been well plowed and thoroughly 
 pulverized, rows should be struck out one way, two and 
 a half or three feet apart, and the corn strewed along at 
 the rate of about three bushels to the acre. The seed 
 may readily be covered with a cultivator or harrow pass- 
 ing parallel with the rows. When the corn is about a 
 foot high, run the cultivator along once or twice to clean 
 out the weeds, and no farther attention will be required, 
 as the ground will soon be covered and yield a product 
 of ten or twelve tons to the acre, and more, depending 
 on the strength of the soil. 

The above is substantially the plan recommended by 
 J. J. Thomas, and we believe to be the best. George 
 Walker, of Susquehanna county, however, prefers the 
 broadcasting system, and gives his method of managing 
 it and his product in one of our back numbers. If the 
 soil is not in good condition, it will pay well to spread 
 three hundred pounds of guano to the acre previous to 
 plowing. Much of the fodder crop may be got off in 
 time to seed with wheat next fall if desired. 

Home Production and Home Consumption. 

Our friend Howard Williamson, of Chester county, 
 has written us a practical and interesting letter on the 
 above subject, which we regret not being able to insert 
 entire. He goes for the protection of our domestic in- 
 dustry, and thinks if manufacturers and mechanics of 
 all kinds — shoemakers, tailors, carpenters, spinners, 
 weavers, &c. — were encouraged to locate among the far- 
 mers, it would create a ready home market at once for 
 all their produce, beef, butter, eggs, flour, fruit, &c. ; 
 that this increased consumption would re-act again, ma- 
 king increased production, and thus the substantial 
 wealth of all be promoted. 

This has always been our view, but as the principle of 
 protection has been made so exciting a political question • 
 for the last thirty years, and we wish to keep politics 
 out of the Farm Journal, we have avoided entering upon 
 its discussion. We think, however, our friend is in er- 
 ror in connecting the decreased production of wheat in 
 New York and Ohio with the increase of agricultural so-
