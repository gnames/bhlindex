cieties. There is certainly no fair inference of the kind 
 to be drawn, and the directly beneficial effects of their 
 influence can be pointed to in the most palpable shape 
 all over the Union. We should rather say the reduced 
 product of -wheat per acre has occurred in spite of agri- 
 cultural societies or notwithstanding them. 

New Jersey State Agricultural Exhibition. 

We understand the Executive Committee of this So- 
 ciety have fixed upon Camden, opposite Philadelphia, 
 for their State Fair next fall. Whatever the Jersey 
 farmers take in hand they are apt to do most thorough- 
 ly, and we may accordingly look for an outpouring, not 
 only of improved stock of different kinds, especially 
 horses, of which some of the best specimens in the 
 country are in New Jersey, but also those fine vegetable 
 productions for which she is deservedly famous, melons, 
 tomatoes, sweet potatoes, and other products of the gar- 
 den; apples, peaches, pears and plums from the orchard; 
 and a display of field crops, for which her farmers are 
 so particular in procuring choice specimens of seed, 
 corn, oats, wheat, potatoes, &c. It is also not generally 
 known that one of, if not the greatest Fomologist in the 
 â– world resides at Plainfield, New Jersey, a Belgian gen- 
 tleman, L. E. Benchmans, from whom contributions of 
 his immense collection may no doubt be expected at a 
 New Jersey State Exhibition. We understand he has 
 at this time growing twelve hundred varieties of pears, 
 twelve hundred apples, and twenty thousand seedling 
 pears. 

The location at Camden we should suppose to be the 
 best that could be selected on various accounts, and we 
 have no doubt of its complete success. 

Death of Thomas Hancock. 

Soon after our pages had gone to the foundry for ste- 
 reotyping last month, we received information of the de- 
 cease of Thomas Hancock, of Burlington, New Jersey. 
 Although rather late for a notice, we may remark that 
 agriculture and horticulture have lost in him a firm and 
 zealous friend, whose persevering efforts for a number 
 of years have contributed very much to advance these 
 two great interests, and attract to them public attention. 
 In the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society, he was one 
 of the most active members, and will be greatly missed, 
 being a liberal contributor himself to its exhibitions, es- 
 pecially in the department of fruits, to which branch he 
 had long devoted close attention in obtaining and pro- 
 pagating such new varieties as were valuable and adapt- 
 ed to our climate. His large experience in this partic- 
 ular made his counsel much sought for as a member of 
 its fruit committees. 

Thomas Hancock was remarkable for his energy, en- 
 terprise and public spirit, filling many positions in his 
 own vicinity of profit, trust and honor. He was one of 
 the active originators of the Burlington County Agricul- 
 tural Society, and latterly devoted considerable time 
 and means to the improvement of stock. He was pro- 
 bably most extensively known as the proprietor of the 
 Ashton Nursei'ies, near Burlington, established over 
 thirty years ago, and containing one of the best collec- 
 tions of fruit and ornamental trees and shrubbery in the 
 country. 

Budded and Standard Roses. 
 There seems to be a very general dislike to budded roses, 
 and many of our finest varieties, which by the way hap- 
 pen to be the most difficult of propagation by cuttings, are 
 rejected because difficult to obtain on their own roots. 
 The objection to budded roses is not without some reason, 
 but we think the force of it depends very much on the 
 kind of stock used. The common sweet briar and 
 maiden's blush are objectionable from their great liability 
 to sucker. We have known a fine sucker to be cultiva- 
 ted and trained with the greatest care, to the irreparable 
 injury and loss of the budded plant of more feeble growth, 
 and the mistake not discovered till the bloom appeared. 
 Where the stock and scion, too, do not form a perfect 
 union, the latter is also very liable to be broken off. 
 Nearly all the objections, however, to budded roses fail 
 when the mannetti stock is used, and if care is taken to 
 obtain them on this variety which is now generally used 
 for the purpose, there need be no difficulty. The man- 
 netti first brought into notice by T. Rivers, has several 
 very great merits. It is a very strong grower, and plants 
 budded on it often grow much faster than on their own 
 roots. It is extremely hardy, and never suckers. 
 Standard roses worked high on a single stem, have not 
 usually done well in our climate, owing to the exposure 
 of the naked stem to our hot scorching suns. The man- 
 netti does not seem to mind either intense cold or great 
 heat, and its bark becomes almost as tough and rough as 
 a tree. We have seen such fine perpetuals as Geant des 
 Bataille, Souvenir de Malmaison, William Jesse and 
 Mrs. Bosanquet, worked at about four feet high, on a 
 single stem and in bloom at the same time, making a 
 most elegant tree of roses, with perfect branches. When 
 the climbers are thus managed they droop over and 
 make a weeping rose tree, of any desired height, four, 
 five or six feet, and are a most attractive object for the 
 lawn. 

To Improve our Roads. 

A correspondent, who has been suffering considerably 
 the past winter from bad roads, and thinks the present 
 system of road mending in Chester county entirely in- 
 efficient, and the road taxes not judiciously expended, 
 proposes a remedy as follows, which he wishes circulated 
 through the Farm Journal : 

"I propose contracts being made with young men to 
 supply stone as it may be required ; that it be broken 
 up small at the expense of the farmers, and the roads 
 covered to the thickness of six inches with these small 
 stones, thereby filling up all the hollow places and ruts ; 
 (the road to be higher in the middle than the sides) 
 the road to be then covered with a layer of dirt, six 
 inches, to make the road firmer and better to travel 
 upon. 

"You can easily see that in a few years (three or four) 
 what a beautiful road there can be made, which will 
 then be dry, being impervious to water, and gradually 
 "by these alternate layers of stone and dirt" become 
 metamorphised into a turnpike, which, although the first 
 outlay will be greater, can be kept in order at a much 
 less cost than our roads of the present day, on which 
 nothing is returned though much is expended.
