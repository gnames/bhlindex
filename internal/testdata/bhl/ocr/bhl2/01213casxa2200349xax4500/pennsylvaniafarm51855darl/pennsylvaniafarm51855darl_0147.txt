into the yard, for it would take a pit-fall deeper than 
 any farmer would like to have before his barn to hold 
 all the water that comes off such a roof in the course of 
 a year. What falls from the clouds directly ou the heap 
 is sufficient to promote decomposition, and prevent too 
 high fermentation ; and in most cases this amount of 
 moisture is necessary. 

But let the water from the roof be, by all means, con- 
 veyed off. The advantage will more than cover the ex- 
 pense of good tin spouting in one year. As well might 
 our wives expect to succeed in making a kettle of good 
 soap from ashes that have been exposed to the weather, 
 and leached by the water from the roof of some build- 
 ing, as for us to look for a proper return from our fields 
 where we have spread manure that has been drenched 
 by the water from the roof of the barn. And yet there 
 will be no small amount of manure wasted if the yard is 
 not properly fenced. Every yard should be enclosed 
 with a good post and rail fence, with gates large and 
 small for passing in and out with the team, or otherwise. 
 This will confine the cattle and other beasts of the farm 
 so that their excrements will not be scattered all about 
 the premises, which, while it is wasted, is also a nuis- 
 ance. 

We do not hesitate to say that the farmer who will 
 but take the pains, and incur the cost of fixing his yard 
 as suggested in these remarks, will be amply paid in one 
 year by the extra quantity and improved quality of ma- 
 nure he will be able to apply to his land. 

When the manure is left in the yard until the fall of 
 the year, as is usually the case, it often becomes so rot- 
 ten that the yard is not a fit place for beasts to lie or 
 even to stand. 

To prevent this the farmers should have the whole 
 heap well littered over with straw, or leaves from the 
 woods, once every few weeks. This, while it gives a 
 comfortable place for the cattle to rest, also protects the 
 manure, which is now sufficiently decomposed to apply 
 to the land, from the evaporating effects of sunshine and 
 wind. J. H. ALEXANDER.

Hen Manure. 

Mr. Darlington : — If it be in season, in reply to the 
 inquiry of Wm. Hartley, of Bedford Co., Pa., I would 
 say, I have had some experience for several years past, 
 in the saving and application of hen manure to various 
 crops of the field and garden. 

I have used a mixture of hen manure, plaster and 
 ashes, with marked success in parts of my corn field, for 
 some time past. The hen manure should be gathered 
 monthly — weekly is better, and packed away in barrels 
 or boxes, well mixed with some plaster or charcoal to 
 retain the ammonia. When it is to be used, not before, 
 mix it with some ashes, putting in each hill of corn a 
 good handful or more, being careful to cover it with one 
 or two inches of the soil, and I have never known it to 
 "have an injurious effect on vegetation," but ou the con- 
 trary, it gives it an early start, and if the ground is 
 strong enough to perfect the plant in the latter part of 
 the season, no person thus applying it need fear but 
 that he will be well remunerated for his labor, with an 
 abundant harvest. 

You will permit me to say, sir, in this connection, that 
 P., from Muncy, Pa., in the March No. of the Journal, 
 in the application of "Poultry Manure," as he says, 
 "upon hills or beds containing the seeds," will if followed 
 cause many to lose a considerable part of the benefit, 
 which they otherwise might desire from its application, 
 if judiciously applied. 

In his communication, if I do not misunderstand him, 
 he states an important fact as a benefit, which is most 
 certainly a damage, the loss of a part of the fertilizing 
 portions of the manure, "it having decomposed by losing 
 much of its ammonia." By all means cover up, or work 
 into the soil all manures which will part with any quan- 
 tity of ammonia which they contain, by being exposed 
 to the action of the atmosphere.

 Barns and Wintering Stock, 

Mr. Editor: — J. S. K., in the March number of the 
 Journal, speaking of the barns of Pennsylvania, thinks 
 that they are not quite the "thing," as the feed for cat- 
 tle is stored over the stables in which they are stalled. 
 The barns of nortbern Pennsylvania and western New 
 York are constructed differently, and the hay is kept at 
 the extreme end of the barn from the cattle, and often 
 lower than the cattle, still I have frequently seen them 
 refuse to eat as he describes, and nearly starve them- 
 selves, when the hay could not have possibly come in 
 contact with the volatile matter arising from their ex- 
 crements and breath. I consider that it is the course of 
 feeding, instead of the feed, that is the cause. Cattle 
 are kept wholly upon hay without a change until it be- 
 comes unpalatable, therefore they dislike it, and will not 
 eat but enough to sustain them. Should cattle have 
 their feed changed as often as every other day, giving 
 them a feed of cornstalks, straw, or some other coarse 
 feed, it will make the hay relish well, and they will of 
 course eat greedily. Cattle should also have 3alt once or 
 twice a week in winter as well as in summer, and it will 
 tend to give them an appetite. If there is any tendency 
 to scours by frequent salting, mix pulverized alum with 
 your salt, and all works well. Our lumbermen practice 
 mixing alum with their salt for working cattle, and salt 
 them every day, and they do well and eat well.

[We have never known cattle scour with eating salt if 
 they have it always ready of access, whioh they should 
 have. A lump of rock salt should always be in the yard 
 or in their troughs. — Ed.] 

Rye Grass. 
 • J. L. Darlington, Esq. : — At the conclusion of an 
 article on rye grass, in the March number of your val- 
 uable and interesting Journal, you ask for further infor- 
 mation about the varieties of that herb. 

In England they have one variety known as "Dwarf," 
 which appears from the botanical description you give 
 of several varieties to be the same as the one called "L. 
 P. humile, only six or seven inches long." It is always 
 considered the best for grazing purposes, and I_think it
