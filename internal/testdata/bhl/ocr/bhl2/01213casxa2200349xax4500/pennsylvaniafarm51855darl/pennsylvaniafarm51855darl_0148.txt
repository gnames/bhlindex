preferable also for making into hay from this fact, that 
 although much shorter than most others, it throws out a 
 great number of shoots from the root, which makes a 
 thicker and finer quality of hay. 

I have generally found tall, single-stemmed grasses 
 coarse, therefore less nutritious. 

As Sinclair says, Facy's is the one best suited for 
 lawns, &c, but the dwarf is best for general agricul- 
 ture, as you can either graze or mow it, which is a 
 choice all farmers ought to have, as a change of season 
 from wet to dry, or "vice versa," may alter their origi- 
 nal intention with regard to the use they may make of 
 it.' 

The quality of most of the rye grasses I have seen in 
 this country is coarse and long, which I consider a great 
 objection. 

I look upon the best variety of rye grass as next in 
 value to clover, and no pasture, whether for temporary 
 or permanent use, is what it ought to be when it is ex- 
 cluded. 

It is so generally used in England that you seldom 
 see any new pasture without it. 

I consider it as superior to timothy as timothy to 
 straw. It yields more food per acre, and of a better 
 quality ; the soil is also improved by it, while it is dete- 
 riorated by timothy. Yours truly,

For the Farm Journal. 

N. L., of West Fallowfield, in last month's Farm 
 Journal, gives his experience with some rape seed which 
 he received from the Patent Office in the spring of 1853, 
 according to which it got winter killed. This may be 
 owing probably to two causes. The first is, that proba- 
 bly he got from the Patent Office a paper of spring col- 
 za, which, according to his statement, he planted in 
 June, a period too late to sow spring colza or rape, as 
 in most cases it will be winter killed, particularly if the 
 season is severe ; and secondly, unless even winter rape 
 is sown on perfectly drained land, that also will get 
 winter killed, and from the texture of some lands in 
 Chester county, Penna., they retain the moisture in 
 a much greater degree than sandy loams, which suit 
 this crop much better than clays or clayey loams ; the 
 latter are, however, well adapted to it, provided they 
 are well drained if too wet. In proof of which, friend 
 N. L. has only to pay a visit to where I have the winter 
 rape fully growing, after having passed through this last 
 severe and fickle winter season ; although it has been 
 sown under great disadvantages, on unmanured but new 
 land, amongst stumps of trees and bushes, which I had 
 not time to remove, and where the harrow hardly could 
 work. The plants are likewise free from insects, (proba- 
 bly the Jersey breezes drive them into the Atlantic!) The 
 proof of all this is, that they are there ! alive and shoot- 
 ing forth, and that I anticipate a crop of seed to a cer- 
 tainty. At one time it was doubted whether cotton could 
 be grown in the Carolinas and Georgia, or sugar made in 

Louisiana. It's true this was many years ago, never- 
 theless the first growers of cotton and sugar cane were 
 derided and ridiculed by their would-be further-seeing 
 and wiser neighbors ; notwithstanding which they not 
 only did grow them and disappointed the croakers, but 
 now they form two of the most important staples of this 
 continent. With regard to the Englishman in Salem 
 county abandoning it, he had probably his own reasons 
 for it, death or other causes ; however, this has nothing 
 to do with it. I will merely add, that even for fodder it 
 is sown with profit. It is sown for fodder, and par- 
 ticularly in England, Germany, &c, — however, in L.'s 
 opinion, it might be derogatory to follow the example of 
 our cousins over the water, but why not do it in this 
 case as it has been done with almost every other thing 
 in husbandry. True, the climate and localities of differ- 
 ent countries modify and alter in some measure as ex- 
 perience and knowledge dictate ; however, let N. L. per- 
 severe with the rape, doing every thing with care, on 
 proper soil, with suitable seed and in suitable seasons, 
 and no doubt he will be pleased eventually with the re- 
 sults. F. A, N.

Raising Corn. — An Interesting Inquiry. 

Mr. Darlington: — In the March No. of your excel- 
 lent periodical, I find "an inquiry continued" in relation 
 to the subject of raising corn, or why many of the stalks 
 of corn in some fields will begin to assume a stunted ap- 
 pearance about the time it puts out the fourth leaf, and 
 why it continues to appear sickly throughout the whole 
 season, attaining only the height of two or three feet, 
 with striped leaves, and failing to produce any ear. - 

I am not an agriculturist myself, but if any informa- 
 tion that I possess will prove beneficial to this large and 
 worthy class of our community, I shall be highly grati- 
 fied. 

My father is a farmer and I was raised on a farm, and 
 I well remember how our prospects were often blighted 
 by the same disease or enemy referred to in the above 
 inquiry. It always occurred with us when corn had 
 been planted on a clover sod, and by frequent examina- 
 tion we discovered that the main or tap root of the corn 
 had been injured by an insect somewhat resembling the 
 muck worm, only of smaller size. The remedy that 
 proved partially successful was winter ploughing, but 
 the safest plan is to follow clover with wheat and plant 
 corn on a wheat stubble.

Moon-ology ! 
 Mr. Darlington : — At the risk of being sneered and 
 laughed at by those who consider themselves above 
 "learning from the illiterate ;" and who believe knowl- 
 edge to be acquired nowhere out of the schools, — I will 
 reply to the apparently sincere enquiry of Mr. Hugh 
 Hamilton, in the March number of your "Joui'nal," in 
 relation to testing the question of lunar influence, as 
 proposed by C, of Montgomery county, in the August 
 number of 1852 : that an extended trial be made in 
 that year of cutting briars on the last day of the last 
 quarter of the moon, and in the sign of the Heart or
