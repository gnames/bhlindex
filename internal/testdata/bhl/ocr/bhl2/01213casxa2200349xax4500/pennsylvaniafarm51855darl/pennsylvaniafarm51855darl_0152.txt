Entomology. 

Horse-Flies. — The flies that abound in stables in 
 August and September, and sometimes enter houses on 
 the approach of rain, might be mistaken for house-flies, 
 were it not for the severity of their bites, which are of- 
 ten felt through our clothing, and are generally follow- 
 ed by blood. Upon examination they will be found to 
 differ essentially from house-flies in their proboscis, 
 which is very long and slender, and projects horizontally 
 beyond the head. Cattle suffer sorely from the piercing 
 bites of these flies, and horses are sometimes so much 
 tormented and enraged by them as to become entirely 
 ungovernable in harness. The name of this kind of fly 
 is Stomozia calcitrans ; the first word signifying sharp- 
 niouthed, and the second kicking, given to the fly from 
 the effect it produces on horses. It lays its eggs in 
 dung, where its young are hatched, and pass through 
 their transformations. The larvae and pupae do not 
 differ much in appearance from those of common house- 
 flies. 

Meat-Fly. — The large, buzzing meat-fly, named Mus- 
 ca ( Calliphora) vomitoria, is of a blue-black color, with a 
 broad, dark blue, and hairy hind body. It is found all 
 summer about slaughter-houses, butchers' stalls, and 
 pantries, which it frequents for the purpose of laying 
 its eggs on meat. The eggs are commonly called fly- 
 Wows ; they hatch in two or three hours after they are 
 laid, and the maggots produced from them come to their 
 growth in three or four days, after which they creep 
 away into some dark crevice, or burrow in the ground, 
 if they can get at it, turn to egg-shaped pupae, and come 
 out as flies, in a few days more ; or they remain un- 
 changed through the winter, if they have been hatched 
 late in the summer. A smaller fly, of a brilliant blue- 
 green color, with black legs, also lays its eggs on meat, 
 but more often on dead animals in the fields. 

Cheese-Fly. — The well-known cheese-maggots (skip- 
 pers) are the young of a fly (Piophila casei), not more 
 than three-twentieths of an inch long, of a shining black 
 color, with the middle and hinder legs mostly yellowish, 
 and the wings transparent like glass. 

House-Fly. — The house-fly of this country has been 
 supposed to be the same as European Mu'sca domestica ; 
 but I cannot satisfy myself on this point for the want of 
 specimens from Europe. It is possible that our sharp- 
 biting stable-flies, the meat-flies, and the house-fly, may 
 really be distinct species from those which are found in 
 Europe. Our house-fly is the Musca Harpia, or Harpy- 
 fly, of my "Catalogue." It begins to appear in houses 
 in July, becomes exceedingly abundant in September, 
 aud does not disappear till killed by cold weather. It 
 is probable that, like the domestic fly of Europe, it lays 
 its eggs in dung, in which its larvae live, and pass 
 through their changes of form. — Dr. Harris. 

Keeping Poultry in Large Numbers. 
 Luther Tucker, Esq. : — In the Country Gentleman 
 of 25th inst., D. H. R., of Hartford, Conn., wants to 
 know how to build a chicken house for "about 1,000 
 fowls." If my poor opinion is worth any thing, he will 
 not build it at all. Fowls, in any large number, will not 
 thrive unless they have a wide range. They are, par- 
 tially, a grazing animal. When the ground is bare of 

snow, in winter, they pick the grass if they can get it, 
 and are fond of green vegetables of any kind. In sum- 
 mer they pick and eat grass every day. They are great 
 scavengers after slugs, insects, and all kinds of flesh. 
 They are better, also, for having some flesh food in win- 
 ter ; and abundant air, fresh and pure, they must have 
 always. Although I have seen it tried, I never knew a 
 large collection of several hundred fowls succeed in a 
 confined place. 

A few years ago some enterprising man from the coun- 
 try came near town, and enclosed an acre or two of ground 
 with a high picket fence, and put up a building, at an 
 expense of near or quite a thousand dollars, intending 
 to supply eggs for the Buffalo market. He had his barn 
 well done off with any quantity of roosts, nesting places, 
 and other conveniences. He started his concern with 
 seven or eight hundred chickens, and for a few weeks, 
 crowing, cock-fighting, laying and cackling went on to 
 his heart's content. He had food of all kinds for them 
 and great anticipations were indulged of fortune-making 
 in his chicken enterprise. But three or four winter 
 months told the story. The fowls got diseased — the 
 hens first eat the feathers off the roosters — or what were 
 left of them after they had fought themselves almost 
 bare, and then the hens unfleeced, in the same way, each 
 other. They stopped laying, were tormented with lice, 
 got the "roup," went moping about the place, and died 
 off like a pestilence ; and by spring, but a few misera- 
 ble, sickly things were left, with scarce life enough in 
 them to crow up the morning ! 

The difficulty was not in want of food nor care. But, 
 from the necessity of the case, they were crowded in 
 their roosts ; they were disturbed by each other in 
 their nests, and had not room enough any where, even 
 with the outside range of an acre of land. The truth 
 is, that to flourish, hens must have their liberty, when 
 kept in large numbers. They want to range the fields 
 by day and not be crowded at night. They want a »a» 
 riety of food and to help themselves to it. They need ex- 
 ercise, pure air, and enough of both. I knew one man, 
 or rather the man's wife, in the Sciota Valley in Ohio, 
 who kept five or six hundred fowls — that is, she told me 
 she had that many — and I don't doubt it, for the whole 
 territory, for acres about the farm, was speckled with 
 them by day, and the trees and the corn-cribs and the 
 barns and the sheds were filled with them at night 
 They had a great big farm of a thousand acres, or more, 
 and full corn cribs for many rods in length, where the 
 hens went at pleasure, and they made nests under the 
 trees, and among the bushes, and all about the build- 
 ings, and in the back kitchen, and just where they had 
 a mind to : and they sat on their eggs and hatched out 
 their chickens at will — a self-sustaining poultry estab- 
 lishment, in fact. This plan worked ; but as to the 
 profit of it, I doubt whether the old lady could give any 
 intelligible account in the matter. 

No ; I believe the only way to make poultry profitable 
 is to keep them in the "old way." Proportion the num- 
 ber to the ground and buildings you have. Give them 
 liberty to run at large for a portion of each day in 
 warm weather, with comfortable quarters in winter, and 
 pure air, always. I have known sundry other enter- 
 prises, like the Buffalo one I mention, tried ; but I never
