The Greatest Grain Market in the World. 

In the progress of our city and of the West generally, 
 facts of the most astounding character not unfrequently 
 come upon us unawares, and before we are prepared for 
 them. If any one had asked us, two days ago, which of 
 the great grain depots of the world (depots at which 
 grain is collected directly from the producer,) was the 
 largest, we probably would have named half a dozen be- 
 fore hitting the right one. If the same question were 
 put to each of our readers, we doubt if any one of the 
 whole number could answer it correctly, nor do we be- 
 lieve that any one of the whole number would credit the 
 correct' answer to the query, unless it was sustained by 
 an array of figures, the truth of which could not be 
 questioned. Our attention was called to this subject 
 yesterday by a gentleman engaged in the grain business 
 in this city, and with his assistance, we have given it a 
 thorough investigation, the result of which, greatly to 
 our surprise and gratification, establishes the supremacy 
 of Chicago as a grain port over all other ports of the 
 world ! That there may be no ground for incredulity, 
 we proceed to lay before our readers the statistics, 
 gleaned from authentic sources, which confirm this 
 statement. In the table which follows, we have in all 
 cases reduced flour to its equivalent in wheat, estima- 
 ting five bushels of the latter to one of the former. The 
 exports from the European ports are an average for a 
 *" series of years — those of St. Louis for the year 1853, 
 those for Chicago and Milwaukie for the current year, 
 and those for New York are for the past eleven months 
 of the same year. With these explanations we invite 
 attention to the following table : 

Wheat. Ind. Corn. Oats, Rye, Total, 
 bush. bush. Barley. bush. 

Odessa, 5,600,000 1,440,000 7,040,000 

Galatz & Ibrelia, 2,400,000 5,600,000 320,000 8,320,000 
 Dantzig, 3,080,000 1,328,000 4,408,000 

St. Petersburg, all kinds. 7,200,000 

Archangel, 2,528,009 

Riga, 4,000,000 

St. Louis, 3,082,000 918,384 1,081,078 5,081,468 

Milwaukie, 2,723,574 181,937 841,650 3,747,161 

New York. 5,802,452 3,627,888 9,430,335 

Chicago, 2,946,922 6,745,588 5,034,216 13,726,728 

By comparing the exports of the different places 
 mentioned in the above table, it will be seen that the 
 grain exports of Chicago exceed those of New York, by 
 2,496,393 bushels, those of St. Louis by more than two 
 hundred and fifty per cent., and those of Milwaukie 
 nearly four hundred per cent. Turning to the great 
 granaries of Europe, Chicago nearly doubles St. Peters- 
 burg, the largest, and exceeds Galatz and Ibrelia com- 
 bined, 5,406,727 bushels. 

Twenty years ago Chicago, as well as most of the 
 country from whence she now draws her immense sup- 
 plies of breadstuffs, imported both flour and meat for 
 home consumption — now she is the largest primary grain 
 depot in the world, and she leads all other ports of the 
 world, also, in the quantity and quality of her beef ex- 
 ports ! ! We say the largest primary grain depot in the 
 world, because it cannot be denied that New York, Liv- 

erpool, and some other great commercial centres, receive 
 more breadstuffs than Chicago does in the course of a 
 year, but none of them will compare with her, as we 
 have shown above, in the amount collected from the 
 hands of the producers. 

What a practical illustration the above facts afford as 
 to the wonderful, the scarcely credible, progress of the 
 West — what an index it furnishes to the fertility of her 
 soil, and to the industrious and enterprising character of 
 her people — what a prophecy of the destiny that awaits 
 her, when every foot of her long stretches of prairie and 
 her rich vallies shall be reduced to a thoroughly scien- 
 tific tillage ! How long, at this rate, will it be before 
 the centre of population and of wealth will have arrived 
 at the meridian line of our city, and Chicago will have 
 vindicated her right to be recognized as the great com- 
 mercial metropolis of the United States ? We verily 
 believe such is the destiny that awaits her. — Free

* Preserving Flour and Meal. 

The patented plan of Thomas Pearsall, of Hooper's 
 Valley, N. Y., for preserving flour, meal and grain, from 
 heating and souring, by having an open pipe running 
 through the centre of a barrel of flour and meal, or a 
 number of such tubes in bins of grain, we have tested 
 and found to be an excellent invention. A barrel of In- 
 dian corn meal put up in May last, with one of his re- 
 frigerating tubes, is now as sweet as it was on the day 
 it was packed. This improvement must lead to a great 
 saving to our country, as it is calculated that no less 
 than $5,000,000 is lost annually by the souring of flour 
 and the heating of grain in piles, — much, if not all, of 
 which may be saved by the application of this invention, 
 which is neither complex nor expensive, but simple and 
 cheap. A barrel of corn meal, packed in one of Pear- 
 sail's patent tubular barrels, arrived in this city on the 
 7th of this month from Louisville. It was put wp in 
 July, and shipped to New Orleans, was kept several 
 weeks in the hold of a steamboat, and afterwards housed 
 in a warehouse until about the 1st of December, and yet 
 is now perfectly sweet. — Scientific American. 

Quinces for Pickles. 
 I noticed in one of the late numbers of the Farmer, 
 that you say that quinces are used only as a preserve. 
 It is perhaps unknown to your readers that they make 
 a very agreeable pickle, if boiled in vinegar, with brown 
 sugar, to which are added cloves, cinnamon, &c. Even 
 when they have been unluckily hard frozen, they will 
 answer for this purpose — only less sugar will be then re- 
 quired. They are quartered and pared and the cores 
 cut out. Ten pounds of fruit are boiled to which add five 
 pounds of sugar and from three to five pints of vinegar, 
 one ounce of whole cinnamon and half an onnee of whole 
 cloves, and boil down, place in a jar and pour the hot 
 syrup upon it. With many, the quince, baked like an 
 apple, is a favorite, adding syrup or molasses and water 
 to the dish in which they are baked. Those fond of a 
 tart baked apple, will probably be pleased with the baked 
 quince, and much prefer it.
