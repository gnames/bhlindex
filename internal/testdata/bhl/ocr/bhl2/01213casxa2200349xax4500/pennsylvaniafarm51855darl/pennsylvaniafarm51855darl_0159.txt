of its apparent contradiction of the last-mentioned law, 
 and also from its being a very constant agent in the produc- 
 tion of the evils that it is the object of drainage to coun- 
 teract. Capillary attraction is that property of matter which 
 enables water in small tubes or spaces to rise above its 
 common level. The most simple example is the ascent of 
 water in a sponge. Place a sponge on a glass of water with 
 one end of it just touching the water, and the water will 
 ascend. Take two plates of glass, place their flat sides near 
 each other on the one side, and touching each other on the 
 other [Fig. 3], and then put their ends in water. The water 
 will ascend between the plates and stand with a curved sur- 
 face; the highest part being where the p>lates touch, as in 
 the shaded line of the figure.

In the same wrry, as through a sponge, will water ascend, 
 and be held in suspension by the soil, as is familiarly exem- 
 plified by the ascent of water in a flower-pot from the saucer 
 beneath it. It will equally ascend into the pot whether the 
 latter contains a plant or earth only. 

Capiilary attraction, when drainage, whether natural or 
 artificial, is efficient, becomes valuable in its operation upon 
 the growth of vegetation. But it produces results so vastly 
 extensive and so continuous in their effect, that its impor- 
 tance as a cause of surplus water must not be lost sight of 
 by the drainer when he is investigating the condition of 
 the land. 

Having stated the chief natural laws applicable to the 
 subject, let us briefly refer to their mode of operation.

Of the Inorganic Constituents of Plants. 

Carbonic acid, water, and ammonia, are necessary for the 
 existence of plants, because they contain the elements from 
 which the organs are formed; but other substances are like- 
 wise requisite for the formation of certain organs destined for 
 special functions peculiar to each family of plants. Plants 
 obtain these substances from inorganic nature. In the ashes 
 left after the incineration of plants, the same substances 
 are found, although in a changed condition. 

Many of these inorganic constituents vary according to 
 the soil in which the plants grow, but a certain number of 
 them are indispensable to their developement. 

All substances in solution in a soil are absorbed by the 
 roots of plants, exactly as a sponge imbibes a liquid, and all 
 that it contains, without selection. The substances thus 
 conveyed to plants are retained in greater or less quantity, 
 or are entirely separated when not suited for assimilation. 

Phosphate of magnesia in combination with ammonia is 
 an invariable constituent of the seeds of all kinds of grasses. 
 It is contained in the outer horny husk, and is introduced 
 into bread along with the flour, and also into beer. The bran 
 of flour contains the greatest quantity of it. It is this salt 
 which forms large chrystalline concretions, often amounting 
 to several pounds in weight, in the caicum of horses belong- 
 ing to millers ; and when ammonia is mixed with beer, the 
 same salt separates as a white precipitate. 

Most plants, perhaps all of them, contain organic acids 
 of very different composition and properties, all of which 

10 

are in combination with bases, such as potash, soda, lime of 
 magnesia. These bases evidently regulate the formation of the 
 acids, for the diminution of the one is followed by a decrease 
 of the other : thus, in the grape, for example, the quantity 
 of potash contained in its juice is less, when it is ripe, than 
 when unripe; and the acids under the same circumstances, 
 are found to vary in a similar manner. Such constituents 
 exist in small quantity in those parts of a plant in which 
 the process of assimilation is most active, as in the mass of 
 woody fibre, and their quantity is greater in those organs, 
 whose office it is to prepare substances conveyed to them 
 for assimilation by other parts. The leaves contain more 
 inorganic matters than the branches, and the branches more 
 than the stem. The potato plant contains more potash be- 
 fore blossoming than after it. 

The acids found in the different families of plants are of 
 various kinds ; it cannot be supposed that their presence 
 or peculiarities are the result of accident. The fumaric and 
 oxalic acids in the liverwort, the kinovic acid in the China 
 nova, the rocellic acid in the Rocella tinctoria, the tartaric 
 acid in grapes, and the numerous other organic acids, must 
 serve some end in vegetable life. But if theso acids con- 
 stantly exist in vegetables, and are necessary to their life, 
 which is incontestable, it is equally certain that some alka- 
 line base is also indispensable in order to enter into combi- 
 nation with the acids which are always found in the state of 
 salts. All plants yield by incineration, ashes containing 
 carbonic acid; all therefore must contain salts of an organic 
 acid. 

Now, as we know the capacity of saturation of organic 
 acids to be unchanging, it follows that the quantity of the 
 bases united Vvith them cannot vary, and for this reason the 
 latter substances ought to be considered with the strictest 
 attention both by the agriculturist and physiologist. 

We have no reason to believe, that a plant in a condition 
 of free and unimpeded growth produces more of its peculiar 
 acids than it requires for its own existence ; hence, a plant 
 on whatever soil it grows, must contain an invariable quan- 
 tity of alkaline bases. Culture alone will be able to cause 
 a deviation. 

In order to understand this subject clearly, it will be 
 necessary to bear in mind, that any one of the alkaline 
 bases may be substituted for another, the action of all being 
 the same. Our conclusion is, therefore, by no means endan- 
 gered by the existence of a particular alkalic in one plant, 
 which may be absent in others of the same species. If this 
 inference be correct, the absent alkali or earth must be sup- 
 plied by one similar in its mode of action, or in other words, 
 by an equivalent of another base. The number of equiva- 
 lents of these various bases, which may be combined with a 
 certain portion of acid, must necessarily be the same, and, 
 therefore, the amount of oxygen contained in them must 
 remain unchanged under all circumstances, and on what- 
 ever soil they grow. 

Of course, this argument refers only to those alkaline 
 bases, which in the form of organic salts form constituents 
 of the plants. Now, these salts are preserved in the ashes 
 of plants, as carbonates, the quantity of which can bo easily 
 ascertained. 

It has been distinctly shown by the analyses of De Saus- 
 sure and Berthier, that the nature of a soil exorcises a 
 decided influence on the quantity of the different metallic 
 oxides contained in the plants, which grow on it; that mag- 
 nesia, for example, was contained in the ashes of a pine 
 tree grown at Mont Breven, whilst it was absent from the 
 ashes of a tree of the same species from Mont La Salle, 
 and that even the proportion of lime and potash was very 
 different.
