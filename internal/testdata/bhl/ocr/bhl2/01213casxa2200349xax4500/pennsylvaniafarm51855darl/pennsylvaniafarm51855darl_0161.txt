I took the six for trial. This statement may be found re- 
 corded in full, in the Transactions of the New York State 
 Agricultural Society, 1844, page 215. 

"I had one cow, "Young Willey," that produced in seven 
 days, 13i lbs. of buttor. I sold a two year old heifer, called 
 "Ruby," daughter of the above, to S. P. Chapman, of Mad- 
 ison county, N. Y. He put this heifer on trial, when five 
 or six years old to compete for a premium offered by the 
 society above named, for the largest quantity of butter made 
 from one cow in ten days in June, and ten days in August 
 1850, to be fed on grass pasture only. She produced a 
 fraction over forty pounds of butter in these twenty days, 
 and was awarded the first premium. 

"Another cow I called 'Eunice 1st' I had her milk, the 
 produce of one day measured, and the result was thirty-two 
 quarts wine measure. Eunice 2d produced in one day, 
 thirty-four and a half quarts of milk, and there had previ- 
 ously been made from her milk, nineteen and a half pounds 
 of butter in seven days. Beside the tribes of which the 
 above were members, I had others of superior milking qual- 
 ities, which I could refer to, and I doubt not there could 
 be selected from the numerous herd of Shorthorns in this 
 country, equally good milkers with those referred to. 

"I do not desire to mislead any one in this matter, and 
 therefore it is proper to say, that although it is a generally 
 received maxim in cattle breeding that 'like begets like,' 
 yet there may, and probably will be individual exceptions 
 to this rule, relative to the milking qualities of the progeny 
 of every animal bred from such cows. My experience is, 
 that it is rare that a failure will occur, when uniform good 
 milkers are bred to a male descended from an equally good 
 milking stock. Hence it will be seen that the selection of 
 the male is all important, when milking qualities are sought. 
 "I entertain the opinion, that cows, heifers or steers, reared 
 from cows, possessing fine milking qualities, will, when 
 needed for the shambles, put on flesh as fast, and with as 
 little expense, as those not in possession of good capacities 
 for milk. 

"The milking and fattening qualities of the Shorthorns, 
 (and those two qualities constitute the value of this, or any 
 other breed,) are to be found in great perfection in most of 
 the herds of the country in separate animals. By com- 
 mingling these, there could be presented to the country a 
 breed of animals of great value. 

"In conclusion I remark, that it seems to me that there 
 is another good reason for not attempting to improve by 
 crossing, as the Shorthorns are a well established breed, 
 perfected by a long course of scientific breeding, with pedi- 
 grees, for many generations recorded in the herd book, 
 which will always prove a great convenience to such as may 
 keep and breed the Shorthorn for dairy purposes," — Ohio

Knox's Patent Horse Hoe 

This Hoe justly ranks amongst the most important recent 
 agricultural inventions. Its shape may be understood by con- 
 ceiving of the handles and beam of an ordinary plow, having 
 two pieces of wood running backward from its sides, letter A 
 fashion, at a point near the place where the horse is to be 
 attached to the beam. At the point of the main beam, in 
 which these two sides meet, is a cimetar cutter or colter, the 
 office of which is merely to enter the ground and steady the 
 machine during its action. At each of the other extremities 
 of the two arms formed by the letter A is a miniature plow. 
 In the rear of the main beam, and directly under the handles 
 is placed a V shaped share, point forward. Upon the rear 
 of the wings of this share are teeth, each tooth being about 
 three inches long, and projecting backward. A wheel and 

regulating clevis are placed upon the front of the beam to 
 which the horse or mule may be attached. 

The action of this implement may readily be understood. 
 The cimetar cutter, as already stated, steadies it; the minia- 
 ture plows throw the soil to the centre, and the comb again 
 distributes it. Let it be borne in mind that in the planting 
 of corn the rows should be straight, and the Horse Hoe used 
 before the weeds grow too large; this is also true of other 
 crops. In hoeing corn it should be passed down the side of 
 one row, and then above that of the next in order, through 
 the length of the field, and afterwards crosswise in the same 
 manner. It is generally used with the mould boards side in, 
 for other crops as well as corn, unless it be desired to throw 
 the soil against the plants, flat cultivation being now more 
 generally adopted. The amount of labor necessary for its 
 cultivation when the common plow and hand hoes only are 
 used, deters many from giving this important crop the care 
 it so justly deserves. 

This implement of Mr. Knox, which is now being manu- 
 factured by Messrs. Ruggles, Nourse, Mason & Co., of Wor- 
 cester, Mass., may truly be called a labor-saving machine, 
 for by its use with the assistance of a single horse or mule a 
 farmer may hoe as much corn in a single day, and do it as 
 well, provided the rows are straight, as could be accomplished 
 by twenty men by means of ordinary hand hoes. 

It is known that in seasons of drought the frequent use of 
 the hand hoe not only keeps down weeds but prevents crops 
 from suffering as much as they would otherwise do during 
 hot summer weather. The cause of this may be readily un- 
 derstood. During the most parching days of summer there is 
 watery vapor in the atmosphere; air, in its passage through 
 a well disintegrated soil not only is more freely admitted, 
 but deposits alarger amount of moisture than if the soil was 
 compact for want of cultivation, and this deposition takes 
 place whenever the soil is at a lower temperature than the 
 supernatant atmosphere. That the moisture spoken of is 
 present, can readily be proved by a simple experiment. Let 
 an uncorked empty bottle be exposed in open air during one 
 of the hottest days of summer, and after the bottle shall 
 have become thoroughly dried, and even considerably heated 
 by the sun's rays, if it be then hermetically sealed and car- 
 ried to an ice-house, before it shall have been there a single 
 moment, globules of water will be seen to trickle down its 
 inside in consequence of being surrounded by air of a low 
 temperature, showing beyond the possibility of a doubt, the 
 existence of watery vapor in the atmosphere during those 
 seasons of the year when vegetation seems most to need 
 refreshing and general showers. This phenomenon may also 
 be observed when a cold pitcher is brought into a hot room; 
 for in this case too, watery vapor may be seen deposited 
 over its immediate surface. The question then that naturally 
 presents itself to the mind of the agriculturist, is: — How 
 can this watery vapor be made avaflable to growing crops. 
 The answer is, disintegrate the soil to a sufficient depth and 
 no crop will suffer from drouth. Many years have elapsed 
 since there was so favorable an opportunity of witnessing 
 this fact practically tested on so grand a scale as during the 
 past season; for through the length and breadth of the land 
 there seemed to be poured forth with one accord an anxious 
 desire for even as much rain as would moisten the parched 
 earth. Never, therefore, was there so ample an opportunity 
 for testing practically some important truths in scientific 
 agriculture ; for no crops suffered from drouth grown on 
 soils, properly under-drained, where such was needed, as 
 well as deeply surface, and sub-soiled plowed, and the imme- 
 diate surface frequently disintegrated by Knox's Patent 
 Horse Hoe, or other cultivator, in its absence. In corrobo- 
 tion of this I would state that during the past season I
