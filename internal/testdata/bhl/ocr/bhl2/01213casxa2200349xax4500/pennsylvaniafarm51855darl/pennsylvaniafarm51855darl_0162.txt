An Experiment in Deep Digging. 

Last spring we took a corner of an old garden spot, 
 which, though it had always been liberally manured and 
 plowed as well as such a piece of ground could be, and 
 to put it in a condition for fruit trees, we gave a good 
 dressing of manure, and a thorough spading to the full 
 depth of an unworn spade, the longest we could find 
 in the market. In this spading operation, we often 
 came in contact with a subsoil so stiff that it offered a 
 strong resistance to the spade ; still the spade was put in 
 at the cost of much physical exertion. The old soil and 
 manure were laid in the bottom of the trench, and the 
 heterogenous and apparently sterile material on which it 
 had reposed, were placed upon the surface. This new 
 earth, upon much of which the sun had never shone, and 
 the dew had never fertilized, was, in due time, planted 
 with garden vegetables — not, however, in expectation of 
 much crop, for the very surface gave almost positive as- 
 surance that such things would never grow there. They 
 were sown and planted to furnish a motive for a contin- 
 ued tillage through the season, and in addition, the 
 ground was planted out with dwarf Pear trees. The 
 season in our region, as in many other sections of the 
 country was one of distressing drouth — but very little 
 rain from May to October — and, in consequence, the 
 ground on this patch was probably oftener and more 
 thoroughly hoed than it would have been, had the dews 
 and rains fulfilled their labors as usual. 

We now speak of the result. Our Pear trees (some 
 twenty) on this patch, not only lived but made a desire- 
 able growth ; and as for the vegetables — Melons, Cucum- 
 bers, Tomatoes, &c, &c, to the end of the catalogue — 
 they gave us a crop superior to any we had raised for 
 years. 

From this operation we infer, in the first place, that 
 deep and thorough tillage, and frequent stirring of the 
 earth, are good preventives of the effect of drouth. 
 The deeper and better pulverised the soil, the greater its 
 power of absorption ; consequently whenever there is 
 much moisture in the atmosphere, such lands are certain 
 to attract their full share of it. It is so, also, with the 
 vegetable-nourishing gasses which the air from time to 
 time contains. Such lands also suffer less in rainy sea- 
 sons from excessive moisture, for the same qualities which 
 enable them to absorb when there is a scarcity, enable 
 them to throw off when there is a superabundance. 

In the second place, deep and thorough tillage proves, 
 to us, conclusively that the productive powers of earth 
 are not always as nearly exhausted as many strive to 
 imagine, but that the vile skinning, skimming system — 
 the plowing three, four and five inches deep — is what in- 
 duces the sterility which so many lament. Any clayey 
 soil — and they are among the best for many purposes — 
 may be made as barren as the desert of Sahara by such 
 a system. Plow shallow and the earth under the furrow 
 will lose the influence of the two essentials of fertility, 
 sunshine and air, and will, of course, become cold, com- 
 pact, and barren. Roots will avoid such earth ; or, if 
 they make an effort to penetrate it, it will be like at- 

tempting to extend themselves into a rock to meet the in- 
 vigorating influence of an iceberg. 

In tree-culture — especially in growing fruit trees — 
 even a tolerable degree of success cannot be realized un- 
 less shallow stirring of the earth is given up and the earth 
 stirred deep. Trees may, as we have seen, sometimes live 
 in such shallow soils, but they will be stinted, sickly, 
 and produce but ordinary fruit ; but it is more often the 
 case they die in the effort to live, and then comes the 
 bitter denunciations on the nurseryman who reared them, 
 the adverse climate, and sometimes the locality, and even ' 
 the soil which, under favorable culture, would be just 
 the thing for them, is blamed for the lack of those qual- 
 ities which man in his indolence, or grasping after pres- 
 ent gain, has taken from it, — William Bacon. — Hor-

Lectures on Veterinary Science. 

Extract from a lecture delivered by Dr. Dadd: 

After alluding to the cause, nature and treatment of 
 colic, the doctor stated that the bots originated from 
 the larva of the gad fly, which being deposited on the 
 sides and fore extremities of the horse in the form of nits, 
 are licked off by the tongue of the horse, and thus pass 
 into the stomach, and finally assume the form of a full 
 grown hot, and that when capable of exercising an inde- 
 pendent life, they leave the stomach, their natural habit- 
 ation, by the alimentary passage and rectum, burrow into 
 the earth and there undergo a sort of metamorphosis, 
 acquire wings, and in their turn deposit nits, and thus 
 perpetuate the species. 

He proved, beyond a doubt, that they seldom do any 
 harm, and quoted from authorities to their general in- 
 nocuousness. That while in the stomach they cannot 
 produce pain as is generally supposed, because they are' 
 located on the cuticular division, a portion of the stom- 
 ach as insensible as the lining of the membrane of the 
 fowl's gizzard, and that if ever found to have burrowed 
 through the walls of the stomach into the abdominal 
 cavity, they were there from the force of circumstances, 
 occurring in the death of the horse, from peculiar causes, 
 or from drenching the animal with strong medicine or 
 poison. 

If a horse happens to have a sudden attack of colic, or 
 any other acute disease, and should turn his head towards 
 the side, expressive of the pains and agony experienced, 
 many people jump at the conclusion, that the horse is 
 afflicted with bots, and all the "Know Somethings" seem 
 to favor the opinion, and will scarcely believe otherwise; 
 but this results from that backward mode of reasoning, 
 that compels us to look upon the error, rather than em- 
 brace the light of science. 

The horse may be destroyed by powerful medicines, 
 but the bot being the monarch of his own domicil, the 
 stomach, can refuse the dose you offer him. 

The best way to rid the horse of the bots, is to turn 
 him into a pasture in the spring, at which time the b< t 
 comes to maturity, and will then vacate his stronghold. '•, 

Bots cannot be killed by poisons, for they will live and 
 grow fat on turpentine, and even on some of the mineral 
 acids, so that it is folly to attempt their expulsion. 

It was proved that all animals as well as man, are more 
 or less pestered with various kinds of parasites, and
