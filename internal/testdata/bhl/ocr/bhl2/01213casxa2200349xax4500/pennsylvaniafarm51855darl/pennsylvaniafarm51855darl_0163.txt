they seldom do harm. That the pig was often infested 
 with animalculce, so that its body was surcharged with 
 the same, and this gave to pork that peculiar appearance 
 known as measles. 

The lecture was concluded with some very interesting 
 remarks on animal physiology. After which, at the re- 
 quest of persons present, the anatomy and physiology of 
 the foot, and the various methods of shoeing were dis- 
 cussed. 

At the conclusion a vote of thanks was passed in favor 
 of Dr. Dadd, for his instructive and interesting course of 
 lectures. 

It was remarked by Dr. Tewksbury, that a farmer 
 might gain more practical information in one of these lec- 
 tures, than he could in any other way, consequently it 
 was to the interest of the farmer to encourage this sort 
 of public teaching. 

The color is of a rich crimson. The surface of the fruit 
 is smooth and glossy. Seed— considerably indented. 
 Flavor — superior; good judges who have tested it think 
 it is not surpassed. It has ripened the eighth day of 
 June for the last two years. 

This strawberry will commend itself by its earliness 
 and hardiness, by its beauty and high flavor, by its being 
 an extraordinary and prolific bearer, and on account of 
 the size and evenness of its berries. — Joseph Bekck,

A Description of the Jenny Lind Seedling Strawberry. 
 There are so many new things constantly brought up 
 before the horticultural world, and so much humbug 
 about a great majority of them, that it is with diffidence 
 I present to the public a description of the Jenny Lind 
 Seedling Strawberry. It has been exhibited for three suc- 
 cessive seasons in the Massachusetts Horticultural Soci- 
 ety" rooms, and the writer, a member of the Fruit Com- 
 mittee, has had frequent opportunities to test and compare 
 it with other varieties. It is entirely distinct from any 
 other sort in cultivation here. It possesses many excel- 
 lences, and in my humble opinion, is worthy of general 
 cultivation. One of our first confectioners, who deals 
 largely in ice creams, and who has used these as well as 
 other varieties to flavor them with, says it is the best 
 sort grown for that purpose. This speaks well for its 
 flavor. The Fruit Committee have repeatedly recom- 
 mended it; and gentlemen who have seen it speak in 
 high terms of its appearance, and would gladly have 
 paid a high price to be in possesion of it ; but as yet 
 the originator, Mr. Isaac Fay, of Cambridgeport, has 
 kept it in his own hands. It will, however, be for sale 

this spring. 

The seed from which it was obtained, was from a cross 
 of Mr. Fay's old seedling and the Early Virginia. 
 Fay's old seedling was a large strawberry but little 
 known, and not considered equal to some other seedlings, 
 and did not receive much attention, but possessed some 
 good qualities, particularly the size. The Jenny Lind 
 does not come up in size to this seedling, but is larger 
 than the Early Virginia, and a most abundant bearer, 
 ripening full as early, and equal to it in sweetness, if not 
 superior. Out of more than two thousand plants ob- 
 tained from seed, sown five years since, this one alone 
 produced fruit the following summer ; and it has contin- 
 ued to bear and increase in its good qualities ever since, 
 flourishing equally in the shade as in the sun — some of 
 the best fruit and plants having been under the thick 
 foliage of fruit trees. 

The plant is very hardy, with luxuriant foliage send- 
 ing out strong, stout runners. The leaves are quite 
 large on tall stems, and more serrated than common va- 
 rieties. The blossoms are staminate ; nearly all set fruit 
 and form well developed berries. The fruit averages well 
 as to size, quite large, solid, of a fine conical shape, 

Bee Keeping, 
 Putting on and Taking off Boxes: — Putting on 
 boxes may be considered a duty intermediate between 
 spring and summer management. I cannot recommend 
 putting them on as early as the last of April, or first of 
 May, in ordinary circumstances. It is possible to find a 
 case that it would be best. But before the hive is full of 
 bees it is generally useless, and very likely a disadvantage, 
 by allowing a portion of animal heat to escape, that is 
 needed in the hive to mature the brood. Also, moisture 
 may accumulate until the inside moulds, &c. Some ex- 
 perience and judgment is necessary to know about what 
 time boxes are needed. That boxes are needed at the 
 proper season, I think I shall' not need an argument to 
 convince any one in the present day. Bee-keepers have 
 generally discarded the babarous practice of killing *he 
 bees to obtain the honey. Many of them have learned 
 that a good swarm will store sufficient honey for winter, 
 besides several dollars worth as profit in boxes. 

Advantage of the Patent Vender : — Here is where 
 the patent vender has taken the advantage of our igno- 
 rance, by pretending that no other hive but his ever ob- 
 tained such quantities, or so pure in quality. 

Time of Putting on — Rule: — It is probable a great 
 many readers will need the necessary observation to tell 
 precisely when the hive is full of honey ; it may be full 
 of bees and not of honey. And yet the only rule that I 
 can give to be generally applied, is, when the bees begin 
 to be crowded out, but a day or two before would be just 
 the right time, that is, when they are obtaining honey — 
 (for it should be remembered that they do not always get 
 honey when beginning to cluster out). This guide will 
 do in place of a better one, which close observation and 
 experience only can give. By observing a glass hive at- 
 tentively, in those cells that touch the glass on the edge 
 of the combs, whenever honey is being deposited here 
 abundantly, it is quite evident that the flowers are yield- 
 ing it just then, and other stocks are obtaining it also. 
 Now is the time, if any cluster out, to put on the boxes. 
 When boxes are made as I have recommended, that is, 
 the size containing 360 solid inches, it is advisable to put 
 on only one at first; when this is full either of bees or 
 honey, and yet bees are crowded outside, the other can 
 be added. This is before swarming; too much room 
 might retard the swarming a few days, but if crowded 
 outside, it indicates want of room and the boxes can 
 make but little difference. It is better to have one box 
 well filled than two half full, which might be the case if 
 bees were not numerous. The obj ect of putting on boxes 
 before swarming, is to employ a portion of the bees that 
 otherwise would remain idly clustering outside two or 
 three weeks, as they often do, while preparing the young
