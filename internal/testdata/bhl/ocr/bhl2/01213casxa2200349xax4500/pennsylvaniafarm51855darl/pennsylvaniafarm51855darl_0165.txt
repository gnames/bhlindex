Nothing short of killing the insects, in some of their forms, 
 will ever prove an effectual remedy. 

The Slug-worm, Tenthredo, or Selandria {Blennocampa) 
 Cerasi, which destroys the leaves of the cherry and of 
 the pear, is also injurious to those of the plum. It is 
 easily killed by dusting ashes or lime upon it, or by throw- 
 ing upon the leaves a solution of whale-oil soap. 

Cheery Tree Insects. — Those which attack the 
 leaves are chiefly canker-worms and slug-worms, already 
 referred to, and rose-bugs, which in some seasons are 
 very injurious to them. The latter, as well as the May- 
 bugs or Melolonthce, may be gathered by hand on small 
 trees, or may be beaten off with poles and caught in 
 sheets spread beneath the trees The best time for doing 
 this is in the evening or very early in the morning, when 
 the insects are sluggish, and readily fall if disturbed. A 
 large proportion of the fruit is spoiled every year by the 
 grubs of the plum-weevil. The incautious eater doubtless 
 does something towards checking the increase of the in- 
 sects; but a remedy less repugnant to good taste remains 
 to be discovered. 

Peach Tree Insects. — The Tomicus liminaris, which 
 lives under the bark of diseased peach trees, and has 
 been supposed by Miss Morris, to be the cause of the 
 yellows, has not appeared in my own trees, nor do I hear 
 of its being found in others in this vicinity. Miss Mor- 
 ris's communication upon it may be seen in Downings's 
 Horticulturist, Vol. IV., page 502. 

The Peach tree borer, (JEgeria exitiosce,) an entirely dif- 
 ferent insect from the apple tree borer, and operating in 
 a different manner, namely, between the bark and the 
 wood is more injurious to this tree than any other insect. 
 Great care is necessary to prevent the tree from being 
 fatally girdled at the roots by these pernicious borers. 
 Frequent application of urine and ashes, and of hot soap 
 suds, around the trunk, seem to have a good effect, 
 being not only offensive to the fly when about to deposit 
 her eggs, but also destructive to the young borers. After 
 any lurking borers and the earth adjacent to the trunk 
 have been carefully removed, a covering of strong paper 
 around the base of the tree, tied above with a string, 
 and secured at the bottom with a bed of mortar, has 
 proved an effectual preventive against the attacks of the 
 insects. I believe that the peach trees on plum stocks 
 are never injured by these borers. 

Natural History of New York, Vol. V. 

"Natural History of New York ; Agriculture of New 
 York, comprising an account of the classification, com- 
 position, and distribution, of the soils and rocks, and of 
 the climate and agricultural productions of the State, 
 together with descriptions of the more common and in- 
 jurious insects, by C. Emmons, M. D., Vol. V., Albany, 
 1854. 

The Legislature of New York State has been very 
 liberal in appropriating money for the purpose of pub- 
 lishing an illustrated report of its Natural History, &c, 
 which has appeared in five quarto volumes. The former 
 volumes we understand have been conducted with great 
 ability, but the fifth by Dr. Emmons, the only one we 
 have had an opportunity of examining, we are constrain- 
 to say has fallen into most incompetent hands, and this 
 part of the work must therefore be a miserable compan- 

ion to those that have preceded it. This is the more 
 lamentable from the fact that the evil of this misappro- 
 priation of money cannot be so easily repaired, and an 
 opportunity has been suffered to pass without having been 
 improved, for there cannot be a doubt that a work on 
 the local entomology of any State or District of our 
 country, with faithful descriptions and accurate illustra- 
 tions would be both useful and interesting to the farm- 
 ers, Horticulturists and others of the whole country. 

When the second edition of Dr. Harris' very excellent 
 and very able "Treatise on Insects injurious to Vegeta- 
 tion" was published, there was only one regret amongst 
 Agriculturalists, Horticulturalists, and amateur or work- 
 ing Entomologists, and that was the absence of illustra- 
 tive figures. But the author was not supported by a 
 State appropriation, and good engravings are expensive 
 appendages. 

The volume under consideration might have furnished 
 the country with what is wanting in Dr. Harris' book, 
 but it has not done this, nor anything else worthy of the 
 Empire State. Instead of being a faithful report on 
 American Entomology, it appears to be merely a compi- 
 lation of scientific descriptions of a few of such insects 
 as are injurious to vegetation, mainly drawn from an- 
 tiquated British sources, and even in this, there is not 
 the proper discrimination made between insects that are 
 injurious and those that are not. 

The figuring and description of European Insects, and 
 publishing them as American species, can be of no ad- 
 vantage to the the student of American entomology, as 
 is the case in many instances in the volume we are con- 
 sidering — particularly such as Clerus apiarius, PI. 2, 
 fig. 8, Chrysomela tremula, PI. 14, fig. 5, and Cicindela 
 campestris, PI. 17, fig. 6, and also others which are com- 
 mon foreign species, long ago and often described and 
 figured, and found in nearly every cabinet collection in 
 this country as well as those abroad. It is evident thai 
 the compiler did not possess the knowledge, that the 
 work he had undertaken required, or he never would 
 have queried and left unnamed the very common and 
 destructive species of Longicornia, on PI. 8, (Clytus col- 
 onus and Clytus erythroccphalus.) 

PL 10. fig. 5, is our very common and very extensive- 
 ly known black "Wood-beetle," Passalus cornutus Fabr., 
 but in the reference it is named Scarites. — It is with 
 much reluctance that we part with this familiar subject 
 of our early entomological associations. About the first 
 too, from its large size, abundance, difficult locomotion, 
 and black glossy coat of mail, that the juvenile ento- 
 mologist becomes acquainted with and is enabled to cap- 
 ture. Still we congratulate him on his elevation to the 
 "higher position," in which the new scale of insect 
 graduation has placed him.* But we are thinking with 
 such an uncongenial associate as Scarites and in the el- 
 ement in which he loves to delve, Passalus will be like a 
 "fish out of water." Passalus is by occupation a car- 
 penter, and both in the larvae and perfect state lives upon 
 and is found only in dead or decaying wood, particular- 
 ly Black oak, whereas Scarites is a digger and lives and 
 matures under ground, hence Subteraneus, the trivial 

*In acknowledged system of classification Passalus is placed amongst 
 the li Lrnia, whereas Srarit^ occupies a position near the head of 
 the c£« «i«<-but it would be tedious to bo h writer and reader to 
 note all blunders of this kind that the hook contains.
