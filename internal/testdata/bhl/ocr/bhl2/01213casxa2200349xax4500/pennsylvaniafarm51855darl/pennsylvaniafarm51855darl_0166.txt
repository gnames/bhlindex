name of our most common species. The former when they 
 occur in large numbers are capable of destroying much 
 oak timber, and therefore may be classed with injurious 
 insects, whereas the latter being predaceous in their 
 habits, may rather be regarded as useful, and therefore 
 insect friends. It is therefore important that their own 
 acknowledged proper names should be associated with 
 each, and their identity preserved intact. 

We claim to be only an amateur in the natural scien- 
 ces, but not the less ardent in our love on that account 
 and especially for entomology. We therefore freely con- 
 fess that our predilection for improved scientific arrange- 
 ment has been not a little offended by the new Generic 
 series of succession as adopted by Dr. Emmons in his 
 system of classification. 

The figures themselves as a general thing are very in- 
 different, some of which are scarcely recognizable, and 
 others little else than the merest caricatures. But one 
 of the worst features, and one that must be humilia- 

ting to a generous mind, is the fact, that whilst it is ac 
 knowledged that the anatomical figures have been mostly 
 copied from the Naturalist's Library, yet on some if not 
 on all of the plates, they are credited to E. Emmons, Jr. 
 The copying of foreign plates to illustrate our local en- 
 tomology is sufficiently discreditable, but for the copyist 
 to affix his own name to them, is a climax in cupidity 
 that sets every consideration of modesty at defiance. 

The volume is devoted to all the orders, but the fore- 
 going remarks refer to only a very few of the many er- 
 rors in the coleopterous series. They will all however 
 receive a passing notice in due time from competent 
 sources. Thus in a practical as well as a theoretical 
 sense, the blunders in this work become conspicuously 
 apparent, its general usefulness impaired if not entirely 
 negatived, and the duty of exposition imperative â€” and 
 therefore for one we enter our solemn protest against 
 its being a reflex of the present condition of entomology 
 n the United States. S. S. R. 

COMBINED MOWING AND HEAPING MACHINE. 

We are indebted to C. B. Rogers, 29 Market Street, 
 for the above cut representing a combined Mower and 
 Reaper, manufactured by him. 

We have not seen it in operation, but Mr. Rogers as- 
 sures us it has been tested for two seasons with entire 
 satisfaction, and has taken the following premiums. 

First premium for Mower, Salem county Fair, 1853, 
 do. Burlington county, 1853, do. Camden and Gloucester, 

1853. Special do. Mower and Reaper, Camden and do. 

1854, First do. Burlington county, 1854. 

First premium for Mower, Berks county, 1 854, do New 
 Castle county, Del., 1854, Silver Medal for Mower, Penn- 
 sylvania State Fair, 1854, do. and Reaper, Pa. do., 1854. 

Ornamental Evergreen Hedges. 
 Judging from its being so rarely seen it would appear 
 not to be generally known, that the common Hemlock, 

Abies Canadensis, answers admirably for hedging pur- 
 poses, bears trimming well, and is we think altogether un- 
 rivalled among evergreens for this purpose. It may be 
 planted either in double or single rows, about ten or 
 twelve inches apart, the latter being preferable, more 
 easily cultivated, and kept clean in its early growth. The 
 habit of the hemlock is rather drooping, which tendency is 
 displayed to great advantage when in the hedge row, and 
 tbe peculiar lively green tint of the young foliage, gives 
 it a most picturesque and graceful appearance unlike any 
 thing else. The American Arbor Vitae, in contrast with 
 the hemlock, is quite stiff and formal, and does not so 
 well retain its green color through the winter. It may, 
 however, answer better where a dense screen is wanted ; 
 the Norway Spruce is preferable, though, for this. The 
 handsomest specimen of Hemlock Hedging probably in 
 this country is at the country seat of Moses Brown,
