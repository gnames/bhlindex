churning process, is retained â€¢within and among the cream 
 and butter, of course affecting its flavor and quality, is 
 with Spain's churn allowed constant escape through the 
 open tube in the lid, while the atmosphere, at the same 
 time has as free ingress. The patentee does not contend 
 that butter will come quite so quickly in his churn, as in 
 some others, which have now and then been for a short 
 time before the public, but that better butter will be made 
 in a shorter time. It is known there is a possibility of 
 butter coming too quickly, so quickly as to be soft and 
 oily without consistence. To make good and firm butter, 
 requires a reasonable time, and a good article cannot be 
 made short of it. Spain's churn, in addition to its peculiar 
 construction also has the reputation of being generally 
 well and strongly made. It comes in sizes, from three 
 dollars and twenty-five cents, to seven dollars and larger 
 ones for horse power are made to order. 

Chauncey P. Holcomb. 

Since our last issue, we have to record the decease of 
 another prominent friend of agricultural improvement 
 and successful practical farmer, Chauncey P. Holcomb, 
 formerly a member of the Philadelphia bar, and represen- 
 tative of this city in the State legislature. He had for 
 the last fifteen years, resided on a farm near New Castle, 
 Delaware, and given his attention entirely to agricultural 
 pursuits. His Devon stock was celebrated all over the 
 country, and has been widely disseminated. He had but 
 recently added to his herd some fresh importations. C. 
 P. Holcomb, also had a high reputation as one of our 
 very best agricultural writers and public speakers, and 
 was frequently called upon for public addresses, which 
 abounded in practical suggestions, and have contributed 
 very much to create a taste for country life and improve 
 the ordinary system of management especially in the 
 improvement of stock. His style of writing and speak- 
 ing was terse, practical, and at the same time fluent, dif- 
 fering in these particulars, most favorably from the 
 rapid and declamatory agricultural addresses of the day, 
 which often begin "with Adam the first tiller of the soil," 
 and end with nothing which a matter of fact farmer can 
 make available. 

In the unexpected death of our friend Holcomb, agri- 
 culture, as well as the social circle in which he moved and 
 of which he was so bright an ornament, will long feel the 
 void. 

Raising Root Crops. 
 We hope none of our readers will let this month pass 
 over without putting in a plentiful crop of roots for next 
 winter's supplies. We believe many will be driven to it 
 who have the past season experienced the cost, of making 
 beef and butter from pure grain, at the present high 
 rates, some of whom perhaps sold rather bare early in 
 the winter under the temptation of high prices and now 
 have to buy at still higher. The prospects for the farm- 
 er were never more flattering than now, but to avail 
 himself fully of them it is indispensible for him to prac- 
 tise a little of what he has been calling book farming, viz: 
 raise root crops, plow deeply, pulverize thoroughly, ma- 
 nure heavily and with such kinds as are adapted for the 
 crop he is raising. Various experiments have proved 
 that at least one third and probably one half less grain 

will do as much good, when fed in conjunction with roots, 
 Carrots, Parsnips, Beets, Ruta Bagas, &c. When cora 
 is worth ninety cents, or one dollar, oats seventy cents, 
 and with a dozen or more cows or steers requiring feed, 
 this saving will be quite an important item. An acre of 
 land under proper culture, will readily produce six hun- 
 dred to one-thousand bushels of roots, and even if sold, 
 what crop will nett more money? Carrots, the past win- 
 ter, and almost any winter have readily commanded fifty 
 cents per bushel, and the demand for them is rapidly 
 increasing as food for horses, at the livery stables. The 
 expense of planting, continued seeding, and cultivation, 
 deters many from root culture. The weeds will grow 
 and require attention when it cannot be spared, but we 
 will now repeat, what Ave have before shown, how this 
 difficulty can be easily avoided, by destroying the weeds 
 before putting in the crop. After the ground has been 
 well plowed which should be very early in the season, the 
 harrow should be passed over repeatedly, at least twice 
 a week so as not only to thoroughly break up and pul- 
 verize all the lumps, but also to kill seeds of weeds just 
 germinating by exposure to the action of the hot sun. 
 If any one will examine his fields before harrowing, par- 
 ticularly if it has been well manured, he will find millions 
 of weeds all over the surface, just sprouting and in a 
 condition to be destroyed, by each successive harrowing. 
 This will not cost a tithe of the expense of their destruc- 
 tion after the crop is planted, and will be done more ef- 
 ectually. 

Meeting of the Executive Committee of the State Agri- 
 cultural Society. 

The first quarterly meeting of the Executive Committee 
 of the Pennsylvania State Agricultural Society, was held 
 at the office of said Society, in Harrisburg on Tuesday, 
 the 17th of April, 1855. 

President of the Society in the chair, Members pres- 
 ent Messrs, James Gowen, H. N. McAllister, A. 0. Heis-

 ford and Robert C. Walker. 

Two communications were received from Chauncey E. 
 Goodrich, of Utica, New York, accompanying a large 
 variety of seedling potatoes which were sent by him for 
 the use of the Society. The potatoes were properly dis- 
 tributed among the members, with a request that a report 
 upon each variety as to their product, and adaptedness to 
 the soils of Pennsylvania, be made at a future meeting 
 The thanks of the Society were voted to Mr. Goodrich. 
 Also communications from Isaac B. Baxter and Frederick 
 Watts, regretting their inability to attend the meeting of 
 the Executive Committee. Also a communication from 
 Peter A. Browne, of Philadelphia, recommending the in- 
 troduction into Pennsylvania, of the "Angora Goat." 
 The letter was authorised to be published in the trans- 
 actions. Also a communication from Joseph Bailey, 
 proposing to sell a tract of land in Perry county, to the 
 trustees of the Farmer's High School of Pennsylvania, 
 which was refered to said trustees. The following com-
