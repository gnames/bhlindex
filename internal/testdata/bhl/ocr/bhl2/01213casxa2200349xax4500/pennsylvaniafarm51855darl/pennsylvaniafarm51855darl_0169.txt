Bellefonte, Feb. 22d, 1855. 

Td the Executive Committee of the Pennsylvania State 
 Agricultural Society. Gentlemen: — Feeling a deep in- 
 terest in the early and efficient organization of the Far- 
 mers' High School of Pennsylvania, I observed with 
 pleasure that the legislature now in session have repealed 
 the act of April 13th, 1854, and passed an act of incor- 
 poration more acceptable to the friends of Agricultural 
 science. But much yet remains to be done. Land sus- 
 ceptible of a high state of cultivation is to be procured, 
 suitable buildings erected, a library, apparatus, &c. pro- 
 vided. The surplus funds of the Pennsylvania State Ag- 
 ricultural Society I fear will be inadequate to this object. 
 Whilst I hope that the legislature will not adjourn with- 
 out making such reasonable appropriation as the interest 
 of this great Agricultural Commonwealth demands, I 
 take this opportunity of proposing through you to the 
 trustees to give the institution a tract of improved land, 
 containing from two hundred to two hundred and fifty 
 acres (the land is good lime stone clay soil situated in 
 Harris township, Centi'e county,) provided the Farmers' 
 High School of Pennsylvania be erected thereon. The 
 tract is pleasantly situated at the junction of the Penn's 
 and Nittany valleys, near the geographical centre of the 
 State, in a rich populous and healthy district and within 
 twenty two miles of the Pennsylvania rail road, at Spruce 
 creek. Whilst such an institution will give such impetus 
 to the agricultural prosperity of the State at large, it will 
 prove especially beneficial to the particular district in 
 : which it shall be established; and I therefore desire its 
 Jjcation in Centre county. If we would add dignity to 
 manual labor, if we would have it held in honor 
 by the community, we must associate it with science; 
 and if we would lessen the expense of acquiring scientific 
 knowledge, so as to bring the cost within the means of the 
 farming community, we must connect its acquisiton with 
 manual labor. These as I understand are leading objects 
 of the Farmer's High School of Pennsylvania, and if as 
 has been suggested, such an institution properly organ- 
 ized, with aid of the surplus funds of your society and a 
 reasonable appropriation from the State, can afford to the 
 young men of Pennsylvania, able and willing to work 
 (when work is required of all, and esteemed honorable) 
 a scientific practical education, at an expense of less than 
 "seventy-five dollars" per annum, it will be productive 
 of benefit to the community, the full extent of which, 
 time only can develope, and future generations only tell. 

I remain very respectfully yours, James Irvin. 

The following resolutions were offered by H. N. McAl- 
 lister, and unanimously agreed to. Resolved, That the 
 thanks of the friends of agricultural science are justly due 
 to Gen. James Irvin, of Centre county, for his generous 
 offer of two hundred or two hundred and fifty acres of 
 laud, to the Farmers' High School of Pennsylvania, on 
 condition that the institution be located thereon. Resolved 
 That the Secretary be, and he is hereby directed to lay 
 before the trustees, the proposition of Gen. Irvin, and the 
 proposition of James Miles, of Erie county, as published 
 in the proceedings of the late annual meeting, together 
 with all similar offers which shall be received prior to 

the meeting of the trustees in June next. Resolved, 
 That in the hope of exciting emulation and inducing sim- 
 ilar propositions from the citizens of other sections of 
 the- State, the above resolutions be published. 

James Gowen, chairman of the committee to prepare 
 a premium list for the next annual exhibition, made re- 
 port which after bein g amended was adopted, and two 
 thousand copies ordered to be printed in phamphlet form. 
 In accordance with the constitution (this being the first 
 quarterly meeting) George H. Bucher, was re-appointed 
 Treasurer, and Robert C. Walker, Recording Secretary 
 for the ensuing year. The correspondence between David 
 Landreth, President of the "Philadelphia Society for 
 Promoting Agriculture," and the Hon. Marshal P. Wilder 
 President of the United States Agricultural Society, 
 upon the subject of the latter Society holding an exhibi- 
 tion in Pennsylvania, was presented by Algernon S. 
 Roberts. The correspondence being before the commit- 
 tee, a resolution was offered by A. S. Roberts, to the 
 effect that the assent of the Pennsylvania State Agricul- 
 tural Society, be given to the United States Agricultural 
 Society, to hold an exhibition this fall in Pennsylvania 
 which gave rise to considerable discussion, and the as- 
 sent refused by a large majority. 

The following committee was appointed to fix the 
 place for the next annual exhibition, and instructed to 
 locate it at Harrisburg, provided the citizens thereof 
 furnish the grounds free of charge, and contribute to the 
 Society within ten days, the sum of fifteen hundred dol- 
 lars : Jacob S. Haldeman, H. N. McAllister, Abram 
 R. McIlvaine, Isaac G. McKinley, Robt. C. Walkek. 

On motion of David Mumma, it was resolved that the 

Corresponding Secretary be requested to correspond with, 

and select a suitable person to deliver the annual address 

at the next exhibition. On motion, committee adjourned.

Book Notices. 

The Pbactical Fruit, Flower and Vegetable Gar- 
 dener's Companion, by Patrick Neill, L. L. D. F. R. 
 S. E., adapted to the United States. Edited by G. Em- 
 erson, M. D., with notes, and additions by R. G. Par- 
 dee; published by Saxton, N. Y., and for sale by D. 
 Landreth, 21 and 23 South 6th st., Philadelphia. Price 
 $1 25. This is an octavo volume of over four hundred 
 pages, illustrated with numerous engravings. The bare 
 mention of the names connected with its publication is 
 of itself a sufficient recommendation. We may say 
 however, that it contains a vast amount of reliable in- 
 formation on the subject of which it treats, and we are 
 convinced after brief cursory examination of its con- 
 tents, that there are few of our most experienced gar- 
 deners and fruit growers, that would not find on pe- 
 rusal, hints of far more value than the price of the vol- 
 ume, while to the novice or to those of limited experi- 
 ence, it must be of great value. 

Cole's American Fruit Book, by Jewett & Co., 
 Boston. Twenty thousand copies have been sold of the 
 above standard work. It has been long and favorably 
 known to Pomologists, and is often refererd to for infor- 
 mation not attainable elsewhere. 

Breck's Book of Flowers, published by Jewett & 
 Co., Boston. This is one of the most valuable treatises 
 in the country on the culture of trees, plants, shrubs, 
 flowers, &c. It should be in the hands of every one
