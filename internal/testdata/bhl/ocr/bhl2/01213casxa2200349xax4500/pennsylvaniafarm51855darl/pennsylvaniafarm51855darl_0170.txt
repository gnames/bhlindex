The Farm School Appropriation. 
 We had hoped to have been able to announce in this 
 number, the fact, that the Legislature had made an appro- 
 priation in aid of the Farmers' High School, but we are 
 compelled to forego this pleasure. AVe are not without hope, 
 however, that it may yet be made before the close of the 
 session. It is difficult to conceive how an intelligent body 
 of gentlemen — the principal portion of whom are the repre- 
 sentatives of the Farming interest, and the remainder rep- 
 resenting constituencies almost as favorable to agricultural 
 improvement as the farmers themselves, — should hesitate 
 one moment in regard to this measure, against the intrinsic 
 merits of which, no single member of either house has been 
 willing to urge an objection. The subject has been brought 
 officially before the Legislature by the following ably writ- 
 ten memorial of the President of the State Agricultural 
 Society, and we repeat, "we are not without hope," that the 
 practical good sense of the members of the General Assem- 
 bly will lead them to make an appropriation, of at least ten 
 thousand dollars for the establishment of the Farmers' High 
 School. 

To the Hon. Wm. 31. Hiester, S})eaker of the Senate: — 
 Sir: — By the recent act of incorporating "The Farmers' 
 High School of Pennsylvania," I was, ex officio, as President 
 of "The Pennsylvania State Agricultural Society," made 
 a Trustee of that Institution. By virtue of this position, 
 and in accordance with the zeal that has so often urged me 
 to efforts in furtherance of the interests of Agriculture, I 
 most respectfully approach your honorable body, and entreat 
 it to take into consideration the expediency of appropriating 
 a fund adequate to the founding of the Farmers' High School, 
 upon a respectable and permanent basis, commensurate with 
 the great interests it is intended to promote, and the dignity 
 and character of the institutions of Pennsylvania. 

The Legislature, in 1851, chartered the State Agricultural 
 Society, and appropriated to its use two thousand dollars 
 annually. Had this grant been withheld, tho charter, in all 
 probability, would have remained to this day a dead letter 
 upon the statue book. So, in like manner, it may be appre- 
 hended, that without adequate pecuniary aid, the charter of 
 tho Farmers' High School may remain inoperative. 

Although the bounty to the State Agricultural Society 
 gave a starting point to the Farmers of Pennsylvania, by 
 enabling the Society to hold agricultural exhibitions, and 
 award premiums to the most commendable specimens of live 
 stock and farm products ; and although these exhibitions 
 were as successful as their most sanguine friends could have 
 hoped, yet they could accomplish but little more than the 
 stirring up a laudable rivalry among the few exhibitors, 
 who were already in advance of tho general condition of the 
 great body of their brother farmers throughout the Common- 
 wealth; for of the real tillers of the soil, from the interior 
 rural districts, but a small number ever witness a State Ag- 
 ricultural Exhibition. The deduction from this is, that to 
 improve throughly the Agriculture of the State, something 
 more is required than exhibitions. The benefits resulting 
 from these displays were limited mainly to the net receipts 
 that accrued to the Treasury of the Society, and to a cer- 
 tain popularity, produced by the novelty of the exhibitions, 
 among classes not strictly Agricultural. The popularity of 
 Horse and Cattle Shows is unreliable, and susceptible of 
 being turned to an account different from that ostensibly 
 claimed for them. Such excitement, at best, is no proof 
 that the great and needful work of improvement is going on 
 upon the farms; for as yet no apparent increase has been 
 effected in the average per acre of grain, corn, <fcc. The 

exhibitions have their influences for good, if properly con- 
 ducted and restrained within due bounds. The Farmers' 
 High School, however, can never be in danger of taking a 
 wrong direction. 

As regards our State Agricultural Society, no well founded 
 complaint can be urged against it. Its affairs have been 
 conducted in the most unexceptionable manner, and has 
 gained for it tho confidence and respect of the landed inter- 
 est. It has undoviatingly pursued the legitimate path des- 
 ignated by tho Legislature, when it obtained a charter and 
 the means to enable it to pursue its destined course. It has 
 never squandered, in needless display or folly, a dollar of 
 the fund derived from the State, but has managed it so well 
 as to be able, at this time, to show two talents for the one 
 entrusted to its care. The Society is now able and ready to 
 contribute the ten thousand dollars towards establishing the 
 Farmers' High School, authorized by the act incorporating 
 the School. So much (and less could not be said) for the 
 character and condition of our noble State Agricultural 
 Society. If, then, the gratuity vouchsafed to Agriculture, 
 through the State Society, has, like good seed well sown and 
 cultivated, produced so satisfactory a harvest, should it not 
 encourage the Legislature to seed a greater breadth in a field 
 more invitingly conditioned, from which a hundred fold 
 yield may confidently bo expected — yea, a thousand fold 
 yield! That field is "The Farmers' High School of Penn- 
 sylvania." 

Let the Legislature endow this School with but twenty 
 thousand dollars, and my life upon it, it will, in a brief 
 period, by the improvement of land, by the increase of grain, 
 roots and corn; beef, pork, butter and cheese, produce mill- 
 ions per annum to the State, over and above her present or 
 prospective agricultural resources, unaided by such an edu- 
 cational institution. It is hardly necessary to explain or 
 argue this before a Legislature composed chiefly of farmers, 
 who must know the low average per acre of our grain orops, 
 especially our lamentable deficiency in beef, pork and dairy 
 products. This untoward condition will begin to ameliorate, 
 only when one good Agricultural School and model farm 
 shall be established, capable of performing the functions of 
 a Normal institution, whereat teachers can be taught and 
 trained in an enlightened, thorough knowledge of systematic 
 culture and husbandry. Is it too much to anticipate that, 
 in a few years, after the opening of the Farmers' High 
 School, every county having an Agricultural Society, will 
 be able to boast of having also its Farm School and experi- 
 mental farm? Who will not devoutly pray for such a con- 
 summation? 

Let it not be imagined that, in approaching the Legisla- 
 ture, I desire to enlist political influence in favor of Agri- 
 culture. Far be the thought from me. I would rather see 
 the wheel of Agricultural progress sunk even deeper in the 
 rut than ever I had witnessed it, than invoke such aid, or 
 attempt to extricate it by the force of any partizan, political 
 movement. I appeal only to the Legislature as the repre- 
 sentative of the industry of the State, to aid that pervading 
 and paramount branch of industry, which, if permitted to 
 languish, enfeebles every other industrial pursuit. The 
 farmers of Pennsylvania want no political protection in the 
 shape of "Corn Laws." They want simply to be afforded 
 the means and opportunity to learn their trade, so that they 
 may skilfully and understandingly draw forth the latent 
 treasures of the soil, not more for their own individual 
 benefit than to promote the general prosperity of the 
 Commowealth. Respectfully, JAMES GOAVEN, 

Trustee, ex officio, of the Farmers' High School •>/ Penu-
