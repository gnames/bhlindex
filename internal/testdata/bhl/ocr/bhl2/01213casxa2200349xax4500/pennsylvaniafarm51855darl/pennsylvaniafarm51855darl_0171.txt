The Secretary announced that he was authorized by John 
 Fisk Allen, the author of the superb work on the "Victoria 
 regia," to present the society with a copy, and on motion a 
 tender of the thanks of the Society were ordered for this 
 appropriate gift. 

The Committee of Publication was instructed and au- 
 thorized to prepare the transactions of the Society from tho 
 commencement, and print 100 copies. 

The following resolutions were submitted by Mr. Buist, 
 and unanimously adopted by the Society : 

Resolved, That this Society has learned with the deepest 
 sorrow, the death of Thomas Hancock, who departed this 
 life (from an attack of pueumonia) at his residence, near 
 Burlington, New Jersey, on the 21st ult, in the 54th year 
 of his age. 

Resolved, That in acknowledging the sudden bereave- 
 ment with which this Society has been visited, it also ex- 
 presses its keen appreciation of the severe loss the various 
 institutions with which the deceased was connected in his 
 native State and elsewhere ; and to the promotion of whose 
 aims, he ever brought a rare practical intelligence, an ar- 
 dent zeal and sound judgment. 

Resolved, That whilst the life of so useful a citizen might 
 be fittingly presented as an example worthy of imitation 
 on the part of a large body of surviving friends, the void 
 which his death has occasioned cannot be more intensely 
 experienced than by the members of this Society, with 
 whom he co-operated for so long a period in the discharge 
 of official duties, (being at the time of his death a member 
 of no less than four of its most important Committees.) 

Resolved, That although this Society is far from sanc- 
 tioning the publication of fulsome memorials of living men, 
 yet it deems a sketch of the life, character and labors of 
 its departed member, a proper subject for the pages of those 
 journals, to the interest of which he had so often contribu- 
 ted; and trust that the priucipal one in our land will favor 
 its readers with such other notice of this distinguished hor- 
 ticulturist as may be due to his memory. 

Resolved, That this Society especially condoles with th« 
 immediate family of Mr. Hancock, in the sad dispensation 
 which now afflicts them, but hopes, nevertheless, that in re- 
 viewing the blameless career of their honored head, they 
 will find much to comfort and solace them in their distress. 

Resolved, That copies of these resolutions, signed by the 
 President and Secretary, be transmitted to Mrs. Hancock, 
 and to the publishers of such horticultural journals of tho 
 country as are received at the rooms of the society.
