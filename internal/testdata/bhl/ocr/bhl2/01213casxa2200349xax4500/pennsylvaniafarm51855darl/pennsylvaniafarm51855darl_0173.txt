The genuine Mammoth pumpkin, or true Potiron (Cucurbi- 
 ta maxima), may be considered as the typical species of this 
 group, having rather soft, roundish heart-shaped, and entire 
 leaves, a short cylindrical fruit stem, a permanent fleshy 
 stile, and five carpels or double row of seeds. The form of 
 the fruit is an oblate spheroid, depressed at the blossom and 
 stem ends, and marked with ten or more wide meridianal 
 furrows. It sometimes grows to an immense size, two feet 
 or more in diameter, and sixty pounds or more in weight, 
 being light in proportion to its size, on account of the large 
 hollow within. It is known to vary much in color and size, 
 and somewhat in form. In some of its variations, it may 
 have lost its original characteristic form, so far as»to be no 
 longer recognized. If this be true, Cole's Connecticut pie 
 squash, the round Valparaiso squashes, and several others, 
 may be merely varieties of the Mammoth pumpkin. To 
 some of the varieties of this fruit the name Giromon or Gi- 
 romont, otherwise written Giraumon and Giraumont, signi- 
 fying a rolling mountain, seems originally to have been ap- 
 plied, in allusion to the form and size. French writers sub- 
 sequently transferred this name to certain varieties of the 
 Cucurb ita pepo. 

The plants of the foregoing Valparaizo, or Potiron group, 
 are more tender and less hardy than those of the common 
 pumpkin or Pepo group; they are also much more subject 
 to the attacks of worms or borers (JEgeria cucurbitce) at the 
 roots. Their fruits, cpmpared with common pumpkins and 
 winter squashes, have a thinner and more tender rind, and 
 finer grained, sweeter and less strongly flavored flesh, on 
 which accounts they are preferred by most persons for table 
 use. 

The second group contains the common New England 
 field pumpkin, Bell-shaped and Crook-necked Winter 
 squashes, the Early Canada Winter squash, the Custard 
 squash, and various others, all of which (whether rightly or 
 not cannot now be determined,) have been generally re- 
 ferred by botanists to the Cucurlita pepo of Linnasus. This 
 group is readily to be distinguished from the first one by the 
 following charcters. The leaves are rough, and more or less 
 deeply and acutely five-lobed. The fruit has only three car- 
 pels or double row of seeds, and the stile drops off with the 
 blossom. The fruit stem is long, and clavated or enlarged 
 next the fruit, where it spreads out into five claw-like pro- 
 jections ,• and is five-angled and deeply five-furrowed. The 
 fruit is eaten only when fully ripe, and it may be kept with 
 care throughout the winter. The rind, though sometimes 
 quite hard, never becomes a woody shell, and the flesh re- 
 mains juicy and succulent till it rots, never drying up into 
 a spongy or fibrous substance, in which respects these fruits 
 differ from what are called Summer squashes. The seeds 
 are not so broad, thick or plump, and white as those of the 
 potiron group, but are smaller, thinner, and of a greyish 
 color. 

The common field pumpkin of New England, which for- 
 merly was extensively raised for stock, and is still used for 
 the same purpose, and of which our pumpkin pies and 
 pumpkin sauce were made, till the winter crook-neck and 
 autumnal marrow came to be substituted therefor, has a 
 form somewhat resembling that of the mammoth pumpkin, 
 but its longitudinal often exceeds its transverse diameter, 
 its color is of a deeper yellow or orange, the furrows on its 
 surface not so deep or broad, and its rind much thicker, and 
 in some varieties quite hard. Its flesh is rather coarse, of 
 a deep orange yellow color, and of a peculiar strong odor. 
 Baked pumpkin and milk, pumpkin sauce, and dried pump- 
 kin for winter use have had their day, and gone out of fash- 
 ion; and pumpkin pies are now mostly made of the autum- 
 nal marrow and crook-necked winter squashes, except by 

some of the old folks, who still prefer the pumpkin, baked 
 in a milk-pan, and without any pastry. 

The New England "crook-neck squash," as it is common- 
 ly but incorroctly called, is a kind of pumpkin, perhaps a 
 genuine species, for it has preserved its identity to our cer- 
 tain knowledge ever since the year 16S0, when it was de- 
 scribed by Ray. It has the form and color of the Cashaw, 
 but is easily distinguished therefrom by the want of a per- 
 sistent stile, and by its clavated and furrowed fruit stem. 
 Before the introduction of the Autumnal Marrow, it was 
 raised in large quantities for table use during the winter, in 
 preference to pumpkins, which it almost entirely superse- 
 ded. IV'any farmers now use it instead of pumpkins for 
 cattle ; the vine being more productive, and the fruit con- 
 taining much more nutriment in proportion to its size. It 
 varies considerably in form and color. The best kinds are 
 those which are very much curved, nearly as large at the 
 stem as at the blossom end, and of a rich cream color. Some 
 are green, variegated with cream colored stripes and spots. 
 Some are bell-shaped, or with a very short and straight 
 neck, and are less esteemed than the others ; for the neck 
 being solid and of fine texture, is the best part of the fruit. 
 These crook-necks can be kept all winter, if not exposed to 
 frost, and I have eaten of them when a year old. On ac- 
 count of its hardiness, its fruitfulness, and its keeping qual- 
 ities, this is perhaps the most valuable variety to the New 
 England farmer. It is said to degenerate in the Middle and 
 Southern States, where probably Commodore Porter's Val- 
 paraizo or some kindred variety may be better adapted to 
 the climate. 

The Early Canada squash seems to be a precocious and 
 dwarfed variety of the common crook-neck. It is smaller, 
 with a short and often straight neck, and is of a dark and 
 dirty buff color externally. It comes into eating early, quite 
 as soon as the autumnal marrow, and was, indeed still is, 
 much esteemed as a table vegetable. 

The custard squash or pumpkin is an oblong, deeply fur- 
 rowed, and prominently ten-ribbed fruit, with a pale buff 
 and very hard (but not woody) rind, and fine, light yellow 
 flesh, much esteemed in the making of pies and puddings. 
 For a figure and description of it, see Cole's New England 
 Farmer, Vol. Ill, No. 4, Fob. 15, 1851, pago 59. From 
 seeds received from Paris, under the name of Patagonian 
 squash, I raised a fruit exactly like the custard squash in 
 form and size, but of a dark green color externally and en- 
 tirely worthless as an article of food. Nevertheless I in- 
 fer that the custard squash is merely an improved variety 
 from the same original stock. 

The fruits belonging to this second group probably origi- 
 nated in the eastern and central parts of the two Americas. 
 They were cultivated by the Indians, and were found hero 
 in their gardens and fields by Europeans on the first settle- 
 ment of the country. Pumpkins, or bell-shaped squashes 
 (as New Eriglanders would now call them), were found as 
 far north as Saco, by Champlain, in 1605 and 1606. A sim- 
 ilar variety was cultivated by the Iroquois Indians, and still 
 bears their name in France. Pumpkins were found by 
 Raleigh's Colony among the Indians, in North Carolina, and 
 by early voyagers in the West Indies. There are indigenous 
 kinds in Brazil; and we have seen that even Patagonia has 
 added another to the common stock. Cultivation has doubt- 
 less improved their qualities, and has caused them to sport 
 in numerous varieties, so that it is now difficult, if not 
 impossible, to determine which of the known kinds are 
 typical species, and which are mere varieties. 

A third group remains to be described. The representa- 
 tives of it are the Cucurbita 3felopepo, verrucosa, and ovi- 
 fera, of Linnteus. It includes all those kinds called in New
