England Summer Squashes, because they are eaten only 
 during the summer, while thoy are soft and tender, and in 
 an unripe state. These are the only two Squashes, if regard 
 be had to the origin of the name, derived from the language 
 of the Massachusetts Indians, by whom, according to Roger 
 Williams, this kind of fruit was called "Askutasquash, which 
 the English from them call Squashes." From the same au- 
 thority, and from other sources, we learn that the Indians 
 of New England cultivated this kind of fruit or vegetable, 
 and used it for food; that some of their squashes were "of 
 the bigness of apples, of several colors," while others are 
 represented by Champlain, as being considerably larger, 
 turbinated, and more or less puckered on the margin, and of 
 the same form as that which in France is called Bonnet de 
 pretre, probably the prototype of our Scalloped Squash, or 
 Cucurbita melopepo. Bartram found a squash vine growing 
 wild in the interior of East Florida, climbing to the tops of 
 the trees, and bearing little yellow squashes of the form and 
 size of an orange. Mr. Nuttall informs us, that the warted 
 squash, Cucurbita verrucosa, was "cultivated by the Indians 
 of the Missouri to its sources." It has generally been sup- 
 posed, on the authority of Linnaeus, that the Egg Squash, 
 Cucurbita ovifera, was a native of Astrachan in Tartary. 
 On turning to the account of it given by Dr. Lorche, from 
 whom Linnaeus received his specimens, I find it included in 
 a list of plants, not natives of the vicinity of Astrachan, but 
 cultivated only in gardens, where it is associated with sach 
 exotics as Indian corn or Maize, with which it was probably 
 introduced directly or indirectly from America. We also learn 
 from Lorche that this species varied in form, being sometimes 
 pear-shaped; that it was sometimes variegated in color with 
 green and white ; and that the shell served instead of little 
 boxes. Here we have plainly indicated the little gourd -like, 
 hard-shelled, and variegated squashes, that are often cul- 
 tivated as ornamental plants. For further account of' 
 the Squashes of the North American Indians, AVood's 
 "New England Prospect," Josselyn's "Rarities," and Vander 
 Donck's "Description of the New Netherlands," may be con- 
 sulted. From these and similar authorities, we conclude 
 that Summer Squashes were originally natives of America, 
 where so many of them were found in use by the Indians, 
 when the country began to be settled by Europeans. 

The Summer Squashes, like the plants belonging to the 
 second group, have acutely five-lobed, rough leaves, and large 
 yellow flowers, a clavated five-angled and five-furrowed 
 fruit stem, and a deciduous stile. Their seeds also resemble 
 those of common pumpkins and winter squashes, but are 
 smaller and thinner; some of them are runners and clirsi- 
 bers, others have a dwarf erect habit, and hence are some- 
 times called "bush squashes." They differ from all the 
 foregoing kinds in having when ripe a hard and woody rind 
 or shell to the fruit, with a slimy and fibrous pulp, which 
 when dry become a mere stringy and spongy mass. Hence, 
 these fruits are only eaten while they still remain tender 
 and succulent, and never in a ripe state. On account of 
 their woody shells, they are sometimes mistaken for and 
 miscalled gourds, from which they are not only distinguished 
 by their oval and thin seeds, but by the largeness and yellow 
 color of their flowers, those of gourds being smaller and 
 white, and by their deeply lobed and rough leaves, those of 
 gourds being entire, or at most only slightly angular and 
 downy. 

Under the name of Cucurbita melopepo is to be included 
 what in New England is called Scalloped Squash, and in 
 the Middle and Southern Statos, Cymlings ; perhaps the 
 Patty-Pan Squash is another synonym for the samo. This 
 melopepo is a very broad and thin or compressed fruit, with 
 scallop edges, and more or less warted surface : it measures 

often ten or eleven inches in transverse diameter, and three 
 to four from stem to blossom. It varies in form, being some- 
 times much thicker, and more or less turbinated or top 
 shaped, when it takes the name of Bonnet de pietre or priest's 
 cap; perhaps this is really its original form. Other varieties 
 nearly round, are sometimes seen. 

The Cucurbita verrucosa is the cucumber-shaped warted 
 squash, generally with a slightly curved neck. In the West 
 Indies thero is a much larger , oblong, ovoid squash, with a 
 somewhat warted surface, which is also referred to the Cu- 
 curbita verrucosa. Intermediate between these, there is 
 another, which may be described as pestle-shaped, meas- ' 
 uring ten inches or more in length, and quite smooth on the 
 surface. These two kinds, namely the Cucurbita melopepo 
 and C. verrucosa, with all their varieties, are generally of 
 a dwarf habit, with erect stems. 

Cucurbita ovifera, with its varieties auriantiaca, the 
 Orange or Apple squash, and the pyriformis or pear-shaped 
 and variegated squashes, has a running or climbing stem. 
 Some of the orange squashes are the very best of the sum- 
 mer squashes for table use, far superior either to the scal- 
 loped or warted squashes. 

The Vegetable Marrow, as it is called in England, has 
 been considered by botanists as a variety of the Cucurbita 
 ovifera of Linna;us; if this bo correct, cultivation has forced 
 it to a most unnatural size, and has greatly changed its 
 original form. T. W. HARRIS. 

Origin of Black Hawk. 

Mr. Editor: — I read in the last number of your valuable 
 Journal, page 108, an article copied from the Boston Cul- 
 tivator, headed the "Origin of Black Hawk," and without 
 any intention to detract one jot or tittle from the just fame 
 that "Black Hawk" and his progeny have acquired as road- 
 sters, or caring whether Sherman Morgan, or Paddy, was 
 his sire, I would like to know, and I think almost every 
 person who is interested in breeding or using this high class 
 of horses would like to know, from what stock they origi- 
 nally sprung. In the article referred to, the ancestors of 
 Paddy are not mentioned at all, and all that is said about 
 Sherman Morgan, is by Mr. Bellows, of Lancaster, N. H., 
 owner of the horse at the time that his dam was bought by 
 Mr. Sherman of Dr. Fiske, of Providence, R. I., and was 
 said to have been imported; his sire, he says, was the Goss 
 (or Justin) Morgan, brought to Randolph, by Col. Morgan. 
 Now I think it will be easily seen that there is no informa- 
 tion given to the public in this long article upon this all 
 important subject. If Sherman Morgan horses and Paddy 
 horses were produced as far back as 1811, by a certain valu- 
 able cross, and are valuable for certain purposes, let us 
 know in what that cross was; then, by the samo process 
 they can be procured now. It is not enough to say that "the 
 dam was imported," or that the "sire was brought to Ver- 
 mont" bya Colonel or a General, to establish genealogy, with- 
 out giving a full and satisfactory account from what country 
 they were imported, from, and by whom, and of what stock 
 they were, fully substantiated. If any of the gentlemen 
 concerned in this article, are possessed of the true origin of 
 Sherman Morgan, or Paddy, they will confer a favor by 
 letting us have it. 

I have another word to say in regard to this class of 
 horses, which is this: — notwithstanding I have seen publi- 
 cations in different Agricultural Journals, respecting this 
 same class of horses, I have not been informed as to what 
 agricultural purposes they are adapted. Will some one plea.se 
 enlighten us upon this subject?
