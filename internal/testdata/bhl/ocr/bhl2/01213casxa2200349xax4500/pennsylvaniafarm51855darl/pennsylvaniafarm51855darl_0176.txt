the other instance, the peat acted mechanically, by keep- 
 ing the soil open, and storing up the liquid with which 
 it had been saturated ; but beyond this it could not do 
 much to promote vegetation. The great matter in using 
 peat as manure is to put it through such a course of fer- 
 mentation as will change its dead cold nature, and render 
 it capable of again serving a purpose in the living world. 
 Before being used in ordinary manure-heaps, it should 
 be carefully dried, by being thinly spread during the 
 summer months on the surface of some vacant space or 
 in a pasture field. The lumps should be well broken 
 down, and the first application of urine to the mass should 
 only be sufficient to damp it. By this means fermenta- 
 tion will be produced, and as it progresses more liquid 
 can be added. > 

Earth Composts: — Those composts in which soil and 
 the mud of ponds are the predominating ingredients may 
 be classed under this head. On every farm quantities of 
 earth, road scrapings, ditch scourings, and similar sub- 
 Stances are more or less available, and may be profitably 
 employed for agricultural purposes. By the action of 
 the plough on good soils, more or less earth is always 
 being deposited on the turning-ridges. If this soil is 
 allowed to accumulate for many years a much greater 
 loss is entailed on the farmer than he may have any con- 
 ception of. Take a head and foot ridge, each say 200 
 yards in length and 15 feet broad, with a depth of de- 
 posited soil of 15 inches, and we have 833J square yards. 
 Allowing that a field 200 yards broad has ridges 400 
 yards in length, it will contain 16 acres 2 rods 4 poles; 
 and with the turning-ridges at each end covered with 
 carried soil to the depth above mentioned, there will be 
 sufficient earth to cover the whole surface of the field to 
 the depth of nearly half an inch. This is no extreme ex- 
 ample, for very often turning ridges are covered with a 
 greater depth of carried soil than 15 inches, though the 
 ridges are less than 400 yards in length. A top-dressing 
 of good soil, half an inch thick, will often change the en- 
 tire nature of a poor clay field and in any instance will 
 make a great difference in the quality of land. In the 
 winter of 1846, from the foot-ridge, of a field, of rich 
 black soil, having considerable inclination of surface, I 
 removed 500 cart-loads of earth little inferior in quality 
 to some sorts of police manure. The field had lain in 
 pasture for more than thirty years, having previously 
 been regularly cultivated. The soil in the foot-ridge, 
 being partly alluvial and partly plough-carried, had re- 
 mained the whole time the field was in grass, and by 
 long exclusion from the atmospheric action had become 
 quite brown in colour. Here, then, were 500 carts of 
 valuable soil locked up in a foot ridge for more than 
 thirty years without doing almost any good to the farmer. 
 A large portion of the earth so obtained was applied at 
 once to the surface of a cold, thin, clay soil, and the 
 great improvement which it made on the herbage clearly 
 proved that the loss sustained by its long dormancy had 
 been considerable. Had it been convenient at the time 
 to have mixed the whole quantity with lime or other en- 
 riching substances, it would have been of still greater 
 value even in proportion to the expense, but only a few 
 loads could be so treated. In the autumn of 1849, how- 
 ever, I had a better opportunity of testing the advantages 
 which may be derived from mixing soil with different 

kino's of manures. A sheet of policy ground, extending 
 to about 60 acres, bad been in pasture for many years, 
 and for various reasons it was deemed expedient in 1849, 
 to allow it to produce a crop of natural hay. To pre- 
 vent the deterioration of the soil it was necessary, after 
 the removal of the hay crop, to give a top-dressing of 
 various sorts of composts. On thinking of the various 
 substances which might be used to advantage, my atten- 
 tion was directed to a flat alluvial spot of ground in the 
 centre of a plantation adjoining the land about to be top- 
 dressed. A small run of water had formerly passed 
 through the centre of this flat, and having periodically 
 left deposits of rich soil, it had accumulated to the depth 
 of about 4 feet. It was covered with half-grown hard- 
 wood trees, but as they were tolerably far apart, a great 
 quantity of earth could be removed without disturbing 
 the roots. On this natural store of fertility, men, horses 
 and carts were at once set at work, and several hundred 
 cart-loads were removed and laid down on the pleasure- 
 grounds in heaps, each containing from eight to twelve 
 carts. A large quantity of short manure (partially 
 mixed with byre and stable dung), lime, and soot being 
 procured, the heaps were prepared in the following 
 manner: — In the manure compost, a layer of soil was 
 laid in the bottom 6 or 8 inches thick, and over it was 
 spread, quite loosely, a 6-inch coating of dung. With 
 alternate quantities of earth and dung, the former about 
 9 and the latter about 6 inches thick, the heaps were 
 drawn to a ridge like a narrow potato-pit. 

The police manure, besides excrementitious matters, 
 contained a great many undecomposed substances, such 
 as straw, wood, shavings, rags, and parings of leather, 
 and as soon as these were covered up with the moist soil, 
 fermentation began. As the soil was mixed with grass,! 
 ferns, fibrous roots, and other matters, many of them 
 quite inert, the fermentation also extended to it. In a 
 few days, therefore, the heat of the mixture was by no 
 means inconsiderable, and it was several weeks before it 
 entirely cooled. In about three weeks after the forma- 
 tion of the heaps they were each turned over, and had a 
 quantity of soot mixed with the compound. The turn- 
 ing operation was begun at the end of each heap, and 
 while care was taken to mix the soil and dung thorough- 
 ly, no treading was allowed, for fear of pressing them too 
 firmly together. As the material was being gradually 
 turned over, the soot was mixed with it at the rate of 
 about one cwt. to every five cart-loads. After being 
 turned, a second heat came on, and continued for about 
 a week ; and in another week more it was in a fit state 
 for being applied to the land. When the heaps were bro- 
 ken up, the earth, which had formerly been somewhat 
 brown in colour, had become a rich black; and, judging 
 by the greasy appearance of the mass, though it was 
 comparatively destitute of smell, it appeared to be an 
 excellent manure. It was applied at the rate of from 
 12 to 18 tons per acre, according to the state which th i 
 land was in. Taking 15 tons as an average, the co:t 
 per acre was as follows: —
