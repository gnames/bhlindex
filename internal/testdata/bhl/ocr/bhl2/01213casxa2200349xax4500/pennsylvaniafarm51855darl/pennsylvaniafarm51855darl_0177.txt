For this sum per acre a top-dressing was applied, 
 which along with the lime composts, so much improved 
 the pasture that the annual rental was subsequently 
 raised 10 per cent, above its former letting price, and left 
 at least 12 per cent, on the outlay. The dung used was 
 in some respects suited to the land, which was rather 
 6tiff and tenacious ; but on lighter land, byre or stable 
 dung would have been preferable. The railway dues 
 added as much to its price as would have been the case 
 with better manure ; and, therefore, though detailing 
 the experiment as it was made, and the satisfactory re- 
 sults which followed it, I am convinced that had ordinary 
 stable-manure been used, it would have been still more 
 profitable. The fermentation was a principal agent in 
 preparing both the soil and dung as a top-dressing com- 
 pound, and stable-manure would have been even more 
 profitable in promoting this. A large quantity of the 
 Boil so obtained was also used with caustic lime, the 
 composts being prepared in the usual manner. The 
 proportion of lime to earth was as one to four; and with 
 the former mixed up in a hot state, an excellent compost 
 was produced at an expense as under: —

 From the lime compound being used in the same en- 
 closure with the dung mixture, it was scarcely possible 
 to make actual experiments as to their comparative pas- 
 turing efficiency. So far, however, as careful observation 
 of the appearances of the pasture for several years after 
 can be depended on, tbe lime compost seemed to give the 
 most satisfactory results. Immediately after the appli- 
 cation of the composts in autumn, the dung and soot 
 compound produced a dark green and seemingly nutri- 
 tious herbage. In the following spring, to a rather less 
 extent, this was also the case ; but during the summer 
 the sward did not appear to be so closely eaten as that 
 which had been dressed with lime. For the first year 
 the lime made but little apparent difference on the luxu- 
 riance of the herbage, but for two years past the pasture 
 dressed with it has been darker green in colour, much 
 less injured by moss, and more closely eaten than that 
 dressed with the clung compost. Three tons of lime 
 were no doubt a very light dressing per acre; but its 
 beneficial action can be traced rather to the effect it had 
 on the long-buried alluvial soil when thoroughly incor- 
 porated with it, than upon the mere surface of the land. 
 The quick-lime mixed with the roots and grasses of the 
 soil, and allowed to lie together sometime, promoted the 
 decomposition of inert vegetable matter, and rendered it 
 at once capable of nourishing living structures. Then 
 again, on the compost being turned over once or twice, 
 and subsequently spread on the surface, a small quantity 
 of nitrate of lime would be formed — a susbtance emi- 
 nently conducive to the growth of plants. Without en- 
 tering into details of particular experiments recently 

made with composts, I purpose to make some further 
 observations on the saving and use of the refuse sub- 
 stances generally available on ordinary farms. It may 

only be remarked that I speak from observatio» and 

experience, though the want of the requisite time and 
 opportunities have prevented the making of experiments 
 capable of being elaborately detailed. 

Road Scrapings : — The cleanings of roads do not only 
 contain excrementitious matter, but silica, potash, and 
 mineral substances, required in the growth of plants, are 
 also present. From the stones generally used on roads 
 being of the trap-rock formation, the scrapings, of ne- 
 cessity, contain a considerable quantity of a mineral sim- 
 ilar in many respects to lime. When applied to the land, 
 therefore, the action is chemical as well as mechanical. 
 On clayey soils road cleanings are of great use in ren- 
 dering their texture more porous and less difficult to 
 work. If the farmer is attentive to the gathering togeth- 
 er of every description of road scrapings, and mixing 
 them with slaughter-house or fish refuse, gas, liquor, or 
 similar substances, a large quantity of most valuable 
 manure will be obtained during the year, at a compara- 
 tively trifling expense. When blood, flesh or other ani- 
 mal substances are being decomposed, a large amount of 
 nitrogen in the form of ammonia, and also some phos- 
 phates, are produced ; and unless these be taken up by 
 the materials with which such animal matters are sur- 
 rounded, a serious loss must be the result. For such 
 composts the cleanings of ditches, and other earthy 
 matters can be more profitably used than any other in- 
 gredients. Often blood and other fleshy substances are 
 thrown into the dunghills, but in this case a double loss 
 is sustained. The rapid putrefaction of the animal 
 matters promotes an injurious decomposition of the ordi- 
 nary manure ; and, on the other hand, the latter is ill 
 adapted for taking up the liberated ammonia. All the 
 earthy matters, then, which can be collected on the farm, 
 ought to be stored up in heaps in the formation of which 
 the different kinds of soil should be mixed together. 
 Lying in this state for some time, and occasionally turn- 
 ed over, the mass will be improved even without the ap- 
 plication of other ingredients ; but the most profitable 
 method of managing it is to employ such fertilizing mat- 
 ters as may be available in enriching the earth. When 
 horses or cattle die, they are very frequently buried with- 
 out any thought being taken of the value of the carcasses 
 as a manure. Where such heaps of accumulated soil or 
 road-scrapings are at hand, nothing will make better 
 manure than the bodies of dead animals decomposed in 
 the centre of the heaps. By the carcasses being cut tip 
 into pieces of suitable size, and thoroughly mixed with 
 the earth, a soapy mass will be produced, remarkably po- 
 tent as a manure. To promote decomposition, the heap 
 may be turned over once or twice, and after the fleshy 
 matter has been severed from the bones, the latter can 
 be gathered together to be reduced in the bone mill. 
 Taking the average weight of worn-out horses at 6 cwt., 
 and the price they are sold at when sent to the dogs are 
 6s. each, we have a very valuable manure for 20s. a ton, 
 besides allowing the skin to pay for the dissection of the 
 carcass. 

Surely this is cheap guano, even were it three times 
 the price. Or taking the average weight of cattle dying 
 from pi euro-pneumonia at 4 cwt., we may safely estimate 
 that each carcass is worth 12s. as manure. If this is the 
 case why is so little attention paid to the bodies of dead 
 animals, that we should see them frequently buried 5 or
