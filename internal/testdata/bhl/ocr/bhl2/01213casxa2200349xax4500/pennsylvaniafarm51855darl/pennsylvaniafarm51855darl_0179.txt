this insect upon the grape vine seem first to have been 
 observed in the year 1831, by the late Judge Darling, in 
 Connecticut, and by Mr. David Thomas, of New York. An 
 account of them by the latter gentleman was published in 
 1834, in the 26th volume of Silliman's "American Journal 
 of Science." The beetles were found to destroy the fruit 
 buds in the spring, and their young, in the form of chest- 
 nut colored grubs, destroyed the leaves in summer. 
 These grubs have never been fully described. In a recent 
 excursion to New Hampshire, I was struck by the condi- 
 tion of the leaves of the black alders (Alnus serrulata,) 
 which, through a long extent of country, were destroyed 
 in the same way as the leaves of fruit trees are by can- 
 ker-worms. Upon examination, the authors of all this 
 mischief were found to be certain dark colored grubs, 
 great numbers of which were still remaining on the leaves 
 on the 2d of August, while others had already completed 
 their transformations, and had come forth in the beetle 
 form. The beetles were identical with the above named 
 depi-edator of the grape vine, and feeding on the few 
 green leaves still remaining on the alders. The grubs 
 were fully grown, and measured about half an inch in 
 length. They were of a livid brown color above, and 
 paler beneath, with a black head, black feet, and a double 
 row of minute accuminated black warts, each producing 
 a very short hair, on every ring. The body was nearly 
 cylindrical; the feet were six in number, situated beneath 
 the fore part of the body; and there was a little fleshy 
 prop-leg beneath the last segment. It may be added that 
 the beetles were rather more than three-twentieths of 
 an inch in length, of a brilliant greenish blue color above, 
 and that they leaped with the agility of fleas. The dis- 
 covery of these insects in such immense numbers on the 
 the extensive alder, and ravages committed by them on 
 this shrub, seem to indicate that the natural food of this 
 species is obtained from the alder, rather than from the 
 vine; and that its resorting occasionally to the latter, may 
 be owing to the want of the former, or to the extraordina- 
 ry multiplication of the insects, in certain seasons, in 
 the vicinity of the grape vine.

What a Mechanic can do on a Farm. 

You or a correspondent asked, in a former number, 
 "What a man can do in Virginia." I will tell you what 
 I have done, not by way of boasting, but to answer the 
 question, and perhaps encourage others. 

I was born and raised in this county, and never had 
 any education more than to read and write. I was 
 bound to a trade when young, and after I was free, lived 
 on a farm, and received $140 a year. When I was 
 twenty-four years old I married, neither my wife nor 
 myself having any property. We are now worth $10,- 
 000, obtained without any speculation, and in a straight- 
 forward course. I have been married about twenty 
 years, work a farm of 238 acres, which I bought some 
 years ago, for $22 per acre. Last year I had 24 acres 
 in wheat, yielding 470 bushels — 63J- lbs. to the bushel. 
 I raised 2.500 bushels of corn, which is only worth, at 
 this time, 65 cents per bushel. My sales this year will 
 amount to about $1,800, including pork, grain, hay, &c. 
 I plowed an old and very poor field, last year, for corn, 
 having spread over the ground lightly with straw, and 

notation of Crops. 

Although instances are frequently cited, of certain 
 plants being raised on particular spots of ground for 
 year after year, without any apparent diminution in the 
 produce, yet it is generally allowed that a rotation of 
 crops is always of advantage, and often of the greatest 
 importance. We consider it as necessary as depth and 
 mellowness of soil, and the regular application of manure. 
 Gardeners are sometimes heard to complain of vegetables 
 becoming "tired" of the ground where they have been 
 long cultivated, They are attacked by numerous dis- 
 eases and insects, while a deficiency is to be discovered 
 in the amount of the produce. As soon as this is known 
 some wiseacres will send many miles, in order to procure 
 new varieties of seed, because the old ones have "degen- 
 erated." 

A more certain method of relief would be to adopt a 
 good rotation of crops, which is based on the well 
 known fact, that the several families of plants not only 
 strike their roots in different depths and in different di- 
 rections, but draw different kinds of nourishment from 
 the soil. When one particular element of a vegetable is 
 removed from the soil, the vegetable cannot again be 
 raised there, until that element be restored. It is, 
 therefore, advisable to alternate the crops, by which 
 means the land will have opportunity to regain its origi- 
 nal strength and fertility. This is illustrated by Dame 
 Nature herself. If old pastures were to be attentively 
 observed it would be found that the grasses gradually 
 change from season to season; rnd in wood-land, it would 
 be discovered, that an entirely different kind of tree 
 takes the place of such as have decayed, or have been cut 
 down. Thus the pine and others of the coniferse will 
 succeed the oak, the chestnut and other deciduous trees. 

A rotation is designed to prevent a too frequent re- 
 currence of the same species upon a particular spot. 
 Some authors lay down regular plans for the guidance 
 of their readers ; but as the space annually appropriated 
 to different plants depends upon circumstances, it will 
 be readily seen that all such courses or plans are diffi- 
 cult of application. Instead, therefore, of following this 
 practice, we shall content ourselves with some general 
 rules, which possess the merits of simplicity and brief- 
 ness, so that the reader can adapt them to his own wants. 

In the first place, vegetables of the same species shall 
 not follow each other, but return at as distant intervals 
 as the case will allow. Tuberous or tap roots should be 
 succeeded by those of a fibrous character; perennials by 
 annuals ; and plants of a dry, solid texture, or those left 
 for seed, by such as are succulent and juicy. Ground 
 which has necessarily, been devoted for a number of 
 years to the artichoke, asparagus, rhubarb, strawberry, 
 and the like, should, as soon as they are removed to oth- 
 er parts of the enclosure, be subjected to a strict rotation, 
 and allowed to recover those elements of fertility of 
 which it has been exhausted. Where the garden is divi- 
 ded into quarters, the vegetables can easily be made to 
 take a circuit in every four or eight years.
