air and shade, as here represented. 12. Bees are 
 easily and safely transferred from the ordinary Box-Hive 
 to this. Such are some of its more important character- 
 istics These are given that individuals at a distance 
 may form some idea of its utility. As to its practical 
 operations, some idea may be gained from the following 
 statement of facts. Two years ago, in consequence of 
 removing from a neighboring State, the subscriber com- 
 menced with a new stock of bees. Recently he has 
 taken an account of expenditures and receipts in Bee- 
 keeping for two years, and finds that his bees have paid 
 in honey, and increase of stock, six hundred and fifty- 
 four per cent., or three hundred and twenty-seven per 
 cent, per annum. This is the average of his entire stock, 
 which is now somewhat extensive. Some swarms have 
 paid one hundred, others three hundred, others five hun- 
 dred per cent a year. Other Bee-keepers who have used 
 this hive have been equally successful. The subscriber 
 would be glad to give one individual who has used it $25 
 for the proceeds of one swarm during a single year. 
 In this hive the natural instincts of the Honey-bee are 
 not obstructed or changed, but directed into a profitable 
 channel for the benefit of the keeper. 

The Patentee of this hive is the author of- a work en- 
 titled ; Eddy on Bee Culture. This manual will be 
 sent free of postage to any individual who shall forward 
 to him nine letter stamps. His address is — Henry Eddy, 
 M. D., North Bridgewater, Mass. 

Pennsylvania State Agricultural Exhibition. 
 Harrisburg has been selected by the Executive Com- 
 mittee of the State Society, as the place for holding its 
 ^next annual exhibition, and the necessary funds having 
 also since been raised by its citizens, we are now able to 
 give notice of it as a fixed fact. AVe have no doubt the 
 selection will be generally approved of, its central posi- 
 tion, and facilities of access from all parts of the State, 
 entitling it to preference, inasmuch as both extremities, 
 Philadelphia and Pittsburg, have each had the benefit of 
 one location of the fair. Judge Watts has accepted the 
 invitation to deliver the address. We anticipate a dis- 
 play at least fully equal to any preceding one, and hope 
 every farmer will consider it his duty to do something, 
 by either personal eifort, or contribution, to sustain the 
 character and increase the interest of the exhibition. 
 Ample facilities will no doubt be afforded by the various 
 rail road companies in transporting stock, implements, 
 &c, of which we will give due notice. 

The time of holding, with the premium list, will be 
 found on another page. 

Early Tomatoes. 
 There are some general principles, which lie at the ba- 
 sis both of good farming and gardening, and which are 
 applicable to growing with success an oak tree, as well as 
 a tomato. Frequent transplanting makes fibre either in 
 the roots of a tree or vegetable here, and is both the se- 
 cret of getting trees to grow and having early tomatoes. 
 Our Tomato Plants, at the time of this writing (middle of 
 last month) are eighteen inches high, stout, thickly branched 
 all around, with a hard, not succulent stem, and out in 
 blossom. In a few days we shall back up a cart to 
 where they are gi'owing, dig them up with a spade, and 

enough earth and roots adhering to each one, as would 
 go in a quarter peck measure, fling them into the cart, 
 and plant them out either on a clear or cloudy day, 
 as it may happen, and not expect a leaf or blossom to 
 hardly droop its head or wither. The reason is, they 
 will have been thrice transplanted. First sown thickly in 
 the frame, then pricked out into rows, afterwards as they 
 increase in size, transplanted into other rows, wider 
 apart and where they would have plenty of room in rich 
 soil to expand and grow before the last removal. The 
 consequence is they acquire a mass of fibrous roots, the 
 very life of the plant, to which the earth adheres, and 
 the stem acquires a firmness, not easily affected by the 
 weather. This is of course done in frames under glass, 
 which are raised from time to time as the height of the 
 plants may require, and to give them room. In this way 
 we have tomatoes about two weeks before our neighbors. 

What is Poudrette? 

As this article is becoming quite common in market, 
 as a manure, a short history of it may be interesting. 

In large cities, like London, Paris, and New York, an 
 immense amount of filth accumulates in privies, and other 
 places which it is necessary to remove. To do so required 
 great expense, and to remunerate in part the person who 
 did this unpleasant work, they adopted the practice of 
 selling it to farmers, for manure. The first systematic 
 effort to save it for market, we believe, was in London. 
 The sewers were so constructed, that the accumulated 
 filth of the city was emptied into them, and through them 
 carried in a liquid state, into large reservoirs on the 
 Thames. By means of steam power it was then forced 
 through large iron pipes back into the country, and sold 
 to the farmers. This liquid manure, though in the best 
 possible state for use, was necessarily confined to a limited 
 sphere near the city, and besides, was most offensive in 
 odor. The great desideratum was to neutralize the odors 
 without impairing the fertilizing properties, and render 
 it suitable for exporting to a distance. To do this it is 
 mixed with ashes, or muck, and plaster — the first to ab- 
 sorb the water, diffuse the concentrated strength and 
 render it better adapted to sow over the ground; the 
 plaster to neutralize the odor, and also to detain the nitro- 
 gen and ammonia. AVhen so mixed, it is dried, pulver- 
 ized and barrelled up for use. 

In New York, the sweepings of the streets are gathered 
 in large piles and sold, but are not as valuable as the 
 prepared Poudrette. This last article sells at about 
 $2,00 a barrel. When genuine, it is the most concentra- 
 ted and powerful fertilizer known. To be a genuine 
 article, however, no more ashes, muck or plaster should 
 be used than is necessary to render it dry, and fit it for 
 barreling, and destroy the offensive odor. Counterfeit 
 Poudrette has been manufactured of appearance so like 
 the genuine, as to escape the detection of any test, ex- 
 cept a chemical analysis, and yet almost totally worth- 
 less. Like guano, it is valuable in proportion to the 
 nitrogen contained in it. If, by exposure, it has lost 
 that, or from the amount of worthless articles in its com- 
 position, never had any, money is thrown away in 
 purchasing this far famed manure. Farmers should be 
 cautious of whom they buy, unless the article is tested 
 by a chemist. — Ohio Farmer.
