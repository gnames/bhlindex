Production, Preservation and Ripening of Fruit. 

BY HON. MARSHALL P. WILDER, PRESIDENT OF AMERICAN 
 POMOLOGICAL SOCIETY. 

The immense loss to American cultivators, from the im- 
 portation- of foreign varieties, in many instances not well 
 adapted to the countries from which they come, and often 
 still less adapted to our soil and climate, suggests the impor- 
 tance of raising from seed, native sorts which, in most in- 
 stances, possess peculiar advantages. It is now generally 
 conceded that the trees and plants of a given country, like 
 its aboriginal inhabitants, will flourish better at home than 
 in most foreign localities. 

We rejoice that public attention has been turned to this 
 subject by some of our horticultural journalists, and that 
 many cultivators and amateurs are engaged in this interest- 
 ing and promising department. The success which has 
 crowned their exertions affords great encouragement to per- 
 severance. Witness, for instance, thirty or more varieties 
 of the cherry, by Dr. Kirtland, of Ohio, which appear 
 adapted to our eastern climate, and some of them of superior 
 excellence. Witness the numerous varieties of the raspberry, 
 by Dr. Brinckle, Ex-President of this Society, of which, 
 some have endured, without covering, the severities of the 
 last winter in the New England States, and which also prom- 
 ise to be valuable contributions to American pomology. In 
 addition to these, how many new varieties of the apple, the 
 pear, the plum, and the grape, have recently been added to 
 the list of American fruits. How many new and excellent 
 varieties of the strawberry have appeared since the intro- 
 duction of Mr. Hovey's Seedlings. 

These are sure indications of the success which will re- 
 ward future efforts to obtain valuable native varieties of 
 fruit : and they point to a fulfilment of the prediction of the 
 celebrated Van Mons, "that the time will come when our 
 best fruits will be derived from seedlings." He gives the 
 following sage counsel to his correspondents, to whom he 
 had sent trees : — Sow your seed and persevere without inter- 
 ruption, and you will obtain better fruit than mine." 

Among pioneers in this department, I am happy to notice 
 a gentleman, (now residing among us) the pupil and friend 
 of Van Mons, one who has adopted our country as his future 
 home, and who has already transplanted to our soil many 
 thousands choice seedlings of the pear, which have come 
 into his possession from the collections of that gentleman 
 and the celebrated Esperen. 

As to the best method of producing fine varieties from 
 the seed, the opinions of distinguished pomologists are not 
 uniform. 

Duhamel, among the French, from causes which seem to 
 us irreconcilable with nature and experience, entertained 
 serious doubts of the practicability of any method for ob- 
 taining new and valuable varieties from seeds, especially of 
 the pear, because ho has tried various experiments without 
 success for fifty years. 

Dr. Van Mons, of Belgium, instead of saving the seed of 
 the finest varieties, selected those of inferior sorts, upon tho 
 principle that a kind having arrived at the highest state of 
 perfection must deteriorate, while an inferior one would im- 
 prove by successive reproductions. He also held that hybrid- 
 ization tended to degeneracy and imperfection. Thus he 
 assumes the doctrine that a perfect variety necessarily dete- 
 riorates, and also overlooks the fact, observed by other dis- 
 tinguished men, that the improvement or deterioration of 
 which he speaks, may result from natural impregnation by 
 the pollen of other varieties conveyed by the air or insects, 
 and therefore that the seed of a good variety may produce 
 either a better or a worse, and that of a bad cither a worse 
 or a better. 

Mr. Knight's system of obtaining new and improved va- 
 rieties, depended entirely on hybridization, or artificial im- 
 pregnation, so lightly esteemed by Dr. Van Mons. This is 
 somewhat difficult to practice on account of natural fertiliza- 
 tion by insects and the wind; but it has the merit of depend- 
 ing on a truly philosophical principle, and with very partic- 
 ular attention may yet prove as available for the improve- 
 ment of our fruits as it has for the production of fine varieties 
 in the vegetable and floral kingdom, or as the corresponding 
 principle has in the crossing of the breeds of domestic ani- 
 mals. 

The result of Mr. Knight's experience disprove the ten- 
 dency to degeneracy, inasmuch as many of his fruits, obtained 
 by hybridization, are among the most durable and hardy va- 
 rieties, as the Eyewood and Dunniore Pears; tho Black 
 Eagle, and other Cherries. 

Many cultivators, as Esperen, Bivort, Berckmans, and 
 others, both in this and foreign countries, have sown seeds 
 in variety, and have obtained some valuable sorts. But I 
 am confirmed in the opinion, that the best means of produ- 
 cing new and excellent varieties, suited either to general 
 cultivation or to particular localities, is to ]>lant the most 
 mature and perfect seed of the most hardy, vigorous, and 
 valuable sorts; on the general pathological principle that 
 "like produces like," and upon the conviction that immature 
 seed, although tho embryo may be sufficiently formed to 
 vegetate, yet not having all its elements in perfection, it will 
 not produce a vigorous and healthy offspring. Dr. Lindloy, 
 commenting upon this practice, justly remarks — "All expe- 
 rience shows that in every kind of created thing, be it man 
 or beast, or bird, the mysterious principle, called life, remains 
 during the whole period of existence what it was at first. If 
 vitality is feeble in the beginning, so it remains. Weak 
 parents produce weak children, and their children's children 
 are weaker still, as imperial dynasties have sadly shown." 
 With him, we believe this theory as applicable to the vege- 
 table as to tho animal kingdom. May not a disregard of 
 this doctrine account for the great number of feeble, sickly, 
 early defoliated trees often found in our grounds by the side 
 of those that are vigorous, healthful, and persistent in foli- 
 age? Is not tho theory we advocate as important in the 
 production of fruit trees, as in the raising of cereal grains? 
 The skilful agriculturist saves the best seed of his various 
 crops, and selects tho best animals from his flocks and herds 
 for breeders. Why should not this law of reproduction 
 regulate the practice of the pomologist as well as tho far- 
 mer? Has tho All-wise and Infinite enacted several laws, 
 where one would subserve the purpose. 

To the doctrine of Van Mons, and other distinguished 
 writers, respecting deterioration by age, and after a variety 
 has reached its perfection, there seem to be some exceptions. 
 From the accounts of oriental travellers, may we not believe 
 that the grapes of Eschol are as perfect now, as when the 
 chiefs of Israel plucked their rich clusters three thousand 
 years ago? — and the same variety of the fig, the olive, and 
 pomegranite are as perfect in Syria, to-day, as in the period 
 of David and Solomon? It is worthy of inquiry whether 
 the native grapes, on tho banks of our rivers, have deterio- 
 rated since the day when the red men of the forest refreshed 
 themselves with fruit from those vines, and whether the 
 orange, the lemon, the bananna, and the fruits of southern 
 latitudes, evince any more signs of decay than they did cen- 
 turies ago? In a word, whether this doctrine of deteriora- 
 tion is as applicable to the native, as to the foreign fruit of 
 a country? 

Why may we not expect to obtain natural varieties of the 
 apple and other fruits, as durable and far more valuablo than 
 those which have passed their second centennial, as the En-
