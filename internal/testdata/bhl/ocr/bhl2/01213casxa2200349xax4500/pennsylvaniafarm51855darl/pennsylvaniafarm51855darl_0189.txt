5. By means of manures, as stable dung and animal ex- 
 crements, the lost fertility may be restored. 

6. Manures consist of decayed vegetable and animal 
 matters, which contain a certain quantity of soil-ingredients. 
 The excrements of animals and of man represent the ashes 
 of food burned in the animal or human body, i. e. the ashes 
 of plants, which have been gathered from the' soil. In the 
 urine are found those ingredients of the plant, derived from 
 the soil, which are soluble in water; the solid excrements 
 contain those which aro insoluble. Manures contain the 
 materials which the consumed crops have removed from the 
 soil. It is plain that by incorporating manures with the soil, 
 the latter receives again the withdrawn ingredients. The 
 restoration of its original composition, is accompanied with 
 the recovery of its original fertility. It is certain that one 
 of the conditions of fertility is the presence of certain min- 
 eral ingredients in the soil. A rich soil contains more of 
 them than a poor one. 

7. The functions of the roots of plants in reference to 
 the absorption of atmospheric food, are similar to those 
 of the leaves, i. e. the former, like the latter, possess the 
 property of taking up and assimilating carbonic acid and 
 ammonia. 

8. Ammonia, which is contained in or added to the soil, 
 comports itself as a soil-constituent. The samo is equally 
 true of carbonic aejd. 

9. Animal and vegetable bodies and animal excrements, 
 enter into putrefaction and decay. The nitrogen of the 
 nitrogenous matters is thereby converted into ammonia, a 
 small portion of the ammonia decays (oxydizes) further into 
 nitric acid. 

10. We have every reason to believe that nitric acid 
 may replace ammonia in the processes of vegetable nutrition, 
 i. e. tnat its nitrogen may be applied by the plant to the 
 same purposes as that of ammonia. Animal manures accor- 
 dingly furnish the plant, not only with those mineral sub- 
 stances which it is the function of the soil to furnish, but 
 also with those forms of food which it naturally derives 
 from the atmosphere. This supply is an addition to that 
 quantity which the atmosphere contains. 

11. Those forms of vegetable food contained in the soil, 
 which aro not gaseous or volatile, enter the plant through 
 its roots. The vehicle of their transmission is water, by the 
 agency of which they become soluble and transportable. 
 Many of these kinds of food dissolve in pure water, others 
 only in water which contains carbonic acid or a salt of am- 
 monia. 

12. All those substances which exert a solvent action on 
 such ingredients of the soil as are themselves insoluble, 
 cause, by their presence, a given volume of rain water to 
 take up a larger quantity of vegetable food than it otherwise 
 could. 

13. From the progressive decay of the organic matters 
 of manure, originate carbonic acid and. ammonia-salts; they 
 constitute an active source of carbonic acid in the soil, 
 whereby the air and water present in the soil are made 
 richer in carbonic acid than they could be in their absence. 

14. Animal manures not only offer to the plant a certain 
 amount of soil and atmospheric food, but in their decay, is 
 supplied, in the form of carbonic acid and ammonia, an 
 indispensable means of rendering soluble and available to 
 the plant the insoluble ingredients of the soil, in greater 
 quantity, and in shorter time, than could occur in the absenco 
 of decaying organic matter. 

15. Other things being equal, vegetation receives less 
 water through the soil in warm, dry seasons, than in wet 
 years; the harvests in different years stand in relation 
 thereto. A field of given quality yields smaller crops in 

dry seasons; by the same average temperature, the yield 
 increases, to a certain limit, with the increase of the quan- 
 tity of rain. 

16. Of two fields, one richer, one poorer in plant-food, 
 the richer yields in dry seasons more produce than the 
 poorer, other things being equal. 

18. Of two fields alike in character, and containing an 
 equal amount of soil-ingredients, one of which, however, 
 has, besides, a source of carbonic acid, viz., decomposable 
 vegetable or animal matter, the latter yields more in dry 
 seasons than the former. 

The cause of this difference in yield lies in the unequal 
 supply of matters, both as concerns quality and quantity, 
 which the plant receives from the soil in a given time.

The Yellows in Peach Trees. 

This disease was first known in New Jersey, but at what 
 time, or place, I have no means. at present of ascertaining. 
 It has now spread over most of New Jersey, a part of Dela- 
 ware, some in Southern New Tork, and a part of Connecti- 
 cut. It may be called the cholera of the peach trees, but is 
 more fatal to them than the Asiatic cholera is to the human 
 family; in the latter case many that are attacked, recover, 
 but in the former, none. In both cases, quacks have adver- 
 tised their specifics, but I venture to say, that there never 
 has been a single instance where a peach tree that had the 
 yellows was restored to a healthy state. This disease first 
 manifests itself by a change in the color of the leaves, as 
 the name indicates, from a healthy green to a sickly yellow. 
 The branches are stunted in their growth, although having 
 as many buds as would appear on a healthy shoot â€” they are 
 all crowded on a short space, and when the leaves put out 
 in the spring, they more resemble a tuft of leaves than a 
 proper shoot. 

For one or two years the fruit sets and swells out to a 
 moderate size, puts on the appearance of ripening, and falls 
 from the tree from two to four weeks sooner than the same 
 variety ripens upon healthy trees. Upon close inspection 
 such varieties as have red cheeks will be found to have a 
 different appearance from healthy fruit; tho blush upon the 
 cheek will be found to resemble blotches of erysipelas, and 
 appear a little elevated. The early, imperfect ripening of 
 tho fruit has a tendency to spread this disease. Those who 
 are not acquainted with the effects of the disease, on discov- 
 ering what they consider a new and early variety, often pro- 
 cure buds which they insert into healthy trees, any one bud 
 of which is sufficient to communicate the disease and conse- 
 quently to kill the tree in two or three years. Again, their 
 early fall and appearance of maturity taking place at a time 
 when peaches bring the highest price in New York, immense 
 quantities of them are sent to that market, and from thence 
 through the Northern States, thus distributing tho seeds 
 over a great extent of country, every one of which, when 
 planted and trees raised from them, will be found to have 
 the yellows. 

There is another manner in which I think this disease is 
 spread, and that is by the pollen from the flowers. It is 
 allowed that when a peach tree has the yellows every part 
 of it is affected. If this is the case, then the pollen, being 
 a part of the tree, is diseased. The firmness of foundation 
 of plants is, I believe, correctly understood. The pollen is a 
 small globule of lymphatic matter secreted by the stamens, 
 which when disengaged floats in the atmosphere and is also 
 transported by bees from one flower to another, and when a 
 particle of this pollen strikes upon the point of the pistil of 
 another flower, which point is always wet at the time of in- 
 florescence, the globule ef farina bursts, and the lymph 13
