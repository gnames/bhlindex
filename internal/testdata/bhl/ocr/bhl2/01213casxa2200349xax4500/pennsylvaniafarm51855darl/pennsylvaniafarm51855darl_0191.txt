than an inch long, set with very little depression. Ca-

Exhibition of the Philadelphia Society for Promoting 
 Agriculture. 

This Society have concluded to hold an exhibition the 
 coming fall, and on the grounds at Powelton, occupied 
 by the State Society last year. It is the intention, we 
 understand, to combine with the usual display some 
 other objects of industrial pursuits, to increase the at- 
 tractiveness of the occasion, and for which the ample 
 extent of the grounds present unusual facilities. 

When the Philadelphia Society puts out its strength, 
 as it no doubt will do this time, a display may be ex- 
 pected for a county exhibition, unequalled. The commit- 
 tee having charge will of course fix the time so as not to 
 interfere with the State exhibition at Harrisburg, or of 
 our friends over at Camden. 

County Exhibitions. 
 Our friends throughout the State will please forward 
 as early as convenient for record in the Farm Journal, 
 the times and places of the various county exhibitions so 
 Soon as they are determined. We wish to insert them all 
 as soon as we have correct information, which will prob- 
 ably come most appropriately through some of the offi- 
 cers, also the names of the latter recently elected, or 
 holding over. 


ARTHUR'S PATENT AIR-TIGHT, SELF-SEALING CANS 
 AND JARS, 

For Preserving Fresh Fruits and Vegetables. 

This invention, for which a patent has been obtained, 
 commends itself to the attention of housekeepers and 
 others, on account of its great simplicity, and the effectu- 
 al manner in which it accomplishes a very desirable and 
 useful object. 

The following is the description of the patentee : "The 
 cans and jars are constructed with a channel around the 
 mouth, near the top, into which the cover fits loosely. 
 This channel is filled with a very adhesive cement, pre- 
 pared for the purpose, and allowed to harden. In order 
 to seal the vessel hermetically, it is only necessary to heat the 
 cover slightly, and press it into place, It may be opened 
 with as much ease as it is closed, by slightly warming 
 the top. The ordinary tin cans, used for the same pur- 
 pose for which this is intended, cannot be closed as is 
 well known without the aid of a tinner ; are difficult to 
 12 

open, and are generally so much injured in opening as 
 to be useless for future service. 

By this simple contrivance, the process of hermetical 
 sealing is placed conveniently within the reach of every 
 individual ; and fruit, vegetables and butter (if properly 
 prepared) may be kept with their natural flavor unim- 
 paired, for an indefinite length of time." 

We may add that there is no difficulty in preserving 
 fruits and vegetables fresh and perfect from one season 
 to another, all that is necessary being to expel and per- 
 fectly exclude the air. Our table is occasionally (May 22) 
 supplied with tomatoes of last j-ear's growth, as perfect 
 as the day they were put up, and we recently ate "peach 
 pie" equal to any made from fresh fruit in August or 
 September. For particulars as to price, &c, see adver- 
 tisement. 

ELDRIDGE'S PATENT CORN SHELLER. 

The above is a representation of this machine, which 
 for simplicity and adaptation to the purpose intended, 
 is not surpassed. It occupies about one foot by three, 
 weighs about forty-four pounds, and is intended for one 
 pcrsoyi to feed and shell. We are informed that one man 
 with it may readily shell from ten to twelve bushels per 
 hour with ease. It does the work well, seldom leaving 
 a grain on the cob, and depositing the shelled earn in a 
 small compass. 

It appears highly adapted to a small farm, or to any 
 one who does not want more than one hundred bushels 
 shelled per day.

 and Montgomery counties, and of the city of Philadel- 
 phia, also shop right and single machine. Application 
 may be made to N. J. Embree, 273 Race Street, above

Varieties of Roots for Field Culture. 
 To keep our readers posted up in respect to the 
 characterstics of vegetables usually sown for field culture, 
 and the peculiar properties of each, we subjoin a short 
 description, first of the Carrot, four kinds of which are 
 used by our farmers and gardeners. 

The Early Horn Carrot is of a deeper red color than 
 any other variety, as well as of smaller size, and of 
 finer flavor. It is only cultivated in this country, in the
