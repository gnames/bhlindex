my neighborhood, when it is intended as a direct improv- 
 er of the soil, is to sow them broad cast between the 
 rows of corn at the last working of the corn, and then 
 cover them over with a harrow or drag; the corn should 
 be cut off as soon in the fall as it is matured properly, 
 and then the peas grow finely, and by the time for sowing 
 wheat, (which most usually follows our' corn crop,) to 
 have a fine coat of pea vines on the land which shall be 
 turned under by deep ploughing, and the wheat sown 
 down in the customary manner. 

The advantages in the pea as a fertilizer are that it is 
 of quick growth, and I may say unfailing — that is with 
 us, where our clover is often killed out by the drouth. 
 I do not "wish to be understood however to say that the 
 pea shall take the place of clover — far from it; I only 
 recommend it as an improver of the land, and by this 
 means we assist the growth of clover. Another advan- 
 tage the pea possesses, is that it can be grown on the 
 poorest land, and again it is a cheap article; the seed 
 generally sells in our market from seventy-five cents to a 
 dollar per bushel, and when planted in the way I have 
 mentioned, it needs no extra work; making it, taking all 
 things into consideration, the cheapest fertiliser in my 
 humble opinion that can be made use of. 

The pea planted in this way of course is only intended 
 to improve the land, but when they are required for seed 
 and to feed stock, they should be planted earlier and in a 
 different manner. Yours • T. J. W

Profits of the Cold Grapery. 

BY WILLIAM CHORLTON, OF NEW-BRIGHTON, STATEN ISLAND. 

In the Horticulturist of February, 1852, at the request 
 of the late A J. Downing, I gave a practical account of 
 the Cold Grapery at this place which was planted in 
 March, 1850, and, as the question, "will it pay," has 
 often been put to me during the interval of time which 
 has elapsed, I thought that an estimate based upon the 
 produce and expenses up to the present time, might be 
 of service in your journal. I would here premise that 
 there is nothing extraordinary in the amount of fruit, 
 more than what others are obtaining by skill, care and 
 attention. The average weight of the respective crops 
 given, if taken collectively, would be one pound per 
 bunch, all of which would have readily sold at from fifty 
 to seventy-five cents per pound ; the lowest price, howev- 
 er, is only calculated. The following number of bunches 
 of good quality have been cut in the respective years : 
 1851, 262 bunches; 1852, G18 bunches; 1853, 918 
 buuches ; 1854, 1147 bunches ; making a total of 2945 
 bunches. 

The following calculation, which is as correctly stated 
 as can be, will show the balance side of the question : 

2945 lbs., at 60 cts $1472 50 

Deduct labor, 1st year, $50 00 

" " 2d " ..100 00 

" " 3d " ..150 00 

" " 4th " 200 00 

" " 5th " 225 00 

Yearly dressings of manure, at $20, 100 00 
 Repairs, painting, &c, 200 00—1025 00 

$447 50 

By the above example it will be seen that there is 
 $447 above the wholesale market prices, and as the 
 house, border, &c, cost about $2000, it leaves a surplus 
 profit of 4J per cent, per annum upon invested capital, 
 which, in the position, looks somewhat low ; but it must 
 be understood that, in this case, profit was not the object 
 — every thingwas done, regardless of expense, to make 
 a good and handsome structure. The best French glass 
 was used, and all labor paid by the day ; besides which 
 in the fir,st year there is no return profit, and the last 
 season is the only one in which a full crop has been al- 
 lowed. Take into consideration, too, that the labor ac- 
 count for management is reckoned at $2 per day, and it 
 will be readily seen that a good and suitable house may 
 be built and tended so as to give a large return profit. 
 A house of equal dimensions, and well finished, can be 
 erected at $12 per lineal foot, with the exception of cis- 
 tern, force-pump, hose and tank; and if we make an es- 
 timate of all incidental expenses on a house equal to the 
 above, and fifty feet long, it will stand thus: 
 House 50 feet long furnished with two coats 

of paint, at $12, $600 00 

Brick cistern, cemented, 10 feet square, 70 00 

Tank, Force-pump and Hose, 90 00 

25 tons of manure for borders at $2, 50 00 

Material for drainage, 20 00 

90 bushels of bones, at 50 cts., 45 00 

100 bushels of charcoal, &c, 15 00 

Labor — making borders, &c, 20 00 

48 vines, at 50 cts., 24 00 

$934 00 
 As, in the first example, the house is 74 feet long, and, 
 in the latter, 50 feet, the comparative weight of fruit 
 that may be taken will be about two-thirds, or 1964 lbs., 
 at the same prices, making the total value for five years 
 $982; and making the same comparison in labor, expen- 
 ses, &c, in both cases, we may put down $298 gain up- 
 on a capital $934, whieh shows a profit of six per ceut. 
 per annum, and this, too, at the commencement. If we 
 were to calculate upon seven years, the per centage would 
 amount to nine per cent; and continued further, it would 
 be still greater, as the vines will continue each season to 
 produce a full crop. 

From these illustrations it will be readily seen that, 
 with good management, there is no loss in having a 
 Cold Grapery, even though partial failure may occur.—

Barnum's Autobiography. 

Any notice of the above work is rather inappropriate 
 in a Farm Journal, but as Barnum has become notorious 
 over the length and breadth of the land, by a successful 
 system of imposture, and as his book has been circulated 
 extensively perhaps even among the agricultural com- 
 munity, we copy the following extract from Blackwood 
 to show the opinion they entertain of it in England. It is 
 the first time in this country, that a man has dared pub- 
 licly to boast of falsehood and immorality, and to incul- 
 cate before the youth of the country the sentiment that 
 successful imposture is no crime. The article concludes 
 thus:
