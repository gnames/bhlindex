THE FARM JOURNAL.

trashy or offensive book than this; and we should not have 
 considered it worthy of the least notice, had we looked 
 merely on the intrinsic merits of its contents. But it is 
 worth noticing as a satire upon all of us; and we hope it 
 may have the effect — very different from what its author 
 intended — of opening the eyes of the public for some 
 little lime at least, to the shameless exhibitions which 
 have become matter of regular trade and speculation. 

If we could enter, with any tiling like a feeling of zest, 
 into the relations of this excessively shameless book, we 
 should be inclined to treat its publication as the most 
 daring hoax which the author has yet perpetrated upon 
 the public. But it has inspired us with nothing but sen- 
 sations of disgust for the frauds which it narrates, amaze- 
 ment at its audacity, loathing for its hypocrisy, abhor- 
 rence for the moral obliquity which it betrays, and sincere 
 pity for the wretched man who compiled it. He has 
 left nothing for his worst enemy to do ; for he has fairly 
 gibbeted himself. No unclean bird of prey, nailed igno- 
 mini ously to the door of a barn, can present a more hu- 
 miliating spectacle than this Phineas Taylor Barnum, 
 as he appears in his Autobiography." 

Apples of Western New York. 

The winter apples of 1854 have generally been very 
 good and choice. The country has been thoroughly can- 
 vassed for what are left up to this writing, (April 16th,) 
 and Rozbury Russets, the most plentiful, are taken at 
 three dollars per barrel. A dealer told me he was to 
 pay one farmer $1200 for 400 barrels of them of his own 
 raising. Wheat at $2,50, the ruling price, cannot pay 
 better. 

The Esopus Spitzenburg, Baldwin, and Rhode Island 
 Greening, have been good, but are taken in th,e fall for 
 shipment. The few left, as sold by fruiterers, I have 
 noticed to be very fair and well flavored. 

The Canada Red and Northern Spy have never been 
 better. The last named I have seen brought in from 
 different sources, and they are not only choice but very 
 beautiful. I have never seen finer specimens than a 
 parcel which a dealer obtained to retail from. They 
 were enormous in size, high colored, and as fresh and 
 juicy as any harvest apple. I inquired of the growers 
 of them as to the fruitfulness of the tree, and one answe- 
 red that it is only every other year that a full crop can be 
 expected ; others, that every year their trees bear. 

High culture is necessary, and the same care will give 
 a greater crop on all other trees. One person told me 
 that he knew of a cultivator of the Spy who put on a 
 plentiful top-dressing of stable manure, and the effect 
 wa3 that the next season his trees were loaded with high- 
 colored and large apples, bending the branches to the 
 ground. A large supply I find are brought to market 
 every season, and this day the price asked by those who 
 have them for sale is eight dollars per barrel, which is the 
 only objection to the Spy. J. II. Watts. — Rochester,

We copy the above from the Horticulturist, and the 
 idea has suggested on reading it, when shall we have 
 fruit culture pursued as a business on farms in Pennsyl- 
 vania ? Not merely a supply for one's own family, but 
 a regular crop made of fruit, the same as corn, wheat, 
 potatoes. We believe every acre devoted to fruit cul- 

ture in Pennsylvania, would pay a better profit in an av- 
 erage of ten years, than either of the others named, but 
 it must be pursued understandingly. Is there a farmer 
 in Pennsylvania, who would not be considered by his 
 neighbors a fit subject for the Asylum, if he was to haul 
 out on his orchard, "a plentiful top-dressing of stable 
 manure," and yet we should think eight dollars per bar- 
 rel for apples, one dollar and a half per dozen for pears, 
 &c, would pay well for his manure, and allow an ample 
 margin for purchasing Guano, Super-phosphate of Lime, 
 &c, for his other crops. 

The time has gone by when farming must be considered 
 a mere drudgery, and nothing thought of but that inter- 
 minable rotation, corn, oats and wheat. With present 
 and prospective prices, farming must be considered fully 
 equal as regards profit, and the accumulation of wealth, 
 to any kind of merchandising, if the farmer chooses to 
 abandon the dull routine of olden time, sanctionod only 
 by habit, if he chooses to imitate the merchant in watch- 
 ing his market, in studying the most profitable articles 
 for his production, if he chooses to keep regular book ac- 
 counts of profit and loss, and if he chooses to use the ^ 
 same energy in thoroughly mastering his business in all 
 its details, both scientific and practical. 

Many years ago it used to be said that a farmer in 
 portioning out occupations for his sons, would assign one 
 brighter than the rest for a lawyer, a second for a doc- 
 tor, and a third showing signs of activity and energy for 
 a merchant, and poor Dick, who had always been a 
 heavy dull boy both in and out of school, who could be 
 a full hand only at eating molasses candy, or at the din- 
 ner table, who could only be roused to show signs of life 
 by half a dozen claps of thunder, and whose only am- 
 bition was to circumvent a ground hog or catch a musk 
 rat, he would do for a farmer. 

Things now are changed, and to be a first rate farmer, 
 in all its multiplied relations and duties, requires a 
 high order of intellect, and most persevering habits of 
 investigation and study. 

Conservatories. 
 A correspondent of the Horticulturist inquires, if con- 
 servatories or green-houses attached to dwellings can be 
 made successful. I can answer affirmatively, as I have 
 had the management of one for many years so situated. 
 This green-house is attached to the dwelling in the angle 
 formed by the main house and back building, facing 
 south, with the parlor windows and hall door opening 
 into it. The roof is of tin, supported by pillars, in which 
 the sash is made to fit, so that they may be removed in 
 summer, leaving an open piazza. There are outside 
 shutters. The floor is of brick, which enables you to use 
 water freely, and retains a proper degree of moisture 
 throughout the house. It is heated by a small coal stove 
 of cast iron, which consumes about a quarter of a ton of 
 coal during the winter. Hardy green-house plants do 
 perfectly well here, such as Lemon and Orange trees, 
 Laurustinus, Myrtle, Sweet Bay, Jasamins, Camellias, 
 Rhododendrons, Pelargoniums, Coronellas, Primulas, Ox- 
 alis, Violets, Wall Flowers and Stock Gillies. Many of 
 the annuals also will bloom beautifully in the spring. I 
 call these plants hardy, as I have had, occasionally, two 
 or three degrees of frost in the house without injury. I
