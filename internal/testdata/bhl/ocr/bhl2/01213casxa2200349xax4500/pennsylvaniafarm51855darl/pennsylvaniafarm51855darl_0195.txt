consider a fire only necessary when the thermometer is 
 likely to be below 20° out of doors. I have never perceiv- 
 ed any dampness or unhealthiness to proceed from this 
 house. On the contrary, it is delightful to see from the 
 parlor windows, in cold winter weather, the Lemon trees 
 loaded with their beautiful golden fruit, and rich dark- 
 green leaves ; and then you have the odor of the Lau- 
 rustinus, Mignonette, Violets, Stock Gillies, and other 
 sweet flowers, diffused through your dwelling. 

This is, I think, the cheapest and most convenient way 
 cf having a green-house attached to your dwelling. The 
 expense may, of course, be increased indefinitely and 
 without any ill effects, either from dampness or unhealth- 
 iness. H. N. Johnson. — Germantoicn, Pa. 

Philadelphia Society for Promoting Agriculture. 

The April meeting of this S6ciety took place after our 
 last number had gone to press. We extract the following 
 introduction and resolutions from the published proceed- 
 ings : — Dr. Elwyri reported the death of Chauncey P. 
 Holcomb, Esq., of Delaware, and after paying a just 
 tribute to the memory of the deceased, offered the fol- 
 lowing resolutions, which were unanimously adopted : 

Resolved, That this society has heai'd with deep regret, 
 of the death of Chauncey P. Holcomb, Esq., of Delaware. 
 His long, earnest and faithful services in the cause of 
 agriculture have entitled him to the respect of the far- 
 mers of the country, and made for him a reputation which 
 will long endure among all who esteem the noble art 
 on which it rests. His liberal and disinterested feelings; 
 his efforts, controlled as they were by a high purpose ; 
 his intentions directed ever for the public good — give 
 him a claim to be enrolled among the patriots of his 
 country. 

Resolved, That this body deeply sympathise with the 
 State in which he lived, with the friends to whom he 
 was endeared, and those relatives who are left to mourn 
 the loss they will find, irreparable. 

We have been furnished with the following letter 
 comprising the substance of a verbal communication on 
 the subject of the conversion of offal flesh into manure, 
 by Robert Hare, M. D., Emeritus Professor of Chemistry 
 in the University of Pennsylvania: 

291 Chesnut St., June 9th, 1854. 

Dr. A. L. Elwyn, President of the Philadelphia So- 
 ciety for Promoting Agriculture, — My Dear Sir: — My 
 object this morning in making a verbal communication 
 to the Agricultural Society, was to suggest that the car- 
 cases of dogs, killed under the "dog law," so called, 
 might be employed to cany out upon a larger scale some 
 experiments, of which I made mention to the Society 
 some years since, in which fish or flesh was converted 
 into a pulverizable mass equivalent to guano. 

It would only be requisite to steep the animals in a 
 solution of about three parts sulphuric acid, and four 
 parts of salt, and thirty of water, for from six to twelve 
 hours, and subsequently to dry them under a shed pro- 
 tecting them from rain, by an anthracite fire as meat is 
 smoked. 

Preferably, the skin should be removed before the 
 steeping, and the abdomen opeued. The animals, how- 
 ever, might be stunned by a blow and thrown into the 
 solution, or they might be injected with the solution by the 

jugular artery, and also through the gullet or rectum. 
 Hydrostatic pressure might be made by placing the so- 
 lution in any elevated position, in an upper story for in- 
 stance, of any building resorted to, and bringing it down 
 by a small leaden pipe. 

When the desiccation is effected by heat, as above 
 suggested, it may be carried to the temperature of mel- 
 ting tin nearly, say four hundred degrees, without di- 
 minishing the ammoniacal elements. When this heat is 
 used, the whole mass becomes friable and easily reduced 
 to powder, the bones as well as the flesh. Slugs roasted 
 to this point become as brittle as glass. This fact was 
 verified on a pretty large scale by the liberal assistance 
 of Robert Gilmey, Esq., of Maryland, who wrote a most 
 favorable account of the success of the resulting manure. 
 When animal matter, such as slugs or bones, are heated 
 in a closed vessel,, the first escape of the ammoniacal ele- 
 ments may be detected by a feather dipped in muriatic 
 acid, or by a very weak and almost colorless solution of 
 blue vitriol or sulphate of copper. 

Fetor is converted by wood, tar, or rosin, which may 
 be made more active by mixing with oil of turpentine. 

Sincerely, the well-wisher of yourself, and of the So- 
 ciety, truly yours, [Signed,] ROBERT HARE. 

Horticulturist — Removal to Philadelphia. 

Our readers will all be gratified to learn that the Hor- 
 ticulturist has Been purchased by a citizen of Philadel- 
 phia, and will be removed here in time for the issue of 
 the July number. The new editor, John Jay Smith, is a 
 resident within the now consolidated city, and who has 
 long been recognised as one of the most able contributors 
 to its pages 

Hereafter he will have the exclusive editorial control, 
 and will be assisted by the many other competent pens 
 in our city and vicinity, who have already done so much 
 to advance the Horticulturist to its present high position, 
 as the leading paper of its class in the United States. 

Our experience with the Farm Journal is, that the 
 large cities are the best localities for the publication of 
 such periodicals, and we think the change from Rochester 
 to Philadelphia a most fortunate one. The Horticultu- 
 rist has not a local, but a national reputation, and Phil- 
 adelphia is entitled to the place, not only as being the 
 great central point between north and south, but also 
 from having always maintained the front rank in its 
 Horticultural and Floral exhibitions, its numerous pri- 
 vate and public green-houses, suburban residences, and 
 the prevailing taste in this direction of its population. 

Ably as it has heretofore been conducted, we hazard 
 nothing in saying from our knowledge of the new editor, 
 his fine taste as a practical Horticulturist, and acknowl- 
 edged ability as a writer, that its reputation will be fully 
 sustained. 

Reaping and Mowing Machines. — Infringements of 
 Patents. 

While the war is progressing in the Crimea, a war has 
 also been raging within a few weeks past among the 
 Patentees of Reapers and Mowers, and which being 
 somewhat nearer at hand, has perhaps affected the sen- 
 sibilities of our farmers and manufacturers more directly 
 than the other.
