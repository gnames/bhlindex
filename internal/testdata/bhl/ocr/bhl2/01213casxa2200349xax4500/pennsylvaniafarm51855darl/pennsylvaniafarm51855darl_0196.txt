McCorniick, alleging that Manny's, and some other 
 reapers, have infringed on his patent, in respect to the 
 reel, side delivery, and other improvements, applied for 
 injunctions, which have been granted, and are to come 
 off for trial next month. 

Howard & Co., the proprietors of Ketchum's Patent, 
 have also obtained injunctions, against Forbush's ma- 
 chine, which was subsequently compromised by the lat- 
 ter paying about eight thousand dollars, and further pro- 
 ceedings stayed. As the principles involved in the above 
 attachments also affected many other machines, having 
 more or less deviations from the original Patent of Mc- 
 Corniick, many of our farmers in this section, for fear of 
 difficulty, have been deterred from purchasing, or at 
 least have hesitated. 

As regards Allen's Mowing Machine, and Manny's 
 Reaper and Mower, which have been extensively sold in 
 Pennsylvania, we are now able to state that the manu- 
 facturers have made a compromise by which a consider- 
 ation has been paid for the infringement, and the sales- 
 allowed to proceed for this year. 

Farmers, therefore, who have concluded to purchase 
 either Allen's Mower, or Manny's Combined Reaper and 
 Mower, have no occasion to be deterred by any fear of 
 legal proceedings. 

Animal Portraits. 

The present and prospective rates of beef, mutton and 
 dairy products, have brought about, among our enter- 
 prising farmers, a very general disposition to improve 
 their stock by purchasing, even at high prices, superior 
 animals to cross with selections of our native breeds. 
 Correct animal portraits, giving true and desirable points 
 in the form, for study and comparison, are often very 
 useful, besides gratifying a very honorable pride in their 
 owners. 

The void left by Woodside, the" greatest animal pain- 
 ter this country has produced, has never yet been filled. 
 His figures were all master pieces, recognizable at first 
 sight, and portraying not only true outlines of form, but 
 expression and character. Poetanascitur, nonfit, is equal- 
 ly true of portrait painters. No study, or course. of study, 
 will create a talent of this kind. Exercise and practice 
 will improve, but cannot originate it. A man may take 
 and convey to canvass the form, but the artist alone can 
 catch the life, spirit, and expression. We have been in- 
 duced to these remarks, by examination of a remarkably 
 well executed oil painting of S. Holman's Norman horse, 
 by Clarkson, 182 Chesnut st., which he has deposited in 
 the office of the Farm Journal for a short time, on exhi- 
 bition, and to which we invite the attention of visitors. 
 In very many particular's, it is admirably executed, and 
 indicates a natural talent in this department, which, if 
 properly cultivated, may result in something eminent. 
 Clarkson has also executed oil paintings for several 
 other farmers, and as his attention is now being much 
 given to it, we should be pleased to see him encouraged. 

L. G. Morris's Improved Stock. 
 L. G. Morris, of Mount Fordham, Westchester county, 
 New York, has issued a very handsomely illustrated cata- 
 logue of his neat cattle, horses, sheep and swine, which is 
 superior to any thing of the kind yet gotten up in this 

country. They were drawn by Page, and engraved by 
 Orr, of New York, and are highly creditable to their 
 skill as artists. Although the figures are beautiful, and 
 almost faultless, they yet convey the idea that they are 
 both truthful and natural, each animal having a distinct 
 character. Such as are for sale have the prices affixed. 
 He offers to forward the catalogue by mail to applicants. 

Public Sale of Durham Cattle and Southdown Sheep. 

J. M. Sherwood, of Auburn, New York, advertises to 
 sell at public sale his entire herd of Short-Horn cattle, 
 twenty-five in number, and nearly all imported, on the 
 20th of June. Also at the same time, seventy-five head of 
 Southdown Sheep, many of them imported, and from the 
 flock of Jonas Webb, and their descendants. Also a few 
 Suffolk hogs. 

We have never seen the above stock, but have long 
 known the owner, as having some of the best animala 
 in New York, and presume their pedigrees can be relied 
 upon. 

More Durham Cattle for Chester County. 
 We understand George Brinton, Jr., of Chester county, 
 and whose fine stock, has at different times been por- 
 trayed in the Farm Journal, has recently added to hia 
 herd, a very superior bull calf from Kentucky, which we 
 are glad to hear has safely arrived at his farm. He is of 
 some of the best blood in the country, and we hope to 
 furnish his pedigree for our next number. Chester and 
 Delaware counties are going to maintain the lead in 
 Pennsylvania for good stock. 

Farmers' High School. 

Before this number reaches our readers, they will very 
 generally have been advised of the failure of the bill to 
 obtain any pecuniary aid for the Farmers' High School 
 from the State Legislature. 

Mortifying as is the fact, it was not at all unexpected 
 to us. The remedy for such benighted legislation or 
 rather want of legislation is with the farmers themselves. 
 They must send men to Harrisburg of more enlarged 
 minds, who can comprehend better the true interest of 
 the State. We cannot yet despair of better times, and 
 more enlightened action. 

Fine Lemon Tree. 
 As an instance of success in growing lemons, under 
 the ordinary circumstances of a farm house without a 
 green house, we may mention that our friend Mary Ann 
 Rhodes of Locust Grove Farm, Southampton township, 
 Bucks county, recently plucked one from her tree weigh- 
 ing eleven ounces. It was always a profuse bearer, and 
 under her skillful management produces lemons of the 
 largest size. Its place for standing in the summer is 
 under the piazza. 

United States Agricultural Society 
 We understand the above Society have made arrange ' 
 ments to hold their exhibition the coming fall at Cam- 
 den, New Jersey, opposite Philadelphia, and at the same 
 time and place as the New Jersey State Exhibition. 
 The "Philadelphia Society for Promoting Agriculture" 
 have not, at the time of our going to press, fixed upon
