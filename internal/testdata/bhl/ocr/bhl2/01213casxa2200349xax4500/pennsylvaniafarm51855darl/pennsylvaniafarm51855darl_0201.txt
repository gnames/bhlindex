Runnymede Farm, the Residence of Christopher Fallon, 
 of Philadelphia. 

We lately had occasion to pay a visit to the above farm, 
 and as any practical illustrations of good culture and suc- 
 cessful management tend to stimulate others in the same 
 path, so far at least as the knowledge of it is communicated, 
 we take the liberty of spreading a little of what we saw 
 through the pages of the Farm Journal. 

In the first place we would remark that the proprietor is 
 an eminent Lawyer of Philadelphia, of very extensive daily 
 business, who yet finds it both convenient and pleasant to 
 reside with his family out of town, about seven miles, all the 
 year round, both summer and winter — an example, we are 
 glad to say, which is being yearly more extensively followed 
 •in all our principal cities by business men. We can conceive 
 of nothing in this world, after a clear conscience, more 
 desirable than precisely such an establishment as that at 
 Runnymede farm, where wealth has not only concentrated 
 all the luxurious appendages which wealth only can procure, 
 both in doors and out, such as an elegant mansion, com- 
 manding an extensive view, supplied with the city luxuries 
 of gas, made on the place, in every story, also water, heated 
 air, &c, and outside, beautiful gardens, conservatory, green- 
 houses, grapery, fish-pond, fruit trees in every variety, pro- 
 ductive vegetables — garden and forcing frames, well furnish- 
 ed lawn, ice-house, carriage houses, &c.j but combined with 
 the above a highly improved, cultivated and productive/arm. 

In the absence of the proprietor, we were shown over the 
 latter, and tho improved stock, some of which were imported 
 last season, by his manager and superintendent, George 
 Drayton, whose skill and experience may be inferred from 
 tho fact, that last year he received for premiums on stock 
 and crops, from our Stato and County Societies, about two 
 hundred and fifty dollars, as well as the first premium for 
 the largest crop of corn raised in Pennsylvania in 1854, 
 being one hundred and one bushels and twenty-seven quarts 
 to the acre. Runnymede contains over one hundred and 
 thirty acres, is in high order, and very productive. It used 
 to be managed as a dairy farm, but the cows were sold off 
 last spring, and the object now is to sell hay in Philadelphia, 
 and keep up the land by back loads of manure, a system 
 pursued by many around the city, and which works well. 

Many of the processes of culture, we have been so long 
 urging through the Farm Journal, we found in practice here, 
 such as deep plowing, sown corn fodder, root culture, compos- 
 ting manures, thorough pulverization, and preparation of soil, 
 well arranged barns and shodding, constant supply of water 
 for stock, Ac. 

The Double Michigan Plow was used this spring in plow- 
 ing for corn, and we also observed a plentiful supply of 
 compost in each hill, so that if the farmers in tho interior 
 are not watchful, the probability is that G. Drayton will 
 again carry off the first premium? for corn. The operation 
 of this plow proved entirely satisfactory, turning up to the 
 depth of thirteen or fourteen inches. At our visit the ground 
 was being dressed with a plentiful coat of sheep manure, 
 preparatory to being plowed down for carrots. Several hun- 
 dred bushels of these were raised last season, and fed with 
 great advantage, some fine long orange and white Belgians 
 being still in the root cellar, and answering well to make up 
 for the deficiency tho present spring of early pasture. 

Sown corn fodder is much relied on for winter use, and 
 was the means of allowing about twenty tons of hay to be 
 sold this spring at a high price, which would otherwise have 
 had to have been consumed on the farm. G. Drayton cures it 
 successfully for storing away in the barn, by cutting it at 
 the proper time, rearing it up along a convenient fence, and 
 securing it from being blown down by long straw or hay 

ropes secured over it to theposts; after one side is thoroughly 
 dried, these bands are loosened, and every pannel of fodder 
 is then turned on the other side, and when thoroughly cured, 
 tied up in sheaves, and hauled to the barn. 

The pasture and mowing grounds boro evidence of plen- 
 tiful top dressing, in their luxuriant growth. Good compost 
 made on tho place, and short manure, are relied on for this 
 purpose more than Guano, or any of the fashionable fertil- 
 izers of the day. One field was in with Rye Grass, and a small 
 patch with Lucerne, sown this season for experiment. The 
 Rye Grass has been found to be very productive and of rapid 
 growth. In all the stables, we observed care taken to pre- 
 serve the drainago from the stock, by conducting it to places 
 where none would be lost. Under the horse stables, was an 
 extensive manure cellar, where, by raising a door, every 
 thing could be shovelled down conveniently, and so arranged 
 below, being on the side of a bank, that a cart could readily 
 be backed up to haul it away for composting. The careful 
 preservation of every thing in the shape of manure from the 
 stables, henery, hog pen, &c, and its augmentation by judi- 
 cious composting, is one of the striking features of the good 
 management of the farm, and impressed us most favorably. 

The system being now to sell hay, of course it was not 
 heavily stocked, but the animals were all of the right kind. 
 Hose, imported last season, and whose portrait was in a for- 
 mer number of tho Journal, was in good condition, and in 
 her fine neck, head, and horns, a model of a well formed, 
 high bred animal. Nelly, also imported, has some very good 
 points, but we judge had at some time received an injury on 
 her back, behind the hips, which hurts her appearance. Her 
 heifer calf about five months old, of a light roan color, is 
 one of the most beautiful and promising animals we have 
 seen for a long time, and shows the high bred Durham in 
 every part; she combines size, with neatness and fine bone, 
 and a beautiful head and muzzle. Drayton informed us sho 
 never sucked a eow, but was taken otf immediately, and 
 raised by hand on good sweet milk. She did credit to her 
 keep. The young bull imported last season with the cows, 
 not having been turned out to pasture, still had his old coat 
 on, and was not quite in as good condition as he should 
 have been. He has good length of carcass, breadth on back 
 and hips, and other points, for making a fine animal when 
 fully developed and matured. 

We were gratified to find Drayton a full believer, from his 
 own experience, of the correctness of Guenon's theory, by 
 which he not only buys his cows, but also raises all his 
 calves. The marks on the escutcheons of several cows we 
 saw wore very prominent, and indicated, what they really 
 were, extraordinary milkers. We observed many other things 
 worthy of notice, but want of space obliges us to close. 

We may remark, that unlike many such establishments 
 in the vicinity of Philadelphia we could, name, where thous- 
 ands of dollars have been uselessly and irremediably squan- 
 dered, the proprietor of this magnificent estate has been 
 most fortunate in his farm manager, and in his gardener 
 and greenhouse man, Robert. Both thoroughly understand 
 their business, and every dollar spent,' and every piece of 
 labor performed, so far as we could observe, had been done 
 by men who knew what they were about, and had to be 
 done but onco. 

There are so many ignorant pretenders, who come over 
 from the old country, palming themselves off, especially in 
 the department of ornamental gardening, and who have 
 cost their employers not only in the erection of greenhouses 
 and graperies, but in their management afterwards, thous- 
 ands of dollars, that it has operated almost to create a dis- 
 gust, and dread to make even an effort in this direction, by 
 many of our wealthy citizens.
