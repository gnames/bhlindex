To Mark out straight Corn Rows. 
 For corn, take a stiff sod, plough it early and deep, turn 
 it completely, harrow until you pulverize thoroughly, plant 
 early, and cultivate to perfection. To do this you should 
 work your corn both ways. To have your rows straight, and 
 spaced evenly, you must make a machine of the following 
 description. Take a plank one and a half inches thick, say 
 nine or ten inches wide, and eight feet six inches long, then 
 three pieces three by five in three feet long each, throw them 
 down thus, four feet apart, then spike said plank on the top. 
 Out of the under side of each piece or runner cut two and a 
 half inches and insert a tooth taken from one of your culti- 
 vators; have it extended below the runner three and a half 
 or four inches. For handle bore one and a half inch hole 
 in the hinder part of each runner, so as to slope back. Insert 
 three pins or posts, and on the top put a lathe by boring one 
 inch hole, and fasten with nails or pins and your machine is 
 completed in less than two hours, if your materials and tools 
 are at hand. To attach your horse, take two common trace 
 chains or ropes about the same length, attach to the top of 
 each outside tooth by dropping on a link in place of washer, 
 then screw down the nut. Attach your horse with common 
 lead or plough gears. To use this machine properly, it takes 
 two persons, one to bare lightly on the handles and carry it 

round at the ends, and the other to lead the horse. To have 
 the rows evenly spaced, have a very light pole eight or ten 
 feet long tied under to the horse's bit so as to connect with 
 the rings of the bit, have a mark on the pole which the lea- 
 der must keep directly before him : after the first through the 
 leader must walk in the last furrow. 

The beauty of the work for the most part depends on tho 
 skill and judgement of the person who leads. In this way 
 you have your ground checkered completely with much less 
 cost. A CHESTER COUNTY FARMER. 

Our correspondent above, also recommends getting two 
 crops off the same field in one season by cutting the corn, 
 in the fall in wide strips, and sowing wheat immediately. 
 We always thought this a slovenly way of farming and not 
 to be recommended, except under very particular circum- 
 stances. What may be called clean culture can not be made 
 of it, and as early sown wheat has latterly been found to be 
 the best, the corn will not be sufficiently ripened to allow of 
 the proper preparation of the ground for wheat. A crop of 
 potatoes could be ripened and got off to much more advan- 
 tage, both for potatoes and wheat, than for either corn or 
 wheat as he suggests. — Ed.

 Large vs. Small Potatoes for Seed. 

J. L. Darlington: — I see a statement of Mr. C. T. Al- 
 vard, of AVilmington, Vermont, going the rounds in the 
 Village Record, in which he says, that he has been in tho 
 habit of planting large potatoes for seed, but one year he 
 run short of large ones and was compelled to finish planting 
 with small ones, the largest of which was not larger than a 
 common plum; and that he raised equally as good potatoes 
 from the small, as he did from the large seed. 

Now, if such is the case, why is it that when farmers go 
 to select their seed-corn, they pick the longest, the thickest, 
 the best grown, the largest grained and the ripest ears in 
 their crib? Why not lay their refuse corn aside to plant, if 
 they can raise as good a crop from it? Why is it that they 
 go to their wheat field and select the best lot of wheat in the 
 field, and put it away in their barns where they can get it for 
 seed? Why not take the smallest in the field? Tho reason 
 is obvious, there is not an intelligent, keen-sighted, reason- 
 able farmer in the country, but who knows that such a sys- 
 tem would be ruinous to his crops, because it is the direct 
 road to degeneration, which, in one year might be so trifling 
 as not to be observed, but follow up the same system for 
 twenty years, add twenty such degenerations together and 
 see what they will amount to. In my opinion, potatoes have 
 sustained more damage by planting small, indifferent, half- 
 ripe seed, and by planting the potatoe for ages without in- 
 termission, than it has by all other causes combined. The 
 potatoe, to do it justice, should be renewed from the seed of 
 the apple, at least, in every twelve or fifteen years. I firmly 
 believe that planting potatoes for successive ages without 
 renewing, and planting half-grown and half ripe seed, are 
 the main causes of the potatoe rot and failures in the crop.

Guano Inspection. 

Mr. Editor : — I have long been a subscriber to your 
 Journal, and have gathered therefrom much useful infor- 
 mation. I noticed in the last number, among the proceed- 
 ings of the State Agricultural Society, a Resolution calling 
 for the appointment of a State Guano Inspector; of which 
 I entirely approve, provided, we can prevent it from being 
 sanded, after it passes the inspection. 

I have been using guano more or less for the last three
