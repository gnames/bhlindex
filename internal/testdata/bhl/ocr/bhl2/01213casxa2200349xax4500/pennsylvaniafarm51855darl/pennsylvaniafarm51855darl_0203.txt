years, and my method of telling its quality, is this: I push 
 back that guano nearest the mouth of the bag so as to get 
 a fair sample, then I wet my finger so as a little will stick 
 to it, and taste it; if there is any perceptible feeling of grit 
 in it, I at once condemn it as of an inferior quality, for the 
 genuine article is very soft to the tongue, like any other 
 slimy material would be. I am aware that tasting guano is 
 by no means pleasant, but it is better than to be cheated.

The bill referred to by our correspondent failed in the 
 legislature, not because some good inspection law is not 
 required, but on account of the objectionable features of the 
 enormous perquisite attached to it, which would make an 
 annual salary for the Guano Inspector of about sixteen thou- 
 sand dollars. There were over one hundred applications for 
 the office, in consequence of the rich prospect it presented. 
 The test of Guano, alluded to by tasting, we do not consider 
 at all reliable. — Ed. 

Washing Machines. 

Mr. J. L. Darlington : — In a late number of the 
 Journal, you desire to know the merits of the different wash- 
 ing machines. I am unacquainted with any but Hollings- 
 worth's Knuckle Machine, manufactured at this place by J. 
 Roope & Co., and may be had at the Agricultural Ware- 
 house, West Chester, after the first of March, at $9 00. 
 This machine will do as much washing in two hours, as a 
 woman could do in a whole day's hard rubbing on the old 
 fashioned board. A boy twelve years old can work the ma- 
 chine without the least danger of injuring the finest articles 
 of clothing ; it is simple in its construction and plain in its 
 operation. The box is one foot by two feet four inches, and 
 twenty inches high. In the bottom of this box are placed 
 one hundred and fifty wooden balls, two inches in diameter, 
 which float when the water is put in ; the clothes are folded 
 and fastened into a sash which hangs on a lever above, and 
 works down through the middle of the box, and by opera- 
 ting the lever the clothes are rubbed up and down through 
 the balls, and will clean anything that soap and water will 
 takeout. Yours, &c, ■ A SUBSCRIBER.

 Charcoal for Fruit. 

Charcoal is a most excellent thing to put among the roots 
 of fruit trees, especially when planting them, at the rate of 
 a peck to two pecks to the tree. It keeps them healthy and 
 vigorous. The coals raked out of a common bake-oven 
 answer admirably. During the past winter I pruned my 
 orchard, and when done I hauled the brush to an open 
 space, kindled a fire, and "fed on" the branches until I had 
 all consumed; this done, I had a fine pile of coals, I then 
 took a shovel and covered them with soil, which excluded 
 the oxygen, retained the steam arising from the ground, 
 and pf course quietly extinguished the fire. In this way I 
 obtained from twelve to fifteen bushels of the very best of 
 charcoal — abundance to put among the roots of some trees 
 I was then planting. It would not do to heap the boughs 
 and then burn them, for that consumes them altogether.

Hermetically Sealed. 
 We often find this expression used to indicate an air-tight 
 stuffing box; but it should never be employed except for 
 expressing a closed joint made by melting the material of 
 which the joint is composed, such as a glass tube being mel- 
 ted and then closed. — Scientific American. 

Corn, Rye, and Indian Bread. 

Wo have been resolved into a committee for a special re- 
 port on this very important branch of the great culinary art, 
 and if our readers do not understand and act discreetly in 
 reference to it hereafter, it is not our fault. 

We profess to speak, in the following passages, ex cath- 
 edra, and if others do not succeed in their earlier experi- 
 ments, they must try again. 

Corn-Bread as made at Green's, Chamrers-St., N. Y.: 
 — Take 7 pints yellow corn-meal, 3 pints wheat flour, and 
 mix them well together; then 6 eggs, well-broken, 2 cups of 
 melted butter, and a little salt and sugar to suit the taste. 
 Put this mass together, and mix with, milk to make a batter 
 about the consistency or stiffness of paste prepared for drop- 
 cake. Then dissolve three teaspoons-full of cream of tar- 
 tar, and the same of soda ; pour it upon the mass, stir it 
 thoroughly, and dip it at once into pans, and bake in a hot 
 oven. 

CORN-BREAD AS MADE AT CROOKS', ChATHAM-St., N. Y.: — 

Take 1 quart of milk, 3 eggs, beaten, butter half the size of 
 an egg, cream tartar, 1 teaspoonful, salt and sweeten to your 
 taste. To this add corn-meal to make a paste about the 
 consistency of griddle-cakes ; put in pan immediately, and 
 bake in a hot oven. 

Boston Brown-Bread : — To make this article, take of 
 best yellow corn-meal two parts ; of unbolted rye-meal (the 
 rye should be screened before grinding) one part ; partially 
 wet and mix the corn meal with hot water, then add the rye 
 and the yeast, (hop-yeast, one pint to nine quarts of meal,) 
 and thoroughly mix with more warm water, if necessary, to 
 make a mass neither hard nor soft, but stiff enough to be 
 transferred with care by the hand from the kneading trough 
 to the pan; then let it stand till it begins to show signs of 
 rising ; put it into the pans, and let it stand a few minutes, 
 if it is not "rising" too fast, then put it to bake ; if in a brick 
 oven, six hours will be none too many ; if in a common stove 
 or range, care must be had not to burn, and bake from three 
 to six hours according to size of loaf. The heat should be 
 moderate after the first two hours, but steady ; keep up a 
 scalding heat after the outside is browned properly. 

Many people use three quarts or pounds of rye-meal to 
 five quarts or pounds of corn-meal, which, we think, are the 
 best proportions for pure New England "rye and Indian." 
 S. D. Ostrander, Boston brown-bread baker, of this city, 
 378 Bleecker street, uses 2 parts rye to 4 of corn meal, and 
 hop-yeast, adding a little molasses to a part to suit the taste 
 of customers. Too much molasses is worse than none for 
 most people. 

But we next give the receipt which we would set forth as 
 making a better article than all the brown-bread ever baked 
 in the city of Boston, where, of course* bakers only imitate 
 tho "real original" article made by the housewives of Yan- 
 keeland. It will be perceived that we still hold on upon 
 milk, and though a large proportion of this bread is mixed 
 with water only, we go for this liquid as a valuable improve- 
 ment. 

Real New-England Brown-Bread : — Take equal pro- 
 portions of sifted rye and Indian meal, mix them well to- 
 gether; add half a tea-cup-full of molasses, and two gills of 
 good yeast, to about three quarts of the mixed meal. Wet 
 this with good new milk, sufficient to make a dough that can 
 easily be worked, even with one hand. For economy's sake, 
 milk that has stood twelve hours, and from which the cream 
 has been taken, may be a substitute for the new milk; or 
 water which has been pressed from boiled squash, or in 
 which squash has been boiled, is a substitute much better 
 than pure water. But warm water is more commonly used. 
 The ingredients should be thoroughly mixed, and stand, in
