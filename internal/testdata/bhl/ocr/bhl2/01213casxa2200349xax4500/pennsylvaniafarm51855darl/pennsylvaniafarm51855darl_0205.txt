Scotland ; these half-bred bullocks weigh exceedingly well 
 accordiug'to size — no beast better. The Herefords have 
 beautiful, fine-grained, marbled flesh; but many of them 
 are light in their thighs and lean flesh, and deceive the 
 butchers in weight, especially when they are patchy with 
 pommels of fat flesh without, and but little tallow within. 
 I consider the Durham cattle, take them all in all, are the 
 best breed for the farmer or breeder for profit;' and Sir 
 Charles Knightley's Durham oxen, when cut up, are as good 
 flesh as the best Herefords, and are worth as much per 
 pound. When I speak of Durhams, I do not mean coarse

Ordered, that a vote of thanks be tendered to A. II. Ernst,

 dening, by G. M. Kern. 

On motion of D. R. King, "Resolved, That this Society 
 has heard with pleasure of the purchase of the periodical 
 called the "Horticulturist," by a gentleman of this city, and 
 of its future location and publication here, and cordially 
 recommend it to the patronage of its members, and that of 
 the community generally." 

Mr. Cope remarked, in connection with this subject, that 
 due regard had not been expressed towards the original Ed- 
 itor of the "Horticulturist" by this community, and he hoped 
 that the subscriptions to tho fund for the erection of a mon- 
 ument to Mr. Downing would be speedily made at Mr. Buist's, 
 where the book is left for that purpose. 

A New Oil Plant. 

The small troe(Castiglionia lobata,) known in Peru under 
 the name of "Pinoncello," and cultivated about Surco, nua- 
 cho, and Sambageque, also growing wild in considerable 
 abundance in those regions, it has been ascertained, yields 
 a valuable oil, well adapted to the purposes of illumination. 
 Its bean like fruit, or seeds, when roasted, have an agree- 
 able flavor, preferable to that of the olive. When eaten raw, 
 the etherial oil generated between tho kernel and the outer 
 skin is a strong cathartic, the effects of which can only be 
 counteracted by drinking cold water. It has been ascer- 
 tained that the seeds will grow in Baltimore ; and, doubtless, 
 plantations of this tree might be formed in many parts of 
 the South, from which vast quantities of oil might be pro- 
 duced, and thus add another link to the great chain of our 
 national wealth. The Patent Office has taken measures to 
 procure some of the seeds of this tree for trial in the South 
 and South-west. 

Crops in Virginia. 

The Fredericksburg Herald of tho 7th says:— "Tho wheat 
 prospect in Stafford and King George, for twenty-five miles 
 along the Rappahannock, is unusually promising. In many 
 fields the growth is knee high, promising an early harvest. 
 The joint worm generally makes its appearance about the 
 15th. Wo have heard but little of it thus far.
