Adaptation of the Lands of N6W Jersey for Agricultural 
 Purposes. 

BY HON. WILLIAM PARRY, CINNAMINSON, N. J. 

Respected Friend, E. C. Brewster : — Thy favor 
 was duly received, relating to the agricultural conditions 
 of Pennsylvania and New Jersey, and stating that the 
 following assertions had been made, viz: "The State of 
 "Pennsylvania is a better agricultural State than the 
 "State of New Jersey, even on an average being taken 
 "as to size ;" and requesting an answer, giving my views 
 on that subject, with which it affords me pleasure to 
 comply. 

Each State possesses some advantages not enjoyed by 
 the other, which may be readily pointed out, but to sum 
 up the whole and strike a true balance is a different 
 matter. 

The land in the northern part of New Jersey is of 
 much the same character and quality "as in Pennsylva- 
 nia ; the same range of mountains extending through 
 each State, with this difference in favor of New Jersey, 
 its location being between Pennsylvania and New York 
 it is that much nearer the best market, and about as 
 well supplied with railroads as Pennsylvania. 

The geographical position of New Jersey, with refer- 
 ence to agriculture, has no rival ; lying between the two 
 commercial emporiums and near the largest manufac- 
 turing districts in the Union, nearly surrounded by the 
 great waters connecting us with other continents, well 
 supplied with rivers, creeks, and smaller streams, pene- 
 trating throughout the interior, many of them naviga- 
 ble, on which the gentle ebb of tide carries the products 
 of the soil, lumber, grain, and staple articles, to mar- 
 ket, and the returning flood brings back merchandise 
 and manure to supply the farmers' wants, which gives to 
 New Jersey great natural advantages so far as relates to 
 carrying agricultural crops to market, but since the in- 
 troduction of railroads, water communication has become 
 less important. Sections of country that could not be 
 supplied with water conveyance may now be better ac- 
 commodated without it. 

So far as internal improvements and liberal legislation 
 can foster agriculture by facilitating the transportation 
 of crops from distant parts to market, and carrying back 
 fertilizing materials to enrich the soil, thereby placing 
 the remote portions of the State nearly on an equality 
 with the frontier farms, Pennsylvania has the advantage, 
 more on account of the course pursued in relation to 
 the construction of railroads than from strength of soil 

to support agricultural crops, for where that deficiency 
 is found in Jersey land, it is fully compensated by the 
 greater ease with which it is worked. 

The following statement of the crops and value of 
 land, taken from the Census Report, will serve to show 
 the present agricultural conditions of each State. 

Pennsylvania in size and population is about five times 
 as great as New Jersey, and has more than six times as 
 many acres of farm land improved. 

State of Pennsylvania. New Jersey. 

Value per acre of farm land, $27 $43 

Average number acres in each farm, 117 • 115 

value of each farm, 83,197 $5,030 

Bushels of wheat, 15,367,091 1,601,190 

Average per acre, 15 

Bushels of rye, 4,805,160 1,255,578 

Average per acre, 14 8 

Indian corn, 19,835,214 8,750,704 

Average per acre, 20 33 

Oats. 20,641,819 3,083,524 

Average per acre, 22 26 

Value of orchard products, $723,389 $607,26 

Average for each farm, $5 $2 

Products of market gardens, $688,714 $475.24 

Bushels potatoes, 6.032.904 3.715,25 

Value of poultry, $685,801 $336,95 

It will be seen by the above that the preference is h 
 favor of New Jersey, except for winter grain, which 
 previous to the present high prices, had been considerec 
 of secondary importance in those sections having conve-- 
 nient access to market, and was sown to occupy the 
 ground during the time intervening between a crop of 
 vegetables and the succeeding crop of grass; frequently 
 three crops, commencing with peas, then melons or cu- 
 cumbers, followed with turnips, worth several crops of 
 wheat, are taken from the same ground in one summer 
 before seeding it with wheat, which is the last work be- 
 fore the frost closes operations in the fall. Wheat sown 
 in proper season, I think, will yield as much per acre in 
 New Jersey as in Pennsylvania, for the premium crops 
 in Burlington county, N. J., have for several years past 
 averaged more than thirty bushels per acre, and as high 
 as forty have been raised. 

The taxes in Pennsylvania press heavily on the agri- 
 cultural interest, while in New Jersey they are compara- 
 tively light. 

The value of land for agricultural purposes does not 
 entirely depend on the amount of produce that can be 
 grown per acre, but in a great degree upon the facilities 
 for transporting the crops to market ; for the cost of 
 transportation must first be paid, as well as of tillage 
 and manure, before the farmer gets any profit ; and 
 those States in which enterprising men enjoy the right 
 to build highways on which to carry their produce 
 wherever the public good requires, will, other things be- 
 ing equal, surpass those where this right is denied.
