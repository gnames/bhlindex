In this respect Pennsylvania 1ms the advantage as an 
 agricultural State, for, under the operation of a General 
 Railroad Law, men of capital may build railroads where 
 they will best promote the general good, by making 
 compensation for all damages sustained by reason of 
 their construction. 

This inestimable privilege, so reasonable in itself, is 
 not enjoyed in New Jersey ; and the railroads that have 
 heretofore been built were located without reference to 
 the agricultural interest, and hence the southern half of 
 the State, embracing over two millions of acres, admira- 
 bly adapted by nature to agricultural purposes, and far 
 surpassing the northern half, which more resembles 
 Pennsylvania land, remains unsupplied, having but one 
 railroad south of the Camden and Amboy Company's 
 roads. 

The people of South and West Jersey have supplicated 
 a number of years for permission to build a railroad 
 through their own fertile land, to carry their crops to 
 market, and offered to make compensation for all dam- 
 ages that would be sustained thereby; but all in vain. 

In consequence thereof but a small part of New Jersey 
 is yet available for agricultural purposes. 

Of over five millions of acres of land there are less 
 than two millions improved. 

Hundreds and thousands of acres of fertile land easily 
 tilled, which by means of a railroad would be within one 
 hour's ride of Philadelphia or New York, now remain 
 uncultivated, and can be purchased for a less sum than 
 the same land will rent for annually when supplied with 
 railroads. 

This land is mostly of a sandy loam on the surface, easily 
 worked at all seasons of the year, either wet or dry, when 
 clear of frost. Its free and mellow nature allows the 
 surplus rains to pass readily from the surface without 
 injuring the crops, and yet it is so retentive of moisture 
 as seldom to suffer of drouth, which renders it more cer- 
 tain for an average crop during a series of years than 
 loamy land of a stronger quality, and being underlaid 
 with a subsoil of clay and gravel which retains manure 
 and moisture for the support of agricultural crops, plants 
 and fruit trees, accounts for the celebrity to which New 
 Jersey has attained for the production of choice fruits. 
 I have seen the premium pears of Burlington co., N. J., 
 bring at public sale four dollars per dozen, and was cred- 
 ibly informed that the same pears were sold at an ice 
 cream saloon on Chesnut St., Philadelphia, at one dollar 
 each. 

Extensive deposits of marl varying from five to twenty 
 feet in depth are distributed throughout New Jersey, 
 more than enough to enrich the whole State and furnish 
 a liberal supply to Pennsylvania, when we get railroads 
 on which to carry it. 

This valuable manure in its natural state, is well 
 adapted to all kinds of crops, and especially so for pro- 
 moting the growth of potatoes, white clover and other 
 grasses, and far surpasses the Apothecary's Patent Fer- 
 tilizer. 

Our most successful potato growers use marl liberally, 
 and some of them plant from fifty to one hundred and 
 twenty acres each of a season, and raise a better crop of 
 large sized, smooth and handsome Irish potatoes, free 
 from prongs or knots than could be, by the use of any 

other manure or fertilizer known to the public without 
 marl. 

In the vicinity of the marl districts, the custom has 
 become general to follow the whole crop of corn with po- 
 tatoes, to the almost entire exclusion of oats and barley; 
 and hundreds and thousands of horses and mules are 
 annually employed hauling marl into those sections 
 where the people are not allowed to build railroads to 
 carry it. 

The sweet potatoes raised in New Jersey exceed by ten 
 times in quantity, and are of much better quality than 
 those grown in Pennsylvania, and their culture is rapidly 
 increasing ; many farmers plant of a season from fifty to 
 two hundred thousand hills each; they do not require 
 strong, rich land but yield a better crop in loose sandy 
 soil, and in ordinary seasons yield about one hundred 
 dollars worth per acre. A neighbor of mine a few days 
 since informed me that owning to the high price obtained, 
 his crop of sweet potatoes last year yielded him three 
 hundred dollars per acre. 

I consider the character and location of New Jersey 
 soil more favorable for agricultural purposes than that 
 of Pennsylvania, and when supplied with railroads will 
 be the garden for raising early vegetables and fruits for 
 the large commercial cities and manufacturing districts 
 by which it is surrounded. 

Then will the real worth of land in New Jersey for ag- 
 ricultural purposes become so manifest, as to give it a 
 gi-eater preference over that of Pennsylvania than what 
 was exhibited in the last census report, by which it ap- 
 pears that the value of farm land in New Jersey is sixty 
 per cent., or three fifths higher than in Pennsylvania; 
 this difference now exists notwithstanding New Jersey is 
 under an influence that prevents the construction of rail- 
 roads through the best agricultural districts, and mainly 
 on account of the natural advantages, for the people still 
 use the same modes of conveyance that were employed 
 by the ancients before the superiority of locomotives was 
 known. 

The land compared with that of Pennsylvania, is easier 
 tilled, equally productive, less liable to suffer from sud- 
 den changes of wet and dry, imbibes more freely the sun 
 and dew to favor the growth of early fruits and vegeta- 
 bles, and ripen them sooner for market, which gives a 
 larger return to the husbandman. 

Nature has been bountiful indeed, but in order to enjoy 
 the full benefit of her advantages, New Jersey must keep 
 pace with other states and allow her citizens to build 
 railroads through the agricultural districts to develop 
 their resources. The general railroad laws adopted in 
 Pennsylvania and elsewhere are favorable for promoting 
 agricultural interest, while the railroad monopoly in New 
 Jersey is against it. 

With sentiments of regard and a desire that this inter- 
 esting and important subject may claim a deeper hold on 
 the public mind than heretofoi'e, that whatever obstruct- 
 ions are found to prevent the advancement of agriculture 
 may be removed thereby benefiting the whole community, 
 as all other trades and professions are greatly dependent 
 for their success on its developement.. 

The foregoing interesting communication was elicited, 
 as we understand, by a discussion between the person to 
 whom it is addressed, E. C. Brewster, and another gen-
