THE FARM JOURNAL. 

[July 

Thus pass the seasons away, calm follows the hurri- 
 cane and sunshine succeeds the blackened sky. This is 
 the order of nature, and ordered by nature's God, and 
 therefore must be right. Nor is this state of things con- 
 fined to the works of the Divine Architect as applied to 
 the material world — and Ae must be an inattentive obser- 
 ver of the times, who does not see the same vicissitudes 
 in the affairs of man — for awhile the smiles of fortune 
 seem to attend his every movement — does he invest his 
 money in houses and lands; they rapidly increase in 
 value — does he engage in mercantile pursuits ; his busi- 
 ness is equally prosperous; and even should he purchase 
 stocks, they shortly double his investment, when, Nebu- 
 chadnezzar like he exclaims, "see what my skill and wis- 
 dom has produced." But the top of the ladder is reached, 
 'many of his stocks become worthless, and the balance 
 yields him little interest ; his goods are sold to the dis- 
 tant merchant who unable to collect his debts cannot 
 possibly meet his engagements ; and even his real estate 
 after paying the increased taxes with diminished rates 
 affords him but a trifling income. 

But this is all right, and man in his free agency is per- 
 mitted to work out his own cure ; he now sees that every 
 good and perfect gift comes from above ; that his ingrat- 
 itude is justly punished ; and even those who have inno- 
 cently become the dupes of the speculator, readily ac- 
 knowledge that all is right. For while they would be 
 unwilling that any of the human family should suffer 
 from want of the necessaries of life, they are quite free 
 that many of the luxuries should be withdrawn ; while 
 they wish none to exert themselves beyond their ability, 
 they believe it right for all to be actively employed ; and 
 they feel fully assured that by exercising what the Ger- 
 mans call the Vier Haupt Tugender (the four cardinal 
 virtues) Temperance, Justice, Prudence and Fortitude, 
 with a perfect reliance on the goodness of an overruling 
 Providence, that all things needful will be added. 

"While I have given a rapid sketch of the thickly popu- 
 lated part of the community, there is a class, the very 
 bone and sinew of every country, who, moving in an 
 humble sphere have passed unscathed by the whirlwinds 
 which have prostrated so many in the higher walks of 
 life. This class is, "The Cultivator of the Soil," and to 
 these I would now address a few remarks. While the 
 world is dependent upon us for the very food which sus- 
 tains them, let us not boast of our independence, for they 
 also furnish us with many of the comforts of life ; there- 
 fore a reciprocity of favors contributes to the happiness 
 of the whole. 

Rut let us not rest satisfied with our profession as we 
 find it, but each one endeavor to add something to its 
 improvement; and to do this we must read, think and 
 work. I hear some of you say "what time have we to 
 read?" Our daily avocations continue till night, and then 
 we want rest and sleep. But stop my friend, for he who 
 labors from five till eleven and from one till seven in 
 summer, can very well spare himself two hours at noon 
 for reading and rest (unless some emergency press him,) 
 and the winter affords him much precious time. 

But books are expensive! True, it would require a 
 considerable sum to buy all that might be wanted, but to 
 avoid this let us establish libraries in every neighborhood, 
 of well selected works, a part of which should be on Ge- 

ology, Mineralogy, Entomology, Chemistry, Agriculture, 
 Horticulture, together with the best periodicals of the 
 day, both foreign and domestic, which would give us all 
 the improvements that are annually made not only in 
 our own country, but throughout the world. And as to 
 the strange prejudice that exists in some sections of the 
 country against book-farming, as it is called, I would 
 have you discard it at once; as well might the hardy 
 mariner have rejected the introduction of the compass in 
 navigation, declaring himself satisfied to do as his fore- 
 fathers had done ; or the ancient scribes have rejected the 
 use of the tyj>e in expediting the circulation of knowl- 
 edge over the world. 

That we are not bound to believe all that we see in 
 print is very true ; and here comes in the exercise of the 
 second requisite in the improvement of our profession; 
 we must think for ourselves, but before we can think 
 correctly we must have the facts collected, "for how can 
 we reason but from what we know." 

Therefore if we lay down something like the following 
 rule, which I think guided the great Newton in his re- 
 searches after truth, we shall seldom be deceived in our 
 conclusions, viz., "no more causes of natural things 
 ought to be admitted than are true and sufficient to ex- 
 plain the phenomena — therefore effects of the same kind 
 will always be produced by the same causes." M. B. S.

Native Oaks. 

For the Farm Journal. 
 Mr. J. L. Darlington: — I observe in the April No. 
 of the Farm Journal, an article on our native oaks ; and 
 as you request some of your readers to send you the 
 measurement of any unusually large oak ti'ees in their 
 neighborhood, I have now growing on a wood lot on my 
 farm in Springfield township, an oak, a swamp oak, that 
 measui'es twenty feet in circumference around the trunk 
 at the height of two and a half feet above ground, and is 
 upwards of eighty-five feet in height. It is a beautiful 
 straight bodied tree with but a small top ; several of the 
 largest limbs have been broken off a number of years 
 ago, and it is sending out a fine new growth of limbs, 
 commencing some forty-five feet above ground. It is 
 growing on a kind of bottom soil ; the timber in the 
 neighborhood immediately around, is not so unusually 
 large, but is composedof almost every variety, white oak, 
 red oak, elm, hickory, poplar, white ash, chesnut, maple, 
 cucumber, sassafras, dogwood, wild plum, spice-wood, 
 grape-vine, and linn-wood. Yours, with respect,

Agricultural Periodicals for Premiums. 
 We observe, that the Ohio State Board of agriculture, 
 have resolved to distribute four hundred copies of the 
 two Agricultural papers, published in that State, to com- 
 petitors at the next' State Fair. - This is a wise liberality, 
 and shows a proper appreciation of the great benefits to 
 agriculture, by the circulation of such periodicals. We 
 can hardly hope for such action on the part of our State 
 Society or its Executive Committee, and yet we believe 
 there is no plan, by which they could accomplish so 
 much good throughout the State, with so small an out- 
 ay. The Farm Journal is now in its fifth volume, and
