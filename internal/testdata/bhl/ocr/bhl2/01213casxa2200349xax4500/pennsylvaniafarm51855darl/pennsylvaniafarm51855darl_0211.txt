THE FARM JOURNAL.

we believe has aided very materially to awaken a spirit 
 of improvement among the farmers in Pennsylvania, 
 where it has its chief circulation, and has been no inef- 
 ficient adjunct to the efforts of the State Society. It has 
 however received no assistance from the latter, and has 
 had to rely on its own efforts and resources. We have 
 never pushed our own claims, but still believe if the State 
 Society were to subscribe for, and circulate one thousand 
 copies annually, it would be the means of disseminating 
 inuch good, and redound to its own advantage. There 
 is no State in the Union in which agricultural papers, 
 are so poorly supported as in Pennsylvania. 

Ground Food for Stock. 

Few persons seem to be aware of the importance of 
 grinding every variety of grain before feeding it to ani- 
 mals. In fattening any kind of animals, it is all impor- 
 tant. There is no animal's stomach that can digest any 
 variety of grain with a cortical covering. All animals 
 that swallow a single kernel without crushing, void it 
 whole ; and what is singular, after passing the ordeal of 
 the gastric juice, the heat and digestive organs of the 
 stomach and the whole intestinal canal, the seed will still 
 germinate and grow. Horned cattle are not careful 
 chewers of their food, as they depend upon rumination 
 to comminute their food properly, in which grain, meal 
 and roots, are never brought up to undergo that process. 
 The hog is a notorious gormandizer, and scarcely chews 
 at all;and it is said that of three hogs confined in a nar- 
 row stall, and only the first one fed what corn he can eat, 
 the middle one will fatten fastest, and the last one keep 
 in good order. The horse masticates better, but age 
 and hard fare often disable him from performing such 
 duty as is required to render his food fit to produce the 
 nutriment it contains. 

The stomach is a macerating vessel where all the 
 food is intended to be dissolved, and its nutritious parts 
 to be taken up and earned to the blood, to be distribu- 
 ted and deposited on all the tissues. The period that 
 all particles take in dissolving, is exactly in proportion 
 to their bulk. A cube of salt or of loaf sugar, if divi- 
 ded in two, will dissolve in water in half the time it 
 would whole ; as will metals in acids, or ice in the sun 

In every point of view, therefore, either for profitable 
 expenditure or speedy fattening of animals the grinding 
 and comminuting the food has nearly one half the advan- 
 tage over the ordinary process ; and, if cooked, saves the 
 stomach and its complicated organs and nerves, the ex- 
 ertion of cooking it there — as cooked, it has to be, before 
 digestion. It is the opinion of close observers that fully 
 one half the expense of sustaining and fattening is saved. 

In feeding horses and cattle, for simply carrying them 
 through the winter, if what grain they are entitled to 
 was ground and the hay or straw cut, mixed and propei*- 
 ly moistened, the saving would amount to quite an item 
 — every inch of hay or straw will be eaten and nothing 
 lost. Two-thirds the quantity now fed in racks for the 
 ho.rses to pull under their feet, and that fed to cattle on 
 the ground, and trodden down and spoiled, would suffice 
 to carry stock through the winter. But habit is every- 
 thing; it is stronger than the ties of family affection, the 
 good- will and confidence of the world, or the hope of sal- 
 vation, as is evinced by the inebriate— and it holds good 

in all the duties and actions of life. If we had been ha- 
 bituated from our youth to cut, cook and prepare food 
 for our valuable animals, the most beneficent gifts of the 
 Creator, should we not look with astonishment at the 
 practice of waste and mismanagement now in general 
 use ! 

In England, where necessity teaches people wisdom — 
 where ten to twenty dollars rent is paid for an acre of 
 land — they manage things differently. In that country, 
 where the best work horses in the world are kept and the 
 fattest animals are sent to market, every particle of food 
 is cut and ground; and horse's food often baked into loaves. 
 Their experience has settled the most economical process 
 and necessity enforces it. Our whole system of feeding 
 is wrong. The undei*-cover stall feeding is the only true 
 one, both as respects the saving of provender, the com- 
 fort of the animals, and the value of the manure. — Ru-

An Experiment in Soiling Cattle. 

I very much regret that, in reply to your inquiries, 
 relative to my experiments in soiling stock, I am not 
 able to give you a more detailed and satisfactory state- 
 ment, yet the little experience which I thus far have, 
 has been so satisfactory to myself, that it is most cheer- 
 fully communicated, in the hope that others may be in- 
 duced to give it a trial, for I am aware that any particu- 
 lar process in farming, to be generally valuable, must 
 stand the test of repeated trials, made under the vari- 
 ous circumstances which modify the results in different 
 regions. 

During the summer of 1854, my stock on my home 
 farm, consisted of a span of horses, one yoke of oxen, 
 a three year old short horn bull, fifteen cows and twelve 
 calves. 

As I wished to break up the greater part of my old 
 pasture, and could not well appropriate other lands to 
 that purpose I resolved to make up the deficiency by 
 feeding in the stable all except what they could graze 
 upon a six acre lot of old pasture. 

For this purpose I sowed four acres of corn in drills, 
 three bushels to the acre ; part of it as early as the 
 seed would come, and all before the first of June. The 
 land was in good condition", having been plowed deep 
 and well manured; and if cured, the yield would pro- 
 bably have been from four to six tons to the acre. In 
 addition to this, before the corn was fit to cut, a little 
 less than two acres of clover was fed green to the stock, 
 making in all say twelve acres of land, upon which the 
 above stock was well summered, and in fact were in 
 much better order in the fall than most herds in this 
 region in consequence of the short feed occasioned by 
 the severe drouth. 

The teams and bull were constantly stabled, and re- 
 ceived dry hay till the first week in June, when they 
 were put upon green cut clover ; but to prevent their 
 scouring, as well as the cows, when first put upon it, a 
 small portion of dry hay was mixed with the green clo- 
 ver for a few days, when it was gradually abandoned. 

During the flush of feed in May and June, the cow? 
 grazed a large portion of their food from the six acres 
 of pasture, the deficiency being made up in dry hay till 
 the clover came.
