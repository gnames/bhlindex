from some experience. AVe would discard entirely, all 
 the crested "Dog's tail avena's and Fescue grasses," of 
 England, as entirely unnecessary and useless here. The 
 very best quality of compact sod can be obtained by 
 sowing equal parts by weight of Poa Pratensis, (Green 
 or Blue Grass,) Trlfolium Rcpens, (White Clover,) Lo- 
 lium Perenne, (Rye Grass.) We prefer this to any 
 mixture of other grasses. After being once well set, it 
 should be remembered that a lawn can only be kept beau- 
 tiful, by repeated mowing, and occasional top dressing, 
 and cleaning with an English lawn rake, which are made 
 expressly for this purpese. In England they are also 
 regularly swept with a broom at stated periods. 

For good mowing, an English rivetted back lawn scythe 
 is also indispensable. 

Osage Orange Trees. 

Mr. H. P. Byram, the editor of the Louisville Journal, 
 writes to that paper from Dayton, Ohio, under date of 
 September 9th, 1854 : 

In the vicinity of this city I saw some of the most per- 
 fect specimens of the Osage Orange that I have ever be- 
 fore met with — more perfect, indeed, than I supposed 
 nature could produce, even with all the aid that art and 
 industry could lend her. The plants seem to withstand 
 the blighting effects of this unusually dry season, better 
 than any other species of vegetation. The leaves still 
 present the most rich glossy green that characterizes this 
 plant in our most favorable seasons. 

From a somewhat extensive acquaintance with the 
 eharacter of the Osage Orange plant, I have often pro- 
 nounced it the hedge plant of America, but I had no idea 
 of the degree of perfection to which I find it susceptible 
 of being trained in the hedge. The oldest of the hedges 
 here now is about four years. It is four feet high, and 
 three feet broad at the base, and as dense, compact and 
 uniform from the ground to the top, as if it had been 
 moulded by hand from some plastic material. My atten- 
 dant remarked that is was "so close at the bottom that 
 a snake could not find its way through it." There were 
 several other specimens in the same vicinity, from one to 
 two years old, all presenting the same beautiful appear- 
 ance. 

The great and only secret in producing this living 
 American prairie fence is, clean culture for four years, 
 and a relentless, unsparing sliearing, from the period of 
 setting the plants to the end of four years, and then to 
 maintain it in its proper form by semi-annual clippings. 

A Mode of Repelling the Apple Tree Borer. 
 I have suffered from the effects of the "Apple Borer," 
 having lost some seventy beautiful trees during the space 
 of three years. I made use of all the preventives sug- 
 gested by others that I could get hold of, but all to no 
 purpose. I came to the conclusion four years since, that 
 the tree must be protected by a covering in order to pre- 
 vent the little animal from making a deposit. My pro- 
 cess was this, and so far successful to the extent of the 
 covering. Early in May, which is the proper time for 
 this region, I examined every tree, and if nits or grubs 
 were there, I followed them with a knife and removed 
 them. I lifted the earth from the collar or base of the 
 tree to the depth of two or three inches, and made use 

of worn wool bags, of little value, for wrappers which, 
 when cut into strips, are very convenient. I commenced 
 two inches below the surface and wound the extent of 
 two feet, giving the tree two thicknesses of sacking and 
 securing the same with slender twine. I then replaced 
 the earth, and the work was done for the season. 

It is necessary to loosen the sacking or covering early 
 in May every succeeding year, and wrap the tree again 
 as above stated. When the animal is prevented from 
 piercing between "wind and water," its favorite haunt, 
 it examines for some vulnerable point, but his depreda- 
 tion above the protection, with me, has been exceedingly 
 rare, and when committed, easily detected. Should it 
 be necessary, it is an easy matter to wrap the tree to 
 and around the forks, as there is nothing effectual short 
 of a complete protection. 

Since pursuing the above course, I have not lost one 
 tree that was not too far gone to recover, and no neto de- 
 posits under the covering has come to my notice. Wm.

Horticultural Novelty. 

The agricultural branch of the Patent Office has taken 
 steps to procure seeds of the bunya-bunya, a tree of the 
 fir genus, which grows in Australia, and bears a cone 
 nearly two feet in diameter, filled with seed of the size of 
 an olive, and of flavor more rich and delicate than that 
 of the pine apple. 

There have recently been imported from France the 
 cuttings of several varieties of the prune, which have 
 been distributed by the Department in Maine, New Hamp- 
 shire, Vermont, Northern New York, Michigan, Wiscon- 
 sin, Minnesota, and several points on the Allegheny 
 mountains, to be engrafted on the common plum tree. 

Keeping Furs in Summer. 

About the 1st of April, or on the approach of warm 
 weather, lightly whip, comb and brush your furs till they 
 are perfectly free from dust, sprinkle them with a little 
 spirits of any kind and wrap them in clean linen. Put 
 them in a tight box or drawer, and keep the air from 
 them as much as possible. In this situation they may 
 remain ten or fifteen days, when they ought to be exam- 
 ined and the whipping, combing and brushing repeated. 

The insects most destructive to furs, are, first, the 
 black bug which infests smoked meats, &c. It appears 
 and deposits eggs early in the spring. This kind of 
 moth docs not eat the fur, but preys altogether on the 
 skin. Next, the small ash colored miller, which produ- 
 ces the moth that destroys all kinds of woolen stuffs, 
 and may be seen hovering about the candle on a sum- 
 mer evening. This kind particularly preys upon and de- 
 stroys the furs, and ought to be most guarded against, 
 also the mite, which are very numerous. They appear 
 like dust, and are scarcely perceptible to the naked eye. 
 They subsist upon and destroy the fibrous membrane 
 which attaches the fur to the skin. Hence the practice 
 of sunning and airing furs is highly prejudicial, for as in- 
 sects fly about in the air, it not only affords them an op- 
 portunity of getting in and breeding, but the warmth of 
 the sun nourishes and supports them, and at the same 
 time spoils the color and destroys the life and beauty of 
 the fur.
