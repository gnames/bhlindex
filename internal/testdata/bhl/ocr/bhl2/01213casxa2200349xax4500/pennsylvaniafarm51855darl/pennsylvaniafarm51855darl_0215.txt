Coarse furs — such as bear and buffalo skins — may be 
 preserved by beating them well in the spring, and head- 
 ing them up in an air tight spirit cask, which had been 
 recently emptied. Especial care must always be taken 
 to have furs, woolens, &c, clean and free from insects 
 when put up for the season — and no means are adequate 
 to the preservation of furs that are badly dressed and 
 not cleansed of the natural grease. — A Troy Furrier. 

Turnip Seed from the Patent Office. 
 We have received for distribution, by the politeness of 
 Dr. Elwyn, several packages of turnip seed forwarded to 
 him from the Patent Office ; and also a large package of 
 the same kind of seeds from the Commissioner of Pa- 
 tents, which we will take great pleasure in distributing 
 to our friends who may apply while the stock holds out. 
 "VVe copy in this connection the circular of Mr. Mason, 
 Commissioner of Patents, and a list of the varieties : 

MODE OF CONDUCTING THE EXPERIMENTS. 

1. The varieties known as Swedes or Ruta-Bagas may 
 be sown or planted in drills or ridges twenty-five inches 
 apart, and a foot asunder along the drills, in Maine, New 
 Hampshire, Vermont, Massachussts, Rhode Island, Con- 
 necticut, New York, Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, Min- 
 nesota, Kansas, Nebraska, Washington Territory, and 
 Oregon, from the middle of June to the 20th of July ; 
 in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Vir- 
 ginia, Ohio, Kentucky, Indiania, Illinois, and Missouri, 
 from the 20th of July to the 1st of August; in North 
 Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, 
 Tennessee, Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiania, Texas, New 
 Mexico, Utah, and California, from the 1st of August 
 to the 20th of September ; and even later in the more 
 southern States. The ground should be rich, dry, and 
 well prepared, and the plants hoed at least twice in the 
 course of the season. 

2. The other varieties of seed may be sown broadcast, 
 in Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, 
 Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Michigan, Wis- 
 consin, Iowa, Minnesota, Kansas, Nebraska, Washington 
 Territory, and Oregon, from the 15th of July to the 1st 
 of August ; in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, 
 Maryland, Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky, Indiania, Illinois, 
 and Missouri, from the 1st to the 20th of August; in 
 North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Ala- 
 bama Tennessee, Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiania, Tex- 
 as, New Mexico, Utah, and California, from the 1st of 
 Octobor to the last of November, and in the more south- 
 ern States, any time during the winter. The land most 
 suitable should be a light sandy or gravelly loam, freshly 
 manured, if necessary, with well rotted farmyard dung, 
 or "folded" or "yarded" by cattle or sheep, or by the 
 addition of guano, bonedust, or by superphosphate of 
 lime. Land newly cleared or burnt over, or old pasture 
 ground ploughed two or three times in the course of the 
 summer, and the latter fertilized by wood ashes, will of- 
 ten produce an excellent yield. The sowing should al- 
 ways be done if possible just before a rain; for the escape 
 from the fly and the success of the crop depends in a 
 great measure upon the quick germination and a rapid 
 growth at first. 

The crops in no instance should be harvested until after 
 the general fall of the leaf, or the occurence of a heavy 

frost. A careful estimate of the quantity of roots and 
 tops raised on a given space of ground may then be made 
 by measurement or weight, which, together with other 
 circumstances connected with their growth, may be en- 
 tered in a tabular form, and returned to this Office 
 by mail. CHARLES MASON

Exhibition of the United States Agricultural Society. 

In our last number, we inadvertently conufcitted an 
 error in stating that the Exhibition of the above Society 
 was to be held this season at Camden, and in connection 
 with the New Jersey State Exhibition. 

The mistake occurred by some one calling in our ab- 
 sence, and leaving a note on our desk, to that effect, for 
 publication. 

We understand it is yet doubtful if the United States 
 Society hold an exhibition any where this season. 

To Destroy Red Ants. 
 A correspondent of the Southern Cultivator contrib- 
 utes the following method for destroying the above named 
 insects : — Procure a-^arge sponge, wash it well ; press it 
 very dry ; by so doing it will leave the small cells open — 
 lay it on the shelf where they are most troublesome, 
 sprinkle some fine white sugar on the sponge (lightly 
 over it) ; two or three times a day, take a bucket of hot 
 water to where the sponge is, carefully drop the sponge 
 in the scalding water, and you will slay them by the 
 thousands, and soon rid the house of these troublesome 
 insects. When you squeeze the sponge, you will be as- 
 tonished at the number that had gone in the cells." 

Acid Phosphate of Lime. 
 It is some years since this salt was proposed as a ma- 
 nure, and repeated trials since that time have fully dem- 
 onstrated its efficiency. The simplest method of prepar- 
 ing it is as follows : Bones are thrown into heaps, 
 where they soften by fermentation. They are then cov- 
 ered with half their weight of water in wood or stone 
 vats, and half their weight of oil of vitriol added. The 
 whole passes into a pasty state in the course of eight or 
 ten days, when it is mixed with earth, charcoal, or saw- 
 dust, to render it pulverulent. If it be- required to apply 
 the salt in a fluid state to land, the paste is diluted with 
 100-200 times its bulk of water.
