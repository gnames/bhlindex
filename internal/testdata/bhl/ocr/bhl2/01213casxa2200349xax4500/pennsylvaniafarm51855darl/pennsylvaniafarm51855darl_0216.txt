Deep Tillage. 

Deep plowing turns the drought itself to good account, 
 and renders mulching and irrigation comparatively useless, 
 or, if used, more efficacious. During a dry spell and in 
 trenched ground, roots strike deeper in search of food and 
 moisture, become more extensively ramified, and sooner 
 find the rich loam and manure intermingled deeply with the 
 soil. The leaching process, as it is called, is reversed, and 
 takes place upwards more than at any other time, or, in 
 more scientific phrase, capillary attraction is increased. As 
 each particle of moisture is evaporated from the surface, it 
 is succeeded by another, and the whole soil is filled with the 
 ascended moisture and gases, which are appropiated by the 
 numerous rootlets as thoy have need. 

The wet season is also a blessing to the deep cultivator. 
 The more rain, the more heat, ammonia, carbonic acid, and 
 other organic elements are left in the soil as it descends. 
 As each drop filters through, it is succeeded by another, or 
 by air, both essential to vegetation; and to dissolve, act on, 
 or combine with, the inorganic elements of the soil. As the 
 water drains off, air is sure to follow, and this is the proper 
 mode of its circulation. Each is also generally at a higher 
 temperature than the undrained land, and the warmth of the 
 under soil is therefore relatively increased. The farmer 
 often objects to this waste of water, and would retain it for 
 a dry time ! The trenched and porous soil holds water like 
 a sponge, notwithstanding the drainage. It retains or can 
 command enough for the wants of vegetation. But lot us 
 see the operation on the undrained land. 

The farmer often speaks of his "cold wet land." No va- 
 riety of soil, in any location, is, of itself, colder than another. 
 The very water which tronching, draining, &c, allow to pass 
 off after imparting its virtues to the soil, if retained on or 
 near the surface by hard impervious sub -soil, becomes itself 
 by its changes, the source of the coldness complained of. 
 Instead of running off, it evaporates, and by this process 
 abstracts a great quantity of heat from the soil and surround- 
 ing atmosphere. The evaporation of a pound' of water re- 
 quires about 1000 degrees of heat; some authors stating it 
 less and others more. Or it reduces 100 pounds of air 45°. 
 This is reversing the experiment of Prof. Johnson, in Espy's 
 "Book of Storms." where he says, "a pound of vapor" con- 
 densed to water "would heat 100 pounds of air about 45°. 
 The ground to a considerable depth is warmer, by many de- 
 grees, where the rain is drained off, instead of being allowed 
 to accumulate and evaporate. Hence this enormous loss of 
 an invaluable stimulus to vegetation. 

This chilling and deadly process of evaporation is going 
 on to excess from the time frost comes out of the ground in 
 the spring, till freezing again occurs. At this period, the 
 undrained land, having the most water to freeze, becomes 
 the warmest, say in December, when of no value to vegeta- 
 tion, but rather an injury. For once, forsooth, the undrained 
 land is warmer than the drained ! But for this excess of 
 heat in winter, this kind of land must pay dearly in early 
 spring. How is all this? inquires the farmer. Simply be- 
 cause water, in congealing to either ice or snow, has its ca- 
 pacity for heat lessened about one-ninth, and this excess is 
 given off to surrounding bodies ; or, in other words, its latent 
 heat is sot free. On the other hand, ice, or frost as it is called 
 in the ground, in melting, demands back this same heat, at 
 the rate of from one-eighth to one-ninth of 1000° for every 
 pound melted ; and under the surface it does not obtain all 
 this directly from the sun, but through the soil; therefore the 
 more water the colder and longer cold will be the land in 
 spring. Now let the agriculturist go to work and make this 
 "cold, wet, heavy land" of his, the very best ho has for any 
 product, trees, vegetables, grains, or grasses. — Br. Kelly. 

Trapping Grubs and Cut Worms. 

A writor over the signature of C. Q. in the May No. of 
 the Mich. Farmer, relates his success in preventing the dep- 
 redations of these posts of the farmer by a new and very in- 
 genious invention of his own. As neither fall-plowing nor 
 any other generally known method is much to be relied 
 upon, probably many may bo induced to try this newly pro- 
 posed method. If found as successful as C. Q. represents 
 it, we shall be happy to make a report thereof, and to bo the 
 organ through which those who may find it useful shall send 
 a vote of thanks to the original inventor. 

Last spring, says C. Q., "I tried an experiment with the 
 "varmints," which I will relate for the benefit of whom it 
 may concern." He planted his corn on a clover-sod plowed 
 in spring. While planting he found plenty of the small 
 grubs. The corn was planted about the 20th of May, and as 
 soon as it came up they commenced their mischief. Know- 
 ing no reliable or certain way of saving tho corn, he conclu- 
 ded to traj) them. For this purpose he took a round stick, 
 3 or 4 feet long and about 2 inches in diameter, and making 
 one end sharp, and taking two rows at a time, he made from 
 two to four holes, 4 or 5 inches deep in or close by every 
 hill.- After fixing several rows in this way ho waited to see 
 tho result. On examination ho found that almost every hole 
 had one or more worms in it. In one hole he counted as 
 many as six. He then went over the whole field in the same 
 way, and the result was that hardly a hill of corn was de- 
 stroyed after the holes were made, while his neighbor's corn 
 just over the fence, which was on ground plowed very early, 
 was more than half cut off by the worms. "It might be 
 supposed," says C. Q., "that when the fellows fell into the 
 traps they would bore into the side and escape; but on 
 watching them I found they would try to climb up the side, 
 but the sides being smooth they always fell back again, 
 when about 24 hours of sunshine and starvation would put 
 an end to them. They usually commit their depredation in 
 the night, and while crawling around to find the corn they 
 tumble in." An additional recommendation of this method 
 is, that the birds will not pull up tho corn, when they find 
 plenty of grub already providod for them. 

C. Q. states farther, that a portion of this field of corn 
 looked green, and flourished luxuriantly, while another por- 
 tion looked pale and yellow. To the former he had applied 
 (a table-spoonful to each hill) a mixture of 2 parts lime with 
 3 parts of ashes. The latter had no such application. —

Millet Culture. 
 In 1851 I had a dairy of forty-five cows, and having been 
 obliged the year before to buy most of my fodder for a dairy 
 of about the same number, I cast about to see if I could not 
 find something that I could raise in tho place of hay that I 
 could keep my cows on, and koep them in a good condition, 
 and at tho samo time get a good supply of milk from them 
 for market (as milk dairying was my business). I sowed 
 corn and found it an excellent substitute; but to keep so 
 many cows on it required too much labor, and after mid- 
 winter it became too dry and harsh, and did not give much 
 milk. In '51, I sowed four acres of millet (four quarts per 
 acre) the 16th of Juno, and had as much fodder as from any 
 eight acres of grass that year — and it was a good year for 
 hay. I have raised from four to eight acres evory year 
 since, and have invariably had good crops of not only fodder 
 or hay, or straw equal to as many tuns of the best timothy 
 hay, but from twenty to thirty bushels of seed to the acre, 
 equal to as many bushels of corn to feed to any kind of do- 
 mestic animals. I feed most of my seed, after having it 
 ground, to milch cows, preferring it to Indian meal, as mak-
