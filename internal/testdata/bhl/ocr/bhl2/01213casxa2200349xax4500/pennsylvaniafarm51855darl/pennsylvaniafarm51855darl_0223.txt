satisfaction to the proprietors or public. 

There are slurs, insinuations and mistatements enough in 
 this mischievous little paragraph to condemn half-a-dozen 
 good machines if left uncontradicted. "The bar appears to 
 run low, but does not cut as close as some of the other ma- 
 chines, and does not work as easily." The Committee 
 thought it "cut low and smooth" enough to give it theirs* 
 award with four others, out of the nine machines entered for 
 trial; and as to "working easily "they gave it the highest 
 award, with two others only out of the nine, 

Again, "with three of the principal men of the establish- 
 ment," &c. Of the principal men alluded to, two never saw 
 any mowing machine at work except Allen's, and then only 
 for an hour or two in unripe grass ; and the other had in ad- 
 dition, carelessly looked at Ketchum's last season, while at 
 work, for ten minutes only. This was the sum total of their 
 aggregate experienence in managing mowing machines pre- 
 vious to going to this trial. That they should not have made 
 the machine go perfectly through the first swath, (on which 
 we presume this self styled report was based,) is not surpris- 

ing, when all were ignorant of its practical working; and even 
 this would have been avoided had the driver stopped to ar- 
 range the draught properly as he was instructed, instead of 
 dragging over the ground with the machine improperly ad- 
 justed. That "it did give satisfaction to the (sole) proprietor" 
 he first learned through the Tribune the following morning, 
 as he was not within 45 miles of the trial ground. How "dis- 
 satisfied the public "were with this trial may be gathered from 
 the report of the committee, and from the further fact that 
 several persons gave orders for this machine before the con- 
 clusion ot the trial, for which they said no guarantee was 
 necessary, a result I believe confined wholly to this ma 
 chine. 

Of the six principal points made by the committee, the Allen 
 machine received, in connection with one or more of the oth- 
 ers,the highest award in five, and in the remaining one, on 
 which they express an opinion rather than an assertion, I 
 will guarantee, this inferior to none other exhibited on this 
 or a,ny other occasion.— R. L. ALLEN, Nos. 189 and 191

Seed Sower. 

The above engraving gives a good idea of the Seed 
 Sower manufactured by Ruggles, Nourse & Mason, Bos- 
 ton, and for sale at the principal agricultural ware- 
 houses in Philadelphia. It is called their No. 2, and 
 has a cylinder adapted to corn, beans, peas, &c, in ad- 
 dition to the brush used for the smaller seeds, turnips, 
 carrots. &c. No. 1 Seed sower is generally used for 
 these latter, and can be bought for about six dollars and 
 fifty cents. The cylinder and brush work by gearing, 
 and drop any varieties of the smaller seeds with great 
 evenness and regularity. Several thin slides, with diff- 
 erent sized holes accompany each machine. 

It will be observed in the engraving, that the drill or 
 gutter made to receive the seed, the dropping, covering 
 and rolling, are all performed at one operation. It seems 
 needless to enlarge upon the advantages of drilling 
 with a machine like the above, compared with the fa- 
 tigue of stooping and sowing by hand. It not only 
 saves valuable time, but performs the operation from 
 first to last muck better, and often is a material advan- 
 tage not only to the early growth, but final product of 
 the crop. 

Many farmers are deterred from putting in a crop of 
 roots on account of the time required to sow the seed, 
 and the difficulty of doing it properly. To such we 
 would recommend the above drill. 

Ruta Bagas. 

As it is now pretty well understood that the hay crop 
 in eastern Pennsylvania will be a very short one the 
 present season, (in many places probably not half a 
 crop), we would again urge those who have so far ne- 
 glected other crops to supply this deficiency, to plant 
 liberally of Ruta Bagas. The middle of July is ample 
 time to sow them, and for either cattle or sheep, they 
 will be found a valuable aid through the coming winter. 
 When hay is eight or ten dollars per ton and grain also 
 cheap, a farmer may afford to throw it out lavishly, 
 even when a large part is trampled under foot, and goes 
 to make manure. But next winter, unless we are great- 
 ly mistaken, economy in feeding will be the order of the 
 day. From six hundred to one thousand bushels of Ru- 
 ta Bagas may readily be raised on an acre. These are 
 not only valuable for food in themselves, but by their 
 succulent and juicy properties, greatly promote the 
 health and thrift of the stock, and thus indirectly en- 
 hance the value and efficacy of other food. Roots are 
 highly relished in the winter, owing to the absence of 
 all other green food, and there is no kind which can be 
 raised so cheaply as Ruta Bagas. They will readily suc- 
 ceed a crop of early potatoes, and when once planted re- 
 quire no attention till after harvest, when they should 
 be thinned out to proper distances, and the ground kept 
 well stiri-ed with the cultivator, till their leaves expand
