sufficiently to shade the ground. Ridging is sometimes 
 recommended for this and other root crops, hut we think 
 should be avoided most especially. It may do in Eng- 
 land where an excess of moisture is the prevailing diffi- 
 culty, but here we have most to fear from hot summers 
 and drought. The rows should be two and a half or 
 three feet apart, so that a horse can travel between 
 them, and if the ground has been well and deeply plow- 
 ed, manured and kept clean in their early growth, they 
 will soon grow so rapidly as to take care of themselves. 
 One and a half pounds of seed is sufficient for an acre. 
 The turnip drill of Ruggles, Nourse & Mason, of Bos- 
 ton, is a capital one for drilling turnip or other seeds, 
 is decidedly the best in the market. It is simple, well 
 made and effective. Making the drill, dropping the seed, 
 covering and rolling it afterwards, all at one operation. 
 It is propelled by hand power, and can be obtained at 
 the different agricultural warehouses in Philadelphia. 
 Price from six to six dollars and fiftv cents. 

Making French Drains. 

Onr friend Frederick Sheeder, of West Vincent, Ches- 
 ter County, writes us a long letter respecting his experi- 
 ence in making French Drains, with some practical ad- 
 vice on other subjects, which we are unable to find room 
 for in this number. He has French Drains made twen- 
 ty-two years ago, still permanent, where instead of 
 boards in the bottom, as we recommended for soft 
 ground, he dug out a considerable portion of the clay, 
 and then filled it with small stones which he rammed 
 down tight. In other cases where the boards were used, 
 in a few years they rotted out, and the drains had to be 
 made over. 

He thinks a complete, well made drain, will last as 
 long as the world lasts, provided the flag or covering 
 stone does not give way. Instead of covering the top of 
 the drain with tussocks, shavings or tan, which will in 
 time rot and allow the soil to work through, he levels 
 off the top with fine stone broken or pounded up for the 
 purpose, so as to make it hard and impervious. F. 
 Sheeder, was one of those who early commenced using 
 lime and plaster, and encouraged his neighbors to do the 
 same. This was fifty years ago, when he first settled in 
 Chester county, and when the benefit of these fertilizers 
 was not so generally acknowledged as at present. 

He also we find, watches the "signs," in cutting bri- 
 ars, felling timber, setting down worm fence, &c, and 
 says any one may prove the thing by placing two stones 
 of equal weight on the ground, one in the "down sign" 
 and the other in the "up sign,'''' and at the end of six 
 months, one will be found to have sunk much more than 
 the other, and refers to other similar experiments. We 
 never had the least faith, in any of these signs, which 
 however we are aware, are conscientiously believed in by 
 a large number of farmers. We have never been able 
 to discover the philosophy of the theory. 

Guano Frauds. 
 The late numbers of our agricultural exchanges to 
 the North and East, contains statements of discoveries 
 to adulterate Guano, and sell it under false colors. They 
 state that at an establishment near Newark, New Jersey, 
 Mexican Guano has been mixed up with plaster, salt, 

sugar house scum, Peruvian guano, and quick lime, 
 the whole ground up together, put in bags and marked 
 "Chilian Guano." The modus operandi is as follows: 

"The bags are first marked Chilian Guano ; they 
 are then moistened with water, and laid in a heap, in 
 layers, with a quantity of Peruvian Guano between each 
 layer. 

The sugar-house scum is pounded fine. Three bar- 
 rowfuls of "five half-bushels" each, then ai - e mixed 
 with six barrowfuls of Mexican guano. To this are ad- 
 ded one and a half bushels of common salt, one bushel 
 of plaster, three bushels of Peruvian guano, and a half 
 bushel of quick lime. When the Peruvian guano and 
 lime are added, "they make it tremendous strong." In 
 other words, the lime sets free the ammonia of the Pe- 
 ruvian guano and gives the manufactured Chilian gu- 
 ano a strong smell of hartshorn, which, to the unreflect- 
 ing, is a sure indication of a valuable guano. 

The floor where the bags were filled, was covered with 
 Peruvian guano, in order to make the article look as 
 much like genuine guano as possible." 

The mixture has been analyzed by Prof. Carr, chem- 
 ist to the New York State Agricultural Society, and re- 
 sulted as follow : 

Water 4.0 

Sand .â€ž 2.4 

Organic matter 15.3 

Phosphate of lime 24.5 

Sulphate of lime, (plaster) 9.5 

Chloride of sodium, (common salt) 6.2 

Carbonate of lime, (chalk) 37.6 

99.5 
 Ammonia 1.6 

Extensive efforts have been made to dispose of it both 
 in New York and Boston, as well as south, the price 
 asked being thirty-five and forty dollars per ton, its real 
 value being about thirteen dollars. 

As this appears to be a deliberate attempt to impose 
 on the farming community, we hope the guilty parties 
 whoever they are, will be ferreted out and their names 
 published. In matters of this kind, we dislike all indi- 
 rect hints and inferences. Let the charge and proof, 
 be broad, plain and direct, so as not to be misunder- 
 stood. 

Prof. Way, on Butter Making. 

In a recent lecture by Professor Way, before the Roy- 
 al Agricultural Society of England, "on the chemical 
 principles involved in the production of butter," he 
 gives it as his opinion "that a gentle, combined, centrif- 
 ugal, and ascending motion of the milk during the pro- 
 cess of creaming, would tend to make the cream rise 
 rapidly. 

This is so entirely opposed to all the practice of our 
 best dairymen, who consider the least disturbance of 
 the milk-pan injurious, that we should be pleased to 
 hear their opinions on Professor Way's theory. He 
 thinks "such a motion by means of weights and springs, 
 can be given to the milk pans on slowly rotating tables, 
 the sides of the pans having flanges on the inside 
 sloping from the top to the bottom, which would com- 
 municate an ascensional motion to the liquid."
