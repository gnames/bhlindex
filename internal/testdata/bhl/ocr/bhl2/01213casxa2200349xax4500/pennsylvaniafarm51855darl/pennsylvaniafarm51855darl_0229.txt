and in it; so, that timber cut in May is not subject to the 
 rotting influence of the sap, which in February or the win- 
 ter time has returned into the wood filling every pore. Some 
 think the sap goes down into the roots of the trees in winter, 
 which is evidently not so ; for cut a tree in the dead of win- 
 ter, let it be until May; it will then peel off its bark almost 
 as well as if ft had been cut after the sap begins to flow ; 
 which proves that the sap lies embedded in the wood during 
 winter — and timber cut when it is in that state is subject to 
 rot, or be eaten with worms. 

I had a fair trial of cutting hickory in the new of the 
 moon ; the dry spring, ten years ago, I had a grove of hick- 
 ory saplings which I cut in March; about the time I was 
 finishing, a cooper came along, wishing me to let him cut 
 some hoop-poles on the mountain land ; he said, two days 
 more the moon would full, and any cut after that the worms 
 would destroy. 1,-told him my disbelief in it, but said to 
 him, I have just hit the time in cutting my hickory poles, 
 for they have all been cut in the new of the moon. In Au- 
 gust, I hauled them off; they were dry and hard; I piled 
 them two or three wagon loads in a place. In the winter I 
 hauled them away and there could have been bushels of 
 worm-dust gathered under the pile ; they were so much de- 
 stroyed that in five or six loads I could not get so much of a 
 pole as would make a sound wedge. There was a large 
 hickory I left standing until May; I then cut it; some of 
 that tree lay out for four or five years and no worms ever 
 touehed it. So I believe that instead of looking to the 
 moon, we should look to the flowing of the sap as a good 
 time to cut timber. It has been said that there are two 
 days in August, in which if briers or sprouts are cut, they 
 will not grow again; it will generally kill briers to cut them 
 in August, from the fact, the weather then is warm and dry, 
 flir briers in full growth, and full of sap, which sours; this, 
 with the heat and dryness of that season of the year, it being 
 too late for vegetation to start again, gives the brier but little 
 chance for life ; but it is in no particular days, or the moon. 
 As for sprouting on those two days in August, when I first 
 heard of it, I had seven acres of new land, off of which no 
 crop had been taken; there were a great many sprouts on it. 
 I had it well sprouted on those two days, but when I came 
 to seed in September there were sprouts from six to nine in- 
 ches long, three' to one I had cut off in August. Now for 
 the horns of the moon being up and down, what effect has 
 it? in this I have had some experience I laid a stone on 
 the grass when the" horns of the moon were up, and when 
 they were down I laid another; some months after I lifted 
 them and if there was any difference, the one laid down 
 first (although the supposed effect of the upturned horns of 
 the moon keeps from sinking) was sunk most. The cause 
 of anything sinking or not sinking when laid on the ground, 
 is owing to the state of the ground ; lay any thing down 
 when ?he ground is wet, and it will kill the grass and sod 
 and sink a good distance in the ground; whereas, if it be 
 laid when the ground is dry and hard, it will not kill the 
 grass for a great while, nor sink much in the ground (let 
 the horns be pulling either up or down). By observing a 
 little, this effect may be seen by the farmer in harvest; in 
 shocking grain if the ground be wet, the shock will kill the' 
 clover, both top and roots; if the ground and weather be 
 dry, the shock may stand a long time and it will be found 
 that the clover will be alive and growing. I once spread 
 manure on a meadow after a heavy rain ; the sun came very 
 warm, and in a few days the manure was sticking on the top 
 of the grass like mushroons ; the sun dried the moisture out 
 of the manure, it became very light and the fast growing 
 grass lifted it up, not the upturned horns of the moon. 
 In laying the worm of a fence when the horns of the moon 

are up, to keep it from sinking, and to stake a rider when 
 they are down to keep it down; in driving shingles when 
 the horns are down ; in setting posts when they are up to 
 make the post keep its place ; how ridiculous! If the moon 
 had these supposed effects, would it not be absurd to plant, 
 reap or build, in any of the signs ? for it would be an alter- 
 nate pulling up and down as the moon would change so 
 that its effects would amount to nothing at last. 

I am now seventy years old, and I do not think I have 
 had an increase of one year of corn or grain of wheat, 
 through the influence of the moon in sowing or planting in 
 its signs. There are people in this county who look to all 
 the signs in the almanac for some purpose. I cannot see 
 anything in scripture or reason to make me believe that 
 there is anything in them. The scriptures speak of tilling 
 the soil, of digging and manuring, and the husbandman to 
 look for the early and latter rain; and Solomon says, "sow 
 your seed in the morning, and in the evening withhold not 
 your hand, for you do not know which will prosper;" but 
 says nothing of any signs. 

Those who look to moon signs, remind me of one of my 
 neighbors telling me how to make good vinegar; while 
 pouring in the ingredients, he thought of three of the cross- 
 eat women in the neighborhood; pouring in he would first 
 think of cross SaHy ; pour on, there is cross Jinny ; pour 
 on, there is cross Nelly. He makes use of the best material 
 for vinegar and .always has good; but he thought it all de- 
 pended on the cross women. What folly to think that old 
 women haAe anyinfluence on the vinegar. Just so, those, 
 who look to the signs of the moon, are in general good far- 
 mers; they plow, harrow and manure well, and have good 
 crops as the re"sWt; but they look to the moon for the in- 
 crease, on which it has no more influence in the way they 
 think it has than if they should hang up their hat in the 
 field. 

, But there are things on which the moon- has great influ- 
 ence, such as water, the ebbing and flowing of the tide; on 
 the minds of insane persons, the ripening of grain and fruits, 
 &c. These influences are owing to its attractive power on 
 the first, and its light on tho last two named objects, and 
 some others that might be mentioned.

[We find tho following article by our friend Wm. Stavely,

Mr. Editor : — In looking over an article in your last pa- 
 per, "Plant Summer Grain," my attention was particularly 
 directed to that part where you refer to hauling out manure 
 for corn and potatoes. I do not know that anything I can 
 say will enlighten the intelligent farmers of Bucks County, 
 or that they will deem any remark from so humble an indi- 
 vidual as the present writer of any importance. I am wil- 
 ling myself to receive instruction from the most illiterate 
 tiller of the soil; and I am candid in remarking, that I have 
 often received some excellent hints fron the unobtrusive 
 suggestions of the operatives employed upon our farms. At 
 all times, searching after any improvement in agriculture 
 that may throw light upon the profession of my choice, I 
 think it the duty of farmers generally to impart their expe- 
 rience for Ute benefit of others. 

For some years past it has been my practice to haul out 
 all the manure, in a suitable condition, for corn and potatoes. 
 I commence hauling late in the fall, and if practicable spread
