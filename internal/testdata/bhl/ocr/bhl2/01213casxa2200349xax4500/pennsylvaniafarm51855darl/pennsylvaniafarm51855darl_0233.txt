forth in an inconvenient direction, or in a direction which 
 will injure the symmetry of the head should be taken away. 
 A limb that is shooting out more vigorously than the rest, 
 may be shortened, and when two limbs are chafing each 
 other, one may be removed. Shoots that grow from the 
 trunk, will generally die or cease to grow, when nature has 
 no further service for them to perform. The idea of cutting 
 out the whole central portion of an apple tree, to let in the 
 sun, is wholly erroneous. The tree is thus deprived of a 
 large portion of its lungs, as well as of many of its best 
 bearing branches. In our climate the fruit so far from re- 
 quiring the direct rays of the scorching sun in midsummer, 
 requires to be protected from its rays by the foliage which 
 nature has provided. The directions given in English 
 books for the cultivation of fruit, are adapted to the moist 
 and cloudy atmosphere of England. The attempt to apply 
 them to the cultivation of fruit in our climate, has led to the 
 adoption of much erroneous practice. 

The best time for general pruning is a mooted question 
 among intelligent men. But my own belief is that the prop- 
 er time, in this climate at least, is in June and July, when 
 the leaves have attained their full size, and are in full health 
 and vigor, and are elaborating an abundance of sap. In 
 this state, a fresh wound will commence healing at once. 
 New bark is rapidly formed to cover the wound. It is the 
 descending sap from which the new bark as well as all the 
 other tissues of the tree is formed. When this sap, properly 
 elaborated in the leaves, is not furnished in the formative 
 vessels, no new growth of any kind is effected Hence it is 
 only when the leaves are in a condition to perform their 
 proper office, that the new growth necessary to effect the 
 healing of a wound can be accomplished. J. R. —

Trial of Mowers in Massachusetts. 
 Letter from Thomas Mottley, jr., on behalf of a committee 
 of tbe Massachusetts Society for Promoting Agriculture, in- 
 forming the Executive Committee that the Massachussets 
 Society had offered a premium of $600 for the best Mower. 
 "The possesser of the Mowing Machine which shall cut, du- 
 ring the present season, with the greatest economy and to the 
 best advantage, not less than fifty acres of grass, within the 
 State, the Machine to be worked by horse or ox power, shall 
 be entitled to the sum of $600" all other things being equal. 
 The Boaid also announces a premium of $1,000 to the maker 
 and exhibitor of the best Mowing Machine in 1856. A 
 general trial of the competing Machines will be had — of 
 which due notice, with the terms of trial, will be given. 

Keep Fruit Trees Straight. 
 Trees in an open exposure often acquire a leaning position 
 from the prevailing winds. This should not be suffered be- 
 yond a certain stage of the tree. When as large as one's 
 wrist they should be set up erect, and, indeed, thrown into 
 the wind at an angle of ten or fifteen degrees ; in order to 
 bring them ultimately into a straight position. This is best 
 done by obtaining crotched limbs from the woods, eight to 
 twelve feet long, and placing the butt end, which should be 
 sharpened, on the ground, and the crotch end either against 
 the trunk, immediately beneath the branching point, or 
 against a large outer limb, if more convenient, securing it 
 from chafing in the crotch, by a padding of straw, or litter, 
 and setting the tree up at once to the desired angle of eleva- 
 tion. Loosen, also, the ground on the windward side of the 
 root so that it will not bind, and the work is accomplished. 
 Let this be done when the tree begins to make its summer 
 growth, or soon after leafing out. One season, if the tree is 
 thrifty, will be all that is required. If, however, it be obsti- 

nate repeat the trial another year. The remedy is sure. Ev- 
 en large trees, which have acquired a permanent lean, maybe 
 thrown into an erect posture, by loosening the earth at the 
 root, and occasionally cutting off an obstinate large root, 
 without injury to its growth, and thus be made sightly. An 
 erect tree will be longer lived and more fruitful than a lean- 
 ing one, and not half so subject to casualty as if left to its 

own guidance. — Exchange.

How Mr. Sparrowgrass Went Down Stairs. 

One evening Mrs. S. had retired, and I was busy writing 
 when it struck me a glass of ice water would bo palatable. 
 So I took a candle and pitcher and went down to the pump. 
 Our pump is in the kitchen. A country pump, in the kitch- 
 en, is more convenient; but a well with buckets is certainly 
 most picturesque. Unfortunately, our well water has not 
 been sweet since it was cleaned out. First I had to open a 
 bolted door that lets you into the basement hall, and then I 
 went to the kitchen door which proved to be locked. Then I 
 remembered that our girl always carried the key to bed with 
 her, and slept with it under her pillow. Then I retraced my 
 steps; bolted the basement door, and went up into the dining 
 room. As is always the case, I found when I could not get 
 any water I was thirstier than I supposed I was. Then I 
 thought I would wake our girl up. Then I concluded not 
 to do it. Then I thought of the well, but gave that up on 
 account of its flavor. Then I opened the closet doors — there 
 was no water there ; and then I thought of the dumb waiter! 
 The novelty of the idea made me smile ; I took out two of 
 the movable shelves, stood the pitcher on the bottom of the 
 dumb waiter, got in myself with the lamp ; let myself down, 
 until I supposed I was within a foot of the floor below, and 
 then let go ! 

We came down so suddenly, that I was shot out of the ap- 
 paratus as if it had been a catapult; it broke the pitcher, 
 extinguished the lamp, and landed me in the middle of the 
 kitchen at midnight with no fire, and the air not much above 
 the zero point. The truth is I had miscalculated the dis- 
 tance of the descent — instead of falling one foot I had fallen 
 five. My first impulse was to ascend by the way I came 
 down, but I found that impracticable. Then I tried the 
 kitchen door, it was locked ; I tried to force it open ; it was 
 made of two-inch stuff, and held its own. Then I hoisted 
 the window, and there were the rigid iron bars. If I ever 
 felt angry at anybody, it was at myself for putting up those 
 bars to please Mrs. Sparrowgrass. I put them up, not to 
 keep people in but to keep people out. 

I laid my cheek against the ice-cold barriers and looked 
 out at the sky ; not a star was visible ; it was as black as ink 
 overhead. Then I thought of Baron Trenckand the prison- 
 er of Chillon. Then I made a noise ! I shouted until I was 
 hoarse, and ruined our preserving kettle with the poker. 
 That brought our dogs out in full bark, and between us we 
 made night hideous. Then I thought I heard a voice, and 
 listened — it was Mrs. Sparrowgrass calling to me from tho 
 top of the staircase. I tried to make her hear me, but the 
 dogs united with howl, and growl and bark, so as to drown 
 my voice which is naturally plaintive and tender. Besides 
 there were two bolted doors and double deafened floors be- 
 tween us ; how could she recognize my voice even if she did 
 hear it? Mrs. Sparrowgrass called once or twice, and then 
 got frightened ; the next thing I heard was a sound as if the 
 roof had fallen in, by which I understood that Mrs. Sparrow- 
 grass was springing the rattle. That called out our neighbor, 
 already wide awake. He came to the rescue with a bull- 
 terrier, a Newfoundland pup, a lantern and a revolver. The 
 moment he saw me at the window, he shot at me, but for- 
 tunately just missed me. I threw myself under the kitchen
