table and began to expostulate with him, but he would 
 not listen to reason. -In the excitement I had forgotten his 
 name, and that made matters worse. It was not until he 
 had roused up everybody around, broken in the basement 
 door with an axe, gotten into the kitchen with his savage dogs 
 and shooting iron, and seized me by the collar, that he re- 
 cognized me — and then wanted me to explain it! But what 
 kind of an explanation could I make to him ? I told him he 
 would have to wait until my mind was composed, and then 
 I would let him understand the whole matter fully. But he 
 never would have had the particulars from me, for I do not 
 approve of neighbors that shoot at you, break in your door, 
 and treat you in your own house, as if you were a jail bird. 
 He knows all about it, however — somebody has told him ; 
 somehody tells everybody everything in our village. — Put-

Spirits of Turpentine for Black Knot. 

Mr. A. E. Porter, in a communication by him in the New 
 England Farmer, recommends the application of spirits of 
 turpentine as a remedy for the black knot in plum trees. He 
 says that a friend of his used it in the following manner. He 
 was at work in his garden and about to cut down a plum tree 
 that was half covered with black knot. "Having" said he, 
 "some spirits of turpentine on hand, he bethought himself to 
 make an experiment on this tree before destroying it. He 
 cut the knots with a sharp knife down to the wood, and made 
 a thorough application of turpentine .Months passed the tree 
 lived, did well, aud the black knot was destroyed. Since 
 thsn he has been very successful with this remedy, and so 
 have others who have followed his example." 

Setting Hens. 
 In setting hens, thirteen eggs are enough to give them ; a 
 large hen might cover more, but a few stronger, well-hatch- 
 ed chicks are better than a large brood of weaklings that 
 have been delayed in the shell perhaps twelve hours over the 
 time from insufficient warmth. At the end of a week, it is 
 usual, with setting turkeys, to add two or three fowl's eggs, 
 "to teach the young turkeys to pick." The plan is not a 
 bad one; the activity of the chickens stirs up some emulation 
 in their larger bretheren. The eggs take up but little room 
 in the nest, and will produce two or three very fine fowls. —

Cheese Making. 

A few months ago I visited a lady friend in the country ; 
 her table was continually supplied with most delicious cheese 
 of her own making. I asked, as a particular favor, that she 
 would communicate to me her peculiar method of making it, 
 and wherein sho differed from others. She replied that she 
 followed the method she had been taught generally, prepared 
 the rennet in the same way, but felt sure she had discovered 
 the reason why cheeses were strong both to the taste and 
 smell, which consists in the single circumstance of putting 
 the curd to press warm. She did not use any artificial 
 means to cool the curd, but after it had been chopped and 
 scalded, allowed it to remain spread upon tho cloth until it 
 was cool as the surrounding atmosphere, and thus put it to 
 press. 

There is a great deal of probability in tho above statement, 
 for I have frequently noticed that some ehoeses from the same 
 dairy would be strong and offensive, and others mild and 
 agreeable, which may be owing to the circumstance of the 
 dairy-woman getting her cheese to press early some days, 
 and being hindered others until the curd had time to cool. 
 It may be well for dairy-women to try the experiment so as 
 to ascertain the fact. — N. E. Farmer. 

Delaware County Society. 
 The second annual Exhibition of the Delaware county 
 Agricultural Society, will bo held at Media, on Thursday, 
 Friday and Saturday, the 6th, 7th, and 8th of September 
 next. A large and liberal premium list is offered, calculated 
 to call forth tho Agricultural and Horticultural, as well as 
 manufacturing skill of the county. The exhibition of this 
 Society last year was ono of tho best we ever attended; and 
 there is every reason to presume, the coming one will be 
 equally successful, if not more so. We are gratified to find 
 the Penn. Farm Journal occupies considerable space in the 
 premium list. 

Southdown Sheep. 

We copy the following on the value of the Southdown 
 breed of sheep, from Lewis G. Morris' illustrated catalogue. 
 Those who have owned and reared Southdowns, will sub- 
 scribe to all he says in their favor. It strikes us, however, 
 he has underated the weight of their fleece. 

Will our friends Cope or Worth, who have long owned 
 such fine flock's of them, give us an account for our next 
 issue, of the weight of some of their fleeces ? 

"The wool of the Southdown Sheep weighs, when washed 
 about 3 lbs. the fleece ; but in some of the more highly-fed 
 flocks of the lower oountries,its weight is now 41bs. or more. 

I will now continue an account as to their relative value 
 as a wool-producing sheep, as contrasted with other breeds 
 in this country, and for which information I am indebted to 
 my friend Mr. Jonathan Stott, of Columbia County, N. Y., 
 who is well known as a gentleman of high standing, and for 
 many years a successful manufacturer of woolen goods. 
 On the 19th Dec. last, Mr. Stott paid me a visit, and examined 
 the wool on the back of my sheep, and also in the fleece (as I 
 had my last year's clip on hand). He prefaced his remarks 
 by stating that the Southdown produced the proper wool for 
 medium fabrics, which yield more profit to the manufacturer, 
 always creates a more ready demand at its rated value than 
 either finer or coarser goods; and stated that the average val- 
 ue of wool for the last five years, as taken from flocks in our 
 Western States, called fine wooled, which yield 2£ lbs. per 
 head, and worth 44 cents per lb. He rated the quality of 
 my Southdown wool as worth within 10 cents per lb. of the 
 fine wool, or 34 cents, and that the finest Saxony wool of a 
 few choice flocks in Pennsylvania, &c, have been worth for the 
 same number of years, average of 60 cents per lb., and would 
 yield about 2 lbs. per head. My flock of Southdowns, num- 
 bering about 100 all told, will average 5 lbs. Say a largo 
 flock of the same would yield 

4 lbs per head at 34c. $1.36 

Saxony Fleece would yield 2 " " 60c. 1.20 

The ordinary called fine icool 2 J " " 44c. 1.10 

This calculation gives the Southdown 16 cents per head 
 more than the Saxony, and 26 more than the ordinary fine 
 wooled. 

It is beyond a doubi correct, but for more certainty, I will 
 reduce the value of the Southdown per head in money cal- 
 culation, and take the ground that they will produce the 
 same amount of wool money per head. The above state- 
 ments as to weight are based upon the wool being well 
 washed on the back of the sheep, and put up in good salea- 
 ble order. In answer to the question as to how much dirt 
 there can be in wool that would pass for merchantable, he 
 said that if I wanted to get at the real weight of wool, to 
 take a fleece and wash it as clean as could be with warm 
 water, and after it was perfectly dry, add 15 per cent, to its 
 weight, or in other words, he thought merchantable wool 
 possessed 15 per cent of dirt.
