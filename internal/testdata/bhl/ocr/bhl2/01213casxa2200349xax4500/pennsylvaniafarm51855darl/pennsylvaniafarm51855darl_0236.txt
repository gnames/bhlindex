Smearing the Sheep : — Towards the close of September, 
 the shepherd performs the operation of smearing the sheep 
 with a heavy, irony earth; common in Spain. It is first 
 mixed with water, and then daubed on their backs, from the 
 neck to the rump. Some say it mingles with the oil of the 
 wool, and thus becomes a varnish impenetrable to the cold 
 and rain, others, that its weight keeps the wool down, and 
 prevents it from growing long and coarse ; and a third class, 
 that it acts as an absorbent, and receives a part of the pers- 
 piration, which would otherwise foul the wool and render it 
 rough. Be this as it may, it is a custom of long standing, 
 and probably it is useful both to the fleece and to the animal 
 which carries it, and answers the purpose of destroying ver- 
 min. 

Vandalism. 

"One night last week, ten fine Durham cattle belonging to 
 Col. Morris, of Morrisania, N. Y., were abstracted from his 
 premises and driven away. Some clue was obtained which 
 led to the discovery of the carcasses of cattle dressed and 
 exposed for sale in one of the New York markets. The 
 hides were found in Newark, New Jersey, whither the 
 rogues had taken the precaution to send them. Six of a 
 gang, of which it was ascertained there were ten in all were 
 arrested, and the Colonel has them now safely lodged in jail 
 in Westchester county, as he dared not trust to New York 
 city justice, for their safe keeping and trial." 

In view of the animals stolen being part of Col. Morris' 
 imported stock for breeding purposes, the indignation that 
 every jne must feel at such vandalism no one will be found 
 fully able to express ! — but will they take time to hit upon a 
 propef degree of punishment for infliction upon the — we 
 want terms in which to express our detestation! Our first 
 proposal is, for the State in which the offence was committed 
 to construct an iron cage with as many cells as there are crim- 
 inals, place it upon wheels, and attach to it a pair of the finest 
 horses in the country, and give it into the careof some very 
 respectable person to attend it; and set it to travel the 
 countrj', as a collection of "wild beasts of the most fero- 
 cious order," for exhibition at 12 1-2 cts. per head, women 
 and children at half price, and keep them going, until the 
 Talue of the animals and 50 per cent, above, shall have 
 been paid to the owners, after which the wretches may be 
 relieved, by the infliction of confinement for life ! — A first 
 thought, that might be improved upon, a friend just come 
 into the office proposing, that after the expenses of owner- 
 ship and travel have been defrayed, that they be given to 
 the jailor as his perquisite, to be continued on exhibition, 
 and be liable to be stirred up with a long pole," as often as 
 customers shall drop in to examine them ; at the same time, 
 that a certain portion of the receipts shall go to the sup- 
 port of their wives and families — Is it possible that such 
 wretches can have either ? — after a regular bill of divorce- 
 ment shall have been granted to their wives by the law- 
 courts. — Eds. — Boston Cultivator. 

Pea Weevils. 
 Few persons, (says Dr. Harris,) whilo indulging in early 
 green peas, are aware how many of these insects they swal- 
 low. When the pods are examined, small discolored spots 
 may be seen within them, each corresponding with a similar 
 spot on the opposite pea. On this spot a minute whitish 
 grub, without feet, will be found therein ; it is the weevil in 
 its larva form ; it lives upon the marrow of the pea, and ar- 
 rives at its full size by the time the time the pea is dry. This 
 larva then bores a large hole, from the hollow in the centre 
 of the pea, quite to the hull, but leaves the germ of the fu- 

ture sprout untouched. This insect is limited to a certain 
 period for disposing its eggs. Late sown peas escape its at- 
 tacks. Those sown after the ICth of June, are generally 
 safe. 

When the peas are green the Baltimore Oriole splits open 
 the green pods, for the sake of the grubs contained in the 
 peas, thereby greatly contributing to the decrease of these 
 noxious insects. The instinct that enables this beautiful 
 bird to detect the lurking grub, concealed as it is within the 
 pod and hull of the pea, is worthy of admiration. — Harris'

Destruction of Ants. 
 A correspondent of the Philadelphia Ledger says: — We 
 give you a sure remedy — procure a large sponge wash it 
 well, press it very dry ; by so doing it will leave the small 
 cells open — lay it on the shelf where they are most trouble- 
 some, sprinkle some fine white sugar on the sponge (lightly 
 over it) two or three times a day, take a bucket of hot water 
 to where the sponge is, carefully drop the sponge in the 
 scalding water, and you will slay them by the thousand, and 
 soon rid the house of these troublesome insects. When you 
 squeeze the sponge, you will be astonished at the number 
 that had gone in the cells. 

Culture of Lucerne. 

We have been informed by Mr. Lewis Mabry of this city, 
 that he has cultivated lucerne regularly for more than forty 
 years with the most satisfactory success. It has invariably 
 supplied him with the greatest abundance of green food of the 
 richest quality for soiling cows, and it makes a hay in all 
 respects equal to clover. There are plants now in Mr. Ma- 
 bry's yard which have been there for forty years. He has 
 usually had about two acres of ground in lucerne and his 
 mode of cultivation is as follows: — The land should be well 
 and deeply prepared, as the plants send down their tap roots 
 to a great depth. 

The soil should be dry and rich. The time for sowing 
 the seed is in September, and they should be sown broad- 
 cast. They soon vegetate, and the plants continue to grow 
 vigorously during the fall, and acquire sufficient strength to 
 withstand the severity of the coldest winters. In the spring, 
 they start off to grow in advance of all other vegetation, and 
 take entire possession of the ground. If the seed is sowed 
 in the spring, the grass will overtop and smother the lucerne, 
 unless it is drilled, in which case it requires frequent and 
 careful workings. It should not be sowed with any other 
 crop. When sowed in the fall, it will furnish two cuttings 
 the next season. The second season it will be fully estab- 
 lished, and yield as many as four cuttings, which it will con- 
 tinue to do for four years. By the expiration of that period it 
 will begin to die out in patches, and another sowing should 
 be made. The plants should not be suffered to bear seed 
 any further than is necessary for new growings. 

On the whole, Mr. Mabry considers lucerno as invaluable 
 particularly on small farms, from the great quantity of food 
 it supplies : thus enabling the possessor of only a few acres 
 to keep a number of cows, which, in their turn, furnish abun- 
 dant means of enriching the land, besides affording the 
 owner the luxury and profits to be derived from a good dairy. 
 We would especially recommend to our farmers in the neigh- 
 borhood of the city to make the experiment. With milk at 
 a sixpence a quart, and butter at 50 cents — never less than 
 37 J cents a pound, tho advantages to be derived from a dairy 
 appear to us to be very decided. 

Mr. Mabry informs us that the Alfalfa clover, about 
 which we made some inquiry a few weeks ago, is nothing 
 else than lucerne. — Southern Farmer. •
