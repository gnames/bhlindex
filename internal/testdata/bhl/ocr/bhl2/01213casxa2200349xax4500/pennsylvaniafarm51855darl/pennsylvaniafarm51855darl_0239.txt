NUMBER 8. 

Exhibition of the State Society at Harrisburg on the 
 25th, 26th, 27th and 28th of September. 

Now that the labors of the harvest are over, we hope 
 our farmers in all sections of the State will be turning 
 their attention to the approaching State Exhibition, and 
 making arrangements to throw in their contributions. 
 The Pennsylvania State Society is in a more prosperous 
 condition than that of any other State Society. All its 
 exhibition's have been most successful, and largely at- 
 tended. As a matter of State pride, no less than indi- 
 vidual duty, every farmer should lend a helping hand to 
 sustain its well earned reputation, and extend its useful- 
 ness. Every thing has been done this season by the 
 Secretary and Executive Committee in respect to conve- 
 nient ai*rangements and accommodations, which they 
 could think of, or which past experience has suggested. 
 The Pennsylvania Railroad Company have agreed to 
 issue excursion tickets at half price, which shall be good 
 for the whole week, and to transport all contributions of 
 stock, implements, or productions, free of cost, and the 
 same arrangement has been made with the Catawissa, 
 Sunbury and Erie, and other railroads.'' .These latter 
 roads will open to the exhibition a new section hereto- 
 fore very much kept out by difficulties of access. The 
 grounds selected at Harrisburg are most ample, and but 
 a few yards from the depot, where the contributions are 
 landed. A running stream passes through the grounds, 
 affording abundance of water for stock, while a strong 
 spring will be introduced by pipes for drinking purpo- 
 ses, yielding an abundant supply. Hay will also be 
 supplied as usual free of cost, and grain at cost prices. 
 The Secretary, R. C. Walker, informs us also that all 
 the public houses in Harrisburg have agreed not to raise 
 their ordinary prices during the fair. The address is to 
 be delivered by Judge Watts on Friday at one o'clock 
 It is also proposed to occupy three, at least, of the eve- 
 nings during the week by public lectures or addresses 
 on some department of agriculture, further notice of 
 which, with the names of the speakers, will be given 
 hereafter. At the last exhibition at Harrisburg, there 
 were gentlemen from a distance willing to lecture, biit 
 suitable rooms were pre-engaged by the infant drummer, 
 and other humbugs of the same stripe. On this occasion 
 the hall of the House of Representatives will be obtain- 
 ed, which is sufficient to accommodate the largest au- 
 dience 

Since our last exhibition at Powelton, a considerable 
 number of the best stock in the country has heen intro- 
 15 

duced into Pennsylvania from distant sections, several of 
 which have been noticed in the Farm Journal. There 
 will be a general anxiety to see these high bred animals, 
 and we hope our friends who have gone to great expense 
 in their purchase, will forward them to the exhibition at 
 Harrisburg. No equal opportunity occurs in the whole 
 year for bringing fine stock into public notice. 

In the implement department of agricultural machine- 
 ry, many new and valuable implements have also been 
 introduced since last season, and some then well thought 
 of have been greatly improved, or superseded by other3 
 found more efficient on trial. Specimens of all the im- 
 proved reaping and mowing machines will be brought 
 there, as well as other implements in great variety. 
 Steam power will be on the ground for use of exhibitors 
 where recpaired. 

In respect to products of the soil, — superior wheat, 
 corn, oats, potatoes, fruits, vegetables, &c. — there has 
 not been a season for many years in Pennsylvania of 
 such extraordinary abundance, and affording such mate- 
 rial for a superior display. 

On the whole we look for the approaching exhibition 
 at Harrisburg to be the best yet held in the State. We 
 would encourage our young farmers especially to be sure 
 to attend, believing they will carry away with them in 
 new ideas fifty per cent, more than the time and expense 
 of going.
