facts in relation to the subject. The first place visited 
 was Centre county, where Gen. James Irwin proposes to 
 donate to the Institution either of three farms of two 
 hundred acres each, which lie contiguous to each other, 
 at the junction of Penn's and Nittany Tallies, with the 
 pre-emption right to two hundred acres more, adjoining 
 either, at any time within five years. The land is worth 
 now, sixty dollars an acre. This additional quantity, 
 Gen. Irvin proposes to lease to the Institution until the 
 expiration of the five years, at a reasonable rent. This 
 point is situated about the centre of the united vallies, 
 about twenty miles north of the Pennsylvania Railroad, 
 at the mouth of Spruce Creek, and eight miles south of 
 Bellefonte. The land is a fine quality of limestone, 
 sufficiently rolling in its surface, «U cleared and fenced 
 but about thirty acres on eaoh farm : there is no stream 
 of water upon the surface of either, but water is easily 
 obtained by digging. The land is comparatively new, 
 having been all cleared within a few years, and the 
 grain now growing upon it shows the great fertility of 
 the soil. 

The next point we visited was in Erie county, where 
 Judge Miles proposes to give to the Institution two hun- 
 dred acres of land, which is situated about eighteen 
 miles west of the city of Erie, and lies above the mouth 
 of Elk Creek, between the railroad which bounds it oh 
 the south, and the lake shore. This land is in its char- 
 acter a sandy loam, highly fertile, with about one hun- 
 dred acres cleared and cultivated, and the residue in 
 heavy timber, of oak, hickory, chestnut, ash and hem- 
 lock; — this point, in -the situation," is commanding and 
 beautiful. Judge Miles will also give a pre-emption 
 right to any additional quantity of land which may be 
 desired, at sixty dollars an acre. 

Your committee next viewed the estate of Geo. A. 
 Bayard, Esq., of Allegheny county, situated on the 
 Youghageny River, about three miles from its mouth, 
 and eighteen miles from the city of Pittsburg. This 
 estate consists of six hundred acres of free stone land, 
 ■worth at present prices thirty five dollars an acre. 
 There has been a very large expenditure upon this 
 estate, in the erection of buildings, fences and other im- 
 provements, which are made of the most substantial and 
 durable materials. A large brick mansion has just been 
 erected, and is yet unfinished; — there are two large barns 
 and many dwelling houses orf the property, all of which 
 are built of cut stone ; — running water is abundant, and 
 the whole property lies in a bend of the Youghageny 
 River, which is navigated by steamboats at all seasons 
 of the year. Mr. Bayard proposes to sell this property 
 to the Institution, at such a price, and upon such terms, 
 as to time of payment, as would make the purchase de- 
 sirable and profitable. 

We were then invited to view the estate of Col. Elias 
 Baker, situate on the Pennsylvania Railroad, about two 
 miles south west of Altoona, in Blair county. Col. 
 Baker offers gratuitously two hundred acres of land, all 
 of which is cleared and fenced, except about forty acres, 
 and lies on both sides of the railroad; — that on the 
 south side, about sixty acres, is of a very good quality 
 of freestone land, and that on the north, is a good qual- 
 ity of slate land. There are upwards of two hundred 
 acres more in the tract which may be purchased at 

twenty-five dollars an acre. This land is finely watered. 
 Mill Creek passing through it, and over-head water can 
 be brought to any buildings which might be erected 
 upon the premises from a large and unfailing spring. 
 These are the only points which have been examined by 
 your committee, but since their return, they have re- 
 ceived a communication informing them that Mr. II. 
 Easton, of Franklin county, offers to donate for the pur- 
 poses of "The Farmers' High School" two hundred 
 acres of land, of the value of sixty dollars an acre, upron 
 condition of its location there, or that he will contribute 
 liberally, with others, to induce its location anywhere 
 within the county of Franklin. 

In the examination made by your committee, they 
 were accompanied by several members of the Board. 
 Messrs. Puobert C, Walker, II. N. McAlister, Hon. Wm. 
 Jessupj and Hon. A. 0. Heister, of whose opinion and 
 counsel' they had the advantage. It was a remark, com- 
 mon to all, that the feelings and interests of the peo- 
 ple of Pennsylvania had never been awakened to the 
 importance of this subject. Everywhere they went, and 
 and every one they saw, seemed to increase the impres- 
 sion, that this, of all things else, is what Pennsylvania 
 wants — a place where farmers may safely and cherfply 
 educate their sons in the science and practice of 
 agriculture. 

There is not one point viewed by your committee 
 which would not be eligible for the location of " The 
 Farmers' High School." But so little has heretofore 
 been known throughout the State of the movement now 
 being made for its establishment, and the determined 
 purpose of the Board of Trustees to act speedily, that it 
 would be inexpedient -and injudicious that your commit- 
 tee should v at this moment recommend the adoption of, 
 one site as more eligible than the others. One already 
 offered, they have had no opportunity to see, and doubt- 
 less others will be presented possessing advantages to 
 command the attention of the Board. 

The point where the school shall be located is a matter 
 of very great interest, and should not be hastily deter- 
 mined nor until greater publicity should be given to 
 the fact that the Board are about to act definitely upon 
 the subject. Which is respectfully submitted.

The committee then offered the following resolutions 
 which were agreed to. 

Resolved, That when this Board adjourns it be to 
 meet again at this place on Wednesday, the 12th of 
 September next, at 10. o'clock, A. M., and that the 
 Board will then proceed to determine finally the point 
 where the " Farmers' High School," shall be located. 

Resolved, That the duties of the committee heretofore 
 appointed to receive communications ami examine pro- 
 posed points of location be continued; and should any 
 further propositions be made, that they report the same 
 to the Board at its next meeting. 

Whereas, The determination of the Board speedily to 
 put the " Farmers' High School" into operation renders 
 it necessary that a Principal to conduct its operations 
 and teachings, and especially to aid in its organization, 
 should be chosen ; therefore,
