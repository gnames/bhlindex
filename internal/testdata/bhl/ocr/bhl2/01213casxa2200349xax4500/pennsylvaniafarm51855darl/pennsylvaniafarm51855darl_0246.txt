Shorthorns, their Pedigrees, and Milking Powers. 

In my last letter to you on th«. subject of short-boms* I 
 mentioned that I had a cow in calf to the Puke of Glo'ster 
 (11382). On Saturday last, the 9th of June, she produced 
 a fine roan calf, which to my great satisfaction proved to be 
 a bull. As the births of thorough-bred foals are recorded as 
 they occur, so it would not be uninteresting if the births of 
 the highest bred calves of the short-horn race were chroni- 
 cled in like manner. In modern times, the latter have 
 brought prices quite as high as the fonner„ and they cer- 
 tainly are as well worth them, since they conduce in an 
 «qual degree to the improvement of their race. In order to 
 sustain the claim of my calf to the honour of his name ap- 
 pearing in your columns, I add the pedigree of his dam: — 
 Terret-Roan, of 1S49 (bred by Mr. G. Bell), by 4th Duke of 
 York (10167); dam, Fancy by Duke of Northumberland 
 (1940); grandam, Fanny by Shortfall (2621); gr. g.-dam. 
 Fletcher the 2d by Belvidere (1706) ; ■ gr. gr. g,-dam, by a 
 son of Y'oung Winyard (2859), descended from Mr. J. 
 Brown's old Red Bull. 

It will be evident to any one conversant with the pedi- 
 grees of Mr. Bates' herd, that there is much very close 
 breeding in that of my calf, and yet he far exceeds any calf 
 I have bred this year in size and stoutness; in fact, his size 
 is considerably above the average. This is another confirm- 
 ation of the truth of Mr. Bates' view, that although to breed 
 in and in from bad stock was, to use his own expression, 
 "ruin and devastation," yet that the practice may be safely 
 followed within certain limits where the animals so related 
 are descended from first-rate parents, and are themselves of 
 undeniable excellence. In this, as in every other point, 
 success or failure depend upon the judgment of the breeder. 
 It is, however, so much more common for men to over-esti- 
 mate the merits of their own stock than to rate them too 
 low, that it cannot but be useful to breeders carefully to 
 guard against this tendency in themselves. It is certain 
 that he who keeps his eyes open to excellence, wherever it 
 exists, and avails himself of it whenever it is within his 
 reach, will in the end have abetter herd than he who, taking 
 it for granted that his stock is perfection, never troubles 
 himself to look beyond it The history of short-horn breed- 
 ing affords abundant evidence of the truth of this maxim, 
 from the time when Mr. C. Colling purchased Hubback, 
 which though of unknown pedigree, is an an6estor of many 
 of our best short-horns, down to the introduction of Cleve- 
 land Lad by Mr. Bates into his herd. . 

I think that Mr. Horsfall, in his interesting record of his 
 dairy practice, does not state whether he adheres to any one 
 breed of cows, or whether he purchases such as he conceives 
 best adapted for milking, irrespective of any other consider- 
 ation. It would be both useful and interesting, however, if 
 he and other agriculturists would state the results of their 
 experience of the milk-producing powers of the .principal 
 breeds of cattle in the kingdom. As regards the short- 
 horns, there is, I believe, a prevalent notion that they are 
 indifferent milkers. Although facts may seem to lend a cer- 
 tain degree of support to this opinion, it is nevertheless a 
 mistake which an impartial investigation must dispel. In 
 the first place, the principal ancestors of the improved short- 
 horns — the old Holderness cows — were, and are still, the 
 deepest milkers in the kingdom. Is it likely then, that 
 these descendants should wholly have lost this valuable 
 property? It may, indeed, be alleged that the celebrated 
 cross with the Galloway cow resorted to by Mr. C. Colling, 
 may have produced injurious consequences in this respect. 
 I think that the effects of this "alloy," whether for good or 
 the reverse, have been over estimated, inasmuch as the cow 
 •'Lady," from which this family is descended, had only one- 

sixteenth of the Galloway blood in her veins. As Favourite 
 (2521 was quite unconnected with the "alloy," as were also 
 several other celebrated originals of the short horns, it is 
 evident that the union of them with the cow Lady would 
 give one thirty-second of that cross in the next generation. 
 Except, therefore, in those herds where the "alloy" has been 
 purposely followed out, it may be estimated that from one- 
 fortieth to one fiftioth of Galloway blood is the utmost pro- 
 portion which exists in modern short-horns, and it is obvi- 
 ously insufficient to obliterate any well established property 
 belonging to the original race. 

But leaving the domain of speculation to pass to that of 
 fact, are the improved short-horns good dairy cows or not? 
 From a considerable mass of evidence which I have collected 
 to prove the affirmative of this proposition, my limits here 
 only allow me to refer to the pamphlet of the Rev. H, Berry, 
 who gives a long list of cows of the highest pedigree, with 
 the measured quantity of milk given by each. Soveral of 
 the'se gave 24 quarts daily; one 32, another 36, and one as 
 much as 38 quarts. From this authentic testimony as to the 
 early character of tho breed, I must pass on to the valuable 
 article of Mr. Dickenson (Journal of the Royal Agricultural 
 Society, vol. xi.) on the farming of Cumberland, and tho 
 perusal of which I recommend to all who are interested in 
 this subject. He mentions a high-bred cow called Kate, 
 which gave 13 quarts at a meal, and from this quantity 
 yielded at the end of a week 26 lbs. of butter. About the 
 fact itself there can be no doubt, resting as it does on the 
 testimony of tho owner, Mr. Fisherson, of Banker Lodge. 
 Another cow mentioned by Mr. Dickenson produced in 32 
 weeks 373 lbs. of butter, being at the rate of lljj lbs. per 
 week. 

My own experience pn the subject is, that whilo their 
 milking powers are at Least equal to those of any other 
 breed, they possess over all others the great advantage of 
 keeping their condition on food on which Common cows 
 would starve. I am far from maintaining that all short- 
 horns are good milkers. Two causes have contributed to 
 injure them in this respect; 1st. That being a point to 
 which many breeders are indifferent, they have selected 
 their Originals and continued to breed solely with reference 
 to symmetry, size, and the propensity to early maturity. As 
 therefore not only good qualities but the lack of them de- 
 scend, it cannot be', surprising that many short-horns give 
 but little milk. 2d. From the emulation of breeders to 
 show the finest animal at the earliest age, a system of pam- 
 pering is begun at birth and carried on until the animal is 
 either sold or slaughtered, which from the premature devel- 
 opment of fat which it produces, tends to depress every 
 other vital function. This system, unfavorable as it is for 
 allowing the milk producing powers to develop themsolves 
 in any individual subjected to it, is fatal when pursued for 
 generation after generation. After a time, "function," to 
 use the words of Dr. Playfair, "begins to react on organi- 
 zation," and a tribe of bad milkers is formed, among which 
 individuals may even occur which will give no milk. Most 
 sincerely do I wish that the forcing system was utterly ex- 
 ploded, injurious as it is alike to tho short-horns themselves 
 and their reputation. If they will not thrive on the ordi- 
 nary keep of other breeding stock, the sooner they are aban- 
 doned the better. But it is their pre-eminent merit that 
 they are the best thrivers in existence. As milkers, when 
 well selected and rationally treated, it is hot easy to find 
 cows which will excel them. Sometimes even they will at 
 one and the same time give large quantities of milk, and 
 carry a great deal of flesh, although this is not in general 
 desirable. 

When I think of the number of good milkers I have known
