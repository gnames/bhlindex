son's growth, and it should be mature — that is, it should 
 have completed its growth, which is indicated by the forma- 
 tion of a bud on the point, called the terminal bud, and the 
 buds inserted should all be wood buds. On a shoot of this 
 kind thero are a number of buds unsuitable for working ; 
 those at the base being but partially developed, are liable to 
 become dormant, and those on the point, where the wood is 
 pithy, perish. The ripening, or maturing of the buds, must 
 regulate the period of budding, so that the time at which 
 any given tree or class of trees should be worked, depends 
 upon the season, the soil, and other circumstances which 
 control the ripening of wood. In our climate, plums usually 
 complete their growth earlier than other fruit trees, and are, 
 therefore, budded first; we usually have ripe buds by the 
 middle of July. In some cases, when the stocks are likely 
 to stop growing early, it becomes necessary to take the buds 
 before the entire shoots have completed their growth, and 
 then the ripe buds from the middle and lower parts are 
 chosen. Cherries come nest, and are generally worked 
 about the first of August. The buds must be mature, or a 
 failure' will be certain. 

In the third place, the stock must be in the right condi- 
 tion — that is, the bark must lift freely and cleanly from the 
 Wood, and there must be a sufficient quantity of sap between 
 the bark and wood to sustain the inserted bud and form a 
 union with it. Stocks, such as the common sorts of plum, 
 pear, and cherry, that finish their growth early, must be 
 worked early; while such as the Peach, Quince, wild or na- 
 tive Plum, ' Mahadeb Cherry, <tc, that grow late, must be 
 worked late. If these stocks that grow freely till late in the 
 autumn be budded early, the buds will either be covered up, 
 "drowned," as it is technically called, by the rapid formation 
 of new woody substance, or they will be forced out. into a 
 premature growth. 

A very great degree of sappiness, in either the stock or 
 bud, make up, in part, for the dryness of the other. Thus, 
 in the fall, when plum buds are quite dry, we can work them 
 successfully on stocks that are growing rapidly. This is a 
 very fortunate circumstance, too. Young stocks, with a 
 smooth, clean bark, are more easily and successfully worked 
 than old ones, and when it happens that the latter have to 
 be used, young parts of them should be chosen to insert the 
 bud on. 

In localities where buds are liable to injury from freezing 
 and thawing in the winter, the buds are safer on the north 
 side of the stock, and when exposed to danger from wind, 
 they should be inserted on the side facing the point where 
 the most dangerous wind blowg i from. Attention to this 
 point may obviate the necessity of tying up, which, in largo 
 practice, is an item of some moment. 

In the fourth place, the manual operation must be per- 
 formed with neatness and dispatch. If a bud be taken off 
 with ragged edges, or if it be ever so slightly bruised, or if 
 the bark of the stock be not lifted clean 'without bruising 
 the wood under it, the case will certainly be a failure. The 
 budding knife must be thin and sharp. A rough edged ra- 
 zor is no more certain to make a painful shave, than a rough 
 edged budding knife is to make an unsuccessful bud. It 
 takes a good knife, a steady hand, and considerable practice 
 to cut off buds handsomely, well, and quick. As to taking 
 out the particle of wood attached to the bud, it matters little, j 
 if the cut be good and not too deep. In taking out the 
 wood, great care is necessary to avoid taking the root of the 
 bud with it. Then, when the bud is in its place, it must be 
 well tied up. Nice, smooth, soft strips of bark, like narrow 
 ribbons, are the best and most convenient in common use. 
 Every part of the cut must bo wrapped so firmly as to exclude 
 air completely; and this should be done as quickly as pos- 

sible, as the air soons blackens the inner surface of the new 
 parts that are placed in contact. 

We have thus stated briefly, for the benefit of beginners, 
 the chief points that require particular attention in budding, 
 or inoculation. Amateurs, who have little to d>>, should 
 choose the mornings and evenings, or cloudy, cool days, to 
 do their budding; but nurserymen must work in all weath- 
 ers, and in all hours'of the day; but their superior skill and 
 quickness renders it less hazardous. When only a few stocks 
 are to be worked, and the weather happens to be dry, a 
 thorough watering or two will be of great service in making 
 the bark lift freely: — Horticulturist. 

What Food will Produce the most Wool 
 Peas, beans, votches, etc., are useful for tho purpose of 
 enriching the blood, by furnishing it with large supplies of 
 albumen, which is its principal constituent. It will bo re- 
 membered that in the analysis of flesh and blood the rela- 
 tive proportions of their constituents are nearly identical; 
 consequently, whatever food contains nitrogen, and the 
 greatest amount of albumen, is best adapted to the develop- 
 ment of flesh or muscle, and is therefore the most nutritious. 
 Wheat, rye, barley and buckwheat, contain large quantities 
 of albumen, especially the first two; while oats, it will have 
 been seen, contains ten and a half per cent, of its organic 
 elements of albumen, and peas and beqns no less than twenty 
 nine per cent. What conclusion, then, is to be drawn from 
 this? The chemical composition of horns, hoofs, hair", wool, 
 and even feathers, is substantially the same; their organic 
 elements are coagulated albumen and gelatin, and their in- 
 organic, silica, carbonate and phosphate of lime, and tho 
 oxides of iron and maganese. Hence it will readily appear 
 that food given to the 'sheep which will supply the greatest 
 proportion of albumen, in the same ratio will increase tho 
 wool secretions, and, consequently, be productive of the most 
 wool, provided, however, tiny also hold in suitable combina- 
 tion the inorganic substances of wool, without which they as- 
 similate mostly for the formation of flesh or fat. This may 
 be exemplified thus : a soil may be highly productive of 
 corn, as well as a few of the cereal grains, yet for the pro- 
 duction of wheat, it may lack the proper proportion of the 
 phosphate and carbonate of lime, and, consequently, the 
 berry will not only be deficient in quantity but quality. 

The following table exhibits the results of the experiments 
 of the distinguished agriculturist, De Raumer, on the effects 
 produced by an equal quantity of several substances in in- 
 creasing tho flesh, tallow, and wool of sheep.
