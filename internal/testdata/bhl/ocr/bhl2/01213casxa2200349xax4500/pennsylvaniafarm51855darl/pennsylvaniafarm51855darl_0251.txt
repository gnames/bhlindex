Remarks upon the Mowing Scale : — After the full re- 
 marks upon the Reaping Scale, it is unnecessary to add 
 much here. The plan is easily understood. The first four 
 points are unaltered. The 5th in reaping is divided, making 
 the 5th and 6th, and increasing the aggregate 10. The 7th 
 is largely increased, because of the difficulty and importance 
 of getting machines that will cut without choking. The 8th 
 is not altered, though it might, perhaps, be reduced. The 
 9th is reduced 6, because of reduction in expenses of work- 
 ing the Mower as compared with the Reaper; The 10th is 
 also reduced, for though an important point, there is not the 
 difference in Mowers in the manner of leaving the grass, to 1 
 make a higher amount necessary to fairly compare them. 
 Nearly all leave the grass spread perfectly.

Were all machines alike easily converted from Reaper into 
 Mower, and vice versa, the best combined machine would be 
 that which reaches the highest aggregate in the two scales ; 
 but in consequence of varying in this respect, this other 
 point must be added, making the points in a perfect com- 
 bined machine reach 550.

The Physical Laws on which the Drainage of Land De- 
 pends. 
 [Continued from May number.] 

Whilst upon the earth's surface, the motion of water is 
 regulated by its weight or gravity as the operating force; 
 and that is interfered with principally by the antagonistic 
 force of capillary attraction, by evaporation, and by the con- 
 formation of the substances over or through which it 
 passes. 

Suppose rain to fall, or water to run down a hill-side upon 
 a flat surface below. If that surface be rock, impervious to 
 water, it flows over the surface until it meets with a lower 
 level, by which it passes off; whether that be a fissure in tho 
 rock, (in which case it forms a cascade, and afterwards a 
 river in the lower ground beyond,) or by a lower level of 
 equal capacity with that from which it flowed, (in which 
 event it would, as before, flow evenly over it.)- But if the 
 rain descend upon soil instead of upon rock, it will be carried 
 by its weight downwards through the soil with greater or 
 less velocity according to the greater or less porous texture 
 of the ground on which it falls. As soon, however, as a 

portion of the water is beneath the surface, capillary attrac- 
 tion begins to exercise a certain amount of force in addition 
 to the one of gravity, which continues its influence. This 
 attraction retains within the pores of the soil (and which 
 may be viewed as an accumulation of minute tubes) a cer- 
 tain portion of the water, and the remainder only then 
 passes downwards by the force of gravity. 

It is found moreover, that tho power of capillary attraction 
 varies in different substances ; and it varies also in force, in 
 a ratio inverse to the size of the tubes in which it takes place' 
 Vegetable soils are favorable to the increase of the force in 
 a greater degree than clay, in so far as regards their texture, 
 but they part with water more readily. Whilst clay, from 
 the moro minute size of its pores, commands in that respect 
 a greater force of capillary attraction than vegetable soil, 
 and retains water with greater tenacity. 

Assume, then, sections to be made on the sides of two 
 hills, one of sand and the other of clay, of equal height, and 
 that rain fell on the top of each, the observer who placed 
 himself at the section to watch the course of the descent 
 of the falling shower through the soil, would find that the 
 water on each hill-top would sink down perpendicularly a 
 certain distance, and would be attracted, or sucked up, by 
 the top-soil ; but if the quantity falling was greater than the 
 rapidity of its downward course, (owing either to the close 
 nature of the soil, or the intervention of rock or other im- 
 pediment), the surface-soil becoming" saturated, the water 
 would be seen to ooze out and run down the face of the sec- 
 tions of each hill. So far,. the phenomena presented would 
 be identical. But the following difference in the two sec- 
 tions would be noticed: the perpendicular distance from the 
 hill-tops, or surface-level, at which the water first oozed out, 
 would be found to be much less in measurement in the side 
 of the sand-hill, than in the 'case of the clay-hill; and the 
 reason is this : the superincumbent weight of water requi- 
 site to counterbalance the power of capillary attraction in 
 the sandy soil, would be much less than that which was ne- 
 cessary to counterbalance the same power in the close- 
 grafhed clay; and, consequently (by the natural laws above 
 stated), the column of water above the oozing point would 
 require to be much higher to effect the object. Inasmuch, 
 however, as the force of capillary attraction does not pre- 
 vent the passage of surplus water through the interstices, in 
 substances upon which it is acting, whilst, on the one hand, 
 it will always retain so much water as its power can com- 
 mand (and the extent of which will, as before mentioned 
 depend upon the nature of the substance, and tho size of the 
 tubes), it, on the other, presents no obstacle to the continued 
 passage of water from the surface to the substrata: the ve- 
 locity with which it will so pass depending upon various 
 additional considerations. 

It is upon the above data that the whole process of Under- 
 draining is based. 

But we must now inquire what becomes of that part of 
 the water which is not held in suspension near the surface 
 by capillary attraction, when, by its gravity, it has accumu- 
 lated in quantities in the substrata below. The passage 
 downward continues in perpendicular lines from the surface, 
 until its further progress in that direction is impeded (as 
 has been before observed) by some non-porous obstacle, 
 when, if it cannot find vent laterally, it accumulates, and, 
 obeying the law of finding a level, it forms a "water-line" 
 at a given depth (sometimes called a water-table), which 
 level is elevated nearer to the surface, in proportion to the 
 quantity failing upon such surface. Thus it remains stag- 
 nant, except so far as its mass is diminished by the capillary 
 attraction constantly going on in the soil above the water- 
 line, which is induced to supply the loss of moisture in it,
