occasioned by tho evaporation which is constantly emana- 
 ting from the surface. 

In this condition it is that, for profitable farming, land, 
 when this water-line is so near the surface as to interfere 
 with vegetation, requires to be drained, no less than it does 
 when this water stands on the surface; and this introduces 
 to us the question of the manner of effecting that objoct. 

A Remedy Against Mildew. 

A question was asked some time since by one of our cor- 
 respondents, whether sulphuret of potash had ever been 
 employed as a remedy against Jfihhw? We cannot say 
 whether it has been so applied in this country, but-it has 
 been used in France successfully, and if an acid be added a 
 fine precipitate of sulphur is deposited from the aqueous 
 solution upon the leaves of the Vine or Hop, in a manner 
 which would not be effected by any dredging. It is, in fact, 
 when properly diluted, precisely what is used very frequently 
 for baths in certain cutaneous disorders. In all such appli- 
 cations tb*e main question is how does sulphur act? This is 
 evidently a point of great importance,' and from tho insolu- 
 bility of sulphur under ordinary circumstances not very easy 
 of explanation. - , 

We do not profess to be in a condition to answer this sat- 
 isfactorily, but the observations we have to offer may induce 
 some one to attend a Ijttle more closely to the matter. Sul- 
 phur has evidently a very prejudicial effect on fungi, as it 
 has indeed on all organic beings if exposed to it in a proper 
 form and in a sufficient degree of concentration. The use 
 of sulphur in cutaneous disorders whether arising from in- 
 sect or vegetable parasites; the effect of hyposulphite of 
 soda on the curious vegetable production known by the name 
 of Sarcina, from its resemblance to little..corded bales, which 
 is so common in cancerous affections of the human stomach; 
 and the destructive power which it has over parasitic moulds 
 are all evidences of this fact. One particular instance may 
 perhaps afford a clue to its action over the latter. It is well 
 known that if a bundle of brimstone matches be burnt in a 
 barrel, the fermentation of wine when placed in that barrel 
 will be arrested. Now the fumes of brimstone consist of 
 sulphurous acid, and as the whole body of the wine placed 
 in the cask is affected, the quantity of the acid which is ca- 
 pable of arresting tho growth of the yeast fungus must be 
 almost infinitesimal. Now if the leaves of plants infested 
 with mould are dusted with sulphur, though the sulphur is 
 insoluble in water and may bo exposed to ordinary air for a 
 long time without change, it is very possible that the oxygen 
 just separated from the foliage by the action of light in 
 effecting the decomposition of carbonic acid, or arising from 
 other chemical processes taking place within the plant, being 
 in a nascent, state, may readily combine with a portion of 
 the sulphur, and thus form sulphurous acid, and still more 
 in the application of a solution of sulphuret of potash with 
 the addition of an acid, where the sulphur is in the act of 
 being eliminated, and can combine at once, under tho most 
 favorable circumstances, with the nascent oxygen. 

It would be easy for a good chemist to ascertain precisely 
 whether sulphurpus acid is really formed under such circum- 
 stances, or whether some other combination of sulphur and 
 oxygen is given out, and it would bo doing good servico to 
 the horticulturist to ascertain the point. Where sulphur is 
 used to combat disease in the human frame, especially when 
 applied inwardly, more than one combination takes place, 
 and a large portion of the substance, when taken in a crude 
 state, passes away unaltered. In its application to tho pur- 
 poses of cultivation it is likewise a small portion only in all 
 probability which is effectual; and if the action could bo 
 precisely ascertained the results might be of great impor- 

tance, in an economical point of view, where it is used 
 largely, as in Hop gardens. M. J. B.

Mistletoe on the Oak. 
 From an article in your last number there appears t<> be 
 still a doubt as to the fact of the Mistletoe growing upon 
 the Oak-tree. I remember having seen it once, and but 
 once, growing upon that tree. Having (about 17 years ago) 
 occasion to walk from Glanusk Park, in Breconshire, to 
 Abergavenny, I took the foot-path along the bank of tlo 
 Newport and Brecon canal, and in the course of my walk 
 was most, agreeably surprised at finding an old Pollard Oak 
 completely covered with Mistletoe. I took great pains to 
 examine tho tree, and I am quite satisfied of the fact. I do 
 not at this distance Of time recollect the precise spot, but 
 any gentleman residing in that locality who has leisure and 
 would feel sufficient interest in the case, might set tho mat- 
 ter at rest by procuring a portion of the treo with the Mist- 
 letoe growing upon it and sending it to your office. The 
 Mistletoe grows plentifully upon the Apple tree in Brecom 
 shire. — T. Ann in London Gardeners' Chronicle.

New Artificial Stone. 
 The composition of sand, plaster of Paris, and blood, for 
 which a patent has been granted, is capable of being molded 
 into the most elaborate architectural ornaments and copies of 
 sculpture; and it' assumes the character of stone in a few 
 hours, without baking or any other specific treatment after 
 being molded. The manufacture of this stone is at present 
 carried on at the Hamilton Works, Newark, N. J., and a 
 company of men of capital has been formed, John Wood, 
 being at the present time its Secretary. A meeting of those 
 interested in the undertaking was held at the Metropolitan 
 Hotel in this city, on the evening of the 15th inst., at which 
 some beautiful specimens were exhibited, and one made, but 
 a few hours before. These comprised, trusses, lintels, sill- 
 tops, and bas-relief for a new store on the corner of Colum- 
 bia and Carrol streets, Brooklyn, which excited admiration. 
 These resembled the common brown free stone used for 
 buildings in our city, and" in hardness and strength were 
 equal, if not superior to it. It grows harder with age, and 
 its introduction for building and architectural purposes, pre- 
 sents in prospect the dawning of a new era in architecture, 
 as ornamental work, like brown free stone, can be produced 
 by molding this composition, at a cost far below that re- 
 quired for carving such work with the mallet and chisel. —

California Glow Worm — Natural Lantern. 
 The editor of the Placer Times, Cal., has seen tho larvsa 
 of an insect which was exhibited before the California Acad- 
 emy of Natural Sciences, by Dr. Behr, who supposes it to 
 be a species of electer. "It is about 1J inches long, and has 
 eleven segments or rings to its body. Where these join to 
 each other is a ring of brilliant phosphorescent light, which 
 illuminates tho atmosphere for several inches round. It ex- 
 hibits the most beautiful display of tho kind that we ever 
 saw. The common glow-worm, with which we have been so 
 often amused in our boyish days, is insignificant by its side. 
 As tho respiratory apparatus of the animal is at these artic- 
 ulations, Dr. Behr thinks it not improbable that its illumi- 
 nating process may bo connected with this function of the 
 animal."— Scientific American.
