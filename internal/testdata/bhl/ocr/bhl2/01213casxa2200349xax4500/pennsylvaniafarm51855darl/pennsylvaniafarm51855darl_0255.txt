serve to facilitate the passage of other substances into the 
 plant. Phosphate of lime, phosphate of magnesia, and sil- 
 ica, are somewhat soluble in water containing carbonate of 
 ammonia, and thus become absorbable. Every soil contains 
 carbonate of lime, which is rarely free from alkali, and this 
 under the influence of the sun's heat decomposes the sal- 
 ammoniac and sulphate of ammonia, whereby soluble lime, 
 salts, and carbonate of ammonia are formed. Thus the am- 
 monia salts are not only the chief means of supplying ni- 
 trogen to the plant, but they also serve as a medium for fa- 
 cilitating the passage of those substances into the plant 
 which are indispensable requisites of its development. No 
 wonder then that they operate so "favorably." 

As I have shown in my work, the state of solubility or 
 absorbability of mineral manures has the greatest influence 
 on their effects, and for this reason it is that e. g. the hard, 
 dense apatite (phosphorite, mineral-phosphate) paoduces in 
 a given time a less effect than an equal weight of burned 
 bones, and that the activity of the latter is so greatly height- 
 ened by mixture with sulphuric acid, whereby their solubil- 
 ity is increased. 

It is all these circumstances taken together, that makes an 
 estimate of the value of a manure so difficult,- since in a cer- 
 tain form it may be apparently ineffective, while in another 
 its value is at once manifest. 

That the alkalies, and alkaline earths, phosphoric and sul- 
 phuric acids, are indispensable to all plants, and in addition, 
 silica, for the cereals, has been abundantly proved by the 
 experiments of Pollstorf, Salm-Horstmar, Wolff, Mag- 
 nus, and others. No chemist, no vegetable physiologist, in 
 short no scientific man, who is able to give facts their logi- 
 cal expression, doubts the truth of this doctrine, which, as is 
 known, is not yet old, for Dumas, even in 1840, obviously 
 supporting his opinions on the investigations of De Saus- 
 sure, considered the presence of these bodies in the plant 
 as accidental. (Dumas, Statique Chemique.) 

Upon the views which Sprengel entertained upon these 
 substances and their part in vegetable development, I have 
 expressed myself in the Ann. d. Chem. u. Ph. Bd. XXXVII, 
 §226. The most that was known as to the occurrence and 
 the importance of the mineral ingredients; in fact all that 
 was known before 1840, with any certainty, in vegetable 
 physiology and agricultural chemistry, was based on the in- 
 vestigations of De Saussure (Recherches sur la Vegetation,) 
 and the work of Davy, to whom I have given full cred- 
 it. 

All that, until that time, had been transferred into botan- 
 ical and agricultural books, was a very imperfect epitome of 
 their remarkable labors. The value of wood-ashes as a fer- 
 tilizer was previously known. Already 127 years ago, Hales 
 noticed their use at length. (Vegetable Statics, 1727.) 

In the years 1845-49, I instituted a series of experiments 
 on the action of individual mineral manures. They were 
 conducted on a pretty large scale, on a field of about ten 
 English acres, (16 Hessian morgen) which I received from 
 the city of Giessen for that purpose. Former experiments 
 which I had made in my garden in the city, gave no results ; 
 do and apply what I would, I was not able to perceive any 
 effect from a single one of my mixtures. The single cause 
 of this apparent inefficiency I found to lie in the composi- 
 tion of the garden soil, which by previous culture and ma- 
 nuring had become so rich in these substances, that the rel- 
 atively small addition of mineral manures, completely 
 vanished in comparison with the quantity already in the 
 soil. This led mo to the purchase of the mentioned field, a 
 sand-pit east of the city, which I found distinguished from 
 all other land in the vicinity by its almost perfect incapacity 
 to support the ordinarily cultivated plants; I do not believe 
 IS 

that in an entire year so much grass and fodder grew upon 
 it as would sustain a single sheep. 

The soil is in part a loose sand; in part it consists of ;t 
 more or less coarse quartz gravel, with some strips of sand, 
 and a littlo clay. 

I filled a number of flower-pots with this soil, sowed there- 
 in rye, barley and red clover, and added single mineral nu- 
 tritive substances to the soil; none of them brought the 
 plants farther than the flower. This soil was accordingly 
 adapted to my purpose. 

Messrs. Schwarzenberg & Co. of Ringkuhl near Cassel 
 were so obliging as to prepare in their Soda-works, a quan- 
 tity of mineral manure according to given directions, and this 
 was uniformly spread over the whole field, excepting apiece 
 of vineyard of about 2000 vines, each of which received at 
 the time of planting J lb. which was mixed with the earth. 
 On separate divisions of the field were cultivated wheat, rye, 
 barley, clover, potatoes, beets, maize, and Jerusalem arti- 
 chokes; some patches received at the same time saw-dust, 
 one nothing but stable-manure, another a mixture of the 
 mineral manure with an equal quantity of stable-dung. Be- 
 side this stable-dung no other animal substance, no amino- 
 niacal manure was used on the whole field. One small plot 
 had added to it several wagon loads of soil from a forest; 
 another, received the same, mixed with the mineral-manure. 

Several of the most distinguished agriculturists of the 
 vicinity, among them M. V. Firnhaber, were of the opinion 
 that it was not possible to raise wheat or clover on this soil, 
 and I have in memory, to this day, the judgment these men 
 passed upon my undertaking. I had calculated for the first 
 year upon only a small yield — the soil had never been under 
 cultivation before coming into my hands — yet so moderate, 
 so bad in fact, as the crops turned out, still they exceeded 
 what I had actually expected. It would be necessary for a 
 series of years to elapse before the constituents of the ma- 
 nure could become soluble and diffuse themselves throughout 
 the soil. The barley was better on the patch manured with 
 forest-muck and mineral manure, than upon the others- On 
 the plot where saw-dust had been applied, the vegetation 
 was also heavier than elsewhere. The plot manured with 
 stable-dung and mineral-manure, gave a wheat crop equal 
 to any in the neighborhood By the action of the saw-dust, 
 of the organic matters of the forest-soil and of the stable- 
 manure, I was first enlightened as to the actual operation of 
 humus, and the decaying organic matters of the soil (vido 
 prop. 14] and found my former views corrected and enlargod. 
 The yield of turnips, clover and potatoes, did not, however, 
 suffice for keeping one cow. Only the rye and a part of the- 
 potatoes were removed from the farm; everything else was 
 consumed on it. I may hereafter, perhaps, come to notico 
 the particulars of these experiments, and here will only re- 
 mark, that, without the addition of any more manure, all 
 the crops stood better in the second year and yielded far 
 more produce, and that this productiveness so increased, 
 that in the fourth year it excited tho wonder of all who had 
 known the original condition and character of the field 

Four years after beginning these experiments, I had op- 
 portunity to show my little farm to the Privy Counsellor, v. 
 Beckedorf, President of the Prussian College of Rural 
 Economy of Berlin, and to tho State Counsellor Renning, 
 who, in his official capacity at Dresden, exerts such a happy 
 iniluenco on the Agriculture of Saxony, and remember with 
 satisfaction tho active interest these gentlemen manifested 
 in my experiments. In 1849, my former gardener. Kappes, 
 purchased the whole field, and the industrious man, who 
 could not afford to buy manure, manages with profit the now 
 well-conditioned little farm ; assisted, during the aumintr 
 months, bv a little business in selling refreshments, he is
