are too grand for use. The carpet is too fine for their hus- 
 bands to walk on — the mirrors are too fine for him to look 
 into — the furniture is all too fine for hiin to see or use. — 
 Just so it goes — we dress, we women, I mean, and I am 
 sorry that many men are as foolish as we are, to please others, 
 or rather to excite their remarks — we build houses, and 
 furnish them for those outside of the family, and live as poor- 
 ly when we are rich as we did when we were poor ; as poorly 
 in the new house as in the old. 

It is a fatal day to enjoyment when a family gets a house 
 and furniture too fine for use ; and yet most woman have an 
 ambition to have it so. Better would it be if they were con- 
 tented with such a house and such furniture as is suited to 
 every day use — the house large enough to accommodate 
 one's friends, and the furniture such as all use when at 
 home. Rose Random. 

Wheat Growing. 
 Pennsylvania contains some of the largest wheat growing 
 districts in the Union. The aggregates of the following 
 counties, as stated in the census of 1850, are unequalled by 
 anything at the West or South, viz: — Lancaster, 1,365,111; 
 Franklin, 837,062; Westmoreland, 668,476. The largest 
 wheat growing counties of Ohio are thus reported in the 
 census :— Stark, 598,594; Wayne, 571,377; Coshocton, 416,- 
 918; Muskingum, 415,847; Seneca, 474,737. Lancaster, 
 Pa., it will be perceived is one of the chief agricultural won- 
 ders of the country, and the Ohio districts are far inferior to 
 the production of ours, of which the following are those 
 lying along the ro ites of our various railways: — Lancaster, 
 1,365.111 bushels; Franklin, 837,062; Berks, 577,668; Ches- 
 ter, 547,498; Cumberland, 487,182; Bucks, 403,969 ; York, 
 578,828; Centre, 433,612; Union, 353,095; Huntingdon, 
 365,278; Mifflin, 305,994 ; Montgomery, 309,255 ; Dauphin, 
 309,879; Adams, 318,842. This is exclusive of Western 
 Pennsylvania, whose chief wheat counties are stated thus : 
 Allegheny, 526,856 bushels ; Fayette, 304, 102 ; Washington, 
 558,182; Westmoreland, 668,479. Of these Allegheny, 
 Westmoreland and Washington are of course our tributaries, 
 but Fayette can only be made to continue so by the con- 
 struction of the Uniontown branch railway, as the Connells- 
 ville road, leading to Baltimore, passes through the county. 
 Of the chief wheat counties in Ohio which we have named 
 above, Stark and Wayne are along the Ohio and Pennsyl- 
 vania railway, and Coshocton and Muskingum along the 
 Steubenville and Indiana road. — North American. 

Mulching. 

Newly set trees should not be drenched in floods of water. 
 In order to have a tree live, and the same is true of many 
 garden plants, the ground should be moist, but not inundated. 
 Mulching — a covering about the roots, of half rotted leaves, 
 decaying chips, saw dust, straw, coarse hay, breaks, ferns, 
 anything that will keep the surface moist and cool, is what 
 tho newly set tree requires. The mulching should be kept 
 on till the roots have had time to heal, the rootlets to spread 
 widely in the soil, and the tree to become vigorous, all which 
 will be shown by its growth and full, rich foliage. — Nash's 
 Farmer. 

To Fatten Fowls. 
 The best food for fattening fowls is potatoes mixed with 
 meal. Boil the potatoes and mash them fine while they are 
 hot, and mix the meal with them just before it is presented. 
 They fatten on this diet in less than half the time ordinarily 
 required to bring them to tho same condition of excellence 
 on corn or even meal. — Exchange.
