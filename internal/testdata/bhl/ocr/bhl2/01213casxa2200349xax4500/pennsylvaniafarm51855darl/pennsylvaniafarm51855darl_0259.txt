Preserving Fruits. 

The following article, which we copy from Arthur's Home 
 Magazine, was intended only to refer to "Arthur's Self Seal- 
 ing Cans and Jars," and as it contains some useful hints we 
 transfer it to our pages, with the remark that the directions 
 are applicable to preserving fruit in glass bottles or any 
 other perfectly air excluding vessels, when perfectly sealed. 
 Glass bottles with wide mouths are made for the purpose, 
 and may be had at low rates at the agency of the glass 
 works:— "Arthur's Self-Soaling Cans and Jars are made with 
 a channel around the mouth, into which a cover fits loosely. 
 Into this channel a verj 7 adhesive cement is poured and 
 allowed to harden. Thus prepared for sealing, the cans and 
 jars are sold, and the housekeeper, after filling her vessels 
 and applying the heat, has only to warm the cover and press 
 it down into the cement, when the work of sealing is done. 
 These vessels can be used year after year, and, as the cover 
 goes over the whole top, may be as perfectly cleansed as 
 any other open vessel. 

As the fruit season has now commenced, housekeepers 
 should by all means try some of these cans, and prove them 
 to their own satisfaction: At small cost and trouble they 
 may now have fresh or stewed fruits or tomatoes on their 
 tables all next winter, and at summer prices. Tho method 
 of putting up fruits in this way, we will briefly give: 

Fill the can or jar with ripe fruit, adding a little sugar, sim- 
 ply enough to render the fruit palatable, and set in a vessel 
 of water, (warm or cold.) Let the water boil, and continue 
 boiling until tho fruit is well heated through — say for half 
 an hour. Directions have been given simply to let the water 
 boil, but such direction is defective, as at this time the fruit 
 in the centre of the vessel will be scarcely warmed. Should 
 the vessel be then sealed, fermentation will take place. The 
 heat must thoroughly penetrate the contents of the vessel. 
 As soon as the fruit is sufficiently heated, warm the cover, 
 press it into its place, and the work is done. 

Another way is to make a syrup of two pounds of sugar 
 for every six pounds of fruit, using half a pint of water for 
 every pound of sugar. Skim the syrup as soon as it boils, 
 and then put in your fruit and let it boil ten minutes. Fill 
 the cans or jars, and seal up hot. Some make a syrup of 
 half a pound of sugar to every pound of fruit — and some 
 only use a quarter of a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit — 
 while some use no sugar fit all. 

To keep peaches, pare and cut them up. If thrown into 
 cold water they will retain their firmness and color. Heat 
 them in the cans or jars as above — or boil them ten minutes 
 in a syrup. In this way, strawberries, raspberries, cherries, 
 plums, peaches, <fec, Ac., may be kept for any length of time 
 in the same condition that they were when sealed up, and 
 with the flavor unchanged. For small fruit it is best to make 
 a syrup without water, and boil the fruit in it for only a few 
 minutes. 

Fresh stewed fruits of all kinds may be kept in these ves- 
 sels. It will only be necessary to stow the fruit for the table, 
 adding the amount of sugar required to make it palatable ; 
 fill up the vessel with the hot fruit, and seal at once. All 
 ripe fruit preserved in this way will bo found as fresh in the 
 winter season as if just taken from the tree and stewed. 

Tomatoes. — Take off the skin; put them in a preserving 
 kettle or other convenient vessel, and boil them for a quar- 
 ter of an hour. Fill the cans or jars, and seal them up 
 hot. 

The best soil for the strawberry was stated to be a gravelly 
 loam. , The laud should be well drained, and to every acre 
 apply twenty bushels of unleached ashes, ten bushels of lime, 
 and two or three pounds of salt. The ground should be well 
 broken up, animal manures should bo eschewed; leaf is the 
 best, and this should be carefully spaded in. About the first 
 of July is the best time to set out the plants. In doing 
 this, pains should be taken to have them firmly rooted. The 
 roots should be eighteen inches apart. 

Sometimes it will be well to allow greater interval, in 
 which case the interstices can be filled up from the growth 
 of the runners. After setting out the plants, throw on a 
 covering of tan bark an inch or an inch and a half in depth, 
 then water them plentifully, and the moisture will be re- 
 tained a long time. After cold weather comes on, cover the 
 strawberry beds and the walks with clean straw, throwing 
 over a little brush, or something to keep the straw in its 
 place. In the spring remove the straw and make use of 
 some fertilizing agent to give the plants vigor, as sulphate 
 of soda, sulphate of ammonia, or nitrate of potash. Keep 
 the roots out, see that the plants are bountifully watered, 
 and let nothing intervene to disturb or retard their growth 
 till you gather the fruit. The beds should be made over as 
 often as every three years. 

The Olive Tree in the South. 
 R. Chisolm has written a letter to the Charleston Mercury 
 (S. C.,) in which he states that he has cultivated two kinds 
 of the olive for ten years, and that its fruit ripens fully in 
 the low countries of the South. Ho ha« now three hundred 
 trees under cultivation, but he believes that it cannot be cul- 
 tivated at present for the sake of its oil, as cotton is a more 
 profitable crop. — Scientific American.

Tho California Fine. 
 R. Lawson of Edingburgh, Scotland — a distinguished 
 forester — says of the California pine (P. insignis) ; "this 
 beautiful tree soon towers above those which have been 
 planted many years before, and when the forests of Califor- 
 nia supply us with its cones on more moderate terms, it will 
 probably become the staple pine of our forests.' - — Scientific 
 American. 

I. J. Mechi's Annual Meeting of Agriculturists, 
 At Tiptree Hall, Kelvedon, Essex, takes place on the 
 2Sth of July, instant. — We have received an invitation to 
 attend; and also invitations for gentlemen who may visit 
 England. If any of our friends should be visiting Eng- 
 land, and desire to attend this interesting meeting, if they 
 will address us, we will furnish them with the necessary 
 papers. — Journal N. Y. State Ay. Society.

Imported Cattle. 
 Hon. Charles Hufinagle, M. D., the American Consul to 
 Calcutta, India, has imported several fine cattle and some 
 Shetland ponies, which are now grazing on a farm near New 
 Hope, Pa. Several more are on the way and expected to 
 arrive daily. He is also expecting a fine pair of Arabian 
 horses by the next arrival, his object being the improvement 
 of the herd of cattle and horses in this country.— Exchange. 

Culture of Strawberries. 
 The New York Horticultural Society, at a recent conver- 
 sational meeting, arrived at the following conclusions in 
 regard to the best method of cultivating strawberries: 

Cabbages for Cows. 
 The editor of the Agricultural Gazette (Eng.) estimates 
 one acre of cabbages to be worth three acres of turnips for 
 cows. He recommends sowing seed in beds, either in au- 
 tumn or spring, and transplanting towards the end of May 
 at the rate of 8.000 plants to the acre. One pound of seed 
 will produce about 2,400 plants.
