 Vegetable Structures. — The earth is a great store- 
 house, constantly producing vegetable substances, -which, 
 by undergoing various transformations, are rendered 
 capable when returned to the soil, of conferring greater 
 fertility than that of which their growth deprived it. 
 Every farm, to a greater or less extent, according to the 
 richness of its soil, produces neglected vegetable 
 structures. All of these contain a large amount of 
 carbon, principally collected from the atmosphere ; but 
 if they are allowed to die and rot on the surface, this 
 carbon is not preserved in the soil to promote the growth 
 of other plants, but, to a great extent, is lost to the 
 farmer by dissipation into the atmosphere. On the 
 other hand, if such plants are carefully collected toge- 
 ther, and moderately fermented along with substances 
 calculated to absorb the gases liberated during ferment- 
 ation, they become really and truly potent fertilisers. 
 All kinds of grasses, ferns, nettles, hedge-twigs, leaves, 
 or other herbs, either gathered in fields and plantations, 
 or removed as refuse matter from cattle stalls, are of 
 great value to the agriculturist as manures. They ought 
 to be gathered together carefully, and nothing will pay 
 better than the labour bestowed in so doing. There are 
 several ways in which such substances may be prepared 
 for use in the field. The most simple, and perhaps the 
 most pi-ofitable method is the following : — In the summer 
 months, from the time the herbage is rank enough to be 
 worth collecting, it should be gathered together and laid 
 down somewhere convenient to the manure-yard of the 
 farm. A receptacle should be in readiness, say six feet 
 wide, two to three feet deep, and a greater or less 
 length, according to the quantity of matter to be pre- 
 pared in it. This pit may simply be dug out of the soil 
 of a field, or a vacant piece of ground, for the time 
 being. Into the bottom a layer of all the various kinds 
 of herbage mixed together, say twelve or fifteen inches 
 thick, may now be put ; over it should next be spread 
 of layer of well-broken dried peat, about six inches 
 thick. As the herbage will be lying loose, a good deal 
 of peat will find its way downwards and be mixed with 
 it ; but the six inches should be irrespective of this. A 
 layer of lime-shells, from four to six inches thick, should 
 then be added, and covered over with a six inch coating 
 of peat. Then comes another layer of green herbage, 
 from one to two feet thick, according to circumstances; a 
 layer of peat, lime, peat herbage, and so on alternately, 
 till the heap is the height which may be wished. 
 It should be completed in the form of a potato-pit ; and 
 to prevent the loss of gaseous substances, liberated 
 during fermentation, it must be covered over with four 
 or five inches of soil, or earthy matter. In a few days, 
 fermentation will be in full action, and it will now 
 become necessary to guard against the compound being 
 made too dry by the fermenting process, or what is 
 termed "fire-fanged." Of this there is comparatively 1 
 little danger, if the moss be close enough to, or mixed 
 sufficiently with the lime, for it will require all the heat 
 evolved by the latter to promote fermentation in the for- 
 mer. After a few weeks, as will be indicated by the 
 partial falling-in of the heap, or may be ascertained by 
 examination, the contents will need to be turned. Of 

course, if the fermentation is very intense, it will be 
 necessary to turn sooner, and by mixing the substances 
 together, gradually lay the heat. After the mass has 
 lain for a month or two it may be turned again ; 
 and this time it should be well drenched with uruie, or 
 other liquid manure from the tanks. The quantity of 
 caustic lime present will not be sufficient to dissipate 
 ammonia of the urine ; but even should it do this, the 
 earth and moss will absorb it. Nay, the presence of 
 lime, if not in too large quantity, will be of great ad- 
 vantage in producing a nitrate of lime. As the am- 
 monia of the urine and nitrogen of the peat become 
 oxidised by the oxygen of the liberated carbonic acid of 
 the vegetable structures, and form nitric acid, lime, if 
 present, becomes the base of a nitrate. For the pro- 
 duction of a nitrate of soda, it will also be found of ad- 
 vantage to strew a quantity of chloride of sodium (com- 
 mon salt) over each layer, as the heap is being formed. 
 As the compound is turned over, and the salt comes into 
 contact with the lime, soluble chloride of calcium is 
 formed. Then, as the nitrogen of the moss, and am- 
 monia of the urine, are brought within the reach of the 
 soda, the soluble nitrate of soda is produced. 

Thus, then, almost no loss, but a certain profit, will 
 follow the application of urine, or other tank liquid, to 
 such composts. After the first turning of the heap, a 
 fresh covering of soil should be laid over the surface, to 
 prevent escape of any of the gases which are being 
 produced in the process of decomposition. When the 
 compound has lain in this state for a month or so, and 
 has received several dressings of liquid manure, it may 
 be turned for the last time. During this operation, if the 
 contents seem to be less moist than could be wished, a 
 moderate dressing of tank liquid should again be applied. 
 In this state, the compost may either be used immedia- 
 tely, or at the distance of many months, as may seem 
 advisable. When the ammoniacal liquor of gas-works 
 can be obtained, it may be moderately used instead of 
 liquid manure. In either case the action is the same, if 
 the mixture is properly prepared. By the formation of 
 composts of this nature, a large quantity of valuable 
 manure may be made during the yeat - , even on the 
 smallest farms. 

True, the operation involves a good deal of labour and 
 attention ; but if these diminish the annual outlay for 
 foreign manures, they will be amply remunerated. 
 Nothing is got without either money or work ; and if it 
 is possible to prepare home-manures without a serious 
 loss of labour, the convenience afforded by their being 
 at hand ready for use will, in many cases, render them 
 cheaper than distant fertilisers, though obtained at al- 
 most any price. But how little labour does the prepar- 
 ation of compost heaps really give to the farmer in 
 many cases? In no department of farm work are the 
 advantages of good management more strikingly appar- 
 ent than in the accumulating and preparing of composts. 
 A farmer or overseer destitute of method, who never 
 knows the next work to set his men to till they come a 
 quarter of a mile to ask his bidding, or who has men 
 often doing work out of season, or which might have 
 been as well undone, is not likely to have many compost- 
 heaps. By mismanagement he squanders more of bis 
 own and his servants' time, than would be necessary to
