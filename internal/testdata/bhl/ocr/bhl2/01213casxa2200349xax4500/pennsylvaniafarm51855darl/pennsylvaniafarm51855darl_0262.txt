Allen's Mowing Machine. 
 Our Reporter expressed himself very sorry that in 
 his report of the trial of mowers published in our last 
 he over looked transcribing from his note book the oper- 
 ation of Allen's Mowing Machine, manufactured and 
 entered by R. L. Allen of New York. The following is 
 the report of that operation which should have been 
 published in our last: â€” "The machine next entered was 
 Allen's, wood frame with two sets of gears ; weight 
 nboui six hundred pounds, cutter two and three-quar- 
 ters inches long, and vibrating with about the same 
 *peed as Ketch urn's. Trial, first cut, cut well but car- 
 ried the grass with it until quite a quantity had accum- 
 nlated on the guard bar ; then cut rather long until the 
 accumulation of grass fell over back of the bar; then 

cut excellently again till the grass a second time ac- 
 cumulated; then cleared itself as before and got to the 
 end of the field before a third accumulation was large 
 enough to cause a third interruption. The frame- 
 work and gearing of this machine seemed to us to be in 
 design the best on the field. There is but little prob- 
 ability of the driver being tired ; and (such is the ex- 
 cellent manner in which the gears are arranged and 
 covered) no possibility of his being hurt. We confess 
 we expected to see this mower work the best of any on 
 the grounds ; and think that our disappointment must 
 have been caused by some unseen imperfection in the 
 work by the manufacturer taken in connection with a 
 want of knowledge of the operation of a mowing machine 
 evinced by the exhibitors. 

DANIEL'S HAY AftD FODDER CUTTER. 

The above cut gives a fair representation, of a hay, 
 straw and fodder cutter, patented in 1850 and 1853, 
 but not much known in Pennsylvania, previous to last 
 season. We have heard those who have used them in 
 this vicinity speak of them in the highest terms, as 
 equally adapted for hay, straw and corn fodder, cut- 
 ting with great rapidity, being strongly made, and sim- 
 ple in arrangement. 

All our information goes to prove a decided deficiency 
 in the hay ci-op, at least in the eastern section of Pennsyl- 
 vania, New hay has recently been selling in Philadel- 
 phia at $22 per ton, and last year's crop at $28. Under 
 such circumstances, economy is a matter of necessity, 
 and in respect to a saving between feeding it whole, and 
 cutting, we known of but one opinion where any fair ex- 
 periment has been made. A multitude of certificates as 
 to the advantages of cut hay and straw can be obtained 

both in the Uuited States and England, from the most 
 practical and experienced farmers. 

The question of which is the best cutter, has been 
 almost as difficult to answer, as which is the best Reap- 
 ing and Mowing machine, which the best Bee Hive, or 
 the best Cooking Stove. The inventive genius of the 
 country, has been fully turned to these different matters 
 as is evidenced by the great accumulation of patents. 
 We know of many farmers, who have tried Daniel's Hay 
 Cutter, and consider it the cutter. Their construction is 
 such, that they sharpen themselves, by turning the set 
 screws, and pi'essing the stationary blade slightly against 
 the revolving blades. If to the edges of the revoling 
 blades a small quantity of oil and emory is applied, and 
 the motion of the cylinder reversed, until the knives 
 wear themselves sharp the machine is put in perfect 
 cutting order. The feed roller is of the most complete
