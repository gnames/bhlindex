NORTH DEVON BULL FRANK QUARTLY. 
 We present our readers with the following well ex- 
 ecuted engraving of the superior North Devon Bull, 
 Frank Quartly, marked in Davy's Devon Herd book 
 205, imported and now owned by L. G. Morris, Mount 
 Forham, New York. "Frank Quartly" gained the 
 first prize at the New York State Agricultural show in 
 1853 as a two year old, ditto at the American Insti- 
 tute in 1853, also, the first prize at the New York State 
 Show in 1854. He was calved in March 1851. His sire 
 was Earl of Exeter (38), grandsire Baronet (6), dam 
 Curly (96), by Favourite (43), grandam Pretty Maid 
 (366), great grandam Curly, great, great grandam Old 
 Curly. Curly and herdam were esteemed by Mr. Francis 
 Quartly two of the best cows he ever bred. The Devon 
 breed of cattle is well deserving of extensive introduc- 
 tion, and we are pleased that some of our prominent 
 farmers in Pennsylvania, own animals of as pure blood and 
 fine quality, as are to be found in the country. We hope 
 to have an opportunity of seeing them, at some of our 

approaching exhibitions. For oxen, the Devon's are un- 
 rivalled, they are also fair milkers, and fatten kindly. Davy 
 in his preface to the Herd book, (which by the way every 
 breder of Devons should own a copy of), says as follows, 
 in relation to breeding. 

It certainly is advantageous to the purchaser of an 
 animal (after he has made a selection), to be able to 
 refer to the Herd Book, and see if his parents are good. 
 We know that animals descended from well-bred parents- 
 are likely to produce more perfect offspring than others 
 not so carefully bred. 

The object of improved breeding is to diminish, or, if 
 possible, to remove the defects of live stock, and to ac- 
 quire and perpetuate desirable properties. The general 
 art is to make such a selection of males and females as 
 are most likely to promote the object ; paying particu- 
 lar attention to a maxim which is too frequently forgot- 
 ten — the governing law of the animal kingdom — that like 
 produces like ; that the good or bad properties of the 
 parents are hereditary, and are almost invariably impar- 

ted to their progeny. We know that some animals fat- 
 ten faster than others, and that they are generally more 
 handsomely formed. On handling them, we find the skin 
 and parts beneath are soft and "mellow." This "mellow- 
 ness" is a kind of softness and elasticity perceived upon 
 pressing the skin, and is a very favorable sign of the 
 aptitude of an animal to fatten. These parts are the 
 cellular membranes, which in fat animals are full of 
 fat ; and store stock possessing this mellow feeling, de- 
 notes that there are plenty of membranous cells ready 
 for the reception of fat. To breed cattle possessing 
 this mellow feeling is an important object ; for an ani- 
 mal is almost valueless though it be possessed of per- 
 fect symmetry, if it cannot be made fat without very 
 extraordinary keep. 

The object of a breeder should be to get as little bone 
 as possible ; large round leg bones indicate a coarse an- 
 imal, whereas flat and small bones are symptoms of be- 

ing well bred. It is higlily desirable that there should 
 not be excess in one part and a deficiency in another ; 
 but that an animal should lay on fat on every point in 
 equal proportions, taking care to get as much as possi- 
 ble in those parts where it is most valuable : for instance 
 it is of more value on the loins, ribs, and rumps, than 
 on the neck or hocks ; therefore, breadth of the loin, 
 length of the rump, rotundity of frame, a good deep 
 chest, and shoulders placed obliquely, that there may be 
 no hollowness behind them, are indispensable qualities 
 in a good formed animal ; and I believe our best Devons 
 possess these requirements in a greater degree than any 
 other breed of cattle. 

Dr. Anderson gives the following rhythmical enume- 
 ration of the qualities and shape of the cow : 
 She's long in her face, she's fine in her horn, 
 She'll quickly get fat without cake or corn ; 
 She's clean in her jaws, she's full in her chine. 
 She's heavy in flank, and wide in her loin ;
