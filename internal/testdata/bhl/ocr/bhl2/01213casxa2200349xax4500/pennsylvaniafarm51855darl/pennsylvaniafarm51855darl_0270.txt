any previous year; of wheat alone it is estimated at 
 sixty millions of bushels, which is thought by many far 
 too low. 

To understand properly the cause of this immense 
 increase of production, it should be remembered not 
 only tnat the whole country has been blessed with abun- 
 dant rain, but that under the stimulus of high prices, 
 an extra amount of ground was plowed up aud seeded. 
 It is stated that at Syracuse, N. Y., Potatoes are already 
 contracted for at fifteen cents per bushel ; on the whole 
 we expect a general fall in prices the coming fall, which 
 will stimulate trade and business by the abundant sup- 
 ply of the raw material, or true basis on which all trade 
 must rest.

The Usefulness of Toads. 
 Toads feed on all kinds of worms, and should never be 
 killed in gardens. The canker worm is a favorite food with 
 them; they are useful in destroying all kinds of garden 
 grubs. — Scientific American. 

Gold Fish. 
 It is true that the gold fish has become naturalised in the 
 Schuykill above Philadelphia, or rather perhaps wo should 
 say in the Fairinount dam — a distance of wiles. They were 
 introduced by the breaking of a fish pond many years ago. 
 The boys offer them for sale in winter of a large size, and fit 
 for stocking your lake, at from ten to fifty cents each. There 
 are hundreds of natural lakes and artificial dams where they 
 would multiply enormously. Last winter, while construc- 
 ting some dams on a small stream of spring water which 
 empties into the Schuylkill, wo requested the Irish laborers 
 to purchase any gold fish that might be offered, and place 
 them in the dams. A few days only elapsed before the works 
 were completed, and on taking a viow of them our intelligent 
 superintendent related the following adventure. The cold 
 had been intense, and had frozen the river to an unusual 
 depth ; the gold fishes, big and littlo, repaired to the mouth of 
 our little stream in great numbers, probably for the greater 
 warmth of the water; the freshet having meantime subsided, 
 the man went to the river to see its effects, when lo ! the iee 
 had fallen and had caught in a trap at the creek's mouth, 
 ten dozen fine large "goldies," which were taken by the hand, 
 filing a large washing tub, and thus our new water was 
 stocked at once. — Horticidturist. 

Improved Varieties of Wheat from France. 

There have lately been imported three varieties of wheat : 
 The Hungarian wheat; the Neapolitan white wheat, and the 
 early Noe wheat. As the two latter have the property of 
 ripening some days before our common varieties of wheat, 
 if they otherwise succeed in this climate, a great point will 
 be accomplished. A single week gained in the ripening 
 will often secure the crop from the injury of the rust, inde- 
 pendent of the advantage gained in the market. The Sau- 
 mer wheat is originally from the valley of Anjou, a south- 
 eastern province of France, and is a very remarkable variety 
 of Winter wheat. The ear is strong and full, of a reddish 
 color, and is very much esteemed by farmers. The straw 
 is very white, and grows higher than that of ordinary wheat, 
 while it is larger and sweeter. The Noe wheat was intro- 
 duced by Mr. De Noe, and is commonly known under the 
 name of blue wheat, and owing to its hardy and protective 
 nature, is gradually superseding the Saumer wheat in the 
 central parts of France. It is much sought after on account 
 of its precocity for a meslin or soiling crop. It would suc- 
 ceed well as a March wheat if sown early. 

Pleasures of Planting. 

Where shall we find so pleasing an appreciation of the 
 pleasures that attest the lover of a garden, as in the follow- 
 ing extract of a letter from the venerable Dr. Fothergill : 

"Planting and gardening supply a fund of entertainment, 
 the most lasting and reasonable of any occupation in this 
 life, pleasures not to be purchased. The trees which we 
 ourselves have planted, the fruits we have raised, the plants 
 we have cultivated, seem to be like our children, a kind of 
 new creation. Their shade, their taste, their fragrance, and 
 their beauties, affect us with a richer repast than any other. 
 What a pleasing scene lies open to a young man of fortune 
 devoted to such amusements ! Each succeeding year pro- 
 duces new shades, other fruits, fresh beautios, and brings 
 besides more profit. To behold the rising groves, barren- 
 ness made fertile, our country improved, ourselves made use- 
 ful and happy, and posterity enriched ! I have seldom known 
 a man possessed of a taste for such pleasures, who was not 
 at the same time temperate and virtuous." — IFortictdtv-
