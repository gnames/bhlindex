wash fresh butter, we wash away the part that is essentia! 
 to its richest flavor and to its preservation. No water should 
 be put into the churn, and none used in the process of work- 
 ing. 

The butter should be taken from the churn with a wooden 
 ladle ; should be worked with the same ; whon nearly all the 
 buttermilk is worked out, pure fine salt should be added, it 
 should be salted to the taste. More salt than is requisite to 
 gratify the average taste for this article, has no tendency to 
 preserve butter, but rather the reverse, unless the salt is ab- 
 solutely pure, which seldom happens. Most salt contains a 
 little lime and a littlo magnesia ; and when this is the case, 
 any more than enough to salt to the taste, not only gives the 
 butter a bitter flavor, but actually hastens its putrefaction. 
 It is very important that the best of salt, as pure as can be 
 obtained should be used for butter. 

I will here lay down a. rule by which the dairyman can tell 
 whether his salt is sufficiently pure for this purpose. To 
 eight lbs. of salt, in a clean wooden vessel, add one pint of 
 boiling water; let it stand an hour; pour it upon a thick 
 strainer, and let the water pass into another vessel. The 
 lime and magnesia, if any were present, have passed through 
 in the water together with a part of the salt — possibly a 
 quarter of the whole. What remains on the strainer is near- 
 ly pure salt. Let that which has fallen into the vessel be put 
 into the catties' trough. There need be no waste if all the 
 salt used in a dairy were thus washed. Now, with washed 
 salt, let a lump of butter be salted; and let another, from 
 the same churning, be salted with some of the same salt 
 unwashed. If the latter have a bitter taste, from which the 
 former is free, you may conclude that the salt contains lime, 
 or magnesia, or more probably both; and that the whole 
 should be washed, as above described, before being used for 
 butter, or else its place should be supplied by purer salt. 

Many a pasture has been blamed for producing bitter 
 weeds, when all the bitterness was in the salt. The pasture 
 was well enough, but the salt manufacturer could make half- 
 purifled salt cheaper than pure. 

We have said that all the butter milk must be worked out. 
 This is true, but it is liable to be misunderstood. What is 
 buttermilk ? It is water with fine particles of curd, a very 
 little oil, and a little milk-sugar in it. The particles of curd 
 give it a whitish appearance. Now, the butter must be 
 worked till this whitish appearance has ceased, but not till 
 the last drop of liquid has left it. The best butter in the 
 world is full of fine particles of a transparent liquid. It would 
 not be best to work, these out if you could, for the butter 
 would then become tough and waxy. More butter is dam- 
 aged by not working it enough, but much is damaged by 
 working it too much. The dairy-woman should watch the 
 complexion of what flows from the butter as she works it. 
 When this becomes perfectly transparent, limpid, like pure 
 water, with not tho least whitish appearance, the operation 
 should cease at once, for whatever is taken out after that is 
 a damage and not a benefit to the butter. It is not butter- 
 milk, it is water, with a little salt and sugar dissolved in it, 
 and is an essential part of good butter. 

I have used firkin butter from Madison County, N. Y., 
 nearly a year old, which was as fragrant and as sweet as new 
 made butter; and on examining it with a microscope, I have 
 found it full of exceedingly fine globules of a transparent 
 liquid. Il rubbed with a knife-blade, these would run to- 
 gether and form drops, as limpid as spring-water. Could 
 they have been analyzed, I have no doubt they would have 
 been found to contain salt, water and sugar, but no curd. 
 Had they contained the least curd, it would have putrefied, 
 and would have spread putridity, offensive to taste and smell 
 throughout the whole mass. 

I have beforo stated that the nitrogene'ous substances, curd 
 (caseine), gluten (as the tough stringy part of wheat-flour) 
 and albumen (as in eggs), are quick to putrefy, and that they 
 always act as yeast, to spread putrefaction. It is on this 
 principle that a particle of curd in butter will create and 
 spread putrefaction all about it. The sugar of milk contained 
 in these transparent globules of liquid is conservative; the 
 salt dissolved in them is conservative, if it be really pure salt; 
 but the curd, if thero be any, is destructive. Tho true idea 
 therefore of working out all tho buttermilk, is, to work out all 
 the curd, and there to stop, and not go on and work out all 
 the life and flavor and conservative principle of butter, leav- 
 ing it as some do, little else than a mass of dry wax. — Nash. 

Compost Heaps. 
 (Continued from Page 246.) 

Take any of our ordinary policy-gronuds studded with de- 
 ciduous trees and clumps, autumn after autumn strewing the 
 ground with decayed umbrageous leaves, which both earth 
 and air helped to produce, and what an amount of manure is 
 here provided for the soil ! These leaves, ifgathered together 
 immediately after their fall, and watered and fermented in a 
 pit covered over with soil, either alone or compounded with 
 other substances, like green herbage, will produce a most 
 valuable fertilizing agent. In plantations, too, the leaves 
 may not only be collected in autumn but during the sum- 
 mer every description,of rank vegetable matter should be 
 cut, and removed to the fermenting pit. Amongst young 
 trees, the cleaning of the surface and preventing their being 
 choked will increase their growth, and render the cutting of 
 the herbage remunerative, without even making any allow- 
 ance for it as a manure. Just set a man with a scythe and 
 rake into any of our luxuriant plantations, whether youug 
 or old, and if he does not, by ordinary labor, pay double his 
 wages, it will indeed be very surprising. In many alluvial 
 spots a cart-load of ferns or other rank vegetables may be 
 gathered in an hour or two. From such places, also, how 
 very frequently might a large quantity of valuable soil be 
 obtained for composts. 

On many of the swarded avenues, rides and walks about 
 gentlemen's seats, the grass is frequently cut and thrown out 
 of the way, or given to some person at a low price, or for the 
 cutting While perfectly aware of the necessity for the herb- 
 age on such places being kept short, and of the labor entail- 
 ed in securing this end, I do think that, by regarding it as 
 a manure, something more might be made of it than is gene- 
 rally the case. Careful attention to such available manures 
 is no new theory, but one which, from being long neglect- 
 ed, seems almost new in practice. 

The Greeks and Romans, immediately preceding and fol- 
 lowing the Christian era, were very attentive to the collect- 
 ing and preserving of every substance capable of being con- 
 verted into manure. "You may make manure," says Catg 
 "of these things, stubble, lupines, straw, bean-stalks, chaff, 
 haulm, and oak-leaves. From the cornfield pull out dwarf 
 elder hemlock, and all the tall grass and reeds in the willow 
 plantations, and lay them below the sheep and cows." Col- 
 umella also remarks, "I am not ignorant that there are somo 
 farms in the country in which neither the dung of cattle or 
 of birds is to be got . However, even in such places, he is a 
 slothful husbandman that has no manure. He may collect 
 any kind of leaves, the cuttings of briers and rakings of high- 
 ways ; he may cut ferns, which, though on the fields of his 
 neighbors, will bo rather an advantage than an injury to him, 
 and mix with the cleanings of the court-yard ; he may dig a 
 hollow place, such as we directed to be done for the dunghill, 
 and throw it into ashes, the dirt of the kennels and jakes, 
 all kinds of straw, and everything that is swept from the
