Belle Lucrative is, in my opinion, almost perfection ; and 
 if required to choose between it and the Seekel, I should, 
 Without hesitation, make choice of the former. Its fine size, 
 (we had specimens nearly three inches in diameter,) produc- 
 tiveness, exquisite flavor, and the beauty of the tree, render 
 it one of the most desirable varieties, even in the smallest 
 collection. " Best." September. 

Belle Epine Dumas, a medium-sized, pyriform, greenish 
 fruit, we have fruited under the names of Epine Dumas and 
 Duke of Bordeaux. It has no very striking points of excel- 
 lence, although it has had a good reputation. It has a sin- 
 gular habit of sometimes bearing a cluster of imperfect, de- 
 formed fruit, on the end of the current year's growth, which 
 of course never mature. This I have also occasionally no- 
 ticed in the Duchcsse d' Angouleme, and some others, but it 
 seems to be a fixed habit with this variety. "Good." 

Beurre Did is a beautifully formed fruit of the largest 
 size. I have eaten specimens which were " very good " in- 
 deed, but this season it was not so fine as usual, whether 
 from the large size of the specimens, or some othor cause, I 
 am unable to say. I consider it, however, "very good." 
 October. 

Brown Bcnrre, although when in perfection it has scarcely 
 a superior, is very uncertain. I think that it requires high- 
 er cultivation than any other variety that I know, and also 
 pretty severe pruning and thinning. The best specimens 
 that I have ever eaten were from a tree which had borne 
 such miserable fruit the preceding year, that it was headed 
 down severely, and grafted. The few branches which es- 
 caped the knife bore magnificent specimens — large, fair, and 
 almost rivalling the Seekel in high flavor, though of an en- 
 tirely different stamp of course. The tree was a standard, 
 of moderate size, standing on gravelly soil. This season 
 the fruit was poor, as also that from dwarfs. Generally 
 "very good." October. 

Bezi de Montigny proved, this season, "very good," con- 
 trary to its usual habit. Still, I do not consider it worthy 
 of cultivation. October. 

Beurre Langelier ripened in November, as did all our 
 winter pears, in consequence of being kept too warm, and 
 was of no value. I have eaten it before, and considered it 
 "very good." Our trees on the pear stock fruited very early 
 and abundantly, but the specimens were small. 

Beurre d' Aremberg — "very good." Its rich, vinous juico 
 oan scarcely be excelled. 

Beurre Gris d' Hirer Nouveati has more the appearance 
 of a Gray Doyenne than a Brown Beurre, as its name indi- 
 cates. It promises to be a fine pear, but did not ripen well 
 this season. 

Beurre de Ranee was worthless, notwithstanding its high 
 reputation. 

Colmar de Aremherg is a huge humbug, and utterly worth- 
 less, in my estimation, for any purpose, but to show. It 
 should be put on the rejected list. October. 

Chamowine — a most beautiful fruit, somewhat resembling 
 in form the Easter Beurre. In color a soft waxy yellow, 
 with a brilliant red cheek, but the most miserable pear that 
 I think I ever tasted. It may be better another year, but I 
 doubt it very much. October. 

ChaumonUl is exceedingly unsatisfactory. It bears pro- 
 fusely, and sometimes is very fine, but almost impossible to 
 ripen. Although a winter pear, the best that I ever ate 
 were blown off the tree in October, and were really " very 
 good ;" but at its proper season I can do nothing with it. 
 Mr. Robert Manning once stated to me that the results of 
 his experience with it were nearly similar. 

Columbia, although ripening in November, was "very 
 good" — much better than I expected — and beautiful in 

form and color, the latter a soft yellow. It has so far borno 
 very early and profusely, especially on grafts. 

Catillac I consider worthless, for I do not believe in cul- 
 tivating pears, or apples, for cooking alone. Many pears 
 are good for culinary purposes, besides being edible, at least, 
 which the Catillac, Uvedale's St. Germain, and some others, 
 are not. Beurre de Louvain I have suspected of beino- the 
 Catillac, but when genuine it is distinct. It may, I think, 
 be placed in the same category, nevertheless. 

Doyenne d' Ete did not equal my expectations. It was 
 too small, and scarcely "very good." Still it was the first 
 crop, and the second will probably bo better. August. 

Dearborn's Seedling is another "little bit" of a pear, 
 which, although very good so far as it goes, deserves to be 
 superseded by a larger one. Until we find such a variety, 
 we must, I suppose, cultivate it for its earlinoss. August. 

Dumortier — very small, and good for nothing, October. 

Duchesse d' Angouleme is a magnificent pear, and one that 
 has been much abused. I know no pear of its size, or ap- 
 proaching it, which is equal to it in quality, except some- 
 times the Beurre Diel. When a tree is overloaded, as will 
 frequently happen, unless carefully thinned, the fruit is 
 wanting both in size and quality; but it is usually "very 
 good" with us, and I have sometimes eaten it nearly equal 
 to the White Doyenne, which, in "Western New York, is no 
 faint praise for any poar. Although it is generally con- 
 demned as a standard, we grow beautiful specimens on 
 grafts on the tops of largo trees, which are not inferior in 
 flavor to those grown on dwarfs, and are frequently more 
 highly colored. October. — Horticulturist. 

United States Agricultural Society. 

By the following circular it appears the United States 
 Agricultural Society are going to hold an Exhibition at 
 Boston. The mere announcement of the fact, is sufficient to 
 indicate that it will be fully successful. Our Boston friends 
 don't undertake any thing of the kind, without first erasing 
 the word "fail" out of their dictionaries. 

A Grand National Exhibition op Stock — Horses, Cat- 
 tle, Sheep and Swine — open to competition to all the States 
 of the Union, and to the British Provinces, will be held by 
 the United States Agricultural Society, in the city of Boston, 
 on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, October 23, 
 24, 25, and 26th. 

Twenty-Thousand Dollars have been guarenteed by 
 patriotic gentlemen of Boston and its vicinity to defray the 
 expenses; the City of Boston has generously granted to the 
 Society for present use, a fine public square of fifty acres; 
 and Ten Thousand Dollars will be offered in Premiums, 
 in the various departments. 

The previous Exhibitions of this Society — at Springfield, 
 Mass., in 1853, and at Springfield, Ohio, in 1854 — were emi- 
 nently successful, and no efforts will be spared to make the 
 present Show, combining as it does, the Four Great Depart- 
 ments of Farming Stock, superior to its predecessors. 

The Premium List, with the Rules of the Exhibition will 
 bo forwarded to all who will address the President, or Sec- 
 retary, at Boston, to that-«ffect. 

It is earnestly hoped that all Breeders, and owners of 
 Fine Stock will feel it to bo a duty, as it certainly is for 
 their interest, to contribute to the Show. 

The List of Entries, Exhibitors and Award of Premiums, 
 and all the proceedings of the Exhibition will be published 
 in the Journal of the Society, for 1855. Annual Members 
 of the Society, who desire to receive the Journal, should 
 remember to renew their subscriptions.
