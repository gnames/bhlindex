peat, &c, to absorb the ammonia is not so necessary. 
 Its own tendency to rise, will cause its distribution 
 through the surrounding particles of soil, and immedi- 
 ate availability to the roots of growing crops. When 
 ploughed down, even when subsoiling was performed at 
 the same time, we have known of its effects to be per- 
 ceptible for years, and we would greatly prefer three 
 hundred pounds of it to the acre thus applied, for the 
 wheat or indeed any other crop, than double the ordi- 
 nary quantity of such exhausted, sun-dried, chaffy look- 
 ing stuff, called barn yard manure, which we have re- 
 cently seen hauled into the fields. Our practice in res- 
 pect to the application of manure, must be changed, 
 and we are glad to see each year an increase of the 
 number of farmers who are being satisfied on this point. 
 Manure should all be hauled out in the spring for the 
 corn crop, which is a gross feeder, and requires ex- 
 actly that kind of food, while the wheat crop, if it 
 requires anything, can be supplied with Guano. Better 
 crops, both of corn and wheat, and a far more improved 
 condition and fertility of ami, will result from this system. 
 An opinion is sometimes expressed that Guano impov- 
 erishes land, and such a result is said to have actually 
 occurred in many parts of Maryland and Virginia, 
 where its first effects were so remarkable, but the crops 
 have since been diminishing in quantity, till its appli- 
 cation is no longer profitable. This is easily explained. 
 The lands in those districts have long since been ex- 
 hausted by excessive cropping with corn, tobacco, &c, 
 without anything being returned. Grain crops and es- 
 pecially wheat, require nitrogenous manures, and there 
 is no form in which nitrogen can be so readily supplied 
 as in ammonia, the active principle and most important, 
 constituent, not only of Peruvian Guano, but of good 
 barn yard manure. Plants like animals require a variety 
 of food, and if their inorganic elements, such as silica, 
 potash, phosphoric acid, lime, &c, are not present in 
 the soil for chemical combination, and to form what may 
 be called the material of the plants, of course no crop 
 can result. Plants are found on analysis to contain not 
 one, but several constituents. These differ in their rel- 
 ative proportions, but are each essential to its perfect 
 growth and maturity. A long continued practice of 
 applying Guano only does not of itself impoverish, but 
 impoverishment results from depending on it alone and 
 the other necessary ingredients in the soil with which it 
 should combine, being exhausted and not being supplied. 
 The use of lime, ashes, ploughing down green crops, 
 like clover, &c, would no doubt soon bring the Guano 
 again into activity. 

To Destroy Insects. 
 fn the winged state, most small insects may either be 
 driven away by powerful odors, or killed by strong 
 decoctions of tobacco, or a wash of diluted whale-oil or 
 other strong soap. Attention has but recently been 
 called to the repugnance of all insects, to strong odor*, 
 and there is but little doubt that before a long time, it 
 will lead to the discovery of the means of preventing 
 the attacks of most insects by means of strong smelling 
 liquids or odorous substances. The moths that attack 
 furs, as every one knows, are driven away by pepper- 
 corns or tobacco, and should future experiments prove 

that at certain seasons, when our trees are most likely 
 to be attacked by insects, we may expel them by hang- 
 ing bottles or rags filled with strong smelling liquids in 
 our trees, it will certainly be a very simple and easy 
 way of ridding ourselves of them. The brown scale, a 
 troublesome enemy of the orange tree, it is stated in 
 the Gardener's Chronicle, have been destroyed by hanging 
 plants of the common chamomile among its branches. 
 The odor of the coal tar of gas works, is exceedingly 
 offensive to some insects injurious to fruits, and it has 
 been found to drive away the wire worm, and other 
 grubs that attack the roots of plants. The vapor of oil 
 of turpentine is fatal to wasps, and that of tobacco 
 smoke to the green fly. Little as yet is certainly known 
 respecting the exact power of the various smells in de- 
 terring insects from attacking trees. What we do know 
 however, gives us reason to believe that much may be 
 hoped from experiments made with a variety of power- 
 ful smelling substances. 

Tobacco water, and diluted whale-oil soap, are the two 
 most efficient remedies for all the small insects which feed 
 upon the young shoots and leaves of plants. Tobacco 
 water is made by boiling tobacco leaves, or the refuse 
 stems or stalks of the tobacco shops. A large pot is 
 crowded full of them, and then filled up with water, 
 which is boiled until a strong decoction is made. This 
 is applied to the young shoots and leaves with a syringe, 
 or, when the trees are growing in nursery rows, with a 
 common white-wash brush; dipping the latter in the 
 liquid and shaking it sharply over extremities or the 
 infested part of each tree. This, or the whale oil soap 
 suds, or a mixture of both, will kill every species of plant 
 lice, and nearly all other small insects to which young 
 fruit trees .are subject. 

The wash of whale oil soap is made by mixing two 
 pounds of this soap, which is one of the cheapest and 
 strongest kinds, with fifteen gallons of water. This 
 mixture is applied to the leaves and stems of plants 
 with a syringe, or in any other convenient mode, and 
 there are few of the smaller insects that are not destroyed 
 or driven away by it. The merit of this mixture be- 
 longs to Mr. David Haggertson, of Boston, who first 
 applied it with great success to the rose slug, and re- 
 ceived the premium of the Massachusetts Horticultural 
 Society for its discovery. When this soap cannot be 
 obtained, a good substitute may be made by turning 
 into soap, the lees of common oil casks, by the applica- 
 tion of potash and water in the usual way. 

Moths a?id other insects which fly at night are destroyed 
 in large numbers by the following mode, first discovered 
 by Victor Adouin of France. A flat saucer or vessel is 
 set on the ground in which is placed a light, partially 
 covered with a common bell glass besmeared with oil. 
 All the small moths are directly attracted by the light, 
 fly towards it, and, in their attempts to get at the light, 
 are either caught by the glutinous sides of the bell 
 glass, or fall into the basin of oil beneath, and in either 
 case soon perish. M. Adouin applied this to the de- 
 struction of the pyralis, a moth that is very troublesome 
 in the French vineyards; with two hundred of these 
 lights in a vineyard of four acres, and in a single night, 
 thirty thousand moths were killed and found dead on or 
 about the vessels. By continuing his process through
