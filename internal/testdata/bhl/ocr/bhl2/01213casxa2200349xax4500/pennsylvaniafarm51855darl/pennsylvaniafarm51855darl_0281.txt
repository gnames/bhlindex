the season, it was estimated that he had destroyed fe- 
 male moths sufficient to have produced a progeny of 
 over a million of caterpillars. In our orchards, myri- 
 ads of insects may be destroyed by lighting small bon- 
 fires of shavings, or any refuse brush ; and in districts 
 where the apples are much worm-eaten, if repeated two 
 or three nights at the proper season, this is a very effi- 
 cient and cheap mode of getting rid of the moth which 
 causes so much mischief. Dr. Harris, knowing how 
 important it is to destroy the caterpillar in the moth 
 state, has recommended flambeaux, made of tow wound 
 round a stake and dipped in tar, to be stuck in the fruit 
 garden at night and lighted. Thousands of moths will 
 find a speedy death, even in the short time which these 
 flambeaux are burning. The melon-bug may be extir- 
 pated by myriads in the same way. 

A simple and most effectual mode of ridding the fruit 
 garden of insects of every description, which we recom- 
 mend as a general extirpator, suited to all situations, 
 is the following. Take a number of common bottles, 
 the wider mouthed the better, and fill them about half 
 full of a mixture of water, molasses and vinegar. 
 Suspend these among the branches of trees, and in va- 
 rious parts of the garden. In a fortnight they will be 
 found full of dead insects, of every description not too 
 large to enter the bottles — wasps, flies, beetles, slugs, 
 grubs, and a great variety of others. The bottles must 
 now be emptied, and the liquid renewed. A zealous 
 amateur of our acquaintance, caught last season in this 
 way, more, than three bushels of insects of various kinds; 
 and what is more satisfactory, preserved his garden 
 almost entirely against their attacks in any shape. 

The assistance of Birds in destroying insects should be 
 duly estimated by the fruit-grower. The quantity of 
 eggs and insects in various states, devoured annually 
 by birds, when they are encouraged in gardens, is truly 
 surprising. It is true that one or two species of these, 
 as the ring-tail, annoy us by preying upon the earlier 
 cherries, but even taking this into account, we are in- 
 clined to believe that we can much better spare a 
 reasonable share of a few fruits, than dispense with the 
 good services of birds in ridding us of an excess of 
 insects. 

The most serviceable birds are the common sparrows, 
 the wren, the red-breast, and, in short, most of the 
 birds of this class. All these birds should be encourag- 
 ed to build nests and inhabit the fruit garden, and this 
 may most effectually be done by not allowing a gun to 
 be fired within its boundaries. The introduction of 
 hedges or live fences, greatly promotes the domesti- 
 cation of birds, as they aft'ord an admirable shelter for 
 their nests. Our own gardens are usually much more 
 free from insects than those a mile or two distant, and 
 we attribute this in part to our practice of encouraging 
 birds, and to the thorn and arbor vitas hedges growing 
 here, and which are greatly resorted to by those of the 
 feathered tribe which are the greatest enemies of the 
 insect race. 

Among animals, the toad and the bat are great insect 
 destroyers. The common bat lives almost entirely upon 
 them, and in its evening sallies devours a great number 
 of moths, beetles, weevils, etc. ; and the toad quietly 
 makes way with numberless smaller insects. — Downing. 

Comparative Value of Ox and Horse Labor. 
 The question of the comparative value of ox-labor and 
 horse -labor, however, is a very complicated and difficult 
 one; and has been keenly discussed by some of the 
 ablest continental writers on rural economy; and, even 
 when thoroughly understood and perspicaciously inves- 
 tigated, must be variously determined according to cir- 
 cumstances. Burgar says, "We must take into consid- 
 eration the amount of labor which horses and oxen can 
 perform, in a given period, if we would decide respecting 
 the one or the other. Because horses perform more in 
 the same time than oxen, and are better adapted for 
 many kinds of work; so it not rarely happens that labor 
 is carried on cheaper with horses ; a person gains more 
 in the less number of the horse-teams and the men re- 
 quired for them, compared with the greater number of 
 the ox-teams, than the cost of their keeping, and the 
 interest of the out-lying capital. If the ox-team in a 
 given time performed as much work as the horse-team, 
 it would unquestionably be cheapest to use them for all 
 the work of the farm, and quit the use of horses wholly; 
 but because oxen are much slower in drawing, and a 
 yoke of them, if they are strong and well trained, will 
 accomplish in favorable circumstances only f or £ of 
 what a good span of farm-horses will ; therefore if the 
 keeping of oxen is not unusually cheap, on account of 
 the increased number of teams and of men required to 
 take care of them, there will be greater expense with 
 oxen, than with horses." Thaer says, "Horses have an 
 undeniable preference in the following particulars: — 1. 
 They are suitable for all and every kind of work of land- 
 husbandry, in all ways and in all weathers. One, there- 
 fore, when he keeps only horses, is not obliged to choose 
 out work for them, but can use his whole team for any 
 business that occurs, and leave no part of it to stand 
 still. 2. They accomplish every kind of work more 
 rapidty, and are more constant. One can, therefore, not 
 ouly complete the work in the same time more promptly, 
 but also require a longer day's work of them. Thus the 
 waggon will accomplish more with an equal number of 
 horses than with oxen ; although with the usual draught 
 of a load they exert not more power than oxen, yet they 
 overcome by their rapidity of motion and energy, many 
 a short resistance before which oxen stand still. In 
 favour of oxen are the following : — 1. They perform 1 the 
 greater part of the works on a farm, as ploughing, and 
 the near carrying of loads, as well as horses do ; and 
 one can in a usual day's work, if they are well fed, ex- 
 pect nearly as much from them. They perform the 
 work of plowing in a certain degree better than horses. 
 2. The cost of them is considerably less. Their pur- 
 chase, on an average, is not near so high ; their harness 
 is much cheaper; their food costs much less, and con- 
 sists in such things as, on account of its transportation, 
 are not so marketable as the grain, on which horses are 
 kept. 3. What is an important particular is, that, if 
 they are well taken care of, and not too long kept at 
 work, they lessen not as much in value, but improve for 
 the most part ; so that they often sell for more than, they 
 at first cost, and thereby soon pay the interest on the 
 standing capital; whereas, on the other hand, the value 
 of the horse soon sinks to nothing, and the capital is 
 wholly exhausted. They are also subject to fewer haz-
