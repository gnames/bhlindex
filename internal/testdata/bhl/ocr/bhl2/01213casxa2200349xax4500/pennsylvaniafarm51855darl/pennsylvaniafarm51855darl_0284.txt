either in the fall after vegetable growth has ceased, 
 ■when the fibres are dead and torpid, or in early spring 
 before the season of growth has fully commenced and 
 the fibres have been renewed. Transplanting at any 
 other time is always attended with consequences more or 
 less injurious and ought never to be attempted when the 
 plant has got its growth and is beginning to put forth 
 its flowers. It has then arrived at an adult state and is 
 about to exercise its reproductive functions. At this 
 critical period of its life it is better to let it alone. 

As soon as the seed begins to germinate, the first 
 thing that we notice is the softening and swelling of its 
 envelopes ; its testa or outer covering is ruptured, and 
 the embryo elongates downwards by its radicle or young 
 root, and upwards by its plumule or young stem, lifting 
 the cotyledons or seed leaves above the earth's surface. 
 These seed leaves when exposed to the light speedily ac- 
 quire a green hue, and in dicotyledonous embryoes ulti- 
 mately assume the form of two opposite leaves, which 
 are somewhat thick and fleshy, the margin of which is 
 invariably entire, and which are so altered in appearance 
 as to be altogether different from what they were when 
 they were wrapped up within the folds of the testa. If 
 a plant has but one of these leaves it is called a mono- 
 cotyledon, if it has two, a dicotyledon. Plants that spring 
 up without these appendages are called acotyledons. 
 These latter develop not from seeds but spores, of which 
 the fern is an example. 

The cotyledonary leaves attached to the embryo con- 
 tain a store of starch, which contributes to the develop- 
 ment of the first pair of atmospheric leaves and also to 
 the extension of the root in the soil ; hence, at the end 
 of a certain time they fade and fall, having discharged 
 their allotted functions. The second pair of leaves take 
 the form peculiar to the plant and remain permanently 
 attached to its stem; as they aerate the fluid absorbed 
 into the interior of the plant by the radicles, and which 
 is called sap, much more perfectly than the cotyledonary 
 leaves did, the growth of the plant is necessarily more 
 rapid. 

It is important then to take all possible means of fa- 
 voring the growth of the second pair of atmospheric 
 leaves. As the power of absorbing food from the atmos- 
 phere and soil increases with every fresh growth of 
 leaves and fibres, and is necessarily very feeble in the 
 beginning, when the plant is in the cotyledonary stage 
 of development, it is obvious that the beds must be kept 
 carefully weeded, and where the young plants are very 
 much crowded together the feebler must be removed in 
 order to encourage the growth of such as are more vig- 
 orous. 

It is necessary also that the soil be rendered light and 
 porous. Carbonic acid is the principal constituent in 
 the organization of plants; it composes more than one- 
 half of their entire bulk. The food of plants in fact 
 mainly consists of carbonic acid. Now the atmosphere 
 is not the only source from whence they obtain it. The 
 soil also contains an immense quantity. The substance 
 called humus, which gives the dark color to soils, and is 
 known to gardeners as mould, is composed principally 
 of organic matter in a state of decay, for the most part 
 of woody fibre, which uniting with the oxygen of the 
 uir, forms carbonic acid. 

Decay, as Liebig has shown, is only a process of com- 
 bustion or slow burning. An atmosphere of carbonic 
 acid surrounds every particle of decayiug humus and in 
 proportion to its presence in soils, are they fertile or 
 otherwise. In spring before the leaves are fully devel- 
 oped, plants obtain their carbonic acid mainly from the 
 soil. By loosening the soil about the young plant, if it 
 should have become indurated, we favor the access of 
 the air, the formation of carbonic acid about the roots, 
 and consequently, the growth of the plant when it mo?t 
 needs assistance. 

Agricultural Implements. 

Ed. Farm Journal: — I have more than once been 
 tempted to address you a query in regard to the use of 
 agricultural implements, but have been deterred by 
 reasons which it is not necessary should be presented at 
 this time. For some years I have been a tolerable close 
 observer of agricultural machinery, and always an ad- 
 mirer of every thing ingenious and useful. In the'eourse 
 of my observations, I have been forcibly struck with the 
 apparent difference in the working qualities, durability, 
 &c, of machines of the same kind turned out by the 
 same manufacturer. For instance, I have seen two 
 mowing machines made by the same person, and so much 
 alike in all their parts, that the closest scrutiny was not 
 sufficient to enable me to detect the slightest difference 
 between them. These machines were purchased by two 
 farmers who were adjoining neighbors, and whose grass 
 crops were as nearly alike in quality as the two mowers. 
 As it happened they were put to work in weather decide- 
 edly favorable to both, and yet, one worked well, and 
 gave entire satisfaction to the purchaser, while the other 
 was pronounced worthless from the very word, go ! Why 
 this should be so, I could not for the life of me under- 
 stand at the time; but subsequent information revealed 
 the truth and satisfied my mind upon one point, at least, 
 which was, that farmers are as frequently to blame for 
 the failures of their machines in durability and working 
 as the builders of them. 

In the case above referred to, the owner of the ma- 
 chine which worked well was a careful and observant 
 man. His first step when about to start his machine, 
 was to examine every nut connected with the working 
 part of it, and which by getting loose could possibly in- 
 jure it. The knife had been previously examined, and 
 whetted to a fine keen edge. Every journal box was 
 well oiled and every part of the machine about which 
 there was any friction received like attention. The re- 
 sult of this care was, that the machine worked as well 
 as could have been desired. 

The course pursued by his neighbor was almost pre- 
 cisely opposite. Taking it for granted that every ma- 
 chine came from the shop in prime apple pie order, ready 
 for work, the idea of oiling, examining the nuts, or see- 
 ing to the condition of the knives, never entered his 
 mind. His horses were hitched to the machine, aud 
 with a flourish of his whip, were started off in dashing 
 style, only to be brought to a dead stand before they 
 had advanced a rod. The machine was choked, and 
 more than this, the application of the whip to the horses 
 made them give a sudden start, by which an important 
 working part was strained badly. Without a single in-
