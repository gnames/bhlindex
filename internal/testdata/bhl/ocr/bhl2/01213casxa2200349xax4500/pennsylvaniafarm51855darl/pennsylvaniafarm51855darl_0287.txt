Italian Eye Grass. 
 We have no doubt our correspondent in another col- 
 umn has made the same mistake as many others, by 
 confounding the names of English Perennial Rye Grass 
 and Italian Rye Grass. The former is much cultivated 
 and very favorably known in some sections of the United 
 States under the name of the latter. In our March num- 
 ber, pages 82 and 83, we wrote an editorial on rye grass, 
 giving some account of the different varieties most es- 
 teemed in England, and also spoke of the Italian rye 
 grass (Lolium Italicum), and how it was to be distin- 

guished from the English (Lolium Perenne), by always 
 having an awn or beard on its lower palese. 

We often hear complaints about hard botanical and 
 scientific names, but the confusion about these two 
 grasses, as well as hundreds of other matters, are a 
 striking illustration of the advantage of scientific names 
 and some botanical knowledge on the part of farmers. 
 These names being by universal consent the world over 
 in one language (Latin), have in all countries a precise 
 meaning, while common names are altogether vague and 
 uncertain. We now have a letter before us from the 
 South, enquiring about "tall sapling red clover." If 
 any of our readers can tell us what that is, we shall be 
 glad to hear from them. 

COLD VINERY. 

The above is a very correct engraving of a cold vinery 
 at Medary, the country seat of Harry Ingersoll, Esq., 
 near Philadelphia. The cultivation of grapes in cold 
 houses, without fire heat, is now attracting much atten- 
 tion. The luxury of having the most delicious varieties 
 at command, in an atmosphere under your own control, 
 without the expense of heat, or the cost of much time 
 and labor, have induced their erection, either in a cheap 
 or expensive style, in various places within the last two 
 or three years. All the advantages of the cold grapery 
 can, of course, be secured, at a much less cost than the 
 above, which is a beautiful plan, similar to one on a 
 larger scale contrived and carried out by Mr. Van Ren- 
 selaer at Clinton Point on the Hudson. It is forty-three 
 feet six inches long by eighteen feet wide, and fourteen 
 feet high.

wide by three deep. Similar houses have been offered 
 to be constructed at $10 per running foot. 

In some of our back numbers will be found various 
 articles as to the construction and management of cold 
 graperies. Those disposed to cultivate grapes in this 
 way had also better consult Downing, Allen, and other 
 writers on the subject, by which they will save them- 
 selves not only time but expense. A deal of money is 
 often lost for want of previous information and experi- 
 ence. 

New Seedling Apple. 
 We are indebted to Richard Downing, of the Great 
 Valley, near Downingtown, Chester county, for a speci- 
 men of a new seedling apple of his own raising, which 
 possesses some fine qualities. He calls it "Dick's Seed- 
 ling." It is now in good eating order, of full medium 
 size, red color, with some stripes, and of a pleasant fla • 
 vor. The number of fine early apples is yet compara- 
 tively small, and we are glad to hear of any increase in 
 the list.
