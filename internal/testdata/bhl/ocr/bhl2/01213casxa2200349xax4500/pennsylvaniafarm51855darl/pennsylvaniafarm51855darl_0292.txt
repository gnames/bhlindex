and such varieties required for his plantation is obtained. I 
 understand these objections, because they do in reality exist. 
 However, there are some intelligent amateurs who wish to 
 obtain good articles on which they can depend, and are 
 willing to pay a good price for them as a just remuneration 
 to the producer. 

Warm and early seasons accelerate the maturity of the 
 fruit on the tree, but not in the fruit-room. After a good 
 summer and warm autumn, Pears keep better, are always 
 longer in becoming fit for use than when the season is other- 
 wise, especially as regards the late sorts. After the warm 
 summers of 1834, 1838, 1841, 1844, 1848, and 1850, the Passe 
 Colmar and Beurre d'Hardenpont (Glout Morceau,) although 
 gathered in the end of September, kept till the end of De- 
 cember and January ; the Beurre Ranee, from January till 
 April and June. 

In conclusion, from what has been stated, it results that 
 the same kind of fruit cannot be gathered uniformly at the 
 same date, owing to various circumstances which influence 
 the ripening; that by successional gathering, or at intervals, 
 the proper time for different localities is best ascertained ; 
 and that, in general, all the varieties ought to be gathered 
 before their perfect maturity, which should be attained in 
 the fruit room. — London G. Chronicle. 

How to Destroy Aphides on Bedding Plants. 
 During a visit to a friend in Devonshire, about a month 
 ago, I was much struck with the appearance of his parterres, 
 then gay with various bedded plants in the best possible con- 
 dition ; all I had theretofore seen and since inspected were 
 in a very different state, the complaint of green fly being 
 general this season, even in grounds where pains and expense 
 are not spared. On inquiring how this was effected, my 
 friend informed me that he was visited like his neighbors 
 with aphides, but that, so far as regarded low-growing plants, 
 the remedy was speedy, certain, and simple ; his plan being 
 as follows. He has four slight wooden boxes without bot- 
 toms, about twenty inches deep, made to fit just within the 
 edging of the divisions of his parterre, all the divisions be- 
 ing precisely of the same size and pattern, so as to admit of 
 a box fitting either one. He places a box upon each, presses 
 down the edge, and through a hole in the end introduces 
 the spout of his fumigator, and having filled one box with 
 smoke, plugs up the hole and proceeds to another. He uses 
 dried stuff, with a mixture of tobacco, and fills four boxes 
 with each charge of his fumigator. The smoke being in- 
 jected cool, he is able to remove the box after four or five 
 hours, taking care to admit the air gradually; and ho con- 
 trives to smoke three times, or twelve divisions in the 24 
 hours, without causing the bloom to droop, as it would do, 
 and does, in fact, when he uses tobacco paper, or ignites 
 within. I saw one operation performed on the four boxes 
 in about as many minutes, and nothing could be more effec- 
 tive. Now, it has occurred to me since witnessing this that 
 we have the solution of a problem which has puzzled mo and 
 others, and that I shall be doing my fellow florists a service 
 by making it known. Hitherto it has been easy enough to 
 fumigate houses and frames, either with the fumigator or by 
 burning tobacco paper and other combustibles in them; and 
 even standard Roses I have seen fumigated by covering 
 them with an oil-skin bag distended on a parasol; and, 
 moreover, shrubs and plants of tall growth are often dusted 
 with snuff, or covered with tobacco-water or other solution, 
 all, however, tedious and uncertain operations; but to clean 
 plants, such as Verbenas, &c, pegged to the ground, has 
 hitherto been considered an impossibility. And why should 
 not this plan be applied to borders of any length? It would 
 inly l»e necessary to mark them out in equal divisions, keep- 

ing about three inches of space unplauted between each di- 
 vision, and so covering them with boxes made to fit these 
 divisions. Again, market gardeners might avail themselves 
 of the process to fumigate Strawberries; and by providing a 
 lot of old casks, with one end knocked out, and past use for 
 other purposes, to be procured very cheap at cooperages and 
 pitched over; or they could cover their shrub fruit, such as 
 Gooseberries, Currants, and Raspberries, and bring it to 
 market in such a clean state as would give it a preference, 
 ivhile they insured the crop, now often injured and some- 
 times totally destroyed by aphis and other vermin. I would 
 suggest that, when the divisions of flower parterres are cut 
 out in fanciful shapes the covers might be made of tin, fitted 
 to the parterre, and riveted upon an iron frame round the 
 bottom; these being painted occasionally would last for 
 many years. — London Gardener's Chronicle. 

Deepening the Soil. 

To deepening the soil as the efficient means of an increased 
 fertility there are many testimonies. Perhaps the most defi- 
 nite and valuable is that of the Rev. S. Smith, of Lois 
 Weedon, in Northamptonshire. His evidence is valuable, 
 both because it refers to two very different kinds of soil, and 
 because it extends over a number of years. We refer to it 
 rather for the purpose of illustrating the principles of tillage 
 than in order to commend any particular mode of farm 
 practice. Having walked over his fields both in winter, 
 when the process was in operation, and in summer when its 
 results were ripened, we can speak as to the means employed, 
 the soil on which they are employed, and the produce which 
 rewards them. Early in July last year we saw Beans and 
 Swedes and Wheat on a very stiff loam, which had been 
 gradually deepened by means of the fork, latterly indeed 
 trenched. And on a gravelly soil, in an adjoining field 
 which had been similarly deepened, there was an abundant 
 crop of Wheat. The Swedes were luxuriant and healthy, 
 such as are seen ordinarily under good culture in September; 
 the Beans were wonderfully podded; and the AVheat was the 
 most extraordinary crop of the three. It has been Wheat 
 after Wheat on the same soil for a succession of j r ears; triple 
 rows, a foot from one another, being cnltivated with 3 feet 
 intervals; these intervals, forked and cultivated during the 
 growth of the rows on either side, being the site of the next 
 year's crop. This alternate crop and fallow, without the 
 use of manure, yields an average of 34 bushels per acre per 
 annum over the whole land so treated; deep and thorough 
 tillage thus proving to be in effect the equivalent of manure. 
 The fact, for so after 10 year's observation it may be called, 
 is, that by dint of deep and thorough tillage successive corn 
 crops can be grown by bringing tho mere life, of the seed 
 into connection with the stores of food for it which a tolera- 
 bly stiff soil and the atmosphere together yield. 

But the advantage of a deeper soil on the one hand, and 
 of more thorough tillage on the other, is now everywhere 
 admitted; the more general prevalence of Turnip husbandry 
 has contributed greatly to the latter good result: and Mr. 
 Smith's, of Deanston, subsoil plough, and every instance of 
 cultivation such as that of Lois Weedon on a horticultural 
 scale, and by horticultural means, have contributed to the 
 former. And so we see that cultivators, horse-hoes, grub- 
 bers, are taking the place of those imperfect tillage imple- 
 ments — heavy drags and harrows; and ploughs for deeper 
 work are made and used in large numbers. We do not add 
 here remarks upon the obvious cause of infertility which 
 shallowness of soil is when lying on the rock. Where plants 
 are "scorched because they have no deepness of earth" the 
 remedy is obvious enough, however inapplicable it may be.
