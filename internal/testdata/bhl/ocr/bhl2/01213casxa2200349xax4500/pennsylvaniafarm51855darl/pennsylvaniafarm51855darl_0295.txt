up with more of the surrounding earth than can be done 
 with deciduous trees. These fibres, with little sponge- 
 lets or mouths at their extremities for absorbing food, 
 are of far more consequence to be preserved uninjured 
 than the large roots, and upon transplanting being ac- 
 complished without their mutilation often depends the 
 life of a tree or shrub, whether evergreen or deciduous. 
 If there is one cause of failure more than another in the 
 transplanting of evergreens, we think it is in allowing 
 the roots to become dry. Unlike other trees, their ex- 
 tremities, when once dried by exposure to the sun and 
 closed up, do not again readily open to absorb food. 
 The fibers do not seem in this particular to have the same 
 elasticity as the roots of deciduous trees, and, therefore, 
 cloudy or damp days should always be selected for their 
 removal, and the precaution taken of covering the roots 
 as soon as they are lifted out of the ground. With this 
 and the usual care taken, as with other trees, there is no 
 difficulty in transplantipg evergreens. As to the proper 
 time, we believe the present is as good as any other, if 
 not better, but any time will answer excepting when 
 they are growing, or before the new wood is mature â€” a 
 period generally occupying the months of June, July 

and August. 

At the present season of the year the ground is warm, 
 and as the sap elaborated from the leaves is descending, 
 the roots commence growing immediately, and often es- 
 tablish themselves before winter. The atmosphere is 
 also more moist, and the cloudy days and heavy dews 
 prevent the same excess of evaporation from the leaves, 
 as during the dry aud hot suns of spring and summer. 

When the holes are half or two-thirds filled, it is ad- 
 visable to pour in a plentiful supply of water, which 
 settles the earth about the fibres, and promotes their 
 speedy starting. This is far preferable to surface wat- 
 ering. Heavy stones should also be placed around the 
 trunk, or a stake secured to prevent their being blown 
 about by high winds. There are no three evergreens of 
 large growth to be compared with the Norway Spruce, 
 Silver Fir and Hemlock Spruce. No lawn is complete 
 without these, while the filling up may be done accord- 
 ing to fancy with Deodar and Lebanon Cedars, Crypto- 
 meria, Double White Spruce, and numerous other varie- 
 ties, to be found at the nurseries, and which should be 
 visited at this season by all who intend to plant the 
 coming fall or spring. 

HAY TEDDING MACHINE. 

The above is a cut of a Tedding or Hay-making Ma- 
 chine, built somewhat on an English model, but greatly 
 simplified by American skill and ingenuity. The English 
 machine was patented there in 1816, and has been in 
 extensive use since. The combination of the gearing is 
 such that the revolving rake makes four and a half revo- 
 lutions for one of the carriage wheel, the hay undergoing 
 a process of teazling or tedding of the most perfect de- 
 scription. It is separated and tossed about till no two 
 stems of the plant are left in contact, and by this expo- 
 sure the drying process is effected in a period greatly 
 shorter, and more effectually, than could be done by any 
 number of hands. 

It is intended for one horse, to be ridden by a boy. 
 About two acres can be spread with it in an hour, the 

hay being thrown some six or eight feet high, and falling 
 evenly, and so light, that the sun and air have access to 
 every part. 

What labor-saving implement for the use of farmers 
 is coming out next it is difficult to say, but the old idea, 
 about farming being a laborious occupation, will soon 
 have to be abandoned. They can now ride in an arm 
 chair, with an umbrella over their heads, through their 
 fields, cutting their hay and grain, raking it together, 
 spreading the hay, drilling their grain, aud various other 
 operations, while comfortably seated on top of the ma- 
 chines. This is a great change in twenty years. Some 
 patent elastic cushion, and a spring seat chair, with 
 high back, may perhaps be needed after a while instead 
 of the present rather uncomfortable seat, but the times 
 are hardly up to that recpairement yet. When they are
