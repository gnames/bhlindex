Breaking Steers. 

In breaking a pair of steers, first confine one of them in a 
 yard 14 to 18 feet square, high and strong enough to hold 
 him ; then enter the pen with a switch three or four feet 
 long, and with your pockets filled, not "with rocks," but 
 with ears of corn, apples, carrots, <fec. Tame the steer by 
 feeding kirn, and convince him that you mean him no harm. 
 Having done this, I introduce my business to him, by get- 
 ting him into a corner with as much gentleness as possible. 
 Here stroke him and pet him in various ways feeding him 
 with a nubbin or two of corn. 

Of course ho must learn to "haw" — so I strike him gently 
 on the off ear with my switch, and with my back to him 
 twist his tail, (a little twisting is better than more ;) having 
 succeeded, I conduct him again to his corner and order him 
 to "whoa"— which from the force of circumstances he is com- 
 pelled to do. Thus I teach him to "stand" as well as "haw," 
 and in a short time he will obey the command in any part of 
 the pen. 

After sufficient practice in the pen, I let him out into a 
 large yard and then drive him with equal success. Here he 
 becomes well accustomed to the '"Whoa, Haw, Gee," proces- 
 ses. But if he does not prove sufficiently tractable I return 
 him again to the small yard for further discipline. The 
 other steer I serve in the same way. 

Preparatory to yoking I drive them both into the pen and 
 exercise them together, making one stand while the other 
 comes up as if coming under the yoke, the whip being held 
 out to represent the yoke. Then taking the bows out of the 
 yoke, I lay it on their necks, taking care not to frighten 
 them in the operation, then put in the bows, and I have a 
 yoke of oxen ! But previous to yoking, drive them side by 
 side in the large yard. While driving in the large yard 
 either single or double, use a whip 8 or 10 feet long, and 
 when driving both, put on a lash two feet long. 

Cautions. — Keep cool ! use judgement for yourself and for 
 your cattle. If they kick you, look out next time, but don't 
 return the compliment, for you are not to consider yourself 
 on equal terms with them. A little patting and rubbing is 
 better. If you have not Christianity enough to return good 
 for evil, don't undertake to break steers. I had rather break 
 a pair of wild steers for $5, than a pair that had been inju- 
 diciously handled for $10. 

Be very careful not to overload them, and never drive 
 them till they got out of breath. Many cattle are broken in 
 spirit and constitution while young. Indeed, very few know 
 what a good, well-broken, well-fed, and well-tended pair of 
 oxen can do. Never whip, and never talk loudly. The 
 superiority of this mode in economy of time, in ease of exe- 
 cution, and in final results, will be apparent enough to any 
 one who trios it. Charles H. Walker.

Physic to Colts at Weaning. 
 Many persons are of opinion that it is unnecessary to ad- 
 minister physic to foals and young horses ; but a few obser- 
 vations will dispel that notion. After a foal has been weaned 
 and deprived of its mother's milk, the liver very frequently 
 assumes an inactive, sluggish disposition. The coat indi- 
 cates this by its harsh unhealthy appearance, and the ani- 
 mal gives evidence of being what is termed hidebound. 
 Very often the legs will fill from an irregularity of the circu- 
 lation, consequent upon the state of the liver. In such cases 
 one or two mild doses of aloes becomos indispensable. Di- 
 uretics are of no use under these circumstances, their action 

being on the kidneys and urinary passages, which are not 
 the seat of disorder. For foals recently weaned, one drachm 
 of aloes with an equal portion of ginger and of soap is the 
 proper quantity; but if that does not relax the bowels suffi- 
 ciently, the proportion of aloes may be increased on the sec- 
 ond occasion. A slight dose only is required, because the 
 aloes being supposed to act primarily on the liver, it is 
 merely necessary to stimulate that organ to its healthy ac- 
 tion. The only restriction necessary in the diet is substitu- 
 ting bran mashes for hay during the twenty-four hours pre- 
 ceding the time of administering the medicine, and carefully 
 providing the animal from the effects of rain; otherwise, if 
 the weather be favorable, no danger need be apprehended 
 from the usual enlargement in the paddock or field during 
 the operation of the physic, while the exercise will assist the 
 desired result. Foals which have been fondly treated when 
 with their dams, and subsequently, will not occasion much 
 trouble in administering the ball. When they are weaned 
 a light head collar or halter should be put upon their heads, 
 and, being accustomed to that, the ball may readily be given 
 by placing it on the end of a piece of whalebone or cane. —

How to Cut Hedges, 
 Almost all the Thorn hedges one sees clipped square, i. e., 
 the top is made flat and the sides perpendicular, the object 
 apparently being to make them as like a wall as possible. 
 An observation I heard made lately seems to have a great 
 deal of truth in it, viz., that this system has a great tendency 
 to make the hedge grow thin below, and that it is a much 
 better way to keep it widest at the base and let it gradually 
 taper to a point at the top. I have certainly seen hedges 
 managed in this way present a beautifully close surface, 
 which I attribute to the plan of allowing a much greater 
 number of shoots to reach the outside. Hedges kept square 
 are very apt, when old, to get "blanky," and grow bare near 
 the ground, even though the top may be quite thick and 
 flourishing. In this case there is no remedy but cutting 
 down, always a disagreeable necessity, for then all shelter 
 is gone at once, whereas this would very seldom be necessary 
 if the hedge was kept in a pyramidal shape, for then there 
 would always be plenty of shoots close to the ground equally 
 young and growing as those at the top. A Northern. [This 
 is excellent advice, but we are concerned to hear that our 
 north-country friends stand in need of it. — Eng. Paper. 

Hoeing, Versus Watering. 

At this season of the year, when vegetables begin to look 
 parched and the ground becomes dry, gardeners think they 
 must oommence the use of the watering pot. 

This practice, to a certain extent, and under some circum- 
 stances, may, perhaps, be proper, but as a general rule, to 
 which there are commonly some exceptions, I apprehend it 
 is incorrect. The same time spent in hoeing, frequently 
 stirring the earth about vegetables, is far preferable. When 
 watering has once commenced it must be continued, must be 
 followed up, else you have done mischief instead of good; 
 as, after watering a few times, and then omitting it, the 
 ground will bake harder than as though nothing had been 
 done to it. Not so with hoeing. The more you stir the 
 ground about vegetables, the better they are off; and when- 
 ever you stop hoeing no damage is done, as in watering. 
 Ground is always improved by stirring; and stop when you 
 will, there is no subtraction from this benefit, no danger ac- 
 crues. Vegetables will improve more rapidly, be more 
 healthy, and better at maturity, by frequent hoeing than by 
 frequent watering. And this result is very easily shown by 
 experiment. Just notice, after a dewy night, the differenco
