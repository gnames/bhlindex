between ground lately and often stirred, and that which has 
 lain unmoved for a long time. Or take two cabbage plants, 
 under similar circumstances, water one and stir the other 
 just as often, stirring the earth about it carefully, and 
 thoroughly, and watch their improvement, see which thrives 
 best. 

There is also a secret about this stirring the earth, which 
 chemists and horticulturists would do well to study with the 
 utmost scrutiny and care. 

Soil, cultivated in the spring and then neglected, soon 
 settles together, the surface becomes hard, the particles co- 
 here, attract little or no moisture, and from such a surface 
 even the rain slides off, apparently doing little good. But' 
 let this surface be thoroughly pulverized, though it be done 
 merely with an iron rake, and only a few inches in depth, 
 and new life is put into it, the surface becomes friable and 
 soft, the moisture of the particles again becomes active, at- 
 tracting and being attracted, each seeming to be crying to 
 his neighbor, "hand over, hand over â€” more drink, more 
 drink." And why this elaboration should grow less and 
 less, till, in a comparatively short time, it should seem al- 
 most to cease, is a question of very difficult solution; though 
 the different composition of soils, has doubtless something 
 to do with the matter. 

But let the stirring be carefully repeated, all is life again ; 
 particles attract moisture from the atmosphere, hand it to 
 each other, down it goes to the roots of vegetables, the little 
 suction fibres drink it in, and though we cannot see these 
 busy operations, yet we perceive their healthy effects, in the 
 pushing up of vegetables above the surface. 

Now, if these things are so, and any one can satisfy him- 
 self by trying the experiments, then I think, Mr. Water 
 Pot, you might as well retire and make your bow to Mr.

Agricultural Show in England. 

The annual exhibition of the Royal Agricultural So- 
 ciety of England took place at Carlisle about the 20th of 
 July. It is spoken of as generally satisfactory, although 
 the display in many departments fell very short, in ex- 
 tent at least, of previous years. The entries of Short- 
 Horns, compared with the last show at Lincoln, were as 
 ninety-eight to one hundred and eleven. Herefords 
 were more numerous, being as thirty-two against four- 
 teen of last year. Devons as twenty-three against 
 thirty-eight. Of horses, being in the horse-breeding 
 region, there was a large and fine display. Of sheep, 
 the show of Leicesters was unusually large ; the South- 
 down class much less ; the Mountain and Cheviot sheep 
 very numerous-. U. Tanday was most successful for 
 premiums among the Leicesters ; U. Rigden, of Brigh- 
 ton, in the absence of Jonas Webb, among the South- 
 downs, and U. Lane in the long wool classes. Of pigs, 
 there were fifty-three pens less than last year, and many 
 of them were complained of as being over-fed. Some 
 were thrown out of competition on account of their teeth 
 indicating a greater age than stated in the certificates. 
 The number of pens of poultry was one hundred and ten 
 less than last year. The Dorking class was most ad- 
 mired, while the entire class of Spanish fowls received 
 high commendation ; also the Aylsbury ducks. 

In implements the display appears to have been short 
 on account of the distance of Carlisle from the manufac- 
 turing districts. There was, however, a great variety of 
 plows, reaping machines, portable threshing machines. 

chaff cutters by hand and power, bone mills, linseed and 
 corn crushers, brick machines, draining engines, &c, 
 Hussey's and McCormick's reapers, with English addi- 
 tions, or improvements. They have appended to Hus- 
 sey's a tipping platform for facilitating the back deliv- 
 ery ; also a, balance weight to the crank axle to give 
 greater freedom in its rapid revolution. To McCor- 
 mick's machine they have added a patent platform, on 
 which are mounted three worms for delivering the grain 
 off sideways. "The worms on which the ear ends of the 
 straw falls, having a larger diameter than the worms 
 next the cutter, send off the straw with greater velocity 
 and impetus, thus insuring a very regular lay of the 
 swathe for binding." 

Salmon's American grain fan obtained a silver medal, 
 and attracted much attention. The editor of the Agri- 
 cultural Gazette says it separated oats from peas, beans 
 and corn, clover from timothy, red-top from clover, and 
 will take grass seeds, clover seed and wheat, and sepa- 
 rate all three seeds at one operation. He adds, "its ex- 
 traordinary operation reminded him of another American 
 machine, advertised to give out ready cooked sausages 
 from one end and brushes from the other, having swal- 
 lowed a hog in the centre." A Yankee operator attend- 
 ed the fan, and told the people it would separate new 
 from old wheat. 

The greatest attraction at the show appeared to be the 
 steam plow, and having given in our last number an ar- 
 ticle from an English paper, stating the advantages ex- 
 pected from the introduction of the steam plow, we now 
 give in another column an accouut of the performances 
 of the one which worked most satisfactorily. Several 
 were exhibited. 

Planting Trees. 
 As the Planting season is again approaching and will 
 no doubt catch many still unprepared, who have been 
 lamenting all the past summer over their scarcity of 
 fruit or shade or both, we would encourage them at once 
 to make arrangements, by selecting at leisure the varie- 
 ties of trees they want, ploughing and preparing their 
 ground, choosing a proper site, preparing stakes &c, 
 There is so much to be said about these different matters 
 that we have no space in a work like the Farm Journal, 
 where a variety of subjects claim attention, to enter 
 upon it at much length. Every one having planting to 
 be done should purchase as a matter of positive neces- 
 sity and for permanent use some one or more of the 
 works extant, on Fruit and Ornamental Trees. Down- 
 ing, Barry, or Thomas's fruit books, should be in the 
 hands of every farmer ; and for information respecting 
 ornamental trees and shrubbery, there is no treatise so 
 cheap and so desirable as Meehan's Hand book, price 
 seventy-five cents. Whether fall or spring planting be 
 preferable, is a matter of opinion ; for apple, pear, cherry 
 and plum trees, and for deciduous ornamental trees, we 
 greatly prefer the fall, for several reasons. First, it is 
 a more leisure season, and more time can be spared to 
 plant properly; second, the trees become settled and. 
 established, the roots make some development of growth 
 even in the winter, and are ready for the earliest ad- 
 vance of spring. They consequently grow more the first 
 year than if ti-ansplanted in the spring ; third, they do
