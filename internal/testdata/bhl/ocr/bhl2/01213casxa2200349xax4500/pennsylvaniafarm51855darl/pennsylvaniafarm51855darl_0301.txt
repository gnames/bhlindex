Living in the Country, — Experience of Mr. and Mrs. 
 Sparrowgrass. 
 It is a good thing to have an old-fashioned fire-place in 
 the country; a broad-breasted, deep-chested chimney-piece, 
 with its old-fashioned fender, its old-fashioned andirons, its 
 old-fashioned shovel and tongs, and a goodly show of cherry- 
 red hickory, in a glow, with its volume of blue smoke cur- 
 ling up the thoracic duct. "Ah ! Mrs. Sparrowgrass, what 
 would the country be without a chimney corner and a hearth? 
 "Do you know, " said I "the little fairies dance upon the 
 hearth-stone when an heir is born in a house?" Mrs. Spar- 
 rowgrass said she did not know it, but, she said, she wanted 
 me to stop talking about such things. "And the cricket," 
 said I, "how cheerful its carol on the approach of winter." 
 Mrs. S. said the sound of a cricket made her feel melan- 
 choly. "And the altar and the hearth-stono: symbols of 
 religion and of home! Before one the bride — beside the 
 other the wife ! No wonder, Mrs. Sparrowgrass, they are 
 sacred things; that mankind have ever held them inviolable, 
 and preserved them from sacrilege, in all times, and in all 
 countries. "Do you know," said I, "how dear this hearth is 
 to me?" Mrs. Sparrowgrass said, with hickory wood at 
 eight dollars a cord, it did not surprise her to hear me grum- 
 ble. "If wood were twenty dollars a cord I would not com- 
 plain. Here we have everything — 

' content. 

Retirement, rural qm'et. friendship, books, 

Ease and alternate labor, useful lite ;'' 

"and as I sit before our housohold altar," said I, placing my 
 hand upon the mantle, "with you beside me, Mrs. S., I feel 
 that all the beautifnl fables of poets are only truths in para- 
 bles when they relate to the hearth-stone — the heart-stone, 
 I may say, of home J" 

This fine sentiment did not move Mrs. Sparrowgrass a 
 whit. She said she was sleepy. After all I begin to believe 
 sentiment is a poor thing in the country. It does very well 
 in books, and on the stage, but it will not answer for the 
 rural districts. The country is too genuine and honest for 
 it. It is a pretty affectation, only fit for artificial life. Mrs. 
 Peppergrass may wear it with her rouge and diamonds in a 
 drawing room, but it will not pass current here, any more 
 than the stimulated flush of her cheeks can compare with 
 that painted in those of a rustic beauty by the sun and air. 

"Mrs. Sparrowgrass," said I, "let us have some nuts and 
 apples, and a pitcher of Binghamton cider; we have a good 
 cheerful fire to night, and why should we not enjoy it?" 

When Mrs. Sparrowgrass returned from giving directions 
 about the fruit and cider, she brought with her a square pa- 
 per box full of garden seed. To get good garden seed is an 
 important thing in the country. If you depend upon an
