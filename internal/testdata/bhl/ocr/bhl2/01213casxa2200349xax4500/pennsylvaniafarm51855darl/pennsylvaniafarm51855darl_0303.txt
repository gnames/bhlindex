 Distillery Refuse. — Putrescent draff (distillery grains) 
 makes an excellent manure. If well trodden into a pit, and 
 covered up from the air, it will keep for years, and be as 
 good food for cattle as when new ,• but exposed to atmos- 
 pheric action, putridity is the speediest result. When not 
 allowed to become dry during the fermenting process, it is a 
 very powerful fertiliser; but it is better to use it mixed with 
 some other substances than alone. If not very severely 
 rotted, it may be advantageously mixed with ordinary ma- 
 nure, while otherwise it will be better to use it in ordinary 
 composts. It is thrown out in some distilleries into wasto 
 or sluice-ponds, and consequently the mud deposited in such 
 reservoirs is justly regarded as a powerful manure. I have 
 seen cases in which land has been very greatly improved by 
 being irrigated with refuse water of distilleries, containing 
 in suspension largo quantities of putrid draff. One case in 
 particular may be mentioned, in which the benefits derived 
 from such treatment were much greater than can well be 
 estimated. In the vicinity of a large distillery, on a fully 
 lower surface-level, a field of fiat land was laid down to grass 
 perhaps about twenty years ago. The annual value of the 
 ground at that time would not be more than 25s. per acre. 
 Some time subsequently the discharging ditch of a refuse- 
 pond connected with the distillery was turned into the field, 
 and the farmer spared no pains in making the most of the 
 liquid which it brought. Open feeding drains tvcro carried 
 through the field in various directions, and from them at 
 right and left branched off shallow triangular gutters over 
 the whole surface, like so many arteries carrj'ing the life's- 
 blood to every part. The water brought large quantities of 
 putrid grains, mud, and other refuse matters, and left them 
 on the surface of the field. After many years of incessant 
 attention to this fertile source of manurial supply, the far- 
 mer is now reaping a rich harvest for his trouble. The land 
 at the present time, if lot in pasture, would give at least £4 
 per acre ; and as it is used for dairy cows, a much greater 
 number of which can now be kept on the farm than would 
 otherwise have been the case, it is undoubtedly worth a 
 much higher rent to the tenant. This is just a case in 
 which compost has been used in a liquefied form, the near- 
 est of all others to the mode of manuring which plants seem 
 by nature to demand. Distillery-wash, or what is termed 
 dreg in some districts, is also a valuable fertiliser. When 
 applied in a putrid state, and in large quantities to clay soils, 
 it has the effect of binding them rather much, but in tolera- 
 bly light or well-pulverised land this objection to its use is 
 obviated. For pasture, even on the stiffest land, it is gene- 
 rally equal in fertilising power to the best tank-liquid. I 
 have often used it for this purpose, giving at the rate of 
 289 

about 8 tons per acre. The amount which this cost was 8s. 
 as purchase price, with about an equal sum for cartage. 
 This is not the most profitable way, however, to use it, as I 
 found by experience. The best way is to form a pretiy 
 large earth compost, and give an occasional drenching with 
 the dreg, which, when old, is a strong slab mixture. When 
 the heap consists of various kinds of earthy and refuse mat- 
 ters, and has been turned over and well soaked for several 
 times, the contents will be found of a greasy black nature, 
 and on trial little inferior to many kinds of farmyard dung. 
 Even clay-rubbish, when treated in this manner, with tho 
 addition of the drainings of cattle-stalls, will bo found val- 
 uable manure. 

As a manure for gooseberry bushes, nothing can bo better 
 than earth composts, such as rotten vegetable matter soaked 
 with dreg. I have several times had practical proof of this 
 in extensive orchards. The quality of dreg varies consid- 
 erably, being often so watery as to bo almost worthless as a 
 manure, while at other times it is thick and muddy in ap- 
 pearance. Generally speaking, however, old liquid is thick 
 and of considerable value. Taking Professor Anderson's 
 analyses of what appears to have been a superior quality of 
 dreg, we have in the imperial gallon —

 Tan Refuse. — This principally consists of the spent oak or 
 other bark, used in tanning operations. In the state that it 
 comes from the tan-pit it is a worthless substance, but as it 
 ferments very readily, with proper management it may be 
 made a valuable manure to use with other matters. In the 
 neighborhood of Edinburgh it used to sell at Is., but now it 
 is only 3d. a ton, and there is no demand for it. This no 
 doubt is to be attributed to the want of success which at- 
 tended its use; but then, if tho system of preparation was 
 bad, the results of its use could not be good. In preparing 
 it for use, it was generally saturated with sewage water, 
 holding in suspension large quantities of mud, but not fer- 
 mented ; hence, on being used, the slightest evaporation left 
 little better than when taken from the tan-yard. Peat, from 
 its bibacious nature, would have been much better adapted
