for this process than hard gritty bark. To render the latter 
 a profitable manure, it should first be well fermented by it- 
 self; and after the hard chips are sufficiently reduced, it 
 may be mixed for further preparation with other substances, 
 such as stall-manure or earth ; or it may be used with ad- 
 vantage as a covering for lime heaps. For whatever pur- 
 pose it may be applied, if properly prepared, it will be an 
 excellent dressing to apply to stiff land, as it acts both 
 chemically and mechanically, and, at all events, it is surely 
 worth 3d. a cart. All the refuse animal matters of tan- 
 works go to the glue-manufacturers and plasterers. Some- 
 what similar to tanners' bark, we have sawdust, which, 
 though difficult to decompose, makes an excellent auxiliary 
 to the ordinary manures of the farm. Once thoroughly 
 fermented and mixed with other manurial matters, it will be 
 found of great use in improving the mechanical texture of 
 clay soils as well as rendering them more fertile. So long 
 as it can be got in wood-yards for nothing it is well worth 
 the attention of the farmers. 

Gas-work Refuse. — Gas-lime differs from ordinary lime, 
 only in consequence of having imbibed, during the purifica- 
 tion of the gas, sulphuretted hydrogen and more or less am- 
 moniacal salts. In numberless instances it has been used 
 with great advantage in compost-heaps. In the neighbor- 
 hood of Edinburgh it has been extensively employed by 
 some of the most spirited farmers, among whom Mr. Finnie 
 may be mentioned as one of the first to direct attention to it. 
 The quantity annually produced at the Edinburgh Gas- 
 Works amounts to about 900 tons. Formerly it used to be 
 given for the carting away, but now it is sold at 3d. a ton, 
 and the demand is greater than can well be supplied. Some 
 farmers, who have applied liberal dressings, state that the 
 succeeding crops have been better than after the ordinary 
 applications of farmyard manure ; others affirm that, com- 
 pared with newly-burned lime, it is in every respect supe- 
 rior. In Glasgow the refuse lime is sold at Is. 6d. to 2s. 6d. 
 a ton ; and at Kirkcaldy it brings 1. 6d. per ton. Some 
 have applied it to red land, like caustic lime ; but it will be 
 found much more profitable to compound it with earth, peat, 
 couch-grass, or other vegetable matters. The ammoniacal 
 water of gas-works, in large cities, is generally used in 
 manufactories, for the preparation of commercial ammonia, 
 but in small works, in country villages, it is often thrown 
 out with the tar. It is a most valuable fertiliser, contain- 
 ing, in some cases, as much as li lbs. of sal-ammoniac in 
 the gallon. It may be used to promote the fermentation of 
 peat or couch heaps, or may be mixed with any earthy or 
 carbonaceous composts. In England it has been used, in 
 some cases, in conjunction with sawdust, and gave very 
 beneficial results. If applied to grass land in too large 
 quantities it is liable to scorch the surface, but, diluted, it 
 produces fine dark-colored herbage. The lime water of gas- 
 works is also a potent fertiliser, but hitherto it has been 
 little used. The lime employed to purify the gas is, to a 
 certain extent, liquefied; and after considerable evaporation, 
 a quantity of fluid, somewhat viscid, and smelling strongly 
 of hydro-sulphuret of ammonia, is run off to an underground 
 tank. This lime-water, about 500 tons of which are annu- 
 ally produced at the Edinburgh Gas-Works, has hitherto 
 been given for the carting away. One or two farmers have 
 used a good deal of it, but very largo quantities are still al- 
 lowed to run waste. If mixed with bibulous substances, 
 more especially if they are capable of being fermented, an 
 excellent compost for use, along with other manures, will be 
 produced. Gas-tar may also be employed in a similar man- 
 ner with advantage, only it is necessary to use it rather cau- 
 tiously and along with other substances, or it may injure 
 the crops to which it is applied. 

Sewerage of Cities. 

One of our daily papers recently well observed in re- 
 lation to the great loss to agriculture from the waste of 
 city drainage, "that nature never wastes any thing. She 
 transmutes but does not destroy, economises, but does 
 not squander. Great cities, when they come to be pro- 
 perly managed, will give back to the country as much 
 as they take from it, instead of being as now constant 
 drains upon its fertility." 

In London works are now proposed to be construct^ 
 by a Mr. Stothert, by which the drainage of that citv; J 
 instead of being wasted as at present, may be made 
 available for agricultural purposes. He estimates the 
 annual expense of collecting, mixing and distributing 
 the sewerage of that vast metropolis at about a million 
 of dollars, and that the receipts for farmers would be 
 twenty millions. The total amount of liquid sewage 
 daily from London is estimated at 150,000,000 gallons, 
 yielding 5,000 tons of solid matter, and sufficient to fer- 
 tilize ten million acres yearly, and at a much cheaper 
 rate than by guano. 

While we condemn the thriftless farmer in allowing 
 the drainage from his farmyard to pass away, and be 
 forever lost to the soil, it is also true that the sewage of 
 large cities would be equally valuable, and contains the 
 very elements for reinvigorating the soil and restoring 
 what has been taken away by continued cropping. The 
 time will no doubt come when Philadelphia, New York, 
 and other large cities, will take measures to secure to 
 farmers the great treasure now annually wasting in the 
 form of sewage. Bad habits in agriculture, as in every 
 thing else, grow strong by reason of use, and we become 
 so accustomed to a fixed routine as to at last concluci 
 there is no way but the good old ivay." We crop foijjj 
 half a century three to four inches of earth, and when 
 it is thoroughly exhausted and unproductive, move out 
 to the far west in search of new fields and new farms on 
 which to pursue the same system, entirely losing sight 
 of the fact that by plowing two inches deeper we may 
 turn up a new farm on our own paternal acres. So with 
 manures. We neglect the sewage of our cities and the 
 drain of our barnyards, and go to Peru, some thousands 
 of miles off, for the means of renovating our exhausted 
 lands. Is the world really getting wiser as it grows older? 

Imported Cattle. 
 The Oliver Jordan arrived at Philadelphia on the 28th 
 ult. with forty head of cattle — Durhams, Ayrshires and 
 Alderneys — the most important contribution to our stock 
 ever before made in a single voyage. The Ayrshires 
 and Alderneys, and a portion of the Durhams, were the 
 importation of Mr. Alexander, of Kentucky, whose ef- 
 forts to improve the breed of cattle in the United States 
 have been attended with the best results. The residue, 
 which are Dorhams, were imported by Mr. Lorillard 
 Spencer and Mr. Lewis G. Morris, of Westchester, N 
 Y., Mr. Moses J. Becar, of Long Island, and Mr. David 
 Brooks, of Avon, Livingston county. The animals wei iS 
 purchased chiefly, if not wholly, at the Tanqueray sale, 
 as it is called, last spring. Mr. Tanqueray, now de- 
 ceased, owned an estate of five or six hundred acres of 
 land, about six miles from London, known as Brent 
 Lodge, or the Decoy Farm, Hendon. He was a distiller, 
 of immense wealth, who had picked up the best stock he
