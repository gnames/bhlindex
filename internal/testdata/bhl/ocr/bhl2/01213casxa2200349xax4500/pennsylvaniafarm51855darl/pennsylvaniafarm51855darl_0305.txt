could find in the different herds in England, without re- 
 gard to price. He had accumulated through such efforts 
 a noble herd, the best in many respects collected togeth- 
 er in England. The sale of his stock was the occasion 
 for the assemblage of the most experienced cattle breed- 
 ers of England and the United States, and large prices 
 were realized. A single animal produced four hundred 
 and eighty guineas, and the total of one sale was nearly 
 fifty thousand dollars. Mr. Spencer was the purchaser 
 of two superior animals — Hope and Hopeful. Mr. 
 Brooks, of Livingston — a wealthy and practical farmer 
 of the Genesee Valley — was the purchaser of three, and 
 Messrs. Morris and Becar of eight. 

The latter purchases have arrived at Westchester, N. 
 T., and are represented as superb animals, in high con- 
 dition. They are cows and heifers and one calf, the 
 produce of one of the cows during the voyage, which 
 has been called the Oliver Jordan, after the vessel. 

Having had an opportunity of inspecting the stock 
 noticed above, we can confirm the statement that they 
 are one of the most valuable importations ever made 
 into the country. They were accompanied by a regular 
 herdsman, and although the voyage was a very rough 
 one, no accident happened, and they all arrived in fine 
 condition, two calves being dropped on the passage. 

These animals showed what skillful and scientific 
 breeding can accomplish to improve shape, size and ma- 
 turity — some of them being as nearly perfect models of 
 beauty as could well be imagined. One cow had been 
 purchased at $2500, which, with the enormous prices of 
 several others, seemed to prove that the perfection they 
 have been brought to is not the result of mere chance, 
 but skill and science long and perseveringly directed. 

There are probably now in the United States a suffi- 
 cient number of the very best animals of different breeds 
 to make farther importations unnecessary at such ex- 
 travagant rates. It has been remarked by English 
 breeders, that Americans have taken away their very 
 best stock, and have been the most spirited buyers at 
 their public sales. We should not be surprised if some 
 day the tables were to be turned, and English breeders 
 come here to obtain good crosses. 

Uniformity in Breeding. 

Unless intelligent and thoughtful men devote them- 
 selves to it, the stock of the country will not be im- 
 proved. It requires the nicest perception, united with 
 a perfect mastery of principles and details, to fix a true 
 standard and attain it. The smallest errors should be 
 corrected. Apparently slight causes, operating during 
 successive years, produce very marked results, and in 
 the end change entirely the whole character and config- 
 uration. With perhaps some partial exceptions, we 
 have accomplished little in this country worthy of espe- 
 cial commendation, except by the introduction of foreign 
 breeds. The Morgan and Black Hawk horses, origina- 
 ting in a cross of different breeds, have, to a certain ex- 
 tent, a specific and definable character — they belong to 
 this country. 

Conceding all that can be reasonably claimed, it re- 
 mains true that the mass of American Farm Stock is a 
 jumble of all sorts, propagated ivithout a purpose and 
 without a plan. Crosses are made as "economy" and 

convenience suggests. The nearest or the cheapest 
 stock animal is used, careless of results. Leaving, for 
 the present, various branches of the subject, we will 
 conclude with some remarks upon uniformity in breed- 
 ing. 

There are more reasons than could be readily offered 
 why the individuals composing a particular flock or herd 
 should bear a close resemblance to each other. No bet- 
 ter evidence of skill and care in breeding can be given. 
 Any blundering operator may have occasionally a fine 
 animal, but to breed even is the work of time and atten- 
 tion. It being known that a breeder has a certain de- 
 scription of animals, those wishing that class are ad- 
 vised where to go. A reputation is established. Com- 
 petition among buyers will bring up the price. 

Similarity of disposition, size, color and contour in 
 working oxen and horses will be appreciated — "match- 
 ed" teams have a market value often expressed by very 
 high figures. Uniformity should be local or sectional. 
 Certain districts should be known as the home of partic- 
 ular breeds. This is so in England and other countries ; 
 soil, climate, &c, should control the selection. This 
 plan adopted, buyers and sellers would find it very con- 
 venient, but the great consideration remains to be stated : 
 No man can breed with any certainty of favorable results 
 without breeding in a definite tcay, following a particular 
 model, and adhering to it through successive generations. 
 A race of milkers can be obtained only by selections 
 from milking families, and by crossing them upon stock 
 nothing deficient in milking qualities. Workers, and 
 other varieties, follow the same law of hereditary de- 
 scent. H. T. B;, in Rural New Yorker. 

American Triumph in Europe. 

The United States contributions to the great exhibi- 
 tion at Paris have not made much show, but, on being 
 put to the test, it seems they are of a very valuable 
 character. The New York Tribune gives the subjoined 
 account of the trials of the machines for threshing, 
 reaping and mowing : 

The net results of a half hour's earnest work by the 
 rival thrashers, and by six men with flails, (estimated as 
 a force equal to one of the machines,) is as follows: 
 Six thrashers with flails, - - 60 litres of wheat. 
 Pitt's American Thrasher, - 740 '• " 

Clayton's English " - - 410 " " 

Dunoir's French " - - 250 " " 

Pinet's Belgian " - - 150 " " 

[The French litre is a little less than a quart : 36 
 litres make a bushel, very nearly.] 

Assuming, in the absence of data, that these machines 
 are of equal cost and are worked with equal force, and 
 that the average expense of thrashing and winnowing 
 wheat in the old way is ten cents per bushel, the Bel- 
 gian thrasher reduces this to about four cents, the 
 French to three, the English to two, and the American 
 to barely more than one cent per bushel, or one-tenth of 
 the cost of flail-thrashing in the old way. This year's 
 crop of wheat, rye and buckwheat in the United States 
 can hardly fall below 200,000.000 bushels, which could 
 only be separated from the straw and chaff in the old 
 way at a cost of $20,000,000. The Belgian thrasher, if 
 in common use, would reduce this to $8,000,000, the
