Judging Animals. 
 The difficulties which are often experienced by the most 
 competent judges, in deciding between two really first-rate 
 animals of a first-rate sort, are greater than the majority of 
 people who never acted in the capacity of judge have any 
 idea of. I am happy to say that at the meetings of the 
 Royal Society such cases frequently do occur, and, I hope, 
 always will, and with the wish that what I here suggest may 
 tend to assist judges in their laborious duties, I am induced 
 1 i trouble you with these remarks. 

I will take an instance of two first-rate Short-horn bulls, 
 neither of them having a faulty point. Judge A. says, 
 "What a superb back No. 1 has!" B. says, "But look at 
 that depth of careass in No. 2." " But the length of quar- 
 ter in No. 1 1" continues A. ; and in return B. draws atten- 
 tion to the silky texture of the skin of No. 2. The question 
 is here put to Judge C, who should decide the case ; but he 
 has to balance, in his mind, whether a superior back is more 
 to be considered than an extraordinary depth of carcass ; 
 and again, is a first-rate quality of hide equivalent to an 
 unusual length of quarter ? And thus points, without hav- 
 ing some definite value attached to them, might be compared 
 one against another ad infinitum, without ever coming to a 
 satisfactory conclusion. 

Now, what I wish to see is, a definite value affixed to 
 every point in the perfect animal, and when such cases of 
 nicety as I allude to do occur, let the judges take point by 
 point, and compare value in numbers, and then the animal 
 commanding the highest amount would be the one selected. 
 If the perfect animal were 50, the component parts might 
 be something as follows : 

General appearance, - - - 8 12 10 
 Back, (length and width,) - - 8 10 8 

Chest,, 6 4 5 

Width of hips and loin, - 5 4 5

 This table is merely on a rough scale ; but, I think, if the 
 Royal Society would devote one of their meetings to the 
 consideration of the subject, their time would not be wasted; 
 aud a scale made under their direction, similar to the above, 
 would be received by the agricultural public as an authentic 
 data to refer to. — Mark-Lane Express. 

The Largest Nursery in the World. 

It has been some years since Rochester has become the 
 head quarters for nurseries in America. From only a few 
 acres in extent, as they existed fifteen or twenty years since, 
 the nurseries within ten miles of the city now cover at least 
 one thousand densely planted acres. 

The cost and annual product of these nurseries may be 
 reckoned with some degree of accuracy, by taking as the 
 basis of calculation the estimates of several intelligent nur- 
 serymen of that place, — that a well managed acre would 
 yield as an annual average from two to three hundred dol- 
 lars — the expenses varying from fifty to seventy-five per 
 < cent, of this amount. It would of course be greatly con- 
 trolled by the kind of trees raised, the proportion of orna- 
 mentals, Ac, but still more by the judgment, energy, and 
 skill exercised by the manager, — for under the direction of 
 some, the cost exceeds the profits, and the business conse- 
 quently soon comes to an end. 

But it is not our present object to pursue this inquiry, but 
 to give to our readers the results of a few hours personal 

observation of one of the establishments to which we have 
 alluded, — namely, that of Ellwanger and Barry, who 
 now have about two hundred and seventy-five acres actually 
 occupied with their nurseries. These are not all in one con- 
 tiguous piece of ground, but are comprised in four principal 
 detached portions, of fifty to a hundred acres each, lying 
 near each other. For extent and perfection combined, there 
 is none in America that nearly approaches this establish- 
 ment, and we have not been able to ascertain from satisfac- 
 tory sources, that there is any in Europe — although there 
 may possibly bo a greater number of hands employed in 
 some European nurseries, where labor is cheap and economy 
 not studied. 

Ellwanger & Barry had in regular employ at the time of 
 our visit over one hundred hands. In the spring they have 
 two or three hundred. Being in the midst of the budding 
 season, they have sixteen active budders at work, with boys 
 to tie after them, and other hands to precede them in pre- 
 paring the stocks. These, added to such as were occupied 
 in providing the buds, and in removing the ligatures, 
 amounted to about sixty in all, connected with this depart- 
 ment of operations. The buds are all cut by the proprietors 
 themselves, and every pains taken to secure the greatest 
 accuracy throughout this mammoth establishment — about 
 twenty-five thousand buds are inserted daily ; and eight 
 persons are required in connection with the pei - sons who 
 cut the buds, to remove the leaves from them on the spot. 

They employ twenty-five horses. During all the early 
 part of the season, these were all required in cultivating 
 the rows — at present only eighteen are needed for this pur- 
 pose. 

We observed single fields, of thirty or forty acres each, 
 out of the many which constituted their establishment, 
 which alone would be regarded as large for an entire nur- 
 sery. A block of ninety thousand (90,000) cherry trees, 
 one year from the bud, was especially noticed for its beauti- 
 ful growth, most of the trees being already about five feet 
 high, and as even along the tops as if they had been shear- 
 ed. A half acre of seedling pears had as fine a growth as 
 any we have ever seen, although they numbered at least one 
 million. They must be worth, at market prices, more than 
 ten thousand dollars. Two hundred thousand were picked 
 out from them early in summer without any sensible dimi- 
 nution of their numbers. As nearly as we could estimate, 
 there were at least two hundred thousand Norway firs two 
 feet or more in height, and covering many acres. 

Their ornamental department is on a very large scale. 
 They have five hundred feet in length of glass propagating 
 houses — seven acres in roses — and about half an acre dense- 
 ly planted with dahlias. They have a very rare collection 
 of the celebrated new California^ tree, the Wellingtonia 
 gigantea, being no less than five thousand fine young plants 
 of this tree, grown from seed collected in California, and 
 which were procured by gathering such as the squirrels had 
 thrown down in their depredations. A year ago, these 
 plants sold for a guinea each — at only one dollar now, here 
 was a space twenty feet square worth a valuable farm. 

In their grape house, they have over ten thousand exotic 
 grapes of fine growth for sale. Their collection of bearing 
 specimen pear trees is unequalled in this country — they 
 have five to six thousand, most of which are handsomely 
 trained pyramids, comprising about four hundred sorts. 

In such an immense establishment, our readers will natu- 
 rally suppose there must be a great deal of confusion and 
 much bad growth and bad cultivation. But the reverse is 
 true in a striking degree. An excellent system appears to 
 pervade the whole,: and as many have remarked, they are 
 remarkably successful in all they undertake, from the most
