The Cocliituate water, of which Bostonians boast, will 
 be introduced and plentifully distributed through every 
 part of the enclosure, for the greater convenience of ex- 
 hibitors and exhibited. 

Seats for five thousand spectators will be built on the 
 west side of the track, on the home stretch, so that oc- 
 cupants may oversee the two most important parts of the 
 "trial of speed," viz: the start and the coming in; 
 while their elevation will enable them to witness all the 
 exciting and tantalizing occurrences incident to a trot — 
 the baulk — the break — the widening gap — the favorite's 
 nose nearing the distance post when his competitor's tail 
 has passed the goal. This improvement has, I am 
 pleased to see, been adopted at most of our large 
 shows. 

All the buildings upon the grounds will be erected 
 under the superintendence of Mr. John R. Hall, Archi- 
 tect to the Society, whose professional taste and skill 
 have secured to him an enviable reputation. These 
 erections are beautifully designed, and with a proper 
 distribution of the large and the smaller tents over the 
 vast area, cannot fail to produce a fine effect. 

"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure," 
 and we shall accordingly take every precaution against 
 the occurrence of accidents; but as "accidents will hap- 
 pen in the best regulated families," our old friend Dr. 
 Geo. H. Dadd, who is our veterinary surgeon, will be in 
 constant attendance to render his professional services in 
 cases of need. 

Of course no one can now speak with certainty as to 
 the number or character of the entries which will be 
 made, but we shall be sadly disappointed, if in quality, 
 as well as in quantity of stock, it does not excel all our 
 previous exhibitions ; and as you know, we had no rea- 
 son to be ashamed of either one of them. We calculate 
 with considerable confidence on entries from your State, 
 as well as from many others. But do not judge of our 
 Massachusetts animals by the Durham bull show at 
 Springfield, Ohio, which was finally won in a raflle for 
 eighteen cents. 

If your breeders conclude to come on, do not allow 
 them to draw on us before they leave home for their pre- 
 miums as being a sure thing! 

The horse department will be very certain to delight 
 every lover of that noble quadruped. Already we have 
 been advised of the intended exhibition of some of the 
 finest imported animals in the country, and our horses 
 of home manufacture will be in mass convention you 
 may rely on it. The first trotters in America will try 
 their speed on this national course for the championship, 
 and the most famous stallions will be here to uphold 
 their reputation. Come and see them, and bring all 
 your friends. 

The show of sheep and swine will undoubtedly be 
 great and excellent, for their home is but a few hours 
 ride hence. Our premium list has been sent to you, by 
 which you see that we offer in the aggregate about ten 
 thousand dollars. Our expenses may be estimated at 
 near ten thousand dollars more. Our admission fee is 
 but twenty-five cents, so please give us your good wishes 
 for one hundred thousand visitors ; we hope for more. 

On the afternoon of Friday, the last day of the show, 
 a Grand Agricultural Banquet will be held beneath a 

large tent on the grounds. Seats for three thousand 
 persons will be provided ; and when you know that our 
 excellent President, Marshall P. Wilder, will preside, 
 and that Everett, Choate, Winthrop, with other eminent 
 men from other States, are expected to address the as- 
 semblage, you will with reason anticipate an unusual 
 treat for the physical and the mental man. 

I am on the point of departure for the Vermont and 
 New Hampshire State Shows, which are held respective- 
 ly at Rutland and Manchester ; this fact will account 
 for the insufiiciency of my reply to your queries, and for 
 the haste with which I subscribe myself. Yours truly,

Raspberry Culture. 

We have long endeavored to urge upon the agricultu- 
 ral portion of our readers the profits of fruit culture, 
 and especially the smaller fruits in the vicinity of Phila- 
 delphia. Strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, cur- 
 rants, and gooseberries, are not found in this market at 
 all equal to the demand, and those consequently who 
 have gone into their culture, and abandoned the stereo- 
 typed rotation of corn, oats and wheat, are reaping a 
 very handsome remuneration. The following article 
 from a Poughkeepsie (New York) paper will give some 
 idea of the style in which the raspberry business is car- 
 ried on in that section. The variety cultivated there is 
 the True Red or English Antwerp. This is niuch supe- 
 rior in size and quality to the common Red Antwerp, 
 but needs protection in the winter, which is given by 
 simply bending down the canes and covering with a few 
 inches of earth. 

For profit, we would prefer twenty acres of suitable 
 land, well located in respect to access to market, within 
 fifteen miles of Philadelphia, and devoted to fruit and 
 vegetable culture, to any one hundred acres within the 
 same distance, and farmed under the ordinary system. 
 The article says : 

There are now about one hundred acres of raspberries 
 in bearing in the immediate vicinity of Milton, and im- 
 mense quantities of plants are being set out every year. 

A few days ago we visited the raspberry plantation of 
 Nathaniel Hallock, at Milton, in order to learn the modus 
 operandi of the culture. Mr. Hallock's being one of the 
 principal plantations. 

The pickers were in the fields with their baskets be- 
 tween eight and nine o'clock in the morning, as soon as 
 the dew was off the plants, as the berries do not keep so 
 well when picked wet. 

In a short time the pickers began to bring in the bas- 
 kets of berries. These baskets hold about a pint, and 
 are very neat looking, being made of willow, and much 
 superior to the baskets in which strawberries are sold, 
 in fact the berries would hardly sell if sent to New- York 
 in strawberry baskets. 

There were about fifty pickers at work — men, women 
 and children — the women being the most expert pickers, 
 of course. 

One person was employed constantly, and a part of 
 the time several persons, packing the baskets. The bas- 
 kets, as soon as picked and examined, are packed into 
 boxes of different sizes, according to the crop of that
