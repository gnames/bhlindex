THE FARM JOURNAL. 

[October 

day. The object of putting them into boxes is to insure 
 their safe transit to the market, and in order to do this 
 the packer has to work carefully to fit the baskets in so 
 that each one braces the other ; when the boxes are filled 
 to the top, the lid is closed and locked, and the boxes are 
 ready for shipment. 

The season lasts about six weeks, and this period is 
 one continual round of business ; the berries being sent 
 pff to New-York every night except Saturday, (there 
 being no sale for them on Sunday.) 

The berries were all picked about six o'clock, and after 
 supper they were conveyed to the landing, the baskets 
 making two very heavy two horse loads, and as we could 
 calculate the steamboat took off about 60,000 baskets 
 that night, making about twenty tons of berries, exclu- 
 sive of the weight of boxes and baskets. 

The baskets are imported from France by hundreds of 
 thousands every year, and although such quantities are 
 manufactured every year, the supply is inadequate to the 
 demand, the latter exceeding the former by about one- 
 half. 

The culture of the plants requires the services of a 
 large number of people. 

The pickers constitute a small army, there being from 
 five to ten, and often more, required for each acre, ac- 
 cording to the time in the season, which was at its height 
 this year about the second week in July. 

The manufacture of the boxes in which the baskets of 
 berries are packed is no small item, and the steamboats 
 that carry this extra freight are obliged to employ extra 
 men to handle it. 

This business, though at first view it seems small, 
 gives employment to, and distributes its gains among, 
 thousands of people. 

From the Milton landing, the average daily export is 
 10,000 baskets, and the retail price in New-York, ave- 
 rages about ten cents per basket, thus the product of 
 100 acres amount to $1,000 per day, or $42,000 per 
 season. We can call to mind no other crop which pro- 
 duces as much per acre, or which gives employment to 
 so many. 

Can Manure be Removed by the Tenant? 

This question, which often has given rise to difficulty 
 between landlord and tenant, has been finally disposed 
 of by a decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, 
 delivered by Chief Justice Lewis. While the views en- 
 tertained by the learned Judge will be recognised every 
 where as Just and right, it is also gratifying to find they 
 are sustained by law— justice and law in these fast times 
 not being always synonymous terms. 

As the whole opinion, and the legal authorities cited, 
 would occupy rather much space, we quote below the 
 substance of his argument. It was the case of Lewis, 
 landlord, against Jones, tenant, to recover damages for 
 carrying off a quantity of manure from a piece of land 
 leased by Lewis to Jones. The principle that the ma- 
 nure belongs to the land of course applies equally in the 
 case of a sale of property as of a lease : 

The defendant kept cows : they were pastured on the 
 place. There were a few acres for pasture and some for 
 hay. It was testified by one witness that the defendant 
 also purchased some hay. The defendant left the place 

on first of April, but in the latter end of March he re- 
 moved the manure, which was in heaps in the barnyard. 
 There were about thirty wagon loads. 

James Orr, another witness, testified that Lewis bought 
 some hay. Witness did not know how much. He pur- 
 chased grain to feed his cows and horses. He had eight 
 or nine horses. He fed the horses on grain that was 
 bought. Another witness testified that he lived with 
 Lewis in the fall of 1848. He testified that all of the 
 hay and straw used were bought. The cows were dairy 
 cows. 

It is implied from the letting of a farm for agricultural 
 purposes, that the tenant will cultivate the land accord- 
 ing to the rules of good husbandry. This is as much a 
 part of the contract as that he shall deliver up possession 
 at the end of the term, or that he shall do no waste. If 
 the manure which is made by the feeding and bedding of 
 his stock on the premises, according to the usual course 
 of husbandry, is to be disposed of and carried to another 
 farm, it only creates necessity for the purchase of other 
 fertilizing materials to keep the land in good order for 
 the production of crops. This must be done at expense 
 of money in the purchase, and time and labor in hauling 
 it from a distance. If every tenant were to adopt the 
 practice of selling the manure, much time and labor 
 would be unnecessarily expended in transporting it from 
 place to place ; where, for all general purposes, the in- 
 terests of landlord and tenant would be much better 
 promoted by the application of the manure to the farm 
 on which it was made. But a large proportion of farms 
 are owned by widows and orphan children, and are ne- 
 cessarily in the occupancy of tenants from year to year. 
 These, which should be under the peculiar protection of 
 the law, would be most exposed to impoverishment. 
 Tenants for short or uncertain periods, under the tempta- 
 tions of a rule of law which encourages bad husbandry, 
 would be led into practices (each in self protection,) 
 which no one would adopt with regard to his own land. 
 Such a tenant would feel no interest whatever, in pre- 
 serving the fertility of the soil for the benefit of those 
 who might succeed him. He would be prompted by the 
 incentive of interest to strip the land of every thing 
 which the law permitted him to carry off. The practice 
 would become general, and the result would be that all 
 the farms in the commonwealth under cultivation by 
 tenants for years would be impoverished; the tenants 
 themselves receiving no adequate remuneration for their 
 labor, the landlords no rent for their farms. It is mani- 
 fest that such a course of husbandry would be injurious 
 to the public interests and ruinous alike to landlords 
 and tenants. 

The doctrine that the manure goes with the land is of 
 course confined to farms which are let for agricultural 
 purposes ; and the case before us is one of that charac- 
 ter, in which the manure was made from the produce of 
 the farm. 

One of the witnesses, however, testified that the tenant ; 
 "bought some hay — the witness did not know how much 
 — "and some grain to feed his horses and cows. He fed 
 the horses on the grain that was bought." Upon this 
 evidence the court was requested to instruct the jury 
 "that if the defendant spread upon the place, or left 
 behind him, as much manure as the farm would reason-
