ably produce itself, the excess belongs to hiin and not to 
 the landlord." 

This construction the court refuses to give, because 
 there was no evidence of the facts thus supposed to ex- 
 ist. In this the court was perfectly right. 

Nothing can more justly impair confidence in the ad- 
 ministration of justice than the practice of encouraging 
 or even permitting a jury to find facts of which there is 
 no evidence. To ask a jury to separate the manure 
 which was made on the premises, and to assign one por- 
 tion to the tenant upon the ground that his horses and 
 cows had "some hay" "some grain," not raised on the 
 premises, without specifying how much of either, or 
 showing how much of the grain, hay and straw, raised 
 on the farm, had been supplied them for litter and food, 
 would be asking a verdict without evidence. "Some" 
 is a term too uncertain in its signification to sustain a 
 verdict for any definite amount. It may mean a single 
 ounce, or ten thousand tons — a single quart, or twenty 
 thousand bushels. 

But where a farm is let for agricultural purposes, the 
 tenant cannot justify the removal of any portion of the 
 manure made on the premises, by occasionally employing 
 his teams in business not connected with the cultivation 
 of the soil, and supplying them in part with hay and 
 grain purchased from others, so long as the manure thus 
 made is commingled with that from the produce of the 
 farm. It is probable that in such a case the land would 
 lose as much during the absence of the teams on the road 
 as it would gain by the foreign admixture. 

Be that as it may, it is certain that the tenant, by his 
 own act, has rendered it impossible to ascertain the ex- 
 tent of his rights. 

And the doctrine of confusion of goods properly applies 
 to his claim. Popham's Rep. 38 PI. 2.

 of B., so that it becomes impossible to distinguish what

It is ordered that the judgment of the court below be

 Committees at Exhibitions. 
 Mr. Editor : — This world of ours is one of strange incon- 
 sistencies. Twelve months ago, and indeed very recently, 
 several of our papers (yours amongst the rest) contained 
 communications reflecting severely upon the awards of Com 
 mitteees in agricultural implements at the State Fair. The 
 writers with commendable regard for the interests of all 
 exhibitors, suggested the propriety of so dividing the duties 
 of committees in this peculiar department as would enable 
 them to give a full and impartial examination to every 
 article, and report accordingly. This suggestion, which 
 had every thing to recommend it to favor, was adopted by 
 the Philadelphia Agricultural Society at its recent exhibition, 
 and the reasonable hope was indulged that all the exhibitors 
 would have an equal chance, and the awards of the commit- 
 tees be satisfactory. Alas, for the fallacy of human expec- 
 tations ! Like some of the aforesaid correspondents of the 
 newspapers, I had made a tour of very close inspection 
 amongst the implements before the committees acted, but 
 especially those for which the regular premiums of the 
 Society were offered. A friend well acquainted with agri- 

cultural implements and their practical uses, accompanied 
 me. We took note of the particular merits of each, as 
 displayed either in the quality and style of workmanship, 
 or in its adaptation to the purposes for which it was intended. 
 When tho premiums were read off by the Secretary, we made 
 it a point to be present, anticipating the best results from 
 the adoption of the new system. Almost the very first award 
 proved that the experiment was a failure, and many of the 
 subsequent ones confirmed the impression. In a word, the 
 same old tale was told. The farmer whose purchases of 
 implements would be controlled by the awards of the com- 
 mittees, would scarcely succeed in getting all the most 
 meritorious. «. 

Now why is this ? The committees had three days in 
 which to make their examinations. Their duties were so 
 divided that they could not, consistently urge the plea of 
 having too much to do. Why then these singular awards ? 
 I have too much confidence in the integrity of tho gentlemen 
 who composed those committees, to suppose for a single 
 instant that they would, in such a case as this, permit their 
 prejudices to warp their judgment, or that their awards were 
 not made in perfect good faith, and with a sincere desire to 
 do justice to all exhibitors. Admitting this, there is but a 
 single conclusion at which we can arrive, and that is, that 
 the premiums awarded particular implements at agricultural 
 exhibitions are, by no means, correct criterions of their 
 value. In some cases, committees may pronounce correct 
 judgment, but the experience of many years has clearly 
 shown that they are as likely to be in the wrong as in the 
 right. Such being the case, what is the value of the pre- 
 miums. Positively nothing ! Absolutely worse than nothing ! 
 for they frequently mislead and deceive the very persons for 
 whose benefit the exhibitions are held — tho farmers. 

But tho evil doe? not alwa} T s end here. Exhibitors them- 
 selves are frequently misled by the awards of committees, 
 and in one instance at least within my knowledge, an 
 inventor and manufacturer, under the impression that the 
 machine for which a committee awarded him a premium (in 
 common with others intended for a similar purpose), was 
 superior to all others, invested all his means in their manu- 
 facture, and I regret to say the investment has proved a 
 perfect failure. 

Since writing tho above, I have had another opportunity 
 of observing the action of committees on implements, but 
 more particular of one committee whose duty it was to 
 examine not merely a large number of implements and 
 machines specified in the premium schedule, but also all 
 new and valuable improvements in Drills, Reapers, Horse 
 Powers, &c. This committee, unlike the generality of per- 
 sons acting in their capacity, undertook to decide upon the 
 merits of some twenty different Reapers and Mowers, a 
 dozen horse powers and threshers, together with a very 
 large number of drills and other complicated machines from 
 a mere private examination of them, without a single word 
 of explanation of their merits on the part of the inventors 
 or exhibitors. As a result of the examinations of this sapient 
 committee, it is due to them to state that they discovered 
 merit enough in a very common looking ladies' work stand, 
 made of rough wire, to award it a diploma, while such 
 machines as Gibb's Grubbing Machine, Atkiu's Automaton 
 Self Reaper and Raker, Woodwards Smut Machines, a 
 valuable improvement in grain dryers, together with a host 
 of new and important inventions were passed without notice. 
 As additional evidence of their superior powers of discrimi- 
 nation, they awarded a diploma for Scott's Little Giant Corn 
 and Cob Mill, No. 2, (a most excellent article by the way) 
 and another diploma for Scott's Little Giant, No. 3, although 
 the one is an exact counterpart of the other, the only differ-
