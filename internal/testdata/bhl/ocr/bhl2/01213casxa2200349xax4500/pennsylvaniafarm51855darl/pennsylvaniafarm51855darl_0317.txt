bushels from the same trees, which he had sold at an 
 average of more than three dollars a bushel. It may be 
 best, in general, to supply the place of old trees with 
 new, but old trees in this way are brought to bear much 
 sooner than new ; and when the body of an old tree is 
 sound and healthy, there is no doubt but the top may be 
 advantageously converted into a healthy, bearing con- 
 dition.

Awards of Committees at Agricultural Exhibitions. 

Mr. Editor : — Why is it that the awards of commit- 
 tees at our agricultural exhibitions are always delayed 
 until the very last moment ? One great object of such 
 exhibitions is to enable farmers and others to learn 
 which articles and stock are, in the estimation of the 
 committees appointed to examine them, the best. This 
 object is totally defeated by the arrangements now exist- 
 ing, and both exhibitors and visitors are losers by it. 
 Would it not be well for committees in making their 
 awards to have premium cards ready, and as soon as 
 they have come to a determination in regard to the 
 merits of any thing on exhibition to put that card on 
 such article ? My own impressions are that such a 
 course would not only be more satisfactory to all parties, 
 but decidedly more in accordance with the objects aimed 
 at by the Societies. AMICUS.

 A Hint or two for Breeders of Cattle. 

Mr. Editor : — The exhibitions which have already 
 taken place this fall, and which are yet to be held, will, 
 it is hoped, exercise a beneficial influence upon the 
 breeding of improved cattle in our State. The increas- 
 ing interest manifested on this subject, and the fact that 
 the impressions made upon the minds of those who have 
 had opportunities of examining the fine cattle at the 
 various exhibitions are yet fresh and vivid, induces me 
 to offer a suggestion or two through the columns of your 
 Journal. 

The unusually high prices which beef and mutton 
 have commanded for some twelve months past renders 
 the question, how shall we produce a large supply to 
 advantage? one of great moment. A full understand- 
 ing, therefore, of the principles upon which profitable 
 breeding is founded, is very essential to every farmer, 
 but more particularly to thosewho breed animals for 
 market, whether cattle, horses, sheep or swine. It is 
 now conceded that the causes which influence failure or 
 success in Jjreeding are within the control of man. Such 
 being the case, let every farmer ask himself whether 
 there is any room for improvement in his stock. If 
 upon examination he feels thoroughly satisfied that he 
 has reached the perfection of breeding, or that he has 
 gone so far in the march of improvement that economy 
 says stop, then any suggestion of mine will be fruitless 
 to him. But, if the contrary is the case, if he can feel 
 convinced that a good animal will produce one-sixth 
 more meat or wool, or its value in any other respect can 
 be increased in that or even a smaller proportion upon 
 the same amount of food and attention, then it becomes 
 a duty, not only to himself, but to the community, to 

ascertain, if possible, how this increase can best be 
 effected. The object to be sought is the greatest pecu- 
 niary return with the least possible outlay. What kind 
 of animals are best adapted to secure this end? We are 
 told by standard authorities, that in breeding animals 
 intended for food, "small heads, short legs, and small 
 bone altogether, are essential qualifications, and early 
 maturity is equally desirable. Connected with these 
 points, we always find a peculiarly quiet and indolent 
 disposition — what physiologists would term a lymphatic 
 temperament — which is denoted by a fineness of the skin 
 — a certain resilience to the touch, so to speak, caused 
 by the development of those membranes immediately 
 under the skin, which serve for the deposition of fat, in 
 common with other objects. In cows kept for the dairy, 
 where butter and cheese are the sources of profit, the 
 considerations just mentioned, though not altogether to 
 be lost sight of, are yet secondary to others, such as the 
 development of the lactic or milk system." The same 
 author says, "In the breeding of sheep and oxen for the 
 purposes of the butcher, the grand object has been to 
 establish the supremacy of the belly, and dethrone the 
 empire of the cranium and chest; or, in other words, to 
 preserve and perpetuate that form of the abdomen most 
 favorable to the due performance of the digestive pro- 
 cesses, affording the capability of extracting the utmost 
 quantity of nourishment from the food, and at the same 
 time diminishing as much as possible the development 
 of the nervous system, (which would induce too much 
 irritability, and destroy that indolence and quietness so 
 essential for the fattening process,) as well as that of 
 the organs of respiration, which give at once the capa- 
 bility and the disposition for muscular exertion. In the 
 Leicester sheep we have one of the most perfect speci- 
 mens of the preponderating development of the abdomi- 
 nal or lymphatic temperament, and a striking contrast 
 to the short-tailed sheep of the Orkney Islands, which 
 in form, habits and disposition, approximate to the 
 goats." 

From the above brief extracts, it will be seen that 
 close attention to the form and temperaments of animals 
 is essentially necessary to the farmer who would breed 
 them with success and profit. Were it not that I do not 
 wish to intrude upon too much of your space, I might 
 give you more extended extracts. Should these prove 
 acceptable, I may present others in your future num- 
 bers. LEICESTER.

Osage Orange Seed and Plants. 

In a conversation recently with a gentleman from a 
 distance, one of the largest dealers in Osage Orange 
 seed and plants in the United States, he stated in refer- 
 ence to the management of the seed, and the difficulty of 
 its germination, that it was the settled experience of his 
 section, instead of soaking it in hot water previous to 
 planting in the spring, to mix it with sand und place in 
 boxes in the fall, and leave out exposed to the weather 
 all winter. The frost acting upon the tough and hard 
 envelope containing the seed, which is almost as tough 
 as that of the peach stone, breaks it open, thus giving 
 the latter an opportunity for free germination. 

It is then sown in drills in the spring, and comes up
