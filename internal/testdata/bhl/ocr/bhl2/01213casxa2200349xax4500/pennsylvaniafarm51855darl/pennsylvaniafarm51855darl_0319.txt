eastern section of the Union, it is now really more pro- 
 fitable to raise our own stock here, both for feeding and 
 dairy purposes, than to buy them from the far west (we 
 mean, of course, improved stock). Home raised animals 
 are generally more quiet, they feed faster, attain greater 
 weights at the same age, and mature sooner. Butchers 
 are well aware of these facts, and will give more for 
 them. 

There are a few farmers now and then to be met with, 
 who, to save five or ten dollars, the cost of putting their 

cows to such bulls as Astoria, think it more profitable to 
 use a common one for nothing. We think such are wide 
 of the mark, and that the latter plan is much the most 
 expensive. The least first cost is very far from being 
 always the cheapest in the end. The large majority of 
 farmers, however, are fully alive to the importance of 
 obtaining good crosses, and the absolute and aggregate 
 wealth of the whole country has been greatly increased 
 by the efforts of public spirited purchasers and breeders 
 of good stock in various sections. 

A MACHINE FOE WEIGHING AND BRANDING BUTTER. 

The above cut gives at once an idea of a new candi- 
 date for public favor, to facilitate the weighing and 
 branding of butter, which it performs with despatch at 
 one operation. It looks to us as if it might be a valua- 
 ble adjunct to the dairy. The weighmg and printing of 
 butter is generally slow and tedious. We already have 
 capital butter workers, and if this simple implement an- 
 swers, which we see no reason to doubt, the . labors of 
 the dairy will be much lessened. We understand the 
 price is $15. The patentee says of it : 

"By the use of this simple labor saving machine, the 
 butter is formed into blocks of greater density and uni- 
 formity than by the usual operation, rendering it more 
 easy of preservation in the summer months, while the 
 rapidity of the action recommends it as a contrivance of 
 great value, not only to every dairy or store in the coun- 
 try, but also hotels and boarding houses. 

"Without disturbing the action of the machine, the 
 mould and brand may be changed to any form and size 
 required. 

WOOD BUDS AND FRUIT BUDS

view of illustrating the difference between these two 
 kinds of buds, which will be palpable to the most care- 
 less observer. All buds are either wood buds or fruit 
 buds. The former, marked a in the cut, are embryo 
 shoots, covered with imbricated scales of a reddish 
 brown. Their form is usually that of a little cone, more 
 or less pointed, and on the peach tree are found on all 
 parts, the young as well as the older wood. Fruit buds, 
 d, are always rounder than the others, and are found 
 only on one year old wood. There are also double buds 

triple buds, as in the cut, two flower buds and one wood. 
 bud. They are only found on very vigorous trees, the 
 middle eye being the strongest, the side eyes frequently 
 drop off. 

The general appearance of these two kinds of buds 
 are the same in other fruit trees as in the peach, and the 
 functions they severally perform should be of course 
 well understood by the judicious pruner to enable him 
 to regulate and preserve a proper balance between the 
 amount of wood and fruit to be matured.
