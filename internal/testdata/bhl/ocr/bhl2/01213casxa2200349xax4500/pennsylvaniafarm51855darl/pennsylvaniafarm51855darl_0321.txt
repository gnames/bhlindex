How to Commence Business. 
 "Well, boys, we doubt not that you would like to rise high 
 in the world, and become good farmers, merchants, &c. 
 Here is a good motto for you — Begin at the lowest round on 
 the ladder and keep climbing; and here is a story which 
 will illustrate just what we want to say. One of the 
 wealthiest merchants of New York city tells us how he 
 commenced business. He says : — 

I entered a store and asked if a clerk was not wanted. 
 "No," in a rough tone, was the answer, all being too busy 
 to bother with me — when I reflected that if they did not 
 want a clerk, they might want a laborer ; but I was dressed 
 too fine for that. I went to my lodgings, put on a rough garb, 
 and the next day went into the same store and demanded 
 if they did not want a porter, and again "No, sir," was the 
 respone — when I exclaimed, in despair almost, "a laborer? 
 Sir, I wiil work at any wages. Wages is not my object — I 
 must have employ, and I want to be useful, in business." 
 These last remarks attracted their attention ; and in the 
 end I was hired as a laborer in the basement and subcellar 
 at a very low pay, scarcely enough to keep body and soul 
 together. In the basement and subcellar I soon attracted 
 the attention of the counting-house and chief clerk. I 
 saved enough for my employers in little things wasted to 
 pay my wages ten times over, and they soon found it out. 
 I did not let any person about commit petty larcenies, with- 
 out remonstrance and threats of exposure, and real exposure 
 if remonstrance would not do. I did not ask for any ten 
 \our law. If I was wanted at 3 A. M., I never growled, 
 Kit told every body to go home, "and I will see every thing 
 Cight." I loaded off at daybreak packages for the morning 
 boats, or carried them myself. In short, I soon became in- 
 dispensable to my employers, and I rose, and ro^e, until I 
 became head of the house, with money enough, as you see, 
 to give me any luxury or any position a mercantile man 
 may desire for himself and children in this great city. 

Celery. 

Celery: — I am induced to submit to the following hints on 
 the cultivation of Celery, which I practiced very successfully 
 many years in the West Indies, and which, I trust, may be 
 found useful to those who may feel inclined to adopt my sys- 
 tem. It is as follows :^~ 

Finding the usual mode of planting Celery in trenches 5 feet 
 apart, and "earthing up" laborious and inconvenient, I was 
 led, after making several experiments, to adopt a very simple 
 plan by which much labor and ground were saved by plant- 
 ing the plants upon well manured ground 14 inches in the 
 rows, and the rows 14 inches from each other, in the quincunx 
 order. When they are grown of sufficient length I introduced 
 the leaves, after stripping off the small under ones, its bam- 
 boos cut about 12 inches long — the length they admit of be- 
 tween joint and joint, the diameter of each being about 3 
 inches — and in 11 days I have generally had them beauti- 
 fully blanched clean and fit for the table. Since my return 
 to England in 1849, seeing some hollow tiles 12 inches, and 
 of the same diameter as the bamboos before mentioned, used 
 for draining land, it occurred to me that a similar method 
 might be practised here ; consequently I had a piece of 
 ground well manured, dug, the clods being well broken, and 
 ptanted in rows and distances as before detailed. When the 
 leaves were long enough, the small ones being pulled off, I 
 gathered the rest together in my hand, and put them 

through the tiles keeping the surface of the ground clean by 
 occasional hoeing ; the plants made rapid progress, and after 
 a time I put some half tiles on the top of those first placed, 
 thrusting a stick inside both into the ground, to prevent the 
 wind from blowing them down, and in 34 days the Celery 
 was well blanched. On the 15th December last year, I cut 
 one head, that had a second tile about 10 inches long over 
 the first, which measured 3 feet long and 10 inches in cir- 
 cumference, exceedingly well blanched. Previous to severe 
 weather coming, I put Peas haulm, straw, or dry litter be- 
 tween the tiles with clean straw or dry Fern over the whole 
 to protect the plants from frost. It will be an improvement 
 to have the tiles so constructed as to admit of what may be 
 termed a collar on the under and upper tile, so as to fit on 
 each other similar to a turned wooden box, which will ex- 
 clude the air at their junction; and instead of sticks, as be- 
 fore mentioned, I would recommend wires of the thickness 
 of a common goose quill, 30 inches long, or thereabouts, form- 
 ed similar to a surveyor's arrow to be substituted. Should 
 you feel disposed to give my method publicity, further im- 
 provements may be made by experimetalists, or even as it is 
 practised by myself will be found very useful. — James Wa-

Remarkable Yield of Wheat. 

Editor Farmer, Sir : — I send you the product of four 
 kernels of wheat; if any one can beat it, I would like to hear 
 from them. About one month ago, I was passing alongbymy 
 wheat field and I saw where it was finished being cultivated 
 in, the cultivator being drawn off from the piece sown to 
 wheat on to a piece which was not sown, and drew a few 
 kernels with it which produced a few scattering stools. My 
 attention was drawn to them by their being so large, so I ex- 
 amined one of them and was satisfied that it was the pro- 
 duct of one kernel. I counted the straws and found them 
 to be forty-nine, and concluded when they were ripe I would 
 examine them further. So when I was harvesting by them, 
 I pulled up four stools and brought them to the house for ex- 
 amination. The resnlt wa& the first stool had forty-three 
 straws, two of the straws had dead heads that had no 
 kernels in them ; the others I shelled and counted the kernels 
 which numbered 1325. The next stool had'56 straws and 
 1951 kernels; the third one had 56 straws, the fourth one 37 
 straws; the two last are not shelled, but have large heads and 
 well filled, and I have them on hand if any wishes to see 
 them. H. H. Allen.

Recipe for Tomato Figs. 
 Pour boiling water over the tomatoes, (small sized, smooth 
 tomatoes, are the best,) in order to remove the skin; then 
 weigh them and place them in a stone jar, with an equal 
 weight of sugar. Let them stand two days, then pour off 
 the syrup, boil and skim until the skum ceases to rise. Pour 
 this syrup over the tomatoes for two days, then boil and 
 skim the syrup as before. After the third time they are fit 
 to dry, if the weather is favorable; if not, let them remain 
 in the syrup until the weather is favorable; then place on 
 earthen dishes or plates, and dry in the sun ; after which 
 place them in layers, like figs, in wooden boxes, with white 
 fine sugar in each layer. Tomato figs, prepared in this way, 
 will keep for years. A few apples cut and boiled in the 
 remainer of the syrup, will make good sauce of tomato flavor. 
 In drying the tomato figs, use a window sash, and make the 
 frame eight inches deep, and so closely fitted as to keep out 
 the flies ; spread the figs on dishes under the glass, turning 
 them once a day for three or four days, when they will be in 
 a condition to pack away in the boxes.— Mrs. Eliza Marsh.
