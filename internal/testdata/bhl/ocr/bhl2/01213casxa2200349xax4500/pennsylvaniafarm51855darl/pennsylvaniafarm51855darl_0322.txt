[October 

Philadelphia Society for Promoting Agriculture 
 Held their exhibition at Powelton, Philadelphia, on 
 the ground occupied last year by the State Society. 
 Having the prestige of that extraordinary occasion, which 
 was perhaps more successful in every respect than any 
 exhibition hitherto held in this country, a large atten- 
 dance was expected, and was fully realized, the receipts 
 amounting to over $7000. In some of the departments 
 a fine display was made, but in others there was an evi- 
 dent falling off and general disappointment expressed. 
 The amount of fine stock, excepting horses, was inferior 
 to both the Chester and Delaware county exhibitions, 
 and we missed several important contributors of former 
 years, who own some of the finest bred animals in this 
 country, such as Messrs. L. P. Remington, Cadwalader, 
 Gowen, &c. 

From some cause or other, and most unhappily, we 
 think, there has grown up an unpleasant feeling between 
 this and the State Society, which some gentlemen seem 
 to take peculiar pleasure in fostering and extending, to 
 the injury of both. Instead of opening up these diffi- 
 culties and this bitterness of feeling, which ought not to 
 exist at all, to the public gaze, at home and abroad, we 
 would say, leave such things to the politician*. Abuse 
 and denunciation have become natural enough to them, 
 but are out of place in agricultural societies. Their ob- 
 ject is improvement of the soil, which should be strictly 
 kept in view. 

We have rejoiced at the successful result of the Phila- 
 delphia Society's exhibition, and hope for the same to 
 the fullest extent of that of the State Society, which, at 
 the time of our writing this, has but just commenced. 

weighed respectively 5 R)s. 15 oz. and 5 lbs. 10 oz. ; also 
 many new and rare evergreens, five and six feet high, 
 giving a complete idea of their character, habit of 
 growth, &c. Among these we noticed Araucaria Excel- 
 sa and Braziliensis, Deodar and Lebanon Cedars, &c, 
 with many other rare pines and firs, alone worth a visit 
 to the exhibition. 

The Philadelphia Horticultural Society is a credit to 
 the city and State, and by its monthly and annual exhi- 
 bitions has contributed vastly to create and diffuse a 
 taste for those beautiful embellishments, which have 
 rendered the city and suburban residences of Philadel- 
 phia prominent over every other city in the Union. 

Pennsylvania Horticultural Society. 

The annual exhibition of this society occurred in Phil- 
 adelphia at the same time with that of the agricultural 
 though in different places, and attracted as usual a large 
 concourse. Owing to the want of a suitable room for 
 the occasion, the use of one of the public squares at the 
 corner of Market and Broad Streets was granted by the 
 city authorities. This was floored over to prevent in- 
 jury to the grass, and the articles arranged under capa- 
 cious tents, which were high enough to enclose a number 
 of good sized maple and other ornamental trees there 
 growing, which made it a novel and interesting feature 
 of the occasion. 

The display of fruit in great variety and extraordinary 
 quality seemed to us greater than at any preceding ex- 
 hibition, and the profusion of fine and well grown vege- 
 tables, rare plants and flowers, evergreen trees and 
 shrubs in pots, &c, with the tasteful arrangement of the 
 whole, fully confirmed the reputation of Philadelphia as 
 the Horticultural City â€” the City of Gardens. Our private 
 and public greenhouses and conservatories turned out 
 their rare collections, as well as the amateur and market 
 fruit growers and gardeners, who are so numerous in 
 and around the city, the whole producing a display 
 which we do not believe could be approached by any 
 other city in the Union. Among other novelties, there 
 were pine apples growing in pots; a fine collection of 
 choice grape vines also in pots, bearing large clusters of 
 grapes ; Black Hamburg grapes from the graperies of 
 our fellow citizen David S. Brown, two bunches of which 

Delaware Co. Agricultural and Horticultural Exhibitions. 
 This took place at Media, the county seat, on the 7th, 
 8th and 9th ults., being the first of the series of county 
 fairs the present fall. We missed the opportunity of 
 being present, but understand it was superior in many 
 respects to the last one, and was fully successful in a 
 pecuniary way and very largely attended. The display 
 of fruits and vegetables was especially large and fine. 
 Several head of imported stock were on the ground, and 
 some fine horses and oxen. The ladies sent in their 
 contributions to a large extent, and the exhibition par- 
 took much of an industrial and scientific character. In 
 addition to the usual displays of agriculture and horti- 
 culture, Delaware county has for many years sustained 
 her "Institute of Science" in a flourishing condition, 
 with a very respectable cabinet collection in many de- 
 partments of natural science. This, with %n excellent 
 library, has been the means of diffusing a spirit of im- 
 provement among her residents. An excellent address 
 was delivered by A. R. McIlvaine. 

Chester County Agricultural Exhibition. 
 This took place on the 21st and 22d insts., and barring 
 the unfavorable weather of the first day, which no doubt 
 prevented a larger attendance of people, as well as kept 
 away many contributors, it was as fully successful as 
 last year. There was more good stock there than at the 
 Philadelphia or any other county exhibition that has 
 occurred this season so far. The Chester county far- 
 mers have more generally gone to greater expense in 
 procuring choice stock of cattle, sheep and swine, than 
 any other county in the State. Individual cases there 
 are in Delaware and Philadelphia counties where larger 
 investments have perhaps been made, but in no other 
 county is fine stock so generally diffused, or so large dis- 
 plays made. The herd of Anthony Bolmar alone com- 
 prises some twenty-five head of noble cows, either of 
 which would attract attention anywhere. There were 
 also two young Durham bulls on the ground from the 
 State of New York, and one from Kentucky, introduced 
 by Chester county farmers, which will make valuable 
 crosses, and contain some of the best Durham blood now 
 in the country. A large number of grade animals, con- 
 taining more or less of Devon, Durham and Alderney 
 blood, were exhibited, indicating the prevailing disposi- 
 tion for the improvement of stock. Some of the best 
 Southdowns now in this country were shown by Messrs. 
 Cope and Worth, whose flocks are already widely known. 
 Also superior Cotswolds by J. Kinnabd and Jos. Seeds.
