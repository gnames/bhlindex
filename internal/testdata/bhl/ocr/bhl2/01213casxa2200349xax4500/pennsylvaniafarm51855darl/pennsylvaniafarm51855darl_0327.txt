ten years or more ago. Since then it has been gradually 
 perfected, and the one of whose bearing qualities the 
 above cluster is a fair sample was selected from forty 
 varieties as the choicest and best, has been tried under 
 every variety of circumstances, and for richness of flavor, 
 juicyness of pulp, beauty of cluster, productiveness, 
 hardiness and general adaptedness to our Northern cli- 
 mate, is undoubtedly destined to take rank over every 
 variety in use in this latitude. As a wine and table 
 jrape competent judges have pronounced it superior in 
 every respect to either the Catawba or Isabella. How- 
 ever this may be, there is no question but what it pos- 
 sesses intrinsic advantages peculiar to itself alone. 

"The great requisites for a grape in our rigorous cli- 
 mate, after producing a choice fruit, are ability to stand 

our winters and ripen in our summers. Both these quali- 
 ties the Catawba and Isabella lack to a greater or less 
 degree, it being difficult to raise them and more difficult 
 to make them productive. The Northern Muscadine 
 being a seedling of our Native White Grape, it possesses 
 all the hardiness of that species, while it frequently ri- 
 pens as early as the first of September, and always a 
 month or six weeks earlier than the Isabella or Catawba. 
 The berry of the Muscadine is likewise fully as large as 
 that of the Isabella, has a beautiful light amber color, 
 thin skin, a small juicy pulp, and a sweetness and rich- 
 ness of flavor which many regard as quite superior to 
 that of the Isabella, as ripened here. It is moreover 
 easily raised, and when grown becomes a sure and con- 
 stant bearer. 

P.ETJRRE GOUBAULT. 

This fine pear originated at Angers, France, and is 
 worthy of extensive cultivation in the United States. 
 Downing says it is one of the most vigorous and beauti- 
 ful trees as well as productive in this country. The 
 texture of the fruit is like the summer Franc Real, soft, 
 juicy and refreshing, which it also resembles in the color 
 and spotting of the wood. It is, however, much more 
 vigorous and rapid in growth. It even outgrows the 
 Duchesse D'Angouleme on the quince, takes the pyramid 
 form easily, and while growing freely, bears profusely. 

Fruit, round, tapering slightly to the stalk, very 
 smooth, regular and uniform ; skin, greenish yellow at 
 maturity, sprinkled with green dots ; stalk, an inch or 
 more long, set in a narrow depression ; calyx, open, 
 large, in a smooth, shallow basin ; flesh, white, very 
 juicy, melting, sweet, refreshing and pleasant; should 
 be gathered and ripened in the house ; ripens from the 
 last of August to the first of September, immediately 
 preceding the Bartlett. 

Curculio on Plum Trees. 
 It is stated that Mr. John Bkttsh, of Brooklyn, New 
 York, has saved the plums on a number of trees the 
 present season by binding bunches of tansy upon the 
 limbs in several places. The fruit upon the trees thus 
 treated ripened to perfection, while that near by, not 
 thus protected, was entirely destroyed by the insects. —

Dried Peaches. 
 Peaches as usually dried are a very good fruit; but can be 
 made vastly better if treated in the right way. Last season, 
 the receipe, which had quite a circulation in the papers, of 
 drying the fruit by a stove after halting it and sprinkling a 
 little sugar into the cavity left by the extracted pits, was tried 
 in our family. The fruit was found to be excellent; better to 
 the taste of nine out often persons than any peach preserves, 
 by far. The peaches, however, were good ones before dry- 
 ing ; for it is doubtful whether poor fruit can be made good 
 J by that process or any other. — Prairie Farmer.
