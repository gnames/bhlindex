Breeding Cattle for Fattening. 
 We copy the following article from the Wool Grower and 
 Stock Register. As this is the season for farmers to lay in 
 their stock cattle, some useful hints will be found in it, al- 
 though chiefly intended for English Graziers. Of course 
 the use of oil-cake, turnips and swedes, for fattening, does 
 not apply here, yet we think a mistake is also frequently 
 made here of not commencing stall feeding early enough in 
 the autumn. 

"I will here give the substance of a prize essay on fattening 
 cattle by George Dobits, in the Royal Agricultural Society's 
 Journal, containing, as it does, many very valuable sugges- 
 tions as to the selection and care of animals. 

" The first point," he says, " is to have a good sort of bul- 
 lock to begin upon, not to recommend," he says, "any par- 
 ticular breed to the depreciation of all others, because differ- 
 ent localities require different descriptions of animals ; but 
 to caution breeders that it is right to select the characteristic 
 marks of the breed they intend purchasing, to warn them 
 particularly never to purchase a coarse, ill made, bad-bred 
 animal, because they may fancy it cheap. A man has never 
 got so bad a bargain as when he has, as the saying is ' got 
 too much for money.' 

"The first criterion for judging of the disposition of the 
 beast to fatten quickly, in my opinion, is that peculiar, soft, 
 supple feel of the skin which is commonly called handling 
 well. This is generally accompanied by hair of a soft, fine 
 quality, in great plenty. The eye should be full and clear, 
 and the head well formed ; the shoulders not upright but 
 lying well back; the chest full; the ribs deep, and well 
 arched out ; the flanks well down ; the hips nearly level with 
 the backbone, and in proportion to the rest of the carcass as 
 to width ; the rump wide, and not too low, appearing as if, 
 when fat, the tail and rump ends would be level (but this the 
 butchers in my neighborhood are in the habit of calling the 
 fool's point;) the purse should be of full size and soft to the 
 touch (this I consider a material point,) the twist good, and 
 the legs short and small in proportion to the carcass, as the 
 offal will bo light in proportion to the leg-bone. 

"Next observe the temper of the animal; in selecting 
 from a considerable drove you will often find beasts possess- 
 ing many of these good points, yet in a lower condition than 
 some of the animals of a worse appearance. Consider well 
 whether this may not arise from the masterful disposition of 
 the ill-made one, and whether, when put to fatten where 
 every beast may eat his share of food without disturbance, 
 the good bred one will not soon surpass his more masterful 
 neighbor. If you observe a beast that is constantly watch- 
 ing an opportunity of goring any other that comes in his 
 way, leavo him behind, even if he is much heavier than those 
 you select; he may be a great trouble to you; and although 
 the jobber may think you have selected them badly, he will 
 sell them according to what they are worth at the time, and 
 the present weight is the great point with him. For this 
 reason always select the animals before purchasing, rather 
 than agree to give a certain price per head to pick where you 
 like from the drove." 

"I think the quality of an animal is of more consequence 
 than his form for common fattening purposes, but have both 
 good if you can. But if you are thinking of fattening an 
 animal to show for a prize, be sure to have his form as per- 
 fect as possible, for all the flesh you may lay on him will not 
 hide any great defect in his form ; also ascertain if possible 
 how the animal is descended ; ten to one but the progeny 
 becomes similar to the progenitor. But this is generally a 
 most unprofitable affair, and I strongly recommend all 
 young farmers to leave it in the hands of those gentry who 
 can afford the loss, many of whom there are in the country, 

and they deserve our best thanks for their patriotism, for it 
 certainly shows the capabilities of different breeds, and 
 thereby enables the observing farmer to profit by the experi- 
 ence of others. Never buy any animals that are excessively 
 poor; they will consume a great doal of food before they are 
 got into health enough to fatten, for depend upon it, unless 
 your animals are well bought, fattening cattle will never pay 
 enough to leave the manure clear profit, which it ought to do, 
 although I fear with the majority of farmers it is far other- 
 wise." 

"Summer Grazing. — I shall say but little with respect to 
 summer grazing, as the wording of the Society's advertise- 
 ment appears to apply more particularly to winter fattening; 
 merely remarking that the fences should always be kept 
 thoroughly good, a weak place being strengthened before it 
 becomes a gap — prevention, in this case, like many others, 
 being better than cure ; that the bullocks should bo well sup- 
 plied with water, and have plenty of shade; never allow 
 them to be frightened by dogs, &c; treat them kindly, and 
 they will soon cease to fear your presence ; do not let a day 
 pass, if you can help it. without seeing them. There is an 
 old saying, which ought to be impressed on every farmer's 
 memory — it has been of great service to me in the course of 
 m y life — it is: — 'The master's eye grazeth the ox.' A 
 friend of mine has lately adopted a plan, which, under the 
 circumstances, I should strongly recommend — it is that of 
 giving a small quantity of oil-cake to animals grazing, for 
 the sake of improving an ordinary pasture, and its effects are 
 astonishing. The pastures I allude to are small, and one' or 
 two bullocks more than they are calculated to carry are put 
 into each; the lot are then allowed four lbs. of oil-cake per 
 day, per head ; this, at a cost of about two shillings per head 
 per week, which I believe the stock well paid for, has en- 
 tirely altered the face of pastures from what they were three 
 years ago, when the plan was first adopted by him, and I 
 believe without any loss to himself." 

" Winter Feeding. — I now come to the point of winter 
 feeding. First, as to the places in which they are kept, I 
 unhesitatingly give my opinion in favor of stall feeding, for 
 all the common purposes of grazing, but not for young 
 beasts that are to be summered again, or for prize oxen ; the 
 former should have small, well sheltered yards, with good 
 sheds — if the fences are so high that they cannot see over, it 
 is much the better ; and the latter, loose boxes, with plenty 
 of room for them to walk about, because they have to be kept 
 up for such a long period, that, if no exercise were taken, 
 the health might suffer. It is the abuse of stall feeding that 
 has got it into disrepute with some people, and the not tread- 
 ing down straw enough with others. This last I hold to bo 
 an advantage, instead of a disadvantage ; for depend upon it 
 it is not the size of the dunghill, but the quality of the ma- 
 nure that causes the farmer's stack yard to be well filled. 
 If managed well, I contend that there is no plan so good as 
 stall feeding. The fattening house may be of any size or 
 shape, but it is necessary that there should be underground 
 drains, with gratings, to carry off the urine into the liquid- 
 manure tank; shutters behind the bullocks, to regulate the 
 heat, and a wide passage at their heads to feed and clean 
 their mangers. The advantages I conceive to be the quan- 
 tity of litter required being smaller, therefore the muck be- 
 ing made better — the temperature being more easily regu- 
 lated, and every bullock being allowed to eat his share in 
 peace. The disadvantage of the animal not being able to 
 rub himself as well, I consider fully done away with by the 
 rough brush which you will observe I recommend using, 
 and although theorists may fancy the health of the animal 
 likely to suffer, I have never found it so in practice." 
 " Now with respect to their food, so much does this vary
