17 per cent. In Northern Ohio the damage may vary in 
 different localities from 5 to 10 per cent. In Northern Mis- 
 souri where the crop was very heavy, the Council Bluffs Bu- 
 gle, says : 

"Rain began to fall copiously about the commencement 
 of harvest and continued to such an extent that even the 
 wheat in shock, became one verdant mass of growing wheat. 
 Over three fourths the entire crop has been in this way totally 
 destroyed, and that too, as far south as we have heard from. 
 This will be a heavy calamity upon the region thus suffering 
 as there will not be wheat enough to supply the country with 
 flour." 

In Michigan too we learn the wheat is badly grown in 
 many plaees. 

Now, how is the farmer and the farmer's wife to remedy 
 this damage ? In the Spring of 1836, nineteen years ago, 
 we moved to Ohio and pitched our tent among the Ashtabu- 
 las (God forgive us !) and that part of the country was full 
 of grown wheat. Our best of wives, was a most exemplary 
 housekeeper, and this grown wheat was a sore experience, 
 coming as we did from the orthodox rye and Indian of Ver- 
 mont. We (that is, she) tried every plan that female inge- 
 nuity could invent, ihcluding the inventions of all the neigh- 
 bors, and after all came to the conclusion, that, like ring 
 bone or heaves, the thing was about impossible to cure. 

But it admitted of amelioration. Baking powders were 
 not in vogue then, probably they will prove the best ameli- 
 orant; we found that quick made cakes, "hurried up" with 
 saleratus, were less liable to run than raised bread. But we 
 have constitutional objections to hot cakes, despite their go- 
 ing off, and much prefer a ripe loaf of raised bread. Of all 
 our experience we had the best luck by pursuing a practice 
 like the following : 

Take a pan of flour and place it before the fire or under 
 the stove and let it season for six or eight hours, keeping it 
 pretty hot to evaporate the moisture as much as possible. 
 Then make up the sponge in the usual way. It will get 
 lively and begin to spread itself; then knead it down as 
 hard as possible, work in all the flour you can, and then 
 work in a little more ! A little shortening and a little alum 
 water, put in at the commencement of the kneading, will 
 help to hold the dough from running, when set to bake. 
 The loaves must stand in the oven longer than for good flour, 
 or the inside will be clammy. 

For Seed, it is confidently reported by a reliable gentle- 
 man who has tried it, that grown wheat will still vegetate 
 with scarcely any perceptible loss in quantity or luxuri- 
 ance. 

" Pruning when the Leaves are On." 
 The only pruning we hold to be sound, safe and commend- 
 able, at this season, is that of the finger and thumb, — in other 
 words, pinching. It is quite inconsistent with good manage- 
 ment to rear a crop of good shoots at two or three inches 
 growth before they attain to woodliness. This economizes 
 the force of the tree, and turns it into a channel where it will 
 promote instead of frustrating the ends we are aiming at. 
 For instance, if we plant a young tree, and have trimmed it 
 with a view to a certain form, and, contrary to our expecta- 
 tions, a shoot breaks out at an unexpected point, and as- 
 sumes a vigorous habit, and robs all other parts, it would bo 
 evidently unwise to tolerate the intruder until it arrives at 
 full growth, and then cut it away. Too many trees are thus 
 managed, by the neglect of summer pruning or pinching. 
 We admit, however, that there are cases in which the sum- 
 mer pruning, or entire lopping off or cutting of considerable 
 size, may bo judicious and safe. For instance, in the case of 

neglected orchard trees, in a luxuriant state, with dense 
 heads, in which the fruit is deprived of air and light. In 
 such cases, branches may bo thinned out and cut; tho sur- 
 face heals even more rapidly and smoothly than at any other 
 time. But it is unsafe to produce any very sensible dimuni- 
 tion of foliage, as it arrests the growth of the tree. 

All pruning in the growing season tends to arrest growth. 
 Nurserymen know that a slight pruning of stocks before 
 budding will so arrest growth as to make the bark adhere 
 firmly ; when, before the pruning, it lifted freely. It is only 
 on this principle that most all pruning to promote fruitful- 
 ness, must be done at a point of greater or less activity ot 
 growth. Late spring pruning is often resorted to as a means 
 of subduing a superabundant vigor, and it has the same effect 
 as root pruning to a certain extent. — Horticulturist. 

Preservation of Fruit, &c. 

Mr. Greely, in a recent letter to the New York Tribune, 
 on the Paris exhibition, speaking of an invention by M. Mas- 
 son, for the preservation of all descriptions of fruit and veg- 
 etables says: 

The process consists mainly, I am informed, in the slow 
 and complete evaporation of the water contained in the escu- 
 lents to be preserved, by means of a series of ovens, in which 
 they are subjected first to a very gentle, afterward to a higher, 
 but still moderate warmth, until the last particle of mois- 
 ture has exhaled. The dried residuum is now simply packed 
 in papers, (not air-tight cans,) where it may remain for years 
 under any skies, subjected to any sudden alteration of tem- 
 perature, and when opened requires only to be soaked in 
 water to restore it to its original state. I see no reason why 
 fruits may not in time be operated on with like success, and 
 thus peaches, grapes, strawberries, pine-apples, &c, be en- 
 joyed not merely at all seasons but in all climates, and a 
 whaler frozen up in Lancaster Sound make his Christmas 
 dinner of turtle soup, roast (fresh) beef, green peas, cucum- 
 bers, apricots, bananas, muskmelons, and all the delicacies 
 of New York or Paris of every season. This process, I learn, 
 has now been several years in use, until its success on the 
 largest scale is no longer a question. I presume it has ere 
 this been transplanted to the United States; if not, it speed- 
 ily should be. It is of far more consequence to mankind 
 than the fate of Sebastopol. 

Pears on Quince Stocks, 

In corroboration of some of the ideas embraced in an ar- 
 ticle on this subject in our last, we will mention a few facts 
 just brought to our attention in a call at the garden of Dr. 
 James A. Stetson, of Quincy. Dr. S. has tho Flemish 
 Beauty, Glout Morceau, Urbansite, Dunmore, Duchesso 
 D'Angouleme, Vicar of Winkfield, and other varieties on the 
 quince, in a bearing state, and in the most perfect condition. 
 The amount of fruit on some of the trees, considering its size 
 and quality, is astonishing — the branches in almost every 
 case requiring support. Poles are set round the trees, to- 
 wards the extremities of tho branches, and the different sets 
 of branches are fastened to the poles nearly in a natural po- 
 sition. On a tree of the Flemish Beauty we counted on a 
 branch not more than three-fourths of an inch in diameter, 
 and in a length less than two feet, ten pears, estimated to 
 weigh ton ounces each ! In other parts of the tree they 
 hung by fours and sixes, of equal size. 

The soil where these treos stand is rather dry, other sub- 
 soil quite gravelly. Dr. Stetson mulches the ground pretty 
 heavily with seaweed, and in very dry weather applies a 
 barrel of water, from a cistern, to each tree, once in three or 
 four days. Ho concurs with other observing cultivators in
