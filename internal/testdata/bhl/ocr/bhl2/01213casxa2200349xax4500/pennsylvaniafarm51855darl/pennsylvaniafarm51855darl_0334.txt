Plant Fruit Trees. 

Dean Swift once remarked, that any one who should 
 cause a blade of grass to grow where nothing grew before, 
 was a benefactor to mankind. The object of the author of 
 this remark was to state in forcible terms his opinion of the 
 public benefit derived from all agricultural improvements. 
 This saying was figurative ; but it might be literally averred 
 that every man who plants a tree is a public benefactor, 
 whether the value of the tree consists in its fruit, or its 
 flowers, its timber, or even its shade; for, with regard to 
 trees, it may be said that we often seek the substance for the 
 sake of the shadow. We are acquainted with a single lady 
 who makes the national boast, that she has always planted 
 a fruit tree in every place she has resided. Whenever she 
 takes lodgings in any new house, if there be a garden at- 
 tached to it, she plants a fruit tree upon the spot. Such 
 acts, upon her part, seem to be disinterested, as her habit of 
 moving from place to place, must prevent her from being 
 the continual proprietor of these trees. Some one is bene- 
 fitted by them, and she enjoys the satisfaction of having 
 done some good in the world. In these acts, she displays 
 true benevolence. 

We know of a gentleman who lived to see the folly of a 
 different course of conduct. On moving his young family 
 into a house which was connected to a large garden, he was 
 advised to plant it with fruit trees. Ho rejected the advice, 
 and not owning the place, replied that he should plant no 
 trees for other people's benefit. He lived there about thirty 
 years ; and during this space of time he might have raised 
 an abundance of fruit for his own family, and seen many of 
 the trees of his own planting perish of old age. There is 
 perhaps no species of selfishness so foolish as that which 
 prevents one from planting trees; since their cost is but a 
 trifle, and the labor of attending to a few individuals is both 
 wholesome and agreeable. And in this country, where pro- 
 perty is so constantly changing hands, we can never predict 
 when we plant another man's grounds, that these grounds 
 may not become our own or those of our children. — Mass.

Importing Vegetables. 
 It is not a great many years since Connecticut used to 
 supply the West India Islands with onions and other kinds 
 of vegetables; but now the tide has turned, and a stream of 
 vegetables is pouring in upon us from the West Indies and 
 all other parts of tho world. We are certainly getting to be 
 great eaters. With the finest soil and the best climate in 
 the world for all kinds of vegetable productions, we are im- 
 porting from foreign countries the article that ought to be 
 produced in our own gardens. Bermuda supplies us with 
 early potatoes and tomatoes ; and it seems that the British 
 Provinces to the East of us are supplying us with eggs, 
 which are now imported duty free under the Reciprocity 
 treaty. Twelve hundred and sixty dozen of Nova Scotia 
 oggs were entered at the Custom House in Boston on one 
 day this week. We import enormous quantities of dried 
 prunes from France, a kind of fruit that grows abundantly 
 in all of our Eastern and Middle States; we import figs from 
 Smyrna, which might as well be grown in North Carolina ; 
 grapes from Spain, which can be raised in Virginia ; nuts 
 from Madeira, which may be raised in New York; and 
 olives, which might be produced in abundance in nearly all 
 the Southern States. As for eggs, the value of which is so 
 much gronter when they can be warranted fresh, we should 

hardly think that it could be profitable to import them from 
 abroad. Peaches we are able to raise in as great quantities 
 as we can consume ; but we shall not next be surprised to 
 hear of a cargo of this delicious fruit being imported from 
 some neighboring country. Potatoes are brought to us from 
 France, Germany and England, and a cargo of turnips was 
 lately brought to us from Scotland. It is about time that 
 we had begun to develop our agricultural resources. — N. Y.

Breaking Colts to Bits and Harness. 

Much may be done with young horses in the way of cul- 
 tivating their good manners, and forwarding their education 
 — or breaking, as it is usually termed — before the aid of the 
 colt-breaker is required. Foals should be accustomed to 
 familiarities, fondling, and kind usage, from their birth; 
 and if that kind treatment be continued as they grow up, 
 they will occasion very little trouble when the time arrives 
 for them to be broken. Before that operation is commenced, 
 it is desirable that a bit should be placed in the young ani- 
 mal's mouth. Any plain snaffle of sufficient substance an- 
 swers the purpose. There should not be any reins attached 
 to it; it should be merely suspended by the head-piece. 

The Colt will thus learn to play with the bit, which will 
 tend ve ry materially to the establishment of a good mouth, 
 care being observed that the bit is suspended evenly by the 
 proper length of the head-piece. This may be adjusted by 
 any quiet, good tempered person, to whose care the young 
 creature is entrusted; and may be left on from one to two 
 hours daily. A loose box, hovel, or small yard, is the most 
 suitable place for the purpose. 

It is a very bad custom, though a very prevalent one, 
 when a young horse is first bitted, to make use of reins, 
 which are drawn tightly. A colt-breaker, when employed, 
 should therefore be cautioned against it, for it will cause the 
 pupil to contract a habit of leaning on the bit, and probably 
 create a one-sided mouth. By such treatment, many coltf 
 will take a position in one corner of 'the box or hovel, ano" 
 there stand and sulk; whereas if the bit be used as I havr 
 recommended, they will champ and play with it freelj 
 thereby producing that sensibility of mouth which is essen- 
 tial to future perfection. 

Breaking to harness may be considered necessary witn 
 such horses as are adapted for carriages; and their servioea 
 after they are three years old may be advantageously called 
 in requisition on the farm. Their first introduction should 
 never be to a noisy heavy cart. The plan which I have 
 adopted, with invariable success, has been to put the harness 
 on so that the animal may become quite familiar to it in the 
 stable, after which I have a cord attached to each trace. 
 The horse is then led out by an assistant, and another man, 
 with the cords in his hands, offers a slight resistance, as 
 the animal moves forward ; by this initiation the alarm fre- 
 quently occasioned by the pressure of the collar against 
 the shoulders is avoided, as the man who holds the cords 
 can instantly relax them, if necessary. After two or three 
 lessons of this kind, neither trouble nor danger need be ap- 
 prehended in putting the animal to any employment calcu- 
 lated for the advancement of his education in the art af 
 drawing. CECIL.

The Eye. 
 Our sight is the most porfect and most delightful of our 
 senses. It fills the mind with the largest variety of ideas, 
 converses with its objects at the greatest distance, and Con* 
 tinues the longest in action without being tiredor satiated 
 with its proper enjoyments.
