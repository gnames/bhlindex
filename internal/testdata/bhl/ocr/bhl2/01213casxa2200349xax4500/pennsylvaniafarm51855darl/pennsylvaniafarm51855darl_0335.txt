We wish to apologise to our readers for the lateness of 
 the two issues made by us since assuming the publication 
 of the Journal. We had heard dissatisfaction on this 
 account expressed before, and entered upon our duties 
 determined to have it otherwise. But, to our surprise, 
 we found obstacles in the way of a speedy progression 
 of our work which we had not expected, and which we 
 found had for months been hanging like a dead weight 
 upon the efforts of our predecessors. But we are happy 
 in being able to assure our friends that these difficulties 
 have been nearly all removed, and that we can now 
 promise them, with a degree of confidence, greater 
 punctuality hereafter. THE PUBLISHERS. 

Agricultural Exhibitions. 
 Many of our County Exhibitions the present season, 
 and the State one at Harrisburg may be included, have 
 not come up to the expected standard, either in a finan- 
 cial point of view, or the number and variety of contri- 
 butions. There has been an evident falling off, in a 
 general way, from last year, the cause of which should 
 be examined. No one can question the advantage to the 
 farming community, in many respects, of these annual 
 gatherings. Farmers having their business and resi- 
 dences often many miles apart have not the same conve- 
 niences as merchants, manufacturers, or mechanics, for 
 frequent intercourse and transaction of business. They 
 have no common place of meeting or change. Hence 
 agricultural exhibitions are useful in bringing them to- 
 gether, enabling them to see and compare, from year to 
 year, the improvements in stock, implements, new seeds 
 or productions, &c, and if they are firmly established 
 on a permanent and suitable basis, there can be but lit- 
 tle doubt they will exercise a very beneficial influence 
 on agriculture. We dislike, however, to see them lan- 
 guish or drag heavily alrng, to see them barely paying 
 expenses, and to do this at all making it necessary for 
 the recipients of premiums, paltry as they often are, to 
 relinquish them for the "good" of the Society, and to 
 have such persons held up as examples of patriotism for 
 others to imitate. We have regretted there should ever 
 be a necessity for this, and also that to keep up an in- 
 terest or excitement and draw a crowd, it has been 
 thought advisable or necessary to introduce the race 
 course as a regular feature of the occasion ; also eques- 
 trianism by ladies, baby shows, as has been done in 
 Ohio, and other additions a la Barnum. From what we 
 have seen outside as well as inside of the grounds the

present season, we fear these agricultural festivals are 
 rapidly losing their original character and design, and 
 degenerating into occasions for dissipation, horse racing, 
 intemperance, &c, and that we shall ere long have them 
 accompanied from county to county by menagerie exhi- 
 bitions, circus riding, jugglers, infant drummers, &c, et 
 id omne genus. 

No one can fail to perceive that more attention is 
 given already to the course than to an examination of the 
 improved stock, vegetable productions, or new imple- 
 ments. The question of who has raised the best crop 
 and variety of wheat or corn, exhibited the best speci- 
 mens of cattle, sheep or swine, is not thought so impor- 
 tant as who has the fastest horse. 

It seems to us the entering wedge is already made for 
 these exhibitions to change their character, and that it 
 is well worthy considering how they can be maintained 
 on their original intention. Must they be repeated at 
 less frequent intervals, must they lose their original 
 character, or had they better be abandoned ? 

We recollect being present, some years ago, when 
 Nicholas Biddle, at the close of a capital agricultural 
 address, remarked that the world was governed by three 
 boxes — the cartridge box, the ballot box, and the band 
 box, force, reason and affection. We thought at the time 
 one kind of box was omitted — the money box. Despica- 
 ble as money may be in the abstract, still, in these fast 
 times, it is the Archimidean lever which moves the 
 world, builds churches, school houses, rail roads, makes 
 peace and war, gives energy to every effort, is the aim 
 of all human pursuit, buys Durham stock, reaping ma- 
 chines, and we say it in a whisper, hoping no one will 
 repeat it, even controls elections. People generally will not 
 work now for philanthropy or patriotism solely, but for 
 their pecuniary advantage ; and we believe that unless 
 some advantage results pecuniarily to exhibitors from 
 these annual displays, they will not continue their con- 
 tributions, and the exhibitions themselves consequently 
 drop. Believing they have been and may be highly use- 
 ful, this to us would be a matter of great regret. Our 
 idea is, that in any section where an agricultural society 
 flourishes, there will be enough public spirit to raise a 
 permanent fund by donation or liberal subscriptions, the 
 income of which should be appropriated, as one object at 
 least, to sustain the character of the annual exhibitions, 
 and especially to increase the amount of premiums. Make 
 these large enough to answer the object of remuneration, 
 and thus excite competition. This is the design and
