meaning of a premium, 'which should indicate reward for 
 excellence or success in any department, but in nine 
 cases out of ten, to the recipient it now involves a real 
 loss. Take, for instance, a premium offered for a dis- 
 play of vegetables, which varies from two to five dollars 
 at the outside in most county societies' schedules. They 
 are raised with considerable expense of extra labor and 
 manure, and would bring eight or ten dollars in market, 
 but remain at the exhibition for two or three days until 
 they become worthless. What advantage is a premium 
 to such an exhibitor? or a diploma. So with a fine cow 
 which the owner may drive from five to fifteen miles, 
 and run the risk of a two or three dollar premium or 
 diploma. We have had cows which did not recover from 
 the change of keep, fatigue of the journey, &c, for sev- 
 eral weeks, and fell off in their yield of butter two or 
 three pounds per week in consequence. We never could 
 calculate that the two or three dollar premium was a 
 compensation, but that we were an actual sufferer by the 
 operation. The same reasoning may be applied to al- 
 most any articles usually exhibited. The premiums are 
 not generally large enough to pay. This appears to us 
 the great secret, and unless there is some method to 
 make them more worthy of serious effort and competi- 
 tion, we fear many of our old county societies will be 
 unable to continue the interest in them by the public. 

Cannot the same plan be pursued as with many of our 
 institutions of learning, which, by endowment, bequest, 
 or donation, have a permanent fund for their support in- 
 dependent of their regular receipts. Several farms have 
 been recently offered for the Farmers' High School of 
 Pennsylvania; cannot the same public spirit be directed 
 to the permanent establishment of our county agricultu- 
 ral societies ? In England premiums are made large 
 enough to be highly and directly remunerative. They 
 are made worth striving for, and this is the key to their 
 success. Ten, twenty, fifty, or one hundred dollars, for 
 a good animal, a fine crop, a valuable implement, is an 
 object. Premiums there deserve their name, and if they 
 could be made to partake of the same character here, 
 we should find no necessity for bringing in extrinsic ob- 
 jects to attract attention and draw a crowd. 

At the late exhibition of the United States Agricultu- 
 ral Society at Boston, a fund was raised of $20,000 for 
 the occasion. Every one knew beforehand this was 
 equal to an insurance of success.

 Poplar for Pump Stocks. 
 Mr. Editor : — It is a fact perhaps not generally 
 known, that poplar is not a suitable wood for pump 
 stocks. From its white and cleanly appearance, and its 
 tendency to grow tall and straight, it is liable to be se- 
 lected for that purpose ; but, in one or two cases in 
 which I have seen it tried, it did not answer by any 
 means. The first was one put in by Mordecai Larkin, 
 of East Brandywine, Chester county, Pa. Soon after it 
 was in, the water began to have a very disagreeable 
 smell, and continued to grow worse until it was entirely 
 unfit for use, and finally the stock had to be removed 
 One made of white oak was then substituted, and with- 
 out any cleaning of the well or other change, (except 
 that the poplar one had a copper tube for the bucket to 

work in, which was not inserted in the other,) the water 
 in a short time was fit for all kinds of use. The other 
 was one put in by Mr. Waters, of Harford county, Md. 
 It was still in when I saw it, but the water was very 
 offensive, and the probabilities are that he has had it 
 removed ere this. The cause of it spoiling the water in 
 this manner, I leave for those better versed in chemistry 
 to decide. J. L.

The Development of Buds and Branches. — Before 
 their expansion, the leaves of plants, together with the 
 branches on which they are borne, are enclosed in a par- 
 ticular organ called a bud. All branches begin and ter- 
 minate in a bud. A bud is, therefore, clearly an unde- 
 veloped branch. 

The bud, or undeveloped branch or stem, is made up 
 of a succession of leaf-bearing points, called botanically 
 nodes {nodus, a knot). They are so named because 
 these parts of the stem are internally more solid and 
 compact than the other parts, in consequence of the ver- 
 tical fibres of the stem being interwoven with those 
 which are sent off horizontally into the leaf. These 
 nodes are very conspicuous in the bamboo, Indian corn, 
 and all plants with hollow stems, — the grasses for in- 
 stance, — which on examination will be found solid at 
 these points. The naked interval of stem between the 
 nodes are termed internodes. 

Now the formation of buds is the natural result of the 
 cessation of the growth of the internodes and the partial 
 development of leaves at the nodes. That the scale of 
 buds are leaves in an imperfectly formed or rudimentary 
 state is evident from the fact that they are the last leaves 
 of the season, and developed at a period when the vital 
 powers of plants are becoming torpid and the sap is 
 ceasing to flow. Buds are formed usually towards au- 
 tumn, before the leaves fall from the trees, in the axilla 
 of the leaves, that is in the angle formed by the leaf- 
 stalk and the stem. Examine the branch of any tree 
 before it has cast its leaves, and you will find at the base 
 of the peticle or leaf-stalk the buds for the ensuing year. 
 Hence in winter, after the leaves have fallen, these buds 
 remain attached to the branches. 

Buds contain in their interior, in an embryonic condi- 
 tion, the whole plan of the next year's growth, the nodes 
 and even the leaves of the future stem. On the ap- 
 proach of winter the vegetable machinery stops, but 
 there is no disarrangement of its parts, on the contrary 
 all is ready in the bud and awaiting the stimulus of the 
 returning light and heat. 

Linnseus called buds the hybernaculum or winter's 
 residence of branches, and the term is very appropriate 
 as it admirably expresses the design for which buds are 
 formed. The scales which envelop the bud are clearly 
 designed to protect the embryonic branch and leaves 
 which they enclose against the humidity and cold of 
 winter. This is evident from their texture and peculiar 
 appearance in different plants. In the willow and mag-
