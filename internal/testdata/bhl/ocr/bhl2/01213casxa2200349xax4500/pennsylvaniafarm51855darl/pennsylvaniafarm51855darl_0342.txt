rows, beds, or hills, if you do not hill tlicm tip. We 
 often set out in rows, two feet apart, and leave the 
 plants one foot from each other in the rows ; or, a 
 method by which we have enjoyed great success in pro- 
 ducing the finest fruit, has been to prepare a plot of 
 ground, and cover it with strong plants one yard apart, 
 and stimulate these, by a liberal application of liquid 
 manures or soap-suds from the wash, to send out, run- 
 ners, which will soon supply the intermediate ground 
 with plants of nature's own planting, which is a little 
 better done than any one else can do it ; care should, 
 however, be taken to spread the runners so that the 
 above distance of from eight to twelve inches can be 
 preserved. 

For field culture, set two plants in a place, one foot 
 from the next, in rows three feet apart, so as to leave 
 room for a horse-cultivator to pass between the rows, 
 care being requisite not to approach nearer than eight 
 inches to the plants, when at work among them. This 
 whole process of field culture is the same in its general 
 principles with that in the garden ; except, for the con- 
 venience of a horse- cultivator to pass between them, the 
 rows should one way be planted the same distance apart 
 as corn ; then the same treatment as to clean cultivation, 
 and even water and mulching, as far as convenient, is 
 desirable. 

On the selection of a field for strawberries, it is very 
 important to choose one free from all kinds of seeds and 
 roots not decomposed. 

DANFORD'S MOWER AND REAPER. 

The annexed cut will give some idea of Danford's 
 Mower, which is now being built in Pennsylvania, and 
 will be ready for sale next season. We heard of this 
 machine through some of our friends who visited Illinois 
 two or three years ago, and who were highly pleased 
 with its performance and manner of construction. The 
 demand for them there has been so great, that none were 
 able to be supplied for the eastern market. F. S. Boas, 
 of Reading, having now purchased the exclusive right 
 to manufacture them for Pennsylvania, will be able to 
 supply orders the coming season, thus saving a heavy 
 expense for transportation from Illinois. We may also 
 add that from what we have seen of articles from his 
 manufactory, we have no doubt they will be well and 
 strongly made, and be entirely satisfactory in this respect. 

As our object is to introduce deserving implements to 
 the notice of our readers, and then let them judge for 
 fiemselves, we prefer to allow manufacturers to give 
 their own description. One of Danford's machines was 
 exhibited at the Philadelphia County and Philadelphia 
 State Fairs this season. The price of a single mower is 
 $115, cash; mower and reaper combined $130, cash. 

The manufacturer recommends it first for its great 
 durability and superior mechanical construction, ease of 
 draft, and freedom from liability to get out of order; its 
 exemption from the severe jerking motion which all other 
 machines are liable to, thereby causing the journal boxes 
 of the crank shaft soon to wear into an oblong space, 
 which is entirely obviated in this machine bj 7 the double 
 crank, pitman, and knife, which constitutes some of the 
 distinguishing features of the iron mower and reaper. 

Secondly. — It is very compact in its size, and takes but 
 little room for storing, when not in use. 

Thirdly. — The knives are made of one entire piece of 
 cast steel, and are much more easily ground than any 
 other style of knives, and are not liable to the objection 
 of getting loose, as is the case with those which are 
 rivited on to an iron bar. 

Fourthly. — It will perform as much work, in as good a 
 manner, as any other machine ever built, and is in real- 
 ity the very machine for those who are desirous of hav- 
 ing a first-rate article to buy, as it costs no more, nor as 
 much as many other kinds ; it will give as good satis- 
 faction as any other, and will be a good machine when 
 almost any other style is worn out. A careful examina- 
 tion of the machine will be sufficient to satisfy almost 
 every intelligent farmer that it is entirely deserving all 
 that has been said of its merits, upon which the manu- 
 facturer is willing for it to enter into competition with 
 any other mower and reaper now before the agricultural 
 community. 

This machine received the first premium of the State 
 Agricultural Society of Illinois, of 1854, after a trial of 
 four days in competition with all machines of any note ; 
 also, the first premium of the Chicago Mechanics' Insti- 
 tute, of 1853 and 1854 ; La Porte County Agricultural 
 Society, Indiana, of 1853 and 1854 ; Kane County (111.) 
 Agricultural Society of 1853 and 1854, and whenever 
 put in competition with any other in use. 

Bucks County Exhibition. 

The Bucks County Twelfth Annual Exhibition came 
 off as advertised last month, and we are informed was 
 superior in the display and equal in attendance to any 
 previous one. The display of horses, for which Bucks 
 county farmers have long been famous, was especially 
 good. The neat cattle were far more numerous than the 
 appropriated space would contain, consisting principally 
 of the Devon breed and some good Durhams, but the 
 former were evidently the favorites in Bucks county. 
 The display of sheep, Berkshire and Suffolk hogs, and 
 poultry, were also very creditable. 

Fruit and vegetables in great variety were exhibited, 
 and of a size and quality surpassing all precedent in 
 Bucks county, and indeed rarely met with any where ; 
 and the other departments contained select specimens of 
 grain, articles of domestic economy, beautiful embroidery 
 and handiwork of the ladies, manufactured goods of 
 the ladies, also agricultural implements and machinery, 
 all contributed to make up a most interesting and highly 
 successful exhibition. 

Bucks county has this season surpassed herself as 
 well as her sister counties, in getting up and sustaining 
 two large exhibitions rapidly succeeding each other.
