THE FARM JOURNAL. 

In a formor volume we gave an engraving of a Horizontal 
 Hay Press, manufactured by Peering & Dickson of New 
 York, and now insert a cut of a Vertical Press, by the same 
 manufactu r ers, which we have heard highly commended. 

VEETICAL HAY PKESS. 

They are calculated for bales of 150 to 500 pounds, and vary 
 in price, exclusive of transportation, from $100 to $175. We 
 subjoin description by the manufacturer. 

The above Press, except in its upright position, is but 
 slightly different from the Horizontal. When the door C, 
 which, as in the cut of the other machine, is represented 
 open, is closed, the head U, is moved over to either side at 
 pleasure; the hay is then thrown in, and when the box is 
 full, the head is moved back again to the centre of the press 
 â€” the power being then applied to the parallel levers J K, 
 operated by the system of ropes and pullies, N R R, press 
 the Follower B up against the hay with the same simple and 
 mighty power exercised in the horizontal. The door C, and 
 also a similar door on the other side, is then opened; the 
 bale is bound, and the ends of it being relievod by releasing 

the end of the bar or handle D, it is taken out from either 
 side at pleasure. It is worthy of remark that the doors of 
 these presses do not have to be opened by pounding on any 
 part of them with mallets or crowbars, as in the ordinary 
 Hay Presses, but are opened very simply and easily, with 
 one hand. This Press, also is so constructed that it can be 
 taken apart for transportation, and, by the printed directions, 
 put up again without any aid from mechanics; while the 
 number of pieces for shipping is no greater and no less con- 
 veniently handled than the parts of the Horizontal. While 
 this is an excellent stationary press, it is also a conveniently 
 portable one; as, (weighing little more than the other press)
