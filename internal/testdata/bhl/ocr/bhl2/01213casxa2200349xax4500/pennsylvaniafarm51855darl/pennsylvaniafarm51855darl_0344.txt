it can be readily shoved up a couple of plank on a wagon, 
 or, by spiking on a pair of runners, it can be laid down and 
 moved, like the Horizontal, on the ground. The Horizontal 
 Press is, of course, the more convenient, but requires some 
 care in tramping in the hay in order to make a bale as nice 
 in appearance as that, under ordinary care, coming from the 
 vertical. We find that generally, particularly in the West- 
 ern and Southwestern States, this little extra care is quite 
 willingly taken, in order to possess this greater convenience; 
 while, on the other hand, those who are very particular 
 about the appearance of the bale, overlook this convenience, 
 and prefer the Vertical, which, with the exception of this 
 convenience, (which is possessed by no other than this Par- 
 allel Lever Horizontal,) is warranted to be, in all respects, 
 the simplest, most convenient, most compact, and powerful 
 Hay Press in the United States. 

Effects of Heat upon Meat. 
 A well cooked piece of meat should be full of its own 
 juice or natural gravy. In roasting, therefore, it should 
 be exposed to a quick fire, that the external surface may 
 be made to contract at once, and the albumen to coagu- 
 late, before the juice has had time to escape from within. 
 And so in boiling. When a piece of beef or mutton is 
 plunged into boiling water, the outer part contracts, the 
 albumen which is near the surface coagulates, and the 
 internal juice is prevented either from escaping into the 
 water by which it is surrounded, or from being diluted 
 or weakened by the admission of water among it. When 
 cut up, therefore, the meat yields much gravy, and is 
 rich in flavor. Hence a beef-steak or a mutton chop is 
 done quickly, and over a quick fire, that the natural 
 juices may be retained. On the other hand, if the meat 
 be exposed to a slow fire its pores remain open, the juice 
 continues to flow from within, as it has dried from the 
 surface, and the flesh pines, and becomes dry, hard, and 
 unsavory. Or if it be put into cold or tepid water, 
 which is afterwards gradually brought to a boil, much 
 of the albumen is extracted before it coagulates, the 
 natural juices for the most part flow out, and the meat 
 is served in a nearly tasteless state. Hence to prepare 
 good boiled meat, it should be put at once into water 
 already brought to a boil. But to make beef tea, mut- 
 ton broth, and other meat soups, the flesh should be put 
 into cold water, and this afterwards very slowly warmed, 
 and finally boiled. The advantage derived from sim- 
 mering, a term not unfrequent in cookery books, depends 
 very much upon the effects of slow boiling as above ex- 
 plained. — Chemistry of Common Life. 

Flour. 
 Those of our readers who are accustomed to glance 
 over the reports of market prices, from week to week, 
 must have noticed that while the common brands of flour 
 are from one to two dollars lower than they were two or 
 three months ago, "extra Genesee" is still quoted about 
 as high as ever. The question naturally arises, whether 
 this popular brand is worth the great difference in price 
 now demanded for it. We know there are multitudes of 
 families who will use nothing else. "Extra Genesee" 
 they must have, whatever the cost, and as the supply is 
 limited, the fortunate holders have been able to obtain 
 their own price. But whether this preference is a mei-e 
 whim, or is justified by the superior excellence of the 
 article in question, is a matter of some consequence to 

those of us who wish to use nothing but good flour, but 
 do not feel able to pay twelve or thirteen dollars per 
 barrel for it. Tho N. Y. Times has some information oa 
 this point, which deserves the consideration of every 
 prudent housekeeper. We give the gist of the article : 

"Now what is this 'Extra Genesee?' A number of 
 years since, the best flour was undoubtedly obtained 
 from wheat grown in the 'Genesee Country,' embracing 
 a dozen or more counties in Western New York. The 
 superior character of this flour was owing, in part, to 
 the excellent mills in that section. This fact having 
 become known among Eastern consumers, this flour ac- 
 quired an established reputation, which it has retained 
 long after there were any real grounds for the distinction. 
 Bakers, and those who use large quantities of flour, have 
 been aware of this, and it is seldom that we see the flour 
 unloading at their establishments marked with this obso- 
 lete brand. Equally good flour is now obtained from 
 wheat grown in Canada, Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illi- 
 nois and Wisconsin. But the great majority of families 
 still cling to the old brand as the only one worthy of 
 confidence. 

"The truth is, not one-fourth of the 'Extra Genesee 
 Flour' sold in this market is made from Genesee wheat. 
 As there is more champagne wine sold in New York city 
 alone than there is produced in the whole country where 
 that wine is native, so there is at least three times more 
 Genesee flour sold than is grown in the whole Genesee 
 country proper. Much of this brand of flour comes from 
 the extensive mills at Rochester, but it is well known 
 that those mills derive their principal supplies of wheat 
 from the Western States and the Canadas, and in this 
 case, Genesee flour means that made (not grown) in that 
 country, or rather upon the Genesee River. 

"The finest, whitest flour is that which contains the 
 greatest proportion of starch, but such flour is not by 
 any means best adapted to supplying the laboring man 
 with the elements of muscle or power. The dark South- 
 ern flour usually abounds in gluten — a substance more 
 nearly resembling human muscle ; and the man who is 
 obliged on Saturday night, from the seantiness of his 
 earnings, to send home a barrel of dark Southern flour, 
 may console himself with the certainty that his low price 
 flour will yield himself and family more of the needed 
 nourishment than that which would have left thirty to 
 fifty per cent, less of his hard earned money for other 
 necessities. 

"Our advice to tho mass of flour buyers is, to cease 
 to attach so much value to the outer marking upon flour 
 barrels. If not sufficiently experienced yourself to 
 judge of the quality, go to a reliable dealer and buy flour 
 warranted good. If your bread is not as ivhite as starch, 
 it may taste quite as well, if you are assured that it is 
 fully as nourishing, and remember at the same time that 
 it costs a great deal less money ; though if you throw 
 away your partiality for a particular brand, you will in 
 three times out of four get flour equally good for much 
 less money."
