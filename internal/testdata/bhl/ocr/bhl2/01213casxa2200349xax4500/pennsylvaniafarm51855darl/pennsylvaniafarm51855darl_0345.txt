The Farm Journal for 1856. 

We would not have our readers lose sight of the fact, 
 that with the December number closes the volume of 
 the Farm Journal. The time for the renewal of sub- 
 scriptions is, therefore, close at hand, and we are led to 
 hope that the kind friends, who, ever since the Journal 
 has been in existence, have lent it the aid of their influ- 
 ence and patronage, will continue their friendly efforts. 
 As will be seen by a reference to the prospectus, a 
 change will be made in the editorial department. The 
 editorship of the next volume will be placed under the 
 control of A. M. Spanglek, at present editor of the 
 Progressive Farmer, and formerly editor and publisher 
 of the Farm Journal. 

It is also contemplated to merge the Progressive Far- 
 mer and Farm Journal into one publication, by which 
 arrangement the services of many of the excellent con- 
 tributors to the Progressive Farmer will be secured for 
 the Farm Journal. In addition to this, other attractive 
 features will be presented in the course of the new vol- 
 ume, which can scarcely fail to render it fully equal to 
 the best agricultural periodical in the country. 

We, therefore, confidently ask, not only a continuance 
 of former patronage, but an increased support from the 
 friends of agriculture every where. A very little effort 
 will secure the desired object. There are few who are 
 now subscribers whose influence is not sufficiently great 
 to secure at least one subscriber, and in the majority of 
 cases, enough to make up a club. Will not each one do 
 us this service ? It requires but little time — involves no 
 expense, and the object secured by it will be the more 
 general diffusion of agricultural information. Such an 
 object is certainly a worthy one, and we hope to hear 
 that very many are engaged in its accomplishment. 

On Fattening Poultry. 

It is obvious that the value of any substance used as 
 a food for fattening animals can only be ascertained by 
 a reference to the relative quantity of warmth-giving, 
 flesh-forming, and fat-forming materials it contains ; and 
 such an examination will give us a true index of its 
 money value, and enable us to ascertain how far the 
 practice of feeders has been based upon right principles. 

Oats and Oatmeal. — Oats or oatmeal are perhaps 
 more largely employed than any other grain in fattening 
 poultry ; and in this case the experience of feeders 
 strikingly corresponds with the results afforded by sci- 
 entific examination. Oatmeal contains, in every 100 
 lbs., 6 lbs. of fat or oil, 18 lbs. of flesh-forming, and 63 
 lbs. of starchy materials ; oats contain the same quan- 
 tity of fat in every 100 lbs. ; but in consequence of the 
 large proportion of husk, the quantity of flesh-forming 
 and starchy substances is lessened to 15 lbs. of the for- 
 mer and 47 lbs. of the latter ; thus oats are not as val- 
 uable for fattening purposes as oatmeal — especially as, 
 from the presence of the husk, and their undivided state, 
 they are not so rapidly digested. 

Wheat and Bran, Middlings, &c. — Wheat, in its 
 entire state, contains only one-half the fatty materials 
 of oats, and hence it i3 not usually .employed in fatten- 
 ing ; the fat of wheat resides almost entirely in the 
 outer portions, which, when removed, constitute bran, 
 pollard, and middlings — the latter, or finest bran, has 

been remarked by Prof. J. Johnston as being almost 
 similar in its composition to oatmeal, being much richer 
 in both fat and flesh- forming food than the inner parts 
 of the grain. Its value in fattening pigs has been long 
 known ; and the writer can speak from long experience 
 that it is equally efficacious in fattening poultry. It 
 contains 6 lbs. of fat, 18 lbs. of flesh-forming, and about 
 53 lbs. of warmth-giving food in 100 lbs. 

Barley and Barlet-Meal. — Barley is not advanta- 
 geous as a fattening food, as its per centage of fat is 
 very low, being not more than 2 lbs. in every 100 lbs. 

Indian Corn. — Indian corn is remarkable for the large 
 quantity of oil contained in yellow varieties — nearly 8 
 lbs. in every 100 lbs. Its capability of supplying flesh 
 is not so great as that of oatmeal, hence it is not well 
 adapted for laying hens, which it renders too fat ; but 
 this peculiarity fits it remarkably for fattening poultry, 
 for which purpose it is largely employed in the United 
 States. 

Rice. — Rice is one of the least advantageous foods 
 either for fattening or supplying flesh ; it contains only 
 a trace of fatty materials, and less than half the quan- 
 tity of flesh-forming food contained in oats. 

Peas and Beans. — All the varieties of pulse contain 
 a much larger proportion of flesh-forming or nitrogenous 
 substances than any grain — in fact, about 25 per cent., 
 or double the quantity contained in wheat ; whilst the 
 proportion of fat is not more than 2 in the 100. This 
 composition admirably fits them for the support of the 
 animals undergoing much muscular exertion ; given to 
 fattening animals, they are apt to harden the fibre, as in 
 the well known case of bean-fed bacon ; and the elabo- 
 rate experiments of Mr. Lawes in pig and sheep-feeding 
 prove most distinctly that the increase in weight of a 
 fatting animal is dependent on the carbonaceous, and 
 not on the nitrogenous constituents of its food. 

Milk. — Milk is a most advantageous addition to the 
 food of poultry, as it contains 3 lbs. of fat (butter), and 
 nearly 5 lbs. of warmth-giving (sugar of milk), and 4 
 lbs. of flesh-forming food (curd), in every 100 lbs. 
 Skimmed milk, or butter milk, from having had the fat 
 removed, are by no means so advantageous. 

Animal Fat. — If any pure fat is given to fatting 
 fowls, it is evident, from what has been previously stated, 
 that it should be of as solid a character as possible, for 
 as it is assimilated without much change it is evident 
 that the firm character of the fatted poultry is much in- 
 creased by it. The evil effect of linseed-cake upon geese 
 has already been alluded to, arising from the liquid con- 
 dition of the oil contained in it ; the best addition to the 
 food of poultry consists, therefore, of the hardest and 
 cheapest variety of common fat, namely, mutton suet, 
 or what is equally good, the paring of the loins, which 
 are at present sold to the tallow melter. 

Cooking Food. — One other circumstance remains to 
 be considered in this section, namely, the alteration 
 effected in food by cooking. The influence of heat is 
 chiefly exerted, in the case of vegetable foods, on the 
 starch which constitutes so large a portion of all grain : 
 this in its natural state consists of small granules, which 
 are (as in the well known case of arrowroot, a very pure 
 variety of starch), insoluble in cold water, from the cir- 
 cumstance that each is coated with a firm membrane ;
