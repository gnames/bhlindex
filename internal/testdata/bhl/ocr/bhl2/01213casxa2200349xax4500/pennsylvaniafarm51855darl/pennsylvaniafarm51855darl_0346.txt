when heated to a degree somewhat short of boiling water, 
 this membrane cracks, and the interior gummy portion 
 of each granule dissolves in the water and thickens it. 
 There is no doubt but that starch, thus altered, is more 
 readily and rapidly digested than in its insoluble state ; 
 hence the advantage of cooked food for fattening pigs, 
 and the desirability of employing boiling water to scald 
 the meal used in fattening poultry. 

It may perhaps lead to easier understanding of the 
 relative value of the different kinds of food, if their con- 
 stituents are stated in a tabular form, it being borne in 
 mind that such statements are merely approximations to 
 the truth, as the ^composition of grain varies with the 
 character of the season and the soil.

More Imported Stock. 

To the Editor of the Farm Journal : — The ship Poto- 
 mac, Capt. Reed, from Liverpool, that reached this port 
 on the 6th inst., had on board seven head of Short-Horn 
 cattle and 14 Southdown sheep, all in high condition. 

The lot of cattle consists of one young bull of the 
 celebrated Booth stock and six heifers, obtained from 
 the most celebrated breeders in England. They are of 
 unsurpassed style and beauty. Several of them have 
 taken first prizes at the Royal Agricultural Fairs in 
 England. A portion of the sheep have also taken first 
 prizes, and are perhaps superior to any ever brought to 
 this country. 

The cattle and part of the sheep are for that wealthy 
 and spirited breeder of fine stock, R. Atcheson Alex 
 AKDEK, Esq., of Woodford county, Kentucky, who has 
 at this time a large herd of imported cattle, composed 
 of Short-Horns chiefly, with some Ayrshires and Alder- 
 neys. The balance of the sheep were for Col. L. G. 
 Monius, of Mount Fordham, Westchester county, N. Y. 
 Col. Morris is also a large imported and highly success- 
 ful breeder of the most valuable cattle, sheep, swine, &c. 

This fine lot of stock came consigned to my care, and 
 have been forwarded by me to their places of destination, 
 and will no doubt add much to the improvement of the 
 stock of their respective localities.

Prolific Character of Fruit Trees in California. 
 The editor of the California Farmer says : 
 "We can cite inumerable instances of peach trees 
 where evert/ peach on the tree was double, and several 
 cases where the peaches were triplets. Apples and pears 
 are found double, and melons in handsomely formed 
 pairs, twin grown. We know, however, that these facts 

are becoming so common, among those who are obser- 
 vant, that they are of every-day occurrence, but the 
 great mass of the people should know the abundance 
 that is soon to be poured out upon us. 

" The strawberry has already proved a perpetual fruit. 
 The fig gives us two crops, and ere long will yield three ; 
 and we hesitate not to 6ay that by and by, at every State 
 Fair, there will be exhibited many kinds of fruit of a 
 second crop, and several also of perpetual species, never 
 before known of that habit. We shall also have on ex- 
 hibition the second crops of our cereal grains, for how- 
 ever much we now have to boast of in this laud of plenty, 
 'the half has not yet been told.' " 

Earthing up Celery. 

The present season has been a favorable one for celery, as 
 indeed it has been for most crops, and celery will no doubt 
 be fine and plentiful. Where onlj- sufficient is grown for the 
 supply of the family, a little extra, care should be given to 
 earthing up, which is amply repaid by having clear sticks, 
 nicely blanched. For very early use a small portion should 
 be commenced as soon as large enough to draw earth to 
 taking care of its getting into the crown, which should be 
 carefully guarded against. The bulk of the crop will be 
 better left till towards the end of September before earthing. 
 If any manure water is obtainable before earthing, it is 
 much benefitted by having a good soaking, especially if the 
 ground is in any way poor, as it likes a very rich soil. 

In earthing, careful growers always go along first with 
 the hand, and pull off any little short leaves that would, if 
 buried, only rot, and draw the earth nicely about each plant. 
 A portion of the soil is then loosened up with the spade and 
 made tolerably fine, and pushed up towards the plants. If 
 they have been planted in trenches, if filled up level, it is 
 sufficient for the first time, giving it one or two good earth- 
 ings at intervals of one or two weeks. 

For field culture, or where the breadth is large, and grown 
 for market, recourse must be had to the plow, or the expense 
 would be too large to secure a return. Many earth up with 
 the plow without any handling of the plants, and with care 
 and caution are able to do it without disturbing the leaves 
 much ; but as a general rule, it will pay to draw a little to 
 them first, with a hoe or the hand, as if a clod gets on the 
 heart of the plant, the leaves get twisted and bent, and are 
 worth less in the market. Except the soil is mellow, celery 
 will hardly pay as a crop, from the difficulty there is in got- 
 ting the earth sufficiently fine about the leaves. — Country

Guano for Insects. 
 A correspondent of the Horticulturist says: — "Some time 
 last summer while budding some young peaches, I found 
 that ants had taken possession of some ten feet in one row. 
 They very earnestly resisted my attempts to inoculate the 
 tree, inflicted many unpleasant wounds on my hands and 
 arms. In order to disperse the warlike little nation, I 
 sprinkled near a pint of fine guano along the little ridgos. 
 This threw them into immediate consternation. I noticed 
 little collections of winged ants huddled close together, and 
 seoining to be quiet, while those without wings ran about in 
 great agitation. The following day not an insect could be 
 found, where the day previous they appeared to bo innu- 
 merable. 

Roses. — According to Agassiz, no fossils of the rose 
 have ever yet been discovered by geologists. He thinks 
 the creation of the plant is coeval with that of man.
