 bull of Mr. Merrynian and the herd of Mr. McHonry were

 gentlemen as careful and judicious breeders, and we promise 
 them, in the name of the Society, a cordial welcome upon all 
 future similar occasions.

No. 8 — Working Oxen. 
 Hon. James Gowen, President : — The undersigned your 
 Committee to examine Working Cattle report. They regret 
 that so very few of that useful class of animals have been 
 submitted for their examination. 

In our judgment oxen afford the most economical draft 
 for farmers of small means and rough land. Patient and 
 enduring, they will labor on less grain feed than any other 
 animal. From two to four years of age, they will perform 
 their daily toil and then be valuable for the shambles. The 
 whole cost of fixtures would be less than the repairs of the 
 harness of horses or mules for a single year, and can be put 
 on and taken off in less time. 

Of those exhibited we were much pleased with Wm. Metz- 
 ger, of Harrisburg, one yoke working cattle, and to him 
 award the first premium of $20 

To G. Crossland, of TJniontown, Fayette co., we award the 
 2d premium of 10

 And to the sanio person for best fat steer, 15

No. 10 — Milch Cows. 

To James Gowen, Esq., President of the State Agricultural 
 Society : — The undersigned being the Judges appointed on 
 No. 10 of Class 1 respectfully report : 

That on examining the list of Judges, and comparing it 
 with the premium list, they find that Judges have been ap- 
 pointed to award premiums for the best cows of all the dif- 
 ferent breeds exhibited on the ground, leaving the under- 
 signed, as they inferred, the duty of awarding premiums to 
 the best, second and third best cow, as proven by the quan- 
 tity of milk and the amount of butter made from such milk 
 within the given periods, and under the circumstances set 
 forth in the instructions given under the head of Milch 
 Cows, without regard to the breed or character of the stock 
 from which such cows spring. 

The value of a cow as a milker is best tested by the quan- 
 tity of milk, and the quantity of butter or cheese, which she 
 will yield during a whole season ; but as it could not be ex- 
 pected that any person would keep an accurate account of 
 the produce of one or more cows for so long a period, and 
 6till less should we expect that two or more persons would 
 keep their cows exactly alike in reference to provender, 
 pasture, &c, during a whole season, the Executive Commit- 
 tee seem to have thought the nearest approximation to an 
 accurate result would bo to place the cows upon an equality,
