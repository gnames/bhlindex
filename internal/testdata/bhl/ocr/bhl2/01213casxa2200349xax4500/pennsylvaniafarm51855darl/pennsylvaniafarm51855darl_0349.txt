AT THE FIFTH ANNUAL EXHIBITION. 

as near as could be, in regard to their keeping for a limited 
 time, and ascertain the exact amounts of milk and butter 
 which such cows would yiold during the time of trial. 

Under this view of the subject, the undorsigned did not 
 suppose that it would be required to have the cows entered 
 for competition under the head of "Milch Cows" on tho ex- 
 hibition ground, or that the Judges of Class 1, No. 10, 
 should take any notice of the condition or appearance of the 
 animal, but in their decision be guided and governed by the 
 statement required in the instructions contained in the pre- 
 mium list. On application to the Secretary for statements 
 deposited in reference to this subject, they found that no 
 such statements had been furnished, consequently there was 
 no competition of "Milch Cows" under the instructions 
 given, and nothing left for the undersigned to do. 

Whilst the undersigned do not repine at being thus re- 
 lieved from duty, they cannot forbear expressing their re- 
 gret that so important a branch of domestic economy should 
 be so little appreciated" by the farmers of Pennsylvania. 
 Milch Cows form part of the stock of every farmer, and the 
 difference between a good cow and a bad one, each requiring 
 the same amount of care and feed, is so apparent, that it 
 ought to arrest the attention of every agriculturist. Nor is 
 it the agriculturist alone that is interested in this subject. 
 In this happy land of peace and plenty, every mechanic re- 
 siding in the country, and every frugal and industrious la- 
 borer, can afford to, and generally does, keep a cow; and 
 even those who inhabit cities and towns, where cows cannot 
 be conveniently kept, find milk, butter and cheese indispen- 
 sable articles in thoir families, and are, therefore, all inter- 
 ested in producing the greatest amount of those necessary 
 articles of food at the least expense. And, although the 
 test proposed by the Agricultural Society would not make 
 the farmers' cows yield more milk, it would have served to 
 show the difference between a good cow and an indifferent 
 one, and it was hoped would arouse the attention of the 
 farming community from the apathy which seems to prevail 
 on this important subject. The Agricultural Society cannot 
 be subjected to any censure for the indifference manifested 
 on this subject; the premiums offered on this branch of the 
 exhibition, when compared with others, taking into view tho 
 risk, trouble and expense to be incurred, will be found very 
 liberal ; and if those who are most deeply interested cannot 
 be induced to make some effort to improve their Milch Cows, 
 we must permit them to go on in the old way, in which they 
 milk their cows one-half the season, and the cows milk them 
 the other half. All of which is respectfully submitted.

No. 11 — Special Premiums. 

To James Gowen, President of the Pennsylvania State 
 Agricultural Society : — The Judges appointed to award spe- 
 cial premiums for animals that have taken the first premium 
 at our previous exhibitions report : 

That one horse and three cows wero the only animals en- 
 tered for these premiums, and the Committee concur in re- 
 porting that the horse called "Clifton," entered by James 
 Reed, of Dauphin, is entitled to the first premium of $50, 
 he having taken the first premium at the State Fair at Lan- 
 caster in 1852. No other horse being entered the Judges 
 have not awarded the second premium. 

The Judges have been involved in difficulty in awarding 
 the premium upon cows ; one of their number being of opin- 
 ion that it was intended to class the breeds of animals to 
 which special premiums are to be awarded, and not put 

different breeds in competition with each other. They re- 
 port it, however, as their unanimous judgment, that the Dur- 
 ham cow called " Sally," entered by John Evans, of York, 
 is entitled to the first premium of $50, and that the Durham 
 cow "Isabella," entered by James Gowen, of Philadelphia, 
 is entitled to the second promium of $30. The only other 
 cow entered was a Devon, which took the first premium at 
 Pittsburg. Caleb Caunalt,
