 The Committee with pleasure mention Joseph Like, A\ r m. 
 H. Smith, Rufus Russel, J. P. Smith, Amos Ilersh & Co., 
 Gideon Peirce, S. C. Brinsers, and Sebastian Keller, as 
 exhibitors of agricultural implements, and award them each 
 five dollars. It is worthy of note that the display in this 
 department was larger than in any other, and as this is de- 
 sirable in consequence of the fact that the articles belong 
 more peculiarity to the object the Society has in view, it 
 would seem to be important that the Committee should be 
 subdivided. Your Committee endeavored to look at every 
 article, so that nothing should be omitted, but owing to the 
 great variety, were unable to give that particular examina- 
 tion which they should have liked, and which perhaps some 
 of them merited.

No. 19 — Farm Implements, No. 2. 
 To the President of the Pennsylvania State Agricultural 
 Society : — Committee No. 19 report that they have made 
 the following awards and premiums ; taking occasion to 
 remark that it was with difficulty they were enabled to find 
 some of the articles assigned for their examination, leading 
 them at once to suggest, that hereafter the space assigned 
 tor implements of this character have for their accommoda- 
 tion, a building divided into three or four parts, according 
 to the sub-divisions of the catalogue of premium, and that a 
 gallery or space be designated for each, with their numbers, 
 requiring all depositors to so arrange their articles, so that 
 all would come under one roof. The display would bo 
 decidedly more attractive, and the comfort of Judges im- 
 measurably enhanced. 

The churn to which the first premium is awarded, is ex- 
 hibited by Samuel Waring, of Franklinville, New York, 
 Dickeson's improved thermometer; the merits of the one 
 exhibited being simplicity of construction, combined with 
 rapidity of work. The test applied was this — one gallon of 
 sweet cream, one gallon new milk, exposed to the cool air for 
 three hours, when placed in tho churn, 10 degrees below the 
 temperature proper to prepare milk for churning; butter 
 was mado and gathered in 10 minutes 55 seconds. Tho 
 award was a silver medal. 

To Paschall Morris & Co., Philadelphia, for the best dis- 
 play of Spain's atmospheric churns, bronze medal. 
 To A. Fink, Harrisburg, for a useful and well constructed 

churn, bronze medal. 

To Boyer & Bro„ Harrisburg, for an excellent display of 
 a variety of churns, diploma. 

There was but a single cheese presss on exhibition. We 
 do not consider it a first rate article, or such a one as the 
 mechanical ingenuity of the country should produce. Under 
 these circumstances we award to Paschall Morris & Co., by 
 whom it was exhibited, a premium of $3 

To Boyor Bro., Harrisburg, for 12 best milk pans, 3 • 

To A. J. Tager, Harrisburg, for best potato mashers, diploma. 
 To Boyer & Bro., for best grain cradler, $2
