The Committee have taken occasion to depart in several 
 instances from the schedule of premiums, because they found 
 it impossible in the mass of articles numbered 17, 18, 19 and 
 20, unassorted as they were, to make the discrimination de- 
 signed by tho Society. 

This Committee deem it proper to recommend that in future 
 exhibitions a permanent and comfortable structure bo erected 
 for the accommodation of the Judges, furnished in such 
 mannor as will enable gentlemen who have an onerous, tire- 
 some and vexatious labor, to perforin their tasks with a 
 certain degree of comfort, which, under the present system, 
 it is impossible to do, where it ought to be done upon the 
 spot whero the articles are exhibited.
