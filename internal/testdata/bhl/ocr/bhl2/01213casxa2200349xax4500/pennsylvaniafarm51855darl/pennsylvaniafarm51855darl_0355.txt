 There were a number of sweep horse powers, besides those 
 already noticed, but there being nothing new or peculiar in 

their construction your committee deem them to be good 
 machines. 

, If any omission has occurred the committee would attrib- 
 ute it to the difficulty in finding many of the exhibitors and 
 to the heterogeneous manner in which articles-intended for 
 the inspection of committees 18, 19 and 20 wore numbered 
 aud mixed. The undersigned would respectfully suggest, 
 that hereafter, a suitable building be erected, with three or 
 more apartments properly numbered, and articles of this 
 class could then be numbered and placed each in its proper 
 apartment. Also that there should be a committee whoso 
 sole duty it would be to inspect horse powers and threshors 
 — one for reapers and mowers — one for corn shelters, <fcc. 
 Such an arrangement would render the present irksome and 
 vexatious duties of the committees an easy and agreeable 
 task. David Cocklev,
