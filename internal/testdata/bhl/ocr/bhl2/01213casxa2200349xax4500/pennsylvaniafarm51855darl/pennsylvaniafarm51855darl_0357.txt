old. The time was from 29th August for twenty days. 
 The cows all calved early in the spring, and the yield 
 was not more than the average of the whole milking 
 season. The cows were fed upon grass and a small 
 quantity of green corn stalks. The quantity was one 
 pound three ounces per day, or one hundred and eight 
 and one-ljalf pounds for the five cows in twenty days. 
 The whole dairy of thirteen cows would average nearly 
 the same for the season. 

The milk was churned by a dog-churn, and the pro- 
 cess is the same as that reported at vol. 1, page , of 
 the Society's Transactions. Wm. Jessup. 

The cheese exhibited by Job Hayes, of Chester county, 
 made in July and August, from a dairy of thirty cows. 
 The cheese made from two milkings, and no additional 
 cream ; one rennet steeped in half gallon of water, with 
 salt sufficient to preserve it, adding one pint to twenty 
 gallons of milk, then placed in a vat and pressed under 
 a pressure of about seven hundred pounds weight, re- 
 maining in press forty-eight hours, and turned twice a 
 day, then kept in a warm dry place and turned every 
 day. Add two pounds of salt to one hundred pounds.

I do hereby certify that five cows of my dairy made in 
 thirty consecutive days one hundred and seventy-three 
 pounds of butter, and had no extra feed. Job Hates. 

We, the undersigned, assisted in milking and making 
 the above, and believe it to be correct.

Receipt for Making Butter. 
 After the milk is drawn from the cows, placed in the 
 spring in the pans, remain thirty-six hours, then skimmed. 
 Churned twice each week, butter taken from churn, and 
 buttermilk worked out, then salted, remain about twelve 
 hours, then worked over by one of Dickey's patent but- 
 ter workers, then printed for market, adding half ounce 
 to the pound of good dairy salt.

The cheese here exhibited by Hannah M. Hayes, of 
 Chester county, was made in July, 1855, of two milk- 
 ings, no additional cream ; rennet prepared by steep- 
 ing one in half gallon of water, with sufficient salt to 
 preserve it. Pressed in common screw press, with about 
 seven hundred weight to fifty pounds of cheese. 

No. 23 — Flour and Corn Meal. 
 To James Gowen, Esq., President : — The undersigned, 
 members of the Committee on Flour, Corn Meal, &c, 
 report, that in the absence of Messrs. Small, McCully 
 and Suavely, Mr. John S. Isett, of Huntingdon county, 
 was added to the Committee, after which they proceeded 
 to discharge their duties. There was not presented for 
 their examination so great a variety of the different ar- 
 ticles, upon the merits of which it became their duty to 
 decide, as they could have desired ; or as properly re- 
 presented the resources and inventive capacity of the 
 Commonwealth. There were five or six brands of flour 
 deposited for their inspection, the quality of which was 
 generally of a very superior character. Two of the un- 

dersigned were of opinion, that (owing to its having 
 been manufactured out of old wheat, which gave him a 
 decided advantage,) the barrel of flour deposited by Mr. 
 John Nelson, of Blair county, Pa., was slightly prefera- 
 ble to the next sample named, and accordingly award to 
 him a Silver Medal. They also award to Messrs. Wilson 
 and McCullough, of Harrisburg, a Silver Medal, for tho 
 best barrel of flour manufactured from new wheat; one 
 of your committee conceives the latter sample to be bet- 
 ter than the former. For the third best barrel, they 
 award a Bronze Medal to Mr. J. S. Haldeman, of Shire- 
 manstown, Cumberland county, Pa. They would re- 
 commend that in future competitors be required to man- 
 ufacture their samples from wheat of the current year. 
 They award to George H. Bucher, Esq., of Hogestown, 
 a Silver Medal, for best barrel corn meal. They award 
 a Silver Medal to Mr. Henry Becker, of Harrisburg, for 
 the best five loaves of bakers' bread, and a Diploma to 
 Mr. Curry Taylor, of the same place, for the second 
 best. Both the above samples are very superior, and 
 were manufactured from the flour of Messrs. Wilson & 
 McCullough, of Harrisburg. Their attention was called 
 to several valuable and ingenious smut and screening 
 machines, either of which deserves honorable notice, and 
 would prove an invaluable acquisition to the manufactu- 
 rer of flour. They award the first premium, a Silver 
 Medal, to Thomas H. Wilson & Co., of Harrisburg, for 
 best smut machine, and a Bronze Medal for the second 
 best to Mr. S. M. McCutcheon, of Philadelphia. Within 
 the last few years, it was discovered that under the old 
 system of bolting a considerable quantity of flour ad- 
 hered to bran that formerly was supposed to have been 
 perfectly dressed. The ingenuity of our countrymen 
 furnished a number of machines for remedying this de- 
 fect in milling operations, several of which were exhibi- 
 ted to your Committee, and gave promise of adding 
 largely to the proportion of flour manufactured from a 
 given quantity of wheat. The list unfortunately, as we 
 think, does not provide for premiums to that class of 
 machinery. Should the rules and means of the Society 
 justify it, we advise special premiums as follows : to 
 Thos. H. Wilson & Co., of Harrisburg, for "the World's 
 Challenging Bran Duster," a Silver Medal ; and to M. 
 Beidler & S. S. Levis, of Indiana, a Bronze Medal, for 
 the second best. It is to be regretted that the price of 
 these articles, ranging as they do from $150 to $250, 
 precludes their general introduction. We trust that 
 some of our enterprising countrymen will speedily fur- 
 nish a machine, combining all the advantages of those 
 to which we have called attention, with such a price as 
 will place it within the reach of mills of small capacity. 
 Mr. Wilson Ager, of Rhorersburg, Columbia county, 
 furnished a superior sample of buckwheat meal ; and 
 Mr. C. L. Wampole, of Oakland Place, Montgomery 
 county, deposited a very excellent article of rye flour. 
 Both these samples excel any thing in their line that has 
 ever come under our observation, and we cordially re- 
 commend a diploma to each of the exhibitors. 
 Respectfully yours,
