Apples. 
 To Jacob Cocklin, Cumberland co., for the best and great- 
 est number of choice varieties, (in all 180 varieties,) 
 the first premium of $10

 larly worthy of note.]

 To S. C. Slaymaker, Lancaster co., for best collection of

 Jacob Hite, of Harrisburg, G. W. Bucher and James Ander- 
 son, Hogestown, W. Verbeke, John Brightbill, John Bankers, 
 Thomas Wood, Wm. Hummell and George A. Steel. We 
 regret that we wore not empowered to award premiums to 
 some of these. A collection of 30 varieties, from E. A. 
 Vickroy, of Cambria co., could not be found on the ground, 
 having been probably miscarried in their journey to Harris- 
 burg. This was greatly regretted by the officers of the 
 Society, who made special efforts to find this, no doubt 
 particularly valuable collection. Specimens of the best 
 apples of the season, including Porter Dyer, Hardy Summer 
 Pearman, Sweet Bellflower, and the Pride of September and 
 Sink, two very showy and excellent apples, natives of Centra 
 county, shown by Wm. G. Waring, were not in competition. 

Cranberries. 
 To Miss Harriet Summy, Manheim, for best peck, domes- 
 tic culturo, $3 
 A rooted vine, loaded with fruit, was exhibited— a beauti- 
 ful object.
