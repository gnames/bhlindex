LIST OF PREMIUMS AWARDED 

Pears. 
 We found a very largo and varied collection of this fruit, 
 the finest varieties of which now attract such general atten- 
 tion from cultivators, and prove so thoroughly adapted to 
 our climate. The specimens shown were universally fair 
 and handsome, and the display will greatly henefit fruitists 
 and the public in general, by its illustration of the variety 
 and high excellence of the best pears, compared with those 
 in ordidary culture. 

To R. Buist, Philadelphia, for the best collection, 60 
 varieties, the first premium of silver medal.
