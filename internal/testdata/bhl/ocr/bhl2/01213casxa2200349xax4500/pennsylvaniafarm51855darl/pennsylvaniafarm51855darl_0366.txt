No. 36 — Farm Buildings. 
 To the Executive Committee of the Pennsylvania State 
 Agricultural Society : — The undersigned, members of the 
 Committee on Farm Buildings, report, that there has 
 been no competition for the premiums offered for "the 
 best and the second best plans of farm buildings, with 
 descriptions thereof." This failure your Committee at- 
 tributed to the fact, that being the first premiums offered 
 by the Society for these objects, they have not come 
 under the notice of architects and builders. The impor- 
 tance of continuing the premiums at future exhibitions, 
 with a view to improvement in the location and con- 
 struction of the various buildings required on the farm, 
 must be obvious to every one who will reflect upon the 
 subject. The selection of the most healthy and pleasant 
 site for the location, to combine permanence, economy, 
 convenience, symmetry, and beauty, in the construction 
 of the buildings, are objects, the attainment of which 
 cannot be too highly appreciated in a community in 
 which many — very many — of the farm buildings are badly 
 constructed, and placed upon the very ends and corners 
 of the farms, and even in the ravines and swamps, under 
 the mistaken hypothesis that the requisite supply of 
 good cold water could be had no where else, as though 
 we lived in that part of Peru where rain never falls, in- 
 stead of Pennsylvania, in which we have from the clouds 
 an average annual supplg of four feet of the very best 
 water nature affords. All which is most respectfully 
 submitted. H. N. McAllister,

Committee. 
 P. S. — On Thursday evening, after the Committee had 
 made their report and adjourned, a plan of farm build- 

ings, with description thereof, by Edward Kohler, of 
 North Whitehall, Lehigh county, Pa., was handed to the 
 chairman of the Committee. Although the regulations 
 of the Society had not in any respect been complied 
 with, the chairman asked and obtained leave to note the 
 facts in a postscript, and to attach the plan to the re- 
 port, which is done. H. N. McAllister. 

No. 37 — Musical Instruments. 

To James Goiven, Esq., President: — The Committee to 
 whom was referred the examination of "Musical Instru- 
 ments" respectfully report, that this department was 
 represented on a scale commensurate with the great im- 
 provement in that branch of the mechanic arts. 

J. E. Gould, of Philadelphia, exhibited three pianos 
 from the manufactory of Hallett, Davis & Co., of Boston, 
 one 7^ octave, Louis XIV, one 7 octave, plain case, one 
 6^ octave, Louis XIV, all of superior tone and finish. 
 There was also one from the house of Bacon & Raven, 
 New York, 6J octave, plain case, which fully sustains 
 the reputation of this well-known house. 

Nicholas Steinhauser, of Lancaster, Pa., had on exhi- 
 bition one 6£ octave piano. This instrument was manu- 
 factured within our own borders, and does credit to the 
 State as well as the manufacturer. 

Rufus Nutting, of Randolph, Vermont, exhibited an 
 instrument combining the various powers of the piano, 
 melodeon, seraphine, &c, which excels the later in the 
 simplicity of its construction and in the power and va- 
 riety of its expression. It; gives the Committee great 
 pleasure to concur in the numerous testimonials awarded 
 the inventor for his ingenious instrument, the JEolicon. 

The Committee have awarded the premiums as follows: 
 To Hallett, Davis & Co., Boston, for the 1\ octave, 

first premium, a silver medal. 

To Nicholas Steinhauser, for his 6^ actave, second 

premium, a diploma. 

To Rufus Nutting, for his ^Eolicon, a diploma. 

AVe cannot close this report without gratefully acknowl- 
 edging the assistance rendered us by Messrs. J. Ptasyk 
 and Joseph Kohler, of Harrisburg. The judgment, taste 
 and experience of these gentlemen relieved your Com- 
 mittee from much of the responsibility attending the 
 discharge of their duty. Mrs. Wm. Sergeant, 
 Mrs. Wm. H. Miller, 
 Miss Sophie Jones,
