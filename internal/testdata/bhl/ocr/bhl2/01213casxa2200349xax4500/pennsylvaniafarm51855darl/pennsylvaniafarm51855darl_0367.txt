Nutrition in Plants and Animals. â€” In this article 
 we shall endeavor to show that lessons most instructive 
 and deeply interesting, which greatly facilitate the ac- 
 quisition of correct views of the physiology of animals, 
 may be obtained, if we will only come to the plant for 
 instruction. The differences amongst the organic pro- 
 ductions of nature are not so great as is usually sup- 
 posed. There is a oneness in nature which has yet to 
 be understood and appreciated. 

Nutrition has for its object a double end. It conveys 
 to the organic being without ceasing, the substances ne- 
 cessary to maintain the integrity of its organs, and to 
 repair the losses occasioned by the movements of vitality; 
 it also furnishes the material required for the increase of 
 the organs and the development of new parts. Nutrition 
 is in principle precisely the same in both animals and 
 plants. In this respect it is philosophically as well 
 as scripturally true, that "all flesh is grass." This 
 function, as exercised in plants and animals, is a very 
 complicated process, and implies several distinct acts. 
 1. The introduction of food into the organism (absorp- 
 tion). 2. Its disti-ibution to all its parts (circulation). 
 3. The elaboration of the nutritive fluid by contact with 
 the air (respiration). 4. The elimination of effete matter 
 (excretion). 5. The formation of the nutritive material 
 into the tissues or substance of the organism (assimila- 
 tion). We proceed to compare these several processes 
 in the plant and animal. 

1. The introduction of food into the organism (absorp- 
 tion). This process is greatly simplified in the plant, 
 which lives as it were in the midst of its food, -with 
 which its organs are in perpetual contact. We have 
 shown how beautifully the subterranean and atmospheric 
 ramifications of the stem are organised with reference to 
 the two media in which the plant developes ; and that 
 food is absorbed into the organism of the plant from the 
 atmosphere by the porous surface of the leaves, and 
 from the soil by the fibrous extremity of the roots. 
 Analysis shows that the material of which the organism 
 of plants is composed is principally catbon and the ele- 
 ments of water, hydrogen and oxygen, to which is to be 
 added an inconsiderable portion of earthy matter, which 
 enters the plant along with the water absorbed from the 
 353 

soil. As the plant is elaborated for the most part out of 
 water and air, its food comes into contact with its organs 
 in a condition fit for absorption, entering the organism 
 in accordance with the laws of capillarity and endosmo- 
 sis, which are beautifully exemplified in the nutrition of 
 plants. 

It is far otherwise with animals. Air and water will 
 not suffice for their nourishment. They require more 
 solid and substantial food, and are provided with suita- 
 ble organs for its prehension and preparation. In man, 
 whose wants are infinitely more numerous than that of 
 the inferior creatures, these organs exist in the highest 
 condition of development. He is provided with a hand, 
 which may be justly regarded as the most perfect of 
 prehensile instruments. To the skilful use of this or- 
 gan, under the guidance of reason, he owes his superior- 
 ity over the other animals, whose superior members are 
 more for the support of their bodies than for the seizure 
 of objects. The other organs consist of an alimentary 
 tube or canal, more or less dilated in its course through 
 the body. At the upper portion of this canal there is 
 an opening called the mouth, which is provided with an 
 appropriate arrangement of teeth for cutting and crush- 
 ing the food, and of salivary glands for effecting its lu- 
 brication. The food having been thus ground and lubri- 
 cated in the mouth, descends into the digestive cavity or 
 stomach, where it is acted upon by the gastric juice se- 
 creted by the walls of that organ, and ultimately con- 
 verted into a fluid of a whitish color named chyle, which 
 as soon as it is formed, is absorbed by the radicles of a 
 system of vessels named chyliferous vessels or lacteals, 
 these re-unite into branches more or less voluminous, 
 and ultimately meet in a common trunk called the thora- 
 cic duct. This duct, which is about the size of a com- 
 mon quill, conveys the chyle to its point of junction with 
 the subclavian vein at the lower part of the neck, pour- 
 ing into the torrent of the circulation. The blood thus 
 becomes enriched by this addition to its constituents of 
 the nutritive material, which speedily becomes spread to 
 all parts of the organism, by means of the successive 
 ramifications of the conveying tubes of the arterial and 
 capillary system. 

The absorption of food into the organism of animaia 
 and plants is therefore in principle precisely the same 
 thing, with this difference, that there is superadded to 
 the animal a highly complicated nervo-muscular appara- 
 tus for its prehension and preparation. The introduc- 
 tion of food into the digestive cavity or stomach is
