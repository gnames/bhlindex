from another — whose only principle is centered in the " loaves 
 and fishes." But we do mean that system of ethics which 
 regards the honor of the State and the welfaro, the prosperity 
 and interests of its people. To this you are bound to look, 
 or failing, to be abused and your interests trampled on. 

Have you ever given yourselves the trouble to inquire 
 whether the existing laws give sufficient protection to your 
 rights and property ? Has it been the subject of reflection 
 with you, that the value of all your possessions is dependant 
 upon the protection which the law affords them? Do you 
 know, and if you do, have you inquired into the reason why, 
 that to steal a shilling from a merchant's desk is a crime, 
 whilst to steal your fruit or your growing corn, or to tear 
 down and carry away your fences, is no criminal offence at 
 all? That whilst the merchant's shilling is protected by the 
 fear of solitary confinement and labor, you are referred to the 
 tardy and fruitless process of a civil remedy to recover dam- 
 ages from the worthless thief. Has it never occurred to you 
 that you have not been sufficiently felt in the Legislature of 
 your own State to demand a redress of such evils; for these 
 are but some of them. Have you been taught by the history 
 of the age in which you live, that whilst, at the bidding of 
 political power, light-houses, buoys and breakwaters are 
 springing into existence to enrich the merchant, tariffs are 
 enacted to protect the mechanic and the manufacturer — that 
 whilst military tactics and engineering are taught at the ex- 
 pense of the government, ships and men are employed in the 
 Bcience of meteorology — and rights and inventions protected 
 by public laws, there is no care for you. That when a con- 
 tract of commerce and navigation, clothed under specious 
 disguise of a "reciprocal treaty," is to be formed, and by 
 which you are to be met by foreign competition in the gatos 
 of your own domestic market, your interests are no where. 
 Amidst all the discussions which you have heard or read of 
 these departments of the government who so admirably man- 
 age the education of the army and navy; and who carefully 
 protect the interest of commerce and navigation, have you 
 ever heard of a department of agriculture ? Is there even a 
 bureau or a clerk, except that excressence which illegiti- 
 mately hangs on the skirts of the Patent Office, which throws 
 any protection over your interests, that are threefold greater 
 than the aggregate of all the rest ? 

We put these questions that your attention may be drawn 
 to the fact, that neither the numbers you count, nor the great 
 importance of the business in which you are engaged, has 
 ever given you that rank in society which secures for you all 
 the blessings of a well managed government. Our object 
 too, is to ask of you to look seriously at this subject, to as- 
 sert boldly and fearlessly your rights and your wants and to 
 stand together and by your numbers command respect. 

But to effect this there must be mind, there must be culti- 
 vated mind; for we should never cease to remember that 
 intellect is that " talent" which the goodness of God bestowed 
 upon the creature of his own image, not that it should be 
 buried in the earth, and restored upon the return of its Lord 
 and Master, in its original simplicity, but that it should be 
 cultivated, enlarged and appropriated to his great design. 
 It is demanded of us all, then, that we should put our hand 
 to the noble work of education ; and, especially, that we 
 should directjthat education by a course of study which will 
 fit the mind and adapt the energies of the body to that ex- 
 pansive, interesting and delightful subject in which you are 
 engaged, and for which the world has yet done so little. 
 , I trust that you are already impressed with the idea, that 
 there is no reason why knowledge is not turned to the profit- 
 able account of the farmer, as well as the lawyer, the mer- 
 chant, or the statesman; and when we speak of profitable 
 account, we mean that gain which not only increases our 

worldly possessions, but fits us for the gratifying association 
 of each other; for the appreciation of the work of our own 
 hands ; for teaching whilst we aro yet being taught, and for 
 the intelligent understanding of all those elements and rules, 
 too, of God's creation, with which wo habitually deal. 

The education which is diffused by the literary institutions 
 of the present day, is unprofitable for you. And whilst we 
 would not detract by thought, much less by expression, from 
 the value of their teachings, preparatory to the pursuit of 
 professional life, yet we cannot but look upon that sedentary 
 process of a boy's study, and the brilliant result of his aca- 
 demic honors, as the attainment of a state of total unfitness 
 for the practical art which you pursue. His body is without 
 that muscular strength which gives energy and activity; his 
 hands too soft and dolicate to grapple with the implements 
 of agriculture. But especially has his mind received those 
 impressions of the pursuits of aftor life, and that view of the 
 smooth and easy path by which he is to follow some one of 
 them, as to make him turn with fear, if not disgust, from the 
 fireside of his own father. In his youthful estimation he has 
 so far outstripped his brothers and sisters, and even his pa- 
 rents, in the delicate conventionalities of life, as to make his 
 association as disagreeable to Aim as it is irksome and formal 
 to them. 

It is a serious reflection, that in all the progress which 
 the art of teaching has mado ; that in all the advantages 
 which the learned institutions offer for the instruction of our 
 youth, our country yet affords no school where the combined 
 science and art of agriculture are taught. It is permitted to 
 grovel along without the aid of other than the common mind, 
 educated in the mere common school. 

Looking, then, at the mass of mankind who pursue the 
 occupation of the farmer ; at the immense amount of capital 
 in their hands and under their guidance, a spirit of philan- 
 thropy should be excited, principles of political economy 
 .•wakened, and that virtuous ambition which always stirs the 
 hearts of men to deeds of noble action, should prompt you 
 to devise some plan by which the hands and hearts and 
 minds of youth should bo made to work together in the ac- 
 quisition of that kind of knowledge which will give to a 
 farmer and his pursuits, that interest which will command 
 the energies of his mind, as well as the labor of his body, 
 and induce him to take that elevated rank in his intercourse 
 with men which that knowledgo will give him. 

Regarding tho personal comfort, contented spirit and daily 
 happiness of the farmer, this subject commends itself to your 
 consideration. The body whose uneducated mind has never 
 been elevated to the capacity of reason, whose ideas have 
 never been enlightened to contemplate the light and life 
 which exists in every atom of God's creation with which he 
 habitually works, goes to his daily labor as a measured task, 
 having in it no other interest than the lapse of time for 
 which he must toil. But he whoso enlightened intellect 
 grasps the subject of his work; who can soe the beautiful 
 workings of Providence in imbedding germinating life in the 
 bosom of a seed ; who can understand the powers and chem- 
 ical combinations of the earth, which causes that germ to 
 spring into existence and life, " to bear fruit after its own 
 kind ;" who can appreciate the beauty and mechanism of 
 that plant Providentially, and thorefore, wisely constructed 
 to meet the exigencies of heat and cold, drought and wet; 
 who can look upon the mysterious workings of the mouths 
 and lungs of the earth itself, whilst they gather food and 
 light but to disseminate them through the organs of plants ; 
 who can examine with the eye of a mechanic, the implement 
 of his art, and measure its fitness for the object of its employ- 
 ment. Ho it is who has elevated himself to the standard of 
 a man; who has softened down the toil of labor to a pleasant
