occupation ; who has afforded tho example to the world, that 
 the pursuit of agriculture is the pursuit of learning and hap- 
 piness, as well as wealth. 

How is this, so desirable an end to be accomplished? In 
 a word : by the adoption of a system of education which will 
 combine the appropriate teaching of the mental and physical 
 powers of men, and to give it practical effect, that such 
 teaching be conducted upon the principle and in the spirit 
 of enlarged economy. That whilst its advantages are brought 
 ■within reach of those certain yet moderate gains of a farmer, 
 those generous and noble impulses of the human heart which 
 an enlarged intellect should always develop, may not be tram- 
 melled in their natural tendency to expand. 

That the active, energetic exertions of the body should 
 be brought into requisition to afford the means to edu- 
 cate the mind. That each should contribute thus to the 
 aid of the other, and the perfection of both, is a beauti- 
 ful and striking system for the accomplishment of a 
 great and philanthropic purpose. Whilst a boy feels 
 that he is working out his own position in after life, he 
 is embued with that noble spirit of self dependence, 
 which enables him in all after time, and amidst the exi- 
 gencies and troubles of life, and, indeed, in any emer- 
 gency, to take a firm hold and give a right direction. 

What, and how much, should we do to give practical 
 operation to these views ? 

To farmers, permit us to say, you have an amount of 
 interest in this subject which involves not only the more 
 sordid consideration of property and its value, but the 
 high toned character, the temporal happiness, and we 
 had almost said the eternal welfare of your children. 
 And, to which let me add, that which you should never 
 cease to remember, that numbers may command respect; 
 and then recur to that admirable, practical and com- 
 mendable feature of the government under which we 
 live, that the policy is wise which produces the greatest 
 good to the greatest number. 

It is for you, then, at all times, and on all proper oc- 
 casions, to demand that in the practical workings of so- 
 ciety your interests must be cared for; that whilst 
 schools, academies and colleges receive the fostering 
 care and bountiful endowments of the government, the 
 farmers' school demands the like support. We would 
 have you, too, constantly summon yourself to the bar of 
 your own conscience, to contemplate the duty you owe 
 to your own children ; to compare the life of ignorance 
 as it gropes along its difficult path ; which seems to have 
 no other object than that it may breathe and live and 
 die — with the brightened intellect of the intelligent man, 
 who acts because he thinks — who moves in a sphere of 
 usefulness and good, and whose steps mark the path he 
 treads through life. 

To the merchant and mechanic, the active and ener- 
 getic motive powers of busy life, we address our claims, 
 and ask of you, to look with favor upon any project 
 which shall have for its object the education of the far- 
 mer. The busy marts of men are filled with the pro- 
 ducts of his labor ; his success and profits contribute 
 largely to the trade and commerce which is the produc- 
 tion of your enterprise. Whilst the abundant yield to 
 the husbandman enriches him, the result is felt in every 
 department of the mechanic's shop. As, then, you move 
 and make your impress upon the minds of men, let it be 
 tempered with the idea that all business, whether in the 

merchant's store, the mechanic's shop, or the mariner's 
 ship upon the ocean, is dependent for its working ele- 
 ments upon the products of the farm. 

To the pi-ofessor and the student — to you who already 
 possess the lights of reason, and enjoy the fruits of 
 knowledge, we appeal with confidence, that your influ- 
 ence may be thrown into the scale of agricultural pro- 
 gress — that whilst you have in your own hands that helm 
 of power which gives direction to the elements of gov- 
 ernment, you will always have in mind, that to promote 
 the true and efficient principles of political economy, to 
 expand and increase the influence of that virtue, where- 
 by alone we may hope to maintain our own free govern- 
 ment and laws, is to educate the farmer. We ask of the 
 statesman whilst he advocates the interests of his con- 
 stituents at the bar of the Senate, of the lawyer who 
 advocates the cause of his client at the bar of justice, 
 and of that sacred office which advocates the cause of 
 men at the bar of Heaven, that you may ever remember 
 the magnitude of your temporal as well as eternal welfare. 

Let us not forget to exhort those whose influence is. 
 always and so strongly marked upon the characters of 
 men, from their cradle to the grave, to think of these 
 things. The mother whose affections root so deeply in 
 the existence of her own offspring, whose anticipations 
 are oft stimulated to the painful anxiety for the welfare 
 of her own child, who watches its progress in life with 
 an eye to doubt and danger, whose hopes may be eleva- 
 ted to thankfulness to the Giver of all good, that he has 
 smiled graciously upon the career of her own dear child; 
 or whose fearful forebodings may be realized in the 
 spectacle that he is despised by the society of men, and 
 frowned upon by the attributes of Heaven. We beg leave 
 to remind you, that the influence of your power should 
 always be felt in the impress of your continued influence. 

In conclusion, we have a word to say with regard to 
 these our annually recurring exhibitions. It is one of 
 the characteristics of your occupation, and, as it has 
 been already remarked, yours is necessarily an isolated 
 mode of life, you have not the advantage of constant 
 intercourse in the busy marts of men, where circulates 
 the knowledge of the ever changing progress of things. 
 Improvements in your own art, so far as you are con- 
 cerned, lie buried in the mechanic's shop. The descrip- 
 tions which your journals communicate, are often the 
 unintelligible foreshadowing of something new ; the mar- 
 vellous accounts of the products of the field but serve to 
 excite your incredulity. But here all is reality. You 
 meet your friend who is embarked in the same enterprise 
 of life, and whose thoughts and hearts are congenial 
 with your own. You see many of whom you had before 
 but heard. And here, too, you learn to realize the force 
 of numbers, of intelligence, of strength, of which you 
 are composed, and that power which may be wielded by 
 your will. You carry hence to your homes, in your 
 mind's eye, the beautiful models of your art, the judg- 
 ment of their use, the calculation of their value. And 
 you see those marvellous productions of the soil, which 
 serve to expand your own views of the extent of the 
 workings of your own skill. These are the delightful 
 points in your life, to which the memory recurs with 
 pleasure, and therefore we would have you to remember 
 that these exhibitions are yours. That whilst you are 
 the authors and finishers, no one of you should ever fail 
 to be their friend and their patron.
