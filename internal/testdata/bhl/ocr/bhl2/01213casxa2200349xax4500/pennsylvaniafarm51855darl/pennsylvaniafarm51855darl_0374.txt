In the practice of an art, which includes a greater 
 variety of operation, and involves a greater amount of 
 scientific principles than almost any other — a profession 
 demanding far higher qualifications, and more thorough 
 and systematic preparation for its successful prosecution 
 than very many of those styled the learned ones, we find 
 comparatively few who are willing to admit that any- 
 previous training is necessary on the part of those who 
 follow it. The youth who is destined to become the 
 builder of a shoe, to fit a garment to a dandy's back, or 
 wield the hammer in the smith's shop, is required to 
 serve an apprenticeship of years ; (and this, permit me 
 to remark, is perfectly right and proper,) but, for the 
 profession of the farmer, no such apprenticeship is 
 deemed necessary. As has been facetiously remarked, 
 men take to farming as young ducks do to the water — 
 by instinct. When they have tried other pursuits, 
 whether mercantile, mechanical, or professional, and 
 have proven themselves unfit for either, they are then 
 regarded as fit material out of which to manufacture 
 farmers. How frequently are the likeliest sons of the 
 farmer sent to college, installed behind the merchant's 
 counter, or placed in the lawyer's or physician's office to 
 become disciples of Blackstone or Galen ; while the dull 
 boys — those who give no promise of brightness of intellect 
 — no keen powers of perception — are kept at home to be 
 made farmers of. Do not facts such as these give un- 
 mistakeable evidence that many farmers do not even re- 
 spect their calling, — preferring to see their sons become 
 delicate measurers of tape and calico, or occupying su- 
 bordinate positions in already overcrowded and non- 
 paying professions, rather than intelligent hard-fisted 
 yeomen ? Is it surprising that American husbandry is 
 not advancing as it should ? When farmers themselves 
 are ashamed of their profession, have they a right to 
 suppose that others will respect it as it deserves to be ? 
 Fortunately, the number of those who are thus forgetful 
 of the respectability and dignity of agriculture, bears but 
 a small proportion to the whole ; but, whatever their 
 number, it is too great. An eloquent English writer, 
 whose opinions and counsels have thrown a flood of light 
 upon the pursuits of the agriculturist, thus aptly dis- 
 courses upon this reprehensible indifference : " How 
 monstrous is it, that, while one man is apprenticed seven 
 years to learn to make a shoe, another is not apprenticed 
 at all in order to manage a farm — that while one is re- 
 quired for many years to be both an apprentice and a 
 student in order to make the contents of the statute 
 book bear upon a case of litigation, another is not re- 
 quired to be either an apprentice or a student in order 
 to make the experience of all countries and ages of the 
 civilized world, and the principles and discoveries of 
 some of the most profound and complex of human sci- 
 ences, bear upon the diversified and multitudinous prac- 
 tices of agriculture ? One year to a shoemaker's ap- 
 prentice, and three years to a young lawyer, ought to 
 be every particle as effective as seven years to a candi- 
 date for farming ; and, with one or two exceptions, not 

an artificer, an artist, or a professional man, exists, who 
 requires more special training, or a larger amount of 
 technical knowledge, than the farmer, or who possesses 
 equal facilities for turning a liberal education to excel- 
 lent practical and profitable account. Were the next 
 generation of farmers all over the civilized world to be 
 educated comparatively with other men in something 
 like the proportions of their callings, human society 
 would at one move, experience almost as great a transi- 
 tion as when it passed from the degradation of the feudal 
 ages, to the dignity and refinement of the 19th century. 
 Farmers of Susquehanna county, in presenting these 
 facts in their naked truthfulness, do not suppose that I 
 design any reflections upon your system of farming, or 
 upon your respect for your profession. Nothing could 
 be farther from my intention. My remarks aie intended 
 for general, not individual or sectional, appreciation. It 
 were far more pleasant to be able to say, behold how the 
 yeomanry of our land are building up their profession. 
 But why should we apply this flattering unction, when 
 a thousand evidences to the contrary meet us at every 
 step. Far better know the truth as it is, and knowing 
 it, provide a remedy for the evil. The remedy, as you 
 will probably infer from the remarks already offered, is 
 education, both intellectual and physical. The day ha3 
 arrived when the incubus which has so long fettered the 
 energies of the farmer must be removed. Common 
 sense, sound reason, duty to mankind, and duty to our- 
 selves, demand it. It will not be fully accomplished in 
 one, nor two, nor twenty years ; but the day of triumph 
 is dawning, and in the dim vista of the future, as well as 
 in the evidences already surrounding us, is discernable 
 the greatness with which practical applied science, com- 
 bined with our conceded skill and enterprise as a people, 
 will certainly invest our great national pursuit.

Having endeavored thus briefly to direct your atten- 
 tion to a few points illustrating the money value of sci- 
 ence, allow me in conclusion to say a word in its behalf 
 on other and higher grounds — a word for scientific agri- 
 culture for its own sake. 

It will, I presume, scarcely be denied, that the man 
 who tills the soil scientifically — intelligently — derives 
 from it pleasures, which the less informed, hap-hazard 
 husbandman can never know. Every leaf, and bud, and 
 flower, possesses for him an interest which nothing short 
 of a knowledge of their beautiful organization — their 
 wonderful functions — and the mysterious processes by 
 which nature produces and re-produces them, can give. 
 It is difficult to conceive of the possession of such knowl- 
 edge without connecting it with the fuller developments 
 of the noblest attributes of his nature — of those loftier 
 thoughts and feelings which leads from the intelligent 
 contemplation of nature's mysteries "up to nature's 
 God." I repeat, therefore, that the farmer who tills the 
 earth understandingly brings into continued and healthy 
 exercise those higher faculties, the development of which., 
 while they make him a wiser, also make him a better man. 

A knowledge of scientific husbandry teaches its pos- 
 sessor to respect his profession. Instead of regarding it 
 as a calling demanding the exercise of his merely physi- 
 cal abilities, he finds in it allurements of a character 
 calculated to enlist all his intellectual sympathies and
