To Improve the Breed of Milch Cows. 

" If those who are most deeply interested cannot be 
 induced to make some effort to improve their milch cows, 
 we must permit them to go in the old way, in which they 
 milk their cows one-half the season and the cows milk 
 them the other half." 

We copy the above from the report on milch cows at 
 our late Pennsylvania State Fair, signed by John 
 Strohm, chairman. R. R. Reed and Job Hates. We 
 believe there is much truth in it, and that through a 
 large portion of Pennsylvania, our dairymen continue to 
 keep cows, who, for one-half of the year, or nearly so, 
 are all expense without any profit. As the report says, 
 the cows milk their owners for six months for the privi- 
 lege of being milked in return. We have not at this 
 time the means of any estimate of the average yield of 
 re ilk or butter per cow in Pennsylvania, but there is no 
 doubt it is at least one-half of what it should be, and 
 what it may be. Making all allowance for the difference 
 between good and bad, a large majority of our dairy 
 cows have not the constitutional capacity for deep milk- 
 ing, entirely irrespective of feed. A cow making ten 
 pounds of butter will yield it on the same pasture as the 
 one who makes but five, and, we contend, may be kept 
 at the same expense. Farmers have this matter very 
 much under their own control. Every neighborhood has 
 one or more deep milkers far above the average. The 
 real value of such cows can hardly be estimated as a 
 foundation on which to establish a breed adapted for the 
 dairy. To get up a breed of stock for feeding purposes 
 is far more difficult, a combination of good qualities being 
 required. For the dairy, deep milking only is the de- 
 sideratum, and shape, color, size and feeding properties 
 being secondary. We would select any cow remarkable 
 for her productiveness in milk or butter, or both, with- 
 out reference to any thing else, and breed her to a bull 
 whose dam had also the same property. A heifer calf 
 from such parents would generally inherit their ten- 
 dencies. If the grandams on both sides have also been 
 deep milkers, the chances would be very much increased. 
 Every farmer who is a dairyman, and depends for a large 
 share of his income on the sale of milk and butter, should 
 raise his own cows, and spare no expense to obtain such, 
 not only for immediate profit, but for breeding, as are 
 adapted for this one object. As in order to keep up his 
 stock, it is often necessary to make purchases, it also 
 becomes important to know if there any well recognised 
 points to select a cow, which are reliable and invariable. 
 With the exception of the Alderney, perhaps there is no 
 breed in which the milking property can be said to be a 
 fixed characteristic. The Farmers' Magazine says of a 
 prime milch cow : " The head should be small, but rather 
 long and narrow at the muzzle ; the eye small but quick 
 and lively ; the horns small, clear bended, and their 
 roots at considerable distance from each other ; neck 
 long and slender, and tapering towards the head, with 
 little loose skin hanging below ; shoulders thin ; fore- 
 quarters light and thin ; hind-quarters large and capa- 
 cious ; back strait, broad behind, and joints of the chine 
 rather loose and open ; carcase deep, and the pelvis ca- 
 pacious, and well over the hips with fleshy buttocks ; 
 tail long and small ; legs small and short, with firm 
 joints ; udder capacious, broad and square, stretching 

forward, and neither fleshy, low hung nor loose ; the 
 milk veins large and prominent ; teats short, pointing 
 outwards, and at considerable distance from each other ; 
 skin, thin and loose ; hair, soft and woolly ; the head, 
 bones, horns, and all parts of least value small, and the 
 general figure compact and well proportioned." 

This is such a picture as most would draw of a well 
 shaped cow, and yet who has ever seen one combining 
 all these points. How many of them are necessary to 
 constitute a deep milker ? and do we not often find a 
 deep milker who has very few of them ? We believe 
 many a cow is spoiled for the dairy by having been 
 stunted and kept on too scanty food when a calf. Calves 
 should receive as ample a supply accordingly, and as 
 succulent and nutritious a character of food as a cow in 
 milk. This enlarges and gives full size to the lacteal 
 vessels, strength and vigor to the constitution, and we 
 are confident materially aids to make the full grown cow 
 what we want her to be. 

Guenon's tests for a good cow, as shown by the es- 
 cutcheon, we find are much and increasingly relied on 
 by dairymen. Without being able to understand how 
 they are connected, or what they have to do with the 
 lacteal secretions, (and which may be like many other 
 matters which we do not understand, but cannot help 
 believing,) there is abundant evidence that they gener- 
 ally accompany, and have been fully proved by thousands 
 of farmers to be a sign of deep milking. From our own 
 observations, we know of no tests so reliable, and would 
 advise every dairyman to procure a copy of the work. 

The value of a dairy cow does not depend entirely on 
 the amount of her yield, but also on the time she will 
 go dry. In some of the counties of England, statistics 
 have been obtained showing on the average all the re- 
 sults which go to determine the value of the cows, 
 amount of milk, butter, &c. Of five Short-Horn cows 
 in one instance, we observed the following as the product 
 for the year : 

One which did not go dry at all gave 4,857 quarts. 

" " went dry eight weeks " 3,985 " 

« " " four " " 3,987 " 

« « " " " " 3,695 " 

" h << eighteen weeks gave 3,383 " 

These cows were in summer at grass, and in the winter 
 on hay and turnips, with two months on hay alone. 

Will some of our subscribers give us an account of 
 the annual yield of their cows in milk and butter ? By 
 knowing what some cows do, we shall be able to deter- 
 mine what others ought to do. 

Cranberries on High Land. 
 Mr. Needham, of Locustdale, West Danvers, has sent 
 us a box of cranberries grown upon high land, which are 
 of good size and shape and well ripened. He has about 
 one hundred rods under culture — has gathered thirty-six 
 bushels, which he has sold at $4 per bushel. But for 
 the drought of last summer, he confidently expected to 
 get a bushel from each square rod. Few men among us 
 have devoted so much attention to the growing of the 
 cranberry as the Messrs. Needhfm, or succeeded so 
 well. Others have reclaimed meadows, and cultivated 
 the berry successfully there, but very few have attempt- 
 ed it on high land.
