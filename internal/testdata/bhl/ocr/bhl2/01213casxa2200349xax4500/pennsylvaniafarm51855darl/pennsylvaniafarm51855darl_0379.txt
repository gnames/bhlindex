Book Notices. 

Western Agriculturist and Fireside Companion. — 
 This is a new paper published at Pittsburg, Pa., devoted 
 as its name imports to agriculture, horticulture, the 
 markets, news and miscellaneous reading for the family 
 circle. It is issued weekly, at $2 per annum in advance. 
 No. 3 is now before us, presenting a very creditable ap- 
 pearance, and well supplied with excellent original and 
 selected articles. We wish it every success. It is very 
 proper that Pennsylvania should have a paper at each 
 extremity devoted to her agricultural and horticultural 
 interests. 

New Jersey Farmer. — Published at Freehold, N. J., 
 and issued monthly, at $1 per annum in advance. 
 Orrin Pharo and David Petit, Editors ; Orrin Pharo 
 and J. U. Bartleson, Proprietors. The September 
 number was the first issue of the above, and from that 
 and the subsequent numbers, we are prepared to believe 
 it will be a valuable adjunct to the present agricultural 
 press and the great cause of agricultural improvement. 
 The more of such publications the better. Not one-half 
 of the farmers read as much as they ought to do on 
 matters pertaining to their profession. 

American Agriculturist (New York City.) — The 
 weekly issue of the above has been dropped, and like 
 many of its cotemporaries, it will hereafter be a monthly 
 publication, at $1 per annum. In the new form its 
 reputation is well sustained, and an attractive and val- 
 uable compendium offered to the farmer. The American 
 Agriculturist has always been one of the best conducted 
 agricultural papers in the Union, its articles being es- 
 sentially practical and useful, no less than scientific. 

Catawissa Raspberry. 
 In our July number of the present year, we inserted 
 some account of the Catawissa raspberry, its history and 
 productiveness, &c. Its great peculiarity of continuous 
 bearing we have lately had a demonstration of in several 
 of the canes which were shown us by Joshua Pearce, 
 of Washington city, who first brought it prominently 
 into notice. This was about the middle of October, and 
 they were then filled with really a profusion of berries, 
 especially on the small lateral branches. These we were 
 informed continued gi-owing and bearing through the 
 season, of which there was full evidence on the canes, 
 some of the fruit being quite green in contact with other 
 fully ripe. It certainly may be called the ever-bearing 
 raspberry with more truthfulness than any other we are 
 acquainted with. The foreign perpetual raspberries, of 
 which we have imported several under that name, are 
 only humbugs ; but to such as are fond of fruit in season 
 and out of season, the Catawissa may be relied on. 
 The fruit is in size and color the same as our old fash- 
 ioned purple raspberry — not often now met with since 
 the introduction of the Antwerps. 

County Societies. 
 We should be pleased to publish some account of the 
 various County Exhibitions in Pennsylvania the present 
 fall, but with one or two exceptions we have received no 
 communications on the subject from any of the officers, 
 whom we generally look to for such information. Scat- 
 tered as they are through every section of the State, 

making it impossible for us to visit them personally, we 
 have to rely on the official sources, and would be greatly 
 obliged if the secretaries, or other officers, would here- 
 after keep us posted up respecting their annual elections, 
 exhibitions and other proceedings. The Farm Journal 
 is everywhere recognised by Pennsylvania farmers aa 
 the proper medium to disseminate information on the 
 agricultural interests of the various sections of our great 
 and growing State, and it will always give us pleasure 
 to insert communications having a beai-ing on these in- 
 terests and tending to promote a closer union among the 
 farmers. 

Cumberland County Agricultural Society. 
 One of our friends writes us "that the exhibition of 
 the above society the present fall was successful in every 
 particular, the weather being fine and all satisfied." A 
 large collection of agricultural implements was made by 
 Boyer & Bro., of Harrisburg. This is a new society, 
 only organized in March last, and is already in every 
 respect in a most prosperous condition. They have pur- 
 chased six acres of ground, for which $200 per acre was 
 paid. It is now enclosed with a good fence and several 
 buildings for the exhibition of articles. The officers are 
 G. H. Bucher, President, Robert Moore, Recording 
 Secretary, F. Watts, Corresponding Secretary, Geo. W. 
 Sheaffer, Treasurer, and a Vice-President in each 
 township in the county. 

Meteorology for the Farmers. 

We give extracts from the interesting letter of Lieut. 
 Maury, of the U. S. Navy, to the editor of the American 
 Farmer, on the subject of Meteorelogy. It is a matter 
 of great importance to the agricultural interest of the 
 country ; and it is hoped an appropriation from Congress 
 will be made to carry out the views of Lieut. Maury. 
 This State is already provided, through the Regents of 
 the University and the Academies, with facilities to ac- 
 complish all that is desired in this State. — Ed. Jour. N.

Observatory, Washington, June 18, 1855. 
 To the Editors of the American Farmer. 

Gentlemen — I am much obliged to you for your favor 
 of the 9th inst. You are right ; I did not intend to con- 
 fine the appeal to the farmers of any "pent-up Utica." 
 I intended to make it as broad as the land. 

You ask for the plan of co-operation. It is very sim- 
 ple, and calls on the farmers for little more than good 
 will. ' 

I first want authority to take the preliminary steps, 
 and to confer with other meteorologists and men of 
 science at home and abroad, with the view of establish- 
 ing a uniform system of meteorological observations for 
 the land, as we have done for the sea. 

If any officer of the government were authorized to 
 say to the farmers, as I have to the sailors, here is the 
 form of a meteorological journal ; it shows you the ob- 
 servations that are wanted, the hours at which they are 
 to be made ; tells what instruments are required, and 
 how they are to be used : take it, furnish the government 
 with observations, and in return the government will 
 discuss them, and give you a copy of the results when 
 published — he would have at once, and without cost, a
