volunteer corps of observers that would furnish him all 
 the data requisite for a complete study of both agricul- 
 tural and sanitary meteorology. 

Such an offer to the sailors has enlisted a corps of 
 observers for the sea, by whose co-operation results the 
 most important and valuable, and as unexpected as 
 valuable, have been obtained. 

Could not at least one farmer be found on the average 
 for every county in every State that would gladly un- 
 dertake the observations ? I don't think there would be 
 any difficulty on that score. Sailors have been found 
 to do as much for every part of the sea — on the average, 
 ten observers for a State would be sufficient. 

Now, if we could get the English government, and the 
 French government, and the Russian government, and 
 the other Christian States, both of the Old World and 
 the New, to do the same by their farmers, we shall have 
 the whole surface of our planet covered with meteoro- 
 logical observers, acting in concert, and eliciting from 
 nature, under all varieties of climate and circumstances, 
 answers to the same questions, and that too at no other 
 expense than what each gevernment should choose to 
 incur for the discussion and publication of the observa- 
 tions that are made by its own citizens or subjects. 

What is wanted in a system of observation like this, 
 is uniformity. Hence, co-operation — an agreement to 
 observe the same things at the same times — is essential 
 to any thing like success. We want not only correspond- 
 ing observations as to the time, but we want them made 
 with insti-uments that are alike, or that can be compared; 
 and, then, we may expect to find out something certain 
 and valuable, concerning the movements of this grand 
 and beautiful machine called the atmosphere. 

If you ask me to state beforehand what particular dis- 
 coveries or special results of value I expect to make, I 
 answer — if I could tell, I would not ask your assistance 
 to make them. The fields meteorological are large — 
 there are man}' of them, and all that I do know about 
 them is, that there is in them mighty harvests of many 
 sorts. 

I make the appeal to the farming interest especially, 
 because that is the great interest to be subserved by the 
 scheme ; and if the farmers do not really care enough 
 about it to use their influence with their Representatives 
 in Congress to procure the very trifling appropriation 
 that is required to get it under way, I do not see why I 
 should give myself any further trouble in the matter. 

Will j'ou not bring the subject in some tangible shape 
 before the Agricultural Societies of the country ? A 
 simple memorial from them to Congress would not fail 
 to procure all the legislative aid necessary. 

Some of the leading scientific men of Europe are ready 
 to join us in such a plan ; and with authority to confer 
 with them officially as to details, I have no doubt that 
 most of the governments of the world would undertake, 
 each for itself and within its own territories, a corres- 
 ponding series of observations, so that we should then 
 be able to study the movements of this great atmospher- 
 ical machinery of our planet as a whole, and not as 
 hitherto in isolated detached parts. Respectfully, &c.

Chidham Wheat. 
 When at the exhibition in London, in 1851, we made 
 arrangements for some of the above named wheat — a 
 very splendid variety, which succeeded well in England. 
 We received a quantity of it, and distributed it to those 
 who we trusted would give it a fair trial for two or three 
 years, as we felt assured it would be found, in some por- 
 tions of our country, a very valuable variety. -The ber- 
 ry is very fiue — the flour equal to the very best of our 
 white wheats ; its weight usually in England 63 pounds 
 and upwards. Several of the gentlemen who tried the 
 wheat have made reports through our Journal. The 
 season in 1854, in this State, was so disastrous to the 
 wheat crop that much, we fear, of this variety was 
 destroyed by the fly and drouth. We are gratified, 
 however, to learn from the Michigan Farmer that our 
 friend T. E. Wetmore, of North Cannon, Kent county, 
 Michigan, has succeeded; and that his crop, this season, 
 along side of Soules wheat, our best variety, proves the 
 "Chidham" to be at least "one-third better, both in 
 straw and berry." — Ed. Jour. N. Y. State Ag. Soc. 

Chidham Wheat. — I herewith enclose a medium 
 sized head of this variety of wheat. It was introduced 
 by the Secretary of the New York State Agricultural So- 
 ciety, from England, soon after the World's Exhibition 
 at London. In England it was considered one of the 
 best varieties of wheat, and drew many prizes. It is a 
 choice white wheat, free from beards — stouter in its 
 growth than the flint wheat, with longer heads, and is 
 equally as hard to shell out, and thus far proves hardy 
 against rust. It is, particularly on land liable to heave, 
 more apt to winter kill \>y frosts than some of our well 
 established varieties. But it improves in this respect 
 each year. On land not liable to heave it is well worthy 
 a trial. 

My crop last season amounted to seven bushels, which, 
 I divided with two neighbors, not having any convenient 
 place to sow it myself. It was sown under not very fa- 
 vorable circumstances, about the 20th Sept., along side 
 of Soules wheat. The result of the harvest proves the 
 Chidham to be at least one-third better, both in straw 
 and berry. It was less affected by the fly than the 
 Soules. If any of your readers wish to try it in a small 
 way, I will cheerfully send a sample to all applicants 
 who will enclose a stamp or two to cover return postage. 
 An extra stamp to be retained for the trouble would be 
 acceptable though not demanded.

To Keep Milk Sweet. 
 A. Boyd, a correspondent, informs us that he has 
 practised a peculiar method with much success, preser- 
 ving milk sweet in the pans. It simply consists in placing 
 a piece of new hammered iron, or three twelve penny 
 nails in each tin pan previously, and then pouring the 
 warm milk on them. He believes that electricity has 
 something to do with producing the result. — Scientific
