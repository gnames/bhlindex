who were then present; for his teeth aud mouth appear- 
 ed to us all to be perfect aud healthy. As I was rumi- 
 nating, however, after my inspection, on tho apparently 
 extraordinary nature of the case, it struck me that I 
 had not seen the tusks. I immediately betook myself to 
 a re-examination, and then discovered two little tnmors, 
 red and hard, in the situations of the posterior tusks, 
 which, when pressed, appeared to give the animal in- 
 sufferable pain. I instantly took a pocket knife, and 
 made crucial incisions through these prominences down 
 to the teeth, from which time the horse recovered his 
 appetite, and was restored." 

Tumefaction of the mouth, arising from whatever 
 cause it may, indicates cooling and astringent washes : 
 a weak solution of alum will probably answer every 
 purpose, with which the mouth may be sponged two or 
 three times daily; an infusion of witch-hazel or bayberry 
 bark will answer the same purpose. 

A hot, tender, or inflamed mouth, unattended with 
 disease, may be relieved in the same manner. — Dr.

Wintering Bees. 

There is almost as much diversity of opinion with re- 
 spect to wintering bees as in the construction of hives, 
 and about as difficult to reconcile. 

Different Methods have been Adopted. — One will 
 tell you to keep them warm, another to keep them cold ; 
 to keep them in the sun, out of the sun, bury them in 
 the ground, put them in the cellar, the chamber, wood- 
 house, and other places, and no places at all ; that is, 
 to let them remain as they are, without any attention. 
 Here are plans enough to drive the inexperienced into 
 despair. Yet I have no doubt but that bees have been 
 sometimes successfully wintered by all these contradic- 
 tory methods. That some of these methods are superior 
 to others, needs no argument to illustrate But what 
 method is best, is our province to inquire. Let us en- 
 deavor to examine the subject without prejudice to bias 
 our judgment. 

The Idea of Bees not Freezing has led to Errors 
 in Practice. — By close observation we shall probably 
 discover that the assertion so often repeated, that bees 
 have never frozen except when without honey, has led 
 to an erroneous practice. 

Appearance of Bees in Cold Weather. — We will 
 first endeavor to examine the condition of a stock left to 
 nature, without any care, and see if it affords any hints 
 for our guidance, when to assist and protect with arti- 
 ficial means. 

Warmth being the first requisite, a family of bees at 
 the approach of cold weather crowd together in a globu- 
 lar form, into a compass corresponding to the degree of 
 cold ; when at zero it is much less than at thirty above. 
 Those on the outside of this cluster are somewhat stiffen- 
 ed with cold ; while those inside are as brisk and lively 
 as in summer. In severe weather every possible space 
 within their circle is occupied ; even each cell not con- 
 taining pollen or honey will hold a bee. Suppose this 
 cluster is sufficiently compact for mutual warmth, with 
 the mercury at 40, and a sudden change brings it down 
 to zero, in a few hours, this body of bees, like most other 
 things, speedily contracts by the cold. The bees on the 

outside, being already chilled, a portion of them that 
 does not keep up with the shrinking mass, is left exposed 
 at a distance from their fellows, and receive but little 
 benefit of the warmth generated there ; they part with 
 their vitality, and are lost. 

How Part of the Swarm is Frozen. — A good family 
 will form a ball or circle about eight inches in diameter, 
 generally about equal every way, and must occupy the 
 spaces between four or five combs. As combs must 
 separate them into divisions, the two outer ones are 
 smallest, and most exposed of any ; these are often 
 found frozen to death in severe weather. Should evi- 
 dence be wanting from other sources to show that bees 
 will freeze to death, the above would seem to furnish it. 
 It is said, "that in Poland bees are wintered in a semi- 
 torpid state, in consequence of the extreme cold." We 
 must either doubt the correctness of this relation, or 
 suppose the bee of that country a different insect from 
 ours — a kind of semi-wasp, that will live through the 
 winter, and eat little or nothing. The reader can have 
 no difficulty in deciding which is the most probable, 
 whether bees are bees throughout the world, endowed 
 with the same faculties and instincts, or that the facts 
 as they are, are not precisely given, especially when we 
 see what our own apiarians tell us about their never 
 freezing. 

Here I might use strong language in contradiction ; 
 but as I am aware that such a course is not always the 
 most convincing, I prefer the test of close observation. 
 If bees will freeze, it is important to know it, and in 
 what circumstances. 

How a Small Family may all Freeze. — Suppose a 
 quart of bees were put in a box or hive where all the 
 cells were filled and lengthened out with honey ; the 
 spaces between the combs would be about one-fourth of 
 an inch — only rcom for one thickness of bees to spread 
 through. The combs would perhaps be one and a half 
 or two inches thick. All the warmth that could be gen- 
 erated then, would be by one course or layer of bees, an 
 inch and a half apart. Although every bee would have 
 food in abundance without changing its position, the 
 first turn of severe weather would probably destroy the 
 whole. This, it may be said, "is an unnatural situa- 
 tion." I will admit that it is ; the case was only sup- 
 posed for illustration. I know that their winter quarters 
 are among the brood combs, where the hatching of the 
 brood leaves most of the cells empty ; and the space be- 
 tween the combs is half an inch ; a wise and beautiful 
 arrangement ; as ten times the number of bees can pack 
 themselves within a circle of six inches, as can in the 
 other case; and in consequence the same number of bees 
 can secure much more animal heat, and endure the cold 
 much better ; but a small family, even here, will often 
 be found frozen, as well as starving. 

Frost and Ice sometimes Smother Bees. — Besides 
 freezing, there are other facts to be observed in stocks 
 which stand in the cold. If we examine the interior of 
 a hive containing a medium-sized swarm, on the first 
 severely cold morning, except in the immediate vicinity 
 of the bees, we shall find the combs and sides of the 
 hive covered with a white frost. In the middle of the 
 day, or as soon as the temperature is slightly raised, 
 this begins to melt, — first next to the bees, then at the
