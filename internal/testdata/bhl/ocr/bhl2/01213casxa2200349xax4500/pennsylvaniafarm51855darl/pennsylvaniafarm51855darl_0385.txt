The New Editors. 

In our last number it was announced that the editorial 
 department of the Farm Journal would be hereafter 
 under the control of A. M. Spangler, since then we 
 have been fortunate in securing tbe services of David 
 A. Wells, A. M., who will occupy the position of prin- 
 cipal editor, assisted by A. M. Spangler, as associate. 
 This addition, we believe, will be found to be of the 
 greatest advantage to the future character of the Journal. 

As an author, Mr. Wells is well known from his 
 connection with the Annual of Scientific Discovery, The 
 Year Book of Agriculture, and several other scientific 
 and popular works. As a chemist and geologist, Mr. 
 W. was a special pupil of Prof. Agassiz, was for a time 
 an instructor in the chemical department of the Lawrence 
 Scientific School at Cambridge, afterwards chemist to 
 the State Board of Agriculture, and has received ap- 
 pointments on several of the State geological surveys. 

His report on the soils of Ohio, and his contributions 
 to Silliman's Journal, the American Association for the 
 promotion of Science, and other journals, are well known. 
 The series of articles on the cultivation and manufacture 
 of flax, which appeared in the Scientific American last 
 year, and attracted so much attention, were from his 
 pen. They will be resumed and continued in the pages 
 of the Farm Journal. 

In addition to the services of Mr. Wells for the Farm 
 Journal, regular contributions will be made to its columns 
 by a number of the leading agriculturists and scientific 
 men of our country. The names of these contributors 
 we shall endeavor to announce in our next number. 

The late Editor to the Readers of the Farm Journal. 
 With the present number our editorial connnection 
 with the Farm Journal, which has continued for a period 
 of four years, will entirely cease. It will hereafter be 
 conducted by David A. Wells, A. M., Member of the 
 Boston Society of Natural History, formerly Chemist to the 
 Ohio State Board of Agriculture, Editor of the Annual 
 of Scientific Discovery, Familiar Science, The Year Book 
 of Agriculture, etc., etc., and A. M. Spangler, the origi- 
 nal editor and proprietor of the Journal, who will be 
 assisted by a large number of contributors and corres- 
 pondents, who have promised to lend their aid for the 
 future. It is a satisfaction to the retiring editor in 
 taking leave of his position, which has by no means been 
 one free from anxiety and responsibility, that the Farm 
 Journal is now established on a more prosperous finan- 
 cial condition, and embraces a larger list of cash sub- 
 scribers than ever before. It is also a satisfaction to 
 him to know that it is passing into other hands far more 
 able and experienced than his own, by which its useful- 
 ness and intrinsic value to the farming community will 
 be greatly promoted. 

The position of editor was assumed by him in the first 
 place with unaffected reluctance and distrust of his own 
 abilities, and only on the persuasion of too partial 
 friends. Every man has some post or other in the world 
 which he is calculated to fill, and which perhaps his duty 
 to society may require him to occupy. The late editor 
 conscientiously believes his forte does not lie in this 
 direction, that from the first he was unequal to the task 

assigned him, and regrets he has been unable to render 
 the Farm Journal more worthy of the generous patron- 
 age it has received. From his knowledge of the abilities 
 of the new editors and other arrangements which have 
 been made, he feels confident that its future will be suc- 
 cessful and satisfactory all around, and place it in the 
 position of the leading periodical of its class in the United 
 States. 

The few first years of trial and discouragement for the 
 Farm Journal have been passed, its subscription list has 
 continued steadily to increase, its establishment is now 
 fixed and permanent, the scientific as well as practical 
 details of the various branches, both of agriculture and 
 horticulture, will hereafter be under the direction of 
 some of the most experienced pens in the country, and 
 with the first issue of the coming volume, we predict a 
 large increase in the number of subscribers. 

We congratulate our readers on the improvements re- 
 sulting from the change of Publishers, and to them, as 
 well as the new editors, tender our best wishes for their 
 success and happiness. The Editor. 

READ! 

With the present number closes the fifth volume of 
 the Farm Journalâ€” and in asking our subscribers to re- 
 new their patronage for the ensuing year, we are aware 
 that we do it in the face of the fact that much dissatis- 
 faction has been given many of them during the twelve 
 months that are just passed, in consequence of a want 
 of punctuality in the monthly issues, and the non-an- 
 swering of letters. And although we are not responsible 
 for any mismanagement or neglect of duty prior to the 
 nintn month, yet we wish our readers distinctly to under- 
 stand that we are by no means blind to the fact that 
 such defects did exist to a considerable extent, at the 
 time we assumed our present duties ; and that it is now, 
 and shall continue to be, our utmost endeavor to prevent 
 the recurrence of them hereafter. Our facilities for 
 publishing the Journal are now so ample, that we are 
 fully prepared to say that nothing less than circum- 
 stances absolutely beyond control, shall prevent us from 
 issuing it regularly on the first of every month ; and we 
 are led to hope our readers will find that we mean pre- 
 cisely what we say. We shall also introduce into the 
 coming volume several new features, of interest to our 
 readers ; such as correct and reliable market reports, 
 and accouuts of new patents of such inventions as are 
 connected with agriculture and the domestic arts, &c.

On the Value of Different Kinds of Food for Stock. 

From what has been stated in the j>receding sections, 
 it appears, as the result both of theory and of practice, 
 that different kinds of food are not equally nourishing. 
 This fact is of great importance, not only in the pre- 
 paration of human food, but also in the rearing and fat- 
 tening of stock. It has, therefore, been made the sub- 
 ject of experiment by many practical agriculturists, with 
 the following general results : 

1. If common hay be taken as the standard of com- 
 parison, then, to yield the same amount of nourishment 
 as 14 lb. of hay, experiments on feeding made by differ- 
 ent persons, and in different countries, say that a weight 
 of the other kinds of food must be given, which is repre-
