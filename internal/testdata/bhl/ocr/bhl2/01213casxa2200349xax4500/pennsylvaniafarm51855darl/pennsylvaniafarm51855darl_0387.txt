must crop a much larger quantity of food to supply from I ble anticipations. There is probably no description of 

this one grass the natural waste of all the parts of their 
 bodies. 

It may indeed be assumed as almost a general princi- 
 ple, that whenever animals are fed on one kind of vege- 
 table only, there is a waste of one or other of the neces- 
 sary elements of animal food, and that the great lesson 
 on this subject taught us by nature is, that by a judicious 
 admixture, not only is food economised, but the labor im- 
 posed upon the digestive organs is also materially diminished.

Country Houses. 
 We copy the following from Smith's Landscape Gar- 
 dening. They are appended in the form of notes by the 
 editor, L. F. Allen, and contain just observations of a 
 subject of much importance at this time, when country 
 residences ai-e so much in demand. Serious and irre- 
 parable mistakes are frequently made in the erection of 
 buildings, where not only correct taste is ignored, but a 
 waste of capital made, for which we have no acquisition 
 either in appearance or conveniences of accommodation : 
 "The exterior architecture of such a house, as appli- 
 cable to a dwelling, cannot be good, because there is a 
 want of fitness in its appearance for the purposes for 
 which it is built. To apply architectural proportions 
 and beauty to an object like this, it should be largely 
 extended to embrace an open court, around which its 
 several parts should extend, like a European palace, a 
 thing we have no use for in America as a private country 
 residence. A moderate sized house of forty, fifty, or 
 sixty feet square, as large as is usually required here, 
 with a strictly architectural finish, must look like a 
 public structure, and then it becomes an absurdity as a 
 dwelling. Its interior fitness is no nearer the mark, for 
 its convenience must yield to the demands of the exterior 
 — a showy dwelling altogether. 

"In the second light in which the style of the house 
 may be regarded, as the permanent residence of the man 
 of leisure, the scholar, the retired man of business, or of 
 him who resorts to the country for a sojourn of a few 
 months in the year, and unconnected with agricultural 
 pursuits, other considerations move him in its construc- 
 tion than those which control the agaicultural proprietor 
 alone. If he retire at the distance of some miles from 
 the city, and out of the immediate neighborhood of a 
 village, the man who intends building a park residence 
 will appropriate a sufficient area of ground to accommo- 
 date his wants in the way of pasturage for his horses, 
 cattle, sheep, and poultry, (for without them his estab- 
 lishment must be incomplete,) and combine within his 
 own possessions a sufficiency of wood — and water, if 
 possible — to give a completeness to the domain within 
 his own apparent boundaries. These accomplished, the 
 house becomes the attractive and paramount object of 
 his attention. 

" Although not perhaps exactly within the province of 

real estate which is so fitful in its occupation, and so 
 temporary in the tenure, as the country places belonging 
 to residents in our cities. The reasons leading to this 
 might be given at length, but they will readily occur to 
 any one who chooses to give the subject a deliberate 
 thought. Some people buy a place and retire into the 
 country without the knowledge of what country life 
 really is — without any true appreciation of its pleasures 
 or its sacrifices — without reflection upon its inconve- 
 niences or its expense. They adopt it, in short, because 
 it is the fashion. One buys a piece of ground without 
 knowing its capabilities for the object to which it is de- 
 signed, and throws himself into the hands of his profes- 
 sional landscape undertaker, and his architect, heedless 
 of their skill or fitness to execute their work. They 
 squander his money, and put up a place — after the 
 fashion — and perhaps before it is ready for his occupa- 
 tion, he becomes disgusted with the expense and place 
 together, gets over his passion for retirement, and sells 
 it on the first good offer, at a heavy saciifice. Another 
 may retain his, and try country life for a year or two, 
 and then, finding it unsatisfactory, disposes of it at per- 
 haps a better price than the last, and pockets the loss 
 wiih the best grace he can. Another, still wiser, buys 
 a place already built, at a considerable discount, and 
 occupies it, intending to make it a permanent residence ; 
 but his circumstances changing, in business or family, it 
 is again sold, most usually at a loss, for, coming into his 
 hands ever so complete, his own propensity for improve- 
 ment has involved an outlay of some thousands for its 
 further embellishment, for which the new purchaser is 
 not inclined to pay. And so goes almost the entire 
 chapter, until there is rarely to be found a "county 
 place" within striking distance of our principal cities, 
 which has been occupied for twenty years by the same 
 family, or name, and but very few for half that period. 
 They have proved the most expensive luxuries in which 
 their proprietors have indulged, and are thrown off their 
 hands like any other bauble which amused their fancy 
 for the time, and with quite as little regret. 

"These are facts which it is well to weigh before in- 
 volving one's self in a large expenditure in building a 
 country residence. An investment in land is not so 
 hazardous a matter. If well situated and well purchased, 
 the loss in it caDnot be much when one wislies to dispose 
 of it, even if not valuable for agricultural purposes. 1 1 
 is usually the house and the other erections built upon 
 it which sink the capital, and in the event of the sale of 
 the premises, tastes in such property usually differing, 
 the purchaser is fastidious unless he can drive a decided 
 bargain. Many familiar places can be named which 
 half ruined the owners in building them, and never gave 
 them a moment's enjoyment in their occupation. The 
 splendor of his dwelling can add nothing to the conse- 
 quence of the proprietor in the community in which he 
 lives, further than to identify him with the notoriety of 
 his temporary castle ; and to the man of true fame, an 

these notes to give a homily on the financial policy of 

house-building in the country, yet for the edification of "ambitious and costly house counts but little with those 

such as look to country residence as a recreation, or a 
 temporary retirement only, it may not be inappropriate 
 to suggest some reflections when about to invest a por- 
 tion of their capital in an object so fruitful of pleasura- 

whose approbation he is most solicitous to preserve. 

"We would not be misunderstood as suggesting a 
 mean and parsimonious spirit in the country dwelling. 
 Far from it. " Every thing relating to it should be on a
