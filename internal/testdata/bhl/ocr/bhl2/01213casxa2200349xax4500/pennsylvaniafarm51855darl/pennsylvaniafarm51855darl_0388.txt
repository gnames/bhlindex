liberal plan — large enough, rooms enough for family and 
 relatives, and complete in every luxury and comfort ; 
 but all for use, and not for show. Ostentation should 
 have no abiding place in the country. Health, leisure, 
 amusement, quiet, rural beauty, are the objects for 
 which the country is sought by the jaded citizen, or the 
 lover of country life. These attained, the purposes of 
 the park and its country house are accomplished ; and 
 what these cannot provide within the limits of a reason- 
 able expenditure in a dwelling, no amount of money can 
 bestow. On the contrary, an opposite course — the 
 squandering of a large sum on an object which in its 
 nature and purpose is designed as a retreat from the 
 throng and bustle of the town, has often defeated the 
 very design intended, and driven many an honest seeker 
 of the true pleasures of rural life again into the labor 
 and turmoil of business, from the mistakes they had 
 made in the outset." 

What Draining Did. — A Short Chapter for Hired Men 
 and their Employers- 
 Some years ago the son of an English farmer came to 
 the United States, and let himself as a farm laborer, in 
 New York State, on the following conditions : Com- 
 mencing work at the first of September, he was to work 
 ten hours a day for three yeai's, and to receive in pay- 
 ment a deed of a field containing twelve acres — securing 
 himself by an agreement, by which his employer was put 
 under bonds of $2,000 to fulfil his part of the contract; 
 also, during these three years, he was to have control of 
 the field ; to work it at his own expense, and to give his 
 employer one-half the proceeds. The field lay under 
 the south side of a hill, was of dark heavy clay resting 
 on a bluish-colored solid clay subsoil, and for many 
 years previous had not been known to yield any thing 
 but a yellowish, hard, scrunted vegetation. 

The farmer thought the young man was a simpleton, 
 and that he, himself, was most wise and fortunate ; but 
 the former, nothing daunted by this opinion, which he 
 was not unconscious that the latter entertained of him, 
 immediately hired a set of laborers, and set them to 
 work in the field trenching as earnestly as it was well 
 possible for men to labor. In the morning and evening, 
 before and after having worked his ten hours as per 
 agreement, he worked with them, and continued to work 
 in this way until, about the middle of the following 
 November, he had finished the laying of nearly 5,000 
 yards of good tile underdrains. He then had the field 
 plowed deep and thoroughly, and the earth thrown up 
 as much as possible into ridges, and thus let it remain 
 during the winter. Next spring he had the field again 
 plowed as deep as before, then cross plowed and thor- 
 oughly pulverized with a heavy harrow, then sowed it 
 with oats and clover. The yield was excellent — nothing 
 to be compared to it had ever before been seen upon that 
 field. Next year it gave two crops of clover, of a rich 
 dark green, and enormously heavy and luxuriant ; and 
 the year following, after being manured at an expense 
 of some $7 an acre, nine acres of the field yielded 936 
 bushels of corn, and 25 wagon loads of pumpkins; while 
 from the remaining three acres were taken 100 bushels 
 of potatoes — the return of this crop being upwards of 
 $1,200. The time had now come for the field to fall 

into the young man's possession, and the farmer unhesi- 
 tatingly offered him $1,500 to relinquish his title to it; 
 and when this was as unhesitatingly refused, he offered 
 $2,000, which was accepted. 

The young man's account stood thus : 
 Half proceeds of oats and straw, first year, $165 00 
 Half value of sheep pasturage, first year, 25 00 

Half of first crops of clover, first year, 112 50 

Half of second crops of clover, including seed, 

second year, 135 00 

Half of sheep pasturage, second year, 15 00 

Half of crops of corn, pumpkins and potatoes, 

third year, 600 00 

Received from farmer for relinquishment of title, 2,000 00 

5,152 50

Our farmers must learn that knowledge and enterprise 
 and perseverance exercised in their business, will not 
 only add a hundred fold to their own income, but will 
 also confer more permanent benefits upon our country 
 than these qualities exercised in the same degree in any 
 other business whatever. — W. D., in N. Y. Times. 

Exhibition of the United States Agricultural Society at 
 Boston. 
 In the Boston Journal Extra, we find full reports of 
 the above exhibition, which commenced as advertised on 
 the 23d of October and continued five days. It appears 
 to have been the most successful of any similar exhibi- 
 tion yet held in this country. Sixty thousand persons 
 were estimated to be on the gi-ound at one time. There 
 was a cavalcade of five hundred and seventeen cart 
 horses in a single line, besides some of the best turf and 
 road horses in the country. The neat cattle, sheep and 
 swine embraced all the different breeds, and were from 
 the herds of several of our most eminent stock raisers. 
 Never before in the United States has there been brought 
 together the same number and quality of fine animals. 
 The arrangements of every kind were fully up to the 
 occasion. No accidents, no want of room, no clashing 
 of opinion or hesitancy as to where or how contributors 
 were to dispose of their contributions, but every thing 
 seemed planed beforehand, and in the very best manner. 
 Too much credit cannot be given to the able President of 
 the Society, M. P. Wildek, and to his experienced assis- 
 tants, for the triumphant manner in which they put the 
 whole affair through. The banquet was, as it is always 
 made to be on such occasions in New England, a promi- 
 nent feature. It took place under an immense tent, the 
 table being spread for two thousand people, and a large 
 number unable to gain admittance. Behind the chair of 
 the President, the stars and stripes were gracefully 
 gathered in folds, and above, spread out in all their am- 
 plitude, the flags of England, France, Belgium, Turkey, 
 and other countries. Some of the most distinguished 
 statesmen and orators of the country were present and 
 delivered addresses, several of which were so far beyond
