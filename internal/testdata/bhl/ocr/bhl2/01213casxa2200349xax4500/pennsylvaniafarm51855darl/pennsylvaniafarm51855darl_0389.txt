and superior to the ordinary efforts of public orators, 
 that we are tempted to transfer two of them to our 
 pages, those of Edward Everett, of Boston, and Mor- 
 ton McMiohael, of Philadelphia, which our readers 
 will doubtless think with us deserve preservation. 

The receipts of the society from all sources during the 
 exhibition was between thirty-two and thirty-five thou- 
 sand dollars, and the numbers in attendance were esti- 
 mated from one hundred and fifty to one hundred and 
 Beventy-five thousand people. From careful estimates 
 made by the Chief of Police, the number of persons 
 visiting Boston on Thursday, the 25th, in vehicles, on 
 foot, and by railway, was 87,716, and the number who 
 went out on the same day was 82,106, showing that 
 5,610 strangers stayed over night. 

The number of horses exhibited was about three hun- 
 dred, embracing the various classes of stallions and 
 breeding mares, adapted for the turf, road, draft, &c, 
 and some fifteen or more as ponies. A trial of speed 
 was held of all such horses as had never trotted for 
 money, exhibitors to drive, and to be persons who had 
 never driven for money ; first premium $200, second 
 $100. Twenty horses appeared as contestants. 

The premiums for horses ranged from $200 down to 
 $25 ; for cattle, from $100, the highest premium, down 
 to $10. Messrs. Morris & Becar took three $100 pre- 
 miums for their Durhams, besides several first premiums 
 of $50 for younger animals. Their Durham bull 
 " Romeo," over three years old, was the fortunate re- 
 cipient of the first premium ; the Durham cow "Iris" 
 the first premium for the best cow over three years. Of 
 Devons, the highest premium of $100 was awarded to 
 the bull "Winchester," owned by J. N. De Forrest, 
 Dove, New York ; for the best Devon cow over three 
 years, $100 to E. G. Tailes, West Farms, New York. 
 For the best Ayrshire bull over three years to "Kel- 
 bum," owned by Hungerford, Brodie & Converse, 
 Ellisburg, New York ; for the best Ayrshire cow to the 
 same gentleman, $100 for "Mary Grey." For the best 
 Hereford bull, the premium of $100 was awarded to 
 David Goddell, Brattleboro', Vt. ; for the best Here- 
 ford cow to "Milton," of Slate Farm, Westboro', Mass. 
 Thomas Motley, of Mass., received the first premium 
 of $100 for the best Jersey bull, and G. H. French, of 
 Andover, Mass., for the best Jersey cow "Rose." The 
 $100 premium for the best milch cow, five years old and 
 upwards, was awarded to W. W. Watson, Princeton, 
 Mass. The breed of this cow and her yield of milk and 
 butter is not stated, nor how the committee arrived at 
 their award. Of sheep, there appears to have been a 
 large display of all the different breeds — long wool, mid- 
 dle wool, French and Silesian Merinoes, mixed breed of 
 Spanish and Silesian, also fine Saxony. Messrs. Morris 
 and Haight were the successful competitors for middle 
 wool, Campbell and Sanford for Saxony, Hungerford, 
 Brodie & Converse, of Ellisburg, New York, and D. B. 
 Haight, for long wool, and Chamberlain & Campbell, 
 of Red Hook, New York, for French Merinos. Suffolk, 
 Essex, Berkshire, and other breeds of swine were exhib- 
 ited, $25 being awarded as the highest premiums- 
 Want of space prevents us from going more into detail 
 of this most successful exhibition. May we not hope 
 that Philadelphia will be selected as the place for the 

United States Society to hold its fourth display. Its 
 intermediate position between the North and South 
 would probably attract from various sections of the 
 Union a representation of visitors not to be obtained 
 elsewhere. 

A Man of Science Gone. 

Professor Johnston, the author of " Chemistry of 
 Common Life," and well known in the scientific world 
 for his professional ability, died recently, in Durham, 
 England, in his 59th year. 

Three years since Prof. J. was in the United States, 
 and delivered the Annual Address before the New York 
 State Agricultural Society, at Syracuse. He was the 
 author of a number of excellent works on Agricultural 
 Chemistry, and was distinguished for his profound know- 
 ledge of agricultural science. He was highly respected 
 in our country, both for his scientific acquirements and 
 his manly virtues. All his works have been republished 
 in this city ; this shows the estimation in which he was 
 held, and the practical character of his writings. — Scie?i-

Potatoes. 

We were shown yesterday by a gentleman of this vil- 
 lage a potatoe vine, through the whole length of which a 
 worm had bored his way, commencing at the bottom and 
 eating out at the top. He had also another in which the 
 worm was still at work ; it was about an inch in length, 
 and thoroughly cleansed the inside of the stalk — leaving 
 its young, many of which could be seen, to multiply by 
 the hundred. The vines in one particular spot only 
 were found infested in this manner, but there is no doubt 
 but that the plague would rapidly spread unless exter- 
 minated at once. Would it not be well for our farmers 
 to examine potatoe tips occasionally, as the rot will pro- 
 bably destroy the potatoe if the top is killed thus early. 

In some parts of the State, we learn that the rank 
 growth of the crop has developed itself chiefly in the 
 vines, which are luxuriant beyond precedent, while the 
 essential root itself, the potatoe, is found, upon being 
 pulled, to amount to next to nothing, being very small 
 and poor. — Litchfield (Conn.) Enquirer. 

Adulterated Food in England, 
 At the late meeting of the British Association, Dr. 
 Pearson, in the chemical section, asserted that there 
 were only two articles manufactured for food which were 
 not adulterated, common salt and refined lump sugar. 
 He challenged any gentleman present to add another 
 article to the list. — Scientific American. 

J8@" A Bedouin Arab Stallion has just arrived at 
 Philadelphia, of the celebrated Kylan breed in Eastern 
 Arabia. He is a grey, four years old. We understand 
 $10,000 has been refused for him ; his owner requires 
 $12,500. The horse was 166 days on shipboard, during 
 which he never laid down. He is said to be in fine health. 

g^" It is said that Alvah Hurlbut, of Ulysses, 
 Tompkins county, New York, has a single stalk of buck- 
 wheat that produced 6618 full and perfect grains. The 
 weight of this enormous yield was five and a half ounces.
