Discussion at the N. York State Fair. 
 Comparative Value of Guano and Barn-yard Manure, Salt, dec. 

During the late State Fair at Elmira, some little excite- 
 ment was caused by Solon Robinson, of the New York Tri- 
 bune, asserting that on Wednesday evening he would prove 
 that no farmer could afford to draw manure a mile, even 
 could lie obtain it for nothing. At the appointed hour the 
 room was filled, and the speaker essayed to fulfil his promise. 

On a prairie soil, he said, it would not pay to draw ma- 
 nure any distance, because the soil contains too much humus. 
 He had himself preferred to move the barn instead of the 
 manure. But he did not rofer to these soils. He would in- 
 stance the poorest soils of Long Island, or the sandy hills of 
 Albany, where farmers were in the habit of taking their 
 straw to New York, selling it for a trifle over the cost of 
 drawing, and taking back a load of colored straw called ma- 
 nure. It was on these poor soils that farmers could not 
 afford to draw manure one mile. But he should be asked, 
 "AVhat will you do with the manure? — throw it away?" 
 Not at all. Apply it to the land near the house, and on the 
 more distant fields use some concentrated fertilizer, in the 
 fore ranks of which be placed Peruvian guano. He had 
 seen 200 lbs. of Peruvian guano per acre, increase the wheat 

crop from four to seventeen bushels per acre. Could any 
 such results be obtained from barn-yard manure? Could 
 any farmer afford to draw it a mile when he could get Peru- 
 vian guano at the present price? Then there was salt. 
 " Salt is worth more as a manure than it sells for for other 
 purposes. Farmers can make money by going to Syracuse 
 and purchasing salt at market prices and sowing it on their 
 land." One farmer had told him to-day, that he hauled 
 wet leached ashes sixteen miles, and he considered the be- 
 nefit sufficient to pay the expense. He, Mr. R., asked him 
 why he hauled ashes so far. He replied, " for the good 
 they do the land." Mr. R. supposed the benefit was from 
 the potash they contained. Now, could not the potash be 
 obtained in a more concentrated form? Boats are now be- 
 ing loaded at Rochester, with leached ashes for the use of 
 Long Island farmers. The potash they contained could be 
 obtained in the market at a much cheaper rate. The time is 
 coming when the farmer will know what to put on his land 
 to produce wheat or any other crop, as certainly as the 
 housewife knows what to put into the trough to make bread. 
 It is just as easy for him to know. 

Sanford Howard, of the Boston Cultivator, thought the 
 benefit derived from leached ashes was not from 'he potash
