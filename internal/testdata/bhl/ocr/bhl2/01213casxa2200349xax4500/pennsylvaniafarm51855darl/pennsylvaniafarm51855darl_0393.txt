was beneficial, — was a portion of the orchard left without 
 any salt? 

Mr. Osborn replied that the whole orchard was dressed with 
 salt, but he knew that the salt had a good effect because the 
 trees grew better the year after it was applied than they did 
 the year preceding. 

James Vick, of the Genesee Farmer, made a few humorous 
 remarks on the subjects under discussion, alluding to the 
 discrepancy between the statement of Solon Robinson that 
 200 lbs. of guano would give an increase of 13 bushels of 
 wheat per acre, and that of Joseph Harris, that 336 lbs. were 
 required in England to produce an increase of 10 bushels 
 over the unguanoed portion of the field. 

Mr. Harris said that if guano was found to produce so 
 great an effeet as that ascribed to it by Mr. Robinson, he 
 quite agreed with him that it would be more profitable to 
 buy gnano than to draw manure one mile, even if it could 
 be had for nothing. He believed, however, that as a general 
 ride, no such results would be obtained. — Boston Cultivator. 

U. S. Agricultural Society. 

We copy from the North American the following proceed- 
 ings of the U. S. Agricultural Society recently held at Boston. 

"At the Grand Banquet which formed one of the most 
 interesting features of the recent display at Boston, the del- 
 egates from Philadelphia were treated with especial distinc- 
 tion. Seats were provided for them, and the ladies of their 
 families who accompanied them, in the most desirable and 
 commanding position ; and their presence was most flatter- 
 ingly acknowledged by the President, the Hon. M. P. Wil- 
 der, among the earliest recognitions of the day. Among the 
 gentlemen who were present representing our time-honored 
 society were the President, David Landreth, Gen. Patterson, 
 Dr. Elwyn, Dr. A. L. Kennedy, Algernon S. Roberts, Maj. 
 P. R. Freas, Owen Jones, John McGowan, Win. G. Warder, 
 Isaac Newton, Morton McMichael and others. 

As we learn from the Boston papers, after toasts had been 
 proposed to the States of Massachusetts and Rhode Island, 
 which had been respectively answered by the Governors of 
 those Commonwealths, and to the city of Boston, to which 
 the Mayor replied : 

President Wilder said, the gratifications of the occasion 
 were heightened by the presence of representatives from the 
 two oldest agricultural societies in the Union, those of Phil- 
 adelphia and Massachusetts. From the former he was par- 
 ticularly pleased to welcome a delegation comprising a num- 
 ber of eminent citizens of Philadelphia, who had favored the 
 National Society by sharing in its labors, and now honored 
 it by uniting in its festivities. With the double view of ex- 
 pressing to these gentlemen the sense he entertained of the 
 merits of their Society, and of drawing from them something 
 in reply, he would propose, 

The Philadelphia Society for the Promotion of Agricul- 
 ture — The oldest American organization for the advancement 
 of this worthy cause — the parent of all similar institutions 
 in our countrj'; her children and her children's children 
 rise up and call her blessed. 

Mr. Landreth, President of the Society complimented 
 said — 

Mr. President, — I hope you will not smile at my simpli- 
 city, when I candidly say that although I expected to say 
 something, I have nothing to say. Perhaps when you were 
 a schoolboy, you may have read in an old book, now some- 
 what obsolete, I fear, a story of certain young women — I 
 think there were five of them — who upon a festive occasion 
 were found in a peculiar condition, I mean sir, that they 
 had no oil in their lamps. I, unhappily, am in a similar 
 state, or even worse, surrounded as I am by the sparkling 
 eyes of the ladies, which serve to render the darkness nioro 

apparent. It was Addison, I believe, who authorized an- 
 other to draw upon him for a thousand pounds, when he had 
 only sixpence in his pocket., I, sir, upon this occasion, am 
 in a still worse condition, for I am found without a penny. 
 Under such circumstances, what is to be done? In the lan- 
 guage of the Irish Ambassador, situated as I am, indeed, I 
 may say, circumstanced as I am, I hope you will allow me 
 to call upon one better suited for the occasion, and, with 
 your permission, I will name Mr. McMichael, the distin- 
 guished editor of the Philadelphia North American. 
 Mr. Wilder then introduced Mr. McMichael, who said : 
 From the land of the Quaker to the land of the Puritan — 
 from the city where our national independence was first pro- 
 claimed to the city where its first great labor was perfected 
 — we, who have just been honored by the toast you have 
 proposed, have come, not as once we might have come, in 
 awe of stripes, and brandings, and imprisonment; nor, as 
 again we might have come, burdened with the weight of a 
 gloomy foreboding, to share in the perils of a doubtful con- 
 flict. No, sir. Happier in this than our forefathers, wheth- 
 er of the earlier or later time, we have come, assured of hos- 
 pitable welcome and bounteous entertainment, to witness the 
 generous rivalries of friendly contestants, and to mingle in 
 the rejoicings which properly belong to the triumphs of 
 peace. And, sir, we feel that it is good for us to be here — 
 we feel now that the bitterness of intolerance as between you 
 and us has forever ceased, now that the privations and dan- 
 gers of revolutionary struggles for you and for us are forever 
 over, recalling, as we may, with a smile, the follies of the 
 fanaticism by which we were separated, remembering, as we 
 must with a sigh, the trials of the patriotism by which we 
 were united — we feel that it is good for us, men of Pennsyl- 
 vania, to be here with you, men of Massachusetts; to engage 
 with yeu in a common effort to promote an important inter- 
 est of our common country ; to admire with you the rapid 
 development of that interest; to exult with you over the 
 unexampled prosperity of that country. Missionaries from 
 our heaped up granaries, from our prolific mines, from our 
 teeming furnaces, we have entered your industrial establish- 
 ments — those vast reservoirs of life, and of motion in its 
 seeming intelligence resembling life — and having seen with 
 our own eyes and measured with our own judgments the 
 men and the processes that, by consuming our corn, and our 
 coal, and our iron, and replacing them with the fabrics that 
 supply the staples of a busy commerce, have made our in- 
 terests and yours complete and identical, we are ready to 
 cry " Woe, woe, woe," unto him that would dissever us. 
 Sir : bound together as we are, it was not possible we could 
 meet as strangers, but you have received us as favored breth- 
 ren; and in behalf of my colleagues, and in the name of 
 those we represent, I cordially thank you ; I thank you for 
 the courtesy which has been extended to us ; I thank you 
 for the privilege we have enjoyed of being partakers at the 
 same time of your pleasing duties and your grateful cheer; 
 I thank you for tho opportunity you have furnished us of 
 joining our hands, and our hearts, and our voices with 
 yours, in the fulfilment of mutual services, in the recognition 
 of mutual kindness, in the utterance of sentiments of mutual 
 good will. 

Mr. President : As I looked yesterday on the gratifying 
 exhibition made among the triple hills of your beautiful 
 Boston, like his excellency, the Governor, I too was remind- 
 ed of those ancient days when from all the isles of Greece, 
 the people gathered to a periodical festival, foremost among 
 whose attractions were the achievements of the race course 
 and the ring. It is true, sir, contrasting the present with 
 the past, that in your curriculum no gaudy and glittering 
 chariots, urged by filleted tyrants, have flashed their useless
