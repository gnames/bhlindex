[December 

it monopolised the crowd whenever the horses were 
 brought out 

The cattle were fine and in good number. Some re- 
 markably good animals were exhibited, and, amongst 
 them, the fine Devon bull owned by Mr. De Forrest, of 
 New York. This animal, we observe, was awarded the 
 first premium at the recent United States Exhibition at 
 Boston. We have not space to enumerate many others 
 exhibited. 

Of agricultural implements there was an immense 
 number on exhibition, and many that were not only new 
 but of superior construction. The competition was 
 warm between different exhibitors. We have rarely seen 
 a better or larger display. 

The department of domestic manufactures, fine arts, 
 &c, was well filled and highly creditable. 

The very best feeling prevailed, and the promise, that 
 next year New Jersey would do better, was in the 
 mouths of many, who, we know, will make that promise 
 good. 

in the growth of Italian Rye Grass is very trifling, but I 
 have bad many opportunities of seeing the experiments 
 and hearing the opinions of those who have given it a 
 fair trial. 

Your correspondent's account of that noted field of 
 bottom land reminds me of a story I once heard of a far- 
 mer, who had a field in some part of the Emerald Isle, 
 (further the deponent sayeth not,) who, conscious of the 
 fatness of the soil, and wishing to lubricate his crops 
 with a little pork, planted this field with pigs' tails, and 
 in the course of a few months it was overrun with the 
 finest and fattest little pigs in that part of the country. 
 I did not hear what effect the young porks had on the 
 soil, so I cannot say whether, like Falstaff, they "larded 
 the lean earth as they walked along," or like the Italian 
 Rye Grass proved merely an exhauster.

Italian Rye Grass. 

To the Editor of the Farm Journal— Dear Sir : — In 
 the September number of the Journal, I find an article 
 in defence of the Italian Rye Grass, signed N. G. Mc, 
 of Pittsburg, and purporting to be a reply to mine in 
 the July number. 

As a proof of the excellence of the Italian variety, 
 your correspondent cites the mere fact of cattle prefer- 
 ing it to clover ! This is invariably the case with all 
 rye grasses, and also with an indigenous variety of grass 
 (a perfect pest) known by the name of Pwitch, but 
 which no farmer ever thought of cultivating. In his 
 second "noted fact," he says a field of bottom land 
 yielded, under ordinary labor, five cuttings in one season, 
 two of which were ripened for seed. If there is no mis- 
 take here, and if such a thing ever was done, I hope he 
 did not sell the seed for the sake of his purchasers ! 
 Two crops of seed properly matured (which I never saw) 
 would take five or six months, two of hay three months 
 more, and nearly another month would be required for 
 that fifth fine crop into which the cattle were turned. 
 In all, more than nine months of vigorous vegetation, and 
 no allowance for frost or ungenial weather of any kind ! 
 Truly, your correspondent must have been himself "sadly 
 imposed upon, or else he is unreasonably ignorant of 
 the subject on which he writes." He does not say in 
 what part of the United Kingdom this famous field was 
 situated. 

Not only present but after crops require consideration, 
 and as the chief profits of a farmer are obtained after 
 the land has been enriched by what is called seed cul- 
 ture, it behoves all to have a care and select such varie- 
 ties of seed only as ameliorate, and not those that ex- 
 haust, the soil. 

When a resident in England, I flatter myself I had 
 some experience in the growth of rye grasses, as I own- 
 ed, and at that time occupied, lands in several of the 
 leading agricultural counties. From the system of man- 
 agement best adapted to those counties, more rye grasses 
 were grown there (and I have no doubt still are so,) than 
 perhaps in any other part of the United Kingdom. As 
 I stated in my previous article, my personal experience

 Agricultural Exhibitions. 
 Mr. Editor : — Your article in the November number 
 headed "Agricultural Exhibitions," is well timed, and 
 deserves a careful reading by every farmer. In many 
 of the counties, the most vicious, such as broken down 
 corrupt politicians, rumsellers, horse-jockeys, and other 
 shallow brained creatures, have taken hold of these ex- 
 hibitions by force, and in many cases have so disgraced 
 them that the best and most respectable farmers are dis- 
 gusted and stand aloof, which is precisely the proper 
 course, for no man of character ought or will counten- 
 ance the gambling, horse racing, wooden circus and 
 negro shows that unfortunately disgrace agricultural 
 exhibitions. In one of the counties beyond the Blue 
 Mountains, where a miserable chap acts as President, 
 and the Society is in the hands of these unprincipled 
 persons, in order to raise the wind, admitted all these 
 disgraceful exhibitions within the enclosure on payment 
 of stipulated sums. If the reputation of county exhibi- 
 tions is to be saved, it becomes the duty of the farmers 
 to fill the offices with men of character and principles 
 that will not suffer such conduct. A Farmer.

J$ggf° The returns of the Registrar-General of Agricul- 
 tural Statistics for Ireland show that there has been this 
 year an increase of 87,293 acres on cereal crops, of 
 25,513 on green crops, and of 53,873 on meadow and 
 clover, whilst there was a decrease of 54,297 on flax. 
 The total increase in the extent of land under crops is, 
 therefore, 112,382 acres. 

Beans for Horses. 
 Oats with me is a very poor crop, and are scarce 
 in this district. Beans are plentiful with me. I wish to 
 feed my horses on the latter, but there is considered to 
 be a danger in using beans till they are hardened in the 
 stack — say till Christmas. Would boiling or steaming 
 obviate this ? And are boiled beans for horses in hard 
 work equal to bruised beans ? S. [Will any one who 
 has had experience of beans soaked in water previous to 
 use as horse food give it to our correspondent ?] — Agri-
