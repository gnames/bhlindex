The Board of Trustees of the Farmers' High School of 
 Pennsylvania met this clay. Members present : Gov. 
 James Pollock, James Gowen, President of Pennsylvania 
 State Agricultural Society, Andrew G. Curtin, Secretary 
 of the Commonwealth, Frederick Watts, H. N. McAllis- 
 ter, James Miles, Alfred L. Elwyn, A. 0. Hiester, John 
 Strohm, and Robert C. Walker. 

The Governor, James Pollock, in the chair. 

Frederick Watts from the Committee to view certain 
 lands with a view to the location of the Farmers' High 
 School, made the following report : 

Since the last meeting of the Board, the Committee 
 by two of their members took occasion to examine the 
 farms of Mr. H. Easton, of Franklin county. Two of 
 these farms, which lie near to the town of Louden, on 
 the Pittsburg turnpike, are situated upon the Conado- 
 cheague creek, and each contain about two hundred 
 acres of excellent limestone land, well improved and 
 cultivated. The improvements are of brick, and as to 
 the dwellings and barns, they are of the best kind. 
 These farms are now worth sixty dollars an acre. Upon 
 the one nearest the town of Louden, there is a large and 
 never failing spring of water. Another farm of Mr. 
 Easton's, which he calls the Wolford Farm, is situated 
 about two and a half miles from Louden, and about the 
 same distance from Mercersburg, and on the great road 
 between these places. This is a beautiful farm of two 
 hundred and forty acres, about one-third of which is 
 slate underlaid with limestone, one-third is limestone, 
 and one-third of clay meadow land of excellent quality. 
 The dwelling is a fine brick house and the barn is built 
 of cut limestone. This is a most desirable property, and 
 having upon it a very large and never failing spring of 
 limestone water. Mr. Easton does not propose to give 
 all of this Wolford Farm to the Farm School, because he 
 considers it from three to five thousand dollars more 
 valuable than either of the other two which he does pro- 
 pose to grant gratuitously ; but the citizens of Mercers- 
 burg propose to make up and pay the difference in value 
 between tli2 farms, so that this Wolford Farm may be 
 considered as offered to the Trustees gratuitously. Your 
 Committee also beg leave to report the following com- 
 munication made to them by Mr. Blair : 

Huntingdon, Sept. 3d, 1855. 

To the Trustees of the State Agricultural College, 

Gentlemen : — I propose to convey to the Trustees of the 
 College or School aforesaid, for the purposes for which 
 the same Avas incorporated, a farm of limestone land, 
 situate in Dublin township in the county of Huntingdon, 
 containing nearly two hundred acres. This farm ad- 
 joins the road leading from Mount Union on the Penn- 
 sylvania Kailroad to Chambersburg, within one mile of 
 Shade Gap, seventeen miles east of Mount Union and 
 thirty west of Chambersburg. About one hundred and 
 thirty acres of it are cleared and cultivated, and about 
 twenty of it are meadow. The' land is quite level. 
 Limestone quarries are opened on it in several places, 
 and every part of the premises has abundance of spring 
 and running water. This property is located in a very 
 healthy, moral and improving neighborhood. This farm 

I propose to convey you on condition that the College 
 aforesaid be located thereon. David Blair. 

The following proposition was made by Gen. James 
 Irvin : 

To the Trustees of the Farmers' High School of Penn- 
 sylvania, — Gentlemen : — The above diagram (see letter 
 on file) represents one of the tracts of land offered by 
 me some time since to the Farmers' High School, and as 
 the Committee and those of the Trustees who visited the 
 ground, thought it would be desirable to have a larger 
 tract than two hundred acres, I have had laid off one 
 hundred acres on the west and one hundred acres on the 
 east, making in all four hundred acres. This tract is the 
 second one visited by the Committee, and lies on the 
 north side of the public road leading from Centre Fur- 
 nace to the Pennsylvania Railroad at the mouth of 
 Spruce Creek, and distant from there about twenty-one 
 miles. I propose, on condition the Institution be located 
 on the above tract, to convey to the Farmers' High 
 School of Pennsylvania in fee simple, at any time after 
 the location shall have been made that the Trustees may 
 require, the two hundred acres included in the black 
 lines. I also propose to lease to the Institution, if the 
 Trustees desire it, the adjoining two hundred acres for 
 the term of five years from the first day of April next, 
 at the rate of six hundred dollars per year, with the 
 right to call upon me at any time within said term to 
 convey the same to the Institution in fee simple, clear of 
 all incumbrance, on the payment of sixty dollars per 
 acre, say twelve thousand dollars, one-half thereof on 
 making the conveyance, and the balance in two equal 
 annual payments thereafter. I will give the Trustees 
 immediate possession of the whole, except so far as the 
 tenants now on the property may require possession to 
 enable them to gather in the present crops. 

Yours respectfully, 

James Irvix. 

The following guarantee was presented by H. N. 
 McAllister : 

To the Trustees, &c. — Gentlemen : — Whereas the citi- 
 zens of Centre and Huntingdon counties have subscribed 
 upwards of ten thousand dollars to the Farmers' High 
 School of Pennsylvania, on condition that Institution be 
 located on the lands offered by Gen. James Irvin, of Cen- 
 tre county, and whereas, the responsibility and standing 
 of many of the subscribers are unknown to the Trustees, 
 we do hereby guarantee that the sum of ten thousand 
 dollars shall be collected and paid upon said subscription 
 to the Farmers' High School, agreeably to the terms and 
 conditions thereof. H. N. McAllister, 

James Irvin,

 posed to donate to the Farmers' High School, upon con- 
 dition the Institution be located thereon, two hundred 
 acres of land, situate about two miles southwest of Al- 
 toona. Mr. David Caldwell being also present, proposed 
 on behalf of the citizens of Blair county to give to the 
 Trustees two hundred acres of land in addition and ad- 
 joining the said land of Elias Baker, and in addition also 
 to pay the sum of ten thousand dollars, upon condition
