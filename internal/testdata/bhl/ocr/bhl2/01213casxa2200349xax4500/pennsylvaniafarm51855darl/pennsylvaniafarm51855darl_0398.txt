Mr. Caldwell then offered the following guarantee : 

We, the subscribers, hereby guarantee to the Trustees 
 of the Farmers' High School, that the sum of ten thou- 
 sand dollars shall be raised by subscription and paid to 
 the said Trustees — one-third to be paid at the time of 
 the conveyance of the title to the land of Elias Baker, 
 and the balance in three equal annual payments. 
 (Signed,) Elias Baker, 

David Caldwell. 

Frederick Watts offered the following resolution : 

Resolved, That the adoption of the proposition of Gen. 
 James Irvin for the location of the Farmers' High School 
 will best promote the interests of the Institution, and 
 that the same is hereby adopted. 

The question being on the adoption of the resolution, 
 James Gowen moved to strike from the resolution the 
 name of James Irvin and insert that of Col. Elias Baker. 
 The question being taken on the amendment, it was de- 
 cided in the negative. A. L. Elwyn moved to strike 
 from the resolution the name of Gen. James Irvin and 
 insert that of H. Easton, which was decided in the nega- 
 tive. Frederick Watts moved that the question be post- 
 poned for the present, and that James Gowen, A. 0. 
 Hiester and John Strohm be appointed a Committee, 
 whose duty it shall be to examine the lands proposed to 
 be donated, and determine which shall be adopted. The 
 question was then taken on the motion to postpone, and 
 disagreed to. Robert C. Walker moved to strike from 
 the resolution the name of Gen. James Irvin, and insert 
 that of George A. Bayard, which motion was also deci- 
 ded in the negative. The question then recurring on 
 the original resolution, it passed. 

Alfred L. Elwyn from the Committee appointed at the 
 last meeting to select and report npon a Principal for 
 the Institution, reported that the Committee had agreed 
 to recommend Charles B. Trego. 

Frederick Watts moved that the Committee heretofore 
 appointed on the subject be instructed to procure the 
 services of Charles^. Trego as Principal of the Institu- 
 tion, at a salary not exceeding fifteen hundred dollars, 
 and that in case he does not accept, to seek some other 
 person for the position, and which was agreed to. 

On motion, Frederick Watts, H. N. McAllister and 
 Alfred L. Elwyn were appointed to procure from Gen. 
 James Irvin the title to the land proposed to be donated. 

On motion, it was resolved that Frederick Watts, H. 
 N. McAllister and James Miles be appointed a Commit- 
 tee to act with the Principal of the Institution in making 
 preparations for building and for other purposes, and 
 that Moses Thompson, of Centre Furnace, be requested 
 to act with said Principal and Committee. 

On motion of James Gowen, Frederick Watts was 
 unanimously elected President of the Board of Trus- 
 tees. 

Frederick Watts presented the following resolution, 
 which, on motion of James Pollock, was agreed to: 

Resolved, That the Trustees of the Farmers' High 
 School of Pennsylvania appreciate with a high degree of 
 favor the contributions which have been made to practi- 
 cal science, as it may be applied to commerce and navi- 
 gation, by Lieut. M. F. Maury, of the United States 
 Navy, and that his generous offer that the influence of 
 the Govern-nent be extended to enable him to prosecute 

Why the Farmer should give heed to the Man of Science. 

The following judicious remarks form the conclusion 
 of a recent lecture by Prof. Tumey, of Alabama, upon 
 science, as applied to agriculture : — 

" In conclusion, allow me to say one word upon the 
 apparent indifference with which agriculturists, as a body, 
 listen to the teachings of science. Rural pursuits are 
 far less favorable to speculative states of mind than those 
 of the manufacturer; and hence, while the latter has 
 pressed chemistry into his service, the cultivator of the 
 soil is too often contented to pursue his own chance-di- 
 rected processes, unaided by the light of science. 

" This unnatural divorcement of science and agricul- 
 ture has often arisen from not distinguishing between 
 agriculture as a science and agriculture as an art. The 
 man of science investigates one department, and the cul- 
 tivator of the soil practices the other. Odium is often 
 brought upon what is called scientific farming by the 
 failure of men of science when they attempt the practice 
 of agriculture. Now, I believe that, in general, it will 
 be found that it was not the science, but the common 
 sense, of such men that was at fault. The practice re- 
 quires a different training, and, however sound his prin- 
 ciples, the mere man of science fails for want of it when 
 he attempts to try his own principles practically." 

the same inquiries for the benefit of agriculture, meets 
 with our most cordial approbation. 

On motion, it was resolved, that the President of the 
 Board be directed to prepare a memorial to Congress 
 representing the wishes of this Board on that subject. 

The following is the memorial agreed upon : 
 To the Senate and House of Representatives composing the 
 Congress of the United Slates. 

The memorial of the Board of Trustees of the Farmers' 
 High School of Pennsylvania respectfully represents, 
 that they are deeply impressed with the idea that the 
 excellence of our political institutions and their perma- 
 nent security depend mainly upon the intelligence and 
 consequent virtue of the people, that the acquisition of 
 knowledge and the progress of science and useful arts 
 are entitled to the fostering care of the Government, and 
 that that care should extend to the agriculturist as well 
 as the merchant and mariner. We, therefore, look with 
 the highest degree of interest and desire to express the 
 liveliest feelings of approbation of the practical and 
 beneficial results which have been already attained for 
 the benefit of commerce and navigation through the in- 
 strumentality of your officers. We, therefore, pray your 
 honorable bodies to make such additional appropriation 
 of means as will enable the efficient officer who has the 
 subject in charge to extend his observations throughout 
 the country and invite the co-operation of other coun- 
 tries, that meteorological observers may act in concert 
 throughout the christian world, and establish a sjstem for 
 the land such as has already been discovered for the sea. 

On motion of John Strohm, it was resolved, that the 
 thanks of this Board be tendered to all those who have 
 so liberally proposed to aid in the establishment of the 
 Farmers' High School of Pennsylvania. 

On motion, the Board adjourned.
