 To the Board of Trustees of Cornell University: 

Gentlemen : — I have the honor to transmit herewith the manuscript 
 and illustrations for the seventh of the series of monographs on fruits 
 which is being published by this Station, to be entitled The Small Fruits 
 of New York. I recommend that, as authorized by Chapter 598, Laws of 
 1923, this be submitted for publication as Part II of the Forty-fourth 
 Annual Report of this Station. 

The world-wide appreciation and utilization of the six preceding books 
 of this series, which deal with apples, plums, peaches, cherries, grapes, and 
 pears, gives assurance that this new treatise dealing similarly with small 
 fruits, will be universally enthusiastically accepted and used. As in the 
 case of the preceding volumes, the material presented herein is the result 
 of several years of careful trials of all available small fruit materials on the 
 Station grounds, followed by exhaustive and painstaking laboratory and 
 library work, by Dr. Hedrick and his associates, to insure that the treatise 
 shall be both comprehensive and accurate in detail. 

The Small Fruits of New York certainly will find a most useful place 
 in horticultural literature. In addition, it undoubtedly will be a source 
 of inspiration and helpful information to the growers of small fruits the 
 world over. 

These various works constitute a monumental contribution of this 
 Station to the science and practice of fruit-growing throughout the entire 
 world. In addition, the information and the actual orchard stock which 
 has been accvimulated during these studies afford an exceptional oppor- 
 tunity for the breeding of new and improved varieties, which is the major 
 activity of the Division of Horticulture of this Station. 

This book concludes the series of monographs on fruits. The Legis- 
 lature of 1925 authorized the preparation of a similar series of reports on 
 The Vegetables of New York, work upon which is already actively in 
 progress. Furthermore, it is hoped that in the not far distant future, a 
 ^ revision of The Apples of New York, to be uniform in size and typography

with the other fruit books may be prepared.
