THE EVOLUTION OF CULTIVATED RASPBERRIES 

Four groups of raspberries, each with many varieties, are commonly 
 grown in North America. These are, in order of introduction to cultiva- 
 tion: The European red raspberry, derived from the wild red raspberry of 
 Europe, Riibits idaeus; the American red raspberry, the cultivated form of 
 the American red raspberry, R. idaeus stn'gosiis; the black raspberry, or 
 blackcap, sometimes called the thimbleberry, also a cultivated native, 
 R. occidental is: and the purple-cane raspberries, hybrids between varieties 
 of the two reds and the black raspberry. It will be interesting to trace the 
 evolution of these four raspberries. 

THE RED RASPBERRY IN EUROPE 

The red raspberry cultivated in Europe is derived from an Old World 
 species widely and commonly found in the temperate parts of Europe and 
 Asia. It was named Riibiis idaeus by Linnaeus from Mount Ida in Greece, 
 though probably not more commonly fotmd on Mount Ida than in many and 
 vast regions in other parts of the Old World. It is now occasionally found 
 wild as an escape from cultivation in the United States, and no doubt has 
 freely hybridized with the native red and probably somewhat with the 
 blackcaps of the New World. 

It is idle to speculate as to when the domestication of this raspberry 
 began in Europe. No doubt it crept into fields and was more or less culti- 
 vated from the very beginnings of agriculture in the regions where it grows 
 wild. But it did not attract sufficient attention to be called a cultivated 
 fruit until the sixteenth century or nearly 400 years ago. Even then there 
 seem to have been no named varieties, as with the tree fruits at the same 
 time, and not until a century later do named varieties appear. 

Some horticultural authorities trace the history of this raspberry as a 
 cultivated plant to the ancient Greeks. But there is little to substantiate 
 such a history. It is a matter of importance to determine whether a plant
