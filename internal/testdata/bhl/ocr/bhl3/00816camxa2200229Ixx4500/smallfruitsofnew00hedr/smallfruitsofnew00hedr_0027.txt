THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 3 

with this limitation, because both Dates, Olives, and other fruits, are planted 
 in the Orchards of Spaine, Italy, and other hot countries, which will not 
 abide in ours. Yet herein I will declare whatsoever Art, striving with 
 Nature, can cause to prosper with us, that whosoever will, may see what 
 can bee effected in our countrie. And first to begin with the lower shrubbes 
 or bushes, and after ascend to the higher trees." Then follows a discussion 
 of the raspberry. 

" The Raspis berrie is of two sorts, white and red, not differing in the 
 forme either of bush, leafe, or berry, but onely in the colour and taste of 
 the fruit. The Raspis bush hath tender whitish stemmes, with reddish 
 small prickes like haires set rovind about them, especially at the first when 
 they are young; but when they grow old they become more wooddy and 
 firme, without any shew of thomes or prickles upon them, and hath onely 
 a little hairinesse that covereth them : the leaves are somewhat rough or 
 rugged, and wrinkled, standing three or five upon a stalke, somewhat like 
 unto Roses, but greater, and of a grayer greene colour: the flowers are small, 
 made of fine whitish round leaves, with a dash as it were of bluish cast 
 over them, many standing together, yet eveiy one upon his owne stalke, 
 at the tops of the branches; after which come up small berries, somewhat 
 bigger than Strawberries, and longer, either red or white, made of many 
 graines, more eminent then in the Strawberry, with a kinde of dovminesse 
 cast over them, of a pleasant taste, yet somewhat sowre, and nothing so 
 pleasant as the Strawberrie. The white Raspis is a little more pleasant 
 then the red, wherein there is small seede inclosed : the rootes creepe under 
 ground verie farre, and shoote up againe in many places, much encreasing 
 thereby. 

" There is another whose stemme and branches are wholly without 
 prickles: the fruit is red, and somewhat longer, and a little more sharpe. 

" The leaves of Raspis may be used for want of Bramble leaves in 
 gargles, and other decoctions that are cooling and drying, although not 
 fully to that effect. 

" The Conserve or Syrupe made of the berries, is effectuall to coole an 
 hot stomacke, helping to refresh and quicken up those that are overcome 
 with faintnesse. 

" The berries are eaten in the Summer time, as an aftemoones dish, 
 to please the taste of the sicke as well as the sound. 

" The juyce and the distilled water of the berries are verie comfortable 
 and cordiall. 

"It is generally held of many, but how true I know not, that the red 
 wine that is usually sold at the Vintners, is made of the berries of Raspis 
 that grow in colder countries, which giveth it a kinde of harshnesse: And 
 also that of the same berries growing in hotter climates, which giveth imto 
 the wine a more pleasant sweetnesse, is made that wine which the Vintners
