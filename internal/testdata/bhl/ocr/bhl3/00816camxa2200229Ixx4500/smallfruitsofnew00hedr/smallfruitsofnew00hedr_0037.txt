THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 1 3 

canes of the Ohio Raspberry — I paid them very close attention. They 
 bore fniit in summer of a darker colour than those they were growing 
 amongst, and smaller, varying in colour as did the canes. I thought at first 
 that they were sports from my original black Raspberry, resulting from 
 — may I so call it? — domestication; and although interested, I was not 
 surprised, this being reserved for the autumn, for then surprise did come, 
 the canes which I had noticed, or rather the yoiing canes of the growth of 
 the simimer, putting forth in October an abundant crop of fruit, the canes 
 which had given fruit in summer being then dry and sapless. The coloiu" 
 of the canes, most of them having the pretty blue tint of the sort from Ohio, 
 induced me to think that I had by accident obtained some curious cross- 
 breeds. I now believe this to have been the fact. 

" I wished, however, to see the end of this curious outbreak; for I 
 thought why should not other kinds of Raspberries growing near the Ohio 
 Raspberry, and from which seedlings had been raised, receive a stain? I 
 therefore raised a number of seedlings from the first apparent hybrids I dis- 
 covered, and I have since then raised three or four generations, confining 
 myself to the seed taken from the largest beiTies of a deep purple colour, 
 hoping to establish a race that might be reproduced from seed without 
 difficulty ; for I must add that nearly all my black autumnal Raspberries are 
 like their Ohio parent — they make a large stub after being repeatedly cut 
 down, but produce no suckers from their roots. The result of my sowing 
 carefully-selected seed from the finest purple berries produced in autumn is 
 most curious. 

" I have had red summer Raspberries, red and pink, flesh-coloured, 
 and large white autumnal sorts; yellow summer and yellow autumnal 
 varieties ; small-berried black autumnal Raspberries of gigantic growth — 
 making strong canes 15 feet in length, and some dwarf bushes 2 feet in 
 height; in short, such a ynelange as I think never before was seen in a bed 
 of Raspberries. It would take a long chapter to describe them; but as the 
 greater portion were horticulturally valueless, they have been destroyed. 
 I have, however, settled down to a few sorts, which seem as if they would, 
 with the exception of a few slight vagaries, prove constant. One, a large 
 black autumnal variety, with blue canes, ripening in October; another with 
 large black berries, and with canes not so blue, ripening in August; another 
 with very large orange berries, and another with large white berries, 
 covered with a glaucous bloom, both ripening in October. It is curious 
 to note that the sorts with pale berries put forth suckers from the roots like 
 the common kinds of Raspberries, whereas those with blue canes and black 
 berries put forth none, yet all came from the same source — the black 
 autumnal hybrids." 

Let us now go back to the Ohio Everbearing. This variety as we have 
 said seems to have been the first blackcap to be named and introduced
