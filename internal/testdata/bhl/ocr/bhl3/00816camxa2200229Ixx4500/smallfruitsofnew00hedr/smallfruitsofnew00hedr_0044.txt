20 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

From Table I we see that there were 54,256 acres, and 61,333,509 
 quarts of raspberries grown in the United States in 191 9. Included with 
 the raspberries are the loganberries grown chiefly in Pacific states. The 
 table shows that raspberries are grown largely only in the northern states 
 and in the regions where the two native species grow commonly in the wild. 
 New York leads in the production of this fruit in acreage, yield, and value 
 with Michigan second. 

Red, black, and hybrid berries are not segregated in this census report, 
 but the regions in which the three types of fruit are mostly grown are well 
 marked. Most of the red raspberries in city markets are grown in the 
 Hudson River Valley, western New York, southern New Jersey, Puyallup 
 Valley, Washington, and about Sebastopol, California. The most impor- 
 tant commercial regions for the black raspberry are western New York, 
 western Michigan, and central Maryland. The hybrid purples are more 
 largely grown in western New York than elsewhere, but there are planta- 
 tions of them wherever either reds or blacks are freely planted. Local 
 markets are supplied very largely by home-grown fruits in all regions 
 where raspberries can be grown. 

RUNNING-OUT OF RASPBERRIES 

As with other fruits, diseases and insects take tremendous toU from 
 raspberries. Their control are subjects for entomologists and plant 
 pathologists, and a discussion of treatment cannot be given space in this 
 pomological treatise. There is, however, a condition known as " run- 
 ning-out of raspberries," that is exercising a profoimd influence on the 
 whole raspberry industry in America that must be discussed. Dr. W. H. 
 Rankin, who is studying raspberry diseases at this Station, writes as 
 follows of rtmning-out : 

" More and more during a period of many years raspberry growers 
 have been finding that their varieties gradually lose their vigor and are not 
 profitable; and that the reputation of red raspberries is suffering greatly 
 because the berries from the sickly bushes are flavorless, smaller, and 
 scarcely palatable unless disguised with sugar and cream. Canners are 
 unable to maintain the desired quality in their raspberry products because 
 of this trouble. 

" Somewhat similar conditions have more recently appeared in purple 
 and black varieties. Investigations into the cause of the running-out of 
 red varieties have established the fact that a specific contagious disease, 
 known as mosaic, is responsible. This disease is similar or identical to
