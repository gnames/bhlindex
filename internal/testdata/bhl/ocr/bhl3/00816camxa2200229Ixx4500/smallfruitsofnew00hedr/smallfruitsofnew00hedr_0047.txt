THE SYSTEMATIC BOTANY OF EDIBLE BRAMBLES 

The bramble fruits, belonging to the genus Rubus, family Rosaceae, 
 inhabit almost the whole globe, with the exception of the dry desert regions, 
 from the arctic to the antarctic regions; in tropical coimtries they prefer 
 the moimtains whilst in the northern temperate regions they are especially 
 mmierous both in the Old and in the New World, and occur from the 
 mountains to the plains, in woods and open fields, and down to the sea 
 coast. In the temperate regions bramble fruits are not only very numerous 
 in individuals but also in forms. After the Glacial period wide stretches of 
 land were open to them for colonization, and it seems that through these 
 increasing opportunities for a large reproduction the modification-power 
 of the germ plasma received a fresh and strong stimulus. Intercrossing 
 between different forms must have gone on simultaneously for ages, in 
 many cases creating an almost endless number of intermediate forms 
 filling the gaps between the more pronounced forms, which we are accus- 
 tomed to call " species," and making it difficult for the systematic botanist 
 to treat the genus in a satisfactory and intelligible way. It is of these 
 extremely numerous transitional forms that no two. studies, not only of 
 different botanists but of any one botanist, are foimd to agree. 

The North American Rubi, which concern us here as the parents of 
 some of our most important small fruits, are fortunately not quite as 
 badly mixed and variable as the Eiiropean species, but nevertheless they 
 offer an almost inexhaustible number of forms in certain groups. Besides 
 the North American species we have to consider some South American 
 ones and a number of species of the Old World, which are cultivated as 
 fruit plants and have been introduced into this country. A large number of 
 Rubi have been introduced from China during the last twenty years, among 
 them many ornamental shrubs and vines, some of them, however, only 
 adapted for regions with mild or almost frostless winters. Only a very 
 few of these, those kinds which furnish or are likely to furnish small fruits, 
 can be mentioned here.

Perennial plants, herbs or shrubs with erect, procumbent or trailing stems. The 
 herbaceous plants dwarf, unarmed; the shrubby kinds glabrous or hairy, glandular, and 
 mostly armed with fine slender more or less stiff bristles and variously shaped prickles. The 
 stems or canes of most shrubby species of the temperate region are biennial. They reach
