28 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

acute; lateral leaflets sometimes 2-cleft, terminal ones more or less rhombic-obovate 
 with a petiolule 5-7 mm long. Calyx-lobes narrowly lanceolate with a long point ; 
 petals oblanceolate attenuated into a long, yellowish claw, mostly 10-13 n^m long, rose 
 colored. 

Arctic and subarctic North America; from Alaska to Labrador, northern 
 Minnesota and Wyoming; perhaps also in the Old World. Differs from 
 R. arctic us chiefly in the more obtuse leaves, larger flowers, and narrower 
 sepals and by clawed petals. The two species are, however, very close and 
 not always easily separable. The fruits are edible but are not of great 
 value.

Dwarf Raspberry. â€” A slender perennial or subshrub, 30-90 cm high, sterile stems 
 flagelliform, procumbent, unarmed, flowering the following year; annual flowering stems 
 erect, weak, unarmed, and glabrous. Leaves 3-foliolate, on long slender petioles; stipules 
 obovate, obtuse; leaflets thin, all sessile or short stalked, the lower ones obliquely ovate- 
 lanceolate, the terminal one longer, all acute, all with mostly simple ovate teeth. Flowers 
 solitary or few together on slender pedicels, small; calyx-lobes ovate, acute, reflexed; 
 petals white, scarcely longer. Fruit red, with several drupelets. 

North America; from Newfoundland to British Columbia, south to 
 Montana, Colorado, Iowa, and New Jersey; in swamps and damp woods. 
 A very weak and thin-leaved plant; the fruit is of little importance. 
 Hybrids have been recorded with R. arcticus, R. acaulis, and lately with R. 
 hispidus. A near ally of this species is R. japonicus (Maxim.) Focke from 
 the mountain forests in Japan. 

R. saxatilis Linn, is another species of this relationship, with herbaceous 
 stems, small flowers, and red drupelets, easily segregating, however; it 
 occurs through northern Asia from Altai westward to Europe, and is reported 
 from southern Greenland.

Perennial or subshrub with annual stems, i.e., dying down in the winter, 20-80 cm high 
 or rarely more, pilose and weak-spiny. Leaves pinnately, 3- to 5-foliolate. Leaflets 
 ovate, acute or obtuse, unequally serrate, terminal leaflet much larger, 6-10 cm long, acute; 
 petioles and midveins with recurved prickles. Flowers 1-2, terminal, mostly 6-parted 
 and rather large; peduncles and calyx prickly; petals narrow, white. Fruit orange-yellow, 
 with numerous drupelets, fragrant, somewhat like a raspberry', edible.
