 occasionally grown for its fruit and was introduced by the United States 
 Department of Agriculture in 1898. It is reported to be hardy as far north 
 as Minnesota.

Prickly shrubs with woody, perennial, erect or more or less climbing stems. Leaves 
 simple or 3- or rarely s-foliolate, with mostly large, broad, dentate, persistent stipules. 
 Inflorescence loose, few flowered; flowers usually large with rose-colored petals. Fruits 
 large, not always juicy, with numerous often whitish tomentose drupelets. 

About 20 species, almost all natives of the Andes of Tropical South 
 America at elevations from 3600-12000 feet, one species is a native of the 
 Costa Rica mountains and one is known from the Philippine Islands. So 
 far only the following species has been introduced as a fruit plant: 

Rubus macrocarpus. Bentham PL Hartweg. 129. 1844; Focke Spec. Rub. 1:37. 
 1910; Popenoe Jour. Hered. 11:195. fig- 1920; U. S. D. A. Bur. PL IndusL Invent. 13,

Columbian Berry.â€” Canes erect, recurving at the tip, or half-climbing, about 3 m 
 long, stout, light green, villous-tomentose and with reddish glandular hairs and with short, 
 slightly recurved prickles. Leaves trifoliolate or simple and often lobed, large and coarse; 
 leaflets stalked, thick, ovate or broadly elliptic, acute, serrate, velvety pilose on both sides, 
 8-15 cm long; stipules large, subcordate, villous, 25 mm long; petioles 15 cm long. Flowers 
 single or 3-6 from lateral branches, pedicels 8-12 cm long, stout, like the calyx pubescent, 
 glandular and prickly; cah'x-lobes large, deltoid, pointed, exceeding the obovate light 
 rosy-purple petals; pistils numerous, densely villous. Fruits very large, up to 55 mm long, 
 elongate, light crimson to wine colored; drupelets relatively small, rather loosely cohering; 
 core succulent, extending nearly to the top of the fruit and at maturity often separating 
 from the drupelets. 

South Avierica; in the Andes of Colombia and Ecuador, from 2500- 
 3500 feet, in a moist cool region. The fruit is said to be " rather firm in 
 texture, not as juicy as most of the cultivated blackberries, and of a pleasant 
 subacid flavor (quite acid until the fruit is fully ripe) perhaps suggesting 
 that of the loganberry more than that of the cultivated blackberries."

Rubacer and Oreobatus. Rydberg Bui. Torrey Bot. Club 30:274. 1903. 

Erect unarmed shrubs with perennial stems, increasing in thickness with age. Leaves 
 simple, lobed ; stipules adnate to the petiole. Flowers large, showy, white or pink. Fruit 
 scarcely juicy, finally getting dry.
