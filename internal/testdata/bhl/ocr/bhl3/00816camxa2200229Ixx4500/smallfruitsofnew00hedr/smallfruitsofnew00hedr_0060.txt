36 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

branches 3-lobate, of a firm, almost coriaceous texture, glabrous above and softly grayish 
 tomentose underneath, irregularly and coarsely doubly incised serrate. Flowering branches 
 short, apparently only at the end of the canes, with one-stalked flower; peduncle tomentose, 
 unarmed, at the middle with a large, ovate-deltoid leafy bract ; calyx unarmed, lobes oblong, 
 lobately dentate ; petals almost as long as the calyx-lobes, obovate, often emarginate, pale. 
 Fruit very large, as much as 5 cm across, roundish or flattened, varying from orange-green 
 to purplish or black, with numerous large, very juicy drupelets, containing small seeds. 
 Hawaii; at about 4000-6000 feet on Mauna Kena, where " the atmos- 
 phere is always cool and the nights even cold, frost being not uncommon in 
 the winter," usually fogs prevail during the greater part of the days. Seems 
 to be allied to R. spectabilis. Native name Akala. It was introduced by 
 the United States Department of Agriculture in 1921 under the name of 
 the Hawaian giant raspberry. This Akala berry would be best adapted to 
 a locahty with mild winters and fogs, perhaps along the Pacific Coast.

 or creeping. Leaves mostly pinnate or temate; leaflets mostly acute, sharply doubly 
 incisedly toothed. Flowers terminal or axillar, generally few, solitary or loosely panicled; 
 petals white; stamens numerous, pistils small, very numerous; core soft at maturity of 
 the fruit. 

About 1 1 species, natives of subtropical and tropical eastern Asia 
 and the Sunda Islands, one species of South Africa and Australia. 

A. Stems 30-50 cm high, coming up annually from the root and flowering; leaflets lanceo- 
 late, acuminate R. illecehrosus 

AA. Stems higher, biennial or perennial 

B. Stems often climbing, leaflets pubescent on both sides R. rosaef alius

Strawberry Raspberry. â€” Perennial or subshrub; stems erect, 30-50 cm high, green, 
 angular, glabrous, with scattered deltoid prickles; petioles, petiolules, midveins and pedun- 
 cles equally with rather numerous similar prickles. Petioles about 5-6 cm long; stipules 
 lanceolate or subulate, long pointed; leaves pinnately 5- to 7-foliolate, leaflets thin, green 
 and with a few scattered hairs on both sides, oblong-lanceolate-acuminate and sharply 
 doubly toothed, 7-9 cm long, lateral ones shortly stalked, the lowest and the terminal ones 
 the longest. Flowers terminal and axillary, large, 4-5 cm across, 5-6 merous; peduncle 
 4-7 cm long, erect; calyx finely pubescent, smooth or with a few prickles, lobes 
 broadly ovate, suddenly contracted into a long often foliaceous point. Petals broadly 
 obovate, obtuse or emarginate, white; stamens very numerous, filaments flattened; pistils 
 very numerous, glabrous. Fruit red, large, of the size of a strawberry.
