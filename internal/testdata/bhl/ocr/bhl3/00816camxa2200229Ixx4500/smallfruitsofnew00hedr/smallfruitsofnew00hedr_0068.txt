44 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

pointed leaflets. Flowering branches green with remote slender prickles; leaves 3-foliolate, 
 leaflets rarely cordate at the base, pointed and sharply serrate; petioles and petiolules 
 pubescent. Flowers densely almost lunbellately corymbose at the top of the branches on 
 short and stiff pedicels, and a few usually 3- flowered clusters from the upper axils. Pedicels 
 and calyx white tomentose with numerous spreading slightly curved prickles, without 
 glands ; calyx-lobes ovoid-deltoid with a long tip, unarmed, reflexed. Petals oblong, whitish, 
 shorter than the cal>TC-lobes. Stamens numerous, filaments flattened, shorter than the 
 styles. Fruit hemispherical, black, edible. 

North America; from New Brunswick and Quebec to Minnesota in 
 the west, and south as far as Colorado and Georgia, but in the south restricted 
 to the mountains; chiefly in woods, along fences and in hedges; sometimes 
 a nasty weed. 

The species varies little; a variety, pallidas, Bailey Cyc. Am. Hort. 
 1582. 1902, or var. flavohacciis, Blanchard Rhodora 7:146. 1905, bears 
 amber-yellow fruits. Hybrids with other species have been recorded, the 
 most important see under R. idaeus. R. occidentalis has become a widely 
 cultivated plant with numerous varieties. 

The following is its Pacific sister-species: 

Rubus leucodermis. Douglas in Hooker Fl. Bor. Am. 178. 1S32; Torrey & Gray 
 Fl. N. Am. 1:454. 1840; Rydberg N Am. Fl. 22:444. 1911; Bailey Stand. Cyc. Hort. 
 5:3028. 1916. 

R. occidentalis var. leucodermis. Card Bush-Fr. 319. 1898; Focke Spec. Rub. 
 2:201. 1911. 

Very similar to R. occidentalis, and also very glaucous; canes armed with stout, flat, 
 more recurved prickles. Leaves of the canes also similar, 3- to s-foliolate, pedate; lower 
 leaflets sessile, lateral ones stalked, the terminal one larger, sometimes sublobate, teeth 
 variable. The prickles on petioles and petiolules and especially on the peduncles and 
 pedicels with a broader flatter base and more falcate or hooked. Inflorescence much like 
 in R. occidentalis, not glandular; pedicels usually glabrescent, not tomentose; calyx-lobes 
 acuminate. Fruit dark reddish purple or blackish with tomentose drupelets. 

Western North America; from Montana and Wyoming to south Cali- 
 fornia in San Antonio mountains at about 3200 feet elevation, and north 
 to British Columbia. It is a more robust and earlier plant than R. occi- 
 dentalis, with more yellowish canes and the leaflets of a lighter green and 
 less abruptly pointed. 

Rubus leucodermis var. trinitatis Berger, n. var. 

Leaves of flowering branches simple, cordate-orbicular, shortly 3-lobed, crenate. 
 Flowers somewhat smaller, calyx-lobes with a short tip, white villous. 

Northern California; Trinity County, near Douglas City; first collected 
 June 13, 1896, by W. C. Blasdale. This form with round simple leaves
