Andes Berry. â€” Vigorous shrub, canes half-climbing, 3-4 ra long, rooting at the tip, 
 glabrous, more or less densely covered with a white bloom, anned with scattered, rather 
 small, hooked, compressed prickles. Leaves 3 -foliolate, leaflets lanceolate or ovate-lanceo- 
 late, long acuminate, roundish or subcordate at the base, sharply but not deeply doubly 
 serrate, about 6-10 cm long, dark green and glabrate above, silvery white tomentose 
 underneath, with 9-12 lateral veins on each side; petioles 5-12 cm long, like the petiolules 
 and midveins with recurved prickles; petiolules 1-5 cm long; stipules subulate. 
 Upper leaves simple, lanceolate, bract-like. Flowers in terminal racemes, lower flowers 
 axillary and therefore the inflorescence often 15-30 cm long, glabrous or more or less tomen- 
 tose and sometimes with a few glands; pedicels stiffly spreading, sparingly prickly; prickles 
 almost straight and scarcely flattened at the base; calyx-lobes lanceolate, suddenly long 
 acuminate, 10-16 mm long, more or less tomentose, sometimes with a few short prickles, 
 strongly reflexed on the fruit; petals about as long, white. Fruit dark purple, round to 
 oblong-oval, 25 mm long, and 8-15 mm across, with large drupelets, tomentose at first. 

Tropical America; from southern Mexico to Ecuador and Peru on 
 highlands; first collected by Hartweg on Mount Pichincha in Ecuador; 
 also cultivated in Ecuador. 

This plant is much esteemed for its excellent fruit, the flavor of which 
 is said to resemble that of the red raspberry, being rich and aromatic. The 
 fruit is also compared with that of the loganberry, but is said to be better 
 and sweeter. The berries do not separate easily from the receptacle when 
 ripe. This bramble is known as " Mora de Castillo " in its native coun- 
 tries, and is used " to cover arbors and fences, or can be trained into bush 
 form, making a clump about 10 feet broad and high." It was introduced 
 into the United States by Wilson Popenoe in 1920; it succeeds on all sorts 
 of soil, but it likes a heavy soil and plenty of moisture best. It is very 
 likely an important acquisition for the southern and southwestern United 
 States, especially for breeding work. 

Rubus nigerrimus. Rydberg N. Am. Fl. 22:445. i9i3- 

Stems 1-2 m high, glaucous at first, brownish and shining later on, with numerous, 
 straight, compressed, long prickles. Leaves 3-foliolate, or 5 -foliolate on more robust canes; 
 leaflets ovate, acuminate, coarsely doubly serrate, of rather firm texture, green and glabrous 
 on both sides; lateral leaflets almost sessile, the terminal one with a petiolule 2-5 cm long, 
 like the petiole and midvein armed with recurved prickles. Flowers corymbose and axillar; 
 peduncle and pedicels with recurved prickles; calyx glabrous or sparingly glandular, lobes 
 lanceolate with a long point, 12 mm long; petals less than half as long, white. Fruit almost 
 black, drupelets tomentose.
