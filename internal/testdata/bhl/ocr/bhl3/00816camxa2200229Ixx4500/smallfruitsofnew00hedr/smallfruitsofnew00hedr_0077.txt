THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 53 

12a. Forma coMcfaizw Robinson & Schrenk. Femald Rltodora 21: gy. 1919. 

R. strigosus var. candatus. Robinson & Schrenk Can. Rec. Sci. 7:14. 1896. 

Leaflets much acuminate. 

12b. Forma cglandulosus n. f. 

Young canes densely grayish brown tomentose, with fine scattered bristles, smooth 
 and brown at length. Leaves 3- to 5-foliolate; petioles tomentose with slender bristles, 
 scarcely glandular; leaflets finner in texture, terminal leaflets cordate, broadly ovate, more 
 or less 3-lobed or lobately doubly toothed. Flowering branches almost entirely glabrous, 
 and also the petioles, pedicels and calyx without prickles and glands; pedicels and calyx 
 white tomentose ; leaflets of flowering shoots pointed and finely doubly toothed. 

Canada; Manitoba, Big George Island, Lake Winnipeg; large open areas 
 on the eastern shore. 

Plants more than 5 feet high (Dorsey Invent. Seed & PL Imp. No. 
 43197). Young canes very peculiarly distinct, the flowering shoots much 
 like R. idaeus vulgatus. 

13. Rubus idaeus var. acalyphaceus Greene. Femald Rhodora 21:98. 1919. 

Batidaea acalyphacea. Greene Leaflets 1:24.0. 1906. 

Rubus acalyphaceus. Rydberg N. Am. Fl. 22:448. 1913. 

Young canes brown or purple, tomentose or pilose, densely bristly, some of the bristles 
 stouter and stronger and flattened at the base. Leaves of the young canes 3- to 5-foliolate; 
 petioles, petiolules and midveins pubescent, prickly, bristly and glandular as well as the 
 peduncles, pedicels and calyx. 

Western North America; from Nevada to Wyoming, Idaho, and Mon- 
 tana, in the mountains. 

The cultivated varieties of red raspberries, as first grown in Europe, 
 were of necessity R. idaeus vulgatus. When these were imported to America 
 they did not grow as well as in their native country, and it was found that 
 varieties raised from the indigenous R. idaeus strigosus were more satis- 
 factory. At present American red raspberries show the influence of both 
 the Eiiropean and the American blood. Pure breds are scarce now, and 
 hybrids prevail. Most of our varieties are crosses between European and 
 American red raspberries, and in some supposedly pure reds a trace of 
 R. occidentalis is found. 

It is not always easy to determine to what botanical varieties of R. idaeus 
 a given cultivated variety may belong. If there is no reliable account of 
 its parentage, as is usually the case, one can only judge from the external 
 characters. European varieties exhibit, of course, the characters of R. 
 idaeus vulgatus, that is mostly pubescent flowering branches, mostly firm 
 and broad leaflets, thickly white or silvery white tomentose beneath, felty
