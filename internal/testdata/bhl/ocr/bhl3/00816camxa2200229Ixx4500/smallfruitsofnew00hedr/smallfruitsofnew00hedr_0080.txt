Sarmentose shrub, canes erect at first but soon curving down and decumbent or sub- 
 scandent among shrubs or creeping and rooting on open ground, terete, usually glabrous, 
 with a dense white bloom and numerous recurved, small prickles, sometimes undermixed 
 with some rare short-stalked glands. Leaves 3-foliolate; petioles and mainveins prickly, 
 puberulous and sparingly glandular, stipules lanceolate glandular-ciliate. Leaflets very 
 variable in shape, the lower ones sessile or shortly stalked, obliquely ovate and sublobed 
 on the lower, broader part the terminal leaflet stalked, ovate or rhomboid-ovate, subcordate 
 at the base, all obtuse or pointed, sharply, doubly or incisedly serrate, rather thin, bright 
 green, pubescent at least beneath. Flowering branches slender, puberulous, variously 
 glandular and prickly; flowers fascicled, terminal and from axillary peduncles; calyx-lobes 
 ovate, long pointed, more or less glandular, petals broadly elliptical, white. Fruit usually 
 imperfect, composed of a few large, black drupelets with a glaucous hue. 

Europe; from the Mediterranean to Scandinavia, everywhere common, 
 in northwestern Asia as far as the Altai Mountains. Introduced into the 
 United States by landscape gardeners as a ground cover for which it is 
 well adapted. It is a very variable species, according to locality. The 
 fruit is pleasant and not always imperfect, and as it flowers from spring to 
 fall it is perhaps worthy the attention of the hybridizer. Spontaneous 
 hybrids with other species, also with R. idaens, are not uncommon in Europe.

Vitifolii. 'Qa.W&y Gent. Herb. I'.is^T,. 1923. 

Vigorous shrubs with running, climbing or procumbent, terete canes, propagating from 
 the tips; leaves usually 3-foliolate, or 5-foliolately pinnate, or pedate, often on the same cane. 
 Flowers rarely hermaphrodite, usually by abortion either staminate or pistillate, the 
 staminate flowers mostly showier, and larger. Pedicels and calyx densely and adpressedly
