British Columbia to south California and eastward to Idaho; chiefly 
 along the coast, in the San Bernardino Mountains up to 3000 feet; first 
 discovered by Douglas on banks of rivers and in low woods in the valley 
 of the Columbia. It is a strong shrub with deep-growing roots and in places 
 is a troublesome weed. It flowers from March to July, according to the 
 locality. There is great variation in shape and size of the leaves, their 
 dentation, and the degree of hairiness and the presence or absence of prickles 
 and glands on the pedicels and calyx.
