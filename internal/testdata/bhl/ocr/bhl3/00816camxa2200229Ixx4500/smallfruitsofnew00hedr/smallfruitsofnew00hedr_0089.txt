Stems prostrate, 1-2 m long, terete, slender, brownish red, with very numerous bristles 
 mixed with scattered, hooked prickles from a broad base. Leaves of the turions 3- to 5- 
 foliolate, firm, glabrous on both sides, dark and shining green above, pale green beneath, 
 simply serrate, teeth mucronate; leaflets lanceolate or oblanceolate, tapering at both ends, 
 the lower ones shortly stalked or sessile, the terminal one stalked and longer, about 5 cm 
 long and 2 cm wide ; petiole and petiolules brownish red, bristly and prickly ; stipules small, 
 subulate. Flowering branches very short, with about 3 approjcimate 3-foliolate leaves, 
 much smaller and more obtuse than those of the turions; petioles puberulous, spar- 
 ingly prickly and without bristles. Flowers solitary or 2-3, pedicels 3-5 cm long, erect, 
 well above the leaves, puberulous, with small, straight or curved prickles; occasionally 
 also with soft gland-topped bristles. Calyx pubescent, lobes ovate, shortly cuspidate, 
 white tomentose inside; petals obovate, 15 mm long; stamens and pistils numerous; fruit 
 oblong, drupelets numerous, glabrous, black, calyx-lobes reflexed. 

Southeastern United States; dry fields from Virginia to Florida, Texas, 
 and Oklahoma. There are many varieties cultivated which probably are 
 this species taken from the wild into gardens. The variety San Jacinto 
 grown at this Station is one of them. The White Dewberry is also one of 
 these ctiltivated forms. It differs by having slightly angular canes, numer- 
 ous yellowish gland-tipped bristles, very prickly and bristly petioles, more 
 oblong, broader, and less pointed leaflets, which are of a paler, not shining 
 green. The flowers are produced on straight, densely glandtdar, bristly and 
 prickly pedicels, 10-15 cm long; sepals ovate-deltoid, pubescent, tomentose 
 inside. This may possibly belong to a different yet tmdescribed species. 

R. rubrisetus, Rydberg in Britton Man. Fl. Northeast. St etc. 497, from 
 Louisiana to Missotiri, comes near to R. trivialis, but it has more oval or 
 oboval, irregularly serrate leaflets and the flowers 3-7 together in corymbs; 
 pedicels glandular bristly. 

Rubus mississippianus. 'Qa.iley Gent. Herb. 1:171. 1923. 

Canes prostrate, long creeping, thin and slender, glabrous, bristly and with slender, 
 curved prickles. Leaves of the flowering canes 3- to 5-foliolate, shining green above,
