68 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

Rubus urbanianus Berger* n. hybr. 

Stems slender, procumbent, rooting at the tips, with scattered, recurved prickles. 
 Leaves 3-foliolate, petioles slender, prickly, stipules subulate; leaflets thin, dull green and 
 with a few scattered hairs above, paler underneath and pubescent along the veins, obliquely 
 ovate, sharply pointed and irregularly doubly toothed, lateral ones sessile, terminal ones 
 shortly stalked. Flowering branches and petioles pubescent, sparingly prickly; leaflets 
 rhomboid-ovate, acute at both ends, ciliate. Flowers solitary, terminal, peduncles pubes- 
 cent, sparingly prickly or unarmed, with one or two leaf-like simple bracts; calyx -lobes 
 ovate, acuminate or cuspidate, tomentose, adpressed or spreading in fruit. Fruit roundish, 
 red, with 8-10 rather large drupelets. 

Intermediate between the parents. It has the stems, prickles, and 
 stipules of R. hispidus and the shape, texture, and dentations of the leaves 
 of R. pubescens. The inflorescence, too, is more that of R. pubescens. 
 A similar hybrid does not seem to be known. 

Series 6. Setosi. Baxley Gent. Herh. lâ– .l^6. 1923. 

Canes at first erect or ascending and not over i m high, becoming decumbent or pros- 
 trate the second year, usually densely beset with fine not much pungent bristles, and usually 
 without prickles. Leaves s-foliolate; petioles bristly; leaflets glabrous or almost so, mostly 
 sharply serrate, veins prominent underneath, impressed above, giving the leaflets a plicate 
 appearance in the herbarium. Inflorescence shortly racemose; flowers small. Fruit 
 hemispheric, drupelets not numerous, sour. 

These blackberries of the Setosi group with their poor and sour fruits 
 are of little interest to the pomologist. They are natives of the northeast- 
 ern United States. The most outstanding species are R. setosus Bigel. and 
 R. vermontanus Blanch. 

Series 7. Cuneifolii. Bailey Ceni. if erfc. 1:180. 1923. 

Erect shrubs, with stiff, angular, downy canes and stunted, more or less hooked prickles 
 from a broad base. Leaflets firm, attenuate towards the base, and entire near the lower 
 parts, densely grayish or whitish tomentose imdemeath. Pedicels stout, grayish felty 
 like the calyx. 

A group easily recognized by its habit and the nature of its stems and 
 leaves. There are so far only two species known. 

A. Leaflets more or less obovate-cuneate, grayish white on the back, simply serrate. 

R. cuneijolius 

AA. Leaflets from oblanceolate to oblong-obovate, grayish on the back, sharply doubly 

toothed R- probabilis 

Rubus cuneifolius. Pursh Fl. Am. Sept. 347. 1814; Card Bush-Fr. 327, fig. 62. 
 1898; Bailey Ev. Nat. Fruits 378, fig. 89. 1898; Gray New Man. 7th Ed. 491. 1911; 

* Named in honor of George Urban, Jr., Buffalo, New York, much interested in horticulture, at whose 
 summer camp the plant was found.
