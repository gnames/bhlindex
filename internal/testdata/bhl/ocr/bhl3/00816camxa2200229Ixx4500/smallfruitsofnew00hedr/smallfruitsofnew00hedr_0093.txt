Sand Blackberry. â€” Erect laalf evergreen shrub or straggling and procumbent, 0.5- 
 1.5 m high; stems or canes angular and furrowed, brown, finely downy, along the angles 
 with scattered, stout, reciu-ved or hooked prickles from a broad, flat base. Leaves of the 
 turions 3- to s-foliolate, rather firm, dark green and glabrescent above, densely felty from 
 white interwoven hairs underneath ; leaflets obovate or cuneate-obovate, obtuse or rounded 
 at the top, cuneate at the base, 3-6 cm long, simply serrate with sharp, ovate teeth, entire 
 near the base. Petioles, petiolules and midveins tomentose and with recurved prickles; 
 stipules subulate. Flowering branches and pedicels tomentose and prickly; leaves 3 -folio- 
 late, uppermost simple, leaflets smaller, more roundish but with cuneate base. Flowers 
 3-7 together, corymbiform; pedicels short and stiff; calyx tomentose, lobes broadly ovate, 
 shortly cuspidate, white tomentose inside; petals obovate, 8-12 mm long; stamens rather 
 short. Fruits with reflexed calyx-lobes, round to shortly oblong, black, with about 25-50 
 rather dry drupelets, but of excellent quality. 

Atlantic United States; from Connecticut south to Florida, west to 
 Louisiana, on rocky and sandy soil. "A straggling briar of gray aspect "

 the stout prickles.

R. Lmkianus Collect., not Seringe. 

Similar to R. cuneifolms, but stouter, and stems stronger; canes more or less angular, 
 downy, with strong, more or less curved prickles. Leaves 3- to 5-foliolate; petioles stouter, 
 tomentose and prickly; stipules lanceolate-subulate; leaflets firm, larger, varying from 
 oblanceolate to obovate-oblong or obovate, obtuse but contracted into a short point, 
 attenuate towards the rounded or rarely subcordate base, dark green above, grayish felty 
 underneath, finely and sharply doubly toothed except near the base. Flowering branches 
 3-foliolate, leaflets shorter, uppermost leaves simple. Inflorescence similar to R. cunei- 
 f alius, terminal and axillar, corymbose; pedicels felty and prickly. Fruits larger and 
 juicy, drupelets with large tesselate seeds. 

Southern Atlantic States; from North Carolina to Florida and Alabama. 
 There are several cultivated varieties referable to this species; as, Perfec- 
 tion, Topsy, Nanticoke, and Robison. 

Some forms of this species come near to the Argiitus group. In herbaria 
 specimens of this species are occasionally found labelled as R. Linkianus 
 Seringe. This is, however, an obscure European species. Focke places the 
 name as a synonym of a form of a subspecies of R. candicans.

 one, brown, unarmed or prickly; prickles straight, mostly slender; plants almost glabrous. 
 Leaves 5-foliolate, thin; petioles slender, like the petiolules and veins, of a pale yellowish
