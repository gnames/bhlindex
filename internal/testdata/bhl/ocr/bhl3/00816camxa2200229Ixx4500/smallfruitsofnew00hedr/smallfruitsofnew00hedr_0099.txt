R. orariiis. Blanchard 7?/;o(iora 8: 169. 1906. 

Canes stout, erect, 1-2 m high, tomentose on the young parts, glabrous when old and 
 brown, angled and furrowed; armed with some strong, straight or slightly bent prickles. 
 Leaves of the turions 5-foliolate; leaflets stalked, ovate or oval, suddenly contracted into 
 a sharp point, sharply serrate, almost glabrous above, paler and velvety pubescent under- 
 neath; the lowest leaflets shortly stalked, somewhat attenuated at the base and more or 
 less oblique, the middle ones longer stalked, roimded or subcordate and the terminal one 
 subcordate or cordate at the base, broader than the others. Petioles, petiolules, and mid- 
 veins more or less \-illous and with recun.-ed prickles, not glandular; stipules subulate. 
 Flowering branches angular, villous, and prickly; leaves 3-foliolate, the uppermost simple; 
 leaflets smaller, more obtuse and coarser toothed, the lateral ones sessile. Flowers in 
 racemes, the lower ones axillar, racemes rather short, 7- to 12-flowered, rhachis and pedicels 
 rather stout, densely villous, unarmed or with a few straight prickles but not glandular; 
 bracts lanceolate. Calyx hairy, lobes ovate, shortly cuspidate, whitish felty inside; petals 
 large, obovate, white. Fruits oblong, large, black; drupelets large and pulpy, sweet and 
 juicy. 

Easter )i Xortli America; from Maine west to Ontario and Iowa, south 
 to the Catskills of New York. At the type locaUty, Alstead, New Hamp- 
 shire, this and R. allegheniensis grow side by side, according to Blanchard, 
 and R. pergratus is two weeks earher. Besides he states that R. pergratus 
 goes up to higher altitudes. According to Brainerd and Peitersen, the wild 
 berries are picked for the market in New England. R. pergratus is one 
 of the parents of a large number of our most important big-cluster black- 
 berry varieties. They are easily recognized by the eglandular raceme, the 
 rather long and obtuse leaflets of the flowering shoots, with long sharp teeth ; 
 the pedicels are villous, occasionally with a few prickles. 

Here belong the following varieties: Black Chief, Blowers, Early 
 King, Ford No. i, Fruitland, Early King, Kittatinny, Lovett, Mersereau, 
 Miller, Minnewaska, Sanford, Texas, Ward, and Watt. Some other varie- 
 ties may be crosses between R. pergratus and R. frondosus. They resemble 
 the foregoing, but the inflorescences are more leafy bracted. Among these 
 are the following: Brewer, Erie, Green Hardy, La Grange, Ohmer, Success, 
 Triumph, and Woodland. See also under R. allegheniensis.
