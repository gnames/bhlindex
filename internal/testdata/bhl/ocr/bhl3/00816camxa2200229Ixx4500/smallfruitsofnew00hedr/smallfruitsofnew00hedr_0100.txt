76 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

when young; petioles and petiolules copiously prickly, bristly, and glandular. Racemes 
 rather short, about 8- to i i-flowered; bracts small, peduncle or rhachis and pedicels unarmed 
 but densely glandular. Fruit small, cylindric. 

Northeastern United States; Vermont, New Hampshire. 

Rydberg, A^. Am. Fl. 22:463. 1913, takes this species to be a hybrid 
 between R. nigrobaccus (allegheniensis) and R. vermontanus; Brainerd & 
 Peitersen, Vt. Sta. Bid. 217:62, 63. 1920, explain it as a hybrid between 
 R. pergratus and R. setosns. 

Rubus andrewsianus. Blanchaid Rhodora 8:1 y. 1906. 

Similar in habit to R. allegheniensis, but turions not glandular; leaves also similar. 
 Petioles and petiolules villous but not glandular, very prickly, especially the latter. 
 Inflorescence short, broadly corymbose-racemose; bracts leafy, mostly unifoliolate, upper 
 bracts short, lanceolate; pedicels slender, spreading, pubescent with a few stalked glands and 
 prickles. Fruits roundish or ovate. 

Eastern United States; from Massachusetts to Virginia. 

This species was never clearly understood and the numerous specimens 
 collected and named by Blanchard, now in Dr. Bailey's herbarium at Ithaca, 
 represent more than what was originally described. It is certainly not a 
 synonym of R. argutus as it is treated in N. Am. Fl. I.e. 464, nor does 
 Brainerd's and Peitersen's figure and description, Vt. Sta. Bui. I.e. 52, 53, 
 correspond to Blanchard's specimens from the type locality. R. andrew- 
 sianus is still insufficiently known; possibly it is a hybrid. 

Series 10. Arguti. Ha-Wey Gent. Herb. i:i?,6 1923. 

Canes erect, sharply angled and furrowed, with stout prickles along the angles, plants 
 pubescent or glabrous, and without glands. Leaves 5-foliolate, leaflets mostly narrower 
 than in most of the other groups, oblong-obovate or narrower, the terminal leaflet usually 
 broadest above the middle; petioles usually pubescent. Inflorescence shortly racemose, 
 pubescent and prickly, without glands. This group comprises several cultivated varieties. 

A. Leaflets oblong or obovate; fruits black 

B. Leaflets obovate-oblong, sharply doubly toothed 

C. Pedicels stout, prickly R. argutus 

CC. Pedicels usually slender and unarmed R. fioricomus 

BB. Leaflets from obovate-oblong to oblanceolate, rather finely serrate. . . .R. laudatus 
 AA. Leaflets narrowly lanceolate, long pointed; fruits white R. louisianus 

Rubus argutus. Link Enum. y.do. 1822; 'Ba.Wey Stand. Cyc. Hort. 5:3031. 1916; 
 Bailey Gent. Herb. 1:186, fig. 84. 1923. 

Canes erect, pubescent when young but soon glabrous, angled and furrowed, brown 
 when old, along the angles with scattered, stout, straight or curved prickles from a flat 
 base. Leaves of the turions 3- to s-foliolate; leaflets oblong, acuminate and somewhat 
 attenuate towards the base, doubly sharply toothed, dark green and glabrous above, paler 
 underneath and pubescent along the veins; petioles glabrous like the puberulous petiolules
