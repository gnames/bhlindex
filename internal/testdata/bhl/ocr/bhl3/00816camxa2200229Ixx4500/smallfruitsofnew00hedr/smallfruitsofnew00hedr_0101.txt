and midveins with scattered, recur\-ed prickles; stipules lanceolate or lanceolate-subulate. 
 Flowering shoots short, hirsute and prickly; leaves 3-foliolate or the upper ones simple, 
 acute, more or less irregularly doubly toothed. Racemes short, about 6- to 8-flowered, 
 rhachis and pedicels pubescent and with a few scattered, spreading or recurved slender 
 prickles. Flowers 30-35 mm across; caljTC puberulous, lobes ovate-deltoid, white tomentose 
 inside; petals roundish oblong. 

Eastern United States; from Virginia to Florida, west to Lotiisiana and 
 Missouri and north as far as Indiana, and probably farther west. The 
 name R. argutus has been wrongly applied to a great many different plants. 
 Link's type specimen is reproduced by Prof. Bailey, I.e. 

There are also one or two closely allied species or varieties, apparently 
 natives of the southwestern states, with more glossy and subcoriaceous 
 leaves. To one of these belongs the cultivated variety Soft Core, which 
 was distributed from the United States Department of Agriculture Experi- 
 ment Station at Chico, California. 

Rubus laudatus. Berger n. sp. 

Tall and vigorous canes, erect, sharply angled and deeply furrowed, downy when young, 
 glabrous later on, more or less dark brown, along the angles with scattered, sharp, straight or 
 retrorse prickles 5-7 mm long. Petioles rather stout, pubescent, with a few hooked prickles ; 
 stipules subulate; leaves 5-foliolate; lowest leaflets almost sessile, ovate-lanceolate, scarcely 
 oblique, roundish or slightly acutish at the base; the middle ones stalked, larger; the terminal 
 one on a longer stalk, obovate-oblong to oblanceolate, shortly acuminate, subcordate at the 
 base; petiolules villous, leaflets green and glabrous above, paler and pubescent underneath, 
 prickly on the midvein and with 10-12 prominent rather closely set lateral veins, rather 
 finely and regularly simply or doubly serrate, teeth short, pointing forward. Flowers 
 7-8 in a leafy cluster; pedicels pubescent and sparingly prickly; calyx pubescent, green, 
 lobes acuminate; petals roundish ovate. Fruit oval, early ripening, black, sweet. 

Central United States; yet insufficiently known, but represented in 
 cultivation by such varieties as Bundy, type of the species, which originated 
 in Missouri, and probably Early Harvest. Here belongs also the variety 
 Kenoyer which is a hybrid with Kittatinny {R. allegheniensis). This has 
 pubescent canes, broader, and coarser-toothed leaflets, which are velvety 
 pubescent underneath.

Canes erect, angular and furrowed, glabrous, with retrorse rather slender prickles 
 from a broad base. Leaves s-foliolate, rusty velvety pubescent underneath, coarsely and 
 sharply toothed; those on the pubescent flowering branches 3-foliolate with obovate-obtuse 
 leaflets, the uppermost simple, ovate or lanceolate, simply or doubly serrate. Inflores- 
 cence corymbose-racemose, about 3- to 8-flowered; pedicels slender, pubescent, usually
