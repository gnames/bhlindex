THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 8 1 

several axillary ones below ; pedicels about 2 cm long, pubescent or villous, sparingly prickly; 
 cal}-x hirsute, like the pedicels with a few inconspicuous stalked glands, lobes lanceolate, 
 cuspidate, white tomentose inside; petals oblong, 10 mm long. 

Northeastern United States; Vermont. Although this species comes 
 near to R. recuroans and R. frondosus it differs from both. It is remarkable 
 for the variation of its leaves, chiefly on the flowering branches, further 
 its flowers are smaller than those of its allies; also the leaflets of the turions 
 are decidedly less rounded and more elongated than in those. 

Rubus amnicola. Blanchard i?/!oJora 8:170. igo6\ Bailey Gent. Herh.i:i()o. 1923. 
 Canes tall, erect, recurving, brown, angled, with scattered, rather stout, spreading 
 prickles. Leaflets on flowering branches oblong to oblong-lanceolate, long acuminate, 
 rather regularly simply or doubly serrate, softly pubescent underneath. Petioles and 
 inflorescence \^ous-pubescent ; bract leaves often simple, ovate to lanceolate, obtuse or 
 pointed. Pedicels short, sparingly prickly ; calyx pubescent, lobes ovate, shortly mucronate, 
 white tomentose inside; petals roundish oblong. 

Northeastern America; from Maine to Nova Scotia. One of the many 
 forms clustering around R. frondosus, certainly it is not allied to R. argutiis, 
 nor can it be a hybrid of this species with R. canadensis. 
 Rubus recurvicaulis. Blanchard Rhodara 8:1 s^. 1906. 

This is probably of hybrid origin, perhaps between R. recurvans and 
 some procumbent stemmed plant of the Flagellares. Most of the specimens 
 of Blanchard, now in Prof. Bailey's herbarium, Ithaca, New York, have 
 subglabrous leaves, but some are densely tomentose at the back; other 
 specimens are entirely glabrous and suggest some other origin. 

R. recurvicaulis var. inarmatus, Blanchard Rhodora 8:155. 1906, is a 
 hybrid form with some plant of the Frondosi group. 

R. rossbergianus, Blanchard Rhodora 9:7. 1907, is. another hybrid 
 form between some species of the Frondosi and the Flagellares. 

Series 12. Floridi. Baiiey Gent. Herb. i:ig2. 1923. 

Slender stemmed, elongate, erect or climbing, canes angular, prickly along the angles. 

Leaves 3- to s-foliolate, leaflets rather small, hard, and more or less persistent, on the short 

flowering shoots roundish obtuse or ovate and scarcely pointed; flowering branches short. 

Southeastertt United States; insufficiently known; there may be three or 

more species.
