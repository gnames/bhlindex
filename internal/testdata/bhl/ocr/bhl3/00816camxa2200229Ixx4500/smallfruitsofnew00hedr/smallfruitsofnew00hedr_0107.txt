THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 83 

Cutleaved or Evergreen Blackberry. â€” Very vigorous climbing shrub, canes 3 m long 
 or more, angular and furrowed, puberulous on the growing tips, but soon glabrous, brown, 
 along the angles with scattered stout prickles, prickles hooked, compressed and flat at the 
 brownish base. Petioles about as long as the lower leaflets, brownish, thinly puberulous 
 and rather densely armed with short, stout, hooked prickles ; stipules subulate, hairy. Leaves 
 pedately s-foliolate, petiolules pubescent and prickly, like the midveins; leaflets variously 
 pinnate or pinnately cut, especially the lateral and the terminal ones, the segments ovate 
 or lanceolate, acute at both ends, again deeply lobed, incised or coarsely serrate, the teeth 
 manifestly mucronate; dark green and glabrous above, paler and pubescent underneath, 
 at least on the veins, ciliate along the margins. Flowers numerous, in long, leafy pubescent 
 or villous and prickly panicles, leaves similar to those of the turions, but 3-foliolate and the 
 uppermost simple; calyx grayish tomentose, with numerous small, hooked, pale prickles, 
 lobes with long leafy linear-lanceolate tips, white tomentose inside; petals white or pale 
 rose, obovate, variously lobed, lobes rounded, the middle one shortly mucronate; stamens 
 and pistils numerous. Fruit black, globose, large, of good quality. 

Europe; first described after plants in the Botanic Garden at Berlin; 
 now escaped from ctiltivation and naturalized in the Pacific Coast states 
 from British Columbia to Oregon and perhaps farther south. According 
 to Focke (1. c.) it is a mutation of R. vulgaris Wh. et N., a species common in 
 western Europe ; Focke states that he grew similar forms from seeds of this 
 species.

 near the base, ovate or obovate-cuspidate, the lower ones oblique, the terminal one long- 
 stalked, subcordate, with about 7 lateral veins on each side. Inflorescence a long, leafy 
 panicle, pubescent, and very prickly; prickles broad based, hooked; leaves 3-foliolate, 
 uppermost simple, ovate-deltoid or sub-3-lobate ; axillary peduncles cymose; pedicels
