 Trees Am. 963. 1869. 
 Received by Charles Downing from Thomas Rivers of England with whom it origi- 
 nated about i860. From the account of the origin of Mr. Rivers' " Black " sorts this is 
 probably a purple raspberry. Canes strong, branching, with numerous greenish prickles; 
 fruit medium in size, roundish oblate, dark red, with slight bloom, soft, subacid.

 Trees Am. 963. 1869. 
 Raised by Thomas Rivers of England about i860. It is of the same origin as August 
 Black, and is probably a purple variety. Mr. Rivers propagated it from seeds, evidently 
 not familiar with tip rooting. Fruit medium or large, dark purple, very juicy and 
 agreeable. 

Babcock. Occidentalis x Strigosus. i. N. Y. Sta. Bid. 63:678. 1893. 

Received at this Station in 1892 from D. W. Babcock, Dansville, New York. Plants 
 vigorous and productive; canes purplish, with numerous weak prickles; fruit crumbles badly. 

Bagley Perpetual, i. Mag. Hort. 24:510. 1858. 

Bagley's Everbearing. 2. Am. Pom. Soc. Rpt. 83. 1858. 

This variety originated in New Haven, Connecticut, about 1854, and was introduced 
 in 1858 by Andrew Bridgeman, a florist of New York City. Plants hardy, branching, free 
 of prickles, fruiting on the young canes from the time the old canes cease bearing in July 
 until frost; fruit medium, nearly round, dark crimson, soft, acid; poor quality. 

Baker, i. Ohio Hort. Soc. Rpt. 57. 1868. 

A seedling of Four Seasons Red sent out by a Mr. Pamell, Cincinnati, Ohio, about 
 1868. Fruit short, dark red, soft, sweet. 

Bamet. i. Land. Hort. Soc. Cat. 196. 1826. 2. Prince Pom. Man. 2:165. 1832. 

Large Red. 3. Mag. Hort. 3:2^. 1837. 

This old English variety is said to have been raised from seed by a nurseryman named 
 Cornwall at Bamet in Hertfordshire, England. It has never been popular in this country 
 owing to lack of hardiness and soft fruit. It is similar to Red Antwerp but differs from 
 that variety in the canes being much inclined to branch and in the prickles being long, 
 slender, and reddish. Plants productive, branching towards the ground ; canes long, yellow- 
 ish green, thickly covered with slender prickles; fruit large, globular, inclining to conical; 
 color deep purplish red; drupelets large; flavor rich, pleasing, without much acidity; early. 

Barter, i. Wickson Cal. Fruits 506. 1889. 

Described as a foundling variety largely grown in the foothill regions of California. 
 It was brought under cultivation by William Barter, Penryn, Placer County, California. 
 Plants vigorous and productive; fruit very large, red, round, slightly flattened, firm, of 
 fine flavor. 

Bateman Early Red. i. Am. Card. 17:675. 1896. 

Mentioned in 1896 as being the earliest red raspberry, with fruit having the shape, 
 and two-thirds the size of that of Cuthbert.
