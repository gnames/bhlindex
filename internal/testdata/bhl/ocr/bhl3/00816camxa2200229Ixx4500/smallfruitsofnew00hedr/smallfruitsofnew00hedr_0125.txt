THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 97 

Common Red. i. Prince Treat. Hort. 39. 182S. 2. Prince Pom. Man. 2:166. 1832. 

From Prince's description in 1S32 it seems that his Common Red is not the same as 
 the American Red of other authors, although frequently given as a synonym of that variet\-. 
 He stated that it was a nati\^e of this state, growing naturally in the Catskill Mountains. 
 The fruit was esteemed for dessert and was used in large quantities in the making of rasp- 
 berry brandy. At that time it was the only variety cultivated largely for the New York 
 market, there being over one hundred acres devoted to its culture on Long Island. Prince 
 described the shoots as dark in color, very long, often reaching a length of ten or twelve 
 feet, or even more. This unusual vigor would indicate a hybrid origin. On the current 
 year's growth the basal prickles are purplish in color, those above being greenish, with 
 purplish tips. The fruit is of medium size, very early and of fine flavor.
