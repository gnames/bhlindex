THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 1 05 

This variety was discovered about 1820 by a Col. Lucas, Yamiouth, England, 
 growing in a garden attached to an old castle, formerly the residence of Sir John Fastolff, 
 whence the name. In 1842, Youell & Company of Norfolk commenced advertising 
 it under the name of Fastolff, and it soon became widely disseminated both in England 
 and in America. It was regarded as a probable seedling of Red Antwerp with which it 
 ripens. The fruits are softer, more roundish than Red Antwerp, and the canes are stouter 
 and more upright. In this country it was long popular as a home variety on account of 
 the handsome appearance, large size and fine flavor of the fruit. It is still cultivated in 
 Europe. The American Pomological Society placed Fastolff in its fruit catalog in 1852 
 where it still remains. Plants vigorous, erect, branching, very productive; canes tall, 
 brittle, light yellowish brown, with numerous stiff, purplish prickles; fruit large, roundish 
 conical, bright purplish red; drupelets large, soft, sweet, rich and highly flavored; season 
 medium, long.
