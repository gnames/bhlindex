 Sta. Bui. 278:124. 1906. 
 A chance seedling discovered about 1893 by A. O. Haymaker, Earlville, Ohio, who 
 introduced it in 1900. For a while it was popular in the Middle West, but as grown at this 
 Station the fruit was unattractive in appearance and inferior to Shaffer and Columbian 
 in quality. The American Pomological Society placed Haymaker in its catalog in 
 1909. Plants tall, vigorous, upright-spreading, fairly hardy and productive, propagating 
 from tips; canes stock>% with few slender prickles; fruit large, roundish to slightly conic; 
 drupelets medium in size, number and coherence; dark purple, moderately juicy, firm, 
 sprightly; good; very late. 

Heebner. i. Out. Fr. Gr. Assoc. Rpt. 119. 1892. 

Introduced about 1894 by W. W. Hilborn, Leamington, Ontario, who received it 
 previous to 1886 from Muskoka County, where it had been grown from seed of the wild 
 raspberry and had fruited for several years. Said to be of the Rubus idaeus type. Plants 
 vigorous, not as hardy as Cuthbert, productive; fruit large, roundish conical, dark red, 
 rather soft, juicy, subacid; good flavor and quality; late midseason. 

Helston. i. Jotir. Pom. & Hort. Set. 3:25. 1922. 

Received at the East Mailing Research Station and said to be a common market 
 variety in the Tamar Valley in England. Fruit of medium size, round and decidedly 
 acid in flavor. 

Henrietta, i. Cult. & Count. Gent. 42:618. 1S77. 

A chance seedling found growing in the garden of Mrs. E. Morley, Wethersfield, Con- 
 necticut, in 1870. Appearing promising, it was placed in the hands of Hale Brothers, 
 South Glastonbury, Connecticut, who named and introduced it. When introduced it was 
 thought by many to be identical with Belle de Fontenay. Plants short, stout, vigorous, 
 hardy, moderately productive; prickles slender, reddish; fruit very large, roundish conic, 
 irregular, bright red; drupelets very large, irregular; flesh firm, juicy, sprightly, rich. 

Henry, i. Can. Exp. Farm Bui. 56:47. 1907. 

Grown from seed previous to 1907 by William Saunders, Ottawa, Canada. Plants 
 vigorous, hardy, productive; fruit above medium in size, roundish to slightly conical, 
 bright to deep red, moderately firm, briskly subacid, juicy; good in quality; midseason.

 Herbert is one of the best of the red raspberries, and on the grounds of this Station 
 has long been the very best. It heads the list of its kind because of the great vigor, hardi- 
 ness, and productiveness of the plants, and because it withstands attacks of mosaic rather 
 better than most other red raspberries. Its most valuable characteristic is, however, its 
 tremendous productivity, being nearly twice as productive as the old standard, Cuthbert. 
 The berries are similar to those of Cuthbert, but are more sprightly in flavor, a little larger,
