122 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

Merkel. Occidentalis xStrigosus. i. Am. Cord. 12:369. 1891. 

Described as having large, hardy and exceedingly productive plants that do not 
 sucker; fruit finn, with a currant flavor, darker than Cuthbert in color and with the size 
 and shape of Gregg. 
 Michigan, i. Mich. Sta. Bui. 111:41. 1894. 

Michigan Early. 2. Mich. Hort. Soc. Rpt. 268. 1885. 

Introduced about 1883 by William Parry of New Jersey. This sort is supposed to 
 have originated in Michigan. Plants hardy but lacking in vigor and productiveness; 
 fruit small, conic, moderately firm, dark red, of poor quality. 
 Mildred. 1. Am. Pom. Soc. Rpt. 161. 1920. 

Offered by the Tipton Nursery, Little Rock, Arkansas. Plants described as strong, 
 stocky, prolific, enduring hot weather and drouths; fruit very large, bright red; high in 
 quality. 

Miller, i. U. S. D. A. Pom. Rpt. 27. 1894. 2. A^. Y. Sta. Bui. 278:118. 1906. 

Miller's Woodland. 3. Hills Sm. Fruits 71. 1886. 

Miller Red. 4. Kan. Hort. Soc. Rpt. 91. 1896. 

Miller Early. 5. Mass. Sta. Bui. 52:10. 1898. 

Originated with a Mr. Miller, near Wilmington, Delaware. This Mr. Miller also 
 originated the Brandywine raspberry. It was Miller's intention to introduce this about 
 1885 as Miller's Woodland, but his death prevented and the stock fell into the hands of a 
 grower in Sussex County who propagated it for his own use. It was not until ten years 
 later that the variety began to be disseminated. In 1894 it was described as very promising 
 in the Report of the Pomologist of the Department of Agriculture. It is probable that 
 more than one sort went under this name as descriptions of the plant vary widely. The 
 American Pomological Society placed Miller in its catalog in 1901 where it remained in 
 1909. Plants weak and semi-dwarf; suckers freely, usually hardy, moderately productive; 
 prickles slender, weak, medium in number; fruit of medium size, broad-roundish, medium 
 red, firm, not juicy, sometimes crumbly; fair flavor and quaUty; midseason. 

Minnesota No. i. i. Card Bush-Fr. 191. 191 7. 

A seedling of King x Loudon introduced by the Minnesota Fruit Breeding Farm at 
 Excelsior, Minnesota. It is similar to Latham but ripens about a week earlier. 

Minnetonka. i. S. Dak. Sta. Bui. 104:289. 1907. 

Originated about 1890 by F. J. Empenger, Maple Plain, Minnesota, who planted mixed 
 seed of Cuthbert, Turner, and a wild raspberry. From the resulting seedlings Minnetonka 
 was selected. At the South Dakota Station it was the hardiest of the cultivated varieties 
 and was of some value for that part of the country. Plants of medium height and vigor, 
 slightly drooping, hardy, productive and suckers freely; canes yellowish brown, glaucous; 
 prickles medium in number, small, weak; fruit of medium size, broadly roundish; drupelets 
 rather large, coarse, slightly crumbly, bright red, juicy, firm, sprightly; good; early 

Mitchell. I. Jour. Pom. & Hort. Sci. 3:28. 1922. 

This variety is grown considerably around Blairgowrie, Scotland, and by some is 
 thought to be some other variety renamed. Plants erect, stout, very productive; canes
