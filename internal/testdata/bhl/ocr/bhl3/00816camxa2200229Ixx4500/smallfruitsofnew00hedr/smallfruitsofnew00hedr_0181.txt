Fuller said in 1867 that this variety had been cultivated at least fifty years in the vicinity

 to any specific variety. It was displaced by better sorts in the East, but was popular in 
 the West much longer. Plants vigorous and productive; canes very strong, growing 
 eight to twelve feet long, without suckers and propagating from the tips; prickles few, 
 hooked; fruit mediimi or small, dark dull red, with bloom; drupelets large, soft, sweet; 
 very good.

 Acidity in its Taste, and is somewhat later in Ripening than either of the other two (the 
 red and white), for which Reason 'tis much esteemed for Preserving."
