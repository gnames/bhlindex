138 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

Rochester. 

According to a letter from W. Y. Velie, Marlboro, New York, received in 1916, this 
 variety came originally from a Rochester nurseryman. The stock contains many mixtures 
 and improved strains are claimed under the names of Coutant, Ward Seedling, Hyde, 
 Alright, and Barry. Plants described as medium in vigor, needing winter protection; 
 fruit is too soft for a commercial berry in wet seasons. 

Round Antwerp, i. Jour. Hort. 24:121. i860. 

Fruit described as large, round, deep red and much superior in flavor to that of Red 
 Antwerp; plants dwarfish, slow-growing, productive.

 1922. 

Raised by George Pyne, Topsham, Devon, England, in 1907 and introduced in 19 13. 
 It is considered one of the most promising of recent introductions in England because of 
 the very large size of the fruit and heavy crops. Plants vigorous, stout, nearly erect, 
 very productive and fairly drouth resistant ; canes moderate in number, heavily glaucous, 
 glabrous, dark reddish purple; prickles few, short, stout; leaves very much curled, with a 
 sidewise twist; leaflets strongly rugose, dark dull green, tip leaves often very reddish; 
 fruit very large, conic; drupelets large, firm, deep rich red, sweet. 

Royal Church, i. U. S. D. A. Pom. Rpt. ^g4.. 1891. 2. N. Y. Sta. Bui. 27&:iig. 1906. 
 Discovered about 1881 by Royal Church, Harrisonville, Ohio, near a field in which 
 Philadelphia, Herstine, and Brandywine had been growing a few years previously. It was 
 introduced in 1893 by Green's Nursery Company, Rochester, New York. As grown at 
 this Station it is a fairly good berry, but not equal to the best varieties. Plants vigorous, 
 fairly hardy, productive; canes tinged reddish purple; foliage crinkled, dark green, with 
 reddish tinge; fruit large, variable in color from light to dark red; drupelets large, inclined 
 to crumble, firm, juicy; very good; late. 

Royal Purple. Strigosus x Occidentalis. i. Farmer Cat. 20, fig. 1909 2. Hedrick 
 Cyc. Hardy Fr. 279. 1922. 

The fruits of Royal Purple are not as attractive in appearance or as inviting in taste 
 as those of Columbian and Shaffer with which it must compete. The variety may have a 
 a place in commercial berry growing, however, because of the great hardiness of the plants 
 and the lateness of the ripening period. The crop ripens one or two weeks later than that 
 of Columbian and has a remarkably long season, lasting until early blackberries are ripe. 
 The plants are also very productive, vigorous, and, as has been said, hardy, and moreover, 
 are fairly immune to mosaic although subject to anthracnose. This variety originated as 
 a chance seedling about 1898 with L. H. Girton, Bristol, Indiana. 

Plants tall, vigorous, with an upright tendency, becoming slightly spreading, hardy, pro- 
 ductive, contract mosaic slowly ; propagated by tips ; canes medium to slender but variable, 
 green tinged with browmsh red but gradually turning to a cherry-red as the wood ripens, 
 heavily glaucous; prickles short, medium in thickness and strength, few, light brown at the 
 tips; leaflets 3-7, large, the terminal often lobed, broadly oval, dull, medium to dark green,
