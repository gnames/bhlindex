146 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

ner, Pasadena, California. This is considered one of the most desirable varieties for central 
 and southern California, bearing some fruit every month in the year, and an autumn crop 
 elsewhere. As grown at this Station the plants are tender to cold, winter injury ranging 
 from five to ninety per cent. The plants are dwarfish, producing hght crops, and the color 
 of the fruit is imattractive dull red. Plants dwarfish, weak, upright, tender to cold, unpro- 
 ductive; suckers below medium in number; canes medium in size, glabrous, with numerous 
 prickles; fruit of medium size, roundish; drupelets medium in size, number and coherence, 
 dull, dark red, medium juicy, firm, very sprightly; fair; early.

 Pom. 210. 1907. 3. N. Y. Sia. Bui. 278:122. 1906. 
 Originated with MM. Simon-Louis Freres, Metz, France, who introduced it in 1865. 
 L. Ritz of Ohio imported it into this coiintry about 1869. Considered a valuable autumn- 
 fruiting sort in Europe but is of little value as grown at this Station. The plants are moder- 
 ately vigorous, hardy, and moderately productive; fruit below medium in size, moderately 
 firm, yellow, not very attractive; flavor and quality not high. 

Sweet Yellow Antwerp, i. Jour. Hort. 24:121. i860. 

An old English variety. Larger and with more orange than Yellow Antwerp. Canes 
 very slender, with few prickles; fruit of medium size, roundish obtuse-conic, light yellow; 
 drupelets small, soft, juicy, very sweet. 

Syracuse, i. Green Cat. 38, fig. 1910. 2. Hedrick Cyc. Hardy Fr. 280. 1922. 

SjTacuse is a typical variety of the Idaeus type. Neither fruit nor plant differ 
 greatly from those of Superlative. While hardier than Superlative, the plants are not 
 sufiiciently hardy and lack in vigor and productiveness as well. These defects bar it from 
 commercial plantations, but it is, however, an excellent sort for the home garden. This 
 variety originated as a chance seedling in a garden at Syracuse, New York, about 1900, 
 and was distributed by Green's Nursery Company, Rochester, New York, about 
 1910. 

Plants of medium height and vigor, upright-spreading, a little tender to cold, moder- 
 ately productive but variable; propagated by suckers; canes medium in number and stocki- 
 ness, green changing to reddish brown, glaucous, with eglandular tips; prickles small, 
 slender, strong, very numerous, purplish green; leaflets 3-5, large, thick, ovate to roundish 
 oval, dark green, with dentate margins; petiole medium in length and thickness, glabrous, 
 glaucous, slightly prickly. Flowers early; pedicels prickly, eglandular, pubescent; caljTc 
 prickly. Fruit midseason; large, broadly conical, light red, adheres well to the torus which 
 is roughish and pointed; drupelets rather large, with fairly good coherence; flesh juicy, not 
 very firm, pleasantly aromatic, sprightly, varies considerably in flavor; not above good in 
 quality. 

Talbot. I. N. Y. Sta. Bui. 91:204. 1895. 2. Ibid. 278:122. 1906. 

A chance seedling discovered in the garden of J. W. Talbot, Norwood, Massachusetts, 
 about 1888. Not equal to other sorts as grown at this Station. Plants vigorous, usually 
 hardy, productive; fruit above medium in size, attractive red; drupelets large, soft, juicy, 
 slightly acid; good.
