Grown from seed of Fastolff by Herm V. Tiirck, Potsdam, Gemiany. Described as 
 more vigorous, with larger fruit and earlier than its parent. Imported into this country in 
 1869 by A. S. Fuller from Frederick Maurer, Jena, Germany. Plants very vigorous and 
 productive; fruit very large, roundish, dark red, firm, sweet and aromatic; ripe in the middle 
 of June in Germany.

At one time a standard sort, and for several decades the most prized of the red rasp- 
 berries. Turner is now seldom foimd in commercial plantations. It is still grown, however, 
 for home use and local markets where hardiness is a prime requisite. The fruits are of 
 the very best quality but are small, many of them are imperfect, and a good many blossoms 
 are abortive. The season is early and the plants remain in bearing a long time. Turner 
 originated nearly 80 years ago with Professor J. B. Turner, Jacksonville, Illinois, suppos- 
 edly as a seedling of Red Antwerp. The variety has long been esteemed because of its 
 extreme hardiness. Turner was added to the recommended list of fruits of the American 
 Pomological Society in 1877, a place it still holds. 

Plants medium in height and vigor, upright-spreading, variable in yield, very productive 
 in number of berries but not in measured yield, extremely hardy, contract mosaic verj' 
 slowly; suckers very numerous; canes very slender, branching freely, silverj' green turning 
 to a distinct purplish or lilac-red, markedly glaucous, with many glands near the tips; 
 prickles small, very slender, weak, few to many in number, tinged red; new leaves at tips 
 of suckers markedly bronzed; leaflets usually 5, of medium size, variable in shape, dull, 
 rugose, with serrate margins; petiole slender, verj' prickly, slightly pubescent, very glandular, 
 glaucous. Flowers midseason, often imperfect, or abortive; pedicels prickly, glandular, 
 lightly pubescent. Fruit early midseason or earlier, with a long-picking period; small, 
 often imperfect, roundish ovate, bright attractive red, adheres fairly well to the torus 
 which is smooth and short pointed; styles noticeable; drupelets large, elliptical, cohering 
 poorly so that the berries crumble; flesh juicy, soft, tender, sprightly, aromatic; variable 
 in quality. 

Twentieth Century. 1. Card. Bush-Fr. 200. 1917. 

A chance seedling found in the garden of a Mr. Ford, Marlboro, New York, who had 
 been growing it for some time previous to 1905. The variety attracted the attention of 
 L. L. Woodford, Syracuse, New York, in 1905, who in 1909 named the berry Twentieth 
 Century. The variety is of the type of Syracuse, tender to cold and rather soft for shipping. 
 Plants of medium height and vigor, upright-spreading, productive, tender to cold, susceptible
