 fruits of its kind. The plants are characterized by their small, dark green leaves. The 
 green betokens vigor and healthiness in spite of the small size of the leaves. The plants 
 are as hardy and productive as those of any other black raspberry; the berries are large, 
 glossy black, very inviting in appearance, of good quality, and fall short only in being a 
 little too variable in size. The crop matures a week or more earlier than the well-known
