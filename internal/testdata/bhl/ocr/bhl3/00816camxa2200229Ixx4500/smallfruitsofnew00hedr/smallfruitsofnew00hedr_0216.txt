158 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

A thomless variety which originated about 1859 on the grounds of Mrs. Mercy Davison, 
 Gowanda, New York; similar to Doolittle, but a few days earlier. It was placed in the 
 catalog of the American Pomological Society in 1873 and remained there until 1883. Canes 
 strong, stocky, without prickles; fruit large, sweet; early.

Diamond was much grown in western New York for several years because of the beauty 
 and high quality of the fruit. It turns out, however, that it is very capricious as to soils 
 and climate, and is suitable to but few localities. Moreover, the berries are small and 
 variable in size. The plants are quickly injured by drouth and are very susceptible to 
 anthracnose. The variety was never much grown out of western New York, and seems 
 now well on the way to oblivion. According to information received from C. W. Stuart & 
 Company, Newark, New York, who introduced this variety about thirty years ago, the first 
 bush was found by L. J. Bryant, Newark, about 1888 in an old peach orchard. While 
 the parentage is unknown, Mr. Bryant believed that it might be a seedling of Gregg and 
 Ohio. 

Plants tall, vigorous, spreading, nearly hardy, productive, severely attacked by 
 anthracnose; canes stocky, green changing to light reddish brown, heavily glaucous; 
 prickles of medium size and thickness, strong, medium in number, greenish ; leaflets usually 3, 
 oval, attractive dark green, rather small, rugose, somewhat pubescent, with prickly mid- 
 ribs and serrate margins; petiole long, of medium thickness, glabrous. Flowers midseason; 
 pedicels prickly, pubescent; calyx smooth. Fruit late midseason; variable in size, broadly 
 hemispherical, irregular in shape, black with a tinge of red until fully ripe, adheres fairly 
 well to the torus which is roughish and rounded; drupelets of medium size and coherence; 
 flesh juicy, firm, pleasantly sprightly; quality fair to good.

It is doubtful if Doolittle can now be found imder cultivation, and this rarity makes a 
 technical description unnecessary. Neither is it necessary to give it a general discussion, 
 since in the account of the domestication of the black raspberry it came in for full dis- 
 cussion as the first black raspberry to acquire prominence as a commercial fruit. Once 
 the most popular of all raspberries, it was superseded after several decades of culture by 
 Souhegan, which, in its turn, gave way to Gregg, which is now succumbing in competition 
 with Black Pearl and Plum Farmer. A resum6 of its history, as given on page 14 follows; 
 This variety was found growing wild by Leander Joslyn, Phelps, New York. It was intro- 
 duced by H. H. Doolittle, Oaks Comers, New York, about 1850. The variety was known 
 under various names for many years. The American Pomological Society first used the 
 name " Doolittle," but it had previously appeared in the Society's catalog under the name
