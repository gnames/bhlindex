Earhart Everbearing. 2. Rural N. Y. 44:789, fig. 497. 1885. 

Found about 1870 in a grove near Mason, Illinois, late in the summer, loaded with 
 ripe fruit. Mr. Earhart, the finder, removed it to his garden, cultivated it for a number of 
 years, when it attracted the attention of G. H. & J. H. Hale, South Glastonbury, Connec- 
 ticut, who introduced it in 1887. It was considered one of the best of the autumn-fruiting 
 sorts, bearing a Hght summer crop and a fall crop on the new canes of the current year. 
 The American Pomological Society placed Earhart in its catalog in 1889; it remained in 
 the last catalog in 1909. Plants vigorous, healthy, sometimes not hardy, unproductive; 
 prickles stout ; foliage rugose; fruit small, dull, unattractive black, firm, not juicy, crumbling, 
 sweet; good; early.
