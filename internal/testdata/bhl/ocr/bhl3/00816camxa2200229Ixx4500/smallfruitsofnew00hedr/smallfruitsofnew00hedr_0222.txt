 Paradoxically enough one may name more good qualities for Gregg and at the same 
 time more defects than in aknost any other black raspberry. The defects are in the plants ; 
 the good qualities, in the fruit. The berries are about all that could be desired, — large, 
 handsome and of the very best quality; the fruit is about the best of all black raspberries 
 for evaporating, a smaller quantity of fresh fruit being required for a pound of dried fruit
