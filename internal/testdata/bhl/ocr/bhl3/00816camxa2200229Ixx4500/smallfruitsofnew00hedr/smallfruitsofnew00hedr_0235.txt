THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 1 69 

Cataloged by Storrs & Harrison in 1887; on trial at the Michigan Station in 1892. 
 Plants unproductive, very susceptible to anthracnose and easily injured by drouth; fruit 
 small, jet black with considerable down; poor. 

Miami, i. Fuller Sm. Fr. Cult. 143. 1S67. 

An old sort found growing along the Miami River in Ohio prior to 1867. The variety 
 has been confused with McCormick and has been given as a synonym of that variety, which 
 it is said to resemble. Plants very vigorous, hardy and productive; fruit large, black with 
 a brownish red cast, sweet, juicy; good; earlier than McCormick. 

Midwest, i. Card Bush-Fr. 159. 1917. 

Said to be a cross between Cumberland and Cardinal originated by G. W. Alexander, 
 Peru, Nebraska, prior to 1909. Despite the statement that Cardinal is one parent, this 
 variety as grown at this Station shows no Strigosus characters, and is to all appearances a 
 typical blackcap. Plants vigorous, upright, fairly hardy and productive; fruit large, 
 roundish oblate; drupelets of medium coherence; black, firm, juicy, mildly sprightly; 
 good; late. 
 Miller Daily, i. Horticulturist 28:21, 86. 1872. 

An autumn-fruiting sort found by Isaac Aliller, Clinton County, Ohio, prior to 1870. 
 Plants hardy, as vigorous as Gregg; fruit large, black, juicy; excellent. 

Mills. I. A^ Y. Sta. Btil. 128:341. 1S97. 

Mills No. ij. 2. Ibid. 63:674. 1893. 

A seedling of Gregg by Tyler raised in 1884 by Charles MUls, Fairmount, New York, 
 by whom it was disseminated about 1S91. The American Pomological Society placed 
 Mills in its fruit catalog list in 1901, leaving it in the last list in 1909. Plants vigorous, 
 fairly hardy, productive ; fruit large, dull black with considerable bloom, firm, juicy, sweet, 
 fine flavored; good; late.

A chance seedling, found in 1893 by Henry Wallis, Wellston, Missouri, and sent out 
 by him in 1900. Plants said to be very hardy and the fruits very large. 

Mohler. i. Ohio Hort. Soc. Rpt. 155. 1893. 2. N. Y. Sta. Bui. 81:586. 1894. 

Originated by D. M. Mohler, New Paris, Ohio, from seed of Eureka planted in 18S5. 
 As grown at this Station Mohler is a promising early variety well recommended on account 
 of size and attractiveness of fruit and productivity of plant. Plants large, vigorous, 
 fairly hardy and very productive; fruit large, black, firm, juicy, nearly sweet; fair. 

Moody. I. Mo. Hort. Soc. Rpt. 295. 1884.
