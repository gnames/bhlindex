170 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

Mulatto. I. Can. Hort. 28:25. IQOS- 

On trial at the Ontario Agricultural College prior to 1905. Originated with A. E. 
 Sherrington, Walkerton, Ontario. A yellow sort of poor quality; soon discarded. 

Munger. i. Am. Card. 18:255, fig. 74. 1897. 2. Mich. Sta. Bui. 171:287. 1898. 

Grown from seed of Shaffer, about 1890, by Timothy Munger, western Ohio; intro- 
 duced by W. N. Scarff, New Carlisle, Ohio, in 1897. On trial at this Station for two 
 seasons, it has not shown itself equal to standard sorts. Neither the plants nor the fruits 
 of this variety show any of the characters of its reputed parent. Plants above medium 
 height, vigorous, upright, hardy, only moderately productive; canes stocky, greenish, 
 heavily glaucous, with numerous, slender prickles; flowers medium in season; torus blunt- 
 pointed, slightly rough, releasing the berry readily; fruit variable in size, averaging 
 medium, regular, roimdish to roundish conic; drupelets numerous, below medium in size, 
 strongly coherent, black with a light bloom, juicy, firm, mild, sweet; good; late midseason. 

Munson Everbearing, i. Card i?M5/!-Fr. 159. 1917. 

Mentioned as the most reliable variety in Nebraska, but poor and small. 

Mystery, i. Minn. Sta. Bui. 25:247. 1892. 

On trial at the Minnesota Station in 1892. Received there from Kentucky as an 
 everbearing sort. Plants medium to large; fruit of fair size, lacking quality; not autumn- 
 fruiting in Minnesota. 

Nemaha, i. Rural N. Y. 43:544- 1884. 

Ex-Governor Robert W. Furnas found this sort about 1864 near the Missouri River in 
 Nemaha Coimty, Nebraska. About 1884 it was introduced by Green's Nursery Company, 
 Rochester, New York. It is very similar to Gregg, but considerably hardier than that 
 variety, this fact making it a valuable sort where hardiness is essential. The fruit is 
 a little smaller, a little later, slightly blacker and of better quality than that of Gregg. 
 Nemaha was placed in the fruit list of the American Pomological Society in 1889 and 
 remained in the last list in 1909. Plants vigorous, hardy, moderately productive; fruit 
 medium in size, roundish oblate, black, firm; good; late. 

New American, i. Stark Bros. Supl. Cat. 34. 1910. 

Originated about 1893 with D. J. Miller, Millersburg, Ohio. Stark Brothers, Louisi- 
 ana, Missouri, named and introduced it about 19 10 and have propagated it in a moderate 
 way since then. Plants vigorous, healthy, and hardy; fruit large and very firm. 

New Haven, i. Card Bush-Fr. 171. 1898. 

A chance seedling which originated on the grounds of E. E. Clark, New Haven, Con- 
 necticut. Described as having large, vigorous plants; fruit large, juicy, with small seeds.
