THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 1 73 

Originated with Jacob Muhl, Hammonton, New Jersey. J. T. Lovett, Little Silver, 
 New Jersey, introduced the same berry as Progress. It was tried extensively but seems not 
 to have become of any importance as grown at this Station. The plants are only moder- 
 ately vigorous and fairly hardy; fruit medium in size, dull black, firm, acid; fair; midseason.

This variety is comparatively new, but has been under cultivation long enough to 
 have its merits and faults judged. It is the concensus of opinion among the black rasp- 
 berry growers of New York that Plum Farmer is one of the best commercial sorts. The 
 plants are preeminently vigorous, hardy, healthy, and productive. Moreover, they with- 
 stand well the dry, hot weather that so often plays havoc with this fruit. Unfortunately 
 they are quite susceptible to the several diseases which make the growing of black raspberries 
 so hazardous in eastern America. The fruits, which ripen in early midseason, are large, 
 beautiful, of high quality and ship well. The variety may often be told in the fruit planta- 
 tion by its spreading habit of growth. The first plant of this variety was found by L. J. 
 Farmer, Pulaski, New York, in a shipment of raspberries from Ohio, about 1892, from which 
 introduction was begun in 1895. 

Plants tall, vigorous, upright to quite spreading, hardy, very productive, contracting 
 the streak disease rapidly, susceptible to anthracnose and rosette; canes numerous, stocky, 
 green becoming brownish red, very heavily glaucous; prickles of medium length and thick- 
 ness, niimerous, greenish; leaflets usually 3, intermediate in size and color, sometimes dark 
 green, and narrowly and deeply lobed, rugose, with coarsely dentate margins; 
 petiole slender, prickly, glabrous, slightly glaucous. Flowers midseason; pedicels prickly, 
 pubescent; calyx not prickly. Fruit early midseason, ships and dries fairly well; 
 large, broadly hemispherical, very black but not glossy, with considerable bloom, adheres 
 fairly well to the slightly roughened and rounded torus yet releasing the berries readily; 
 drupelets rather small, rounded, cohering strongly so that berries do not crumble; flesh 
 juicy, medium in firmness, sprightly at first becoming mild at full maturity; quality good. 

Prairie Queen, i. Ohio Hort. Soc. Rpt. 181. 1886-87. 

Mentioned in the report of the Ohio Horticultural Society for 1886-87 as coming from 
 A. D. Ashbaugh, Girard, Illinois. Plants hardy; fruit of fine quaUty; earlier than Souhegan. 

Pride of Ohio, i, Mich. Sta. Bui. 206:58. 1903. 2. Va. Sta. Bui. 147:60. 1903. 

A chance seedling which originated with A. D. Leffel, New Carlisle, Ohio, prior to 
 1909; introduced about 1901. At the Virginia Station in 1903 it was considered the most 
 promising new sort. 

Pride of the West. i. Mich. Sta. Bui. 81 : 10. 1892. 

On trial at the Michigan Station in 1892. Plants moderately vigorous and produc- 
 tive; fruit large, roundish ovate, glossy black; fair; early. 

Queen of the West. i. Mich. Sta. Bui. 111:52. 1894. 

Originated in Douglas Coimty, Kansas, prior to 1890. Plants more productive than 
 Souhegan; fruit larger and later than that sort.
