THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK I9I 

here from the pioneer days, and can now be found growing wild in the 
 woods. It is a very hardy plant with us, but does not do well in dry unir- 
 rigated soil. Requires a wet soil and moist climate to thrive. We have 
 sent quite a few of them into the Eastern States, but do not know what 
 success the planters have had with them. 

" They are propagated from either tips or cuttings, also from suckers. 
 There is nothing to beat them suckering. It is one of our best berries 
 for home use, but does not stand shipping. Very prolific bearer, medium 
 sized berry with abundance of seeds." — J. H. Settlemire & Son, Woodburn, 
 Oregon. 

" I cannot give you the information you requested in regard to the 
 origin of the Evergreen Blackberry. I can tell you about the plants, 
 however. They are very hardy and very productive and now grow wild, 
 or in out-of-way places in many localities. I have noticed this especially 
 along the ocean coast. They are full of briars, hence the berries are rather 
 hard to gather. They are good but not equal to several of our cultivated 
 varieties. They bear all simimer in enormous quantities, have large seeds 
 with beards which are rough in the mouth. The juice is of good flavor. 
 They are nice for manufacture of jelly." — O. P. S. Plummer, Portland, 
 Oregon. 

" In answer to your note of request regarding the so-called Oregon 
 Evergreen Blackberry, I think it is not a native of Oregon, but that it was 
 brought from Australia to this country in the first settlement. This is 
 all I can find regarding its origin. The quality of the berry is good but is 
 so late that it is not raised very extensively for market. It requires plenty 
 of water to perfect its crop. As for its propagation, it is usually from tips 
 or suckers. On cultivated land in this country it becomes a nuisance, and 
 will spread rapidly if any roots are cut or broken." — W. J. Magoon, 
 Portland, Oregon. 

" When I came to Oregon, about twenty-five years ago, the Evergreen 
 Blackberry appeared to be an old settler here. I am unable to give you 
 any information of the origin. It is not much thought of here as a money- 
 making fruit." — H. Freeborough, Monta villa, Oregon. 

" In regard to the Evergreen Blackberry: I am unable to give you 
 very much information, although I have the variety and it is a very fine 
 blackberry. I have known it for at least thirty years." — H. J. Geer, Core, 
 Oregon. 

THE HIMALAYA BERRY 

In the early nineties Luther Burbank introduced a blackberry which 
 he called the Himalaya Giant. His stock originated from seed sent him 
 from " high up on the Himalaya Moimtains in 1889 or 1890." In 1893 
 he relisted this berry " as an improved variety of Ruhus sp. Himalaya"
