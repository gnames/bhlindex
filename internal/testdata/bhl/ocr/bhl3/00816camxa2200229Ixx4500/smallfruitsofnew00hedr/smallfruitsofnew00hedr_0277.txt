than Eldorado, with a long ripening season, bearing blossoms and ripe fruit at the same 
 time. 

Alger. I. Am. Hori. Amu 85. 1871.

 deep claret in color, sweet, rich. 
 Allen. I. V. S. D. A. Pom. Rpt. 2-]. 1894. 2. A'. F. 5ta. Sh/. 278:135. 1906. 

Sent to the Pomologist of the United States Department of Agriculture in 1894 by 
 W. B. K. Johnson, AUentown, Pennsylvania. As grown at this Station it is inferior to 
 standard sorts in productivity, hardiness, and size of fruit. Allen was placed in the catalog 
 of the American Pomological Society in 1899, and remained in the last catalog in 1909. 
 Plants moderately vigorous, dwarfish, not hardy, moderately productive; fruit small, elon- 
 gated; attractive black in color, firm, juicy, mild; good; early. 

Ambrosia. 1. Card Bush-Fr. 215. 191 7. 

Of unknown origin. Introduced prior to 191 7 by A. L. & H. J. Bradley, Alakanda, 
 Illinois. Trial at this Station shows this to be a promising early variety. Plants of medium 
 height and vigor, upright-spreading, very productive; canes slender, pubescent; prickles 
 numerous, long, slender, green; fruit uniformly of medium size, conic, somewhat irregular; 
 drupelets medium in size and number, strongly coherent; glossy black, juicy, firm, subacid; 
 good; core soft; early. 

Americus. 1. U. S. D. A. Pom. Rpt. 27. 1894. 

Sent to the Pomologist of the United States Department of Agriculture in 1894 by 
 J. H. Langille, Kensington, Maryland. It was found in a field of Early Harvest and was 
 thought to be a seedling of that variety, although the plants and fruit resemble Erie. Fruit 
 medium to large, irregular, oval or oblong, conic, jet black, moderately firm, melting, juicy, 
 acid; very good; seeds large; ripens between Early Harvest and Erie.

 This sort has the reputation of being the hardiest of all blackberries and is therefore 
 a prime favorite where hardiness is a requisite. The plants are very vigorous, very pro- 
 ductive, with a characteristic stocky, sturdy, erect growth. While the berries are not large 
 nor especially handsome, they are of very good quality and keep and ship well. Ancient 
 Briton is still a standard late blackberry, and would no doubt be more generally grown were 
 it not for the fact that for some reason or other it is more often misnamed by nurserymen 
 than any other blackberry, so that it is now almost impossible to get the variety true to 
 name. The origin of this variety is somewhat in doubt. The most authentic report credits 
 it with being a Wisconsin seedling, found by A. H. Briton, for whom it was named, the name 
 later becoming changed to Ancient Briton. The American Pomological Society added the 
 variety to its fruit catalog list in 1875. 

Plants medium to tall, rather vigorous, upright-spreading, unusually hardy, very 
 productive, susceptible to orange-rust; canes moderately numerous and stocky, green 
 changing to reddish brown, dull, glabrous; prickles rather large, thick, very numerous:
