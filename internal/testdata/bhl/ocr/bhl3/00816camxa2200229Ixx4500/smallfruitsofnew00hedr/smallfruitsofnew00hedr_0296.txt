2l8 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

upright-spreading, half hardy, productive; canes stocky, reddish green; prickles very 
 numerous, large, strong; fruit of medium size, irregular, cylindrical-conic; drupelets large, 
 many failing to develop, black, juicy, soft, mildly subacid; good; core medium; midseason. 

Kenoyer. i. Kenoyer Circ. 1904. 

A chance seedling discovered in 1897 by F. L. Kenoyer, Independence, Kansas, by 
 whom it was introduced in 1902. It is supposed to be a cross between Early Harvest and 
 Kittatinny which were growing nearby. At this Station the plants require winter protec- 
 tion and are rather unproductive. Kenoyer was added to the catalog of the American 
 Pomological Society in 1909. Plants medium in height and vigor, upright, not hardy, 
 unproductive; canes medium in size, green, nearly glabrous; prickles medium in size and 
 number; fruit of medium size, irregular, cylindrical to slightly conic; drupelets large; 
 black, juicy, soft, sweet; very good; midseason. 

Kentucky White, i. Downing Fr. Trees Am. 445. 1869. 

Introduced by D. L. Adair, Hawesville, Kentucky. Plants tender; fruit medium in 
 size, oblong-oval, light dirty white; imperfect. 

King Philip, i. la. Hori. Soc. Rpt. 195. 1906. 

Originated with E. P. Powell, Clinton, New York. Introduced in 1906 by Matthew 
 Crawford, Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. Said to be very hardy. 

Kittatinny. i. Mag. Hort. 30:407. 1864. 2. Ibid. 31:272. 1865. 3. Downing Fr. 
 Trees Am. 445. 1869. 4. Rural N. Y. 42:248, fig. 179. 1883. 

No variety has been more widely or commonly grown than Kittatinny in the prime 
 of its popularity. It was one of the first good sorts and for more than half a century was 
 the standard commercial blackberry in North America. In particular, it is noteworthy 
 for its large, handsome fruits which are of the very best quality, having only the defect 
 of being variable in size and shape in some years, probably because imperfectly pollinated. 
 The plants are all that could be desired in vigor, but fail in hardiness, and are very sus- 
 ceptible to the orange-rust. The canes are stout and upright, giving a habit of growth 
 which characterizes the variety. This berry is a native wilding found in the town of Hope, 
 New Jersey, near the base of the Kittatinny Mountains, and was introduced by E. 
 Williams, of Montclair, about 1865. The American Pomological Society included the 
 variety in its fruit catalog list in 1867. 

Plants tall, vigorous, upright to spreading, somewhat tender to cold, productive, 
 susceptible to orange-rust; canes medium to numerous, stocky, grooved, green changing 
 to reddish brown or red when mature, dull, slightly pubescent, eglandular; prickles large, 
 thick, numerous, greenish; leaflets 5, oblong-oval, pubescent, with serrate margins; petiole 
 intermediate in length and thickness. Flowers late, few, in rather short, open, leafy clus- 
 ters; petals white, roundish; pedicels medium in length and thickness, with few glands; 
 calyx pubescent, eglandular. Fruit early midseason, ripening period long; medium to 
 very large, slightly elongated, variable in size and shape, quite irregular in some seasons as 
 if imperfectly pollinated, large and long when well grown, attractive glossy black; drupe- 
 lets large, roimd, with fairly good coherence; core soft; flesh juicy, sweet, rich, firm but 
 tender; quality very good to best.
