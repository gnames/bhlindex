In a previous chapter we have seen that Lawton was the second named blackberrj-, 
 and that it played a very important part in the eariy history of this fruit in America. It 
 long ago passed into obHvion as a commercial sort in eastern America, but is still grown 
 rather widely on the Pacific Slope. Lawton passed out of general cultivation because the 
 plants are tender to cold and very susceptible to the orange-rust. The berries are not at 
 their best until jet black, and are often picked too soon, when they are rather austere in 
 flavor, and this perhaps has given the variety a reputation it does not deserve for fruits of 
 poor quality. The variety was added to the American Pomological Society's fruit catalog 
 list in 1854. (For a fuller account of the history see page 184.) 

Plants tall, vigorous, upright-spreading, tender to cold, productive, variable in sus- 
 ceptibility to disease; canes stocky, green changing to brownish red; prickles numerous 
 large, thick; leaflets 5. dark green, pubescent, with setrate margins, in double series; petiole 
 long, thick, prickly, pubescent. Flowers in compact, leafless clusters ; petals white, roundish â€¢ 
 pedicels glandular, pubescent. Fruit late midseason, period of ripening long; large, hemis- 
 pherical to shghtly elongated, jet black but becoming bronzed when over-ripe; core large, 
 rather hard; flesh soft, acid at first, becommg sweet only at full maturity, rich, juicy'; 
 quality very good.
