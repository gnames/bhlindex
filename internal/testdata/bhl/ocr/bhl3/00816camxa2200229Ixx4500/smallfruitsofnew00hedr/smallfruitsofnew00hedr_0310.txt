Sanford. i. Ann. Hort. 128. 1893. 2. A'^. Y. Sta. Bui. 111:284. 1896. 

A chance seedling foiind in a clearing by Henry Merrells, North Sanford, New York;

Originated about 1902 by Luther Burbank, Santa Rosa, California, who introduced 
 it in 1912. This is a thomless sort descended from a West Virginia blackberry. Plants 
 very vigorous, canes reaching a length of twenty-five feet in a season; propagates by tip- 
 rooting, thomless, very productive; fruit medium to large, black, firm, sweet; excellent; 
 late.

Of the same origin as Santa Rosa, and differs from that sort in being a few days later 
 and a little larger. 

See Early, i, ///. Hort. Soc. Rpt. 125. 1878. 

Originated near Centralia, Illinois, about 1878. Said to be so similar to Bnmton

 1906, and introduced by him in 1915. Plants upright, not hardy, unproductive at this 
 Station; fruit of medium size, cylindrical, pearly white tinged yellowish, glossy, moderately 
 juicy, mild, sweet; good; core soft; midseason. 

Snyder, i. U. S. D. A. Rpt. 390. 1873. 2. Cornell Sta. Bui. 99:521, fig. 100. 1895. 
 3. N. Y. Sta. Bui. 278:140. 1906. 4. Card Bush-Fr. 228, PI. VII. 1917. 
 Because of the great vigor, good health, remarkable productiveness, and hardiness 
 surpassed by no other blackberry, Snyder has been a standard commercial sort for many 
 years. The fruits are far from being as satisfactory as the plants ; they are not inviting in 
 appearance, turn red after picking, and the quality is mediocre. Long a standard, several 
 other blackberries are now more desirable, although the variety is still grown from the 
 Atlantic to the Pacific except in the South. Snyder does particularly well on poor, light 
 soils and withstands neglect rather better than most other sorts, except in the matter of 
 withstanding drouths in a dry season. Both plants and berries suffer, the berries fre- 
 quently withering before ripening. Snyder is a wilding foimd by Henry Snyder in 1851 
 on his farm at Laporte, Indiana. About i860 the Laporte Horticultural Society named it
