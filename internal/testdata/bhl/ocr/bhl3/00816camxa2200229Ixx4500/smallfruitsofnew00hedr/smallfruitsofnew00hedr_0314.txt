Stone Hardy, i. Am. Pom. Soc. Cat. i8. 1881. 2. A'. Y. Sia. Bui. 278:140. 1906. 

A chance seedling which originated near Rockford, Illinois, prior to 1881. Similar to 
 Snyder, although some reports state that the fruit is larger and later than that of Snyder. 
 Stone Hardy was placed in the fruit list of the American Pomological Society in 1881, and 
 remained in the last list in 1909. Plants vigorous, upright, fully hardy, productive; canes 
 slender with numerous long prickles; fruit small, averaging about the size of Snyder, round- 
 ish, juicy, nearly sweet; good. 

Strawberry Flavored, i. Am. Pom. Soc. Rpt. 159. 1920. 

Originated about 1909 by J. M. Mack, Fallbrook, California. Introduced in 1917. 
 The variety is a cross between Himalaya blackberry and Cuthbert red raspberry. The 
 plant is of the type of Himalaya and shows considerable winter injury at this Station. 
 Plants tall, vigorous, drooping, tender to cold, productive; canes stocky; prickles numerous, 
 thick, strong, reddish; fruit of medium size, irregular, roundish, slightly elongated; drupe- 
 lets large, of medium coherence, glossy black, juicy, tender, subacid; good; core soft; late; 
 everbearing in California. 

Success. I. A^. Y. Sta. Bui. 81:582. 1894. 

Received at this Station in 1892 from L. W. Carr & Company, Erie, Pennsylvania. 
 Plants moderately vigorous, fairly hardy, productive; canes greenish, with numerous 
 prickles; fruit above medium in size, roundish; drupelets of medium size, juicy, black; 
 good. 

Sugar Plum. i. Childs Cat. 132. 1904. 2. Mich. Sta. Bui. 213:11. 1904. 

Introduced in 1904 by John Lewis Childs, Floral Park, New York. At the Michigan 
 Station the variety was without merit. The plants resemble those of the red raspberry; 
 fruit of medium size, irregular, roundish, dull dark red, astringent and disagreeable. 

Superb, i. Burbank Cat. 5. 1920. 2. Am. Pom. Soc. Rpt. 284. 1921. 

Originated by Luther Burbank, Santa Rosa, California. The variety is of the type 
 of Himalaya, the plants being described as more productive; the fruit larger, highly flavored, 
 sweet and delicious. 

Tartarian, i. Farmer Seed & Nur. Cat. 106. 1918. 

Introduced by the Farmer Seed & Nursery Company, Faribault, Minnesota. Plants 
 described as strong, free from rust, very hardy and productive; fruit large, bright black, 
 sweet, melting; of fine quality; core soft; season long. 

Taylor, i. Cult. & Count. Gent. 42:150. 1877. 2. Cornell Sta. Bui. 99:523, fig. 104. 
 1895. 3. N. Y. Sta. Bui. 278:137. 1906. 

Taylor's Prolific. 4. la. Hort. Soc. Rpt. 418. 1882. 

Long a favorite commercial sort to follow Snyder, Taylor is now passing from cultiva- 
 tion because of faults of both fruits and plants. While the plants are hardy and remark- 
 ably immune to rust, they are not productive, or at best moderately so, and the fruits are 
 only fair in quality and appearance. The plants also have the fault of overbearing in 
 which case the fruits are small and poor in flavor. To offset this characteristic the plants 
 should be pruned more closely than any other blackberry except Early Harvest, which 
 often has the same failing. The plants may be told in blackberry plantations by the
