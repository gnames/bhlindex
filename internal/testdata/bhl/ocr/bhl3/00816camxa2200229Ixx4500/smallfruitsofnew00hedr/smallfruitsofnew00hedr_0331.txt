Under this name H. Ness, horticulturist at the Texas Station, sent out in 1920 nine 
 different selections of third generation seedlings of a cross between the Louisiana dewberry, 
 Rubus rubrisetus, and Brilliant red raspberry, made by him at the Texas Station in 1913. 
 The differences between these strains are not great. 

Plants vigorous, resembling the raspberry, at first prostrate, but later becoming 
 bushy and more erect; canes large, round; foliage thick; fruit separates from the pedicel 
 with difficulty, large, roundish, dark red; drupelets large, adhering to the core; flavor mildly 
 acid, resembling the raspberry; season the first of May imtU August in Texas.

 in the fruit being sweeter, with more of a raspberry flavor and less inclined to mold in damp 
 weather.

A discussion of this sort on pages 83 and 189 in previous chapters suffices to indicate 
 its status for the blackberry regions of the country and to show its interesting characters 
 to growers and students of bramble fruits. Its history is also set forth on the pages just 
 given. The following description is taken from plants as they grow on the grounds of the 
 New York Agricultural Experiment Station.
