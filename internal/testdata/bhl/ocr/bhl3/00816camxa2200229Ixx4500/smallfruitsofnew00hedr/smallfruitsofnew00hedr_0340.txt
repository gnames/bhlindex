246 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

that they could not buy sorts true to name. Currants were at this time, 
 probably for some years before, propagated from cuttings, although suckers 
 and layers are still recommended. 

Phillips in his Pomariuni Britannicum, 1820, may be quoted to show 
 the purposes for which currants were chiefly grown a hundred years ago 
 as compared with the present. They were less esteemed then to eat out of 
 hand than for medicinal and beverage purposes. Thus Phillips* says: 

"At the dessert, they are greatly esteemed, being found cooling and 
 grateful to the stomach; and they are as much admired for their trans- 
 parent beauty, as for their medicinal qualities, being moderately refrigerant, 
 antiseptic, attenuant, and aperient. They may be used with advantage 
 to allay thirst in most febrile complaints, to lessen an increased secretion 
 of bile, and to correct a putrid and scorbutic state of the fluids, especially 
 in sanguine temperaments: but in constitutions of a contrary kind, they are 
 apt to occasion flatulency and indigestion. Brookes says, they strengthen 
 the stomach, excite appetite, and are good against vomiting." And again: ^ 

" The wine made from the white ciurants, if rich of fruit, so as to require 
 little sugar, is, when kept to a proper age, of a similar flavour to the Grave 
 and Rhenish wines; and I have known it preferred as a summer table wine. 
 Even in London this agreeable beverage may be made at less expence than 
 moderate cider can be bought for. Diluted in water, this wine is an excellent 
 drink in the hot season, particularly to those of feverish habits. It makes 
 an excellent shrub; and the juice is a pleasant acid in punch, which, about 
 thirty years back, was a favourite beverage in the coffee-houses in Paris." 

Phillips names the red and white currant as the kinds cultivated in 
 1820, but says "the salmon color, or champaigne, is cultivated for variety." 
 Other varieties were to be found, however, as we shall see in the next 
 paragraphs. 

In the Catalogue of Fruits cultivated in the Garden of the Horticultural 
 Society of London, 1826, 35 species and varieties of currants are named, but 
 judging from the names not more than 20 of these are inhabitants of fruit 
 gardens, and some of these are of doubtftil standing, as the catalog makes 
 the following statement, true now as then:^ 

" There is perhaps no class of fruits in which so much ignorance exists 
 of the merits and differences of the varieties, as the Red and White Cur- 
 rants of the Gardens. It is impossible to obtain the different kinds with 
 certainty from the Nurseries, although there is no doubt that their respec-
