Key to Cultivated Species and Hybrids of Red Currants 

A. Flowers flat, rotate, or saucer-shaped with a more or less distinctly raised ring in the 

bottom of the flower 

B. Ring very distinct, often of a dark color; anthers with a very broad connective. 

Leaves heart-shaped at the base; remains of the withered flower on the berries 

pentagonal at the base 

C. Leaves 3- to 5-lobed, lobes spreading, mostly slightly pubescent, at length 

glabrous beneath R. sativtim 

CC. Leaves 3- to s-lobed, the middle lobe the largest, of very firm texture and of a 
 dark, almost bluish green, nearlj'- smooth and glossy beneath; with big coarse 

teeth and coarse venation ; berries very large R. sativum macrocarpum 

BB. Ring present, but rather low and less distinct and the flowers not quite as flat. 

Bases of lea^^es varying from truncate to almost heart-shaped; remains of the 

withered flowers at the bases more or less roundish 

C. Sepals not ciliate. Racemes drooping. Young shoots slightly pubescent ; leaves 

mostly with truncate base, pubescent beneath. Anthers variable, but mostly 

with a broadened connective 

R. houghtoiiiamim {R. rubrum x sativum). (See also R. warscewicsii) 
 CC. Sepals ciliate. Racemes spreading horizontally. Young shoots glabrous. 

Anthers roundish ovoid, white R. gonduini {R. petraeum x sativum) 

AA. Flowers pelviform or shallowly cup-shaped or bell-shaped 

B. Sepals not or only very faintly ciliate; flowers pelviform or shallowly cup-shaped 
 C. Flowers without any ring, somewhat conically raised at the bottom of the style 
 (best seen in a longitudinal section). Racemes spreading, more or less glandu- 
 lar. Leaves with a truncate or subcordate base, pubescent beneath. Withered 

remains of the flower on the berries with a roundish base R. rubrum, 

CC. Flowers with a flat bottom, on which a very faint ring is traceable on a longitudinal 
 section; flowers, anthers, and berries larger than in R. rubrum. Racemes 

drooping. Leaves heart-shaped. Berries very acid R. warscemiczii 

BB. Sepals ciliate; flowers decidedly bell-shaped, not shallowly cup-shaped 

C. Flowers rather large, with a semi-inferior receptacle, the upper part prolonged 
 and forming a stout conical base of the style; petals inserted on a thickened 

base R. petraeum 

CC. Flowers with a distinctly inferior ovary, petals also inserted on a thickened 
 base 
 D. Flowers with a faint ring at the bottom. Leaves rather large, truncate or 

cordate, 3- to 5-lobed. Vegetation early 

R. gonduini {R. petraeum x sativum) 
 DD. Flowers without any trace of a ring 

E. Stamens longer with curved filaments as long as the petals. Leaves large, 

3- to 5-lobed, subpubescent, base truncate or subcordate 

R. pallidum (R. petraeum x rubrum) 
 EE. Stamens straight, shorter than the petals. Leaves medium in size, strongly 

pubescent beneath, petiole short, tomentose 

R. holosericeum {R. petraeum caucasicum x rubrum) 

Ribes sativum Rchbch. Syme Engl. Bot. 3d Ed. 4:42. t. 520. 1865; Berger N. Y. Sta.
