Rock Currant. â€” Shrub 1-2 m high or more; growing shoots hirsute, generally glabrous 
 later on, and grajash brown; older branches somewhat like those of the cherry, with dis- 
 tinct warts; buds conical, deep brown. Leaves roundish, 3- to 5- lobed, lobes more or less 
 pointed, the middle one prominent, bullate between the veins, pubescent on both sides 
 when young, smoother later on, dark green above, beneath more or less pubescent, at least 
 along the veins, the base varying from deeply cordate to truncate, variable in size, 
 reaching up to 15 cm, more or less doubly toothed. Petiole generally shorter than the 
 blade, ciliate near the base. Racemes variably long, erect, patent or drooping, densely 
 flowered; rhachis and pedicels more or less pubescent, bracts small; pedicels short, 
 mostly twice as long as the bracts. Flowers green, suffused with purple, subcampanidate. 
 Receptacle cup-shaped, or slightly bell-shaped, with a round hump below the insertion 
 of each petal; sepals roimdish spatulate, broader than long, spreading in their upper part, 
 finely ciliate; petals rather large, spatulate or fan-shaped, as long as the erect base of the 
 sepals; stamens inserted below the petals, ctirved with a thickened base, the anthers 
 roimdish ovoid, overtopping the petals. Ovary semi-inferior, its upper part conically 
 prolonged and gradually passing in the shortly cleft style, which is about as high as the 
 stamens. Ovary top-shaped. Fruits round, flattened at the poles, red or blackish red, 
 with the remains of the flower roundish, acidulous. 

Europe, northwestern Africa {Atlas), and northern Asia. Perhaps as 
 far as the Sea of Ochotsk. High mountains. The European plants of 
 this species occur in three forms. 

(a) forma: pyrenaica. 

Leaves rugose, with scattered long hairs above, along the margin, and beneath along 
 the veins, especially hairy when yoxmg; lobes pointed, teeth with a sharp and rather long 
 cusp; petioles pubescent, with long spreading glandular hairs, especially when young. 
 Bracts strongly ciliate. 
 Pyrenees. 

(b) forma: alpina. 

Leaves rugose, with scattered hairs, etc., like in f. pyrenaica, though less abundant, 
 also the petioles less hairy and glandular. Bracts shorter, obtuse, less strongly ciliate. 
 Alps, Vosges, and Black Forest. 

(c) forma: carpathica Kit. Berger N. Y. Sta. Tech. Bui. 109:16. 1925. 

R. carpathicum. Kitaibel in Schultes Oesterreich. Flora, 2nd Ed. 1:432. 1814. 
 Leaves flat, almost glabrous on both sides, also beneath along the veins, only when 
 young with a few scattered hairs; lobes pointed, teeth less sharply mucronate than in f.
