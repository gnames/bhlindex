266 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

pubescence underneath. This hybrid has almost entirely sterile poUen 
 and is of little value as a fruit plant. 

The hybrid of the rock currant, R. petraeum, with the red currant, 
 R. sativum, is named R. gonduini, Janczewski Bui. Ac. Set. Nat. Crac. 
 298. 1 90 1. It has large rather short 3- to 5-lobed leaves. The racemes 
 are similar to those of R. sativum, spreading; the flowers equally intermediate, 
 with refiexed ciliate sepals and a faint ring inside; the anthers are oblong 
 like those of R. petraeum. It originated in the nursery of M. Gondouin at 
 St. Cloud, and is known as " Gondouin " or " Grosseillier Gondouin rouge " 
 or " sehr friihe Hochrote." It resembles the R. pallidum (Prince Albert), 
 but the leaves are thicker and darker, and the flowers have a faint ring 
 inside. It retains its leaves late in the fall.

Black Currants. — Deciduous shrubs except for R. mburnifolium; young shoots glabrous 
 or downy with sessile yellow resinous dots or glands on all the young parts, on the scales of 
 the winter buds, and chiefly on the back of the leaves; the whole plant of a distinct, often 
 disagreeable odor. Leaves 3- to 5- to 7-lobed, lobes generally pointed, and shortly or 
 incisedly serrate, resinous dotted sometimes also on the upper surface. Racemes varying 
 in the different species in length, drooping or erect. Receptacle varying from cup-shaped to 
 campanulate-tubular, often resinous dotted, sepals spreading or recurved. Stamens inserted 
 at about the same level as the petals, anthers roundish. Ovary glabrous, in most cases 
 with resinous dots or glands, generally inferior, but in some species distinctly semi-inferior 
 and its upper part extending into the bottom of the receptacle. Style mostly shortly bifid. 
 Fruits black or brownish, sometimes edible, but mostly of a special, often disagreeable 
 flavor. 

This subgenus comprises 12 species, all natives of the Northern Hemis- 
 phere, extending south to northern Mexico. 

Only two species are important as fruit plants. 
 A. Racemes 5- to is-fiowered 

B. Flowers tomentose, campanulate-urceolate R. nigrum 

BB. Flowers pubescent or glabrous, tubular-campanulate R. americanum 

AA. Racemes 3- to 5-flowered, broadly campanulate R. culverwellii
