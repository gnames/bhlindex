278 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

base; petals half as long, obovate-cuneate slightly revolute at the top, white or faintly 
 tinged with red, sometimes with a few hairs at the back; stamens white, as long as the sepals, 
 anthers greenish yellow, oblong. Berry roundish oval, dark red, pubescent or glabrous 
 with a thin skin; seeds small, numerous. 

Janczewski founded this hybrid on the variety Pale Red. A variety 
 which originated in 1833 in the nursery of Abel Houghton, Lynn, Massa- 
 chusetts, also belongs here. It is known as the Houghton gooseberry. This 
 hybrid comes very near G. downingiana. Of course there may be forms 
 intermediate between this and G. downingiana.

Hawthorn-leaved Gooseberry. â€” Low shrub of spreading or reclining habit, young 
 branches pubescent, glabrous later on, grayish, mostly very bristly; nodal spines 3 or more, 
 straight, subulate, i cm long. Dry bud-scales bearded with a white tomentose margin. 
 Leaves suborbicular, usually broader than long, slightly cordate or tnmcate or broadly 
 cuneate at the base, rather deeply s-lobed, lobes obtuse, dentate, on both sides slightly 
 pubescent or nearly glabrous, 2-4 cm wide; petioles shorter than the blades, pubescent and 
 sometimes with a few glandular hairs and scattered plumose fringes. Peduncles very short, 
 scarcely longer than the bud-scales, i- to 2 -flowered; pedicels short, glabrous, bracts small, 
 often glandular-ciliate. Ovary roundish, smooth, and glabrous; receptacle campanula te, 
 greenish white, glabrous, 2.5-3.5 mm long; sepals oblong, obtuse, spreading or reflexed, 
 usually slightly exceeding the receptacle, whitish; petals about 2 mm long or f as long as 
 the sepals or more, obovate, obtuse, white; stamens as long as the petals, anthers oblong, 
 scarcely i mm long; style bifid, hairy. Berry globose, smooth, 10-13 rnni across, purple, 
 slightly bloomy, sweet and good flavored. 

North America; from Newfoundland and the Hudson Bay to British 
 Columbia and the Yukon, south to North Dakota and northern Michi- 
 gan. This species is usually confused with G. irrigua, G. hirtella, and 
 G. setosa. The latter has, however, brown shoots, longer pedvmcles and 
 longer, cylindric-campanulate calyx-tubes; G. hirtella has the stamens 
 twice as long as the petals and as long or longer than the sepals and mostly 
 cuneate leaves; G. irrigua is less bristly, the peduncles well exserted from 
 the bud-scales and the perianth is a little larger, about 8-10 mm. long.
