Of little importance in New York and the East, London Market is considered a ven,' 
 good red currant in parts of the Middle West. It seems to withstand hot, dry weather 
 rather better than most other sorts, and the plants are resistant to currant borers and 
 currant diseases. It is said to be the most resistant of all red currants to the pine blister- 
 rust. At this Station, however, the foliage is very susceptible to currant aphis. This 
 variety probably originated in England many years ago and is possibly identical with Scotch 
 mentioned by English writers. It was imported to the United States more than seventy 
 years ago and has been grown under various names. There seems to be no doubt but that 
 London Red and Short-bunched Red are identical with this variety. In 1897 the variety 
 was added to the recommended fruit list of the American Pomological Society. 

Plants large, vigorous, upright, holding their foliage well, dense, fairly productive, 
 quite resistant to insects and disease, especially to the white pine blister-rust; young shoots 
 very numerous, slender; leaf-buds small, short, pointed, lean, lightly pubescent, usually 
 appressed; leaves medium in size and color, subcordate to cordate at the base, with ver\- 
 shallow, obtuse lobes, thin, rugose, glabrous, with crenate margins; petiole medium in length, 
 slender, pubescent, greenish. Flowers midseason, in loose, somewhat erect, short racemes; 
 calyx-tube greenish, broadly campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes obtuse, greenish, with 
 fine, reddish stripes; ring lacking or very indistinct; anther-cells closely joined; ovary 
 glabrous. Fruit late midseason, hangs a long time; clusters nearly long, medium compact, 
 the tips well filled, 12-20 berries, held out rather stiffly; cluster-stems medium in length 
 and thickness; berry-stems slender; berries above mediiim to medium in size, average round- 
 oblate but variable, glossy dark red; skin smooth, thin, tough, translucent; flesh firm, juicy, 
 sprightly; quality good. 

Marvin Crystal, i. Ohio Sta. Bui. 371:357. 1923. 

Marvin's Seedling. 2. A'^. Y. Sta. Bui. 95:427. 1895. 

This variety was received at the New York Experiment Station for testing in 1892 
 from D. S. Marvin, Watertown, New York. Later Mr. Marvin sold the variety to J. C.
