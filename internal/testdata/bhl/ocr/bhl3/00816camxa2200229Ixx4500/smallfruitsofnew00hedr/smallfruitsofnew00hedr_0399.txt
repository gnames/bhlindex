THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 293 

Prince Alberl is an old European currant grown under several names. The variety 
 is one of the latest to flower and to ripen its fruits, so that it becomes exceedingly valuable 
 in lengthening the currant season. The berries are ver>^ large, have thin skins, and a 
 most pleasing piquancy of flavor. The bushes are vigorous, but only moderately pro- 
 ductive; they are as healthy as any and have a characteristic upright habit of growth. 
 Prince Albert was introduced in America from France about 1850. Many writers have 
 confused the synonymy of this variety with that of Red Dutch, although the two varieties 
 are quite distinct. English pomologists have considered the continental Red Dutch 
 identical with Prince Albert but the two seem to be distinct. Prince Albert was added 
 to the recommended fruit list of the American Pomological Society in 1862. 

Plants large, \'igorous, upright-spreading, very dense, medium to very productive, 
 usually free from anthracnose; young shoots numerous, rather slender, tinged red; leaf -buds 
 characteristically large, long, pointed, plump, very pubescent, variable in appression; 
 leaves drop late in the fall, subcordate to truncate at the base, with short-pointed lobes, 
 thick, leathery, distinctly dark green, semi-glossy, very rugose, glabrous, with crenate 
 margins; petiole long, green, tinged dull red, holds the foliage stiffly upright. Flowers 
 late midseason, medium to large, characteristically reddish, with faint tinge of yellow, in 
 very long, dense, drooping, many-flowered racemes; calj'x-tube green, tinged brownish red, 
 campanulate, glabrous; calyx-lobes obtuse, tinged with red; petals very large and broad, 
 greenish yellow; ring absent or very indistinct; anther-cells closely connected; ovary gla- 
 brous. Fruit very late, hangs on an unusually long time; clusters long, well filled, tapering, 
 rather loose, 14-21 berries; cluster-stems very long, of medium thickness; berry-stems short; 
 berries of medium size but variable, roundish oblate or slightly obovate, light, bright red; 
 skin thin, smooth, tough, translucent; flesh firm, juicy, sprightly becoming subacid, 
 highly flavored ; quality good.

 3. Ohio Sta. Bui. 371:344, 378. 1923. 
 Some years ago Red Cross was much grown in the Hudson River Valley where it was 
 esteemed for its large bunches and large fruits. In recent years, however, it has been found 
 that it is excelled by several other of the large-fruited sorts and is now passing out of 
 cultivation. Perhaps the chief drawback to its culture is that the fruits crack very readily.
