 rarely black, but varying in color from dull red, bright yellow, yellow with red stripes, 
 and greenish amber; of good quality and excellent for pies, jellies, and preserves. 

Topsy. I. Ont. Fr. Or. Assoc. Rpt. -jg. 1902. 2. Can. Cent. Exp. Farm Bui. 56:18. 1907. 
 This variety was raised about 1890 by William Saunders, Ottawa, Canada. It is a 
 hybrid between a so-called Dempsey's Black currant and a seedling of the Houghton goose- 
 berry. From this cross five plants grew, four of which had gooseberry foliage, and one, 
 Topsy, black currant foliage and fruit. Plants vigorous, moderately productive; bunches 
 large; berries large, with thick skin, briskly subacid, with a pleasant flavor; good; midseason 

Utah Black, i. Card. & For. 3:375. 1890. 

Rather widely disseminated many years ago, as an ornamental. Supposed to be a 
 seedling of Missouri Black and an improvement over that sort. So very similar if not 
 identical to Crandall that a further description is unnecessary.
