THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 319 

At no time in the history of the country was pomology a matter of wider 
 and more common concern to people on the land and in cities than this. 
 But the pomological books, magazines, societies, exhibitions, and the efforts 
 of individuals a hundred years ago and several decades after were directed 
 toward the introduction of foreign fruits rather than the domestication of 
 native fruits and the breeding of American varieties. The progress America 
 has made in domesticating native fruits and the adaptation of varieties of 
 European fruits to American environments, remarkable achievements in 
 the history of agriculture, came after 1850. 

In the first edition of his American Fruit CuUurist, 1846, Thomas does 
 not mention the Houghton or any other American variety of the gooseberry. 
 Not imtil the fourth edition, 1850, does it find a place in his book, and Down- 
 ing in Fruits and Fruit Trees does not mention it until the edition of i860. 
 Yet, as its history, given in the discussion of the variety in Chapter XIII 
 shows, it must have been widely grown at this time. 

In common with other European fruits, European gooseberries were 
 now recognized as failures on this side of the Atlantic, and far-sighted 
 pomologists were recommending the domestication and breeding of fruits 
 and varieties adapted to American conditions. In 1847, Hovey,' a veteran 
 pomological writer, had this to say of gooseberries in his admirable Magazine 
 of Horticulture : 

" Houghton's Seedling Gooseberry. — The exhibition of some very fine 
 specimens of this variety, at a late meeting of the Horticultural Society, 
 reminds us that we have neglected to notice it before. The great diffi- 
 culty attending the growth of the large and fine sorts of English goose- 
 berries is, that, in most localities, the berries are rendered worthless by 
 the attacks of mildew; and the consequent disappointment has induced 
 many to give up their cultivation altogether. Mr. Houghton's gooseberr,- 
 is a seedling from our native kind, produced some time ago and is consider- 
 ably cultivated in Lynn, where Mr. Houghton resides. It is of only 
 moderate size, btit possesses a fine flavor, is a most extraordinary bearer 
 and in all seasons is remarkably free from mildew. The specimens which 
 we have seen, induce us to recommend it for general cultivation, especially 
 in situations where the large English sorts cannot be grown. We have no 
 doubt, that with proper attention in the selection of seeds from the largest 
 berries, other and improved sorts may be raised from this, and eventually 
 a progeny of large fruited kinds, equal to the English, but possessing all 
 the adaptation to our variable climate of the parent plant. We trust our 
 hints may be acted upon by amateurs who have the leisure to do so."
