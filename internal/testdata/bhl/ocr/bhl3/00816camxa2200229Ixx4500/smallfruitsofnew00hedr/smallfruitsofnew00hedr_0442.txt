320 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

Again, in 1850, Hovey ^ urges the improvement of the native gooseberry 

as follows : 

" The attention of our cultivators is, we are glad to know, now being 
 more directed to this fruit than heretofore, and efforts are making to pro- 
 duce seedhngsof our wild gooseberry, which is not attacked with the mildew, 
 of increased size and quality. The first advance has already been achieved 
 in that prolific variety, Houghton's Seedling, and with this for a parent, 
 we see no reason why we may not in a few years possess native kinds, equal- 
 Hng the foreign ones in size and excellence, and, at the same time, possessing 
 all the hardy and easily ctdtivated properties of the variety we have just 
 named. We have already quite a number of seedlings, and shall look for- 
 ward to their fruiting with much interest." 

These are but two of a considerable number of expressions in the 
 horticultural press of the times calling attention to the desirability of raising 
 seedling gooseberries from native species if the country were to have varieties 
 worth growing. The work of domesticating the American gooseberry 
 seems to have been taken up with considerable interest in several northern 
 states where fruit growing flourished, and a number of new seedlings were 
 shown as recorded in accoimts of the fruit exhibitions of the times. Yet 
 little came of gooseberry breeding for a reason easy to luiderstand as we 
 review the copious pomological literature of the last half of the last century. 
 Raspberries, blackberries, dewberries, strawberries, grapes, and native 
 plums gave quicker and more abundant returns to breeders of fruits than the 
 gooseberry and so claimed the attention of pomologists. Among many 
 treasures discovered in our domestic flora for development, the gooseberry 
 seemed to the workers of the times of little importance. 

Of the several seedlings immediately following Houghton, which we 
 have set as the first landmark in the domestication of the American goose- 
 berry. Downing is the only one noteworthy. It originated with Charles 
 Downing about 1855, as a seedling of Houghton and immediately became 
 popular. For seventy-five years it has been more commonly grown than 
 any other variety of this fruit in the United States, although it ought long 
 ago to have been discarded for any one of several better kinds which the 
 country now offers. The following is the first discussion and description 
 of the Downing, valuable also as showing the status of gooseberries at the 
 time the article was written, and of further interest as coming from the pen 
 of the noted European pomologist, Louis Berckmans who had some years 
 before come to America to live. Mr. Berckmans^ says:
