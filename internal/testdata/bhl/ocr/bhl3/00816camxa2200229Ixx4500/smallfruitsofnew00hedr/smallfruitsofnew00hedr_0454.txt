Of the sorts bred from an American species. Downing is now more grown in North 
 America than any other gooseberry', although it is now agreed by botanists and pomologists 
 that it is a hybrid with the European species. It is one of the easiest of all gooseberries 
 to propagate, and from the time of its introduction it has, therefore, been a favorite with 
 nurserymen. Fruit growers like it, also, because the plants are very vigorous, healthy and 
 productive, and although the fruits are small, they are smooth, thin skinned, rather attrac- 
 tive in appearance and of very good quality. To be at its best the fruit must be picked as 
 soon as full size is attained since decay sets in soon after maturity, and the product is seldom 
 found in the markets sufficiently well ripened to eat out of hand. The plants are rarely 
 attacked by mildew. Downing was originated about 1855 by Charles Downing, New- 
 burgh, New York, as a seedling of Houghton. The varietj' was added to the fruit catalog 
 of the American Pomological Society in 1862 and its name still appears in the Society's 
 catalogs.

 tive, healthy; young shoots medium in thickness, numerous, with a thin layer of dull gray
