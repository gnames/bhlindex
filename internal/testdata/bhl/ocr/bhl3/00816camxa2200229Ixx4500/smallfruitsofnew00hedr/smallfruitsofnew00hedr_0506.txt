356 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

After the currant and gooseberry, however, it has been longest ctdtivated 
 of small fruits in North America, where it has been grown in gardens per- 
 haps two centuries and in commercial plantations about a century. Indeed, 
 as we shall see later, and as the study of its botany shows, the garden straw- 
 berry may well be called a New World fruit as it is derived mainly from 
 species native of the Americas, and New World varieties, which greatly 
 outniimber those of the Old World, have originated almost wholly in North 
 America. 

The manner of domestication and evolution of the strawberry, as 
 to main events, persons concerned, dates and places, are fairly well known. 
 Its botanical derivation, however, is still obscure desp'.te the fact that species 
 of wild strawberries of pomological promise do not number a dozen and but 
 three or four of these have as yet awakened the interest of breeders. The 
 difficulty is that the few species under cultivation have been hybridized 
 to such an extent that a vast entanglement of strawberries has restilted. 
 The early nomenclature of cultivated forms is a labyrinth of confusion in 
 which no one can now find his way with surety. 

Several notable botanists and pomologists have studied Fragaria, 
 and the history and development of its cultivated offspring assiduously, 
 yet no two arrive at the same conclusions as to the exact origin of the 
 modem cultivated strawberry. All historical evidence seems to have been 
 collected and examined by competent minds, without establishing whether 
 the cultivated strawberry belongs to a single species, and what, or whether 
 it is a hybrid and of what. 

If the reader will turn to Chapter XV, The Systematic Botany of the 
 Strawberry, he will find descriptions and botanical data on all species of Fra- 
 garia, varieties of which are now cultivated or have been at one time or one 
 place or another, whence have come by a tortuous route of hybridization 
 the several thousand sorts grown in modem times. It is the purpose in 
 the next few pages to give the history of the domestication of these several 
 species and to tell as well as may be what part they have played in the 
 evolution of our modern strawberry. The five species are F. vesca, 
 F. moschata, F. viridis, F. inrginiana, and F. chiloensis. These have been 
 named in order of their introduction and in that order will be considered. 

THE EUROPEAN OR WOOD STRAWBERRY 

The common strawberry of Europe, the European or wood strawberry, 
 is Fragaria vesca. This is the species in the minds of Old World pomologists
