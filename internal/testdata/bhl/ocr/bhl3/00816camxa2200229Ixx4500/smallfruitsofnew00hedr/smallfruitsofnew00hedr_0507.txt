THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 357 

since the earliest accounts of edible plants. It is the classical strawberry 
 of Virgil, Ovid, and Pliny who mention it as a wild plant but not as an 
 inhabitant of gardens. There seems to be documentary proof that this 
 strawberry' was cultivated in France as early as the fourteenth century, 
 but it is usual to place its introduction in the fruit garden in the fifteenth 
 centur>^ Certainly Ruellius speaks of it as a garden plant in 1536 as do 
 a half dozen or more other botanists and herbalists of the century as 
 recorded by Sturtevant.' 

There is no dearth of information as to when introduced and as to what 
 the wild strawberry of Europe was at the time of its introduction into 
 European gardens. Sturtevant, who had unusual opporttmities to study 
 the history of edible plants, found many discussions and descriptions of 
 wild and cultivated strawberries in the sixteenth and the early part of the 
 seventeenth centuries. He - gives the following : 

"The strawberry is figured fairly well in the Ortus Sanitatis, 151 1, 
 c. 188, but there is no mention of culture. Ruellius, however, 1536, speaks 
 of it as growing wild in shady situations, says gardens furnish a larger fruit, 
 and mentions even a white variety. Fuchsius, 1542, also speaks of the 
 larger garden variety, and Estinne, 1545, (perhaps also in his first edition 
 of the De Re Hortensi, 1535), says strawberries are used as delicacies on 
 the table, with sugar and cream, or wine, and that they are of the size of 
 a hazelnut; he says the plants bear most palatable fruit, red, especially when 
 they are fully ripe; that some grow on the moimtains and woods, and are 
 wild, but that some cultivated ones are so odorous that nothing can be 
 more so, and that these are larger, and some are white, others red, yet others 
 are both red and white. 

" Cultivated strawberries are also noted by many authors of the sixteenth 
 century, as by Mizaldus, 1560; Pena and Lobel in 1571; and in 1586 Lyte's 
 Dodoens records, 'they be also much planted in gardens.' Porta, 1592, 
 regards them as among the delicacies of the garden and the delights of the 
 palate. Hyll, 1593, says ' they be much eaten at all men's tables,' and 
 that ' they will grow in gardens unto the bigness of a mulberry.' Le 
 Jardinier Soli aire, 16 12, gives directions for planting, and Parkinson, 1629, 
 notes a number of varieties. As to size, Dorstenius, 1540, speaks of them 
 as of the size of a hazelnut; Bauhin, 1596, as being double the size of the 
 wild; the Hortus Eystettensis , 1613, figures berries one and three-eighths 
 inches in diameter; Parkinson, in 1629, as ' neere five inches about;' 
 Plat, 1653, as two inches about in bigness: Vaillant, 1727, as an inch and 
 sometimes more in diameter."
