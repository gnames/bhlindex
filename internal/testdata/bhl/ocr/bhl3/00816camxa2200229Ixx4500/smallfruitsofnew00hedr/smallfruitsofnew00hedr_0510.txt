360 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

The botanists and herbalists of the sixteenth centiiry mention this 
 strawberry as a cultivated plant, and from time to time garden varieties 
 were introduced, such as the Apricot, Framboise, and Royal in France, 
 and the Black, Globe, and Prolific in England. In Germany, near Ham- 
 burg, a variety or varieties of F. moschata are still grown and much liked for 
 their rich flavor and musky odor, but are seldom profitable because of the 
 small size of the berries and unproductiveness of the plants. 

FRAG ARIA VIRIDIS 

This exceedingly variable species is now and probably has been culti- 
 vated for several centuries in Europe as a curiosity and somewhat for its 
 fruits, especially when hybridized with one of the two preceding species. It 
 is a very dwarf, densely hairy plant bearing small fruits none too delectable 
 in the pure species. It has been hybridized with F. vesca and F. moschata 
 to produce sorts grown in France and Germany. None of its offspring are 
 of garden importance now and it may be eliminated as a factor in the 
 improvement of the cviltivated strawberry of the future. It is much more 
 interesting in its botany, which the reader should look up on page 377, than 
 in its pomology. 

In studying the descriptions and illustrations of plant and fruit of 
 these three European strawberries one quickly comes to the conclusion 
 that none of them responds well to cultivation or to such selection as has 
 been practiced to secure better varieties. Cultivated sorts have differed 
 little from their wild prototypes. The strawberry, it would seem, could 
 never have reached great prominence as a cultivated fruit had all depend- 
 ence been placed on European species 

THE AMERICAN WILD, SCARLET, OR VIRGINIAN STRAWBERRY 

The commonest strawberry in North America, certainly in the eastern 
 part of the continent, is Fragaria virginiana and its botanical varieties 
 which pass under the common names wild strawberry, scarlet, and 
 Virginian strawberry. This is the common strawberry which was men- 
 tioned by the early European explorers and pioneers on our Atlantic 
 seaboard and is the wild strawberry of the fields and woods which has 
 given a delectable fruit to the inhabitants of eastern North America, 
 whether Indians or whites, during all time. 

In the seventeenth century this strawberry was taken to Europe, 
 the exact date, as recorded by Jean Rodin, gardener to Louis XIII, being
