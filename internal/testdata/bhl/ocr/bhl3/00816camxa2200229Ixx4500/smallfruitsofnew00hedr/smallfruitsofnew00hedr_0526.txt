Eastern North America, northern Asia, and Europe; north as far as 
 Lapland and Iceland. It is commonly found, probably subspontaneous, 
 in South America, Ecuador, in Peru, and in eastern Brazil. 

There are several varieties and forms, some of which have been 
 described as minor species by Jordan and Fourreau, which do not deserve to 
 be mentioned. The most common European form has been distinguished 
 as F. vesca var. silvestris Linn, or var. typica, Ascherson & Graebener I.e. 
 A small form of this occurring on dry hills is F. minor, Duchesne in Lam. 
 Encycl. 2:531. 1786. 

A form with erose petals is var. crenata, Schur En. PL Transs. 186. 
 1866. Two monstrous forms were named by Duchesne in Lam. Encycl. 
 2:532, 533. 1786, F. multiplex with small pale fruits and F. botryformis 
 with ntunerous small flowers rising from one flower. 

A form with pale pink petals has been described as var. roseiflora, 
 Bculey Bui. Soc. Bot. Fr. 18:92. 1871; a form with bright rose-colored 
 petals is var. rosea, Rostrup in Lange Haandb. Danske Fl. 4th Ed. 810. 1888. 

A form with white or pale fruits is known as var. alba Ehrhart, Ryd- 
 berg Mem. Dept. Bot. Columbia Univ. 2:174. 1898; F. vulgaris alba, 
 Ehrhart Beitr. 7:22. 1792; F. vesca albicarpa, Britton Bui. Torrey Bot. 
 Club 6:323. 1879. It occurs with the type and is not rare in North 
 America. 

The rare form with elongated red, or dark red, or whitish fniits is 
 often cultivated and was named F. vesca hortensis, Ser. in De Candolle 
 Prodr. 2:569. 1825; F. hortensis, Duchesne Hist. Nat. Frais. 113. 1766.

 F. abnormis. Tra.tt. Ros. Monogr. y. 166. 1824. 

A monstrous form with one cordate-ovate or sometimes indistinctly 
 3-lobed leaflet; it was first raised by Duchesne in 1761 as a chance seed- 
 ling from F. vesca. 

It comes true from seed and is easily propagated from runners. Its 
 leaves are those of the juvenile state.
