THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 383 

SmaUer plant, bracts less hairy; petioles 5-15 cm long, sparingly loosely hairy; leaflets 
 broadly obovate, the lateral ones very oblique, glaucous, sparingly hairy on both sides, 
 glabrate at length, 3-5 cm long. Scape usually shorter than the leaves, many flowered, 
 almost glabrous; pedicels with adpressed hairs. 

A western form, from British Columbia to South Dakota and New 
 Mexico. 

F. pauciflora, Rydberg Mem. Dept. Bot. Columbia Univ. I.e., is a 
 similar, few-flowered form. 

F. virgmiana is always easily known by the glaucous, felted leaflets, 
 with large coarse, curved teeth, the subumbelliform inflorescence and the 
 crimson-colored or scarlet fruits. It was introduced long ago into European 
 gardens. According to Duchesne, it was common in cultivation in England, 
 Holland, and France, toward the end of the seventeenth century. It is 
 well figured by Batty Langley, Pomona 120, PI. 55, figs, i & 4. 1727, and 
 by Duhamel, Traite des A rbres Fruit iers i : 241 , PI. V. 1 768. It was known 
 in France as the Fraisier ecarlate. Petit ecariate, and Fraisier de Holland. 
 F. virginiana is occasionally found subspontaneous in Germany. Hybrids 
 with F. vesca and F. moschaf-a have been repeatedly observed in European 
 gardens and the hybrids with F. chiloensis have been discussed under that 
 species.
