This variety has rapidly attained high favor in the states along the Atlantic seaboard. 
 Its most distinctive characters are vigor and healthiness of plant, and beauty and high 
 quality of fruit. The surface of the berries is seldom broken by furrows or irregularities, 
 and the fruits are unusually plump and glossy. The dark red flesh is aromatic and mildly 
 acid. The plants do not multiply as rapidly as those of most varieties and should be set 
 somewhat thickly. The variety is desirable also because there is little danger of frost 
 since the plants bloom late, a valuable consideration in many localities. This variety 
 was originated by J. W. Parks, Nanticoke, Maryland, about 1904; introduced two years 
 later by W. F. Allen, Salisbury, Maryland. In 1909 the American Pomological Society 
 added the variety to its list of recommended fruits.
