First Season. 4. Am. Card. 10:342. 1889. 

The outstanding qualities of Gandy are handsome, deep red, firm fruits of very good 
 quality, although the variety finds favor in many localities because of its late season, the 
 fruits reaching the market the last of their kind. The plants are partial as to soils and 
 thrive best in heavy rather than light soils. The fruits hold their color when canned very 
 well, but are a little too acid for a prime canned product. The variety is grown more or less 
 wherever strawberries are cultivated in the United States. Gandy was originated in 1885 
 by W. S. Gandy, Newport, New Jersey, as a cross between Jersey Queen and Glendale; 
 introduced in 1888; added to the fruit list of the American Pomological Society in 1889.

 well in size; fruit-stems variable in length, thick, semi-erect to erect; pedicels short, slender; 
 calyx large, raised, leafy, easily detached, well colored; sepals long, broad; berries large, 
 round-conic; apex very obtuse; color light red at first, deepening to dark, rather dull red
