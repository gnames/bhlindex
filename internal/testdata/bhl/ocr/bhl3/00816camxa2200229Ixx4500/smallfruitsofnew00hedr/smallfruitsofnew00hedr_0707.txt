This variety originated in 1898 with Samuel Cooper, Delevan, New York, as a sport 
 of Bismarck. The variety is now of interest chiefly as the parent of the new race of double- 
 bearing strawberries, nearlj^ all of which are direct offspring of this one and all indirectly so. 
 The variety fails in comparison with later sorts of its kind in being unproductive and diffi- 
 cult to propagate. Perfect. Plants very few, medium to vigorous, healthy, variable in 
 yield; autumn-bearing; runners none or very few, the young plants usually blossoming 
 as soon as rooted or sometimes before striking root; fruit-stems short, stout, erect; calyx 
 small, deeply set; berries closely clustered and hidden by the foliage, medium in size, round- 
 conic, dull red; flesh pale red, firm, aromatic, subacid; good; early.
