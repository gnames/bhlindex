VIII PREFACE. 

to present formidable obstacles against the success of a foreigner in 
 every literary attempt. I have therefore submitted my manuscript to 
 the revision of a gentleman who has taken a warm interest in assisting 
 the prosecution of my inquiries. He has, however, in every instance, 
 advised me to retain my own expressions unaltered, as conveying with 
 the greatest fidelity and precision the ideas of my own mind, unless 
 where, from the very different genius of the German language, they 
 would have presented a meaning obscure, or liable to be mistaken by 
 the English reader. These observations will at once account for, and 
 it is trusted also plead for an indulgent allowance in behalf of, that 
 occasional harshness of construction and style, which it is felt must 
 still adhere to a work composed under such circumstances. 

I have finally to acknowledge my obligations to the Very Rev. the 
 Dean of Bristol ; Richard Bright, Esq. of Ham-Green ; the 
 Rev. W. D. CoNYBEARE, of Brislingtou ; the Rev. Professor W. 
 BucKLAND, of Oxford ; the Rev. Professor A. Sedge wick, of Cam- 
 bridge ; the Rev. R. Halifax, of Standish ; the Rev. Dr. Cook, of 
 Tortworth ; C. Stokes, Esq. of London ; John Hawker, Esq. of 
 Dudbridge ; and to'all the Gentlemen in Bristol and its neighbourhood 
 possessing collections of organic remains, the richest perhaps in this 
 department which England contains, for their liberality in furnishino- 
 me with specimens, and in giving every aid to my inquiries which a 
 free access to their cabinets and the assistance of their valuable 
 information could aftbrd.
