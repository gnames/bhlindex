INTRODUCTION. 

XHE late inquiries made by M. Cuvier, Lamarck, and other Naturalists 
 in comparative auatoiny, have extended the application of the results ob- 
 tained; to the animal remains found in the various strata of our globe. Nu- 
 merous genera and species of organic beings, of whose existence we had 
 no previous idea, have been thus satisfactorily ascertained, whilst others 
 still require persevering and patient examination ; and it has been proved, 
 that by a thorough knowledge of them, greater certainty may be given to the 
 facts resulting from geological observations. 

As the environs of Bristol abound in strata replete with organic remains, I 
 was induced by these considerations to devote to them a large share of my 
 attention. The columns of the Encrinite so abundant in the black rock, (a fetid 
 mountain limestone) on the side of the river Avon, attracted my notice 
 particularly, and the sparry subrotund concretions dispersed throughout 
 the rock, made me hope that I might find in these the superior extremi- 
 ties of that animal which had been generally sought for in vain. This sus- 
 picion was soon after verified by the discovery of the fine specimen of AcTi- 
 NOCRiNiTES 30 Dactylus figured Pl. ii. fig. 1. and 2. A perusal of Mr. 
 Pakkinson's work on the Organic Remains of a former World, showed 
 how much had been done, and what remained to be done, for the illustration 
 of the history of the Encrinites, and M. Cuvier's method in the identification 
 of animals by their skeletons, pointed out the mode to be pursued. I began 
 therefore to collect as many masses and fragments of these animals as I ' 
 could get. I extended my field of research gradually further around the 
 environs of Bristol, to the Transition and Mountain Limestone, the Lyas, 
 Oolite, Greensand, and Chalk: and began to arrange the specimens obtained 
 according to the strata and places where found. A few of these more perfect 
 and illustrative than the rest, enabled me io form an idea of the relative
