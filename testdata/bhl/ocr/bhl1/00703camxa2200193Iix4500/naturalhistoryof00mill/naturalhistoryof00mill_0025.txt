CRINOIDEA. 

lily-shaped animals. 

Character of the Family. 

An animal with around, oval, or angular column, composed of numerous 
 articulating joints, supporting at its summit a series of plates or joints forming 
 a cup-like body containing the viscera, from whose upper rim proceed five 
 articulated arms, dividing into tentaculated fingers, more or less numerous, 
 surrounding the aperture of the mouth, situated in the centre of a plated 
 integument, which extends over the abdominal cavity, and is capable of 
 being contracted into a conic or proboscal shape. 

Some species of these animals ascertained to be permanently attached to 
 extraneous bodies, whilst others appear to have been capable of locomotion. 

Derivation of the Name of the Famili/. 

I have derived the name of this family from the Greek ta znA kpinoeiaea 
 the lily-shaped animals, and have used this word to form with another distin- 
 guishing term prefixed, the name of the genera. 

Progress of the Study of the Animals now arranged in this Family. 

The cclumns and columnar joints of the Crinoidea.by their frequent occur- 
 rence and remarkable figure, have attracted the attention of naturalists at an early 
 age. The round columns, and their depressed single perforated joints, marked 
 upon their upper and lower surfaces with radiating striae, have acquired names
