founded on superstitious ideas, their resemblance to other bodies, and the use 
 they were applied to ; as rosary beads, (EOSltn^^an^Steint, Germ.) giant's tears, 
 (^Unnentl)?acnen, Germ.) fairy stones, wheel stones, (IRaeDerStfine, Germ.) tor- 
 chites, entrochites, &c. The angular columns being generally star-shaped re- 
 ceived the names starstones, asteriae, &c. 

Agricola considered these bodies as inorganic infiltrations, similar to sta- 
 lactites. Other early authors regarded them as vertebral joints of fish, as 
 corals, &c. ; and some who had more accurately observed the column and its 
 termination, compared them to plants, whence the name of the stone lily (^tPtll 
 Ullit, Germ.) was given to the superior extremities of our genus Encrinus. 
 LlhuidI believe first considered them as appendages to star fish; and when this 
 idea was accepted by men of enquiry, and it was admitted, that they probably 
 belonged to the asteria, (now the Stellekides Eurvale of M. Lamarck,) and 
 might even exist in unexplored seas, researches were set on foot to discover 
 them in a living or recent state. A recent species of these animals was sup- 
 posed to have been detected, when the Pennatula encrinus of the immortal 
 LiNN^us, of which Ellis gives a description as an hydra, was first noticed. 
 But this, on closer examination, proved to differ so materially from the Encri- 
 NiTE, that it furnished Lamarck with the type of his new genus UmbeIlula- 
 KiA. Soon afterwards, however, a portion of an animal was found which bore 
 a great resemblance to the asterial columns occurring so frequently in lias and 
 oolite, possessing, indeed, an absolute identity of generic characters. LinnjEus 
 improperly classed this species under the genus Isis, as Isis asteria, which 
 error M. Lamarck corrected, and placed it in his genus Encrinus, as Encri- 
 nus CAPUT MEDUSvE, and which I have removed to the genus Pentacrinites 
 (Pentacrinus) retaining M. Lamarck's specific name.

Some species, as Cyathocrinites rugosus, &c. are found amongst the 
 fparliest traces of organic remains, imbedded in the transition limestone for- 
 mation. Other species of the genera Actinocrinites, Platvcrinitek, 
 Rhodocrinites, Poteriocrinites, and Cyathocrinites, occur in the moun- 
 tain and magnesian limestone deposits, where they are lost, (as far as I 
 have been able to ascertain,) and make room for the different species of 
 Pentacrinites, which may be traced through the beds of the lias, oolite, 
 and chalk, and of which one species, the Pentacrinus caput medvsje
