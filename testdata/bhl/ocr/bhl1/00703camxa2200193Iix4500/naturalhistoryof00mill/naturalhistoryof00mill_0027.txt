kas continued from the formation of the lyaa to our times, and is now met with, 
 though very rarely, in a recentstate. The Apiocrinites rotundus is only found 
 adhering to a bed of the oolite formation, and the Apiocrinitesi ellipticus in 
 chalk. 

It also appears that many species of Crinoidea have been very generally 
 distributed over our earth, whilst others (at least as far as our knowledge ex- 
 tends) were more local. 

Observations. 

The essentially distinguishing character of the family of Crinoidea, is the 
 column formed of numerous joints which separates them from the Polypi, 
 whilst the arms and fingers surrounding the mouth, prove their affinity to them 
 and the Stellerid.e. 

The integuments of the Crinoidea appear to have had the power of forming 
 by secreting a number of calcarious concretions, forming joints or ossicula, 
 composing what may be termed the skeleton of the animal. These can- 
 not, indeed, with strict propriety, be termed boncH, since that denomina- 
 tion is almost limited by usage to the parts constituting the skeleton of ver- 
 tebral animals, whereas the ossicular concretions of the Crinoidea in many 
 points (and probably also in their chymical composition) bear a nearer analogy 
 to the plates of the Echinus and the joints of the Star-fish. Yet entirely dif- 
 ferent both in disposition and arrangement, as are these ossicula from the 
 bones of vertebral animals, they manifestly are intended to subserve the same 
 general uses, to form the solid support of the whole body, to protect the 
 viscera, and as we shall presently see reason to believe, to form the basis 
 of attachment to a regular muscular system. Having thus guarded my use of 
 the term ossicula against the misapprehension or objections that might other- 
 wise possibly arise, I shall, without scruple, employ that appellation to desig- 
 nate these bodies. By the depressions and foramina in the ossicnla, it may be 
 proved that the gelatinous integument investing' them possessed muscular 
 powers, and was able to produce effects resulting from muscular action. The 
 movement of the arms, theiingers, and tentacula, could only have been effected 
 in this manner. 

A Periosteum seems to have secreted and arranged the calcarious matter 
 of the ossicula, and I think in some instances had the power of reabsorbing it/
