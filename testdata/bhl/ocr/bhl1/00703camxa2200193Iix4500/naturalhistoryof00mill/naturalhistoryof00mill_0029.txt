however, appears to me, I confess, doubtful ; and I am rather inclined to 
 believe that near the place where the young Polypi appear to push forth, the 
 aperture of the ovary exists, from which the minute ovum having escaped, and 
 by means of its gluten adhering to the parent, thus forms a sort of placenta 
 from which the extruded animal draws for a period its vital sustenance. I sus- 
 pect that I have detected the aperture or apertures of the ovaries in Apio- 
 CBiMTEs ROTUNDUS, between the angles near the adhesion of the joints of the 
 pelvis and coslae, as also in tlie division of inarticulata between the scapula. 

Whether the Crinoidea did or did not possess a vent, still remains doubtful. 
 Their organization appears to have been such as might, perhaps, have enabled 
 them to dispense with this part; since the sphincter muscle at the bottom of 
 the stomach (the apex of the column) permitted, probably, only those juices to 
 pass into the alimentary canal which were destined to be assimilated into the 
 system, and matter, not so applicable, may easily have been disgorged by the 
 mouth. Even the juices carried into the alimentary canal, too abundant for 
 the general recrements needed by the animal frame, may have been exuded 
 through vessels between the joints, and have been employed in repairing occa- 
 sional injuries, or forming additional lamina to strengthen the fiiljric. 

The liability to frequent accidents to which animals formed of such numer- 
 ous parts as the Crinoidea must be exposed, renders their having a power of 
 repairing injuries sustained, and of reproducing portions lost, necessary ; and 
 that they have this is verified, beyond doubt, by the specimen of Pentacrinus 
 CAPUT MEDUS;E, recently in the possession of the late John Tobin, Esq. 

The mode in which the numerous ossicular concretions of these animals are 
 connected together by a gelatinous muscular substance only, rendtrs their 
 separation alter death easily accounted for, and explains the rare occurrence 
 of I eriect specimens in a fossil state. The formation of all the ossicula by cal- 
 carious secretions, furnishes the reason why they have been so perfectly pre- 
 served in the mineral strata, although changed into foliated spar similar to that 
 which generally occurs iu the remains of Echini and Asteria. 

Where the muscle is preserved, or a portion of the animal oil, however 
 â€¢minute, intervenes between the fossil and tiie imbedding substance, or betweeu 
 two joints, they easily separate, and if exposed to the gradual actiou of an 
 acid, uot uufr'ttquently muscular fibre itself may be developed.
