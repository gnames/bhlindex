Description. 

1 have derived the specific name rotundus, from the animal having a round 
 column. 

The remains of the Apiocrinites rotundus have as yet only occurred in a 
 fossil state, and no perfect specimen has been met with. At Bradford the al- 
 most shajjeless bases (Pl. ii. fig. hand 9.) of this species are met with, adhering 
 to the surface of the oolitic rock, of various sizes, inclosing portions of the column, 
 which are seen externally shooting forth from them. They are affixed in great 
 number to each other, and not unfrequently to testacea and other extraneous 
 marine bodies, which proves that the animal lived in the sea, and affixed itself 
 wherever chance directed its ovum. Portions of the column (Pl. iv. fig. 1.) the 
 nnimars superior pear-shaped part (Pl, i. fig. 2.) and the separate joints of 
 both are generally found in the clay which covers the oolite. As cellepores 
 shells and serpuhc (Pl. ii. fig, 9) adhere to them, they must have been of a 
 firm texture, and as these frequently occupy the inner surfaces of joints (Pl. ii. 
 fig. 1) the remains of these animals must have lain for some time in a dead and 
 separated state, before they were covered with the mass of the stratum in which 
 they are imbedded. The comparatively rare occurrence of portions of the 
 column, its short fragments, on which I never could trace the slightest mark 
 indicating side arms, and the bulky superior part, point out that the column at 
 no time could have been very long (Pl. i. fig. 1.) since otherwise the animal 
 would have been continually in danger of mutilation from the over poising 
 weight of its superior part; and the more so as from its want of side arms it 
 could have possessed no lateral support to counteract this weight. 

The Column, as has been observed, is formed of numerous round depressed 
 joints (Pl. iv. fig. 1 and 6) pierced in the centre to afford a passage to the 
 alimentary canal (Pl. iv. fig. 20. â€” Pl. hi. fig. 4.) Their upper and lower sur- 
 faces are striated in radii, of which the depressed spaces admit the elevated ones 
 of the next joint. The radii are at certain distances interrupted by concentric 
 of(more or less) elevated rings, parallel to the circumference ofthecolumn, which 
 are more conspicuous towards its apex. (Pl. iv. fig. 8, 9, and 14.) At each of 
 these interruptions the radii divide (forming sometimes minute tubercles) thus 
 increasing their number as the animal grows. This increase of the number of
