ten rings. I apprehend that a portion of animal matter remains always be- 
 tween the newly-formed ringand the former, perhaps interlacing with the radiat- 
 ing muscle where it divides. A proof of this appears to he, that when decora- 
 position affects specimens, and converts them into a sort of ochre, the rings 
 will separate, which could not happen, did not animal matterremain interposed 
 from their original formation. 

The enlarged columnar joints (Pl.it. fig. 8 to 12) are considerably thicker 
 than the others, are concave below, and at their superior surface more or less 
 convex, with a depression in the centre. They become gradually thinner to- 
 wards the middle, and show more numerous and more delicate radiating striae, 
 their points of division and the elevated rings are very distinct; at the latter, 
 sometimes a series of minute tubercles occur, where probably the covering 
 periosteum adhered more firmly. In consequence of the concavity of the inferior 
 surface having a greater curvature than the convexity of the superior surface, 
 each joint is thinnest towards the centre, and hence a hollow lenticular space 
 of a concavo-convex figure is formed between the two contiguous joints, which 
 may be considered as an enlargement of the alimentary canal. The joints 
 adhere by the last-formed rings, which probably afford a firmer connexion 
 from their being less calcareous, and are kept together more firmly by the thin 
 exterior muscle interlacing with the radiating ones. Their circumference is 
 somewhat less below, and contracts a little at the superior and lower surfaces. 
 Near the point of junction of the enlarged and unenlarged portion of the 
 column, an alternation of thicker with thinner joints, may very generally be 
 observed (T. i. fig. 2). This is common to all the Crinoidea, and has been ex- 
 plained as a provision of nature, to allow a greater power of motion to the 
 portion of the column where it approaches to the parts destined to procure the 
 animal's food. But I am convinced that this was also the place where new 
 joints are continually formed, at least as long as the energy ot life permitted, 
 thus increasing the length of the column, as will be proved when describing 

PeNTACKINUS caput MEUUSjE. 

The column at its lower extremity is more or less surrounded by calcaÂ« 
 reous matter of laminar construction, thereby adhering to extraneous sub- 
 stances ; this has been called by Mr. Parkinson the pedicle or base. (Pl. ii. 
 fig. 1. to 10). I have been fortunate enough to acquire a series of specimens
