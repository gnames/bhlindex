of tVis part from its earliest and youngest form, when it possessed a width and 
 «levatioii not exceeding one-fonrl h of a line, to its mature growth, and the size of 
 «ome inches. The very minute bases above mentioned,* adhere to a superior 
 columnarjoifit(T. ii.fig. l.)and possess in the centre a very minute column sur- 
 rounded by lamina; which form a small regular cone. These, in combination 
 with numerous other specimens in different stages of growth, and with their lon- 
 gitudinal sections, prove that the exuded calcareous matter forming the pedicle 
 or base, became completely indurated soon after its deposition, since the 
 lowest columnar joints to be traced at the bottom of the base are very minute, 
 (Pl. II. fig. 3. and 4.) not exceeding the proportions of the youngest specimens, 
 (and must tlierefore have been prevented from increasing and expanding in their 
 growth by the unyielding nature of materials surrounding them) whilst the 
 succeeding joints become in series at certain intervals of four, five, or even 
 jnore, successively larger and larger. It may also be seen that the inferior 
 portions of the alimentary canal enveloped in the base, become gradually filled 
 up and obliterated, being no longer required in this part of the animal (T. H. 
 fig. 4 . and 10.) where all increase had long ceased. 

The secretions of the indurating calcareous matter took place in consider- 
 able quantity when the animal grew up, and appears to have flowed abundantly 
 from vessels between the radiating surface of two joints. This is beautifully dis- 
 played in sections of large bases (T. ii. fig. 10.) where the differently coloured 
 laminae demonstrate the gradual formation of this part, their lines and the man- 
 ner in which they spread over and encompass extraneous matter which happened 
 to be in their way, proving the original fluidity, or rather viscidity of the mass. 

These lines prove also decidedly that the irregular conical mass of the base 
 is made up of distinct laminae, concentric and parallel to the outer surface of the 
 cone, placed one within the other, and resulting from successive or periodical 
 increase by deposition. In longitudinal sections, as we have already stated, 
 these lines are decidedly seen, bill lines of separation are also seen traversing 

* These Tcry mrnulc bases are interesting, as affording a proof tiiat the propagation of thes* 
 animals must Lave been oviparous; since from their size tliej must have belonged lo the very 
 'earliest and almost embryoticstate of the animal ; and yet arc found aflixed not to the parent's body, 
 .but to adead plate ; whereas the offspring produced by gemmiferous geueratioo, ocTCr becomes tie- 
 itached from the parent's body till it has obtaiaed a cousid£rable size.
