CIRCUMFERENCE, the INNER TRUNCATED EDGE, the UNDER SURFACE by Tvhich 

they rest on the row beneath them, the upper surface which they present 
 towards the row above them, and the two lateral surfaces which they pre- 
 sent to the contiguous joints of the same row. These teims will be henceforth 
 used, without further definition, in describing each of these joints. 

In each successive row, the inner surface recedes further and further from 
 the centre of the body, and opens more and more widely the internal cavity 
 which contained the mouth and viscera. 

Each joint has near its inner edge various tubercular (sometimes trefoil 
 shaped) processes, with perforations destined apparently for the insertion and 
 conveyance of muscles and vessels, behind which there is either a remarkable 
 subtriangular ridge across the upper or lower surface, or a tubercle with an 
 elongated muscle. The outer surface is always plain ; the upper, under, and 
 lateral sides are always marked with radiating striae, interrupted by transverse 
 concentric ridges, in a manner exactly similar to those which have been already 
 described in speaking of the columnar joint, and forming a continuation of the 
 same system. 

The joints of the first row, will, from the analogy of their places and offices, 
 be termed the Pelvis; those of the second, the First Costal; those of the 
 third, the Second Costal; and those of the fourth, the ScapuljC. 

Above the scapulae a further subdivision of the circumference into ten dis- 
 tinct pieces takes place. The two first rows of this subdivided series may be 
 considered as Arm Joints ; the succeeding rows as Finger Joints, which send 
 off smaller jointed tentacula, one from every finger joint. 

A correct representation of all these pieces, sufficiently detached to show 
 their general form, but still arranged in their relative position, will be found in 
 the plate illustrating the character of the genus ; each piece will be seen se- 
 parately figured in Plates v. and vi. and external and intei'nal views of the 
 united body as composed of them, in Plates i. and iii. 

The Pelvis (Pl. v. fig. 1. to 6. and 19.) is formed by five wedge-shaped or 
 truncated pyramidal plates, each resting by its inferior surface, which is con- 
 cave, upon one of the five concave spaces of the superior enlarged columnar
