The other Finger Joints (Pl. vi. fig. 19. to 27.) assume more of a horse- 
 shoe shape, are traversed by a canal, and with regard to their superior surfaces 
 are of two distinct formations. Those of the first formation (Pl. vi. fig. 18. 
 and 21.) liave on the inferior and superior surfaces, a ridge placed in an oblique 
 direction, so that that on tlie inferior, crosses that on the superior surface. 
 The finger joints of the second formation (Pl. vi. fig. 19. to 24.) have on 
 one side the oblique transverse ridge, (fig. 21.) and on the other, two slender 
 ridges crossing each other at right angles, and sending off throughout the 
 exterior space to the circumference, from one to five less conspicuous radii (fig. 
 l9. to 23.) The joints of the first and second formation are so arranged over eacii 
 other w hen forming the finger, (Pl. vi. fig. 25.) that the radiated surfaces of two 
 joints of the second formation always adhere together, supporting one of the first, 
 on which again two of the second formation rest. 

Although I have not a specimen showing the tentaculated fingers in an 
 entire state, yet from the general simple construction of the Apiockimi es 
 KOTUNUCs, and the non-occurrence of the cuneiform dividing joints in the 
 strata which afford these specimens, I conclude that the tentaculated fingers 
 were simple, and the animal had no more than two. 

From the above observations we may be able to obtain a tolerably accurate 
 idea of the general form, appearance, and organization of this animal in its 
 original and perfect state, and form a restoration of tiie whole in the same 
 manner that the antiquary proceeds to restore a ruined temple. 

We shall then (Pl. i. fig. 1.) consider it as attached by its conical base to 
 some marine body at tiie bottom of a former ocean, whence arose its short and 
 slightly flexible column, terminated at the upper part by the swelling pyriform 
 body which contained its viscera and mouth surrounded by ten finuers, each 
 fringed by numerous tentacula, either expanded like an opening flower when 
 the animal was in search of its prey, or contracted and closed when in a state 
 of repose. 

If we next examine the interior funnel-shaped cavity (Pl. hi. fig. 1.) we 
 may trace two rows of orifices opening laterally, each row exhibiting five. 
 The inferior orifices open between the first and second costal joint (Pl. it. 
 fig. 14. and 15); the superior orifices open between the junction of the sea- 
 pula and the two incumbent arm joints (Pl. v. fig. 4.) Below the subpeu-
