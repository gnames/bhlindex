gen, 1780, who represents (Pl. vi. and vii.) an Apiocrinites from the Canton 
 of Solothuni. This figure corresponds with Hofer, and suggests to me, that 
 the specimens from Swisserland are, if not a distinct species, at least a variety 
 of Apiocrinites rotundiis The thickness of the first costae, and less pear- 
 shaped form, appear to be characteristic. Should it prove a new species, I 
 propose for its name Apiocrinites elongatus. In the tabular arrangement of 
 the Crinoidea it will follow A. rotundas, rendering a further subdivision 
 necessary.
