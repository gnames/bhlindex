Description, 

The elliptical shape of the columnar joints has induced me to assign to this 
 animal its specific name. It is found only fossil, and always in a mutilated 
 state in beds of the chalk formation. It is a small neat species, whose column 
 was, I apprehend, in proportion longer than that of the former species. An idea 
 of its probable appearance when perfect, I have endeavoured to convey, fig. 6. 
 in the annexed plate, which representation is, however, less than the natural 
 size, having also omitted the terminations of the auxiliary side arms, of whose 
 formation I have not the slightest idea, and the tentaculated fingers as yet not 
 detected. 

The Column of thisCrinoidal animal offers a new field for inquiry, since its 
 joints appear to have consisted in a much greater degree of cartilaginous mat- 
 ter and mu.scular integuments, especially in younger specimens. Perhaps their 
 superior and lower surfaces alone, may, during ihe early stages of their 
 growth, have presented a solid calcareous mass. 

The articulating surfaces at both extremities of each joint present ellip- 
 tical areas (14. to 18) bounded by slightly raised rims surrounding an inner 
 oval, which again swells and becomes convex. In the direction of the 
 longitudinal axis are placed two narrow ridges, one on either side, in the 
 centre of which is a small round perforation, containing the alimentary canal. 
 (18). It shoidd be remarked that the direction of the longitudinal furrows, 
 3nd indeed of the whole oval areas of tlie articidating surfaces, does not ge-
