nerally coincide at the opposite extremities of the same joint, the longitudinal 
 axis of the one being placed obliquely when compared with that of the other, 
 as if the joint had been twisted round in opposite directions at its two extremi- 
 ties. (This is represented in fig. 18. by dotted lines.) I have never found a 
 single instance in which this obliquity was not observable, although there are 
 reasons for believing that when the animal was fully extended, the direction of 
 the opposite surfaces must have become coincident, as in the Platycrinites. 
 This obliquity of the two elliptical surfaces, appears to have resulted from a 
 vermicular contraction extended from one joint to the other, through the 
 muscle surrounding the alimentary canal, which being inserted in the trans- 
 verse grooves, and acting on them like a screw driver, twisted them partially 
 round; hence, from the compression thus produced, we .see the circumference 
 of the joints sometimes barrelshaped (16.) or more or less round towards the 
 centre, while near the articulating surface it remains elliptical. The barrel- 
 shaped joints are thicker in proportion, and appear to have lost their soft carti- 
 laginous texture, having probably belonged to full grown animals ; this, indeed, 
 seems to be confirmed by some of the specimens exhibiting a formation in con- 
 centric rings, like that observable in Apiocrinites rotundus, and an exterior par- 
 tial separation. (16.) The alimentary canal is generally small, but appears to 
 have enlarged considerably in some parts of the column (22.) and in this case 
 elongated the joints containing it, and at the same time strengthened their adhe- 
 sion with the neighbouring joints by secreting and accumulatiijg calcareous mat- 
 ter around it, (^0. to 22.) In some specimens (20. to 22.) of this description, the 
 line of junction between two joints, instead of being as usual straight, be- 
 comes inflected and waved, apparently in consequence of having been acted 
 upon by a muscular contraction, and in one instance, the exuded calcareous 
 matter has completely obliterated the external mark of articulation between 
 two joints (19.) which have anchylosed therefore to each other. Lateral. 
 AUXILIARY ARMS (13.) appear to have proceeded occasionally from the column 
 at irregular intervals, the joints composing them are round, and probably 
 articulated by radiating surfaces, as is the case in Platyokinites. 

The Enlarged Columnar Joints at the summit of the column, I appre- 
 hend to have articulated similarly to those of ordinary size, and in a section (5) 
 in my possession I have traced the alimentary canal passing through their 
 centre, enlarging in the second joint.
