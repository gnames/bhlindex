part of this animal, so far as the state of the specimens of this species have 
 allowed nie to trace them, it perfectly resembles Apiocrinites rotundus. As iu 
 that species, the superior columnar joint is on its upper surface divided by 
 five ridges, admitting in the concave spaces the five joints of the pelvis, each of 
 these terminate above in an elevated ridge, and in the iuterstices between 
 them the insertion of the five first costal joints takes place. The funnel- 
 shaped cavity in tlie centre, resembles that of tlie former species. The exterior 
 muscular integument sometimes appears to have hidden the insertion of the 
 joints, (4.) and its contraction will account for the folds which occasionally occur 
 on the surface. I have as yet seen no specimen continued beyond the first 
 costal joint, but apprehend that the following ones, the scapulae, &c. will also 
 ilje found to resemble those of Apiocrinites rotundus. 

The Straight Bottle Encrinite described by Mr. Parkinson, is, pro- 
 Ibably, only a young individual of our species, or perhaps, a much contracted 
 «|)«cimeD, having apparently hardly suflGicient character to be considered as a 

variety. 

The Stag-horn Encrinite of the same author, I apprehend to be part of 
 the column of our species, near the base sending off its auxiliary fibres, and 
 thereby forming a fascicular ramifying root, by which the animal attached itself 
 to extraneous substances. That these specimens really formed the roots of our 
 •present species, and not portions of a distinct animal, I am induced to believe 
 from having noticed that the mode of articulation of their joints when it can be 
 clearly traced, appears to me to present the same character as has been noticed 
 in the columnar joints described above; and although the proportions of these 
 radical joints are much thinner, broader, and frequently irregularly bevelled, so 
 as at first sight to militate against this appropriation ; yet a similar difference 
 -between the upper columnar and radical joints of other genera, will hereafter 
 he pointed out.
