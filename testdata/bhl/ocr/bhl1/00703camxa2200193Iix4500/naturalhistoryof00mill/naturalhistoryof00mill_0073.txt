II. GENUS ENCRINITES. 
 TRUE LILY-SHAPED ANIMAL. 

Generic Character. 

A Crinoidal animal with a column formed of numerous round depressed 
 )oiiits, adhering by a radiating grooved surface, and becoming snbpeiitangular 
 near the pelvis, which is composed of five pieces, giving a lateral insertion to the 
 first series of costal plates, to which thesecond series and scapulae succeed, Mhence 
 the tentaculated arras or fingers proceed, formed by double series of joints. 

Observation. 

The animals of this genus have not hitherto been found in a living state, nor 
 do I believe that their remains have been discovered in England. They ap- 
 pear to be of very local occurrence. As there occurs but one species Eucri- 
 nus moniliformis, its illustrative Plate ii. forms also an explanation of the ge- 
 neric character.
