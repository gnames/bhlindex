SfltenbU^tJ, 1774, it is asserted that the Emperor of Germany offered 100 dollars 
 fiÂ»r a stone lily free from its matrix and attached to its column. Another and 
 harder stratum under the above contains numerous crinital remains, but 
 according to the quarrymen no stone lilies. Schrapland near H;dle(J9atUJ=

There is good reason to believe that the formation in which these remains 
 are found near Brunswick, corresponds with the white lias of England, as it 
 appears to repose on the newer red sandstone, containing salt and gypsum. 

Description. 

The Column (Pl. 1.) of this animal, which is of considerable length, is 
 formed of numerous round, rather thick, joints, articulating by their striated 
 surfaces ; the radii marking them being near the exterior circumference, having 
 a central smooth area, through whose centre the small alimentary canal passes. 
 As the cohmin proceeds upwards, this simple figure of the joints appears to be 
 interrupted (if we may judge from the line specimen represented in Knork, 
 T. XI. a.) at every 6th or 7th articulation by a joint of wider diameter, and of 
 a globular depressed form, having above and below it a still more com- 
 pressed one. Nearer the summit the joints become thinner and rounded 
 externally, assuming the form of a much depressed and oblate spheroid. 
 They are here disposed alternately, a small one between two larger ones, and 
 again every other larger joint considerably greater. When close to the pelvis,, 
 the same alternation in size continues, but the joints assume a pentagonal 
 shape, to which the radiating striae accommodate themselves. (Pl. ii. fi<r. a. 
 Pl, III fig. 1 ) The middleof these has a pentapelalous impression or jxifora- 
 lion, through whose centre the alimentary canal passes. It is not difficult to 
 see the reason why the columnar joints are pentagonal near the apex, since 
 this is the best figure for allowing additional free motion to the first costal 
 joints, which adhere to and project over the exterior side of the pelvis ; the 
 ]>entapetalous perforation or impression in the superior joints appears to be 
 plainly an enlargement, though a very trifling one, of the alimentary canal, 
 and also to result from the muscles acting on the interior points of the fi.ve 
 plates forming the pelvis ; hence this figure is obliterated in the lower joints. 
 The frequent alternations of the compressed globular joints near the upper ex- 
 tremity of the column, are evidently intended to periuit a greater degree of 
 lateral motion, and their subsequent occasional occurrence allows its free con-
