one of whose points is somewhat truncated. These are So arranged round a 
 common centre, towards wliich tnen- truncated points are directed, as to 
 occupy a small pentaiionai area. At their truncated point they nave a trifo- 
 liated elevation (similar to, though less conspicuous than that noticed hi the 
 former genus) sending off" two lateral Jolds Below that part of the p-ivis 
 which projects heyond the circumference of the column, each joi .t has a small 
 subtubercular swelling, serving it as an ahutment, for tirmer adliesion to the 
 first columnar joint. At the exterior circimiference each joint <Â»r the pelvis is 
 angularly truncated, so that a pentagonal circumference is formed, whose sides 
 being somewhat excavated and faintly striated, give adhesion to the first cos- 
 tal joints. 

The First Costal Joints, (Pl. hi. fig 5. to 7.) which enlarge outwards, 
 form by their union a pentagon surrounding that occupied by the pt^lvis, but 
 inconsequence of the contraction of the four outer marginal edges of these 
 joints, their external surface becomes convex, and in youujr specimens 
 almost tubercular ; thus, at the junction of the pelvis,* a cavity is left between 
 them and the column, sufficient to allow them space for a free power of motion 
 in that direction : (Pl. ii. fig. S. and 4.) and as the animal grows, they gain 
 still farther room by the extension of the pelvis. 

At the inner truncated point of each first costal joint, it is excavated trans- 
 versely in an angular manner, the lower side of this ang'e showing four folds, two 
 uniting to those noticed on the pelvis, and two to the lateral surfaces. From 
 the subconcave surface, a beautiful highly muscular lip-like process, much 
 plicated and scalloped, extends into the abdominal cavity; the centre of this 
 process is excavated so as to lead to a tranverse perforated ridge, thus bearing 
 a near analogy to the formation of the superior costal joint of Apiocrinites 
 rotundus, but being infinitely more delicate and elegant. 

The Second Costal (Pl. hi. fig. S. to 10.) bears great resemblance to the 
 former in figure, in the contraction of the margins at the exterior circumfer- 
 ence, and its consequent convexity; being almost tubercular in young spe- 

* The pelvis on account of its smalhiess is buried in the cavity, aad sannot be seen iu a 
 lateral view. (Pl. ii.)
