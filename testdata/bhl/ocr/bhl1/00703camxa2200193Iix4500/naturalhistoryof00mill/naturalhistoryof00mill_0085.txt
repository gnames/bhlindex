sides in the aljernate joints, so that the line of junction in which they overlay 
 each other, becomes an acutely angular zigzag, and they are thus, as it were, 
 dovetailed tDgetlier; at the same time they shorten their points, not reaching 
 much beyond the middle of the width occupied by the series rising from the 
 same arm joints, this shortening continues until the disposition of the parts 
 at length produce a regular division, extending in a crenated line through the 
 middle of each series, thus giving two joints instead of one to each arm, now 
 properly called fingers, and consequently 20 joints to the whole circumference. 

Each of these finger joints is of a semi-horse-shoe shape, and presents 
 externally a tubercular convexity towards the points of its dovetailed inser- 
 tion, in order to allow greater freedom and pase of motion to the conti<^uous 
 joints. 

Each of the joints sends off laterally a Tentaculum (Pl. ir. fig. 2.) formed 
 of a series of minute depressed horse-shoe shaped joints, tapering to a point. 
 Like the finger joints, the approaching sides of the alternate tenlacula are 
 insinuated or dove-tailed into each other, whence a sort of double serrated edo-e 
 appears. VVhen the fingers are folded up, in which position the figure of this 
 part bears the nearest resemblance to that of a lily, the tentacula are all folded 
 together in the centre, and arranged in an angle with their points upwards, 
 thus forming a conical fasciculus. 

Having thus described the appearance and character of the joints, I shall 
 proceed to a general survey of the abdominal cavity containing the viscera 
 (Pl.ii. fig.3) M'hich is formed by the pelvis, costae. and scapula;. In this 
 species it is not of a funnel-shaped figure as in Apiocrinites, but rather has the 
 form of a much depressed urn, being widest where the first costs are provided 
 with the lip-like processes, then becoming saucer-shaped, and opening at the bot- 
 tom in a pentagonal aperture between the interior truncated points of the 
 pelvis conducting into the alimentary canal. There also exist two rows of 
 orifices in the cavity, farmed by the two series of costas, and the scapulae 
 and first arm joints, as noticed when describing Apiocrinites rotundas. If 
 we may judge by analogy, and from a representation in Hofer's account of the 
 Encrinite, (t. ix. fig. 13.) we may with considerable probability conjecture that 
 this abdominal cavity was also closed by an integument protected by nume- 
 rous plates, having in its centre the aperture of the mouth, and spreading 
 over the inner cavity of the arms, fingers, and tentacula, similar to that
