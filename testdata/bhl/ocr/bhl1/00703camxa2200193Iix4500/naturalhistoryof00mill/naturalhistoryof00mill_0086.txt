which I shall demonstrate wlien speaking of the genus Pentacrinites. A fine 
 specimen in my possession, showing the double serrated edge of the tentacula, 
 proves this assertion, since it exhibits a similarly formed margin to that which 
 marks tiie adhesion of the plated integument in Pentacruius Caput Medusje. 

Mr. Parkinson calculates the number of joints forming the guperior por- 
 tion of this animal at 26,680, which would increase most surprisingly, were we 
 to take into account the minute calcareous plates, that are interwoven in the in- 
 tegument covering the abdominal cavity and inner surfaces of the fingers and 
 tentacula, and add them to the former. 

As an instance how often a superfioinl examination may lead men of ability 
 into error, Mf.ineckf.n in Jl3atU?fO?Sc|^er §>tuecft, 8. p. 245. advances that the 
 tentacula so regularly arranged in the interior of the lily encrinite, have some 
 affinity to the septa in the orthoceratite, yet that these are formed of many 
 pieces! 

The peculiarly fine lily encrinite figured by Knorr, tab. 11. a. was, it is 
 said, purchased (jQatUrfiJlSCljCr g'tuecfe 3.) from the labourers at the limestone 
 quarry at Schrapland, near Halle, by Inspector Wilkens, for32gr<)schin, and 
 given to Professor Lange, who sold it to Baron Niegakt. However in the 
 same publication (^tUCCU 6.) it is stated that it was not bought by Wilkens. but 
 by Mr. ViTiGO, at Farrenstadt, near Querfurt, for two dollars, and given to 
 Lange, who sold it for three louis d'or. If my memory does not misgive me, 
 I think I saw the specimen about twenty years ago in the collection of the 
 jQatUrfOVSljenUen ©eSelStljaft, at Dautzic Where is it now?
