III. GENUS PENTACRINITES vel PENTACRINUS. 

FIVE ANGLED LILY-SHAPED ANIMAL. 

Generic Character. 

An animal with a column formed of numerous pentangular jointsi, articu- 
 Sating by surfaces with pentapetalous semistriated markings. Superior colum- 
 nar joint supporting a pelvis of five joints, on which five first costals rest 
 succeeded by five second costals and five scapulae, from which ten arms pro- 
 ceed, having each two hands, composed of several tentaculated fingers. 

Column long, having numerous auxiliary side arms. 

Base unascertained. 

Observation. -^ 

The generic Jiame is derived from the five cornered shape of the column. 
 One of its species has occurred in a recent state, and furnishes a clue for 
 the illustration of many facts relative to the crinoidea. The genus Alecto 
 of Dr. Leach approximates the genus Pentacrinus to the Asteri^e and 
 CoMATULiE of M. Lamarck. 

There are instances of the column of this genus having sometimes a 
 tetragonal, or hexagonal form, these I consider as monstrous varieties. Of the 
 former figures exist in Townsend's Character of Moses, vol. i. Pl. xi. fig. 5. 
 Parkinson's Org. Rem. vol. ii. Pl. xiil. fig. 59. Hofer, tab. vi. 77. of the 
 latter, Tosvnsend, vol. i. Pl. xi. fig. 2. Bruckman's Thesaurus Subter. Due.
