frequently met with specimens in that state, but as yet have never seen any side

The Column. (Pt, i and Pl. ii. fig. 24. and 26.) The place where the late 
 J. Tobin's, Esq. specimen broke off, was in a part of the column where its 
 joints had acquired a degree of maturity, and the fracture goes slantingly 
 through several of them, thereby demonstrating the small quantity of membrane 
 intervening between them, its tenacity, and also the thinness of the exterior 
 integument that surrounds the joints, which is now so dried up as to be al- 
 most imperceptible, being of a pale yellow, and intimately connected with 
 the calcareous laminar secreted matter forming them. As the column is not 
 broken in such a manner as to afford a correct idea of the adhering surface of 
 the joints, I must refer for this point to the fossil remains of this species occur- 
 ing in the lyas. The alimentai-y canal and its investing membrane are very 
 small: The shape of the column being pentangular, and more or less indented 
 between the five salient angles. (Pl. ii. fig. 24. and 26.) We trace on the in- 
 ferior and superior surface of each columnar joint five subovate petal-like 
 figures, marked by elevated ridges radiating round the tnargin of each of thein, 
 the interior of each of these five petablike figures forms an obloitg, ovate, 
 smooth space, surrounded by the marginal radii, opening by a narrow groove 
 at the intier end, which is the most pointed, into the alimentary canal. On 
 joints not fully formed there is also a depression proceeding from the alimen- 
 tary canal, between the marginal radii surrounding the sides of the contiguous 
 petal-like division, to a smooth space beyond them, filling up the more or less 
 indented, 'and frequently contracted, intervals between them. If we consider 
 this construction in an early state of growth, when the joints are very thin and 
 muscular, and the calcareous secretion is only commencing, and hence follow 
 the operation of nature, we may suppose that the calcareous deposit first 
 formed round the alimentary canal, in the space occupied by the five petal-like 
 divisions and their marginal radii, and thus continues to increase till the joint 
 has acquired a thickness consistent with the proportions and size of the animal. 
 The space between the five petal-like divisions continues muscular a consider- 
 able time longer, and begins only at a later period, and very gradually, to se- 
 crete calcareous matter to strengtiien the deposit round the alimentary canal 
 and to interpose thin layers to keep apart the petal-like divisions. The thin 
 muscular in^^egunient investing the alimentary canal, probably forms a sphinc- 
 ter at the junction of each two joints, dividing here into ten conspicuous por- 
 tions or muscular integuments, one extending to each of the spaces between
