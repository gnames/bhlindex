larity of the column near tlio pelvis, we may readily admit a continuing new form- 
 atiou of joints, by the niuscular integuments developing and increasing in size. 

Auxiliary Side Akms. (Pl. i.) In the late Mr. Tobin's specimen, 
 near the fractured end, at intervals of every 15th, l4lh,or 12th jomt, auxiliary 
 side arms proceed from each of the five spaces intervening between the petal- 
 like divi!?ions ; further np they come ofl'from every Sth, 6lh, and 4lh, and near 
 the pelvis from every second joint. The intervening space between the petal- 
 like divisions being only near the centre calcareous, is peculiarly adapted to 
 supply the auxiliary side arms with nourishment, and to all'ord them points 
 of attachment, they have here also a more convenient space for action and 
 motion. Each of the columnar joints from which they proceed has five oval, 
 transverse, and slightly concave impressions, surrounded by a rim sometimes 
 having a few radiating striaj. Across the greatest diameter of the elliptic area is a 
 ridge, having in its centre a perforation admitting the nourishing vessel, probably 
 supplied by vessels proceeding from the alimentary canal. Each auxiliary arm 
 (Pl. II. fig. 22.) when full grown is formed by about forty joints, of which those 
 near the column are more or less oval and thinner, the following becoming 
 thicker and rounder, but decreasing in size, their surface slants with an angle 
 of about twenty degrees from the perpendicular line of the column, admitting a 
 free motion upwards {on which side they also show a kind of fold) but op- 
 posing a movement downwards. The articulating surfaces (Pl. ii. fig. 15. to 
 17.) are surrounded by an elevated rim, the interior is excavated into two cir- 
 cular concavities of unequal size, so disposed as to resemble the figure 8. the 
 two circles forming it, being separated by a small transverse ridge perforated by 
 the central passage of the nourishing vessel. (Pl. ii. fig. 23.) The termination 
 of the auxiliary side arms is a conic hooked joint, of a polished, greenish, en- 
 ameled appearance; whereas the rest of the animal is of a pale yellow colour. 
 Near the summit of the column, about the fourth series of auxiliary side arms 
 from the pelvis, they become shorter and thinner ; here evidently showing 
 their greater muscularity, bend very slightly, and have their joints, particularly 
 those near the point (which as yet is not hooked) but tiaintly developed. (Pl. 
 II fig. 21.) Those of the second series from the sunnnit, are short, round, spine- 
 .shaped, and particularly near the point so muscular, that not even the termi- 
 nating joint is discernible. (Pl. 2. fig. 20.) The first series of auxiliajy side 
 arms (inserted on a joint which the lower protruding part of the first costals 
 almost touch) is still shorter, and almost rcsemblts in appearance and thick- 
 ness a bristle. The formation of the lower side arms demonstrates the growth
