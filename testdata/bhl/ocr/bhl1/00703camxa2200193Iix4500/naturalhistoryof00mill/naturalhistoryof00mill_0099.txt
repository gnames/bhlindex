of these parts of the animal ; another curious fact is also proved by them, 
 namely, that the animal had the power of reproducing them when broken. 1'hus 
 in the late Mr. Tobin's, specimen, a joint broken transversely near the summit, 
 is seen to have pushed forth a small hook and three other joints. (Pl. ii. tig. 
 I8. and 19.) The reproduction takes place (rom the centre of theold joint, the 
 new formed ones having in their centre the perforation, and as yet appearing 
 very weak. This is a new proof that this perforation serves as a passage to the 
 nourishing vessil, and not a nerve, as many authors have, I believe, suggested. 

The Pelvis, (Pl. ii. fig. 9.) On the first columnar joints rests the pelvis, 
 formed of five nearly cuneiform joints having articulating surfaces probably 
 resembling those of the encrinite. Their five points meet near the alimentary 
 canal, they have each a central ridge above, and as the lower part of their exterior 
 circumference slopes downward to the salient angles of the column, they as- 
 sume externally a leaf-like appearance. 

The First Costal Joints. (Pl. ii. fig. 9.) In the five concave spaces 
 formed by the five joints of the pelvis, the first costals are inserted. They slope 
 at the inner truncated edge, thus forming a saucer-shaped cavity leading to 
 the alimentary canal: they have two (although less conspicuous) bevelled and 
 slightly plicated muscular lip-like processes; the central excavation of these, 
 leading to the perforated transverse subtriangular ridge in the concave space at 
 their superior surface, which has a slanting direction downwards toward the 
 exterior, and serves for the insertion of the second costal joint. The exterior 
 circumference is lunated in the upper part, as far as the costals adhere laterally 
 to each other, having on the inferior part a process which projects for a short 
 distance into the space between the angles of the column, and has a semi-conical 
 figure. 

The Second Cost.\l Joints. (Pl ii. fig. 9 ) The figure of these joints is 
 that of a horse-shoe, having in the interior an excavated truncated termination. 
 The exterior circumference is semicircular, and their lateral edges do not ad- 
 here to each other, but are united by the integuments covering the abdominal 
 cavity. 

TheScAPULiE (Pl. ii, fig. 9) rest on the second costal joints, are of a 
 horse-shoe figure, and adhere laterally to each other oidy by the integument 
 Vnentioned above. At the superior surface, a central ridge extends with a
