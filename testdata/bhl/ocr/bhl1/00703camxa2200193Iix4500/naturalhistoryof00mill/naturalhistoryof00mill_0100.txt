pointed termination to the interior truncated and excavated point, forming two 
 slanting' sides for tlie adhesion of the tirst arm joint. Eacli of these are tra- 
 versed by a perforated ridge running in a shuiting direction from the interior to 
 the exterior point. 

The Arms. â€” The ten arms proceeding from the fivescapulae, (two from each) 
 are each formed of five joints nearly of an horse-shoe figure, sending off from 
 their alternate sides the tentacula. The superior surface of the tirst arm joint 
 (Pl. II. tig. 4.) and the inferior of the second, are subconcave^ perforated in 
 the centre, smooth, with line radiating ridges at the circumference, and want 
 the transverse subtriangular ridge which exists in tiie following arm and linger 
 joints. In these it traverses the superior surfaces (Pl. ii. fig. 1. to 3 ) in an 
 angle from near the place where the tentacnium sets oft' to the opposite exte- 
 rior circumference, and at the inferior surl;\ce in an opposite direction to the 
 former. On the inside the joint is excavated in tlie centre in a sharp angle, 
 it is thicker on the side which sends off the tentacula, being ihere cut in an ob- 
 liquely transverse section, of which the lower portion shows a ridge, the mark of 
 articulation, whilst the upper forms a slender lamina. The i)rojecting point on 
 the other side is slantingly cut ofl'to permit room for the action of tlu- tentacn- 
 ium from the joints below it. There are also several irregular rugre on the ar- 
 ticulating surfaces, serving as points of adhesion to the muscular integnn)ent. 

The upper or si.xth joint of the arm (Pl. ii. fig. II. to 14.) resembles in 
 figure the scapula; this, and those other joints bearing an analogy to it, I have 
 distinguished by the name of cuneiform joints, from their upper surface posses- 
 sing two opposite slopes, and, like a wedge, interrupting the further continu- 
 ing of a series of joints, and rendering it dichotomous. 

The cuneiform joints never send otf a tentacnium, and to obviate the 
 interruption or vacuity thus occasioned in the beautiful net-like apparatus 
 displayed when the hands and fingers with their tentacula are expanded, the 
 number of joints below the cuneiform one generally varies in the hands; thus 
 atlbrding an opportunity for the insinuation of the tentaculum arising from 
 the neighbouring hand^ into the vacant place if required. 

The Hand and Fingers. (Pl. i.) These are twenty in number, two pro- 
 ceeding from the cuneiform joint of each arm. Each series proceeds through 
 about eight or nine joints, and then by means of another cuneiform joint gives
