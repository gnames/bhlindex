not that freedom of parts observable where room is left for increase It is, per- 
 haps, owing to this that all the joints of the hand have laterally, where they 
 adhere near each other (Pl. ii. fig. 4. and 5.) a compressed figure, as also that 
 the first joint of the tentaculiim intrudes on the second joint above it. 

The Platw) Integument (Pl. 1.) covering the abdominal cavity, is in the 
 specimen alluded to, extended beyond thescapnhe, connecting the sides of the 
 arm joints and the hands as far as the first finger joint together, hence de- 
 monstrating a considerable extension of the abdominal cavity. The plates are 
 neatly arranged, forming a sort of rose-like appearance, of which a minute 
 hexagon or heptagon forms the middle. A question here suggests itself, whether 
 the animal in age loses the tentacula of the arms, and those at the commence- 
 ment of the hand? It certainly can here readily dispense with an apparatus of 
 detention, its fingers having increased in size and length, and as the cost* and 
 scnpulie do not grow larger in proportion, it is obvious the covered cavity be- 
 tween them can only be increased by extending the points of adhesion of the 
 iiitegnment between the arms, to which it already adheres where it covers the 
 grooved canal at their inner surface. By dispensing with the tentacula, which 
 are no longer required, their articulating surfaces on the arms, furnish favour- 
 able points for the angular insertion and adhesion of the plates of the integu- 
 ment. The increase of tlie«ize of the abdominal cavity is rendered imperious, 
 by the extension of the viscera necessary for the receiving and preparing of the 
 greater quantity of food, required by the organic wants of an animal materially 
 increased in size and full grown. I am nearly confirmed in the correctness of 
 the above opinions, by having detected in a specimen of P. Briareus the integu- 
 ments adhering to the sides of the first arm joint, which also had no longer a 
 tentaculum, an instance of which is also represented in Mr. Parkinson's Or- 
 ganic Remains. Voi. ii. Pl. xviii. fig. 2, 

Fragments of an animal approaching to P. Subangidaris, but of a smaller 
 and neater shape, occur in the oolite at Dundry, and in the forest marble. It 
 must remain for further favourable opportunities to ascertain what claim thoe 
 •have to a specific distinction, or whether they belong to a variety of preseat 
 species.
