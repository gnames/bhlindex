Locality. 
 In the Lyas â€” at Pyrton Passage. 

This species appears to be characteristic also of a bed of rubbly lias, near 
 the top of the series constituted by that formation; this bed may be traced 
 from the vale of Beivoir, on the borders of Rutland, along the borders of Lei- 
 cestershire, to the tunnels of the Grand Union Canal at Husband Bosworth, 
 and at Crick; thence along the confines of Warwickshire and Northamplon- 
 shire, by Branston tunnel (on the Oxford Canal) and Shuckborough Park, well 
 known for the abundance of these remains. The line of the Oxford Canal con- 
 tinues in the same stratum, past Wormleighton Tunnel as far as Claydon ; (in 
 all the places mentioned it is rich in these fossils), the same bed continues to 
 range round the base of the Colteswould Hills through Glocestershire, but its 
 course has not here been so accurately traced.
