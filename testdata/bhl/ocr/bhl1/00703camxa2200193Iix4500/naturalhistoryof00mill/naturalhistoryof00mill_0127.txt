IV. GENUS POTERIOCRINITES. 
 VASE-LIKE LILY-SHAPED ANIMAL. 

Generic Character. 

A Crinoidal animal^ with a round column composed of numerous thin 
 joints, having in their centre a round ahmentary canal, and articulating by sur- 
 faces striated in radii. Round auxiliary side arms proceeding at irregular dis- 
 tances from the column. Pelvis * formed of five pentagonal plate-like joints, 
 supporting five hexagonal intercostal plate-like joints, and five plate-like sca- 
 pulae, having on one of the intercostals an interscapulary plate interposed. An 
 arm proceeding from each of the scapulas. 

Base, probably fascicular, and permanently adhering. 

Observation. 

The generic name is derived from noTHPiov, a drinking vessel, having been 
 suggested by the resemblance of its figure to that of a common conical wine 
 glass. 

This genus, as far as I have been able to ascertain, contains two species 
 only, P. Crassus, and P. Tenuis ; the former, as was observed, serves as a type 
 for the generic character, the latter bears analogy to it in general formation, but 
 from its plates only adhering by sutures, and not showing articulations, renders 
 the transition to the division IxARTicuLArA perfect. No recent individual be- 
 longing to this genus has been as yet discovered. 

* It is wi«h considerable iiesitation that I describe these five plates as belonging to the Pelvis, 
 the analogy of their lower articulating surfaces, seems, perliaps, rather to indicate their belonging 
 to the fi-»t costal series. I have ncTer yet had an opportunity of seeing the connection of these 
 plates with the first columnar joint fairly developed, and it seems possible that the true pelvis 
 may be small and almost concvaled. This doubt will be done away by the acquisition of more in- 
 structive specimens, and uiy thus stating the case must be considered as resulting from an anxious 
 desire to check errors. It is not unlikely that the real joints forming the pelvis are so much abbrevi- 
 ated as not to be visible externally. Every one acquainted with fossils must be aware how difficult 
 it is to trace always organic details iu them correctly, and how many specimens are sometimes ne- 
 ce»sary to ascertain a single fact.
