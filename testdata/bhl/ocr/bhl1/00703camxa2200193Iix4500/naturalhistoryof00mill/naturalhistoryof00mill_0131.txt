finely striated joints; having a contracted circumference of articulation. Its 
 column has sometimes numerous joints (fig. 18.) swelling gradually out, and 
 thus giving it a barrel-shaped appearance, generally pressed in on one of its 
 sides, and becoming there concave, with a central perforation evidently leadino- 
 to the alimentary canal. This has all the appearance of acicatrized wound, and 
 as the alimentary canal in the column is not increased, tlie swelling can only 
 arise from a more rapid secretion from these joints, probably to strengthen it, 
 and to compensate thus for the injury probably sustained in one of its auxiliary 
 side arms. The cavity before mentioned, was probably produced by the loss 
 or separation of the stump of the injured auxiliary side arm from the column, 
 and the subsequent cicatrizing of the wound. 

The Base of the column is probably similar to that of the genus Cyatho- 
 crinites, which will be hereafter described. 

The Pelvis (fig. 8.) â€” Ou the superior columnar joint rest, as far as I have 
 been able to ascertain, five plate-like joints, which I consider, though with 
 some hesitation, (for reasons stated in the note, page 67.) as forming the pelvis. 
 At their lower surfaces they are smooth, but have a transverse subtriangular 
 ridge, with a central perforation and a narrow lip-like extension. Their lateral 
 surfaces are slantingly truncated to admit the intervention of a muscle. A ridge 
 divides the upper surface into two angularly slanting planes, having each a 
 transverse ridge perforated by a nourishing vessel, and showing a lip-like pro- 
 cess near the inner surface. The superior and inferior surface is, near the ex- 
 terior circumference finely striated for the adhesion and transmission of muscu- 
 lar portions, connecting with the exterior muscular covering of the crinite, and 
 capable of producing on contraction numerous minute tubercles, which may be 
 observed in well preserved specimens. 

The Five Intercostal Plate-like Joints (fig. G. 7. 9. the animal having no 
 costftls), are oblong and hexagonal, one of them being somewhat longer, and hav- 
 ing one of the sides of its superior surface considerably larger. They insert 
 their inferior angle into the five angular spaces formed by theplate-likejointsof 
 the pelvis, articulating to them by nearly .-similarly marked surfice.s. They pre- 
 serve externally the subconical figure, and thu.s enlarge the abdominal cavity. 

The Scapula (fig. 2. to 5.) are inserted into each of the superior angles of the 
 intercostal s. They are thin, plate-like, and subpentagonal, adhering by subtrian-
