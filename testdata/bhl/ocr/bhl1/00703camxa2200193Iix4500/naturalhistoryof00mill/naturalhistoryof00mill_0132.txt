gular ridges to the intercostals, and by their lateral surfaces to parh other. 
 They are obliquely truncated at their superior surfaces, excavated, and have a 
 horse-shoe-like impression, with a subperforated elevated transverse ridge. 

One of the hexagonal intercostal joints having one of the angular sides of its 
 superior surface elongated, has in a specimen in my possession (fig. 1.) a small 
 pentagonal interscapulary plate adhering, whose lateral edges connect with 
 the lower edges of the scapulae, and on whose superior surface another hex- 
 agonal interscapulary plate rests. To avoid an increased distance between the 
 the arms proceeding from the scapulas nearest to this interposed plate, they 
 themselves are smaller, and of a contracted form (fig. 5.) I cannot account for 
 this apparent irregularity in P. Crassus, but a similar one exists in the next 
 species, and in the genera in the division Inarticulata. 

The intercostals and scapulae where they articulate to each other, must have 
 been very muscular, hence a contraction may be traced which produces a 
 waved appearance. 

I have not been fortunate enougli to obtain a specimen extending beyond the 
 scapulae, but from the occurrence on the same slab, (see plate Poteriocrinites 
 Tenuis, fig. 10. and 11.) of joints of the arms, hands and fingers, which, in their 
 organic construction, resemble those of the Pentacrinites, 1 do not hesitate to 
 consider these as belonging to this species. I also have found small plates be- 
 longing to the integument extending over the cup-like abdominal cavity, and I 
 do not doubt its resemblance to that noticed in the Pentacrinites. 

In one instance I have observed a proof of the softness or muscularity of 
 the inside of the pelvis, one of its plates having retained the impression of a 
 columnar joint, which, by accident, came in contact with it previous to its 
 petrifaction.
