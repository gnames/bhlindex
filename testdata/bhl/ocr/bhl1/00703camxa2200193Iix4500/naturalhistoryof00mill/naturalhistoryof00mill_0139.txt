CRINOIDEA INARTICULATA. 

Character of the Division. 

J. HE plates forming the superior cup-like portion of the animal, and enclos- 
 ing the viscera, adhering by muscular sutures. 

Observation. 

The muscular integument which connects the plates to each other, also ex- 
 tends over their interior and exterior surface, effecting by its contractile power 
 the movements of the arms. 

It may be here observed as a geological fact, that as far as I have been able 
 to ascertain, the remains ofthe animals of the former and of this division have never 
 occurred otherwise than in the inclined strata, from the grau wacke to the 
 new red sandstone ; whilst those of the first division belong to the horizontal 
 and more recent beds.
