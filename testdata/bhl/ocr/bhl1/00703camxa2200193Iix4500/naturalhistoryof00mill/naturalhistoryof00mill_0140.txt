V. GENUS. PLA.TYCRINITES. 
 BROAD-PLATED, LILY-SHAPED ANIMAL. 

Generic Character. 

A Crinoidal animal, with an elliptic or (in one species) pentagonal column, 
 formed of numerous joints, having a few side arms at irregular distances. Pel- 
 vis, saucer shaped, formed of three unequal pieces, from which five large plate- 
 like scapulas proceed. 

Base provided with numerous fihres for attachment. 

Observation. 

The generic name has been derived from hlatts, broad or flat, with re- 
 ference to the form of the scapulae. 

The want of costae supplied by the large plate-like scapulae gives the supe- 
 rior part of these animals a pentagonal appearance, and furnishes so conspi- 
 cuous a character, that they are readily distinguished from all other genera.

SMOOTH, BROAD-PLATED, LILY-SHAPED ANIMAL.

 ceeds supporting two hands, having each two fingers.
