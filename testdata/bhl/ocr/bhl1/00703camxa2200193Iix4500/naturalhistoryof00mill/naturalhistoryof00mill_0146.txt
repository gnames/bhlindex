joint to the inferior of that ronti^^'nons to it, and their firm articulation by means 
 of the transverse rid^e, the animal was capahhi of producing through its muscu- 
 lar integument, a kind of twisting, vermicnhir spiral motion (Pl. ii. fig. 1. 18. 
 to 20.) shortening the coliunn by compressing the muscle between the twocalcare- 
 reous plates of each joint, and elevating it by untv\isting and restoring it to its 
 former elasticity. It is evident that this motion would, in many ways, render the 
 lateral motion of the superior part of the animal on its column less necessary; 
 and since the attachment of the pelvis to the column appears to have been 
 slight, and might have been endangered by such a motion, this may have been 
 the object of the contrivance. When the two hard elliptical surfaces, with their 
 elevated ridges are placed obliquely to each other, the joint evidently ap- 
 pears to be considerably compressed, and has a slight four-cornered appearance, 
 having the angles rounded ; w hile along the middle of the exterior circumference 
 the intermediate muscle is pressed out (Pl. ii. fig. 2 1, to SO.) it forms a smooth 
 rim, which is sometimes studded at intervals with tubercles occasionally 
 elongated into a kind of pointed feelers, giving the joint some resemblance to 
 the rowel of a spur. (Pl. ii. fig. 25. to 26.) In general the protruding feelers 
 are longer near the ends of the greater diameter of the elliptical joint, sometimes 
 assuming an inclining direction (Pl. ii. fig. 28. and 30.) and having an indented 
 summit. Tlie alimentary canal of the column is small, probably because the 
 muscular integument was more vascular. 

The Base. (Pl. ii. fig. 52. to 56.) The columnar joints are sometimes 
 rendered unshapely by exuded calcareous matter (Pl. ii. fig. 52. and 
 53) which, near the base, appears to have partially surrounded those 
 numerous muscular fibres which served the animal as organs ot attachment. 
 (Pl. II. iig. 5o and 56.) In spe. inuns where these fibres are decayed and lost, 
 many cavities are left behind in the indurated matter, demonstrating their 
 points of in-ertion. (Pl. ii. iig. 54.) 

The Ai'XiLiAKY Side Arms. From the ends of the greater diameter of the 
 elliptical ciiumnar joints proceed the auxiiiaiy side arms (Pl. ii. fig. 32. and 
 33.) formed of .lumerous round joints, perforated in the centre, and ad hen u"- 
 by s>irlaces uiated in radii. 1 have specimens in my collection (Pl. ii. fij-. 
 39 to 4+. tig. 47. to 51 ) which from their analogy to some side arms still at- 
 tached to tiie column, I consider as continuations of the same. They ar-.^ re- 
 inaikubiy neat, round, and prove their former muscularity by the contraction
