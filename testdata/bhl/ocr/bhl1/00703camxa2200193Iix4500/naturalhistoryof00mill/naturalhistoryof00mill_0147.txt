of tlieir exterior integument, Tlius the smooth ronnd joint of the side arm 
 shows at its external circumference an elevated ritn (Pl, ii. fio;. 39.) the first 
 vestige of contraction, which may be traced througli a series of specimens, to 
 swfU and increase more and more on one side, gradually becoming tubercular, 
 (Pl. II. fig. 40, to 42.) and sending off from about six to eight spine-like mus- 
 cular elongations (Pl. ii, fig, 43, and 44.) not unfrequently proving their former 
 muscular state by a curved inclination downwards. The more the muscle is 
 thus protruded, the closer it approaches to the superior surface of the joint; the 
 line of tubercles assuming a somewhat spiral turn, whereby tiie joint receives a 
 truncated conical figure, its superior surface forming the base of the cone. In 
 young undeveloped s})ecimens the tubercles form a still greater spiral curve. 
 On the surface of the same mass of partially decomposed limestone, I have 
 met with very thin joints resembling those just described, only being very 
 small and much longer, which 1 apprehend belong to this species. (Pl. ii. fig. 
 35, to 37.) Another portion of side arms has also occurred (Pl. ii. fig. 38. and 
 4.5.) where the joints are elliptically compressed, articulating by finely striated 
 surfaces, and having a sort of serrated projection near the upper margin of the 
 joint at the exterior circumference, within the line of curvature when the arm 
 is bent. 

The Pelvis (Pl. i. fig. 2. to 7.) is saucer-shaped, composed of three 
 plates, forming at their superior edge five concave spaces, which are generally 
 finely striated to give a firmer adhesion to the scapulae. 

The Scapulae (fig. 8. to !3.) are five, tile-shaped, thin plates, adhering by 
 their lateral edges to each other, truncated above, and angularly bevelled to 
 these lateral edges. In the centre, at the superior edge, they are excavated, 
 having a somewhat reniform or horse-shoe shaped impression on the exterior, 
 wiiicli presents a ridge of articulation with a central perforation for the reception 
 ot the anus. 

The Arms(Pl. i. fig. 1 . and 14, to 20.) are formed, each by a single cuneiform, 
 joint which adheres to the scapulas. 

The Hands. (Pl. i. fig. 21. to 25.) Two hands proceed from the cuneiform 
 joints of the arm, each is formed by a horse-shoe shaped joint, and a cimeiform 
 one.
