Two Fingers (Pl. i. fig. 1.) set off from the cuneiform joint of each hand. 
 They are composed of two series of joints adhering at one of their lateral sur- 
 faces to each other by bevelled edges, in a manner similar to those of Eucri- 
 nites moniliformis. 

The Tentacula. â€” From the joints of the hand and fingers the tentacula 
 proceed, which resemble those of other crinoidea. 

An Integument protected by numerous (sometimes very regularly formed) 
 plates, extends as usual over the abdominal cavity and the sulcus on the arms, 
 hands, fingers, and tentacula. 

That the plates increased in size by laminar secretions formed externally 
 as in Apiocrinites rotundus, I have been able to ascertain from a decomposed 
 specimen. (Pl. i. fig. 26. and 27.) 

I have a joint (Pl. h. fig. 31.) of asubtriangular circumference in my col- 
 lection, which I apprehend may have been an unusual and monstrous form of 
 the superior columnar joints of this species. The central ridge of arliculation 
 noticed in the joints described is here divided into three radii, each subdividing 
 where they approacli the exterior circumference, into several fine ridges, and 
 thus rendering the margin crenulated. 

In one instance (Pl. i. fig. 28.) the pelvis and scapula; are covered with tu- 
 bercles indented at their centre, in my opinion the effects of disease. 

I have noticed in the collection of Richard Bright, Esq. of Ham Green, 
 near Bristol, numerous joints, probably appertaining to an animal forming a va- 
 riety of the former, or a distinct species. They came from Mnir-kirk in Dum- 
 frieshire. The scapulas are shorter in proportion than those of the former spe- 
 cies, and the columnar joints are finely tuberculated.
