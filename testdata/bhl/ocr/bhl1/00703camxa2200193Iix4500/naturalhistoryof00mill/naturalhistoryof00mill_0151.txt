Description. 

Its column (fig. 11. to 16.) is of a similar figure to that of the former spe- 
 cies, but of a superior size. The exterior tubercles on the columnar joints are 
 also placed near one end of the greatest diameter of their elliptical circumfer- 
 ence. They are sometimes depressed at their summit, showing a tendency to 
 form new auxiliary side arms. 

The Pelvis (fig. 2. to 6.) is flat, considerably extending beyond the dia- 
 meter of the column, having at its lower surface the impression for the pur- 
 pose of articulation comparatively small.
