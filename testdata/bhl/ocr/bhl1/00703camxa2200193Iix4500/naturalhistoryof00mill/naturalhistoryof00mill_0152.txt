The Five Scapulae (fis- 7.) adhere to the upper ecl<?e of the pelvis, are 
 thick, siiort, bevelled at the summit, with an excavation, and a horse-shoe 
 shaped impression for the insertion of the arms. 

The pelvis and scapnls (fig. 1. to 7.) are thicker near the centre than at their 
 margin of adhesion, and display their muscularity in a conspicuous manner. 
 Previous to the exertion of the contracting muscular pow<M- of the animal they 
 are nearly smooth, sloping towards the sutures (tig. 1. 22. to 24.) On contrac- 
 tion, the bevelled edges become rounded, and the smooth surface uiidulating 
 and corrugated. (fig. 3. and 6.) On still further contraction, the various 
 branches of the muscles become visible, and the pelvis shows two or three se- 
 ries of tubercles (fig. 1. 4. and 7.) viz. four, three, and two, in the smaller plate of 
 the pelvis, and six, four, and two, on each of the two larger. In this case five or 
 six tubercles are arranged in a crescent on the scapulas, below the horse-shoe-like 
 depression, having sometimes another similar series under them. In other speci- 
 mens I have observed each tubercle in this second or lower series, assuming an 
 oblong figure, (fig. 18. and 19.) and traced it until it connected with the tubercle 
 above it, and forming, together with it, a single ridge, (fig. 17. 20. and 21.) thus 
 displaying on each of the scapulae several radiated ridges. In a specimen in my 
 possession (fig. 5.) a still greater number of tubercles are visible, which are 
 irregularly arranged. 

Akjis and Hands. â€” On each of the scapulae is inserted a cuneiform joint, 
 forming the arm (fig. 8. and 9.) on which the two joints of the first series of the 
 hand affix (fig. 10.) having each at their summit a cuneiform joint, sending 
 off on the one side a finger, and on the other the second series of the hand, sur- 
 mounted by another cuneiform joint supporting two fingers. 

The Fingers (fig. 1.) are formed each of two series of joints resembling 
 those of Encrinites moniliformis, and sending otl'like them series of tentacula. 

The Integument over the abdominal cavity is protected by large and 
 thick ani^ular plates, and is capable of elongating it:.elf in the centre into a pro- 
 boscis, analagous to that in Actinocrinites, which will be hereafter described.
