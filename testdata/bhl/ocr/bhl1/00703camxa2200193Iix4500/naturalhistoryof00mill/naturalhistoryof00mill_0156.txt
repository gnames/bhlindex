.,, Descriplion. 

It is a small, slender, thin and neat species (fig. 1. to 3.) The granula; 
 (fig. 3.) on the scapulae are sometimes regularly arranged in series forming radii 
 extending from the horse-shoe-like impression into which the arm was inserted. 
 From the smallness of the horse-shoe-like impression I conceive that the arras 
 were formed of several joints.

 adhesion to the column. The five scapulae have only a small horse-shoe-like 
 impression at tlieir upper edge. Pelvis and scapulae externally striated. 
 Column unascertained.
