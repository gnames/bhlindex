Locality. 

Black Rock (14th bed of Dr. Bright's series in Geol. Trans. Vol. iv. p. 
 193.) near the river Avon, Bristol, belonging to the Mountain Lime formation. 

Descrpition. 

The saucer-shaped pelvis (fig. 1. and 2.) is externally marked by an elevated 
 ridge going to each of its five points, from which other ridges radiate to the 
 concave spaces between them. The ridges on the scapulae (fig. S. and 4.; radiate 
 from the horse-shoe-shaped impression at their summit, to the pelvis and their 
 lateral edges. From the neck-like contraction of the pelvis, near its point of 
 adhesion to the column, and its thinness, I suspect that it was covered by a 
 thick gelatinous epidermis, extending itself over the radiated surface to the 
 arm joints. 

VI. SPECIES. PLATYCRINITES PENTANGULARIS. 
 FIVE-ANGLED, BROAD-PLATED, LILY-SHAPED ANIMAL. 

Specific Character. 

A Crinoidal animal, with a pentagonal column formed of joints alternately 
 thicker and thinner, articulating by a striated rim. At the summit of the 
 column, a cup-shaped pelvis supporting five scapulae, from which five arms, 
 formed each of five joints and a cuneiform joint, proceed. 

Localitt/. 

In the Mountain Limestone of the Mendip Hills, at Weston-super-mare, 
 Black Rock near Bristol, and at Mitchel Dean; also occasionally in transition 
 Limestone of Dinevawr Park, and Dudley. 

Description. 

The pentagonal column of this Crinite and Cyathocrinites quinquangularis, 
 have led superficial observers to consider it as belonging to the genus Pentacri-
