mits of the costal plates, are of a form similar to those of Poterio€rinites,and have 
 also above a horse-shoe-like impression, with a transverse, perforated rid"-e, on 
 which is inserted the first arm joint (fig. 10. and llj to which the cmieiform 
 joint of the arm articulates. 

The Hands.— Several horse-shoe-shaped joints (12. to 13. fig. IB. to 19.) 
 closely resembling those of Pentacrinus Caput Medusae, articulate and arrange 
 in two series on the cuneiform joint. Each series has at its summit a cuneiform 
 joint, from whose upper angular portion the two first series of a double hand 
 set off, interrupted again by a cuneiform joint, from which a finger and a second 
 series of hand joints proceed, terminated by another cuneiform joint which 
 supports two fingers. Each hand, as far as I could ascertain, has six fingers, 
 the whole number of them, therefore, amounts to sixty; they are all tentacu- 
 lated at alternate sides, and resemble those of Pentacrinus Caput Medusa-. 

An hexagonal or heptagonal plate generally interposes between the sca- 
 pulae where the truncated costal occurs, from which the integument, protected 
 by calcareous plates, extends over the abdominal cavity and sulcy in the arms 
 and hands. In a specimen in the Ashmolean collection at Oxford (fig. 29.30.) 
 this integument is swollen out, and gives the specimen a singular appearance. 

The base of the column terminates in a fasciculum of muscular fibres. 

A specimen has occurred to me, where the columnar joints (fig. 22. to 24.) 
 are alternately smaller and larger. I am not aware whether it possesses suffi- 
 cient character to be considered a variety of the former species.
