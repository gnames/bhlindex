II. SPECIES. CYATHOCRINITES TUBERCULATUS. 
 TUBERCULATED, CUP-LIKE, LILY-SHAPED ANIMAL. 

Specific Character. 

A'Crinoidal animal, having a column formed of round compressed joints 
 â– with radiatingly-striated articulating surfaces ; from each of the five scapulae 
 proceeds an arm supporting two hands. Externally tuberculated. 

Localiti/. 
 Probably at Dudley, in Transition Limestone. 

Description. 

The specimen (fig. 1.) from which I have derived the specific character, 
 was presented to mebyT. Smith, Esq. of Eastou Gray, Glocestershire, through 
 the hands of the Rev. R. Halifax, of Standish. 

It is very neat and small, indicating, however, that the species might pro- 
 pably increase to a considerable size. There is but little of the column left 
 which adheres to the pelvis. The costa and scapulas have each a double stiies 
 of tubercles, arising from the contraction of the muscular integument in such a 
 direction as might give motion to the arm, which is formed of two joints, a 
 common and a cuneiform one. From this two hands proceed, in which the 
 number of joints of the first series amount to two, supporting a cuneiform joint 
 which, on one side gives rise to a finger, and on the other, to four or five joints 
 continuing the hand and forming its second series, on whose summit a cunei- 
 form joint adheres and sends off two fingers. 

Externally the arms, hands, and fingers, are ornamented with four or five 
 longitudinal impressions, the result of contraction. 

C. SxoKiis, Esq. of London, had the kindness to send me a drawing (fig. 2.) 
 of the fingers of an Encrinite, from Dudky, which I apprehend belong to this 
 species, and as it conveys a correct idea of the manner in which the animal 
 contracted them, I have annexed a figure of it.
