near the base, showing at the cu'cumference a swelling out of the surrounding 
 muscular covering, forming more or less regular and conspicuous tubercles 
 perforated at their summit. These are sometimes elongated into fibres, branch- 
 ing and dividing at intervals. The tubercles have at their summit a round per- 
 foration, which extends through their middle vthen they are elongated into fibres. 
 It is difficult to explain of what utility they are to the animal, unless we consider 
 them as secreting tubes, or as feelers by which the animal might have explored 
 substances near it. 

The Base. (fig. 4.) The elongated subdividing fibres proceeding abun- 
 dantly from the lowel- portion of the column, form a kind of fascicular or rather 
 root-like base, and where two or more individuals occur near each olhei-, these 
 fibres appear to have lost their muscularity, to have exuded calcareous matter, 
 â€¢or become themselves gradually converted into it ; and being no longer of utility 
 to the animal in any other way, they have become connecte<l with the contiguous 
 individuals^ forming with them one substance (fig. 3.) the animals so uniting, in 
 consequence losing their locomotive power. 

The Pelvis is formed of five plates, is hollowed out at the bottom for the 
 reception of the upper columnar joint, adhering to it by its radiatingly striated 
 surface, and perforated in tlie centre for the pentapetalous passage of the ali- 
 mentary canal. The outer rim of its five plates bends upwards, forming a sort 
 of saucer, each plate being angularly pointed at its superior edge. 

The Five Cost^ are inserted in the angular spaces formed by the pelvis, 
 four of them are hexagonal, and one is heptagonal, having its summit partly 
 truncated, to which a small hexagonal plate adheres. 

The Scapula: are inserted in the angles formed at the upper edge by the 
 costae, having at iheir summit a horse-shoe-like depression for the articulation 
 of the arm joints. 

I have not seen a specimen by which I could ascertain the form of the arms, 
 fingers, and tentacula; but believe them in general form, analogous to those of 
 the former species, possessing also the muscular plated integument. 

Externally the outer surface of the portion of the plates of the pelvis where 
 they are turned up, the costae and scapulae (fig. 1.) are marked by rugged striae.
