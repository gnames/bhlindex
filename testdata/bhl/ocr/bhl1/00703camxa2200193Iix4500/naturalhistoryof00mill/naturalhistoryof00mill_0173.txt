The disposition of these striae is as follows ; from the centre of each plate a rid"e 
 proceeds to each side of the polygon formed by it, bisecting each of the trian- 
 gular areas into which it may be resolved ; all the other strise contained in each 
 of these areas are parallel to this first. (See fi>i. 1.) The configuration of the 
 contiguous plates being similar and adapted to each other, the markings proceed 
 over them in the same direction, thus producing a series of triangular striae, 
 arranged in such a manner that the ramifications from three contiguous plates 
 contribute to compose a single triangle. This disposition, which is common to 
 this aud nearly all the following genera, will be better understood by an inspec- 
 tion of the plate, than from any verbal description. These rugged ridges ap- 
 pear to have resulted from the ramifying structure and contraction of muscles 
 adhering to the centre of each plate, where a rough and granular surface indi- 
 cates the points of their attachment, and thence acting partly towards the arms 
 to produce tiieir motion, and partly towards the pelvis and column. 

The fibres at the base of this animal are frequently found entangled in the 
 branches of a coral, which I have called in my manuscript catalogue Hexapora 
 Cyathocrinoidea. 

It is this species whose superior portion and the markings of its plates bear 
 great resemblance to the Marsupite (a name proposed by Gideon Mantell, 
 Esq. of Lewes, in his manuscript account of the Southdown fossils), or Tor- 
 toise Encrinite of Mr. Parkinson, which animal forms the approximating 
 genus or intermediate link between this family and the genus Euriale of 
 Lamarck.
