 VIII. GENUS. ACTINOCRINITES, 

RADIATED, LILY-SHAPED ANIMAL. 

Generic Character. 

A Crinoidal animal, with a round column composed of numerous joints, 
 perforated by a round alimentary canal. At the summit of the column is placed 
 a pelvis formed of three plates^ on which five first costals and one irregular 
 costal adhere; which are succeeded by the second costals and intercostals and 
 the scapulae, from whence five arms proceed, forming two hands, with several 
 tentaculated fingers. 

Round Side Arms proceed at irregular distances from the column, which 
 terminates at the base in a fascicular bundle or root of fibres. 

Observation. 

The Greek aktis, whence aktinotos, radiated, furnishes the name of this 
 genus in reference to the radiated markings of the costal and intercostal plates, 
 which are peculiarly conspicuous in this genus. When the arms deprived of 
 their fingers project laterally from the subglobose body at the summit of the 
 column, they bear some resemblance to the rays or spokes fixed in the nave of 
 a wheel ; from whence Mr. Parkinson applied the name of Nave Encrinite, to 
 one of the species of the animals belonging to this genus, which also may be 
 considered to have an additional allusion to the Greek generic name. 

None have as yet been found recent, and the scientific world, I believe, is 
 exclusively indebted to Mr. Parkinson for the discovery that the subglobose 
 body, with the fingers and tentacula attached, of the species arranged in this 
 genus, forms not the root but superior portion of the animal. It is this ingeni- 
 ous discovery and exposure of an error of former writers on these animals, 
 which has greatly contributed to the better understanding of their economy and 
 anatomical details. Mr. Parkinson's able work on the Organic Remains of a 
 former World must indeed be considered as a publication of the greatest im- 
 portance in the study of these remains, and in particular as having given a great 
 impulse in England to their investigation.
