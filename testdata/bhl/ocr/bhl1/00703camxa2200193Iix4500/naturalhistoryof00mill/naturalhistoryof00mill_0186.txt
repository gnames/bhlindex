lodged in a socket or concave impression on the column ; but when increase 
 of size renders a stronger support necessary, two or three succeeding joints of 
 the side arms become imbedded in this socket, (for which its extension as 
 already noticed, allows room) and these joints instead of being arranged in a 
 series branching off at right angles from the column, become oblique, their 
 direction inclining.upwards so as to aid in bearing the additional weight. The 
 first joint of the side arms where thus obliquely inserted in the columnar 
 socket have that portion of their circumference which is presented towards 
 the upper part of the column, truncated, in such a curve as may fit 
 them to the concavity of the impression where they rest against it, (Pt. 
 A.lasvis, fig, 29. to 33.) The surface of these joints which fit into the co- 
 lumnar impression is smooth (Pl. A.la;vis, fig, 31.34, and 38.) being des- 
 tined for adhesion only, but the articulating surface between the contigu- 
 ous joints (fig. 32. 33. and 35.) where motion also is to be allowed, exhibits the 
 usual mechanism of radiated ridges and furrows. These joints are convex on 
 the side nearest the column, and concave on that most remote. The auxiliary 
 side arms have sometimes others laterally branching from them, (A. lasvis, 
 fig. 30.) I have, however, never been able to ascertain their termination.* 

The Pelvis (Pl. jii. fig. 1. to 8.) is formed of three plates and saucer- 
 shaped, presenting at its upper edge six depressions for the adhesion of as 
 many plates of the next scries. 

The Six First Costals (Pl. ii. fig. 3.) adhere to the upper edge of the 
 pelvis, are plate-l:ke, and of two distinct forms ; five of them are hexagonal, 
 and one (the irregular first costal) is pentagonal. 

The Second Costals, (Pl. ii. fig. 3. to 5.) On the upper edge of each of 
 the five hexagonal first costal plates, is placed an hexagonal second costal 
 plate. 

â™¦ Since the mode of insertion of these side arms is such as would facilitate their becoming de- 
 tacked, and the vessel by which they receive nourishment from the alimentary canal very small, 
 the rdea once suggested itself to my mind, that these complicated side arms might possibly 
 foe the rudiments of young animals, which after drawing their nourishment for a time only 
 from the parent, drop off and become independent. In our present state of Ignorance concern- 
 ing the propagation of these animals, it seems improper to suppress the statement of this possi- 
 bility, which would at once be confirmed or confuted by the discovery of the termination of these 
 side arms; since, if the conjectnre is correct, they must present the rudiments of the peWis, &c. 
 Ou the whole, however, I am rather inclined to reject than adopt this idta.
