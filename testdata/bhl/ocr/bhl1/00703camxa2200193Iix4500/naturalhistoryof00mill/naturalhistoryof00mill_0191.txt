The Intercostals (Pi,, ii. fig. 1 . to 3.) are pentagonal, one of them is in- 
 serted between each of the second costal s, except over the pentagonal firsl 
 costal plate (Pl. ii. fig. 2.) where on account of its angle being unable to sup- 
 port a second costal plate, two intercostals adhere laterally to each other. 

On each of the five second costal plates adheres a Scapula, (Pl. h. fig. 
 4. and 5.) having laterally two hexagonal interscapulary plates interposed, 
 except over the enlarged interval, where, in the preceding series, the two inter- 
 costals laterally adhere to each other over the pentagonal first costal plate, and 
 where, in this series, instead of two only, three interscapulary plates intervene 
 between the scapuls. 

We have thus the figure of a cup completely formed, of which the arm- 
 joints adhering to the scapuljE, and several multangular pieces (called by rae 
 pectoral plates) belonging to the plated integument, form the rim. 

That all these plates must have adhered by muscular attachment and liga- 
 ments, since they have no regular articulating surfaces, is evident from neces- 
 sity. That the action of muscles extending over them, could only produce 
 the pulling down of the arras and contraction of the upper portion of the ani- 
 mal, may be readily supposed, and is fully proved by an examination of the 
 fossil remains. The muscular force acting from the adhesion of the pelvis to 
 the column as a fixed point, (Pl. ii. fig. Land 2.) extends over the pelvis to 
 the suture of the first costals, and from thence to their centres. Now it 
 is evident as the pelvis consists of three pieces, and the first costal series of 
 six, that three costals will be placed over the divisions of the pelvis, and three 
 over the middle of each of its plates. The muscular action exhibits hence a 
 diflTerent form of contraction on the different costals arising from this variety of 
 position. A simple contraction produces two folds on those over the sutures of 
 the plates of the pelvis (Pl. hi. fig. 9. and 17.) and a single one on tliose inter- 
 mediate. (Pl. hi. fig. 12. and 13.) A stronger action produces four folds on 
 the former (Pl. hi. fig. 11. and 18.; and three on the latter (fig. 14.) As this 
 action extends to the central adhesion of the muscles on each plate, and com- 
 municates from hence to its sutures and to the centres of the approximate 
 plates, it produces folds somewhat similar in general disposition to those 
 described in Cyathocrinites rugosus, page 90, but lessening in number as 
 they approach the scapula. (Pl. iv. fig. 14. to 26.) Irregular and partial con-
