tractions produce sometimes? additional folds and elevations. (Pl. iv. fig. 1. 
 to 11.) If iuiy doubt should still be entertained whether these folds and mark- 
 ings on the plates are really derived from muscular contractioUj on the ground 
 thatthey may have possibly resulted from the original configuration of the solid 
 calcareous matter which forms them ; a general view of their phenomena, and 
 change of figure under various circumstances, in a manner which may be readily 
 accounted for on the hypothesis of their muscularity, but not on any other, 
 Avill, I am persuaded, remove these doubts ; but I have it in my power to 
 adduce a proof still more decisive. There are some costal plates in my pos- 
 session which appear to have been torn from the animal with violence while 
 living, or before decomposition took place. The consequence of this would 
 naturally be that the lacerated muscle would shrink from the edges of the 
 plates towards its point of adhesion in the centre ; and accordingly this is 
 exactly the appearance preserved in the fossil specimens ; the surface where 
 denuded of its muscle, being irregularly corrugated, (Pl. iii. fig. 15. 16. and 
 20.) whilst the muscular folds are gathered into the centre. 

As the pelvis supports six plates, it might have been reasonably concluded 
 that it was the intention of nature to sustain six arms ; and as the animal has 
 actually only five, that the omission must either create a great vacancy, 
 or give rise to a necessary alteration of the general mechanism, in order to 
 render the circular net, formed by the arms and fingers when extended, com- 
 plete. Nature however is never at a loss, but accomplishes her purposes with 
 ease, notwithstanding the new difficulties that are created by continually vary- 
 in" structures. Thus in this animal tlie apparent difficulty so presented is 
 obviated by the change of form in the supernumerary costal which is penta- 
 gonal, while the other five are hexagonal. From the general arrangement of 
 the plates, these five hexagonal costals can only give rise to a series of second 
 costals, terminating in scapulae and arms, (Pl. ii. fig. 1.) while the irregular or 
 sixth costal plate intervening between them, (Pl. ii.fig.3.) having a pentagonal 
 form, and presenting only the edges of its upper angle to the next row, supports 
 two series of intercostal plates occupying the interval, occasioned by its interpo- 
 lation, and so formed that this interval in the succeeding rows gradually 
 diminishes in proportion to the whole circumference, so that although there 
 is still a somewhat greater distance here between the two scapulae placed oa 
 either side of it, than between the other scapula, yet the irregularity is not such 
 as to occasion any material inconvenience or interruption of symmetry. The
