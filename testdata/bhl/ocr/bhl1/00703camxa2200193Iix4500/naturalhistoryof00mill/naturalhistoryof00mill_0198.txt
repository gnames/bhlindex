A small Clavicular Joint inserted between the two hands proceediiii* 
 from one scapula, separates the integument and vessels under it in their pro- 
 gress upwards. (Pl. ii. fig. 5.) 

Capital Plates.— (Pl. iv. fig. SO. to 39.) — The plates forming the upper 
 part of the integument over the abdominal cavity, I have named capital plates ; 
 they have like the pectoral plates different angles, but are covered by a thicker 
 muscle, which is connected (although only slightly so, as appears from the 
 pectoral plates not exhibiting those folds which result from strong muscular 
 action) with those proceeding from the pelvis over the first costals, and laterally 
 extending upwards over the intercostals and pectorals. It receives a new 
 impulse from a sphincter-like muscle placed in the centre, which is capable 
 of forcing up the margin of the mouth into an elongated and protruding 
 proboscis, and at the same time contracting the area between the arms, 
 and thereby enabled to pull these up, and bring the hands and fingers 
 together in a close fasciculus. Meanwhile the muscle or portion of muscle 
 covering each capital plate, is also able by its contraction to draw up 
 in the centre, and thereby to form a more or less elongated tubercle, whose office 
 it probably is to push on the food to the mouth, so that tire whole integument 
 thus assumes an echinated appearance. When the contractile force is most 
 strongly exhibited, the proboscis also becomes studded with similar tubercles 
 (Pi. II. fig. 1 . and 2.) but otherwise those tubercles are exhibited only on the 
 capital plates more remote from the caitre, those near the proboscis remain- 
 ing smooth. (Pl. II. fig. 6. and 7.) On the relaxation of the muscles these 
 tubercles disappeaV — the proboscis gradually subsides — the space between the 
 arms widen — and the fingers are permitted to expand. Specimens in every 
 state of contraction occur in a fossil state, and most distinctly prove that the 
 markings and appearances described, can be ascribed only to muscular action.
