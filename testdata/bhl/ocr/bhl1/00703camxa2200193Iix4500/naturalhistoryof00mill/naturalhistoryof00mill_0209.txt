plates and columns, of an actinocrinite occurring there, resembling Actino- 
 crinites triaconta dactylus. Its plates (fig. 1. to 10.) are, however, generally 
 speaking, more smooth than those of the former species, yet showing a great 
 degree of muscularity. In many instances they appear to have lost the mus- 
 cle (fig. 5. 8. and 9.) which covered them, and then beautifully display their 
 gradual formation in laminae successively applied to each other. 

The columnar joints Cfig. 11. to 37. and 47.) are remarkably neat, but fre- 
 quently display the results of injury and partial repair, in interposed por- 
 tions (fig. 44. and 45.) and irregular wrinkles, (fig. 46.) 

The auxiliary side arms (fig, 28. to 38.) branch from the column irregularly, 
 and in one specimen (fig. 40. and 41.) a side arm comes off with a curve, hav- 
 ing its point bent back upon and adhering to the column ; this position was 
 probably occasioned by an irregularity in growth. 

From a reluctance to increase without necessity, the number of species, I 
 confine myself at present to merely mentioning the singularities of these spe- 
 cimens ; but should further researches prove it a truly distinct species, I think 
 Actinocrinites laevis would form a good name.
