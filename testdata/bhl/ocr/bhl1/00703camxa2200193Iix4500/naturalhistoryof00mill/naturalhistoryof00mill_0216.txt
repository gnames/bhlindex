is of an elliptical form, having the sides pressed in, but becomes round as the 
 arm elongates. The growth and insertion of the auxiliary side arms in the 
 column, is conformable to what was observed when speaking of Actinocrinites 
 triaconta dactylus. One specimen (fig. 8. and 9.) in my possession shows the 
 conical insertion of the first auxiliary arm joint very distinctly. 

The pelvis (Pl. i. fig. 5. and 6.) is saucer-shaped, composed of three plates, 
 having in the depressed centre where they articulate to the column, a pentapeta- 
 lous opening forming the entrance to the alimentary canal. At the upper edge 
 they are excavated, forming five slightly concave spaces, showing a finely 
 striated rim at the exterior margin for the firmer articulation of five intercostal 
 plates. 

On account of the first Intercostal Plates, which are of an oblong 
 square form, inclining outwards, an angle is formed between each two, into 
 which a first costal plate is inserted. 

The five First Costal Plates are heptagonal and pointed, supporting 
 each a hexagonal second costal plate, and a scapula. 

On the first intercostal plates (Pl. i. fig. 2.) rest a series of several hex- 
 agonal oblong intercostal plates, gradually decreasing in size upwards, hav- 
 ing in the angles between them and the costals a few irregular intercostals, 
 placed in a double series on the sides where (as in the former species) the 
 structure of the animal occasions that wider interval between two of the arms 
 than between the rest, for the purpose of which we are yet unable to account. 
 The intercostals and irregular intercostals mix above with the mass of minute 
 plates belonging to the integument over the abdominal cavity. 

The Arms and Fingers. From each of the scapula; proceed two first arm 
 joints, and from these a second, between whose inner angles a clavicular plate 
 is inserted. C. Stokes, Esq. sent me a drawing of the superior portion 
 of this animal found at Dudley (Pl. I. fig. 1.) which shows that the arms sup- 
 port two hands each provided with several fingers. 

A radiating contraction (Pl. i. fig. 2.) is capable of being formed by mus- 
 cular action ou each of the costal and intercostal plates, similar to that noticed 
 in Actinocrinites Polydactylus. A powerful contraction (fig. 3.) arising from
