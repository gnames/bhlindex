Locality. 

Switzerland, at Mount Randen (Knorr) ; also in the Canton Zurich and 
 Schafhousen. 

Description. 

Tlie first appearance of the enlarged columnar joint with its attached pelvis, 
 much resembles the unripe fruit of the clove-tree, Eugenia Caryophyllata, 
 (formerly Caryopbyllus aromatica) so well known among common culinary 
 spices. From hence it has taken its name, having attracted from this circum- 
 stance and its frequent occurrence, particularly at Mount Randen, the atten- 
 tion of the earlier naturalist who considered it as a petrified fruit, until Llwyd 
 gave the first hint that it belonged to the crinoidal family. 

It is unfortunate that the other portions of this animal have not as yet been 
 identified, and I have further to regret that, from my want of opportunity and 
 connection in Switzerland, I have been hitherto unable to procure more illus- 
 trative specimens. I hope however at some future time to enter further in its 
 investigation, under more favourable circumstances. 

The firstCoLUMNAR Joint is slightly pentangular, where its inferior surface 
 covered with radiating stria; has evidently articulated with the joint next below 
 it, and displays in the centre the perforation of the alimentary canal. Upwards 
 it enlarges, showing at the summit a pentangular circumference, arising from 
 the columnar joint accommodating itself to the frequent pressure of the lower 
 portion of the costal joints, which as in the Pentacrinite must have depended 
 over it. This joint must have originally possessed a yielding and cartilaginous 
 texture and consistency, which is indicated in the specimens by a slight curve, 
 evidently occasioned by the pressure resulting from a lateral inclination of the 
 superior part of the animal. Its upper surface is slightly convex, but it again 
 slopes downwards towards the centre, thus becoming concave where the en- 
 trance of the alimentary canal is situated. 

The Pelvis. An anchylosis firmly connects with the first joint of the 
 column the five joints of the pelvis, which are of a depressed rhombic figure, and 
 arranged on it in a similar manner to those of Encriaus moniliformis. Each of
