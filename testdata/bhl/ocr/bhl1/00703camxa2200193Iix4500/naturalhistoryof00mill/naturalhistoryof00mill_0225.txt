the joints is at the exterior circumference angularly truncated, so tifat a penta- 
 gonal circumference is formed, the sides of which are slightly excavated. On 
 each of the sides of the angle arising from the truncation of the joints of the 
 pelvis, at the exterior surface, a transverse ridge with a central perforation may 
 be traced, which unites with that from the neighbouring joint, and thus offers 
 a firm articulation m each of the five excavated spaces for one of the first costal 
 joints, which gam further support by resting against the column where they 
 occasion the impression noticed before. 

I have no hesitation in saying that this animal when perfect must have borne 
 considerable resemblance to Encrinites moniliformis ; yet it appears to be suf- 
 ficiently distinguished from that genus by the enlarged first columnar joint, 
 and the firm adhesion and growing together of the pelvis with it. It is this 
 latter circumstance which at once accounts for the columnar joint never occur- 
 ring vcithout the pelvis. 

1 cannot, however, omit to suggest a conjecture concerning these specimens, 
 â€¢which has occurred tome as probable, with regard to the anchylosing of the 
 pelvis to the column. The Crinoidea in an early stage of growth, as I have shown 
 when speaking of Pentacrinus caput medusae, do not display the different joints 
 of which they are composed in so distinct and well marked a manner as on 
 mature age ; the calcareous matter forming their nucleus has not yet been 
 secreted in sufficient quantity, and remains so involved with the membranous 
 parts, as often to render it impossible to determine the line of separation 
 between one joint and the other. Now the specimens ofEuGENiA crinites quin- 
 quangularis, occur only of a very small size ; and I have before alluded to the 
 marks of original cartilaginous consistency exhibited by one in my possession. 
 Should then these remains be those of young animals, in which an insufficient 
 calcareous secretion has not as yet distinctly separated the plates, they might 
 very possibly assume the regular character of the genus Encrinites in a more 
 advanced stage of their growth. Of course in this case it would become neces- 
 sary to suppress this genus, and incorporate it in that indicated.
