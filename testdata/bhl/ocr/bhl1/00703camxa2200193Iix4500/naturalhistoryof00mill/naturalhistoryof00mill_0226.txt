-In the course of my observations on the Crinoidal remains, several have oc- 
 curred to me whichj although I as yet possess only fragments of them, I do 
 not wish to pass over entirely without notice. 

1. The superior portion (fig. 6.) of a Crinoidal animal, probably belonging 
 to the genus Cyathocrinites, from the Mountain limestone of the Mendip Hills. 
 It is on account of its decomposed surface that I am unable to speak positively 
 as to its generic character. What may be traced proves it considerably ana- 
 logous to Cyathocrinites planus, but having fewer joints interposed between 
 the cuneiform ones from which the fingers and continuations of the hand pro- 
 ceed. Should it belong to that genus and prove a distinct species, I should 
 feel inclined to name it Cyathocrinites abbreviatus. 

2. The jielvis of a Platycrinites (fig. 4. and 5.) formed only of two plates, 
 presenting at their upper edge six excavations, and hence indicating the exist- 
 ence of six scapula;, from the Black Rock, near Bristol. I consider this as a 
 monstrous variety of Platycrinites laevis, analogous to those irregularities of 
 nature which occasionally render the column of the Pentacrini tetragonal and 
 hexagonal as noticed before, and which sometimes produce a six-fold division 
 of the pelvis in Encrinus moniliformis, as noticed by Rosinus, or a four-fold 
 one of Apiocrinites rotund us, of which I have seen a specimen in the posses- 
 sion of a friend. 

3. A column or auxiliary side arm (fig. 1. to 3.) of a Crinoidal animal, 
 formed of barrel-shaped joints externally tuberculated, articulating by striated 
 surfaces, and having in the centre a round nourishing vessel or alimentary ca- 
 nal. From some place in Germany, aiifl on a slab of Mountain limestone from 
 the river Swale in Yorkshire, having alongside of it fragments of Actinocri-
