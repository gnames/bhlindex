nites and of the column number 8, below. Mr. Parkinson represents a sin- 
 gle columnar joint of this Crinoid in his Org. Remains, Vol.ii. t. 13. fig. 69. 
 DoLiFOKMis would be a good specific name after ascertaining the genus to 
 which it belongs. 

4. Criiioidal column (fig. 10. and 11.) formed of moniliform joints alter- 
 nately larger and thicker, articulating by a striated rim, having a central round 
 alimentary canal. A few small auxiliary side arras proceed from the larger 
 joints. Locality unknown, apparently Mountain limestone. 

5. Portion of a crinoidal auxiliary side arm, (fig. 12. and 13) formed of 
 thin joints, articulating by a radiating rim, and in one instance a series of 
 them, each terminating in a tubercle on one end of the longest diameter. 
 From the Mountain limestone at the Mendip Hills. 

6. Portion of a crinoidal auxiliary side arm, (fig. 14. and 15.) whose joints 
 are of equal thickness, articulating to each other by striated surfaces. The 
 external circumference shows a series of tubercles surrounding each joint, and 
 several folds the vestiges of muscularity. From the Derbyshire Mountain 
 limestone, and also figured in Martin's Pet. Derb. t. 4. fig. 10. 

7. A nearly round, remarkably smooth, pentacrinal column, (fig. 7 and 8.) 
 formed of joints swelling out at their point of articulation to each other. This 
 might be easily mistaken for an auxiliary side arm of Actinocrinites, were it not 
 for thepentapetalous semi-striated articulation. I feel inclined to consider this 
 column as appertaining to a pentacrinite, claiming a specific distinction, and ) 
 should propose for its name Pentacri nites LjEvis. Locality unknown ; 
 probably lias. 

8. A crinoidal column, formed of moniliform joints, articulating by surfaces 
 striated near the circumference, (fig. 9.) I never saw the superior portion 
 of this crinite sufficiently perfect to display the pelvis and ])lates resting on it 
 A slab in the possession of Mr. R. Brioht, from the transition limestone on 
 his estate, near tbo Malvern Hills, shows some fingers of this species. Mr. 
 G. Hawker has also a specimen from Dudley, showing the column and 
 several fingers ; and Mr. C. Stokes has transmitted me the drawing of a nearly 
 similar specimen from the same place. From the analogy of these fingers to 
 those of Actinocrinites triaconta dactylus and some other characters, I feel
