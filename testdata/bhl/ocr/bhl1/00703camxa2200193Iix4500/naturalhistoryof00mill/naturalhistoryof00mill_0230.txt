inclined to consider it as belonging; to flmt genus, naming it Actinocrimtes 
 MONILIFORMIS^ fi'om the nioniliforui figuivofits columnar joints, which preserve 
 that shape throughout the column, although alternately larger and smaller near 
 the pelvis. It is a large species appertaining to the transition and perhaps 
 Mountain limestone, in which latter I have seen columns much resembling 
 these. It must be widely distributed, as I have seen its columns on slabs ol' 
 Mountain limestone from Swaledale, in Yorkshire, and on slabs of transition 
 lime from Foulhope, tlie Malvern Hills, Gliddenhill, Shelly Island, Lake 
 Huron, in Canada, and Melville Island, in the arctic regions. Mr. Parkinson, 
 who has seen the specimen in Mr. Hawker's collection, informs me that it is 
 illustrative of what he calls the Plumose Encrinite, and which was in Sir Ash- 
 ton Lever's collection. 

9. In the green sand formation, near Warminster, occur portions of a 
 Pentacrinite, (fig. 18.) with a rounded column, showing very little of the effects 
 of contraction in the interstices between the pentapetalous formations. These 
 columns display in some specimens an alternation of thicker and thinner joints, 
 and in others show a uniform thickness, the result of growth, as explained 
 before. At intervals larger joints arc interposed, marked externally by five 
 transverse oblong depressions, from which round auxiliary side arms proceed. 
 I consider this a distinct species, to which I would assign the name 
 Pentacrinus moniliformis, from the bead-like shape of the interposed large 
 joints. 

10. Very minute Crinoidal auxiliary side arms no thicker than a hair, 
 occur with retepora, &e. on slabs of Mountain limestone, from Mitchel Dean, 
 (fig. 19.) They are excessively small, show but obscure marks of organization, 
 and are changed into spar. One specimen is bent into a hook. 

11. I understand Mr. James Sowerby, has found Crinoidal remains in the 
 London clay at Highgate, which I have not seen, and hence am unable to speak 
 to their generic and specific identity. 

12. In the slaty gra5'-wacke where it comes in contact with the lower beds 
 of the transition limestone, occur the impressions of numerous organic re- 
 mains and Crinoidea, the substance of which has been decomi)0.sed and removed. 
 It is perhaps owing to a contraction or compression of this slaty formation, that 
 the Crinoidal impressions thus found have generally an elliptical form. Where
