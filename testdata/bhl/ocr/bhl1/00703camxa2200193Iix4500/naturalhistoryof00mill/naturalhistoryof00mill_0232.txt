an account of the encrinital remains in his collection, applying names to those 
 varieties which appeared to liim entitled to specific distinction. And although 
 he furnishes no anatomical details, yet his localities and synonymes are suf- 
 ficiently valuable to induce me to present the following extract from his work : 

He places the family, according toBujMENBACH's arrangement in the order 
 of Crustacea, (meaning by that term those radiated animals which have crus- 
 taceous plates, an application which cannot be admitted in our system, where 
 it has been appropriated to the crab tribe) forming of it two genera, Pentacrinus 
 and Encrinus. He observes in a note, that they do not belong to the 
 Zoophytes with which Lamauck has arranged them, but rather form a link 
 between the Crustacea and Zoophytes. In this I fully agree with him. 

1. Pentacrinites vulgaris. Is our p. caput medusa. The Baron gives

 the iWUSttelflOttjfealfeStet'n, our Has, in the environs of Waltershousen. The 
 Baron observes that the fossil resembles the recent species, and that he possesses 
 columnar fragments in flint, which I suspect is the variety mentioned by me

3. Pentacrinites excavatus. From the 91fl)0rpn0fenl!\0tfin, (tran-

T. 3. p. 336. t. 4. tig. 2. It is distinguished from all other species of Encrinites 
 by its plate-like concave joints, ornamented externally with a fine projecting 
 rim. The Baron further says that, according to verbal information, its upper 
 columnar joints articulate alternately with pentagonal ones, displaying star-like 
 markings. Yet he suspects that it is not a Pentacrinite, but Encrinite ; I
