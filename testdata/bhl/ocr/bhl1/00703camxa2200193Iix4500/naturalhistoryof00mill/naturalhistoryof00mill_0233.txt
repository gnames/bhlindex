should almost suspect it to belong to a species related to Cyathocrinites 
 quinquangularis. 

The Baron states that he is in possession of manj^ pentacrinal columnar 
 fragments which appear to appertain to other species, and conjectures that if 
 Knorr's Pentacrinite, p. 1. t, 11. c. (our P. subangularis) may be considered 
 distinct, the distinct species may at least amount to three. He confirms my 
 assertion in this monograph, that perfect specimens alone can be satisfactorily 
 referred to as furnishing correct characters of the column, which materially 
 dift'er near its summit. 

4. Encrinites ramosus. From the j^OfljlenltalfeStet'tl or cavern lime- 
 stone, not as yet precisely identified with any of the British strata, in the 
 environs of Gluecksbrunnen and Liebenstein, in Meiningen. His description, 
 which by no means tends to furnish a specific character, leads me to suspect 
 with the Baron, that the specimen described by him presents the summit of aa 
 encrinite, its hands and tentaculated fingers. 

5. Encrinites ramosus major. From Muggendorf, and the Canton Basel, 
 resembling the former, but larger. 

6. Encrinites echinatus. From the limestone at Basel ; in pebbles 
 penetrated by iron from Berrach, in Burgundy ; inhornstone from Aniberg. â€” 
 From his reference to Knorr, p. i. t. 26, (say 36.; fig. 8. 1 consider this to be a 
 variety of Rhodocrinites, somewhat analogous to the Mitchel Dean variety. 
 He further refers to Bourg, t. 58, fig. 413. and 417. 

7. Encrinites mespiliformis. From Gingen, and Heydenheim, in Suabia . 
 probably the jura formation. If I may judge from the figure (Pl. xxix. fig. 5.) 
 the BaroH furnishes, and which I have copied in my plate additionalCrinoidal 
 REMAINS, (fig. 17.) I must confess I discover but a very general similarity 
 between (he columnar joints of this species and the Bradford Encrinite, (our 
 Apiocrinites rotundus) of Mr. Parkinson, to whom he refers, V. n. t. 14. fig. 
 1 to 3 ; but I agree with the Baron in pronouncing it a distinct species, probably 
 not occurring in England.
