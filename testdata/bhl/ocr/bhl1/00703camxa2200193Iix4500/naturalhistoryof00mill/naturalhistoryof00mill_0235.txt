15, Encrinites Ephitonius. See page 13 of this monograph. The com- 
 mon screw stone or cast formed in the alimentary canal of the CrinoiHea, and 
 exposed by the decomposition of the column. Why the author should have 
 applied a specific name to the casts appears to me singular, since all the Cri- 
 noidea that have a round alimentary canal will form screw stones. 

Of all the above varieties, the Baron has specimens in his collection, but he 
 subjoins the following list of others, which, though not in his own museum, he 
 considers worthy of specific distinction: â€” 

1. Encrinites LORicATus. Our Actinocrinites triaconta dactylus, 

2. Encrinites testudinarius. Our Marsupites ornatus. 

3. Encrinites florealis, Parkinsons Org. Remains, vol. 2. t. 13. 
 fig. 86. and 37. an Echinite mistaken for an Encrinus, and found by me also in 
 the Mountain limestone of the Mendip Hills. Speeimens of it are also ia 
 R. Bright's, Esq. collection from Derbyshire. 

4. Encrinites tesseratus. V. Huepscb, t. 4. fig. 28. and 29, from the 
 Eiffel. 

5. Encrinites phytolites. V. Huepsch, t. 4. f^. 30. from Lothringen. 

6. Encrinites pictus. Bourg, t. 58. fig. 207. to 209. 

As the Baron gives no description of these, and as I have not seen the figures 
 to which he refers, I am unable to give my opinion on them.
