INTRODUCTION. 

ItIY inquiries into the anatomical details of the Crinoidea, necessarily con- 
 ducted me to the investigation of several other organic remains, hitherto con- 
 sidered as belonging to the Encrinites, and also to an examination of the animals 
 arranged by Linn^us in the genera Asteria and Echinus, since these appear ia- 
 some parts of their structure, more or less allied to the former. I was still further 
 animated to enter into the details of this investigation, since M. Cuvier asserts 
 in his Regne Animale (vol. iv. p. 8.) " that their bony arrangement deserves to 
 be studied ;" which made me conclude that this part of anatomy has been as 
 yet left vmtouched by that great naturalist. 

Of the Linnean genus Asteria, M. Lamarck has formed a family 
 to which he has assigned the name Stellerid^e, comprehending four genera, 
 arising from the subdivison of the above Linnean genus. With a view to dis- 
 cover the animals which form a link between the Crinoidea and Asteria, I 
 dissected several individuals of the family Stelieridas.
