ing through the auxiliary side arms, which vessel was perhaps surrounded by a 
 cuticle possessing the qualities of a nerve and muscle ; as appears very pro- 
 bable in an animal where the nerves must have been so minutely distributed. 

On examination of the conformation of the analogous parts in the StelleridsB, 
 it is at once proved. 

That in the genera Ophiura?* Asteria, andEnryale, the ossicula forming the 
 arms proceed from an ossicular arrangement surrounding the mouth, whereas 
 in the Crinoidea the system of joints supporting the arm proceed from the base 
 of the cup containing the intestines, and are only loosely connected with the 
 muscle surrounding the mouth, by the plated integument covering that cup. 

In the three genera mentioned, the mouth is pentagonal, and provided with^ 
 teeth, of which there are no traces in the Crinoidea. 

The following characters appear distinctive between the three abave stated 
 genera of the Stelleridse, but still not such as to approximate anj of them parti- 
 cularly to the Crinoidea : — 

In the genus Ophiura, the abdominal cavity extends beyond the mouth in 
 a subglobose manner. 

In the Asteria, the abdominal cavity extends laterally over the ossicular, 
 arrangement of the arms to admit ten coeca. 

In the Euryale, the protruding semiglobular abdominal cavity is formed by 
 ten plates, each two serving as a stay to an arm ; thus if the arms were removed, 
 these animals would exhibit by tliis arrangement of their plates in ten divisions, 
 and the teeth, a transition to the Echini. 

In the Ophiura ? Euryale, and Asteriae, there exists no perforation in the 
 arm joints, hence the vessel passing through it in the Crinoidea is omitted 
 or difibrently placed. 

The inner lateral angles of the arms of the Asteriae being provided with
