GENUS. COMATULA. 

An unattached aDimal, having a depressed orbicular body, formed of cal- 
 careous plates enclosing the viscera. The mouth in the centre (capable of 
 being elongated into a proboscis) surrounded by tentaculated arras or fingers 
 composed of numerous joints ; near the base of the body, below the fingers 
 or arms, many jointed auxiliary side arms terminating in a hooked point. 

Observation. 

M. Lamarck applies the name Comatula (derived from coma, a lock of hair, 
 in allusion to the resemblance the cluster of auxiliary side arms bear to it) as a 
 generic name, to a series of animals once incorporated in the Lin. Gen. Asteria. 
 Dr. Leach applies the name Alecto to the same series of animals, describing 
 three species in his Zoological Miscellanies. Yet as his character is inferior in 
 precision to that of Lamarck, as the name Alecto is, in its application by 
 Dr. Leach, simply equivalent to that of Comatula, as his generic character 
 does not exhibit any new division of the genus Comatula, and as it .seems 
 desirable to avoid the unnecessary multiplication of scientific nomenclature, I 
 have retained the latter. But as the characters given both by Dr. Leach and 
 Lamarck were drawn up from a comparison with the family Stelleridse, and do 
 not allude to those parts of its organization which mark the link between it 
 and the Crinoidea, I considered it necessary to furnish the above new generic 
 character. 

The Comatulae are not very numerous, but considerably distributed through 
 the various seas on our globe. 

At first sight the observer acquainted with the formation of Pentacrinus 
 Caput Medusae, Mill be slruck with the resemblance the Comatuiie bear to 
 the superior porlirÂ»n of that animal. The tentaculated fingers and auxiliary 
 side arms bear so striking a resemblance, that we are at first led to suspect that
