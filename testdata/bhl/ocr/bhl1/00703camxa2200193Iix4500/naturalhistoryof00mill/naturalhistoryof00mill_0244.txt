one of the least pleasures that an admirer of comparative ana(omy eiijoy;*, 
 when he finds that results which he acquired from one series of animals, will 
 apply also to those which most nearly approach them in the analogy of their 
 structure. The gradual increase of the plates or .joints of theCrinoidea inclos- 
 ing the abdominal cavity, took place by an extension at their lateral edges, to 
 afford the room required by the viscera in the growth of the animal. The pro- 
 ducing of auxiliary side arms, and reproducing of parts lost, demonstrate the 
 formation of their joints, by a gradual secretion of calcareous matter from the 
 involving muscular covering. These are facts which, since the Comatulaj are 
 so nearly in conformity in their general structure to the Crinoidea, ought also to 
 be demonstrable in their organization. 

The annular basin-shaped plate, which may be considered as the pelvis, 
 appears principally to increase towards its upper margin, as it is on this side 
 only that new auxiliary side arms can be traced as growing out of it, hence its 
 proportions become gradually deeper. This pelvis is (as has been already 
 observed) covered by numerous circular impressions, into which the side arms 
 are inserted ; these circular impressions are surrounded by hexagonal rims, the 
 result of an abundant secretion of calcareous matter from the muscular integu- 
 ment which surrounds and strengthens the adhesion of these side arms at their 
 base. The hexagonal form of these rims appears, as in many other instances, 
 to arise from the mutual pressure and accommodation of the contiguous circles 
 to each other. As this pelvis increases towards its upper edge, new arm joints 
 are there protruded. I have in my possession specimens in which near the 
 upper rim new cavities are formed, having in their centre minute, undeveloped, 
 auxiliary side arms, entirely similar to those of Pentacrinus caput medusaj, and 
 where also the claw-like termination has not yet made its appearance. 

The limited number of Comatulae which I have had an opportunity of 
 examining, have not enabled me to ascertain whether the perforation in the ridge 
 which traverses each indentation in the pelvis passes through into the abdominal 
 cavity, or whether the vessel arising from it branches off laterally, and obtains 
 its supplies from vessels under the epidermis which covers the plates 
 externally. 

Each of the five depressions at the upper rim of the pelvis is of a horse-shoe- 
 like figure, in which the first costal joint rests, to this the second costal joint 
 adheres, and on that a scapula is attached. The two Costals much resemble
