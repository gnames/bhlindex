Observation. 

Lamarck describes a small Comatula as C. fimbriata, found by M, Perron 
 and LE Sueur in the eastern seas, slating that it somewhat resembles the Stella 
 Barbata of Linkius, t. 37. No. 64. Pennant quotes the same figure for his 
 Asterias decacnemos, but in his representation (Pt. xxv.) does not express 
 the fimbriated membrane, nor does his figure show the organic detail correctly: 
 he also represents a pentagonal mouth which I could not detect in my dried 
 specimens ; hence I do not know how far those figures and quotations afford 
 synonymes or reference. 

A species of Comatula appears to occur in the Solenhofe slate, it has been 
 figured byKNORR (Pl.u. L. i.) and by vonScHLOTHEiinin his J^f tttfactf nllUnUf , 
 as Ophiurites penuatus, p. 28. (fig. 1. and 3.) but neither of these figures exhibit 
 that accurate attention to organic formation, which alone can enable us to 
 furnish a specific character.
