The Comatulae, as an approximating link, retaining the auxiliary side arms 
 observable in the Pentacrini, have them proceeding from the pelvis, and possess 
 no column. Yet these auxiliary side arms, the plated integument extending 
 over the abdominal cavity, having in its centre the mouth capable of elongation 
 into a proboscis, and the articulation and formation of the arm joints and ten- 
 tacula, indicate their retaining too great an affinity to the Crinoidea than to 
 render the transition to the Euryale satisfactory, and some intermediate link 
 seems still wanting. 

The Marsupite, by having no column, no auxiliary side arms, and retaining 
 the integument, appears to form the immediate link between the Crinoidea 
 inarticulata and the Euryale. 

Mr, Parkinson, although perhaps somewhat inconsistently, after including 
 the column in his generic character of the Encrinites and Pentacrinites, has yet 
 retained the Marsupite among them, and furnished a good figure and descrip- 
 tion of it, as the Tortoise Encrinite. 

Mr. Gideon Mantell, the author of a work on the Southdown fossils, 
 which will shortly appear before the public, has (from his vicinity to the chalk 
 pits of Brighton, where the Marsupite occurs) given its remains a due share of 
 attention. It being generally found deprived of arms, and without the plated 
 integument spreading over the space between the scapulas, (thereby dis- 
 playing the interior of the abdominal cavity) and in this mutilated state some- 
 what resembling a purse, induced Mr.MANXELL to give it the nameMarsupites, 
 from the Latin. I think this name so well chosen, that I have taken the liberty 
 to adopt it. 

I know of but one species belonging to this genus ; but it may be well to 
 observe that, on account of an imperfect anatomical investigation, Cyathocri- 
 nites rugosus, of the transition limestone, from a similarity of markings on the 
 plates and conformity of shape in the costals and scapula, has been considered 
 as a species belonging to this genus, although it is evident that this Cyathocri- 
 nite possessed a regular column, which the Marsupite never could have done ; 
 and that the arrangement and number of the plates is very different in that 
 Cyathocrinites and the Marsupite.
