of the delineations intended to illustrate his workj (which he obligingly lent 
 me) to draw up the following description : â€” 

The Central Plate* of the Marsupite may be considered as occupying a 
 similar situation to those plates which form the pelvis in theCrinoidea inarticu- 
 lata, since the other plates which cover the body of the animal are attached to 
 it in a regular series. But being single only, not perforated in the centre, and 
 having no concave impression at its exterior surface, we discover at once a 
 striking dissimilarity, which points out that there existed no passage through 
 the plate to an alimentary canal beyond it, and that consequently no columnar 
 joint could have been attached to it ; an inference which is confirmed by 
 observing that the lower surface of this plate exhibits no mark of adhesion for 
 a column. Jt is of a pentagonal form, somewhat elevated in its middle, 
 marked at the exterior surface with subcrenulated ridges, arranged like those 
 of Cyathocrinites rugosns, as described page 90. 

Five Pkntagonal Costal Plates adhere to the lateral edges of the 
 central plate, and are marked externally like it. 

In the superior angles formed by the costal plates, are admitted five 
 hexagonal Intercostals, also marked like the latter ; these, however, have 
 in addition to the former markings, four conspicuous ridges radiating from the 
 centre to the two lateral edges(which serve for the more firm adhesion of the inter- 
 costals to each other) and to the superior margins (where the pentagonal scapidae 
 adhere) over which they extend to the horse-shoe-like impression at their 
 summit. 

The radiating subcrenulated ridges on the plates, the folds just noticed, 
 and the lateral adhesion of plate to plate by simple sutures, plainly indicate 
 that a muscular integument extended over these calcareous plate-like con- 
 cretions ; that this muscular integument was capable ot contraction, and has 
 left the ridges and folds above described as marks of its action, and corre- 
 sponding with the appearances before observed in the Crinoidea, especially in 
 Actinocrinites and Cyathocrinites, 

* I am now doubtful, however, whedier it might not be prefercible to consider this plate as 
 analogous to the U|i|)er columnar joint oi the Crinoidea, the next series as the pelvis, &c. in 
 the manner proposed in the end ol'this article ; but the letters of reference employed in the plate 
 rendered it necessary to retain the above desci iption also,
