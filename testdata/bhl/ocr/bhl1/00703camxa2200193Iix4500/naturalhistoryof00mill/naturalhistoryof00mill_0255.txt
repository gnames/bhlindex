Cyathocrinites, which I hesitated to point out before I had proved the non- 
 existence of the column in Marsupites. If we consider the lower pentangular 
 plate in this genus (which is similar in position to that in Comatula) to serve 
 in both as a keystone to their vaulted cup, or as a plate performing in part the 
 office of a first columnar joint, (since the other plates adhere to its edges) and 
 thus apply the anatomical nomenclature used when describing the Cyatho- 
 crinites, we shall find the five plates forming the pelvis in that genus truly 
 conformable to the five costals in Marsupites, differing only in their upper 
 edges being bent, to form as its were a concave rim, and the lower surface 
 being excavated to give articulation to the column. The five intercostal plates 
 in Marsupites correspond in figure and marking with flie five costals in 
 Cyathocrinites, and the scapula, integument, and commencement of the arms 
 exhibit a conformity conspicuous at first sight. It is truly pleasing by 
 this change of anatomical momenclature, to point out in a more striking 
 manner the method in which nature effects the transition from one being to 
 another. In the Comatula, the absence of the column showed the first link 
 from the Crinoidea articulata to the Stelleridae, in the Marsupite a similar link 
 is offered from the Crinoidea inarticulata to that family.
