Figure 2. represints a fine specimen in my possession. I have indicated the probable 
 form of the fingers by dotted lines, having only seen portions of them, but none tiiat 
 could furnisi) full information of their complete outline. I have indeed seen finders made 
 up by gluing together finger joints found at various distances from each other in the 
 Bradford clay, and arranged in a decreasing order ; but as iu the Criuoidea each fin-^er- 
 joint is not distinguished by an essential character as in those of Mammalia, such a 
 representation may prove only deceptive.
