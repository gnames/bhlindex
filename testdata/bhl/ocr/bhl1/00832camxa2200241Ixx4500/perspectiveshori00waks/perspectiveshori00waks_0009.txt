Preface 

Microbiology has made great strides in the 
 last eight or nine decades. Beginning with studies of micro- 
 organisms as causative agents of disease and fermentation, 
 their occurrence in soil and other natural substrates, and 
 life cycles of certain groups of bacteria and fungi, micro- 
 biology has grown into a broad science with numerous 
 theoretical and practical applications. This is true of 
 ecology and taxonomy of microorganisms, physiology and 
 biochemistry, genetics and cytology, and applications to 
 virtually every aspect of human endeavor. 

This symposium, arranged in connection with the ded- 
 ication on June 7, 1954, of the Institute of Microbiology, 
 Rutgers University, presents an attempt to analyze the 
 present and possibly some of the future aspects of micro 
 biology. Who would have thought, in the days of Pasteur 
 and Koch, of such problems as "metabolic models" and 
 "metabolic pathways," of "vitamins" and "antibiotics," of 
 "genetics of microorganisms" and "biochemical muta- 
 tions," of "viruses," and of "steroid transformations," let 
 alone such specialized subjects as "metapoietic integra- 
 tions"? By presenting a broad outline of these and other
