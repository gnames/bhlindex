phases of microbiology, this symposium on the Perspectives 
 and Horizons in Microbiology deals with the many-sided 
 aspects of a science devoted to the study of the microscopic 
 forms of life and their relation to mankind. 

The numerous applications of the activities of micro- 
 organisms have, for the most part, been omitted from this 
 symposium. They are definitely suggested, however, in 
 their relation to human and animal health, in the problems 
 dealing with viruses and immunological reactions, in the 
 discussion of soil processes and plant growth, and in the 
 outline of nitrogen-fixation and the effects of microbes on 
 plant life. The inclusion of a chapter on antibiotics tends 
 to give emphasis to a new field of microbiology that has 
 made great progress during the last fifteen years. The prob- 
 lems of disease control are suggested in the extensive ap- 
 plications of this advancing science. 

Because of their historical interest, three general ad- 
 dresses delivered at the dedication of the Institute are in- 
 cluded as an appendix. 

It is the sincere hope of those who organized this sym- 
 posium that it will serve as a milestone in the history of a 
 science that deals with the smallest of living things and 
 with their importance in the cycle of life in nature and 
 especially in the life of man.
