4 Perspectives in Microbiology 

mental aspects of life. Occasionally they could reiterate 
 their hope that some day the neglected opportunities would 
 attract others to the larger field; meanwhile they continued 
 their work, assured by a long-range point of view and by 
 the fascination of the subject itself. 

But during the last fifteen years a marked change has 
 taken place. The number of publications concerned with 
 microorganisms from other than medical points of view 
 has increased enormously, and several new journals have 
 been started to accommodate the swollen current of reports 
 dealing with biochemical studies in which microbes have 
 played a part. One of the chief reasons for this develop- 
 ment has been the influence exerted by A. J. Kluyver's 
 masterly synthesis of the information on the vast diversity 
 of metabolic processes carried out by the numerous types 
 of microorganisms. This synthesis revealed that all bio- 
 chemical events can be interpreted as composites of more 
 or less extended series of step reactions, each step chemi- 
 cally intelligible and representing a special case of simple 
 electron transfer between two different molecules, medi- 
 ated by a specific enzyme. Depending upon the nature of 
 the participating reactants, this leads to the transfer of 
 atoms or larger units from one molecule to another, as in 
 transhydrogenations, transphosphorylations, transamina- 
 tions, transmethylations, transacetylations, and transglu- 
 cosidations. 

While emphasizing the fundamental unity in the bio- 
 chemical behavior of all living beings, Kluyver's contribu- 
 tions also drew attention to the existence among micro- 
 organisms of extreme cases of biochemical specialization 
 and of processes that may be characterized as grossly 
 exaggerated examples of phenomena that are encountered 
 elsewhere as quantitatively minor side reactions. That 
 organisms which display such properties are signifi- 
 cant for more detailed investigations on the particular 
 reaction mechanisms involved was clearly appreciated.
