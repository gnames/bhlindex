The Microbe as a Whole 5 

This concept gave rise to that of "comparative biochem- 
 istry," and so broadened the range of useful potentialities 
 of microbes for biochemical studies that it is not surprising 
 to find, in the course of fifteen years, that biochemists in- 
 terested in fundamental problems became increasingly 
 aware of the advantages offered by Leeuwenhoek's "little 
 animals." Furthermore, the gradual realization that growth 
 factors for yeasts and bacteria bear a close relationship to 
 vitamins required by higher animals soon led to the use 
 of microorganisms for the assay of vitamins and amino acids 
 and for the detection and identification of as yet unknown 
 growth factors. The subsequent proof that several of these 
 substances participate in biochemical processes as co- 
 enzymes or building blocks for coenzyme synthesis, a con- 
 cept first advanced in 1933 by Lwoff in connection with 
 studies on the role of hemoglobin in the nutrition of 
 trypanosomes, increased the usefulness of the microbes still 
 more, especially in view of their high rate of growth and 
 the possibility of controlling the material by the use of 
 pure cultures and chemically defined media. The microbes 
 thus became the material par excellence for studies of 
 special nutritional problems and of enzyme systems. And 
 when at last methods were perfected for the extraction of 
 enzymes from bacteria, yeasts, molds, and other microbes — 
 through preliminary drying, disruption of the cells by 
 grinding, shaking with glass beads, supersonic oscillations, 
 or enzymatic dissolution of the cell walls — our understand- 
 ing of the details of biochemical reaction mechanisms 
 through the use of microorganisms advanced rapidly. 

Unquestionably, biochemistry has profited greatly from 
 these developments. Nevertheless, the microbiologist re- 
 ceiving a request for a pure culture of some bacterium, 
 yeast, or alga, and for directions for growing it, from a bio- 
 chemist who wishes to use it for a specific biochemical 
 investigation cannot always escape the conclusion that the 
 culture in question will be considered as little more than a
