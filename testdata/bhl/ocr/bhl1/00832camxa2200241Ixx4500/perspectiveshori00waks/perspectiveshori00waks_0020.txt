6 Perspectives in Microbiology 

potential enzyme preparation. And just as the chemist will 
 feel uneasy when a special analytical procedure or method 
 for synthesizing a chemical compound is used by a person 
 with little experience and no more than a rudimentary 
 knowledge of chemistry, unaware of the rationale of the 
 operations and of the possible pitfalls in interpretation, 
 so the microbiologist is likely to be somewhat apprehen- 
 sive when his material is treated as a chemical reagent, 
 rather than as a mass of living organisms with their own 
 peculiarities and responses to environmental conditions 
 that have to be appreciated for the culture to be used to 
 best advantage. These are aspects that can be learned, and 
 it is comforting to know that many biochemists nowadays 
 are anxious to acquire a sound training not only in bio- 
 chemistry, but in the general principles of microbiology 
 as well. 

Even so, one might argue with considerable justification 
 that there is now developing a strong tendency to equate 
 "general" microbiology, as contrasted to "medical" micro- 
 biology, with biochemistry and to consider a study of 
 microorganisms as truly significant only if it is directed 
 towards biochemical investigations. I consider such a 
 tendency regrettable; however, this statement should not 
 be misconstrued to mean that I have little or no interest in 
 biochemical problems, or that I would advocate that the use 
 of microorganisms for biochemical studies be henceforth 
 curtailed. Not only would such an attitude be futile; it 
 would also be unscientific. The biochemist should not be 
 satisfied with our present level of understanding of bio- 
 chemical phenomena. He must obviously realize that many 
 types of reactions have not yet been analyzed with respect 
 to the nature of the enzymes involved. He must know that 
 the interpretation of enzyme specificity on the basis of the 
 general idea that it is related to the molecular configuration 
 of protein molecules leaves much to be desired and that a 
 satisfactory account of the specificity problem requires a
