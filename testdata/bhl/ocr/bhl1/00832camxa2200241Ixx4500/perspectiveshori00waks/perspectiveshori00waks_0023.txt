The Microbe as a Whole 9 

posed of a cell wall, cytoplasmic membrane, cytoplasm, and 
 nucleus constitute a sound basis for considering bacterial 
 cells on a par with the cells of higher organisms. Of great 
 promise also are the current investigations on cytological 
 aspects, such as the discovery by WeibuU that Bacillus 
 megaterium, stripped of its cell wall, retains its organiza- 
 tion inside the membrane under appropriate conditions, 
 as well as many of its metabolic properties, although at- 
 tempts to grow such incomplete cells have so far failed. 
 In this connection a comparison with bacteria like the 
 cytophagas, which presumably do not form a cell wall and 
 yet can grow and divide normally, suggests itself as an 
 interesting problem. 

Similarly, the finding that the cytochromes of some bac- 
 terial cells are intimately associated with the cytoplasmic 
 membrane, and that the pigments of the blue-green algae 
 and photosynthetic bacteria are not, as previously believed, 
 uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm but assembled in 
 chromatophore-like structures, gives evidence of enzymatic 
 organization. It may be expected that further studies of 
 this sort will rapidly advance our knowledge. 

The isolation of bacterial flagella, with the subsequent 
 elucidation of their chemical nature as proteins of the 
 myosin group, holds out hope for a better understanding 
 of the mechanism that causes these "monomolecular hairs" 
 to function as organs of locomotion. Besides, the recent 
 work of Clayton shows that phototaxis of purple bacteria 
 displays the typical characteristics of sensory perception, 
 viz., the all-or-none response, accommodation, and refrac- 
 tory period, and that the concepts and equations developed 
 by A. V. Hill and Rashevski to account for sensory stimu- 
 lation are equally satisfactory as formal expressions of 
 phototactic behavior. 

This suggests that flagellar movements are under the 
 control of mechanisms analogous to those operative in 
 sensory perception in general, and that further studies on
