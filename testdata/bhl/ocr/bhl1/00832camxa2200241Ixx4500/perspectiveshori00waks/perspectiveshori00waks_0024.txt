10 Perspecfives in Microbiology 

tactic movements of microorganisms might help in analyz- 
 ing certain aspects of stimulus conduction by nerves. 

In connection with microbial locomotion, I cannot re- 
 frain from mentioning the problem posed by the existence 
 of Salmonella strains with nonfunctional flagella; the still 
 unsolved mechanisms responsible for the movements of 
 microorganisms devoid of flagella, like the desmids, blue- 
 green algae, myxobacteria, and Labyrinthula; and the 
 phenomena known as elasticotaxis and elasticotropism, en- 
 countered in organisms with gliding motility and in 
 Kurthia zopfii, representing responses to gradients in stress 
 of the substrate, similar to that exhibited by growing nerve 
 cells. 

It is obviously impossible to predict where future studies 
 of such phenomena may lead. But I believe that in the 
 end science would benefit if the tentative and often un- 
 rewarding probings into the behavior of microorganisms 
 on a level now beyond the scope of biochemical and bio- 
 physical experimentation were not merely tolerated but 
 encouraged. The tendency to look down on the efforts of 
 microbiologists who do not follow the current trends, and 
 to brand such studies as rather primitive dabblings in the 
 natural history of microorganisms, seems to me short- 
 sighted. It would be well to realize that the important 
 developments in microbial biochemistry and genetics, for 
 example, have resulted from the emergence of novel con- 
 cepts that may be compared to a "break-through" in a 
 deadlocked military front. The successful exploitation of 
 such concepts is accomplished by the concerted efforts of 
 many specialists, and the opportunity for doing so is gen- 
 erally recognized at an early stage. One cannot anticipate, 
 however, when or where a new break-through may take 
 place. It usually is preceded by the accumulation of numer- 
 ous seemingly trivial observations which gradually arrange 
 themselves, in the mind of an alert scientist long preoccu-
