12 Perspectives in Microbiology 

microbes in nature under such conditions, and argued 
 convincingly that pure culture studies may reveal char- 
 acteristics that can express themselves only in the absence 
 of potential competitors. The recent discoveries concern- 
 ing microbial variability and genetics also tend to discredit 
 the once almost unlimited confidence in results obtained 
 with pure cultures, because it is becoming increasingly 
 evident that even populations derived from single cell 
 isolates are anything but homogeneous. This discovery 
 may have some disturbing implications, but it should be 
 recognized that the appearance of variants in pure cultures 
 can be used to study the mechanism of competition between 
 different individuals in a clone, and thus may lead to an 
 analysis of the factors that determine the perpetuation of 
 specific properties. This, in turn, would provide important 
 information for investigation in the general field of ecology. 
 It cannot be doubted that in the new Rutgers Institute 
 of Microbiology the search for new antibiotics will be 
 continued. In view of the extensive theoretical and prac- 
 tical background built up by Waksman during the last 
 fifteen years, it may also be confidently expected that im- 
 portant advances will be made. But I hope that there will 
 also be room for some of those who prefer to spend their 
 time and efforts in examining properties of the microbes 
 that have as yet eluded a more penetrating study. This will 
 require probing into manifestations pertaining to regions 
 of complexity which, at present, are but little understood, 
 and may involve many kinds of observations before a sig- 
 nificant pattern begins to emerge. Nevertheless, it is only 
 when all the aspects of microbial behavior can be taken 
 into account that we shall be in a position to think in 
 terms of ''the microbe as a whole."
