Some Aspects of 
 Metapoietic Integrations 

By ANDRE LWOFF 

Microbes are able to undergo a variety of 
 inheritable changes: gene mutations, loss of plasmagenes 
 endowed with genetic continuity, transformations, or trans- 
 ductions. As a result, the microbe is temporarily or perma- 
 nently modified. It has lost or acquired the ability to syn- 
 thesize or to metabolize one or many substances. And in 
 some cases the change has been shown to be related to the 
 loss or the acquisition of the power to synthesize a specific 
 enzyme. 

These variations may be considered as consequences of 
 the modification of "normal" metabolism. In some cases, 
 however, a hereditary pathological property may be im- 
 posed on the microbe; namely, the power to produce bac- 
 teriophage or lysogeny. 

As is well known, a lysogenic bacterium is endowed with 
 the hereditary power to produce bacteriophage. This prop- 
 erty is bound to the presence of a specific particle: the
