the phage nor that of the bacterium is responsible for the 
 defectivity. The most likely hypothesis is that defectivity 
 is correlated with an abnormal anchorage of the genetic 
 material of the phage on the bacterial chromosome. De- 
 fectivity is frequently observed in Pseudomonas pyocyanea. 
 Let us infect an apparently homogenous population of 
 bacteria with an apparently homogenous population of 
 bacteriophage and isolate lysogenic clones. The fraction 
 of bacteria able to produce phage varies with the clones 
 from 1 to 10-*. Here also, the defective as well as the 
 normal lysogenics produce the same type of phage. And 
 again, the simplest hypothesis is that normality or defec- 
 tivity is the consequence of the mode of attachment of the 
 genetic material of the phage to the bacterial chromosome. 
 It would, nevertheless, be dangerous to generalize from 
 this hypothetical conclusion. The lysogenic B. megaterium 
 10 [3] is defective. The strains M and Mox, when lyso- 
 genized with phage 3, give rise exclusively to defective 
 strains. Here defectivity is controlled by the genetic con- 
 stitution of the phage. The most general expression of 
 these hypotheses would be that normality and defectivity 
 are controlled by the genetic constitution of the phage as 
 modified in its expression by bacterial genes. Here again, 
 the character normality-defectivity is, in the last analysis, 
 controlled by the genetic constitution of the system as a 
 whole. 

Immunify and Dysgonia 

We have considered so far such properties of the lyso- 
 genic systems as are connected with the development and 
 maturation of bacteriophage from prophage. It is well 
 known, however, that prophage not only confers on the 
 bacterium the power to produce bacteriophage, but also 
 endows it with a specific immunity. The "homologous" 
 phage, the phage corresponding to the prophage, as well
