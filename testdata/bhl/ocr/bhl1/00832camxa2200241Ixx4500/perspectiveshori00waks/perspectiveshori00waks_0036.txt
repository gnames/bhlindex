t The status of this strain is not yet dear. Types 1 and 2 have been 
 isolated after exposure of C. diphtheriae (y) to phage (3. 

which may be associated with a structure conferring im- 
 munity against phage y- 

Here, the presence of a prophage of a given genetic con- 
 stitution modifies the bacterium in such a way that it pro- 
 duces toxin when deprived of iron. 

In other cases, the presence of a prophage modifies tlie 
 metabolism of the microbe so that the morphology of the 
 colony is altered. In B. megaterium, the colony type is 
 changed by lysogenization with phages IPT and 3, not 
 with phages IGC and 2. The morphology reverts to the 
 normal when the prophage is lost (5). In this case, as in 
 the case of Corynebacterium diphtheriae, the hypothesis of 
 a selection by the phage of a preexisting bacterial mutant 
 has been ruled out. The new bacterial feature is due to 
 the presence of prophage and disappears when the pro- 
 phage disappears.

A cell is an organized totality. The importance of the 
 interrelations and interactions of cell particles and organ- 
 elles has long been recognized, and the life and reproduc- 
 tion of a cell are often visualized as the result of integra- 
 tions at various levels of organization.
