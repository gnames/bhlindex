Mefapoiefic Integrations 23 

Obviously, the properties of lysogenic systems which are 
 bound to the prophage are the result of interaction of 
 the genetic material of the phage and of the bacterium. 
 Many hypotheses can be considered to account for the 
 alterations of the bacterial metabolism that are the result 
 of lysogenization. It could be that the prophage modifies 
 the bacterial genes adjacent to the locus of attachment. 
 It could also be that some of the prophage genes actively 
 intervene in a specific process, such as the synthesis of a 
 protein or of a part of a protein. We are unfortunately, for 
 the time being, left with hypotheses. Whatever the solu- 
 tion — or solutions — of the problem may be, it is possible 
 to conclude that the genetic material of the bacteriophage, 
 when attached as prophage to a bacterial chromosome, is 
 not solely a potential bacteriophage. The prophage takes 
 part in the daily life of the bacterium as if it were a cog 
 in the bacterial machinery. It plays its part in the molecular 
 orchestra. 

Thus, the structural basis of a viral disease and the bac- 
 terium may be integrated. Some of these integrations have 
 been recognized as metapoietic. 

It is certain that many more examples of such integra- 
 tion will be brought to light. The mechanism of the 
 phenomenon will have to be disclosed.
