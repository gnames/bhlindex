Genetics and Microbiology' 

By JOSHUA LEDERBERG 

"To the biologist of the 19th century, bac- 
 teria appeared as the most primitive expression of cellular 
 organization, the very limit of life. In reality it appears 
 that it is only their small size and the absence of recognized 
 sexual reproduction which has given the illusion that 
 bacteria are simple cells." Thus Dubos (11) introduced an 
 outstanding synthesis of the structural and biochemical 
 complexity of the microbe as a living system. But in an- 
 other realm, he (12) could not repress a nostalgia for primi- 
 tive simplicity: "Bacterial variation passes from the col- 
 lector's box of the naturalist to the sophisticated atmos- 
 phere of the biochemical laboratory. One may wonder 
 whether the geneticist will not arrive too late to introduce 
 his jargon into bacteriology."
