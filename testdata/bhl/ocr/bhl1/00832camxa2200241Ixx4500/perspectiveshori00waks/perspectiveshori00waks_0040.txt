by Mendelian and populational analysis elsewhere. To be 
 sure, such pioneers as Massini, Beijerinck, and Barber did 
 distinguish fluctuating or impressed variations, which are 
 reversible physiological responses to the environment, from 
 fixed mutations representing innate genetic alterations. 
 Bacterial mutations are reversible, however, in the same 
 sporadic fashion as the primary events; reversion is no less 
 characteristic of other organisms, but this was overlooked 
 in support of cyclogenic or more obscure special theories 
 of bacterial dissociation (18). The confusion was com- 
 pounded by the tremendous size of bacterial populations 
 and the aggressiveness with which bacterial mutations and 
 reverse mutations often present themselves (6, 33). 

These features were put to good use in a renewal of 
 exact study by a biometric approach in the 1940's, cul- 
 minating in the analysis of clonal variance of mutations to 
 phage resistance by Luria and Delbriick (34). The out- 
 standing qualitative result of these experiments was statis- 
 tical proof of the uncontrollability, if not the absence, of 
 purposive regulation of adaptive mutations, such as re- 
 sistance to phage or to streptomycin. The statistical pro- 
 cedures have since been expanded for the calculation of 
 mutation rates and for more detailed analysis of spon- 
 taneous mutation (2, 38). But population dynamics is so 
 complex (7) that foreseeable progress here may consist of 
 balancing the complications omitted from the approxi- 
 mate calculations against the imprecisions of measurement. 
 The clonal variance that is the keystone of the qualitative 
 argument for preadaptive mutation also requires tedious 
 repetition to measure mutation rates with a scarcely ac- 
 ceptable precision of Â±: 50 per cent (34, 38, 42). Ordinary 
 cultural methods also entail an ever-changing chemical 
 environment (7) in addition to an inexhaustible reservoir 
 of systematic as well as sampling errors (26). 

Novick and Szilard (39) have resolved these obstacles 
 by means of a simply engineered continuous-flow device,
