tion of various bacterial genes. Not only a rise in tempera- 
 ture, but also such metabolic variables as tryptophane 
 deficiency or adenine excess accentuate the mutation rate 
 (40). Perhaps the most provocative finding was that ribo- 
 nucleosides would not merely reverse the effect of excess 
 adenine but would reduce the "spontaneous" rate by half 
 (39). Biophysicists once speculated, and then rejected, 
 cosmic radiation; we now observe that the causation of 
 spontaneous mutation is a problem incidental to inter- 
 mediary metabolism. 

This conclusion converges with the explicit study, 
 largely with microorganisms, of mutations induced by ion- 
 izing radiations and chemical reagents. "Induced" may be 
 as misleading as "spontaneous"; it implies contrived in- 
 crease of the over-all mutation rate, in a sense, an aug- 
 mentation of "spontaneous" change. Between 1928 and 
 1940, the only accepted mutagen was radiant energy, many 
 chemicals having been inconclusively or at least uncon- 
 vincingly tested (3, 36). But starting with the war gases, 
 and now including such domestic articles as hydrogen per- 
 oxide, formaldehyde, soporific drugs, and caffeine, so ex- 
 tensive a catalog has been shown potent (3, 10) that one 
 wonders what, besides rigidity of concept, can have hin- 
 dered the germination of chemical mutagenesis for so long. 
 Now, from a free interchange of results concerning micro- 
 organisms and macroorganisms, ionizing radiations also 
 are inferred to work through chemical intermediaries: 
 free radicals from oxygen and water (45). And, first with 
 Streptomyces (22), then ^vith other organisms, the dysgenic 
 effects of ultraviolet have been found reversible by visible 
 light, suggesting an obscure photochemical intermediation. 

Mutagens have, of course, helped to furnish variants, the 
 raw material for other experiments. But, particularly in 
 industrial applications, there has been exaggerated empha- 
 sis on the technology of provoking genetic variation (which
