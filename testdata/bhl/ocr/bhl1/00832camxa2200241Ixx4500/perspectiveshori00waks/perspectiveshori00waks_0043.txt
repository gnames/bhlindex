is relentless anyhow) at the expense of thoughtful search 
 for procedures to detect and electively enrich the variants 
 that serve some specific purpose, an approach we have in- 
 herited in large part from the Delft school of microbiology. 
 Some helpful methods have been developed (32) for the 
 isolation of the biochemical variants that Davis has so 
 skillfully exploited. 

Genefic RecombJnafion 

All this bears more heavily on the general utility of 
 microorganisms in genetic research than on the genetics 
 of particular microbes. Once given that microbes are dif- 
 ferentiated into more than the rhetorical "bag of enzymes," 
 as already proved by mutation research, we must look 
 more deeply into the organization of different microbes, 
 and for this, genetic recombination is the most versatile 
 tool now at hand. After all, most experimentation consists 
 of putting together two reactants and waiting to see what 
 happens. Synthetic chemical reagents are too crudely de- 
 signed for us to tell very much about their ultimate effect 
 on genetic configuration, and we therefore seek the means 
 of combining the biological units themselves. Later, if we 
 can keep busy, patient, careful, and lucky, we may hope 
 to build genetic theories on cytological facts, but the pres- 
 ent foundation of unarguable correlations is still unsteady, 
 perhaps owing to technical difficulties as much as to the 
 unavoidable subjectivity of cytological conviction. If they 
 are cells, bacteria do have organized nuclei and some 
 approximation to mitosis, but we lack the very criteria 
 of proof on which we can readily judge current contro- 
 versies on particular manifestations of these forms. 

Genetic recombination includes any process of the co- 
 alescence within one cell or organism of genetic factors 
 from two or more parents. Its best known manifestation
