30 Perspectives in Microbiology 

is sexual fertilization: a union of an entire gamete nucleus 
 from each parent to form the hybrid, zygote nucleus. There 
 are, of course, innumerable secondary physical and psychic 
 paraphernalia to support the act of fusion, but this and 
 not the accessories is the essence of sex for genetic pur- 
 poses. Sex occurs universally among higher plants and ani- 
 mals and is nearly as prevalent among protozoa and fungi, 
 but, with sporadic exceptions, has been reported absent 
 from the bacteria. 

Among lower plants, we also discern another mode of 
 recombination — heterokaryosis — in which the interaction 
 of intact nuclei falls short of fusion. Instead, diverse nuclei 
 multiply sui generis in a common cytoplasmic pool, where 
 their functional contributions are so intermingled as to 
 simulate hybridity. By sporulation, accident, or surgery, 
 however, the nuclei of the heterokaryon may be segregated 
 to reveal their lasting integrity. In the higher fungi, a 
 binary heterokaryon is a regular feature of the life cycle, 
 is maintained by conjugate mitosis, and may be ultimately 
 terminated by sexual fusion, whereas in the ascomycetes 
 and the phycomycetes, the nuclei of heterokaryons multi- 
 ply independently. A similar type of heterokaryosis almost 
 certainly occurs in actinomycetes (27); among nonfilamen- 
 tous bacteria it could only be transitory, but cannot be 
 ignored in the momentary control of phenotypes in muta- 
 tion and recombination procedures. 

By 1945, morphological approaches to the question of 
 bacterial sexuality had raised so many vexatious contro- 
 versies that, to quote Dubos' book (11) again: "If bacteria 
 do really reproduce by sexual methods, it should be possi- 
 ble to cross closely related species and strains . . . most 
 workers who have attempted to cross related strains have 
 reported only failure." 

Hindsight suggests that the chief omission of previous 
 experiments (14, 43) was a set of clear-cut, unit markers in 
 a selective system that would allow the detection of in-
