an example of fragmentary genetic transfer, that is, trans- 
 duction. Meanwhile, the chemical analyses by Avery and 
 his colleagues described the reagent in the vaccines as 
 principally, if not exclusively, desoxyribonucleic acid, 
 DNA (4). The genetic aspects of the transmitted fragment 
 have not been fully clarified, but in each of the several 
 examples of transduction, single genetic factors are the 
 rule, punctuated by occasional "linked transduction" of 
 two factors (20, 31, 44). As the number of factors examined 
 increases, so does the incidence of recognized linkages. 
 This suggests that the unit is a chromosome fragment, 
 rather than an absolutely delimited macromolecule, the 
 idealized "single gene." 

Transduction in at least two other bacteria. Hemophilus 
 and Neisseria^, was discovered by conscious emulation of 
 the Griffith and Avery procedures, and with some ad- 
 vantageous peculiarities, its general aspects are the same 
 as in the pneumococcus (31). In Salmonella^ on the other 
 hand, transduction was accidentally discovered in the 
 course of a fruitless search for sexuality as it occurs in E. 
 coli. In fact, too rigid insistence on the use of double 
 mutants to control the selection of recombinants nearly 
 obscured the initial discovery (49), but this emphasizes 
 the difference in mechanism. Transduction in Salmonella 
 differs from that in the pneumococcus primarily in the 
 function of temperate bacteriophage as the passive vector 
 of the hereditary fragments. 

To recapitulate, genetic transduction as much as sexual 
 fertilization is an agency of recombination but differs in 
 two principal features: morphologically, one reactant is a 
 subcellular fragment, and genetically, perhaps as a corol- 
 lary, a small fragment rather than the entire genotype is 
 all that is transmitted. In several bacteria, the fragment 
 may be transmissible after chemical extraction in essen- 
 tially native form, possibly pure DNA, but in Salmonella 
 a symbiotic phage effects the initial fragmentation of the
