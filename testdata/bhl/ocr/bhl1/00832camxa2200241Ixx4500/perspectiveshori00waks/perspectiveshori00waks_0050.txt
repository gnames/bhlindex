36 Perspecf'ives in Microbiology 

zation of the prophage, which had been thought a likely 
 inhabitant of the cytoplasm. 

Recombination also gives logistic support to other ex- 
 perimentation, for example, in biochemistry or immu- 
 nology, by allowing the rational construction of prespeci- 
 fied combinations of genetic factors. The potential of 
 recombination methods in applied microbiology should 
 be so obvious as to obviate comment but has generally 
 been overlooked in favor of more routine screening 
 methods. 

Finally, but not exhaustively, the very occurrence of 
 recombination illuminates both taxonomy and evolution, 
 for example, in rationalizing the otherwise unintelligible 
 list of serological types of Salmonella (29). These find- 
 ings, in turn, may reopen the question of how much reli- 
 ance should be placed on serological typing of Salmonella 
 as a clinical rather than an epidemiological tool. Although 
 distinctions between serotypes are entrenched in the public 
 health laws of many states, supposedly innocuous serotypes 
 such as S. typhimuriiim are too often ignorant of the legal 
 definitions of paratyphoid fever. 

To offer seriously any prescription for the future of 
 science would require a calculated blend of presumption 
 and inattention to history. If such predictions were ac- 
 curate, we would be disappointed, for they are the measure 
 of the bounds of current thought that we hope to over- 
 reach. The perspectives of current microbiological science 
 might be mistaken for prophecy; but the wisest prophet 
 would look beyond the visible horizon for the questions 
 we are not yet ready to ask.
