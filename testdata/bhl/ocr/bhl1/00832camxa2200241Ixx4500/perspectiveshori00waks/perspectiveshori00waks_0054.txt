Nutritional and Enzymatic 
 Studies on Microbial Mutants 

By BERNARD D. DAVIS 

Some fifteen years ago, Beadle and Tatum 
 initiated the systematic investigation of auxotrophic mu- 
 tants of a microorganism. Nutritional studies on such 
 mutants indicated that each was blocked in a single bio- 
 synthetic reaction, presumably because it had lost the 
 ability to synthesize the enzyme that catalyzed the reaction. 
 On the genetic side, these results gave rise to the famous 
 one-gene-one-enzyme hypothesis, which proposed that each 
 gene provides information that determines the structural 
 specificity of a corresponding enzyme. On the biochemical 
 side, auxotrophic mutants of molds and also, more recently, 
 of bacteria have been studied in an increasing number of 
 laboratories, and this work has led to the detection of a 
 large number of intermediates in the biosynthesis of vari- 
 ous amino acids, nucleic acid bases, and vitamins. 

One criticism of the one-gene-one-enzyme hypothesis has 
 been that it was built on enzymatic interpretations that,
