^ Mutants blocked immediately before shikimic acid ac- 
 cumulated a precursor of this compound that was readily 
 recognized as a growth factor for strains with still earlier 
 blocks. Salamon (28) isolated this precursor and identified 
 it as 5-dehydroshikimic acid (DHS). The compound that 
 in turn precedes DHS on the biosynthetic path was much 
 slower to be recognized, since mutants blocked before it, 
 in either Escherichia coli or Aerobacter, showed exceed- 
 ingly little growth response. It was eventually found possi- 
 ble, however, to obtain from these mutants secondary 
 derivatives that responded well to this compound and 
 hence could be used for bioassay during its purification 
 (12). Weiss (30) was then able to isolate the compound 
 and identified it as 5-dehydroquinic acid (DHQ). Further- 
 more, mutants of Aerobacter that could respond to this 
 substance were found to respond equally well to a well- 
 known closely related compound, quinic acid. But E. coli 
 mutants that responded to DHQ neither utilized nor ac- 
 cumulated quinic acid (12).
