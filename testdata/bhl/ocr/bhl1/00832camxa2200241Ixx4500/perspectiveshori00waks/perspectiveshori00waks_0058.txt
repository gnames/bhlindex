44 Perspectives in Microbiology 

This is as far back as we have been able to penetrate 
 by the method of searching for growth factors that could 
 replace the aromatic supplement. At the other end of the 
 chain, beyond shikimic acid, we have encountered three 
 accumulated compounds that are completely devoid of 
 nutritional activity for any mutant. One of these is found 
 in filtrates of all mutants that accumulate shikimic acid, 
 and on acid hydrolysis it was found to yield shikimic acid 
 (11). It has been identified by Weiss as 5-phosphoshikimic 
 acid. The second compound is accumulated by mutants 
 that are blocked still later, and it too ^vas found to yield 
 shikimic acid on acid hydrolysis (11). This compound, 
 provisionally termed Zl, is as yet unidentified. 

The third inactive compound, prephenic acid (PPA), 
 is accumulated by mutants that require phenylalanine or 
 phenylpyruvic acid for growth (7, 18) and also by some that 
 require tyrosine or the corresponding a-keto acid. It has 
 been isolated and identified by Weiss and Gilvarg (31). 
 PPA is a nonaromatic compound, and it has particular 
 biochemical interest because it is the substrate of the actual 
 aromatization step in phenylalanine biosynthesis, losing 
 both CO2 and water to yield phenylpyruvic acid. 

I should now like to describe some studies on the en- 
 zymes linking certain of these compounds. These enzymes 
 can easily be obtained in cell-free solution after disrupting 
 wild-type E. coli cells, either by grinding with glass powder 
 or by sonic oscillation. 

The enzyme of this series that has been most extensively 
 studied, from a physiological point of view, is 5-dehydro- 
 quinase, investigated by Mitsuhashi (22). It removes a 
 molecule of water from DHQ to form DHS, and its ac- 
 tivity is readily measured by virtue of the fact that DHS 
 has a high absorption peak at 234 mfi, whereas DHQ does 
 not absorb light significantly at this wavelength. Activ- 
 ity is strictly proportional to enzyme concentration. The 
 reaction is reversible, with the equilibrium constant
