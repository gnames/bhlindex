Microbial Mutants 47 

Let us return to quinic acid, which is a growth factor for 
 certain Aerobacter mutants but not for any available E. 
 coll mutants. The enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of 
 this compound to DHQ in Aerobacter has been extracted 
 from the wild type by Mitsuhashi and has been called 
 quinic dehydrogenase (23). It is specific for diphospho- 
 pyridine nucleotide (DPN), in contrast to the correspond- 
 ing enzyme that interconverts DHS and shikimic acid, al- 
 ready noted to be TPN-specific. Quinic dehydrogenase is 
 much more restricted in its distribution than are the two 
 enzymes previously described; it could not be detected in 
 extracts of wild-type E. coli or in various other microbial 
 and plant extracts that did contain these other enzymes. 

The enzymes concerned with phosphoshikimic acid and 
 with compound Zl have not yet been investigated. The 
 enzyme that converts prephenic acid to phenylpyruvic acid 
 has been shown to be present in wild-type extract, absent 
 from an extract of a mutant blocked in this reaction, and 
 present in the expected amount in a mixture of the two 
 extracts (10, 31). It has not been purified, but on structural 
 grounds it seems probable that only a single enzyme would 
 be required to catalyze the reaction. Finally, Rudman and 
 Meister (27) have described a transaminase from E. coli 
 that converts phenylpyruvic acid and several other a-keto 
 acids to their corresponding a-amino acids; no mutant 
 deficient in this enzyme has yet been recognized. 

And now, what criteria shall we use to decide on the 
 metabolic role of each of these compounds? Historically, 
 the first criterion to be used with mutants, and the only 
 one used for a number of years, was growth-factor activity. 
 Accordingly, one was hesitant to accept as an intermediate 
 a compound that could not support growth, or even one 
 that did so slowly or only at excessive concentrations. 
 There has been increasing evidence, however, that growth- 
 factor activity is not a necessary condition for function as 
 an essential intermediate. (This point is discussed later.)
