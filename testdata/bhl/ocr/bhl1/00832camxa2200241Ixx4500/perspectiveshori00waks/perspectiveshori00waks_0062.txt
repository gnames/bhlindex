Furthermore, it is not a sufficient condition. For example, 
 para-nitrobenzoic acid can effectively replace para-amino- 
 benzoic acid as a growth factor for mutants of Neurospora 
 (29) or E. coli (10), but only because the cells can non- 
 specifically reduce nitro groups to amino groups. In such 
 a case, even if one used isotopes to show that growth factor 
 A was incorporated into cell constituent B, one would have 
 demonstrated only that A can serve as a precursor of B, 
 but not that A is an essential precursor of B, that is, an 
 obligatory intermediate in the synthesis of B by the wild- 
 type organism growing on a minimal medium. 

Accumulation of a compound by an auxotrophic mutant 
 has seemed to offer more significant evidence that the com- 
 pound is a true intermediate. But this property, too, is 
 clearly not a necessary condition.^ Furthermore, it is not 
 a sufficient one. Some accumulated compounds are unstable 
 and give rise, for example, to colored products that are 
 very unlikely to be participants in biosynthesis (3, 21); and 
 some accumulated intermediates appear to become con- 
 jugated, in a process akin to what in mammalian biochem- 
 istry is called detoxification (33). 

We come, then, to enzymatic criteria. If a compound has 
 nutritional activity, it must either be, or become spontane- 
 ously converted to, the substrate of some enzyme in the 
 cell. Similarly, if a compound is accumulated, it must 
 either be the product of some enzyme or be spontaneously 
 formed from such a product. In consequence, the demon- 
 stration of such an enzyme does not alone, any more than 

2 For example, when an intermediate is common to several paths (as 
 with glutamic acid), a block in its entrance to one of those paths would 
 not be expected to cause its accumulation. Even with compounds re- 
 stricted to a single path, the level of accumulation reached varies widely 
 from one compound to another and also depends strikingly on the con- 
 ditions of growth; it is sometimes not detectable. In general, accumulation 
 of intermediates by mutants has been used by students of intermediary 
 metabolism simply as a generous gift of the gods. The mechanisms 
 responsible for such accumulation and, even more important, for its 
 absence in the wild type constitute a major problem for future investiga- 
 tion.
