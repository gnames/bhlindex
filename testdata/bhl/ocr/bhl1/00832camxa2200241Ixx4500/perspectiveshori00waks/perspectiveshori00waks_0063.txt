the isotopic evidence for incorporation already mentioned, 
 show that the compound is an essential intermediate. But 
 if the enzyme that forms or utilizes the compound can be 
 shown to be present in extracts of the wild type and absent 
 from extracts of a mutant that is blocked in the biosyn- 
 thetic chain in question — and if the enzyme assay is sensi- 
 tive enough so that the observed difference between the 
 two extracts is large — then one can begin to feel confident 
 that he is dealing with an essential intermediate. 

One more possibility, however, must be considered: that 
 the true intermediates might be unstable or conjugated 
 compounds, never present in more than trace amounts. 
 The compounds that are detected as growth factors or as 
 accumulation products would then be merely cast-off de- 
 rivatives, pallid reflections of the living reality, just as, in 
 Plato's parable of the cave, objects sensed in the world 
 around us were considered to be mere shadows of an 
 ideal world of true reality. Such a scheme might be repre- 
 sented as follows: 

A and B would represent the true intermediates, and A' 
 and B' the parallel side products. An auxotrophic mutant 
 blocked between A and B would be unable to convert not 
 only A to B, but also A' to B'. A distinction can be made, 
 however, as Adelberg has pointed out (2), on the basis 
 of the fact that a single enzyme could convert A to B, 
 whereas three enzymes would be required to convert A' 
 to B'.^ We are led, therefore, to the following conclusion: 
 that essential intermediates can be recognized at present 
 with maximal certainty only in pairs, by showing (a) that 
 the wild type (either cell or extract) can convert these 

3 We are referring here to substances (A and A') that are not in rapid 
 spontaneous equilibrium with each other.
