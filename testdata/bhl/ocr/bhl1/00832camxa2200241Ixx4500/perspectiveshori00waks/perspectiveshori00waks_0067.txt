for an accessibility barrier, the indirect evidence they fur- 
 nish is strong. Studies on this aspect of cell physiology are 
 still in a primitive state; there is reason to hope that in in- 
 vestigation of this important area, mutants with altered ac- 
 cessibility will be of great help, just as auxotrophic mutants 
 have been in analyzing biosynthetic paths. To point out 
 how complex accessibility problems may be, I should like 
 to note that the barrier to DHQ just described has been 
 observed on the usual medium, in which glucose is the car- 
 bon source. If the glucose is replaced by xylose or succinate 
 the barrier disappears, and the primary auxotroph and its 
 secondary derivative then respond equally well to DHQ; 
 but under these conditions, addition of a trace of glucose 
 restores the barrier (12)! 

To bring the aromatic story up to date, I should like to 
 mention that a fusion of enzymatic and nutritional studies 
 with mutants has made it possible to trace this path farther 
 back than we were able to go by nutritional studies alone. 
 In this work, my colleague, Edwin Kalan, has recently 
 shown that mutants blocked before DHQ accumulate a 
 precursor, "compound V." This substance, though without 
 demonstrable growth-factor activity, could be recognized 
 through its enzymatic conversion to DHS by extracts of 
 mutants blocked after DHS. Furthermore, in collabora- 
 tion with David Sprinson of Columbia University, he 
 showed that these extracts also formed DHS from various 
 phosphorylated carbohydrates. The whole early part of the 
 path of aromatic biosynthesis is therefore now available for 
 enzymatic analysis. 

Finally, I should like to point out that the criteria pro- 
 posed for recognizing an essential intermediate are not re- 
 stricted to biosynthetic reactions. An extension to degrada- 
 tive reactions is useful, for though many of these reactions 
 have been exhaustively studied, it has not been possible, in 
 general, to assess definitively their physiological importance
