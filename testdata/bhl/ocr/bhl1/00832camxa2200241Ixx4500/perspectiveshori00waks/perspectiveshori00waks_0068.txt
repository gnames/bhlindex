54 Perspecfives in Microbiology 

by using enzymatic methods alone, or even in combination 
 with isotopic methods. Let us consider the tricarboxylic 
 acid cycle, whose energy-yielding, degradative aspects have 
 been emphasized in the past, though its importance in the 
 biosynthesis of glutamic acid and aspartic acid and their 
 derivatives has only recently received more attention. De- 
 spite the fact that all the enzymes of this cycle have been 
 demonstrated in E. coli and in various other micro- 
 organisms, there is no general agreement as to whether this 
 cycle plays an essential or even an important role in the 
 oxidation of acetate by these organisms. 

To study this question, Gilvarg and I have used the 
 methods described for biosynthetic reactions, employing a 
 glutamic acid auxotroph of E. coli that turned out, on 
 enzymatic analysis, to lack the condensing enzyme for form- 
 ing citrate from acetyl-coenzyme A and oxaloacetate (14). 
 It was found that this mutant not only required a-ketoglu- 
 tarate or glutamate as a growth factor (when growing on 
 glucose as a carbon source), but also had completely lost the 
 ability to use acetate as a carbon source or to form CO2 from 
 acetate. Yet when E. coli derives its energy from acetate, 
 the formation of CO2 is obligatory.^ Hence, in terms of the 
 criteria proposed, we have shown that absence of the citrate- 
 condensing enzyme is necessarily associated with inability 
 to form from acetate two obligatory metabolic products 
 (a-ketoglutarate and CO2) which the wild type can form. 
 We can therefore conclude that the tricarboxylic acid cycle 
 is essential in E. coli not only for biosynthetic purposes, but 
 also for the complete oxidation of acetate. I believe this is 
 the first conclusive demonstration of the latter point; it 
 provides an excellent example of the sharpness of the tools 
 furnished by microbial mutants. 

5 The possibility of succinate formation by back-to-back condensation 
 of acetate was eliminated by the fact that this mutant, though unable 
 to oxidize acetate, could still oxidize succinate.
