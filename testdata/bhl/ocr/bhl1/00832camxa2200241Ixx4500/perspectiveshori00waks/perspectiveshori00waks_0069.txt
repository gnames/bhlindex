Microbial Mutants 55 

To summarize their biochemical implications, the enzy- 
 matic studies described here have convinced us that some 
 (but not all) of the compounds accumulated by aromatic 
 auxotrophs are true essential biosynthetic intermediates. 
 These results have therefore increased our confidence that 
 most of the compounds accumulated by other mutants will 
 have similar metabolic significance. Furthermore, a com- 
 bination of enzymatic, nutritional, and accumulation 
 studies, applied to mutants, has led us to previously in- 
 accessible intermediates. Also, such an approach has made 
 it possible to define more accurately the physiological role 
 of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. In general, it appears that 
 nutritional studies on mutants, like isotopic studies, have 
 provided most valuable exploratory tools in the search for 
 biosynthetic intermediates; that the identification of com- 
 pounds accumulated by mutants, even when these com- 
 pounds are devoid of nutritional activity, is a valid ex- 
 tension of this approach; and that enzymatic comparisons 
 between mutants and the wild type can offer the most 
 rigorous proof presently possible that a compound is an 
 essential intermediate on a metabolic path. 

To summarize their genetic implications, the enzymatic 
 studies described here, and similar studies on other enzyme 
 systems in this (19) and other laboratories (13, 25, 27), have 
 shown that Beadle and Tatum were correct in their original 
 assumption that an auxotrophic mutant lacks a specific 
 enzyme. I believe we can feel confident that only an ex- 
 ceptional auxotrophic mutant requires a substance for some 
 other reason: for example, the inhibition rather than the 
 absence of an enzyme (34), or the destruction of the sub- 
 stance by an exaggerated side reaction (17). 

There has not been time to describe other enzyme studies 
 that have thrown a little further light on the relation be- 
 tween a gene and either the structure or the amount of the 
 corresponding enzyme. With respect to enzyme structure,
