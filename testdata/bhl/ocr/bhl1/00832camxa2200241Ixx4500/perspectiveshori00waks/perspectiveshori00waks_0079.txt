radioactive isotopes of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and 
 other elements has enormously simplified certain kinds of 
 metabolic studies. Tracer methods frequently permit the 
 direct observation of chemical processes that previously 
 could be detected and studied only, if at all, by much more 
 indirect and laborious procedures. For example, the carbon 
 isotopes made it possible to determine the fate of individual 
 carbon atoms during the metabolic transformation of a 
 multicarbon compound. This supplied new information 
 about the chemical reactions in living bacteria and enzyme 
 systems that could be used to determine the validity of pro- 
 posed metabolic pathways. Tracer methods also permitted 
 the study of the utilization of compounds that normally ac- 
 cumulate during metabolism. In this way the surprising dis- 
 covery was made that several common end products of 
 bacterial metabolism like acetate and carbon dioxide, pre- 
 viously regarded as stable and inert, are in fact inter- 
 mediates that can be further converted by many bacteria 
 into a variety of catabolic products and cellular con- 
 stituents. 

The balance and tracer methods give a picture of the 
 over-all chemical transformation in bacterial metabolism 
 and also provide a guide to the chemical mechanisms in- 
 volved. These techniques are limited, however, by the fact 
 that in living bacteria the metabolic processes are so per- 
 fectly coordinated that it is difficult to separate and identify 
 the individual reactions. Also, intact bacteria are imperme- 
 able to many compounds of biochemical importance such 
 as phosphate esters and coenzymes. Therefore a detailed 
 insight into the cellular chemical mechanisms, which are 
 responsible for substrate decomposition and the synthesis 
 of essential cellular components, requires the use of cellular 
 extracts and enzymatic techniques. This has been obvious 
 for a long time, ever since the discovery of the glycolytic 
 mechanism. But, the required combination of microbio- 
 logical and enzymological know-how was scarce, and so,
