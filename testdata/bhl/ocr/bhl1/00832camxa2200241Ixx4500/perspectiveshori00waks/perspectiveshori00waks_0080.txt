66 Perspectives in Microbiology 

until recently, progress in the analysis of enzymatic mech- 
 anisms in bacteria has been relatively slow. An additional 
 impediment for the microbiologist was the lack of good 
 methods for preparing enzymatically active cell-free ex- 
 tracts from bacteria. This difficulty has now been largely 
 overcome by development of the alumina grinding (16), 
 sonoration, and other techniques of preparing bacterial ex- 
 tracts. As a result of this, together with the continually in- 
 creasing interest in intermediary metabolism and the de- 
 velopment of basic knowledge of enzymatic mechanisms, 
 research on bacterial enzyme systems has expanded tre- 
 mendously during recent years. The new generation of 
 microbiologists and biochemists is now vigorously attack- 
 ing the many meaty problems of bacterial metabolism. 

Nutritional methods have also been applied extensively 
 for the study of the synthetic capacities and biosynthetic 
 mechanisms of bacteria. The study of bacterial nutrition 
 has led to the detection and isolation of a number of com- 
 pounds or growth factors which are essential components 
 of the enzymatic machinery of all or most living organisms, 
 but which are specifically required as nutrients only by 
 those organisms that are unable to synthesize them from 
 simpler substances. The nutritional approach to the study 
 of the biosynthetic pathways of amino acids, growth factors, 
 and other cellular constituents has been enormously stimu- 
 lated by the discovery of methods of effectively blocking the 
 chemical reactions of the cell so as to cause the accumula- 
 tion of various compounds in the chain of synthetic re- 
 actions. Such blocking can be achieved by the isolation of 
 appropriate biochemical mutants by modification of the 
 methods first developed by Beadle and Tatum, or by the 
 use of more or less specific chemical inhibitors. Much of 
 our present knowledge of biosynthetic pathways in bacteria 
 is based upon the use of these and related methods. 

Many other new methods and techniques have smoothed 
 the way for the student of bacterial metabolism. Of these,
