68 Perspecfives in Microbiology 

requirements have been examined carefully. A great many 
 bacteria, however, have not been studied adequately from 
 the nutritional point of view. The general requirements of 
 these organisms undoubtedly will be similar to those al- 
 ready known. But from past experience, it can be antici- 
 pated that at least a few of these bacteria will ultimately be 
 found to require new types of giowth factors. Within re- 
 cent years several such substances have been discovered 
 through the study of microbial nutrition. One is lipoic 
 acid, which has been shown to play an essential role in the 
 oxidation of a-keto acids. Another is ferrichrome, an iron- 
 containing polypeptide derivative isolated by Neilands (18) 
 from a smut fungus, Ustilago sphaerogena, and found to 
 stimulate the growth of a soil bacterium. A third is a di- 
 saccharide of galactose and N-acetyl-glucosamine, recently 
 shown by Zilliken and others (30) to have growth-promot- 
 ing activity for Lactobacillus hifidus. Undoubtedly many 
 more new compounds of biological importance will be 
 found by further systematic investigation of bacterial nu- 
 trition. 

Respiration and Fermenfafion 

Next are the problems of the oxidation and fermentation 
 of the major substrates. Much is known about the com- 
 pounds utilized and the major excretory products. A good 
 beginning has been made in determining the chemical steps 
 by which these energy-yielding reactions proceed. Yet here 
 also much remains to be done. Only recently, for example, 
 have we begun to discover some of the pathways by which 
 bacteria convert glucose to three carbon compounds (6, 29). 

GLUCOSE DECOMPOSITION 

Until a few years ago, it was commonly accepted that 
 sugar decomposition in bacteria occurs by the glycolytic 
 mechanism. As late as 1952, Elsden (3), in a review of exist-
