ing knowledge on bacterial fermentations, was able to start 
 with the thesis that "the primary mechanism found in 
 muscle and yeast, the operation of which results in the 
 formation of pyruvic acid, is found also in those bacteria 
 which ferment carbohydrates." This thesis is no longer 
 tenable, and no one should assume the existence of a 
 glycolytic mechanism in a bacterium without clear and 
 specific proof. 

Gluconic Acid Pathway. The first example of a non- 
 glycolytic pathway of glucose oxidation by bacteria was dis- 
 covered long before glycolysis was known.

In 1886, Brown found that species of Acetobacter oxidize 
 massive amounts of glucose to gluconic acid. Not long after- 
 ward, Bertrand obtained evidence for the further oxidation 
 of gluconate to 5-ketogluconate by Acetobacter xylinum. 
 Recently Katznelson, Tannenbaum, and Tatum (13) 
 studied glucose and gluconate oxidation by another species, 
 Acetobacter melanogenum, which is characterized by for- 
 mation of a brown water-soluble pigment. The investigators 
 have provided convincing evidence that this organism
