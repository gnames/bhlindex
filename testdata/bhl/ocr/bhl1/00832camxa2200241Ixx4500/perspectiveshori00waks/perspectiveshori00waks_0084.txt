oxidizes gluconate to 2-ketogluconate, which is then further 
 oxidized to 2,5-diketogluconate (Figure 1). The last com- 
 pound is chemically unstable and is converted, in part, into 
 the characteristic brown pigment of this species. 2-keto- 
 gluconate also is a major product of glucose oxidation 
 by several Pseudomonas species. 

The unusual feature of this type of glucose oxidation is 
 that it involves only nonphosphorylated compounds. Al- 
 most no information is available at present about the 
 further steps in the oxidation of the various ketogluconates 
 or about the role of these compounds in the energy metab- 
 olism of the bacteria. Enzymes are known that phosphory- 
 late gluconate and 2-ketogluconate, but it is not known 
 whether such phosphorylation is an obligatory require- 
 ment for the complete oxidation of these compounds. 

Rihulose Phosphate Pathway. The existence of another 
 nonglycolytic mechanism for the direct oxidation of carbo- 
 hydrate via 6-phosphogluconate by animals and yeasts was 
 established first by the work of Warburg, Lipmann, and 
 Dickens in 1935-36. The specific reactions involved in this 
 process (Figure 2) have recently been worked out by 
 Horecker, Racker, Cohen, and others (10). 

Glucose is first phosphorylated and the resulting glucose- 
 6-phosphate is oxidized to 6-P-gluconate. This in turn un- 
 dergoes an oxidative decarboxylation to carbon dioxide and 
 ribulose-5-phosphate. Although it has not been identified, 
 3-keto, 6-phosphogluconate has been postulated as an inter- 
 mediate in the latter reaction. The ribulose-5-phosphate 
 isomerizes to give ribose-5-phosphate. The upper two car- 
 bons of ribulose-5-phosphate are next transferred to carbon 
 atom 1 of ribose-5-phosphate to give one molecule each of 
 glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and sedoheptulose-7-phosphate 
 (Figure 3). These compounds then react in such a way that 
 the first three carbon atoms of the sedoheptulose-phosphate 
 are transferred to triose phosphate, giving fructose-6-phos- 
 phate and a tetrose phosphate. There is now some evidence
