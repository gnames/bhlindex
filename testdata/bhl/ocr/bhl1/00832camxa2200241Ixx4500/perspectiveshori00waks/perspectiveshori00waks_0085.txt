that the latter can react enzymatically with another mole- 
 cule of pentose phosphate to reform an additional mole- 
 cule of hexose-phosphate and a triose phosphate. The net 
 result of this cyclical series of reactions is the conversion of 
 one molecule of hexose monophosphate to three molecules 
 of carbon dioxide and one of triose phosphate.
