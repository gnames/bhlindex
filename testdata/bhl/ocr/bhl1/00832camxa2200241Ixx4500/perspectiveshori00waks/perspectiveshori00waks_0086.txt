down has special advantages to the cell because it makes 
 available a variety of carbon chains of differing lengths. 
 In fact, compounds containing one to seven carbon atoms 
 are formed from the hexose molecule by a most ingenious 
 system of group transfer reactions. The advantage of such 
 an assortment of compounds to a cell engaged in the syn- 
 thesis of a great number of more or less complex com- 
 pounds is obvious. For example, the pentose phosphate can 
 be used immediately for making ribonucleic acids and a 
 variety of ribose-containing coenzymes. Probably each of 
 the other compounds also serves as the starting point for 
 some synthetic process. 

Although much of the experimental work that has estab- 
 lished this oxidative mechanism was done ^^vith yeast, liver, 
 and plant enzymes, there is abundant evidence that some 
 bacteria including Escherichia coli (21) and Azotobacter 
 vinelandii (17) also utilize this mechanism of glucose oxida- 
 tion. 

A perhaps similar nonglycolytic mechanism, which has 
 long been suspected to exist but which has only recently 
 been demonstrated in a convincing manner, is found in the 
 fermentative bacterium Leuconostoc mesenteroides. Gayon 
 and Dubovag showed in 1894 that the fermentation of one 
 mole of glucose by Leuconostoc species yields one mole 
 each of lactate, ethanol, and carbon dioxide. The remark- 
 able feature of this fermentation, from the point of view of 
 the mechanism of sugar decomposition, is the constancy in 
 the yields of the three products. Other bacterial glucose 
 fermentations result in formation of the same compounds, 
 but the ratio of lactate to ethanol, for example, is highly 
 variable with pH and other environmental factors. With 
 Leuconostoc, half of the sugar is ahvays converted to lactate 
 and half to ethanol and carbon dioxide. This result is in- 
 consistent with the glycolytic mechanism, which requires 
 both halves of the sflucose molecule to follow a common 
 path between glyceraldehydephosphate and pyruvate.
