The existence of an unusual mechanism of glucose fer- 
 mentation in Leuconostoc was clearly established by the 
 tracer experiments of Gunsalus and Gibbs (8). The fer- 
 mentation of glucose-1-C^^ and glucose-3, 4-C^^ showed 
 (Figure 4) that the carbon dioxide originates from carbon 
 atom 1 of glucose, the methyl group of ethanol from carbon 
 2, and the carbinol group from carbon 3. The lactate car-

bons, starting with the carboxyl group, are derived from 
 glucose carbon atoms 4, 5, and 6. These results showed the 
 expected lack of mixing of the carbon from the two ends of 
 the glucose molecule, and also established an unusual origin 
 for the carbon dioxide and ethanol. In alcoholic fermenta- 
 tion by yeast, carbon dioxide is derived from carbons 3 
 and 4 of glucose, and ethanol comes from carbons 1, 2, 5, 
 and 6. 

The experiments of DeMoss (2) with cell-free extracts of 
 Leuconostoc provide additional evidence of a new mech- 
 anism. These investigators found that the enzymes aldolase 
 and triose phosphate isomerase, which are essential to the 
 glycolytic mechanism, are not present in these bacteria. The 
 details of the mechanism of glucose breakdown by Leu- 
 conostoc have not yet been worked out, but there is con-
