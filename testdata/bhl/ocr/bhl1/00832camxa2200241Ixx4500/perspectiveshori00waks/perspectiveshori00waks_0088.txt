siderable evidence that glucose-6-phosphate and 6-phos- 
 phogluconate are involved, and the mechanism may be 
 similar to the hexose monophosphate shunt mechanism in 
 yeast. 

The 2-KetOj 3-Desoxy, 6-Phospho gluconate Pathway. 
 One of the best understood nonglycolytic mechanisms of 
 glucose decomposition is that discovered in Pseudomonas 
 saccharophila by Doudoroff and his associates. This organ- 
 ism is an obligate aerobe that normally oxidizes glucose to 
 carbon dioxide without appreciable accumulation of inter- 
 mediate products. Entner and Doudoroff (4) showed, how- 
 ever, that in the presence of suitable inhibitors (DNP and 
 arsenite), cell suspensions oxidize either glucose or gluco- 
 nate with the accumulation of two moles of pyruvate. A 
 tracer experiment with glucose- 1-C^* showed that the car- 
 boxyl group of pyruvate is derived in part from carbon

 that glucose is first phosphorylated and then oxidized to
