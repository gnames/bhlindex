studied intensively with bacterial enzymes in several labora- 
 tories (7) and has been found to be unexpectedly compli- 
 cated. The reaction involves the participation of no less 
 than five coenzymes; namely, thiamine pyrophosphate, 
 lipoic acid, coenzyme A, diphosphopyridine nucleotide 
 (DPN), and adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and possibly as 
 many apoenzymes. The role of each of the coenzymes has 
 been fairly well established, although some details remain 
 to be worked out. For example, it is not yet certain whether 
 thiamine pyrophosphate and lipoic acid act entirely in- 
 dependently, or whether a compound of the two, lipoyl- 
 thiamine pyrophosphate, is an essential component of the 
 system. But it is probable that this and other controversial 
 features of the mechanism of pyruvate oxidation can be re- 
 solved in the near future. 

The mechanism of acetate oxidation in aerobic bacteria 
 has also been a subject of great interest recently. Until 1948 
 it was generally assumed on the basis of very limited data 
 that the well-known tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle is the 
 main pathway of pyruvate and acetate oxidation. Then 
 several observations strongly suggested that the cycle is not 
 responsible for acetate oxidation (12). For example, cell sus- 
 pensions of Azotobacter agilis were shown to oxidize 
 acetate, whereas components of the TCA cycle, like citrate 
 and a-ketoglutarate, were not oxidized under the same con- 
 ditions. In addition, numerous tracer experiments demon- 
 strated that the oxidation of C^Mabeled acetate by living 
 bacteria does not always result in the labeling of TCA- 
 cycle compounds that are added to the medium. Such ex- 
 periments stimulated an extensive reinvestigation of the 
 role of the TCA cycle by all available methods. As a result 
 it has been definitely established that Azotobacter, E. coli, 
 and several other bacteria possess the enzymatic machinery 
 necessary to operate the TCA cycle. As far as I am aware, 
 there is at present no clear-cut evidence for the existence of 
 any alternative mechanism of acetate oxidation, such as the
