78 Perspecfives in Microbiology 

frequently postulated dicarboxylic acid cycle in which 
 acetate is converted directly to succinate. Furthermore, 
 most of the earlier results that appeared to disprove the 
 operation of a TCA cycle can now be satisfactorily ex- 
 plained on the basis of permeability barriers in the cell. It 
 seems justifiable to conclude that the TCA cycle is a 
 functional oxidative mechanism in some bacteria, although 
 the existence of additional pathways of terminal respira- 
 tion certainly cannot be excluded. This is essentially the 
 same conclusion that could have been reached ten years 
 ago, but it is now based upon a much larger body of factual 
 information. 

In addition to serving as an oxidative mechanism, the 
 TCA cycle is useful as a device for providing a variety of 
 reactive compounds containing four, five, and six carbon 
 atoms that serve as starting points for the synthesis of 
 essential cellular constituents, such as amino acids. For 
 example, a-ketoglutarate is the immediate precursor of 
 glutamic acid, which can in turn be converted by E. coli 
 via glutamic semialdehyde to proline or via N-acetyl glu- 
 tamic acid and N-acetyl ornithine to arginine, as has been 
 shown by Vogel (27). 

FERMENTATION PRODUCTS 

The anaerobic transformations of pyruvate and acetate 
 have been studied even more extensively than the aerobic 
 reactions. The pathways of formation of most of the com- 
 mon bacterial fermentation products, such as ethanol, 
 acetate, propionate, butyrate, lactate, butanol, and acetone 
 are fairly well understood, although a good deal remains 
 to be done on the enzymatic level. It is also likely that 
 different mechanisms are operative in the formation of 
 some of these compounds in different bacterial species. 
 This is known to be true for acetate, which is formed by 
 several anaerobic bacteria from carbon dioxide by an 
 entirely unknown mechanism.
