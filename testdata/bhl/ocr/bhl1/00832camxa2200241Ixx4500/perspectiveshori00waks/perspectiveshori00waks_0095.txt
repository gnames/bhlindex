coenzyme A substrate compounds have been found to be 
 essential in other reactions catalyzed by bacteria. For ex- 
 ample, Whitely (28) has shown that succinyl CoA and pro- 
 pionyl CoA are involved in the formation of propionate 
 by the propionic acid bacteria, and Hayaishi (9) has found 
 that malonyl CoA is an intermediate in the conversion of 
 malonate to acetate by Pseudomonas, 

Though our knowledge of the enzymatic reactions in- 
 volved in butyrate synthesis is fairly detailed, it must be 
 admitted that our understanding of the role of this process 
 in the metabolism of C. kluyveri is still very deficient. We 
 do not know, for example, what benefit the organism de- 
 rives from the conversion of alcohol and acetate to buty- 
 rate, since the useful energy derived from the oxidation 
 of the alcohol appears to be consumed again in the syn- 
 thesis of butyrate, without leaving any energy available 
 for other synthetic reactions. 

Formation of Energy-Rich Compounds 

Another essential aspect of bacterial metabolism is the 
 nature of the chemical mechanisms by which energy is 
 generated and made available for synthetic purposes in 
 the cell. We owe particularly to Lipmann the idea that 
 compounds containing the so-called energy-rich phosphate 
 bond represent a common currency for energy exchange 
 in living organisms. More recently, as a result of the work 
 of Lipmann, Lynen, and others, various thioesters, like 
 acetyl CoA, also have been shown to play a prominent 
 role in energy transfer. 

The formation of such energy-rich compounds has been 
 studied extensively in animals and yeast, and it has been 
 found that they are usually formed in two ways, either by 
 the oxidation of substrate molecules such as aldehydes and 
 a-keto acids, or as a result of the transfer of electrons by 
 way of flavoproteins and the cytochrome system to oxygen.
