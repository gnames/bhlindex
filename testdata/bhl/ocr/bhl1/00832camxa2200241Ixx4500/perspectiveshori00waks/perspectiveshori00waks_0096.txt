82 Perspectives in Microbiology 

An example of energy-rich phosphate bond formation in 
 bacteria with a substrate molecule is the oxidation of 
 acetaldehyde or pyruvate to acetyl phosphate. Only a rela- 
 tively few reactions of this type, however, are known. Most 
 of the energy-rich phosphate required to drive biosyn- 
 thetic reactions in the oxidative metabolism of animals is 
 generated by the electron-transporting mechanisms. In 
 certain bacteria such mechanisms must have even greater 
 significance in the economy of the cell. The autotrophic 
 bacteria, in particular, obtain all their energy by the oxi- 
 dation of such compounds as hydrogen and sulfur; obvi- 
 ously they cannot generate energy-rich compounds by 
 substrate-linked reactions. They must be entirely depend- 
 ent upon their electron-transporting systems for this vital 
 function. As yet, however, virtually nothing is known 
 about energy-rich phosphate-bond formation by such sys- 
 tems in either autotrophic or heterotrophic bacteria. Here 
 then is an aspect of bacterial metabolism which obviously 
 needs to be explored, and which could yield information 
 of fundamental significance both to microbiology and to 
 biochemistry. 

Before leaving the topic of electron transport, I shall 
 refer briefly to recent developments in the knowledge of 
 bacterial cytochrome systems. The work of Smith and 
 Chance, of Vernon and Kamen, and others has shown 
 clearly that bacteria contain several types of cytochrome 
 and cytochrome oxidase that differ markedly from the 
 classical cytochrome components of heart muscle and 
 yeast. Another new and unexpected development has been 
 the discovery of relatively large amounts of cytochrome 
 components in some obligately anaerobic bacteria like the 
 sulfate-reducing bacteria (20) and some of the photosyn- 
 thetic bacteria. The role of cytochrome in the sulfate- 
 reducing bacteria is not yet known, though it presumably 
 acts as an electron carrier between the oxidizable substrate 
 and sulfate. Vernon and Kamen (26) have obtained evi-
