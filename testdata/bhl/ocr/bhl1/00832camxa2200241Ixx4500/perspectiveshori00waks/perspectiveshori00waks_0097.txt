Bacfenal Metabolism 83 

dence that in Rhodospir ilium rubrum the cytochrome sys- 
 tem participates in the photosynthetic process, since the 
 bacterial cytochrome is reduced by organic electron donors 
 and is reoxidized by a light-generated oxidizing agent 
 through the action of a specific cytochrome photooxidase. 
 With these recent developments, a rapid extension of 
 knowledge of the nature and function of bacterial cyto- 
 chrome systems can be expected in the near future. 

Biosynfhefic Pathways 

One of the most important aspects of bacterial metab- 
 olism, to which I have scarcely referred, is the synthesis 
 of cellular constituents, such as amino acids, purines, pro- 
 teins, and polysaccharides. Since many bacteria grow in 
 simple media containing only one or a few organic com- 
 pounds, it is obvious that they possess highly developed 
 synthetic mechanisms. Time does not permit me to give 
 even a superficial account of progress and problems in the 
 analysis of biosynthetic pathways. Suffice it to say that 
 elucidation of the mechanisms of biosynthesis is a major 
 objective of current research in bacterial metabolism, and 
 it undoubtedly will receive increasing emphasis as the 
 simpler and more conspicuous problems of bacterial ca- 
 tabolism are satisfactorily solved. 

I hope this brief survey of a few aspects of bacterial 
 metabolism is convincing evidence that the subject is in 
 a state of active development. As I have tried to emphasize, 
 we are now in the midst of an attempt, started many years 
 ago, to discover the chemical mechanisms whereby rela- 
 tively simple nutrients are converted into living organisms. 
 I say "organisms" rather than "bacteria" because even for 
 microbiologists the real objective is to understand the 
 chemical basis of life rather than the peculiarities of one 
 or another bacterial species. A great deal has been learned 
 about the dynamic aspects of biochemistry by the study of
