Molds as Metabolic Models 

By JACKSON W. FOSTER 

To persons cognizant of the enormous 
 numbers and of the infinite heterogeneity of fungi, the 
 futility of an attempt to discourse on the broad subject 
 of metabolism of fungi is obvious. The vast majority of 
 significant studies of fungal metabolism, however, have 
 been done on "lower," or filamentous fungi (the molds). 
 Consequently, the scope of this paper is automatically 
 restricted; even so, only isolated aspects of the subject can 
 be taken up effectively. My purpose is to reflect on the 
 implications that certain studies on fungi have for issues 
 which possess biological importance far beyond the im- 
 mediate fact of their elucidation in fungi. 

Before taking up the more technical features of this dis- 
 cussion, I should like to venture a few personal viewpoints 
 relative to mold metabolism as a field of study. Frequently 
 one sees evidence of an implicit assumption that training 
 in technical mycology is a prerequisite for investigations 
 on metabolism of fungi and that, lacking this, one had best 
 avoid contending with these organisms. Though this as- 
 sumption undoubtedly is valid for classical mycology,
