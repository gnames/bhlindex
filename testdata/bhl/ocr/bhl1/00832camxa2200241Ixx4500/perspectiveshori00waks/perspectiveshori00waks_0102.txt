88 Perspectives in Microbiology 

basis that the principles of bacterial physiology can be 
 applied to all other organisms? 

The unilateral approach in bacterial physiology courses 
 would be at least understandable if exposure to an inde- 
 pendent course in mold metabolism were available for or 
 required of the bacteriology major. To the best of my 
 knowledge, only a handful of colleges in the United States 
 present course coverage of this subject matter to a degree 
 comparable to the coverage of bacterial metabolism. 

From the flavor of the foregoing, it should not be con- 
 strued that I would advocate pursuit of the fungi with the 
 object of characterizing their activities in chemical sym- 
 bolism. To the contrary, we need more and more to utilize 
 the chemical reactions, to interpret the biology of the 
 fungus in relation to its survival in nature and its response 
 to the environment. In this aspiration, the biochemist re- 
 mains the handyman of the biologist. The patterns unfold- 
 ing in activities of the bacteria and the fungi, and to a 
 lesser degree, in those of the other groups of microorgan- 
 isms, render it not only desirable but perhaps inevitable 
 that an integrated coverage of the various groups of micro- 
 organisms be presented in college courses intended to pro- 
 vide well-rounded training and outlook in microbiology. 
 Possibly one can already detect a trend in that direction. 
 It is significant, perhaps, that nowadays one occasionally 
 sees courses, and even departments, called "microbiology," 
 where once they were named "bacteriology." Instead of 
 the present compartmentalized treatment of these subjects, 
 it would be enormously more advantageous to students and 
 to the progress of research in all areas of microbiology to 
 have a kind of United Nations among microbes; the most 
 effective agency of this organization would be microbial 
 metabolism. 

Whereas, a generation ago, the subject of microbial 
 metabolism might have been an amorphous amalgamation 
 of the component specialities, today we have a powerful
