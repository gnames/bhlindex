ous property of 5. hrevicaulis, the arsenic fungus, which 
 it displays to a conspicuous (or should we say, lethal?) 
 degree, exemplifies the thesis presented earlier, to wit: 
 in metabolism, the unusual is not only the outpost, but 
 the signpost of the usual — a metabolic model, as it were. 

Earlier studies on the fungi might have led to results 
 in still another area, namely, attainment of our modern 
 conceptual formulation of the mechanism of, and the cyclic 
 nature of, respiration and carbohydrate oxidation. A per- 
 spective appraisal reveals that individual strains or species 
 of fungi acting on glucose accumulate, under appropriate 
 conditions, a preponderance of one carboxylic acid, gen- 
 erally accompanied by lesser amounts of other acids. Thus 
 we have citric-acid-accumulating fungi; we have itaconic 
 acid fungi; we have fungi accumulating fumaric acid and 
 its relatives, succinic and malic acids; we have fungi pro- 
 ducing oxalic acid, with its acetic and giycolic acid equiva- 
 lents; we have fungi accumulating ethanol, with its acetic 
 acid equivalent. These distinctive fungus processes were 
 recognized as far back as the 1890's. We know today that 
 all these fungi conduct fundamentally the same type of 
 oxidation of the carbohydrate, that the oxidation is the 
 aerobic respiratory process of the fungi, that with one or 
 two exceptions all these organic acids are formed by all 
 the fungi so far examined, that the unique accumulations 
 represent blockage of the oxidative pathway at different 
 points, and that the process is cyclic — the Krebs tricar- 
 boxylic acid cycle. 

Thus, for a half-century before the conceptual formula- 
 tion and the experimental demonstration by Szent-Gyorgi 
 and by Krebs of the role of dicarboxylic and tricarboxylic 
 acids in aerobic respiration, the signposts marking the way 
 were clearly visible, albeit unrecognizable, in the fungi. 
 The same might be said for the so-called gluconic acid 
 shunt, because it was in 1922 that Molliard discovered 
 that certain fungi accumulate distinctive amounts of glu-
