ess, generally are found in abundant yield only when the 
 concentration of the substrate exceeds a relatively high 
 minimum level. The best explanation of this appears to be 
 that the presence of excess substrate maintains the forma- 
 tion of intermediate products at a rate faster than they can 
 be transformed; hence they accumulate. Elsewhere, I have 
 described this as "shunt metabolism." The essential result 
 is a higher yield of a particular product per unit of sub- 
 strate consumed, up to a certain maximum. Although it 
 has been conventional to cultivate fungi in media whose 
 substrate content is 1 to 5 per cent or more, especially 
 where accumulation of intermediates is sought, it is not 
 often that bacteria are cultivated in media containing in 
 excess of 0.5 to 1 per cent of a single carbon source of any 
 type. Especially in aerobic oxidation one might expect, if 
 the bacterium is furnished a high substrate concentration, 
 to find products of incomplete oxidation accumulating. 
 Their nature would afford good clues as to the mode of 
 degradation of the substrate, and thereby expedite the solu- 
 tion of the problem, which otherwise might be difficult 
 of access in media of low substrate concentration. An out- 
 standing illustration of this principle exists in the discov- 
 ery that numerous species of Pseudomonas and Phytomonas 
 produce high yields of various hexonic and pentonic acids 
 when the carbohydrate content of the medium is high (9, 
 11). That this phenomenon is not limited to formation 
 of sugar acids is evidenced by the accumulation of 20 
 per cent molar yield of a-ketoglutaric acid from 5 per cent 
 glucose by a strain of Pseudomonas fluorescens (10). Un- 
 doubtedly the same principle would apply, and awaits ex- 
 ploitation, with respect to intermediate oxidation prod- 
 ucts of substrates other than sugars. It is already known 
 that various strains of P. fluorescens, when furnished ade- 
 quate ethanol as the substrate, carry out an acetification 
 process indistinguishable from that formerly thought re- 
 stricted to the genus Acetobacter (13).
