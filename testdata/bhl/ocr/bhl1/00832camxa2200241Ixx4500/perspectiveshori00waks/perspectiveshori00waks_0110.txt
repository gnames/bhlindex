96 Perspectives in Microbiology 

cumulated on the earth to an incredible degree. If one 
 assays the participation of fungi in the vast and inexorable 
 decay process which pervades nature, of necessity one be- 
 comes convinced that, along with bacteria and actino- 
 mycetes, the fungi play a prominent role. Seeking details 
 of the metabolic processes and pathways whereby the mul- 
 tifarious organic compounds of nature are catabolically 
 attacked by various individual fungi, one does, however 
 rather quickly perceive that the available information deals 
 overwhelmingly with one class of compounds, that is, car- 
 bohydrates. Compared to the extensive variety of catabolic 
 mechanisms known in the diverse bacteria utilizing mani- 
 fold compounds, those known in the fungi can hardly be 
 considered numerous. Undoubtedly, the obvious preoccu- 
 pation with carbohydrate metabolism of fungi is ascrib- 
 able, in large degree, to the industrial significance of 
 certain carboxylic acids produced from carbohydrates. The 
 disparity between numbers of bacterial and of fungal 
 catabolic pathways points up vast gaps in our knowledge 
 of mold metabolic types, and at once stakes out enormous 
 areas awaiting what surely will be fruitful exploration. 

And the approach here may be quite direct, for the 
 basic requirement is simply an array of pure cultures of 
 fungi, each capable of utilizing a single compound as the 
 sole source of carbon or nitrogen or both. The important 
 thing here is the great number of diverse compounds avail- 
 able for this purpose. When this potential metabolic in- 
 formation becomes translated into real information, the 
 present status of mold metabolism will, in retrospect, ap- 
 pear modest indeed. 

Testing of existing stock cultures will not, I should 
 judge, be enough to procure the necessary scope of sub- 
 strate attack; for, notwithstanding the great number of 
 morphologically different fungi available in pure culture 
 today, one might suspect that the conditions of their origi- 
 nal isolation from nature undoubtedly have resulted in 
 more homogeneity than heterogeneity of metabolic types.
