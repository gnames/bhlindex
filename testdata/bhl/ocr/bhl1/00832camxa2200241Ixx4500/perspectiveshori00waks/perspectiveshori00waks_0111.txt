Molds as Mefabolk Models 97 

Development of new and improvement of existing 
 methods will enhance chances of obtaining from nature 
 varieties of fungi that seldom, if ever, see the light of the 
 laboratory. For example, it is customary to facilitate isola- 
 tion of fungi by acidification of the medium in order to 
 suppress interfering bacteria and actinomycetes. This 
 method works, but it works to obtain only acid-tolerant 
 species. Actually, a considerable portion of the soil fungus 
 population is also suppressed by the elevated hydrogen-ion 
 concentration. A promising approach to this objective is 
 the use at neutral or slightly acid pH values of various 
 chemicals which selectively inhibit nonfungal organisms. 

The application of suitable and ingenious enrichment 
 and selective culture techniques with respect to utilization 
 of diverse individual chemical substrates will, I am sure, 
 reveal that, metabolically speaking, the fungi presently are 
 the most underrated of all the microorganisms. Products 
 of new catabolic pathways may have significance for the 
 applied microbiologist, as well as for his academic counter- 
 part. Metabolic properties hitherto unsuspected in fungi 
 are to be had simply by performing appropriate, skillful 
 experiments. Illustrative of the ranges unsuspected in these 
 organisms is the recent report (6) of the rather decided 
 formation of nitrate from reduced nitrogen compounds 
 by numerous soil isolates of A. fiavus, grown hetero- 
 trophically. I may mention also that M. Dworkin in my 
 laboratory has isolated a mold which makes rapid and 
 abundant growth with ethane gas (99 per cent purity) 
 as the sole source of carbon and energy, apparently the 
 first such fungus described as being capable of utilizing 
 a gaseous hydrocarbon.

My concentration up to this point on the catabolic as- 
 pects of fungi ought not to be interpreted as a purposeful 
 attempt to ignore the synthetic or anabolic activities of
