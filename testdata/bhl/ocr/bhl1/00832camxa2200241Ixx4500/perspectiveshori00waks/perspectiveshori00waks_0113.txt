Molds as Mefabol'ic Models 99 

entities existing in nature. For example, it is a well docu- 
 mented fact that numerous species of microorganisms are 
 unable to utilize carbohydrate as their sole source of carbon 
 and energy. On the other hand, those organisms which are 
 proved capable of utilizing carbohydrate may not, and 
 indeed probably do not, have the opportunity to exercise 
 that capacity under the conditions which may exist in the 
 soil. Irrespective of the amount or the origin of soluble 
 carbohydrate, the vast majority of the microbial popula- 
 tion could well lose out in the competition for it to the 
 fastest growing minority populations in the soil. For ex- 
 ample, the bacteria would, in this respect, be formidable 
 antagonists for most fungi, except in acid soils where the 
 bacteria are differentially suppressed. 

If we examine further the capabilities of the soil popula- 
 tion, we find innumerable soil forms eminently well 
 adapted to utilize various one-, two-, and three-carbon 
 compounds as the sole source of carbon and energy. This 
 point strikes at the heart of a thesis for which ample sup- 
 port might be adduced: the synthesis of protoplasm from 
 one-, two-, and three-carbon split products derived from 
 the dissimilation of larger molecules by fast growing 
 minority populations may well account for a much larger 
 proportion of the gross biosynthetic activity in the soil 
 than hitherto appreciated. And since fungi, as a rule, ap- 
 pear to be metabolically sluggish compared to most bac- 
 teria, this ability to survive on metabolic "scraps" may be 
 widespread among, and perhaps characteristic of, many 
 molds and other microbial growths in nature. In any case, 
 I strongly suspect that in microorganisms, pathways to total 
 biosynthesis from one- and two-carbon compounds may yet 
 emerge and prove to be as significant as sugar breakdown 
 in the over-all foundations of biosynthesis in nature. An 
 analogy to photosynthesis will be perceived, especially in 
 respect to intracellular self-regeneration of appropriate 
 acceptors via cyclic mechanisms.
