100 Perspectives in Microbiology 

In conclusion, we have seen how unique metabolic fea- 
 tures of fungi, long recognized, might have led to major 
 advances in our knowledge of living things in general, for 
 they surely were models of things which came later. We 
 have also scanned the fungus field ahead and, although 
 sketchily, have indicated the existence of innumerable ad- 
 ditional metabolic features which, if investigated ade- 
 quately, are bound to turn out as workable models of 
 much larger replicas in nature.
