Metabolic Pathways 

By WAYNE W. UMBREIT 

The body of knowledge recalled by the 
 words "metabolic pathway" is an important part of micro- 
 biology. It is perhaps the most intellectual of the fields of 
 microbiology, possibly the least practical; let us hope that 
 it is not the most obscure. 

In the living cell there are varied processes, some of 
 which are dependent upon physical and spatial forces, on 
 tensions, and in a molecular sense, on springs and coils; 
 but the vast majority of living processes are chemical 
 processes, and the living cell, particularly the bacterial 
 cell, is a chemical machine â€” a chemical mechanism. 

The individual reactions that constitute the chemical 
 processes of living tissues, be they human or microbial, 
 have been intensively studied, and a good deal is known 
 about them. No one would assume, however, that with 
 our present knowledge we are capable of describing all of 
 the varied chemistry of the living process. Further, of 
 those reactions whose course is known, the detailed mech- 
 anism may be considerably different from what we now 
 suppose. I do not propose to outline detailed reaction
