Characferhfic Metabolic Reactions of Cells 

Within this framework of space relations, and as part of 
 its impact upon the nature of cell reactions, the type of 
 reactions characteristically part of the living pattern can 
 be discerned from the studies of metabolic pathways. There 
 are, to my mind, three such types of reactions which are 
 particularly important, since they are characteristic of the 
 living chemistry. The first is the predominance of group 
 transfer. The second is the organization into reaction se- 
 quences of fixed order, some of which are cyclic, others not. 
 The third is the competitive pattern of such reactions or 
 reaction sequences. To the best of my knowledge, these 
 three characteristic metabolic reactions occur in any living 
 cell, and are not unique to the microbe. We shall post- 
 pone, for the moment, a consideration of the important 
 and distinct role that microbiology has played in the ac- 
 cumulation of this knowledge until we have considered 
 the knowledge itself, and where possible, its significance 
 for the understanding of the living process. 

It seems probable to me that a great deal of the chem- 
 istry of the cell is conducted by way of group transfer and 
 exchange. The pattern which I feel is emerging is that 
 there is de novo synthesis of relatively few structural types 
 and that from this stage on, the entire structure or critical 
 portions thereof are moved from one combination into 
 another. The now classical cases of group transfer — methyl, 
 acetyl, amino, guanido, and saccharide groups — are but 
 the beginning; and transpeptidation, transamidation, and 
 the exchange of bases by the desoxyribosides are reflections 
 of a basic metabolic mechanism that we may reasonably ex- 
 pect to be employed in even more complex reactions. 

This mechanism of group transfer would seem to repre-
