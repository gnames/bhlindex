Metabolic Pafhways 105 

Crete, capable of easy branching and alteration as circum- 
 stances require. But so far as I am able to judge, the meta- 
 bolic pathways of the living cell are rigid and enclosed. 
 The plasticity characteristic of life, and the adaptive abili- 
 ties, are more a matter of substituting pathways, and com- 
 petition between them, than a matter of alteration in a 
 fixed order reaction sequence. I admit that this too-rigid 
 mechanistic view is not a very satisfying one, but I am 
 afraid it is correct. In the long view, it is not surprising; 
 after all, the mechanics of muscular movement in our 
 bodies have not changed for at least 10,000 years. Why 
 expect even more fundamental mechanisms, those of chem- 
 ical transformations, or energy release, to be any more 
 fluid? 

These pathways are usually so constructed that they are 
 self-limiting. I suppose the engineer would call these feed- 
 back mechanisms. The word itself has no particular mean- 
 ing to me, and I prefer the term "self-limiting." The 
 Meyerhof-Embden system, for example, requires both 
 adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (at its start) and adenylic 
 acid (beyond the triose phosphate stage), and will stop if 
 all the adenylic is converted into ATP. The same is true 
 for inorganic phosphate. 

In addition, there are ''cyclic" processes — as occur in the 
 citric acid cycle, the urea cycle, the fatty acid cycle, or the 
 choline cycle — and they are all constructed so that the rate 
 at which the cycle proceeds is dependent not only upon 
 substrate, but upon what one might call built-in controls. 
 The element of control in such self-limiting systems is 
 exerted by a second factor, also self-limiting, namely, series 
 or product inhibition. The clearest example is the fact 
 that oxalacetate is one of the most potent inhibitors of 
 succinoxidase known. In the reaction series succinate to 
 fumarate to malate to oxalacetate, the oxalacetate must be 
 removed or the series will stop. In brief, there are, in the 
 fixed series metabolic pathways, two factors of control:
