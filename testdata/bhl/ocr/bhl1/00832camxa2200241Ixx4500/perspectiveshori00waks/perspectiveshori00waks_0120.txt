self-limiting reactions and series inhibition, which require 
 that the cell operate its reaction pathways essentially one 
 molecule at a time. This molecule-at-a-time requirement 
 permits the free play of the third characteristic factor of 
 the living process, that of competition. There are in every 
 cell alternative pathways that may be followed by a given 
 molecule. Whether a given molecule of glucose-6-phos- 
 phate is converted to fructose-6-phosphate, to phospho- 
 gluconic acid, to glucose- 1 -phosphate, or to glucose plus 
 phosphate, which step determines its subsequent fate, 
 depends on circumstances within the cell. 

That such competition may be the controlling factor in 
 cell growth and development was forcibly impressed upon 
 us in studies on the mode of action of streptomycin. Here 
 the resting cells possessed what appeared to be a typical 
 citric acid cycle, and it was entrance into this cycle that 
 was inhibited by streptomycin. Further study showed that 
 the citric acid cycle was indeed present but that it was not 
 sensitive to streptomycin. Rather, there existed side by 
 side with the citric acid cycle a hitherto unknown reaction 
 sequence, the first step of which was the formation of a 
 seven-carbon phosphorylated intermediate. This alterna- 
 tive sequence apparently started from the same materials, 
 was in competition with the citric acid cycle for these sub- 
 stances, and led eventually, but by different paths, to the 
 same carbon dioxide and water. Along the alternative 
 route, however, there must be something that the cell re- 
 quired, since this alternative pathway was originally recog- 
 nized only by its inhibition by streptomycin, and since, 
 when it was inhibited, the cell could not grow. 

It seems to me, therefore, that the studies of metabolic 
 pathways have told us the following things about the living 
 process in whatever cells we may find it: First, that the re- 
 actions occur at and because of specific surfaces. Second, 
 these reactions are characterized by: (a) predominance of 
 group transfer; (b) organization into reaction sequences
