of a fixed order; and (c) competition between alternative 
 pathways. 

One more factor should be added. Granting that there 
 are reaction sequences of such a nature that the first step 
 of what happens to a substance determines, for a long path 
 thereafter, what must subsequently happen to it; granting 
 that competition between alternative pathways exists, it 
 follows that the competitive sites are not critical at each 
 reaction step but only at points where fixed path reaction 
 sequences cross. That is, one has lines of metabolism, but 
 at points where these lines cross — at the nexus or node, as 
 it were — there the competitive forces exert their far-reach- 
 ing effect. 

One further question may now be asked of Nature: Are 
 the lines or paths of metabolism many or few? Of the 
 thousands of substances acted upon by the living cell, are 
 there thousands of pathways? The experimental answer is: 
 there are few. Not just one, but a few. There are not a 
 thousand paths from glucose to pyruvate, but there is more 
 than one — three, perhaps five, but no more. The main 
 lines of metabolism of carbohydrate, for example, are no 
 more than perhaps ten at the most. The degradation of an 
 array of substances, at first sight utterly dissimilar, eventu- 
 ally proceeds through the same central intermediary metab- 
 olites. The shoes, the ships, the sealing wax, degrade, in 
 principle, through one or another of the major pathways, 
 and their breakdown is not different from that of sugar 
 and spice; only the early enzymatic maneuvers have to be 
 slightly different. 

With synthesis, it may be otherwise, but we suspect not. 
 In fact, one may propose that synthesis begins at such 
 crossroads of metabolic paths. In short, there is a certain 
 unity of process in all living forms; not identity, but not 
 wholesale diversity. In a sense, life has been fashioned, not 
 from an identical mold but from a mold designed by the 
 same craftsman using the same tools in the same way. It is
