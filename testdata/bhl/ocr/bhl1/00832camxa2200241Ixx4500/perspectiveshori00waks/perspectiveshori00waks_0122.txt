108 Perspecfives in Microbiology

 tomorrow a pitcher; the shape varies, the structure alters 
 to serve function more closely, but the same clay has been 
 turned on the same wheel with the same immeasurable

ConfrJbufions of Microbiology fo Mefabolic Studies 

Microbiology has played a unique and significant role 
 in the acquisition of this knowledge of metabolic pathways 
 and will continue to provide the essential portion of the 
 metabolic information. This fact arises because of two 
 characteristics of microbial metabolism. Because these are 
 sometimes not recognized, we feel it of interest to point 
 them out, since they are, in fact, almost the unique contri- 
 bution of microbiology to the subject of metabolic path- 
 ways. 

The first point is that microorganisms by their very 
 variety provide the necessary tools for such study. Consider- 
 ing an array of organisms that are distinguished by bac- 
 teriological and physiological methods, which is indeed 
 why we know that they are different organisms, metabolic 
 study shows that each is not a separate, unique, metabolic 
 system. Rather, the metabolism of each type of organism is 
 composed, in different proportions, of familiar metabolic 
 pathways; and, of course, of some as yet unknown to us. 
 The relative predominance of each pathway may be altered 
 in a given organism, both by culture conditions and by 
 genetic pattern. There is, among organisms, a certain over- 
 lap, but by the selection of extremes for study one may 
 obtain organisms predominantly of one pathway, as com- 
 pared to others; and thus we may achieve separation of 
 systems, frequently long before their nature is known. 
 Thus it becomes possible to study separate systems and 
 trace predominant metabolic pathways. Additional tech- 
 niques of such selection â€” simultaneous adaptation and
