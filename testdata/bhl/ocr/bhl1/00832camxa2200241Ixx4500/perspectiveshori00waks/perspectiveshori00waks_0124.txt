Pathways in Biological 
 Nitrogen Fixation 

By PERRY W. WILSON 

Modern researches dealing with the chemi- 
 cal and enzymatic mechanisms of the process of biological 
 nitrogen fixation have been thoroughly summarized, re- 
 viewed, compared biochemically, and reappraised in re- 
 cent years (16, 17, 18). This paper is concerned, therefore, 
 not with chemical or enzymatic pathways, but with the 
 research pathways explored by investigators in this field 
 during the last quarter century. An examination of such 
 pathways may be instructive if they lead upward toward 
 greater understanding, as I hope they do, or amusing if 
 they lead toward even more confusion, as some of you may 
 suspect. 

The manner in which research in this field has been 
 directed and controlled by the techniques available to the 
 investigator is impressive. In retrospect, it is a little shock- 
 ing to realize that a case at least can be made for the thesis 
 that we have been almost prisoners of our methods, and
