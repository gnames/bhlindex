Biological Nitrogen Fixation 111 

that our successes, if any, reflect only the inevitability of 
 achieving them, once we entered the groove dictated by 
 the techniques. Even worse, these techniques for the most 
 part represent just about the only ones that could have 
 been used, so that the major contribution of the workers 
 in this field has been to provide the hands (or should I 
 say the feet?) to follow the path that led to a fertile area 
 for exploration. Such a point of view implies no criticism 
 of the investigators, for it is recognized that once an area 
 was discovered they exhibited considerable diligence in 
 its cultivation. This paper provides a few examples from 
 the studies directed toward investigation of the chemical 
 and enzymatic pathways that in one way or another illus- 
 trate this thesis. 

Case History I, Excretion of Chemical Intermediates 

It is appropriate that the first example should deal with 
 excretion of chemical intermediates, since the initial ex- 
 periments that led to this technique were made by Jacob 
 Lipman at the New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Sta- 
 tion. 

Let us consider the apparatus and methodology avail- 
 able to the plant physiologist in the earlier 1900's. Figure 
 1 illustrates the basic equipment used by Lipman (7). Ac- 
 cording to modern standards, it is not impressive; it con- 
 sists primarily of clay pots in which to grow plants. The 
 development of such plants could be conveniently esti- 
 mated by merely looking at them, but if the investigator 
 really wanted to be scientific, he could weigh the plants 
 or even determine total nitrogen. But if the apparatus 
 available consists of clay pots, one makes experiments in 
 clay pots. Lipman's experiments included some in which 
 leguminous plants such as peas and vetch were grown with 
 nonleguminous plants such as oats and rye. The white 
 sand used as substrate was supplied with all plant nutrients
