Biological Nitrogen Fixation 113 

tion (15), or to discuss the amicable outcome of that dis- 
 agieement. The important points to emphasize here are: 
 (a) the type of experiment that led to the discovery of ex- 
 cretion was implicit in the extremely primitive apparatus 
 a plant physiologist ordinarily worked with even as late 
 as twenty-five years ago; and (b) the exploitation of the 
 discovery by Virtanen and his collaborators through de- 
 velopment of a more ingenious technique was a noteworthy 
 triumph not to be overlooked. In comparison with modern 
 methods, the tool they forged may look disarmingly frail 
 for the task assigned, but it was a considerable advance 
 over anything else available at the time. 

Case History II. Iniiial Studies on Enzymafic 
 Pathways 

Studies at the University of Wisconsin at this time had 
 taken an entirely different direction both in technique 
 and goal. Impressed with the success of the microrespi- 
 rometer recently introduced by Warburg and Barcroft for 
 the study of enzyme mechanisms, and following the lead 
 of Meyerhof and Burk in applying this instrument to 
 biological nitrogen fixation, we attempted to study the 
 properties of the enzyme system responsible for nitrogen 
 fixation in red clover. Our version of a ''Warburg" ap- 
 paratus for study of plants is shown in Figure 3. Red clover 
 plants were grown in nine-liter Pyrex bottles on sand pro- 
 vided with the usual plant nutrients except combined 
 nitrogen. The bottles were fitted with appropriate acces- 
 sories so that the gas atmosphere furnished the plants was 
 controlled. Some plants were inoculated with the proper 
 bacteria and thus depended on nitrogen fixation for their 
 development; control plants were furnished ammonium-N 
 or nitrate-N. During the summer months when the plants 
 grew best, temperature was regulated by keeping the 
 bottles in a wooden "bath" through which water flowed.
