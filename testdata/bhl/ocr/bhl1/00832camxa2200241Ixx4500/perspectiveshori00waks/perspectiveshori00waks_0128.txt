114 Perspectives in Microbiology 

Using this equipment, we studied the effect of PCO2, PO2, 
 and pN2 on the rate of nitrogen fixation. 

This apparatus was admittedly crude, but it had one 
 virtue — it required considerable volumes of gases, so when 
 a gas was required to fill out a particular mixture being 
 studied, H2 was the natural choice because it was the 
 cheapest. This choice of diluent gas was a happy one, for 
 which we cannot claim any credit, as it was forced upon 
 us by the method used. In one trial, the tank of H2 became 
 empty just as the experiment was begun; for several days, 
 it was necessarily continued without the use of a diluent 
 gas until a new tank was delivered. Fortunately, this was 
 delayed, and since the response of the plants appeared to 
 be different without the Ho, the experiment was completed 
 without diluent gas. The results were unequivocal — the 
 plants fixed nitrogen better in the absence of H2. Through 
 the courtesy of Professor Roebuck in the physics depart- 
 ment we were given a tank of helium, which was difficult 
 to obtain at that time. The necessary crucial experiment 
 in which Ho and He were compared as the diluent gas 
 demonstrated that H2, far from being an inert gas, defi- 
 nitely inhibited nitrogen fixation in red clover plants. 
 Further studies provided evidence that this inhibition was 
 competitive (15). 

Once again, fullest exploitation of this new tool of re- 
 search necessitated the forging of a sharper instrument; 
 this was accomplished when the finding was extended to 
 fixation of nitrogen by Azotobacter (20). Then, studies on 
 the enzyme system employing H2 as a specific inhibitor 
 could be made with the more precise microrespirometer 
 technique. Not only has this particular tool been valuable 
 for exploring the enzymatic system responsible for fixa- 
 tion of nitrogen, but also it has led to investigations that 
 have made significant contributions to our knowledge of 
 the enzyme hydrogenase (3, 5, 11). Finally, it has been di- 
 rectly concerned with uncovering several new agents of
