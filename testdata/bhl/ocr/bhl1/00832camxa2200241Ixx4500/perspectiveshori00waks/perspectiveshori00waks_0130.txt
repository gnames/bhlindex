116 Perspectives in Microbiology 

tion to biological investigations, including nitrogen fixa- 
 tion. Among these were superior methods for cultivation 
 of microorganisms, especially aerobes, resulting from the 
 researches on antibiotics; superior methods for isolation 
 and identification of organic compounds by use of paper 
 and column chromatography; and, in particular, superior 
 methods for tracer studies because of the availability of 
 labeled molecules with appropriate instruments for their 
 estimation. 

Let us look along the research pathway, and with hind- 
 sight put in the record knowledge of which at the time we 
 were only dimly aware. The new instruments were of in- 
 terest not only because they were a powerful and sensitive 
 tool but also because they profoundly affected our thinking 
 about the type of evidence necessary to establish a biolog- 
 ical mechanism and resulted in a much closer scrutiny of 
 the foundations of the logic of our experiments (1). They 
 were even to determine the type of research we would do, 
 for obviously with such bright and shiny tools as these, we 
 would tailor our problems to make use of them. So at 
 Madison we dropped our investigations of the enzyme 
 mechanisms and concentrated on biochemical steps in the 
 pathway. Figure 4, illustrating typical apparatus used for 
 such studies, is included as a reminder of how much the 
 instruments we use today are derived from the physical- 
 chemical laboratory rather than the biological. Many of 
 these powerful new techniques have become so common- 
 place that it is sometimes overlooked that the workers of 
 yesterday were bold enough to challenge nature without 
 them. 

Using these recently discovered jinn of the scientific 
 lamp, we compared the biochemistry of the nitrogen fixa- 
 tion process in different agents and obtained several lines 
 of indirect evidence that NH3 and not NH2OH was the 
 end product of the fixation process (16). The ammonia 
 then apparently entered into the amino acid pool by the
