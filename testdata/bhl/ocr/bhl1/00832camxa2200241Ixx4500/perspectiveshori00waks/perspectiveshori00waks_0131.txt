Biological Nitrogen Fixation 117 

conventional reactions, such as reductive assimilation and 
 transamination. But direct evidence for NH3 eluded us 
 until just a few years ago when we began the tracer studies 
 on Clostridium pasteurianum. Traditionally, this organism 
 is a sluggish fixer and was believed to be both inefficient 
 and slow. But a study of its physiology and the employment 
 of modern methods of culture (for example, shake flasks) 
 demonstrated that fixation by this organism was almost as 
 good as by Azotohacter (10). 

When both the rate and the extent of fixation by the 
 Clostridia had been thus increased, the organism excreted 
 large quantities of ammonia into the medium — it seemed 
 that a medium good enough for a sluggish fixer w^as defi- 
 cient for this new intensive mode of life. The organism 
 apparently was fixing nitrogen more rapidly than it could 
 be assimilated and was discarding the excess into the 
 medium (10). This was direct evidence for ammonia as the 
 end product of fixation, provided that the excreted am- 
 monia could be demonstrated to be "juvenile" nitrogen — 
 recently fixed, and not merely breakdown products of the 
 cells. Before the time of isotopic tracing, this would have 
 been a difficult assignment, but now it was readily tested 
 by employing labeled N2^^. Since the excreted ammonia-N 
 was considerably higher in its level of tracer than any other 
 compound found, and was followed by substances such as 
 amides, known to be storage compounds for ammonia, it 
 was concluded that this provided the long-sought-for isola- 
 tion of the key intermediate in biological nitrogen fixation 

(21). 

Our satisfaction with this result was somewhat allayed by 
 the fact that we could not repeat it with Azotobacter. This 
 organism would not excrete nitrogenous compounds in 
 spite of all our efforts; the growth of the cell apparently 
 always keeps ahead of its rate of fixation. Somewhat in 
 desperation, the isotopic dilution method was tried — a 
 method in which we did not have much hope, since it re-
