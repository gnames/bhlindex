quires for success that an external source of nitrogen come 
 into some sort of equilibrium with its opposite number 
 inside the cell or even in an enzyme reaction chain. Often, 
 such equilibration does not occur, so if a negative result is 
 obtained it may not mean much; but, to our surprise, it 
 succeeded (8). Azotobacter cells fixing ordinary N2 were 
 furnished with a small external supply of labeled ammonia; 
 at intervals, aliquots were taken and the level of N^^ de-

termined. As shown in table I, the label in the external 
 source of nitrogen decreased rapidly and steadily, indicat- 
 ing that it was equilibrating, with N^*H4+ appearing as 
 a result of fixation. Likewise, when supplied N2-^^, the 
 organism equilibrated fixed N^^H4+ with an external 
 source of N^^H4+. Although not so clear-cut evidence as 
 that obtained with C. pasteurianum, it is a welcome addi- 
 tion to the several other types of findings that implicate
