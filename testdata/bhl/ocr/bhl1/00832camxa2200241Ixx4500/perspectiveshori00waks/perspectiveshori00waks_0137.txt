Biological Nitrogen Fixation 119 

In leaving this example, once again note that a new 
 method suggested by the advances made in our knowledge 
 of bacterial physiology sooner or later would be applied 
 to the Clostridia. Once this was done, the conditions inevi- 
 tably would be discovered that enabled us to use nature's 
 own method — excretion — for isolating the sought-for in- 
 termediate. The extension to Azotobacter represents only 
 the introduction of a somewhat more subtle technique to 
 exploit the finding further. 

I could cite other case histories from our experience that 
 would illustrate my argument, but I suspect that by this 
 time you are probably recalling some from your own in- 
 vestigations, either in support of or against my thesis. What 
 remains is to draw some suitable conclusion from this sur- 
 vey of the pathways we have used in the past quarter cen- 
 tury. Although we might not agree that these roads have 
 led anywhere in particular, I am sure that none would dis- 
 pute that, at least in the way of complicated apparatus, we 
 have traveled far since Lipman first inserted an unglazed 
 pot inside a glazed one.
