Vercellone (14) first reported the reduction of a nuclear 
 double bond or ketone group, as well as oxidation of a 
 nuclear hydroxyl group. This work was confirmed and ex-

tended by many other investigators (36). Turfitt (34) 
 showed that cholestenone (II) could be degraded to etio- 
 cholenic acid (III) as well as isocaproic acid (IV) and the 
 Windaus keto acid (V) by means of a Proactinomyces.

Kramli and Horvath (12) were the first to report micro- 
 biological oxygenation of a nuclear carbon atom (position 
 7 of the cholesterol (VI) molecule), also by use of a Pro- 
 actinomyceSj to produce 7-hydroxycholesterol (VII).
