of the drug to the patient was prohibitive and cheaper 
 methods for its synthesis were imperative. 

The basic structural requirements of steroids necessary 
 for the biological responses observed clinically in rheuma- 
 toid arthritis to date are found only in cortisone (VIII) 
 and hydrocortisone (IX) or their derivatives. 

In view of the many complex chemical reactions per- 
 formed by microorganisms, it was hoped that a microbio- 
 logical approach might lead to a simpler method. Such a 
 method might introduce oxygen into the critical 11 -posi- 
 tion of readily available steroids to produce cortisone 
 (VIII) and hydrocortisone (IX) directly or to produce 
 II -oxygenated intermediates which could then be readily 
 converted to these important compounds (VIII and IX) 
 by chemical methods. 

The microbiological oxygenation of steroids at nuclear 
 positions other than 7 was first reported from our labora- 
 ties (29) in 1952. That report outlined a one-step method 
 for the introduction of oxygen into the strategic carbon 
 1 1 position by fungi of the order Mucorales, and more spe- 
 cifically, described the bioconversion of progesterone (XI) 
 to a new compound lla-hydroxyprogesterone (XII). Con- 
 firmation of this work was obtained by Mancera et al. (15) 
 and by Kahnt et al. (11). Fried and co-workers (5) inde- 
 pendently reported 11 -oxygenation of steroids by an 
 Aspergillus (Wisconsin strain) (21, 23). Colingsworth et al. 
 (1, 7) showed that Reichstein's compound S (XIII) could 
 be converted to hydrocortisone by Streptomyces fradiae. 
 Further confirmation of this type of transformation was ob-
