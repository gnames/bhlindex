tained by Hanson et al. (8), employing Cunninghamella, 
 and later by Shull et al. (33) using a Curvularia. Thus, 
 in contrast to the many steps required by the chemist to 
 introduce the important 11 -oxygen atom, certain fungi 
 produce 11 -oxygenated steroids in a one-step process from 
 readily available steroidal substrates having no special fea- 
 tures in the 11 or 12 positions. 

Compound XII (lla-hydroxyprogesterone) can be 
 readily and economically converted to cortisone (VIII) 
 (15, 26) or hydrocortisone (IX) (13). 

Extensive work by our laboratories (3, 21, 30) and by 
 Fried et al. (5) showed that many different substrates could 
 be oxygenated not only at carbon 11 but also in other 
 nuclear positions.

Next to the 11 -oxygen function, the 17a-hydroxyl group 
 of the adrenal hormones is the most difficult to introduce 
 chemically, particularly in the presence of a 3-keto-A*- 
 system. We have recently found that the mold Cephalothe- 
 cium (20) can hydroxylate steroids in this position. This is 
 the first report of 17-hydroxylation of steroids by micro- 
 organisms. Other hydroxylating enzymes, 6(3- and 11a-, for 
 example, are also produced by this mold, so that from a 
 single fermentation various combinations of dihydroxyl-
