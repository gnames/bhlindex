ated compounds are also formed. Thus, for example, des- 
 oxycorticosterone (XIV) can be converted directly to 
 epihydrocortisone (XV), a compound which can be readily 
 oxidized to cortisone. Other compounds formed in this 
 bioconversion are 6(3,17a,21-trihydroxy-4-pregnene-3,20- 
 dione (XVI), Reichstein's compound S (XIII), epicortico- 
 sterone (XVII), and 6p-hydroxy-ll-desoxycorticosterone 
 (XVIII).

Obviously, a combination of chemical and microbiologi- 
 cal reactions can be integrated into various synthetic pro- 
 cedures for the preparation of cortisone and hydrocortisone. 
 The final choice as to the best production method depends 
 upon the economics of the starting materials and the 
 efficiency of the processes involved.
