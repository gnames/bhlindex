Cleavage of the Side Chain and Oxygenation of the 
 Nucleus. With progesterone (XI) Gliocladium catenu- 
 latum also produces 6p-hydroxy-4-androstene-3, 17-dione 
 (XX) (28). 

Cleavage of the Side Chain and Fission of Ring D. With 
 compounds XI, XIII, XIV, and XXI the side chain is re- 
 moved by certain fungi of the Asperigillus and Penicillium 
 groups (28). In these cases ring D is transformed into a 
 lactone to give testololactone (XXII).

DEHYDROGENATION OF RING A AND CLEAVAGE OF CARBON 
 TO CARBON SIDE CHAIN 

Streptomyces lavendulae, as shown by Fried et al. (6), 
 and certain Fusarium species, as reported by Vischer and 
 Wettstein (35), are capable of degrading the side chain and 
 dehydrogenating ring A in compounds like progesterone 
 (XI), desoxycorticosterone (XIV), and other steroids to pro- 
 duce l,4-androstadiene-3, 17-dione (XXIII). (This com- 
 pound can then be easily transformed to estrone [XXIV], 
 an estrogenic hormone, by pyrolysis [Inhoffen reaction].)
