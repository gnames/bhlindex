This work has been repeated and extended to other sub- 
 strates and other microorganisms by several different in- 
 vestigators, including Ercoli, Arnaudi, Molina, Turfitt, 
 Welsch and Huesghem, Zimmerman, Hughes and Schmitt 
 (36), and by Perlman et al. (24). 

REDUCTION REACTIONS 

Ring Double Bonds. While the bio-oxygenation of com- 
 pounds XI and XIII by Rhizopus produces excellent yields 
 of XII and XV, a reduction of the AMouble bond occurs 
 concomitantly to a minor degree. Thus, from progesterone 
 (XI) the 5a-stereoisomer (XXVIII) is formed, whereas 
 from Reichstein's compound S (XIII) the 5p-isomer 

(XXIX) is obtained (27, 30). Perlman, Titus, and Fried 
 (25) have shown that a 5P-stereoisomeric derivative 

(XXX) is formed concomitantly with 1 6a-hydroxylation 
 by fermentation of progesterone (XI) with an actino- 
 mycete. 

The A^^-double bond of 1 6-dehydroprogesterone (XXXI) 
 is specifically reduced in major quantities by Rhizopus 
 without altering the AMouble bond, and the configura- 
 tion of the side chain in the resulting compound (XXXII) 
 is the opposite from that occurring naturally (18). An 11a- 
 hydroxyl group is also introduced as the result of this fer- 
 mentation. Reduction of the AMouble bond by yeast was 
 accomplished as early as 1937 (14).
