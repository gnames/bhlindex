Reduction of Nuclear Ketone Groups. Mamoli and 
 Vercellone (14) first showed that nuclear ketone groups 
 could be reduced by fermenting yeast and, by this method, 
 steroids such as androstenedione (XVII) could be con- 
 verted to testosterone (XXIII). This work has been ex- 
 tended by others (36). 

Reduction of Side-Chain Ketone and Aldehyde Groups.
