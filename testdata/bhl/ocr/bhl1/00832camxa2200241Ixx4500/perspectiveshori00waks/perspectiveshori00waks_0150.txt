progesterone (XI) is partly reduced to 20p-hydroxy-4- 
 pregnene-3-one (XXXIII) by Streptomyces lavendulae, and 
 work in our laboratories (32) has shown that an actinomy- 
 cete reduces the 20-ketone group of desoxycorticosterone 
 (XVI) to 20a,21-dihydroxy-4-pregnene-3-one (XXXIV).

When 3-ketobisnor-4-cholene-22-al (XXXV) is exposed 
 to Rhizopus nigricans, the aldehyde group is reduced to a 
 primary alcohol and an lla-hydroxyl group is also intro- 
 duced (17). The resulting compound is 3-ketobisnor-4- 
 cholene-lla,22-diol (XXXVI).

Many of the reactions mentioned in this paper are at 
 present extremely difficult to carry out by chemical means, 
 and yet enzymatically these fungi encounter no difficulty 
 in performing the desired reaction. 

Several of these microorganisms have been so well 
 charted in regard to their enzyme systems that not only can 
 they be used for preparative purposes, but also they can 
 be employed to determine chemical structure of certain 
 steroids. For example, when progesterone (XI) is converted 
 to lla-hydroxy-progesterone (XII), a dihydroxyprogester- 
 one (XXXVII) is formed (13) as a by-product, which was
