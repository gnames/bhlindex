 respects to the dihydroxy-compound isolated from the 
 fermentation of progesterone, thus unequivocally proving 
 the structure as indicated in formula XXXVII. 

In a second case, the structure (16) of 14a-hydroxy- 
 progesterone (XXXVIII), obtained by incubation of pro- 
 gesterone with the Mucorales, was determined by oxidiz- 
 ing the side chain of compound XXXVIII with Penicillium 
 lilacinum Thom. The resulting compound is the known 
 14a-hydroxy-4-androstene-3,17-dione (XXXIX). The struc- 
 ture proof of this steroid by chemical means would be ex- 
 tremely laborious and difficult. 

Summary 

In summary, major emphasis has been placed upon the 
 facile and economical preparation of biologically interest- 
 ing steroids. Cortisone, hydrocortisone, estrone, and testo-
