134 Perspecfives in Microbiology 

malian tissue, can now be more readily prepared by the use 
 of certain fungal and bacterial enzymes integrated with a 
 series of chemical transformations. Thus, many complex 
 problems in steroid organic chemistry have been success- 
 fully resolved by application of microbiology. 

Many challenging problems in this field remain; for 
 example, the mechanism by which the enzymes carry out 
 these transformations must still be unfolded. Hayano (9) 
 recently presented evidence which shows that in the adrenal 
 enzyme system dehydrogenation is not an intermediate step 
 in llp-hydroxylation. 

Further applications of microbiology will unquestion- 
 ably help in the preparation of new steroids that are diffi- 
 cult to synthesize chemically. Undoubtedly, the general 
 field of the microbiological transformation of organic com- 
 pounds will be widely exploited, and in this respect one can 
 anticipate many new and fascinating developments. 
 Possibilities also lie ahead in the discovery of new types of 
 microbiological reactions which then can be further ap- 
 plied to difficult problems in the field of organic chemistry.
