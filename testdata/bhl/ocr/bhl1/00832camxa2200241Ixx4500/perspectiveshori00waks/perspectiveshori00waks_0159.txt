Some Unsolved Problems in 
 Immunology 

By MICHAEL HEIDELBERGER 

It is always a grateful task to discuss the un- 
 answered riddles of a science. Not only are these far more 
 numerous than the puzzles that have been solved, but the 
 relatively retarded knowledge of the unsolved mysteries 
 permits one to cast aside the customary restraints of cau- 
 tion, give rein to one's imagination, and fondly suppose 
 that the resulting beams of light will illumine wide corners 
 rather than lose themselves in the murk. Let us, therefore, 
 hopefully select a few outstanding problems in immu- 
 nology. 

Where and how are antibodies formed? There are clues 
 and there are theories, but the latter lack experimental 
 basis. 

What are the relationships between chemical constitu- 
 tion and immunological specificity? The pioneering studies 
 of Landsteiner covered the broad range of organic chem- 
 istry and posed the problem of the natural antigens in a
