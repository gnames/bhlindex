stantial evidence that the macrophages were involved, for 
 these cells took up the dye particles and then began shed- 
 ding surface films at about the time antibodies first ap- 
 peared. After McMaster's study of typhoid bacilli injected 
 into the lymph nodes, Ehrich, Harris, Dougherty, White, 
 and others experimented widely and demonstrated a con- 
 nection of lymphocytes with antibody formation, although 
 it was never certain what relation lymphocytic antibodies 
 bore to antibody production as a whole. Finally, a group 
 of Scandinavian workers proposed the plasma cell as the 
 primary synthesizer of antibodies. Following their lead, 
 Astrid Fagraeus devised ingenious experiments that ap- 
 peared to confirm the important role of these cells. The 
 issue, however, is somewhat beclouded by the failure of 
 cytologists to agree upon a definition of the plasma cell, 
 so that this aspect of the formation of antibodies is still not 
 fully solved. 

Neither have we advanced far in our knowledge of the 
 mechanism of the formation of antibodies. According to 
 the theory of Breinl-Haurowitz-Alexander-Mudd-Pauling, 
 an antigen or an active fragment penetrates to the as yet 
 uncertain sites of globulin formation and there, by its 
 presence, so distorts the newly synthesized globulins that 
 they are subsequently able to combine with the homolog- 
 ous antigen, when and if again in contact with it. The 
 Burnet theory, on the other hand, postulates an influence 
 of the antigen on the framework or enzyme systems through 
 which the globulins are built up â€” a modification which 
 persists as a kind of ''training," and so may explain the 
 more rapid secondary response following the reinjection 
 of certain antigens. I have discussed these theories in 
 greater detail elsewhere and have pointed out that the 
 Breinl-Haurowitz theory satisfactorily covers the behavior 
 of antibodies to pneumococcal carbohydrates in man, while 
 the Burnet hypothesis offers advantages in the description 
 of the behavior of antibodies to a protein such as diph-
