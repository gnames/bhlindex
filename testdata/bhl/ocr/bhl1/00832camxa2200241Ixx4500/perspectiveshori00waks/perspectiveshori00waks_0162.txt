144 Perspectives in Microbiology 

theria toxin. Both theories represent triumphs of the bril- 
 liant imaginations of their authors and are compatible with 
 large bodies of existing data. Decisive experiments in favor 
 of one mechanism or the other, or even an alternative proc- 
 ess, are, however, yet to be devised and are urgently 
 needed. 

Antibodies may also be considered for a moment as an 
 introduction to the topic of chemical constitution and im- 
 munological specificity. Since all efforts have failed to 
 demonstrate differences between normal globulins and 
 antibodies in physical, chemical, or immunological prop- 
 erties other than the capacity to combine with an antigen, 
 Pauling's hypothesis of a difference in folding of the 
 polypeptide chains has gained acceptance by default. New 
 techniques and new experiments are needed in this diffi- 
 cult area. 

Specif! CI fies of Protein Antigens 

Nor is the question of the specificities of protein anti- 
 gens in a more satisfactory state. The new methods for the 
 determination of terminal amino acids and their immedi- 
 ate neighbors in the peptide chains of proteins, though 
 laborious, offer hope that the fine structures of the smaller 
 proteins, at least, will eventually be worked out. Until this 
 is done, scarcely anything definitive can be said to relate 
 chemical structure to the specificity of proteins. True, the 
 wide difference in specificities between native and dena- 
 tured egg albumin, for example, tells us that in the native 
 protein outcroppings of adjacent peptide chains, or clus- 
 ters of amino acids, probably constitute specific groupings 
 that are altered when their arrangement is dispersed by 
 the unfolding characteristic of denaturation. Paul Maurer 
 has also shown that in the same protein, crystalline chicken 
 egg albumin, about one quarter of the free amino groups 
 may be removed without measurable change in immuno-
