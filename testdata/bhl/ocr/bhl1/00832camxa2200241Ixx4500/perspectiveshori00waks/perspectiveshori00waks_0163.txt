Problems in Immunology 145 

logical specificity even by sensitive quantitative techniques, 
 although some physical properties are markedly altered by 
 removal of the basic groups. But these are merely super- 
 ficial skirmishings and serve only to emphasize the magni- 
 tude of the main problem. 

Immunology of Carbohydrates 

We are, however, not so helpless in dealing with another 
 large chemical group, the carbohydrates. In discussing the 
 immunology of these substances, it was at first necessary to 
 restrict oneself to the bacterial polysaccharides, such as 
 those of pneumococcus. Owing to the vision of Oswald T. 
 Avery, however, it was soon found that various plant gums, 
 notably gum arable and its product of partial hydrolysis, 
 were capable of reacting with certain pneumococcal anti- 
 bodies, with the formation of precipitates. The recent dis- 
 covery that glycogen gives similar precipitates in a number 
 of antipneumococcus sera makes it evident that every 
 carbohydrate is potentially immunologically specific. The 
 immunological reactivity of glycogen is all the more re- 
 markable since this substance is a normal synthetic product 
 of all animals, and hence, according to classical immuno- 
 logical theory, should not take part in immune reactions. 

Because the chemistry of the carbohydrates is in a more 
 advanced state than that of the proteins, and because the 
 methods used for the determination of fine structure are 
 not excessively laborious, it has been possible to make 
 several instructive correlations between chemical constitu- 
 tion and immunological specificity among these sugar de- 
 rivatives. 

The first instance in which this could be done followed 
 the demonstration by Goebel and his co-workers that the 
 specific capsular polysaccharide of Type III pneumococcus 
 was a polycellobiuronic acid and that the cross reaction 
 with Type VIII was due to the presence in the Type VIII
