polysaccharide of the same cellobiuronic acid. There was, 
 however, no "antigen in common," as the microbiologist 
 is wont to say in reference to cross reactions â€” only a chem- 
 ical grouping in common, for the Type VIII specific sub- 
 stance contains glucose in addition. The quantitative as- 
 pects of this reaction were carefully studied in our labora- 
 tory, and as a result, when cotton was oxidized to a poly- 
 cellobiuronic acid, it could be predicted that this new sub- 
 stance, soluble cotton, would turn out to be an immuno- 
 logically specific polysaccharide reactive with Type III and 
 Type VIII antipneumococcus sera. When Stacey isolated 
 a polysaccharide containing multiple cellobiuronic acid 
 groupings from Rhizobium radicicolum, this substance was 
 also found to react with Type III antiserum. The relation 
 between chemical constitution and the immunological re- 
 activity of the Type Ill-Type VIII pneumococcus group has 
 therefore been fairly well cleared up as far as the common 
 component, cellobiuronic acid, is concerned. The precise 
 function and points of attachment of the additional glucose 
 radicals in the Type VIII substance remain unresolved. 

Another immunologically cross reactive group of wide 
 occurrence might be termed the polyglucose group. Not 
 only do the dextrans formed by various Leuconostoc species 
 give cross reactions in a number of antipneumococcus and 
 antityphoid antisera, as shown many years ago by Zozaya 
 and Neill and Hehre, but these substances have been 
 found by Kabat to be antigenic in man. Depending upon 
 the synthesizing strain, dextrans contain glucose in a-1,6 
 linkage, with varying proportions of 1,4 linkages and, to 
 a smaller extent, 1,3 links. Some of the synthetic polyglu- 
 coses show a serological reactivity in antipneumococcal 
 sera much like that of the dextrans, which is not surpris- 
 ing since Pacsu has found that the synthetic products also 
 contain 1,6 and 1,4 linkages. 

A chemical clue to the nature of polyglucose specificities 
 was supplied by Stacey's report that all of the 30 per cent
