of glucose in the specific polysaccharide of Type II pneu- 
 mococcus was in the form of 1,4,6-branch points. This 
 not only accounted for the cross reactions of the poly- 
 glucoses in Type II antiserum, but also led to our dis- 
 covery of the serological activity of glycogen and amylopec- 
 tin, both of which contain 1,4,6-branch points of glucose. 
 But the cross reactivities of the polyglucoses in Types VII, 
 IX, XII, XX, and XXII antipneumococcal sera remain 
 unexplained, since we do not even know the component 
 sugars in the specific polysaccharides of these pneumococ- 
 cal types, let alone their linkages. Knowledge of the reac- 
 tion in Type XVIII antiserum is not quite so limited, for 
 Markowitz and I have shown that the specific polysac- 
 charide of this pneumococcal type consists mainly of glu- 
 cose, with smaller proportions of rhamnose and secondarily 
 bound phosphate. Most likely, 1,4,6 linkages are not pres- 
 ent on any glucose units of the Type XVIII polysaccharide, 
 since there is no cross reaction in either direction with 
 Type II, in spite of the occurrence of rhamnose in both 
 polysaccharides. It is therefore evident that the chemical 
 nature of the polyglucose specificities cannot be fully un- 
 derstood until the component sugars and fine structures of 
 the specific polysaccharides of more of the cross-reacting 
 pneumococcal types are elucidated â€” a formidable but by 
 no means insuperable task. 

Another far-flung immunological specificity which is 
 being unraveled is that of the polygalactoses, and among 
 these I include not only the galactans, but the already 
 mentioned plant gums, since most of these contain galactose 
 in their repeating units. Thus far, the specific polysac- 
 charide of only one pneumococcal type, XIV, has shown 
 this property. Goebel, Beeson, and Hoagland found it to 
 consist of three molecules of galactose to one of N-acetyl- 
 glucosamine, but did not establish any of the linkages. It 
 was therefore not too farfetched, when Wolfrom and his 
 collaborators isolated a galactan from the heparin mother
