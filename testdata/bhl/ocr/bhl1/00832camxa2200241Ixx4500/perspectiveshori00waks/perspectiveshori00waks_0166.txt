liquors of beef lung, to beg some of the material and test it 
 with Type XIV antipneumococcus serum. Nearly one 
 third of the antibody was precipitated. The Ohio workers 
 had shown that galactose was present in the lung galactan 
 in three glycosidically linked forms: otherwise unsubsti- 
 tuted, singly substituted, and doubly substituted. The un- 
 substituted end groups are glycosidically linked to the 3 
 or 6 positions of other galactose radicals, and all linkages 
 are 1,3, or 1,6, or 1,3,6. This does not help much, since 
 there are also three galactoses in the repeating unit of the 
 Type XIV polysaccharide, and their linkages are unknown. 
 A clue, however, was furnished by tamarind seed polysac- 
 charide, a commercial thickener of jellies, from India. This 
 carbohydrate consists of a main chain of xylose and glucose 
 units, two thirds of the latter branched at the 1,4,6 posi- 
 tions, making the substance reactive with Type II anti- 
 serum. Attached glycosidically to the main chain are single, 
 otherwise unsubstituted galactose units, and these suffice 
 to precipitate a portion of the antibodies in Type XIV 
 antiserum. Moreover, such galactose end groups are the 
 only structures in common with the lung galactan, and 
 since both polysaccharides precipitate Type XIV anti- 
 serum, it may be predicted with confidence that not only 
 will all carbohydrates containing unsubstituted galactose 
 units precipitate this antiserum, but that one, at least, of 
 the three galactose radicals in the Type XIV polysac- 
 charide will also be found to occur as an unsubstituted end 
 group. The former prediction has been verified with 
 karaya gum and gum arabic, and it is hoped to test the lat- 
 ter prediction chemically in the near future. Here again, 
 then, part of the problem has been solved, but much re- 
 mains to be done.
