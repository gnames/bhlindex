ConsfJfution and Specificify of Blood Group 
 Substances 

The blood group substances present additional puzzles 
 in the relation between constitution and specificity. A 
 most striking finding by all of the more recent workers in 
 this area was the great similarity of the A, B, and O sub- 
 stances, in spite of the dire consequences of the transfusion 
 of mismatched bloods. All three substances were found to 
 consist of galactose, fucose, N-acetylglucosamine, and N- 
 acetylgalactosamine, together with a residue of amino acids. 
 The cross reactivity of the blood group substances in Type 
 XIV antipneumococcus serum has long been known and 
 has been quantitatively studied by Kabat, but it is still not 
 known whether this reactivity is due to the multiple re- 
 currence of certain galactose linkages or whether it is 
 caused by the N-acetylglucosamine portions. Possibly both 
 types of residues function. Leskowitz and Kabat recently 
 devised a new method for the separation and quantitative 
 estimation of glucosamine and galactosamine, and with its 
 aid have shown that hog and human blood group A 
 substances gave glucosamine to galactosamine ratios averag- 
 ing 1.5, hog and human 0(H) 2.3 and 2.6, and human B 
 2.8. It is thus evident that chemical differences among the 
 blood group substances are beginning to emerge, and the 
 outlook along these lines appears hopeful. 

Nature of Complement 

We now come to complement, which remains in large 
 part an enigma despite its importance as an auxiliary in 
 immunity and its enormous use in diagnostic tests carried 
 out daily all over the world. True, our own experiments 
 showed that complement could be weighed, and so disposed 
 of the widely held view that complement was merely a 
 colloidal state of fresh serum proteins. These studies also
