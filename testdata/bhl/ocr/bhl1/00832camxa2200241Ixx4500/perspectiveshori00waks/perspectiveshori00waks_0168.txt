led, with Weil and Treffers, to a theory of complement 
 fixation which has not yet been refuted. But we are only 
 beginning to learn how complement mediates the lysis of 
 cells that have taken up antibody. Manfred Mayer has 
 made a good case for the concept that the antibody is the 
 enzyme and that complement merely supplies cofactors or 
 energy. This view is directly opposed to the usual one that 
 complement or one or more of its components exerts enzy- 
 matic action on the cell-antibody complex. Progress is, 
 however, being made on the mechanics and kinetics of 
 lysis with the aid of new methods devised by Mayer and 
 his group. These workers have also shown that the initial 
 step of fixation of a portion of complement requires cal- 
 cium ion and that this is followed by a second prelytic 
 stage of complementary activity requiring magnesium ion. 
 Only then can lysis ensue. In our laboratory, Plescia is 
 working out the thermodynamics of immune lysis, is study- 
 ing the long-known concentration effect and the range in 
 which lysis is independent of this effect, and has simplified 
 the analytical problem so that large numbers of accurate 
 tests and readings may be made by a single worker. Both 
 approaches appear to be converging toward similar views 
 of the mechanism of immune lysis, but much patient effort 
 and time will still be required before a detailed picture of 
 the complex events can be obtained. Perhaps the final 
 solution may even be delayed until methods for the frac- 
 tionation of closely related proteins are so improved that 
 complement and its four recognized components can be 
 isolated in a state of purity.

As for allergy, we are all familiar with its distressing ef- 
 fects in man and domestic animals, but little is known of 
 the mechanisms of these effects. Is allergy a process running 
 parallel with immunity; is it an imperfect immunity in the
