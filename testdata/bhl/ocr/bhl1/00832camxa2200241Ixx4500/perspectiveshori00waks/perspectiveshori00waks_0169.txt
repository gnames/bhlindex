Problems in Immunology 151 

sense of an immunity arrested at too early a stage; or is it 
 an imperfect immunity in the sense of a deviation of the 
 immune process so that abnormal antibodies are formed 
 capable of attachment to certain cells or tissues and there 
 causing damage when antigen appears? The beginnings of 
 an answer may perhaps lie in Mary Loveless's finding of the 
 two separate antibodies involved in the allergic state: the 
 sensitizing antibodies, occi^rring mainly in the P-globulin 
 fraction of serum, and the neutralizing antibodies, which 
 are found mainly in the y-globulin portion. And although 
 any protein is potentially an allergen, what is the reason 
 for the extreme potency of some of the large polypeptides 
 such as those found in cottonseed and the castor bean? 
 This would seem an excellent problem for the chemists 
 who occupy themselves with the sequences of amino acids. 
 Moreover, the most active pollen fractions contain carbo- 
 hydrates, and it is not known whether these are themselves 
 active or are merely adventitious impurities of the actual 
 allergen. 

What of the Future? 

This brief recital by no means exhausts the list of un- 
 solved problems. I have mentioned enough of these con- 
 tinuing riddles of immunology to indicate that some of 
 them, at least, are almost daily becoming less and less 
 obscure, and that modern quantitative immunochemical 
 methods are supplying, and will continue to furnish, 
 powerful tools for their ultimate solution.
