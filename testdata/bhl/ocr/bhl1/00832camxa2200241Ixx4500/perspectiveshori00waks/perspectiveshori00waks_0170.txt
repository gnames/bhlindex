The Inhibition of Virus 
 Reproduction by Chemical 
 Substances 

By FRANK L HORSFALL, JR. 

When a virus particle and a cell come to- 
 gether, events may begin which lead to the production of 
 more virus particles. If this occurs, it is said that the virus 
 particle is infective, the cell is susceptible, and virus repro- 
 duction has taken place. The concepts of infectivity and 
 susceptibility are inseparable; either is dependent on the 
 other. The capacity of the virus to infect cannot be demon- 
 strated without a susceptible cell, while the capacity of the 
 cell to support reproduction is determinable only with an 
 infective virus particle. 

If reproduction of the virus leads to abnormalities in cell 
 function, the virus is considered to be pathogenic. When 
 the number of abnormal cells becomes sufficiently large, 
 changes in tissue function may occur. Only when these 
 exceed a certain threshold level can disease be recognized.
