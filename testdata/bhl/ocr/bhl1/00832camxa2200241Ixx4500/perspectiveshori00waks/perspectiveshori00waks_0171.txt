Chemical Inblbifhn of Viruses 153 

Virus disease is dependent on virus reproduction in the 
 sense that, in the absence of reproduction, disease does not 
 develop. Reproduction of a virus does not always lead to 
 disease, however, and some viruses multiply extensively in 
 certain tissues without causing demonstrable abnor- 
 malities. There is some evidence that the relationship be- 
 tween the extent of reproduction and the amount of disease 
 is quantitative. With influenza virus or pneumonia virus 
 infections of the respiratory tract in mice, it is feasible to 
 compute how much pneumonia will develop by direct 
 calculation from the concentration of virus in the lung and 
 the time after inoculation (22, 29). 

If this relationship has wide validity, a possible means 
 for the control of virus disease opens before us. In theory, 
 inhibition of virus reproduction might be expected to re- 
 sult in less extensive disease. This conjecture has not yet 
 been tested adequately. But the evidence so far obtained 
 with one respiratory virus infection in mice, that is, 
 pneumonia virus of mice, is in accord with the idea. When 
 a chemical substance, in this case a bacterial polysaccharide, 
 is introduced into the respiratory tract, the greater the de- 
 gree of inhibition in virus reproduction, the smaller is the 
 amount of pneumonia that develops (23). Moreover, the 
 quantitative relationship between virus concentration, ex- 
 tent of lung lesion, and time is identical with that found 
 in the uninhibited virus infection (29). The amount of 
 pneumonia that will develop can be computed from the 
 other two variables. 

At first glance, such a result appears to be similar in 
 many features to that found when an antimicrobial agent 
 is employed in a bacterial infection. Bacterial growth is re- 
 tarded or stopped, and the disease is modified. In the ex- 
 ample just described there is, however, a distinguishing 
 feature that may be important. The substance used to in- 
 hibit virus reproduction has no effect upon extracellular 
 virus particles and does not prevent their adsorption by
