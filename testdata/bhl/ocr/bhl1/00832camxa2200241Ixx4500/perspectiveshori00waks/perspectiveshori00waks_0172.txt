susceptible cells (23, 30). The available evidence indicates 
 that the compound inhibits the intracellular reproductive 
 process. But there is as yet no indication of the means by 
 which this is accomplished. To inhibit reproduction after 
 a virus, or part of it, has entered a cell is not readily 
 achieved. This objective has been realized with chemical 
 substances in only a few instances, but these seem of suffi- 
 cient importance to warrant further work in this field. 

Mechanism of Virus Reproduction 

Inhibition of virus reproduction by chemical substances 
 might be achieved more readily if the mechanism were 
 fully understood. Because this phenomenon is an intracel- 
 lular process inseparable from the life of the cell, it has 
 not been possible to distinguish clearly between the role 
 of the virus and that of the cell. With bacteriophages, 
 large strides have been made recently, and it now appears 
 that the reproductive process involves a number of discrete 
 steps. Current theory holds that phage particles do not 
 enter bacterial cells as intact entities; that their nucleic 
 acids and genetic determinants do gain entry; that certain 
 components of the new particles are produced separately; 
 and that after assembly into mature particles these leave 
 the cell at the time of lysis (25, 26, 31, 40). This complex 
 process can then be repeated in series. 

With animal virus reproduction the present situation is 
 far less advanced. There is no good answer to the simple 
 question: do animal viruses multiply themselves, or are 
 they reproduced by the infected cell? Quantitative and 
 kinetic studies, as well as investigations with the electron 
 microscope, have not excluded the possibility that the mul- 
 tiplication of animal viruses may be formally similar to 
 that of microbial species which multiply intracellularly. 
 The rate of appearance of new virus particles after an ap- 
 propriate latent or lag period appears to be logarithmic in
