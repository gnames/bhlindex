all cases adequately studied (22, 28, 29), as with bacteria 
 and phages. Development of required precursor materials 
 or of incomplete or immature virus particles in advance of 
 infective particles has not been decisively demonstrated 
 (28, 34), as with phage. Recent studies with influenza 
 virus indicate that when cells are not overloaded by very 
 large inocula, only mature infective particles are produced 
 during reproduction (28). 

Both the rate of reproduction and the amount of virus 
 produced are related to oxidative metabolism of the host 
 tissue, and if this is affected, virus multiplication is dimin- 
 ished correspondingly (3, 16). Apparently, depression of 
 almost any metabolic function of the cell, however 
 achieved, results in a depression in virus reproduction. 
 Although evidence of this kind indicates that the virus re- 
 quires the presence of an actively metabolizing cellular 
 environment, it does not point to any particular biosyn- 
 thetic process as necessary for reproduction. Moreover, 
 such evidence does not prove that the virus is multiplied 
 by the cell. 

If animal virus particles do not enter the cell as intact 
 particles, as is thought to be the case with bacteriophages 
 (25, 26, 31, 40), and only their nucleic acids and genetic 
 machinery are required to set the stage for intracellular 
 reproduction, it is apparent that the process is widely dif- 
 ferent from the multiplication of other microbial species. 
 The indications that the process is different are based on 
 very thin evidence with animal viruses. The evidence most 
 commonly invoked is the apparent disappearance of most 
 of the infective particles shortly after inoculation (21, 24). 
 To explain this phenomenon on a simpler premise, it is 
 necessary to assume merely that the forces which hold an 
 intact virus particle and intracellular components together 
 are considerably greater than those between the free virus 
 and the cell surface. Indications that there are strong forces 
 binding some animal viruses to cell fragments have been
