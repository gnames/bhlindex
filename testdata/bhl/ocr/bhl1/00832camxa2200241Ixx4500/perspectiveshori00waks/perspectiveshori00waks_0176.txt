158 Perspectives in Microbiology 

one of the major premises on which the current theory of 
 phage reproduction is erected. 

The chemical composition of animal viruses has not yet 
 been adequately established, partly because of difficulties 
 in purification. It is too early to conclude that such viruses 
 are composed wholly of protein and nucleic acid or that 
 their nucleic acids are of the desoxypentose type, as in the 
 case with phage (9). Recent studies with the electron micro- 
 scope on ultra-thin sections of infected cells raise the pos- 
 sibility that even relatively small viruses, such as influenza 
 and herpes simplex, may have surface membranes and a 
 central morphological structure analogous to a nucleus 
 (33). Moreover, animal viruses do not usually cause death 
 and lysis of the host cells they infect in nature. Their re- 
 production is followed by a trickle or leakage of new virus 
 particles (7, 14), not by the lysis and bursting that typically 
 result from the reproduction of phage in a bacterial cell. 
 In a number of instances, as with mumps virus in the chick 
 embryo, extensive multiplication does not result in any 
 demonstrable host cell abnormality. Thus, whatever the 
 mechanism of animal virus reproduction may be, it seems 
 apparent that the effects of the process on the host cell are 
 generally very different from those caused by phage multi- 
 plication. 

InhibJfion of Infracellular Reproducfion 

Can these dissimilarities be turned to account and lead 
 to effective means for the control of diseases induced by 
 animal viruses? Before this question can be answered, a 
 number of related problems probably will need more study. 
 It is clear now that it is possible to inhibit the intracellular 
 reproduction of certain animal viruses through application 
 of some chemical substances (27). Compounds of high 
 molecular weight and uncertain structure, like polysac- 
 charides derived from the capsules of Klebsiella pneu-
