Chemical Inhibition of Viruses 161 

particles, which are considerably more complex in con- 
 stitution and are thought to contain both proteins and 
 nucleic acids. This is dissimilar to the effect of proflavine 
 on the reproduction of phage, which appears to be directed 
 mainly against the final assembly of mature virus particles 
 from a number of preformed components (13). It differs also 
 from the effects of 5-methyl tryptophane or chlorampheni- 
 col on phage multiplication, which are considered to result 
 chiefly from inhibition of protein synthesis (5, 10). 

If the reproduction of animal viruses is more nearly com- 
 parable to that of microbial species than to the stepwise 
 intracellular process now envisioned for phage, the results 
 obtained with the chloro-substituted benzimidazole ribo- 
 side may not be surprising. Under these circumstances, it 
 might be expected that inhibition of reproduction would 
 be associated with a proportional reduction in all sub- 
 stances found in the virus particle. If, however, reproduc- 
 tion depends on the production of individual components 
 separately and their eventual assembly into mature in- 
 fective particles, it would seem probable that some com- 
 ponent should accumulate when an inhibitory compound 
 is present. There is, so far, no decisive evidence that this 
 occurs with animal viruses. 

Inhibitors as Chemofherapeufic Agents 

In infections with animal viruses, but not with phage, it 
 is necessary to be concerned with the responses of a society 
 of cells to the results of the reproductive process. Such a 
 community of cells, often of widely dissimilar kinds, con- 
 stitutes a tissue, and it is the response of tissues that leads 
 to reactions recognizable as disease. In nature, the number 
 of infective virus particles that first succeed in reaching 
 susceptible cells in a given tissue is probably relatively 
 small. The long incubation periods associated with many 
 virus diseases are in accord with this idea. It is well known
