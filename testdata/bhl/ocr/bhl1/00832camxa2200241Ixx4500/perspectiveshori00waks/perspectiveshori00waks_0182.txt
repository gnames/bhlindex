cern any clear pattern of effects. This is an area of inquiry 
 in which borderline results can be both encouraging and 
 deceptive. Minor extensions in survival time, even though 
 not attributable to chance on statistical grounds, may be 
 so dependent upon the experimental conditions employed 
 as to rob them of any real importance. 

Some mention has been made of the short interval that 
 seems to be available for the effective use of inhibitory 
 compounds after evidence of disease has appeared. The 
 idea that this interval is brief has arisen from studies with 
 viruses like influenza, which reproduce at a relatively rapid 
 rate (28). With pneumonia virus of mice, which multiplies 
 less rapidly, an effective interval of at least a day remains 
 after gross signs of disease have appeared (23). Possibly with 
 viruses that reproduce much more slowly, an even longer 
 interval for therapy may be found. 

At present, it seems probable that substances which in- 
 hibit virus reproduction may come to be more useful dur- 
 ing the incubation period than after disease has become 
 manifest. Investigations with a variety of animal viruses, 
 including pneumonia virus of mice (23, 30), mumps (20), 
 and influenza (35, 38), indicate that multiplication is more 
 effectively inhibited the earlier an inhibitory compound is 
 given. As would be expected from a compound that inhibits 
 the reproductive process, the lower the virus concentration 
 when the substance is given, the smaller is the final yield 
 of virus. If the final concentration can be kept below the 
 threshold value, recognizable disease does not appear. Al- 
 though use of inhibitory compounds during the incubation 
 period is not to be considered as therapeutic, it is also not 
 strictly prophylactic. The virus infection is not wholly pre- 
 vented but is diminished in extent through reduction in 
 the amount of virus reproduction. In effect, the infectious 
 process is held at the subclinical or inapparent level. The 
 advantage can be double, for not only may evident disease
