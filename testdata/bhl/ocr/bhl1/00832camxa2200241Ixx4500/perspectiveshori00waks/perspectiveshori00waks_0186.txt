Challenging Problems in 
 Antibiotic Research 

By HARRY EAGLE 

The positive accomplishments of antibiotic 
 research, as they relate to perspectives and horizons in 
 microbiology, are difficult to summarize. In part, this re- 
 flects the fact that most research in antibiotics has 
 centered around the development of new agents. Begin- 
 ning with their discovery by large-scale screening pro- 
 grams, and proceeding to their isolation and chemical 
 characterization, the determination of their pharmacologic 
 properties and therapeutic activity, and culminating in 
 efficient methods of production and effective pharmaceu- 
 tical formulation, the new agents represent an enormous 
 investment of time, facilities, and skills. I do not wish to 
 minimize the importance of such studies, or the value of 
 the chemical and biological data so obtained. Research in 
 that aspect of microbiological antagonism which we term 
 "antibiotic" action was motivated by the development of 
 effective agents for the treatment of disease, and that prac-
