170 Perspecfives in Microbiology 

mals and fowl have increased our total meat resources 
 almost overnight, and to a significant degree. 

These striking successes and the facility with which the 
 antibiotics can be, and often are, prescribed for the treat- 
 ment of undiagnosed febrile illness have led to the wide- 
 spread misapprehension that the problem of infectious 
 disease has been or soon will be solved. The truth falls 
 somewhat short of this optimistic appraisal. The problem 
 of infectious disease has been met only in part, and indeed 
 only in small part. A number of common and serious bac- 
 terial infections are not amenable to treatment with any 
 of the antibiotics yet discovered; antibiotic-resistant staphy- 
 lococci present a special and as yet unsolved problem; the 
 chemotherapy of many protozoal and helminthic infections, 
 world-wide in scope and affecting large segments of the 
 population, is highly unsatisfactory; and although the 
 rickettsial infections and a number of diseases caused by the 
 larger viruses respond satisfactorily to treatment with some 
 of the antibiotics, the smaller viruses are not similarly sus- 
 ceptible. 

Cell PermeabilJfy, a Possible Limiting Factor 

It has been suggested that the small viruses are resistant 
 to therapy because, as intracellular organisms, they cannot 
 be reached by the drugs. But recent studies in our labora- 
 tory with radioactive penicillin and streptomycin indicate 
 that at least these two antibiotics do penetrate into some 
 types of mammalian cell in concentrations consistent with 
 a simple diffusion equilibrium. Permeability, as such, may 
 therefore not be the important consideration which limits 
 their therapeutic action within the cell. Conceivably, the 
 larger viruses and the rickettsiae have a more complex 
 structure and more complex metabolic pathways, which 
 offer numerous points of attack for the selective cytotoxic 
 action of, for example, chloramphenicol or a tetracycline.
