whereas the smaller viruses may have only a limited 
 metabolic activity and ofiFer correspondingly limited points 
 of attack for a chemotherapeutic agent. If, as appears to be 
 the case with bacteriophage, the metabolic reactions neces- 
 sary for the replication of the small viruses are in large part 
 mediated by the host cell itself, one must then hope that 
 there are specific metabolic functions which are more es- 
 sential to the virus than to the host cell, and can be blocked 
 by an appropriate agent. That agent has yet to be found. 
 (Some alternative possibilities and the complexities en- 
 countered in the experimental chemotherapy of viral in- 
 fection are discussed in Chapter 11.) 

ToxJcify of Anflbiofics 

Although the toxic reactions noted with every antibiotic 
 are usually minor and transient, in the rare patient they 
 may be serious or even fatal. Despite the increasing number 
 of such case reports, the pathogenesis of the serious hyper- 
 sensitivity reactions to penicillin, of the gastrointestinal re- 
 actions to the tetracyclines, and of the blood dyscrasias 
 sometimes observed with chloramphenicol, remains un- 
 explained and in large measure unexplored; as of now, the 
 occurrence of such reactions can be neither predicted nor 
 prevented. 

Developmenf of ResJsfance 

Much attention has focused on the problem of the emer- 
 gence of resistance to antibiotics. In my estimation, the 
 practical importance of the phenomenon has been greatly 
 exaggerated. True, staphylococci are now more resistant to 
 antibiotic therapy than they were ten years ago. There is 
 reason to believe that this represents not the development 
 of resistance in strains that were originally sensitive, but 
 rather the selective survival and multiplication, under the
