antibiotic. The sometimes striking antagonistic and syner- 
 gistic effects when antibiotics are used in combination are 
 of obvious central importance in relation to their thera- 
 peutic use, but the factors underlying those effects are 
 almost wholly obscure. 

Many of the reported metabolic effects of antibiotics are 
 observed with whole-cell suspensions, in which it is no- 
 toriously difficult to distinguish between a primary locus 
 of action of the antibiotic and metabolic effects resulting 
 from that combination which may, however, be two, three, 
 or more steps removed. Uncommon interest therefore at- 
 taches to the recent demonstration by Saz that in a cell- 
 free bacterial extract, chlortetracycline in minute concen- 
 tration inhibits an aryl nitro-reductase of Escherichia coli. 
 This inhibition apparently results from the fact that the 
 antibiotic combines with Mn, which is an essential cofactor 
 in one or more of the multiple enzyme systems involved in 
 this complex reaction. Interesting also is the fact that oxy- 
 tetracycline, although it also chelates with Mn, is far less 
 inhibitory than is chlortetracycline. Whether or not this 
 is the mechanism by which chlortetracycline exerts its 
 growth-inhibitory effect on bacteria, it is the first clear 
 demonstration of a direct effect of an antibiotic on an 
 enzyme system in a cell-free bacterial extract and, as such, 
 may prove a model for the actual mode of action of this 
 and other antibiotics. 

Our ignorance extends not only to the mode of action 
 of antibiotics at the cellular level, but indeed to how they 
 work in vivo, for some of the antibiotics, notably chlor- 
 amphenicol and the three tetracyclines, are effective thera- 
 peutically at concentrations in the body fluids which are 
 only growth inhibitory in vitro. The therapeutic response 
 clearly involves the participation of host mechanisms to 
 an important degree; but whether we are here dealing 
 with a humoral or a cellular effect has not yet been 
 clarified.
