178 Perspectives in Microbiology 

proves to be streptomycin, chloramphenicol, or a tetra- 
 cycline. A fresh approach and a new orientation may prove 
 necessary if these screening programs are to be of con- 
 tinuing productivity. Whether that fruitful new approach 
 involves an intensive study of the metabolic pathways by 
 which the antibiotics are produced; whether the screen- 
 ing program itself could be profitably modified, for ex- 
 ample, by greater emphasis on protozoa and viruses; or 
 whether the chemical modification of known antibiotics, 
 with a view to altering their antibacterial spectrum or 
 reducing their toxicity, deserves further exploration; this 
 is the multiple-choice problem with which the pharma- 
 ceutical industry has been faced for some years. 

We as microbiologists cannot share the satisfaction of 
 the physician and of the drug house in their joint past ac- 
 complishments. However reluctantly, we must admit that 
 the striking chemotherapeutic advances of the past decade 
 have resulted from screening programs. There has been 
 no comparable progress in the development of new agents 
 on the basis of a priori considerations, or even in our un- 
 derstanding of the cellular effects and selective cytotoxicity 
 of the known agents. This is the intellectual challenge 
 of the antibiotics. Even on a pragmatic level, it is possible 
 that in this instance also, to paraphrase the title of Flex- 
 ner's famous essay, the slow and laborious pursuit of ap- 
 parently useless knowledge for knowledge's own sake may 
 in the long run prove even more rewarding than the 
 screening programs have proved to date.
