on plants, whereas plants can develop in the complete 
 absence of man and even other animals. As regards de- 
 pendence, Dodge (9) made the following case for fungi: 
 "We may rest assured that as green plants and animals 
 disappear one by one from the face of the globe, some of 
 the fungi will always be present to dispose of the last 
 remains." To continue a bit further, both fungi and most 
 bacteria would encounter nutritional difficulties with the 
 loss of green plants and animals. In this connection, a good 
 case could be made for chemoautotrophic bacteria as the 
 organisms most likely to survive the longest in a world 
 being depleted of living things. 

My discussion is based on the principle that higher 
 plants are indispensable to human welfare and that mi- 
 crobial development is intimately related to plant growth. 
 Whereas most microorganisms grow separately from plants, 
 others are associated in states of symbiosis and parasitism. 

The Rhhospbere 

Among the relations of microorganisms and plants, most 
 attention has been devoted to the role of microorganisms 
 as converters of soil materials, frequently summarized in 
 cycles of the elements. In addition, attention has been di- 
 rected to structural modification of soil by microorganisms. 
 These changes do not require close association between 
 microorganisms and higher plants, yet the association is 
 frequently closer than may be realized, and the effects of 
 the microorganisms on the plants are pronounced, for the 
 organisms are in close proximity. 

The area of the soil close to plant roots was designated 
 many years ago by Hiltner as the "rhizosphere." This is 
 the region of the soil from which the plant obtains its 
 nutrients and in which each soil exerts its particular effects 
 on the plant. In this zone, one finds great numbers of 
 microorganisms, far greater than in the rest of the soil (39).
