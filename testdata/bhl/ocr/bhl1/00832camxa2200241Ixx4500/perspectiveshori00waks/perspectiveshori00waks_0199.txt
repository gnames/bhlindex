Bacteria may be 5, 10, 20, or more times as abundant close 
 to or on root surfaces as in soil close by but free from root 
 development. The effects are evident on root hairs and 
 young roots as well as on older roots and are most promi- 
 nent during periods of active plant development. Further- 
 more, upon death of the plant, the bacterial population 
 reverts promptly to its original low level. Studies of the 
 rhizosphere were initiated in our laboratories some years 
 ago and have been expanded by many others, particularly 
 by Lochhead and associates (19) and by Clark (5). 

The rhizosphere effect has two general implications: 
 first, the extensive development of microorganisms in the 
 rhizosphere is the result of plant growth and is due princi- 
 pally to organic materials coming from the roots; second, 
 microorganisms that have made extensive development on 
 the root surfaces have important effects on the plants be- 
 cause of products formed close to the absorbing root 
 surfaces. 

Unfortunately, there is insufficient information to show 
 precisely what happens at the root surface. It is presumed 
 that considerable amounts of readily decomposable organic 
 materials come from the intact roots, and they, together 
 with diverse dead root parts, support this large population 
 of microorganisms. There is only fragmentary information, 
 however, as to whether organic materials are excreted from 
 roots, and little to indicate what the compounds are and 
 the conditions under which they are excreted. There is 
 some evidence that root penetration by the nodule bacteria 
 is conditioned by root excretions, and Virtanen and his 
 associates made proposals regarding the mechanism of ni- 
 trogen fixation by leguminous plants on the basis of the 
 amino acids excreted from root nodules (42, 45). Some in- 
 formation presented by Halleck and Cochrane (14) was 
 believed to indicate that certain fungistatic substances 
 applied to the aerial parts of plants affected the develop- 
 ment of bacteria in the rhizosphere, presumably through
