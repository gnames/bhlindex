excretion of either the toxic materials that had been trans- 
 located, or through other organic materials excreted in 
 response to effects of the fungicides on plant development. 
 Some of the substances decreased the numbers of bacteria 
 in the rhizosphere, whereas others increased them. 

More definite evidence of movement of organic ma- 
 terials through plants was recently reported by Preston, 
 Mitchell, and Reeve (32). When the tops of certain plants 
 were treated with a-methoxyphenylacetic acid and the 
 treated plants were grown in the same pot with untreated 
 plants, the chemical moved downward through the treated 
 plants, out of the roots, and was taken up by the others. 
 When grown in solutions, the treated plants liberated the 
 chemical into the water. The effect was noted only with 
 this one plant-growth-modifying compound and not with 
 others, yet it establishes the possibility of the excretion 
 through roots of organic materials applied to aerial plant 
 parts. Winter (47) has included the following among the 
 organic materials excreted by plant roots: phosphatides, 
 amino acids, thiamin, biotin, mesoinositol, para-amino- 
 benzoic acid, carbohydrates, tannins, and alkaloids. Harley 
 (15) listed sugars, amino acids, vitamins, and other organic 
 substances as materials excreted by roots. The total number 
 of excreted substances must be large. Obviously, more 
 information on the movement of organic materials from 
 plant roots is needed. 

Under conditions of high air humidity and low content 
 of soil moisture, the plant may affect microbial develop- 
 ment in still another way. Breazeale and McGeorge (1) 
 reported that, under these conditions, water is transported 
 from the air through the plant to the rhizosphere, and in 
 this way the soil moisture content can be increased. In 
 one of their experiments, tomato plants grown in soil in 
 which the water content had been reduced to the point 
 where the plants began to wilt were placed in an atmos- 
 phere of 80 to 90 per cent humidity. The plants recovered
