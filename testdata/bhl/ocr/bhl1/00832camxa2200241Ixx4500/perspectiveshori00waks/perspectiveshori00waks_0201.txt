and continued to grow and bear fruit with no watering

Somewhat more is known of the effects on plants of 
 microorganisms in the rhizosphere, but the data are little 
 more than suggestive. The solvent effect of roots on marble 
 was shown by plant physiologists many years ago, and 
 it was found by Fred and Haas (10) that the solvent effect 
 was greater when microorganisms were present than when 
 they were absent. The effect was ascribed to carbon diox- 
 ide excreted from the roots. Of particular significance in 
 the same connection are some results of Gerretsen (11) 
 on the solubility of phosphate. It was found that more 
 tricalcium phosphate was absorbed by plants from sub- 
 strates containing microorganisms than from sterile sub- 
 strates, and that the phosphate underwent solution by 
 microbial development about plant roots. 

Solubility of iron, and also of manganese (12), and their 
 availability to plants are probably affected by the rhizo- 
 sphere population. Microbial development reduces the 
 redox potential and may increase the acidity, both of which 
 increase iron solubility (40). Recent results of Bromfield 
 (3) support this contention. 

Although reduction reactions play an important part 
 in the solution of iron and manganese, complex formation 
 may affect the availability of these elements to plants as 
 well. Among the diverse organic compounds formed dur- 
 ing development of microorganisms, presumably there will 
 be chelating materials which will persist long enough to 
 form complexes with iron and other metals, and these 
 complexes will enter the plant. Amino acids, citric acid, 
 and other microbial products could serve as chelating 
 agents. Penetration of chelating compounds should be no 
 problem and would be likely to aid in iron utilization. 
 Recent observations of Weinstein et al. (44) have shown 
 that, when part of a root system was placed in a solution 
 containing the chelating agent ethylenediaminetetraacetic
