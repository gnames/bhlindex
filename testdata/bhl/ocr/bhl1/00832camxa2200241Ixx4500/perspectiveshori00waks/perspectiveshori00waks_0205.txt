are more readily recovered from roots than from stems and 
 leaves. Little significance can be attached to their presence, 
 however, for they occur in small numbers, and their pres- 
 ence seems to be unrelated to plant vigor or survival. 

MYCORRHIZAE 

Mycotrophy in plants can be interpreted broadly as the 
 associative development of fungi and plants, in which the 
 fungi penetrate the plant tissue (16, 20, 22, 33). It is a 
 very general phenomenon in nature and has been reported 
 for all of the major groups of plants, including the algae, 
 mosses and liverworts, ferns, gymnosperms and angio- 
 sperms. Particular attention has been devoted to the asso- 
 ciations of fungi with orchids, forest trees, and ericaceous 
 plants. There are two major types of fungus development: 
 the ectotrophic, in which the fungus makes profuse growth 
 about the root surface and develops between the cells of 
 the epidermis; and the endotrophic, where there is little 
 external mycelium but the fungus penetrates deeply into 
 the tissues and invades the cells. There is also a type re- 
 ferred to as ectendotrophic, where the fungus development 
 is intermediate between the two. The significance of de- 
 velopment of the fungus associates has been variously inter- 
 preted, and it is probable that with different plants the 
 effects of the fungi differ. In plants that have limited, if 
 any, root systems, the fungus functions as root hairs. Kelley 
 (20) has said: "It is unknown whether plants in nature 
 have root-hairs or mycorrhizae, or neither; but there is 
 enough evidence at hand to indicate that mycorrhizae pre- 
 dominate over root-hairs in the majority of cases." In 
 chlorophyll-free plants, the fungi may provide the plant 
 with organic materials. With pines and certain other trees, 
 the fungi cause the development of an abundance of short 
 roots and thus provide greater absorbing surface (15, 16, 
 17). Furthermore, minerals become absorbed through the 
 fungus mycelium which serves as root hairs (23).
