Even though many different microorganisms able to 
 produce antibiotics on laboratory media can be obtained 
 from soil, this provides no indication that these same 
 organisms will produce antibiotics in soil. In fact, it is 
 difficult to demonstrate antibiotic production in soil (41). 
 In several cases, demonstrable amounts of antibiotics have 
 been produced in sterilized soil that was treated with 
 organic substances and inoculated with pure cultures of 
 the antibiotic-producing microorganisms. Antibiotic pro- 
 duction in unsterilized soil has been demonstrated infre- 
 quently. Gregory, Allen, Riker, and Peterson (13) achieved 
 production of antibiotics by various microorganisms in 
 unsterilized soil supplemented with alfalfa meal or straw. 
 Wright (48) obtained gliotoxin under similar conditions 
 when clover was added to the acidic podzol of the Wareham 
 Heath. These difficulties in producing antibiotics, even 
 under conditions which should be more favorable than 
 those common to soils in nature, suggest that antibiotics 
 are unlikely to be present in soils in appreciable amounts 
 except in micro areas. 

Under conditions where the amounts of antibiotics are 
 low and localized, the likelihood that antibiotics will ex- 
 clude certain elements of the soil population is small. 
 The relationships of bacteriophage in soil may be com- 
 parable. If a phage contained in a soil controlled the popu- 
 lation, one might expect to recover only phage-resistant 
 cells, if any. But phage-sensitive cultures are obtainable 
 from soils that contain the phage. Probably, biological 
 control by such factors as phage or antibiotics would be 
 localized, temporary, and limited in effect except under 
 unusual conditions. 

Furthermore, results obtained in our laboratories (31, 
 41) indicate that the amounts of antibiotics required to 
 affect microorganisms are much greater in soil than in 
 culture media, and that even streptomycin, which is very 
 resistant to decomposition in comparison with other anti-
