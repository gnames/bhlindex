biotics, undergoes fairly rapid destruction in soil (30). 
 Although this evidence does not exclude the possibility of 
 some control of the soil population by antibiotics, particu- 
 larly root disease microorganisms, it limits very much the 
 conditions under which the population can be controlled. 

Provided that antibiotics are available, they can be ab- 
 sorbed and translocated through the plants. Here is one 
 more evidence of absorption of organic materials by plants. 
 Pramer (28, 29) and Crowdy and Pramer (7) observed that 
 basic materials move less rapidly than neutral or acidic 
 ones and that uptake is more rapid by cuttings than by 
 rooted plants. Furthermore, absorption and translocation 
 vary with the plant species and the environmental condi- 
 tions. Once absorbed, streptomycin and griseofulvin, and 
 doubtless others, persist in plants. Active material, which 
 was presumably the streptomycin with which the plants 
 were treated, has been detected in plant tissue ten weeks 
 or more after treatment (36). 

Nickell (25, 26) reported that the addition of certain 
 antibiotics to soil resulted in increased growth of plants 
 during early stages of development and that antibiotics 
 increased germination of some seeds. 

This type of response awaits confirmation,^ but there is 
 ample evidence that many plant diseases can be controlled 
 by use of antibiotics (21, 43). In our laboratories, Robison 
 has successfully controlled a bacterial wilt of chrysanthe- 
 mum with streptomycin (36). Many of the antibiotics are 
 effective systemically. Treatment for control of plant dis- 
 eases may consist of adding the antibiotic to the seed or to 
 the cut shoot, to the soil or sand substrate, or as a spray or 
 dust to the aerial parts of the plants. Downward movement 
 through the plants is slow, and this limits treatment of the 
 top parts of plants for control of root infections. The po- 
 tentialities of antibiotics for control of plant diseases appear 

2 In a recent report Barton and MacNab (Effect of antibiotics on plant 
 growth. Contrib. Boyce Thompson Inst., 17:419-434, 1954) observed little 
 or no favorable effect of antibiotics on germination of seeds, growth of 
 seedlings, or development of plants in soils.
