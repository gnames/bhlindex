promising but are as yet little known. The attention given 
 to the effects of antibiotics on plants and plant diseases is 
 slight compared to that given to their effects on animals 
 and animal diseases. 

Concluding Remarks 

In this paper, some of the varied relationships between 
 microorganisms and higher plants have been indicated, 
 and some of the limits of information regarding these re- 
 lationships have been pointed out. From even a cursory 
 consideration, it is evident that the relationships are nu- 
 merous and diverse. A comprehensive discussion would in- 
 clude many types of associations not mentioned at all here. 
 Although something is known of many types of associations, 
 knowledge of many, and indeed of most of them, is limited. 
 The lack of information concerning the reactions involved 
 and the factors affecting the associations might well serve 
 as a challenge for present and future investigators.
