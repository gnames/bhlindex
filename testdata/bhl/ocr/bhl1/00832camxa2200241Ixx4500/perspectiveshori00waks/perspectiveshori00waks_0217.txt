Dedication of the 
 Institute of Microbiology 

By LEWIS WEBSTER JONES 
 President, Rutgers University 

We are met here to dedicate a building, this 
 magnificent Institute of Microbiology, and to rededicate 
 this university to the high purposes which this building 
 symbolizes. 

For Rutgers University, this is a proud and solemn 
 moment. We recognize gratefully the work and achieve- 
 ments of one of the great creative personalities of our age 
 and Rutgers' most distinguished son. Dr. Selman A. Waks- 
 man. He was educated at Rutgers, and most of his scien- 
 tific work has been carried on here. His great abilities, his 
 long and patient investigations, his skilled and inspiring 
 leadership have brought honor to his university and untold 
 benefits to humanity. He has used the material rewards 
 of his discoveries, with characteristic unselfishness, to fur- 
 ther the scientific work to which he has devoted his life. 

This university gains immeasurably from the presence
