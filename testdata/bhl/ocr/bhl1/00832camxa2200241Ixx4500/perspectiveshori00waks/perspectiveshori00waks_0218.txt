 ing, and accepts with enthusiasm, gratitude, and resolution 
 all the responsibilities it implies. 

We welcome the scientists from many foreign countries 
 who are with us today. Their presence emphasizes the in- 
 ternational tradition of science, world-wide in its scope and 
 in the promise it holds for the destiny of the human race. 
 The language of science is truly international, truly hu- 
 mane in its purposes. Science seeks to arrive at verifiable 
 knowledge. In striking contrast to the struggle of rival 
 propagandas that poison communication in the political 
 sphere and erect impenetrable barriers between peoples, 
 communication among scientists means a sharing of truth; 
 all the evidence is carefully checked and openly presented 
 for the common enlightenment. Scientific investigation is 
 an expression of a continuing faith in human reason, in 
 man's power to increase his dignity and stature by increas- 
 ing his understanding. 

In the dreary climate of the "cold" w^ar, our vision of the 
 future has been clouded, and its range sadly shortened by 
 the fogs of doubt, fear, and suspicion. We can be thankful, 
 as we contemplate this Institute of Microbiology, for the 
 clear, bright prospect it opens before us. We can be sure 
 that the w^ork that will be done here will be more signifi- 
 cant, more far-reaching, and infinitely more creative and 
 enduring than the political events that fill today's news- 
 paper headlines. 

This institute will be hospitable to scientific workers and 
 students from many lands and from many related fields 
 of investigation. We are dealing here with the most con- 
 structive powers of the human mind; and the creative 
 imagination of the scientist links him in a common fellow- 
 ship with artists, poets, philosophers, and all men of learn- 
 ing and good will, with all indeed who share the aspira-
