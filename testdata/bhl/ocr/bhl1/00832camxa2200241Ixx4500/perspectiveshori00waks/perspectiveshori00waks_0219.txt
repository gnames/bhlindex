Dedication of the Institute 201 

individuals will have full scope; where teams of scientists 
 can pool their resources for the advancement of knowledge. 
 It will give mature workers an opportunity for continuing 
 achievement, younger workers a chance to learn and de- 
 velop their skills. It will be mainly concerned with basic 
 investigations into the nature of microorganisms, as well 
 as with the many and varied applications of newly dis- 
 covered knowledge. It will be truly productive, in a world 
 too much threatened with destructive forces; productive of 
 understanding, enlightenment, and practical human wel- 
 fare. 

We therefore dedicate this building, and rededicate this 
 university, to the enduring values on which our civilization 
 rests: the search for knowledge and understanding, and 
 their humane use under the guidance of universally ap- 
 plicable ethical principles. We thus reaffirm our faith in 
 reason and good will and our hope for the future.
