Microbiology Takes fbe Stage 203 

We have come a long way during these last few decades. 
 There is no field of human endeavor where microbes are 
 not recognized now as playing an important, and fre- 
 quently a dominant, part. We can now recognize, utilize, 
 combat, and in most cases control the numerous microbes 
 that cause infectious diseases and epidemics, that attack 
 our animals and our plants, that destroy our food supplies 
 and our clothing, that inhabit our soils and our seas, the 
 air we breathe, the water we drink, and even our bodies. 
 We also have learned to know microbes as complex living 
 systems. We now understand better their growth and their 
 functions, their manner of multiplying, and of utilizing 
 simple and complex nutrients, and we have gained con- 
 siderable information concerning the complex biochemical 
 reactions involved in these processes. 

We have learned much about the life of microbes in 
 pure cultures and in complex populations, and about the 
 production by many of them of specific chemical sub- 
 stances which stimulate or inhibit the growth of others. 
 We have learned also to utilize such substances for im- 
 proving and accelerating the growth of higher forms of 
 life, for destroying injurious microbes, thus improving 
 human and animal health. Diseases and epidemics that 
 formerly decimated huge segments of the world's popu- 
 lation have now been brought under control, deaths due to 
 diseases of childhood are now relatively rare, and the life 
 span of man has been greatly extended. 

How has all this been brought about? What have we 
 learned that will help us to plan our future investigations? 
 To what extent has the microbiologist benefited from the 
 contributions of the general biologist? In what respects do 
 the methods of studying bacteria, fungi, actinomycetes, and 
 protozoa differ from the methods of studying higher forms 
 of life, both plant and animal? Are the tools, the methods, 
 the approaches, or observations used in the study of mi- 
 crobes different from those employed by the general bi- 
 ologist?
