204 Perspectives in Microbiology 

These and many other questions that pertain to the 
 world of microbes in which we live have been only partly 
 answered. Many questions still await the investigator. 
 These problems are fundamental in nature, but the an- 
 swers promise rich rewards in practical applications. Many 
 questions have remained unanswered because the proper 
 methods of investigation have not yet been discovered. We 
 are dealing with microscopic and ultramicroscopic forms 
 of life, which we often recognize not by what they look 
 like but by what they do; not by how they behave in a 
 normal environment, but by how their reactions in an 
 abnormal environment can be interpreted in terms of their 
 life processes and role in the cycle of life in nature. 

Claude Bernard emphasized the fact that reasoning is 
 correct only when applied to correct facts; when facts are 
 originally tainted with error and inaccuracy, reasoning 
 based on them can lead only to error: "The art of investi- 
 gation is the cornerstone of all the experimental sciences. 
 If the facts used as a basis for reasoning are ill-established 
 or erroneous, everything will crumble or be falsified; and 
 it is thus that errors in scientific theories must often origi- 
 nate in errors of fact." If this applies to higher forms of 
 life, it applies with even greater force to the life of the 
 microbes. Bernard stated further: "The investigator must 
 be at once a theorist and a practitioner. He must com- 
 pletely master the art of establishing experimental facts, 
 which are the materials of science, and he must also clearly 
 understand the scientific principles which guide his rea- 
 soning through the varied experimental studies of natural 
 phenomena. Head and hand must go together. An able 
 hand without a head to direct it is a worthless tool; the 
 head is powerless without its executive hand." 

We can subscribe heartily to these principles. Pasteur 
 himself said at the dedication ceremonies of his institute: 
 "My dear collaborators, keep your enthusiasm, but let its 
 inseparable companion be rigorous control. Do not ad-
