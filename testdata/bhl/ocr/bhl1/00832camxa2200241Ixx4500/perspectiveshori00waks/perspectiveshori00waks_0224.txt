206 Perspectives in Microbiology 

to Bernard, who pointed out: "New ideas and discoveries 
 are like grains: it is not sufficient to produce them and 
 seed them; they must be nourished and allowed to develop 
 by means of scientific culture. Otherwise, they die or emi- 
 grate to other places where they are found to prosper and 
 bear fruit wherever they find fertile soil, often far away 
 from the place of origin." Also, he emphasized that "men 
 who have excessive faith in their theories or ideas are not 
 only ill-prepared for making discoveries, but they also 
 make poor observations." 

The scientific method is clearly outlined by Cannon in 
 The Way of an Investigator. He says, "Curiosity has been 
 condemned as a disease and as a low vice, and the theolo- 
 gians and poets have solemnly warned against it. But in 
 spite of the testimony that it was curiosity which lost us 
 paradise, I am sure that all who are aware of the fruits 
 of the tree of knowledge would agree that they have be- 
 come abundant because of the spying and trying of in- 
 quisitive scientists. . . . [The investigator] sees events and 
 changes in his field which seem to him strange and mysteri- 
 ous. Instead of ignoring them, as most people do, he 
 wonders about them and sets to work to learn their char- 
 acteristics. Curiosity is the main-spring of his initiative and 
 his persistent industry. It is a prime requisite for a career 
 of exploration." 

The investigators themselves deserve particular atten- 
 tion. In his introduction to Max Planck's Where is Science 
 Going, Einstein emphasizes that there are ". . . many 
 kinds of men who devote themselves to science, and not 
 all for the sake of science itself. There are some who come 
 into her temple because it offers them the opportunity to 
 display their particular talents. To this class of men science 
 is a kind of sport in the practice of which they exult, just 
 as an athlete exults in the exercise of his muscular prowess. 
 There is another class of men who come into the temple 
 to make an offering of their brain pulp in the hope of se-
