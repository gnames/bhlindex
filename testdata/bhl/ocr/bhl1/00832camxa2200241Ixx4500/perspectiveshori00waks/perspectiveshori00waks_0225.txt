Microbiology Takes fhe Stage 207 

curing a profitable return. These men are scientists only 
 by the chance of some circumstance which offered itself 
 ^vhen making a choice of career. . . . Should an angel of 
 God descend and drive from the Temple of Science all 
 those who belong to the categories I have mentioned, I 
 fear the temple would be nearly emptied. But a few wor- 
 shipers would still remain. . . . For the most part they 
 are strange, taciturn and lonely fellows. And, in spite of 
 this mutual resemblance, they are far less like one another 
 than those whom our hypothetical angel has expelled." 

This brings me to the methods of educating scientists. I 
 am not primarily concerned with secondary or even under- 
 graduate college education. I have in mind graduate train- 
 ing, the education of the future scientist after he has defi- 
 nitely decided upon a field of work and often even upon 
 a type of problem, or at least upon a method of approach 
 to a problem. 

Some educators fill the candidate with information. In 
 time, they make him feel that he knows all there is to be 
 known about a certain field of science, and sometimes all 
 that will ever be known about a given problem, or the 
 approach to the problem. This is, of course, the way to the 
 "expert," the object of hero worship, and often even to 
 that of the mystic in science. Other educators make the 
 candidate feel that he knows only very little, in fact, that 
 no one knows very much in a given field of science, and 
 that the future lies before him to be investigated. 

The first method is by far the more satisfying to the 
 student. He completes his work with a feeling that he is 
 a master of the subject, that he is now prepared to teach 
 others, and often even to show off to others his brilliant 
 knowledge. The second method is the more difficult one, 
 the less acceptable to the student, and often the more dis- 
 couraging. The student who manages, however, to survive 
 this type of training is the more humble in his approach 
 to the unknown universe; he is more inclined to continue
