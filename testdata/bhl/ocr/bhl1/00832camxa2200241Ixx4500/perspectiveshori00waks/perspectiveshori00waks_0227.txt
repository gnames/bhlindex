Microbiology Takes the Sfage 209 

tives, elects to be a worker in science he is not thereby ab- 
 solved from the duties and privileges of being human. He 
 must work out an adjustment between the claims upon 
 his life by his science, a proverbially jealous and exacting 
 mistress, and those of the rest of the world, including not 
 only deans, committees, commissioners, directors, boards, 
 foundations and other great cosmic elements, but also 
 cooks, maids, nurses, children, and most important of all, 
 his wife. If our graduate student, in whose behalf we are 
 taking all this trouble, turns out to amount to much he 
 will sooner or later receive offers for the purchase of his 
 soul. Such offers will be made by those skilled in the traf- 
 fic and they will be tempting. Shall we not be derelict in 
 our job of helping our student to get his training for life 
 if we do not furnish him some insight into what wis- 
 dom is available about the making of these necessary 
 adjustments between scientific research and the rest of 
 life?" 

We are now faced with the problem of selecting a group 
 of scientists who would come to this institute and who 
 would labor to advance our knowledge of microbes. There 
 are, of course, those who have already established them- 
 selves, who have already demonstrated their ability to con- 
 tribute to this search for the unknown. There are, on the 
 other hand, those who are still young and inexperienced, 
 but who, given the proper opportunity, will develop into 
 brilliant investigators. But how is one to select the latter? 
 We can only think of a most delightful conversation that 
 took place in 1813 between Sir Humphrey Davy and his 
 friend Pepys: 'Tepys, what am I to do? Here is a letter 
 from a young man named Faraday. He has been attending 
 my lectures, and wants me to give him employment at the 
 Royal Institute â€” what can I do?" "Do?," said Pepys, "put 
 him to wash bottles; if he refuses he is good for nothing." 
 "No, no," replied Davy, "we must try him with something 
 better than that."
