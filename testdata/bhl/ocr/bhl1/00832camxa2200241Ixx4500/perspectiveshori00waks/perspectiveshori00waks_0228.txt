210 Perspecfives in Microbiology 

Should one decide upon such promising young investi- 
 gators, one should think at once of the admonition given 
 by Charles Richet in his Natural History of a Savant: 
 "Young man, if you would discover a new truth, do not 
 seek to know what use will be made of it. Do not ask in 
 what way medicine or commerce or industry may profit 
 by the discovery; for if you do, you will discover nothing 
 at all. You wish to find a solution to a problem that you 
 consider important: tackle the problem without worrying 
 about the consequences. Attack the question on its simplest 
 side. Do not be stopped by the criticisms of journalists, 
 hygienists, engineers, chemists, doctors. Let them talk. Go 
 straight to the problem by the shortest road. Leave to 
 practitioners the cumbersome care of consequences and 
 industrial applications. Veritas lucet ipsa per se. Truth is 
 sufficient unto itself." 

One must not forget that the time when a Faraday could 
 make a great discovery merely by using a piece of string 
 and copper wire and working in a cellar has long passed. 
 The modern chemical and biological laboratories require 
 expensive equipment. The research problem frequently 
 involves the collaboration of several investigators and cer- 
 tainly that of the senior investigator and his assistants, the 
 teacher with his long and varied experience and the stu- 
 dent who has come to be taught and guided and to benefit 
 from such experience. 

The question frequently arises as to how to distribute 
 the credit for a new discovery, a new fact, a new observa- 
 tion. Some investigators will credit their assistants merely 
 by footnotes on scientific papers; others will exert every 
 effort to encourage their students, inspire them and stimu- 
 late them further to select research careers, and in doing 
 so, may not only add their names to the scientific papers, 
 but even place them first. In most cases, the results of the 
 second practice are entirely satisfactory. Often, however, 
 the consequences are most unexpected. How should one
