Microbiology Takes the Stage 211 

strike a happy medium? Scientists are searchers for truth. 
 But they are also human beings. 

Finally a word must be said of the concept of "pure" or 
 "basic" and of "applied" or "practical" research. We have 
 been hearing a great deal about these lately. One is sup- 
 posed to designate the study of fundamental principles 
 underlying any natural phenomena, and the other the use 
 for practical purposes of information thus gained. A Ger- 
 man investigator who died recently is said to have com- 
 mented: "I am dying happily with the knowledge that out 
 of my 50 years of research not one of my discoveries has 
 found any practical application." Personally, I prefer the 
 concept of Pasteur, who emphasized that science and the 
 applications of science are related to each other as are the 
 fruits to the tree which bears them. In the words of 
 Pasteur: "When one has reached the certainty of having 
 discovered an important scientific fact, one experiences 
 the greatest joy that can be felt by a human soul, and the 
 thought that one has contributed to the honor of his coun- 
 try makes this joy even more profound." 

It is my sincerest hope that while the workers in this 
 institute will concern themselves with the search for truths 
 basic to our knowledge of microbes, their nature, their 
 occurrence, their manifold activities, and their role in 
 natural processes, they will not overlook any potential 
 utilization of facts thus obtained for improving our health, 
 combating our natural enemies, increasing the produc- 
 tivity of our mills and our fields, and advancing other 
 aspects of human welfare which will go to make the life 
 of man easier, better, and happier. 

The functions of this institute will comprise both re- 
 search and teaching, largely on graduate and postdoctorate 
 levels. The staff of the institute will offer courses in the 
 various fields of microbiology to graduate students and 
 will conduct seminars for graduate and postdoctorate stu- 
 dents. These courses will also include supervision of vari-
