212 Perspectives in Microbiology 

ous research problems, in both the fundamental and the 
 applied phases of the subject. The institute will serve as a 
 gathering place for seminars and conferences on micro- 
 biological subjects. It will also serve as a depository of 
 cultures of microorganisms of theoretical or practical im- 
 portance. 

In planning this institute, departmentalization has been 
 avoided. It is our sincere hope that research programs will 
 be flexible, investigators will be free to pursue their chosen 
 fields without restriction, "team research" will be encour- 
 aged whenever possible, especially when "it grows out of 
 genuine supplementation of contributions" and "when it 
 serves the purpose of developing ideas" (Curt P. Richter). 
 Opportunities will be given for younger men and women 
 to obtain knowledge and guidance in their selected fields. 

In concluding, I should like to repeat what I said two 
 years ago, in connection with the laying of the cornerstone 
 of this building: 

This institute will devote its efforts to the study of the 
 smallest forms of life, the microbes, wherever they are 
 found and no matter what their activities may be. Let this 
 institute serve as a center where scientists from all parts 
 of the world may gather to work, to learn, and to teach. 
 The halls of this institute are dedicated to the free pursuit 
 of scientific knowledge for the benefit of all mankind.
