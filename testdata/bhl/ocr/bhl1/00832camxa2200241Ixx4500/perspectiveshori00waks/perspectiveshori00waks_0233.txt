From Dutch Sefflemenfs to the Insf'ifufe 215 

fear of the necessity of financial support from the home- 
 land apparently being at least partly responsible. 

But the indomitable spirit of the pioneers finally over- 
 came all obstacles, and in 1766 Queen's College was char- 
 tered. In this first era, Dutch influence remained consider- 
 able. At that time the activities of the college were mainly 
 restricted to those of a theological seminary, and many of 
 the professors had studied in the Netherlands and received 
 their degree of Doctor of Divinity at one of the Dutch 
 universities. Probably the last one to do so was your great 
 president, John H. Livingston. At the University of 
 Utrecht, a bronze tablet erected in 1909 by the trustees, 
 faculty, alumni, and friends of Rutgers College commemo- 
 rates their appreciation for the part the university played 
 in the cultivation of Livingston's scholarship. The inscrip- 
 tion refers to the university as ''Mater Almae Matris 
 Nostrae." 

For this reason, I am particularly happy that the Rector 
 Magnificus of the University of Utrecht has authorized 
 me to offer to Rutgers University on this notable occasion 
 the respectful and fraternal greetings and warmest con- 
 gratulations of the Utrecht Academic Senate. 

It seems appropriate now to review briefly the events 
 that have led to our gathering at this moment at this par- 
 ticular spot. We all realize that the Institute we dedicate 
 today is a direct outcome of the great heights that agri- 
 cultural science has attained at Rutgers University. In 
 turn, this is clearly connected with the high level of agri- 
 culture and horticulture in New Jersey, which earned it 
 the epithet "Garden State." 

I hope you can forgive a scientist for feeling the need to 
 inquire into the causes of this particular aspect of the 
 wealth of New Jersey, for despite the enormous industrial 
 development that has taken place in recent years, "truck 
 farming" is certainly still one of the pillars of the state's 
 economy.
