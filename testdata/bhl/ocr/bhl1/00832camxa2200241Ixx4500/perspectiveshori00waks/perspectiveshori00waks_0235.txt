 wheat, rye, and barley. He finally states that to the Dutch 
 goes credit also for the early introduction of the best foun- 
 dation stock of horses and cattle. He further mentions the 
 importation of hogs and numerous types of domestic fowl. 

Altogether, I do not think I go too far in concluding 
 that Dutch farming experience, and plants and animals 
 of Dutch stock, have been mainly responsible for laying 
 the foundations on which rests the well deserved fame of 
 New Jersey as the Garden State. 

This digression may find its justification in the fact that 
 it assists in explaining exactly why New Jersey has been 
 such a fertile soil for development of the agricultural 
 sciences. This development can be said to have started in 
 1864 when the State of New Jersey assigned to Rutgers 
 College the responsibilities and benefits of the Land-Grant 
 Act of the Congress of the United States. Rutgers has re- 
 sponded nobly to this assignment. In 1939, Dr. Waksman, 
 in his article entitled "Cook-Voorhees-Lipman: Contribu- 
 tions of Rutgers to Soil Science," paid warm tribute to 
 the eminent scientists who earned a world reputation for 
 the New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station, the or- 
 ganization through which the Rutgers efforts in this field 
 have been channeled since 1880. Moreover, the attractive 
 booklet that appeared only three years ago on the occasion 
 of the dedication of Lipman Hall testifies in a convincing 
 way to the fundamental contributions to soil science made 
 by Rutgers. 

Suffice it here to mention a few facts that may be deemed 
 to be directly responsible for today's ceremony. We must 
 first go back to the foresight of Dr. Edward B. Voorhees, 
 who as early as 1895 started investigations of soil micro- 
 biology and in 1901 established a separate Department of 
 Soil Chemistry and Bacteriology, the first of its kind in the 
 United States.
