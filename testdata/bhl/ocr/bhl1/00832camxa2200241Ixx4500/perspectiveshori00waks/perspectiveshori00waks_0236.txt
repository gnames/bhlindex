218 Perspecfives in Microbiology 

studies in microbiology, it is worth mentioning that the 
 first Nichols Gold Medal of the American Chemical So- 
 ciety was awarded to the bacteriologists Voorhees and Steel 
 for their paper entitled "Studies in Denitrification." 

The initiative taken by Voorhees was magnificently car- 
 ried on by Dr. Jacob G. Lipman, who in 1911 succeeded 
 him as director of the Experiment Station. Of the many 
 great merits of Lipman, I mention only his clear recog- 
 nition of the vastness of the domain in soil microbiology 
 that was still waiting for scientific exploration. He made 
 several valuable contributions to our knowledge of the 
 microflora of the soil, and in numerous reviews and books 
 did a great deal to stimulate interest in the field. In the 
 outstanding journal Soil Science^ which he founded and 
 of which he was editor-in-chief until his death, he erected 
 an imperishable monument to himself. Finally, he proved 
 his great wisdom in the selection of collaborators worthy 
 of the high reputation of the Experiment Station. Of these 
 I will mention only two: Dr. Selman A. Waksman, who 
 entered the station in 1918 and who succeeded Lipman 
 after his death in 1939, and Dr. Robert L. Starkey, who 
 joined his staff in 1926. 

Both scientists are here in our midst. I need not discuss 
 the highly important work they have done that has made 
 the New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station the mecca 
 of soil microbiologists from all over the world. Character- 
 istic of the way in which the problems of soil microbi- 
 ology have been attacked here is the purely scientific spirit 
 in which the investigations have been conducted. Increased 
 knowledge of the microbial world in its divergent mani- 
 festations has always been the leading principle. 

Studies of this type usually fail to impress the general 
 public, but as the representative of so many microbiolo- 
 gists assembled here, I think I may and should testify that 
 our admiration for Dr. Waksman as a scientist dates back
