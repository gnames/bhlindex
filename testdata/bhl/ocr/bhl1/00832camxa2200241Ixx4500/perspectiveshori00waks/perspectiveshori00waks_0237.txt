From Dutch Sefflemenfs fo the Institute 219 

to a time long before the words "antibiotics" and "strepto- 
 mycin" were coined. 

Pasteur once remarked: "Le hasard ne favorise que les 
 ames preparees" (chance favors only those who are pre- 
 pared). For insiders it is quite clear that this dictum also 
 applies to the great discovery of streptomycin. If Dr. 
 Waksman had not made such extensive studies on the 
 actinomycetes as long ago as the 1910's, in a period in 
 which almost no one had any interest in this microbial 
 group, and if Dr. Waksman had not so thoroughly investi- 
 gated the fate of certain microbes in the soil, thus throw- 
 ing a clear light on the chemical warfare in which so many 
 microbial types are continuously engaged, this ceremonial 
 meeting would never have been held. 

For this reason, the microbiologists of the world wish 
 to honor Dr. Waksman above all as the disinterested man 
 of science who for almost forty years has made so many 
 important contributions to pure microbiology. But in ad- 
 dition, we do not lack in admiration for the great ingenuity 
 and the exemplary perseverance with which he pursued 
 his studies as soon as it became clear that microbial an- 
 tagonism could be directly applied to the alleviation of the 
 sufferings of mankind. Nor can we fail to express our deep 
 appreciation for the fact that he has directed certain ma- 
 terial consequences of his work in such a way that they 
 resulted in the splendid institute we dedicate today. 

The prospects of the new institute seem bright. It has 
 been designed and equipped by a man who won his spurs 
 in the field. Moreover, the same man will be its first di- 
 rector and determine its course. Anyone who has read the 
 recent article on the man of sixty-five in the British medi- 
 cal journal Lancet will agree with its general conclusion: 
 "Do not put him on the shelf." On the contrary, realizing 
 how greatly our standard of old age has changed in recent 
 decades, we are certain that his accumulated wisdom will
