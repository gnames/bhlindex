220 Perspectives in Microbiology 

prove to be an invaluable asset, and to his guidance we all 
 look forward with the greatest confidence. 

In the name of the microbiologists of all nations, I 
 herewith offer to the new Institute of Microbiology our 
 very best wishes for its lasting prosperity. The institute 
 has been born of microbial antagonism. May it forever 
 be a symbol of human symbiosis, and may it flourish to 
 the benefit of our beloved science and of mankind as a 
 whole. 

Mr. President, I extend to you our warmest congratu- 
 lations on the scientifically highly important addition that 
 today is made to your already renowned university. 

In concluding, I may perhaps formulate one more wish. 
 It was your former President Livingston, who, inspired by 
 the motto of the University of Utrecht, Sol justitiae illustra 
 nos, chose as the motto of Rutgers University, Sol justitiae 
 et occidentem illustra. May the time not be far off when 
 the sun of righteousness will shine equally brightly upon 
 both Occident and Orient. But regardless of developments 
 elsewhere, may it forever illuminate Rutgers University.
