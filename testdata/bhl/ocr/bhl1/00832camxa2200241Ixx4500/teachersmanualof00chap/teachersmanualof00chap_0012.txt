 with them. 

Still, it will be obviously impossible for the stu- 
 dent to cover the whole field of ornithology, and 
 the question arises, to what phase of the subject 
 he should give special attention. 

There are teachers who believe that classification 
 is the principal object of natural history study, and 
 the aim and end of their instruction is to teach the 
 pupil the names of Orders and Families, and the 
 characters on which they are based. So far as birds 
 are concerned, the plan is excellent as a preliminary 
 step, but to m}^ mind it is of infinitely greater im- 
 portance to be able to recognize a Wood Thrush or a 
 Yeery than to define the Lamellirostral Grallatores. 

In this book structure and classification have, 
 therefore, been subordinated to matter which will 
 be of practical assistance to the student in identify- 
 ing the birds about his home, and in teaching him 
 to appreciate their economic, aesthetic, and scientific 
 value. 

If he lives in the country, this information may be 
 of service to him daily ; and this, it seems to me, is 
 a far more profitable kind of ornithology than that 
 which treats only of ^'Orders," and '^Families," 
 and ' ' leading types ' ' which he will probably never 
 see outside of a museum or a zoological garden. 

Acting on this belief, I have written of the living, 
 rather than of the dead bird, and no attempt, there- 
 fore, has been made to describe the anatomy of 
 birds, but, in preference, the questions of economics, 
 aesthetics, form and habit, color, migration, song, 
 nesting, etc., have been dwelt on with the ob-
