THE BIED: ITS PLACE IN NATURE AND 
 RELATION TO MAN. 

The Bird's Place in Nature."^ — About thirteen 
 thousand species of birds are known to science. The 
 structure of many of these has been carefully studied, 
 and all have been classified, at least provisionally. 
 Taken as a whole, the class Aves, in which all birds are 
 placed, is more clearly defined than any other group of 
 the higher animals. That is, the most unlike birds are 
 more closely allied than are the extremes among mam- 
 mals, fishes, or reptiles, and all living birds possess the 
 distinctive characters of their class. 

When compared with other animals, birds are found 
 to occupy second place in the scale of life. They stand 
 between mammals and reptiles, and are more closely re- 
 lated to the latter than to the former. In fact, certain 
 extinct birds so clearly connect living birds with rep- 
 tiles, that these two classes are sometimes placed in one 
 group — the Sauropsida.
