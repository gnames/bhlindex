4 DISTRIBUTION OF BIRDS. 

in minor points, is still near enough to the truth to give 
 a correct idea of this extraordinary bird's appearance. 

The Archgeopteryx was about the size of a Crow. Its 
 long, feathered tail is supposed to have acted as an aero- 
 plane, assisting in the support of the bird while it was 
 in the air, but its power of flight was doubtless limited. 
 It was arboreal and probably never descended to the 
 earth, but chmbed about the branches of trees, using its 
 large, hooked fingers in passing from limb to limb. 

The wanderings of this almost quadrupedal creature 
 must necessarily have been limited, but its winged de- 
 scendants of to-day are more generally distributed than 
 are any other animals.* They roam the earth from pole 
 to pole ; they are equally at home on a wave-washed 
 coral reef or in an arid desert, amid arctic snows or in 
 the shades of a tropical forest. This is due not alone to 
 their powers of flight but to their adaptability to vary- 
 ing conditions of life. Although, as I have said, birds 
 are more closely related among themselves than are the 
 members of either of the other higher groups of animals, 
 and all birds agree in possessing the more important 
 distinguishing characters of their class, yet they show a 
 wide range of variation in structure. 

This, in most instances, is closely related to habits,
