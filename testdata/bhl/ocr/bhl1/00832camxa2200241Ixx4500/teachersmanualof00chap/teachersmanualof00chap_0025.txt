RELATION OF BIRDS TO MAX. 5 

wliich in birds are doubtless more varied than in any 
 of the other higher animals. Some birds, like Penguins, 
 are so acjuatic that they are practically helpless on land. 
 Their wings are too small to support them in the air, but 
 they tiy under water with great rapidity, and might be 
 termed feathered porpoises. Others, like the Ostrich, 
 are terrestrial, and can neither fly nor swim. Others 
 still, like the Frigate Birds, are aerial. Their small 
 feet are of use only in perching, and their home is in 
 the air. 

If now we should compare specimens of Penguins, 
 Ostriches, and Frigate-birds with each other, and with 
 such widely different forms as Hummingbirds, Wood- 
 peckers, Parrots, and others, we would realize still more 
 clearly the remarkable amount of variation shown by 
 birds. This great difference in form is accompanied by a 
 corresponding variation in habit, making possible, as 
 before remarked, the wide distribution of birds, which, 
 together with their size and abundance, renders them of 
 incalculable importance to man. Their economic value, 
 however, may be more properly spoken of under 

The Relation of Birds to 21 an. — The relation of birds 
 to man is threefold — the scientific, the economic, and the 
 aesthetic. No animals form more profitable subjects for 
 the scientist than birds. The embryologist, the moi-phol- 
 ogist, and the systematist, the philosophic naturalist and 
 the psychologist, all may find in them exhaustless mate- 
 rial for study. It is not my purpose, however, to speak 
 here of the science of ornithology. Let us learn some- 
 thing of the bird in its haunts before taking it to the 
 laboratory. The living bird can not fail to attract us; 
 the dead bird — voiceless, motionless — we will leave for 
 future dissection. 

The economic value of birds to man lies in the service 
 they render in preventing the undue in^Tcase of insects.
