ECONOMIC VALUE OP BIRDS. 7 

Birds digest their food so rapidly, that it is difficult to 
 estimate from the contents of a bird's stomach at a given 
 time how nmch it eats during the day. The stomach of a 
 Yellow-billed Cuckoo, shot at six o'clock in the morning, 
 contained the partially digested remains of forty-three 
 tent caterpillars, but how many it would have eaten be- 
 fore nio^ht no one can sav. 

Mr. E. II. Forbush, Ornithologist of the Board of 
 Agriculture of Massachusetts, states that the stomachs 
 of four Chickadees contained one thousand and twenty- 
 eight eggs of the cankerworm. The stomachs of four 
 other birds of the same species contained about six 
 hundred eggs and one hundred and ^ve female moths 
 of the cankerworm. The average number of eggs 
 found in twenty of these moths was one hundred and 
 eighty-five ; and as it is estimated that a Chickadee may 
 eat thirty female cankerworm moths per day during 
 the twenty -five days which these moths crawl up trees, 
 it follows that in this period each Chickadee would de- 
 stroy one hundred and thirty-eight thousand seven hun- 
 dred and fifty eggs of this noxious insect. 

Professor Forbes, Director of the Illinois State Lab- 
 oratory of J^atural History, found one hundred and 
 seventy-five larvse of Bihio — a fly which in the larval 
 stage feeds on the roots of grass — in the stomach of a 
 single Bobin, and the intestine contained probably as 
 many more. 

Many additional cases could be cited, showing the 
 intimate relation of birds to insect-life, and emphasizing 
 the necessity of protecting and encouraging these little- 
 appreciated allies of the agriculturist. 

The service rendered man by birds in killing the 
 small rodents so destructive to crops is performed by 
 Hawks and Owls — birds the uninformed farmer con- 
 siders his enemies. The truth is that, with two excep-
