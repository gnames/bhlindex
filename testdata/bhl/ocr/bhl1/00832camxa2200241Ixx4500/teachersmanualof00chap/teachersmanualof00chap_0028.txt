8 ECONOMIC VALUE OF BIRDS. 

tions, the Sharp-shinned and Cooper's Hawk, all our com- 
 moner Hawks and Owls are beneficial. In his exhaust- 
 ive study of the foods of these birds Dr. A. K. Fisher, 
 Assistant Ornithologist of the United States Department 
 of Agriculture, has found that ninety per cent of the 
 food of the Ked-shouldered Hawk, commonly called 
 " Chicken Hawk " or " Hen Hawk," consists of injurious 
 mammals and insects, while two hundred castings of the 
 Barn Owl contained the skulls of four hundred and fifty- 
 four small mammals, no less tlian two hundred and twenty- 
 five of these being skulls of the destructive field or meadow 
 mouse. 

Still, these birds are not only not protected, but in 
 some States a price is actually set upon their heads! 
 Dr. C. Hart Merriam, Ornithologist and Mammalogist 
 of the United States Department of Agriculture, has 
 estimated that in oifering a bounty on Hawks and Owls, 
 w^hich resulted in the killing of over one hundred thou- 
 sand of these birds, the State of Pennsylvania sustained a 
 loss of nearly four million dollars in one year and a half ! 

As destroyers of the seeds of harmful plants, the good 
 done by birds can not be overestimated. From late fall 
 to early spring, seeds form the only food of many birds, 
 and every keeper of cage-birds can realize how many a 
 bird may eat in a day. Thus, while the Chickadees, IS'ut- 
 hatches. Woodpeckers, and some other winter birds are 
 ridding the trees of myriads of insects' eggs and larvae, 
 the granivorous birds are reaping a crop of seeds which, 
 if left to germinate, would cause a heavy loss to our agri- 
 cultural interests. 

As scavengers we understand that certain birds are of 
 value to us, and therefore we protect them. Thus the 
 Vultures or Buzzards of the South are protected both by 
 law and public sentiment, and as a result they are not 
 only exceedingly abundant, but remarkably tame. But
