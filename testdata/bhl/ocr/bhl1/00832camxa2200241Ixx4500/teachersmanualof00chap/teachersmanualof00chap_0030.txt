10 iESTHETIC RELATIO:tfS OF BIRDS. 

birds, their grace of motion and musical powers, we must 
 know tliem. Then, too, we will be attracted by their 
 high mental development, or what I have elsewhere 
 spoken of as "their human attributes. Man exhibits 
 hardly a trait which he will not find reflected in the life 
 of a bird. Love, hate ; courage, fear ; anger, pleasure ; 
 vanity, modesty ; virtue, vice ; constancy, fickleness ; gen- 
 erosity, selfishness; wit, curiosity, memory, reason â€” we 
 may find them all exhibited in the lives of birds. Birds 
 have thus become sjonbolic of certain human character- 
 istics, and the more common species are so interwoven in 
 our art and literature that by name at least they are 
 known to all of us." 

The sight of a bird or the sound of its voice is at all 
 times an event of such significance to me, a source of 
 such unfailing pleasure, that when I go afield with those 
 to whom birds are strangers, I am deeply impressed by 
 the comparative barrenness of their world, for they live 
 in ignorance of the great store of enjoyment which might 
 be theirs for the asking. 

I count each day memorable that brought me a new 
 friend among the birds. It was an event to be recorded 
 in detail. A creature which, up to that moment, existed
