ESTHETIC RELATIONS OF BIRDS. 13 

ist I have ever met has coiiviiicinglj ilhistrated. I could 
 name nearly a dozen, living and dead, whom it has been 
 my valued privilege to know. All had passed the allotted 
 threescore and ten, and some were over fourscore. The 
 friends and associates of their earlier days had passed 
 away, and one might imagine that they had no interest 
 in life and were simply waiting for the end. 

But these veterans were old in years only. Their 
 hearts were young. The earth was fair; plants still 
 bloomed, and birds sang for them. There was no idle 
 waiting here ; the days were all too short. AYith what 
 boyish ardor they told of some recent discovery ; what 
 inspiration there was in their enthusiasm ! 

So I say to you, if you would reap the purest pleas- 
 ures of youth, manhood, and old age, go to the birds and 
 through them be brought within the ennobling influences 
 of Kature.
