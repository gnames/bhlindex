EVOLUTION OF BIRDS. 

ers, Woodliewers, and Swifts, even some Finclies and 
 the Bobolink, that use their tail to support them when 
 perched on swaying reeds, have the feathers more or 
 less pointed and stiffened. Furthermore, this is just the 
 result we should expect from a habit of this kind. But

I do not understand how the Woodpecker's spear-tipped 
 tongue could have resulted from the habit of impaling 
 grubs, and in this case I should be inclined to regard 
 structure as due to a natural selection which has pre- 
 served favorable variations in the form of this organ. 

I have not space to discuss this subject more fully, 
 but trust that enough has been said to so convince you 
 of the significance of habit, that when you see a bird in 
 the bush it will not seem a mere automaton, but in each 
 movement will give you evidence of a nice adjustment 
 to its surroundings. Eemember, too, that evolution is a 
 thing of the present as well as of the past. We may not 
 be able to read the earlier pages in the history of a species, 
 but the record of to-day is open to us if we can learn to 
 interpret it. 

This may be made clearer, and the importance of a 
 study of habit be emphasized, if I briefly outline the rela- 
 tion between the wings, tail, feet, and bill of birds and 
 the manner in which they are used. We are in the field, 
 not in the dissecting room ; our instrument is a field glass, 
 not a scalpel, and in learning the functions of these four
