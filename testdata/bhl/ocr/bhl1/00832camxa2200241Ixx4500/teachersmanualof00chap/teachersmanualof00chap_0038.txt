tatiis). The young of this bird have well-developed claws 
 on the thumb and first finger, and long before they can 
 fly they use them as aids in clambering about the bushes, 
 very nnicli as we may imagine the Archjeopteryx did. 
 In the adult these claws are wanting. 

Some eminently aquatic birds, as Grebes and Pen- 
 guins, when on land, may use their wings as fore legs in 
 scrambling awkwardly along ; while some flightless birds, 
 for example, the Ostrich, spread their wings when run- 
 ning. 

But let us consider the wing in its true office, that of 
 an organ of flight, showing its range of variation, and 

finally its degradation into 
 a flightless organ. Among 
 flying birds the spread 
 wings measure in extent

 in the Wandering Albatross. The relation between 
 shape of wing and style of flight is so close that if you 
 show an ornithologist a bird's wing he can generally 
 tell you the character of its owner's flight. The ex- 
 tremes are shown by the short-winged ground birds,
