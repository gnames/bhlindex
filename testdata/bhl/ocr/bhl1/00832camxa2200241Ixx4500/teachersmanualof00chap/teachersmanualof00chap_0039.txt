FORM AND HABIT: TUE WING. 19 

birds, important relation between form and ba])it. 
 Many terrestrial species rely on their dull, protective 
 covering to escape observation, taking wing only when 
 dani^er is so near that it is necessary for them to get 
 under way at once. Consequently, Quail, Partridges, 
 and Grouse, much to the amateur sportsman's discom- 
 iiture, spring from the ground as though thrown from 
 a catapult, and reach their highest speed within a few 
 yards of the starting point, while the Albatross is obliged 
 to face the wind and run some distance over the ground 
 or water before slowly hfting itself into the air. There, 
 however, it can remain for hours or even days without 
 once alio:htinor. 

The Frigate Bird, or Man-o'-War Bird, has a body 
 scarcely larger than that of a chicken, but its tail is one 
 foot and a half in length, and its Avings measure seven to

eight feet in extent. Having this enormous spread of 
 sail, its flight is more easy and graceful than that of any 
 living bird. I have seen hundreds of these birds floating 
 in the air, facing the wind, without apparent change of 
 position or the movement of a pinion, for long intervals 
 of time. 

From this extreme development of the wing as a 
 flight-organ, let us turn to those birds wdio have not 
 the power of flight. The Ostrich, Rhea, Emu, and 
 Cassowary are familar representatives of this group. It 
 is generally believed that these birds have lost the power
