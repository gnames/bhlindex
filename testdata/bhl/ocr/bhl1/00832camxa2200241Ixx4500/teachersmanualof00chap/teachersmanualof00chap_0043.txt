me take you iiii:illy to the poultry yard, wlicre in tlie 
 waddling Duck you will see an undeniable instance of 
 defeneration. 

As the seat of sexual characters the wing is some- 
 times most singularly developed or adorned. The males 
 of the Argus Pheasant and Pennant-winged Nightjar 
 have certain feathers enormously lengthened ; the Stand- 
 ard-bearer has white plumes growing from the wing ; and 
 there are many other cases in which the wing presents sex- 
 ual characters, not alone through display, but also by 
 use as a musical organ. I do not refer to the whistling- 
 sound made by the wings of flying Doves or Ducks, or 
 the humming of Hummingbirds, but to sounds volun- 
 tarily produced by birds, and evidently designed to an- 
 swer the purpose of song. 

A simple form of this kind of " music " is shown by 
 the cock in clapping his wings before crowing, in the 
 " dmmming " of Grouse, or in the " booming " of Kight- 
 hawks, as with wings set they dive from a height earth- 
 ward. The male Cassique {Ostinops) of South America, 
 after giving voice to notes which sound like those pro- 
 duced by chafing trees in a gale, leans far forward, 
 spreads and raises his large orange and black tail, then 
 vigorously claps his wings together over his back, mak- 
 ing a noise which so resembles the cracking of branches 
 that one imagines the birds learned this singular per- 
 formance during a gale. 

The birds mentioned thus far have no especial wing 
 structure beyond rather stiif ened â€¢ feathers ; but in the 
 Woodcock, some Paradise-birds and Flycatchers, Guans, 
 Pipras, and other tropical birds, certain wing-feathers 
 are singularly modified as musical instruments. Some- 
 times the outer primaries are so narrowed that little but 
 the shaft or midrib is left, as in both sexes of the Wood- 
 cock, when the rapid wing-strokes are accompanied by a
