FORM AND HABIT: THE FEET. 

water-loving Divers, Auks, Gulls, Cormorants, and Ducks. 
 In tlie wading Herons and marsli-inhabiting Kails and 
 Gallinules tlie web is absent, but it reappears in the form 
 of lobes on tlie toes of the aquatic Coots of the same 
 family. 

Some shore -inhabiting Snipe have the bases of the 
 toes united by webs, but the Phalaropes, of two species, 
 have lobed toes not unlike those of the Coots, and are 
 true swimming Snipe living on the sea for long periods. 

Length of foot is largely dependent upon length of 
 neck. This is illustrated by the Herons, and is particu- 
 larly well shown by the 

long-necked 

Flamingo, 

which has a foot twelve 
 inches long. Its toes 
 are webbed, and it can 
 wade in deep water and 
 search for food on the 
 bottom by immersing 
 its long neck and its 
 head. 

In the tropical Ja- 
 canas the toes and toe- 
 nails are much length- 
 ened, enabling the bird 
 to pass over the water 
 on aquatic plants. I 
 have seen these birds 
 walking on small lily 
 leaves, which sank be- 
 neath their weight, giv- 
 ing one the impression 

that they were walking on the water (see Fig. 10). 

Many ground-feeding birds use the feet in scratching 

for food ; Chickens are familiar examples. Towhees and
