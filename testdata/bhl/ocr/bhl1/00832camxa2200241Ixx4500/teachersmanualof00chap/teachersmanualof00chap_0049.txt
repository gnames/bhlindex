Sparrows use both feet in Bearcliing for food, jumping 
 quickly backward and throwing tlio leaves behind them. 

Parrots use their foot as a hand. Some Hawks carry 
 nesting material in it, and all birds of 
 prey strike their quarry with their 
 strongly curved claws, which are then 
 used to carry, or hold it while it is 
 being torn by the bill. The foot of 
 the Fish Hawk is a magnificent organ. 
 The nails are strong and well curved ; 
 the inner surface of the toes is set with 
 sharp, horny spikes, and the outer toe 
 is partly reversible, so that the bird 
 grasps its slippery prey from four dif- 
 ferent points. 

As a vreapon the foot is especially 
 effective, the use of spurs being too 
 well known to require comment. Os- 
 triches kick with their feet, and can, it is said, deliver a 
 blow powerful enough to fell a man. 

But by far the best instance of modification in the 
 structure of the feet is furnished by Grouse. It is an
