FORM AND HABIT: THE BILL. 31 

perform their toilet, and, pressing a drop of oil from the 
 gland at the root of the tail, they dress their feathers 
 with their bill. Parrots use the bill in climbing, and 
 its hawklike shape in these birds is an unusual instance 
 of siniilai-ity in structure accompanying different habits. 

Birds which do not strike with their feet may use 
 the bill as a weapon, but the manner in which it is em- 
 ployed corresponds so closely with the method by which 
 a bird secures its food, that as a weapon the bill pre- 
 sents no special modifications. In constructing the nest 
 the bill may be used as a trowel, an auger, a needle, a 
 chisel, and as several other tools. 

But as a hand the bill's most important office is that 
 of procuring food ; and wonderful indeed are the forms 
 it assumes to supply the appetites of birds who may 
 require a drop of nectar or a tiny insect from the heart 
 of a flower, a snake from the marshes, a clam or mussel 
 from the ocean's beach, or a fish from its waters. The 
 bill, therefore, becomes a forceps, lever, chisel, hook, 
 hammer, awl, probe, spoon, spear, sieve, net, and knife — 
 in short, there is almost no limit to its shape and uses. 

With Hummingbirds the shape of the bill is appar- 
 ently related to the flowers from which the bird most 
 frequently procures its food. It ranges in length from 
 a quarter of an inch in the 
 Small-billed Hummer {Micro- 
 rhynchiiH) to five inches in 
 the Siphon- bill {Docimastes\
