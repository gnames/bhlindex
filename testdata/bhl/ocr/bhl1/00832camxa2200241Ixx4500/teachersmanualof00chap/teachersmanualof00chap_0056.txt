36 COLOR AND AGE. 

Color and Age. — All birds have a special nestling 
 plumage. With those that run or swim at birth, such 
 as Grouse, Snipe, and Ducks, this is a full suit of down, 
 which may be worn for several weeks. "With those 
 birds which are helpless when hatched — for instance, 
 Robins, Sparrows, and Orioles — this downy covering is 
 so scanty that they are practically naked. This bii'th 
 dress is followed by a new growth, knowoi as the " first 
 plumage." Down-covered birds do not acquire this for 
 some time, but with those birds that are born nearly 
 naked it begins to grow soon after they are hatched, and 
 is almost complete when they leave the nest. The first 
 plumage is often unlike that of either parent ; for ex- 
 ample, the spotted plumage of the Robin. It is worn for 
 several months by some species — certain Snipe and others 
 — but with most land birds it is soon exchanged for the 
 costume they will wear through the winter, usually 
 termed the "immature plumage." This may resemble 
 that of either parent respectively — that is, immature 
 males may be like adult males and immature females like 
 adult females, as with the Bob-white and Cardinal Gros- 
 beak ; or the immature birds of both sexes may resemble 
 the adult female, as with the Hummingbird and BoboHnk. 
 Again, the immature birds of both sexes may be unlike 
 either of the adults, as with the Eagle and most Hawks ; 
 or the immature female may resemble the adult female, 
 while the immature male is unlike either parent, as in the 
 case of the Rose-breasted Grosbeak and Scarlet Tanager. 
 Wlien both parents are alike, the young generally resem- 
 ble them, and this happens among most of our land birds ; 
 for example, the Flycatchers, Crows and Jays, many 
 Sparrows, Yireos, Wrens, and Thrushes. 

Immature birds, differing from the adults, may ac- 
 quire the adult plumage the next spring, as with the 
 Bobolink, or they may then don a second or transition
