Color and Season. — Quite apart from tlie clianges in 
 color due to age, a bird may throughout its life change 
 costumes with the seasons. Thus, the male Bobolink 
 after the nesting season, exchanges his black, white, and 
 bull* nn])tial suit for a spanowlike dress resembling that 
 of his mate. The Scarlet Tanager sheds his gay body 
 plumage and puts on the olive-green colors of the fe- 
 male, without changing, however, the color of his black 
 wings and tail. The following spring both birds resume 
 the more conspicuous coats. A more or less similar 
 change takes place among many birds in which the male 
 is brighter than tlic female, but, among land l)irds, when 
 the adults of both sexes are alike, there is little or no 
 seasonal change in color. 

The Molt!^ — These changes in plumage, as far as they 
 are understood, are accomplished by the molt, frequently 
 followed by a wearing off of the diiferently colored ter- 
 minal fringe wdiich is found on the new feathers of some 
 birds. It has been stated that birds change color without 
 changing their plumage, either by a chemical alteration 
 in the pigment of the feathers resulting in a new color, 
 or by the actual gain of new pigment from the body ; but 
 I know of no instance in which this has been proved, nor 
 do I believe that the latter change is possible. The whole 
 subject offers an excellent field for observation and ex- 
 periment. 

There is a great and as yet but little understood 
 variation in the molting of birds. Not only may closely
