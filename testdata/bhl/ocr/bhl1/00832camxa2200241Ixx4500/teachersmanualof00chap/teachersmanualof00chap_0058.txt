THE MOLT. 

related species molt differently, but the manner and time 
 of molting among individuals of the same species may 
 vary according to their sex, age, and physical condition. 

At the close of the nesting season all birds renew 
 their entire plumage by molting. The following spring, 
 before the nesting season, most birds molt their body 
 feathers, retaining those of the wing and tail. A few, 
 however, like the Bobolink, have a complete molt at 
 this season also. Others molt only a few of the body 
 feathers, while some birds are adorned at this season 
 with special nuptial plumes. 

The beautiful aigrette plumes of the Heron consti- 
 tute a nuptial dress of this kind. It is for these plumes 
 that the birds have been slaughtered in such enormous 
 numbers that if the demand continues they will speedily 
 become extinct. 

Some birds, whose fall plumage is edged with a dif- 
 ferently colored tip to each feather, do not molt in the 
 spring, but acquire their wedding dress by the slow wear- 
 ing off of the fringes to the feathers which have dis-

guised them during the winter. The Snowilake, for 
 instance, changes from brown and brownish white to 
 pure black and white by losing the brown tips which 
 have concealed the black or white bases of his feathers.
