COLOR AND FOOD. 39 

Much remains to ])e learned on this siihject of tlie 
 molt, and, although coniinement is known to affect its 
 manner and extent, I believe intelligent observation of 
 caged birds will lead to really valuable results. 

Coloi" and Food. — In some instances it is known that 
 a bird's color is affected by the nature of its food. It is 
 a common practice among bird fanciers to alter the color 
 of Canaries from yellow to orange-red by feeding them 
 on red pepper. This food, however, is said to have no 
 effect upon adult birds, but must be fed to nestlings. Sau- 
 ermann's experiments, as quoted by Beddard, show that 
 the red color is not caused by the capsicin or red 2)ig- 
 ment in the pepper, but by a fatty substance termed 
 triolein. Fed to white fowls, their breasts became red, 
 while the rest of the plumage remained unchanged. It 
 is also stated that dealers alter the color of green Parrots 
 to yellow by feeding them on the fat of certain iishes. 

Flamingoes and Scarlet Ibises when kept in capti^-ity 
 lose their bright red colors and become dingy pink or 
 even soiled white, and some animal dealers have acquired 
 a reputation for restoring their natural tints by supplying 
 them with food the nature of which is kept a secret. 

Our Purple Finch turns to yellow in captivity. An 
 adult male now in my possession is undergoing his second 
 molt since capture a year ago, and it will evidently leave 
 him without a single red feather. Other wild birds 
 when caoced are known to assume more or less abnormal 
 plumages, due, it is supposed, to change in food. There 
 is, however, very little exact information on this subject, 
 and it offers an excellent opportunity for the patient in- 
 vestigator. 

Color and Climate!*' — Color is a much more variable 
 character than form. There are but few instances in
