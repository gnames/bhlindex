40 COLOR AXD CLIMATE. 

wliicli we can show tlie cause of a given structure ; but 
 color responds more quickly to tlie influence of sur- 
 roundings, and in many cases we can point to cause and 
 effect witli some certainty. 

This is best illustrated by the relation between climate 
 and color. Briefly, it has been found that birds are 
 darkest in humid regions and palest in arid regions. 

This at first thought seems of small moment, but in 
 reality it is one of the most important facts established 
 by ornithologists. It is an undeniable demonstration of 
 " evolution by environment " — that is, the bird's color is 
 in part due to the conditions under which it'> lives. 

For example, our common Song Sparrow, which in- 
 habits the greater part of North America, varies so 
 greatly in color in different parts of its range that no 
 less than eleven subspecies or geographical races are 
 known to ornithologists. The extremes are found in the 
 arid deserts of Arizona, where the annual rainfall aver- 
 ages eight inches, and on the humid Pacific coast from 
 Washington to Alaska, where the annual rainfall averages 
 about eighty inches. 

The Arizona Song Sparrows are pale, sandy colored 
 birds, while those from Alaska are dark, sooty brown. 
 One would imagine them to be different species ; but 
 unlike as are these extremes, they, A\dth the other nine 
 races in this group, are found to intergrade in those re- 
 gions where the climatic conditions themselves undergo 
 a change. That is, as we pass from an arid into a humid 
 region, the birds gradually get darker as the average 
 rainfall increases. 

If now we study other birds li^-ing in these regions, 
 we find that many of them, especially the resident species, 
 are similarly affected by the prevailing climatic influ- 
 ences — that is, many Arizona birds are bleached and 
 faded in appearance, while all the thirty odd xs"orthwest
