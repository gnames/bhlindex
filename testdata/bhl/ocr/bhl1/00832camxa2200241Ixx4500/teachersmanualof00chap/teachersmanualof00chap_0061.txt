COLOR AND ] I AUNT AND HABIT. 41 

Paciiic coast races are darker or more licavily streaked 
 or harrcd tliaii any of tlieir conujciiers. It is of impor- 
 tance to observe that these dilfereiices are shown by 
 yonng birds in fresli }>hiinaoe — evidence that the charac- 
 ters ac(jnired tliroui;-]! cHniate have been inherited. 

There are many similar cases, but some species seem 
 more easily affected than others, and throni::;]iout their 
 ranges are markedly affected ]>y the conditions under 
 which they live. Thus we have nine races of Screech 
 Owl, eleven of Horned Lark, six of Junco, etc. 

These races, or subspecies, are species in process of 
 formation. The extremes are still connected hj inter- 
 mediate or natural links, but if, through any cause, these 
 intermediates should disappear, the extremes would then 
 be left as distinct species. 

Color and Ilaxint and IlaVd. — The relation of a 
 bird's color to its haunts and habits is a complex sub- 
 ject. Any attempt at its explanation should be based on 
 so exact a knowledge of iX\Q facts in the case, that I can not 
 too strongly emphasize here the necessity for observations 
 in the field. Oidy a close study of the living bird will 
 justify us in advancing theories to account for its coloration. 

Many explanations have been offered to account for 
 certain colors and markings of birds, but often, I fear, 
 without adequate knowledge of the bird's habits. I 
 shall speak of only four classes of colors ; they are 
 protective^ deceptive^ recognition^ and sexual colors. 

Protective colors render a bird inconspicuous in order 
 that it may escape its enemies. Deceptive colors render 
 it inconspicuous in order that it may more easily approach 
 its prey. In both cases the bird should harmonize in 
 color w^ith its immediate surroundings. 

A survey of the birds of the w^orld shows that on the 
 whole this is true. Thus almost all ground-inhabiting 
 birds, such as Snipe, Plover, Quail, Grouse, Sparrows,
