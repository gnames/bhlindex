42 PROTECTIVE COLORATION. 

are generally dull brown or gray, like tlie ground, leaves, 
 or grasses about them, while tree-haunting birds, espe- 
 cially those that live in the foliage or feed from blossoms, 
 are, as a rule, brightly colored. In this class belong 
 Hummingbirds, Orioles, the gayer - plumaged Pinches, 
 Tanagers, Warblers, aud many others. It is partly 
 owing to this fact that the erroneous idea concerning 
 the brilliant plumage of all tropical birds has become 
 established. The rich vegetation of the tropics furnishes 
 a home to a far greater number of brightly colored birds 
 than are found in temperate regions ; still, tliey are not 
 more numerous than the dull-colored species that live on 
 the tree trunks, in the undergrowth, or on the ground, 
 where, owing to the nature of both their colors and 
 haunts, they are likely to be overlooked. 

Between these two extremes there are numerous in- 
 termediate groups, most of which conform to the general 
 law of protective coloration. There are, it is true, excep- 
 tions, but every close student of bird-life must be so im- 
 pressed with the dangers to which birds are exposed, that 
 he can not doubt that the chief object of color is usually 
 for its wearer's concealment. 

The term " protective coloration " has lately received 
 fresh significance through the studies of Mr. Abbott H. 
 Thayer.* Mr. Thayer proves conclusively that protect- 
 ive coloration lies not so much in an animal's resem- 
 blance in color to its surroundings as in its gradation of 
 color. Thus he points to the fact that, as a rule, animals 
 are darker above than below â€” that is, those parts receiv- 
 ing the most light are darkest, while the j^arts receiving the 
 least light are palest. In effect it follows that the darker 
 upper parts are brightened, while the paler under parts are
