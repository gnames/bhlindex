PROTECTIVE COLORATION. 43 

darkened, tlie result being a nnifonn color, with an ap- 
 parent absence of shadow, tending to render the object 
 invisible. 

Mr. Thayer clearly demonstrates his discovery by 
 using several decoys about the size and shape of a Wood- 
 cock's body. These he places about six inches above the 
 ground on wire uprights, or in a row on a horizontal rod. 
 One of these decoys he colors uniformly, above and be- 
 low, to resemble the earth about it, or he may even give 
 it a fine coating of the earth itself. The upper half of 
 the other decoys is treated in exactly the same manner, 
 but their lower half is graded to a pure white on the me- 
 dian line below. At a distance of forty or fifty yards 
 the uniformly colored decoy can be plainly seen, but 
 those which are white below are entirely invisible until 
 one is within twenty or thirty feet of them. 

After definitely locating these graded decoys the ex- 
 periment may be repeated ; but the result w^ll always be 
 the same. As one slowly retreats from them they w^ill, as 
 by magic, seem to pass out of existence, while the one which 
 is colored alike both above and below can be seen distinctly. 

One of the best arguments for the value of a protect- 
 ive coloration is the fact that the birds themselves are 
 such thorough believers in it. Here we have the reason 
 why — in sportsman's parlance — game birds "lie to a dog." 
 When there is suflicient cover, they trust to their protect- 
 ive coloring to escape detection, and take wing only as 
 a last resort ; but when cover is scanty, they generally 
 rise far out of gunshot. Some Snipe and Sparrows, 
 however, attempt to conceal themselves even on bare 
 sand or worn grass by squatting close to the earth, with 
 which their plumage harmonizes in color. 

A sitting Woodcock had such confidence in its own 
 inWsibility that it permitted itself to be stroked without 
 leaving the nest ; but when a light snow fell, and the
