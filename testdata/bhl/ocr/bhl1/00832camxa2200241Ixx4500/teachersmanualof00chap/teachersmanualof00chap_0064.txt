44 DECEPTIVE COLORATION. 

bird became a conspicuous dark object against a wliite 
 background, it took wing on the first suspicion of danger. 

I could mention many other similar instances, but the 
 careful observer will soon find them included in his own 
 experience. 

Deceptive, or, as Poulton terms it, " aggressive " col- 
 oration is perhaps best illustrated by common Flycatchers 
 {Tymnnidte). Although these birds live in and about 
 trees, they are, as a rule, quietly attired in olive-green or 
 olive-gray, and are quite unlike the brilliantly Q\?idi^ friiit- 
 eating Tanagers, Orioles, Parrots, and other birds that 
 may be found near them. Insects are therefore more 
 likely to come within snapping distance than if these 
 birds were conspicuously colored. In the same manner 
 we may explain the colors of Hawks, which are never 
 brightly plumaged. 

It is well kno^vn that many arctic animals become 
 white on the approach of winter. With Ptarmigans 
 this is doubtless an instance of protective coloration, but 
 the Snowy Owl, who feeds on the Ptarmigan, may be 
 said to illustrate deceptive coloration. 

Recognition, signaling, or directive colors have, with 
 more or less reason, been made to include many different 
 types of markings, of which I sliall mention only those 
 that are conspicuously shown in flight or by some move- 
 ment. Such are the white outer tail-feathers of Juncos, 
 Meadowlarks, Towhees, and many other birds, and cer- 
 tain wing and rump patches, which are noticeable only 
 when the bird is on the wing. Markings of this kind are 
 supposed to aid birds in recognizing others of their kind, 
 their special use being to keep the individuals of a family 
 or flock together, so that when one starts the others can 
 readily follow. The theory is open to objections, but 
 these so-called recognition marks are so often found among 
 birds that they doubtless are of some use, though their
