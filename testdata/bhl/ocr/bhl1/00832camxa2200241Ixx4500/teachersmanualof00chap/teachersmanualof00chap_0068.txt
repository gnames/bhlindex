THE MIGRATION OF BIRDS.* 

To the field student the season of migration is the 
 most interesting of the year. The bird-life of a vast 
 area then passes in review before him. Though living 
 in a temperate region, he may see birds whose smnmer 
 home is within the Arctic Circle, whose winter haunts are 
 in the tropics. Who can tell what bird he may find in 
 the woods he has been exploring for years ? 

The comparative regularity with which birds come 
 and go gives an added charm to the study of migration. 
 Their journe^^ is not a "helter-skelter" rushing onward, 
 but is like the well-governed march of an army. "We 
 feel a sense of satisfaction in knowing when we may ex- 
 pect to greet a given species, and a secret elation if we 
 succeed in detecting it several days in advance of other 
 observers. We study weather charts, and try to foretell 
 or explain those great flights or " waves " of birds which 
 are so closely dependent upon meteorologic conditions.
