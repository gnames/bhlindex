50 TIMES OF MIGRATION. 

sliouldered and Red-tailed Hawks, Barred and Screech 
 Owls, Do\vnj and Ilairj Woodpeckers, Blue Jay, Crow, 
 Goldfinch, Song Sparrow, White-breasted Nuthatch, and 
 Chickadee. 

Generally speaking, the birds in the front rank of 
 the feathered army which soon wdll invade the land are 
 those whose winter quarters are farthest north, while 
 those that Avinter farthest south bring up the rear. 

From February 20 to March 10, therefore, we may 
 expect to see Purple Grackles, Robins, Bluebirds, and 
 Red-winged Blackbirds ; birds that have wintered but a 
 short distance south of us — if not with us — and who 
 have accepted the slightest encouragement from the 
 weather as an order to advance. All the first comers 
 will doubtless be males, this sex, as a rule, preceding the 
 females by several days. 

About the middle of March we may look for the 
 Woodcock, Meadowlark, Fox Sparrow, Cowbird, and 
 Phoebe ; their time of arrival being largely dependent 
 upon the temperature — warm weather hastening, and 
 cold weather retarding their movements. 

Toward the last of March, Wilson's Snipe, the King- 
 fisher, Mourning Dov^e, Swamp and Field Sparrows are 
 due. 

Early in April the Purple Finch, White-throated, 
 Yesper, and Chipping Sparrows will announce their re- 
 turn in familiar notes, and at the same time Tree Swal- 
 lows, Myrtle Warblers, Pipits, and Hermit Thrushes will 
 appear. They will soon be followed by Barn Swallows 
 and Ruby-crowned Kinglets. 

The migration is now well under way, and we go 
 to the field with the assurance of meeting some lately 
 arrived feathered friend almost daily. Between April 
 20 and 30 we will doubtless note among the newcomers, 
 tlie Green Heron, Spotted Sandpiper, Whip-poor-will,
