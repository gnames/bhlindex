Cliimnoy Swift, Least Flycatclier, Towlicc, Purple Mar- 
 tin, (Miir and Bank Swallows, J>laek and White and 
 Black-throated Green Warblers, Oven-bird, House Wren, 
 Brown Thrasher, Catbird, and Wood Thrush. This 
 troop surely is not without musicians. In ringing 
 tones they herald the victory of Spring over Winter. 

The season of cold waves has passed, and the birds 
 now appear with the regularity of calendar events. 
 From May 1 to 12 the migration reaches its height. 
 It is a time of intense interest to the bird student, and

 Some mornings we may find ten or more different spe-

 During this exciting period we should see the Cuckoos, 
 jS^ighthawk, Ruby -throated Hummingbird, Crested Fly- 
 catcher, Kingbird, Wood Pew^ee, Baltimore and Orchard 
 Orioles, Bobolink, Indigo Bunting, Pose-breasted Gros-

 Wren, Wilson's Thrush, Pedstart, Yellow-breasted Chat, 
 Maryland Yellow-throat, Yellow Warbler, and others of 
 its family.

 familiar and common birds have arrived. During the 
 rest of the month, as the transient visitants, or species 
 wliicli nest farther north, pass onward, birds gradually
