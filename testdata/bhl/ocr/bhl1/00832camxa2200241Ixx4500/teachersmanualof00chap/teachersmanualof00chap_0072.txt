attention to a study of nesting hahits. As a matter of 
 fact, tlie nesting season begins quite as early as the 
 spring migration, the Great Horned Owl laying its eggs 
 late in February. In March and April other birds of 
 prey and the earlier migrants nest. May migrants go 
 to housekeeping soon after they reach their old homes, 
 and by June 5 there are few species that have not 
 nests. 

With birds that rear two or three broods, the nest-

 ing season of most one-brooded birds is over ; they are 
 not yet ready to migrate, and pass the time roving about 
 the country with their families. 

In August birds are molting and moping. The 
 careful observer Avill find that a few Warblers and Fly- 
 catchers have returned from the north and are passing 
 southward, but, as a rule, August is a month to test 
 the patience of the most enthusiastic bird student. Late 
 in the month migrants become more numerous, but be- 
 tween the " flights " or " waves " there are days when
