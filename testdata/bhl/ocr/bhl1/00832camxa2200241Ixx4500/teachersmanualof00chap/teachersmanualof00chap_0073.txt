TIMES OF MIGRATION. 53 

one may tramp the woods for miles without seeing a 
 dozen hirds. 

September is the montli of Warblers, They come in 
 myriads diirini; the hitter half of the nK^nth, and on 
 favorable nights we may sometimes liear their tine- voiced 
 tsei'jhH as they Hy by overhead. About the 25th of the 
 month our winter residents, the Junco, AVinter AVren, 
 Golden Kinglet, and l^rown Creeper, will arrive. 

The sunnner residents are now rapidly leaving us. 
 In a general way it may be said that the last birds to 
 arrive in the spring are the Urst to leave in the fall, 
 while the earliest spring migrants remain the longest. 

October and Xovember are the months of Sparrows. 
 They rise in loose Hocks from every stubble or weed 
 field, and seek shelter in the bordering bushy growth. 
 Should the season prove warm, many of these hardy 
 seed -eaters will stay with us well into December, but at 
 the first really cold weather they retreat southward. 

This completes the merest outline of the move- 
 ments of our migratory birds. It will be seen that in 
 reality there are but few periods during the year when 
 some event is not occurring in the bird world. As we 
 accumulate records for comparison, and learn to appre- 
 ciate their meaning, our interest in the study of migra- 
 tion will increase and be renewed with the changing 
 seasons. 

We have found, in this brief review, that our birds 
 may be placed in four classes, as follows : 

1. Permanent Residents. — Birds that are represented 
 in the same locality throughout the year. 

2. Summer Residents. — Birds that come to us in the 
 spring, rear their young, and de]>art in the fall. 

8. Winter Residents. — Birds that come from the north 
 in the fall, pass the winter with us, and return to their 
 more northern homes in the spring.
