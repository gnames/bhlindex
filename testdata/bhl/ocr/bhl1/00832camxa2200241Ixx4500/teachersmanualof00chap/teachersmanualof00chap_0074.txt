5i MANNER OF MIGRATION. 

4. Transient Visitants. — Birds whose summer home 
 is north and whose winter home is south of us. In 
 travehng from one to the other they pass through the 
 intervening region as " transients." 

Manner of Migration. — The Oriole, who builds his 
 swinging nest in your elm tree, will winter in Central 
 America ; the Bobolink, who seems so care-free in your 
 meadows, must journey to his winter quarters in southern 
 Brazil. But, unless accident befalls, both birds will re- 
 turn to you the following spring. We are so accustomed 
 to these phenomena that we accept them as part of the 
 changing seasons without realizing how wonderful they 
 are. But look for a moment at a map, and try to form 
 a mental picture of the Bobolink's route. Over valleys, 
 mountains, marshes, plains, and forests, over straits and 
 seas hundreds of miles in width, he pursues a course 
 through trackless space with a regularity and certainty 
 which brings him to the same place at nearly the same 
 time year after year. How much of his knowledge of 
 the route he has inherited, and how much learned dur- 
 ing his own lifetime, is a question we may return to 
 later ; now we are concerned with actual methods of 
 migration. 

Immediately after, or even during the nesting season, 
 many birds begin to resort nightly to roosts frequented 
 sometimes by immense numbers of their kinds, with 
 often the addition of other species. These movements 
 are apparently inaugurated by the old birds, and are in 
 a sense the beginnings of the real migratory journey. 
 Other birds roam the woods in loose bands or famihes, 
 their wanderings being largely controlled by the supply 
 of food. 

During this time they may be molting, but when 
 their new plumage is acquired they are ready for the 
 start. The old birds lead the way, either alone or asso-
