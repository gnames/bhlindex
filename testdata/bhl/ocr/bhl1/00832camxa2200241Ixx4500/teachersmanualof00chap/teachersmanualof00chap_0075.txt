MANNER OF MIGRATION. 55 

ciiited with tlie youns^. Some fly by day, Bonie by night, 
 and others hy l)<)tli day and night. This fact was tirst 
 establislied by ]Mr. WilUam Brewster, who, in his admi- 
 rable memoir on l>ird ]\Iigration, writes: "Timid, seden- 
 tary, or feeble- winged l)irds migrate by night, becanse 
 they are either afraid to venture on long, exposed jour- 
 neys by daylight, or unable to continue these journeys 
 day after day without losing much time in stopping to 
 search for food. By taking the nights for traveling 
 they can devote the days entirely to feeding and resting 
 in their favorite haunts. Good examples are Thnishes 
 (except the Kobin), Wrens, Warblers, and Yireos. 

" Bold, restless, strong-winged birds migrate chiefly, 
 or very freely, by day, because, being accustomed to seek 
 their food in open situations, they are indifferent to con- 
 cealment, and being further able to accomplish long dis- 
 tances rapidly and with slight fatigue, they can ordi- 
 narily spare sufficient time by the way for brief stops 
 in places where food is abundant and easily obtained. 
 Under certain conditions, however, as when crossing 
 large bodies of water or regions scantily supplied with 
 food, they are sometimes obliged to travel partly, or per- 
 haps even exclusively, by night. Excellent examples are 
 the Eobin (Jlerula), Horned Lark (Otoco/ns), and most 
 Icteridce [Bobolink, Blackbirds, and Orioles]. 

" Birds of easy, tireless wing, which habitually feed in 
 the air or over very extensive areas, migrate exclusively 
 by day, because, being able either to obtain their usual 
 supply of food as they fly, or to accomplish the longest 
 journeys so rapidly that they do not require to feed on 
 the way, they are under no necessity of changing their 
 usual habits. The best examples are Swallows, Swifts, 
 and llawks."

 lines, and particularly river valleys, all of whicli become
