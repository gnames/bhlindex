VOICE OF BIRDS. 63 

is a most welcome promise of spring. Then follow the 
 Kobins, ])l;ickl)irds, and other migrants, until, late in 
 May, the great springtime chorus is at its height. 

The Bubolink is the first bird to desert the choir. 
 "We do not often hear liim after July 5. Soon he is fol- 
 lowed by the Veery, and each day now shows some fresh 
 vacancy in the ranks of the feathered singers, until by 
 August 5 we have left only the Wood Pewec, Indigo 
 Bunting, and Red-eyed Yireo — tireless songsters who 
 fear neither midsnnnner nor midday heat. 

Call-Xutes. — The call-notes of birds are even more 
 worthy of our attention than are their songs. Song is 
 the outburst of a special emotion ; call -notes form the 
 language of every day. Many of us are familiar with 
 birds' songs, but who knows their every call-note and 
 who can tell us what each call means ? For they have a 
 meaning that close observation often makes intelligible. 

Listen to the calls of the Robin and learn how unmis- 
 takably he expresses suspicion, alarm, or extreme fear ; 
 how he signals cheerfully to his companions or gives the 
 word to take wing. Study the calls of the Crow or Blue 
 Jay, and you will find that they have an apj^arently ex- 
 haustless vocabulary. 

It is supposed that birds, like men, do not inherit 
 their language, but acquire it. Thus there are recorded 
 instances of young birds who had been isolated from 
 others of their kind, learning to sing whatever song they 
 heard. On the other hand, it is said that a bird inherits 
 its own notes, at least to some extent, and, while it may 
 not sing the song of its species perfectly, its song will 
 still be sufficiently characteristic to be recognizable. 
 There are, however, very few satisfactory observations 
 on this sul)ject, and keepers of cage-birds have here an 
 excellent opportunity for original investigation.
