MATING. 65 

ponnfincnt residents of the tropies, where seasonal changes 
 are less marked, could nest at any time. Kevertlieless, 
 tlie breeding season in the tropics is as well defined as it 
 is in more northern regions, and occurs with the return 
 of sunnner, or the season of rains. It is therefore at a 
 time of the year when food is most abundant. 

There is an obvious necessity for this regularity. Old 
 birds can wander over large areas in search of food, but 
 the young of many species must be fed in the nest, and 
 their food supply should be both exhaustless and con- 
 venient of access. 

Among our birds, the Hawks and Owls, Avhose young 
 are fed on animal food, are the first birds to nest, while 
 those which feed their young on fruit or insects wait 
 until later in the year. 

Mating. — Birds are ardent lovers. In their effort to 
 win a bride the males display their charms of song and 
 plumage to the utmost, and will even enter the lists to 
 do battle for the possession of a mate. 

It is not possible to describe here the many pecul- 
 iar customs of birds during the season of courtship. 
 It may simply be said that every bird will then re- 
 pay the closest observation. For the scientific-minded 
 there is opportunity to secure evidence bearing upon 
 the theory of Natural Selection ; for every one there is 
 endless entertainment in the human traits which birds 
 exhibit. 

TKe Nest. — The first step in nest-building is the selec- 
 tion of a site. There is almost no suitable location, from 
 a hole in the ground to branches in the tree-tops, in which 
 l)irds may not place their nests. Protection seems to be 
 the chief desideratum^ and this is generally secured 
 through concealment. Most birds hide their nests. 
 Many sea birds, however, lay their eggs on the shores 
 or cliffs, with no attempt at concealment ; but, as a rule.
