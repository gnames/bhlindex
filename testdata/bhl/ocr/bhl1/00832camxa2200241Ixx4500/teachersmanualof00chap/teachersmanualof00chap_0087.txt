BIRDS' NESTS. 67 

treeless regions, and by birds who substitnte strings, 
 cotton, or rags for their nsnal nesting materials. 

Thinly condition of the young at birth, Avhether 
 feathered or naked. The young of what are termed 
 *" pro3cocial " birds are hatched with a covering of 
 downy feathers. Gulls, Ducks, Snipe, Chickens, Par- 
 tridges, and Quails are familiar meml)ers of this group. 
 Their young can run about soon after birth, and a well- 
 formed nest is not needed. But the young of " altricial " 
 birds are hatched practically naked and are reared in the 
 nest, which is therefore not only a receptacle for the eggs 
 during incubation, but a home. Thrushes, Sparrows, in 
 fact all Perching Birds, Woodpeckers, Hummingbirds, 
 and many others belong in this group of altricial birds. 

Fourth^ temperament, whether solitary or social. 
 Hawks, fierce and gloomy, nest alone, while the cheery, 
 happy Swallows nest in colonies. 

Fifth, structure of the bird. The tools — that is, the 
 bills and feet — of some birds are more serviceable than 
 those of others. We should not expect a Dove to build 
 the woven nest of an Oriole, nor a Hummingbird to 
 fashion a Woodpecker's dwelling. 

Sixth, feeding habit. In some few cases feeding 
 habit may determine the character of the nest. For 
 instance. Woodpeckers, in securing their food from trees, 
 often make large excavations, which it is quite natural 
 they should have learned to use as nests. 

Seventh, inherited habit, or instinct. There seems no 
 reason to doul)t that l)irds inherit their knowledge of nest- 
 building, for in several cases where birds have been taken 
 from the nest and reared alone, they have afterward 
 constructed a nest resembling that of their species. It 
 would therefore appear that inherited habit is a fact. 
 Through it we may explain not only the similarity in the 
 nests of the sune species, but also certain habits for
