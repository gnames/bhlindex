68 BIRDS' EGGS. 

wliicli we can give no satisfactory reason. Thus the 
 Crested Flycatcher's strange custom of using a cast 
 snake-skin in its nesting materials probably originated 
 with the birds in the tropics, where it is still followed 
 by nearly related species of Crested Flycatchers. With 
 them there may be a reason for this habit, but with our 
 bird, living as it does under entirely different conditions, 
 it is doubtless only an inheritance, surviving even when 
 the necessity for it has ceased to exist. 

Eighth^ change of habit. Some birds are influenced 
 by changes in their surroundings, and alter their nesting 
 habits when it proves to their advantage to do so. 
 Chimney Swifts, who have exchanged hollow trees, in 
 which they were exposed to their natural enemies, for 
 the comparative safety of chimneys, are good examples. 
 But a far better one is given by that prodigy in feathers, 
 the House Sparrow. Is there any available site in which 
 this thoroughly up-to-date bird will not place its nest? 
 It has taken possession of even the hollow spaces about 
 certain kinds of electric lamps, and has been observed 
 repairing its nest at night by their light ! 

The Eggs. â€” Usually, httle time is lost between the 
 completion of the nest and the laying of the eggs. The 
 number of eggs composing what oologists term a full 
 set or clutch ranges from one to as many as twenty. At 
 the time of laying, the ovary contains a large number of 
 partly formed eggs, of which, normally, only the required 
 number will become fully developed. But if the nest be 
 robbed, the stolen egg will frequently be replaced. The 
 long-continued laying of our domestic fowls is an instance 
 of this unnatural stimulation of the ovary. Doubtless the 
 most remarkable recorded case of egg-laying by a wild 
 bird is that of a High -hole or Fhcker, who, on being regu- 
 larly robbed, laid seventy-one eggs in seventy-three days ! 

The eggshell is composed largely of carbonate of lime,
