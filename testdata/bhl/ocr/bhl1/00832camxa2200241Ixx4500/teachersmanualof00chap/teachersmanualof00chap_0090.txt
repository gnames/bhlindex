70 YOUXG BIRDS. 

Among some species both sexes share equally the task 
 of incubation. In others, the female is longer on the 
 nest, the male taking her place during a short period each 
 day while she is feeding. Less frequently the female is 
 not at all assisted by her mate, and in some cases — Os- 
 triches, Emus, Phalaropes, and a few others — the male 
 alone incubates. 

The Young. — The care of the young and their men- 
 tal and physical development afford us unequaled oppor- 
 tunities for the study of bird character. We may now 
 become acquainted not only ^vith the species but with 
 individual birds, and at a time when the greatest demands 
 are made upon their intelligence. 

We may see the seed-eaters gathering insects and per- 
 haps beating them into a pulp before gi^^g them to their 
 nestlings : or we may learn how the Doves, High-holes, 
 and Hummingbirds pump softened food from their crops 
 down the throats of their offspring. 

The activity of the parents at this season is amazing. 
 Think of the day's work before a pair of Chickadees with 
 a family of six or eight fledglings clamoring for food 
 from dayhght to dark ! 

But the young birds themselves furnish far more in- 
 teresting and valuable subjects for study. IS'one of the 
 higher animals can be reared so easily without the aid of 
 a parent. We therefore can not only study their growth 
 of body and mind when in the nest and attended by 
 their parents, but we can isolate the young of prsecocial 
 birds, such as Chickens, from other birds and study their 
 mental development where they have no opportunity to 
 learn by imitation. In this way students of instinct and 
 heredity have obtained most valuable results.*
