HOW TO IDENTIFY BIRDS. 

The preceding outline of the events which may enter 
 into ta bird's life-history has, I trust, given some idea of 
 the possibilities attending the study of birds in the field. 
 We come now to the practical question of identification. 
 How are we to find birds, and, ha^-ing found them, how 
 are we to learn their names ? 

From April to August there is probably not a min- 
 ute of the day when in a favorable locality one can not 
 see or hear birds ; and there is not a day in the year 
 when at least some birds can not be found. In the be- 
 ginning, therefore, the question of finding them is simply 
 a matter of looking and listening. Later will come the 
 delightful hunts for certain rarer species whose acquaint- 
 ance we may make only through a knowledge of their 
 haunts and habits. 

Having found your bird, there is one thing absolutely 
 necessary to its identification : you mud see it definitely. 
 Do not descnbe a bird to an ornithologist as " brown, 
 with white spots on its ^yings,'' and then expect him to 
 tell you what it is. Would you think of trying to iden- 
 tify fiowers of which you caught only a glimpse from a 
 car window in passing ? You did not see them definitely, 
 and at best you can only carry their image in your mind 
 until you have opportunity to see them in detail. 

So it is with birds. Do not be discouraged if the 
 books faU to show you the brown bird with white spots
