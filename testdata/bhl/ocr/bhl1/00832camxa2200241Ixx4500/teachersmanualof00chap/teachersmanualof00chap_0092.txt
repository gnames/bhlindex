72 HOW TO IDENTIFY BIRDS. 

on its wings. Probably it exists only through your hasty 
 observation. 

Arm yourself with a field- or opera-glass, therefore, 
 without which you will be badly handicapped, and look 
 your bird over with enough care to get a general idea of 
 its size, form — particularly the form of the bill — color, 
 and markings. Then — and I can not emphasize this too 
 strongly — put what you have seen into your note-book 
 at once. For, as I have elsewhere said, "not only do 
 our memories sometimes deceive us, but we really 
 see nothing with exactness until we attempt to de- 
 scribe it." 

It is true that all the birds will not pose before your 
 glasses long enough for you to examine them at your 
 leisure, but many of them will, and in following the 
 others you will have all the excitement of the chase. 
 Who knows what rare species the stranger may prove 
 to be! 

From your description, and what added notes on voice 
 and actions you may obtain, the field key and illustra- 
 tions on the succeeding pages should make identification 
 a simple matter.* You should also take into considera- 
 tion the season of the year when a bird is present, and 
 not call a summer bird by a winter bird's name. The 
 dates of migration given in the following pages will be of 
 assistance here. They refer to the vicinity of I^ew York 
 city, where, in the spring, birds arrive about a week later 

* The publishers' liberality has resulted in securing bird portraits 
 of unusual excellence. Mr. Seton Thompson is an ornithologist as 
 well as an artist ; his subjects are personal friends. He has spared no 
 effort to make these pictures characteristic life sketches, and I ven- 
 ture to claim that, as a whole, they excel in truth and beauty any 
 bird-drawings ever published in this country.
