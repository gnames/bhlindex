 are reversed. 

A Bu'iFs Bhtgrapliy. — As a further piide to jour 
 observation a list of the principal details which enter into 
 a bird's life -history is appended : 

1. Description (of size, form, color, and markings). 

2. Haunts (upland, lowland, lakes, rivers, woods, fields, etc.). 

3. Movements (slow or active, hops, walks, creeps, swims, tail 

wagged, etc.). 
 4 Appearance (alert, pensive, crest erect, tail drooped, etc.). 

5. Disposition (social, solitary, wary, unsuspicious, etc.). 

6. Flight (slow, rapid, direct, undulating, soaring, sailing, 

flapping, etc.). 

7. SoNQ (pleasing, unattractive, continuous, short, loud, 

low, sung from the ground, from a perch, in

From observations of this kind, consisting of a simple 
 statement of facts, you may philosophize •according to 
 your nature on the relation between habit and structure, 
 colors and haunts, and intelligent adaptation to new con- 
 ditions. Beware, however, lest you be led to draw faulty 
 conclusions from insufficient observation. Do not make 
 the individual stand for its species, or the species for its 
 family, and remember that one is warranted in theorizing 
 onlv when the facts in the case are facts indeed.
