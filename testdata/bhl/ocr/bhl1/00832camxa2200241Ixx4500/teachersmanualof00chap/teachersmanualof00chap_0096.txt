76 FIELD KEY TO COMMON BIRDS. 

It should be borne in mind that Uving birds do not 
 look as long as they really are. The measurement of 
 "length" is taken with the bird's neck and tail out- 
 stretched in a straight line. In life the tail may be raised 
 or drooped, while the neck is drawn in or curved, making 
 the bird look shorter than measurement shows it to be. 
 Remember that the Robin measures ten inches, the House 
 Sparrow six and one-fourth inches, and the Ruby-throated 
 Ilumming-bird three and three-fourtlis inches in length, 
 and you will have a basis for comparison.
