The study of water birds requires special advantages 
 and equipments, among which are a suitable location, 
 much time, and a gun. Our coasts and shores are be- 
 coming so popular as " resorts " that many of the former 
 haunts of waterfowl are now thickly populated, and the 
 birds are comparatively rare. Furthermore, the larger 
 number of our water birds nest in the far North and 
 winter in the South, visiting the Middle States only while 
 on their migrations. It is evident, therefore, that if we 
 would become familiar with these birds, we must devote 
 ourselves especially to their pursuit. 

There are, however, some species, notably those which 
 frequent bodies of fresh water and nest in this latitude, 
 Pied-biUed Grebe, ^^l^i^h deserve to be ranked among our 
 Podiiymbus jxjdkeps. commouer Mrds. Of these, one of the 
 Plate II. i^gg^ known, by name at least, is the 

Pied-billed Grebe, whose aquatic powers have given it 
 the expressive title of Hell-diver. 

Under favorable conditions this little Grebe may breed 
 anywhere from the Argentine Republic to British Amer- 
 ica, but in the Middle States it occurs chiefly as a spring 
 and fall migrant. When nesting, a quiet, reedy pond or 
 lake is chosen for a home, the nest being made on a pile 
 of decaying vegetation. The eggs, four to eight in num- 
 ber, are dull white, more or less stained by the nesting 
 material, which the parent bird rarely fails to place over
