them when leaving the nest. Tlie young are bom covered 
 with down and can swim at birth. The Pied-])illed 
 Grebe is one of our most aquatic birds, AVlien pursued, 
 it prefers diving to tlight, and the marvelous rapidity 
 with which it can disappear from the surface of the 
 water, to reappear in a cpiite unexpected place, justifies 
 its rehance on its o^vti natatorial powers. It can swim 
 under water with only its bill exposed, when it becomes 
 practically invisible. 

When on land Grebes progress awkwardly. They 
 can, it is said, stand erect on their toes, but, when resting, 
 Eupport themselves on the whole length of the foot or 
 tarsus (see Fig. 8, the Great Auk). 

On the ^ving Grebes resemble small Ducks, but their 
 pointed bill and their feet stretched out behind the rudi- 
 mentary tail will serve to distinguish them.

The Loon, like its small relative the Grebe, is known 

to almost every one by name, but only those who have 

Loon visited its summer haunts among the 

Urinator imber. Northern lakcs and heard its wild call 
 Plate III. ^^j^ ]^g gg^^j ^Q know it. Xuttall writes 

of its cry as "the sad and wolfish call of the solitary 
 Loon, which, like a dismal echo, seems slowly to invade 
 the ear, and, rising as it proceeds, dies away in the air." 
 It " may be heard sometimes for two or three miles, when 
 the bird itself is inWsible, or reduced almost to a speck 
 in the distance." The Loon is as aquatic in habits as the 
 Grebe, but is much stronger on the vancr. It migrates 
 by day, and probably also by night, and we may some- 
 times see it passing over — a large, ducklike bird — in 
 March and October.
