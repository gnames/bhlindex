 son it nests near the water's edge, often where it can

 nest is a slight depression in the earth, in which are laid 
 two elliptical eggs, in color olive-brown, shghtly spotted 
 with blackish.

 About one hundred species are known, 
 fifty being Gulls and fifty Terns. The former are, as a 
 rule, larger, stouter birds than the latter, and, generally

 species found in the Eastern States is the Herring Gull.

 along our coast from October 1 to April. This is the 
 Gull we see in such numbers in our bays and harbors, 
 fiying gracefully and apparently aimlessly about, but in 
 reality ever keeping its bright black eyes fixed on the 
 water in search of some floating morsel, which it deftly 
 picks from the surface. It frequently follows vessels, 
 hanging over the stern day after day, and deserting its 
 post only to feed on scraps thrown overboard from the 
 galley. There are said to be reliable records of these 
 birds following the same vessel from the Irish coast to
