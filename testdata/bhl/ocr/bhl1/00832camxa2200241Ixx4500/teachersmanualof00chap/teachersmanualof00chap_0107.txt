COMMON TERN. ST 

as tlicv are as 6cavcn<i^ers, I feel that their place in Xature 
 is to uiiiinate the barren wastes of the sea. I low, when 
 at sea, the presence of a single Gull changes the whole 
 aspect of Nature ! The great expanse of water, which 
 before was oppressive in its dreary lifelessness, is trans- 
 formed by the white- winged Gulls into a scene of rare 
 beauty. Every voyager, be he naturalist or not, admires 
 their grace of form and motion. They seem born of the 
 waves, and as nnich a part of the ocean as the foamy 
 whitecaps themselves. 

The beautiful Terns or Sea Swallows are even more 
 graceful than the Gulls. They are slenderer birds, lighter 
 Common Tern, ^^^^^ ^^^^'^ active on the wing, with long, 
 aterna hh-undo. forkcd tails and pointed bills. They 
 Plate X. arrive from the South m May and re- 

main until September, nesting in colonies. 

Terns are littoral rather than pelagic, seldom being 
 found far from the shore. Like the Gulls, they seem so 
 in harmon with their surroundings that no coast view is 
 perfect from which the Terns are missing. They add 
 the recpiisite touch of life, and make still more impressive 
 the thunder of the surf dashing over rocks or curling in 
 long, combing waves on the beach. 

During recent years these birds have been killed in 
 such numbers for millinery purposes that on the middle 
 Atlantic coast the only survivors exist on three or four 
 uninhabited islets. If one protests against the merciless 
 destruction of these exquisite creatures the excuse is, 
 " Well, wdiat good are they ? " â€” an answer betraying such 
 an utter lack of appreciation of beauty that explanation 
 seems hopeless. But can we not learn, before it is too 
 late, that these l)ir(ls are even more deserving of protec- 
 tion than the works of art we guard so zealously i
