88 PETRELS. 

TUBE-NOSED SWIMMERS. (ORDEB TUBINARES.) 

Petrels. (Family Procellariid^.) 

Petrels, or " Mother Carey's Chickens," are true chil- 
 dren of the sea. Their home is the ocean, and they come 
 to land only when nesting. To the 
 Petre s, landsman, therefore, they are strangers, 

but to most people who have been to 
 sea they are known as the little, white-rumped swallow- 
 like birds who on tireless wing follow in the wake of the 
 ship day after day, patiently waiting for the food which 
 experience tells them mil be thrown overboard. 

Two species of Petrels are found off our coasts, Wil- 
 son's and Leach's. The former has a yellow area in the 
 webs of the toes and a square tail, while Leach's Petrel has 
 the webs of the toes wholly black and a slightly forked 
 tail. These differences, however, would not be appre- 
 ciable at a distance. Wilson's Petrel nests in certain 
 islands of the southern hemisphere in February, and 
 later migrates northward, reaching our latitude in May 
 and spending the summer, or what in fact is its winter, 
 in the Xortli Atlantic. It is, therefore, probably the 
 Petrel most frequently seen by transatlantic voyagers at 
 this season. 

Leach's Petrel nests on our coasts from Maine north- 
 ward, arriving from the South in May. The nest is 
 made in a burrow in the ground or beneath a rock, and 
 a single white egg is laid. Generally one of the birds 
 spends the day on the nest while its mate is at sea, but 
 at night the incubating bird leaves the nest, its place being 
 taken probably by the one who has been feeding during 
 the day.
