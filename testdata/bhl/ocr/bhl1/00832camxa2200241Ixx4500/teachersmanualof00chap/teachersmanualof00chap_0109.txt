LAMELLIROSTRAL SWIMMERS. (ORDER ANSERES.) 
 Ducks, Geese, and Swans. (Family Anatid^e.) 

This family contains some two hundred species, and 
 is represented in all parts of the world. It includes five 
 subfamilies : the ^lergansers {Jlergince), or Fish-eating 
 Ducks ; the Pond or Eiver Ducks {Anatince), the Bay or 
 Sea Ducks {FidiguUiue) ; the Geese {Anseriim) ; and 
 the Swans {CijgnuiLv). 

Ducks, like all hunted birds, are exceedingly wild, 
 and comparatively few species will come within reach of 
 the student's opera-glass. The group may therefore be 
 reviewed briefly. The Mergansers or Shelldrakes, num- 
 bering three species, have narrow, serrate bills which 
 enable them to hold the fish they pursue and catch 
 under water (see Fig. IS). 

The Eiver Ducks have little or no lobe or flap on the 

hind toe. In this group belong our Mallard, AVidgeon, 

Pintail, Blue-winged and Green-winged 

^'nat^v^'' Teals, Black Duck, Wood Duck, and 
 others. All but the last two nest in 
 the North and are found in our latitude only during 
 their spring and fall migrations, or, if the weather be 
 mild, in the winter. The Black Duck and Wood Duck 
 nest rarely in the Middle States. 

All these birds feed in shallow water by " dabbling " 
 or " tipping," terms which will be readily understood by 
 any one who has watched domesticated Ducks feeding. 

The Bay and Sea Ducks, on the contrary, are divers, 
 and may descend to the bottom in water more than one 
 hundred and fifty feet in depth. They are to be dis- 
 tinguished from the River Ducks by the presence of a 
 flap or lobe on the hind toe. The commoner members of
