90 DUCKS AND GEESE. 

this subfamily are the Kedliead, Canvasback, Scaup or 
 Broadbill, Whistler, Bufflehead, Old Squaw, Eider, three 
 species of Scoters or " Coots " and Buddy Duck. These 
 are all northern-breeding birds who visit the waters of 
 our bays and coasts during their migrations or in the 
 winter. 

The bill in both River and Bay Ducks has a series of 
 gutters on either side which serve as strainers. The 
 birds secure a large part of their food — of small mollusks, 
 crustaceans, and seeds of aquatic plants — from the bot- 
 tom, taking in with it a quantity of mud, which they 
 get rid of by closing the bill and forcing it out through 
 the strainers, the food being retained. 

Geese are more terrestrial than Ducks, and, though 
 they feed under water by tipping, often visit the land to 
 procure grass, corn, or cereals, which they readily nip off. 
 The white-faced, black-necked Canada Goose is our only 
 common species. Its long overland journeys, while 
 migrating, render it familiar to many who have seen it 
 only in the air. It migrates northward in March and 
 April and returns in October and lN"ovember, breeding 
 from the Northern States northward and wintering from 
 ^ew Jersey southward. 

The two Swans, Whistling and Trumpeter, found in 
 North America, are generally rare on the Atlantic 
 coast.
