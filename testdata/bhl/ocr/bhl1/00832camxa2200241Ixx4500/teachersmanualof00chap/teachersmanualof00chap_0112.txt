size, preference for wooded regions instead of marshes, 

and habit of nesting alone, not in flocks, like most Her- 

Little Green Heron, ^^^s, accounts for its being relatively 

ArJca vircscais. commou. It arrives from the South 
 Plate VI. about Aj^ril 20, and nests early in 

May. The nest, as is usual in this family, is a rude 
 platform of sticks and is placed in a bush or the lower 
 branch of a tree, often overhanging the water. The eggs 
 number from three to six, and in color are pale green- 
 ish blue. The young, although born w^ith a covering of 
 hairlike feathers, are quite helpless and are reared in 
 the nest. Adults have the crown and back dark, glossy 
 green, the neck reddish brown. 

The notes of this little Heron are a clear whistle and 
 a harsh squaivJc, uttered when it is frightened. It then 
 seeks refuge by alighting in a distant bush or tree, and 
 with upstretched neck and t\\dtching tail watches the 
 intruder. 

The Xight Heron, or Squawk, doubtless owes its 
 escape from the fate of most Herons to its nocturnal 
 habits. These birds arrive from the 
 Nieht Heron ^^^^^^^^ ^ April and remain until Oc- 
 yycticorax nycticovar. tobcr. They nest in large colonies, a 
 rookery not far from New York city 
 being inhabited by at least one thousand 
 pairs. It is in a low, wooded tract, and the nests are built 
 in the trees at an average height of thirty feet. The eggs 
 number four to six, and in color are pale bluish green. 

At night, while feeding, these Herons are doubtless 
 distributed over a mde area. When flying, they often 
 utter a loud sqxmw^ the origin of one of their common 
 names. It is a surprising sound when heard near by at 
 night, and has doubtless aroused the curiosity of many 
 persons who live near a line of flight followed by these 
 birds in going to and from their nests.
