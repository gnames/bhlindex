AMERICAN BITTERN. 93 

The Bittern, or Stake Driver, is a summer resident of 
 our larger marshes, arriving early in April and remaining 
 American Bittern, ""^1^ October. Though hj no means 
 Bvtaurus Unt:<jinosus. commou, its uotos are so loud and re- 
 Plate VII. markable that even a single calUng 
 bird is more likely to attract attention than many smaller 
 abundant species. Under favorable circumstances these 
 notes may be heard for at least three fourths of a mile. 
 They are of two kinds. One is described as the " pump- 
 ing " call, and is generally ^yiUqh 2)^i^^nj)-^r-lunJc, pdinp- 
 er-lunk,pu7np-er-l link, while the other is deceptively like 
 the sound produced by driving a stake in the mud. Mr. 
 Bradford Torrey, one of the few ornithologists who has 
 observed the bird while it was uttering these singular 
 cries, tells us (The Auk, vi, 1889, p. 1) that they are 
 attended by violent, convulsive movements of the head 
 and neck, which suggest the contortions of a seasick 
 person, but that the bird's bill is neither immersed in 
 water nor plunged in the mud, as has been popularly 
 supposed.

Eails are marsh-inhabiting birds, more often heard 
 than seen. They are very reluctant to take wing, and 
 when pursued seek safety by running or hiding rather 
 than by flying. ^Yhen flushed, they go but a short dis- 
 tance, and with dangling legs soon drop back into the 
 grasses. 

Of the one hundred and eighty members of this 
 family, fourteen inhabit North America and eight visit 
 the northeastern United States. Only three or four of 
 these, however, are abundant, the most numerous and
