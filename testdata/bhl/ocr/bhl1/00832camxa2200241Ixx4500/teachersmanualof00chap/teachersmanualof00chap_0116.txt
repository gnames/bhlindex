has probed for earthworms with his long, sensitive bill, 
 the upper mandible of which, as Mr. Gordon Trumbull 
 has discovered, the bird can use as a finger. 

The Woodcock's nest is made of dried leaves, and the 
 four large, pear-shaped eggs are buff, spotted with shades 
 of reddish brown. The young are born covered with 
 rich chestnut and buff down, and can run as soon as

As a songster the Woodcock is unique among our 
 summer birds. Ordinarily sedate and dignified, even 
 pompous in his demeanor, in the spring he falls a victim 
 to the passion which is accountable for so many strange 
 customs in the bird world. 

If some April evening you visit the Woodcock's 
 haunts at sunset, you may hear a loud, nasal note repeated 
 at short intervalsâ€” ^^^/i^, jpeent. It resembles the call of 
 a Nighthawk, but is the Woodcock sounding the first 
 notes of his love song. He is on the ground, and as you 
 Hsten, the call ceases and the bird springs from the ground 
 to mount skyward on whistling wings. He may rise 
 three hundred feet, then, after a second's pause, one hears 
 a t^vittering whistle and the bird shoots down steep 
 inclines earthward. Unless disturbed, he will probably 
 return to near the spot from which he started and at 
 once resume his peenting. This, with the twittering 
 note, is vocal ; the whistling sound, heard as the bird rises, 
 is produced by the rapid passage of air through its stif- 
 fened primaries.
