ing a nail held crosswise in the hand, though it is louder 
 and more full. This performance is generally restricted 
 to late evening and early morning during the spring, but 
 is occasionally practiced in the fall. 

Most of our transient visitant Snipe are true shore 

birds. Many of them are classed as game birds, and have 

Semipalmated ^^^ become SO uncommon that, as 

Sandpiper, before remarked, it requires a special 

Ereunetes pusiiias. knowledge of their ways in order to 

^^® ^ ■ find them. But there are some species 

too small to be worthy the sportsman's attention, and they 

are often numerous on our beaches. They are generally 

known as Peeps or Ox-eyes, but in books are termed 

Semipalmated Sandpipers — active little fellows, with 

black, gray and rusty backs and white under parts, who 

run along the shore, feeding on the small forms of life 

cast up by the waves. They are sociable birds, and even 

when feeding the members of a flock keep together, while 

when flying they move almost as one bird. 

These Sandpipers visit us in May, when journeying to 
 their summer homes within the Arctic Circle, and return 
 in July, to linger on our shores until October. Their 
 call-note is a cheery, peeping twitter, which probably 
 suggested one of their common names. 

Plovers. (Family Charadriid^.) 

Most Plovers differ from Snipe in possessing three 
 instead of four toes, and in having the scales on the tarsi 
 rounded, not square or transverse. Their bill is shorter 
 and stouter than that of Snipe, and they do not probe 
 for food, but pick it up from the surface. 

Although several species visit dry fields and uplands, 
 they are ranked as shore birds or bay birds, and, as with 
 Snipe, the species large enough to be ranked as game
