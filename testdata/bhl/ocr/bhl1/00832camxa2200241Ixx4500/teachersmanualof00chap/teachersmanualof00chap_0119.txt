have become comparatively rare. Of the one hundred 
 known species, six \^8it eastern North America — the 
 Black-brcasted, Golden, Pipinu^, Wilson's, Semipalmated, 
 and Killdeer Plovers. Only the last two of these are 
 common enough to deserve mention here. 

Killdeer '^^^^ Killdeer, with the exception of 

^giaiitis voci/tra. the Piping Plovcr, is the only bird of 

Plate XL ^ij^ig family that nests Ts^ith us. It is 

irregularly distributed in the northeastern States, but its 
 noisy call, kildee^ hildee^ and striking markings render it 
 a conspicuous bird even where it is uncommon. It fre- 
 quents uplands and lowlands, fields and shores, but prefers 
 the vicinity of water. Its nest of grasses is made on the 
 ground, and its four eggs are whitish, spotted and scrawled 
 with chestnut, chiefly at the larger end. 

The Semipalmated or Ping-necked Plover looks like 
 a miniature of the Killdeer, but, in addition to other dif- 

„ . , , , ^, ferences, has only one band on the 

Semipalmated Plover, ' "^ 

^giaiitis breast. The male has the upper parts 

semipalmata. brownish gray, the under parts, nape, 
 and forehead white, while the breast- 
 band, crown, and cheeks are black. In the female these 
 black areas are brownish gray. This Plover visits our 
 shores and beaches during its northward migration in 
 May and southward migration in August and September. 
 Thanks to its small size, it is not hunted as game, and 
 for this reason is almost as common as the little Peeps 
 or Ox-eyes, with which it often associates. Its call is a 
 simple but exceedingly sweet and plaintive two-noted 
 whistle.
