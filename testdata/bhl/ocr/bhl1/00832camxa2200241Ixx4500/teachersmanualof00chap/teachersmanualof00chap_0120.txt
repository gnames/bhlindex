THE LAND BIRDS. 
 GALLINACEOUS BIRDS. (ORDER GALLINiE.) 

Bob-whites, Grouse, etc. (Family Tetraonid^.) 

This is tlie family of the game birds â€” the aristocrats 
 of the bird world. Tliej are protectively colored birds, 
 their rich bro^vn, buff, and black plumage harmoniz-

 strong wings enabhng them to reach their greatest speed 
 within a short distance of the starting point. 

One of the best-known members of this distinguished 

family is our familiar Bob-white, the Quail of the E'orth

PiateLXXVii. tridge, and those who claim that but 
 one of these names is correct may compromise on " Bob- 
 white." 

The Bob-white inhabits the eastern United States, and 
 wherever found is resident throughout the year. The 
 sexes are much alike in color, the only important differ- 
 ence being in the throat and the line over the eye, which 
 are white in the male and buff in the female. 

1^0 bird better illustrates the peculiar potency of 
 bird song, and the hopelessness of attempting to express its 
 charm. If I should describe Bob-white's call to a person 
 who had never heard it, as two ringing notes, do you 
 suppose he would have the faintest conception of what
