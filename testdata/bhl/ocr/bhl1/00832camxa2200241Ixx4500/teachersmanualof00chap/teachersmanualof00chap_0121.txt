RUFFED GROUSE. 101 

tliej mean to those who love them ? The promise of 
 Spring, its fulfilhnent in summer, is clearly told in B(jb- 
 wliite's greeting. Then, in the antinnn, when the mem- 
 bers of a scattered bevy are signaling each other, their 
 sweet where are you f where are yoa ? is equally associated 
 with the season. 

The Bob- white nests about May 20, laying from ten 
 to eighteen white eggs in a nest on the ground. 

The Ruffed Grouse, or Partridge of the North and 
 Pheasant of the South, is properly a ti-ue Grouse, and 
 Ruflfed Grouse ^^^ ^^* ^Â® correctly called either Par- 
 Bonasa umheiius. tridge or Pheasant. He is a more 
 Plate XII. northern bird than tlie Bob-white, be- 

ing found south of Virginia only in the Alleghanies. 
 Requiring large tracts of woodland for his haunts, he 
 is less generally distributed and not so common as his 
 plump relative. 

I always associate the Grouse with the astounding 
 roar of ^vings made by the bird as he springs from the 
 ground at my feet and sails awaj through the forest. I 
 watch him at first with dazed surprise, then with a keen 
 sense of pleasure in the meeting. One need not be a 
 sportsman to appreciate the gamin ess of the Grouse. 

To find a hen Grouse with young is a memorable 
 experience. While the parent is giving us a lesson in 
 mother-love and bird intelligence, her downy chicks are 
 teaching us facts in protective coloration and heredity. 
 How the old one limps and flutters ! She can barely 
 drag herself along tlie ground. But while we are watch- 
 ing her, what has become of the ten or a dozen little 
 yellow balls we almost stepped on ? Not a feather do 
 we see, until, poking about in the leaves, we find one 
 little chap hiding here and another S(|uatting there, all 
 perfectly still, and so like the leaves in color as to be 
 nearly invisible.
