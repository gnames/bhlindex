102 MOURMNG DOVE. 

The drumming of the Grouse, as described by Mr. 
 Thompson, begins " with the measured thump of the big 
 drum, then gradually changes and dies away in the rum- 
 ble of the kettle-drum. It may be brieHy represented 
 thus: Thump — thump — thump — thump, thump; thump, 
 thump — 1'up ?nip rup rup, r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r. The sound is 
 produced by the male bird beating the air with his wings 
 as he stands firmly braced on some favorite low perch." 

The Ruffed Grouse makes its leaf -lined nest usually 
 at the base of a tree or stump, and the eight to fourteen 
 buff eggs are laid early in May.

Pigeons and Doves. (Fa3iily Columbid^.) 

The three hundred species belonging in this order are 
 distributed throughout most parts of the world, but only 
 two of them are found in the northeastern States. One 
 of these, however, the Wild Pigeon, is now so rare that 
 its occurrence is worthy of note. Less than fifty years 
 ago it was exceedingly abundant, but its sociable habits 
 of nesting and flying in enormous flocks made it easy 
 prey for the market hunter, and, with that entire disre- 
 gard of consequences which seems to characterize man's 
 action when his greed is aroused, the birds were pur- 
 sued so relentlessly that they have been practically ex- 
 terminated. 

The Mourning or Carolina Dove has happily been 
 more fortunate. IS'esting in isolated pairs, and not 
 Mourning Dove, gathering in very large flocks, it has
