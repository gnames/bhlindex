104 RED-SHOULDERED HAWK. 

'No other birds are so well protected ; and as a result 
 Turkey Buzzards and Black Yultures walk about the streets 
 of some of our Southern cities with the tameness of domes- 
 tic fowls. If we should similarly encourage our insectivo- 
 rous birds, who can predict the benefits which might accrue ? 

Hawks, Falcons, and Eagles. (Family Falconid^.) 

To this family belong the diurnal birds of prey, 
 which number some three hundred and fifty species, and 
 are distributed throughout the world. They are birds 
 of strong flight, and capture their prey on the wing by 
 striking it with their sharp, curved claws, the most dead- 
 ly weapons to be found in any bird's armament. The 
 bill is short, stout, and hooked, and is used to tear the 
 prey while it is held by the feet. 

The voices of Hawks are in keeping with their dis- 
 positions, and, wliile their lives typify all that is fierce 
 and cruel, no birds are more often wrongly accused and 
 falsely persecuted than our birds of prey. To kill one 
 is regarded as an act of special merit ; to spare one seems 
 to place a premium on crime. Still, these birds are among 
 the best friends of the farmer. There are but two of our 
 common species, Cooper's and the Sharp-shinned, who 
 habitually feed on birds and poultry. Our other com- 
 mon species are, without exception, invaluable aids to the 
 agriculturist in preventing the undue increase of the small 
 rodents so destructive to crops. 

Any one reading Dr. Fisher's reports on this subject 

can not fail to be impressed with the array of facts he 

Eed-shouldered pi'esents in proof of the value of these 

Hawk, birds. For instance, the Ked-shoul- 

Â£uteo linentus. dcrcd Hawk, to wliich the name 

Plate XIV. Chicken or Hen Hawk is often ap- 

phed, has been found to live largely on small mammals.
