across the breast when adult. His call 
 is a thin, long-drawn, wheezy whistle, which reminds one 
 of the sound produced by escaping steam. 

The Marsh Hawk courses to and fro over field and 
 meadow, like a Gull over the water. He never sails, 

Marsh Hawk, however, but on firm wing flies easily

 Plate XV. pj,g^ 1^ ^l^g grasses below. He may 

sometimes mistake birds for mice, but he captures far 
 more of the latter than of the former, and only 7 of the 
 124 Marsh Hawks whose stomachs were examined by 
 Dr. Fisher had eaten chickens. 

The Marsh Hawk is migratory, and in winter is not 
 often found north of southern Connecticut. He nests 
 later than the resident Hawks, and, unlike them, builds 
 his nest of grasses on the ground in the marshes, laying 
 from four to six dull white or bluish white eggs early 
 in May. 

The Sparrow Hawk has a perfectly clean record, 

as far as chickens go, not one of the 320 whose stomachs

Plate xvi. 215 had eaten insects, and 89 had cap- 

tured mice. Grasshoppers are the Sparrow Hawk's chief 
 food, and we may often see him hovering over the fields 
 with rapidly moving wings. Then, dropping lightly down 
 on some unsuspected victim below, he returns to the bare 
 limb or stub he uses for a lookout station, uttering an 
 exultant Mlly — HUy — hilly as he flies. 

The Sparrow is distributed throughout the greater 
 part of North America, but in winter is not found north
