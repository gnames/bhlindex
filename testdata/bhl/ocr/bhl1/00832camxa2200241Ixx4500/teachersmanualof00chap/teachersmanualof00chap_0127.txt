of soutliem New York. It mip^rates northward in Feb- 
 ruary and Marcli, ])ut does not nest until ^[aj. Unlike 
 our other Hawks, it chooses a hollow tree for a home, 
 often taking possession of a Woodpecker's deserted hole. 
 It lays three to seven eggs, which are finely and evenly 
 marked with reddish brown. 

It is the Sharp-shinned and Cooper's Hawks who are 

the real cidprits in Hawkdom. They feed almost exclu- 

Sharp-shinned Hawk, ^i^'^ly on birds, and, having once ac-

 hen yards. They are less often observed than the Hawks 
 previously mentioned, seeking less exposed perches and 
 soaring comparatively httle ; but, when seen, their slen- 
 der bodies and lono^ tails should aid in distino;uishini]j 
 them from the stouter, slower-flying Hawks. As a rule, 
 they are silent. It is difficult to explain the differences 
 between these and other Hawks \vith sufficient clearness 
 to prevent one's killing the wrong kind, but if the farmer 
 will withhold his judgment against Hawks in general, 
 and shoot only those that visit his poultry yard, he will 
 not go far astray. 

Coo])er's Hawk resembles the Sharp-shinned in color, 

but is about four inches longer, and its outer tail-feathers 

are about half an inch shorter than the
