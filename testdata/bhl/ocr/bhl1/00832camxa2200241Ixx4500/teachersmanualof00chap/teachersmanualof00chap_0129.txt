as the Snowy Owl and Hawk Owl, northern birds that 
 visit us rarely in winter. 

Because of their nocturnal habits Owls are even more 
 deserving of protection than the beneficial Hawks, for 
 they feed at a time when mice are abroad, and their 
 food consists largely of these destructive little rodents. 
 They capture their prey, like the Hawks, by striking it 
 with their powerful talons, when, if small enough, it is 
 swallowed entire. The indigestible portions, hair, bones, 
 and feathers, are formed into pellets in the stomach and 
 ejected at the mouth. These may always be found in 
 numbers beneath an Owl's roosting place, and fonii as 
 sure an indication of the Owl's presence as they do of 
 the nature of his food. Thus, as before mentioned, two 
 hundred pellets of the Bam Owl, taken from the home of 
 a pair of these birds in the tower of the Smithsonian In- 
 stitution, were found by Dr. A. K. Fisher to contain the 
 skulls of 454 small mammals.

of the meadow mice which form a large part of its food. 
 Dr. Fisher found, on examination of 101 stomachs of this 
 Owl, that no less than 77 contained the remains of mice, 
 convincing proof of its usefulness. Unlike any of our 
 other Owls, the Short-eared makes its nest on the ground, 
 laying from four to seven eggs. It is somewhat irregular 
 in its distri])ution, but has been found nesting, locally, 
 from Virginia northward. It winters from New Jersey 
 southward, and is sometimes associated in companies at 
 this season. 

The Long-eared Owl is about the size of the Short-
