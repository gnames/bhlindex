Of our four " horned " Owls, the Long-eared has rela- 
 tively the largest and most conspicuous " ear-tufts," the 
 Short-eared the smallest, while in the Great Horned Owl 
 and Screech Owl the ears are of about the same propor- 
 tionate size. The Great Horned Owl, however, is found 
 only in the wilder, more heavily wooded parts of the coun- 
 try, and is hardly to be included in a list of our common 
 birds. It is the largest of our resident Owls, the males 
 measuring twenty-two inches in length, while its "ear- 
 tufts " are nearly two inches long. 

The Screech Owl is doubtless the commonest of our 
 Owls, as it is also the most famihar, nesting about and

 Plate XX. itself until its family of four to six 

fuzzy Owlets is safely launched into the world ; then, in 
 July or August, we may hear its melancholy voice — not 
 a "screech," but a tremulous, wailing whistle. It has 
 several other notes difficult to describe, and when alarmed 
 defiantly snaps its bill. 

Some Screech Owls are gray, others bright reddish 
 brown, and these extremes are connected by specimens 
 intermediate in color. This difference in color is not due 
 to age, sex, or season, and is termed dichromatism, or 
 the presence in the same species of two phases of color. 
 The same phenomenon is shown by other birds, notably 
 certain Herons, and among mammals by the gray squir- 
 rel, some individuals of which are black. The observa-
