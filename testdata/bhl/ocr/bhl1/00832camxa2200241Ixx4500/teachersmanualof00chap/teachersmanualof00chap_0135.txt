Watcli tlie Downy Woodpecker, our commonest 
 species, while he is engaged in this surprising perform- 
 Downy Woodpecker, ^^^^^- How he seems to enjoy it ! His 
 Jjryobatts pubescens whole appearance is martial and deti- 
 vieduxnus. ant. It is his challenge to the Wood- 
 pecker world. After each roll he looks 
 proudly about him and perhaps utters his call-note, a 
 sharp 2)eekj peek, which suggests the sound produced by 
 a marble cutters chisel. More rarely this call is pro- 
 longed into a connected series, when one can readily 
 imagine that the quarrier has dropped his tool. 

The Downy is a hardy bird and is with us throughout 
 the year. In the winter he forms a partnership with the 
 Chickadee and Xuthatch, and if the good this trio does 
 could be expressed in figures, these neglected friends of 
 ours might receive some small part of the credit due 
 them. Wlio can estimate the enormous numbers of in- 
 sects' eggs and larvae which these patient explorers of 
 trunk and twig destroy ? 

The Downy, as well as some other Woodpeckers, be- 
 lieves in the comfort of a home. He will not j^ass cold, 
 wintry nights clinging to the leeward side of a tree when 
 by the use of his chisel-bill he can hollow a snug chamber 
 in its heart. So, in the fall, we may sometimes find him 
 preparing his winter quarters. His nest is constructed 
 in the same manner, and his eggs, like those of all AVood- 
 peckers, are glossy white. 

The Hairy Woodpecker, the Downy's big cousin, is 

not quite so common as his smaller

in color, and differ only in the mark-
