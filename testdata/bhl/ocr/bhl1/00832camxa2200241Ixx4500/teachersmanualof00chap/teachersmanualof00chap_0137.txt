Professor Beal has sho^;vTi that nearly one half of the 
 Flicker's food consists of ants. He further tells us that 
 as ants aid in the increase of the plant lice so injurious 
 to vegetation, the birds which feed on ants are therefore 
 the friends of the agriculturist. 

The Flicker's most prominent marks, as with a low 
 chuckle he bounds up before you, are his white rump

In this family the mouth of birds reaches its greatest 
 development, while the bill proper is correspondingly 
 small, bearing much the same relation to the mouth that 
 a clasp does to a purse. These birds feed at night upon 
 insects which they catch on the vnng, and their enormous 
 gape is obviously of great assistance in this mode of feed- 
 ing. Often the sides of the mouth are beset with long
