tober. During the fall migrations they often gather in 
 flocks of several hundred, and as they sail about you 
 may notice their best lield mark, a white spot in each 
 wing. Kighthawks lay two elliptical, mottled eggs on 
 the bare ground or a flat rock in open fields, and, rarely, 
 on a house top in the city.

 a few distinct brownish gray spots. 

• Whip-poor-wills arrive from the south late in April, 
 and remain with us until October.
