Swifts naturally nest in liollow trees or caves, and it 
 is only in the more densely populated parts of tlieir 
 range that they resort to chimneys and outbuildings. 
 The nest of our Chimney Swift is a bracketlike basket 
 of small twigs. They are gathered by the bird while 
 on the wing, and are fastened together and to the wall

 may expect him to return to us, for he is as regular in

 a half instead of an inch and a half in length. If you 
 would have him visit you, plant honeysuckle and trum-

 humming of this tiny bird's rapidly vibrating mngs. 

The Ruby-throat feeds on insects as well as on the 
 juices of flowers, and when you see him probing a corolla
