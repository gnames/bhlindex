122 KINGBIRD. 

the thirteen thousand known species are included in the 
 single order l\isseres. The North American nienibers 
 of this order are so alike in more important structural 
 details that tliej are placed in but two suborders, tlie 
 suborder Clamatores^ containing the so-called Songless 
 Perching Birds, and the suborder Oscines^ containing the 
 Song Birds. The Flycatchers are the only members of 
 the suborder Clamatores in Eastern ^N^orth America. 
 They differ from the Oscines, or true Song Birds, in 
 always having ten fully developed primaries, in having 
 the tarsus rounded behind as well as in front, and chiefly 
 in the anatomy of the syrinx, or voice-producing organ. 
 In the Oscines this possesses four or five distinct pairs of 
 intrinsic muscles, while in the Clamatores it has less than 
 four pairs of muscles, and is not so highly developed. 

Flycatchers are the Hawks of the insect world. Their 
 position when resting is erect, and they are constantly on 
 the watch for their prey, which is captured on the wing, 
 with a dexterity Hawks may well envy. The bill is 
 broad and flat and the gape large, as in other fly-catching 
 birds. After darting for an insect, as a rule, they return 
 to the same perch, a habit which betrays their family 
 aflinities, though it is occasionally practiced by some 
 other birds. 

Among our Eastern Flycatchers the Kingbird un- 
 doubtedly deserves first rank. In books he is sometimes

in a just cause. His particular enemy is the Crow, and 
 during the nesting season each Kingbird evidently draws 
 an imaginary circle about his home within which no 
 Crow can venture unchallenged. From his lookout on 
 the topmost branch of a neighboring tree the Kingbird 
 darts forth at the trespasser, charging him with a spirit
