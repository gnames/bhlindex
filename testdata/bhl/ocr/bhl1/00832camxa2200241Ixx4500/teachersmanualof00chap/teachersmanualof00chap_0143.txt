and fearlessness which no bird can withstand. It is a case 
 of " riiz;ht makes might," added tu a very dexterous use of 
 wings and bill. The Crow, if he be experienced, turns

 which will not be forgotten. Then he returns to his post 
 and, with crest erect and quivering wings, gives voice to 
 cries of victory.

 ground. The eggs, three to five in numl)er, are white,
