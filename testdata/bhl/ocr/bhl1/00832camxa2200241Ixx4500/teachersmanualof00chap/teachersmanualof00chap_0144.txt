The Greatcrest arrives from the south about May 7, 
 and remains until September. Nesting is begun early in 
 June, a hollow limb being the home usually selected. In 
 collecting its nesting materials, the bird displays a very 
 singular trait, and gives evidence of the stability of habit. 
 With rare exceptions it places a bit of cast snake-skin in 
 its nest. Various reasons have been advanced to account 
 for this singular habit, but none of them is satisfactory. 
 Recently Lieutenant Wirt Robinson has discovered that 
 one of the commonest and most generally distributed spe- 
 cies of this genus in South America places cast snake-skin 
 in its nest, and it is well known that the Arizona Crested 
 Flycatcher follows the same custom. The habit is there- 
 fore widespread, and is common to birds living under 
 greatly varying conditions. Rather than consider it of 
 especial significance in each species, it seems more reason- 
 able to believe that it is an inheritance from a common 
 ancestor, and has no connection with the present sur- 
 roundings of at least those species living so far from the 
 center of distribution of this tropical genus as our Myi- 
 archus crinitus.

Flycatchers, because of the nature of their food, usu-

 they arrive late in the spring and depart early in the
