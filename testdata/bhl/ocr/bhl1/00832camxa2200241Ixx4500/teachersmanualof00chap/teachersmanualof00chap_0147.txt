nORXED LAKK. 127 

tlicse races are found in the eastern T'nited States, tlie 
 Horned Lark and the Prairie Horned Lark. The former 
 visits us in the winter; the latter occurs at all seasons, 
 but during the summer is found only in certain regions. 
 At this season it inhabits the u])per Missi.ssi])pi A^dley, 
 whence it extends eastward through northwestern Penn- 
 sylvania and central Xew York to western Massachu- 
 setts. From October to April it may be found with the 
 Homed Lark as far south as South Carolina. The two 
 birds differ in size and color. The Horned Lark's winir 
 averages 4-27 inches in length, the Prairie Lark's wing 
 averages but 4*08 inches in length ; the former's forehead 
 and eye-line are yellow, the latter's white. 

Horned Larks are eminently terrestrial, rarely if 
 ever choosmg a higher perch than a fence. When on 
 the ground they do not hop, but walk or run. When 
 flushed they take wing with a sharp, whistled note, but 
 often return to the place from which they started. "When 
 nesting, they may be found in fields, pastures, and plains 
 in scattered pairs, but during the winter they are asso- 
 ciated in flocks, which resort to the vicinity of the sea- 
 coast or large open tracts in the interior. The nest is, 
 of course, built on the ground. The eggs, three or four 
 in number, are pale bluish or greenish white, minutely 
 and evenly speckled with grayish brown. 

The Horned Lark, like its famous relative and many 
 other terrestrial species, sings while on the wing, soaring 
 high above the earth, and often repeating its song many 
 times before alighting. The effort is worthy of better 
 results, for the bird's song is simple and unmusical.
