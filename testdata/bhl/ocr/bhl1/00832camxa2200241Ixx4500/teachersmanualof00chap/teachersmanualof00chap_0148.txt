12S CROWS AND JAYS. 

Crows, Jays, etc. (Family Corvid^'e.) 

There are systematists wlio think that the members 
 of this family should hold the place usually assigned the 
 Thrushes, at the head of the class Aves. Leaving out of 
 the case anatomical details whose value is disputed, we 
 might object to a family of songless birds being given first 
 rank in a grouj) whose leading character is power of 
 song. But while Crows and Jays may, from a musical 
 standpoint, he considered songless, no one can deny their 
 great vocal powers. Song, after all, does not imply high 
 rank in bird-life, and some of the sweetest singers (among 
 others, some Snipe, and the Tinamous and Wood Quail 
 of South America) are not members of the suborder of 
 Son2r Birds. 

If, however, the relative intelligence of the two fam- 
 ilies be taken into account, there can be no doubt that 
 CorvidcB fully deserve to be considered the most highly 
 developed of birds. How many tales are told of the 
 human actions of the Baven, Book, JackdaAV, Magpie, 
 Jay, and Crow ! 

Of the two hundred members of this family, six in- 
 habit eastern jSTorth America, by far the most common

Corvus americaiius. IS better kuown, and still, how ignorant 

Plate LXXX. ^^ ^^.^ ^-f ^a^ w^ays ! I am not sure 

that he does not know more about ours. We have not 
 even recorded his notes, for, in spite of the current opin- 
 ion that the Crow's calls are restricted to caw, he has an 
 extended vocabulary. I am not aware that he ever 
 ascends to the height of a love song, but that he can 
 converse fluently no one who has listened to him ^411 
 question. Of the variants of ccno, each with its own 
 significance, there seems no end ; but if you would be
