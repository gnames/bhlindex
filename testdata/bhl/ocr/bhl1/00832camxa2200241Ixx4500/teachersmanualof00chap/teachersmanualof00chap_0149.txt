AMERICAN CROW. 129 

impressed with the Crow's eloquence you must hear liim 
 when, in the fancied privacy of his own flock or family, 
 he discusses the alfairs of the day. His notes then are 
 low, and so varied in tone that one can not doubt their 
 conversational character. 

During the winter Crows assemljle in large flocks 
 containing many thousand individuals, who nightly re- 
 turn to some roost, which perhaps has been frequented 
 for years. In March they begin to pair and the nest is 
 constructed early in April. It is a bulky affair of 
 sticks, lined chiefly vnth. grapevine bark, and is placed in 
 a tree, usually about thirty feet from the ground. The 
 four to six eggs are bluish green, thickly marked with 
 shades of brown. 

Crows share with Hawks the reputation of being 
 harmful birds. That they do much damage in the corn- 
 field is undeniable, but, after the examination of nine 
 hundred Crows' stomachs, Dr. Merriam, of the Depart- 
 ment of Agriculture, states that the amount of good 
 done by the Crow in destroying grasshoppers. May 
 beetles, cutworms, and other injurious insects, exceeds 
 the loss caused by the destruction of corn. Moreover, if 
 the corn be tarred before planting, the Crows will not 
 touch either the kernel or young sprout. The corn 
 should first be soaked in water overnight, and then 
 placed in a vessel containing enough soft tar to coat each 
 kernel. It should then be rolled in plaster of Paris or 
 wood ashes, so that it can be more easily handled.* 

The Blue Jay, in his uniform of blue and white, is so 
 brightly colored, so large (he is nearly twelve inches in 
 length), and often so noisy, that every one knows him.
