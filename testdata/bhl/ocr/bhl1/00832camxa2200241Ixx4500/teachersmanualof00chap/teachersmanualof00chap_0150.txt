130 BLUE JAY. 

Like the Crow, lie is with us throughout the year. Dur- 
 ing the summer he is not very common, and is remark- 
 Blue Jay ^^^J quiet, but in September and Octo- 
 Cyanocitta cristata. bor migrants arrive from the ^N'orth, and 
 Plate LXXXI. ^q birds are then abundant in bands. 
 These bands roam about the country hke a lot of school- 
 boys out chestnutting, pausing wherever they find acorns 
 and chestnuts abundant, or leaving their feast to worry 
 some poor Owl whose hiding place they have discovered. 

The Blue Jay's best friend could not conscientiously 
 call him a songster, but as a conversationalist he rivals 
 the Crow. I have yet to discover a limit to his vocab- 
 ulary, and, although on principle one may ascribe al- 
 most any strange call to the Blue Jay, it is well to with- 
 hold judgment until his loud, harsh jay ! jay I betrays 
 the caller's identity. Not content with a language of 
 his own, he borrows from other birds, mimicking their 
 calls so closely that the birds themselves are deceived. 
 The Bed-shouldered, Bed-tail, and Sparrow Hawks are 
 the species whose notes he imitates most often. 

The Blue Jay nests in the latter part of May, build- 
 ing a compact nest of rootlets in a tree ten to twenty 
 feet from the ground. The eggs are pale olive-green 
 or brownish ashy, rather thickly marked with varyuig 
 shades of cinnamon-brown. 

Orioles, Blackbirds, etc. (Family Icterid^e.) 

The popular names of many of our birds were given 
 them by the early colonists because of their fancied re- 
 semblance to some Old World species. The fact that 
 some of these names are incorrect and misleading has 
 been pointed out scores of times, but they are now as 
 firmly fixed as the signs of the zodiac.
