The Ivedwhig's liquid koixj-quer-vce is pleasantly 
 suggestive of marshy places, but it is his early spring 
 nnisic for which we should chiefly value him. The first 
 Rubins or Bluebirds are somewhat unreliable signs of 
 spring. They are such hardy birds that it requires very 
 little encouragement from a February sun to send a few 
 skirmishers northward. We can not be sure whether 
 they represent the advance guard or are individuals who 
 have had the courage to winter with us. But when early

 Blackbirds, known as the Purple Grackle and the Bronzed

 Alleghanies and south of Massachusetts; the latter has 
 the back shining, brassy, bronze, without iridescence, and 
 in the nesting season inhabits the country west of the 
 Alleghanies and north of Connecticut. The females of 
 both species are smaller and duller than the males. 

Grackles are among the few of our land birds who 
 live in flocks all the year. They pass the winter and mi-
