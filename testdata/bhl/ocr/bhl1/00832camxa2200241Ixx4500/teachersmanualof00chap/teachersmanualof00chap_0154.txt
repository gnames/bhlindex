bands or colonies. They generally select a pine grove, 
 often choosing one in a cemetery, park, or other locality 
 where they will not be disturbed. This may result in a 
 scarcity of food when the young are born, but, rather 
 than abandon a locality which experience has proved to 
 be safe, they make long journeys in search of food for 
 their nestlings. By watching the old birds one may then 
 easily learn where they live. Their flight is direct and 
 somewhat labored, and when going only a short distance 
 they " keel " their tail-feathers, folding them upward 
 from the middle, an action which renders Grackles con- 
 spicuous and easily identifiable when on the wing. On the 
 ground they strut about with a peculiar walk, which, in 
 connection with their yellowish white eye, adds to the 
 singularity of their appearance. 

The Grackle's nest is a bulky, compact structure of 
 mud and grasses. It is usually placed in trees, twenty to 
 thirty feet from the ground, but the bird may sometimes 
 nest in bushes or even in a Woodpecker's deserted hole. 
 The three to six eggs are generally pale bluish green, 
 strikingly spotted, blotched, or scrawled with brown and 
 black. But one brood is raised, and when the young 
 leave the nest they roam about the country in small 
 bands, which later join together, forming the enormous 
 flocks of these birds we see in the fall. 

The Bobolink's extended journeys and quite differ-
