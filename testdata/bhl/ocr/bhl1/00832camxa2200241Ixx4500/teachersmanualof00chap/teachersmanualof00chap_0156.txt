is almost sure to find Meadowlarks. They are strong- 
 lego^ed walkers, and spend all their time while feeding 
 Meadowlark, ^n the ground. Like all terrestrial, 
 stunieiia magna, protectively colored birds, they often 
 Plate XXXIX. ^^j ^^ escape observation by hiding in 
 the grasses rather than by flying. "Wlien perched in a 
 tree or other exposed position, they are among the shyest 
 of our smaller birds, rarely permitting a near approach ; 
 but when they fancy themselves concealed on the ground 
 they sometimes "lie as close" as Bob-whites. When 
 flushed they fly rapidly, alternately flapping and sailing, 
 showing as they fly the white feathers on either side of 
 their tail. These feathers are the Meadowlark's best field 
 character. They are very conspicuous when he is on the 
 wing, and, when perching, if he is alarmed or excited, he 
 exposes them by nervously flitting or twitching his tail. 
 This movement is generally accompanied by a single 
 nasal call-note, which changes to a rolling twitter as the 
 bird takes wing. ISTeither of these notes give any indi- 
 cation of the sweetness of the bii'd's song, a high nmsical 
 whistle, clear as the note of a flfe, sweet as the tone of a 
 flute. It is subject to much variation both individual 
 and local, but the song I oftenest hear in northern ^New 
 Jersey may be written :

"When singing, the birds usually perch in an exposed po- 
 sition, generally choosing the topmost branches of a tree 
 or a dead limb. 

The Meadowlark's nest is placed upon the ground, as 
 a rule, in a tuft of grasses which is arranged to form a 
 dome over it. The eggs, four to six in number, are laid 
 about May 15, and in color are white, spotted or speckled 
 with cinnamon or reddish brown.
