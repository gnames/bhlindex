Foocittex (jnunineus. ahead of jou, and when he flies the 

iMute XLiv. white feathers shown on either side of 
 his tail will give you an excellent clew to his identity. 
 Probably he will fly on ahead a little way and alight 
 again in the road, or a longer flight may lead him to a 
 neighboring fence or the upper branches of a more dis-

 portance. He can not, like many birds, sing between the 
 mouthfuls of a meal, but ascending to his perch he gives 
 perhaps lialf an hour entirely to music, resting motionless
