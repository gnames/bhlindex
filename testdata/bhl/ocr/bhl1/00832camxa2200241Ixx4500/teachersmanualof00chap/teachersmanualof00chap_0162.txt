overnin the land. He was introduced into tliis country 
 in 1851, and in 1870 was found only in tlie cities of the 
 Atlantic States. Now he has spread over the greater 
 part of the United States and Canada. 

If he were restricted to the cities we should have only 
 his never-ceasing, maddening chatter and our soiled walls 
 to complain of ; but he has invaded not only the towns 
 and villages and the neighboring houses, but visits also 
 our grain fields and fruit orchards, our woods and marshes. 
 JSTo effective method for his extermination has been de- 
 vised, and I fear we must accept the Sparrow as a penalty 
 for the shortsightedness and ignorance which permitted 
 us to meddle with the laws of IS'ature.

 long ago given up the attempt to make friends with us, 
 so rarely do we show any appreciation of his advances. 
 The house cat is Chippy's chief enemy. Crouching and 
 crawling, waiting and watching, she misses no opportunity 
 to pounce on an unsuspecting bird. It is surprising that 
 any escape. But each spring, about April 10, the Chippy 
 comes back to us after a winter in the cotton, corn, and 
 broom-sedge fields of the South, and soon we hear his 
 unpretentious, monotonous ehijjjjy-cMjjpy-chij)]}]/^ many 
 times repeated, and occasionally running into a grasshop-

About a month later we may find further evidence of 
 his too often misplaced trust in a neat, hair-lined nest 
 built in the vines on the veranda or a neighboring tree. 
 The eggs are unexpectedly pretty, a bright blue or bluish
