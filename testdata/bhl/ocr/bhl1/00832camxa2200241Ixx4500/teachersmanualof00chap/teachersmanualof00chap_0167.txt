JUNCO. 145 

glanoe at his short, Btout hill at once shows his faiTiily rela- 
 tionships, and you should have no ditheulty in identifying 
 him as the Fox Sparrow. 

A month later he will leave us for his summer home 
 in the far Xorth, but in October and November his 
 rin lining notes may again be heard as he pauses a day or 
 two on his journey southward. 

After the Fox Sparrows go, our bird-life is reduced to 

its winter elements â€” that is, pennanent residents and win- 

Junco *^^ visitants. Of the latter the Junco 

jnn,o hii.inaJis. ov Slate-colored Snowbird is the com- 

Piate XLViii. monest and most generally distributed. 

Although we call this bird a winter visitant, he is with 

us nearly eight months in the year, arriving late in Sep- 

temi)er and remaining until early May. 

The Junco is one of the birds whose acquaintance can 
 be easily made. His suit of slaty gray, with its low-cut 
 vest of white, is not worn ])y any other of our birds ; and 
 while some species show white outer tail-feathers in flight, 
 the Junco's seem to be more than usually conspicuous. 

Except when nesting, Juncos associate in loose flocks 
 of from ten to flfty. Generally you will find them feed- 
 ing on the ground near evergreens, into which, when dis- 
 turbed, they will fly with a twittering note. If they are 
 excited by your appearance you ^vill hear a sharp, kissing 
 call ; but if unalarmed they will utter a rapidly repeated 
 chew-chew-chew, expressive of the utmost contentment. 
 In March and April, before leaving for their summer 
 home in northern New England or the crests of the 
 Alleghanies and Catskills, the Juncos sing a simple trill 
 or low, twittering warble. Modest in manner and attire, 
 there is nothing of especial interest in the J unco's habits, 
 and only bird-lovers can understand what a dilTerence his 
 presence makes in a winter landscape. It brings a sense 
 of companionship ; it is a link between us and Nature.
