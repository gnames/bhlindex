14:0 TREE SPARROW AND REDPOLL. 

The bird's cheery twitter is as welcome as a raj of sun- 
 light on a cloudy day. 

With the Jiincos we may often find a company of 
 Tree Sparrows or Winter Chippies. They resemble our 

Tree Sparrow, familiar Chipping Sparrow, but the 
 Spiziiia innnticoia. blackish dot in the center of their 

Plate XLix. breasts is a good distinguishing mark. 
 Then, too, the true Chippies all leave for the South in 
 IS'ovember, while the Winter Chippies come in October 
 and remain until April. 

Tree Sparrows are sociable birds, mth apparently the 
 best of dispositions. They are usually found in small 
 companies, each member of which seems to have some- 
 thing to say. Watch them feeding on an old weed stalk 
 left uncovered by the snow. It bends beneath the weight 
 of half a dozen birds, but, far from attempting to rob one 
 another, they keep up a conversational chatter bespeakmg 
 the utmost good fellowshi]). Too-ld-it, too-ld-it^ each one 
 calls, and I have only to remember this note to bring 
 clearly to mind a bright winter morning with the fresh 
 snow crystals sparkling in the sunshine, and in the dis- 
 tance a tinkling chorus of Tree Sparrows at breakfast. 

Another Avinter associate of the Junco's, and an inti- 
 mate friend of the Tree Sparrow's, is the Redpoll, Red- 
 Eedpoll P^^^ Linnet, or, as he is sometimes 

Acanthis linaria. called, Rcd-cappcd Chippy. The Red- 
 Plate L. p^ij nests in the far JS^oi-th, and the 
 extent of his southern journeys depends very much upon 
 the supply of food he finds in his winter wanderings. 
 When there are seeds in abundance north of the United 
 States, we do not see many of these birds, but if the 
 larder fails they may come into I^ew England in great 
 numbers, and a few may venture as far south as Yirginia. 
 One can not tell, therefore, when to expect them, but it 
 is well to be on the lookout from November to March.
