iin 1 it difficult to believe that, iinkno\m to nie, this bean- 
 tit'ul creature could long have been an inlial)itant of mj 
 woods. 

The Grosl)eak prefers young second growths, with a 
 liberal proportion of oaks. In one of these trees he will 
 doubtless build his nest, a structure so lightly made that 
 one can almost see the blue, spotted eggs from below. 
 The male is not only an ardent lover but an admirable 
 husband, and, unlike most brightly attired birds, shares 
 with his mate the task of incubation, and, it is said, 
 sings while on the nest. His mate is so unlike him in 
 color that few would suspect their relationship. She 
 suggests an overgro'svn female Purple Finch, with the 
 eye-stripe especially prominent ; but if you should chance 
 to see the under surface of her wings, you would find 
 that they were lined with gold. However, the call-notes 
 of both sexes are alike — a sharp, characteristic jpeek^ which 
 you mil have no difiiculty in recognizing after you have 
 learned it. 

The Grosbeak's song will remind you of a Robin's, 
 but it is in truth a much higher t}^e of bird music. 
 It is a joyous carol, expressive of a happy disposition 
 and a clear conscience. 

The Towhee, or Chewink, is an important member of 

any bird community. He comes early — April 20 may

 Chewink if you know how to look for him. At midday 
 you will perhaps have to summon him by a whistled to-

 a wood or thicket ; Init he will soon respond, and with a 
 fl^fff-fl^iff of his short, rounded wings, fiy jerkily up to 
 inquire what's wanted.
