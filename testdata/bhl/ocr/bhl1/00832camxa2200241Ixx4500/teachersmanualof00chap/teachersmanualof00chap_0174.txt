152 INDIGO BUNTING. 

Some birds, such as the Red-ejed Yireo, can sing just 
 as well while hunting food as at any other time ; in fact, 
 I do not remember ever seeing a Ked-eye pause long 
 in its search for insects â€” song and search go on together. 
 But with the Chewink singing is a serious matter, not to 
 be associated with the material question of food ; so, when 
 singing, he abandons the dead leaves he has been tossing 
 about so vigorously, and, mounting a perch, becomes an 
 inspired if not gifted musician. Sweet hird^ sing, a friend 
 writes it, the " sing" being higher, sustained, and vibrant. 
 To this there is often a refrain which suggests an an-

 dried grass, beneath a tangle of running ^dld blackberry. 
 The eggs, four or five in number, are white, -^lelj and 
 evenly speckled with reddish brown. 

There are three birds who sing not only through the 
 heat of midsummer but are undaunted by the warmth of 
 Indigo Bunting, ^ midday sun. They are the Wood 
 Fasserina cyanea. Pcwce, the Rcd-eyed Yirco, and the In- 
 nate Lxxxiii. digo-bird or Bunting. The Pewee and 
 Yireo, singing dreamily from the shady depths of a tree, 
 carry the air to the hummed accompaniment of insects ; 
 but the Bunting, mounting to an upper branch, gives 
 voice to a tinkling warble, more in keeping with the 
 freshness of early morning than the languor of noon. 
 July, July, summer -summer'^ s here; morning, noontide, 
 evening, list to me, he sings so rapidly that human tongue 
 can scarce enumerate the words fast enough to keep pace 
 with him. The Indigo-bird is in song when he comes to 
 us from the South early in May, but it is not until other
