Not far away his mate is doubtless sitting on her Idu- 
 ish white eggs in a nest low down in the crotch of a l)U>h. 
 He in liis deep indigo costume may be easily identilied, 
 but she is a dull brownish bird, about the size of a Ca- 
 nary, sparrowlike in appearance, though with unstreaked 
 ])lumage, and a dithcult bird to name, even when you 
 have a specimen in your hand, while in the bush, if silent, 
 she is a puzzle. But she is far too good a mother not to 
 protest if you venture too near her home, and her sharp 
 jnt or jyeet usually calls her mate, whom you will recog- 
 nize at once. 

The Cardinal is about the size of a Towhee, with 
 plumage which, except for a black throat, is almost 
 Cardinal wdiolly rosy red. Seeing a mounted 

Cnrdinaiis cardinalis. Cardinal, oue might imagine that he 
 Plate Lxxxiv. ^^g ^ conspicuous bird in life and easy 
 to observe ; but the truth is that, in spite of his bright 
 colors, the Cardinal is a surprisingly difficult bird to see. 
 You may often hear his sharp, insignificant tsip without 
 catching a glimpse of the caller, so well can he conceal 
 himself. His olive-brown mate is, of course, even more 
 difficult to find, and when you do see her you would 
 hardly suspect the relationship wxre it not for her actions 
 and the striking crest worn by both sexes. 

The Cardinal's song is a rich, sympathetic whistle. 
 His mate also sings at times, and I carry in my memory 
 a musical courting I once observed, in which a pair of 
 these beautiful birds w^ere the actors. The song begins 
 with v'hof-you^ ichee-you^ long-drawn notes, which are 
 followed by a more rapid hurry ^ hurry, hurri/ ; quicl\ 
 quicl\ qui<-l\ and other notes difficult of description. 
 The Cardinal is a bird of the Southern rather than of 
 the Northern States, and is rarely seen north of New
