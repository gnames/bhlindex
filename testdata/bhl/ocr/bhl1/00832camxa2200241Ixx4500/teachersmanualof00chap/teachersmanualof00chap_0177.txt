DICKCISSEL. 155 

Some thirty or forty years ago the Dickcisscl, or 
 Black -throated Bunting, was a locally connuon binl in 
 Dickcissel ^^^^ j\Iid(lle Atlantic States. Now it is 

Spiza amcricana. rarely found east of the Alleghanies, 
 Plate LVI. j^j^j g^.^jj '^^ ^\^Q Mississippi \' alley its 

range is becoming restricted, and it is of irregular distri- 
 bution. 

It migrates in large flocks, the males in the spring 
 being several days in advance of the females. About 
 May 1 it reaches the latitude of Chicago, and by the mid- 
 dle of the month is mated. The nest is placed on the 
 ground, or in low trees or bushes ; the eggs, four or five 
 in number, are pale blue. 

In the work previously quoted from, Mr. Ridgway 
 writes of this species : " While some other birds are 
 equally numerous, there are few that announce their 
 presence as j)ersistently as this species. All day long, 
 in spring and summer, the males, sometimes to the num- 
 ber of a dozen or more for each meadow of considerable 
 extent, perch upon the summits of tall weed stalks or 
 fence-stakes, at short intervals, crying out : See, see â€” 
 Dick, Dick Cissel, Cissel ; therefore ^ Dick Cissel ' is well 
 knowTi to every farmer's boy as well as to all who visit 
 the country during the season of clover blossoms and wild 
 roses, when ' Dame Nature ' is in her most joyous mood." 

Tanagers. (Family Tanagrid.e.) 

The Tanagers, numbering some three hundred and 
 fifty species, are found only in America. Their home 
 is in the tropics, where they are among the most abun- 
 dant of birds. But two s])ecies reach the eastern United 
 States, the Summer Eedbird of the South and our Scar- 
 let Tanager, both worthy representatives of a group 
 of birds which in brilliancy of color rival even the Hum-
