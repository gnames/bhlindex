SWALLOWS. . l,-37 

The aC'rial ability of Swallows accounts for their wide 
 (listiibutioii, the eiirlity kn(>wn species being re})resented 
 in all parts of the world. < )nly six of them inhabit the 
 northeastern States, but they are so active and so easily 
 observed, that they rank among our most abundant and 
 best-known birds. 

Swallows are eminently insectivorous. The Tree Swal- 
 low is known to feed on bay berries when its usual fare is 
 wanting, but, with this exception, it is doubtful if any 
 but insect food passes a Swallow's bill from one year's 
 end to another. Recalling now the activity of Swallows, 
 which both necessitates a large supply of food and pro- 
 cures it, and we nuist realize that these birds are incal- 
 culably beneficial. 

Both the feeding habits and powers of flight of Swal- 
 lows are such as their structure would lead us to expect, 
 but when we examine their nests we are amazed at the 
 architectural skill of builders so poorly provided with 
 tools. The large mud pocket of the Barn Swallow, the 
 clay retort of the Cliif Swallow, and the long burrow 
 which the Bank Swallow excavates, are surely not the 
 kind of homes we should expect these small-billed, weak- 
 footed, dainty creatures to construct. We will note, too, 
 that these feathered architects are quick to perceive and 
 take advantage of the new and favorable conditions for 
 nest-l)uilding found al)out the home of man. 

The Bank, Kough-w4nged, and Tree Swallows, and 
 the Purple Martin, lay white eggs ; the eggs of the Barn 
 and nitf Swallows are speckled with cinnamon, olive, and 
 reddish brown. 

It is when nesting that Swallows best show one of 
 their strong characteristics â€” their sociability. Many birds 
 live in flocks during part of the year, but separate in pairs 
 when nesting; but most Swallows live on terms of such 
 intimacy that their nests seem to be merely apartments in
