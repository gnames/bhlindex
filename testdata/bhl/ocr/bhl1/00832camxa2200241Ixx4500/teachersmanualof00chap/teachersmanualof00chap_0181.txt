The Barn Swallow is the most generally distrilmted 

of our Swallows, its habits of ncstiii<^ in outhiiildings

enjthrogasUr. seven iuclies loug ; the upper parts and 
 rontispicce.y giJes of the breast are steel-blue, the 
 forehead and throat chestnut, the rest of the under ])arts 
 ])aler ; the tail deeply forked and marked with white. Its 
 long tail is a most ethcient rudder, permitting the abrupt 
 turns which make its flight more erratic than that of any 
 other of our Swallows. It skims low over the fields, or 
 darts through the village streets with a rapidity and indi- 
 rectness which I never witness without astonishment. 

The Barn Swallow arrives from its winter home in 
 the tropics about April 15 and remains until late in 
 September. Its nest is generally placed on a beam in 
 a barn or other outbuilding, and is composed of nmd 
 and 2:rasses lined with feathers. 

The Cliff or Eave Swallow is less generally distributed 

than the Barn Swallow. It nests in colonies, placing its 

„,.„„ „ rows of mud tenements under cliffs in

 returns to it year after year, arriving from the South 
 about May 1, and remaining until late September. It is 
 six inches long ; the forehead is whitish, the crown and 
 back steel-l)lue, the rump rusty ; the throat chestnut with 
 a blackish area ; the belly white. 

Like the Cliff Swallow, the Bank Swallow nests in 

colonies, and is very local during the breeding season. A
