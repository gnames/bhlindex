100 TREE SWALLOW. 

Tlie Bank Swallow winters in the tropics and readies 
 us in the spring about April 20, remaining until late Sep- 
 tember. It is the smallest of our Swallows, measuring 
 only five inches in length, and is the only one, except the 
 Hough- winged Swallow, which has no metallic coloring 
 in its plumage, the back being plain brownish gray, the 
 under parts wliite, with a clearly defined bro^vnish gray 
 band across the breast. The Rough-wing is a more south- 
 ern bird, being rare north of southern Connecticut. It 
 resembles the Bank Swallow, but differs chiefly in having 
 the whole breast brownish gray. It nests in holes in 
 banks, and also about stone bridges, trestles, and similar 
 structures. 

Though very generally distributed, there are large 

areas within the breeding range of the Tree Swallow 

Tree Swallow where it is known only as a migrant. 

Tacivjcineta bicoior. In tlic wilder part of its range it nests 

(Frontispiece.) -j-^ hollow trees; in the more settled 
 portions it uses bird-boxes. During recent years, as Mr. 
 Brewster has remarked, the always-present House Spar- 
 row has pre-empted the former abodes of the Tree Swal- 
 low, so that it no longer nests about our homes ; but as 
 a migrant its numbers are undiminished, and it is prob- 
 ably our most abundant Swallow. 

Being the only Swallow to winter in the eastern 
 United States, the Tree Swallow is the first to arrive in 
 the spring, coming to us from Florida early in April. It 
 is also the last of its family to leave us in the fall, often 
 remaining near IS'ew York city until October 20. 

Immature birds have the upper parts brownish gray 
 instead of shining steel-blue, as in the adult, but in either 
 plumage the bird may be known by its pure white under 
 parts, which have given to it the name of White-belhed 
 Swallow. 

In the northern United States Martins are very local.
