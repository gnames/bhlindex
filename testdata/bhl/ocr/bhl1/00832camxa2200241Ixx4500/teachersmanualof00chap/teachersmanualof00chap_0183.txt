 more companionable, none more quiet. In their fondness 
 for one another's society they seem to delay the pairing 
 season, and long after other birds have gone to house- 
 keeping they are still roving about in flocks. Finally, 
 late in June, they settle down and build a nest of generous 
 proportions, often in some fruit tree, about ten feet from 
 the ground. The three to five eggs are pale bluish gray 
 or putty-color, spotted with black or brownish black.

 which is prolonged into a louder call — a string of beady 
 notes — as they take wing.
