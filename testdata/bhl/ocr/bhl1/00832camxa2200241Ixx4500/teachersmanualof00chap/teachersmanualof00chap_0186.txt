16,1: RED-EYED VIREO. 

poiiclilike affairs of strips of pliable bark, bits of dead 
 wood, plant-fibers, tendrils, fine grasses, etc., firmly inter- 
 woven and suspended from the arms of a forked twig. 
 The eggs are white, with a few black, or brownish black 
 spots, chiefly about the larger end. 

The Yireos are an exclusively American family, and 

number some fifty species, of which seven reach the 

Red-eyed Vireo, northeastern States. Of these, by far 

Rreo oiivaceus. the most commou is the Red-eyed 

Plate Lix. Yireo. There are few favorable locali- 

ties in eastern ]N^orth America where, in the summer, 
 one may not hear the cheerful song of this bird. Still, 
 it is so well protected by the foliage, with which its 
 plumage agrees in color, that to those whose ear is not 
 attuned to the music of birds it is unknown. But listen 
 near some grove of elms or maples, and you will not fail 
 to hear its song — a somewhat broken, rambling recitative, 
 which no one has described so well as Wilson Flagg, who 
 calls this bird the Preacher, and interprets its notes as 
 " You see it — you know it — do you hear me ? — do you be- 
 lieve it ? " The Red-eye evidently has an inquiring mind, 
 for he never tires of asking these questions. He not 
 only sings all day, but seems unaffected by the heat of 
 summer, and at midday is often the only bird to be heard. 
 One would imagine that few birds had a more even tem- 
 perament than this calm-voiced singer, but when annoyed 
 he utters a complaining ivhang — a sound which is a good 
 indication that something is wrong in the bird world. 

The Red-eye winters in the tropics, and reaches us in 
 the spring about May 1, remaining until October 15. 

A near relative of the Red-eye's is the Warbling 
 Yireo — a somewhat smaller bird, with a brown, in place 
 of red eye, and ^vithout the black margin above the white 
 eye-line which can be so easily seen in the Red-eye. The 
 •Warblinor Yireo is the less common of the two, and is
