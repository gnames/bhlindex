106 WARBLERS. 

lower growth ; thickets of cat -brier are his favorite 
 haunts. He is therefore nearer our level, and seems to 
 address us more directly than do the birds that call from 
 the tree tops. If you linger near his home he will inquire 
 your business with a vigorous " I say, who are you, eh ? " 
 and if you do not take this hint to move on he will 
 doubtless follow it with a scolding whose intent is unmis- 
 takable. He has a variety of exclamatory calls, and 
 sometimes may be heard softly singing a song composed 
 largely of imitations of the notes of other birds. 

The AVhite-eve can easily be known from the Red-eye 
 and Warbling Yireos by the narrow white bands across 
 the tips of its wing-coverts. In this respect it resembles

 by its smaller size (length 5*25 inches), white iris, and 
 white breast, only the sides of the l)reast being tinged 
 with yellow. It winters from Florida southward, and 
 reaches us in the spring about May 1, to remain until 
 October.

 thirty-five species regularly found in the northeastern 
 States, only three or four are familiar to the casual ob- 
 server. The presence of the others is unsuspected, and 
 when some chance brings one of these exquisite little 
 creatures into our lives, the event is attended by all the 
 excitement of an actual discovery. We never forget our 
 first Warbler. 

It is because we do not see Warblers unless we look 
 for them that they are strangers to so many persons who 
 go to the woods. They are, with some exceptions, small 
 birds of limited vocal powers. They live in the tree tops,
