 will greet you, you will see a modestly attired little 
 walker daintily picking his way over the leaves and fallen 
 branches, with crest slightly erect, and head nodding at 
 each step. 

Probably, however, your first acquaintance with the 
 Oven-bird will be made through the medium of his song. 
 There are few bits of woodland where in May and Jmie

 loud, ringing, crescendo chant, to which Mr. Burroughs's 
 description of "teacher, teacher, teacher, TEACHER, 
 TEAGHEE " is so applicable that no one would think of 
 describing it in any other way. The bird seems to exert 
 himself to the utmost, and no one hearing this far from 
 musical performance would imagine that he could im-

 haunts, you may hear a song whose wildness is startling.

 builder's name. The Oven-bird arrives from the South
