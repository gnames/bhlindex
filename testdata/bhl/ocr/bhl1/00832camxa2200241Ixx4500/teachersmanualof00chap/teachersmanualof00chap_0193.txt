about May 1, and its eÂ«j:gs are laid ab(,)Ut the 2r^th of the

 mon and reddish hrown. 

The ^laryland Yellow-throat is an abundant inhabit- 
 ant of thickets and bushy undergrowths, readily iden- 
 tilled by his black mask and yellow 
 Yellow-throat, breast, nervous activity, and character-

riute LXi\ . proached with caution, but nothing save 
 an actual attack upon his home will cause the Yellow- 
 throat to leave its shelter. Hopping from limb to limb, 
 he advances to the border of the thicket, then retreats to 
 its depths, all the time uttering an impatient cliack^ chit, 
 or pit, and, if forced to fly, he goes only to the next clump 
 of bushes. 

The Yellow-throat's somewhat explosive song is so 
 easily set to words and so variable that there are many 
 versions of it. It is described as whitititee, whitititee, 
 ichititltee ; rapity, rajjity, rapity, rap, or icitch-e-icee-o, 
 iciti'h-e-icee-o, iviteh-e-wee-o. Mr. Burroughs says he has 
 heard birds whose notes sounded like the words " Which 
 way, sir ? " and I have heard some who seemed to say 
 *' Wait a minute." 

To this the Yellow- throat sometimes adds a flight 
 sonor, which is a miniature of the Oven-bird's aerial sere- 
 nade. It is generally added to his usual song, and is 
 most often heard late in the season at evening, when 
 the bird may be seen springing into the air above his 
 bushy retreat. 

The Yellow-throat arrives from the South about May 
 1, and remains until the middle of October. Late in 
 May a Inilky nest of grasses, strips of bark, and dead 
 leaves, lined wnth finer materials, is built on or near the 
 ground. The three to five eggs are white, rather thinly 
 BDeckled with reddish brown. Often an ei?g of the Cow-
