bird will be found in tlie nest, Yellow-throats being one 
 of the birds most frequently chosen by the Cowbird as 
 foster-parents. 

The Chat is the largest of the Warblers, and so unlike 

them, or any other birds, in disposition that if classifica- 

YeUow-breastedChat, ^ion were based on character, the Chat 

jderia virens. wouM surely bc placod in a family by 

Plate Lxv. itself. The Chat's pecuharities are 
 numerous, but are most evident in his song. Many 
 times I have sat, note-book and pencil in hand, trying to 
 express in words the song of a Chat singing in a neigh- 
 boring thicket, but I have never succeeded in putting on 
 paper anything which would convey an adequate idea of 
 the bird's remarkable vocal performances. Of others 
 who have attempted the same task, I think Mr. Bur-

 medley. He says : " Now he barks like a puppy, then 
 quacks like a Duck, then rattles like a Kingfisher, then 
 squalls like a fox, then caws like a Crow, then mews like 
 a cat. . . . C-r-r-r-r-r — wtirr — ihat^s it — chee — quaclc,

 be pardoned for doubting that a bird can produce so 
 strange a series of noises, but if you will go to the Chat's 
 haunts in thickety openings in the woods, or other bushy 
 places, and let him speak for himself, you ^vill admit that 
 our alpliabet can not do him justice. To hear the Chat is 
 one thing, to see him quite another. But he will repay 
 study, and if you will conceal yourself near his home you 
 may see him deliver part of his repertoire while on the 
 wing, with legs dangling, wings and tail flapping, and his 
 whole appearance suggesting that of a bird who has had 
 an unfortunate encounter with a charge of shot. 

But if the Chat's song is surprising when heard dur- 
 ing the day, imagine the effect it creates at night when
