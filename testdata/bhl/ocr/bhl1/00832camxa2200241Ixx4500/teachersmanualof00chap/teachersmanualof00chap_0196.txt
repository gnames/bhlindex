174: MOCKINGBIRD. 

former is a petulant, winning, nasal tchay^ to me one of 
 the most disagreeable sounds in Mature, and so unlike 
 the bird's song that he seems possessed of a dual person- 
 ality. The Catbird's song, from a musical standpoint, is 
 excelled by that of few of our birds. His voice is full 
 and rich, his execution and phrasing are faultless ; but 
 the effect of his song, sweet and vaned as it is, is marred 
 by the smger's too evident consciousness. 

The Catbird's relative, the Mockingbird, is an abun- 
 dant inhabitant of the southern United States from Yir- 

Mockingbird, ginia to California, and ranges south- 
 Mimus pohjgiottos. ward iuto Mcxico. In the Eastern 

Plate LX\ 1. States it is not common north of south- 
 em Illinois and Virginia, but in summer it is found in 
 small numbers as far north as Ma chusetts, where a few 
 pairs breed each season. It is exceedingly domestic in 
 its habits, and in the South there are few suitable gar- 
 dens, either in the town or country, which are not inhab- 
 ited by a pair of Mockingbirds. 

The power of mimicry for which this bird is cele- 
 brated has, I think, been unduly exaggerated, and the 
 fact that its usual song contains several notes resembling 
 those of other species doubtless in part accounts for its 
 much overrated ability as a mimic. It is unnecessary, 
 however, for the Mockingbird to borrow the notes of other 
 birds, for his own song places him in the front rank of 
 our songsters. It is delivered with a spirit and animation 
 which add greatly to its attractiveness. The Mocking- 
 bird does not sing between mouthfuls, as do the Yireos, 
 or quietly from a perch, like the Towhee or Thrasher ; 
 he frequently changes his position, hopping from place 
 to place, making short flights, bounding into the air, and 
 displaying the white markings of his wings and tail, as 
 though it were impossible for him to give expression to 
 his emotion through the medium of voice alone. During
