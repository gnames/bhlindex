BROWN Til RASH i:i{. 175 

moonlight nights of the nesting season, Mockingbirds 
 sing all night. They are tlien less active, and, mounting 
 to some favorite perch, often a chimney top, flood the 
 still air with entrancing melody. 

Like the Catbird and Mocker, the Brown Thrasher or 

Ih'own ''Thrush" inhabits thickets and undergrowth.

 He arrives from the South the latter part of April, and 
 often remains until late in October. The nest is built 
 about May 15, and is placed on the ground or several feet 
 above it. The eggs are bluish or grayish white, thickly, 
 evenly, and minutely speckled with cinnamon or reddish 
 brown. 

As a songster I should rank the Thrasher between 
 the blocker and the Catbird. His song is less varied and 
 animated than the Mocker's, and while his technique may 
 not excel that of the Catbird, his song, to my mind, is 
 much more effective than the performance of that accom- 
 plished musician. Mounting to the topmost limb of a 
 tree, he sings uninterruptedly for several minutes. The 
 notes can be heard for at least a third of a mile, ringing 
 out clear and well defined above the medley of voices 
 that form the chorus of a ]\[ay morning. 

The intense vitality which characterizes the life of 
 birds finds its highest expression in the Wrens. Perpet-

 Wren at rest. 

In his movements, song, and nesting habits our House 
 Wren exhibits the characteristic traits of his family. He 
 is ever hopping, flitting, bobbing, or bowing, pausing
