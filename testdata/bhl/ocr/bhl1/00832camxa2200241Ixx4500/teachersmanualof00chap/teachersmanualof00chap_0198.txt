only long enough to give voice to his feelings in fidgetty, 
 scolding notes, or an effervescing, musical trill, with the 
 force of which his small body trembles. It is a wonder- 
 ful outburst of song, and the diminutive singer's enthu- 
 siasm and endurance are even more remarkable. The

The House Wren nests in almost any kind of suitable 
 hole or cavity, and will frequently take possession of a

 This is the Winter Wren, a bird that nests from north-

 crests of the Alleghanies to ^N'orth Carolina. It remains 
 with us in small numbers throughout the winter, return- 
 ing to its summer home in April. Mr. Burroughs writes 
 of the Winter Wren's song as a " wild, sweet, rhythmical
