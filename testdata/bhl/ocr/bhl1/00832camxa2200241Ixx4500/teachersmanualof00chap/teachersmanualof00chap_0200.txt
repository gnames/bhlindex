17S BROWN CREEPER. 

tomary scolding each; his song, a bubbling, trickling 
 tinkle that can not be called musical, but to my mind is 
 indescribably attractive. It is often sung in the air, and 
 in marshes where AVrens are abundant bird after bird 
 may be seen springing a few feet above the reeds, sing- 
 ing his song, and then dropping back again. 

Creepers. (Family Certhiid^.) 

Of the twelve known members of this family, the 
 Erown Creeper is the only one inhabiting the Kew 

AYorld. It is a northern bird, breed- 
 Brown Creeper, n r â€¢ 
 Certhia familiar is ing at sca Icvcl ouly from JMame north- 
 americana. ward, but extending southward m the 

Plate Lxx. Allegliauies to E'orth Carolina. Sev- 

eral western races are found in the Kocky Mountain 
 region and Sierra Madres. Our eastern bird migrates 
 southward late in September, and from that date until 
 April it may be found from Massachusetts to Florida. 

The Creeper, like a Woodpecker, never climbs head 
 downward, but, using his stiff, pointed tail-feathers (see 
 Fig. 3 6) as a prop, winds rapidly up the trunks of trees 
 in his apparently never-ending search for insects' eggs 
 and larvae hidden in crevices in the bark. If the Wrens 
 are the most active birds, the Creeper is the most dili- 
 gent. Except when it was stopping to secure some tid- 
 bit, I can not remember seeing a Creeper resting. He 
 usually begins at the base of a tree and climbs in a seri- 
 ous, intent way for a certain distance, and then, vrithout 
 a moment's pause, drops do'^Ti to the bottom of the next 
 tree and continues his search. 

The Creeper's only notes while with us are a thin, 
 fine squeak ; but Mr. Brewster tells us that during the 
 nesting season he has an exquisitely tender song of four 
 notes.
