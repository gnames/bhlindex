CHICKADEE. 179 

Titmice and Nuthatches. (Family Parid^.) 

Comparing the Titmice with tlie Xuthatches, the 
 former may be described as short-billed birds with loiii; 
 tails who do not creep, the latter as lonij^-billed birds 
 with short tails who do creep. The two groups are, in 
 fact, quite distinct, and by some systematists are phiced 
 in separate families. 

The Titmice number some seventy-five species, four 

of which are found in eastern Xorth America. The 

Chickadee connnoiiest and most generally distrib- 

Parusatrirai.iiius. uted is the Black-cappcd Chickadee, 

Plate LXX. ^hich is found from Labrador to Mary- 
 land and in the Alleghanies southward to North Carolina. 
 Farther south it is replaced by the closely allied Carolina 
 Chickadee. 

Throughout the greater part of its range the Chickadee 
 is found at all seasons, but it is less common in the middle 
 and southern Xew England States in summer than in win- 
 ter, and is most numerous during its migration in October. 

It is with winter that these merry little black and 
 white midgets are generally associated. Their tameness, 
 quaint notes, and friendly ways make them unusually com- 
 panionable birds ; one need not lack for society when 
 Chickadees are to be found. Many of their notes are 
 especially conversational in character, and in addition to 
 the familiar chirl'adee call, they have a high, sweet, 
 plaintive two- or three-noted whistle. 

The Chickadee nests about the middle of May, select- 
 ing some suita])le cavity or making one for himself in a 
 decayed trunk or limb and lining it with moss, plant- 
 down, and feathers. The eggs, five to eight in number, 
 arc white, spotted and speckled, chiefiy at the larger end, 
 with cinnamon or reddish brown.
