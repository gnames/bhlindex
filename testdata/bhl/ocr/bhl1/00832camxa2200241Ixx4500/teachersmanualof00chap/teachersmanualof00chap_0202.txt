 with a black forehead, reddish brown sides, and a con- 
 spicuous crest. Its usual call is a whistled peto, jpeto^

 Sitta caroLinensis. sliort and square and is not used in 

Plate LXXI. chmbing. The bill is rather slender, 
 but proves an effective instrument in removing insects' 
 eggs and larvae from crevices in the bark and even in 
 excavating a nesting hole in some decayed limb. Several 
 species also use it to crack or " hatch " nuts after they 
 have wedged them in a convenient crevice. 

Of the three species of Nuthatches found in eastern 
 North America the White-breasted is the most common 
 and generally distributed, being a permanent resident from 
 Florida to northern New England. Like many resident 
 birds, it nests early, the five to eight eggs being depos- 
 ited about April 20. They are white, thickly and 
 evenly spotted and speckled with reddish brown and 
 lavender.
