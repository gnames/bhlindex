somewhat faltering notes, and ending with a short, rapid, 
 rather explosive warble. 

The Ruby-crowned Kinglet is a more northern bird 
 in summer and a more southern bird in winter than the 
 Golden-crown, rarely being found at the latter season north 
 of South Carolina. Throughout the Middle States it oc-

 shreds of flesh ; still, the bird's song is not only surpass- 
 ingly sweet, varied, and sustained, but is possessed of suf- 
 ficient volume to be heard at a distance of two hundred 
 yards. Fortunately, the Ruby-crown sings both on its 
 spring and fall migrations.

On the basis of certain details of structure Thrushes 
 are generally assigned highest rank in the class Aves. 
 "Without pausing to discuss the value of the characters on 
 which this classification is made, there can be no question 
 that from an aesthetic standpoint the Thrushes possess in 
 a greater dec;ree than any other birds those qualifications 
 which make the ideal bird. There are many birds with
