brifjhtcr plnman^e, more strikinp^ voices, and more inter- 
 esting liahits, l)ut there are none whose bearing is more dis- 
 tinguislied, whose songs are more spiritual. The brilUant 
 IIummingV)irds and Tanagers excite our admiration, l)ut 
 the gentle, retiring Thruslies appeal to our higher emo-

Five of the true Thrushes of the genus Turdus are 
 found in eastern North America. Three of them may 
 be mentioned here — the Veery, Wood Thrush, and Her- 
 mit Thrush — a peerless trio of songsters. The Yeery's 
 mysterious voice vibrates through the air in pulsating 
 circles of song, like the strains of an ^olian harp. The 
 Wood Thrush's notes are rinorino^ and bell-like; he sounds

 birds are abundant, and a brief account of their haunts 
 and habits will enable any one to find them.

 America, and nests from northern Illinois and northern 
 ygg_ Kew Jersey northward to Manitoba and 

Turdus fuMceAcens. Newfoundland and southward along the 
 Plate LXXiii. Alleghanies to North Carolina. It comes 
 to us in the spring, about May 1, and remains until Sep- 
 tember 15. Near the middle of Mav it beo:ins to build its 
 nest, placing it on or near the ground. Its eggs are 
 greenish blue, and resemble in color those of the Wood 
 Thrush, but are slightly smaller. 

The Yeery's favorite haunts are low, damp woods 
 with an abundant undergrowth. It is a more retiring 
 bird than the Wcjod Thrush, and is rarely seen far from 
 tracts of woodland. It is to be distinguished from our 
 other Thrushes by the uniform cinnamon color of its
