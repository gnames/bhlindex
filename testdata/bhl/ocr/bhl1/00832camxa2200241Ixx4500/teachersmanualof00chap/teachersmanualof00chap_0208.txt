186 ROBIN. 

It seems a long step from these gentle, refined 

Thrushes to their comparatively prosaic cousin, the famil-

Plate Lxxxix. quite as effective as the Hermit's 

hymn in June. 

During the summer Robins are distributed through- 
 out ^N'orth America from the Gulf States and southern 
 end of the Mexican tableland, northward to Labrador and 
 Alaska. In the winter they may be found in numbers 
 from Virginia southward, small flocks and single birds 
 being occasionally met with as far north as Massachu- 
 setts. Robins are among our earliest migrants, appear- 
 ing in the vicinity of New York city between February 
 20 and March 1. Nesting is begun about April 15, the 
 mud-lined nest and greenish blue eggs being too well 
 known to require description. Two, or even three broods 
 may be raised. In June, the young of the first brood 
 with some adult males resort each night to a chosen 
 roost, often frequented by many thousands of birds. 

The fall migration begins in September, but the birds 
 are with us in roving bands until December. 

About the time that we first hear the Robin's ringing 

welcome to spring we may listen for the Bluebird's more

north as southern Connecticut, often living near groves 
 of cedars, which offer them both food and shelter. In 
 the Southern States they are far more abundant at this 
 season, gathering in flocks containing hundreds of indi- 
 viduals. 

The Bluebird is the first of our smaller birds to begin 
 housekeeping, and early in April it may be seen pro- 
 specting about the site of last year's nest in a bird box or
