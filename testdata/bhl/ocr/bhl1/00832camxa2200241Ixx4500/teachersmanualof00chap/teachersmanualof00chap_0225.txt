Identification (see Chapter YII). â€” As a prelimi- 
 nary step to exercises in identification the student 
 should learn to name the parts of a bird's plumage 
 as they are given in Figure 25. The teacher should 
 then select a plate of a land-bird, and placing it at 
 a distance of from twenty to thirty feet from the 
 pupil, have him write a one-minute description of it. 
 This description should include the bird's approxi- 
 mate length, "'^ color of crown, back, tail, wings, 
 throat, breast, and abdomen. It is well to have 
 a blank prepared and ready to fill in with the 
 descriptions of the parts named. To this may 
 be added any particular characters of form {e. //., 
 crests, long tail, etc.) or color {e. g., face or rump 
 marks, etc.). 

With this description in hand the student should 
 then turn to the key on page TG. This is primaril}^ 
 designed to identify birds in Nature, and its major 
 divisions are based on the most striking habits of the 
 birds. This, however, would not be appreciable in 
 the bird plate, and the teacher should, therefore, 
 designate in which of the three principal groui)s the 
 bird belongs. The pupil should then proceed with 

* A Kobin is ten inches, an English or TIousc Sparrow six and 
 one-quarter inches, in length. IMcntal comparison with cither of 
 these familiar birds will enable one to readily estimate the length 
 of any of our Passercs.
