PERMANENT RESIDENTS. 

Permanent Eesident species are those which are 
 represented in the same locahty throughout the 
 year. This does not imply that the same individuals 
 live in one locahty continuously ; few of our birds 
 being Permanent Kesidents in the strict sense of the 
 word. Doubtless, Puffed Grouse, Bob- whites, and 
 possibly a few other species pass their lives in the 
 vicinity of their birth ; but most species ranked as 
 Permanent Pesidents are, in fact, more or less mi- 
 gratory. Thus, in the vicinity of New York cit}^, 
 Chickadees and Bluebirds are found every month 
 of the year ; but in October, many migrants of both 
 species may be seen, and it is probable that Ave then 
 receive our Winter Pesidents of these species, while 
 the birds that were with us during the summer go 
 farther south to pass the winter.
