TRANSIENT VISITANTS. 

This group includes species which pass us each 
 spring in going to their more northern nesting 
 grounds, and which visit us again in the fall in 
 returning to their more southern winter homes. 

The earlier Transient Yisitants — for example, "Wil- 
 son's Snipe and the Fox Sparrow — may remain 
 with us a month or six weeks should the season be 
 backward, but the later arrivals — for instance, the 
 "Warblers of May, who arrive when the weather is 
 comparatively settled — pass us in a week or ten days. 

Most of our Transient Visitants are Ducks, Geese, 
 Snipe, and Plover, who travel far northward beyond 
 the haunt of man to breed in security ; and Warblers 
 and Thrushes, who nest in the great spruce and 
 balsam forests of northern ^N'ew England and 
 Canada.
