SUMMER RESIDENTS. 

The term Summer Eesident is applied to those 
 species which come to us from the south in the 
 spring, rear their young, and return to the south 
 in the fall. Summer Eesidents, therefore, are pres- 
 ent not only during the summer months, but may 
 arrive in late February or early March, and remain 
 until late November or early December. 

As a rule, the first species to come in the spring 
 are the last to leave in the fall, wliile the later 
 arrivals are among the first departures. 

Species that come in March or early April are 

â™¦Not common.
