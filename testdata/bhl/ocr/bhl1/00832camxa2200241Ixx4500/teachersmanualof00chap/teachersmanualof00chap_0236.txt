14 THE BIRD-LIFE OF A YEAR. 

Red- winged Blackbird, birds which pass the winter 
 such a short distance south of us that they appear 
 at the first sign of returning spring. 

Further confidence in the growth of the new year 
 is shown by the Great Horned Owl, one of our less 
 common species, who begins nesting late in February 
 or early in March. 

But in spite of these movements among the birds, 
 February is, generally speaking, a winter month, 
 and it is only in exceptional years that we shall find 
 much change in our avifauna.

While March is sure to witness ^ general north- 
 ward movement among the birds, the date of their 
 arrival is as uncertain as the weather of the month 
 itself. Continued severe weather jorevents their ad- 
 vance, which a higher temperature as surely occa- 
 sions. It is well, therefore, to watch closely the 
 weather predictions, knowing that birds will quickl}^
