THE BIRD-LIFE OF A YEAR. 15 

follow in the wake of a warm wave. When the 
 ice leaves our bays, ponds, and rivers, Ducks and 
 Geese will a])pear. Even before this event, the 
 Grackles, Ked- winged Blackbirds, and Robins will 
 come in flocks and in song, and singing will bec(jnie 
 general with the Song Sjmrrows and Bluebirds, 
 Avhose numbers will be greatly increased. When 
 successive thaws have rendered the earth soft enough 
 for the Woodcock's probe, we may expect to find 
 liim in favorable localities, searching for his fare 
 of earthworms. With the advent of insects, we 
 may look for their enemy, the Phoebe, and when 
 the frogs begin peeping in the ponds and marshes, 
 we shall know that the spring migration is well 
 under way, and that Meadowlarks, Cowbirds, and 
 other March Migrants may be found for the seeking. 

To the lover of bird music the event of the month 
 will be the first Fox Sparrow song; heard at this 
 season it is a thrilling performance. 

The weather which hastens the arrival of birds 
 from the south, also prompts certain of our Winter 
 Visitants to begin their northward journey, and 
 after March we do not often see Redpolls, Snow- 
 flakes, and Northern Shrikes.
