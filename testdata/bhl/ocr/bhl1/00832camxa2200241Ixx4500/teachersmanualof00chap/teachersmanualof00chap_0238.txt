In early April, the developments in the vegetable 
 world, which the most casual observer cannot fail to 
 see, are accompanied by corresponding, but less no- 
 ticed, activities in the world of birds. The appear- 
 ance of the skunk cabbage, the blossoming of the 
 pussywillow and early wild flowers soon become 
 common knowledge; but the arrival of the Yesper, 
 Field, and Chipping Sparrows; of Tree Swallows, 
 Myrtle "Warblers, and Hermit Thrushes, is 
 known to comparatively few. Still, to the bird- 
 lover, the return of these feathered friends is of even 
 greater interest than the blooming of trees and plants.
