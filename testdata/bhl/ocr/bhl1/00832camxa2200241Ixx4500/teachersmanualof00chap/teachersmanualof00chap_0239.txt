The migratory movement rapidly grows in 
 strength, and, during the latter part of the month, 
 one may expect to see new comers ahnost daily. 

It will be noted that the earlier migrants of the 
 month are aU seed-eaters, who return just in time to 
 help the remaining Winter Visitants harvest what is 
 left of the ^H-eceding year's crop of seeds. Later, 
 certain insectivorous birds which catch their prey 
 on the wing are found ; for example, the Swallows, 
 Swift, and Kighthawk.
