THE BIRD-LIFE OF A YEAR. 19 

conditions, and under the encouragement of a high 
 temperature we nuiy be visited l)y bird ''waves" 
 Avliieh flood the Avoods Avith migrants. Birds are 
 then, d()ul)tless, more alnnuhint than at any other 
 period of the year. As nuiny as ten species may be 
 noted as arriving on the same day, Avhile tlie num- 
 ber of individuals observed may ahnost exceed cal- 
 cuLation. At this season it is not unusual to observe 
 from sixty to eighty species of birds during a few 
 hours' outing, and Mr. W. L. DaAVSon records that, 
 with Prof. Lynds Jones of Oberlin College, he re- 
 corded twelve species of water birds and ninety 
 species of land birds in one day of field work in 
 LorAin County, Ohio. 

After the fifteenth of the month, birds begin to 
 decrease in number, the Transient Visitants passing 
 further north, and by June 5 our bird -life is com- 
 posed of Permanent Pesidents and Summer Pesi- 
 dents. 

It Avill be noticed that with few exceptions the 
 birds arriving in May are insectivorous ; particularly 
 those insect- eating birds which obtain their food 
 from tlie vegetation. Thus, no sooner are the un- 
 folding leaves and opening blossoms exposed to the 
 attack of insects than the Warblers and Yireos ap- 
 pear to protect them, and the abundance of these 
 small Ijirds is the distinctive feature of the bird-life 
 of the month. 

Their diminutive size, activity, and the persistence 
 Avith Avhich they remain in the tree-tops render their 
 identification in life by no means an easy matter, 
 and more than any of the other land birds they test 
 the patience of the field student.
