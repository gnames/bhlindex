THE BIRD-LIFE OF A YEAR. 23 

traits wliicli at other times of the year tliey give no 
 evidence of possessing. Singing now reaches its 
 highest development, and certain call-notes are 
 heard only at this season. The numl^erless actions 
 incident to courtshi]); the intelligence displayed in 
 nest- building; the choice of special food for the 
 young ; the devotion which prompts the parents 
 to recklessly expose themselves in the protection 
 of their offspring â€” all these manifestations of the 
 bird-mind may be observed in June. 

A feature of the bird-life of the month is the for- 
 mation, usually in young second-growth woods, of 
 roosts which are nightly frequented by the now 
 fully grown young of such early-breeding birds as 
 the Purple Grackle and Eobin. When a second 
 brood is raised, as with the Robin, the young of the 
 first brood may be accompanied to the roost by 
 the male parent, but in the one-brooded Grackle 
 the roost is used by both adults and young.
