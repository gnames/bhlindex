THE BIKD-LIFE OF A YEAR. 27

The student whose patience has been sorely tried 
 by the comparative scarcity of birds in August, will 
 find that in September his observations in the field 
 will be attended by far more interesting results. 
 The first marked fall in the temperature is sure to 
 be followed by a flight of migrants which, like the 
 " waves " of May, Avill flood the woods with birds. 
 The larger number will be Warblers; indeed, Sep- 
 tember, with May, is characterized by the abundance 
 of these small birds. 

Birds of the year will outnumber the adults, and, 
 in most cases, their plumage will be quite unlike that 
 w^orn by their ])arents in May, while, in many in- 
 stances, even the adults themselves will appear in a 
 changed costume. Often this new dress wall re- 
 semble that of the immature bird, a fact which 
 accounts for the apparent absence of old birds in 
 the fall migration. 

As a rule, fall plumages are less striking than those 
 of spring, and when, in addition, it is remembered 
 that birds are not in song, and that the foliage is 
 much denser, the greater difficulty of field identifi- 
 cation at this season Avill be appreciated. 

In September more migrating birds are killed by 
 striking lighthouses than in any other month of the 
 year. This is doubtless owing to the fact that 
 stormy or foggy weather is more apt to prevail in 
 September than during any other period of active 
 migration; that the majority of the migrants are 
 young and inexperienced, and that in September mi- 
 grants are more numerous than in any other month.
