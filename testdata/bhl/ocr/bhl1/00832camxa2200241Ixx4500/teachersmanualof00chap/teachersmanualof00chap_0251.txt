Early October generally brings the first killing 
 frost, de]iriving insectivorous birds of a large part 
 of their food, and of necessity forcing them to 
 journey southward. Flycatchers, Warblers, Yireos, 
 and Swallows now take their departure, and after 
 the fifteenth of the month few insect-eating birds 
 remain, except tliose which, like Woodpeckers, 
 feed on insects' larva3 or eggs. 

This is the season of Sparrows. In countless 
 numbers they throng old stubble, potato, or corn 
 fields, doing untold good by destroying the seeds 
 of noxious weeds. Song, Field, Chipping, and Ves- 
 per Sparrows may be found in flocks, all harvesting 
 the year's crop of seeds, and Avith them will be the 
 lately arrived Juncos, Tree and Fox Sparrows. 
 "When disturbed, they seek shelter in the nearest 
 hedgerow, and their mingled notes produce a twit- 
 tering chorus, in which it is difficult to distinguish 
 the voices of individual birds. 

This, however, Avill not be the only bird music 
 of the month. Certain species now have a brief
