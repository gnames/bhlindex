It is an interestino: fact that the last mio^raiits to 
 leave in the fall are the lirst to arrive in the spring. 

The bird-life of JS^ovember, when the fall migra- 
 tion is practically concluded, closely resembles, there- 
 fore, that of March, when the spring migration is 
 inaugurated. 

The reason for this similarity is to be found in 
 the fact that both months furnish birds with essen- 
 tially the same kind of food. Thus the Loon, Grebes, 
 Ducks, Geese, and Kingfisher remain until Xovem- 
 l)er or early December, when the forming of ice de- 
 prives them of food and forces them to seek open 
 water. A\7)odc()ck and Sni})e linger until they can 
 no longer prolje the frost-hardened earth; but the 
 thaws of March will bring all these birds back to us 
 l)y restoring their food.
