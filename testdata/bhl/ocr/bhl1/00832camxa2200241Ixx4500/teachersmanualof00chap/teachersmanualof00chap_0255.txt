THE BIRD-LIFE OF A YEAR. 33 

ground Ix^ unfrozen, and little or no snow fall, 
 many of the iniu^rant species of November will 
 linger into Deceiiihei-. They rarely are fcnind, 
 however, after tlie middle of the montli, wlicn our 
 bird-life is reduced to its sim])lest terms, l)cing com- 
 ]K)sed only of the ever-present Permanent Ilesidents 
 and the Winter Visitants. 

The comparative scarcity of food now forces lairds 
 to forage actively for provisions, and when a supply 
 is found they are apt to remain until it is exhausted. 
 Their Avanderino^s lead them over laro^e areas, and 
 our dooryards and orchards may often be visited 
 by species which, when food is more abundant, do 
 not leave their woodland haunts. An excellent 
 way in which to attract them is to provide them 
 with suitable food. Crumbs and seeds scattered in 
 some place where they will not be covered by snow, 
 or blown away, will bring Juncos, Tree Sparrows, 
 and Purple Finches ; an old seed-filled sunflower 
 head may prove a feast for Goldfinches, while bits 
 of meat, suet, or ham bone hung from trees will be 
 eagerly welcomed by Chickadees, Xuthatches, and 
 Downy "Woodpeckers.
