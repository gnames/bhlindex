SUBJECTIVE LESSONS.* 

Factors of Evolution (Chapter II, pages 14-16). — Give 
 examples illustrating the diversity shown in the structure 
 and habits of birds. What theory has been advanced to 
 account for the wide variation in structure shown by birds ? 
 What is meant by Natural Selection ? How does the 
 theory of Lamarck differ from that of Darwin ? How 
 may the tail-featliers of the Woodpecker have acquired 
 their present pointed shape ? Is it probable that the Wood- 
 l^ecker's barbed tongue has been acquired in the same 
 manner ? 

Form and Habit. 

The Wing (Chapter II, pages 17-24).— Name the func- 
 tions of the wing. What is doubtless its most primitive 
 use as an organ of locomotion ? How is it used by young 
 Gallinules ? By the young Hoatzin ? How is it used by 
 Grebes and Penguins ? By the Ostricli ? What variation 
 in expanse of wings is presented by birds ? What rela- 
 tion exists between shape of wing and style of flight ? 
 Give illustrations. Mention some flightless birds. Why 
 is flight necessary to the Razor-billed Auk ? Under what 
 conditions might it exist without the power of flight ? 
 What group of flightless birds is found in the Antarctic 
 region ? Where do they nest ? Why ? What birds be- 
 come temporarily flightless ? In what manner ? What 
 lake is inhabited by a flightless Grebe ? Where are flight- 
 less Gallinules found ? How did they probably reach the 
 islands they now inhabit ? Mention other flightless birds. 

* The value of these lessons will be great ly enhanced if the 
 teacher will constantly have the pupil name additional species in 
 illustration of the facts and theories here mentioned.
