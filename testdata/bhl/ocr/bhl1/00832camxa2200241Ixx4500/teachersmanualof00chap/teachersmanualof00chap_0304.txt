The Young (Chapter VI, page 70). — The mental and 
 physical growth of the Chicken forms an excellent and 
 practical lesson in the develoiDment of a young bird. A 
 newly hatched chick may be procured and placed in a 
 suitable cage in the class-room, where its actions and 
 plumage may be closely studied. Experiments may be 
 made, showing how little inherited knowledge the chick 
 possesses, by giving it bits of worsted, etc. , to eat, and ob- 
 serving how it learns what is and what is not edible, how 
 it does not instinctively recognize water, etc., and at the 
 same time notes should be kept of its changes in plumage.
