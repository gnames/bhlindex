" A. volume exceptionally well adapted to the requirements of people who wish to 
 study common birds in the simplest and most profitaole manner possible. ... As a 
 readily intelligible and authoritative guide this manual has qualities that will commend 
 it at once to the attention of the discerning student." — Boston Beaccn. 

" An interesting mass of data collected through years of study and observation. 
 . . . While accurate from a scientific point of view, it makes delightful reading for 
 those who will soon be among the flowers and the fields." — Philadelphia Inquirer. 

" A careful reading of this book, which is well inde.xed, will open the eyes of many 
 who have never seen the beauties of our birds before, and one can not help being in- 
 terested in the book. While the ornithologists owe Mr. Chapman a debt of gratitude 
 for putting forth such a delightful volume, the ordinary reader owes him more, bring- 
 ing, as he does, that reader in close touch with a new and beautiful world— the world 
 of birds. The book is decidedly charming from every point of view." — Cincinnati 
 Co)9iinercial Tribune. 

" Unusually beautiful in itself, but it deserves praise because the colored pictures of 
 the birds approach more nearly the natural appearance than usual. . . . Compared 
 with these, the colored pictures of birds one usually sees are gaudy." — Boston He7-ald. 

" His chronicles are full of the enthusiasm of the born naturalist. He gossips about 
 the affairs of birds in a delightful strain, making ' Bird-Life ' an irresistible invitation 
 to a fuller study of ornithology. It is not dry details he offers, but pretty storie.s, bio- 
 graphical sketches of interesting families — all sorts of birdlore, that proves the most 
 enchantmg reading. A great advantage in this work will be found in the beautifully 
 colored illustrations, . . . which have received the greatest care in preparation." — 
 Chicago Evening Post.
