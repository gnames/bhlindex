INTRODUCTORY NOTE BY W. K. BROOKS. 

As my name appears on the title-page of this Memoir as joint author, I take this opportunity to say that my 
 own share in the work has been that of instructor and director only. The investigations are the exclusive work of 
 Dr. K. P. Cowles, and while I have followed them in detail, and hold myself responsible for their soundness and 
 ace iracy, the credit for the research belongs to Doctor Cowles alone.
