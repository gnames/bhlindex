seem probable that this is the case for Phoronis architecta^ because full-sized adults arc found 
 throughout the year in Beaufort Harbor, and specimens were kept alive for fifteen months in the 
 laboratory of Johns Hopkins University. 

THE LAYING OF THE EGGS. 

During low tide in the summer and autumn it was easy to collect from loo to L50 specimens 
 of P/ioronis architecta during an hour or two. About one-half of these would usually have 
 male reproductive organs and the rest female reproductive organs. The Phoronis were placed 
 in glass crystallizing dishes and after about twenty -four hours many of the individuals began to 
 lay usually at night but the eggs were not retained among the tentacles in a mass, as described 
 by most investigators, hut were swept gently away from the lophophoral crown by the ciliation 
 on the tentacles and on the anal region, .so that they settled near by on the bottom of the dish. 
 Sometimes, however, the newly laid eggs were carried up and down the tentacles in currents 
 caused by the cilia, and occasionally a few eggs were found grouped near the tips of the tentacles, 
 being held there loosely by a small quantity of mucus-like material. At no time, however, were 
 eggs and larva' aggregated in definite masses, as described by Ikeda (9), nor were they brooded 
 among the tentacles, as Masterman (16) has observed in the case of Phoronis iusMi. That eggs 
 and embryos were not found by Longchamps among the tentacles of ''Phoronis d II> Igoland" is no 
 doubt due to the fact that the same habit prevails in the above form that does in Phoronis 
 architecta. 

While the adults were laying, they were examined under the compound microscope. They 
 showed large numbers of eggs which were floating freely back and forth in the body cavity as 
 the animal contracted and expanded. Sections of adults in this condition show that all these free 
 eggs contained the first polar body spindle. At intervals of about one minute an egg is extruded 
 with considerable force from the nephridial opening, and in no case do the eggs at this moment 
 have polar bodies. The wall of the nephridial ridge is transparent enough to see the eggs 
 as they slip through the larger part of the nephridium. While passing through, they are 
 pressed by the walls of the organ until they are about twice as long as broad (tig. 1). The fact 
 that Phoronis architecta does not keep its eggs in masses within the tentacular crown, together 
 with the fact that most of the individuals lay them at about the same time at night, makes 
 it possible to preserve any one stage in the development of the embryo in sufficient quantity for 
 a thorough study. 

FERTILIZATION. 

Ikeda (9) and Longchamps (12) made the observation that the eggs in the body cavity of the 
 parent showed the spindles of the first polar body. This I found to be the case in Phoronis 
 architecta (tig. 1). Eggs in the nephridia were found to be in the same stage, and in neither case 
 was there any sign of an entering spermatozoon or a male pronucleus (tig. 1). There is no doubt 
 of the fact that in Phonmix ///r/u'tecfa the spermatozoon does not enter the vgg until the latter 
 has been expelled from the nephridium. Ikeda observed this fact for Phoronis ijimai. 

SEGMENTATION. 

The eggs of Phoronis architecta while still in the body cavity are somewhat irregular in 
 shape, and. as mentioned above, are decidedly so while passing through the nephridium. 
 However, after they are laid they become almost perfectly spherical and average loo /< j n diam- 
 eter ("tig. L>). thus measuring the same as the egg of "P/toronis <h Naples." (Longchamps (12).) 
 The egg is very opaque, being heavily laden with small yolk granules. It is surrounded by a 
 delicate membrane, which, however, is not very conspicuous, being closely applied to the sur- 
 face, but after fertilization it separates to some extent (tig. !). 

Observations on the segmentation of the egg of Phoronis are conflicting. This part of the 
 development of Phoronis seems to have been treated hastily by most observers, probably 
 because it is difficult to obtain sufficient material for its study. It is agreed that the segmenta- 
 tion is total. Foettinger (5) and F. Schultz C2L) claim that the segmentation is unequal.
