proliferated from the anterior end of the archenteron, and the power "f producing the same 
 seems to diminish gradually toward the posterior end of the blastopore lips in those gastrula 
 where the round blastopore is just beginning to close up (figs. li </. I>. e, d, e,f). 

The mesoderm cells are \ ei'y amoeboid in character and are often seen in living specimens and 
 sometimes in sections sending out long pseudopod-like prolongations, which become attached to 
 the walls of the gastrula. l'>\ means of these amoeboid movements thej are able to crawl up the 
 walls of the blastocoele. 

We were unable to make out any structure in Phoronis architecta which could be interpreted 
 as "archenteric diverticula," such as figured by Caldwell (3a) and [keda (9). Fig. 16c might be 
 interpreted as showing these diverticula, but the condition there is hardly different from the 
 arrangement of the mesoderm cells, which are being pushed out into the blastocoele in front of 
 the blastopore (figs. L6, !'>/'). Caldwell first observed these structures in the gastrulse of Pho- 
 ronis kowalevskii, hut Lone-champs (12), who has recently carefully' studied the same species, has 
 been unable to rind them. Ikeda (9), however, rinds very definite diverticula in the gastrulse of 
 Phoronis ijimai, but he figures them as being in the region of the blastopore, while, according 
 to Caldwell's (3a) figures, they are found posterior to the blastopore. 

Let us return again to the mesoderm cells which lie anteriorly to the blastopore. These 
 amoeboid cells undoubtedly multiply while in the blastocoele, and in a gastrula where the blasto- 
 pore lips have closed up somewhat so as to give an oval outline to the blastopore (tie-. 18/) these 
 cells have become arranged into a definite sac (figs. 19, 20a), which i- later to form the lining of 
 the preoral lobe. In no case were we able to find the least indication of an anterior unpaired diver- 
 ticulum, which Masterman (Hi) says exists in the gastrula of l'h<>r<>nis l>uskii. At this stage 
 the cavity of the sac is small and is present only in front of the blastopore. The walls, however, 
 are extended on each side into a lateral cord of mesoderm cells, which lies in the blastocoele at the 
 side of the blastopore (fig. is/'). Some of the cells of the dorsal wall of the sac send out pseu- 
 dopodia, which attach themselves to an ectodermal thickening, and this thickening will become 
 the ganglion of the Actinotrocha (tig. L9). 

The above condition continues until the oval blastopore becomes smaller and round in outline 
 (figs. 20, 20< ). which change is also accompanied by further growth of the enteron in a posterior 
 direction until it almost touches the end of the larva. The cells of the two lateral cords of 
 mesoderm have now increased in number, have arranged themselves so a- to inclose a cavity, 
 continuous with the cavity of the anterior one described above, and have become attached both 
 to the lateral ectodermal wall and the lateral endodermal wall (tig. 205). Anteriorly this sac, 
 which is now horseshoe shape (tig. 20e), is still only attached to the ganglionic thickening and 
 the ventral ectodermal wall (tig. 20). The conditions just described are not due to the shrinkage 
 of the mesodermal lining away from the wall of the larva, for the transparency of the living 
 larva makes it possible to see the formation of the mesodermal sac. We have followed this 
 formation step by step many times in the living gastrula and larva, as well as in sections and 
 surface mounts. 

As tlie anterior end of the larva bends farther ventrally and becomes a definite preoral lobe, 
 the round blastopore assumes the shape of an oval with its major axis transverse to the long axis 
 of the larva (tig. -_'l). The posterior part of the larva increases in length and the enteron sends 
 out a posterior diverticulum, the beginning of the intestinal canal, whose blind end fuses with 
 the ectoderm of the posterior end of the larva. The walls of the mesodermal sac become applied 
 to the walls of the preoral lobe more generally, thus forming a definite mesodermal epithelium 
 lor the cavity of the preoral lobe digs. _':;. 21, 22). Posteriorly, as Masterman ( 1."-) ha- described 
 for the fully developed Actinotrocha, the cavity is produced "into two horn- running back 
 laterally" (rig. 22a), but as yet there is no complete mesodermal lining in the cavity back of this 
 (figs. _'_' I. c). The posterior wall of the mesodermal lining of the preoral lobe forms a definite 
 septum (figs. 21, 21a), but it is not as yet, at least, composed of two layer-, a- Masterman finds 
 in the older Actinotrocha.
