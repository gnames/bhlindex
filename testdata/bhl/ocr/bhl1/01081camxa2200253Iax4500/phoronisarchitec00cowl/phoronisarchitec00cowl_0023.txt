resultant du dedoublemenl de I'orifice primitif el median, tandis que le restant du diverticule 
 ectoblastique deviendrait la cavity post^rieure du corps." 

Such an origin for this posterior cavity would seem to be a possible one and would give an 
 easy explanation for the origin of the collar trunk and ventral mesenteries. 

We believe thai the cavity of the (funk is formed in the following manner: As the tentacles 
 grow out and increase in number the posterior region of the larva about the rectum increases 
 greatly in length. In doing the latter the mesodermal lining of the collar is drawn away from 
 the somatic wall in the region hack' of the tentacular hand, and a cavity is left containing the rec- 
 tum, part of the stomach, and the proximal part of the nephridial diverticula. At the same time 
 (his is taking place certain cells which seem to arise from the base of the nephridial diverticula 
 give rise to the lining of the cavity of the trunk. As to the manner of origin of these cells 
 we are still in doubt. We have not found two coelomic sacs which Hatschek (8) seems to have 
 figured (it is possible that his figure is meant to represent a single sac cut at two places), 
 and we have hunted for them in larva' where the diverticula are just beginning to form and 
 also in larvae with two, four, and six tentacles. In one specimen with two tentacles, however 
 (fig. 30), an arrangement of mesodermal cells on the dorsal side of the intestine which seems 
 to he the beginning of a sac is found; this, however, is not paired. Whether or not this sac 
 and its cavity eive rise to the lining and cavity of the trunk we can not say, for we have found 
 hut one specimen in which this condition exists. 

One thing is certain, the fully developed trunk cavity of the Actlnotroc/ut has a distinct 
 mesodermal lining, consisting of a somatic and a splanchnic layer. As far as we know all Actino- 
 trochst have a ventral mesentery, which tends to support the view that the lining of the cavity 
 of the trunk has its origin in a sac which grows around the rectum and posterior part of the 
 stomach. Whether or not the fact that there is an indication of a dorsal mesentery in the pos- 
 terior region of some of the fully developed Actinotrochse, Species B., has any bearing on the 
 double origin of the cavity of the trunk we can not say. for we have never seen the very young 
 larva' of this form. 

The youngest larva taken from the tow had three pairs of tentacles, with beginnings of the 
 fourth pair. In this larva the tentacles had grown considerably in length, and the posterior 
 region had become somewhat elongated (tig. 31). Only one specimen of this age was obtained, 
 and it was only studied while alive. The mesentery between the collar and lobe was plainly 
 seen, and there seemed to be a thin mesentery between the region of the collar and the younger 
 trunk region. The nephridial canals were seen with difficulty, but the rounded bunches of 
 excretory cells forming the internal ends of the canals were plainly visible. 

When the larva of Phoronis wrchitecta has five pairs of tentacles (fig. 32) the trunk region is 
 elongated considerably and constitutes about one-half the length of the larva. In fact, the larva 
 at this stage looks much like the fully developed Actinotrocha. The 'retractors" described by 
 Lkeda (9) are now present and the body wall in the anal region shows a thickening which is to 
 become the perianal ciliated band. This larva shows clearly the presence of two mesenteries. 

In the larva with six pairs of tentacles (fig. 33) all of the organs of the fully developed 
 Actinotrocha are present. The ventral pouch begins to invaginate (tig. 33) and sections usually 
 show that the blood corpuscle masses are forming. 

FULLY DEVELOPED ACTINOTROCHA. 

There are two species of Actinotrocha found in the waters of Beaufort Harbor, and they are 
 very similar, if not identical, with the two species that E. B. Wilson (24) observed in Chesapeake 
 Bay. l'n mi the latter part of May until the latter part of September both species are fairly 
 abundant in the tow 7 . 

Wilson has designated the two species found in Chesapeake Hay as Species A. and Species 
 B., anfl because of the general agreement between our observations and his descriptions the 
 Beaufort Actinotrochse will be designated as Species A. and B., although we are satisfied that 
 Species A. is the larva of P. architecia.
