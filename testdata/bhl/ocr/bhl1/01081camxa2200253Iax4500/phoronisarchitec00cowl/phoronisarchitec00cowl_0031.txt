posteriorly, these fibres become massed into definite muscle tracts, aboul halfway back from the 
 vestibule to the ventral insertion of collar trunk mesentery (figs. Il<. t4rf). These two ventral 
 longitudinal tracts, which arc bilaterally placed one on each side of the ventral median line, 
 become separated, in most cases al least, from the ventral body wall in the region of the posterior 
 pair of blood corpuscle masses and the latter become rather closely associated with them (fig. 4tl). 
 We could not discover that these fibres were in any way related to the nephridia as has been 
 described for some specie-. 

In the region of the insertion of the ventral tentacles the muscle fibres of the ventral tracts 
 become again applied to the ventral body wall, hut definite tracts are no longer present. How- 
 ever, in the trunk region these fibres form a definite tract, which is confined to the ventral body 
 wall, and it does not disappear until the perianal ring is reached (ties. 44 <j, /*, i). 

Another tract of muscle fibres present in species B., which does not seem to be developed in 
 other Aebinotirochm, judging from existing descriptions, is that found in the region of the bases 
 of the tentacles. From the dorsal muscle tracts, where the most dorsal and anterior pair of 
 tentacles arises, muscle fibres are given off, which follow the bases of the tentacles and which 
 form a well-developed ring of muscle fibres. In other words, there is a ring of muscle fibres 
 which follows the line of insertion of the mesentery between the collar and trunk cavities 
 (fig.Me). 

A tract of muscle fibres, which also seems to occur only in Species B., is one composed of 
 only a few fibres, which are found running around the edge of the hood on the internal wall of 
 the same (tigs. 44 ', b). Where the edge of the hood passes into the wall of the collar cavity 
 these fibres arc seen to run on to the internal surface of the lateral wall of the collar and to 
 mingle finally with the fibres of the dorsal tract. The direction these fibres take w T hen they pass 
 on to the wall of the collar reminds one very much of the fibres which Masterman (15) figured as 
 nerve fibres. 

On the internal ventral surface of the hood in both species of Actinotrochse there is a system 
 of muscle fibres arranged concentrically. The3 r run almost parallel with one another and with 
 the edge of the hood (tigs. 47 and 44^). 

Beside the tracts of muscle fibres which have been described there are, lining the walls of the 
 collar and trunk, circular muscle fibres lying between the longitudinal muscle fibres and the 
 ectoderm. These have been generally observed by previous workers as have also the muscular 
 covering of the ventral pouch and the muscle cells of the dorsal blood vessels. 

Body cavities, mesenteries, etc. Much difference of opinion exists as to the origin and limits 
 of the body cavities in the Actinotrocha and also as to the value of these cavities in determining 
 the phylogenetic history of Phoronis. 

Koule (20) stands alone in considering the Actinotrocha to have but one body cavity, which 
 is lined by an epithelium formed from mesenchymatous cells. He absolutely denies the presence 
 of any mesenteries. 

Through the kindness of Mr. Longchamps we have been able to study the Actinotrocha of 
 Phoronis sabatieri, and have found that the mesentery between the collar and trunk is present, 
 although it is less highly developed than in other species. We are unable, with the material at 
 hand, to give any opinion as to the presence of a mesentery between the preoral lobe and collar 
 cavities. 

Caldwell (3) claims that there are but two body cavities, and that these are separated by a 
 mesentery (collar-trunk mesentery of Masterman). 

Longchamps i L2) is inclined toward the view of Caldwell, while Ikeda (!) finds the mesentery 
 dividing the lobe and collar, which, however, he says, is incomplete. Both of these investigators 
 recognize the presence of the ventral mesentery. 

Menon (17) finds three body cavities (preoral. collar, and trunk), a ventral mesentery, and 
 indications of a dorsal mesentery in the trunk. 

Masterman (16) considers that the Actinotrocha have live body cavities an unpaired lobe 
 cavity, a paired collar cavity, and a paired trunk cavity. This idea is based on his study of the
