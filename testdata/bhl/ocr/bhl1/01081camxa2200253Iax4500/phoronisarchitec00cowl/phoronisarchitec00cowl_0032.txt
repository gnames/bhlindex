early development of the body cavities and not on the adult organization of the Actinotrocka, 
 for in the collar he finds only :i dorsal mesentery (no other investigator has seen this), and in the 
 trunk only a ventral mesentery. 

While it is possible that the mesoderm arises as diverticula from the enteron, as Caldwell 
 and Masterman have described, yet Longchamps (12), who lias recently reinvestigated the early 
 embryology of the form that Caldwell worked on {Phqronis kowalevsMi), denies the origin of the 
 cavity in front of the collar trunk mesentery from enteric diverticula. Ikeda (!). who recognizes 
 the anterior diverticula" of Caldwell in the Japanese species, nevertheless holds that the body 
 cavities do not arise from anterior diverticula, but are simply produced by mesoblast cells apply- 
 ing themselves to and forming the lining of the ectoblastic and entoblastic wall. 

In the section on the mesoderm we have stated that in the embryo of Phoronis architt <-i<i we do 
 not find that the mesoderm arises from enteric diverticula. There can not be the least doubt, 
 however, that the preoral lobe at an early stage becomes lined by a sac of mesoderm cells and 
 that the wall of this sac gives rise to the mesentery. Furthermore, this sac is extended postero- 
 lateral^ into two horns which are characteristic of the cavity of the preoral lobe, according to 
 Masterman, Ikeda, and Menon. It must be admitted, however, that this sac does not seem to 
 retain its character as a sac. but that the cells become separated and apply themselves here and 
 there to the walls of the preoral lobe. The mesentery remains intact and can not be considered 
 as a secondary structure as has been suggested by Longchamps. Although we agree with Ikeda's 
 statement that the mesentery between the lobe and the collar is incomplete laterally in the fully 
 developed Actinotrocka, yet in the Actinotrocka of Phoronis arckitecta, at least, it must be 
 considered as a definite mesentery. 

The fully formed Actinotrockse (Species A. and Species B.) do not show a complete epithe- 
 lial lining to the preoral lobe, but the mesoderm cells are arranged as described in the young 
 larva. 

It is stated above in the part on the mesoderm that we do not find that the lining of the collar 
 cavity is of enteroccelic origin in Phoronis architects. However, in the fully formed Actino- 
 trocha there is an undoubted mesodermic ephithelium lining the somatic wall. This layer is very 
 conspicuous immediately before metamorphosis, because it becomes separated from the somatic 
 wall prior to becoming transformed into the ring vessel of the adult (tigs. 51 </, 51//). 

The splanchnic wall of the collar cavity in the Actinotrochse that we have examined is devoid 
 of a mesodermal lining, and the occurrence of mesoderm cells on the wall is very infrequent. 
 This condition of affairs in the well-developed Actinotrocka is what one would expect from the 
 disposition of the mesoderm cells in the very young larvae of Phoronis architecta, where it is 
 only very seldom that any are found on the stomach wall (tig. 24). 

The absence of a mesodermal lining on the splanchnic wall of the collar cavity is made all 
 the more evident by the examination of cross sections showing the collar-trunk mesentery 
 (tigs. 51<7, 51//). When the mesentery reaches the stomach wall, instead of dividing into two 
 layers, one of which would be continued into the mesodermal lining of the stomach wall of 
 the collar cavity, it turns abruptly upon itself and becomes the lining of the stomach wall 
 of the trunk. We have never found the least indication in the collar cavity of a dorsal mesentery 
 such as Masterman (15) has described in the Actinotrocka from St. Andrews Bay. The trunk 
 cavity is lined throughout by a sac of mesodermal epithelium, and the mesentery is plainly seen 
 to be continuous with the lining of the somatic wall and with the lining of the wall of the gut. 
 The ventral mesentery of the trunk is present in Species A. and Species B., and while there 
 is no dorsal mesentery we have found indications of it in two specimens only (Species B.) at the 
 posterior end of the trunk. We can not say, however, that it has any ontogenetic significance 
 ( lies. 4.x, 44;, 44//). We have also found the ventral mesentery to be present in the Actinotrocka of 
 J 'I,, i, <m is saiatu ri. 

The ventral pouch fills a large part of the trunk cavity in the fully formed Actinotrocka, and 
 just before metamorphosis it frequently pushes the collar trunk mesentery well forward into the 
 collar cavity, thus making the study of the relation of the different parts quite difficult. Both
