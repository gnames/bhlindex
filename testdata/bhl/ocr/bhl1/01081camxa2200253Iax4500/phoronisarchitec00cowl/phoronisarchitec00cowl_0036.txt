present there are no mesodermal masses. In this exception small blood-corpuscle masses were 
 round applied to the stomach wall, and masses of cells bilaterally placed were found on the 
 ventral somatic wall, but these colls had already taken on the character of blood corpuscles. 

Ikeda (9) has described a "mesoblastic cell mass"" which he evidently considers as giving 
 rise to the adult body cavity, and its position is very similar to that of the mesoblastic masses 
 described above. They are both products of the mesoblastic lining of the ventral somatic wall 
 and are situated between the plane of the bases of the tentacles and the plane of the somatic 
 insertion of the mesentery between the collar and trunk. Although Ikeda docs not touch upon 
 the very early origin of the adult body cavity, yet it seems probable that he considers it as arising 
 from a single mass of cells. The mesoblastic masses described above are paired and bilaterallv 
 placed, and they are present only in the young larva of 12 or 11 tentacles. Furthermore, in 
 the larva with L2 or 11 tentacles there is no sign of the beginning of the adult body cavity. 
 Although these mesodermal masses which, according to our observations, give rise to the blood 
 corpuscles have a similar position to the fundament of the young adult body cavity, yet we are 
 convinced that they do not give rise to it. 

In Species A. there is no intimate relation between the masses of blood corpuscles and the 
 uephridia. such as has been described by Masterman (15) for the species from St. Andrews Bay. 
 and by Longchamps (12) for Actinotrocha branchiata. In the larva of L6 tentacles the blood-cor- 
 puscle masses are, however, closely applied to the stomach wall in the region of the digestive 
 area. There is no mesodermal epithelium covering that part of the surface of the stomach which 
 lies within the collar cavity, and the blood corpuscles seem to be so intimately related to the 
 digestive areas that we are inclined to believe that they receive nourishment from them. 

While the blood corpuscles vary in size and undoubtedly multiply by karyokinetic division, 
 yet we have never found the ''large and somewhat coarsely granular" and the 'smaller finely 
 granular" corpuscles that Ikeda (9) speaks of, nor in this species have we found any "gigantic 
 mesoderm cells'-' in the region of the blood-corpuscle masses. Very large cells in close relation 
 to the blood corpuscle hkhmn are found in some specimens of Arfiimtiuicha Species B. (tig. 44/'). 
 These cells resemble the cells described in the old gastrula of Species A. as arising from the wall 
 of the archenteron, only they are not as coarsely granular as the latter. While in Actinotrocha 
 Species B. the cells are found in most cases closely associated with the blood corpuscles, we have 
 never seen them in the process of division and do not believe that they give rise to blood 
 corpuscles. Their occurrence is quite variable, hut as far as has been observed they are not 
 present in the Actinotrocha which are ready to metamorphose. They are not phagocytes, nor are 
 they pigment cells, and the only name which we feel justified in giving them is large free 
 mesoderm cells. Frequently they are also found in the posterior end of the trunk cavity (tig. 44/'). 

Roule (20) holds that the nephridia end internally at the level of the oesophagus, and he 
 shows this in a figure. We have made cross sections through this region and have found masses 
 of cells in much the same place as Roule has shown. These cells seem to be blood corpuscles. 
 but very few specimens have been examined, and only one of these showed these masses of cells. 

Rudiment of tin "adult collar cavity" (Ikeda). Ikeda has observed a mesodermal cell mass 
 on the ventral somatic wall just under the second tentacle in rather young specimens of all the 
 Japanese Actinotrochae. He has traced the development of this mass of cells and finds that a 
 cavity arises in it which, before metamorphosis, becomes quite spacious ami extends into the 
 tentacles. We are able toconlirm Ikeda's view that this cavity istherudimentof the " adult collar 
 cavity," or "supraseptal cavity" of the adult, as it is usually called (tigs. 50, 48, 51A, 455, 4>). 

METAMORPHOSIS. 

Several investigators have carefully described the external characteristics of the metamor- 
 phosis of the Actinotrocha, so it is unnecessary to enter into a detailed description. 

Wilson (24) studied the metamorphosis of Actinotrocha?. Species A. and Species B., which are 
 found in Chesapeake Bay, but he did not cut sections of his material. Ikeda (9), however, has 
 investigated the internal changes which take place during metamorphosis and has added a vai-
