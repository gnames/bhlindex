 tions," is intended to embrace all the publications issued directly by 
 the Smithsonian Institution in octavo form; those in quarto constitut-

 edge. The octavo series is designed to contain reports on the present 
 state of our knowledge of particular branches of science; instructions 
 for collecting and digesting facts and materials for research ; lists and 
 synopses of species of the organic and inorganic world; reports of 
 explorations; aids to bibliographical investigations, etc., generally pre- 
 pared at Ihe express request of the Institution, and at its expense.

 present series, each article is separately paged. The actual date of its 
 publication is that given on its special title-page, and not that of the 
 volume in which it is placed. In many cases works have been pub- 
 lished aiid largely distribnlod, years 1)efore their combination into 
 volumes.
