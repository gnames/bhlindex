are deposited by the swift waters along the border of the main 
 channels while the finer superimposed strata are laid down in the 
 slack water on the inner margins of curves during flood stages, and 
 it is here that pieces of ice floating down on the spring floods be- 
 come stranded as the waters recede, and melting deposit any freight 
 in the shape of fragments of fossil bones, teeth, etc., that may be 
 frozen within or borne upon them. Below the level of flood these 
 bars present a surface of gravels, sands, and mud bare of vegetation 
 but strewn over with stumps, logs, and drift brush. Back of this 
 comes a strip covered with grasses and a variety of equisetum called 
 " goose-grass " because it forms the chief food of these birds during 
 their molting season. Above this belt comes a growth of young 
 willows which as they recede from the river increase to a height of 
 twenty to thirty feet. Mingled with the willows and replacing them 
 on the landward side are clumps of alders and groves of poplars 
 which in turn are succeeded on higher, better drained lands by 
 spruce forests extending away to mingle with the birch growing on 
 the distant hills. Below the depth of a foot or two the soil is 
 everywhere frozen. 

Above the Yukon Flats the Porcupine flows from a considerably 
 contracted valley called " the Ramparts." This is a name intro- 
 duced by the northern fur-traders to designate a contracted, walled, 
 or caiion-like valley and has been applied by them to similar physio- 
 graphic features on the Mackenzie, Porcupine, and Yukon, rivers. 
 On the Porcupine, Upper and Lower Ramparts are differentiated 
 and the portions of the valley so named are very picturesque. In 
 passing through the Ramparts the river contracts considerably, not 
 exceeding seventy-five yards in width in places. The current be- 
 comes more rapid, flowing from three to four and a half miles an 
 hour with occasional short riffles where the velocity is much greater, 
 being estimated at seven or eight miles per hour, but there are no 
 obstructions or rapids which would prevent a small light-draft 
 steamer with requisite power from navigating the river (plate i). 

The change in topography in ascending from the Yukon Flats 
 into the Lower Ramparts is ushered in gradually by a belt of Pleis- 
 tocene deposits several miles wide rising thirty to fifty feet above 
 the river, followed by several ranges of low hills leading up to the 
 abrupt walls of the entrance to the contracted portion of the valley. 
 The river flows through the Lower Ramparts for about twenty- 
 five miles. The rocky walls, generally disconnected and low, are 
 composed for the most part of limestones seldom abruptly developed 
 on both sides of the river so as to form a canon. Thus a shore is
