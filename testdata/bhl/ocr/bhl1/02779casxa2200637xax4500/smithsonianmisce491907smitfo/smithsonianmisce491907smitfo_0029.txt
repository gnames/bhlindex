Itinerary 15 

The course of the Old Crow River was ascended about one hun- 
 dred and seventy miles by following its winding series of incredible 
 and complicated curves, though the extreme point reached was 
 estimated to be not over half that distance from the mouth of the 
 river in a straight line. Along their southern margin the uncon- 
 solidated deposits that fill the Old Crow Basin present at first a 
 terrane such as is to be expected along the shore of a lake. Con- 
 siderable thicknesses of gravels and sands were noted for about 
 fifteen miles, until passing more towards the center of the basin 
 area the sediments changed to homogeneous gray clays in which 
 gravel was totally absent, and where only small quantities were occa- 
 sionally observed on the bars associated with fragments of fossil 
 mammal bones that have been deposited during spring floods by 
 floating ice from the headwaters of the river. As the course of the 
 river winds through these frozen silts it generally presents bold 
 escarpments along the concave sides of the curves, with muddy bars 
 overgrown by dense thickets of willows opposite. It is on the 
 tops of these high silt blufifs the beds of elevated ice are exposed 
 and their more recent relation to the silts themselves so clearly 
 demonstrated. 

These ice-beds are not extensive sheets covering large areas but 
 rather restricted masses, rarely exposing over one-half mile of con- 
 tinuous ice, that appear to be frozen ponds, ox-bow, or other lakes, 
 that remained in the low parts of the undulating surface of the lake 
 bottom when it was drained. As their mode of origin and forma- 
 tion will be discussed later we may pass them with the statement 
 that the Old Crow Basin presents this phase of elevated Pleistocene 
 silts with ice on top developed to a greater extent than the writer 
 has seen or read of anywhere else. Beds of ice were observed as 
 far as we were able to ascend the Old Crow River, They appeared 
 on top of the banks, always at elevations of one hundred or more 
 feet above the stream, for a distance of more than one hundred 
 miles along the stream and no doubt continue to the northern limit 
 of the basin. The ice varies greatly in color, structure and thick- 
 ness. Some is of a brownish hue having much the same color as 
 peat water and containing quantities of comminuted vegetable mat- 
 ter, in some parts distributed evenly through the mass, and at other 
 places concentrated in thin layers like sheets of paper between thick- 
 nesses of clear ice. Some is whitish and granular, especially at 
 its surface, and often contains numerous cavities of gas bubbles. 
 At other places masses of green and blue ice were observed. In some 
 exposures all three kinds of ice are associated within one hundred
