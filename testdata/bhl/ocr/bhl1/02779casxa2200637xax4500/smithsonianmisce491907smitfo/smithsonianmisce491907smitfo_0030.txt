 is only one criterion upon which to base a classification of the ice 
 deposits of these northern regions, and this is, position. 

During the first week of our ascent of the Old Crow the river 
 steadily subsided. As the waters became lower widely scattered 
 parts of the skeletons of the large fossil mammals we were search- 
 ing for, were left exposed on the clay banks below high water 
 mark. In this way several of the large leg bones of the mammoth 
 together with specimens of its teeth and bones of horse and bison 
 were picked up. About one mile above the mouth of the first tribu- 
 tary coming into the Old Crow from the left we found the badly 
 mutilated skull of a mammoth. It showed every evidence of 
 rough treatment by the ice of one or more spring break-ups. The 
 tusks were absent and their sockets badly broken away, the teeth 
 were gone, and it was clearly evident that this skull had come from 
 a considerable distance upstream. We left it on the water's edge 
 imbedded in the tenacious gray clay. When we returned to it a 
 week later on our way down stream it was covered by six feet of 
 water. For after leaving that spot on our way upstream we daily 
 experienced heavy rains, frequently accompanied by thunder, that 
 appeared to originate in the mountains surrounding this basin and 
 give that particular area the whole benefit of rainfall. In conse- 
 quence the country became inundated, caused the river to rise very 
 rapidly, and also increased the current so as to make upstream 
 progress slower. Finally on July 23 an inventory showed 
 about six pounds of flour, a couple of handfuls of tea with some 
 partly dried deer meat not in too savory a state of preservation, to 
 be the remaining stock of provision. This with the fact that 
 we were about four hundred miles from the nearest settlement. Fort 
 Yukon, determined us to turn back. It was with much reluctance 
 we did so for nearly every mile of the last one hundred travelled 
 on the Old Crow River had yielded increasing evidence, in the 
 shape of a tooth, a horn core, or a bone lying on the banks below 
 high-water mark, of the existence of deposits containing considera- 
 ble remains of the skeletons of large Pleistocene mammals. Every 
 mile of the last one hundred was travelled with the expectation of 
 discovering a place of primary entombment of these remains. 
 Under the circumstances it became necessary to abandon further 
 exploration with the hope of returning another year to fully in- 
 vestigate this locality. It was on this river the remains of mammoth 
 were reported to be abundant, and as we have just pointed out, all the
