Itinerary 17 

evidence coming under our observation leads to the conclusion that 
 an extensive deposit of large Pleistocene mammal remains, repre- 
 sented principally b}' mammoth, bison, and horse, exists on the 
 headv^aters of the Old Crow River. 

In 1873 Rev. Robert ^McDonald presented a collection of remains 
 of Pleistocene mammals to the British Museum. The locality given 
 for them is the Upper Porcupine River and it is probable a more 
 definite locality for this collection may be the Old Crow River, a 
 tributary of the Porcupine. They have been enumerated by Lydek- 
 ker in the Catalogue of Fossil Mammalia in the British Museum, 
 Part II, pages 26. 27, 39, 78, 86, and 87 ; Part iv, page 204. Leith- 
 Adams also mentions three left lower molars of the mammoth from 
 this collection in his work on British Fossil Elephants, page 117. 

Our return to Fort Yukon, by the same route we had ascended 
 the river, was accomplished in eight days, and beyond one mishap, 
 in which our canoe rolled over in a shallow riffle, that resulted in 
 the loss of two sacks of bones that were not lashed in the canoe, 
 together with some photographic plates that became wet, was accom- 
 panied by no extreme inconvenience. 

The journey down the Yukon River was continued to examine 
 other localities reported as productive of Pleistocene mammal re- 
 mains. This necessitated travelling by steamer and small boat al- 
 ternately. A locality about thirty miles below Fort Hamlin on the 
 right bank of the Yukon was visited as was also Little Minook Creek 
 near the town of Rampart where elevated fluvial sediments con- 
 taining scattered Pleistocene mammal remains occur. From Fort 
 Gibbon where the Tanana River joins the Yukon the trip was con- 
 tinued by small boat to give opportunity of stopping at the " Pali- 
 sades " or so-called " Bone-Yard " about thirty-five miles below. 

This locality is described by Russell,' later by Spurr,' and also by 
 Collier." 

The escarpment called the Palisades is from one hundred and 
 fifty to two hundred feet high, composed mostly of fine, light colored, 
 unstratified silts. Back from the bluff is a level, densely wooded 
 table land, with swamps and ponds, bordered on all sides, except 
 that adjacent to the river, by low hills. The Palisades proper are 
 washed by the river and are bare precipitous bluffs of frozen silt.
