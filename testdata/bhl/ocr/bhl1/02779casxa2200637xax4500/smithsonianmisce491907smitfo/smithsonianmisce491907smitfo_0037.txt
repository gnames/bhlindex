The Glacial Period and the Mammoth 23 

writer that in a museum maintained at the Hudson Bay Company's 
 post at Fort Simpson on the Mackenzie River he observed teeth of 
 the mammoth {E. primigcniiis). These specimens have no definite 
 locaHties assigned them, but it is presumed they were found in the 
 region of the lower Mackenzie Valley. 

In this connection it appears opportune to call attention to a 
 fact that apparently has been lost sight of by recent observers on the 
 ethnology of the Alaskan Eskimo. This is the use by these people 
 of a blue pigment derived from the decomposition of mammoth 
 tusks. Sir John Richardson makes a note of this in his work on the 
 Zoology of the Voyage of H. M. S. Herald, 1854; page 61, he says: 
 " Several of the mammoths' tusks also have exfoliated, and a beauti- 
 ful blue phosphate of iron has formed between their plates. This 
 is evidently the blue pigment used by the native tribes on the coasts 
 of Beering's Sea, and which has passed from tribe to tribe by barter 
 in small quantities as far as the banks of the Mackenzie. It is 
 mentioned by Cook, but its origin was unknown until now. Dr. 
 Davy had the kindness to analyze this substance at my request, and 
 he found that the first portions I sent to him were accompanied by 
 a greater proportion of carbonate of lime than a recent tusk should 
 contain. The iron may have been derived from the red gravel bed, 
 associated with the bones ;****** Having sent a second 
 specimen of a decaying tusk to Dr. Davy, he says, ' It is stained by 
 peroxide of iron without any phosphate. I cannot find in it any 
 mass of carbonate of lime. The proportion of animal matter in it 
 is large, sufficient to preserve the form of the fragment after the 
 removal of the phosphate of lime by an acid. Probably complicated 
 affinities are engaged in the production of the blue phosphate, and 
 carbonate of iron is concerned (not carbonate of lime). Perhaps 
 the protoxide of the carbonate may combine with the phosphoric 
 acid of the bone (ivory), and the carbonic acid of the former with 
 the lime of the latter ; the animal matter present in the bone in clay 
 preventing the higher degree of oxidation.' "

 the mammoth in Alaska it is well to note the facts in regard to its 
 geographic range and that of the great glaciers. I. C. Russell " is
