valleys widen into basin-like expanses there are typical lacustrine 
 deposits. They are made up of unconsolidated grayish colored 
 sands and clays sometimes underlain by gravel beds which appear 
 to be of contemporaneous age. These silts may usually be dif- 
 ferentiated from the Recent alluvium by their lighter color, which 
 also suggests their fluvio-glacial origin. As recognized and de- 
 scribed by observers the Pleistocene occurs as deposits of gravels, 
 sands, and clays distributed throughout the drainage basins. In 
 Alaska, as in Siberia, no inter-Glacial deposits appear to occur, and 
 the relations of the fluviatile and lacustrine deposits to the glacial 
 accumulations of the mountains, beyond the general fact that most 
 of the materials of the former are the down-stream residual of the 
 latter, cannot be stated at present.

The events that lead up to their deposition appear to have been 
 a period of general erosion, for the unconformable underlying sur- 
 faces of the older rocks are swept clean, and then a time of land de- 
 pression making transportation and deposition the chief work of the 
 rivers. This subsidence diminished the flow of the drainage, re- 
 ducing the current to such an extent as to form lakes where there 
 was room for them. Fluvial deposits were laid down along the 
 valleys and lacustrine silts in the expanded basins. Some of the 
 drainage courses were obstructed at intervals by elevations of the 
 older strata and others by flows of basalt that appear to rest directly 
 on the eroded surfaces of the older rocks, thus demonstrating their 
 age, though relatively young, to be older than the silts. In the 
 basins thus formed the finer silts were laid down, while in some 
 cases there appear to have been areas of relatively quiet water 
 caused by the channels through the extensive flood plains clogging 
 with sediment. Thus at the time the " Yukon Silts " and " Kowak 
 Clays " were forming, Alaska, for the most part, was a low-lying 
 country, characterized by enlarged rivers with slow drainage and 
 many lakes. The supply of water was abundant and the flood plains 
 extensive. The present valleys were the drainage channels for the 
 volumes of water that flowed from the great glaciers to the south 
 and east and from the local glaciers within its limits. All these 
 waters were highly charged with silt and the finer sediment was 
 carried far beyond the glaciated areas where today they lie deposited 
 in former lake basins and along the vallevs. 

The silts are from fifty to two hundred or more feet in thickness
