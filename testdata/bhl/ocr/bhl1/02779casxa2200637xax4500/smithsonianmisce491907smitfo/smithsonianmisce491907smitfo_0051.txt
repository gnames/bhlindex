Brief Outline of Pleistocene of Alaska 29 

Porcupine, beds of lignite occur interstratified showing a local 
 drainage or elevation of these basins in the course of their silting up 
 and then further subsidence and deposition. 

As noted by Spurr '" and Collier "' " The silts, though entirely 
 unconsolidated, are in places thrown up into broad, open folds, and 
 at one locality faulting was observed." 

4. snowdrift obstruction of drainage 

None of the facts as now exhibited in Alaska make it necessary 
 to resort to fanciful pictures of the flood plains of the drainage 
 systems being modified or obstructed by great accumulations of 
 winter snows, either to account for the lacustrine nature of the 
 Pleistocene silts themselves or for the deposits of ice found on top 
 of, but never interstratified with, them. Geikie "Â° refers to Darwin 
 as having suggested " that valleys might eventually become entirely 
 filled with the blown snows of successive years, so as to compel the 
 rivers in summer to rise in flood, and to reach levels which they 
 might otherwise have been unable to attain. That such changes 
 may have taken place again and again is no mere dream." On page 
 665 Geikie concludes: "We are justified, therefore, in the belief 
 that the drainage systems in the low grounds must frequently have 
 been deranged by the presence of such congealed snowdrifts," etc. 

5. pleistocene lake basins 

The Pleistocene lake basins in Alaska were formed by barriers 
 across the general drainage systems as they exist today. The 
 barriers vary in nearly every case. The lakes necessarily did not 
 all become barricaded at the same time. In fact there is reason to 
 believe that in dififerent areas these barriers formed obstructions to 
 the general drainage at varying periods throughout the Pleistocene. 
 Consequently the silt deposits, though similar otherwise, because 
 of common origin, are not all of the same age. Neither were all 
 the Pleistocene lakes drained at the same time, for some of the 
 barriers were more resistant to the erosion that set in with the 
 elevation that closed the period and were not cut down sufficiently 
 until a considerable time after other areas were drained. It is in 
 the last drained areas that the remains of elevated ice are freshest.
