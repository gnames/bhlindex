freezing of even the deepest ice stratum reported in the Arctic might 
 have resulted directly from a mean annual temperature no lower than 
 now prevails in northern Alaska." 

The writer thinks it safe to reiterate that the most severe climate 
 we are justified by facts in assigning to the Arctic is that prevailing 
 there today. 

Page 132 (op. cit.) " Although the passage of heat through the 
 surface layers in Arctic regions is slow, yet it is apparent that the 
 length of time since a mild climate existed there is sufficient, even 
 under existing conditions, to allow of the freezing of strata several 
 hundred feet below the surface. The mean annual temperature of 
 the non-glaciated portion of Alaska during the Glacial epoch must 
 have been lower than at present — at least such I am confident would 
 be the conclusion of the majority of geologists — and there seems 
 good reason for believing that the freezing of the tundra began in 
 Pleistocene times and continued to the present day. An increase 
 in the thickness of the frozen layer, owing to the influence of a 
 mean annual temperature below 32° F., and the deposition of a suc- 
 cession of frozen layers, as suggested elsewhere, may have combined 
 to produce the results now observed." 

The writer cannot agree with the supposition that " The mean 
 annual temperature of the non-glaciated portion of Alaska during 
 the Glacial epoch must have been lower than at present." There 
 are no facts to support such a view. Neither is this surmise justi- 
 fied — " and there seems good reason for believing that the freezing 
 of the tundra began in Pleistocene time and continued to the present 
 day " — for there is nothing to show that a tundra mantled surface 
 of the non-glaciated area was the condition prevailing in Pleistocene 
 time. In Siberia the flora of Pleistocene time north to the present 
 Arctic coast line was not what is classed as tundra. In Alaska, too, 
 the Pleistocene lignites tend to show that a more temperate flora 
 extended considerably farther north than today and there is nothing 
 to indicate that tundra existed at all until the Recent period com- 
 menced. The Avriter considers that all of the peat and tundra of 
 Alaska belongs to the Recent. That the climatic conditions inaugu- 
 rating this period were the first of enough severity to suppress vege- 
 tation to the character called tundra.
