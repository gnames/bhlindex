36 Smithsonian Exploration in Alaska in 1904 

A brief sketch of some of the conditions of plant hfe in 
 Arctic lands will further make this clear, and at the same time bring 
 out a number of facts which have an important bearing on the 
 question of plants and climatic conditions," etc. 

X. The Land Ice of Arctic and Sub-Arctic Regions 

Ice deposits may be classified under five heads in chronological 
 sequence as follows : 

I. glacial ice of snow origin 

Glacial ice does not enter into this discussion beyond what has 
 been already said ; that its erosive action in the higher lands pro- 
 duced most of the immense quantity of detritus which forms the 
 deposits of the Pleistocene period, and the waters from the melting 
 snow and ice supplied the great volumes necessary to transport this 
 material over the wide areas it now occupies. The ice in this case 
 is of snow origin and its formation has extended from Pleistocene 
 time down to the present. 

2. ice-beds of elevated pleistocene lake basins not of snow 

ORIGIN 

The older elevated ice-beds as they survive in Alaska today 
 appear to mark the end of the Pleistocene and beginning of the 
 Recent, there being no break between the two periods. This elevated 
 ice marks a colder climate, which accompanied the elevation of the 
 land that drained the large Pleistocene lakes. It also marks the 
 beginning of conditions as they exist today in that region. It is 
 the oldest ice we know of after glacier ice. 

The ice-beds are elevated from fifty to two hundred feet above 
 present drainage levels. They rest on the Pleistocene lacustrine clays 
 in hollows or undulations apparently due to gentle folding the silts 
 have undergone in being elevated to present levels. This same 
 elevation being the one that has caused the Pleistocene lakes to 
 drain. 

As already remarked it is dead ice gradually wasting away and 
 not, from appearances, being added to in any way. Generally it 
 may be distinguished from the younger ice interstratified, or rather 
 intermingled, with the recent alluviums of the river and coastal 
 plains, by its occurrence in more extensive sheets or beds, its eleva- 
 tion above the present drainage levels caused by the down-cutting 
 of the streams since it was frozen, and in that it rests conformablv
