from beneath, until it has attained a sufficient thickness so that its 
 bottom plane is beyond the reach of the low atmospheric tempera- 
 ture above ; after which it continues to increase in extent, but not 
 in thickness or depth. 

" With the advent of the warm weather of summer the growth 
 of the crystosphene ceases, but the cold spring water which con- 
 tinues to rise up beneath it has very little power to melt it, and its 
 covering of moss or muck, being an excellent non-conductor of heat, 
 protects it from the sun and wind, and prevents it from thawing and 
 disappearing. Thus at the advent of another winter it is ready for 
 still greater growth." 

Ice sheets in alluvium bottoms on gradients appear to bear a cer- 
 tain relation to the isothermal surface marking the plane of division 
 between the constantly frozen substratum and the annually thawed 
 superstratum or surface layer. This thawed surface layer, com- 
 posed in most cases of peat and growing sphagnum, or tundra 
 (" Cryptogamic plants make more than nine-tenths of its mass, and 
 on their power to grow above as they die and decay below depends 
 the existence of the tundra.") lies like a tenacious wet blanket over 
 the stable frozen substratum of alluvium or bed rock as the case 
 may be. This blanket-like surface layer even where developed only 
 to the extent of an acre or so is conducive to a condition of capillary 
 saturation and hydrostatic semi-flotation. For in these Arctic 
 regions the cold of winter penetrates into the saturated earth and 
 converts it annually into a solidly frozen mass. However warm 
 the short summers may be it is insufficient to melt more than a super- 
 ficial portion of this boreal blanket, so only a swampy carpet of moss 
 may flourish upon the constantly frozen substratum. Through this 
 the standing water cannot sink. As the weather is never warm 
 enough to carry it off by evaporation, these marshes extend far and 
 wide, even up the sides of the hills and mountains. 

An hypothesis to explain the occurrence of ice sheets under a 
 mantle of moss under some of the circumstances where it is met 
 with, especially on sloping surfaces such as Tyrrell describes for 
 the Klondike region and which are common elsewhere in Alaska, is 
 similar to a suggestion made by Lieutenant Belcher.*^ 

The water sinks through the moss blanket from the surface and 
 also seeps underneath it from higher levels. This tends to lift the 
 living moss with its thawed underlying layer of vegetable humus or
