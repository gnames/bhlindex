Land Ice of Arctic and Sub-Arctic Regions 45 

peat, floating it in a state of semi-buoyancy above tbe frozen sub- 
 stratum of alluvium or peat so tbe ice may accumulate season after 
 season, as long as tbere is a growing and buoyant equilibrium main- 
 tained between tbe annually tbawed peaty superstratum and the 
 constantly frozen substratum. 

The condition of semi-buoyancy or flotation frequently exists in 
 bogs in temperate latitudes where the cold of winter is not sufficient 
 to freeze the water underneath the peat, or at least where the annual 
 result of such freezing they may be subjected to does not permit of 
 ice surviving from year to year in whole or in part as it does in 
 higher latitudes. 

The Solway Moss in Cumberland, England, is a familiar histori- 
 cal instance of a semi-buoyant bog without ice underneath. It is 
 of tradition that at the defeat of the Scots in this locality by the 
 English in 1542, a troop of horsemen heavily mounted and heavily 
 armored was put to rout. In the panic of their flight they ran 
 headlong into this peat bog and became engulfed. More than two 
 hundred years later, at the end of the eighteenth century, it is re- 
 corded that a digger of peat came upon a man and his horse sup- 
 posed to be one of this troop, for both were in complete armor and 
 preserved from total decay by the antiseptic qualities of the peat. 
 In 1 77 1 this bog, surcharged with the water of heavy rains, rose, 
 swelled, burst, and swept over houses and trees in its course. It 
 is easy to see how bogs similar to this might, if subjected to a cli- 
 mate as severe as that now prevailing in the Arctic regions, exist as 
 an icy mass.^^ 

The tundra mantle that covers practically all of this northern 
 region, with the conditions it imposes upon the drainage of the 
 country together with its properties as an insulating material are 
 important if not the chief factors in the formation and preservation 
 of ice. In considering its total and generalized effects there are 
 presented a variety of conditions and probabilities upon which there 
 is no data. Some of them are : the continuous summer heat and its 
 total thermal eft'ect, absorption, radiation, etc. The heat involved 
 in the growing of the cryptogams that make up the large bulk of 
 the tundra, and whether the effects are appreciable. Spontaneous 
 combustion of peat, chemical decomposition of vegetable matter 
 generating gases and heat and what effect these may produce in 
 floating bogs and the ice they protect from disintegration.
