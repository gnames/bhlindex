46 Smithsoxian Exploration in Alaska in 1904 

The views of the flood plains of the Goodpaster River, presented 
 in plates v and vi, show the annual deposit of ice formed by the 
 freezing' of overflow water and snowdrifts saturated by the same. 
 Deposits of this kind are spoken of as '' annual glaciers." It is 
 seldom that even remnants of them survive from one year to the 
 next. As a rule such accumulations entirely disappear each sum- 
 mer to form again the following winter. This is a transitory form 
 of flood-plain ice and belong- to the same class as river ice, for it 
 has a similar mode of formation. The persistence of this form 
 of ice through the summer is due simply to the fact that the spring 
 freshets are too feeble to disintegrate such winter accum.ulations 
 on the smaller streams as do the floods of the larger rivers. 

Mr. A. J. Collier has observed underground drifts made during 
 mining operations fill with water by infiltration and freeze in the 
 course of one winter so the workings are completely blocked. E. S. 
 Balch, in a work entitled, " Glacieres or Freezing Caverns," Phila- 
 delphia, 1900, gives data on the causes of subterranean ice, pages 109- 
 161, and on page 115, speaking of ice sheets says: " In northeastern 
 Siberia, a form of permanent surface ice is found, which the Tun- 
 gusses speak of as far inn 01, which means ' ice troughs ' or ' ice 
 valleys.' " These tarinnen are broad valleys, with either a horizontal 
 floor or one sloping gently in the form of a trough, over which the 
 ice is spread in the form of a sheet. The Tungusses assert that the 
 ice in some of these troughs never wholly melts away, although it 
 lessens in quantity from the beginning of May till the end of August, 
 after which it once more increases." On pages 166 and 167 Balch 
 mentions the " Subsoil Ice in Alaska," â– " citing I. C. Russell, and 
 " Subsoil Ice in the Klondike Region," ""''' *' Ice Clifl:"s on the Kowak 
 River, Alaska," " and " Subterranean Ice Sheet on Kotzebue 
 Sound." '' 

5, SNOW-DRIFT ICE 

The only ice whose origin can be wholly and positively assigned 
 to drifts of zuind blozcn snow are the accumulations found under 
 sea cliffs and other escarpments, in canons, gullies, and ravines.
