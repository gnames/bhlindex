and contend, on the basis of these variable facts, that the bed of 
 ice it may be confused with is also a deposit of snow drift origin. 

6. LAND ICE in SIBERIA 

The real significance of land ice in Siberia with explanations to 
 account for its origin appear to be as confused as the opinions con- 
 cerning analogous phenomena in Alaska. 

According to Toll's opinion ^* the ground ice deposits are nothing 
 else than fossil glaciers, but he admits for certain cases the same 
 origin Tolmatschow ^^ accepts for the Beresowka ice. " If we 
 observe," Toll says,°° " the map, we see that masses of stone ice 
 apparently of the type of a fossil glacier are to be found at the 
 mouths of rivers. And if admitted, as I shall show later on, that 
 the islands of New Siberia and the continent were still united in the 
 Quaternary period it will be easy to reconstruct the courses of the 
 rivers between the islands and the continent. In this case it may 
 be thought that the masses of snow ice belong to the river terraces, 
 i. e., that they are the remains of snow fallen during the winter, 
 which have been covered by the spring overflow of the rivers and 
 then fossilized. I admit that some isolated cases like this do happen. 
 But observation of the conditions I have learned to know, as on the 
 Ljachow islands, will hardly permit me to think that such an excep- 
 tional formation has given rise to those imposing accumulations and 
 others like them." 

The observations of Toll, who reported having seen on the 
 southern coast of Ljachow Island an uninterrupted sheet of ice, with 
 an earth layer on it, nearly ten versts long, have been criticised by 
 Bunge." Bunge thinks that when Toll visited the island the whole 
 coast was covered with deep snow, and this snow has been taken by 
 Toll to be an ice sheet. Toll was there in the spring. Bunge in the 
 summer. 

Toll supposes such deposits of ice represent the remains of 
 glaciers, basing such contention primarily upon its physical char- 
 acteristics, that it can only be snow ice, and resembles white glacier 
 ice, or even neve, because rich in air. Tolmatschow supports Toll 
 as far as favoring the view that the deposits are of snow origin:
