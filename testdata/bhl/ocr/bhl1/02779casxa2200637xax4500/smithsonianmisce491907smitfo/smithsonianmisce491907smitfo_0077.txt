" Dr. Bunge, who was with Toll on the Xew Siberia Islands, 
 studied the ground ice formation carefully, but he came, in explain- 
 ing the origin of the same formation, to conclusions quite different 
 from those of his companion. According to Bunge's opinion the 
 ground ice is a vein or strata-like formation : ' The contraction of 
 the tundra ground caused by the cold, has given rise to many crev- 
 asses, which must have been large and deep. In spring and summer 
 a heavy rainfall, coming in contact, in those crevasses, with frozen 
 earth, freezes. This goes on a long time, sometimes many years, 
 and in this way large veins of ice are formed in the tundra ground. 
 The water not frozen can expand horizontally and so form hori- 
 zontal sheets of ice. Through the wasting away of the tundra by 
 the sea or a river the vein of ice may be laid bare and so expose an 
 ice wall.' " 

Tolmatschow comments : " It may be remarked the for- 
 mation of the ice in such a way cannot be deduced from its struc- 
 ture. Water forming from snow is very rich in air, but from it 
 ice so rich in air as snow ice cannot form. It is possible that, from 
 the water that first comes into contact with the frozen soil, a thin 
 sheet of ice comparatively rich in air, might be formed. But when 
 the direct action. of the very cold ground on the flowing water is 
 excluded by this sheet of ice, we have conditions very similar to 
 those which lead to the formation of the so-called blue ice of the 
 present time glaciers. The color and name of this (blue) ice comes 
 from the very small number of air-bubbles or from their complete 
 absence, though the water coming from the melting of the surface 
 of the glacier is by no means so poor in air as that of the tundra." 
 Bunge says explicitly that the ice he has seen " has always small 
 cracks and bubbles." Toll also points to the richness of the ice in 
 air bubbles, and this proves once more that the land ice comes from 
 snow. (Toll also gives photographs showing the granular appear- 
 ance of the surface of the ice upon melting to support the conten- 
 tion of its snow origin.) If two learned men collect a large amount 
 of data in the same district from the same formations in order to 
 solve one question, and afterwards come to two conclusions con- 
 tradicting and excluding each other, we must say that the question 
 is not clear, even as it appears on the spot, and more close observa- 
 tion is to be desired. There is no doubt that vein ice is much 
 spread in the tundra, but according to the structure of the ground 
 ice, as it has been described by Bunge and Toll, it cannot have 
 come from water, but from snow. " It seems to me (Tolmatschow) 
 that some of the examples given by Bunge correspond exactly to 
 this (snow) way of formation."
