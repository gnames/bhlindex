 photographs. He did not go to the opposite side of the valley but 
 noticed there, as on the left side, a ' Taiga ' (wooded terrace) which 
 runs along the river as a broad strip of land, and which he dis- 
 tinguishes from the lowlands or bottoms of the newest alluvial 
 deposits of the Beresowka.

 a deposit that once filled the whole lake-like expanse of the valley

 the left bank originally filled the whole valley, but have been swept 
 away by the Beresowka, so that only small portions remain and 
 these will soon disappear. Although the right side of the valley 
 was not examined its ' Taiga ' terrace corresponds, orographically, 
 to the left terrace.
