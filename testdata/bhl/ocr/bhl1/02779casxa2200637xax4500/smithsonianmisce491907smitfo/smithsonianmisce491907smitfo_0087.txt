I. ASSOCIATION OF PLEISTOCENE MAMMAL REMAINS WITH ICE 

The writer considers Tolmatschow's conclusions as to the hori- 
 zon of the mammoth to be unestabUshed by the facts surrounding 
 the finding of the Beresowka carcass, but beyond pointing out that 
 it is not proved that this carcass came from above the ice bed there 
 appear to be no suggestions to offer. Laifortunately there is every 
 possible doubt about the true original position of this carcass, there 
 being three horizons as far as position is concerned in which it may 
 have been originally entombed. They are in descending order : 
 (i) The clay and shingle layers intermingled with lamellar sheets 
 of ice above; (2) the thicker, homogeneous and more fundamental 
 (from a stratigraphic standpoint) ice-bed that forms the conspicu- 
 ous part of the escarpment of the terrace wall; (3) from the Pleis- 
 tocene clays underlying this thicker bed of ice. 

As the writer's experience has been confined to Alaska, where as 
 before stated no authentic instance of the occurrence of Pleisto- 
 cene mammal remains is known in primar}' stratigraphic position, 
 it is impossible to state whether the mammoth was confined to any 
 particular one of the three horizons enumerated above or may not 
 be found in all three of them. 

Tolmatschow says : " As until now the bones and carcasses of 
 mammoths have been found only in the earth layers on the ice, 
 Toll thinks that the ice sheet represents a deposit stratigraphically 
 independent from the upper one containing the bones of the mam- 
 moth. The Beresowka occurrence seems to confirm this supposi- 
 tion. But by the observations of Herz's expedition so many new 
 things have been learned about the way mammoths lived, that we 
 may imagine another reason for finding the mammoth in the earth 
 layers on the ice. 

" The remains of reeds and other grasses found in the mouth 
 (partly on the tongue) and in the stomach of the mammoth show 
 us, that at least in this case (and, it better be modified, at that par- 
 ticular moment), the animal was graminivorous, an inhabitant of the 
 meadows, and these meadows were found by the animals on the 
 river terraces, which in spring were likely to be under water and 
 in summer, in spite of the layer of ice under them, were covered 
 with a magnificent vegetation. In such meadows, perhaps where 
 swampy, mammoths occasionally became engulfed and disappeared 
 without having swallowed their food. It is likely such occurrences 
 happened often on the terraces. Along with the animals fallen on
