Land Ice and the Mammoth 6i 

away for Siberia, without any action, but there are only some local 
 traces remaining. If the humidity of northern Siberia, which now 
 has a very dry climate, were to increase slightly, the rainfall would 
 certainly increase. It is quite possible that the formation of lake 
 deposits of ice would occur during a period with heavy rainfall. 
 But even if we call these older deposits of ice ' fossil ice ' it does 
 not follow that it is either the remains of a glacier or of continental 
 ice. because, for such occurrence many different conditions and char- 
 acteristic features are necessary, which are not yet known to exist 
 in northern Siberia. 

" As appears from the description of the Beresowka valley, de- 
 posits corresponding to the horizon of the mammoth are very com- 
 mon in this part of Siberia. All the older ground-ice deposits most 
 likely belong to the same horizon." 

In brief, Tolmatschow appears to be aware, without being con- 
 scious of the significance thereof, of the existence of an older ice 
 on top of elevated Pleistocene silts. No doubt if he had viewed the 
 phenomena personally he would have fully recognized this apparent 
 fact. 

Wrangell ''* says : " The best mammoth bones as well as the 
 greatest number are found at a certain depth below the surface, 
 usually in clay hills, more rarely in black earth. The more solid 
 the clay, the better the bones are preserved. Experience has always 
 shown that more are found in elevations situated near higher hills 
 than along the low coast or on the flat tundra." 

The one point that appears to be a matter of unanimous agree- 
 ment among those who have described the Elephant Point locality 
 on Kotzebue Sound, Alaska, is that the remains never occur in the 
 ice-bed nor the peaty or earthy layers overlying it. It has been 
 generally conceded they were derived from the clay beneath the 
 ice. Hooper's suggestion is worthy of serious notice in accounting 
 for some of the remains at Elephant Point. He says : "" " Kotzebue 
 was undobutedly in error in supposing that the fossil remains of 
 animals found in the vicinity were embedded in the cliff, I exam- 
 ined them carefully each season and saw no signs of animal remains 
 of any kind ; while on the shore (beach) below high-water mark, 
 we found them in abundance. They were not confined to the local- 
 ity of the cliff', but extended each way as far as our investigations 
 reached. They evidently came from the Buckland River, and were
