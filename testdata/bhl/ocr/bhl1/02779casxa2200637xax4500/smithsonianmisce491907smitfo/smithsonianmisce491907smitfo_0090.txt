 Buckland River also undoubtedly explains the presence on this

The writer can attest to the transporting of bones considerable 
 distances by rivers. In the summer of 1904 he ascended the Old 
 Crow River, a tributary of the Porcupine, by its meandering course 
 about one hundred and seventy miles, and along the upper one 
 hundred miles of this distance found strong evidence in the shape 
 of scattered bones of the former existence of mammoth, bison, and 
 horse. On the bars also were accumulations of the broken and 
 comminuted fragments of their bones. These remains were with- 
 out exception all found below the high-water level of the flood 
 stages of the river and were without question brought down from 
 some primary source or sources of deposition, by the great trans- 
 porting agent in those regions, floating ice. Yet the formation of 
 the river banks along which the remains occur is a continuous 
 deposit of Pleistocene lacustrine silts rising about 150 feet above 
 the river level and frequently exposing, where the river is cutting 
 laterally into them, terraced escarpments of ice. The ice deposits 
 do not form a continuous sheet over the whole lacustrine area, nor 
 do they rise as solid walls from the water level. They occur in the 
 undulations of the surface on top of the silts as beds 10 to 30 feet 
 thick, as already explained, and are elevated 100 feet or more above 
 the river. In no case were individual beds of ice exposed for more 
 than one mile and in most cases the exposures are not so extensive 
 as this. In no case was anything seen above the ice but peat and 
 humus. This is explained, however, by the fact that the deposits 
 as exposed by the sections examined comprise the central area of 
 what has been an extensive Pleistocene lake. Only near the former 
 lake shores are to be expected the conditions of abruptly rising 
 land slopes to afford detritus and alluvium for deposits on top of 
 the ice such as exist at the Beresowka locality and at Elephant 
 Point. It also appears from these cases that the surfaces of the 
 drained lake bottoms where extensive were too treacherous 
 or uninviting for the mammals of that time to wander out over 
 them, so experience thus far points towards the immediate shores 
 of the Pleistocene lakes as the places to search for mammal re- 
 mains in their primary position. 

In reviewing the facts as they appear the writer is satisfied that
