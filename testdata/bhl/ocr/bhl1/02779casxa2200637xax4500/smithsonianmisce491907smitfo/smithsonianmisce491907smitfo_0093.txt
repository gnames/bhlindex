Summary of Conclusions 65 

dizing of peat and humus and is more often found in situations 
 where there are no traces whatever of animal remains. It is clearly 
 and solely referable to decaying vegetable matter and in no case to 
 animal matter in the Pleistocene clays. 

It appears safe to assert that even when found intimately asso- 
 ciated with mammal remains on talus slopes all occurrences of ice 
 are to be considered more as an afterthought in studying the Pleis- 
 tocene deposits of Alaska (and Siberia) with their fossil remains. 
 The phenomena of Pleistocene and Recent are confused only super- 
 ficially as is to be expected. The land ice bears no relation to the 
 mammoth and its contemporary fauna beyond that the conditions of 
 gradually increasing cold that have brought about the occurrence 
 and preservation of the ice phenomena as exhibited today in Arctic 
 and sub-Arctic regions was apparently also the primary cause of 
 the extinction of the mammoth. The mammoth has become asso- 
 ciated with ice because its remains have been found intermingled 
 with ice on talus slopes. This is to be expected in clay bluffs 
 overlain by beds of ice which in turn are covered by layers of peat 
 or alluvium. In undergoing a vertical displacement due to the 
 undermining of the sea or rivers, the ice may be fractured into large 
 blocks by uneven stresses during its descent, the peaty covering 
 become torn so fragments of it mixed with clay are washed down 
 and over the new surface to fill up the cracks between the frozen 
 blocks. Thus any mammoth or other remains that may be im- 
 bedded in the clays may become mixed heterogeneously with the 
 re-sorted material among the ice blocks or lie exposed. Thus a 
 frozen carcass may readily fall intact to find a secondary resting 
 place in a crevasse between ice blocks and there be refrigerated. 

XII. â€” Summary of Conclusions 

I. That while remnants of the large Pleistocene mammal herds 
 may have survived down to the Recent period and in some cases 
 their direct descendants, as the musk-ox, to the present, most of 
 them became extinct in Alaska with the close of Pleistocene. 

II. The most rational way of explaining this extinction of ani- 
 mal life is by a gradual changing of the climate from more temper- 
 ate conditions permitting of a forest vegetation much farther north 
 than now, to the more severe climate of today, which subduing the 
 vegetation and thus reducing the food supply besides directly dis- 
 comforting the animals themselves, has left only those forms 
 capable of adapting themselves to the Recent conditions surviving 
 in these regions to the present.
