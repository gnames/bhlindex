III. There are no facts to support the contention that the chmate 
 of the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions ever has been colder than it 
 is at present. There are no phenomena presented in those regions 
 that require a more severe chmate than that now existing to account 
 for them. There are no ice deposits in Alaska, except those of 
 large glaciers, that may be considered of Pleistocene age. There 
 are no ice-beds interstratified with the Pleistocene deposits of 
 Alaska. 

IV. That the various forms of land ice, together with the de- 
 posits of peat, now existing throughout the Arctic and sub-Arctic 
 regions of Alaska belong to the Recent period and these deposits 
 may be most conveniently and logically classified by their position 
 with reference to the Pleistocene and Recent formations and the 
 ice deposits cannot be differentiated satisfactorily into deposits of 
 snow or of water origin by their physical structure and character 
 alone.
