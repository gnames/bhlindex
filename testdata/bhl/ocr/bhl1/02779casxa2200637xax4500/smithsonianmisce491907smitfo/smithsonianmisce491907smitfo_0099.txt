Ice-beds on Eschscholtz Bay 71 

weighed from Chamisso Island attended by the barge, and steered 
 out of the sound. The day was very fine ; and as we sailed along 
 the northern shore, the sun was reflected from several parts of the 
 cliff, which our telescopes discovered to be cased with a frozen sur- 
 face similar to that just described in Eschscholtz Bay." 

In Narrative of the Proceedings of the Barge of the Blossom to 
 explore the coast N. E. of Icy Cape : 

" On the 2 1st of August arrived off Sea Horse Islands. Thence 
 to Cape Franklin — " and " Having run twenty-nine miles along the 
 coast to the northeast they again landed. — The coast here assumed 
 a different aspect, and consisted of clay cliffs about fifty feet high, 
 and presented an ice formation resembling that which has been de- 
 scribed in Eschscholtz Bay. Their latitude was 70° 58' 63" N." 

Monday, Sept. 11, 1826, page 322. "Having now the assistance 
 of the barge, I embarked in her to examine narrowly the shores of 
 Kotzebue Sound. Proceeding to survey the head of Eschscholtz Bay, 
 shallow water obliged the boat to anchor off Elephant Point, where 
 I left Mr. Collie with a party to examine again the cliffs in which 
 the fossils and ice formation had been seen by Kotzebue, and pro- 
 ceeded to the head of the bay in a small boat. We landed upon a 
 flat muddy beach, and were obliged to wade a quarter of a mile 
 before we could reach a cliff for the purpose of having a view of 
 the surrounding country. * * * 

" The shore around us was flat, broken by several lakes, in which 
 there was a great many waterfowl. The cliff we had ascended was 
 composed of a bluish mud and clay, and was full of deep chasms 
 lying in a direction parallel with the front of the cliff. In appear- 
 ance the cliff was similar to that at Elephant Point, which was 
 said to contain fossils ; but there were none seen in this one, though 
 the earth, in parts, had a disagreeable smell, similar to that which 
 was supposed to proceed from the decayed animal substances in the 
 cliff near Elephant Point. * * * 

Page 323. " I found Mr. Collie had been successful in his search 
 among the cliffs at Elephant Point, and had discovered several bones 
 and grinders of elephants and other animals in a fossil state of which 
 a full description and drawings from the remains will be found in 
 the appendix. Associating these two discoveries, I bestowed the 
 name of Elephant upon the point, to mark its vicinity to the place 
 where the fossils were found; and upon the river that of Buckland, 
 in compliment to Dr. Buckland, the professor of geology at Oxford, 
 to whom I am much indebted for the above mentioned description of 
 the fossils, and for the arrangement of the geological memoranda 
 attached to this work.
