Ice-beds on Eschscholtz Bay • 73 

October 7, 1826, page ^^^. " Mr. Elson went up Eschscholtz Bay 
 with two boats for [p. 334] the purpose of sounding and obtaining 
 further information of Buckland River. * * * The barge brought 
 us down a valuable addition to our collection of fossils, the cliff 
 having broken away considerably since the first specimens were ob- 
 tained." 

Part II, page 560, September 18, 1827. " On the i8th a party of 
 the officers landed in Eschscholtz Bay to search for fossils, but they 
 were unsuccessful, in consequence of an irregularity of the tide, 
 which was on that occasion unaccountably high, and scarcely fell 
 during the day. The cliffs had broken away considerably since the 
 preceding year ; and the frozen surface of the cliff appeared in 
 smaller quantities than before, but the earth was found congealed at 
 a less depth from the top. This examination tended to confirm 
 more steadfastly the opinion that the ice forms only a coating to the 
 cliff, and is occasioned by small streams of water oozing out, which 
 either become congealed themselves in their descent, or convert into 
 ice the snow which rests in the hollows."

" Having been requested, at the time of Captain Beechey's return 
 to England, 1828, to examine the collection of animal remains which 
 he brought home from the shores of Eschscholtz Bay, and to pre- 
 pare a description of them for the present publication, I attended at 
 the Admiralty to assist at the opening and distribution of these speci- 
 mens. The most perfect series, including all the specimens, engraved 
 in plates i, 2, 3 (fossils), was selected for the< British Museum; 
 another series, including some of the largest tusks of elephants, was 
 sent to the Museum of the College of Edinburg, and other tusks to 
 the Museum of the Geological Society of London. To the plates of 
 these fossils, I have added a map of the bay in which they were col- 
 lected,' on the same spot where similar remains were first discovered 
 by Lieutenant Kotzebue and Dr. Eschscholtz, on the 8th of August, 

^ This map was not published until 1839 when it appeared along with other 
 geological notes at the end of the volume on the Zoology of Captain Beechey's 
 Voyage.
