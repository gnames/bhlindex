he was with Captain Beechey in Eschscholtz Bay, and add my own 
 Hst and description of the most perfect of these specimens, which I 
 have selected to be engraved. 

" List, showing the total number of animal remains collected in 
 Eschscholtz Bay, taken from the journal of Mr. Collie : 

" Elephant: — i lower jaw, nearly complete ; 7 molar teeth ; 9 tusks. 
 Five of them large, and weighing from one hundred to one hundred 
 and sixty pounds each. Four small ; one of these was found in the 
 debris of the cliff half way up ; the circumference of the largest tusk 
 at its root is twenty inches, and at three feet above the root twenty- 
 one inches and a half; another tusk, in which part of the tip is 
 wanting, measures nine feet two inches along the curve from the root 
 to the tip, and five feet two inches across the chord of its curve ; 4 
 fragments of tusks ; 3 dorsal vertebrae, five inches and a half in 
 diameter; i atlas; i os innominatum, nearly perfect; i ilium, imper- 
 fect; I OS pubis, imperfect; 4 fragments of scapulae, one of them 
 tolerably complete ; i portion of humerus ; 5 femora, one of them 
 almost complete ; 4 fragments of femora ; 2 tibise, one of them nearly 
 complete: i tarsal bone; i os calcis, entire, taken out of the cliff; 
 I cuboides, nearly entire ; i cuneiform ; i phalangal bone. 

"Urns: — i skull, incomplete; 3 fragments of horns; i femur; 3 
 tibire ; I dorsal vertebra ; i sacrum. 

"Musk-ox: — I skull, with horns attached, incomplete and very 
 modern.

[598] " The attention of the world has been called to the remarka- 
 ble cliff in which fossil bones were found by Dr. Eschscholtz in Au- 
 gust, 1816. On my first visit to it in the month of July, 1826, time did 
 not permit me to do more than take a view of the most eastern part, 
 and examine the nature of the icy fronting which is presented. At 
 that time I saw no traces of fossils ; this cliff faces to the north, and 
 extends in nearly a right line, with few interruptions, for two miles 
 and a half, and is in general about ninety feet high. It is composed 
 of clay and very fine quartzy and micaceous sand, assuming a grayish 
 appearance when dry. The land behind rises gradually to an addi- 
 tional height of one hundred feet, and is covered with a black, boggy 
 soil, nourishing a brown and gray lichen, moss, several species of
