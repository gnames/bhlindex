of a brownish sandstone, lay upon the shoal left dry by the receding 
 sea. With these were also porphyritic pebbles. 

" Parts of some of the tusks, where they had been imbedded in the 
 clay and sand, were coloured blue by phosphate of iron, and many of 
 the teeth were stained in the same manner. The circular layers of 
 the tusks in the more decayed specimens were distinctly separated 
 b}' a thin vein of fibrous gypsum. 

" In those parts of the bay where there are no cliffs, the waves 
 are kept at a distance from the land by a gravelly beach, which they 
 have thrown up for a considerable extent round the entrance of the 
 streams which come down the valleys. These beaches have formed 
 rounded flats containing marshes or lakes : not unfrequently a rather 
 luxuriant herbage covers their surface. The land behind them 
 rises in a gentle slope. Great part of the shore of Kotzebue Sound is 
 made up of a diluvial formation, similar to that on the south shore 
 of Eschscholtz Bay. From Hut Peak to Hotham Inlet it exhibits 
 many cliffs similar to those just described, and also others with a 
 uniform and steep slope, partly covered with verdure, and partly 
 exposing the dry sand and clay which compose them. The most 
 elevated cliffs form the projecting headland of Cape Blossom, and 
 abound in ice, notunthstanding their southern aspect, particularly 
 at Mosquito station and Cape Blossom. In their neighborhood I 
 observed the natives had recently formed coarse ivory spoons from 
 the external layer of a fossil elephant's tusk. The ice here in the end 
 of September showed itself more abundantly than it did in the middle 
 of the same month on the cliff's in Eschscholtz Bay which have a 
 northern aspect. 

" INIr. Collie then proceeds to explain still further his ideas of the 
 manner in which masses and sheets of pure ice may have been col- 
 lected in hollows and fissures on and near the front of the cliff' in 
 Eschscholtz Bay. 

" ' 1st. By the accumulation of snow drifted into hollows sub- 
 jacent to the overhanging stratum of black boggy soil that forms the 
 brink of the cliff', and subsequently converted into ice by successive 
 thawing and freezing in spring and summer. 

[600] " ' 2dly. They may have been formed from water collected 
 in deep fissures and cavities that intersect the falling cliff near its 
 margin. The inclined position of the land immediately above this 
 margin of peat, and the annual undermining which is produced by 
 the thawing of the frozen mud beneath it, produce occasional land 
 slips and movements of the edge of the cliff' towards the sea ; these 
 cause cracks and fissures of the soil in various directions, but chiefly
