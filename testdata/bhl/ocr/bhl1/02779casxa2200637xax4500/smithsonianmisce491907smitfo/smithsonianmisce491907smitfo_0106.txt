parallel to the external face of the cliff. When these fissures descend 
 through the black boggy soil of the surface into the frozen mud 
 below, they become receptacles for the formation of ice, since the 
 water that oozes into them is congealed upon their sides until it 
 entirely fills them with a wall or dyke of solid ice. The fall of a 
 mass of mud from the outer side of one of these walls would expose 
 this ice, forming a case over the inner side of the fissure in which it 
 was accumulated. 

" ' 3dly. The manner in which an extensive facing of pure ice 
 may be formed on these cliffs, by water during the summer trickling 
 down their frozen surface from the soil above, and becoming con- 
 verted to ice in the course of its descent, has been described by 
 Captain Beechey [pages 258 and 330].' 

" Lieutenant Belcher, in his notes, proposes another theory to 
 explain the occurrence of masses of pure ice immediately below the 
 margin of the peat on the top of the cliff on the southern shore of 
 Eschscholtz Bay. He concieves that between the superficial bed 
 of spongy peat, and the mass of frozen mud which forms the body 
 and substance of this cliff, the water oozing downwards through 
 the peat, during the thaw of each successive summer, is stopped at 
 the point where it comes into contact with the perpetually frozen 
 earth below, and there accumulates into a thick horizontal sheet of 
 pure transparent ice, and that it is the broken edge of this icy stratum 
 which becomes exposed in the margin of the cliff during the process 
 of slow and gradual destruction which it is continually undergoing. 

" This opinion, however, is, I believe, peculiar to Lieutenant 
 Belcher. The experiment made by Mr. Collie in boring horizontally 
 into the cliff, through a vertical face of ice, until he penetrated the 
 frozen mud behind it, shows, that in this case the ice was merely 
 a superficial facing of frozen water, consolidated as it descended the 
 front of the cliff' ; and his further experiments in digging verticallv 
 downwards, in two places, through the peat into frozen mud, and 
 finding no traces of any intermediate bed of ice appear unfavorable 
 to any hypothesis as to the formation of a stratum of pure ice between 
 the superficial peat and subjacent mud. 

" It has just been stated that Captain Beechey and Mr. Collie pro- 
 pose three different solutions to explain the origin of these hanging 
 masses of ice near the upper margin of vertical cliffs: ist. That they 
 may have been formed from snow drifted into hollows of the cliffs, 
 and subsequently converted into ice; 2dly, From [601] water con- 
 solidatetd into ice within fissures and cavities, caused by the subsi- 
 dence and falling forwards of the frozen mud; 3dly, From water
