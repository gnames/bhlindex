Ice-beds on Eschscholtz Bay 8i 

coast is low, there is a long succession of clififs of miul, in the follow- 
 ing order: i. Schischmareff Inlet. 2. Bay of Good Hope, on the 
 south of Kotzebue Sound. 3. Spafarief Bay. at the southeast ex- 
 tremity of Kotzebue's Sound. 4. Elephant Point, in Eschscholtz 
 Bay. 5. At the mouth of the Buckland River, at the head of Esch- 
 scholtz r)ay. 6. The north coast of Eschscholtz Bay. 7. Cape 
 Blossom. 8. Point Hope. 9. From Cape Beaufort to twenty miles 
 east of Icy Cape. 10. Lunar Station, near lat. 71°. At the base 
 of the mud cliff, fifteen feet high, in the Bay of Good Hope, a 
 small piece of a tusk of an elephant was found upon the shore. At 
 Shallow Inlet, the mud cliff' was fifteen feet high, without any facings 
 of ice, or appearance of bones ; yet there was the same smell at low 
 water as in the cliffs near Elephant Point, that abound so much in 
 bones. At Icy Cape, the cliff's of mud behind the islands were about 
 twenty feet high, but were not examined. Patches of pure ice were 
 observed hanging on the mud cliff's in many places along this coast, 
 but only where there was peat at the top ; hence it may be inferred, 
 that the ice, in such cases, is formed by water oozing from the peat. 
 At High Cape, near Hotham Inlet, is a cliff of mud, a hundred feet 
 high, covered at the top with peat, and having patches of ice upon 
 its surface ; but no bones were found here. In those parts of the 
 coast where the cliff's are rocky there were no facings of ice. 

'■ Having thus far stated the evidence we possess respecting the 
 facts connected with the discovery of these bones in Eschscholtz 
 Bay, I will proceed to offer a few remarks in illustration and expla- 
 nation of them, and to consider how far they tend [604] to throw 
 light on the curious and perplexing question, as to what was the 
 climate of this portion of the world at the time when it was inhabited 
 by animals now so foreign to it as the elephant and rhinoceros, and 
 as to the manner in which, not only their teeth and tusks and dis- 
 located portions of their skeletons, but in some remarkable instances, 
 the entire carcasses of these beasts, wnth their flesh and skin still 
 perfect, became entombed in ice, or in frozen mud and gravel, over 
 such extensive and distant regions of the northern hemisphere. 

" The bones from Eschscholtz Bay, like most of those we find in 
 diluvial deposits, are no way mineralized : they are much altered 
 in colour, being almost black, and are to a certain degree decomposed 
 and weakened ; yet they retain so much animal matter, that not only 
 a strong odour like that of burnt horn is emitted from theni on the 
 application of heated iron, but a musty and slightly ammoniacal 
 smell is perceptible on gently rubbing their surface.
