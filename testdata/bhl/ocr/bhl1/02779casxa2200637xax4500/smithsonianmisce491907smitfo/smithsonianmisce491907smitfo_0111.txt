Ice-beds on Eschscholtz Bay 83 

remains are said to be derived, it appears, from specimens of it ad- 
 hering to the bones, that it consists of micaceous sand and quartzose 
 sand, intermixed with fine blue clay. In a hollow of one of the 
 tusks I found a quantity of this compound, and some fragments of 
 mica slate. All these ingredients may have been derived from the 
 detritus of primitive micaceous slates, such as constitute a large 
 part of the fundamental rocks of the neighborhood of Eschscholtz 
 Bay. 

" Pebbles of porphyry also are said to occur in the clifif, and also 
 on the beach below it, mixed, in the latter case, with pebbles of 
 basalt and sandstone, and a few large blocks of basalt. No rock 
 was noticed in this district from which these rolled stones could 
 have been derived ; some of those upon the beach may possibly have 
 been drifted thither on floating icebergs. The tranquil state and 
 retired position of the bay render it improbable that these pebbles 
 have been brought to their present place by the influence of any 
 existing submarine currents. 

" It is important to clear from confusion two facts mentioned by 
 Captain Beechey, viz., the occurrence of remains of the reindeer and 
 of the musk-ox along with bones of the elephant in Eschscholtz Bay. 
 Had the bones of either of these arctic animals been found une- 
 quivocally mixed with the bones of elephants in any undisturbed 
 part of the high clift", it would have followed that the reindeer and 
 the musk-ox must have been co-eval with the fossil elephant ; and this 
 fact would have been nearly decisive of the question as to the cli- 
 mate of this region at the time when it was inhabited by these three 
 species of animals. But as all the fossil remains collected in Esch- 
 scholtz Bay, with the exception of a very few bones and the tusk 
 of an elephant that la}' high up in the under cliff, were collected on 
 the beach between high and low-water mark, nothing is more prob- 
 able than that the bones of modern animals should become mixed 
 with those of fossils after they had fallen upon the beach in the 
 recesses of a quiet bay. 

" Kotzebue (vol. i, p. 218) says he saw many horns of reindeer 
 lying on the shore in Eschscholtz Ba}', and conjectures that the 
 Americans, who frequent these [p. 606] coasts occasionally in the 
 hunting season, may have brought with them the reindeer from 
 which these horns had been derived. This hypothesis may explain 
 the presence of such horns in a spot which no wild reindeer are 
 known to frequent at present; but as Kotzebue [p. 219] mentions 
 also the abundance of drift-wood upon the shores of this bay, it is 
 probable that the same currents which brought the wood may have
