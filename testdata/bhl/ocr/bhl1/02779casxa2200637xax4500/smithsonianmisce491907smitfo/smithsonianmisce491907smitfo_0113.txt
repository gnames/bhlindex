Ice-beds on Eschscholtz Bay 85 

ivory which is collected for sale throughout Siberia is extracted 
 from the lofty, precipitous, and sandy banks of the rivers of that 
 country ; that in every climate and latitude, from the zone of the 
 mountains in central Asia to the frozen coasts of the Arctic Ocean, 
 all Siberia abounds in these bones, but that the best fossil ivory is 
 found in the frozen lands adjacent to the Arctic Circle ; that the 
 bones of large and small animals lie in some places piled together 
 in great heaps, but, in general, they are scattered separately, as if 
 they had been agitated by waters, and buried in mud and gravel. 

" The term mammoth has been applied indiscriminately to all the 
 largest species of fossil animals, and is a word of Tartar origin, 
 meaning simply ' animal of the earth.' It is now appropriated ex- 
 clusively to the fossil elephant, of which one species only has been 
 yet established, differing materially from the two existing species, 
 which are limited, one to Asia, the other to Africa. 

" Of all the fossil animals that have been ever discovered, the 
 most remarkable is the entire carcass of a mammoth, with its tlesh, 
 skin, and hair still fresh and well preserved, which in the year 1803 
 fell from the frozen cliff of a peninsula in Siberia, near the mouth 
 of the Lena.' Nearly five years elapsed between the period when 
 this carcass was first observed by a Tungusian in the thawing cliff, 
 in 1799, and the moment when it became entirely disengaged, and 
 fell down upon the strand, between the shore and the base of the 
 cliff". Here it lay two more years, till great part of the flesh was 
 devoured by wolves and bears ; the skeleton was then collected by 
 Air. Adams and sent to Petersburg. Many of the ligaments 
 were perfect, and also the head, with its integuments, weighing four 
 hundred and fourteen pounds without the tusks, whose weight to- 
 gether was three hundred and sixty pounds. Great part of the skin 
 of the body was preserved, and was covered with reddish wool and 
 black hairs ; about thirty-six pounds of hair were collected from 
 the sand, into which it had been trampled by the bears. 

" The following description, by Mr. Adams, of the place in which 
 this mammoth was found will form an interesting subject of com- 
 parison with Captain Beechey's account of the cliff in Eschscholtz 
 Bay : ' The place where I found the mammoth is about sixty paces 
 distant from the shore, and nearly a hundred paces from the escarp- 
 ment of the ice from which it had fallen. This escarpment occupies

 of the Memoirs of the Academy of Petersburg, and also by Mr. Adams in the 
 Journal du Nord, printed at Petersburg in 1807.
