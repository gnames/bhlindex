catastrophe, and that there is proof both of the violence and sud- 
 denness of this catastrophe in the phenomenon of an entire rhi- 
 noceros found with its skin, tendons, Hgaments, and flesh preserved 
 in the frozen soil of the coldest part of eastern Siberia. On the 
 arrival of Pallas in Ircutia in March, 1772, the head of this animal 
 was laid before him, together with two of its feet, having their 
 skin and flesh hardened like a mummy ; it had been found in De- 
 cember, 1 77 1, in [609] the sand banks of the Wiluji, which runs in 
 about 64Â° of north latitude into the Lena ; the head and two feet 
 only were taken care of, the rest of the carcass, though much de- 
 cayed, was still enclosed in its skin, and was left to perish ; the bones 
 were yellow, the foot had on its skin many hairs and roots of hairs. 
 On various parts of the skin were stiff hairs from one to three 
 inches long. 

" If we compare these phenomena of the arctic regions with 
 those of other countries, and especially with England, we shall find 
 it by no means peculiar to the northern extremities of the world to 
 afford extensive deposits of diluvial mud and gravel, containing the 
 remains of extinct species of the elephant and rhinoceros, together 
 with those of horses, oxen, deer, and other land quadrupeds. A 
 large portion of the east coast of England, particularly of Essex, 
 Suffolk, Norfolk, Yorkshire, and Northumberland, is composed of 
 similar deposits of argillaceous diluvium, loaded in many places 
 with bones of the same species of quadrupeds ; these deposits occur 
 not only on the low grounds and lands of moderate elevation, but 
 also on the summits of the highest hills, e. g., on the chalky cliff of 
 Flamborough Head, four hundred and thirty feet above the sea. 
 In the central parts of England, near Rugby, we have similar de- 
 posits, containing bones, tusks, and teeth of the same species of 
 animals. In Scotland we have the same argillaceous diluvium on 
 the east coast, near Peterhead, and near the western coast, at Kil- 
 mours, in Ayrshire, where it contains tusks of elephants and bones. 

" The analogies which these deposits offer to those in the arctic 
 regions are striking. In both cases the bones are of the same spe- 
 cies of animals. In both cases they are imbedded in superficial 
 deposits of mud and gravel of enormous extent and thickness. In 
 both cases the deposits derive no accession from existing causes, and 
 are suffering only continual loss and destruction by the action of 
 the atmosphere, of rivers, and of the sea. Their chief peculiarity 
 in the polar regions seems to consist in the congealation, to which 
 the diluvium itself as well as the remains included in it are subject, 
 from the influence of the present polar climate. Examples might
