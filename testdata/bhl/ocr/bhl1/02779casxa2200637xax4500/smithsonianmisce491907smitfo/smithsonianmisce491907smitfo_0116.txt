be quoted to show the occurrence of similar remains in diluvial 
 deposits all over Europe, and largely in America. Having then 
 such extensive accumulations of the bones of animals, and the de- 
 tritus of rocks, all apparently resulting from the simultaneous action 
 of water, but which the operation of existing seas and rivers in the 
 districts occupied by this detritus can never have produced, and 
 are only tending to destroy, we may surely be justified in referring 
 them all to some adequate and common cause, such as the catas- 
 trophe of a violent and general inundation alone seems competent 
 to have afforded. 

" The facts we have been considering are obviously much con- 
 nected with the still unsettled question respecting the former cli- 
 mate and temperature of that part [p. 610] of the earth in which 
 they occur. Too much stress has, I think, been laid on the cir- 
 cumstances of the mammoth in Siberia being covered with hair. 
 We have living examples of animals in warm latitudes which are 
 not less abundantly covered with hair and wool in proportion to 
 their size than the elephant at the mouth of the Lena. Such is the 
 hy?ena villosa lately noticed at the cape by Dr. Smith, and described * 
 as having the hair on the neck and body very long and shaggy, 
 .measuring in many places, but particularly about the sides and 
 back, at least six inches ; again, the thick shaggy covering on the 
 anterior part on the body of the male lion, and the hairy coat of 
 the camel (both of them inhabitants of the warmest climates), pre- 
 sent analogies which show that no conclusive argument in proof 
 that the Siberian elephant was the inhabitant of a cold climate can 
 be drawn from the fact of the skin of the frozen carcass at the. 
 mouth of the Lena having been covered with coarse hair and wool ; 
 but even if it were proved that the climate of the arctic regions 
 was the same both before and after the extirpation of these ani- 
 mals, still must we refer to some great catastrophe to account for 
 the fact of their universal extirpation, and from those who deny 
 the occurrence of such catastrophe, it may fairly be demanded why 
 these extinct animals have not continued to live on to the present 
 hour. It is vain to contend that they have been subdued and extir- 
 pated by man, since whatever may be conceded as possible with 
 respect to Europe, it is in the highest degree improbable that he 
 could have exercised such influence over the vast wilderness of 
 northern Asia, and almost impossible that he could have done so 
 in the boundless forests of North America. The analogv of the non-
