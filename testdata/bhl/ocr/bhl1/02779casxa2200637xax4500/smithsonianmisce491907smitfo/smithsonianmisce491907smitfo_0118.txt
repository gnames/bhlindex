90 Smithsonian Exploration in Alaska in 1904 

and although we are not yet enough acquainted with the details of 
 the geology of the arctic regions to apply this argument to them 
 with the same precision and to the same extent as to lower lati- 
 tudes, still we have detached examples of organic remains in high 
 latitudes sufficient to show the former existence of heat in the 
 regions where they are found â€” a few detached spots within the 
 Arctic Circle that can be shown to have been once the site of ex- 
 tensive coral reefs are as decisive in proof that the climate in these 
 spots was warm at the time when these corals lived and grew into 
 a reef, as, on the other hand, the carcass of a single elephant pre- 
 served in ice is decisive of the existence of continual and intense 
 cold ever since the period at which it perished. We have for some 
 time known that in and near Melville Island, and it has been ascer- 
 tained by Captain Beechey's expedition, that at Cape Thompson, 
 near Beering's Strait, there occur within the Arctic Circle extensive 
 rocks of limestone containing many of the same fossil shells and 
 fossil corals that abound in the carboniferous limestone of Derby- 
 shire: the remains of fossil marine turtles also (chelonia radiata) 
 have been ascertained by Professor Fischer to exist in Siberia. 
 These are enough to show that the climate could not have been 
 cold at the time and place when they were deposited ; and the anal- 
 ogy of adjacent European latitudes renders it probable that the 
 same cooling processes that were going on in them extended their 
 influence to the polar regions also, producing successive reductions 
 of temperature, accompanied by corresponding changes in the ani- 
 mal [p. 612] and vegetable creation, until the period arrived in 
 which the elephant and rhinoceros inhabited nearly the entire sur- 
 face of what are now the temperate and frigid zones of the north- 
 ern hemisphere. 

" Assuming then on such evidence as I have alluded to, the 
 former high temperature of the Arctic Circle, and knowing from 
 the investment in ice and preservation of the carcass of the mam- 
 moth, that this region was intensely cold at the time immediately 
 succeeding its death, and has so continued to the present hour ; the 
 point on which we are most in want of decisive evidence is the tem- 
 perature of the climate in which the mammoth lived. It is a viola- 
 tion of existing analogies to suppose that any extinct elephant or 
 rhinoceros was more tolerant of cold than extinct corallines or 
 turtles ; and as this northern region of the earth seems to have 
 undergone successive changes from heat to cold, so it is probable 
 that the last of these changes was coincident with the extirpation 
 of the mammoth. That this last change was sudden is shown by
