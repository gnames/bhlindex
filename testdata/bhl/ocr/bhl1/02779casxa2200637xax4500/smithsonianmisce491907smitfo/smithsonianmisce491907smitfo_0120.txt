" The ice-cliffs ' of Eschscholtz Bay, in Kotzebue Sound, well 
 deserve attention. They extend along the southern side of the bay, 
 east and west, from Elephant Point to Eschscholtz Point ; they are 
 from forty to ninety feet high, and consist of three distinct layers. 
 The lower layer is ice, the central clay, containing fossils, and the 
 uppermost peat. Partly from the action of the waves, partly the 
 thawing of the ice, that side of the cliffs facing the sea is cut per- 
 pendicularly, and presents a clear viev/ of the internal structure of 
 the formation. 

" The ice, or lower layer, as far as it can be seen above the ground, 
 is from twenty to fifty feet thick, but is every year decreasing. In 
 the months of July, August, and September a considerable quantity 
 melts, which causes the downfall of the two upper layers, and gives 
 [p. 34] the whole a very confused aspect, by mixing together peat, 
 clay, plants, bones, and ice in a most disorderly manner. The ice 
 was thought by some of the earlier visitors to be only a superficial 
 coating; but this supposition was disproved in 1849, when enormous 
 portions were found to have separated from the main body, testifying 
 beyond a doubt that it formed part of a solid iceberg. Others, who 
 comprehended the real nature of this lower layer, endeavored to 
 explain its presence by assummg that the water of the surface pene- 
 trated through the peat and clay, gradually accumulated, changed 
 into a mass of ice, and thus caused the rising of the cliffs. This 
 hypothesis at first sight appears plausible, but if examined it falls 
 to the ground. In temperate climates we often find moorlands ris- 
 ing, like a sponge, in consequence of the mass of water which has 
 accumulated in them ; in Kotzebue Sound, however, where the soil is 
 always frozen at a depth of two or three feet from the surface, no 
 water can possibly sink to the depth of several fathoms, and conse- 
 quently no rising can take place. 

" The second or central layer varies in thickness from two to 
 twenty feet, and consists of alluvial clay intermingled with gravel, 
 sand, and fossil bones, the whole emitting the peculiar smell com- 
 mon in burial-places. In one spot was found some long black hair, 
 together with a quantity of light brown dust, evidently decomposed
