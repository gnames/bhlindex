animal matter. The fossils are sometimes of great size. In 1848 we 
 collected eight tusks of the antediluvian elephant, the largest of 
 which, though broken at the point, was eleven feet six inches long, 
 one foot nine [p. 35] inches in circumference at the base, and 
 weighed 243 lbs. Molar teeth, thigh-bones, ribs, and other frag- 
 ments of this gigantic animal, and a great number of horse and 
 deer bones, were disinterred. The species found in these cliiTs are 
 the mammoth {Elcphas priuiigenius), the fossil horse (Eqiiiis fos- 
 silis) . the moose-deer (Cerz'iis Alecs), the rein-deer (Ccn'iis Taran- 
 dus), fossil musk-ox (Oz'ibos inoschatiis). OT'ibos luaxiinus. fossil 
 bison {Bison prisciis f), the heavy-horned fossil bison {Bison crassi- 
 cornis), and the big-horn {Ovis nwntana). 

" The uppermost layer, or surface, is from two to five feet thick, 
 consisting of peat, entirely destitute of fossils. It bears the kind of 
 vegetation to which it owes its existence â€” plants peculiar to moor- 
 lands. Among them many mosses, lichens, sedges, and several 
 Ericacecc and willows may be recognized, the occurrence of which 
 demonstrates the possibility of the growth of plants in a soil frozen 
 beneath, a fact formerly much disputed. 

" As the ice could not have been formed by water percolating 
 through the clay and afterwards becoming frozen, it is natural to 
 conclude that it was in its present site previous to the arrival of the 
 clay. This conclusion is strengthened by the evidence afforded by 
 the clay itself, for the fossils are solely confined to that layer. If 
 these were indiscriminately distributed, we might be led to suppose 
 that the whole had undergone the same revolution : such not being 
 the case, we are forced to believe that the clay with its fossils arrived 
 after the ice had been firmly established, and, as these fossils belong 
 to the antediluvian period, the ice must be very old. 

" Dr. Richardson, with that accuracy for which he [p. 36] is 
 so distinguished, has in the ' Zoology of the Voyage of H. INI. S. 
 Herald ' described the bones collected by us, and prefaced his de- 
 scription by the following philosophical observations :

" The science of chemistry, as at present taught, justifies our 
 belief that animal substances, when solidly frozen and kept steadily 
 in a temperature below the freezing point, do not undergo putrefac- 
 tion, and may be preserved without change for any conceivable
