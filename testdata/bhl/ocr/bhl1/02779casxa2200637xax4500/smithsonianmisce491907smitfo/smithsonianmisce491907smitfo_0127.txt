Ice-beds on Eschscholtz Bay 99 

consolidated by the percolation and freezing of water, floats away 
 in form of an iceberg. In other situations the snow-cliffs remain 
 for a series of years, with occasional augmentation marked by cor- 
 responding dirt-bands, and disappear only towards the close of a 
 cycle of warm summers. In valleys haying a northern exposure and 
 sheltered by high hills from the sun's rays, the age of the snow may 
 be considerable ; but it is proper to say that though aged glaciers of 
 this description do exist on the shores of Spitzbergen and Greenland, 
 they are of very rare occurrence indeed on the continental coast of 
 America. The ice-cliff of Eschscholtz Bay may have had an origin 
 similar to that of the Greenland icebergs, and have been coated with 
 soil by a single or by successive operations. I find it difficult, how- 
 ever, to account for the introduction of the fossil remains in such 
 quantity, and can offer to the reader no conjecture on that point 
 that is satisfactory even to myself. The excellent state of preser- 
 vation of many of the bones, the recent decay of animal matter 
 shown by the existing odor, quantities of hair found in contact with 
 a mammoth's skull, the occurrence of the outer sheaths of bison 
 horns, and the finding of vertebras of bovine animals lying in their 
 proper order of sequence, render it probable that entire carcases were 
 there deposited and that congealation followed close upon their 
 entombment. A gradual improvement of climate in modern times 
 would appear to be necessary to account for the decay of the cliffs 
 now in progress and the exposure of the bones. The shallowness 
 of the water in Eschscholtz Bay, its narrowness, and its shelter from 
 seaward pressure by Choris Peninsula and Chamisso Island, preclude 
 the notion of icebergs coming with their cargoes from a distance 
 having been forced up on the beach at that place. Neither is it more 
 likely that the bones and diluvial matters were deposited in the 
 estuary of Buckland's River and subsequently elevated by one of the 
 earth waves by which geologists solve many of their difficulties, for 
 ice could not subsist long as a flooring of warmer water. In short, 
 further observations are still needed to form the foundations of a 
 plausible theory. 

" Dr. Goodridge describes the several cliffs in succession with 
 much detail, beginning with that next Elephant Point and proceed- 
 ing to the westward. His paper, though interesting throughout, is 
 too long for transcription entire, and I shall therefore merely abstract 
 the most material parts. He commences by stating that the unusu- 
 ally mild season had produced great landslides and exposed the 
 structure of the several eminences forming the cliffs more extensively 
 than in the year in which Captain Beechey visited them. Elephant
