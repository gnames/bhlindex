' I02 Smithsonian Exploration in Alaska in 1904 

Captain Beechey in 1826, on Chamisso Island, was perfectly sound 
 and fit for food when disinterred in 1848. It was disengaged with 
 much difficulty from the frozen subsoil, and even the iron hoops of 
 the cask were not rusted.' Dr. Goodridge appends to his paper 
 some remarks on the annual waste of the ice-cliffs, and says that the 
 bay is gradually filling up with the clay and soil which are precipi- 
 tated into the sea on the melting of the ice on which they are reposed. 

" Mr. Seemann reports the heads of porpoises and antlers of 
 reindeer were found on the beach, having been deposited there by 
 the natives. 

" Captain Kellett, in answer to some queries I addressed to him, 
 informed me that the ice-clififs were in many places as much as sixty 
 feet high, and of pure ice. He did not think that the ice extended 
 inland as far as the range of hills, though on digging at a distance 
 of a quarter of a mile from the edge of the cliff he found pure ice 
 under a covering of between three or four feet of soil. In no 
 instance were the fossils imbedded in the ice, but they generally lay 
 on its surface, the large tusks showing through the soil. Many 
 were gathered from the mud at the base of the cliffs, where they 
 were exposed to the wash of the tide. In digging within the Arctic 
 Circle to erect marks he always found the soil frozen at a depth of 
 two feet. â€” Such are the chief particulars that I collected from the 
 three officers quoted above. The naturalist who wishes to study the 
 subject more deeply will find several opinions discussed in Dr. Buck- 
 land's Appendix to Captain Beechey's Voyage, as already men- 
 tioned."

" Glacial Fonnatioiis and Fossils at Elephant Point 

"On the i6th (July, 1880), I visited Elephant Point, about 
 fifteen miles distant, on Eschscholtz Bay, near the mouth of the 
 Buckland River. This place is remarkable for a singular ice for- 
 mation, which Kotzebue described as ' a glacier covered with soil 
 six inches thick, producing the most luxuriant grass, and contain- 
 ing abundance of mammoth bones.' Captain Beechey, of the Royal 
 Navy, while cruising in the Arctic in 1826-27, claims to have fully 
 established the fact that Kotzebue was mistaken ; that what he 
 called a ' glacier ' was occasioned either by the water from the 
 thawing ice and snow tricklinsf down the surface of the earthv cliff
