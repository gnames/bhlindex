Ice-beds on Eschscholtz Bay 105 

" About half a mile from the sea, on the highest part of the 
 ridge, perhaps two hundred and fifty feet above high-water mark, 
 at a depth of a foot, we came to a soUdly frozen stratum, consisting 
 chiefly of bog moss and vegetable mould, but containing good- 
 sized lumps of clear ice. There seemed no reason to doubt that 
 an extension of the digging would have brought us to solid, clear 
 ice, such as was visible at the face of the bluff below. That is to 
 say, it appeared that the ridge itself, two miles wide and two hun- 
 dred and fifty feet high, was chiefly composed of solid ice overlaid 
 with clay and vegetable mould. It was noticeable that there was 
 much less clay over the top of the upper ice-face than was visible 
 over the lower one, or over the single face when there was but one 
 and the land and bluff were low near the beach. There also seemed 
 to be less vegetable matter. Near the beach six or eight feet of clay 
 were observed in some places, without counting what might be 
 considered as talus matter from further up the hillside. In one 
 place only did we notice a little fine, reddish gravel, and nowhere in 
 the talus or strata any stones. 

" The ice-face near the beach w-as not uniform. In many places 
 it was covered with clay to the water's edge. In others, where the 
 bank was less than ten feet high, the turf had bent without breaking 
 after being undermined, and presented a mossy and herbaceous 
 front, curving over quite to high-water mark. 

" The ice in general had a semi-stratified appearance, as if it 
 still retained the horizontal plane in which it originally congealed. 
 The surface was always soiled by dirty water from the earth above. 
 This dirt was, however, merely superficial. The outer inch or two 
 of the ice seemed granular, like compacted hail, and was sometimes 
 whitish. The inside was solid and transparent, or slightly yellow- 
 tinged, like peat water, but never greenish or bluish like glacier ice. 
 But in many places the ice presented the aspect of immense cakes 
 or fragments, irregularly disposed, over which it appeared as if 
 the clay, etc., had been deposited. Small pinnacles of ice ran up 
 into the clay in some places, and, above, holes were seen in the 
 face of the clay-bank, where it looked as if a detached fragment of 
 ice had been and had been melted out, leaving its mold in the clay 
 quite perfect. 

" In other places the ice was penetrated with deep holes, into 
 which the clay and vegetable matter had been deposited in layers, 
 and which (the ice melting away from around them) appeared as 
 clay and muck cylinders on the ice-face. Large rounded holes or 
 excavations of irregular form had evidently existed on the top of
