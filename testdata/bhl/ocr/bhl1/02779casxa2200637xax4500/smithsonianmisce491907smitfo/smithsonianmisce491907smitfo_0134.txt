io6 Smithsonian Exploration in Alaska in 1904 

the ice before the clay, etc., had been deposited. These were 
 usually filled with a finer-grained deposit of clay with less vege- 
 table matter, and the layers were waved, as if the deposit had been 
 afifected by current action while going on. 

" In these places was noticed, especially, the most unexpected 
 fact connected with the whole formation, namely, a strong peculiar 
 smell, as of rotting animal matter, burnt leather, and stable manure 
 combined. This odor was not confined to the spots above men- 
 tioned, and was not quite the same at all places, but had the same 
 general character wherever it was noticed. A large part of the 
 clay had no particular smell. At the places where the odor was 
 strongest, it was observed to emanate particularly from darker, pasty 
 spots in the clay (though permeating elsewhere), leading to the 
 supposition that these might be remains of the soft parts of the 
 mammoth and other animals, whose bones are daily washed out by 
 the sea from the clay talus. 

" At or near these spots, where the odor was strongest, a rusty, 
 red lichen, or lichen-like fungus, grew on the wet clay of the talus 
 in extensive patches. Some of these, of the bad smelling deposit, 
 and as many bones of the mammoth, fossil buffalo, etc., as we could 
 carry were secured. These included a mammoth tusk, with both 
 ends gone, but still five and a half feet long and six inches in 
 diameter, which I shall forward to the office. Dwarf birches, alders, 
 seven or eight feet high, with stems three inches in diameter, and a 
 luxuriant growth of herbage, including numerous very toothsome 
 berries, grew with the roots less than a foot from perpetual solid ice. 

" The formation of the surrounding country shows no high land 
 or rocky hills, from which a glacier might have been derived and 
 then covered with debris from their sides. The continuity of the 
 mossy surface showed that the ice must be quite destitute of mo- 
 tion, and the circumstances appeared to point to one conclusion, 
 that there is here a ridge of solid ice, rising several hundred feet 
 above the sea, and higher than any of the land about it, and older 
 than the mammoth and fossil horse ; this ice taking upon itself the 
 functions of a regular stratified rock. The formation, though 
 visited before, has not hitherto been intelligibly described from a 
 geological standpoint. Though many facts may remain to be in- 
 vestigated, and whatever be the conclusions as to its origin and 
 mode of preservation, it certainly remains one of the most wonder- 
 ful and puzzling geological phenomena in existence. 

" On the 3d of September we sailed from Chamisso Harbor for 
 Berine Strait. * * -^ "
