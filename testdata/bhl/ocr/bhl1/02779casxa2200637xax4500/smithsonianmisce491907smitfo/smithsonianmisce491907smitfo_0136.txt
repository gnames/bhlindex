stroyed and tall grasses spring up on the fresh mehow ground as 
 it accumulates from time to time,, growing lush and rank, though in 
 many places that we noted these new soil-beds are not more than a 
 foot in depth, and lie on the solid ice."

"At meridian of the 7th (Sept., 1881) we steamed over to Ele- 
 phant Point, and came to anchor off the remarkable ice formation 
 for which that place is celebrated. During the afternoon, accom- 
 panied by Messrs. Muir and Nelson, I went on shore to make an 
 examination of the ice-cliff. In my report of the cruise of the Cor- 
 win in 1880, I made mention of this phenomenon : 

" We spent several days in the vicinity of Elephant Point examin- 
 ing this and smaller ice formations which were discovered by our 
 exploring parties from day to day; and although it is not claimed 
 that all doubt is set at rest on this subject, we can safely assert that 
 the large quantity of ice known to be here precludes the possibility 
 of Beechey's explanation being the true one. Several hundred feet 
 back from the edge of the cliff, at a place where a cave had occurred, 
 caused by a small stream of running water, we found ice clear and 
 solid. Ice appears in the face of the cliff in several places, but that 
 discovered by Kotzebue is much the larger. This is about half a 
 mile in length, and although its exact width is not known, it may 
 safely be assumed to be not less than 300 feet. At about 400 feet 
 back from the edge of the cliff the ground rises quite abruptly for 
 80 or 100 feet, and changes froin the springy, mossy covering to a 
 solid mass of earth and stones, and in several places large bosses of 
 lichen-covered granite are exposed to view. Although but two feet 
 beneath the surface, in no place is ice exposed on the top. The layer 
 of mossy turf covers it as evenly as if laid on by man to protect it 
 from the sun's rays. That it owes its existence now to this covering 
 of moss I have no doubt, but its origin is not so clear. The grass 
 referred to by Kotzebue grows along the edge of the cliff, and on 
 all irregularities on the face of the ice where the soil from above has 
 been undermined by the melting and falling over, has lodged. Con- 
 sidering its cold foundation and the shortness of the season, the 
 growth of this grass is almost phenomenal. Specimens collected 
 by us, growing on a mere handful of soil on the very face of the ice 
 cliff, were 4 feet long, and when dry emitted the fragrant odor of 
 fresh, new hay.
