no Smithsonian Exploration in Alaska in 1904 

" While making investigations in the vicinity of Elephant Point, 
 Mr. Nelson discovered the remains of a beaver dam at one end of 
 the ice clifif, which gave rise to a great deal of speculation and dis- 
 cussion on board as to whether this particular body of ice was not 
 originally a lake ; and indeed, considering the habits of the beaver, 
 it is difficult to account for the presence of this dam upon any other 
 hypothesis. The dam was in a good state of preservation, the wood 
 plainly showing the marks of the animals' teeth. It is readily seen 
 how the land forming the north shore of the lake may have been 
 washed away, and the ice exposed, by the water from the Buckland 
 and other rivers, which discharge into Eschscholtz Bay. The shal- 
 lowness of the bay, and the difference in the height of the cliff, on 
 its opposite sides, show that a large amount of washing away has 
 taken place. The moss and grass covering the surface of the ice are 
 also easily accounted for. The germs are readily transported from 
 the surrounding hills by small streams on the surface, snow-slides, 
 high winds, etc. It is of a parasitic and very rapid growth, covering 
 the most barren ground in a short time, even the dry hard surface 
 of volcanic rock, and that it readily thrives on the ice is shown by 
 the luxuriant growth found by us on every projecting point on the 
 face of the ice-cliffs. Kotzebue was undoubtedly in error in sup- 
 posing that the fossil remains of animals found in the vicinity were 
 imbedded in the cliff". I examined them carefully each season and 
 saw no signs of animal remains of any kind, while on shore; below 
 high-water mark, we found them in abundance. They were not 
 confined to the locality of the cliff, but extended each way as far as 
 our investigation reached. They evidently came from the Buckland 
 River, and were brought down by the drifting ice in the spring. 
 The other rivers emptying into Kotzebue Sound contain large num- 
 bers of them, as also those emptying into Norton Sound. The 
 natives assured us that large beds of these bones were to be found 
 in the rivers but a few miles inland. Many of the tusks found in 
 America up to the present time are very much decayed from expo- 
 sure, but it is probable that by digging into the frozen earth they 
 would be found in a perfect state. Our half-breed interpreter, 
 Andrew, claimed to have seen large quantities in the bed of a 
 stream which he discovered while on an overland trading voyage 
 from Norton Sound to Kotzebue Sound the previous winter. He 
 said he had taken a small piece on his sled and brought it down 
 near the coast, but finding that it, was overloading his dogs, he threw 
 it off and left it. Some of our men accompanied him to the spot 
 and found a portion of a small tusk in a perfect state of preservation.
