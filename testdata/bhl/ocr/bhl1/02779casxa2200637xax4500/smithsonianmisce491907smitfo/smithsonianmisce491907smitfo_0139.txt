Ice-beds on Eschscholtz Bay hi 

The bones are found generally in the bed of rivers or in the alluvial 
 deposits near their mouths. Many theories have been advanced to 
 account for the accumulation of these bones, and by some writers 
 it was supposed that the animals may have died in large numbers 
 when in herds, but it is altogether likely that the remains were 
 brought together by the action of the thousands of small streams of 
 water formed by the melting snow, which everywhere flood the 
 tundras in the spring. In this way they are carried to the larger 
 rivers, and by them swept down, until by the widening of the river 
 and the consequent decrease of the strength of the current they 
 become stationary and are in time buried in the alluvium." 

Hooper prolongs his text with a series of disconnected compiled 
 remarks concerning the mammoth in general. Concerning Cape 
 Blossom he remarks, pages 39 : " It presents seaward a sheer cliff, 
 which was described by Beechey as having an ice formation similar 
 to that at Elephant Point. Although I visited this place several 
 times during my two cruises, yet I saw no signs of ice against the 
 face of the cliff like that at Elephant Point, which remains the same 
 from year to year." 

Fortunately this account may be materially supplemented from the 
 personal notes of Mr. E. W. Nelson who has generously placed his 
 private journal, with drawings, in the writer's hands. 

September 7, 1881. " We steamed up opposite the bluff" on Ele- 
 phant Point. The water shoaled so we were forced to anchor in two 
 and three quarters fathoms. The bluff was found to be one hun- 
 dred and forty feet high and to be made up of ice and clay along its 
 face for about three miles. The lower ice frequently presents a 
 shelving projection under which the water at high tide (the rise and 
 fall at the time of our visit being about three feet) had eaten fifteen 
 to twenty feet. This exposure of ice slopes up and has its upper 
 surface hidden by an inclined bank of sod and soil fallen from the 
 terrace above. This sloping bank, covered with a luxuriant mass 
 of vegetation, mainly grass two to four feet high interspersed with 
 thrifty alder bushes, ends sharply against a more or less abruptly 
 rising wall of ice five to twenty feet high forming the brow of the 
 bluff. Over this upper ice is a layer from a foot to three or four 
 feet of vegetable humus and peat upon which is a rank growth of 
 grass. This surface ascends back and up gradually a few hundred 
 yards or less to meet a slope rising at a much greater angle that 
 extends up to the rounded summits of hills that continue into the 
 interior.
