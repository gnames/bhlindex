" All along the shore in this locality a peculiar odor from the mass 
 of decomposing vegetable miatter exposed fills the air. This was 
 more noticeable where the decaying vegetation in the clay was more 
 abundant. 

" Toward the eastern end of the face of the bluff on a slightly pro- 
 jecting point I found an old beaver house inbedded in the earth with 
 two feet of vegetable humus on top of it. It was exposed in section 
 by the crumbling of the bank. 

" The base of the nest rested on an alder seven inches in diameter 
 at the butt and the rest of the heap was composed of alder sticks one- 
 half to three or four inches in diameter from six inches to five or 
 six feet long. Nearly all of the smaller sticks had their bark eaten 
 off and manv still retained the marks of the teeth. All showed the
