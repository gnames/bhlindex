 on the Kowak River. By Lieut. J. C. CantwelL] 

" The Kowak River rises in the northwestern part of Alaska, and 
 after a tortuous easterly course of about 550 miles, the greater por- 
 tion of which is within the Arctic Circle, it flows into Hotham Inlet, 
 a large body of fresh water opening into Kotzebue Sound. During 
 the summer of 1884-85 it was my good fortune to visit this region 
 and to make a reconnaissance of the stream from its mouth to its 
 headwaters. Among the many novel and interesting features of the 
 region, which had never previously been visited by w^hite men, none 
 w^ere more striking than a remarkable series of ice-cliffs observed 
 along the banks of the river about 80 miles from its mouth. These 
 deposits of ice were first seen in some of the low silt banks of the 
 delta, and it was supposed that they were the result of the spring 
 freshets in the river forcing large masses of ice into the soft, yield- 
 ing soil of the banks. But when on our emerging from the delta, 
 and reaching the higher land of the interior we still found these 
 ice deposits in the form of clifs, from 80 to 150 feet high, the theory 
 of current formation had to be abandoned. The banks of the 
 stream in the region where the ice-cliffs are found are not all filled 
 with ice. and the water marks on those which are composed only of 
 soil and rock show beyond question that the water has never reached 
 a sufficiently high stage to have transported the ice to its present 
 position. 

"At two points the cliffs attain an altitude of over 150 feet, and 
 one cliff measured by sextant angles showed 185 feet. The tops of 
 all the cliffs were superposed by a layer of black, silt-like soil from 6 
 to 8 feet thick, and from this springs a luxuriant growth of mosses, 
 grass, and the characteristic arctic shrubbery, consisting for the 
 most part of willow, alder, and berry bushes, and a dense forest of 
 spruce trees from 50 to 80 feet high and from 4 to 8 inches in 
 diameter. 

" Where the face of the cliffs was towards the south the upper 
 portion of the formation would be found undergoing the process 
 of destruction under the melting action of the sun's rays, while in 
 other situations the erosion of the river current was constantly un- 
 dermining the cliffs. Both of these destructive agents caused great 
 masses of soil and tree-laden ice to become detached and fall into 
 the stream, ^^'here the retreating waters of spring had left these
