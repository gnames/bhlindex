Ice-Cliffs on the Kobuk River 117 

masses of detached ice stranded on the adjacent beaches or bars, 
 piles of soft dust ahiiost entirely free from any gritty substance 
 would be left as a monument to mark the spot where the ice had 
 been melted by the summer sun. These small dust heaps are a 
 characteristic feature of the region where the ice-clififs are found 
 and are entirely different in appearance from the gravel and sand 
 heaps deposited in the same way by ice floated down from the upper 
 river. 

" An examination of the tops of the ice-cliffs was very difficult on 
 account of the dense undergrowth and the thick carpet of moss, but 
 on one we discovered a lake about a mile in diameter and situated 
 some 500 yards from the face of the cliff. The water in this lake 
 was fresh and clear, but upon being disturbed became exceedingly 
 turbid, owing to the presence of a large quantity of fine, decayed 
 vegetable matter on the bottom. A piece of the ice melted showed 
 a residuum of fine, impalpable dust, which under a lens proved to 
 be composed mainly of vegetable matter and, while fresh, emitted a 
 very pungent, disagreeable odor. 

" The country in this region is mostly rolling tundra plains, with 
 innumerable small lakes, and streams, all of which are tributary to 
 the larger river. There is no evidence of glacial action whatever, 
 and it is not until the first mountain range is reached, a hundred 
 miles further up-stream, that any rocks in situ are seen. Here and 
 further inland more plainly are to be found beds of trap, which on 
 examination shows to be a pronounced olivine diabase, with such 
 minerals as hornblende, mica, feldspar, augite, etc., present. Other 
 rock forms show unmistakable evidence of the eruptive agencies 
 that have been at work in the formation of the upper river region. 
 The formation of the remarkable ice-cliffs in the lower country is, 
 however, a geological nut which the writer admits his inability to 
 crack."
