I. Introduction. 

In 1903 I submitted to the Smithsonian Institution an account of 
 some researches on the Hquefaction of air and hydrogen which I had 
 carried out with the aid of a grant from the Hodgkins Fund. Since 
 then, with the aid of a further grant from the same source, I have 
 extended these investigations, and have obtained the results which are 
 recorded in the following pages. 

I may state at the outset that I have been obliged to confine my 
 attention mainly to points of practical interest. After completing the 
 first section of my work I began to make preparations for the complete 
 investigation of the process of liquefying gases by the self-intensive 
 process, and, in conjunction with Professor R. A. Lehfeldt, commenced 
 a research on the determination of the Joule-Thomson effect for gases 
 over a wide range of temperature and pressure. My removal to Bris- 
 tol prevented me from continuing to participate in this work, which 
 Professor Lehfeldt is now completing. My work was also consider- 
 ably retarded by the fact that a compressor and air liquefier, which 
 had been purchased by the Bristol University College shortly before 
 my appointment, was found to be practically worthless, and only after 
 the compressor had been completely reconstructed and a new air lique- 
 fier had been built, could any research be undertaken. With the means 
 al my disposal this work occupied more than a year.

 Before going further I will make one or two remarks as to state- 
 ments in my last paper. In calculating the quantity of the liquid pro-
