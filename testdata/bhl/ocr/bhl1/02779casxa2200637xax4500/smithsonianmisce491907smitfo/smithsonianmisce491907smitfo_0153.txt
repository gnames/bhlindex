and with the valve below. The doubling of the coil was intended to 
 diminish any tendency on the part of the pipe to become blocked with 
 impurity separated from the gas, and to reduce friction in the pipe, 
 and so increase the pressure at the expansion valve. These precau- 
 tions are, as a matter of fact, totally unnecessary. 

The results obtained with this liquefier were far from satisfactory, 
 and a careful study of its behaviour showed that the fault lay entirely 
 in the regenerator coil. It was evident that the preliminary cooling 
 of the compressed gas was as complete as in the case of my first ma- 
 chine, probably even more so ; but that the heat-interchange between 
 the compressed and expanded hydrogen in the regenerator coil was 
 unsatisfactory. Careful consideration of the problem soon led to an 
 explanation of the inefficiency of the second regenerator coil, and it is 
 this point I shall next discuss. 

The phenomena connected with the interchange of heat between 
 fluids in motion has been studied chiefly with a view to applying the 
 results to steam boiler problems. Osborne, Reynolds, Stanton, and 
 others have shown that when currents of water are made to flow in 
 opposite directions through concentric tubes, the change of tempera- 
 ture is independent of the velocity of the streams, or that the heat- 
 interchange is proportional to the relative velocities. The same re- 
 marks apply to the change of temperature and loss of heat by furnace 
 gases in passing through boiler tubes ; and to show how closely the 
 phenomena of heat regeneration in gas liquefiers resembles those I 
 have just referred to, it is sufficient to state that in the Hampson air 
 liquefier the difiference between the temperatures of the air which enters 
 and leaves the apparatus shows the same dift'erence of temperature 
 even when the velocity of the stream of air passing through it is greatly 
 increased. 

It is also well known that the loss of heat that furnace gases un- 
 dergo is considerably diminished if the absolute velocity of the gas be 
 decreased. It can be shown, for instance, that by increasing the diam- 
 eter of the tubes of an ordinary boiler, or by spacing the tubes of a 
 water-tube boiler more widely the heat interchange between the gases 
 and the water may be considerably reduced. 

Were it possible to consider the phenomenon of heat interchange 
 between two fluids moving in opposite directions on different sides of 
 a conducting surface one of conduction of heat through the fluid, the 
 study of it would be a comparatively simple matter. As a matter of 
 fact, however, this is the case only when the fluids were travelling 
 slowly, and on account of the low conductivity of gases the heat inter- 
 change is, under such circumstances, very small. When, however, the 
 velocity of the fluid bears a certain relationship to the dimensions of 
 the space through which it is flowing, the longitudinal components into
