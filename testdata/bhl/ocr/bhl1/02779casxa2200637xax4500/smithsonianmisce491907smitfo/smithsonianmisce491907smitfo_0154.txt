4 THE ATTAINMENT OF VERY LOW TEMPERATURES 

which we may theoretically divide the stream no longer form straight 
 lines, but break up into eddies. As the result of this the heat passes 
 more rapidly from the gas to the surface in contact with it, or vice 
 versa, than it does when the " stream line " flow is maintained. It has 
 been stated that for the efficient working of a boiler both the furnace 
 gases and the water must " scrub " the surface separating them. 

The formation of eddies in a fluid depends upon its velocity, viscos- 
 ity, density and on the form of the aperture through which it is flow- 
 ing. The greater the velocity when once the " critical velocity " is 
 passed, the greater the tendency to form eddies, which also increase 
 as the space through which the gas is flowing diminishes. Further, 
 it is well known that when a gas strikes against a sharp edge or angu- 
 lar obstacle eddies are formed much more readily than when the stream 
 of gas meets a curved surface. 

The difference of the behaviour of the two regenerator coils re- 
 ferred to on page 2 may now be explained. The first coil consisted 
 of a single copper tube, so that the velocity of the compressed gas flow- 
 ing through it was twice as great as that of the gas in the second coil, 
 each component of which was half the length. Further, since it was 
 impossible to wind the double coil as closely as the single coil, the 
 velocity of the expanded gas passing over the outside of the pipes was 
 greater in the case of the first coil than in that of the second. As the 
 tendency to form eddies in the gas increases with the velocity, particu- 
 larly when the stream passes through narrow openings, such as exist 
 between the flat spirals of the coil, it is not surprising that the efficiency 
 of the second coil was lower than that of the first. 

I was fortunately able to test this theory by means of trials carried 
 out on two air liquefiers of the Hampson type. In one of these two 
 copper tubes were wound together to form the regenerator coil, and 
 in the other four copper pipes of the same diameter were similarly 
 wound. The difference in the behaviour of the two liquefiers, which 
 were otherwise identical, under exactly similar conditions was suffi- 
 ciently marked to prove my point. The two-coil liquefier gave from 
 2 to 3 per cent, more liquid air than the four-coil liquefier, and whereas 
 in the first case the difference between the temperatures of the air as 
 it entered and left the apparatus was 0.4°, it rose in the second case 
 to 1.4°. 

It appeared, therefore, that in constructing regenerator coils the 
 pipe should have as small an internal diameter as is possible, and that 
 the coil should be closely wound. It is practically impossible to use 
 copper tube of a diameter less than 2 mm. inside and 3.5 mm. outside 
 on account of the mechanical difficulties which arise in joining the 
 sections, and in winding the coil. The spacing of the spirals is theoret- 
 ically limited by the fact that the glass vacuum-vessel enclosing the
