 I have, however, found it to be mechanically impossible to wind 
 the spirals too closely. 

It is practically impossible to further increase the rate at which

ceeded in increasing the refrigerating efficiency of the expanded gas 
 as it passes over the outside of the coils. 

I have already referred to the fact that when a stream of gas passes 
 across the edge of a plate at right angles to its path, or enters or leaves 
 an orifice with square-cut edges, eddies are formed as in the figure i. 
 It occurred to me that by placing sheets of perforated vulcanized fibre 
 between the horizontal spirals, which make up the coil, such eddies 
 would be set up in the gas, and that the jets of gas passing through 
 the holes would themselves form eddies both by their mutual action, 
 and by impinging on the copper coils. Such an arrangement would 
 be much more effective in overcoming the tendency of the gas to flow 
 in streams, parted rather than broken up by the curved surface of the 
 pipes. Further, the fibre being a highly non-conducting material 
 would insulate the adjacent sections of the regenerator coil, and thereby 
 increase its efficiency. 

In the early part of the year 1904 I constructed two similar regen- 
 erator coils, each 20 cm. long and 7.2 cm. in diameter, wound about 
 a tube I cm. in diameter, surrounding the valve rod. One of the coils,
