the air liquefied. To determine the temperature gradient in the coil 
 the ends of thermo-electric junctions, carefully insulated, were placed 
 at the top of the coil, near the valve, and at two points equi-distant 
 from the end and well within the coil. Copper-constantan junctions 
 were used; the potential difference between each of the junctions in 
 the coil and a junction immersed in ice was measured by the usual 
 potentiometer method ; the results were interpreted with the aid of

The exact arrangement of the apparatus is shown in figure 3. The 
 regenerator coil A was completely enclosed within the vacuum vessel 
 B, the space between the coil and the glass wall of the vessel being 
 carefully filled with flannel, which was wound in thin strips round the 
 former. The brass tube C surrounding the valve rod D, the supply 
 pipe G from the compresser, and the tube H through which the ex- 
 panded air escaped, were soldered into a brass cap F which was con- 
 nected with the vacuum vessel bv means of the rubber sleeve K. The 

'Bradley and Hale (loc. cit.), working independently, obtained similar results 
 for a Hampson machine with two coaxial coils. They used platinum resistance 
 thermometers inserted between the coils.
