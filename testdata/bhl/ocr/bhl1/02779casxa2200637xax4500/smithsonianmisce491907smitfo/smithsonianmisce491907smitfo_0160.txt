expected, the efificiency decreases slightly in proportion as the mass- 
 flow of the air increases. The temperature measurements indicate, 
 however, that the gradient in the lower part of the coil is practically 
 independent of the quantity of air passing through it, though the tem- 
 perature difference at the exit became slightly greater. Bradley and 
 Rowe (he. cit.) arrive at a similar result. 

IV. Application of These Results to the Construction of a 
 New Air Liquefier. 

The result of these experiments seemed to show that the introduc- 
 tion of the vulcanized fibre discs increases the rate of heat interchange 
 in the upper part of the coil, where the temperature difference between 
 the two streams of gas is comparatively small, but is non-effective so 
 far as the lower third at least is concerned. 

The lower part of the liquefier which I constructed is arranged as 
 in figure 3, but in place of the cap there is a metal cylinder filled with 
 a coil constructed of two pipes coaxially. This part of the coil is 25 
 centimetres long and 10 centimetres in diameter. The cylinder enclos- 
 ing it is secured to the vacuum vessel by means of a rubber sleeve, and 
 is enclosed in a wooden casing filled with animal wool. 

The results obtained with it have been quite satisfactory. The 
 temperature difference at the inlet and outlet is smaller than can be 
 measured, and the yield of liquid air is, within the limits of experi- 
 mental error, as high as has been obtained with any liquefier.

V. The Effect of Initial Pressure on the Efficiency of a 

Liquefier. 
 I had intended to carry out experiments with a view to investigat- 
 ing the process from this point of view if results had not already been

 The difference is well within the limits of experimental error.
