12 THE ATTAINMENT OF VERY LOW TEMPERATURES 

low pressure by opening the expansion valve wide, in which case there 
 is a steady fall in pressure throughout the length of the coil, a very 
 much smaller yield of liquid is obtained than when the valve is kept 
 partially closed and supply of air is reduced. It appears that though 
 a slight fall of pressure in the gas between the top of the coil and 
 the expansion valve does not materially effect the working of the 
 machine, it is a factor which cannot be neglected in estimating its 
 efficiency. 

VI. Application of the Perforated Discs to the Hydrogen 

LiQUEFIER. 

I now constructed a hydrogen liquefier, of which the regenerator 
 coil A, with the perforated discs, formed part. This machine did not, 
 however, yield satisfactory results, for though I obtained some liquid 
 hydrogen by means of it, the yield was poor. I may add, however, 
 that the liquefaction commenced very soon after the gas was first al- 
 lowed to expand. Further, experiments conducted with compressed 
 air, of which it is not necessary to give the details, pointed to the fact 
 that the conduction of heat down the coil was considerably decreased 
 by the introduction of the perforated discs. 

The probable explanation of the behaviour of this coil is as follows. 
 The effect of the discs in producing eddy currents increases the rate 
 of heat interchange, so long as the temperature difference between the 
 compressed and expanded gas is not very great, thus increasing the 
 rate at which the coil cools down at the commencement of the experi- 
 ment. When, however, the temperature of the expanded gas reaches 
 the liquefaction point (20.5Â° abs.), the temperature of the compressed 
 gas is still above the critical temperature, and we arrive at a condition 
 similar to that which obtains in the lower part of the coil of an air 
 liquefier. It appears then that the effect of the perforated discs in 
 shielding the coils from contact with the expanded gas is greater than 
 in increasing the eddying and thereby the rate of heat interchange. 

VII. Final Form of Hydrogen Liquefier. 

In reviewing my experiments with the hydrogen liquefier I am 
 driven to the conclusion that the form of regenerator coil used in the 
 construction of my first machine gave better results than any which 
 I afterwards obtained. In this machine the coil was constructed of 
 a single tube wound into a coil 150 mm. long and 50 mm. in diameter, 
 the spaces between the components of each helix being as narrow as 
 possible. 

It appears that the small diameter of the coil and the closeness of 
 the spacing are more effective in producing a rapid heat interchange,
