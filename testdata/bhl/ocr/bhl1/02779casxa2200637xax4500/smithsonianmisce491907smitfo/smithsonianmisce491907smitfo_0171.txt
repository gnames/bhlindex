INTRODUCTORY NOTE. 

The North Pacific Exploring Expedition was sent out by the 
 Navy Department under an appropriation from Congress in 1852, 
 for "building or purchase of suitable vessels, and for prosecuting a 
 survey and reconnaissance, for naval and commercial purposes, of 
 such parts of Behring Straits, of the North Pacific Ocean, and the 
 China seas, as are frequented by American whale-ships, and by 
 trading vessels in their routes between the United States and China." 
 The expedition set sail in June, 1853, and returned in 1856. Captain 
 C. Ringgold, U. S. N., was placed in command, but, being recalled 
 to the United States in 1854, he was superseded by Captain John 
 Rodgers, U. S. N. William Stimpson acted as zoologist. After 
 leaving Norfolk the five vessels in service touched at Madeira, and 
 then proceeded to Hongkong via the Cape of Good Hope. On this 
 passage the sloop "Vincennes" and the brig "Porpoise" took the 
 more southerly route to Van Diemens Land, thence through the 
 Coral Seas, and by the Caroline, Tadrone, and Bashee Islands, while 
 the steamer "John Hancock" and the other two vessels of the fleet 
 traversed the straits of Sunda and Caspar, the Carimata and Billeton 
 passages, and the Sooloo Sea. Subsequently the expedition ad- 
 vanced northward, continuing work along the coasts of Japan and 
 Kamchatka, in Bering Strait, on the coast of California, and at 
 Tahiti, returning around the Cape of Good Hope. 

Of the vast collections obtained, it was estimated that the Crus- 
 tacea numbered 980 species. 

A few years after his return to the United States, Dr. William 
 Stimpson became director of the Chicago Academy of Sciences, and 
 moved to that place nearly all of the invertebrate material obtained 
 by the expedition and belonging to the United States Government. 
 Several preliminary papers had been prepared and published by him^ 
 in the Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadel- 
 phia, when the collections with notes and drawings were destroyed by 
 the memorable fire, in 1871.- In a statement of losses sustained,^ Dr.
