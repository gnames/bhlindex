4 SMITHSONIAN MISCELLANEOUS COLLECTIONS 

Stimpson enumerated the manuscript and drawings of the final 
 report on the Crustacea Brachyura and Anomura. After his death, 
 in 1872, however, this report was discovered at the Navy Depart- 
 ment, and was sent to the Smithsonian Institution, where it has re- 
 mained to the present time unpublished.^ 

In the meantime there are few students of the higher Crustacea 
 who have not felt the need of more light on those rare genera and 
 species known only from brief Latin diagnoses. 

The following report has been treated as an historical document, 
 and is published substantially as it was written by the author, the 
 only additions being the references to his preliminary descriptions 
 and the footnotes giving the current or accepted name where it dif- 
 fers from that used by Dr. Stimpson. It is hoped that the value of 
 the descriptions will more than compensate for the antiquated 
 nomenclature. 

Numbers corresponding to those in the preliminary papers have 
 been placed before each species for read}- reference. The illustra- 
 tions are from pencil drawings made, it is supposed, by Dr. Stimpson 
 himself. 

The many gaps in the illustrations and the absence from text or 
 figures of any reference to the family Rhizopidse are attributable to 
 the withdrawal of these parts by Dr. Stimpson.
