Among a large number of examples of this species collected by 
 the expedition, there are two adult males which differ so much in 
 the size and character of the chelopoda from the specimens ordi- 
 narily found, and those hitherto figured and described, that they 
 might well be taken for a distinct species. The carapax of one of 
 these specimens is i inch long and 0.85 inch broad. Proportion of 
 breadth to length, 1:1.17. The chelopoda are large and robust, 
 1.8 inches in length. Plands much inflated; fingers gaping pos- 
 teriorly ; movable one with a large tooth at its inner base. 

In nine-tenths of the male specimens taken, many of which are at 
 least two-thirds as large as that above described, the hands are slen- 
 der and weak, like those of the female ; this (immature) form is that 
 represented by Guerin's figure. In the sterile females, which oc- 
 curred in equal numbers with the ordinary females and the males, 
 the abdomen is flattened and only two-thirds as wide as the sternum. 

In all of our specimens the prseorbital tooth is very small ; the 
 orbits are interrupted above by two deep fissures, and below by one 
 wide fissure divided into two by a small tooth. The projections of
