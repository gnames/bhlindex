CRUSTACEA NORTH PACIFIC EXPLORING EXPEDITION 7 

grooved above, as is usual in the genus. The arrangement of the 
 orbits and antennae is as usual. There is a small spine at the ex- 
 terior base of the basal article of the external antennae; another 
 larger one at the anterior angle of the buccal area, and a small one 
 between this latter and the large pterygostomian tooth. The ptery- 
 gostomian region is depressed, but not channeled. There are two 
 sharp tubercles on the sternum between the bases of the feet of the 
 second pair. The feet generally are long and slender ; those of the 
 second pair more than twice as long as the carapax ; chelopoda of 
 very small size, slightly villous, with a few scattered long hairs. 
 Finger and thumb denticulated within and contiguous for the ter- 
 minal half their length. Abdomen of male seven-articulate, narrow- 
 ing rather abruptly at the fourth segment ; there is a protuberance on 
 the second segment. 

The body is of a dirty yellowish or hay color, mottled with black. 
 Feet annulated with orange. Dimensions (spines included) : Length 
 of carapax, 0.95 ; width, 1.02 ; proportion, i : 1.07 ; length of a foot of 
 the second pair, 2.2 inches. 

It resembles D. miiricata Edw., but has no visible spines on the 
 branchial regions, and the feet of the second pair are more than 
 twice as long as the body. The two lateral spines are much longer 
 than in D. rissonii. 

It was found in considerable numbers in the vicinity of Hong- 
 kong, China, occurring in 20 fathoms, gravelly mud, outside of the 
 passages, and in 6 fathoms, mud, in some of the inner bays.

This species is remarkable for the depressed pterygostomian chan- 
 nels just without the maxillipeds. The whole surface, with the ex- 
 ception of the tips of the tarsi and the fingers, is covered with a 
 dense villous coat concealing all but a few of the more prominent 
 spines. The interregional groove and the spines and tubercles of 
 the carapax are in number and position nearly the same as in D. 
 gracilipes, except that there is an intermediate tubercle between the 
 genital and cardiac spines. The terminal posterior spine is very 
 slender, somewhat curving upward, and in length a little more than 
 one-tenth that of the carapax. The posterior of the antero-lateral 
 spines or teeth is larger than the others, slender, and in length about
