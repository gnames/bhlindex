8 SMITHSONIAN MISCELI,ANIi;OUS COLLECTIONS 

one-ninth the width of the carapax; the pterygostomian spine is the 
 smallest of the four. The parts about the head are nearly the same 
 as in D. gracilipes, except that the forks of the rostrum are rather 
 more slenderly pointed, and there is no tooth between the pterygos- 
 tomian tooth and that at the anterior corner of the buccal region. 
 The external maxilhpeds nearly reach the bases of the internal an- 
 tennae, thus almost entirely concealing the epistome. The pterygos- 
 tomian region is depressed so as to form a deep channel leading for- 
 ward from the afiferent branchial openings. This channel is bounded 
 externally by a high, sharp ridge fringed with long hairs. The feet 
 are stout; those of the second pair shorter than twice the length of 
 the carapax- Chelopoda more slender than the other feet and not as 
 long as the carapax ; the fingers slender, minutely denticulated within 
 and contiguous throughout their length. Color brownish above and 
 below ; smooth tips of dactyli red. 

A single specimen only (a male) of this species was taken; its 
 dimensions (including the spines) are: Length of carapax, 1.65; 
 width, 1.50; length of posterior spine, 0.17; of lateral spine, 0.17; 
 length of a foot of second pair, 2.54 inches. 

Taken in the dredge with a mass of Echini from a muddy bottom 
 at the depth of 20 fathoms, off Tamtoo Island, coast of China, near 
 Hongkong.

 pi. I, fig. I. 

Gerstsecker has given an excellent figure of this species in the 
 Archiv fiir Naturgeschichte for 1856, but his paper does not appear 
 to have been published before April, 1857; our name has, therefore, 
 priority. The entomologist of Berlin does not seem to have been 
 acquainted with Kroyer's genus Chioncecetes, to which the species 
 certainly belongs ; in fact, it is most closely allied to the type, C. 
 opilio. 

This species was found in Bering Strait and northward as far 
 as the expedition penetrated, many specimens having been dredged 
 by Captain Rodgers. It also occurred to the southward of the 
 strait as far as Matwi Island. It is found only in deep water and 

^Chionoecetes opilio (O. Fabricius).
