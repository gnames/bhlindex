CRUSTACEA NORTH PACIFIC EXPLORING EXPEDITION 9 

-on bottoms more or less muddy. In a living state it was of a light 
 brick-red color above, often iridescent ; below yellowish-white ; sides 
 of feet shining white. The posterior feet are short. The dimen- 
 sions of the carapax of a large female are: Length, 2.57; breadth, 
 '2.'j2 inches. 

In Gerstgecker's figure the surface of the carapax posteriorly and 
 the upper sides of the ambulatory feet are represented as much more 
 rugose than in any of our specimens. 

Chionoccclcs is evidently nearest allied to Hyas, although probably 
 .a higher form. In young specimens the resemblance to Hyas is 
 ■easily noticed. Hyas chilensis should probably belong to it. It has 
 considerable resemblance in general appearance to Salacia of the 
 opposite extremity of the American continent, of which it may be 
 •considered the analogue.

This species differs from H. coarctatus, of the North Atlantic, in 
 the following characters, which are found to be constant upon exam- 
 ination of numerous specimens of both forms : The body is thicker 
 ■and much broader anteriorly across the post-orbital apophyses ; the 
 angles are all more obtuse. The dorsal surface is marked with 
 fewer tubercles, which are also much larger and more obtuse, most 
 ■of them being rather swellings than warts. The rostrum is shorter 
 and less acute ; and the superior fissure of the orbit is always closed, 
 its margins overlapping. 

It is subject to considerable variation in some of its characters, 
 ■particularly in the greater or less approximation of the forks of the 
 rostrum, which may be so closely appressed against each other as to 
 overlap, or may diverge so as to leave a narrow V-shaped space be- 
 tween. They diverge most in the young. The feet and inferior 
 surface of the body are densely hirsute in some individuals and quite 
 smooth in others. The color is a dusky brick-red above, whitish 
 below. The dimensions of a male from the Arctic Ocean north of 
 Bering Strait are: Length of carapax, 2.85; greatest breadth, 2.12;
