In this little crab the carapax is rather depressed, and but little 
 longer than broad. The regions are sufficiently prominent, but gen- 
 erally smooth and rounded; there are, however, three inconspicuous 
 protuberances on the genital and three on each branchial region. 
 Surface pubescent, the more prominent portions often surmounted 
 by a few curled setae. The antero-lateral margin is swollen, but with- 
 out teeth, except that immediately behind the post-orbital tooth and 
 a small conical one at the lateral extremity of the branchial region. 
 The chelopoda of the adult male are robust ; the meros toothed along 
 the angles ; the hand smooth, somewhat compressed, and surmounted 
 above by a ridge. Posterior four pairs of feet pubescent ; the meros 
 with a small tooth at the summit and one or two near the base. 
 Length of carapax, 0.4 ; width, 0.38 inch. 

Several specimens were taken in the harbor of Porto Praya, Cape 
 de Verde Islands. They were dredged on a nullipore bottom at the 
 depth of 20 fathoms. 

Genus TIARINIA Dana 

In addition to the characters given by Dana as defining this well- 
 marked group, the following may be added. The palpus of the ex- 
 ternal maxillipeds is very broad ; but little less than three-fourths as 
 broad as the ischium or second joint; the antero-exterior angle of 
 the meros is consequently much produced. As in many other genera 
 of Maioids, the fingers of the chelopoda are in contact throughout 
 their length in the young, but touch each other only at their tips in 
 the adult ; the dactylus bears a strong tooth within near its base. In 
 Tiarinia the prgeorbital spine is more prominent than the tooth of the 
 basal joint of the external antennse, projecting over and concealing 
 it; in Pericera, on the contrary, the antennal tooth is more promi- 
 nent than the prasorbital. 

It has been usual to place Pericera and its allies near the Mence- 
 theincc, along with Haliimis and Pugettia, on the ground of the 
 non-retractility of the eyes. But the eyes should scarcely be called 
 non-retractile, when, as may be seen in any wet specimen, they are 
 really more completely retractile than in any other genus of Maioids, 
 and may be drawn in so far as to be completely hidden. It is true 
 that this is not a folding back, as in Hyas and luachus, but a direct
