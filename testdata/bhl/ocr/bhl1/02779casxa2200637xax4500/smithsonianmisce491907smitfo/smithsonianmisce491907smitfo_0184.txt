withdrawal into a sheath. Pcriccra is nearly allied to Pisa; in fact, 
 p. biconia is placed by some naturalists in one genus and by others 
 in the other. The peculiar character of the orbit, however, seems to 
 warrant the establishment of a new family division for the reception 
 of this genus and Tiarinia.

Our specimens differ from those described and figured by Dana 
 in having, at the summit of the intestinal region, one very large and 
 two inconspicuous tubercles, instead of three of equal size. They 
 are also much larger, some being nearly two inches in length. 

They are found on the reefs at low-water mark, and were collected 
 at the Amakirrima Islands by the officers of the steamer "Joh" Han- 
 cock" and by myself at Loo Choo and Ousima.

 Carapax in shape much like that of T. cornigera; proportion of 
 treadth to length, i : 1.5; form depressed; upper surface with tuber- 
 cles less numerous and more flattened than in the cornigera. There is 
 a small marginal spine on each side at the branchial region, above 
 which an arc of four depressed warts extends around the side ; the 
 first (posterior) one largest, and placed a little behind the level of 
 the trituberculated cardiac protuberance; the fourth, and smallest, 
 is near the anterior extremity of the branchial region, with a still 
 smaller one before it. A submarginal channel of some depth 
 passes around behind, above the intestinal region. Posteriorly, at 
 the upper or intestinal margin there is a subtriangular median 
 tubercle, with a smaller trilobate one on either side of it ; on the 
 lower margin there are four small tubercles. On the stomachal 
 region there are three warts in the median line, the anterior one 
 smallest, and placed some little distance before the others, with a 
 â– vvart on either side of it; behind the posterior one there are two
