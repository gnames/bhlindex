CRUSTACEA NORTH PACIFIC EXPLORING EXPEDITION 13 

warts placed close together. The ambulatory feet are depressed, 
 smooth above, their edges not spinulose, but sparsely fringed with 
 stout clavate seta;. Only one specimen of this species was taken — 
 a sterile female — the dimensions of which are: Length, 0.77; breadth,, 
 0.52; length of a foot of second pair, 0.67 inch. 

In the characters of the rostrum, orbits, etc., our species much 
 resembles T. cornigera. The tooth at the external angle of the 
 basal joint of the external antennse is, however, less prominent than 
 in that species, and the rostrum curves upward at its slender tip, 
 where the horns are slightly divergent. It is more depressed than 
 T. tiarata; the forks of the rostrum are less divergent; the prseorbital 
 spine less prominent, and is wanting in the woolly hairs character- 
 istic of that species. 

The specimen was taken at the island of Ousima, which forms one 
 of the chain connecting southern Japan with Loo Choo.

Carapax somewhat elongated, the greatest breadth excluding 
 spines being considerably less than the postorbital length. Upper 
 surface not very convex except at the well-developed gastric region ; 
 cardiac region with three tubercles at the summit, placed as usual in 
 the genus ; on either side of this on the branchial regions there 
 are three sharp, erect spines, the outer one being lateral, a little 
 larger than the others, and somewhat inclined outward. There is a 
 single longish clavate seta at the summit of each spine. Upper pos- 
 terior margin with seven small spines, the middle one largest at the 
 summit of the intestinal region; lower posterior margin also with 
 seven spines, but of much smaller size. The sides of the carapax, 
 including the hepatic regions and the posterior half of the upper sur- 
 face, are covered with small, sharp tubercles occupying the inter- 
 spaces between the spines and larger warts, while the gastric region, 
 and parts adjacent on either side, although irregularly protuberant, 
 are nearly smooth. Rostrum sharp and very slender, in length 
 equaling two-thirds the interorbital width ; horns contiguous 
 throughout their length. Prasorbital tooth prominently salient, very 
 slender and sharp, curved upward ; a single closed fissure separates 
 it from the somewhat prominent postorbital tooth. The basal article 
 of the external antennae is broader than long ; its antero-exterior
