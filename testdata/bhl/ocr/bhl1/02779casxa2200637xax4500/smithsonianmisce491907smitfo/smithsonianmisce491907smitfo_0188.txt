l6 SMITHSONIAN MISCELLANEOUS COLLECTIONS 

cles somewhat larger than those of the surface, the median two being 
 larger and dentiform. The antero-lateral margin curves upward a 
 little and shows nine minute teeth, two of which, in the depression 
 between the hepatic and branchial regions, are much larger than the 
 others. The superior margin of the orbit is two-fissured. The eye- 
 peduncles are exposed throughout their length, and fully reach the 
 tip of the tooth formed by the external angle of the orbit. Rostrum 
 broader than long ; its upper surface with two convex ridges ; ex- 
 tremity broader than the base, and four-toothed, the middle teeth 
 being short, triangular, and blunt, the lateral ones sharp and curved 
 upward. The movable part of the antennae is at the base of the 
 rostrum, separated from the orbit only by the narrow, projecting, 
 terminal edge of basal joint, which, seen from above, forms a slender 
 tooth. Below% the surface of this basal joint is smooth. 

The upper surface of the body is hairy ; the ambulatory feet 
 densely so ; hectognathopoda also hairy. First pair of ambulatory 
 feet long. Dactyli much curved. The dimensions of a female speci- 
 men are as follows: Length of the carapax, 0.59; greatest breadth, 
 0.48 inch ; proportion, i : 1-23 ; length of first pair of ambulatory feet, 
 0.64 inch. 

Our specimens dififer somewhat from Dana's figure in the greater 
 prominence of the tooth of the basal joint of the antennse, which 
 projects so as to appear conspicuously above. The species is, how- 
 ever, undoubtedly the same. It approaches M. philyra in character, 
 but is more hairy, the margins with smaller teeth, the teeth of the 
 rostrum shorter and the outer ones recurved, and the movable part 
 of the antenna not widely separated from the orbit. It has also some 
 resemblance to M. platipes Riippell, but has not the sharp terminal 
 rostral teeth of that species. 

Our specimens were taken at the islands of Loo Choo and Ousima. 
 Those of the U. S. Exploring Expedition are from Tongatabu.

In living specimens of this species the body is covered with sordes ; 
 when cleaned it is found to be of a yellowish-brown color above and 
 below, the feet annulated with pale purplish-brown. There is a great 
 diveisity in the size of the hand and the shape of the fingers shown 

' Halimus diacanthus (De Haan).
