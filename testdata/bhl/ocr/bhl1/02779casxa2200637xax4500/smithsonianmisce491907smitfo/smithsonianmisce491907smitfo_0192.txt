sharp tooth near the extremity, being one of three large teeth sur- 
 rounding the insertion of the carpus. Superior and inferior edges 
 of ambulatory feet somewhat setose ; the penultimate joints of these 
 feet, however, are smooth and slender. In this and the other known 
 species of the genus the setas are stout and clavate in form. 

The dimensions of a sterile female are : Length of carapax, 0.65 ; 
 greatest breadth, 0.51 inch. 

This species was dredged in the harbor of Hakodadi. Island of 
 Jesso, Japan, on a bottom of weedy sand, at the depth of 6 fathoms. 

Onlv one other species of the genus is known, 5*. acutifrons Dana, 
 which inhabits the opposite coast of the Xorth Pacific. 

Genus DIONE De Haan 

15. DIONE AFFINIS* De Haan 
 Dionc afHiiis De Haan, Fauna Japonica, Crustacea, 94, pi. xxii, fig. 4. 

The only specimen taken is young, the dimensions of the carapax 
 being: Length, 0.57; greatest breadth. 0.41; breadth between prse- 
 orbital spines, 0.35 inch. Proportion of this interorbital breadth to 
 the length, 1:1.63. This proportion in De Haan's figure is 1:1.93. 
 Our specimen dififers from those described by De Haan in its more 
 depressed form, its narrower and smoother carapax and broader 
 front. There is no tooth within at the base of the movable finger 
 and none on the outer base of the hand. The horns of the rostrum 
 are longer than in the adult D. affinis, and the abdomen of the male 
 is not dilated near the base. 

Having no opportunities of comparing our specimen with the 
 young of the species to which it is here referred, we do not venture 
 to consider it distinct. 

It was taken in a harbor on the northwest coast of the Island 
 of Ousima.
