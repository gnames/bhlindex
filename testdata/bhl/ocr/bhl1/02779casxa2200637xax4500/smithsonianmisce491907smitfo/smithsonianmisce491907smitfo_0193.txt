CRUSTACEA NORTH PACIFIC EXPLORING EXPEDITION 19 

anteriorly ; length and breadth equal ; margins dentated with teeth of 
 moderate size. Gastric region broad and convex. Upper surface 
 with about thirty small, nearly equidistant prominent warts; the 
 interspaces granulated. Rostrum formed of two small, sharp, trian- 
 gular, diverging horns, outside of which, on either side, project three 
 slender spines belonging to the anterior margin of the basal joint of 
 the antennae. Eyes large. Superior margin of orbit with two deep 
 fissures and three teeth, the middle one of which is short, truncate, 
 with a trifid clove-like apex. The tooth at the external angle of the 
 orbit is rather long and sharp, curving forward ; immediately behind 
 this there are two teeth on the antero-lateral margin just in front of 
 the hepatic constriction. Behind this constriction on the lateral 
 margin of the carapax there are six teeth, the posterior ones very 
 small, and placed rather above than on the margin. At the posterior 
 extremity of the shell there are two small blunt submarginal teeth. 
 Outer pterygostomian regions with granulated surface, upon which 
 arise a few tubercles. Hectognathopoda and the adjoining trian- 
 gular surface smooth and ungranulated. Fossae of the inner an- 
 tennae excavated in the inferior side of the horns of the rostrum. 
 Chelopoda small, slender, smooth, and glossy. Ambulatory feet 
 hairy above; three of the joints spinulose; below smooth. Those of 
 the posterior pair nearly smooth above. 

The color in the preserved specimen is white, tinged with reddish- 
 brown. Dimensions : Length of carapax, 0.8 ; greatest breadth, the 
 same ; breadth between tips of the larger spines of the antennae, 0.4 ; 
 between tips of the spines at outer angle of orbit, 0.57 inch. 

It was taken at Selio Island, Caspar Straits, by Mr. L. M. Squires, 
 of the steamer "John Hancock."

The specimen is a fully developed female. It is covered with a 
 thick growth of iilvo", indicating the sluggish habits of the species. 
 The abdomen does not appear to have been described ; it is seven- 
 articulate, depressed, suborbicular, but longer than broad, with a 
 transverse convexity at the middle of each joint, forming a low 
 median ridge, less conspicuous on the first and last joints. The 
 terminal knobs of the rostrum are onlv the extremities of two slight,
