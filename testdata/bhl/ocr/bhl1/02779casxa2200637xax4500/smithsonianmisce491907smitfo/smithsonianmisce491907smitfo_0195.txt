article subcylindrical and slender. Abdomen consisting of six seg- 
 ments, all of which are exposed by the shortness of the carapax pos- 
 teriorly ; extremity broad. Dimensions of carapax : Length, 0.385 ; 
 breadth. 0.325 inch. 

This species was dredged on a muddy bottom in 6 fathoms, in the 
 harbor of Port Jackson, Australia. 

Genus ACH.^OPSIS Stimpson

In this genus the general appearance resembles that of Achccus, 
 and the terminal joints of the feet of the posterior three pairs are 
 falciform. x\s in Enrypodius, the eyes are retractile, but without 
 orbits, and the external antenns are not concealed beneath the ros- 
 trum. The antennulary fossae are very large, and excavated in the 
 imder side of the horns of the small bifid rostrum. The basal joint 
 of the external antennae is narrow and placed almost in a vertical 
 plane, as in Lcpfopodia.

Description of a developed female. The carapax is rather thick 
 and convex above, the sides rounded ; the regions not strongly de- 
 fined, and rising but little beyond the general surface. The surface 
 is minutely and inconspicuously pubescent. The spines on the upper 
 surface of the carapax are all small, about equal in size, and very 
 sharp and slender ; there are three on the gastric region, one placed 
 posteriorly in the median line, the other two on the sides between the 
 median and the postocular spines. The somewhat protuberant 
 summit of the cardiac region is unprovided with a spine, but there 
 are two on each branchial region. Four minute spines on the hepatic 
 region and a few placed along the inferior lateral margin of the 
 carapax. The rostrujn is rather longer than it is broad at its base, 
 and divided for more than half its length, with the horns acute. 
 The small, sharp praeocular spine points obliquely upward and for- 
 ward. The ocular peduncles in length equal about half the inter- 
 orbital space ; they bear a slight tooth inferiorly in front and a minute 
 spine at the summit of the eye. The narrow basal joint of the ex- 
 ternal antennas curves upward and slightly outward at the base of
