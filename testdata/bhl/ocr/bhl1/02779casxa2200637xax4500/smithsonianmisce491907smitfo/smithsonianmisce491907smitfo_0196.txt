the rostrum, and is denticulated along the edge. The surface of the 
 external maxillipeds is ornamented with subspiniform and setose 
 granules, except at the longitudinal sulcus of the ischium-joint ; the 
 exposed surface of the palpus is also granulated. Chelopoda rather 
 large, even in the female, and nearly one-half longer than the cara- 
 pax ; they are everywhere spinulose above, except on the fingers of 
 the hand, which are smooth, curved, with their inner margins con- 
 tiguous, inconspicuously denticulated. Ambulatory feet hairy, 
 somewhat irregularly and minutely spinulose above ; terminal joints 
 in the posterior three pairs short, not greatly curved. Dimensions : 
 Length of carapax, 0.36; breadth, 0.28; length of first pair of ambu- 
 latory feet, 0.67 inch.

Body rather slender, but high and rounded ; carapax minutely 
 pubescent; proportion of breadth to length, i : 1.79. There are two 
 long erect spines on the upper surface, one at the summit of the 
 gastric, the other on the cardiac region ; there are also a few small 
 spines or sharp tubercles on the sides of the body. Rostrum con- 
 stituting more than one-fourth the length of the carapax, and very 
 slender, composed of two acicular horns, contiguous throughout 
 their length, and so closely pressed against each other that one is 
 usually crowded up over the other, as if twisted. External antennae
