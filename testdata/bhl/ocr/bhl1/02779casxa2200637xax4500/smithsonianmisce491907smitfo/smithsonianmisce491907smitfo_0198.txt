24 SMITHSONIAN MISCELLANEOUS COLLECTIONS 

Genus PUGETTIA Dana 

Having secured specimens of two species of Japanese Maioid 
 crabs, referred by De Haan to the genus Menccthius, we Jind them 
 perfectly similar, in all characters which may be considered generic, 
 to the Pugetticc of the North American coast. The range of the 
 genus, therefore, extends throughout the North Pacific. In addition 
 to the characters given by Dana for the genus, we may mention the 
 following : There is no postorbital spine, other than that forming the 
 anterior angle of the hepatic expansion. The pterygostomian ridge 
 is denticulated. There is a small tuberculiform tooth at the exterior 
 base of the first joint of the antennas. The chelopoda are very large 
 in the male. 

The lyrate form of the carapax, with two angular projections on 
 either side, otherwise without spines, is quite characteristic. The 
 body of the female is more swollen above than that of the male. 
 The species are generally very clean and neat for Maioids. and free 
 from pubescence. 

25. PUGETTIA INCISA ' (De Haan) Stimpson 

MencBthius incisus De Haan, Fauna Japonica, Crust., p. 98, pi. xxiv, 
 fig. 3. Adams and White, Voy. Samarang, Crust., p. 20. 

This seems to represent P. gracilis. Recent specimens are of a 
 reddish or chestnut color above, white below ; pincers brown, tipped 
 with white. 

It differs from P. quadridens in the less projecting and much less 
 concave hepatic expansions ; also in the smaller chelopoda of the 
 male. The fingers of the hand are contiguous almost throughout 
 their length. 

It was found on a sandy and weedy bottom, at the depth of 6 
 fathoms, in the Bay of Hakodadi, Japan. 

36. PUGETTIA QUADRIDENS (De Haan) Stimpson 

Mencethius quadridens De Haan, Fauna Japonica, Crustacea, p. 97, pi. 
 XXIV, fig. 2. Adams and White, Voy. Samarang, Crust., p. 20. 

Living specimens are of a sea-green color, with the abdomen 
 speckled with white. The species represents P. Richii of the Cali- 
 fornian coast. 

It was found among sea weeds dragged up from stony bottoms, 
 at the depth of i and 2 fathoms, on the coast of China, near Hong- 

^ Pugettia quadridens (De Haan).
