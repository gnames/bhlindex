Carapax with the regions distinct, but not deeply separated ; pro- 
 portion of breadth to length, i : 1.38. Upper surface rugose, the 
 rugosities consisting of rounded flattened warts somewhat irregular 
 in size, and sometimes confluent. A large triangular tooth behind 
 the orbit, at the hepatic region ; five teeth on the branchial region, 
 four of which are marginal or submarginal, and one erect at the 
 center of the region. Two small spines on the gastric region. Car- 
 diac region rather prominent, oblong. Posterior margin with a 
 slight protuberance on each side. Rostrum deeply bifid ; horns long 
 and sharp, somewhat divergent. Orbits and antennas much as in 
 E. aspcra, except that the superior orbital fissure is not open. Hec- 
 tognathopoda roughly granulated. Chelopoda of male nearly twice 
 as long as the carapax, granulated and somewhat spinous ; hand 
 rather slender, with three or four stout spines toward extremity on 
 superior inner margin. Pincers deflexed. Ambulatory feet bicar- 
 inate above, the carinae most distinct on the meros, where they are 
 each 3 to 4 toothed.
