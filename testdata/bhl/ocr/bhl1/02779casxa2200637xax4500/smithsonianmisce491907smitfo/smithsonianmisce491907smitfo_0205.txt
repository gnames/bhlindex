Lambrits laciniatus De Haan, Fauna Japonica, Crust., p. 91, pi. xxii, figs. 
 2, 3. Adams and White, Voy. Samarang, Crust., p. 29. 

Recent specimens are of a reddish or yehowish-brown color above, 
 paler and sometimes whitish below. Hands tipped with a dark 
 mahogany color. 

Young specimens, the carapax of which is not over two-thirds of 
 an inch in length, are much smoother than the adults, with few 
 tubercles on the surface of the body and none on the flat faces of 
 the chelopoda. The teeth on the margins of the carapax and hands 
 are small, little projecting, and scarcely denticulated. 

This species is very common in the seas adjacent to the shores 
 of Southern China, particularly about Hongkong. It inhabits 
 muddy bottoms in from 5 to 20 fathoms. One specimen was taken 
 in 25 fathoms, shelly bottom, near the middle of the Northern China 
 Sea.

In form, length of arms, and general appearance this species is 
 similar to L. validiis. Proportion of length to breadth of carapax, 
 I : 1.2 1. Branchial regions separated from the median ones by pro- 
 found depressions. Surface above everywhere covered with small 
 flattened tubercles of nearly equal size. These tubercles are gener- 
 ally smooth on their flattened upper surfaces, and are each sur- 
 rounded by a ring or crown of granules, thus resembling the paxilli 
 of some kinds of starfishes. Two or three along the median line are 
 larger and more prominent than the others. Lateral margin of the 
 carapax with ten serrated and granulated teeth, the first one a slight 
 lobe at the hepatic region ; the posterior two very much larger than 
 the others, sharply projecting, and ramose on all sides with denticu- 
 lations. Beneath and within the posterior one there is a much 
 smaller one of similar character. Posterior margin with three gran- 
 ulated knobs, the middle one smallest and trilobate. Front deeply
