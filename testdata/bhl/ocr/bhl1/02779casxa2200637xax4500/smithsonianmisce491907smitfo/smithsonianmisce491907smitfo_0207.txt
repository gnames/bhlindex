CRUSTACEA XORTH PACIFIC EXPLORING EXPEDITION 3I 

Around and particularly in front of the cardiac region there is a 
 depression. At the summit of the small gastric region four obtuse 
 ridges meet in a slight transverse ridge, the two anterior, less con- 
 spicuous ones being those of the front ; the two posterior ones more 
 strongly marked, enclosing the median depression, and reaching to 
 the. branchial eminences. Chelopoda rather long ; hand subprismatic, 
 robust, with the superior crest six-toothed, the outer keel granulated ; 
 under surface somewhat convex and regularly tuberculated with 
 stout, flattened tubercles showing a tendency to arrangement in four 
 or five longitudinal rows, those of the outer row smallest. Lower 
 surface of meros also tuberculated. Ambulatory feet compressed, 
 ischium and meros with two spinous keels beneath. Abdomen and 
 sternum with an eroded or somewhat vermiculated surface, but 
 neither granulated nor spinulose. 

Color of the animal a dusky orange or light brownish ; fingers 
 pale brown. Dimensions of a male : Length of carapax, 0.38 ; 
 breadth, 0.55; between the elbows, 0.83; length of one of the chelo- 
 poda, 0.65 inch. 

Taken on a bottom of shelly sand, in 25 fathoms, in the China Sea. 
 about the middle, at latitude 2;^°.

The living animal is cream-colored, with small purplish-brown 
 ■dots above. Below white, with a pale rose tint. Red punctae on 
 the inferior surface of the posterior projecting shield of the carapax. 

The specimen figured by Adams and White belongs most probably 
 to a distinct species, for the pustulation of the surface in Parthen- 
 opoid crabs rather increases than diminishes with age, and the 
 short, thick chelopoda represented are quite dififerent from those of 
 the young specimens taken by us. 

Cryptopodia fornicata occurred not unfFequenth' in the harbor of 
 -Hongkong, on shelly bottoms, at the depth of about 10 fathoms.
