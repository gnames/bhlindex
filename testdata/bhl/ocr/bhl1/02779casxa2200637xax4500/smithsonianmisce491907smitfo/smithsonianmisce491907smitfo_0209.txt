Carapax hexagonal in shape, the frontal side being only half the 
 length of the antero-lateral and the posterior side about equal in 
 length to the postero-lateral. Front very slightly convex, emar- 
 ginate at the middle, the emargination being at the termination of a 
 longitudinal groove or impressed line on the surface of the carapax. 
 On either side of the front a sinus or fissure separates it from the 
 sharp subtriangular praeorbital tooth, which projects but very 
 slightly, if at all. beyond the frontal margin. The eyes are retractile, 
 although short and not very mobile. Orbit with two closed fissures 
 above and two notches below. Antero-lateral margin four-toothed 
 (including the angle of the orbit, which is prominent) ; the posterior 
 or extreme lateral tooth is strongly projecting. The postero-lateral 
 and posterior margins are smooth. Dorsum somewhat convex, 
 nearly smooth, the regions scarcely defined. A small setose emi- 
 nence on each side of the gastric region, and one on each branchial 
 region just within the lateral tooth. These are not connected by 
 transverse lines in my specimens, although such lines are mentioned 
 by Adams and White. Surface minutely tomentose and granu- 
 lated ; the granulation sharpest and most distinct on the antero- 
 lateral teeth. Chelopoda stout, more than twice as long as the cara- 
 pax, irregularly granulated ; meros with two or three short spines on 
 each side above near the base ; carpus with a single small tubercle 
 or spine at the middle of the inner margin ; hands smooth, enlarged 
 toward the fingers, which are one-third the length of the hand, and 
 are deflexed as in Euryiiome. Ambulatory feet minutely and 
 smoothly tomentose, without spines excepting a small blunt one at 
 the summit of the meros. 

Colors : Carapax and ambulatory feet pale reddish ; pubescence 
 dusky brownish ; hands red. 

Dimensions of a male : Length of carapax. 0.35 ; breadth, 0.44 ; 
 length of a chelopod, 0.96 inch.
