the carpus, and one at each joint of the ambulatory feet. The dimen- 
 sions of two specimens are as follows : Male, length of carapax, 2.T, : 
 breadth, 3.1 ; female, length, 2.4; breadth, 3.2 inches. 

Found on coral reefs about low-water mark. Taken by us at Loo 
 Choo and at Tahiti. It "has also been found at most of the coral 
 islands of the Pacific, among the East Indies, and in the Red Sea. 

Genus LIOMERA Dana 

This genus is here taken in a more extended sense than originally 
 intended by Dana, so as to include his genus Carpilodes and the 
 Xoiitho obtusus of De Haan. In our specimens of L. lata the fingers 
 show more tendency to excavation at the tip than in that described 
 by Dana, and are nearly the same as in Carpilodes tristis. In neither 
 of these species, however, is the spoon-shaped cavity as well defined 
 as in Chlorodins. This seems to point out the propriety of uniting 
 the two genera of Dana, which, according to the statement of the 
 author, differ only in the character of the fingers. In Lioiiicra ob- 
 tusa, which is intermediate in character between the two above men- 
 tioned, the fingers are more excavate than in either, and in a new 
 species described below they are entirely acuminate. 

As in allied genera, the third, fourth, and fifth joints of the male 
 abdomen are united.

This sj^ecies is remarkable for its great breadth, which exceeds 
 that of any other known crab. In our specimen the body is of a 
 light blue color, the feet light red, the fingers black. 

It was found at the Amakirrima Group, near Loo Choo, by Mr. 
 L. M. Squires, of the steamer "Hancock."
