CRUSTACEA NORTH PACIFIC EXPLORING EXPEDITION 39 

more than lialf the length of the latter. Antero-lateral margin reg- 
 nlarl\- convex, foiir-lobed ; the anterior two lobes but little wider and 
 nearh" as convex as the posterior two. Front slightly convex. 
 Anterior two-thirds of upper surface areolate, the areolets nearly as 
 in C. tristis, but more deeply defined, the longitudinal lines bisecting 
 the lateral areas of the gastric region being particularly conspicuous. 
 Surface minutel}' granular, as seen under a lens. Chelopoda of male 
 smooth, rather short ; carpus with a projecting lobe at the inner 
 angle, behind which there is a small tooth. Excavations at tips of 
 lingers not circumscribed within. Ambulatory feet smooth and 
 glossy, somewhat compressed; penult and antepenult joints with 
 bilobate upper margin. Color uniform deep scarlet ; fingers brown, 
 tipped with wdiite ; dactyli of ambulatory feet with a white annula- 
 tion next their corneous tips. Dimensions of a male : Length of 
 carapax, 0.49; breadth. 0.8; length of chelopod, 0.75 inch. 

Easily distinguished from L. tristis by the peculiar waved charac- 
 ter of the upper margin of the feet at the middle joints. 

Found under stones on rocky ground, at low-water mark, at 
 Ousima.

Carapax transversely elliptical in shape ; proportion of length to 
 breadth, i: 1.61 ; surface smooth and glossy, except on the slightly 
 depressed area above the front and orbits, where it is somewhat ru- 
 gose with minute depressions. The areolets are mostly as in other 
 species of the genus ; the longitudinal sulci, however, which bisect the 
 two large gastric areolets, are obsolete except anteriorly, where they 
 form shallow grooves. The depressions at the anterior corners of 
 the cardiac region are rather deep. The extreme lateral lobes (pos- 
 terior two of the antero-lateral margin) are angular and form con- 
 spicuous teeth ; the sulci separating them may be traced for a short 
 distance only on the surface of the carapax, the posterior one being 
 only half as long as the next. The remaining or anterior two-thirds 
 of the antero-lateral margin is convex, and indistinctly divided into 
 three scarcely projecting lobes, the middle one smallest. Front 
 slightly projecting and deeply emarginated at the middle. The inner 
 angle of the inferior orbital margin forms a tooth, which projects 
 sufficiently to be easily seen from above. Chelopoda smooth ; carpus 
 with two small blunt teeth at its inner angle ; hand with a groove on
