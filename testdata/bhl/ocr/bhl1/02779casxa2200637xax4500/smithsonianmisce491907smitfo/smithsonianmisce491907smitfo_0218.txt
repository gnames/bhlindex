the outer surface, parallel with and just beneath the upper margin; 
 fingers sulcate, inner margins denticulated, tips sharp. Ambulatory 
 feet glabrous, nearly smooth ; superior edge of meros granulated or 
 minutely denticulated. 

Color in preserved specimens whitish, tinged with dusky orange. 
 Fingers of a black color, not shading ofif toward the hand. Dimen- 
 sions: Length of carapax, 0.57; breadth, 0.92 inch. 

It has some resemblance to L. obtusa in its smoothness and gen- 
 eral proportions, but its lateral lobes are acute and the fingers not at 
 all excavated. It approaches Xaiitho, being less broad than other 
 species of IJomcra, to which genus it is referred from the character 
 of the markings on the carapax. 

Found at Loo Choo. 

Genus LACHXOPODUS Stimpson 

In this genus, as in allied forms, the carapax is smooth and pos- 
 teriorly convex ; the antero-lateral margin obtuse, with the teeth, or 
 rather, lobes, but little prominent. At the external angle of the orbit 
 the margin is more strongly puckered than in other genera of the 
 family. The arrangement of the antenuc-e is as usual in Carpilius, 
 Xantho, etc. The inner ramus of the internal gnathopoda is not 
 furcate. In the hectognathopoda the ischium is marked with a longi- 
 tudinal sulcus ; the surface of the meros presents a depression near 
 the internal angle, and the anterior margin of this joint is concave. 
 The meros of all the feet is spinous above ; the external surface of 
 the hand is sulcated, and the last three joints of the ambulatory feet 
 are thickly setose. 

The character of the feet separates this genus from Lio)iicra and 
 Liagoni, in which they are naked.

Lachnopodus Rodgcrsii Stimpson, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., x, p. 32 
 [30]. 1858. 

A single specimen only, a male, of this species was collected, in 
 which the proportions of the carapax were, length to breadth as 
 1:1.49. Upper surface convex, smooth. On the antero-lateral 
 margin the two exterior or lateral lobes only are well marked, form- 
 ing small teeth, sufficiently prominent, although obtuse and distant ; 
 the separation between the first and second lobe is scarcely percept- 
 ible. Front a little prominent, and emarginate at the middle.
