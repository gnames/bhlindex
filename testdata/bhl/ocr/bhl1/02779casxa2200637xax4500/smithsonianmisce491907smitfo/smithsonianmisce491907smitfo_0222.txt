This crab is of an uniform dark-brown or purplish-brown color, 
 almost black ; the eyes blood-red ; the antennulse white at base : the 
 fingers reddish. It may be observed at low water in great numbers 
 on the level outer reefs of Loo Choo, taking refuge, when pursued, 
 in the crevices of the rock. It was also found by the expedition at 
 Ousima, at the Amakirrima Isles, and at Hongkong, China. Ac- 
 cording to Dana it is also common among the coral islands of the 
 South Pacific and in the Sooloo Sea.

Plate V, Fig. 7 
 Actaa piira Stimpson, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., x, p. s^ [30], 1858. 

Carapax rather narrow; proportion of length to breadth, i : T.28. 
 Surface of body and feet thickly covered above with granulated 
 subconical tubercles, but everywhere clean and free from pilosity. 
 The tubercles give the surface a hard porcellanous or crystalline 
 appearance like that of some shells. The regions or areolets are not 
 very prominent, being rendered somewhat indistinct by the crowd- 
 ing of the tubercles. Front with the two median lobes prominent. 
 Antero-lateral margin strongly convex, obscurely quadrilobate, lobes 
 tuberculated, the median tubercle in each being sharper and more 
 prominent than the rest. Postero-lateral margin short, concave. 
 Eyes large; outer margin of peduncle granulated. Pter>gostomian 
 surface granulous toward the outer margin, but becoming smoother 
 toward the mouth. Hectognathopoda with the surface of the 
 palpus and ischium smooth ; inner margin of ischium and surface of 
 meros granulated. Chelopoda large ; upper and outer surface tuber- 
 culated like the carapax; fingers blackish, sulcate, with tuberculated 
 ridges ; their inner edges strongly toothed, tips blunt, curved inward. 
 The tubercles of the ambulatory feet are somewhat smaller than 
 those of the carapax, but more sharply granulous ; on the dactyli 
 they become subspiniform and are arranged in longitudinal rows. 
 Inferior surface of the feet, and that of the sternum and abdomen.
