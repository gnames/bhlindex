CRUSTACEA NORTH PACIFIC EXPLORING EXPEDITION 45 

where exposed, ornair.ented with smooth depressed granules or small 
 tubercles. Surface of sternum between bases of chelopoda pitted. 

Of a dark cream color, with purple-brown blotches. Dimensions 
 of a male: Length of carapax, 0.61 ; width, 0.78 inch. 

This species, although common at two or three localities, does not 
 seem to have been described ; at least we can find no description 
 agreeing with it. It is an elegant species, with a surface like that 
 of Buccinum pappillosuin or Monodonta reardonis. 

It is found at depths of 6, 10, and 20 fathoms, on muddy or shelly 
 bottoms, and often among soft sponges. It occurred at Port Jack- 
 son, at Hongkong, and in the northern China Sea.

This is a ver_\- thick, rounded species, and when seen in its usual 
 position, with the feet closely retracted against the body, has an 
 almost globose form. Its surface is everywhere densely villous, 
 excepting certain exposed parts of the lower surface, where the coat 
 seems to have been rubbed off. This is the case on the lower half of 
 the hand, the outer surface of the last two joints of the ambulatory 
 feet, and the more prominent portions of the sternum and abdomen. 
 These parts come in contact with the surface of the cavity in which 
 this sluggish crab habitually rests. The pubescence adheres very 
 strongly to the body and is removed with considerable difficulty. 

The carapax is much expanded anteriorly, strongly convex, with 
 an even surface; proportion of length to breadth, 1:1.32. The 
 areolets are scarcely distinguishable, even when the pubescence is 
 removed â€” when the surface is seen to be sharply though somewhat 
 sparsely granulated. The antero-lateral margin forms a regular 
 curve, apparently smooth, but showing, upon close examination, 
 three deep emarginations or fissures concealed by the villous coat ; 
 thus the margin is four-lobed, as in other species. Postero-lateral 
 margin very short, shorter than the posterior margin, and strongly 
 concave. Front with a very deep emargination ; median lobes small 
 and placed close together. Subhepatic region smooth, neither gran- 
 ulous nor sulcated ; a lanose arch on either side of the mouth. Ster- 
 num granulous between the bases of the anterior two pairs of feet. 
 The feet are smooth or only minutely granulous beneath the pubes- 
 cence. Chelopoda very short and stout ; fingers short, black, their 
 white tips crossing each other.
