Plate V, Fig. 6 
 Actaa pilosa Stimpson, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., x, p. :^t, [31]. 1858. 

The whole surface of the body and feet is hirsute with the excep- 
 tion of the tips of the fingers. The pubescence is rather less dense 
 below than on the upper surface, where there are numerous setse of 
 greater length interspersed. Carapax convex ; proportion of length 
 to breadth, i : 1.33. Anterior margin nearly semicircular in outline 
 and forming more than half the circumference of a circle. Postero- 
 lateral margin strongly concave and about equaling the posterior 
 margin in extent. The areolets of the surface may be easily traced, 
 but are not strongly marked, the shallow sulci of separation being 
 filled up with pubescence. The surface of the areolets is covered 
 with sharp granules. Antero-lateral margin four-lobed, angle of 
 orbit not included ; the lobes distinct ; first lobe small ; third and 
 fourth lobes depressed, subtriangular. Lobes of the front prom- 
 inent, deflexed, with smooth edges. Subhepatic region minutely 
 granulous, but not sulcated. Feet all strongly granulous and hairy 
 on their exposed surfaces. In the chelopoda the fingers are hairy at 
 their bases, longitudinally grooved, and 5-toothed on the inner edge. 
 In the ambulatory feet the antepenult joint is grooved above. 

Dimensions : Length of carapax, 0.42 ; breadth, 0.56 inch. 

This species has much resemblance to A. hirsutissijiia, but the car- 
 apax is not so deeply areolated, and the subhepatic region is not 
 grooved with sulci proceeding from the notches of the antero-lateral 
 margin. 

Taken at Hongkong, China.
