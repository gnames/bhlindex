cate. but not notched at the insertion of the carpal joint. The chelo- 
 poda are tuberculated ; hands broad, with short fingers. Ambula- 
 tory feet slender : dactyli pubescent. Abdomen of the male slender, 
 seven-jointed, the third, fourth, and fifth joints not soldered, the 
 terminal joint very long and slender. 

It is allied to Haliniede in shape and in the characters of the front, 
 antennae, gnathopoda, and abdomen, but the margin of the orbit is 
 without hiatus, and has no inner fissure of the inferior margin.

This species differs from P. ochtodes CTcrstsecker {Cancer och- 
 todcs. Herbst, Crust., i, 158, pi. viii, fig. 54), in its smaller size and 
 somewhat narrower carapax, the surface of which is also smoother 
 anteriorly. The tubercles of the chelopoda are less capitate in shape 
 and more numerous. 

Our specimens agree well in size, color, and general appearance 
 with the figure in the Zoology of the Voyage of the Samarang ) 
 (Crust., pi. X, fig. 2). But they differ in some points mentioned be- 
 low ; and even if identical, we can scarcely suppose the species of 
 Adams and White to be the Cancer ochtodes of Herbst, to the young 
 of which it is referred by the English authors. It is constantly 
 smaller, while most of the numerous specimens examined have every 
 appearance of being adults. 

In the specimens now under examination the teeth of the antero- 
 lateral margin are granulated below, and there are two minute teeth 
 on the postero-lateral margin behind the large teeth. There is a 
 granulated protuberance on each side just above the lateral extremity 
 of the posterior margin. The carpus and hand are more verrucose 
 than is represented in the figure of Adams and White, much of the 
 outer, as well as the upper, surface being covered with tubercles. 
 The ambulatory feet are somewhat scabrous above, particularly on 
 the meros joint; their sides are smooth ; the last two joints are hairy. 
 The abdomen is much more slender, and the third joint more elon- 
 gated, than in the figure cited. The color in life was yellowish- 
 brown, mottled. Dimensions of a male : Length of carapax, 0.63 ; 
 breadth. 0.76 inch; ratio, i: 1.2. 

This species is not uncommon on bottoms of shelly mud, at the 
 depth of four or five fathoms, near Hongkong, China.
