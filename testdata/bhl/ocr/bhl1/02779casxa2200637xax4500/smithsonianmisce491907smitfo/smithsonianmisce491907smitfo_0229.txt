brown. Eyes always red. The young are often dark olive with a 
 yellowish pubescence. 

Besides the sharp tubercles, a character distinguishing- this species 
 from C. iDigulatns may be found in the front, which in the latter 
 species is deeply sinuous, the median lobes projecting, while in the 
 monticitlosus it is blunt, often bimarginate, and projects but little. 

Found among corals at slight depths at Loo Choo, at the Bonin 
 Islands, and at Tahiti. It also occurs at the Fiji and Navigator 
 Islands, and in Balabac Straits (Dana).

Carapax anteriorly expanded; proportion of length to breadth, 
 I : 1.35. The anterior three-fourths of the surface is well areolated; 
 the longitudinal sulci are deeper than those having a transverse 
 direction, particularly on the gastric region, w^here the two grooves 
 proceeding backward from the front and dividing in two the lateral 
 lobes of this region, are strongly marked, and reach nearly to the 
 posterior margin of the lobes. The more protuberant parts of the 
 areolets. particularly of the lateral ones, are strongly granulated. The 
 transverse raised line crossing the carapax from one lateral tooth to 
 the other is well marked in this species, convex behind, and ciliated. 
 This line marks off the smoother posterior part of the carapax, 
 which constitutes rather less than a fourth part of the whole length. 
 There is also a slight ridge just above and parallel with the pos- 
 terior margin ; this is interrupted at the middle. Antero-lateral 
 margin with four small, sharp equidistant teeth, besides the angle of 
 the orbit. Front rather narrow, considerably projecting, and quad- 
 ridentate ; the lateral teeth a little smaller than the middle ones. 
 Orbital margin with deeper and more strongly marked fissures than 
 are seen in other species, giving it a toothed appearance. Chelopoda 
 of rather small size, even in the male ; upper surface rugulose ; car- 
 pus with two or three small teeth above ; hand with one small basal 
 tooth and three or four minute ones along the upper margin ; outer 
 surface of hand covered with minute transverse granulose rugae, as 
 in C. cxaratus : fingers well curved toward their excavated tips, very 
 little gaping, small-toothed within, and brown in color, the brown of 

^ Btisodes clcctra (Herbst).
