the thumb extending on to the hand for some little distance. Ambu- 
 latory feet conspicuously hairy; their sides smooth. Dimensions of 
 a male : Length of carapax, 0.33 ; breadth, 0.45 inch. 

It has considerable resemblance to Cancer electra Herbst (pi. LL 
 fig. 6), but the frontal teeth are less prominent and the greatest 
 width is at the penult, and not at the last antero-lateral tooth. 

This species was taken at Loo Choo.

This is, the most common of the numerous species of Chlorodius 
 found in the eastern seas, and large numbers of specimens were col- 
 lected by the expedition at different places on the shores of China and 
 at the Japanese and the Pacific islands. It is only after a long and 
 careful study of these specimens that we have arrived at the results 
 set forth in the above synonymy. 

That the Chlorodius exaratus of Milne Edwards is a very variable 
 species, and is so considered by the carcinologists at Paris, will be 
 evident from a comparison of the figure in the illustrated edition of 
 the "Regne i\nimar' with that in the "Voyage au Pole Sud." But 
 one would scarcely be prepared to find so much variety in the char- 
 acter of the surface, the number and shape of the lateral teeth, and 
 the sculpture of the feet, as we see in the present instance, these 
 characters being in other genera and species of the highest specific 
 importance. The varieties described below, however, are found to 
 run into each other in all the characters which at first sight strike 
 the examiner as specific, and several of them are often found living 
 together under circumstances which do not fail to impress the col- 
 lector with the idea that they are one and the same species. 

We are first led to question the distinctness of C. sanguineus by 
 finding in a number of specimens from Loo Choo the supplementary 
 tooth posterior to the lateral one, gradually becoming smaller and
