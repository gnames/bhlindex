CRUSTACEA NORTH PACIFIC EXPLORING EXPEDITION 53 

at last entirely disappearing, while in other characters the specimens 
 remain exactly the same. And the figure of C. exaratus, in the 
 "Voyage au Pole Sud," certainly presents the characters usually 
 assigned to C. sanguineus. Among our specimens it is not difficult 
 to find forms agreeing with De Haan's Xantho Uvidus and A^. aMnis; 
 and these are so connected by intermediate forms that they cannot be 
 specifically separated. Every degree of extent in the front and in 
 the hiatus of the fingers, between the extremes represented by these 
 two varieties, may be found among our specimens. The Xantho 
 distill gxiendus certainly appears at first entirely distinct, the gran- 
 ulation of the carapax and hands, and particularly the sculpture or 
 erosion of the ambulatory feet, seeming to be characters which 
 it would be in vain to seek for in any variety of C. exaratus. But 
 we have before us specimens of this form from Hongkong which 
 show gradations toward the type. In some of these the carapax is 
 rather broad, with little or no granulation and a protruded front. 
 In others the granulation of the hand disappears, while that of the 
 carapax remains the same. In others all granulation disappears, 
 and among all these specimens there are some which possess the 
 supplementary tooth, while in others it is wanting. 

Future observers, aided by a still greater number of specimens 
 than is now accessible, may succeed in finding constant characters 
 upon which good species may be founded, but the present indica- 
 tions certainly require us to regard as varieties the several forms 
 now to be described. 

Var. a, SANGUINEUS 

With a. distinct supplementary tooth, formed by the division by a 
 sulcus of the posterior edge of the lateral tooth of the margin ; this 
 is much more distinct in the adult than in the young. The antero- 
 lateral teeth are sufficiently prominent, anterior ones blunt. Front 
 much undulated, rather narrow (in extent just half that of the 
 antero-lateral margin), and scarcely protruded beyond the edge of 
 the orbit. Surface of carapax areolate, areolets rather smooth and 
 glossy, shining. Upper and outer surface of chelopoda with reticu- 
 lating rugse. Pincers sometimes much curved, moderately gaping, 
 inner edges well toothed ; color black, tips white. Ambulatory feet 
 smooth, edges hairy; penult and antepenult joints obsoletely grooved 
 above ; dactyli granulose. 

Found at the Sandwich Islands and at Loo Choc.
