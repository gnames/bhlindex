Var. b, RUGOSUS 
 Plate VI, Fig. 4 
 With the characters of the preceding, except that the areolets of 
 the carapax, and also the antero-lateral teeth, are much more sharply 
 prominent and rugose. The reticulating rug^e of the chelopoda are 
 granulose, and there is a small tuft of setse in each of the cup-shaped 
 depressions at the tips of the fingers. This is the largest variety we 
 have met with. 

Found at the Ronin Islands.
