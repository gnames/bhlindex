CRUSTACEA NORTH PACIFIC EXPLORING EXPEDITION 59 

somewhat distantly arranged in longitudinal rows ; fingers sulcate, 
 the ridges tuberculated at base. The exposed upper surfaces of the 
 ambulatory feet are granulosa and thickly pubescent. 

Colors : The upper surface is variegated with purple-brown and 
 buff. Fingers reddish-brown. Hand in the male a broad encircling 
 band of brown near the bases of the fingers. Dimensions of a male : 
 Length of carapax, 0.29 ; breadth, 0.44 inch. Of a female : Length, 
 0.33 ; breadth, 0.5 inch. 

This species differs from P. pubcsccns in the broader abdomen 
 of the male, the extremity of which is bluntly rounded. From P. 
 pilumnoides it differs in the absence of denticulation at the superior 
 edge of the meros joint of the feet. 

Found on madrepores, drawn up from a depth of i or 2 fathoms,, 
 in a bay on the outer side of Hongkong Island. 

Genus CYMO De Haan 

The crabs of this genus are easily recognized by their depressed,^ 
 suborbicular form and rough, hairy surface, which is almost always 
 obscured by sordes. They have some affinity to the Trapezice in 
 general appearance and in their habits. The two known species are 
 always found together, and are common on coral everywhere in the 
 warmer latitudes of the Pacific Ocean. 

79. CYMO MELANODACTYLUS De Haan 

Cynio inclanodactyhts De H.\an, Fauna Japonica, Crust., p. 22 (no 
 descr.). D.'\na, U. S. Expl. Exped., Crust., i, 225, pi. xiii, fig. i. 

This species is of a dirty buff color, the eyes purplish-brown, the 
 fingers black. 

The characters of the front, etc., mentioned by authors as distin- 
 guishing this species from C. andrcossyi are unreliable on account 
 of their variation. In fact, it would seem impossible to separate the 
 two species from characters derived from the carapax alone. The 
 chelopoda, however, afford some good distinctive marks. In C. 
 mdanodactylus the granules of the outer surface of the hand are 
 arranged in longitudinal rows, those of the middle row and of a row 
 near the upper edge being larger than the others ; those of the rows 
 near the upper edge subspiniform and sharp. There are generally 
 numerous red granules on the upper surface of the hand, but none 
 on the outer surface, as in C. andreossyi. The fingers are black, 
 with the basal half strongly granulated. 

Found on madrepores hooked up in a bay on the east side of 
 Hongkong Island ; also at the Bonin Islands. Dana reports it 
 from the Fijis.
