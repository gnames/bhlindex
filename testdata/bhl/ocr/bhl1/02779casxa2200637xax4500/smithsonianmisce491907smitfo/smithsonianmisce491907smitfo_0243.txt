terior tooth being small and supplementary to the fifth : anterior two 
 teeth very large but much less prominent than the others. Postero-

 tomentose. Subhepatic and subbranchial regions of the carapax 
 granulated. Meros of hectognathopoda notched at the anterior 
 margin. Chelopoda unequal in size, the right largest, rugose above 
 with reticulating granular ridges ; larger hand with nearly smooth 
 outer surface, fingers gaping and toothed as in O. trtmcatus; smaller 
 hand with the outer and under surface rugose and tomentose, fingers 
 slender, small-toothed, and in contact nearly throughout their length, 
 the tips curved inward- Ambulatory feet granulous above ; last three 
 joints densely tomentose, except the tips of the dactyli, which are 
 smooth and glossy, red, and cr}'stalline in appearance. 

Color above dark olive, minutely punctate with yellow; below, the 
 pubescence is bufif-colored. Larger hand of a clear dark-red color;

Carapax very broad; proportion of length to breadth, 1:1.7. 
 Upper surface smooth, punctate, and perfectly flat except near the 
 deflected anterior margin, where it is somewhat rugulose, as if 
 slightly eroded. Two impressed lines or sulci on the gastric region, 
 which unite anteriorly and lead toward the frontal emargination, 
 there becoming, however, shallow and nearly obsolete. The inter- 
 antennary front is rather narrow, not projecting, and slightly waved. 
 Teeth of antero-lateral margin nearly obsolete, even less prominent 
 than in P. planus; edge obtuse. Orbits and eyes very small. Chelo- 
 poda rather short and stout; upper surface minutely and crowdedly 
 punctate ; fingers short, black. Ambulatory feet hairy beneath ; 
 dactyli thickly pubescent. Dimensions of a female : Length of cara- 
 pax, 0.43 ; breadth, 0.72 inch. 

This species approaches very closely to P. planus Dana, U. S.
