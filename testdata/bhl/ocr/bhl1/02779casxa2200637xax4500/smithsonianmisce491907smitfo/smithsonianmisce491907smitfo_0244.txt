Expl. Exped., Crust., i, 233, but the carapax is flatter, the interan- 
 tennary front is narrower, and the eyes smaller- 
 Found at the Bonin Islands. 

Genus SPH^ROZIUS Stimpson 

This genus is separated from Pseiidozins Dana to include his 
 P. dispar and one other species. They are characterized by a globose 
 form, narrow carapax, and by the continuity of the frontal and 
 supraorbital margins, which are not separated by a notch, as in 
 most other genera of cancroids. The wide internal hiatus of the 
 orbit is filled by the outer antenna.

Sphccrozius niiidus Stimpson. Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., x, p. 35 [32], 
 1858. 

Body small, subglobose ; carapax about four-fifths as long as 
 broad, convex, smooth and shining", not areolate, but with an in- 
 conspicuous longitudinal sulcus on the gastric region, reaching to 
 the front, which is emarginated and somewhat projecting at the 
 middle. Frontal margin continuous with upper margin of orbit. 
 Teeth of antero-lateral margin fotir in number, small but acute. 
 Chelopoda unequal, robust, rounded ; outer and upper surface of 
 hands granulous ; carpus smooth ; fingers nearly black and longi- 
 tudinally grooved on their outer sides. Ambulatory feet somewhat 
 hairy. 

Color in life : Carapax dark gray ; feet punctate with black. 
 Dimensions of a female specimen : Length of carapax, 0.235 '> 
 breadth, 0.29 inch. 

Allied to Psendozius dispar Dana, loc. cit., i. 235, pi. xiii, fig. 9, 
 but distinguished from it by its sharper antero-lateral teeth and by 
 the want of tubercles on the hands. 

Only one specimen of this species occurred to us ; this was found 
 in a cluster of Spoggodia which grew on a rock just below low-water 
 mark at the island of Hongkong, China. 

Genus HETEROPAXOPE Stimpson 

A well-marked group of cancroids is found in the eastern seas, 
 the species of which hitherto discovered have been referred to the 
 genus PanopCHS, to which they have much resemblance. This genus
