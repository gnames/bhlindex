CRUSTACEA NORTH PACIFIC EXPLORING EXPEDITION 63 

is, however, as far as now known, exclusively American, and the 
 oriental forms present certain distinctive characters which cannot 
 be reg^arded as otherwise than of generic importance. 

The carapax is generally like that of Paiiopeus, the sharp, toothed 
 antero-lateral margin being shorter than the postero-lateral ; but the 
 front is deflexed, with the median lobes generally prominent. The 
 antero-lateral teeth are in general peculiarly cut. with convex sides ; 
 and they are often irregular in size. The hiatus of the infero- 
 exterior angle of the orbit is small and inconspicuous. The hecto- 
 gnathopoda are generally not in contact along their inner margins ; 
 and the ridge of the palate, defining the efferent canal, is sharply 
 prominent at the buccal margin. In the abdomen of the male the 
 joints are all distinct, the third, fourth, and fifth not being soldered, 
 as is usually the case in allied genera. 

This genus will include Panopciis dciitatus, P. caystriis. and P. 
 fonuio of Adams and White ( Voy. Samarang, Crust., pp. 41, 42), 
 and the following new species.

Carapax transverse; proportion of length to breadth, 1:1.55; 
 â– convex, broad anteriorly ; upper surface smooth ; frontal margin 
 straight, curving downward, not much projecting, and emarginated 
 at the middle. Antero-lateral margin five-toothed ; teeth small ; 
 angle of orbit minute, the next two teeth rounded, the last two sharp. 
 Eyes large. Orbit with a small hiatus at the external side beneath ; 
 upper and lower margins otherwise entire. Subhepatic regions 
 granulated. There is a thick fringe of hair on the inferior surface 
 of the carapax around the bases of the chelopoda. Surface of hecto- 
 gnathopoda, sternum, and abdomen pubescent. Chelopoda smooth; 
 the right hand largest ; fingers much deflexed, crossing each other 
 at their tips. Ambulatory feet slender, slightly hairy. 

Dimensions of a male : Length of carapax. 0.32 ; breadth. 0.495 
 inch. 

It has some resemblance to P. caysfrus Adams and White, but the 
 teeth of the margin are more deeply cut than in that species. 

Found at Honsfkonsf.
