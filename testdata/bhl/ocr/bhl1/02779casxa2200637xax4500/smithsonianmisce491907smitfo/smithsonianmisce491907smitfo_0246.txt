Carapax convex; proportion of length to breadth, i : 1.51 ; areolets 
 indistinct ; surface smooth but somewhat uneven anteriorly, and 
 sparingly granulated toward the anterior margins. Antero-lateral 
 margin with four teeth, including that behind the angle of the orbit ;. 
 teeth acute, the second much larger than, but not so prominent as 
 the third and fourth. A small tooth on the subhepatic region be- 
 neath the postorbital tooth. Front somewhat deflexed, prominently 
 rounded and deeply emarginate at the middle ; margin minutely ser- 
 rated. Orbit with the hiatus of the exterior side distinct though 
 narrow ; inferior margin denticulated ; tooth at inner angle promi- 
 nent. Subhepatic region granulated. A fringe of hairs around and 
 above the bases of the chelopoda. Surface of abdomen and ster- 
 num pubescent. Chelopoda stout, the right one larger ; carpus some- 
 what regularly granulated, with a strong tooth at the inner angle ; 
 hands smooth. Ambulatory feet hairy, particularly the dactyli.

One specimen only, a male, of this species exists in the collection. 
 The carapax is narrow, and resembles that of some forms of Gono- 
 placidse; proportion of length to breadth, 1:1:25. Upper surface 
 somewhat uneven, especially anteriorly, where there are some trans- 
 verse, linear, pubescent ridges. Antero-lateral margin very much 
 shorter than the postero-lateral, with three prominent teeth besides 
 the little prominent anterior one, which is coalescent with the angle 
 of the orbit. These three teeth are acute, with convex sides ; the 
 middle one is smaller than the others ; the posterior one is placed at 
 a somewhat higher level than the middle one, and projects a little
