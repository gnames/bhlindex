over it. Tlie deep median emargination of the front is at the termi- 
 nation of a longitndinal groove on the anterior surface of the cara- 
 pax, and close on each side of it the margin projects into a small 
 rounded tooth or lobe. Margins of orbit nearly smooth, the external 
 hiatus being nearl\- obsolete. Hectognathopoda smooth ; their inner 
 margins not in contact, but separated by a sufficiently conspicuous 
 subrhomboidal space in which lie the palpi. Subhepatic and sub- 
 branchial regions smooth. Chelopoda large, resembling those of 
 Eucratc : meros with a tooth near the summit; carpus smooth, with 
 a small tooth at its inner angle ; hands smooth, fingers slender, de- 
 flexed, white. Ambulatory feet slender, somewhat hairy, those of 
 the second pair longest. Abdomen and posterior half of sternum 
 minutely pubescent. The abdomen is narrow and tapering. 

Dimensions: Length of carapax, 0.32; breadth, 0.4 inch. 

The carapax in this species is narrower than in any other form of 
 Xanthidre. The form, the shortness of the antero-lateral margin, 
 the form of the hands, and some other characters may perhaps indi- 
 cate a genus distinct from that to which it is here referred. The 
 general appearance is much like that of some forms of Gonoplacidc-e 
 and Carcinoplacidse, but the position of the male verges is the same 
 as in the Cancroids. 

Found at Hongkong. 

Genus PTLUMXUS Leach 

The numerous species referred to this genus, more than thirty of 
 which have been now described, will probably be found upon critical 
 examination to afford characters which will require its separation 
 into several groups. Some of those described below are placed here 
 with much hesitation, although agreeing with the received diagnosis 
 of the genus. 

The basal joint of the external antennae is somewhat mobile in all 
 the species which we have examined.
