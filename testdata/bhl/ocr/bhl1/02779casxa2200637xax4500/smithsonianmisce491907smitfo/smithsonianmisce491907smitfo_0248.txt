66 SMITHSONIAN MISCELLANEOUS COLLECTIONS 

The figure given by Adams and White of their P. ursuhis looks 
 extremely like this species, but their description does not apply to it. 

It is found on the reefs near low-water mark, generally in the 
 crevices of the rock, to which they retreat upon the approach of the 
 observer. It occurred to us at Loo Choo and Ousima and in Caspar 
 Straits. 

The P. vespcrtilio of Dana seems to be a distinct species resem- 
 blingf somewhat P. scabriculus of Adams and White. The inferior 
 margins of the hands are granulated and the body and feet are only 
 sparsely covered with long setae. I would propose to call it P. daiiai.

Plate VIII, Fig. 3 

Pilumniis rufopunctatus Stimpson, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., x, p. 36 
 {Z3], 1858. 

Body and chelopoda pubescent above with very short but rather 
 stout setae ; feet hirsute. Carapax broad ; proportion of length to 
 breadth, 1:1.4; surface smooth posteriorly, anteriorly areolate and 
 ornamented with about twenty blood red, subspiniform granules 
 or small tubercles. Three of these tubercles are placed on the ir.iddle 
 of the gastric region, close together in the median line ; four, some- 
 what distant from each other, in an arch parallel with the superior 
 margin of the orbit ; one on each side of the group on the gastric re- 
 gion ; and one near the lateral tooth ; the remainder are scattered be- 
 tween these. Antero-lateral margin with three teeth, the first sepa- 
 rated by a wide space from the angle of the orbit, in which space 
 there is a spiniform tubercle (normally the second tooth) upon the 
 subhepatic region, which forms the first of a series of three or four 
 passing beneath the inferior margin of the orbit. Front rather nar- 
 row, somewhat deflected ; margin denticulated and very slightly 
 emarginated at the middle. Superior margin of orbit with three or 
 four small, irregularly distant teeth ; inferior margin six-toothed. 
 Surface of internal suborbital lobe granulated. Chelopoda robust ; 
 carpus and hand above and externally covered with sharply pro- 
 jecting subdistant granules; larger hand smooth and glossy below. 
 Sternum smooth, not pubescent. 

Color brownish above, with scattered red dots (tubercles) upon 
 the anterior part of the carapax. Larger hand yellowish below : 
 fingers black. Dimensions of a male : Length of carapax, 0.43 ; 
 breadth, 0.6 inch. 

Found among muddy and weedy stones near low-water mark in 
 Port Jackson, Australia.
