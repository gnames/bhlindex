Body and feet covered with a thick short pubescence, which rises 
 in transverse ridges or tufts on the anterior part of the carapax, 
 corresponding to the areolets. Carapax convex, proportion of length 
 to breadth in the male : i : i .458 ; areolate toward the front and 
 antero-lateral margins. Surface beneath the pubescence smooth and 
 glossy. A prominent, sharp tubercle on the surface near the third 
 antero-lateral tooth ; and another, very small near the fifth or pos- 
 terior tooth. Antero-lateral margin five-toothed ; angle of orbit 
 sharply prominent ; a second tooth inferior, or subhepatic ; posterior 
 three teeth acute and projecting. Front rather narrow, deeply 
 divided at the middle by an emargination or fissure ; lobes much 
 projecting, and rounded. Upper margin of orbit two-notched; 
 lower margin minutely denticulated, with the inner angle strongly 
 projecting and tooth-like. Hectognathopoda rather short and broad; 
 their surface, as well as that of the neighboring regions, pubescent. 
 Chelopoda unequal ; carpus with ten or more small scattered tubercles 
 upon its upper surface ; hand sharply granulated above, the granules 
 not crowded, and mostly concealed by the pubescence ; below, smooth 
 and glossy. Dimensions of a male : Length of carapax, 0.32 ; 
 breadth, 0.465 inch. 

Found at Port Jackson, Australia.

 Upper surface of body and feet minutely pubescent, with scattered 
 long clavate setse, most conspicuous on the margins of the feet. 
 Carapax broad, proportion of length to breadth in the male, i : 1-37. 
 Surface toward the anterior margins somewhat areolate. A strong 
 protuberance on each side near the middle lateral tooth. Antero- 
 lateral margin with three projecting but obtuse teeth, besides the 
 angle of the orbit; and a protuberance on the subhepatic region, 
 some ways beneath the interval between the angle of the orbit and 
 the first of the three teeth. Front with a smooth and clean surface, 
 free from pubescence ; it projects a little and is slightly emarginate 
 at the middle. Inferior margin of the orbit thick and protuberant,
