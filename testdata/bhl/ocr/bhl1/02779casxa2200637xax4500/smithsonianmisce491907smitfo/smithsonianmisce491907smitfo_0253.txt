CRUSTACEA NORTH PACIFIC EXPLORING EXPEDITION 69 

nunierous but not deeply separated, and rendered indistinct by the 
 short pubescence which covers them. Antero-lateral margin with 
 three small teeth, and a slight projection on the subhepatic region 
 between the first tooth and the angle of the orbit. Suj^erior margin 
 of the orbit, and that of the front, denticulated. Front rather broad, 
 nearly straight when viewed from above; median lobes broadly 
 rounded and somewhat projecting downward. Surface of hecto- 
 gnathopoda smooth and glossy. Chelopoda robust; carpus above 
 somewhat pubescent, and papillose toward its inner angle. Hands 
 naked, their upper and outer surfaces covered with conical rose- 
 colored papillae, somewhat variable in size and so crowded against 
 each other that their bases are polygonal. These papillae give the 
 hand a beautiful ston\- or crystalline appearance, its surface being 
 more like that of a shell (Buccinujii papillosiun for instance) than 
 that of a crab. The fingers are also minutely papillose, and slightly 
 grooved longitudinally ; both are short : the thumb triangular. The 
 fingers of the left hand are compressed, with thin sharp, nearly 
 smooth cutting edges as in the preceding species. Ambulatory feet 
 tomentose and somewhat hairy above. Abdomen tomentose. Di- 
 mensions of a male : Length of carapax. 0.5 ; breadth, 0.65 ; of a 
 female ; length, 0.48 ; breadth. 0.65 inch. 

Dredged from a shelly and sandy bottom in twenty-five fathoms 
 in the China Sea between Formosa and the Chinese coast. 

The character of the fingers of the smaller hand in the two species 
 just described might well form the basis for the establishment of a 
 new genus.

Ijody and feet hirsute above, not very thickly, with setae of variable 
 but moderate length. Carapax scarcely areolate, broad ; proportion 
 of length to breadth, i : 1.43; surface nearly smooth. Antero-lateral 
 margin short, with four sharp teeth, including the angle of the orbit ; 
 no subhepatic tooth. Inferior margin of orbit denticulated. Eyes 
 with rather long peduncles. Front emarginate, with a row of long 
 setae just above the margin. Chelopoda rather small: larger hand 
 irregularly tuberculose above, smooth below: smaller hand (the left 
 one) spinulose above, and sparsely granulose on the outer side; 
 fingers pale brownish. 

Color a clear light brick-red. Beneath pale red; sternum white. 
 Fingers with brown tips. Eyes straw-colored- Dimensions of a 
 female: Length of carapax, 0.31 ; breadth, 0.43 inch.
