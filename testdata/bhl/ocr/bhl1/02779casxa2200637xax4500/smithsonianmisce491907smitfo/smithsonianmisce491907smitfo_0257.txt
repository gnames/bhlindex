and covering the deeply concave postero-lateral slopes of the cara- 
 pax. The outline of the postero-lateral margin is so deeply concave 
 as to form nearly a right angle at the middle. Some other species 
 of the genus, as P. globosus Dana, exhibit similar characters, but 
 none in so great a degree. 

Carapax strongly convex, transverse ; proportion of length to 
 breadth, 1:1.32. Surface rather deeply areolate ; areolets granu- 
 lated and pubescent. Antero-lateral margin four-toothed (the angle 
 of the orbit included) ; teeth equal, with sharp tips and denticulated 
 margins. The furrows separating the teeth are continued inferiorly 
 for some little distance on the subbranchial region. Median lobes 
 of front rather prominent, equally rounded. Chelopoda large, un- 
 equal, minutely pubescent above, that on the left side smaller : hand 
 granulated above on the outer side and on the inner inferior edge, 
 the granules sharply projecting. Carpus with scattered granules, 
 smallest and most crowded on a ridge around the outer base of the 
 hand, within which there is a smooth parallel groove. Ambulatorv 
 feet rather short and broad, pubescent and hair}- above, nearly 
 smooth below. Abdomen and sternum of male pubescent. 

Color of carapax obscured by the pubescence ; reddish-brown, 
 with darker spots. Dimensions of a male: Length of carapax, 0.41 ; 
 breadth, 0.54 inch. 

Dredged from a shelly bottom, in 10 fathoms, in the harbor of 
 Hongkong, China.

Our specimens agree perfectly with those of Dana. There is little 
 doubt of their being the same as those of Milne Edwards, not- 
 withstanding the absence of a distinct "crete horizontale" on the 
 teeth of the antero-lateral margins. The dimensions of the single 
 specimen in our collection, a female, are, length of carapax, 0.6: 
 breadth, 0.94 inch. 

It was taken at Great Loo Choo Island.
