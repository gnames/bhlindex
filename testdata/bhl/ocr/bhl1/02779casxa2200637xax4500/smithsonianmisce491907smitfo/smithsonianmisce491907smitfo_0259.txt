breadth, i.oi inches. It agrees well in most characters with ^ilediter- 
 ranean specimens, although we have had no opportunity of com- 
 paring it with an individual of the same age. The chief difference 
 is that in our specimen the feet are thickly covered above with stout 
 clavate setre. The tubercles of the hands are numerous, and rather 
 subspiniform than rounded, although blunt, and the antero-lateral 
 teeth are sharp, spiniform, and not denticulated on their sides.

Carapax much broader in the male than in the female. Lateral 
 tooth small and little projecting, but acute. Front sinuous as in T. 
 cymodoce- Chelopoda of moderate size, flattened ; carpus obtuse ; 
 inner margin of meros convex and serrated with five or six teeth, 
 those next the carpus little prominent. Ambulatory feet very 
 sparsely pubescent ; dactylus considerably shorter than the penult 
 joint. This species is of a clear wine-yellow color, with a uniform 
 rather close reticulation in fine crimson lines ; below, the reticulation 
 appears on the body but not on the feet. Eyes black. Fingers pale 
 brown. Dimensions of a male : Length of carapax, 0.3 ; breadth, 
 0.35 inch ; female, length, 0.3 : breadth, 0.37 inch. 

It resembles T. arcolata Dana, but the areolae enclosed by the 
 colored network are much smaller and more numerous ; the lateral 
 teeth are smaller, and the teeth on the inner angle of the meros much 
 less prominent. 

Found on coral drawn up from a depth of one or two fathoms on 
 the west coast of Loo Choo.
