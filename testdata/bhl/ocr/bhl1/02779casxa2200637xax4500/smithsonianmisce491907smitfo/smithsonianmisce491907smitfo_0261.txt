There are two sufficiently distinct varieties of this species. That 
 figured by Riippell, in which the frontal teeth are sharp, is found 
 on the shores of the continent of Asia, chiefly in muddy estuaries. 
 It may be seen in great numbers in the markets of Hongkong and 
 Canton. The colors in living individuals an^ as follows : Carapax 
 olive green above, white below ; hands often reddish, and spotted 
 with green exteriorly, fingers always red; feet pale greenish, with 
 darker spots below. 

In Dana's variety ocean ica the frontal teeth are blunt, with the 
 median incision deepest ; and the posterior tooth of the antero-lateral 
 margin is longer than in the other variety. This form is found 
 among the Pacific Islands, and was taken by us at Loo Choo.
