placed near the articulation of the fingers, at a distance from them

 of the posterior pair. Abdomen of male of a triangular form, though

This species in life is of a dark gray color above, with oblong or 
 Hnear spots of black ; below palish white. The lateral spines are 
 not generally quite as long as in the specimen figured by De Haan.

In this small species the lateral spine equals in length more than 
 half the width of the body excluding spines. The teeth of the 
 antero-lateral margin are minute. An acute tooth or short spine at 
 the posterior corner of the carapax. Third pair of ambulatory feet 
 long. 

The distinctions between this and several allied species may be 
 stated thus: From A. !o>tgispina and A. vigilaiis it differs in having 
 but one spine near the base of the fingers on the upper side of the 
 hand. From A. tenuipcs, which it resembles in the length of the 
 ambulatory feet, it differs in the spines at the posterior corners of 
 the carapax. And from A. liastatoidcs it differs in its more slender
