chelopoda, longer lateral spines and ambulatory feet, by the presence 
 of a tooth on the superior margin of the orbit, and in having the 
 lateral teeth or lobes of the interantennal front more prominent 
 than the median ones. 

This species is of a white color^ punctate with dark-brown. The 
 onl}' specimen taken is probably young. 

Dredged on a muddy bottom in "Ten-fathom-hole" in the harbor 
 of Port Lloyd, Bonin Islands.

The Lupa gladiator of Milne Edwards is described by him as 
 "peu ou point granuleuse," and therefore can scarcely be the same 
 as the species figured by De Haan, for which we propose a separate 
 designation. 

The general color is orange or reddish, sometimes mottled with 
 white. The granules are often crimson. There are often bright 
 purple spots at the articulations of the posterior pair of feet. 

It was taken by us at the following localities : In the China Sea, 
 in the parallel of 23° N., in 20 fathoms, sandy bottom; at Tanega- 
 sima, in 12 fathoms, on clean white sand; in Kagosima Bay, at the 
 -depth of 15 fathoms.

This species is closely allied to A. haanii in general appearance, 
 in the character of the front, the granulated areas of the carapax, 
 etc., but appears constantly to dififer in the smaller size of the lateral 
 spine or posterior antero-lateral tooth, which is never more than 
 twice as long as the next one. And the antero-lateral teeth in both 
 of De Haan's figures are much more widely separated than in our 
 species, in which they are close together and curved forward. The 
 median teeth of the interantennal front are equal in size to the lateral 

"■ Portunus (Achelous) gladiator (Fabricius). 

" Combined, by Alcock, with the preceding species.
