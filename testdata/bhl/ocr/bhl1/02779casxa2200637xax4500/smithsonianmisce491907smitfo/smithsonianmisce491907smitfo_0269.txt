Our specimens agree very well with the species to which they are 
 here referred, although much better with the figure than with the 
 description of De Haan. There are some tlifferences, however, 
 which it is important to mention. The four median teeth of the 
 front in our specimens are sufficiently well separated from the 
 others ; in C. variegata they are said not to be so separated. The 
 hand is conspicuously rugose with transverse ridges (squamose), a 
 character not mentioned in De Haan's diagnosis. And the antero- 
 lateral margin is rather more convex than is represented in the 
 figure. 

The frontal teeth are not "aigues et egalement espacees," as in 
 Tlialamita calliaiiassa Milne Edwards (non Cancer calliaiiassa 
 Herbst). 

Several specimens were dredged in the northern part of the China 
 Sea.

fig. I. 

Easily distinguished by its sharp frontal and antero-lateral teeth, 
 the posterior one of which is considerably more projecting than the 
 others. Some specimens are glossy and others pubescent. In the 
 glossy specimens the hands are also naked and the cost?e ungranu- 
 lated. The color is deep green. 

In our specimens the incisions 'separating the middle four teeth 
 from the others are a little deeper than the other frontal notches, 
 and the penult joint of the natatory feet is always conspicuously 
 spinulose along the inferior edge. 

Found among rocks and stones on coarse, sandy ground, at and 
 near low-water mark, in a bav near Hongkong, China.
