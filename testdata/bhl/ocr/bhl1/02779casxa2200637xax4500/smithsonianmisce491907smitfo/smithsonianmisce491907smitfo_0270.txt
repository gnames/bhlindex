Dimensions of a male: Length of carapax. 2.36; breadth, 3.4 
 inches.

 Harbor. 

123. CHARYBDIS MILES De Haan 

Cliarybdis miles De Haan, Fauna Japonica, Crust., p. 41, pi. xi, fig. i. 

A single specimen- only was collected, a female, the dimensions of 
 which are: Length of carapax, 1.65; breadth, 2.27 inches; propor- 
 tion, I : 1.37. It is thus a little narrower than those measured by 
 De Haan, in which the proportion stands i : 1.445. 

Taken at Hongkong, China, a point at which the Portunidae seem 
 to reach their maximum development in size and in numbers, both 
 of species and individuals. 

124. CHARYBDIS TRUNCATA (Fabricius) Stimpson 

Portunus truncatiis Fabricius, Suppl., p. 365. 

Tlmlamifa friincata JNIilne Edwards, Hist. Nat. des Crust, i, 463. DE 

Haan, Fauna Japonica. Crust., p. 43, pi. 11, fig. 3, pi. xii, fig. 3.' 
 Cliarybdis truncala Stimpson, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., x, p. 39 [2,7], 

1858. 

This species seems to have much more affinity with Charybdis 
 than with the genus Tlialaniita, to which it is referred by De Haan. 
 Among the very numerous specimens in our collection there are 
 none so large (two inches in breadth) as those mentioned by Milne 
 Edwards. And the description of this latter zoologist applies by no 
 means as well to our specimens as do the figures and description of 
 De Haan. 

Colors in life: Carapax above dirty greenish; feet with transverse 
 bars or patches of reddish-brown ; below white. 

Very common in Hongkong Harbor. 

^Charybdis natator (Herbst). 

-In pi. XII, fig. 3, of de Haan the male is the true trimcatus of Fabricius; 
 the female is C. siibuntata Ortmann.
