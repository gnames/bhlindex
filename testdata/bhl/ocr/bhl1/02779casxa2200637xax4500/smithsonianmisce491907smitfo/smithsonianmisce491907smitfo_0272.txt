than below ; on the lower surface they are most regular and nearly 
 continuous, being interrupted only at the median groove. Anterior 
 margin of meros-joint with two strong curved teeth near the denti- 
 form outer angle, and six or eight small tuberculiform teeth toward 
 the base ; four small tubercles on the surface above and between the 
 large teeth. No teeth on the outer side of the meros. which is only 
 squamose. Carpus strongly squamose and pubescent ; a strong 
 spine at the summit and three small ones on the outer surface. 
 Hand with five spines above and two or three costje on the outer 
 surface ; fingers strongly grooved, the ridges between the grooves 
 smooth and glossy. Ambulatory feet pubescent; penult and ante- 
 penult joints grooved; penult joint of natatory feet with no spines 
 on its posterior margin, terminal joint with the sharp tip projecting 
 considerably beyond the margin. 

Colors in life : Above, obscured by the pubescence, blackish and 
 whitish mottled; below, bluish; mouth and parts adjacent, reddish; 
 pincers with black blotch at the middle, tips white. Dimensions of 
 the male: Length of carapax, 1.5; breadth, 2.48 inches. 

De Haan's T. arcuatns is perhaps the young of our species, but 
 the hands are described as smooth below. 

Found abundantly in sheltered bays near Hongkong, China, on 
 muddy bottoms, in 4 to 6 fathoms ; it also occurred in Caspar Straits 
 and at Simoda, Japan.

Thalamita crcnata Rf ppEll, Krabben des rothen Meeres, p. 6, pi. v. fig. 2. 
 Milne Edwards, Hist. Nat. des Crust., i, 461 (?). 

Carapax glossy, free from pubescence except toward the margins. 
 Crest of basal joint of antennae not projecting beyond the frontal 
 margin. Outer surface of hand smooth. In some of our speci- 
 mens, as in those of Riippell, there are a few spines on the posterior 
 border of the penult joint of the natatory feet. Color in life dark 
 green above, paler below ; pincers dark red, with yellowish teeth. 

Taken in a seine from a small muddy creek in Napa Harbor, Loo 
 Choo, where it seems to be abundant ; also found at Hongkong. 

There are evidently two species confounded under the name T. 
 crenata, and we are somewhat in doubt as to which species the name 
 should be applied. Riippell's figure certainly represents the smoother 
 species, rather than that called T. crenata by Dana, which latter, 
 however, may not improbably be the T. crenata of Milne Edwards,
