Trichiiccra gibbosula De Haan. Fauna Japonica, Crust., p. 45. pi. 11. fig. 4,

Our single specimen is small, about one-third of an inch in length. 
 The rostrum is more projecting and the protuberances of the dorsal 
 surface of the carapax much sharper than is represented in De 
 Haan's figures. There is little doubt, however, that it is only the 
 young of the species above cited. 

Dredged from a sandy bottom, in 30 fathoms, off the northeast 
 coast of Niphon.
