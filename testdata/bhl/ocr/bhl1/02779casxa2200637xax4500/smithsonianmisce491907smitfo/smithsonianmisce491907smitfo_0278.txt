 narrower carapax and more projecting 'front; from K. rugulosa and 
 K. porccllana in the want of spines on the antero-lateral margin.

Carapax rather narrow ; proportion of length to distance between 
 tips of lateral teeth, i : 1.26. Surface covered with setiferous tuber- 
 cles, mostly transverse, as in other species of the genus. Lateral 
 tooth slender, sharp, the principal or middle one very long, a small 
 intermediate tooth at the base of the principal one behind. Between 
 the teeth and sometimes on their edges there are a few small spini- 
 form denticles. Interantennal front or rostrum with a deep median 
 sinus and a smaller sinus or excavation at the tip of each fork, as in 
 C. hippocarcinoides. Antennje more than one-third as long as the 
 carapax. Feet all squamose or scabrous and setose. Chelopoda 
 somewhat spinous above ; hand costate externally, the costae sharply 
 tuberculated. 

Color in life light brick-red above ; paler, inclining to yellowish, 
 below. Some specimens are of an orange color, but always dusky. 
 Pincers dark brown. Dimensions of a male : Length of carapax, 
 1.45; breadth between tips of lateral teeth, 1.83 inches. It grows to 
 a length of three inches, but the larger specimens, of which several 
 were collected, were accidentally lost. 

It may be distinguished from C. hippocarcinoides as found on the 
 west coast of America, as well as from TeJmcsstis serratus White, by 
 the greater length and acuteness of the lateral teeth, particularly the 
 larger one ; also by the existence of a small intermediate tooth be- 
 hind the large one. 

This crab is very common in the Bay of Hakodadi. in northern 
 Japan. It is commonly taken with the seine on sandy shores, but 
 often occurs on gravelly beaches above low-water mark. In June 
 the young, of half an inch to an inch in length, were much more 

Telmcssiis acutidcns (Stimpson).
