last pair of feet curved upward. The "hebdosternite," or last joint 
 of the sternum, is entirely covered by the base of the abdomen in the 
 male and nearly covered in the female. The male organs are large, 
 arising from the coxal joints of the posterior feet, and are concealed 
 beneath the abdomen, but they do not immediately enter the abdom- 
 inal appendages, being conducted to them in a depression of the ster- 
 num scarcely deep enough to be called a canal. The male abdomen 
 is very narrow except at the base, where it rather abruptly widens to 
 cover the last joint of the sternum and interjacent organs; the seg- 
 ments are all distinct, none soldered. 

This genus differs from Carcinoplax in its narrower carapax and 
 short chelipeds; from Pscudorhombila in its flattened dactyli. The 
 species are all inhabitants of the Chinese and Japanese seas.

The following description was drawn up from a male, which, as it 
 happens, is the only male specimen of the genus met with during the 
 exploration : 

Carapax moderately convex in front, posteriorly flattened ; propor- 
 tion of length to breadth, i : 1.26. A slight longitudinal ridge or 
 angle on each side above and parallel with the postero-lateral margin. 
 The upper surface is naked and nearly smooth, not granulated ; the 
 regions scarcely distinct. A curved sulcus extends somewhat irreg- 
 ularly from the depressed genital region to the lateral tooth. The 
 median frontal sulcus is rather deep, posteriorly bifurcating on the 
 pregastric region. Front broad, straight, little projecting, and 
 notched at the middle. The frontal margin is double, or divided by 
 a well-marked transverse sulcus. The antennary notches are deep. 
 Antennse naked, very slender, and nearly half as long as the carapax. 
 Antero-lateral margin very short, posteriorly continuous with the 
 postero-lateral ; it is four-toothed, including the angle of the orbit, the 
 third tooth largest and a little raised. Latero-inferior regions con- 
 vex; horizontal suture deep. External maxillipeds smooth and 
 glossy. Chelipeds moderately large, smooth ; meros with a tooth 
 close to its superior extremity ; carpus lanose externally around base 
 of hand ; hand short, glossy ; fingers longer than palm, crossing at 
 the tips, moderately toothed within ; immovable finger margined 
 below with a slight crest exteriorly. Ambulatory feet smooth, long, 
 very slender, somewhat compressed and slightly hairy ; penult and
