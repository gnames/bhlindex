are two smooth, oblong longitudinal ones on the anterior part of the 
 gastric region just behind the front. These, as well as two near the 
 anterior corners of the carapax, are very prominent. Lateral margin 
 anteriorly with five tuberculiform or paxilliform teeth, the posterior 
 two smooth, the two next anteriorly prominent and setose, the an- 
 terior one small, forming the angle of the orbit. Front deflexed, 
 with a supramarginal fringe of long hairs ; margin curved and 
 notched at the middle. Eye peduncles setose. The grooves sepa- 
 rating the posterior teeth of the lateral margin are continued for a 
 considerable distance upon the sub-branchial region, passing obliquely 
 forward. Chelipeds with the meros and carpus deeply sculptured 
 with setose grooves, dividing the upper side of each joint into five or 
 six prominent, smooth, wart-like protuberances. A small, sharp 
 tooth at the inner angle of the carpus. Outer surface of hand with 
 a setose coating, beneath which there are minute sharp granules 
 showing a tendency to arrangement in longitudinal rows. Ambu- 
 latory feet longitudinally grooved. Dimensions : Length of carapax, 
 0.22 ; breadth, 0.28 inch.

Piluiniioplax ciliafa Stimpson, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., x, p. 94 [40], 
 1858. 

Description of a female : Anterior margins of body and feet densely 
 ciliated with long hair-like setse. Carapax broad, somewhat nar- 
 rowed and flattened posteriorly. Proportion of length to breadth, 
 1 : 1.58. Upper surface even and nearly smooth, pubescent, a few 
 granules distantly scattered toward the margins. Seven short longi- 
 tudinal sulci on the frontal and supraorbital regions, the median one 
 arising from the frontal emargination. Front broad, with a supra- 
 marginal series of long setae continuous with those on the orbital and 
 antero-lateral margins. Orbit with two deep fissures at the outer 
 side, one above and one below the exterior angle ; a slight fissure also 
 on the superior margin. Antero-lateral margin with three deep 
 notches dividing four teeth, the anterior one being confounded with 
 the angle of the orbit ; teeth all broadly truncated with the exception 
 of the posterior one, which is small and sharp. Subhepatic region 
 behind the orbit eroded or rugose. Basal joint of antennae rather 
 short. Chelipeds short, equal ; meros with a thin, sharp, irregularly 
 dentated superior crest ; carpus hairy, with the inner angle acute ; 
 Tiand sharply granulated and setose, with the exception of its inner
