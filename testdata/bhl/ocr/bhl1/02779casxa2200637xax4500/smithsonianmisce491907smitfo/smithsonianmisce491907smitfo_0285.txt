surface and a space externally at the base of the fingers, which ap- 
 pears as if worn smooth; setae of superior margin very long; lingers 
 somewhat cleflexed, rounded, a little gaping, deeply sulcated within, 
 externally partly granulated. Ambulatory feet, compressed, those 
 of the penuh pair longest ; superior margins of last three joints cili- 
 ated ; meros- joint with a smooth, sharp, thin superior crest. Dactylus 
 of posterior pair short, little more than half as long as that of penult 
 pair, and somewhat curved. Dimensions of carapax : Length, 0.38 ; 
 breadth, 0.6 inch. 

Of this curious species a single specimen only was obtained. It 
 is much broader than other species of the genus, and were it not for 
 its deeply toothed and ciliated antero-lateral margin and its short 
 chelipeds might well be referred to Carcinoplax. 

It was found in the port of Simoda, Japan.

This is a very small species, of which, however, a sufBcient number 
 of examples were taken to illustrate it fully. The carapax is very 
 broad, with a hard, smooth, ivory-like surface. Proportion of length 
 to breadth, i : 1.75. Sides evenly rounded, tumid, with a slightly 
 raised horizontal marginal line or crest, the antero-lateral portion of 
 which is armed with two or three very minute, inconspicuous teeth. 
 Front broad, straight, slightly pointed at the middle. Orbits small, 
 rounded, margins entire. Subhepatic regions swollen. Palate 
 divided by a ridge on either side. Buccal area short, very broad in 
 front and narrowed behind. External maxillipeds nearly as in C. 
 longimana, except that the exognath is broader, wdth a spiniform 
 tooth, and the outer margin of the endognath is deeply concave; the 
 meros is much broader than the ischium and much produced at its 
 external apex or auricle ; finally the palpus is rather endarthroid than 
 goniarthroid. Chelipeds long and slender, with glossy surface ; meros 
 slightly hairy on the edges ; carpus small ; hand elongated with a 
 smoothly-rounded and somewhat swollen palm ; fingers slender, as 
 long as the palm, sharply dentated within, teeth small, tips hooked, 
 crossing each other. Ambulatory feet slender, w'ith hairy edges. 
 Abdomen of the male triangular, median segments soldered, margin 
 toothed at base. Abdomen of the female triangular. 

The color in life is pale brownish or yellowish ; three diverging 
 white streaks on the posterior part of the carapax; chelipeds darker;
