beneath white. Dimensions of the carapax in a male: Length. 0.16; 
 breadth, 0.28 inch. 

It was dredged from a muddy bottom, in the "ten-fathom hole," at 
 Port Lloyd. Bonin Islands. 

Genus HETEROPLAX Stimpson 

This genus is allied to Carcinoplax in the character of the male 
 organs, and to Gonoplax in the shape of the carapax and the form 
 of the orbits. The carapax is trapezoidal, the facial region occupy- 
 ing nearly its whole width anteriorly. Front rather broad, notched 
 on either side at the insertion of the antennae. Eye-peduncles stout 
 and of moderate length. Antennae long and slender, the basal joint 
 movable, narrow, elongated, its outer apex filling the hiatus of the 
 orbit and nearly excluding the flagellum therefrom. Epistome 
 ample. Palatal ridge sufficiently distinct at the anterior buccal mar- 
 gin. External maxillipeds resembling those of Gonoplax, with 
 goniarthroid palpus. Chelipeds short, robust ; fingers oblique. Am- 
 bulatory feet slender, the third pair longest ; dactylus compressed. 
 Abdomen of the male very narrow, but expanded at base so as to 
 cover the posterior segment of the sternum and reach the coxae of 
 the posterior feet. The virgulse, or male organs, arise from these 
 coxal joints, but reach the abdominal appendages through shallow 
 grooves on the sternum. 

The species are found on the coast of China. 

142. HETEROPLAX DENTATA Stimpson 

Hcteroplax dcntata Stimpson, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., x, p. 94 
 [40], 1858. 

Carapax narrow, a httle broader at the principal lateral tooth than 
 at the angle of the orbit. Proportion of length to breadth, i : 1.27. 
 Surface smooth and glossy ; regions inconspicuous. Hepatic region 
 depressed. Antero-lateral and postero-lateral margins nearly con- 
 tinuous, the former very short, with four unequal teeth, the third 
 tooth much the largest and most prominent, placed at a higher level 
 than the second and projecting over it; fourth or posterior tooth in- 
 conspicuous, formed only by a slight emargination. Front straight, 
 somewhat bimarginate ; no median notch. Eyes large. Chelipeds 
 short, smooth, and glossy; a small tooth near the summit of the 
 meros-joint and one at the inner angle of the carpus, and a tuft of 
 pubescence on the outer surface at the juncture of the carpus and 
 hand.
