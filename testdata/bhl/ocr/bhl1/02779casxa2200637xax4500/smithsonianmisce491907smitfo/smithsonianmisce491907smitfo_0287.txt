The colors in life are as follows : Carapax gray or brown, whitish 
 posteriori}-, and with a transverse narrow white band behind the 
 eyes. The frontal region and feet punctate with red. The species 
 presents little or no variation in color. Dimensions of the carapax 
 in a male : Length, 0.3 ; breadth, 0.383 inch. 

Found in considerable numbers on shelly bottoms, in lo and 15 
 fathoms, among the islands on the coast of China near Hongkong.

 [40], 1858. 

This species is allied to H. dciitata, but may be distinguished by 
 its much broader carapax, the proportion of length to breadth in 
 which is i: 1.46. The principal lateral tooth is smaller but acute; 
 the tooth forming the angle of the orbit is more prominent, and the 
 second tooth almost obsolete. The ocular peduncles are longer. 
 Colors as in the preceding species. Dimensions of carapax in a 
 male: Length, 0.26; breadth, 0.38 inch. 

Taken in the harbor of Hongkong.^

The color of the (young) specimens taken by us w^as pale grayish 
 with whitish mottlings ; darker anteriorly. They were dredged from 
 a depth of 10 fathoms on a sandy mud bottom in the harbor of Napa, 
 Loo Choo. 

'The family Rhizopidse, comprising two pages of Stimpson's "Prodromus" 
 and Nos. 144 to 148, inclusive, of the species, is missing from the manuscript 
 of this report; also the illustrations of this family, as well as of other 
 Ocypodoidea. This gap existed in 1875, when the manuscript was examined 
 by Prof. Sidney I. Smith, and it is probable that the missing parts were 
 removed by Dr. Stimpson himself for further study and were destroyed in the 
 Chicago fire in 1871.
