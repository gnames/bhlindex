his C. hoscii (vix Macrophthahnits hoscii Auct.) this character is 
 apparent, but the maxilHpeds are widely gaping", while in De Haan's 
 Cleistostoma they fit close to each other along the inner edges â€” a 
 character from which the name of the genus was derived. In Milne 
 Edwards's Euplox, which would include, according to the French 
 naturalist, the true M. hoscii, the maxilHpeds are said to resemble 
 those of Macrophthalnms, where the meros is much smaller than the 
 ischium. So that Dana's species will not strictly belong to either 
 genus, and we have ventured to arrange it, with one other before 
 undescribed, under a new generic name. 

The carapax resembles that of Enplax, but the eyes and their pe- 
 duncles are considerably larger and thicker than in that genus.

This species differs from the MacrophtliaJuius hoscii of Savigny 
 in the larger meros-joint of the external maxilHpeds. The oblique 
 concavity on the surface of this joint is also deeper. 

It was found by us among the Loo Choo Islands.

The following is a description of a male: Carapax quadrilateral, 
 areolated, more convex posteriorly than anteriorly. Length to 
 breadth as i : 1.31. A deep and narrow longitudinal furrow on the 
 pregastric region, bifurcating posteriorly. Surface uneven, rough 
 and hairy toward the lateral margins, but smooth and glossy near 
 the middle. Lateral margin not denticulated ; there is, however, a 
 slight emargination behind the tooth forming the angle of the orbit. 
 The eyes are large, with thick peduncles, and reach slightly beyond 
 the extremity of the orbit. The front is broad, deflexed, and broadly 
 subtruncate below. Infraorbital margin minutely crenulated. The 
 anterior margin of the buccal area is deeply sinuous, the angles being 
 filled up by a protruding lobe, leaving a broad and deep sinus in the 
 middle, the margin of which is straight and salient ; this sinus is
