prominent. Chelipeds moderately elongated ; meros serrulated along- 
 the angles ; hand smooth, oblong, a little inflated within ; fingers 
 gaping, evenly denticulated within : tips excavated internally, with 
 sharp corneous outer edges for nipping or cutting. Ambulatory 
 feet long, smooth, pubescent at base, the first and last pairs reaching 
 only to the penult joints of the middle pairs, which joints are every- 
 where thickly pubescent ; dactyli somewhat compressed, five-sided 
 or quinquecostate, tapering to slender sharp extremities. Abdomen 
 with all the segments distinct ; terminal joint abruptly smaller than 
 the penult. The margin of the sternum is raised into a crest around 
 the terminal abdominal segment. Dimensions of the carapax : 
 Length, 0.46; breadth, 0.61 inch. Length of ambulatory feet of the 
 second pair, 1.38 inches. 

This species dififers from M. distinctus in the lobation of the infra- 
 orbital margin, and from M. indicus in its narrower carapax and the 
 distinct segmentation of the abdomen. 

Found in Hongkong Harbor. 

Genus ILYOPLAX Stimpson 

Body tetragonal, very thick. Carapax very little indurated. Front, 
 antennae, antennulse, and orbits nearly as in Macrophthalnms; the 
 front is, how'ever, broader than in that genus. Eye-peduncles suffi- 
 ciently long. External maxillipeds saillant, not gaping; exognath 
 concealed, palpigerous ; meros of endognath large, longer than broad, 
 and longer than the ischium ; ischium ornamented with an oblique, 
 almost transverse piliferous line placed close to the commissure of 
 the meros; palpus rather prosarthroid than exarthroid, projecting as 
 in Macrophthahnus. Chelipeds equal. Ambulatory feet rather stout, 
 those of the second pair conspicuously the longest; meros-joints with 
 membranaceous sides, or tympana occupying the entire faces ; dactyli 
 very small and slender. Sternum and male abdomen nearly as in 
 Macrophthahnus. 

This genus, although properly belonging to the family in which it 
 is here placed, in its thick body, soft structure, and tympanum-like 
 surfaces of the thigh-joints, will form a connecting link between the 
 Macrophthalmidae and the Dotillidre. 

It is an inhabitant of brackish waters on the shores of southeast- 
 ern Asia.
