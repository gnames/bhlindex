159. SCOPIMERA TUBERCULATA Stimpson 

Scopimera tuberculata Stimpson, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., x, p. 98 
 [44], 1858. 

Carapax broad, but much narrower on the dorsal surface than at 
 the bases of the anterior ambulatory feet. Length to greatest breadth 
 as I : 1.66. Surface uneven, the branchial and hepatic regions being 
 separated from each other and from the gastric and postmedian re- 
 gions by well-marked though irregular sulci. The upper surface, 
 with the exception of the broad and smooth postmedian region, is 
 everywhere studded with protuberances and tubercles, irregular in 
 their size and distance from each other. The lateral margins of the 
 back are prominent, ciliated, and passing backward and downward 
 are continuous with the suprapedal margins of the carapax. On each 
 side beneath the dorsal margins there is a deep, smooth longitudinal 
 sulcus. The sides are covered with setiferous granules, most crowded 
 below. Orbits ample, oblique, well excavated, external angle form- 
 ing a small tooth. External maxillipeds convex ; meros partly granu- 
 lated, more than half as large as ischium, and joined to it by an 
 oblique suture ; palpus rather exarthroid than prosarthroid, but 
 joined at the summit of the meros. Chelipeds equal, elongated, 
 more than twice as long as the carapax, but shorter than the first 
 pair of ambulatory feet. Ambulatory feet tapering, sparsely fringed 
 below with stiff blackish hairs ; tympana nearly as in 6". globosa or 
 Doto myctiroides. Abdomen as in S. globosa. Dimensions of the 
 body in a male : Length, 0.36 ; breadth at base of second ambulatory 
 feet, 0.6 inch. 

This species approaches Doto somewhat in character. It differs 
 from De Haan's S. globosa in the character of the upper surface of 
 the carapax and in the obliquity of the meros- joint in the outer 
 maxillipeds. 

It lives in holes in sandy-mud flats at and above low-water mark. 
 Found in the inner harbor of Simoda, Japan.

This crab, when alive, is of an opaque light-blue color above and 
 bluish-white below. The feet are white except at the joints, which
