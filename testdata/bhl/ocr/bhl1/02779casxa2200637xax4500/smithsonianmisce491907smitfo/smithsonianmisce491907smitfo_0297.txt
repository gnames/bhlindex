are pale reddish. It is very common on the shores of Botany Bay 
 and Port Jackson, Australia, living on sandy beaches, in holes of 
 slight depth, generally much above low-water mark. It is called 
 "soldier crab" by the colonists.

[45], 1858. 

Carapax short, globular, nearly smooth. Breadth to length as 
 1 : 1.06. Branchial regions but little inflated, microscopically gran- 
 ulated. On the posterior or depressed portion of the gastric region 
 there are two short, longitudinal depressed lines, parallel, one on 
 each side. There is a short, slender, blunt spine on each side near 
 the external angle of the orbit. Chelipeds nearly as in M. longicar- 
 pus, but stouter. Ambulatory feet also stouter than in the species 
 just mentioned, with short and thick dactyli. The dactylus in the 
 posterior pair is curved upward near the extremity, and trigonal in 
 shape, with the angles ciliated. 

Color of the carapax whitish blue, deeper about the middle of the 
 back. Feet white, pale reddish near their bases. Dimensions of a 
 male : Length of carapax, 0.682 ; breadth, 0.639 hich. 

This species is easily distinguished from M. longicarpus, which it 
 much resembles in general appearance, by the shorter and thicker 
 terminal joints of the ambulatory feet. It may prove to be the 
 M. dcHexifrons of De Haan, but we can nowhere find a description 
 of this species. 

It is found in great numbers on low sandy-mud shores and flats in 
 the lower half of the littoral zone. It occurred to us at Hongkong 
 and among the Loo Choo Islands. 

162. MYCTIRIS PLATYCHELES Milne Edwards

 Myctiris platychclcs Milne Edwards, Melanges Carcinologiques, p. 118. 

The description of Milne Edwards is as follows : "Carapace cou- 
 verte de petits points granuleux, tres espaces et tres saillants. Pattes 
 courtes et larges. â€” Port Western." It is not inconsistent with the 
 characters of our crab, but there are several prominent distinctive 
 characters not mentioned which render the identification, based 
 upon so short a diagnosis, somewhat uncertain.
