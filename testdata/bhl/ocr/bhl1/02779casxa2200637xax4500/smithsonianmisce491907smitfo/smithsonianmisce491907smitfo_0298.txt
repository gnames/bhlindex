I04 SMITHSONIAN MISCELLANEOUS COLLECTIONS 

The branchial regions are prominently inflated above, forming 
 subglobose projections, which are much more conspicuously granu- 
 lated than the rest of the carapax. The gastric region is nearly 
 smooth, bearing only a few scattered granuliform "points." In the 
 compressed ambulatory feet the penult joint bears two prominent 
 carinse, the dactylus four carinse. The meros-joint is somewhat in- 
 flated and granulated. The hectognathopoda are greatly expanded 
 and protruding, so as to lie in planes almost longitudinally vertical. 
 The rostrum is more pointed than in M. loiigicarpiis. and there is a 
 granulated projection instead of a spine exterior to the orbit. Color 
 in life as in M. loiigicarpus. Size also about the same. Our speci- 
 mens were taken on the shores of Botany Bay. in the third subregion 
 of the littoral zone. 

It is perhaps the same as .1/. subvcrnicatus White (Cat. Brit. 
 Mus., 1847, p. 34), of which no description has been published. If 
 it should prove distinct we would propose the name M. prostoma.
