It differs from G. forcipatiis Adams and White in having no 
 "dilated lobe between the eyes" and no great tooth near the end of 
 the fingers. The meros-joints of the walking-feet are less dilated 
 than in G. brevipes.

Carapax strongly convex in a longitudinal sense, its median dorsal 
 outline forming almost a semicircle. It is very broad anteriorly 
 (broadest at the prominent angles of the orbits) and considerably 
 narrowed behind. Length to breadth as i : 1.6. Branchial regions 
 not inflated. The lines bordering the anterior and antero-lateral 
 margins are sharply raised. Front very broad, somewhat truncated 
 below. The supraorbital margin is but slightly undulated, most so 
 near its exterior extremity ; both crests are minutely crenulated, and 
 the lower or anterior crest is less convex than usual. The peduncles of 
 the eyes are not very long, the eye falling a little short of the exterior 
 extremity of the orbit. The exterior angle of the crenulated inferior 
 margin of the orbit is broadly rounded, as in G. palustris. The large 
 cheliped of the male is well developed ; meros with obtuse, granu- 
 lated angles, and no very prominent tooth at the summit ; hand 
 minutely granulated, with palm about two-thirds as long as the fin- 
 gers, not strongly armed within, the inferior oblique crest prominent 
 with a single row of granules, the crest at base of fingers nearly ob- 
 solete, the superior crest not bifurcated and scarcely tuberculated ; 
 fingers slender, smooth, strongly gaping, their inner margins evenly 
 curved and minutely toothed, with two or three conical teeth a little 
 larger than the rest ; extremity of immovable finger longitudinally 
 emarginated. Ambulatory feet naked ; meros of moderate width ; 
 dactylus short, not compressed. 

Colors : The carapax is of a light opaque-blue color, transversely
