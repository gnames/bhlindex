CRUSTACEA NORTH PACIFIC EXPLORING EXPEDITION 10/ 

banded and spotted with black. Large cheliped pale red. Feet 
 purplish, mottled. External maxillipeds light blue. Lower surface 
 of body very pale bluish. Dimensions of a male : Length of cara- 
 pax, 0.49; breadth, 0.78; length of large hand, 1.35; breadth, 0.48 
 inch. 

This species is remarkable for its convexity and for the promi- 
 nence, without acuteness, of the anterior angles of the carapax. It 
 is allied to G. gaiiiiardi and to G. latrcillci of Milne Edwards (Me- 
 langes Carcinologiques, p. 114), and may prove identical with one 
 of these species, but the descriptions as yet published are too short 
 for certain identification. From the first-mentioned species ours 
 would appear to differ in having the front less prolonged and 
 rounded below, and from the second in the greater length and the 
 dentition of the pincers. 

Our species inhabits salt marshes on the shores of Hongkong 
 Harbor.

Of this species several male specimens were collected. They are 
 all of small size, but have the appearance of being nearly full grown. 
 Carapax strongly convex, narrowed behind, broad in front, where it 
 is prominent at the middle. Length to breadth as i : 1.51. Antero- 
 lateral angles acute, prominent. ^Marginal lines sufficiently distinct. 
 Front prominent, broad, rounded below. Eye-peduncles long, the 
 eyes reaching nearly, if not quite, to the extremities of the orbits. 
 Outer angle of the acutely crenulated inferior margin of the orbit 
 rounded. Large cheliped with nearly smooth surfaces, obsoletely 
 granulated ; hand armed within, the inferior crest prominent, granu- 
 lated, the superior crest very sparsely granulated. There are two 
 parallel crests at the base of the fingers, each ornamented with a 
 single row of small tubercles. On the outer surface of the hand at 
 the base of the immovable finger there is a small depressed area or 
 shallow pit, like a cicatrix, of an ovate or triangular form, which is 
 always present and affords a good specific character. The fingers 
 are rather short, slightly compressed ; the sides smooth ; the inner 
 margins denticulated, with two or three somewhat larger, conical 
 teeth interspersed; one of these larger teeth is situated close to the 

^ Uca pnlchclla (Stimpson).
