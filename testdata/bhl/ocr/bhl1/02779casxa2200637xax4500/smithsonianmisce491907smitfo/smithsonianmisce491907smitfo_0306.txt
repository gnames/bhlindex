with somewhat truncated extremities. Ambulatory feet, with the 
 exception of the terminal joints, naked, nearly smooth, but slightly 
 rugose, the rugae being similar in character to those in 0. ceratoph- 
 thalma, but much less strongly developed. Abdomen (of 'the fe- 
 male) with the penult joint deeply sinuated; the terminal joint set in 
 the bottom of the sinus, and reaching fully to, or a little beyond, the 
 bases of the maxillipeds. Dimensions of the carapax : Length, 0.92 ; 
 breadth, between the orbital angles, 0.96 inch. 

It differs from O. cordimana in the character of the maxillipeds, 
 smaller hand and feet. 

Found at Simoda. Japan.

The species here referred to O. cordimana, is distinguished by its 
 convex, faintly granulated carapax, little oblique orbits, little prom- 
 inent orbital angle, immediately behind which the lateral margin is 
 convex. The dentiform internal suborbital lobe is compressed, 
 rather broad and smooth, not denticulated. The buccal area is 
 small, narrowed anteriorly, with straight sides, and is neatly covered 
 by the external maxillipeds, which are not protuberant, as in most 
 species. The surface of the maxillipeds is glossy, with a few 
 sparsely scattered granules or points ; the meros- joint is depressed 
 in the middle, with a ridge on either side, as in O. ceratophthalma, 
 but not much granulated. The feet are nearly smooth, although 
 there are indications, on the meros- and carpus- joints, of the spinules 
 mentioned in Milne Edwards's description. They are somewhat 
 pilose toward their extremities. Dactylus of last pair much curved 
 upward and outward. Abdomen of the male much broader than in 
 other species. 

Found at Hongkong and at Loo Choo.

A small, well marked species, easily distinguished by the character 
 of the larger hand, which is much dilated below, and has very short 
 and thick fingers. Our specimen is somewhat larger than those 
 found bv Dana.
