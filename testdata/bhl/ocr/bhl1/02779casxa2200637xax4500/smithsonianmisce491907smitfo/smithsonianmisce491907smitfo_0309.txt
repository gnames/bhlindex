It is distinguished from O. cordimana by the projecting orbital 
 angles and by the smoothness of the edges of the hands.

A male individual, probably of this species, was found in its hole 
 in a cocoanut grove near the town of Porto Praya, Cape de Verde 
 Islands. In this specimen the carapax is exceedingly smooth, both 
 above and at the sides, and the antero-lateral line can scarcely be 
 traced : these characters we find in adult males of C. guanhwni from 
 the American shores. But in these western specimens one of the 
 hands is greatly developed in size, with broadly gaping fingers, while 
 in the expedition specimen the hands resemble those of the young of 
 C. giiaiihuiiii, in which the lateral line is distinct. The wide d-ififer- 
 ence in locality would lead us to consider the species different, but 
 we do not venture to separate it without seeing additional examples.

This species was found living in holes in the gardens and along 
 the streets in great numbers at Papiete, Island of Tahiti.

Cardisoina hirtipes Dana, U. S. Expl. Exped., Crust., i, 376, pi. xxiv, 
 fig. 2. 

Color in life reddish-brown ; feet and inferior surface yellow. We 
 can discover no essential dift'erence between the Loo Choo specimen 
 and those described by Dana from the Fiji Islands, with the single 
 exception that in ours, which is a male, the left hand is much larger 
 than the right, while in Dana's the hands are equal.
