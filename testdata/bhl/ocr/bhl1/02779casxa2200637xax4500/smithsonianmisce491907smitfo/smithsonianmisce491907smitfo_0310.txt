112 SMITHSONIAN MISCELLANEOUS COLLECTIONS 

C". frontalis ^lilne Edwards (Mel. Carcin., p. 170) must be closely 
 allied to, if not identical with, this species, but appears to have two 
 more complete rows of spines on the upper side of the penult joint 
 of the walking-feet. 

This species was found in the paddy-fields at Loo Choo. The 
 fields lie mostly under water, and the animal probably burrows in 
 their banks.

We have but one specimen of this species, a small male, half an 
 inch in length. It differs somewdiat from the large female described 
 by Milne Edwards, in that the carapax is punctated and, toward the 
 lateral margins, somewhat granulated. The second and third antero- 
 lateral teeth are bifid. Dactyli scarcely quadrangular, almost 
 rounded; also smaller and less spinulose. 

It was found at Omotepec Island, in Lake Nicaragua, by Mr. 
 Charles Wright, botanist of the expedition. 

THELPHUSID.^ 
 Genus GEOTHELPHUSA Stimpson 

This name is proposed for that group of Thclplutscc which is char- 
 acterized by the obsolescence of the postfrontal crest and the epi- 
 branchial teeth of the antero-lateral margins. In the shape of the 
 carapax they have some resemblance to the Gecarcinid^e, and they 
 approximate to that family also in their habits, frequenting the dry 
 land much more constantly than the typical Tliclphnscr.
