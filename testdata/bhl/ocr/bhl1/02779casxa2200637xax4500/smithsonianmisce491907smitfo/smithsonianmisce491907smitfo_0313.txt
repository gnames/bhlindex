CRUSTACEA NORTH PACIFIC EXPI,ORI\G EXPEDITION II 5 

The color in life is bluish-gray above, clouded with blackish 
 punctcT. Sometimes entirely black. Outer and under sides of 
 hands reticulated with purplish. Below white. 

It inhabits the shores of protected harbors, among stones. A 
 lighter-colored variety lives in sandy coves, along the edges of salt 
 marshes. It also frequents the vicinity of the mouths of small 
 streams. 

Found by us at Loo Choo, at the Bonin Islands, the Hawaiian 
 Islands, and at Tahiti. The species appears to be found at all the 
 tropical Pacific islands, both north and south of the equator.

Plate XVI, Fig. 2 

Mctopograpsiis qiiadridi'iitatiis Stimpson, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., x, 
 p. 102 [48], 1858. 

Carapax quadrangular ; proportion of length to breadth, i : i .22. 
 It is considerably narrowed behind, rather smooth, glossy, very 
 moderately striated anteriorly and at the sides ; the posterior half 
 perfectly smooth about the middle. Pregastric lobules little promi- 
 nent. Frontal region smooth, concave or transversely shallow, 
 channel-shaped. Front broad ; margin undulated and sharply cren- 
 ulated. Lateral margin with one very sharp tooth behind the orbital 
 angle. Inner margin of meros-joint of the chelipeds with three 
 or four small tuberculiform teeth near the base and four acute teeth 
 at the anterior angle, the outer tooth very prominent, compressed, 
 with convex outer margin. Carpus with somewhat scabrous or 
 squamous upper surface, and a short, vertical 2- or 3-toothed crest 
 at the inner angle. Hand obsoletely squamous or tuberculous 
 above, below, and within; outer surface smooth. Ambulatory feet 
 sparsely hairy toward extremities ; terminal spines or teeth of 
 meros, above and below, strong and sharp. Dimensions of the 
 male: Length of carapax, 0.74; breadth, 0.9; breadth of front, 0.54; 
 length of ambulatory foot of the second pair, 1.4 inches. 

The only other quadridentate Metopograpsiis known is M. ocean- 
 iciis Milne Edwards (Grapsits occaniciis Plombr. and Jacq., Voy. au 
 Pole Sud, Crust., pi. vi, fig. 9), from which the species above de- 
 scribed differs widely in its smoother carapax and hands. 

It was found at Cum-sing-moon, near Macao, China, running 
 about between tide marks.
