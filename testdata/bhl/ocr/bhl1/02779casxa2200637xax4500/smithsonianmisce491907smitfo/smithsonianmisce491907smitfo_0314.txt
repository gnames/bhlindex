Our specimens of this species were taken at Aladeira. They 
 agree exactly with those of Dana, who gives, with a doubt, Rio 
 Janeiro as the locality of his specimens. But they were probably 
 also from Madeira, as the U. S. Exploring Expedition stopped at 
 that island several days before proceeding to Rio.
