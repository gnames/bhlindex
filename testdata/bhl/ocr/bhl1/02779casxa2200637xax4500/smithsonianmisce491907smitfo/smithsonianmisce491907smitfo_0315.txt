CRUSTACEA NORTH PACIFIC EXPLORING EXPEDITION II7 

They were found in clefts of the surf-washed rocks above low- 
 water mark at Funchal, Madeira. The remark with regard to the 
 reputed locality of the last species applies equally well to this.

 [48], 1858. 

This species has much resemblance to P. innotatns and P. rugu- 
 losns of the Atlantic shores, but the carapax is somewhat narrower 
 and smoother, the carpus nearly smooth, and the raised line on the 
 outer surface of the hand, parallel to its lower margin, is obsolete or 
 nearly so. The hiatus between the suborbital lobe and the front is 
 much wider and the basal joint of the antennas broader. The 
 ground color of the carapax is bluish-white, but this tint is almost 
 concealed by crowded transverse black lines and blotches. Feet 
 brownish. Beneath nearly white. Dimensions of the carapax in 
 a male: Length, 0.54; breadth, 0.65 inch. Proportion, i: 1.204. 

It was found among stones at half-tide in Sydney Harbor (Port 
 Jackson), Australia.

A single specimen, a female, was found at Loo Choo. In this the 
 transverse plications are much more strongly marked than in speci- 
 mens from the Hawaiian Islands, particularly those on the superior 
 surface of the meros- joint of the posterior pair of feet.
