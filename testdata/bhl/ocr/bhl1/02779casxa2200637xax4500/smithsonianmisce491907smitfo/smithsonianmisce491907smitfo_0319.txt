This species is closely allied to G. strigosus, the carapax showing 
 nearly the same characters in every respect, except in being some- 
 what narrower anteriorly and a little more depressed across the 
 median region. In the proportions of the ambulatory feet, however, 
 considerable difference is perceptible, as they are much more slender 
 than in G. strigosus, and more than twice the breadth of the carapax 
 in length. The dactyii are more spinulose than in G. loiigitarsis 
 Dana, the front more expanded, the gastric region less tuberculous, 
 and the teeth or spines at the inferior extremity of the meros of the 
 walking feet longer. The dimensions of a male specimen are as 
 follows: Length of carapax, 1.22; breadth, 1.34 inches. 

It was found at Kikaisima and at Hongkong.

Allied to G. strigosus in the characters of the epistome, etc. Cara- 
 pax subquadrate ; length to breadth, as 1:1.13. It is broader in 
 front than in G. strigosus^ and the sides are less arcuated. The 
 transverse striae of the branchial regions are strongly marked, and 
 extend across nearly the whole width of the carapax, leaving only 
 the narrow depressed postcardiac region smooth, and even this por- 
 tion of the surface is obsoletely squamous. Pregastric region 
 strongly tuberculated, tubercles very numerous and subcristiform. 
 Frontal region short and considerably tuberculated. Frontal margin 
 crenulated. Inner tooth of carpus spiniform, very long, slender, and 
 sharp. Ambulatory feet in length equaling just twice the width of 
 the carapax ; spines at inferior extremity of meros rather strong ; 
 dactyii longer than in G. strigosus. Dimensions of carapax in the 
 male: Length, i.ii ; breadth, 1.26 inches. 

It is allied to G. loiigitarsis in the character of the front and 
 dactyii, but the branchial stris are much more produced inward. 

It was found under stones below half-tide mark on the ocean 
 shore at Hilo. Island of Hawaii. *
