CRUSTACEA NORTH PACIFIC EXPLORING EXPEDITION I23 

Plagusia orientalis Stimpson, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., x, p. 103 [49], 
 1858. 

In this species the superior lobe of the ischium iu the secoud and 
 third pairs of walking feet is prominent and dentiform, but never 
 denticulated â€” at least not in any of the specimens which we have 
 seen. 

The name /'. tiibcrciilata was applied by Lamarck by mistake to a 
 specimen in which the pubescence had been rubbed off the carapax. 
 This specimen may have belonged to this species, but in the uncer- 
 tainty we have thought best to apply a new name. 

The species was found by us at the Hawaiian Islands and on the 
 outer shores of Hongkong.

This species in life is elegantly variegated with crimson and yel- 
 lowish. Specimens from Hongkong and Loo Choo are much 
 smoother than others. Besides these localities, it was found by Mr. 
 Squires, of the "Hancock," abundantly in Caspar Strait, some- 
 times "attached to floating wood," and by Lieut. Van Wycke, of the 
 "Porpoise," at Tomboro, or New Ireland.
