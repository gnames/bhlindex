diverge obliquely forward. Feet lineated with darker red. Below 
 everywhere bluish-white. 

It was found in the Pacific at Port Lloyd, Bonin Islands, and at 
 Hawaii ; in the Atlantic at Madeira. We cannot distinguish the Ma- 
 deira specimens from those found in the Pacific by any constant 
 character, though it is not improbable that such will be found when a 
 sufficiently large series of examples from both regions shall be ex- 
 amined. 

These crabs are found under stones on ocean shores, and are very 
 active, sliding out of sight very quickly when exposed in their haunts.

x\mong a large number of specimens collected by the expedition 
 there are none with spines upon the anterior margin of the meros- 
 joint in the chelipeds. Perhaps this is a character only found in old 
 males, as there are no males in our collection much exceeding an inch 
 in length, although we have many large females. 

The coloration is very uniform in this species â€” yellowish-brown 
 above and light yellow below ; the feet paler. 

It was taken very abundantly during summer about the mouth of 
 the Canton River, in brackish water, and sometimes as far up as the 
 city of Canton. It was usually found swimming at the surface, but 
 sometimes on the muddy banks above low-water mark. 

Specimens were also found among floating wood in Caspar Strait 
 by Captain Rodgers, then in the steamer "Hancock."
