207. ERIOCHIRUS RECTUS' Stimpson 

Eriochirus rectus Stimpson, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., x, p. 103 [49], 
 1858. 

Carapax depressed, broad posteriorly, narrowing anteriorly; 
 length to greatest breadth as i : 1.06. Surface somewhat uneven, as 
 in B. japoiiicus, but smooth and punctate. Pregastric lobules little 
 salient. Front wav^d, indistinctly four-lobed ; median sinus very 
 shallow. Lateral margins nearly straight, converging; four teeth on 
 each side, the posterior one rudimentary. Outer maxillipeds and 
 pterygostomian regions pubescent. Chelipeds of moderate size ; 
 meros with granulated edges, the tooth near its summit very small ; 
 carpus with the encircling ridge of upper surface pubescent, and the 
 tooth at the inner angle small ; hand with a thick tuft of hair on 
 outer surface ; fingers strongly sulcated. The first three ambulatory 
 feet are slender toward their extremities. The meros-joint of the 
 ambulatory feet is ciliated above. The dactyli are shorter than in 
 E. japoiiicus and less curved. Dimensions of the unique female 
 specimen described : Length of carapax, 0.92 ; breadth, 0.975 ; length 
 of third ambulatory foot, 2 inches. 

It is allied to B. japoiiicus, but is more depressed, and easily dis- 
 tinguished by its straight converging sides and less distinctly lobed 
 front. 

Taken near Macao, China. 

Genus HETEROGRAPSUS (Lucas) Milne Edwards 

This genus was first proposed by Lucas in 1849, t)^^t has only re- 
 cently been illustrated and placed on a firm basis by Milne Edwards, 
 in his "Melanges Carcinologiques." The genus Hcmigrapsus of 
 Dana is composed in part of Hcterograpsi, but his Hcmigrapsus 
 crassimanus and H. aifiuis seem to us to belong more properly to Cyr- 
 tograpsus of the same author, a ver}^ distinct and well-marked genus 
 (notwithstanding it is disregarded by Milne Edwards), forming a 
 passage to the Varunace?e. Psciidograpsus niidiis and P. orcgoncn- 
 sis of Dana will fall into this genus. In these crabs the meros of the 
 outer maxillipeds is not auriculated, as in Psciidograpsus proper.
