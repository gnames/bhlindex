 Heterograpsus penicillatus Stimpson, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., x, p. 
 104 [50], 1858. 

Distinguished from H. crenulatus and allied species by the lanosity 
 of the hands; from H. oregonensis in its nearly straight and dilated 
 front. 

This species lives at and above low-water mark on sandy or muddy 
 shores. It was found in great abundance in a muddy estuary at 
 Simoda, Japan ; also under stones on coarse sand in a bay on the coast 
 of China, opposite Hongkong. 

209. HETEROGRAPSUS OREGONENSIS ' (Dana) Stimpson 

Pscndograpsus oregonensis Dana, U. S. Expl. Exped., Crust., i, 334, pi. 
 XX, fig. 6. Stimpson, Crust. Pacific Coast N. Am., p. 28. 

In this species the external side of the meros- joint of the outer 
 maxillipeds is scarcely at all dilated, but other characters indicate a 
 true affinity with Heterograpsus. 

Found on sandy or muddy shores in sheltered bays, above low- 
 water mark. Taken by us at San Francisco. 

210. HETEROGRAPSUS SANGUINEUS^ (De Haan) Milne Edwards 

Grapsus sanguineus De Haan, Fauna Japonica, Crust., p. 58, pi. xvi, fig. 3. 
 Heterograpsus sanguineus Milne Edwards, Melanges Carcinologiques, 
 p. 159- 

Closely allied to H. scxdcntatiis and H. uudns, but differs from 
 both in the smoothness of the infraorbital crest, which is only micro- 
 scopically crenulated. It has no hairs or lanose spots on the hands. 

A single specimen from China differs from North Japanese exam- 
 ples in its somewhat hairy feet, etc., and perhaps belongs to a dis- 
 tinct species. The coloration of this specimen is as follows : Above, 
 dark porphyry purple, minutely mottled. A few small white spots 
 on the feet. Below white, except the feet, which are pale purplish 
 toward their extremities. 

It was found among stones at low-water mark on the shores of a 
 bay near Hongkong.
