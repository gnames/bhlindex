Genus PLATYGRAPSUS^ Stimpson 

This name was proposed in tlie Proceedings of the Academy of 
 Natural Sciences of Philadelphia for the genus called Platynotns by 
 De Haan. this latter name having several times been previousl}- used. 
 and more than once for articulates. 

213. PLATYGRAPSUS DEPRESSUS ' (De Haan) Stimpson 

Platynotus depressus De Haan, Fauna Japonica, Crust., 63, pi. viii, hg. 2. 
 Milne Edwards, Mel. Carcin., p. 165. 

Easily recognized by its flat, glossy carapax, which is of a brown- 
 ish color, often variegated with yellowish white, purple, red. or 
 black. The greatest breadth is at the second lateral tooth. 

De Haan's figure of this species is poor, contrary to the usual accu- 
 racy seen in his work, and his description is defective in some points. 
 The dactyli of the posterior pair of feet are not trigonal, but de- 
 pressed and sulcated. The inner angle of the carpus is rounded only 
 in very old specimens ; in those of moderate size and in the young 
 this angle forms a sharp tooth or short spine. Finally the species is 
 not found "in fluviis montanis," but is a true marine form, living on 
 gravelly shores above low-water mark. 

It is the most common crab found on the shores of Japan, its geo- 
 graphical limits extending from 42° north latitude to the coast of 
 China, in latitude 23° X. We took it at Hongkong, at Loo Choo, 
 Ousima, and Kikaisima, at the Bonin Islands, Kagosima Bay, 
 Simoda, the northeast coast of Xiphon, and in Hakodadi Bay. 

It seems to reach a larger size progressively as we go north, the 
 largest being from Hakodadi, in one of which the carapax measures 
 1.02 inches in length and 1.23 inches in breadth. The Loo Choo 
 specimens are remarkable in being of a deep purplish-red color, with 
 feet tipped with orange, fingers tipped with white. 

214. PLATYGRAPSUS CONVEXIUSCULUS' Stimpson

Platygrafsus convcxiusculus Stimpson, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., x, 
 p. 104 [50], 1858. 

This species will be best described by a comparison with P. depres- 
 sus, to which it is very closely allied. The carapax is broader and
