less depressed, the posterior portion being a little convex trans- 
 versely. The surface is somewhat uneven, but smooth and glabrous. 
 The gastric lobes are more prominent. Front broader, more in- 
 clined, and less projecting, with the median sinus broader and deeper. 
 The second lateral tooth is sharp, more projecting, and more widely 
 separated from the first or orbital angle. The infraorbital margin is 
 more coarsely crenated. In other respects it is like P. dcprcssus. 
 Dimensions of a male: Length of carapax, 0.42; breadth. 0.51 inch. 
 Proportion, i : 1.21. 
 Found at Loo Choo. 

Genus PTYCHOGNATHUS Stimpson 

Carapax flat above ; antero-lateral margins acute, emarginated. 
 Buccal area and maxillipeds very broad, but narrowed posteriorly. 
 Exognath of outer maxillipeds greatly developed, as broad as the 
 ischium of the endognath. No piliferous crest on the endognath ; 
 commissure of ischium and meros transverse ; meros not as long, 
 but twice as broad as the ischium, and very strongly auriculated at 
 the antero-external angle, the auricle being nearly as large as the 
 main body of the joint. Feet as in Pseudograpsus, etc. ; hand not 
 piliferous. Last joint of the sternum considerably exposed on 
 either side of the abdomen. Abdomen of the male rather narrow. 
 Terminal joint of female abdomen free. 

This genus is founded on a single species from the eastern seas, 
 which is remarkable for the flatness of its dorsal surface. It is 
 allied to Pseudograpsus and to Platygrapsus, but sufficiently dis- 
 tinct from both in the character of its outer maxillipeds, from the 
 former b}- the great breadth of these members, and from the latter 
 by the transverse commissure of the endognath.

Carapax perfectly flat above, not at all deflexed anteriorly, and 
 very little sloped at the postero-lateral margins. Proportion of 
 length to breadth, i : 1.2 1. The H-shaped suture at the middle is 
 deeply impressed. Gastric lobules obsolete. Surface smooth, punc-
