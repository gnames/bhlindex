angle of the orbit. The external suborbital lobe is obsolete. Infra- 
 orbital crest inconspicuously crenulated. In the outer maxillipeds 
 the exognath is always smooth ; the endognath sometimes pubescent. 
 Chelipeds large, smooth ; meros with ciliated margins ; carpus obtuse 
 within ; hand broad, little convex, smooth within ; fingers somewhat 
 gaping, denticulated within. Ambulatory feet sparsely hairy, to- 
 mentose toward their extremities ; dactyli robust, sulcated. Color 
 dark yellowish brown, often covered with a blackish incrustation. 
 Dimensions of a male: Length of carapax, 0.56; breadth, 0.68 inch. 
 This species lives in holes in gravelly mud, along the shores of 
 ponds of brackish water, at the mouths of streams. Found in Port 
 Lloyd, Bonin Island. 

Genus ACM.^OPLEURA Stimpson 

In the characters of the orbits, antennae, abdomen, etc., this genus 
 agrees with Cyclograpsus â€” at least with that section of it in which 
 the orbits are nearly complete below. The lateral margins of the 
 carapax are entire. The outer maxillipeds, however, nearly re- 
 semble those of Heterograpsus, being destitute of an oblique pilifer- 
 ous crest ; their sides are straight ; the meros-joint is square, equal- 
 ing the ischium in length, and marked on its surface with a some- 
 what oblique sulcus which is not continued on to the ischium ; the 
 palpus is prosarthroid, and finally the exognath is narrow. The 
 hands are lanose at or between the bases of the fingers. 

This genus, being founded upon a single small specimen, needs 
 further illustration. The characters above mentioned forbid its 
 being included in any genus previously described.
