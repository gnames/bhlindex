132 SMITHSONIAN MISCELLANEOUS COLLECTIONS 

218. CYCLOGRAPSUS PUNCTATUS Milne Edwards 

Cyclograpsus punctatus Milne Edwards, Hist. Nat. des Crust., 11, 78; 

Mel. Carcin., p. 163. 
 Gnathochasmus barbatus McLeay, in Smith's Illust. Zool. S. Africa, Crust., 

pi. III. 

Living specimens are of a purplish-brown color, with black 
 punctse. 

It lives among- rocks and stones on sandy shores, in the third sub- 
 region of the littoral zone. Found at Simon's Bay, Cape of Good 
 Hope ; also in the harbor of Hongkong, China. 

219. CYCLOGRAPSUS AUDOUINI Milne Edwards 

Cyclograpsus aiidouini Milne Edwards, Hist. Nat. des Crust., 11, 78; Mel. 
 .Carcin., p. 163. 

Our specimens belong in all probability to the species here quoted, 
 but the distinctions of species in this genus are so slight that it may 
 well be different. The dactyli of the walking feet are much thicker 
 than in the specimens referred to C. audouini by Dana. 

The color in life was red, much darker on the anterior part of the 
 carapax ; in some specimens there were minute white markings. 
 Hands paler; feet rather dark above. Below, body and members 
 white. The dimensions of the largest specimen, a male, are : Length 
 of carapax, 0.88; breadth, 1.09 inches. 

It is common under stones above half-tide mark in Port Jackson 
 or Sydney Harbor, Australia. 

Genus CHASMAGNATHUS De Haan 

The genus Chasmagnathus is very closely allied to Helice, and we 
 can see no sufficient reason for placing these genera in separate 
 families, as is done by Milne Edwards in his "Melanges Carcin- 
 ologiques." The arcuated sides of Chasmagnathus is almost the 
 only character in which it resembles the Cyclograpsacese. The 
 jugal regions are as distinctly reticulated as in Sesarma; the front, 
 orbits, antennas, etc., are as in Helice, and the outer maxillipeds only 
 differ from those of the latter genus in being more elongated. 

The species described by Dana are intermediate between Chas- 
 magnathus and Helice, and some of them seem to belong properly 
 to the latter genus.
