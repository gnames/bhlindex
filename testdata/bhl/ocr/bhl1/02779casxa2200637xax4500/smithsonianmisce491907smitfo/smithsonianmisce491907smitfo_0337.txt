Carapax depressed, quadrate, much broader than long; proportion 
 of length to breadth, i : 1.19. Surface very uneven, anteriorly trans- 
 versely rugulose. Anterior gastric lobules well marked ; those of 
 the middle pair with oval spaces at the summits, as if eroded. Frontal 
 region somewhat minutely tuberculated ; frontal margin waved. Lat- 
 eral margins straight, entire, but sometimes with obscure indications 
 of two or three teeth, best seen in a side view. Epistome partly 
 granulated. Chelipeds (of female) of moderate size; inner edge of 
 meros crenulated as far as the triangular tooth at the apex, anterior 
 edge nearly smooth ; surface of carpus with short granulated rugae. 
 Hand on the outer surface smooth toward the extremities, but granu- 
 lated above and posteriorly ; granules small, those of the superior 
 surface arranged in three or four oblique but nearly longitudinal 
 rows, not parallel ; a small, sharp, denticulated tooth on the upper 
 edge of the hand at the base of the dactylus ; inner surface granu- 
 lated, granules scattered ; dactylus ornamented above with two or 
 three longitudinal rows of very small tubercles. Ambulatory feet 
 rather long; meros only moderately dilated; last two joints moder- 
 ately provided with short, stiff hairs. 

In life carapax black, with a few small bluish-white blotches ; feet 
 pale grayish, mottled. Below bluish-grey. Fingers and lower sur- 
 face of the hand pale reddish-white. Dimensions of the female : 
 Length of carapax, 0.78 ; breadth, 0.92 inch. 

It is closely allied to S. affiiiis, but differs from this as well as from 
 S. quadrata in its less dilated meros-joints, from S. picta in its less 
 oblique and non-pectinated crests of the hand and non-plicated fin- 
 ger. There is also no tuberculated ridge on the inner surface of the 
 hand. 

This species dift'ers in its habits from most of the genus Scsanna. 
 It lives among rocks at about half-tide, on shores more or less ex- 
 posed to the surf. Found in Fou-kow Bay, in the island of Ousima.
