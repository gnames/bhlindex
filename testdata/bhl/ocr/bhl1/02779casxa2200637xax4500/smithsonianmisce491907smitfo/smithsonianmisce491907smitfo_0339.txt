The post-frontal ridge, although straight, is always separated into 
 four divisions by slight emarginations, indicating the normal proto- 
 gastric lobules. 

Found on the shores of a muddy estuary at Simoda; also at Ou-

Genus CAMPTANDRIUM Stimpson 

Carapax subhexagonal, facial region in breadth equalling two- 
 thirds that of the carapax, front scarcely exceeding in extent a fourth 
 part of the width of the carapax ; its margin strongly waved in the 
 perpendicular plane, but nearly straight when seen from above. 
 Antero-lateral margin oblique, straight or slightly concave, armed 
 with three small somewhat distant teeth, the third or lateral tooth 
 prominent, and projecting directly outward. Postero-lateral margin 
 convex. Posterior margin about equal in length to the anterior 
 margin or width of facial region. Upper surface unequal, with 
 three or four interrupted transverse ridges, which are very promi- 
 nent and somewhat pubescent in the male, but much less distinct in 
 the female ; gastric region small ; the anterior median lobules suffi- 
 ciently prominent ; hepatic regions large ; genital and cardiac regions 
 very broad. Eyes of moderate length ; orbits transverse, with large 
 infero-exterior sinus ; internal suborbital lobe small, dentiform, not 
 joining the front; inferior margin of orbit and infraorbital crest ap- 
 proximated, and not produced exteriorly beyond the outer angle of 
 the orbit. Antennulas oblique, in deep fossettes. Antennae short; 
 the basal joint small, rounded; third joint lying in the internal hiatus 
 of the orbit. Epistome of moderate extent. Latero-inferior regions 
 smooth. Anterior margin of buccal area deeply waved in the verti- 
 cal plane; median septum strongly prominent. Palate abbreviated, 
 smooth. External maxillipeds rather short and broad, smooth, 
 squarish, not gaping ; exognath palpigerous, but not bearing a tooth
