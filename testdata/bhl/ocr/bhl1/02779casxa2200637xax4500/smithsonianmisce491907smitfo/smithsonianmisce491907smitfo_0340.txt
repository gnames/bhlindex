on its inner margin, slender and half concealed beneath the en- 
 dognath, the portion next the ischinm only being exposed to view : 
 endognath broad, ischium quadrate ; meros-joint equaling the 
 ischium in length and much broader than long, broadly auriculated 
 at the external angle, the auricle protruding forward and not side- 
 ways ; palp prosarthroid, inserted at the bottom of the sinus in the 
 anterior side of the meros. Chelipeds rather small and weak, un- 
 armed ; those of the female with fingers resembling those of the 
 female Gelasimns. Ambulatory feet slender, unarmed, smooth, 
 pubescent near the base; meros-joint with a ridge on the posterior 
 surface parallel \vith the superior margin ; dactyli slender, obliquely 
 compressed, shortly ciliated. Sternum broad ; its posterior joint 
 widely exposed on either side of the abdomen, its arcuated anterior 
 margin next the mouth projecting, laminiform, like a septum, for the 
 better separation of the mouth from the extremity of the abdomen. 
 Abdomen of the male somewhat tapering, but not dilated at the 
 base, strongly constricted or sinuated on each side at the middle : 
 terminal joint not narrower at the base than the penultimate joint. 
 The male abdominal appendages of the tirst pair are long, slender, 
 bent or geniculated beyond the middle, where there is a strong- 
 tubercle or i)apilla on the convex side, and contorted toward their 
 extremities ; those of the second pair slender, minute. Abdomen of 
 the female broad, covering the whole of the sternum with the excep- 
 tion of its postero-lateral corners; terminal joint broad and scarcely 
 free, the sides of the penult joint being a little expanded so as to 
 enclose its base in a shallow sinus. 

This genus inhabits the Chinese seas. 

In the form of the carapax approaches somewhat Cyrtoi^raf>si(s 
 Dana, but the characters of the male abdomen, length of eyes, etc.. 
 would remove it from the Grapsidcc.

The trivial characters of this species may be gathered mostl\' from 
 the generic description preceding. Reprehensible as the practice 
 which we now follow may be in general, it was thought advisable in 
 the present case, where the characters of the animal exclude it from 
 all known families, by which their generic or specific value might be 
 determined. We have therefore given under the head of the genus
