232. ASTHENOGNATHUS IN-ffiQUIPES Stimpson 

Plate XIV, Fig. i 

Asfhenognathus inceqiiipcs Stimpson, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., x, 
 p. 107 [53], 1858. 

The remarks under the head of Caniptaiidritiui scxdciitatum will 
 apply with equal justice to this species. 

The specimen is lead colored. Its dimensions are : Length of 
 carapax, 0.29; breadth, 0.375 i"ch. Proportion, i : 1.28. 

It was dredged from a sandy-mud bottom in thirty fathoms, ofif the 
 east coast of Niphon, in latitude 38° X. 

XENOPHTHALMID.^ 
 Genus XENOPHTHALMUS White 

This genus is very imperfectly described by White, like many 
 others instituted by him. We give below a few of its more im- 
 portant characters, by which it will be seen that it is not properly 
 included in the Pinnotheridae, but is the type of a new family. The 
 equality in size between the meros and ischium-joints of the outer 
 maxillipeds is a prominent distinctive feature, since the most im- 
 portant family character of the Pinnotheridse is the rudimentary 
 state of the ischium. Alilne Edwards, in including the genus in that 
 family ("Melanges Carcinologiques," p. 186), was probably guided 
 only by the figure and descriptions of White. 

The carapax is notched at the margin on each side, as if con- 
 stricted. Antennulae minute ; fossettes very shallow, or none. An- 
 tennse robust. Eyes minute, movable, placed longitudinally in deep 
 chinks, and apparently destitute of black pigment. We have failed 
 to observe the "cylindrical tooth" spoken of by White. As in 
 Hyniciiosonia, there is no distinct epistome. In the outer maxilli- 
 peds the ischium equals the meros in size ; the palpus is spirally 
 twisted; dactylus in form resembling that of Pi)uiofhercs. The 
 chelipeds are very small, even in the male. The anterior margin of 
 the sternum projects in the form of a thin laminiform crest, and is 
 separated from the adjacent parts — bases of the maxillipeds and 
 feet, etc. — by a very deep chink or fissure. The verges are sternal. 
 The male abdomen is oblong, not dilated at the base, but of nearly 
 the same breadth throughout ; a slight contraction at the fifth joint ; 
 extremity obtuse, reaching quite to the anterior margin of the 
 sternum.
