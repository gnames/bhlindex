not protruded. Outer maxillipeds pilose, hairs plumose ; palpus 
 short; penult joint with extremity almost pointed; dactylus minute, 
 joined at about the middle of the penult joint. Ambulatory feet of 
 the third pair longest ; dactyli of the first and second pairs short, 
 equal ; those of the third pair very long and tapering to a fine point ; 
 those of the last pair also long. Dimensions of the carapax : Length, 
 0.168; breadth, 0.21 1 inch.

236. PINNOTHERES PARVULUS Stimpson 

Pinnotheres parz'uliis Stimpson, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., x, p. 108 
 [54]. 1858. 

Description of the female: Carapax narrower than in P. pisiiiii; 
 front nearly the same as in the female of that species. Outer max- 
 illipeds rather hairy ; exognath, excluding its palp, a little less than 
 half as long as the meros-joint of the endognath ; penult joint of en- 
 clognath twice as long as carpus ; dactylus slender, reaching to the 
 extremity of the penult joint. Ambulatory feet toward extremities 
 hairy ; those of the last two pairs longer than the first two, and with 
 proportionally longer dactyli. Length of the carapax, 0.14 inch. 

A specimen of this species was found in each and every example 
 of the small bivalve Mcroc quadrata, of which several were dredged 
 from a sand}' bottom in twenty-six fathoms, in the China Sea, at 
 about latitude 23Â° N. 

Genus PINNIXA White 

The best known species of this very distinct genus are natives of 
 the American coast, but they will undoubtedly be found to be numer- 
 ous at the proper latitudes in all parts of the globe, when sought for 
 in their peculiar lurking places. The}^ are parasitic in their habits, 
 like the Pinnotheres, which they so much resemble in the structure 
 of their jaw-feet; but in place of living with the bivalve mollusk in 
 his shell, they prefer the society of marine worms and worm-like 
 Holothuridje, in the tubes or holes of which they are generally found. 
 In their transversely elongated shape they are well adapted for 
 slipping about in such cavities. One South Carolinian species 
 lives in the tubes of Chcctopterus, another in the hole of the large 
 Arenicola, and the larger of the expedition species was found in the 
 hole of a Caudina. 

The Pinnoihera faba of Dana is intermediate in its characters 
 between Pinnotheres and Pinnixa, but has the maxillipeds of the
