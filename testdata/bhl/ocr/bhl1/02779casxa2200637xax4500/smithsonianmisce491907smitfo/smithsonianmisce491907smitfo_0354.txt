young, with a sharp tooth at each extremity. Front sufficiently 
 projecting, tridentate, the median tooth a httle more prominent than 
 the lateral ones. Thoracic sinus very deep, pubescent, with no 
 tubercles, its antero-exterior notch reaching the margin of the cara- 
 pax, its inner notch deep and narrow, reaching nearer to the base 
 of the exognath of the outer maxillipeds than in most other species. 
 The meros- joint of the chelipeds is somewhat contracted and pubes- 
 cent about the base, and ornamented along the margins with tubercles 
 rather sparsely distributed. There are no tubercles on its upper 
 surface excepting five close to the base, almost concealed by the 
 pubescence, of which two are large ; beneath there are a few tuber- 
 cles scattered near the base. The hand is large. Ambulatory feet 
 with somewhat dilated joints. Tubercle of the penult joint of the 
 abdomen minute. The male abdomen resembles that of L. rhom- 
 boidalis, but is more slender and tapering. The male abdominal ap- 
 pendages show two or three turns in their spiral. 

Colors in life : The carapax is bluish-white, with a median dorsal 
 band of reddish becoming broader posteriorly, and two oblique 
 bands of red on each side diverging from the front, and also widen- 
 ing posteriorly. Feet clouded transversely with reddish, almost an- 
 nulated. Beneath the body is white, and the feet paler than above. 
 Dimensions of the carapax in a male : Length, 0.97 : breadth, 0.85 
 inch. 

This species differs from L. craniolaris in the pubescence at the 
 base of the arms ; from L. rhoinboidalis, to which it is still more 
 closely allied, in its distinctly tridentate front. 

It was taken with the trawl from muddy bottoms, in four or five 
 fathoms, in the bays on the Chinese coast, near Hongkong.

This species is much smaller than any other of the group of Lcu- 
 cosiar to which it belongs. The carapax is rhomboidal, smooth and 
 glossy, longer than broad, in the proportion of i : 1.16. The front 
 is tridentate, with tips a little deflexed ; the median tooth is much the 
 largest and most prominent, the lateral ones being scarcely promi- 
 nent enough to be considered teeth. Thoracic sinus very deep,
