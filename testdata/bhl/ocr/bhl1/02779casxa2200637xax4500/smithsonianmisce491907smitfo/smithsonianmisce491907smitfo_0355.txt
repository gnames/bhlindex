pubescent, not tuberculated, with no notch at the antero-interior 
 angle, which is broadly rounded. Posterior margin convex, not 
 projecting, lightly granulated; angles obtuse. Meros-joint of the 
 chelipeds as in L. vittata, with the base pubescent; the marginal 
 tubercles are, however, more crowded. In the abdomen of the male 
 the antepenult joint is contracted toward its extremity, and there is 
 a constriction at the commissure of this joint with the penult. The 
 tubercle of the penult joint is sufficiently large, and the surface in 
 front of it excavated. The male abdominal appendages are spiral, 
 with two turns. 

The life colors are as follows : Carapax bluish-brown, becoming 
 paler posteriorly, and spotted with red, there being five small spots 
 on each side of the median line, placed in arcuated series, which 
 diverge anteriorly. Chelipeds bluish-brown ; walking feet white, 
 barred with red. Dimensions of the carapax in a male : Length, 
 0.58; breadth, 0.5 inch. 

This species also is allied to L. rhomboidalis, but differs in the 
 form of the abdomen. 

It was dredged in considerable numbers on a shelly-mud bottom, 
 in twenty fathoms, off the coast of China, near Hongkong.

Carapax longer tlian broad, in the proportion of 1:1.15; very 
 convex posteriorly ; sides rounded ; surface near the antero-lateral 
 margins concave. Apex (or anterior extremity) compressed and 
 much directed upward. Front projecting beyond the orbits, triden- 
 tate, the median tooth most prominent. Antero-lateral margin mod- 
 erately crenulated, not extending further back than the first pair of 
 ambulatory feet. Postero-lateral or inferior margin inconspicuously 
 crenulated. Posterior margin obtuse, minutely crenulated above, 
 smooth and glossy beneath. Thoracic sinus shallow, anteriorly 
 abbreviated, but with deep notches at the corners, and ornamented 
 with three large and two or three small tubercles above the base of 
 the arm. The meros-joint of the chelipeds is tuberculated above on 
 the basal half, as in L. pallida, the tubercles rather large; below, 
 about the anterior edge, it is crowdedly tuberculated. The hand is
