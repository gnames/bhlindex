small, with the external edge acute ; inner edge obtuse, slightly cren- 
 ulated above ; fingers short and weak, much gaping, and smooth 
 within. The dactvli of the ambulatory feet are slender, not dilated, 
 as in some species. 

Beneath the surface is milk white and polished, shining. The 
 sutures of the sternum are deeply impressed, and its postero-lateral 
 angles tuberculiform. The abdomen of the male is moderately 
 broad, the antepenult joint protuberant on either side of the median 
 line; penult joint with convex sides, and armed with a sharp tubercle 
 near the middle, pointing backward. The male abdominal appen- 
 dages exhibit a beautifully close sharp spiral of seven or eight turns. 

This species is of a pale buff color, clouded with darker gray on 
 the anterior part of the carapax, which is also variegated with three 
 white spots on each side of the median line, and two dark spots 
 posteriorly. Dimensions of the carapax in the male: Length, 0.84; 
 breadth, 0.73 inch. 

This species approaches nearest to L. pallida Bell, from which it 
 may be distinguished in its less strongly crenulated margins, in hav- 
 ing only three large tubercles in the thoracic sinus, and in its more 
 slender dactyli. 

Taken near Selio Island, in Caspar Strait, by Capt. John Rodgers, 
 of the steamer "Hancock."

In our specimen the front is more projecting than in the figure 
 above quoted, and subtriangular. The posterior margin is also con- 
 vex. In the living animal the anterior half of the carapax was 
 bluish-white, the posterior half dotted with red ; a band of crowded 
 red punctae across the middle, interrupted at the median dorsal line. 
 Below white, with a few scattered red dots. 

It was dredged from shelly-sand in twenty fathoms, in Kagosima
