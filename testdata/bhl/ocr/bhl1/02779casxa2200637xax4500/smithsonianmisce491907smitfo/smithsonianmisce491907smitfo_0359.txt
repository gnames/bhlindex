We have but one specimen, a female, of this species. The carapax 
 is suboctagonal, or rhomboidal, with the angles truncated, the lateral 
 ones obliquely. It is broader than long, in the proportion of i : 1.07. 
 Both the antero-lateral and the postero-lateral margins are slightly 
 concave. The carapax is very convex across the middle, and there 
 is a narrow median carina extending from the front to the sharply 
 prominent and granulated cardiac tubercle. The branchial regions 
 are prominent, irregularly granulated about their summits, the outer 
 granules large and sharp. Front concave, minutely granulated. 
 Posterior margin nearly straight, its surface granulated. Surface 
 of the carapax, except at the points mentioned above, smooth and 
 glabrous. There is a minute spine at the summit of the pterygos- 
 tomian angle. The surface of the outer maxillipeds is obsoletely 
 granulated. Chelipeds granulated, the marginal granules few, dis- 
 tant, and subspiniform ; the meros- joint more than twice as long as 
 broad. 

Dimensions of the carapax: Length, 0.28; breadth, 0.3 inch. 

Dredged from a coarse sandy bottom in twenty fathoms, in Fun- 
 chal Bay, Madeira.

This species is much like P. crassipcs Bell ( Lin. Trans., xxi, pi. 
 XXXIV, fig. 2) in its quadridentate front and tuberculated dorsum, 
 but the carapax is broader, the front less produced, and the surface
