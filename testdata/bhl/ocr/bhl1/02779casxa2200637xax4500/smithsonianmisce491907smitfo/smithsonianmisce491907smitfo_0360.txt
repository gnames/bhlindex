minutely granulated. In the female the tubercles of the carapax 
 are less prominent and more obtuse than in the male. The outer 
 maxillipeds, as well as the sternum, are microscopically granulated. 
 The chelipeds are shorter and more slender than in P. crassipcs : the 
 hand smooth ; the fingers short, sulcated, and minutely denticulated 
 within, but with no large tooth. The ambulatory feet are more 
 slender. In life the carapax was mottled with white and bluish- 
 grav ; the feet and chelipeds visually annulated or banded. The 
 dimensions of a female are: Length of carapax, 0.4; breadth, 0.38 
 inch.

Of this species two females were taken, to which the following 
 description will apply: Breadth to length as i : 1.05. The carapax, 
 leaving out the protruded front, is regularly and evenly globular — 
 the regions not being circumscribed — and thickly covered above with 
 small, sharp, scarcely granulated spines, ten of which, around the 
 margins, are a little longer than the others. A median spine on the 
 post-cardiac region is also somewhat larger than the others. Be- 
 tween the two large spines on the posterior margin there are two 
 small ones. Frontal region nearly smooth, posteriorly minutely 
 spinulose ; frontal margin regularly concave, arcuated, terminating 
 in a small tooth at each extremity. Chelipeds closely granulated, 
 granules mostly subspiniform, those of the hand much smaller than 
 those of the meros-joint. Fingers slender, as long as the palm. 
 Ambulatory feet smooth. 

Color in life pale brick red above, with a longitudinal wedge of 
 white margined with brown, the apex of which is at the middle of 
 the carapax, the base covering the front. Beneath white, tinted with 
 reddish. Dimensions of the carapax : Length, 0.46 ; breadth, spines 
 included, 0.44 inch. 

The carapax in one of the specimens is somewhat more depressed. 

It differs from A. crinaceus in wanting spines on the ambulatory 
 feet ; from A. ttiberculata and A. lez'iniaiia in having sharp instead of 
 tuberculiform spines.
