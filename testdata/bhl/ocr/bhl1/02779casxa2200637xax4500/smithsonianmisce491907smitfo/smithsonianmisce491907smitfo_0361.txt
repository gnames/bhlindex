The color in life is pale brick-red above, white below. In one of 
 our specimens the width between the tips of the lateral spines is 2.15 
 inches. In the young these spines are proportionally shorter. 

Several specimens were taken in the trawl on a muddy bottom in 
 twenty fathoms, off the coast of China, near Hongkong. 

Genus IPHICULUS Adams and White 

The affinities of the crustaceans upon which this genus was 
 founded have been hitherto a matter of conjecture only, owing to 
 the imperfect manner in which it was characterized by its original 
 describers, and their doubtful reference of it to two very distinct 
 groups of Brachyura, the Parthenopidse and the Leucosidea. They 
 place it, indeed, among their descriptions of Leucosidea, but say in 
 their note that "it appears, among the Parthenopidse, to hold the 
 same place as Orcophorus does among the Leucosidas." While, 
 curiously enough, the generic name which they have applied to it is 
 a diminutive of that of its nearest congener Iphis, and thus indicates 
 its true position.

 character of the hand, in which the long, slender fingers are armed 
 with needle-like spines along their inner margins. This kind of
