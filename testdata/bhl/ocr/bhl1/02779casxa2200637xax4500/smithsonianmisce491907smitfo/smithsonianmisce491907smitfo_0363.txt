It is covered with a villous coat of a dirty baft' color, paler below, 
 with a transverse band of purple-brown at the epistome. 

When captured it feigns death like a spider, contracting or fold- 
 ing up all its members closely against the body in a very compact 
 form, to which the shape of the sides of the body shows an adapta- 
 tion. 

It was dredged on muddy bottoms, sometimes on muddy gravel, in 
 from ten to twenty fathoms, in the bays and channels of the Chinese 
 coast, near Hongkong.

Carapax subpentagonal, and much broader than long, in the pro- 
 portion of 1 : 1.38. It is rugose, as if eroded or vermiculated, with 
 a series of oblong pits parallel to the antero-lateral margins, and a 
 longitudinal series on each side of and almost circumscribing the 
 cardiac region. Front narrow, prominent. Branchial regions much 
 projecting laterally, somewhat concave, and partly covered with 
 flattened or subcapitate tubercles, which extend to the posterior mar- 
 gin of the carapax, where they become confluent. Chelipeds rugose, 
 eroded, and irregularly protuberant ; fingers sulcated, of moderate 
 "breadth, concave on the upper or inner side, and with sharp curved 
 tips placed laterally ; immovable finger broader than the dactylus. 
 Ambulatory feet moderately tuberculated along their edges, the 
 tubercles small. Abdomen covered with small rounded tubercles, 
 not crowded, and marked with two interrupted impressed lines down 
 the middle, which circumscribe the median carina, which is. however, 
 less convex than the sides. 

This species is of an ashy-white hue, but much discolored by 
 sordes. The dimensions of the female specimen above described 
 are : Length of carapax, 0.48 ; breadth. 0.662 inch.
