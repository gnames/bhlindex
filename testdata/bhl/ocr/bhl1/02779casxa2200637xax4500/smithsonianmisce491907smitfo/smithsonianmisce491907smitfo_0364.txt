It is perhaps specifically the same as the example figured by 
 Adams and White in pi. vi, fig. 2, of the Crustacea of the \'oyage 
 of the Samarang, which is considered by the authors to be the young 
 of their 0. rcticulatus.

The middle portion of the carapax in our specimens is closely 
 granulated, and sometimes the ridges also. The hand is depressed, 
 and nearly smooth; the fingers sulcated. In life the color of the 
 carapax above is partly pale brick-red and partly yellowish-white ;, 
 the arms are reddish ; the hands pale bufif. 

It was dredged in considerable numbers from shelly bottoms in 
 six to ten fathoms, in the channel of Hongkong Harbor.

In the male specimen taken by us we notice the following charac- 
 ters. The posterior branchial angle and ridge are acutely promi- 
 nent, forming a sharp up-curved tooth at the margin, which is 
 almost as prominent as the lateral tooth anterior to it. The front is 
 broader than in Bell's figure, and the teeth more projecting. Eyes 
 protractile to a considerable length. Antennulse very long, nearly 
 half as long as the carapax ; their fossse very deep. The external 
 maxillipeds are not gaping, as in the female, according to Bell ; the 
 surface of the exognath is granulated ; ischium of endognath with 
 a longitudinal ridge along the middle ; meros excavated. Chelipeds 
 as in the female. Abdominal segments as in Nursia; penult joint 
 with a tooth near its extremity, pointing backward. The abdominal 
 appendages of the first pair are bifurcated at their extremities. 

Color in life white. Dimensions of the carapax : Length, 0.27 ; 
 breadth, 0.29 inch. 

The difiference in the outer maxillipeds is so great that were it 
 not for the exact correspondencf" of some other characters we should'
