eating with the antennulary fossettes. These fossettes are trans- 
 verse, ovate in shape, small and complete. The epistome is suffi- 
 cientlv large on either side of the apex of the maxillipeds which 
 divides it. Buccal area as broad as long. Pterygostomian channels 
 notched at the antero-exterior side. Exognath of the outer maxil- 
 lipeds small, much narrower than the endognath ; meros-joint of 
 endognath three-fourths as long as the ischium. Chelipeds robust. 
 not crested ; fingers nearly longitudinal. In the female abdomen the 
 segments from the third to the sixth are soldered, and the second 
 segment is produced into a point on either side. The sternum is 
 broad.

Plate XIV. Fig. 7 

Carcinasfis niargiiiatus Stimpson, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., x, p. iDi 
 [59], 1858. 

In the female specimen which we have before us the proportion of 
 length to breadth in the carapax is i : 1.12. The carapax is smooth 
 and glabrous above, slightly convex and punctate at the middle, 
 and margined with a double series of minute granules. Rostrum 
 produced, slightly elevated. Beneath the subhepatic regions the 
 margins of the outer maxillipeds and sternum are closely granu- 
 lated, the granules rather flattened. Chelipeds robust, angular, the 
 surfaces smooth, the upper surface margined on either side, like the 
 carapax, with a double series of granules, the inferior keel often 
 punctate or inconspicuously granulated. Fingers of the hand sul- 
 cated, half as long as the palm. Ambulatory feet rather broad; 
 meros unicarinate above; remaining joints to extremities bicarinate. 
 upper carina most prominent; dactyli as long as the penult joint and 
 with acute extremities. 

In life carapax red ; feet white. Dimensions of the carapax : 
 Length, 0.25 ; breadth, 0.28 inch. 

Found under stones at low-water mark, on rocky shores, at the 
 Cape of Good Hope. 

Cxenus CRYPTOCNEMUS Stimpson 

The carapax is broad and pentagonal in shape, or perliaps better 
 described as triangular, with the lateral angles truncated. It has 
 broad laminiform expansions posteriorly and at the sides, concealing 
 the ambulatory feet, with the exception of their extremities when 
 extended. The lateral expansions and the front are bent upward.
