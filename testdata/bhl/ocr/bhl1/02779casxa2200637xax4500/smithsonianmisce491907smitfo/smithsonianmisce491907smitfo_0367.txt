CRUSTACEA NORTH PACIFIC EXPLORING EXPEDITION 163 

SO that the upper surface is concave on either side of the dorsal 
 convexity, which is ahnost carinate along the middle. The front is 
 rostrate ; the rostrum broad and triangular, pointing obliquely up- 
 ward. Orbits minute, round, with entire margins. Antennulary 
 fossse oblique. External antenna nearly obsolete, or represented 
 only by one or two joints at the base. Epistome sufficiently large. 
 Buccal area as broad as long. Anterior margins of the ptervgos- 
 tomian channel entire. Exognath of the outer maxillipeds dilated, 
 as broad as the endognath, its outer margin broadly and regularly 
 arcuated. Meros-joint of the endognath two-thirds as long as the 
 ischium. Chelipeds with laminiform crests at the edges ; fingers of 
 the hand short. Dactyli of the ambulatory feet very narrow. Ster- 
 num broad. Abdomen of the male narrow-triangular, geniculated 
 near the base ( where, however, there is no joint) in a right angle, 
 its segments all confluent with the exception of the first and last. 

This little crab has much resemblance to a Cryptopodia. and in its 
 natural position the main body of the carapax anteriorly is directed 
 obliquely upward and forward at an angle of 45°.

Carapax much broader than long in the proportion of i : 1.45. 
 The length of the postero-lateral side is one-half that of the antero- 
 lateral. The surface is perfectly smooth and glabrous, and convex 
 anteriorly, with a slight longitudinal ridge or carina running from 
 the tip of the rostrum to the middle of the gastric region. The 
 small cardiac region is slightly prominent. The rostrum is ele- 
 vated to an angle of about 60° with the horizon ; tip almost acute ; 
 sides convex. The outer maxillipeds and all the lower surfaces of 
 the body are smooth and glossy. The chelipeds are flattened, with 
 glabrous surfaces ; the marginal laminae very much expanded, that 
 of the hand being wider than the slight thickening which constitutes 
 its body, and deeply notched on the outer side near the fingers. The 
 fingers are one-third as long as the palm ; immovable finger broad ; 
 dactylus sulcated. Ambulatory feet crested with laminae; dactyli 
 very slender. Color of preserved specimen white. Dimensions of 
 the carapax in the male : Length, 0.2 ; breadth, 0.29 inch. 

Dredged from shelly mud in twenty fathoms, in Kagosima Bay, 
 Japan.
