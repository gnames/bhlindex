Genus ONYCHOAIORPHA Stimpson 

Carapax flat, unguiform. longer than broad, posteriorly broadly 
 . expanded and laminiform, anteriorly narrowing. Front very short, 
 truncated, non-rostrate, and scarcely as prominent as the epistome. 
 Orbits verv minute, deeply notched or fissured at the middle above, 
 and with a small hiatus within. Antennulary fossse oblique. Epi- 
 stome verv small. External antennas obsolete. Buccal area longer 
 than broad. Anterior margins of pterygostomian channel entire. 
 Basal joint of outer maxillipeds very small; exognath much broader 
 than endognath, with arcuated outer margin : endognath very slen- 
 der, its apex projecting less far beyond that of the exognath than 
 in the other genera of this family; ischium- joint shorter than the 
 meros. Chelipeds much depressed, hand almost laminiform, fingers 
 very short, oblique, almost transverse. Sternum of moderate 
 breadth. Abdomen of the male subtriangular, broad and tumid 
 near the base, sides toward extremity a little concave, segments con- 
 fluent except at base and extremity. 

This genus is easily recognized by the great expansion posteriorly 
 Â» of the carapax and the non-rostrate front.

Carapax almost laminiform, somewhat lyre-shaped, broadest at 
 the posterior extremity, narrowing anteriorly, and deeply sinuated 
 or contracted at the level of the third pair of feet. Breadth to 
 length as i:i.i. Front very short; margin straight. Antero- 
 lateral and posterior margins somewhat curved, convex. Upper 
 surface glabrous, lightly convex about the middle, depressed and 
 faintly radiated toward the margins. Pregastric region depressed 
 below the level, of the front. Outer maxillipeds and lower surfaces 
 of the body smooth. Chelipeds smooth ; meros trigonal but de- 
 pressed, with sharp edges ; carpus small, with acute exterior edge ; 
 hand much dilated, lamelliform, pubescent at inner edges and lower 
 surface; fingers deeply sulcated, constituting one-fourth the length 
 of the hand. Ambulatory feet slender, with no laminiform expan- 
 sion ; dactyli slender as in Cryptocnemus pciitagonns. Abdomen of 
 the male with a sharp tooth at the extremity of the penult joint and
