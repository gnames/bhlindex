Of this small species a single male individual was obtained. It 
 presents characters which may, upon further examination, warrant 
 its separation from the typical Ethusa. The carapax is narrowed 
 forwards; proportion of breadth to length, i : 1.13. The surface is 
 uneven, but not granulated. Inter-ocular front quadridentate ; teeth 
 verv sharp, subequal, in two pairs separated by the median notch. 
 Extra-ocular teeth sharp and spiniform, about equal to the frontal 
 teeth in size, but not reaching to the level of their tips. Infra- 
 orbital spine obsolete. External maxillipeds naked, longitudinally 
 sulcated ; meros nearly as broad as ischium. Inner maxillipeds as 
 in Dorippc. The epignath of the outer maxillipeds plays in a large 
 afferent cavity at the base of the pterygostomian region, which is not, 
 however, separated, as in Dorippc, from the open space at the base 
 of the chelipeds. The feet are slender, rounded and roughened with 
 slight asperities. 

In life carapax pale yellowish-gray ; feet pale brownish ; fingers of 
 the hand white. Dimensions of the carapax : Length, 0.275 ; 
 breadth, 0.242 inch. 

It was dredged from a shelly bottom in twenty fathoms, in Kago- 
 sima Bay, Japan. 

Genus TYMOLUS Stimpson 

Body oblong. Carapax much shorter than the body, rounded, 
 abruptly contracted anteriorly, the facial region being narrow and 
 protruding. Hepatic and branchial regions ample, swollen. Aft'er- 
 ent branchial opening normal in position, at the anterior base of the 
 chelipeds. Front quadridentate. Between the median teeth of the 
 front a small tooth may be seen from above, which constitutes the 
 wall of the apex or anterior extremity of the buccal area and en- 
 closes the tips of the outer maxillipeds. Orbits deep, longitudinal ; 

^This species was first transferred to the genus Ethusa by Stimpson, on the 
 cover of one of the separates of the '"Prodromus" (teste S. I. Smith).
