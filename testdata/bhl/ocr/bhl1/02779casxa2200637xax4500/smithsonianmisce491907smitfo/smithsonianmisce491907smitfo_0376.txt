 Genus DRO^IIDIA Stimpson 

The group which we have separated from Dromia, under the 
 generic title of Dromidia, is very closely allied to the old genus 
 restricted, in form and general appearance. The following charac- 
 ters mav be mentioned as distinguishing it, some of which, however, 
 mav not prove to be of generic value when additional species shall 
 be discovered. The carapax is convex and pilose, the hair or setse 
 being often of considerable length. The front is narrow, and the 
 hepatic regions more or less concave or excavated anteriorly. The 
 palate is marked by a strong ridge on either side. The posterior 
 feet are similar to those of Dromia, but the last pair is generally 
 longer than the penult pair. The appendages to the penult joint of 
 the abdomen are minute and concealed. In the sternum of the 
 female the copulatory sulci are produced, and approximated at their 
 extremities in a more or less tuberculiform projection situated be- 
 tween the bases of the chelipeds. 

In the typical species, D. hirsutissima, the palpus of the outer 
 maxillipeds is articulated to the meros rather at its apex than at its 
 inner angle, as noticed by De Haan. This, however, results from 
 the elongation of the meros- joint and the obliquity of its anterior 
 margin. It does not seem to be a character of much importance, 
 and is not seen in other species of the genus. 

As in former descriptions of Dromicc no mention is made of char- 
 acters which are here considered generic, it will be impossible to 
 arrange all of the known species into groups without a re-examina- 
 tion of the specimens; but we conjecture that D. globosa, gibbosa,. 
 nnidcntata. and rotunda will be found to belong in the present genus.
