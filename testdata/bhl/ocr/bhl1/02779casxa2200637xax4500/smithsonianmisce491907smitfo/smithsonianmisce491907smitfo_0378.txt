The following description was taken from a }oung female speci- 
 men. The body and feet are covered with pubescence which is 
 longest beneath. Carapax smooth, strongly and regularly convex, 
 equallv so anteriorly as posteriorly. The sides are nearly parallel, 
 so that it has a quadrate appearance, were it not for the protrusion 
 of the front. The sides of the carapax below the sulcus, where pro- 
 tected by the retracted feet, are membranaceous. This is probably 
 a mark of immaturity. The subhepatic regions are deeply excavated 
 in front. Front small, bifid as seen from above, but with a smaller, 
 slender, curved, acute, median tooth below ; tooth over eye peduncle 
 small, external orbital angle not dentiform. No teeth on antero- 
 lateral margin except that forming the external angle of the hepatic 
 excavation and that at the deep lateral sulcus. The anterior margin 
 of the meros- joint in the external maxillipeds is oblique and the ex- 
 ternal angle obtuse. Chelipeds small, angular, but with smooth sur- 
 faces ; carpus protuberant and with a strong superior tooth ; hand 
 without teeth ; fingers compressed nearly as long as the palm. Hair 
 on the outer side of the hand dense, arranged in longitudinal lines. 
 Ambulatory feet of moderate length, fifth pair longer than the 
 fourth. Abdomen of the female with an obtuse carina. On the in- 
 ferior surface of the body the thick, hairy covering is excavated in 
 numerous pits or concavities, at the bottoms of which the protuber- 
 ant parts of the abdomen and foot-bases appear, almost bare of 
 pubescence. Color brownish ; fingers of chelipeds pale crimson. 
 Length of carapax, 0.37 ; breadth, 0.35 inch. 

In our specimen, which is evidently a young one, the copulatory 
 sulci are indistinct, and produced only to the fifth sternal segment. 

It w'as found among soft sponges dredged in six fathoms, on a 
 muddy bottom, in Port Jackson, Australia. 

Genus CRYPTODRO^IIA Stimpson 

This name has been proposed for a group of small species which 
 are very numerous in the East Indian and Pacific seas. They are 
 littoral in their habits, and always found concealed in some foreign 
 living body, generally a compound ascidian. They are easily recog- 
 nized by their size and aspect, being small, subglobular, and covered 
 with a very short pubescence only. The carapax is generally a little
