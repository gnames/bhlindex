broader than long, with a rather broad front. Teeth of antero- 
 lateral margin often bifurcated. Palate armed with a ridge on each 
 side. External maxillipeds as in Drouiia. Feet as in Droiiiia, but 
 always more or less nodose. Posterior pair longer than the penult 
 pair. The copulatory sulci of the female sternum are remote from 
 each other, and terminate in the fourth segment ( that of the second 
 pair of feet), each in a little tubercle. The abdomen is generally 
 armed with nodiform or spiniform projections. The male abdomen 
 is sufficiently broad, with free (unsoldered) segments; appendages 
 to the penult joint conspicuous ; terminal joint usually broader than 
 long. 

The Droiiiia nodipcs of Lamarck and D. lateralis of Gray belong 
 to this genus, and perhaps also D. fallax and D. caput-mortnnm. 
 These species have not yet been fully described, however, and in the 
 uncertainty we name as the type C. coroiiata, described below.

Carapax broader than long, evenly convex ; surface minutely 
 roughened with grains and covered with a very short but strongly 
 adhering pubescence. Front very broad, 5-toothed, teeth large and 
 sharply projecting, subequal ; middle one somewhat smaller than the 
 others and placed at a lower level ; outer or lateral ones situated on 
 the superior margin of the orbit. The inferior orbital tooth is nearly 
 equal in size to those of the front. External hiatus or notch of orbit 
 not deep ; tooth at external angle scarcely prominent. Antero-lateral 
 margin 5-toothed, but with two teeth only showing prominently, the 
 posterior tooth being as small as the angle of the orbit, and the sec- 
 ond tooth being at a much lower level than the others, and on the sub- 
 hepatic region. The two large teeth are slightly bilobed, the an- 
 terior lobe in each being a sharp tooth, but the posterior one broadly 
 rounded. Feet nodose ; tubercles not very numerous, but promi- 
 nent ; interspaces reticulated. This reticulation is best seen on the 
 outer snrface of the hand, which is entirely covered by it. Chelipeds 
 equal. Fingers very strongly gaping, dentate at tips; dactylus 
 slightly compressed, with a broad, deep sulcus on the front or outer 
 surface, and 2-3-dentate on the inner edge toward base. The feet 
 of the last pair are considerably longer than those of the penult 
 pair. Male abdomen rather broad; last joint much broader than
