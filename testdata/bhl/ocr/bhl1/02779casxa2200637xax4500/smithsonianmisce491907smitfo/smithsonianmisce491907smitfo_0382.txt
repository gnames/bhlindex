long; penult joint narrower; third and fourth joints each with four

 the dorsal aspect. Fingers of chelipeds carmine. Length of cara- 
 pax in the male, 0.525 ; breadth. 0.56 inch.

 Droinia lateralis Gray, Zoological Aliscellany, p. 40. 

Our specimens agree with the description above cited, except in 
 dimensions, which are, according to Gray : "Length, 7 ; breadth, 61/2 
 lines." In ours the carapax is broader than long. But Gray may 
 have measured the body as protruding beyond the carapax behind. 

The front is large, very strongly projecting, and bicuspid. Color 
 luiiform, light yellowish-brown. 

Found at low-water mark on rock}' and stony ground and among 
 sponges, in six fathoms, muddy bottom, Port Jackson, Australia.

 separated by a considerable interval from the orbital angle. On the 
 subhepatic region there is an arched row of tubercles or teeth ex- 
 tending from the extero-inferior corner of the orbit to the second 
 lateral tooth ; these tubercles diminish in size outward ; the two near- 
 est the e}'e are very strongly prominent and are nearly as large as 
 the lateral teeth. There are also two teeth in a transverse row
