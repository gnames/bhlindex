CRUSTACEA XORTH PACIFIC EXPLORING EXPEDITION 175 

tuberculated, with conical tubercles ; on the carpus there are three or 
 four large and about ten small tubercles. On the hand there are 
 twenty to twent\-five tubercles, variable in size, mostly on the ex- 
 ternal surface. The inside of the hand is densely pubescent. Fin- 
 gers in the male gaping, much compressed, and tapering towards 
 the extremities. The first and second pairs of ambulatory feet are 
 sharply verrucose, four or five of these teeth or verrucse on the 
 superior margin of the carpal joint. Abdomen of the female, with 
 the third, fourth, and fifth joints each armed with four tubercles, 
 two in the middle and one on either side. These tubercles are some- 
 times seen also in the male abdomen, but less constantly than in the 
 female. The color is much obscured, but appears to be, in living 
 specimens, a dark neutral tint, mottled with greenish ; fingers white. 
 Length of carapax in the male, 0.43 ; breadth, 0.52 inch. 

Found at Selio Island in Caspar Strait, at the Island of Kikaisima, 
 and on the shores of Kagosima Bay. At the latter place it occurred 
 under stones, among boulders, in the middle divisions of the littoral 
 zone.

 [78J, 1858. 

Carapax smooth, short-pubescent, convex, extremely tumid at the 
 gastric and hepatic regions, the dorsum rising abruptly behind the 
 front. The front is like that of C. tuhcvculata, but the lateral teeth 
 (of the three interocular ones) are more prominent than the middle 
 one, Antero-lateral margin with three small equal tuberculiform 
 teeth besides the fourth or usual one at the lateral sulcus, which is 
 much behind the third. One strong tubercle on the subhepatic re- 
 gion in the interval between the orbit and the first lateral tooth. One 
 tubercle at the antero-lateral angle of buccal area. Chelipeds 
 sparsely verrucose ; three or four tubercles on the carpus ; four on 
 the hand above, two at the base, and two nearly obsolete at the junc- 
 ture of the dactylus ; outer surface of the hand smooth or with some 
 longitudinal lines of obsolete granules. Fingers in the male very 
 much gaping, touching only at the tips ; in the females compressed 
 and not gaping. Ambulatory feet of the first and second pairs irreg- 
 ularly protuberant, scarcely verrucose ; upper margin of carpal joint 
 on the inner side strongly convex and smooth. Abdomen of both 
 sexes smooth, the tubercles, if any. being obsolete in our specimens. 
 Color in preserved specimens yellowish ; fingers crimson at the mid- 
 dle. Length of the carapax in the female, 0.38 ; breadth. 0.45 inch.
