CRUSTACEA NORTH PACIFIC EXPLORING EXPEDITION 177 

the external maxilHpeds the palpus is inserted at the internal angle 
 of the meros, the anterior margin of which is consequently trans- 
 verse. The feet are of moderate size, with the meros- joint not 
 dilated ; fingers of the first pair with calcareous apices. The feet of 
 the posterior two pairs are smaller and shorter than the rest, though 
 about equaling each other in length. They have subcheliform ex- 
 tremities, the penult joint being armed with a spiniform process 
 nearly as long as the minute sharp dactylus. The abdomen is un- 
 armed ; that of the male is rather narrow, with its penult joint con- 
 tracted, appendages conspicuous. 

The species are of large size, and the adult individuals do not 
 appear to carry about with them any protecting body. 

Found in the warmer seas of both oceans. Type, D. vulgaris.

This large species is common on muddy bottoms in from four to 
 ten fathoms in the harbor of Hongkong, China. In one of our speci- 
 mens, a male, the carapax measures 3.4 inches in length and 4.05 
 inches in breadth. It is everywhere covered with a thick coat of 
 short dark-brown hairs or bristles. The carapax beneath this coat 
 is reddish. Fingers bare, red. 

In De Haan's figure of this species (Fauna Jap., Crust., pi. xxxii) 
 the penult joint of the male abdomen is represented of about the 
 same breadth as the fifth and seventh, while in our examples it is 
 considerably narrower. The first and second ambulatory feet are 
 also shorter tiian he has figured them. 

Genus PSEUDODROMIA Stimpson 

The carapax is narrow, much longer than broad, convex, and 
 pubescent. In the specimen upon which the genus is founded the 
 shell is but little indurated posteriorly. The facial region is more 
 than half as wide as the carapax. Front triangular, very promi- 
 nent, almost rostriform. The epistome or interantennulary triangle 
 is not soldered to the front as in allied genera. Palate armed wnth
