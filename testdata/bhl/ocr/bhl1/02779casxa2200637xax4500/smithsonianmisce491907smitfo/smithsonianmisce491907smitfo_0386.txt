ridges. In the external maxillipeds the external angle of the meros 
 is obtusely rounded and the palpus rather large. The feet are sim- 
 ilar to those of Dromia in character, but those of the fifth pair are of 
 great length, longer than the second pair. For want of female speci- 
 mens we cannot ascertain the character of the copulatory sulci. The 
 male abdomen is unarmed, elongated, tapering to a point, with its 
 joints all free; appendages of penult joint minute; terminal joint 
 triangular, much longer than broad. 

The narrow carapax and very long posterior feet will serve to dis- 
 tinguish this genus.

The description is drawn up from a single specimen, a male, per- 
 haps young. The body is mostly covered with a short pubescence, 
 becoming longer, however, on the edges of the feet. The back of 
 the carapax is smooth and glabrous, in some parts nearly destitute of 
 pubescence. Carapax elongated, contracted a little at the lateral 
 sulci and at the facial region and dilated a little near the posterior 
 extremity. Lateral margins smooth, no tooth even at lateral sulcus. 
 Interantennary front very narrow, rostriform, triangular, deflexed ; 
 apex obscurely tridentate and setose. A slight angle, but no tooth 
 over eye peduncle, and no tooth on the external or inferior side of 
 the orbit. The hiatus of interantennulary septum is very narrow, 
 but extends all the way back, entirely disjoining the epistome from 
 the front. Chelipeds smooth, rounded ; fingers toothed as usual in 
 Dromice, but very sharp. Ambulatory feet also smooth, their ter- 
 minal nails very long and sharp. When folded the last pair of feet 
 are thrown forward of the second pair, and reach quite to their ex- 
 tremities. The male abdomen is long and tapering, last joint with 
 acuminated extremity. Color yellowish-white. Length of the cara- 
 pax. 0.38 ; breadth, 0.27 ; length of posterior pair of feet, 0.39 inch. 

This animal can draw itself deeply into its thin "jacket" or cover- 
 ing (a compound tunicary), and pucker up the aperture so as to be 
 entirely concealed. 

It was dredged in twelve fathoms on a sandy bottom in Simons 
 Bay, Cape of Good Hope.
