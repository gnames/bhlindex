CRUSTACEA iXORTH PACIFIC EXPLORING EXPEDITION 179 

Genus PETALOMERA Stimpson 

The carapax in this genus is oblong or subovate, longer than 
 broad, and with the exception of the epimera well indurated. The 
 epimera, or sides beneath the lateral sulci, are membranaceous, being 
 protected by the expansions of the meros-joints of the feet. The 
 front is prominent and tridentate. Lateral margins convex, with 
 no prominent angle. The facial region is sufficiently broad, with 
 the antennae closely packed and flattened on their outer sides, show- 
 ing an even surface. Buccal area rather small, neatly filled by the 
 external maxillipeds, and much broader anteriorly than posteriorly. 
 Palate armed with ridges. Anterior margin of meros- joint of ex- 
 ternal maxillipeds oblique. The meros-joints of the anterior three 
 pairs of feet are dilated above with rounded lamelliform expansions. 
 The extremities of the fingers of the chelipeds are cochleariform and 
 corneous. The posterior two pairs of feet are much like those of 
 Dromia, the last pair longest.

Pctalomera grauidata Stimpson, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., x, p. 240 
 [78], 1858. 

Carapax convex, sparsely but conspicuously granulated. The lat- 
 eral sulcus is situated at the posterior third of the length. Frontal 
 median tooth inferior and very small ; lateral ones very prominent ; 
 supraorbital tooth small ; outer orbital fissure closed. Three small 
 inconspicuous granulated teeth on the antero-lateral margin, between 
 the scarcely prominent orbital angle and the lateral sulcus, the first 
 one subhepatic. A small process on the second joint of the external 
 antennae. Feet all granulated except the posterior pair, which are 
 smooth. Chelipeds granulated and crested ; crest of carpus spinu- 
 lose ; a tubercle at the summit of the carpus and one at that of the 
 hand. The fingers are short, not gaping, with a transverse or 
 oblique ridge on the outer surface defining the corneous tips, and 
 having some resemblance in the side view to the bill of the Mormon, 
 or puffin. The superior margin of the lamellar dilatation in the 
 meros-joints of the feet is smooth and sharp. Color in life orange, 
 with reddish clouds. Length of the carapax in the male, 0.36; 
 breadth, 0.33 inch.
