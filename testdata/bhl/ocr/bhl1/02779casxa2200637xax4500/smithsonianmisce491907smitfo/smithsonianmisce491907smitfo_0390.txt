Taken from a shelly bottom in twenty fathoms, in Kagosima Bay, 
 Japan. 

Genus COXX^HCECETES Stimpson 

This genus is founded upon the old Cancer artificiosns of Herbst, 
 which, like Guerin's Hypoconclia, uses a valve of the shell of some 
 acephalous mollusk for its transportable covering and hiding place. 
 Its posterior feet present, therefore, modifications specially adapted 
 for securing this kind of habitaculum. 

The carapax is depressed, subpentagonal in shape, and nearly 
 naked. The dorsal sulci are conspicuous. Besides the usual sulci 
 arising from postero-lateral notches, there is another, of considerable 
 depth, extending from the antero-lateral corner of the carapax to 
 the transverse gastro-cardiac suture. The front is rather narrow. 
 The palate is armed with ridges. The feet of the fourth pair are 
 robust, thicker than those of the second and third pairs, and nearly 
 as long; the dactylus is large and hook-shaped, recurving upon an 
 obtuse process of the penult joint at its base. The feet of the fifth 
 or last pair are very slender, and their extremities are not subcheli- 
 form, having only a minute, somewhat twisted dactylus. Our only 
 female specimen is immature, but the sternal sulci seem to be like 
 those of Dromia proper. The male abdomen is of moderate breadth, 
 with the fifth and sixth joints apparently soldered together, although 
 the commissure is distinct; appendages to penult joint rounded; 
 terminal joint subcordate, as broad as long. 

The only species known is an inhabitant of the East Indian seas.
