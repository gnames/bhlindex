its external hiatus, coming in contact with the eye. The movable 
 peduncle of the antennze is more or less crested. The epimeral 
 pieces of the carapax are posteriorly continuous and entire. Cheli- 
 peds broad and depressed. Dactyli of the ambulatory feet of the 
 normal form — that is, short and robust — without supplementary 
 unguicles. 

The name Pisidia of Leach can properly be retained neither for 
 Petrolisthes nor for Porccllana restricted, since Leach's genus was 
 founded upon a purely fanciful character, and about half its species 
 will go in one of those genera and half in the othei. 

The species of Petrolisthes are very numerous, inhabiting the 
 tropical and temperate zones in both oceans. They are strictly lit- 
 toral in station. The following species, heretofore described, may 
 be classed here, P. I'iolacca being considered the type : 

Porccllana violacca Guerin. Porcellana dcntata M. Edw. 

valida Dana. tomentosa Dana. 

rupicola Stimpson. boscii Savigny. 

elongata M. Edw. galathina Bosc. 

japonica De Haan. hirsuta Gray. 

asiatica Gra}^ cdzvardsii De S. 

polita Gray. tnberciilata Guer. 

armata Gibbes. tiibcrciilifrons M. E. & L.

This species in life is of a purplish or reddish-brown color above, 
 with a bluish-white hoariness in old specimens. Beneath deep crim- 
 son. It is sometimes found of a much larger size than is mentioned 
 by Dana ; thus, in a specimen from Japan, the carapax measures 
 0.61 inch in length and 0.575 in breadth; the hand 1.05 in length. 
 Most specimens differ somewhat from Dana's figure, as follows : 
 The angles are less rounded and the carpus in the right cheliped has 
 fewer teeth on the anterior margin, is not so closely serrated on the 
 posterior margin, and is more prominent at the external angle.
