CRUSTACEA NORTH PACIFIC EXPLORING EXPEDITION 183 

It is very common on the shores of the Western Pacific, ranging 
 in station from low-water mark to above half-tide level on rocky and 
 stony ground. It was found by us in Kagosima Bay, at the Bonin 
 Islands, at Ousima, and on the outer shore of' Hongkong Island.

The carapax and feet are everywhere pubescent above. The 
 margins of the feet, and particularly the outer margin of the hands, 
 are densely ciliated. Carapax subovate, very slightly longer than 
 broad, sides rounded, and not margined with an elevated line, but 
 armed with a minute spine in the post-orbital sinus. Front some- 
 what trilobate ; median lobe largest, rounded, and sufficiently promi- 
 nent. Suborbital margin not deeply concave. Basal crest of outer 
 antennae much projecting. External apex of the ischium in the 
 external maxillipeds not produced. The chelipeds above are nearly 
 smooth beneath the pubescence, but in part minutely and sparsely 
 spinulose ; meros spinulose above ; front margin of carpus five- 
 or six-toothed, the tooth being alternately large and small, the 
 large ones sometimes denticulated, inner tooth largest, no tooth on 
 the part next the hand ; a few spinules along the posterior side of 
 the carpus ; outer margin of the hand armed with ten small spines 
 above the marginal series of cilise ; superior edge of dactylus denticu- 
 lated. Upper margin of the meros-joint in the ambulatory feet 
 spinulose. Color above bluish-white, distantly and regularly spotted 
 with purplish-brown, the carapax having four spots about the mid- 
 dle and others about the margin ; feet each with four or five spots ; 
 beneath white. Length of carapax in the male, 0.31 ; breadth, 
 0.295; length of larger hand, 0.46; breadth, 0.19 inch. 

\'ery near to P. toincntosa Dana (loc. cit., i, 420, pi. xxvi^ fig. 10), 
 but the carapax is broader, with a more depressed and even surface ; 
 the outer margin of the hand is spinulose along the whole length; 
 the outer maxillipeds are not smooth, but transversely lineolated, 
 and the meros of the ambulatory feet is spinulose above for the whole 
 length. 

Found under large stones on the ocean shore of Foukow Bay, 
 Ousima.
