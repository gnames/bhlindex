 gin of carpus armed with three or four elongated but not very 
 prominent teeth. Ambulatory feet hairy ; meros sparsely spinulose

Genus RAPHIDOPUS Stimpson 

In this form, so distinct from the ordinary Porccllanar, the carapax 
 is rounded, broader than long, and a little projecting at the sides. 
 The front is transverse, not prominent, and tridentate. The eyes 
 are very small and deep-seated. The first or coxal joint of the ex- 
 ternal antennae is very large, joining the superior margin of the 
 carapax, and much produced, far removing the movable portion of 
 the antennae from the orbit. The external maxillipeds are of the 
 usual form ; the ischium, however, is short, verv much dilated and
