rounded within, and its external apex is not produced. The cheH- 
 peds are not broad and depressed, but thick; the hands are about 
 equal, but not large, so that they do not touch each other when the 
 chelipeds are folded against the face. Finall}- the dactyli of the 
 ambulatory feet are of a shape remarkably different from anything 
 yet observed in the family ; instead of the short, thick, curved form 
 observed in all other genera, we have a straight, slender, elongated 
 terminal joint shaped like a stiletto or a flattened needle, and sharplv 
 pointed, but without any indication of a distinct unguiculus. This 
 form of feet is well adapted to the habits of the animal, enabling it 
 to move with facility through the soft mud in which it lives. 
 . It is an inhabitant of moderately deep water, and the only known 
 species is found in the Chinese seas.

Sides of the body and margins of the feet thickly ciliated with 
 long, fine hairs. Carapax pubescent, somewhat areolated ; surface a 
 little uneven, and transversely rugate. Lateral margin strongly con- 
 vex, with a fissure behind the base of the external antennae, two 
 small teeth or spines near the middle, and a spine on the postero- 
 lateral margin at the extremity of a short oblique ridge. Frontal 
 teeth minute, the median one most prominent. Anterior margin but 
 slightly sinuated at the orbits. Latero-inferior regions of the cara- 
 pax strongly striated or longitudinally ridged, especially posteriorly ; 
 ridges few in number and subdistant. The external antennae are 
 four or five times as long as the carapax and folded backwards. 
 Chelipeds large, angular, and very hairy ; meros large, more than 
 two-thirds as long as the carpus, roughened above and armed below 
 with a single long, sharp, curved spine ; carpus about two-thirds as 
 long as the hand, roughened above, with a median longitudinal spinu- 
 lated ridge, its anterior margin not dilated, slightly concave and 
 serrulated ; its posterior margin convex and armed with five spin- 
 ules ; smaller hand elongated, subtriangular. with three longitudinal 
 obtuse ridges, minutely crenulated or spinulated. on the upper sur- 
 face ; fingers longer than the palm, not gaping, tips much curved, 
 crossing each other, inner edges minutely denticulated but not 
 toothed ; inner edge of immovable finger slightly dilated. In the 
 larger hand the dactylus is subcristate above, with a slightly promi-
