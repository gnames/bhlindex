nent tooth on the crest near the middle, and is armed with a tooth 
 within near the base; the immovable finger bears a strong tooth at 
 the middle of its inner edge. Ambulatory feet long, slender, 
 sUghtly compressed ; meros not dilated ; dactyli as long as the penult 
 joint, and slightly sulcated on one side toward extremities ; dactylus 
 of last pair of feet shorter than the others. Color white or pale 
 yellowish-brown, obscured by sordes. Length of carapax in the 
 female, 0.3; breadth, 0.39; length of hand, 0.5. 

Taken abundantly with the trawl on a muddy bottom in six fath- 
 oms, in a bay on the coast of China opposite Hongkong. 

Genus PACHYCHELES Stimpson 

This genus is readily recognized by its peculiar habit. Its form 
 is less depressed than in Petrolisthcs, and, while the carapax is 
 smooth, the chelipeds are thick and coarse in appearance, short, and 
 irregularly protuberant or granulated above. The carapax is 
 rounded-ovate, at least as broad as long, with the lateral margins 
 marked by an elevated line, the front somewhat deflexed, a little 
 prominent at the middle, and subacute, but never dentated, with its 
 apex concealed by pubescence. The epimeral pieces of the carapax 
 are not soldered, but separated by membranaceous interspaces, the 
 posterior square piece being particularly well defined. In this latter 
 point this genus differs from all the others of the family. The first 
 joint of the external antenna; is sufficiently well developed in its 
 internal angle, touching, though not joining, the superior margin of 
 the carapax, and excluding the movable portion from the orbit ; it is, 
 however, not produced outward or backward, as in Porcellana 
 proper and allied genera. The carpus of the chelipeds is remarkably 
 short and broad. Dactyli of the ambulatory feet normal in form. 

The genus is littoral in its habits, and is an inhabitant of the tem- 
 perate and warm-temperate zones in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. 

Porcellana grossimana of Guerin may be considered the type of 
 this genus, which also includes the P. 111 on il if era of Dana and P. 
 iiatalensis Krauss.
