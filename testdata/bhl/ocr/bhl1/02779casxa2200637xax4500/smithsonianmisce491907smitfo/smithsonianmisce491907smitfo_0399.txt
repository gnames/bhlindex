Carapax broad-ovate, smooth, not areolated, in the middle glabrous 
 and punctate, at the sides slightly striated transversely, and an- 
 teriorly obsoletely granulated. Sinus of the posterior margin shal- 
 low, broadly rounded. Front sufficiently prominent, triangular, 
 slightly pubescent. Chelipeds robust, granulated. In the greater 
 cheliped the meros is transversely striated above; the carpus broad 
 and granulated, the granules unequal, the larger ones being some- 
 times arranged in more or less regular longitudinal rows ; anterior 
 margin of the carpus three-toothed, the teeth being prominent, trun- 
 cated, and denticulated, and the inner tooth bifurcated ; hand granu- 
 lated, granules of the margins very prominent and lobulated ; fingers 
 not gaping; immovable finger triangular, a little pubescent within at 
 the base ; dactylus with marginal granules less prominent than those 
 of the palm. In the smaller cheliped the anterior margin of the car- 
 pus is convex, prominent, and not deeply tridentate ; the hand is 
 longitudinally bisulcated on its upper surface, and the fingers are not 
 tomentose. The ambulatory feet are provided with stout, short 
 hairs ; dactyli robust, with curved, almost hook-like extremities. 
 Length of the carapax in the female, 0.5 ; breadth, 0.525 ; length of 
 greater hand, 0.64; breadth, 0.36 inch. 

Found on the west coast of Jesso by Capt. H. K. Stevens, of the

Genus PORCELLANA Lamarck restricted 

We have restricted the name Porcellana to that group which in- 
 cludes most of the old Lamarckian species, and of which P. platy- 
 chclcs may be considered the type. The carapax is generally longer
