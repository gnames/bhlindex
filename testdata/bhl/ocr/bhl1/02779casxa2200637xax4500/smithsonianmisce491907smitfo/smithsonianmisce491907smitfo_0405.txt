CRUSTACEA NORTH PACIFIC E-XPLORIXG EXPEDITION 191 

maxillipeds rather long and slender. Chelipeds nearly smooth, 
 minntely reticulated above; carpus large, with the front and back 
 margins each armed with three small teeth ; palm of the hand with a 
 row of little spines contiguous to the margin; fingers twisted into 
 an almost vertical plane, and tomentose within ; fingers of the larger 
 hand each one-toothed within ; those of the smaller hand excavated. 
 The color in life is very variable ; it is generally dark greenish, often 
 brownish maculated with white. Length of carapax in the male, 
 0.25 ; breadth, 0.22 inch. 

This species is very closely allied, if not identical, with the P. 
 armata of Dana, 1852 (not of Gibbes, 1850), but appears to differ 
 in its broader front, the middle portion of which is quadridentate 
 and its upper surface not so deeply concave. 

Found among net-weed on a sandy bottom in three fathoms, in 
 the strait between the islands Katonaisima and Ousima ; also on 
 madrepores taken at one fathom depth on the east side of Hong- 
 kong.

Carapax regularly though very slightly convex ; surface glabrous, 
 obsoletely striated, nearly smooth, but scarcely even, the proto- 
 gastric globules being sufficiently prominent. Lateral margin con- 
 vex, acute, and irregularly denticulated in the middle, two of the 
 little teeth being larger than the rest. The front is neither broad 
 nor prominent, but deeply tridentate ; teeth acute ; middle tooth de- 
 filexed and slightly larger, but no more prominent than the lateral 
 ones, and bearing a slight tooth or angle on each side ; lateral teeth 
 sharply triangular. Eyes small. Latero-inferior regions of the 
 carapax longitudinally striated. External maxillipeds slender; 
 ischium small. Chelipeds large, unequal; tooth or summit of meros 
 very prominent; carpus smooth, with the front and back margins 
 each obsoletely 2-3-toothed; smaller hand with a median longi- 
 tudinal ridge or angular prominence, outer margin obsoletely dentic- 
 ulated, pincers twisted into a vertical plane, broadly excavated and 
 pilose within; extremity of immovable finger emarginated. In the 
 larger hand the dactylus is oblique, shorter than the other finger and 
 iDidentate within; immovable finger unidentate within; tips curved. 
 The meros- joints of the ambulatory feet are slender, and almost 
 smooth on the superior margin.
