194 SMITHSOXIAX MISCELLAXEOUS COLLECTlOXS 

men the central triangular piece is small, while the lateral pieces are 
 very large. The color in life is white, with a few large, blue, mar- 
 ginated spots or ocelli on the hands and the anterior portion of the 
 carapax. Length of the carapax in the male, 0.425 ; breadth, 0.34 ; 
 length of greater hand, 0.59 ; breadth, 0.2 inch. 

This species is found in considerable numbers hiding between the 
 leaves of the common Pcnnatnla on mudd_\' bottoms in six fathoms, 
 in the bays opposite Hongkong, China. 

Genus POLYONYX Stimpson 

This genus is closely allied to Mcgalohroch'utm in form and gen- 
 eral appearance, but differs in the character of the terminal joints of 
 its feet and its habits. It also resembles Pisosoiiia, but may be 
 distinguished by the enlargement of the coxal joint of the antennae. 

Carapax rounded-oval, as broad as or broader than long, convex, 
 and smooth. Sides strongly convex and obtuse. Front rather nar- 
 row, straight, and not prominent. Eyes minute. First joint of 
 antennulas not toothed, but flattened or truncate at the outer surface. 
 Coxal joint of antennae as in Porccllaiia. etc., but very much elon- 
 gated. Chelipeds smooth; meros-joint large. When the chelipeds 
 are folded or retracted the hands do not touch each other. The 
 dactyli of the ambulatory feet are very short and broad, rounded 
 and armed with two or more unguicles on the inner edge. 

The typical species of this genus, F. macrochcles (Gibbes),is known 
 to be parasitic, living in the tubes of large worms. The habits of 
 the other two species, P. binugnlatus and sinensis, are not certainly 
 known, but are probably similar. They inhabit sandy or muddy 
 places, sometimes above low-water mark, but often in water of con- 
 siderable depth. Found in the warm parts of both oceans.

Carapax convex, of a subquadrate form, with the corners rounded ; 
 surface smooth, but faintly striated near the margins. Front rather 
 broad, scarcely perceptibly convex. Chelipeds very unequal, smooth, 
 and glossy ; in the larger one the meros is more than one-half as 
 large as the carpus, and not dilated anteriorly ; carpus almost as long 
 as the hand, with its anterior margin expanded into a laminiform
