CRUSTACEA NORTH PACIFIC EXPLORING EXPEDITION 195 

dilatation, broadest toward the hand ; hand thick, short-ciUated ex- 
 teriorly, and with a few hairs about the middle within ; fingers short, 
 slightly unidentate within, tips curved; dactylus shorter than the 
 immovable finger. Ambulatory feet slender, naked; one or two 
 small spinules on the inferior edge of the penult joint ; dactyli with 
 one or two minute unguicles besides the principal one. In life this 
 species is of a clear, pale bluish-gray color, with large spots of a 
 neutral tint or sepia color. Length of the carapax in the male, 
 0.15 ; breadth, 0.2; length of the larger cheliped. 0.52 inch. 

It was dredged from a bottom of shelly sand in twenty-six fath- 
 oms, in the China Sea. under the twenty-third parallel of north 
 latitude.

Our specimens are broad and depressed, with a single row of 
 ciliated pits or impressed lineolse along the postero-lateral margin. 
 Color above bluish-gray, minutely clouded ; below white. We figure 
 one of our specimens, in order to indicate with more certainty the 
 species we have in hand, which we cannot certainly identify with 
 R. tcstudinarius, a species known to us only from the descriptions 
 and figures of European authors, who do not always agree in their 
 statements with regard to it. The figure in the "Regne Animal," 
 referred to above, is a good representation of the largest of our speci- 
 mens. But Milne Edwards gives Australia as the habitat of the 
 species. 

The expedition specimens were found on the sandy shore of a bay 
 on the eastern side of the island of Ousima. 

Genus MASTIGOPUS Stimpson 

This genus is remarkable for the form of its anterior feet (for 
 which the name chelipeds would here be inapplicable), which re- 
 semble more antennae than feet, as seen in other genera of Deca- 
 poda. It is allied to Remipes in form and general character, but the 
 body is more slender. The carapax is elongated and toothed at the
