antero-lateral margins. The front is tridentate. The antennse are 
 short, as in Rcmipcs. The antennulse are also short, with the in- 
 ferior tlagelhim very small, almost rudimentary. The external max- 
 illipeds are nearly as in Hip pa, with exarthroid palpus ; the apex of 
 the meros- joint is, however, truncated. In the anterior feet the 
 basal or peduncular joints resemble those of Hip pa and Re mi pes, 
 but the terminal joint is flagelliform â€” that is, long, slender, and 
 multiarticulate. The ambulatory feet and the abdomen resemble 
 those of Reiiiipes, but the external lamella, in the appendages to the 
 penult joint, is much shorter than the internal one.

Carapax strongly convex in its transverse outline ; surface even, 
 but scabrous with asperities, which consist of short transverse im- 
 pressed lines, minutely setose, and most strongly marked anteriorly. 
 Front with three sharp teeth, median one triangular and nearly as 
 prominent as the lateral ones, which are long, slender, and acute. 
 Antero-lateral margin armed with six subspiniform teeth, the an- 
 terior one longest, the rest progressively diminishing. Eyes very 
 long and slender, more than half as long as the antennulse, which 
 are one-third as long as the carapax. External maxillipeds oblong, 
 nearly rectangular, half as broad as long ; their surface flat and 
 nearly smooth, glabrous, with a few scattered punct?e. The basal or 
 peduncular joints of the anterior feet are short, smooth, and nearly 
 naked ; penult and antepenult cylindrical ; terminal segment or flagel- 
 lum longer than the carapax, and consisting of twelve elongated 
 joints, with a ring of long setae at each articulation. Ambulatory 
 feet moderately hairy. Terminal joint of the abdomen lanceolate, 
 thick, with two longitudinal ridges or angles at the base and a deep 
 median sulcus toward the extremity, which is acuminated. The 
 colors in life are as follows : Carapax dark olive, becoming paler at 
 the middle, and brownish at the margins. Front often reddish. A 
 white band crosses the carapax at its posterior extremity. Abdomen 
 bluish, with transverse lead-colored bands at the middle segments. 
 Members all white, with the exception of the external antennae, 
 which are pale blue. Body beneath, white. Length of the carapax
