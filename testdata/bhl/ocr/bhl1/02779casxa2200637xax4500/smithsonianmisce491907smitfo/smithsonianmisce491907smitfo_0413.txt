niostl\- smooth and glabrous, except toward their edges and extrem- 
 ities, where they are sharp-granulated or short-spinulose. The 
 larger hand is thus granulated, the granules being ver\' small, with 
 sharp black apices ; they are numerous above and on the fingers, but 
 sparsely distributed on the outer surface. The dactyli of the ambu- 
 latory feet are spinulose and hairy ; those of the right side are some- 
 what flattened, but not angular. In the third foot of the left side 
 the carpal joint is produced at the inferior angle; and the last two 
 joints are depressed externally, but not flat, and have a smooth 
 punctate surface ; the dactylus is convex and spinulose within. The 
 processes from the coxse of the fifth pair of feet in the male are very 
 much produced, that on the right one being longest and equaling in 
 length the fourth pair of feet. 

This species is of a deep purple color, inclining to blue, rarely dark 
 olive. The posterior part of the carapax is lighter, with four longi- 
 tudinal mahogany-colored stripes, the two inner ones forming a lyre- 
 shaped mark. Teeth of the inner surfaces of the fingers white. 
 Length of the animal, 4 inches; length of the carapax, 1.5; of the 
 gastric or anterior region, 0.96; breadth of the front, 0.31 ; greatest 
 breadth, across branchial regions, 0.87 inch. 

It diflfers from C. perlata, as figured by Milne Edwards in the 
 illustrations to the "Regne Animal," and as described by De Haan, 
 in the smooth external surface of the last two joints of the third foot 
 on the left side, and in its more hairy feet. The apex of the left- 
 hand male organ, or coxal process of the last pair of feet, is scarcely 
 truncated, as described by De Haan for C. perlata, but is deeply ex- 
 cised on the outer side of the apex, as if a square piece had been 
 cut out. 

Found in considerable numbers at the Bonin Islands, on the sides 
 of the hills surrounding Port Lloyd. It was also taken at the Ama- 
 kirrima Islands by Mr. Squires.

Of an olive color in life. Anterior part of carapax with four
