Ccnobita cazifcs Stimpson, Proc. x\cad. Nat. Sci. Phila., x, p. 245 [83], 
 1858. 

Anterior region of the carapax scarcely longer than the posterior. 
 Branchial regions slightly concave in the lateral margins, but 
 strongly projecting at the posterior angles. Surface of the anterior 
 region almost flattened, smooth and punctate in the middle, but 
 scabrous toward the sides and hairy near the margins. Frontal lat- 
 eral teeth sharp, apiculated. and placed a little within the lateral ex- 
 tremities of the front. Eyes long, compressed, and scabriculous 
 above; apices bluntly rounded; cornea projecting a little beyond the 
 extremity of the superior process of the peduncle. Ophthalmic 
 scales with acute apices and entire margins. Feet nearly naked, 
 above nearly smooth, but spinulose toward their extremities. Greater 
 hand granulated above and for a short distance on the outer surface, 
 but perfectly polished on the mahogany-colored area below. The 
 granules are white, oblong, flattened, and placed three or four diam- 
 eters distant from each other ; those of the superior margin of the 
 hand are apiculated in black at the distal extremity. Dactylus of the 
 third foot of the right side nearly cylindrical, not at all angular. 
 Third foot of the left side angular ; penult joint with its upper sur- 
 face flat and horizontally dilated outward toward the juncture of the 
 dactylus, forming a prominent ridge, its outer surface anteriorly 
 smooth and a little concave, posteriorly convex and minutely granu- 
 lated ; its lower margin anteriorly convex, posteriorly concave ; dac- 
 tylus quadrangular, on the outer surface smooth, and deeplv concave 
 toward the base, above flattened, and within flattened or concave 
 between the ridges, which are spinulose. Posterior coxas of the 
 male not produced. Length about three inches. Length of the 
 carapax, 0.95 ; length of gastric region, 0.5 ; breadth of front, 
 measured between tips of lateral spines, 0.22 ; greatest breadth, 
 across branchial regions, 0.66 inch. 

This is perhaps the same as C. couiprcssa De Haan (1. c, p. 213), 
 but the upper and outer surface of the hand is hardly "tenuissime 
 granulato." The lateral margins of the branchial regions are not 
 convex, as described for C. coiiif^rcssa of Milne Edwards. From 
 C. rugosa it differs in the cox?e of the posterior feet of the male, 
 which are not produced. 

Found at Loo Choo. in groves near the seashore, in company with 
 C. ruzosa.
