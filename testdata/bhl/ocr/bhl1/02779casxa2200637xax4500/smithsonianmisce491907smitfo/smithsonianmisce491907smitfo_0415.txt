Genus DIOGENES Dana 

We submit the following amended character of this genus : 
 Ophthalmic ring exposed between the bases of the eye-peduncles, 
 and armed with a bracteole which is often produced and rostriform. 
 Aciculum or basal scale of the external antenna broad at the base 
 and sometimes bifid ; flagellum ciliated. Chelipeds unequal, the left 
 larger, with the commissure between carpus and hand vertical and 
 marginal : hand short and broad, oblique ; the fingers oblique, with 
 calcareous, acuminate tips. Dactyli of the second and third pairs of 
 of feet long. 

The species are inhabitants of the warmer seas, and are most 
 numerous among the Asiatic islands. The following is a list of the

Carapax much smoother than in D. custos, but somewhat rough- 
 ened at the sides. Lateral margin of the anterior region armed with 
 five or six spinules. Ophthalmic rostrum smooth, and much shorter 
 than the ophthalmic scales. The eyes, ophthalmic scales, and acicles 
 are nearly like those of D. edzvardsii. The teeth or points of the 
 frontal margins are all obtuse ; the lateral ones most prominent. 
 Great cheliped naked, roughened above with minute subspiniform 
 granules ; below glabrous, but obsoletely granulated ; superior mar- 
 gin of carpus and hand serrated with small teeth, ten in number, on 
 the carpus ; hand with an oblique, infero-posterior crest on the outer 
 surface, armed with seven or eight small spines ; inferior margin of 
 hand sharp-granulated ; dactylus longitudinally costate above, costse 
 granulated. Right or smaller cheliped hairy ; carpus grooved above.
