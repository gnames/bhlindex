and with its superior margin armed with sharp spines. Ambulatory 
 feet slender, overreaching the chelipeds ; antepenult joint with den- 
 ticulated margin ; penult nearly smooth above ; dactylus hairy, com- 
 pressed, and, as usual, sulcated. Length, 1.25; length of carapax, 
 0.29; breadth of front, 0.135 ; length of great cheliped, 0.45 inch. 

From D. custos, which it resembles in the character of the greater 
 cheliped, this species differs in its shorter rostrum and the smooth 
 superior surface of the penult joint of the ambulatory feet. 

Dredged in twelve fathoms on a sandy bottom in Simons Bay,

The ophthalmic rostrum is minute and very narrow, scarcely per- 
 ceptible to the naked eye. The acicle is short, triangular, and spin- 
 ulose. Genital apertures of the male on the inner surface of the 
 coxae. In living specimens the carapax was of a pale red color ; feet 
 annulated with pale reddish brown ; larger hand white ; abdomen 
 yellow, with pale-red sides. Our largest specimen is one and one- 
 half inches in length. 

In De Haan's figure the dactyli of the ambulatory feet are repre- 
 sented too short and very much too broad ; they are in reality ver\" 
 long and slender, one-half longer than the penult joint. 

In this species we have another instance of the economic relation 
 which we so often see existing between a crustacean and a polyp. 
 Upon the outer surface of the greater hand, in all the specimens 
 we have seen, there is seated a small species of actinian. That 
 this is not accidental, we infer, not only from the occurrence of 
 the polyp tipon all our specimens of the crab, and its non-occur- 
 rence elsewhere, but from the fact that there is a special adapta- 
 tion of the outer surface of the hand to receive such a parasite ; it 
 has a smooth, oval area occupying two-thirds of the surface, and 
 partly surrounded by an elevated ridge. The polyp undoubtedly 
 derives much advantage from this position, so near the food-seizing 
 members of the crab â€” certainly enough to compensate for any hard 
 knocks its tough body may receive ; but what advantage may inure 
 to the crab is here less perceptible than in the case of Cancrisocia 
 and Dorippe. The surface of the claw to which the polyp is at-
