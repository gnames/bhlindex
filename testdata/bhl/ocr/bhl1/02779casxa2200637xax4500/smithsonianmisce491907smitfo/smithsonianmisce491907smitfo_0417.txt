CRUSTACEA NORTH PACIFIC EXPLORING EXPEDITION 203 

tached appears to be as hard as the rest, and in no need of ex- 
 traneous protection. 

This species is not uncoinmon in the China Sea, beneath the 
 twenty-third paraUel of north latitude, where we obtained several 
 from a sandy bottom in twenty to thirty fathoms. It also occurred 
 at Hongkong. 

315. DIOGENES PENICILLATUS Stimpson 

Diogenes penicillatus Stimpson, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., x, p 246 
 [84], 1858. 

Anterior part of the carapax smooth in the middle, but toward 
 the sides roughened with irregular scale-like projections, the edges 
 of which are serrated and minutely setose. Lateral teeth or points 
 of the front acuminate, and more prominent than the middle one, 
 which is obtusely rounded. The movable or ophthalmic rostrum is 
 small, spiniform, and very acute, reaching scarcely to the extremity 
 of the ophthalmic scales. Eyes in length equaling about two-thirds 
 the width of the front, reaching a little beyond the extremity of the 
 penult joint of the peduncle of the antenuc-e, and much beyond the 
 acicle ; cornea not dilated. Ophthalmic scales broad, with the ex- 
 ternal margin arcuated, and the apex 2-3-spinulose. Acicle elongate- 
 triangular, armed on the inner side with six or seven aculeiform 
 spines. Flagellum of the antennae ciliated below. Left cheliped 
 stout and broad, shaped much as in D. edwardsii, and shorter than 
 the ambulatory feet ; all three edges of the meros-joint crenulated ; 
 carpus and hand sharp-granulated on the outer surface, and covered 
 with flattened granules on the inner surface ; carpus armed with a 
 spine at the superior and one at the inferior apex, and with its upper 
 margin io-12-denticulated ; hand oblique, with two parallel rows of 
 small teeth or spines above, one at the margin, the other just below 
 it on the outer surface. The outer or perpendicular surface of the 
 hand is thickly penicillate with fine silky hair, equaling in length 
 about the thickness of the hand, the penicillated area being defined 
 posteriorly by a transverse spinous crest, which separates it from a 
 smooth, naked groove at the juncture of the carpus. The dactylus 
 of this cheliped is like the hand, armed with short spines on its 
 superior edge. The length of the animal is about i inch ; length of 
 carapax, 0.26; breadth of front, 0.13; length of great cheliped, 0.34 
 inch. 

It was dredged from a sandy bottom in thirty fathoms ofif the 
 east coast of Niphon, in latitude 38Â° N.
