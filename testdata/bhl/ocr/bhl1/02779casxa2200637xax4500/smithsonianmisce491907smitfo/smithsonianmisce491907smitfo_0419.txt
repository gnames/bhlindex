Carapax anteriorly naked and glabrous, marked nearly as in P. 
 piiiictitlatus. The lateral triangular points of the front (those be- 
 tween the bases of the eyes and antenn?e ) are rather strongly prom- 
 inent. Eye-peduncles equaling the anterior margin of the carapax 
 in length, but a little shorter than the third joint of the antennulse. 
 Ophthalmic scales large, with four minute equal spiniform teeth near 
 the apex. Peduncle of the antennae shorter than the eyes ; acicle 
 small and slender. Feet spinulose or granulose above, and mod- 
 erately invested with long hair. Left cheliped rather short, a little 
 overreaching the penult joint of the first ambulatory feet, its mar- 
 gins regularly crenidated ; lower surface smooth. In the left-hand 
 foot of the third pair the last two joints are broad and deeply ex- 
 cavated on the outer side, with crenulated and thickly ciliated mar- 
 gins, and a median longitudinal ridge, the surface near the superior 
 margin and between the median ridge and the lower margin being 
 elegantly sculptured with transverse striae or impressed lines corre- 
 sponding to the crenulations of the edges. General length in a male 
 specimen. 1.5; length of carapax, 0.34; breadth of front, 0.165 inch. 

It has the general appearance of P. f^iiiicfulafiis and the concave 
 left foot of P. sctifcr. The concavity of the foot, however, is in the 
 latter species smooth. 

It was found in Kagosima Ray, Japan.
