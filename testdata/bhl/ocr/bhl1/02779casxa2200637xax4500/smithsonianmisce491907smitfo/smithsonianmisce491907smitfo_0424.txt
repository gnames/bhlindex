2IO SMITHSONIAN MISCELLANEOUS COLLECTIONS 

Our specimens were found in dead shells of a thick, short strom- 
 bus. When alive they had a peculiar strong odor, exactly like that 
 of ripe cocoanut milk. 

They were found in Hongkong Harbor, on a muddy bottom, in 
 four fathoms ; also in Caspar Straits.

The following is a description of some specimens, which we tind 
 by comparison to be the same as Dana's : Carapax rather narrow, 
 and convex anteriorly. Front with a post-marginal furrow. Ocu- 
 lar peduncles very long, as long as or longer than the anterior region 
 of the carapax, and overreaching the third joint of antennul?e. Oph- 
 thalmic scales triangular, deeply notched exteriorly near the apex, 
 and provided with several long, stout hairs. Hands equal, some- 
 what spinous, and very hairy above ; five strong spines on the 
 superior margin of the palm. Ambulatory feet longitudinall}- vit- 
 tate, with six red stripes (counted on the penult joint), narrower 
 than their interspaces. Dactyli very slender, in length just equaling 
 the penult joint. Length one and a half inches. Length of the 
 carapax along the median line. 0.525 : breadth of anterior extremity. 
 0.225 inch. 

Found at Loo Choo.

We prefer to retain Professor Dana's name for this species until 
 opportunities occur for a more certain identification of it with M. 
 Edwards's coral I in us. 

It is abundant on the reefs at Loo Choo.
