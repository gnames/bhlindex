The carapax is nearly naked about the middle. It is narrowed 
 before and somewhat dilated behind. The cardiac scutella or in- 
 durated median plate of the posterior part is somewhat halberd- 
 shaped, being narrowed at the middle and a little widened toward 
 its pointed extremity. The sides of the anterior portion of the cara- 
 pax are more deeply sinuated than in most species. The rostriform 
 point of the front is elongated, and very sharp, reaching a little be- 
 yond the bases of the ophthalmic scales, and carinated along the 
 middle. Eyes very long and slender, slightly longer than the front, 
 and not quite reaching to the extremity of the peduncle of the anten- 
 nulae ; peduncle naked, excepting a slight tuft of setae at the superior 
 base. Apex of the ophthalmic scale short, acute, with one denticle 
 on the outer margin. The outer maxillipeds are long, reaching be- 
 yond the eyes. Chelipeds equal, resembling much those of P. hirtus, 
 turgidus, etc., in character, the carpus and hand being spinous and 
 hairy above, the spines rather numerous, with black corneous tips ; 
 hand rather broad and flattened above, with immovable finger de- 
 pressed; inner edges of the fingers corneous for the terminal half of 
 their length ; dactylus angular, with the outer surface flat, elegantly 
 and minutely sculptured with oblique pectiniform crests about seven 
 in number. Posterior feet hairy ; those of the second pair spinous 
 above, with the dactylus more than one-half longer than the preced- 
 ing joint. The dorsal integument of the male abdomen is consider- 
 ably indurated, forming a thin, flexible plate to each segment ; pos- 
 terior angle of that covering the second segment much projecting 
 and overlapping the third. Lobes of the terminal segment almost 
 symmetrical in both male and female. The callous areolae forming 
 the "chafing gear" on the inferior surfaces of the thorax and feet are
