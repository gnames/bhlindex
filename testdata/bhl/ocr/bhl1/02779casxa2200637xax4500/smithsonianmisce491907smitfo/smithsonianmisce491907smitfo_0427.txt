less well marked tiian in F. fnrgidns. The color of the animal, in 
 alcoholic specimens, is light brick-red ; in parts whitish ; eye pedun- 
 cles with a red vitta. Length, three inches ; length of carapax in the 
 male, 0.81 ; breadth of the front, 0.4; length of cheliped, 1.17 inches. 
 Foimd at Hakodadi, on the island of Jesso. It much resembles 
 P. tnrgidus from the opposite coast of the Pacific, from which it 
 may be distinguished by the sculptured surface of the movable finger 
 of the hand.

The carapax, front, eye-peduncles, and antenna? in this species 
 are naked, or nearly so. Anterior region of the carapax rather 
 large, much longer than the posterior, with a punctate surface, and 
 armed with a few minute spines at the sides. Median plate or car- 
 diac scutella of the posterior region rather short, somewhat con- 
 tracted near the base, and blunt at the posterior extremity. Ros- 
 trum long and slender, tapering, with its very sharp extremity curv- 
 ing downward and reaching beyond the middle of the ophthalmic 
 scales. Frontal sinuses very deep for the reception of the bases of 
 the e}e peduncles. Eyes very stout for the genus, but long, con- 
 siderably longer than the front is wide, and much overreaching the 
 peduncle of the antennula. Apex of the ophthalmic scale slender, 
 very sharp, curving outward; margins entire, smooth, and naked. 
 Antennae shorter than the carapax ; flagellum sparsely provided with 
 fine, short hairs ; acicle large and nearly naked, reaching to middle 
 of eye-peduncles. Outer maxillipeds not reaching to the extremities 
 of the eyes. Chelipeds similar in form, but unequal (the left 
 larger) ; carpus and hand densely hairy and spinulose, spines small, 
 calcareous, those of the superior edge largest ; fingers naked above, 
 but hairy exteriorly, and armed within with sharp cutting edges for 
 their whole length ; apices acute, black ; inferior side of hand tumid, 
 minutely and sparsely subspinulose. Ambulatory feet rather slen- 
 der ; penult and antepenult joints spinous above; dactyli above and 
 on the lower inner edge hairy. Fourth pair of feet rather long, with 
 the scabrous surface on the penult joint very small. No chafing 
 disks or areolae on the lower surface of the body or feet. Terminal 
 segment of abdomen much elongated; left lobe most produced. 
 Color olive or brownish; antennae annulated ; maxillipeds spotted 
 with white; tips of all the feet white. Length, 1.78; length of cara-
