CRUSTACEA NORTH PACIFIC EXPLORING EXPEDITION 215 

latory feet. Fingers of the hands slender, with acute margins 
 microscopically pectinated with short setse ; margin of immovable 
 finger also armed with eight minute distant teeth; that of movable 
 finger smooth. Dactyli of the ambulatory feet very long and com- 
 pressed, adapted for swimming. The animal is of a pale fawn color 
 when alive ; sometimes slightly reddish. 

This species swims freely, even carrying its shell, by striking the 
 water with its ciliated feet. Our specimens were taken from a 
 muddy bottom in sixteen fathoms ofif the Chinese coast near Hong- 
 kong. 

Genus EUPAGURUS Brandt (emended) 

In this genus and Spiropagunis we find a character of the external 
 maxillipeds which seems to be of considerable importance, although 
 overlooked by those who have previously written upon the family of 
 Paguridse. In all other genera these maxillipeds are closely approx- 
 imated at the base, the coxse being greatly dilated, with their inner 
 surfaces closely applied to each other. In the present genus the 
 coxse are small, very short, and no larger than the second or basis- 
 joint of the maxilliped, being at the same time widely removed from 
 each other, showing between the prominent margin of the second 
 sternal segment, which is often armed with teeth or spiniform pro- 
 cesses. The exognath of the maxillipeds is broader than in the ordi- 
 nary forms of Paguridce. 

Other characters of Enpagunts are the following: Front acute at 
 the middle. Ophthalmic ring exposed, but without a bracteole or 
 indurated plate between the bases of the eyes. Aciculum of the 
 antennae elongated, slender even from the base ; flagellum long. Ex- 
 ternal maxillipeds rather large. Chelipeds dissimilar in form and 
 unequal, the right largest; commissure of the hand horizontal, with 
 the hinges marginal ; fingers moving in a horizontal plane. Fourth 
 pair of feet scarcely subcheliform. 

This genus inhabits the temperate and frigid zones of both hemi- 
 spheres. A large number of species is found, both in the North 
 Atlantic and the Xorth Pacific Oceans. In two or three rare in- 
 stances species occur in the subtropical parts of the Atlantic. The 
 following is a list of the species already known :
