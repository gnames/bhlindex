left hand; from E. bcniliardus in the shorter eyes, the more elon- 
 gated and slender feet, and the smoother, flattened hand with lamelli- 
 form outer edge. 

It was dredged off the east coast of Xiphon, in north latitude 
 about T,8° , at the depth of thirty fathoms. Found also in Hakodadi 
 Bay.

The acicle of the outer antennre in this species is remarkable for 
 its trigonal form and its naked, glossy, iridescent surfaces. The 
 dactyli of the ambulatory feet are long, naked, and as much twisted 
 as in £. bcnihardiis. 

We found two adult specimens in Hakodadi Bay, the largest over 
 four inches in length. The original specimen of Dana's B. annatus 
 differs from ours in one point only — the greater hand is more elon- 
 gated and more rounded at its extremity. This, however, is prob- 
 abl}" nothing more than a mark of immaturity or variety, as other 
 species are often variable in the proportions of the carpus and hand, 
 so that this may be regarded as one of the species common to both 
 sides of the Xorth Pacific Ocean.

Body broad and thick ; abdomen rather small ; sterntim somewhat 
 narrower than in E. hcrnhardns. Anterior part of the carapax con-
