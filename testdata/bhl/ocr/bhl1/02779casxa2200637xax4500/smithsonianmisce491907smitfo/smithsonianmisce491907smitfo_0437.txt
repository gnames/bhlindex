CRUSTACEA NORTH PACIFIC EXPLORING EXPEDITION 219 

peduncle of the anteniKe ; peduncles rather stout; cornea scarcely 
 dilated. Acicle long, hairy, and reaching beyond the eyes. On the 
 margin of the second sternal segment, between the bases of the outer 
 maxillipeds, there are two sharp teeth or spines. The right cheliped 
 is very large, reaching much beyond the extremities of the ambu- 
 latory feet; ischium-joint with a long, sharp spine at the inner apex; 
 carpus a little longer than broad at its anterior extremity and some- 
 what longer than the palm of the hand ; hand flattened above ; fingers 
 shorter than the palm and ornamented above, along their inner mar- 
 gins, with a closely set series of tufts of setae directed inward. There 
 is a deep notch in the outline of the hand at the outer base of the 
 dactylus. The left cheliped is about one-half as wide as the right, 
 and reaches beyond the base of the right dactylus. In the armature 
 of the surface the chelipeds are much alike ; the surface of the 
 meros-joint is unarmed, but sparsely clothed with short series of 
 hairs arising from slight transverse squamiform ridges ; the anterior 
 margin of the meros is armed above with comb-like teeth, three in 
 the left, six in the right cheliped ; carpus and hand spinous and 
 densely covered with pubescence arising to the tips of the spines. 
 These spines cover the whole upper surface of the carpus ; they are 
 strong, sharp, about 1/15 inch in length in adult specimens. On the 
 right hand they form a median and two marginal rows ; on the left 
 hand one median row continued on the immovable finger, one row 
 on the outer margin, and a few scattered at the inner base. Between 
 the spines there are small setiferous tubercles. 

The ambulatory feet are slender, sparsely hairy in transverse 
 fascicles, and armed with one or two spines on the superior edge of 
 the carpus ; dactyli long and slender, longer than the penult joint, 
 not twisted, and sparsely armed with short, stifl:' hairs ; terminal un- 
 guiculi very short. Dactylus of the right ambulatory foot of the 
 first pair longer than the carpus of the right cheliped. Feet of the 
 fourth pair very broad, compressed, long-ciliated above ; dactylus 
 very short, scarcely overreaching the tip of the process of the penult 
 joint or hand. Color orange, minutely mottled on the body ; feet 
 barred above with dark red. Length, about 3.6 ; length of carapax. 
 0.8; breadth of front (between bases of outer antennae). 0.4: length 
 of great cheliped. 2.3 inches. 

This species, contrary to the usual practice among hermit crabs, 
 never leaves the habitation (a small shell) it has first selected. In 
 the enlargement of its domicile (carcina-cium ) to suit its own 
 growth, it is assisted by a little architect, a hydroid polyp (Hydrac- 
 tinia sodalis Stm.). about half an inch in length, which in consider-
