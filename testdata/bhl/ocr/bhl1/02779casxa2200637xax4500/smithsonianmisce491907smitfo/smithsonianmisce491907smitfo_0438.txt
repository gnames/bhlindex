able numbers molds its corneous base over the body of the crab, re- 
 ceiving for its reward and sustenance the fragments which float off 
 at the banquet of its voracious companion, as well as free transporta- 
 tion along the sea bottom. The shell thus formed is spiral, with de- 
 pressed whorls, laxly convoluted and resembling somewhat a Del- 
 phinula, and often about an inch and a half in length. It is exter- 
 nally muricated with stout processes from one-tenth to one-half an 
 inch in height, one-twentieth in thickness, and more or less branched 
 at the top. Embedded in its apex we find the minute shell, seldom 
 over one-third of an inch in length, which served the hermit for a 
 cell when young. 

The same thing was observed by J. E. Gray (see Zoologist, i, 
 204) to occur sometimes with the common Bnpagurus bcrnliardns : 
 and on our own coast shells inhabited by Pagiiri are often seen leav- 
 ing the margin at the mouth, continued out to some extent by the 
 addition of the crustaceous or coriaceous polypidom of Hydrac- 
 tiiiicr. With Eiip. coiistaiis, however, this is a constant character- 
 istic, and to such an extent that the entire shell seems to be composed 
 of the adventitious substance. 

Several specimens of this curious species were dredged from a 
 rocky bottom in four fathoms in Hakodadi Bay, Northern Japan.

On the anterior part of the carapax there are two series of fas- 
 cicles of hair, as in E. coiistaiis, enclosing an oval naked space at the 
 middle ; also two or three scattering tufts outside of this space pos- 
 teriorly. On the posterior part there are some tufts on the median 
 and postero-lateral surfaces. Rostriform point small but very acute, 
 and not much projecting. Lateral points, or teeth of front acu- 
 minated, their tips spiniform, directed a little outward, and project- 
 ing nearly as far forward as the rostrum. Eyes long and slender, 
 reaching to the tips of the peduncles of the antennse and overreach- 
 ing the hairy acicle ; cornea not dilated. Ophthalmic scales with 
 slender acuminate apex. Flagellum of antennae reaching beyond 
 the tips of the chelipeds ; joints minute, setose. Chelipeds consider- 
 ably shorter than the ambulatory feet ; meros with smooth or slightly 
 squamous surface, and with its anterior margin armed above with 
 2â€”4 parallel spines like the teeth of a comb ; carpus and hand spinous
