and hairy, the spines long, erect, subequal, and acute, the hair fine, 
 long, and clean, two or three times as long as the spines. Carpus of 
 the right cheliped not longer than broad, but slightly longer than the 
 palm of the hand ; its postero-exterior slope smooth ; its antero- 
 interior corner spinous ; hand slightly convex, regularly covered with 
 spines arranged in eight longitudinal series, those of the outer mar- 
 gin longer, pectiniform, curving upward; fingers depressed, shorter 
 than the palm, and with acuminate corneous tips; spines on outer 
 margin of dactylus long and pectiniform. In the left cheliped the 
 carpus has two longitudinal rows of spines above, separated by a 
 smooth, flattened space ; hand convex, spinous, with the median 
 spines longest; fingers nearly devoid of spines. Ambulatory feet 
 stout, overreaching the chelipeds; last three joints broad, long- 
 ciliated above; dactyli compressed, very broad, not contorted, with 
 the sides longitudinally grooved, the upper edge and inner side 
 hairy, and the inferior margin armed with a series of ten black 
 corneous spines ; unguicle or tip stout and sharp, black. Dactylus 
 of fourth pair of feet large, reaching much beyond the hand-process, 
 and with a sharp, curved, black unguiculus. Length of the animal, 
 three inches ; length of carapax, 0.7 ; breadth of front, 0.34 ; length 
 of greater cheliped, 1.42 inch. 

It has nuich general resemblance to B. constaiis, but is easily dis- 
 tinguished by its shorter chelipeds, broader hairy dactyli of the am- 
 bulatory feet, and much larger dactylus of the fourth pair of feet. 

Found at Hakodadi, Japan.

This is a large species, allied to B. pubescens, but having more 
 strongly marked characters. The characters mentioned in the fol- 
 lowing description are those in which it is observed to differ from 
 that species. 

The body and feet are more or less hirsute, in some individuals 
 densely so, in others very little so, with the chehpeds nearly naked. 
 The chelipeds are granulated ; granules on carpus spiniform. Right 
 hand less than twice as long as broad. Right carpus very thick and 
 broad, broader than the hand, and shorter than in B. pubescens.
