222 SMITHSONIAN MISCELLANEOUS COLLECTIONS 

Fingers of the right hand stout, with corneous tips. Left hand 
 large, three-fourths as large as the right, broadly trigonal ; carina 
 very prominent, denticulated, and situated far to the right of the 
 middle ; oblique exterior surface of the hand broadly expanded, con- 
 cave, and much dilated at the extero-inferior margin. Ambulatory 
 feet of the right side overreaching the right cheliped. Color red- 
 dish ; feet orange, inclining to clay color, transversely barred with 
 darker. Eggs of the female black. Length about four inches. 

This species is common in the Behring Sea. Found at low-water 
 mark on gravel and in ten fathoms, mud bottom, in Seniavine 
 Straits ; in twenty fathoms, shelly bottom, in the Arctic Ocean north 
 of Behring Straits : also in Awatska Bay.

Among our boreal and arctic Crustacea we find two closely allied 
 species confounded under the name of Pagurus puhcsccus. Kroyer's 
 description in the Tidsskrift applies almost equally well to both. Nor 
 does his figure in the 'A'oyage en Skandinavie. en Lapponie," etc. 
 (Crust., pi. II, fig. I), appear to be an accurate representation of 
 either species. 

The following is a short special description of the form to which 
 we would hereafter restrict the name puhcsccus, as it is by far the 
 most hairy of the two in thus agreeing with the Tidsskrift descrip- 
 tion ("pilis flavis dense obsitis"). although not with the figure above 
 quoted. 

Body and feet thickly hirsute with long hair. Chelipeds spinu- 
 lose, spinules rather large and sharply prominent. Right carpus 
 elongated, scarcely broader than the hand. Right hand generally 
 twice as long as broad, but varying much in its proportions ; dactylus 
 with corneous tip. Left hand small, not dilated extero-inferiorly ; 
 carina median, little prominent, obtuse, and armed with two rows of 
 spinules. Ambulatory feet of the right side in the adult falling short 
 of the extremity of the right hand. Dactyli of the ambulatory feet 
 much curved, and, as in all the species of this group, a little con- 
 torted, with the outer side longitudinally grooved. Color usually 
 reddish, with orange abdomen. Carapax pale red. Hands deep red ;
