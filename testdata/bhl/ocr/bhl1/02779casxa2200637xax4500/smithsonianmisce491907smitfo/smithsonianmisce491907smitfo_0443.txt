tips of fingers paler. Ambulatory feet red, with three or four broad, 
 bluish-white transverse bars. Length usually about two or three 
 inches.

Rostriform point of the front setose. Feet very hairv. Right 
 â€¢cheliped spinulose above ; carpus with a smooth, shallow longi- 
 tudinal groove near the inner margin, which is spinous ; hand elon- 
 gated, tapering, sparsely but regularly covered with spiniform tuber- 
 cles. Left cheliped spinulose above ; carpus distinctly grooved ; fin- 
 gers of the hand twice as long as the palm, and broadly gaping. 
 Ambulatory feet longitudinally vittate with red ; dactyli a little 
 shorter than the penult joint. Length, one inch.

This species was first described b\- Dana from specimens taken on 
 the west coast of North America. We add below remarks upon some 
 points which become necessary to distinguish it from allied species 
 herein described. 

It is a variable species, usually very hairy, particularly on the am- 
 bulatory feet : the chelipeds are often almost naked. It also varies 
 somewhat in the proportions of the carpus and hand in the right
