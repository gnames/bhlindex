die in the greater and on the angular prominence to the left in the 
 smaller cheliped. There is sometimes another tubercle by the side 
 of the first in the greater cheliped. The larger hand is broad and 
 somewhat depressed, with the outer margin arcuated, acute, and 
 denticulated ; its surface is evenly covered with small, equal, sharply 
 prominent but obtuse granules ; fingers generally with corneous tips 
 pretty distinct ; dactylus with a series of larger granules above par- 
 allel to its outer margin. The smaller cheliped is like that of E. 
 hirsutiusculus, but is almost trigonal, with a less distinct longi- 
 tudinal groove ; carpus spinous above ; fingers not twice as long as 
 palm, and not gaping. The ambulatory feet are long, those of the 
 right side overreaching the tip of the right hand ; dactyli stout, and 
 somewhat shorter than the penult joint. Colors : Carapax red. with 
 a median and two or three lateral bluish stripes. The colors on the 
 feet are arranged by rings or bars, instead of vittse; in alcoholic 
 specimens these are blue and red ; fingers of chelipeds bluish. Length 
 usually one inch ; length of anterior region of carapax, 0.25 ; breadth, 
 0.21 inch. 

Found at Kagosima, Simoda, and Hakodadi, in Japan, as well as 
 on the coast of California.

The body in this species is narrow, as in some Clihanarii. Feet, 
 with the exception of the right cheliped, moderately pilose, with 
 long, fine hair. Rostriform point short and broad, but acute. Eyes 
 rather long, reaching nearly to the extremities of the peduncles of 
 the antennae ; cornea very little dilated. Ophthalmic scales with 
 acuminate apex. Acicle small and short, falling much short of the 
 extremities of the eyes. Flagellum of the antennas long, naked, 
 reaching far beyond the tips of the walking feet. Great cheliped 
 much elongated, reaching a little beyond the ambulatory feet, naked 
 except at the base, and everywhere covered above with minute equal 
 spiniform granules ; carpus two-thirds as broad as long, and three- 
 fourths as long as the hand, including the fingers ; hand convex, a 
 little broader than the carpus, and tapering toward the fingers ; fin- 
 gers small, hardly more than one-half as long as the palm ; tips cal- 
 careous; dactylus with a granulated longitudinal groove along the 
 back, separating two rows of somewhat larger granules. Beneath
