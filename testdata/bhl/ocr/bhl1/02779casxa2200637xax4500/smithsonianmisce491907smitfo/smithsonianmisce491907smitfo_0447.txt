CRUSTACEA NORTH PACIFIC EXPLORING EXPEDITION 227 

nels bounding it laterally are, as usual, occupied with fascicles of 
 hair, largest anteriorly. Eyes more than half as long as the front is 
 wide ; cornea a little dilated. Apical portion of the ophthalmic scale 
 oblong, constricted at the base, but not acuminated at the extremity, 
 and marked above by a median longitudinal impressed line occupied 
 by short setse. Acicle of the antennse long, overreaching the eyes, 
 and thickly clothed with tufts of hairs on its upper or inner edge; 
 flagellum short, setose at the joints. Exognath of the outer maxil- 
 lipeds broad. 

The chelipeds, both right and left, are large and much longer than 
 the contiguous ambulatory feet. Right cheliped densely clothed 
 above with soft and rather short hair ; meros smooth above and un- 
 armed at the superior margin, but beneath very much dilated and 
 hairy, with the right margin pectinated, the left most expanded and 
 ciliated with long hairs ; upper surface of carpus and hand covered 
 with small scabriform granules, from the bases of which the hairs 
 arise ; carpus as long as the palm of the hand, armed with several 
 small purple spines at the inner margin and near the antero-interior 
 corner, and marked along the middle with a smooth groove; hand 
 large, a little more than twice as long as broad ; palm with a row of 
 minute spines down the middle ; exterior margin of immovable finger 
 denticulated with spiniform teeth ; dorsal carina of dactylus armed 
 w^ith a series of twelve bluish teeth. The left cheliped is also scab- 
 rous and hairy ; meros and carpus almost or quite equal to those of 
 the right cheliped in length, but much narrower and more com- 
 pressed ; lower outer margins of meros and carpus and upper margin 
 of carpus spinous ; hand somewdiat tetragonal, carinated at the mid- 
 dle above, and at the outer margin; upper carina spinous. Ambu- 
 latory feet short and stout, thickly hairy above, but not spinulose ; 
 dactyli broad, not contorted, and shorter than the penult joint; un- 
 gues very large and strong. Color inclining to orange or minutely 
 mottled with red and yellow; ambulatory feet broadly annulated 
 with deeper red. Length of the animal, about 3.2 ; length of cara- 
 pax, 0.83 : breadth of front, 0.38 ; length of greater cheliped. 2.08 
 inches. 

It somewhat resembles the Pagnnis laiiugiiiosus of De Haan. in 
 which species, however, the ambulatory feet overreach the chelipeds 
 and "manu pedum secundorum tarsis parum breviore.'' In our 
 species the hand, even the left hand, is longer than the longest 
 "tarsus." 

Our specimens were found at Simoda.
