ably developed. Feet naked or nearly so. Chelipeds shorter than 
 the ambulatory feet; the right one but little larger than the left; 
 hand in both with three sharp, denticulated longitudinal keels or 
 crests, two marginal, and one median one continued on the immova- 
 ble finger; carpus slightly pilose, flattened or obsoletely grooved 
 above, with two slight crenated keels. Ambulatory feet very slen- 
 der, naked ; dactyli not contorted, and much longer than the penult 
 joint. Colors: Body dark brownish in front, paler posteriorly; feet 
 transversely banded with reddish and olive; chelipeds white. Gen- 
 eral length of the animal, half an inch; length of the carapax, o.ii ; 
 breadth of the front, 0.07; length of the right cheliped. 0.17 inch.

 [89], 1858. 

Of this species we have only a small female specimen, perhaps 
 young. The rostriform tooth is obsolete. The ophthalmic ring is 
 shielded above by a bifurcated bracteole. The eyes are slender, and 
 overreach the peduncles of the antennae, equaling in length the 
 breadth of the front, and curving outward ; cornea not dilated ; 
 ophthalmic scales small, bidentate or bifurcated; teeth or forks spini- 
 form. Flagellum of antennae shorter than the feet. Acicle very 
 small. Feet slender, sparsely hirsute with long hairs. Chelipeds 
 slender, but much shorter than the ambulatory feet, and spinulose 
 above ; the right one largest ; carpus somewhat grooved above ; hands 
 a little depressed, and armed with a median and two marginal rows 
 of spines ; spines of the left cheliped longest. Dactyli of the ambu- 
 latory feet not contorted, but compressed, almost falciform; un- 
 guicles slender. Fourth pair of feet not didactyle ; penult joint ex- 
 panded. On the right side of the abdomen near its base there is a 
 conical process, the skin of which at its apex is somewhat indurated 
 or corneous. Length of the animal, about one inch ; length of cara- 
 pax, 0.21 ; breadth of front, 0.12 ; length of eye, 0.12 ; length of right 
 cheliped, 0.35 ; of the right ambulatory foot, 0.53 inch. 

This species, as will be seen from the description, presents some 
 peculiarities which may require its subsequent removal from the 
 genus Bupagurus, although it has most of the more essential charac- 
 ters of that genus â€” the remoteness of the external maxillipeds, etc. 
 It is desirable that the male should be examined. 

Dredged in eight fathoms, mud, in Port Jackson, Australia.
