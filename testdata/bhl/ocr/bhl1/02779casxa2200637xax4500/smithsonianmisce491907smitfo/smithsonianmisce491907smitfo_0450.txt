Genus GAI.ATHEA Fabricius 

In the male of this genus the genital organs of the fifth coxcC are 
 not exserted. The segments of the abdomen are all provided with 
 appendages ; those of the first two pairs are copulative, and those of 
 the next four pairs are of small size, simple and flattened. 

This genus is found in all seas of the old world. It is remarkable 
 that no species is found in the American w^aters except those of the 
 frigid zones, although it is represented on the west coast by the genus 
 Pleuronchodcs. The following is a list of species known besides 
 those herein described :
