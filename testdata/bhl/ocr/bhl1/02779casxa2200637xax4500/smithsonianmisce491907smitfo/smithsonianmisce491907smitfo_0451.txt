Carapax rather short, narrowing anteriorly ; surface strigose and 
 much pubescent ; gastric region not distinctly circumscribed, and 
 armed with two little spines anteriorly ; lateral margin armed with 
 eight minute spines, including two at insertion of antenna. Ros- 
 trum long, triangular, acute, and armed on each side with four 
 small, very slender teeth, including that situated above the eye. No 
 other tooth on the supraorbital margin. Outer angle of orbit acute, 
 Chelipeds rather stout ; upper surface uniformly roughened with 
 short spines and seta; ; margins armed with a few spines, of which 
 there are two short and one long one near the inner apex of the meros, 
 and one long one at that of the carpus ; hand with a thick palm, but 
 very slender fingers, which together are much narrower than the 
 palm, straight, and not toothed. Ambulatory feet spinulose and 
 verv sparsely hairy; meros-joint sufficiently broad, and provided on 
 superior margin with about ten weak spines ; lower margin of dac- 
 tylus armed with four small teeth, each bearing one movable spinule. 
 Colors : Carapax dark red, margined with white : abdomen varie- 
 gated with reddish aiul yellowish, with a white median spot on each

 tinctly defined and two-spined in front, spines minute ; lateral margin 
 armed with six teeth or spines, including that above the insertion of 
 the antenna, but not the small inferior one. Rostrum large, sub- 
 triangular, and rather broad ; surface naked ; sides somewhat convex 
 and each armed with three acute equal teeth and one much smaller 
 one at the base. Eyes large. The tooth forming the external angle 
 of the orbit is mintite, sharp, and placed rather within than an-
