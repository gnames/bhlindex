232 SMITHSONIAN MISCELLANEOUS COLLECTIONS 

teriorly to the prominent first lateral tooth. Chelipeds long, spinu- 
 lose, and sparsely provided with long hairs ; marginal spines longest ; 
 carpus with one strong spine on the inner side and a smaller one 
 behind it; hand rather depressed, uniformly roughened above with 
 asperities or short, broad spinules ; fingers scarcely gaping ; two low 
 teeth on the inner margin of the dactylus and one on that of the im- 
 movable finger corresponding to the interspace between them. 
 Meros- joint of the ambulatory feet rather narrow, with its superior 
 margin armed with equal, closely arranged spinules ; dactylus with 
 a short supplementary unguiform tooth on the inner margin above 
 the true unguiculus. Dimensions : Length of carapax, 0.26 ; breadth, 
 0.19; length of rostrum, 0.09; of chelipeds, 0.6 inch. 

Females have more slender chelipeds, armed with longer spines, 
 and with the fingers scarcely toothed within. 

The species is of a bright red color, with a median white stripe 
 on the back. Feet pale orange. 

It dififers from G. viticnsis in its larger rostrum, the non-circum- 
 scribed gastric area, and the sharper external orbital angle ; from G. 
 latirostris in its rostrum, which is longer, not subovate, and more 
 acutely toothed ; from G. spitiosirostris in its longer chelipeds, with 
 fewer spines on the inner side of the carpus. 

Dredged from a shelly bottom in twenty-five fathoms in Ly-i- 
 moon Passage, near Hongkong, China. 

Specimens probably of this species were obtained in the China 
 Sea, also at Ousima and in Kagosima Bay, which differ somewhat 
 from the above, the males having a somewhat longer and more 
 tapering carapax, with the gastric region better circumscribed ; the 
 chelipeds longer and often with gaping fingers, bearing a sharply 
 prominent tooth on the dactylus and none on the immovable finger. 
 This form appears to be connected with the type by intermediate 
 gradations, but if distinct might be named G. longiuiana.

Galathca acanthomera Stimpson, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., x, p. 252 
 [90], 1858. 

This species resembles G. oricntaUs in the shape and armature of 
 the carapax and rostrum, except that the basal teeth of the rostrum 
 are larger. The chelipeds in our only specimen are wanting. The 
 ambulatory feet resemble those of G. spinosirostris. They are stout 
 and fringed above with plumose hairs ; the meros-joint is broad, with 
 eleven stout spines on the superior edge, with the outer surface 
 deeply marked with pubescent strigge, and with a spine at the in- 
 ferior extremity : the carpus is four-spined above, and the dactylus
