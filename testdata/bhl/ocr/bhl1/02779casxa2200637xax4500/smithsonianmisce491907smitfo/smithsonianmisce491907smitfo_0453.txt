is less than half as long as the penult joint, and armed below with a 
 minute supplementary unguiculus. The upper surface of the abdo- 
 men is sparsely clothed with long hairs. Color grayish. Length of 
 carapax, 0.22; breadth, 0.18; length of rostrum, 0.07 inch. 

It differs from G. spinosirostris in its longer rostrum and in the

Carapax regularly or evenly convex, not much narrowed before; 
 surface deeply strigose and conspicuously pubescent, the hairs or 
 cilis of each ridge being nearly long enough to reach the next ridge. 
 Gastric region not well defined, and armed near the middle anteriorly 
 with three small spines, the median one situated a little behind the 
 other two. Lateral margins armed as in G. oricntalis. Rostrum 
 large, acutely triangular, densely pubescent above, and 4-toothed on 
 each margin ; teeth very sharp, and raking forward. There is some- 
 times a supplementary tooth between the basal tooth and the second. 
 Chelipeds linear, very slender, sparsely setose and spinulose, but 
 with spines smaller and less numerous than in G. oricntalis. Some- 
 times there is. however, a strong spine on the carpus. Fingers of 
 the hand flattened, parallel, not at all gaping, and not as long as the 
 palm. Ambulatory feet of moderate length ; superior edge of meros- 
 joint armed with seven or eight very slender subdistant spinules ; 
 dactylus about half as long as the penult joint. Abdomen pubescent. 
 Color reddish, sometimes with darker mottlings, and a median dor- 
 sal white stripe. In one specimen the length of the carapax was 
 0.22; breadth, 0.16 inch. In another, a female, length of carapax, 
 0.22; breadth, 0.13; length of rostrum, 0.08; length of chelipeds, 
 0.4 inch. 

It was dredged from a sandy bottom in thirty-three fathoms on 
 the east coast of Ousima; also in twenty-five fathoms, coarse sand 
 and shells, off the headland of Hakodadi, Island of Jesso, Japan.
