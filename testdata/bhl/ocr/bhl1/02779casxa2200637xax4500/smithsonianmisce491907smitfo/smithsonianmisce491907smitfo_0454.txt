secondarv ones being obsolete; but they are very (lee])l\ cut, espe- 
 cially at the middle of the carapax. On the gastric region and at 
 the sides these strigae are undulated, and sometimes partially inter- 
 rupted, so as to resemble broad scales. Their edges are scarcely 
 pubescent, and there are only a few scattered setae on the surface. 
 The gastric and hepatic regions are not very distinctl\- circum- 
 scribed. On the front and sides of the gastric region there are eight 
 or ten small spinules scattered. Lateral margin seven-toothed, ex- 
 cluding the angle of the orbit, which is situated far inward, as in 
 (/. oriciitalis. Rostrum exactly triangular in shape, of the usual 
 breadth, and armed with four very sharp and deepl\' cut teeth on 
 each side. Spines on the base of the antennulae very long, reaching 
 almost to the tip of the rostrum. Chelipeds of moderate size, armed 
 with small subequal spines regularly distributed ; cari)us and meros 
 with two or three longer spines within ; hand more slender than car- 
 ])us ; fingers parallel, depressed, not gaping, and not toothed. Jn the 
 ambulatory feet the meros is slender, and ten-spined above; dact\ius 
 with a short, stout tooth on the inner or lower margin. Length of 
 carapax in a male. 0.26; breadth. 0.16; length of rostrum, 0.1 : of 
 chelipeds. 0.56 inch.

Calatlica gnuulirnstris Stimpson, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., x, ]), 232 
 [90]. 1858. 

Carapax evenly convex; strigose ; strigae about twelve in numljer 
 between the base of the rostrum and the posterior margin, and cil- 
 iated with short hairs, eciualing in length one-third the distance Ix-- 
 tween the ridges. Some of the strigae are interrupted, and that 
 which crosses the posterior part of the gastric region is undulated. 
 Gastric region not circumscribed. Lateral margin nine-toothed. 
 Rostrum greatly elongated ; surface roughened and pubescent ; mar- 
 gins each serrated with about six small distant teeth almost obsolete. 
 Chelipeds stout, roughened with transverse scabrosities and short 
 setose ; two or three spines at the inner apex of the meros and of the 
 carpus ; no spines on the hand ; fingers moderately pilose and not 
 gaping. The surface of the ambulatory feet is ornamented with 
 transverse ciliated striae, about six in number on the meros-joint. 
 Color purple-brown, very dark ; carapax and abdomen above with 
 two longitudinal yellowish-white vittrc ; chelipeds with one median 
 stripe : ambulatory feet transversely barred. Length of carapax in 
 a male (rostrum included), 0.342; breadth, 0.19; length of rostrum.
