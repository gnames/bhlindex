CRUSTACKA NORTH PACIFIC EXPLORING EXPEDITION 235 

0.16; breadth of rostrum at base, o.o5 ; length of cheHpeds, 0.53 inch. 

With G. loiigii'ostris Dana and G. elegans White it forms a group 
 which will perhaps be found to have a generic value, and be sepa- 
 rated from Galafhea proper. From these two species ours differs in 
 its larger rostrum and in other characters. 

It was dredged from a black sand bottom at five fathoms depth 
 in Kagosima Bay, Japan.

Dift'ers from Galathca in the character of its front, which is armed 
 with three spines, the median longest. The species of Munida are 
 all very closely allied to each other. They are found in both tem- 
 perate zones and in both oceans. Only three species are known, 
 M. baiuffia White, .1/. siibnigosa Dana, and the following.

 1858. 

The carapax is oblong. The lateral margin is armed near the 
 middle with five spinules. and the spines above and behind the base 
 of the antenna are no larger than these lateral spinules. There is a 
 pencil of brilliant set^e on the margin beneath the sinus of the trans- 
 verse suture, and a few such pencils on the sides of the abdomen. 
 Frontal spines needle-shaped, the lateral ones nearly half as long as 
 the middle one. There is a series of thirteen spinules extending 
 across the front part of the gastric region, of which two, one on 
 each side of the middle, are larger than the others. On each side of 
 the gastric region there are three spines on the surface, about half 
 way from the lateral margin to the median line. Chelipeds very 
 long, straight, subcylindrical, scabrous, with a few scattered spin- 
 ules ; fingers long, very slender, and straight, those of the left hand 
 gaping at the base. Antennae a little longer than the chelipeds. 
 Color a rather dark red, mottled with light red and white. The feet 
 show a tendency to annulation. This description is drawn up from 
 a male specimen, the dimensions of which are: Length of carapax, 
 0.48; breadth, 0.28; length of median frontal spine, or rostrum, 0.18; 
 length of chelipeds. 1.3 inches. 

Dredged from a shell}' bottom in twenty fathoms in Kagosima 
 Bay. Japan.
