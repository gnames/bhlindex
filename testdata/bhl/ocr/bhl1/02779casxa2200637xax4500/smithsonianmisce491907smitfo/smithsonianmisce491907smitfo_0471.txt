INTRODUCTORY REMARKS. 

Thk Chief Justice;: The fame of men who have achieved emi- 
 nence in science and in kindred activities, as well as in administra- 
 tion, is a common heritage, and those who are not experts in the 
 particular art are as much entitled to bear witness to their apprecia- 
 tion of that fame as the experts themselves or the rare individuals 
 who may be said to have taken knowledge for their province. 
 We proceed tonight to pay due tribute to our dear friend, Doctor 
 Langley, and to his distinguished scientific labors in general and 
 especially as Secretary of this Institution. 

It gives me great pleasure to introduce to you Doctor Andrew D. 
 White, whose illustrious career as diplomatist, publicist, university 
 president, and author is too widely known to justify more than a 
 mere allusion.
