10 SMITHSONIAN MISCELI.ANKOUS COLI^ECTIONS. 

professorship of astronomy and physics at the Western University 
 of Pennsylvania, at Pittsburg, with the directorship of the Allegheny 
 Observatory — a position which he held for twenty years. 

Arriving at Pittsburg, he was confronted by obstacles which to 
 a man not trained as he had been would have probably proved in- 
 surmountable. He found there, for his work, an equatorial tel- 
 escope of good size, used by an amateur club mainly for simple star- 
 gazing, but not equipped for scientific work ; and beside this virtually 
 nothing — no transit instrument, not even a clock. 

There was little chance for him to be helped over these obstacles 
 by private munificence. Since that time there has appeared a galaxy 
 of millionaires who have endowed Pittsburg with great foundations 
 in science, literature, and art, one of whom, indeed, has created 
 institutions which have aroused amazement and gratitude on both 
 sides the Atlantic; but at the young astronomer's arrival none of 
 these leaders had appeared. He had at once to meet the question 
 how to acquire, mainly by his own skill and toil, the instruments 
 necessary to make the observatory useful. 

His insight and foresight gave a speedy answer. He saw quickly 
 that a pressing need of the great lines of railway connecting with 
 Pittsburg, east and west, was a better standard of time. This had 
 been already seen at other American centers, notably at Washing- 
 ton, at Cambridge, at Albany, and elsewhere ; but it was only when 
 Langley at Pittsburg grasped the subject, both in its scientific and 
 business bearings, that there came a plan to meet American condi- 
 tions — useful, practicable, and widely extended. To him more than 
 to any other is primarily due the fixing of railway time standards in 
 the United States. The clock at his observatory finally gave, twice 
 a day and automatically, the exact time to every station on lines ex- 
 tending for eight thousand miles. 

He saw not merely the need of devising a system of time stand- 
 ards, but the practical methods of realizing it. He also made the 
 busy men about him see this need and grasp his methods, and from 
 them, in their own interest, he obtained the equipment of his observ- 
 atory. 

In 1869 he published his first two papers which attracted atten- 
 tion, the first being a brief report upon his observation of the total 
 eclipse at Oakland, Kentucky, and the second "A proposal for regu- 
 lating from the Allegheny Observatory the clocks of the Pennsyl- 
 vania Central and other roads connected with it." Thus came from 
 him, characteristically, a contribution to astronomy as a science and 
 the satisfaction of a public need.
