purpose ; it finally enabled him to measure differences in temperature 
 less than one-hundred-thousandth of a degree centigrade, and 
 it proved to be the precursor of instruments giving even a more 
 astonishing degree of accuracy. It was speedily applied by astron- 
 omers and physicists in wide ranges of experimental work, and in 
 Langley's hands was used from the time of its invention down to the 
 last days of his life, especially in opening up a great new field of in- 
 vestigation in connection with the invisible long wave-length rays 
 proceeding from heated bodies, and has been a main means of 
 developing a new science of these. 

The more important of his many researches published in the 
 period which now began were upon the Energy Spectrum of the 
 Sun, the Transmission of Light through the Earth's Atmosphere, 
 the Solar Constant, the Behavior of Prisms toward long Wave- 
 Lengths, the Energy Spectra of Heated Terrestrial Bodies, and the 
 Energy Spectrum of the ]Moon. Hitherto the moon's heat had been 
 recognized with difficulty, even in gross, by the thermopile ; but now, 
 by the bolometer, it was analyzed in minute detail, in a lunar heat 
 spectrum. All this suggested later a comparison of the proportion 
 of luminous and non-luminous heat in the spectrum of the sun and 
 artificial light sources and a multitude of supplementary researches. 

During the summer of 1878 he took charge of a party sent out by 
 the United States to study from Pike's Peak the total eclipse of that 
 year, and was able to follow the sun's corona to a distance from the 
 main body hitherto unsuspected ; during the winter of the same 
 year he visited Europe and followed up these observations by others 
 upon Alount Etna. 

In 1 88 1, through the generosity of citizens of Pittsburg and with 
 the cooperation of the United States Signal Service, he conducted 
 an expedition to Mount Whitney, the loftiest mountain in southern 
 California, and among the pregnant results of his observations was 
 a volume which established the present view regarding the selective 
 absorption of the sun's light by our atmosphere. These researches, 
 being presented in a brief minor paper and an extensive memoir, 
 attracted wide attention both at home and abroad. 

In 1885 he had followed the actual solar spectrum to wave- 
 lengths ten times as great as those of the visible spectrum. 

Subsidiary to these researches were those upon the optical charac- 
 teristics and possibilities of rock-salt, thus developing most usefully 
 ]\Ielloni's experiments with this substance in his epoch-making re- 
 searches nearly a hundred years before. 

The reputation thus gained by Langley came rapidly and increased 
 steadily. The thoroughness, ingenuity, and beauty of his methods
