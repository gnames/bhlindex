very important province of measuring" the heating power of the 
 sun through the enormous range of wave-lengths inchided in 
 Doctor Langley's observations, his work was unique, and that it 
 would be profoundly regretted by the scientific men of all countries 
 if anything were to occur to check its vigorous prosecution or to 
 diminish the resources of the Astrophysical Observatory of Wash- 
 ington for work of any kind in its province. The result was that 
 Congress continued the appropriation for the maintenance of the 
 observatory, and its wisdom in doing so no thoughtful man who 
 has reflected upon the history of science can doubt. For if there 
 is anything which history teaches, it is that every important scien- 
 tific truth may be translated into useful activity for mankind. 

There can be no doubt in the mind of any competent thinker in 
 this field that from Doctor Langley's researches with the bolometer, 
 the photographic plate, and various instruments of accurate mechan- 
 ism devised or perfected by him will date discoveries of vast im- 
 port, not merely to scientific investigators, but to the world at large. 
 His first discoveries are sure to be written in the history of the nine- 
 teenth century as among the real glories of our country. They 
 combine profound original research, exquisite ingenuity, and a large, 
 philosophic view of the relations of his work to that which had gone 
 before and that which was sure to follow. 

But, while carrying on these original researches in his principal 
 field, his fertility of thought was seen in other directions calculated 
 to benefit his fellow-men. He did not fear to endanger his reputa- 
 tion as an original investigator by spreading scientific knowledge 
 in various forms among the people at large, and in terms not merely 
 intelligible, but attractive. Courses of lectures and articles in maga- 
 zines addressed to men and women of various attainments testify 
 amply to this. Some of these rose into the higher regions, not only 
 of science, but of literature. Notable especially was his address in 
 1888, on retiring from the presidency of the American Association 
 for the Advancement of Science. It was entitled "The History of a 
 Doctrine" â€” this doctrine having relation to radiant energy. Both 
 in thought and style it is a masterpiece and it reveals the mind of a 
 philosopher. Many passages give contributions to philosophic 
 thought, but I select one, which runs as follows : "We have, per- 
 haps, seen that the history of progress in this department of science 
 is little else than a chapter in that larger history of human error 
 which is still to be written ;" but he adds : "Shall we say that the 
 knowledge of truth is not advancing? * * * j^- ^^ advancing, 
 and never so fast as today ; but the steps of its advance are set on
