spreading knowledge, was an invitation to give a course of lectures 
 before the Royal Institution of Great Britain. These lectures, with 
 various communications to learned bodies, and especially to the 
 Institute of France, increased his international reputation, which 
 took shape in a most remarkable series of honors. 

A brief summary of these shows the high place which his name 
 holds in the annals of science : 

From Oxford came the degree of D. C. L. ; from Cambridge, that 
 of D. Sc. ; from Harvard, Princeton, Michigan, and Wisconsin uni- 
 versities and elsewhere, that of LL. D. ; from the American Academy 
 of Sciences, the Henry Draper Medal ; from the Royal Society of 
 London, the Rumford Medal ; from the American Academy of Arts 
 and Sciences, their Rumford Aledal ; from the Institute of France, 
 the Janssen ]\Iedal, and from the Astronomical Society of France, 
 their special medal. He was made a foreign member of the Royal 
 Society of London, a corresponding member of the Institute of 
 France, a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society of London, a 
 member of the Royal Institution of London, of the Academia dei 
 Lincei at Rome, of the National Academy of Sciences, and of other 
 bodies eminent in the scientific world. 

In the midst of these honors, gained by original investigation, his 
 feeling in behalf of the popularization of science continued, and one 
 of its manifestations gives a curious revelation of his heart. Quiet, 
 undemonstrative, reserved as he was — even to a fault, as many 
 thought — and even though he had no family of his own, he had a 
 deep love for little children, and this love was shown in a way 
 most effective and original. He provided in the Museum of the 
 Smithsonian a room containing objects in various fields of natural 
 research which would please children and awaken their interest. 
 Even this room showed his ingenuity ; it became deeply interesting 
 not merely to the children, but to their parents and grandparents, 
 and to widen this interest he published an article — of all places in 
 the world — in the St. Nicholas Magazine, in which he appears as an 
 attorney for the children against the more staid devotees of science. 

His devotion to the welfare of his countrymen at large carried 
 him still further. He was one of those who believe that the highest 
 interests of this Republic are served by making its capital city more 
 and more dignified, noble, beautiful, and attractive. During the 
 later years of his life it was his custom to make an annual visit to 
 Europe in order to study the latest progress made, not only in sci- 
 ence, but in art, and the feelings thus strengthened he brought back 
 to his own coimtrv. One manifestation of these was seen in his zeal
