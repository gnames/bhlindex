the difficult problems which were offered in his time to human ob- 
 servation or curiosity. One of his most intimate friends, Dr. Cyrus 
 Adler, to whom I am greatly indebted for details of Langley's life, 
 tells us that he loved to talk with men of positive religious views 
 about their own beliefs, and took a deep interest in a Jesuit, or a 
 Jew, or a Buddhist, or a Mohammedan, or, indeed, in any man who 
 thought he had secured any truth and knew the way of life in this 
 world or in the world to come. His paper on "The Laws of Nature" 
 is a very significant revelation of this characteristic — melancholy at 
 times, but suggestive of broader ranges of thought than those 
 bounded by the orbits of the greater number of skeptics. 

Nor was all this at the expense of his scientific, artistic, or prac- 
 tical qualities. 

Being with him in Paris some years since, I learned from him his 
 hope that a great collection, made with large resources, special abil- 
 ity, and long-continued care — a collection which illustrated an im- 
 portant field of industrial endeavor and at the same time some 
 interesting fields in art — was in the possession of an American then 
 residing in that city, wdio in various conversations had shown a 
 willingness to have it pass under some public custody in the United 
 States. 

Doctor Langley's discussions of this collection, of its bearings both 
 on art and industry, of the appropriateness of such a destination, of 
 the place which it might occupy in the Smithsonian Institution, showed 
 a breadth of view and a fertility of resource in practical matters 
 which left nothing to be desired. His arguments were absolutely 
 convincing, and it is through no fault of his that the arrangement 
 which he proposed has not yet been consummated, and none the less 
 does his earnestness in behalf of an exhibition which would have 
 benefited not merely Washington, but the whole country, deserve 
 commemoration. 

It may be thought that this popularizing of scientific results, this 
 zeal in fields which his predecessors had thought mainly outside of 
 the true scope of the Smithsonian Institution, this broad love for 
 literature, art, and general science, this passion for investigating 
 remote and even strange subjects of thought, this zeal for attaching 
 to the Smithsonian Institution anything of value in any field, would 
 weaken his power for fixing his mind upon his main subjects of in- 
 vestigation. Not so : not at all so. These studies outside his main 
 work certainly revived him and gave him new energy. Again and 
 again he came back to original researches and studies in his own 
 field of science which showed all his old fertility and ingenuity.
