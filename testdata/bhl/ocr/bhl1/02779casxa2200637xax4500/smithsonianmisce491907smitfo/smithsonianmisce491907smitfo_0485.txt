to learned bodies ; it was spread abroad by the newspapers, and in 
 an article published in McClurc's Magazine Doctor Langley himself 
 described this trial and told how he came to enter upon the subject. 
 From his own words we learn that this had been a problem with him 
 from his childhood ; that in his early days he used to lie on his back 
 in a New England pasture, watching the hawks soaring far above 
 him, sailing for a long time without any motion of their wings, and 
 suggesting questions which were renewed during his mature life, and 
 which finally set him at seriously inquiring whether the problem of 
 artificial flight was as hopeless and absurd as it was thought to be: 
 "If Nature has solved it, why not man?" This article, published in 
 1897, closed with the following paragraphs : 

"I have thus far had only a purely scientific interest in the results 
 of these labors. Perhaps if it could have been foreseen at the outset 
 how much labor there was to be, how much of life would be given to 
 it, and how much care, I might have hesitated to enter upon it at 
 all. And now reward must be looked for, if reward there be, in the 
 knowledge that I have done the best I could in a difficult task, with 
 results which it may be hoped will be useful to others. I have 
 brought to a close the portion of the work which seemed to be spe- 
 cially mine â€” the demonstration of the practicability of mechanical 
 flight ; for the next stage, which is the commercial and practical de- 
 velopment of the idea, it is probable that the world may look to 
 others." 

It must not be supposed that Langley, even during this period, 
 dropped his astrophysical work. He steadily thought upon the im- 
 provement of his instruments, and through such improvements pro- 
 duced invaluable results. The bolometer was brought to a greater 
 degree of refinement than had ever before been attained, and the 
 w^ork under his direction had progressed during this period to such 
 a point as to justify the publication of a remarkable volume of An- 
 nals and an expedition to observe the solar eclipse of 1900, at Wades- 
 boro, North Carolina, in which he was remarkably successful. A 
 half dozen or more papers illustrating the various advances made in 
 the study of the spectrum were also issued about this time. 

But while this, which he considered the great work of his life, 
 was going on he was led, in 1898, through circumstances which are 
 not definitely known, but which had to do, to a certain extent, with 
 the Spanish-American War, to take up the building of a flying- 
 machine of such power as to carry a man, this work being under- 
 taken under the Board of Ordnance and Fortification of the United 
 States Armv and with an allotment made by that board for the pur-
