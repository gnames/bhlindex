tat ion — at home and abroad — seemed butchered to make an Amer- 
 ican hohday. At his years, for he was then nearly seventy, aU this, 
 despite his optimism, deeply affected him. 

And here should be considered for a moment the lack of means to 
 which he referred in one of his statements. It was a lack of means 
 from the source from which he thought he was entitled to obtain 
 them. An absolute lack of means there was not. Private indi- 
 viduals offered him the means to continue his work. Several years 
 before this he had been offered a considerable sun,i for this work if 
 he would but place it upon some commercial basis, and take out pat- 
 ents on such portions of the machinery as were patentable, in order 
 that commercial reward might come to the persons furnishing the 
 money ; but he steadfastly refused either to secure a patent or to 
 accept money from private persons as a matter of business. He de- 
 clared that his work was solely in the interest of the nation, and if 
 the nation was not prepared to support it, he was not willing to pro- 
 ceed with it. 

Xo one can deny that the stand he thus took was honorable to 
 him — as honorable as was the similar stand taken by his great prede- 
 cessor. Doctor Henry, regarding his discoveries -and inventions in 
 electro-magnetism, which, had they been patented, would have 
 brought him wealth. 

Interesting is it that a verdict was rendered upon these later ex- 
 periments by a body of thoughtful and practical students in aero- 
 dynamics, who. after a series of meetings in the city of New York, 
 adopted resolutions expressing their high estimation of Doctor 
 Langley's contributions to the science of aerial locomotion and of 
 his successful efforts in solving some of the most difficult problems 
 involved ; and it is consoling to know that this, the last official paper 
 laid before him. gave him comfort upon his death-bed. We may 
 well rejoice that in his last hours he received this testimony of 
 confidence from a most competent source as to his theoretical suc- 
 cess, and as to possibilities and even probabilities of ultimate prac- 
 tical success. 

It remains now to make brief allusion to some of his personal 
 characteristics — ^to his daily life as the world saw it. 

It cannot be claimed that among the great body of younger men 
 devoted to science he ever aroused any such general affection as they 
 had bestowed upon his immediate predecessor. Respected Langley 
 ^vas— universally and widely ; popular, in the usual sense of the word, 
 he was not. Yet there were not a few among his compeers who not 
 onlv revered, but loved him. As regarded the world at large, even
