26 SMITHSONIAN MISCKLLANEOUS COLLECTIONS. 

draftsman led him first to an architect's office. A year later he was 
 appointed assistant in the Astronomical Observatory of Harvard 
 College, and his interest was thus permanently directed to this de- 
 partment of science. The first problem assigned him was the study 
 of the great Trifid Nebula in Sagittarius, a research in which his 
 unusual combination of artistic skill and precise methods proved as 
 useful to him as in some of his later work. The first discovery he 
 made was two faint stars near the remarkable triple star in this 
 nebula. The next year found him teaching in the Naval Academy, 
 as Assistant Professor of I^Iathematics, and in the following year 
 he was appointed Director of the Allegheny Observatory. This po- 
 sition was regarded by his associates as an extremely desirable one. 
 Although under the control of the University of Western Pennsyl- 
 vania, no teaching was required. The liberality of the founder, the 
 late William Thaw% permitted the entire time of the director to be 
 devoted to research â€” a privilege then enjoyed by but few American 
 astronomers. His early years at Allegheny were not free from in- 
 cident. His predecessor became insane, and wrote a poem about 
 the large telescope which he appeared to worship. He objected to 
 the presence of other persons in the dome and emphasized his views 
 with a shotgun. In his poem he predicted the disappearance of the 
 lens, which by a singular coincidence came true, although it appears 
 to be certain that he had no connection with the theft. Mr. Langley 
 tactfully got into communication with the thief, and his account of 
 their interview was graphic. Walking up and down under the trees 
 one evening in a secluded spot, the thief remarked, "You are a gen- 
 tleman and I am a gentleman ; we can trust one another." The lens 
 was finally returned without the reward which was oft'ered for the 
 conviction of the thief. 

There was only one disadvantage to Langley 's position, the lack 
 of appreciative friends interested in his work ; but it was a serious 
 loss to a man of his social disposition. To offset this, it gave him 
 abundant leisure, which he employed to good advantage, as he was 
 an omnivorous reader. There was a grain of truth in his witty 
 reply to an admiring young lady, who remarked, "Why, Mr. Lang- 
 ley, I do believe you have read every book that ever was written." 
 "Oh, no," he said, "there are six that I have not read, as yet." He 
 thus attained a cultivation that more than made up for his lack of a 
 college education and gave him a remarkably large vocabulary. It 
 was perhaps through these conditions that he acquired a charming 
 style, which rendered his "Old and New Astronomy" one of the 
 most enjoyable works on the subject. His first contribution to a
