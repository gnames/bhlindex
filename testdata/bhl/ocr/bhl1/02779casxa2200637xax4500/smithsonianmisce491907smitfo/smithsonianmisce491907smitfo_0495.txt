lation as to the rationale of flight, ^of the way of an eagle in the 
 air," but the question of power required was in hopeless confusion. 

Mr. Langley was then engaged in the study of astrophysics at the 
 observatory in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, and there, in the beginning 
 of 1887, through the liberality of the late WilHam Thaw, the work 
 was commenced by the construction of a turn-table of exceptional 
 size driven by a steam-engine. This served during three years to 
 impel against the air planes and appliances equipped with most in- 
 genious measuring and recording instruments designed by Langley 
 and attached to the arm of this rotating balanced beam. The whole 
 apparatus was very scientific and accurate. The results were pub- 
 lished in 1 89 1 by the Smithsonian Institution, under the title of 
 "Experiments in Aerodynamics," and at once attracted great atten- 
 tion and commendation. 

These epoch-making experiments probably constitute Mr. Lang- 
 ley's chief title to fame in aerodynamics. To avoid complexity, thev 
 were all made upon plane surfaces (which he stated might not be the 
 "best form of surfaces for support) ; but they gave to physicists and 
 to searchers, perhaps for the first time, firm ground on which to 
 stand, as to the long-disputed questions of air resistances and reac- 
 tions. They established (a) a more reliable coefficient for rectangu- 
 lar pressures than that of Smeaton. They proved (b) that upon 
 inclined planes the air pressures were really normal to the surface. 
 They disproved (c) the '"'Newtonian law," that the normal pressure 
 varied as the square of the angle of incidence on inclined planes. 
 They showed (d) that the empirical formula of Duchemin, proposed 
 in 1836 and ignored for fifty years, was approximately correct; that 
 (e) the position of the center of pressure varied with the angle of 
 inclination, and that on planes its movements approximately fol- 
 lowed the law formulated by Joessel; that (/) oblong planes, pre- 
 sented with their longest dimension to the line of motion, were more 
 efifective for support than when presented with their narrower side ; 
 that (g) planes might be superposed without loss of supporting 
 power if spaced apart certain distances which varied with the speed; 
 and (h) that thin planes consumed less power for support at high 
 speeds than at low speeds. This has been called "Langley's law." 
 It results from the fact that the higher the speed, the less need be 
 the angle of inclination to sustain a given weight and the less there- 
 fore the horizontal component of the air pressure. It is true only if 
 the plane alone be considered, without any adjuncts, but it leaves 
 out of the reckoning the head resistance due to the various parts of 
 a complete flying-machine, such as its framing, its hull, etc.
