His lack of success was probably due to the fact that, Hke Maxim, 
 Ader, Kress, and many others, he undertook too much at once by 
 endeavoring to produce a full-fledged dynamic flying-machine ab 
 initio, before making sure of the control, the stability, and the possi- 
 bility of alighting safely ; but he rescued the problem from contempt, 
 he laid the lines which must be followed, and, having published the 
 results of his experiments and given other men data upon which to 
 conquer the air, he will ever be remembered as the precursor and the 
 pathfinder of successful flying-machines.
