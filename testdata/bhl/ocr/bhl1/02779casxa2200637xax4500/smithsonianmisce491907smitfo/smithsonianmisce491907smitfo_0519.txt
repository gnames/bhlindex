By ALEXANDER G. McADIE 

1897. January 1; Berkeley; 1:10 p. m. Distinct shock; duration, 5 seconds; 
 recorded on duplex seismograph at Students' Observatory.— Prof. 
 A. O. Leuschner. 

1897. January 16; Mount Hamilton; 3:58:41±5 a. m. Intensity II on 
 E-F. scale.— Prof. W. W. Campbell. 

3:58:35 ±5 a. m. E. F. I. Two rather long, slow waves, lasting one 
 and a half or two seconds; scarcely any trace on duplex seismo- 
 graph; did not start the Ewing instrument. — Prof. C. D. Perrine. 

1897. January 17; San Francisco; 1:09:52 p. m. Sharp shock felt in all 
 parts of the city. Two well-defined counter-vibrations of consider- 
 able force. — Prof. A. G. McAdie. 

Two slight shocks about four seconds apart. Motion vertical. — Prof. 
 George Davidson. 

Oakland; Chabot Observatory. Seismograph showed heavy disturb- 
 ance, vibrations mainly from east to west. — Prof. Charles Burck- 
 halter. 

Alameda; 1:11 p. m. Complicated record made on duplex principally 
 east and west. The magnified record is 6 mm. long in this direc- 
 tion and 2 mm. north and south. — Prof. C. D. Perrine. 

Oakland; 1:11:11 p. m. Eeported by A. H. Babcock two sharp shocks 
 about a second apart; time of second shock given and believed to 
 be correct within a second. 

1897. January 17; Oakland; 1:10:55±2 p. m. The shock was accompanied 
 by a distinct report.— G. E. Lukens. 
 Mills College; 1:11 p. ni. Shock short, but sharp and distinct. Ee- 
 ported by Josiah Keep. The duplex record shows an area of 7 mm. 
 north and south and 4 mm. east and west, containing a great num- 
 ber of individual vibrations impossible to unravel. There are also 
 one double wave and one or two single ones extending to the west 
 (?) of the main disturbance. — C. D. P. 

San Leandro.
