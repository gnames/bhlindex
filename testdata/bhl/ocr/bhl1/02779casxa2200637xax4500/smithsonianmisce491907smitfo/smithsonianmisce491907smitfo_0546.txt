in all directions. No very violent vibrations — /. c, sharp, quick. 
 House rocked uncomfortably, accompanied by some noises. Time 
 of beginning probably' 2 seconds late. E.-F. VI or VII. No wind.

1903. June 11; Lick Observatory. About 9:55 p. m., ,hine 10, preceding 
 the earthquake shock by 7 hours and 20 minutes, the mercury was 
 so disturbed that for an interval of more than one minute ab- 
 solutely no images were visible. At the time, this was attributed 
 to some freak of the wind, which was, however, quite moderate 
 and steady. Ordinarily little trouble is experienced from wind, 
 even when violent, and then only for brief intervals. This dis- 
 turbance was a continuous quiver which rendered all reflections 
 impossible. Tremors previously noted as connected with earth- 
 quake shocks were usually of the nature of vibrations or oscilla- 
 tions.— Prof. E. H. Tucker. 

Very severe quake. Good records on both instruments, but the 
 Ewing clock did not start. The record of the clock beats was 
 accordingly impressed later. The general direction of vibration 
 was northeast and southwest, with a strong vortical component. 
 There is evidence of gyratory motion Vt^hich is clearly shown in 
 the duplex record. The maximum oscillation of the earth's sur- 
 face was 1/5", E.-F. VI or VII.— Prof. E. H. Curtiss.
