been cut through it two hundred feet in width. ' ' In a little less 
 than a mile he counted no less than 345 cracks running in every 
 conceivable direction. A marked displacement of the pipe lines 
 of the Spring Vallev Water Company also indicates a slip of the 
 San Andreas fault. Prof. A. C. Lawson, of the University of 
 California, has shown that the San Francisco peninsula has at 
 least three well-marked faults. Some of these, especially the San 
 Bruno fault, traverse the Gulf of the Farallones and the northern 
 peninsula. It must not be forgotten that the earthquake wrought 
 great damage in Marin, Sonoma, Napa, Lake, Mendocino, and 
 Humboldt counties. At Santa Eosa the destruction was very groat. 

No tidal wave or disturbance in the water of any character followed 
 the earthquake. The waters of San Francisco Bay were unusually 
 calm throughout the forenoon of April 18. 

A number of valuable records have been made orr seismographs, of 
 the Omori horizontal pendulum type, of the earth waves at various 
 points. In the Weather Bureau at Washington, D. C, the record 
 obtained by Professor Marvin of an east and west motion showed 
 that the preliminary tremors lasted for six minutes befoi'e the 
 larger wave motions were recorded. At Tokyo the duration of 
 these first preliminary tremors was nine minutes and fortj'-nine 
 seconds; at Birmingham, England, about twenty-five minutes. 
 Other records have been obtained at eight or nine stations where 
 seismographs have been installed, and in due time data will be 
 ])ublished showing the probable origin and nature of the earth 
 dislocation. This, it is thought, will be a line or plane rather than 
 a definite point or centrum. From the duration of the tremors 
 the approximate arcual distance between the seismograph and 
 the origin, can be determined. 

1906. April 18; San Francisco Bay. Captain R. Peterson, German steamer 
 "I'arda, " of Kosmos line, reports: "5:05 a. m., off the Golden 
 Gate, near the middle buoy, felt a sharp earthquake lasting from 
 3 to 4 minutes, causing every one on board to think that we had 
 struck a rock or submerged wreck. Sounding S^^ fathoms and 
 afterwards 5 fathoms. While at anchor in San Francisco Bay 
 felt shocks all daj'. " 
 NoTE.--This steamer also experienced the Valparaiso earthquake of 
 August 16, 1906, at 8:10 a. m.; also after shocks, August 17 and 
 18, while lying at anchor in harbor of A^alparaiso. 

1906. April 18; Oakland, Chabot Observatory. Prof. Charles Burckhalter; 
 duplex pendulum seismograph; 5:12:51 a. m.; duration 48 seconds; 
 directions all possible; intensity VIII-IX. Pendulum of sidereal 
 clock wrecked; mean-time clock pendulum jammed behind arc; 
 clock stood at 5:14:48, but experts believe clock raced two 
 minutes. Gravity escapement. Second severe shock 8:19:20. dura- 
 tion 5 seconds; direction northeast to southwest; intensity V. 
 Fifteen additional shocks by 1 p. m., duration from 2 to 5 seconds; 
 directions east to west; intensities II to IV. Three shocks be-
