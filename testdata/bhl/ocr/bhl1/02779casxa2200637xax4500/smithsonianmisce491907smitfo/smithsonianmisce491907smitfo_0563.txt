 in house at end of that time. Heaviest shock 11 seconds after start, 
 shocks coming about one a second. Heaviest E.-F. VIII; north- 
 vi^est to southeast. First secondary maximum about 5 seconds after 
 beginning — maximum 11 seconds after beginning. Another sec- 
 ondary maximum about 15 or 20 seconds from beginning, accom-

"Time 5:12:19 a. ni. At first a jar, then a perceptible pause, then 
 a tremble. Oounted up to 25 seconds positively, then continued 
 mechanically. I would put the time of duration between 30 and 
 35 seconds. Heard no sound preceding the shake. Other shocks 
 same day 8:14:39, 9:16:52, 11:53:34 a. m., 2:28:36 j.. in. "—Miss

 window could see the walls of the brick house shaking * * * " —

"Clock in director's office stopped at 5:12:52 a. ni. This clock has 
 a very small and steady rate, was noted as correct within a half 
 minute April 15. Conclusion; violent part of earthquake was 
 between 5:12:22 and 5:13:22."— J. D. Maddrill. 

C A. Vogt states beginning of shock 5:11:50. 

"Time of beginning 5:12:13. Counted for one minute before getting 
 time from watch; heavy vibration still felt at that time. 60 
 seconds after first count. Motion was felt for nearly a minute 
 longer, or nearly two minutes after first count. The motion was 
 almost entirely horizontal, no vertical movement of consequence 
 was noticed. The waves were very long but smooth. The heaviest 
 seemed to be nearly east and west. Intensity on the R.-F. 
 scale VIII or IX. Water in Smith creek 12 noon was densely 
 milky, light slate color, not yellowish as after heavy freshet." —
