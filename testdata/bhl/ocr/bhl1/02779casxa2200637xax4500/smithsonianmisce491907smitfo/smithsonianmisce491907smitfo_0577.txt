 American schooner "Stanley." Willapa Harbor to San Francisco. 
 Heavy southerly gale blowing and heavy swell on, when suddenly 
 wind died down to a calm, but swell still continued. About the 
 time when wind dropped to a calm, felt a sharp earthquake shock 
 lasting about two or three seconds. Immediately afterwards we 
 were looking toward the southwest, when we saw mountainous 
 waves coming toward us; when they struck the vessel she began 
 to pitch and roll violently, and we thought every minute we 
 would be swamped. In the midst of the confusion all the sailors 
 became alarmed and took to the rigging. I immediately began 
 using oil to help calm the seas and to protect the vessel from 
 serious injury. The wind finally sprang up from the northwest, 
 light, hazy, and misty. Barometer 28:60 inches. The dangerous 
 seas lasted for about one hour and thirty minutes. The mate was 
 certain that the mountainous seas were caused by the earthquake 
 shock. — K. Peterson and K. Magensen. 

1906. November 11; American bark " Carondelet," Capt. Thomas Doyle. 
 Latitude 42° 51' N., longitude 127° 31' W. 6:40 a. m. I felt a 
 quick rolling sensation, and a few seconds after felt the ship 
 tremble fore and aft. I thought at the time that we had run 
 on top of some sunken vessel or a whale. It looked like a heavy 
 tide rip all around the vessel. The second shock was light. As 
 to the tides, for 24 hours after had about one-half mile per hour. 
 Bound from Port Gamble to San Francisco; experienced very 
 rough weather for 11 days; nothing but gales from southeast 
 round to southwest.
