THE FARM JOURNAL.

" It is a great fallacy to suppose that Tfhen an indmd- 
 ual becomes the editor of an Agricultui'al paper, he ne- 
 cessarily constitutes himself a dictator of opinion and 
 practice to his readers." — Tennessee Farmer. 

No apology is necessary in offering a new periodi- 
 cal devoted to the subject of Agriculture and the 
 collateral Arts and Sciences, to the farmers of Penn- 
 sylvania and the neighboring States, as ■well as to 
 others who desire to know the condition, and become 
 acquainted with the prospects of the most useful and 
 extensive branch of American employment. 

The formation of societies and the publication of 
 journals devoted to Agriculture tend to impress the 
 farmer with the dignity and importance of his pro- 
 fession, and places its claims to respect prominently 
 before the world at large. But whilst there are pe- 
 riodicals devoted to the interests of the merchant, the 
 mechanic, the politician, and in fact to the chief pur- 
 suits and tastes of civilized society, the cultivators of 
 the soil have generally been among the last to be 
 supplied with this kind of mental food ; and were it 
 not that they have shown themselves ready to adopt 
 improvements as they become acquainted with them 
 (the early introduction of thrashing machines, im- 
 proved plows, and other implements being proof of 
 the fact) the condition of American agriculture would 
 not have occupied its present favorable position in 
 comparison with other branches of industry. 

From their generally isolated position, farmers have 
 but few opportunities of consulting together, and mak- 
 ing themselves acquainted with the various modes of 
 culture employed in distant regions, whilst the results 
 of individual experience are confined to limited dis- 
 tricts. One farmer may think of adopting a rotation 
 of crops differing from that to which he has been accus- 
 tomed, but fears that the result may be unfavorable, 
 although the experiment may have been successful, or 
 may have failed, in a different part of the country. 

Under these circumstances, an Agricultural Jour- 
 nal takes it stand between the person who wishes 
 information, and the one who is capable of supplying 
 it; and it becomes a bond of' union and sympathy, 
 forming a partial recompense for the want of the ac- 
 tive intercourse which exists among those engaged in 
 mechanical pursuits. This end is accomplished to a 
 great extent by the formation of Agricultural Socie- 
 ties, but it frequently happens that the farmer cannot 
 leave his home at the periods when these meet, whilst 
 the Journal makes its regular visits to his own door. 

"We expect to devote considerable space to Corres- 
 pondence, and we invite communications upon field, 
 garden, and orchard culture, and their coUateval 
 branches. 

As soon as the necessary arrangements can ba 
 made, we intend to import the best German, French 
 and English Periodicals devoted to farming, that oiir 
 readers may become acquainted with the latest agri- 
 rieultural improvements abroad. Particular atten- 
 tion will be paid to the Revicic of new Books which 
 have a bearing upon the subjects to which the Farm 
 Journal is devoted. 

There existed formerly certain prejudices against 
 "book" farming, but as modern agricultural litera- 
 ture embodies the observations and practical experi- 
 ence of the best farmers, such objections are now 
 untenable. Judge J. Buel, (who was lost to his coun- 
 try in 1839,) did much to advance agriculture by 
 making it a matter of the head, aa well as of the 
 hand; and his success was such, that besides giving 
 an impulse to farming which was felt throughout the 
 Union, he increased the value of his own light and 
 sandy farm, "which cost in an uncultivated state, 
 thirty dollars an acre," so as to be worth " two hun- 
 dred dollars an acre for farming purjioses." 

In addition to the practical results, the employ- 
 ment of the reasoning powers in agriculture elevates 
 it to the dignity of a science. It refines the mind of 
 the cultivator, perfects his education, places him on 
 an equal footing with the professional man, and pre- 
 sents to his offspring a wide range in the field a of go
