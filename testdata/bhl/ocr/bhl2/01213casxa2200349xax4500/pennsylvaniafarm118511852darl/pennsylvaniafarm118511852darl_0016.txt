FARM JOURNAL. 

Aprit,"^ 

tliatis, a desire so pervading, or so inhei-ont, if you will, 
 that I am ever ready to contribute my mite towards 
 promoting agriculture in any ({uarter, but more par- 
 ticularly m Pennsylvania. Well, then, to begin: I 
 shall say a few words on the expediency of farmers 
 encouraging Agricultural Papers for their own sakes 
 at least, to say nothing of the propriety of patronising 
 such works for the credit of their good old Common- 
 wealth, which should never bo permitted to lag be- 
 hind any other state, in any thing commendable. 

It will be admitted that no man claiming to belong 
 to a party, or fraternity, can maintain its principles, 
 ■ understand its policy, know its strength or condition 
 fully, without commingling with his fellow-members, 
 participating in their meetings, or lieing periodically 
 K'lvised of their practice and progress. If this be so 
 in the general, with what force must the necessity of 
 a compliance with one of those means of enlighten- 
 ment and intercommunication, particularly appeal to 
 the common sense of every farmer, who from his iso- 
 late position is debarred in a great measure from mix- 
 ing with the world, and of the chance of being carried 
 along with it in its improving progress. A Paper 
 then is, of all things, the most available channel, 
 through which he can learn what is going on in the 
 way of improvements, in the line of farming. How 
 indispen.^able to him, who is toiling week after week, 
 apart from the stirring world, except when he is at 
 the Mill, the Blacksmith's Shop or the AVheel- 
 vrright's, to receive a monthly Journal, devoted to the 
 advancement of the very art, by which he earns a 
 livelihood. An Agricultural Paper which enables 
 him to know the condition of the seeding, and harvestr 
 ing and cropping at distant places, thereby affording 
 a glimpse at the prices that will rule in grain, corn, 
 &o., in advance — that will tell him of experiments 
 and results in the matter of Rust, Potato-rot, Smut 
 and variou.s other thiug.s, as disease in cattle and other 
 stock ; pests in various shapes, which he fain would 
 know, and should know — of improved tillage, cheap 
 drainage, profitable breeds of cattle, sheep and hogs, 
 and economical feeding of them that will inform 
 him of the proceedings of Agricultural Societies, 
 the display and addresses at Agricultural Exhibi- 
 tions ; in short, such information touching the whole 
 routine, practice and theory of tillage and husban- 
 dry — the weal and wo of that class of society, in 
 whose character and career, the destiny of himself 
 and family is uncpiestionaldy involved. Where is 
 the farmer, who will allow himself to think upon the 
 subject, would be without such a paper, when it 
 costs but the pitiful sum of, one doll.ir per year ! 
 The expediency, nay the necessity, of an Agricultur- 
 al Journal being read at every farmer's fireside is so 
 apparent, tliat it would seem a waste of time to demon- 
 strate a proposition, which all must admit, and none 
 could, if they would, deny or contravert. Well, then, 
 what must we tliink of the fatuity, the insensibility, 
 that prevails among the farmers of Pennsylvania, 
 ■when it may be safely stated, that seven-eighths of 
 them do not subscribe for, or read an Agricultural 
 Paper. How mortifying to think of such a condition 
 of things; and to point to the fate of the " Farmer's 
 Cabinet," an Agricultural Paper, published for sev- 
 eral years in Philadelphia, and which, after a hard 
 struggle for existence, perished for lack of patronage. 
 Its remains were sold to a Publisher in New York, a 
 State, which supports three or four Agricultural 
 Journals creditably. If this is not sufficient to lower 
 the brow of every intelligent, right minded farmer, in 
 what is called, "the Key stone State," I should be at 
 a loss to know what could cause Ms eye to flash or his 
 brow to droop. 

Permit mo to ask, my brother farmers, if houses are 
 built as some fifty years ago they were ? Is their 
 erection such an interminable job now as it former- 
 ly was ? Do carpenters work with the same clumsy 
 tools as then ? Are brick made and burned as iix 
 days of yore ? Is tanning bo slow a process as it 
 used to be ? Is the smelting and forging of Iron bet- 
 ter understood ; and how is it with the whole range 
 of manufactures and machinery ? All changed, and 
 for the better. Well, how is it with farming?" Pretty 
 much as it was in the days of our great-grand-fathers, 
 a century ago. Wherein is the cause of this differ- 
 once? Why, while the farmer reads nothing to en- 
 lighten him on the practice of his calling, nor joins a 
 society for the improvement of himself and others of 
 the same profession, believing that his art is not sus- 
 ceptible of improvement ; the Mechanic, Manufoctur- 
 er and Maehinest devour every thing that emanates 
 from their Institutes, attach themselves to Societies 
 peculiar to their craft, hold exhibitions, try to out- 
 rival each other in experiment and skill, and hence 
 the rapid and astonishing improvement to be seen in 
 the practice of every industrial pursuit but farming, 
 and that is at so dead a halt that neither drum, fife 
 nor trumpet can throw it into a " forward, march !" — 
 Every thing is going ahead Ijut farming. Such is the 
 spirit of progress, that it is no uncommon thing now- 
 a-days, to find some son of the thimble starring it 
 among his brethren of the shears, clipping a little of 
 their superfluous cabbage, in the shape of admission 
 to a lecture on the philosophy of coat-cutting, accord- 
 ing to the science of anatomy. All trades and pro- 
 fessions are under whip and spur on the road of pro- 
 gress, except farming, and that is so immoveable, that 
 it can scarcely lift its head to look over the fence, to 
 see the race. 

To what cause can this indifference, this " mildew 
 of the mind" be traced ? Some say the cold neglect 
 of the Legislature, who has never directed an encour- 
 aging glance, nor bestowed a gracious smile upon the 
 toiling tillers of the soil. Others will have it, that it 
 is in the nature of farming to make dull and apathetic, 
 and that nothing can be done for those who will do 
 nothing for themselves — and so we might have as 
 many opinions vipon this matter, as persons could be 
 found to put the question to ; and differing as widely 
 too, as would the doctors, should the cause of love or 
 madness be submitted to them ; and therefore it is 
 unprofitable to seek for the cause any farther. It 
 will be much wiser to direct our attention to the 
 moans best calculated to infuse life and energy into 
 the torpid limbs of this unwieldy body, and set it 
 agoing ; and I know of no one agent fitter for the oc- 
 casion than a spirited, well conducted Agricultural 
 .Journal, such as you mean to publish, which, if taken 
 by any considerable portion of the farmers of Penn- 
 sylvania, it will be among them as the leaven, that 
 leavcneth the whole lump. 

A close observation for many years satisfies me 
 that an Agricultural paper is essential to the wanta 
 and requirements of the well disposed farmer. I hare 
 yet to meet the subscriber to any one of them, who 
 did not acknowledge his indebtedness in some shape 
 or other to its instructive pages. Show me the Agri- 
 culturist who is a constant reader of these periodicals, 
 and I will show you a Husbandman that is far in 
 advance of him who never reads any, unless his judg- 
 ment is iniquitously perverted, or his mind radically 
 defective. I know the favorable influence they exer- 
 cised on my farming operations. Experience has long 
 since convinced me of their utility, and I feel warrant- 
 ed in commending them strongly to others. For 
 years I haye taken some four or five of those leading;
