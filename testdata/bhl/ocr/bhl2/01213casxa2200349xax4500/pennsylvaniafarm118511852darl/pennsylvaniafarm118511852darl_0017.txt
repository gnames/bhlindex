FARM JOURNAL. 

Journals regularly, and am free to confess that though ; 
 this subscription might be deemed liberal on my part, 
 that even in the matter of dollars and cents, reckon- } 
 ing what paid, and what saved and made through , 
 them, I am largely their debtor. But this was not ' 
 all the pecuniary "value was of little moment to mo, j 
 compared with the gratification in times past, from an 
 occasional interchange of thought and sentiment with j 
 such editors as the Tuckers, the Aliens, the Pedders, j 
 the Tatems, the Sands the Batemans &c — the glow- 
 ing remembrance of that glorious past, serves now I 
 but to throw a deeper shade over the position in '■ 
 which one unguarded step, though well intended, j 
 placed my beautiful farm, splendid cattle, with 
 every thing connected with a scene and system of, 
 farniing, that were the theme of every observer — a 
 change so mortifying and so discouraging as that I 
 was made to feel, could not fail to damp my zeal and 
 drive me from the field where I had long so bravely | 
 struggled with others, besides those already mention- 
 ed, to establish a lofty and commanding character for 
 the agriculture of the country. This digression may 
 casilv be overlooked, for it is natural for one who 
 findshimself upon a path ho had not trodden for a,\ 
 long time, though once his accustomed walk, to stop 
 or turn aside to recognise some tree, or plant, or flow- 
 er that formerly had been familiar to hmi. So with 
 me after so long an interval of silence, finding myself 
 engaged in penning these hasty lines for the Agricul- 
 tural press, I could not refrain from indulging a 
 reminiscence forced upon me by the occasion. 

It has been stated that I was the gainer by sub- 
 scribing to agricultural papers. In proof of this I 
 shall instance one item in the shape of a remedy for 
 Hove in cattle, which I learned from one of these 
 Journals, and which saved me the lives of two or more 
 valualjle cattle worth some hundreds of dollars. 
 Jiove is produced by rapid or ravenous eating of 
 rank young clover, green corn &c, — and occasions the 
 death of numerous cattle yearly. The usual reme- 
 dies are the barbarous practice of stabbing, and 
 drenching with deleterious drugs ; both of which are 
 nearly as dangerous as the disorder. The simple 
 and most efiicient remedy is this, so soon as the 
 animal is discovered to be unusually distended or 
 hoven, let a twisted straw or hay rope as thick as a 
 man's wrist be immediately placed in its mouth, 
 bridle fashion, drawing it up tight, and tying it 
 securely on the back of the head behind the roots of 
 the horns. The animal's jaws will then stand open as 
 if gagged ; the efi'ort it makes to disengage itself of 
 the rope with its tongue, produces an action in the 
 muscles that relaxes the valves, as it were, and liber- 
 ates the gas. The cure is thus accomplished instan- 
 tor, and without injury to the animal. As time is 
 every thing in this matter, farmers should have the 
 rope always ready made, hanging in the stable, and 
 if the middle of it, (the part to be in the mouth of the 
 animal ) be besmeared with tar it would be more effica- 
 cious, but tar or no tar, the cure is certain, if tlie rope 
 is applied while there is yet any energy remaining in 
 the hoven beast. Now is not this worth a year's 
 subscription of your paper to every farmer who has 
 never heard of the remedy before. 

If I am not mistaken in the signs, I think the pre- 
 sent time is favorable for commencing an Agricultur- 
 al Journal. Many of late have inquired of me wheth- 
 er there was any likelihood of one being started soon, 
 and suggesting various plans and places appropriate 
 to its issue ; add to this the feeling manifested at the 
 Farmers' convention latelj' held at Ilarrisburg, which 
 if not permitted to subside, may work wonders for 
 rcnnsylvania. I trust the officers and members of 

the State Society will consider it not only their duty 
 to subscribe for your paper themselves, but to elicit 
 subscriptions for you in their respective neighbor- 
 hoods. In no way else can they, at this juncture, 
 subserve the cause so well, as in promoting the circu- 
 lation of a good Agricultural Paper, and the organiza- 
 tion of County Societies. The county societies al- 
 ready formed will no doubt patronize you liberally. 
 Finally, I would invoke the sons of farmers growiiic 
 into manhood, to set apart one dollar for your paper 
 every year, how hard so ever they may work to earn 
 it. If they do, I promise them that it will lighten their 
 work in the end, and jirove the best laid out dollar they 
 ever parted with. What more can I say ? Much, 
 but tiuie will not permit me to say more at present. 
 Wishing you much success for your own sake, and the 
 sake of Agricultiue, lam, (See,

On Permanent Pasture, and the breaking up of old 
 Grass I^and. 

It is a question among the farmers of England and 
 Scotland, as to how long land should lie unbroken by 
 the plough, and which is the most profit.able mode of 
 farming; to keep land permanently in pasture, or oc- 
 casionally to break up old sod ? As in all other de- 
 partments of agriculture, this must be decided by 
 circumstances, but of course the proper selection of 
 these circumstances, which are to produce a decision 
 of whether a thing is to be done or not to be done, 
 will depend on the observation, the clear judgment, 
 and the intelligence of the farmer. The question is 
 one of great importance to all graziers, to the farmers 
 of Chester, Delaware, parts of Lancaster in this State, 
 to considerable portions of Virginia, and much of the 
 Western countrj-, certainly howerever of more inter- 
 est to those portions of Pennsylvania, where grazing 
 for the market forms the chief if not sole chance of 
 profit, than to those more distant parts of the country, 
 where land is much cheaper, held in much smaller 
 quantities, and by no means as laboriously, as expen- 
 sively, or as well fenced, as in those celebrated Agri- 
 cultural Counties. The first question to be asked in 
 discussing tlie matter, is, what is your soil ? In Scot- 
 land where the farmers are strongly in favor of con- 
 verting grass into arable land, and where they bring 
 the best possible evidence, to support the practice by 
 so reducing the large crops, their opinion is supposed 
 to be a decision of necessity, from a deficency of chalk 
 in view, soil which is or is, supposed to be, calculated 
 for the support of the natural grasses. In Ireland, 
 where much land has been from time immemorial in 
 pasture, the surface rests on a limestone bottom. In 
 the best grazing parts of this state, there is neither 
 limo nor chalk. But it must not be supposed that by 
 the term " best" we mean that no part of the coun- 
 ties mentioned just now, that contain lime, are not 
 fit for the fattening of a bullock. We moan nothing 
 more than that those lime-stone regions are less fitted 
 for permanent pasture, than those which contain no 
 lime-stone. In the valleys of Chester, and Lancaster, 
 the land will not hold grass but a few years, though 
 they can no doubt fatten cattle, while a little farther 
 South, in the same counties, or at least in the county 
 of Chester, the land may stay in permanent pasture 
 any length of time, though we know of none that have 
 been so left, for more than fifty years. But we must 
 not take the example of England, Scotland, or Ireland, 
 for our model, even if there were great similarity in 
 the soil ; the difi'ercnce of climate would compel the 
 American farmer to an opposite mode of farming 
 The sun in those countries is only an occasional guest,
