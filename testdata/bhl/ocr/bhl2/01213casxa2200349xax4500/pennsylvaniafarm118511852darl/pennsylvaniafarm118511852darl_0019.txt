The steeping of grain in a solution of saltpetre, in 
 order to prepare it fur germination is not a recent or 
 even a modern improvement. It was used in Italy at 
 the commencement of the Christian era, or in the 
 days of Augustus, as appears from the Ueorgics of 
 Virgil :— 

" Some steep their seed, and some in caldi-ons boil, 
 With vigorous nitre and with lees of oil, 
 O'er gentle tires the exub'rant juice to drain. 
 And swell the flatt'ring husks with fruitful grain." 

Dryuen's Translation. 

The utility of saltpetre as a fertilizer has Ijcen 
 known and appreciated for centuries in England and 
 on the Continent of Europe, but the nitre of com- 
 merce was not to be obtained in sufficient quantities 
 or at a rate cheap enough to admit of its being exten- 
 sively employed by farmers, until modern times. — 
 Before the introduction of the Peruvian guano, per- 
 haps no substance was deemed of so great import- 
 ance to the growth of crops. Evelyn was of opinion, 
 tliat if his countrymen could procure an abundance 
 of saltpetre, they would need but little else "to me- 
 liorate their ground ;" and .Jethro Tull, placed nitre 
 at the head of the list of those substances which he 
 considered to be the essential food of plants. 

The deep green color of the corn mentioned in the 
 above statement, has often been observed as an effect 
 of all fertilizers containing nitrogen, such as oils, 
 blood, fish, soot, wine, &c., upon plants to which they 
 were applied. Experiments on Indian corn, with 
 salpetre or nitre, may be recommended as of great 
 importance, since that grain deserves to be ranked as 
 the grand agricultural staple of our country.

Peiuisylvaiila Farmers, 

Mr. Editor: — You may think I have chosen a trite 
 and worn out subject to lay before you readers. That 
 it has been descanted on a good deal I am aware, but 
 we need not fear exhausting a subject of so much 
 importance and interest to our fellow citizens; and 
 should I speak plainly to the farmer, I shall without 
 much apology expect th.m to bear with me, as I claim 
 to be one of them, having from my early youth either 
 been with them in delving the soil, or fraatemizing i)i 
 their associations. 

To be a " Pennsylvania Farmer" is, in other 
 parts of the Union, almost as good as a certificate of 
 excellence in the profession, and in a general sense I 
 am willing to admit that the distinction is a just one. 

I have rambled over a good deal of the Union — the 
 Eastern and Northern, the Southern and some of the 
 Western portions ; and in no section of any consider- 
 able extent have I seen the same e\idencc of high 
 cultivation and good farming as in many districts of 
 our own state. A little of this favorable opinion may 
 be attributed to partiality for my native state, but I 
 have nevertheless been able to discover many glaring 
 deficiencies. 

In this communication I shall confine my remarks 
 to barns and barn yards. The barns of Pennsylvania 
 are world renowned ; the external appearance of 
 most of them is imposing at least beyond those to 
 be found elsewhere. They are mostly built of stone, 
 liave bays, over-shoots, wings for carts «fcc., that in 
 the aggregate afford a great deal of room. The in- 
 ternal arrangement t<30, of most of our Ijarns, is ap- 
 propriate and good, but to look at the other side of 
 the picture, how few of them are kept in the neat, 
 comfortable, and at least decent condition that is due 
 to and consistent with the fine farms that surlouud 
 tbcm, A close inspection will betray broken spouts 

that permit the water to run in floods through the ma- 
 nure, or to penetrate the foundation of the building ; 
 the door hinges are broken, the latches loose; the 
 paint worn off, window shutters wanting &c. In the 
 interior, cob-webs loaded witli dust, hay seed, 
 straw, old harness, agricultural implements, litter, 
 &.C., mixed up in dirty confusion, and all from the 
 want of a little, a very little system and care. 

This culpable deficiency in the order and care of their 
 noble barns, strange to saj% will often be found with 
 men whose farms are patterns of neatness ; their fields 
 free from weeds ; their fences clean and well kept, a 
 careful and systematic rule of cropping, and depas- 
 turing observed ; all showing good management and 
 good rules except in the barn and cattle yard. This 
 deficiency is gross beyond endurance, and our worthy 
 farmers must set to work and " mend tlieir ways." I 
 know that to tell men of their faults will often make 
 them angry, but yet, they will nine times out of ten 
 profit by the unpalatable admonition. 

IIow few Ijarn or cattle yards are planned with a 
 view to economy in making and saving manure, and 
 how little effort or ingenuity is exercised to increase 
 i\ns fjold tnine oi ih<i farmer. With every rain the 
 svater passes in from all quarters, except one, where 
 it is discharged into the high-way, or an adjacent 
 stream or a ditch, carrying with it and wasting 
 the vei-y essence of the manure ; the soluble portions. 
 After this drenching, the sun and wind play their part 
 without intermission and tliat not only full scope, 
 but full time also may be given to the elements, the 
 gatherings of the stables and cattle yards are expos- 
 ed to this destructive process from early winter, to 
 mid-summer or autumn. 

I know, Mr. Editor, it is easier to carp and complain, 
 than to point out remedies, or to lay down rules that 
 are efficient and practicable ; this I shall endeavour to 
 do in a future number, unles.s you find I have already 
 said too much. 

Allow me at all events to remark that there are 
 many admirable exceptions to these charges. I know 
 of several farmers within the circle of my acquain- 
 tance whose barn, cattle-yard, and stock arrange- 
 ments, are patterns of neatness, system, and good or- 
 der. To such the result is not only a source of pleas- 
 ure but of large profit. Yours truly,

Education of Farmers. 

The subject of Education appears not to be proper- 
 ly understood or appreciated by farmers generally. I 
 do not mean that every farmer's son and daughter 
 should receive a regular course of Collegiate Educa- 
 tion — be proficient in Latin, Greek, Hebrew, &c ; 
 but, I do believe and contend that farmers should re- 
 ceive sound practical instruction in various branches 
 of science, to enable them to cultivate their soils to 
 the best advantage, and to cast their votes under- 
 standingly. 

From a knowledge of chemistry they could analyze 
 their soils — and at once become aware of its consti- 
 tuents ; then they would know without fear of going 
 wrong, what manure to use, and in what quantity 
 to apply it, to ensure tlie most productive soil for 
 any specified crops. 

Under the present management, farmers grope in 
 tlie dark— stable manure and lime are applied to all 
 soils, no matter whether it is clay, loam or sand, — 
 and in some instances, to my personal knowledge, 
 with manifest detriment to the crops. Entomology 
 is another branch of science with which formers
