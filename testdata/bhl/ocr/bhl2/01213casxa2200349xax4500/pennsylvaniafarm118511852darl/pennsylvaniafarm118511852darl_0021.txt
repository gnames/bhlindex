The committee, consisting of Frederick Watts and 
 J. R. Ingorsoll, appointed to prepare an Address to 
 the People of Pennsylvania, reported the foUovring, 
 which was unanimously adopted by the Executive 
 Committee : 

TO THE PEOPLE OF PENNSYLVANIA. 
 That business of life which directly occupies the 
 attention of three-fourths of mankind, and intimately 
 concerns all, demands the active influence of every 
 conscientious man. There is no art or science in the 
 whole circle of human knowledge, which presents fjr 
 exploration, so expansive and mtorestiug a field as 
 that of practical agriculture ; nor one whose discov- 
 eries already made have been so little infused into 
 the ordinary stock of knowledge of those who are ac- 
 tually engaged in its daily and universal operation. 
 The farmer knows the necessity for ploughing his 
 land, but he does not think and sufSciently understand 
 why he ploughs it; and the latter is quite as impor- 
 tant as the f jrmer, sothat he may know how to plough 
 leell. That manure will enrich the soil is a fact: but 
 to know what it is, how and when to use it, and how 
 it contributes to the growth of plants, is that kind of 
 knowledge which is only second to the fact itself. The 
 farmer has a certain amount of knowledge of seed 
 time and sowing ; but if nature's operations in tlio 
 germination of seed and the growth of plants were to 
 some extent infused into his daily observations and 
 reflections, his vigorous and ever active mind would 
 strike out some new path in his own pursuit, leading 
 td that profitable result which can only be attained 
 and relied upon when it can be traced to the blended 
 source of theoretical reason and practical experience. 

The appeal which we now make to those who are 
 engaged in the business of agriculture, and to all who 
 appreciate its importance, is not that you shall for a 
 moment relax those every day occupations of active 
 life to which you are accustomed, and which, prover- 
 bially, you pursue with so much industry; nor do wo 
 ask of you to delve, through the medium of books, 
 and laboratories, into the mysteries of Agricultural 
 Science ; but we do earnestly solicit you to unite with 
 us, in the efi'ort now being made, to establish and 
 cherish that which may be justly deemed the only 
 means by which the farmer may be made to keep 
 pace with the rest of mankind, in that march of im- 
 provement of which this age has been so prolific. 

Agricultural Societies, because of the influence 
 they have exercised, and commensurate benefits they 
 have bestowed upon every community where they 
 exist, commend themselves to universal approbation ; 
 the light which they have shed, and their capacity 
 for disseminating it, seem to point them out as the 
 only active agency by which the business of the farm- 
 er shall bo so cared for, that he may derive all the ad- 
 vantages which shall be developed by time and ex- 
 perience. Let no man wrap himself up in the selfish 
 security of his own knowledge, or console himself 
 witli the reflection, that his influence would not be 
 felt, but rather let him manfully step forth, with the 
 determined purpose, zealously, to aid in the prosecu- 
 tion of a work which promises so much practical use- 
 fulness. 

The late convention which assembled at Harris- 
 burg, has taken the initiatory measures for the esta- 
 blishment of the "Pennsylvania State Agricultural 
 Society ;" its constitution has been adopted, and its 
 officers elected. Upon those oflicers as an Executive 
 Committee, the duty is devolved to "keep such gen- 

eral charge of the aS'airs of the society as may best 
 promote its interests." It is in this capacity that wo 
 now call your attention to the subject, and ask you 
 to unite and co-operate with us in the measures which 
 have been adopted to insure a successful issue.

Agriculture and Geology. 

Tlic subject of Agricultural Geology is new, but the 
 age has passed away, in this country, when old errors 
 were preferred to new truths. I should, first, express iry 
 sincere desire that the Farm Journal may prove useful 
 in agricultural Science (for agriculture is entitled to a 
 place, and name, among the fixed Science's) the most 
 useful, and honorable, of all scientific pursuits, viewed 
 theoretically or practically. The word Geology is de- 
 rived from two Greek words, the one meaning the earth, 
 the other a description or history, so that Geology is a 
 description of the earth ; although it has special refer- 
 ence to changes and the laws governing the changes of 
 the earth's surface. 

None will deny the importance of a knowledge of the 
 earth, its soil, minerals, and rocks either to the practi- 
 cal or scientific farmer. The man who has the most 
 thorough acquaintance with ploughs, or anvils, other, 
 things being equal, will make the best use of them. So 
 it must follow that he who has the most thorough know- 
 ledge of the earth, its laws, and ingredients, other things 
 being equal, will be best qualified to cultivate its soil. 
 In agriculture, as in all things else, it is not knowledge, 
 hut, in too many oases, the want of i-, which prevents 
 persons from effecting their desired ends and objects. 
 Agricultural chemistry, for the last few years, has en- 
 grossed, and very justly too, a large share of public at- 
 tention and agricultural geology will not fail to be equal 
 ly useful. 

In this essay, (somewhat of a general or introductory 
 nature,) I would call attention to the relation of animal 
 and vegetable life in different forms, to the globe on 
 which we live. It is a singular fact that a connection has 
 been observed between different varieties of aniinal and 
 vegetable life, and the two important motions of the 
 earth, the one annual around the sun, the otherdiurnil 
 on its own axis. Mariners who have explored regions 
 near the North pole, where the day and night are weeks 
 or months in length, have found it necessiiry to sleep so 
 many hours, and at a period corresponding to the rota- 
 tion of the earth on its axis; and those who sleep in the 
 day and not in the night feel the ill effects of it. The 
 whole class of periodical diseases can only be explained 
 on the principle of the relation of man's life to the earth's 
 motions. The gravitating force of the earth, and the 
 projectile force of the earth resulting from its rotation 
 on its axis, have an important connection with the cir- 
 culation of the blood, in the human system. The growth 
 and falling off of the hair of many animals, will in most 
 cases, be found to be periodical, and these periods will 
 be seen to have reference to the annual motion of the 
 planet on which we live. 

Vegetable life, will be found to have a more decidedly 
 marked relation to the motions of the earth than that of 
 animals. Every one doubtless has observed that one 
 flower will bloom in the evening ; another in morning ; 
 a third at noon ; and a fourth at midnight. These flow- 
 ers will observe the time of their blooming as punctually 
 as a clock. Linnaeus, the celebrated botanist, construct- 
 ed a floral clock by bringing a variety of flowers togeth- 
 er, blooming at different hours of the day, and in this 
 manner the opening and closing of flowers would indi- 
 cate the hour. Here, a connection between the life and 
 existence of the plant liearing the flowers, and the daily 
 motion of the earth on its axis, is clearly indicated. To 
 show the relation between vegetable life and the annual 
 motion of the earth ; I will produce an example of this
