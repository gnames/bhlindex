The Potato. 

The season for planting this valuable Vegetable Xuber, 
 18 approaching, and although much information in re- 
 gard to it has been published in Tarious works, it is to 
 lie regretted that more attention has not been bestowed 
 upon it,cspecially with respect to the selection of good seed 

Instead of raising fine white mealy Potatoes, which al- 
 ways bring a good price in market, many persons con- 
 tent themselves with raising mongrel varieties of the 
 most indifferent kinds, which are hard to boil, and pasty, 
 although it is as easy to raise superior vegetables as 
 inferior ones, each requiring the same amount of time, 
 labor, and attention. The seedling should always be of 
 the largest, free from all blemishes, of only one variety, 
 and having the wounds caused by cutting, well dried be- 
 fore planting. 

The Potato may be divided into three distinct parts: 
 the crown, the body or middle part, and the base. Each 
 of these if planted separately, will produce at different 
 periods and of various sizes and qualities, — facts which 
 have fallen under my own observation. The crown or 
 small end is full of eyes and produces potatoes from 8 to 
 10 da3's earlier than any of the other parts, and of a su- 
 perior quality, so that this part should invariably be 
 planted alone. The body or middle of the potato, (which 
 may be divided in two or three pieces according to the 
 size of the tuber) produces fine large potatoes of the 
 Bame quality as tlie parent ; whilst the produce of the 
 base is but small and of an indifferent quality, and should 
 therefore always be rejected, and fed in a boiled state 
 to the animals of the farm. 

The good or bad quality of the Potato, frequently de- 
 pends upon the seasons and soil, which may not be fa- 
 vorable to its full growth and maturity — either too wet, 
 or too dry, — or the soil not properly emiched with veg- 
 etable compost; but still more depends upon the proper 
 selection of the seed. Good mealy potatoes will repro- 
 duce their kind, but no good tubers can be expected 
 from such as have a yellow pulp or boil tough and pasty, 
 ■whatever care may be bestowed upon their cultiva- 
 tion. Like produces like, and it is therefore indispensably 
 necessary in order to raise a good and palatable variety 
 of potatoes, to cultivate none but the best.

[For producing early potatoes, Mr. K. Knight recom- 
 mends but one or two eyes to be left in the set or cut 
 •seed potato, and he states that if the principal eye be 
 placed uppermost, the shoots will be few and early, as 
 well as sti'ong, but if placed differently, they will be late 
 and weak. Mr. Appleby (quoted iu the Farmer's Cabi- 
 net, vol. 8 pp. 211 ; see also pp. 155) states that mealiness 
 in potatoes arises from over ripeness, the tubers not being 
 taken up until the tops are quite dead ; but whilst this 
 adapts them for the table, it injures those intended to be 
 planted the succeeding year, so that the latter should be 
 taken up whilst the tops are still green. The tops of up- 
 land potatoes and those of cold districts, being killed by 
 the frost before the germinating principle is affected by 
 over-ripeness, it is generally believetf that the occasion- 
 al superiority of these for propagation arises from intrin- 
 Bic differences.— Ed.] 

Grafting Grape- Vines. — A. M., (Detroit.) Bury 
 your grafts in a cool, shady place, covering two-thirds 
 of the lower part, till the stocks that you wish to graft 
 have begun to grow, and their leaves are as large as 
 a shilling. Then graft, and you will be successful. 
 The great flow of sap, almost destitute of organizable 
 matter, in the grapo-vino, often prevents the graft 
 from uniting with the stock, when set at the usual 
 time. — Horticulturist.

Fowtli Animal Report of tlie Board of Agrirullure of 
 the State of Ohio. Columbus, 1850. pp. 304. 

This stout volume is an evidence of the vigor with 
 which agricultural improvement is prosecuted in Ohio. 
 It has been prepared under the general " Act for the 
 encouragement of Agriculture," by tho " Ohio State 
 Board of Agriculture," and opens with a general ac- 
 count of the subject by M. L. Sullivant, President of 
 the hoard, including a number of valuable sugges- 
 tions. The first section of tho " Act" provides that 
 when a County Society has secured a sum of from 
 $50 to $200 (under certain restrictions,) a similar 
 stun may be drawn from the county treasury, the 
 money to he applied to awarding premiums " for the 
 improvement of soils, tillage, crops, manures, imple- 
 ments, stock, articles of domestic industry &c." The 
 County Societies are governed by a uniform set of 
 rules, and thoy prepare accounts of the condition of 
 Agriculture, which are sent to tho central board to 
 be used in preparing the annual reports to the Legis- 
 lature. 

The Board reported a premium list oitTiree thousand 
 dollars, to be competed for at the State Fair held at 
 Cincinnati, on the 11th 12th and 13th September 1850. 
 The nature of tho premiums may bo judged from the 
 following examples : — for the best hull $20 ; best cow 
 $15 ; best yoke of oxen $15 ; best sheep $10 ; &o., for 
 various grades ; best pair of matched horses $20 ; 
 second $10 ; best lot (or pair) of various fowls $3 
 each lot ; best plow of 7 different kind $7 each. The 
 premiums extend to a great variety of implements, 
 down to hay forks, wash-hoards and axes ; and to 
 maple sugar, salt, linen, carpets, mittens, quilts, 
 needle work, bonnets, &c., so that skill in a great 
 many departments may meet with an acknowledg- 
 ment. Many of the premiums go to the Horticultural 
 and to the Mechanical Departments. 

Most of the volume is devoted to replies of the 
 County Societies (or of individuals) to a list of queries 
 under nineteen heads, and these show the condition 
 of agriculture in most of the counties of the state, in 
 alphabetical order. The replies occupy from half a 
 page to five pages, and in some cases all the queries 
 are not answered. As useful examples of the mode 
 of preparing the replies, we abstract those of two 
 counties, one on account of its meagreness, and the 
 other for its fulness.
