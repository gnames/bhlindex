FARM JOURNAL. 

April, 

Of the indirect benefits to the agricultural class from 
 Buch an exploration, little need be said, they are such as 
 Trill be shared in to a greater or less extent by every 
 citizen, and must be acknowledged as soon as hinted at. 
 One of the most obvious of these is the operation of such 
 a survey to render coal abundant and cheap, for the 
 various important uses for which the farmer must have 
 fuel, such as the burning of lime, the making of bricks, 
 or the furnishing his neighborhood with steam, saw, 
 and grist mills, in the absence of water power. To these 
 advantages let us add the preservation of his wood for 
 fencing, building, and other uses than burning, and the 
 liberty it gives him to appropriate a large share of his 
 land to growing crops, while a less share is given to grow- 
 ing timber. 

13ut probably the most important indirect boon con- 
 ferred on the agriculture of a country by geological 
 developments, is the influence these have, by stimulating 
 its mining activity, to attract population inland, and to 
 create thereby home markets for the produce of the soil. 
 Not to wander to England and Belgium for proofs, in 
 the extraordinary pictures there presented of this quick- 
 ening influence on agriculture, it is only necessary for 
 us to look at home, to the prosperity which already 
 smiles in the lied Shale and other vallies which begirt 
 our anthracite coal fields, to witness the happy results of 
 the ties which bind the welfare of the great class who 
 till the surface, to that of the population who delve for 
 other riches beneath it. 

It is too obvious for argument that a map and descrip- 
 tion which display in their true position all the varieties 
 of strata, and consequently their soils within our bor- 
 ders, must be a most valuable aid in exhibiting our agri- 
 cultural means of wealth, and for inviting hither the 
 best class of settlers. We have lost much desirable 
 population by the undue prominence given to western 
 lands, which do not compare so favorably with our own 
 as to compensate for the peculiar disadvantages to which 
 they expose emigrants from New England and from 
 Europe. We might refer to many examples of a sudden 
 impulse given to agriculture, by the publication of the 
 results of geological surveys. Several striking instances 
 are presented to our thoughts. One relates to the marl 
 region of New Jersey, where the farms have been enrich- 
 ed, and their produce multiplied by the disclosures of 
 the true character and extent of beds of green sand or 
 marl, by Professor H. D. Rogers; and the other has re- 
 ference to the old farms of Eastern Virginia, which 
 have been revived since Professor William B. Rogers 
 made known the abundant deposits of calcareous marl of 
 that portion of the State. Indeed the emigration to that 
 worn-out region from the northern and eastern states, 
 has been excited mainly, by the prospect of benefits de- 
 pendent upon the marl manures. Vie may also mention, 
 that methods employed in the Netherlands, converted 
 the most barren sands into fruitful fields. And even 
 the white drifted sands of Cape Cod are now changing to 
 bright green fields, and much of the credit is due to a 
 geological report made by Professor Hitchcock, of Mass , 
 who was ambitious to point out means to make two 
 blades of grass, or two ears of corn grow, where but one 
 grew before. 

First biennial Iteport on the Oeoiogy of Alabama. 
 By M. Tuomey, Geologist to the State ; Professor of 
 Geology, Mineralogy, and Agricultural Chemistry 
 in the University of Alabama. Tuskaloosa, 1850, 
 p. 176. 

We are indebted to his excellency Henry W. Col- 
 lier, Governor of Alabama, for a copy of this Report, 
 ■which is very creditable both to the State, and to the 
 geologist to ■whom this important trust has been con- 
 fided. Mr. Tuomey, was previously identified with 
 the science of the country by his Report on the Geology 
 of South Carolina, published under the authority of 
 that state in 1848. 

The survey of Alabama ■was placed under the charge 
 of the professor of Geology &e., in the State Universi- 
 ty, and it ■was made one of the duties of the professor 
 to spend four months in each year in exploring the 
 state — a plan ■which has been recently adopted by the 
 state of Mississippi, and ■which may be employed ■with 
 advantage in ■working up the final details of the geology 
 of the northern states, ■when they become sufficiently 
 enlightened to have professors of geology and agri- 
 cultural chemistry in their colleges. The expenses of 
 the Alabama survey have been thus far paid by the 
 university. 

Eleven authors had devoted themselves to an eluci- 
 dation of the geology of various parts of Alabama, 
 previous to the regular labors of Mr. Tuomey, and 
 one of these, Mr. T. A. Conrad, published a small 
 map in which the gi-eat features ■were roughly repre- 
 sented. The present Keport contains a good map 
 giving a large amount of details, and showing great 
 industrj' in the field work, if we take the limited time 
 employed into consideration. The principal forma- 
 tions are clearly traced to the borders of Mississippi, 
 so that with the labors of Lyell, Coni-ad, and de Ver- 
 nouil, the investigation of the latter state will be much 
 simplified. 

Unfortunately, the Legislature of South Carolina 
 did not sanction the publication of figures of the or- 
 ganic remains, although catalogues are given, as well 
 as of the living animals of the state. But aware of 
 the importance of a knowledge of recent species in 
 the investigation of those fossils most nearly allied to 
 them, Mr. Tuomey gave a list of the shells now ex- 
 isting upon the Carolina coast, and it is to be hoped 
 that between the states of Alabama and Mississippi, 
 such arrangements will be made, that the public will 
 get a full scientific ■\-iew of the relations existing be- 
 tween the living productions of the gulf of Mexico, 
 and their fossil analogues in the tertiary formations 
 somewhat like those developed by Mr. Forbes ; from 
 his dredgings in the Aegean sea. The facts develop- 
 ed l.iy such means would be of the greatest sciontifio 
 value, whether viewed according to the theory of 
 Lyell, or that of Agassiz, which is diametrically op- 
 posed to it. It is hardly necessary to say that we 
 must look to the Southern states for an investigation 
 of these questions, because the tertiary formations 
 have received their full development there. 

Alabama is well supplied ■with bituminous coal, 
 which can be delivered at Mobile by river navigation 
 at a small expense, so that it must in time become a 
 great source of profit, besides favoring various indus- 
 trial pursuits. It is also rich in other valuable min- 
 erals. 

The geological map was lithographed in New York, 
 which is somewhat singular, as excellent work of the 
 same kind can be executed nearer home, in the 
 establishment of Weber in Baltimore.
