Most ornithologists refer tlie greater part of domestic fowls to the wild Javanese Oalixs bankiva, which 
 is considered the original of Brisson's G. domestica, of which the hlacli-footed is preferred to the yellow- 
 footed kind ; G. cristatus ; G. pusillus ; G. banticus, the bantam or haniy; and G. pumilio, probably the creejiij. 

Gallus soneratii, a wild East Indian species was supposed to be the original of the domestic races un- 
 til Temminck investigated the subject. This species has the habits of tlio domestic kinds. 

Gallus cicantecs (the hulm ovjayo) is supposed to be the original of what are named Polish fowls in 
 English, and in French coq russe (although this is not a Russian variety) coq de Caux, coq de Padoue {Pa,- 
 dua,) coq de Ehodes, and coq de Perse (Persia). We quote these names, (which are not given by Dixon, 
 Browne, &c.) to enable such of our readers as arc interested, to consult French works upon the subject. In 
 fact, it frequently happens that difficulties arise in tracing domestic animals, varieties of fruit, Â«S;o., from one 
 country to another, because sufficient attention is not always paid to get the names under which corres- 
 ponding varieties are known.
