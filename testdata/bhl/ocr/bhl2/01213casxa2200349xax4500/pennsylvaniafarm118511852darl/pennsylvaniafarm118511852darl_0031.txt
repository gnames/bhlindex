many, and is by some referred to the ordinaiy domes- 
 tic species. G. japonicus (or G. lanatus) is found 
 in China, Japan, and New Guinea ; G. deneus is 
 from Sumatra ; G. crispus lias frizzled feathers, and 
 being from the warm parts of Asia, does not well en- 
 dure a cold climate ; G. fcrcatus is from Java and 
 Sumatra ; and the rumpless G. ecaudatus or bunty, 
 inhabits the forests and plains of Ceylon. 

Among the various breeds of chickens the Shang- 
 hae (the last syllable of this word is pronounced high) 
 is considered the best on many accounts, being pro- 
 lific in eggs, of a large size, with tender flesh. The 
 Rev. Mr. Bumstead, of Eoxborough, one of Dr. 
 Kerr's correspondents, says:— "I hazard nothing in 
 saying that if the farmers of Pennsylvania knew the 
 worth of these fowls, no efibrt would be spared to ob- 
 tain them." He states further, that one Shanghas 
 cock and two hens will produce " more eggs in three 
 months time, of a greater size and richer quality, 
 than five times that number of ordinary hens will do 
 in one year." 

Most ornithologists refer the domestic goose to the 
 wild Anser palustris, which breeds in Europe, and 
 is known in England as the grey lag, a name adopt- 
 ed by Pennant and Montagu, and although these au- 
 thors state that the legs are flesh colored, Mr. Dixon 
 adopts the name of " grey-legged goose." 

This book may be safely recommended to those 
 who are interested in poultry, whilst its fine illustra- 
 tions, mechanical esecution, and useful information, 

will render it an attractive volume to the general 
 reader. 

AVe are enabled, through the politeness of the pub- 
 lishers, to present our readers witli several copies of 
 the figures which illustrate the volume, but as the 
 originals are printed as separate plates, they present 
 a finer appearance than our impressions. 

Chickens and the CurcuUo. 

A. G. Sumner of Ravenscroft, South Carolina, in 
 an interesting communication, gives the following aa 
 his method of guarding his fine fruit trees against the 
 attack of the Cureulio. The remedy is so simple, so 
 effectual, and may be made so profitable that it 
 should be universally adopted. 

" For plums, apricots and nectarines, so liable to 
 the attacks of the curonlio, there is no remedy but 
 poultry. Plant these where your poultry have a 
 daily run amongst them. I have adopted this plan, 
 and have not found a single tree attacked by the root- 
 worm in my grounds. It takes more than a dozen 
 hens and a gouty old cock to keep a few acres of 
 these delicate trees clear of their enemies. A flock of 
 a hundred is not too many : I find them a valuable 
 auxiliary in manuring, as I consider domestic hai 
 guano, properly tempered down, a good manure for 
 trees the second year of their growth in the orchard. 
 I have now twenty barrels gathered from about one 
 hundred and fifty fowls since September last. My 
 mode is to have "the hen-house carefully scraped up 
 once a week and packed with the underlying earth in 
 old lime barrels, covered with a top layer of gypsum. 
 It is practicable to save this powerful manure in the 
 winter ; but as I make my fowls resort to nature's 
 hen-houses —the trees — in^summer, the greater por- 
 tiou is wasted or washed away by the rains. "^
