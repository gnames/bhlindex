tlian the milker generally possesses, or if a little too 
 short, not heavy. If she stands a little long on the 
 logs, it must not be too long. The thighs somewhat 
 thin, with a slight tendency to crookedness^ in tho 
 hock, or being sickle-hammed behind : the tail thick 
 at the upper part, but tapering below ; and she should 
 iiave a mellow hide, and little coarse hair. Com- 
 mon opinion has given to her large milk-veins ; and 
 although the milk-vein has nothing to do with the 
 udder, but conveys the blood from the fore part of 
 the chest and sides to the inguinal vein, yet a large 
 milk-vein certainly indicates a strongly developed 
 vascular system — one favorable to secretion general- 
 ly, and to that of the milk among the rest. 

The last essential in a milch cow is the udder, 
 rather large in proportion to tho size of the animal, 
 but not too large. It must be sufficiently capacious 
 to contain the proper quantity of milk, but not too 
 Inilky, lest it should thicken and become loaded with 
 fat. " The skin of the udder should be thin, and free 
 from lumps in every part of it. The teats should be 
 of moderate size ; at equal distances from each other 
 every w.ay ; and of equal size from the udder to near- 
 ly the end, where they should run to a kind of point. 
 When they are too large near the udder, they permit 
 the milk to flow down too freely from the bag, and 
 lodge in them ; and when they are too broad at the 
 extremity, the orifice is often so large that the cow 
 cannot retain her milk after the bag begins to be full 
 and heavy. The udder should be of nearly equal size 
 liefore and behind, or, if there be any difference, it 
 should be broader and fuller before than behind. 

The quantity of milk given by some of these cows 
 is very great. It is by no means uncommon for them, 
 in the beginning of the summer, to yield 30 quarts a 
 day ; there are rare instances of their having given 
 36 quarts ; but the average may be estimated at 22 
 or 24 quarts. It is said that this milk does not yield 
 a proportionate quantity of butter. That their milk 
 does not contain the same proportionate quantity of 
 butter as that from the long-horns, the Scutch cattle 
 of the Devons, is probably true ; but we have reason 
 to believe that the difference has been much exagger- 
 ated, and is more than compensated by the additional 
 quantity of milk. The prejudice against them on 
 this account was very great, and certain experiments 
 were made, by the result of which it was made to ap- 
 pear that the milk of the Kyloe cow yielded double 
 the quantity of butter that could be produced from 
 that of the short-horn. .Two ounces were obtained 
 from tho milk of the Kyloe, and one from that of tho 
 short-horn. 

Tobacco Dust. — As a protection against Insects. — 
 We last year procured from a snuff mill a barrel of 
 dry, but damaged snuff flour, and prepared drudging 
 boxes, covered with a fine bolting cloth, with wliich 
 wc sifted it over the surfaces of any plants attacked 
 by insects, and with most signal success. The suuff 
 should be applied, if practicable, while the plant is 
 wet with dew, and repeated after every shower. If 
 tho boxes are properly made, (like a common flour 
 drudge,) and the snuff is perfectly fine and dry, liut 
 little time is necessary to go over an acre of plants. 
 Even the rose bug, cabbage louse, thrips on grape 
 vines, &c., all yield to the influence of suuff, and the 
 most delicate plant of the hot-house is not injured by 
 its application. For field vcgctaljls, caustic lime, 
 made into a fine powder, while dry, and applied be- 
 fore slaking by contact with the air, will produce 
 einiilar results. — Frof. Mapes,

The General Hand Plum. 

Mi: Editor :■ — I saw in the last number of the Gen- 
 essee Farmer, a brief account of the General Hand 
 Plum, from which it appears that there is still some 
 doubt or obscurity about the origin and history of 
 that beautiful fruit. 

In consequence of an intimation from- my friend 
 Dr. J. K. Eshelman, of Downingstown, Chester coun- 
 ty. Pa., that doubts as to the color of the Gen. Hand 
 Plum, existed in the minds of some of the Pomologists 
 of the East ; some contending that it was blue, and 
 oth^s that it was a white fruit ; I sent a few plums, 
 taken from the tree in my yard in the early part of 
 September, 1848, to Mr. J. A. Downing, editor of the 
 Horticulturist, a very valuable periodical published 
 in Albany, N. Y., in which may be found the follow- 
 ing description, p. 191, vol. 3 : — " It is a magnificent 
 fruit, averaging larger, we should judge, than tho 
 Washington, and quite distinct from all other sorts. 
 It is a roundish oval fruit, measuring from six to sev- 
 en inches in circumference* ; of a deep golden yellow 
 color, with a much longer stalk than the Washington. 
 The flavor is, we think, not equal to that of the lat- 
 ter fruit ; but as we learn that it is a much greater 
 bearer, its size and beauty will, no doubt, make it a 
 popular variety." 

GENERAL HAND PLUBI. 

[We have procured a cut of this extraordinary 

Plum, a copy of which we found in the Gennessee 

Farmer for April. — Ed.] 

As my object in this communication is to endeav- 
 or to establish beyond a doubt, that the plum called 
 the Gen. Hand Plum, first received th.at name in the 
 county of Lancaster, and not in Maryland ; I called 
 on Mrs. Brien of our city, a daughter of the late Gen. 
 Edward Hand, from wliom I learned that he took 
 great pains in collecting and cultivating choice fruit 
 trees. She remembers his planting a number of 
 small plum trees, but she cannot tell where he got 
 them. Plums were very rare in this vicinity at that 
 time. She also suggested that I might learn some- 
 thing further relative to the matter, by calling on Jlr. 
 Benedict, an aged and respectable citizen of our
