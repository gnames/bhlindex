place, who informed me yesterday, that in the au- 
 tumn of 1791, he assisted in plastering the mansion 
 house of the late Gen. Hand, on the Conestoga, alwut 
 one mile S. E. of Lancaster ; and he remembers that 
 the plum trees wore planted before that time ; but 
 that they were still quite small, and had not borne 
 any fruit. He said that George Wein, procured some 
 grafts from the tree on Gen. Hand's place, and gave 
 Sir. George Miller, the present clerk of the Lancaster 
 market, some of them. 

I called on Mr. Miller this afternoon, and he told 
 me that in 1810 or 1811, Mr. George Weiu procured 
 about a dozen grafts from Geo. Hand, (who was al- 
 ways very liberal to his neighbors in such matters,) 
 and gave him two of them at his request — one a young 
 shoot, the other a year old piece, with one lateral bud 
 on it, and that one grew, but threw out no latteral 
 branches that season. Mr. "Weiu was not so fortu- 
 nate. None of his grew ; and the following spring 
 he applied to Mr. Jliller for grafts, but declined ; giv- 
 ing as a reason the fact that he could not cut off any 
 grafts without spoiling his tree. During the second 
 Bummer there had been some latteral branches 
 thrown out, and Mr. Miller furnished Mr. Wein with 
 a few of them ; but he was equally unfortunate in 
 his second attempt to propogate them. That summer 
 the parent tree died to the ground, so that in 1812 or 
 1813, we find all that beautiful variety of fruit con- 
 centrated in one little stalk, grown from the lateral 
 hud on one of the grafts given to Mr. Geo. Miller by 
 Mr. Wein. From that circumstance, they were for 
 a a time, called the " Miller Plum," until Mr. Miller 
 objected to that name, and said that it was " Gen, 
 Hand's plum." From that time to the present they 
 have Ijeen so called. 

Some years afterwards, Mr. Emanuel W. Carpen- 
 ter, procured some cuttings from Mr. Miller, and suc- 
 ceeded in propagating them, and as he told me, sent 
 them to his brother in Ohio, Mr. Sinclair, in Balti- 
 more, and others. Thus it appears to me, that some 
 pomologists have improperly given Baltimore the 
 credit of the nativity of this superb plum, which 
 properly belongs to Lancaster county. Pa. In 1834 
 or 1835, I procured one " Gen. Hand plum tree" and 
 a White Pi-une tree from Mr. Carpenter, and plant- 
 ed them in my yard, and which I afterwards paved. 
 They both grew well and bore fruit plentifully, and I 
 have distributed many cuttings from both varieties, 
 as I consider them very valuable fruit. The White 
 Pruen tree died a few years since, and as yet I have 
 been unable to supply its place witli one of the same 
 variety. The " Gen. Hand j)lum" tree is still quite 
 thrifty, and has always yielded a full crop of fruit. — 
 When fully ripe,, the fruit is very mellow and juicy, 
 from which circumstance, they do not bear the sting 
 of insects well. I have seen large plums decay ra- 
 pidly after being wounded. So rapid, indeed, was 
 the progress of decay that by the end of the second 
 day, after I discovered the wound, the plum would 
 be half decayed. I think that fewer rotted last 
 summer than usual ; and more fruit ripened perfect- 
 ly ; which may, perhaps, be owing to our having 
 gathered the specked fruit every day and destroying 
 them, thereby preventing the maturity of the ovum 
 deposited in tliem. Eli PiRBr.

 New Mode of Battling the Peach Worm. 

A. 3. DowNixG, Esq. — I noticed some time ago, in 
 your book on Fruits and Fruit Trees of America, an 
 article on the subject of planting fruit trees, in whicli 
 you advise that the trees should be so set in the ground 
 as to bring the upper roots on a line with the sur- 
 face of the earth. I liked the suggestion much, 
 and in settingout anumborof young plums and peach 
 trees, I adopted it. I have, however, suflered great- 
 ly from the destructive little grub which attacks the 
 collar or root of peach and plum trees, and had tried 
 various means which had occurred to me as remedies 
 such as unslacked or powdered lime, ashes, tobacco, 
 hot lye, and pot-ash — all I found to be inefficient. — 
 Last May I gave my trees a thorough over-hauling, 
 or examination, and found an incalculable number of 
 these grubs at their work of destruction and death 
 about the collar and roots. I then tried another ex- 
 periment, which I found to answer the purpose ad- 
 mirably, so far. It is as follows : 

I commenced by removing the earth from around 
 the roots, so as to form a circle round the tree, and 
 make a basin of a foot in width and four inches deep 
 I then procured a quantity of rock lime, and slacked 
 it, reducing it to the consistency of very thick wliito 
 wash, and after letting it stand in this state for a day 
 I poured it into this basin, completely filling up the 
 interstices about the roots. In a short time this lime 
 was formed into a hard crust, which served not only 
 as an efi'ectual bar to the entrance of the grub during 
 the whole season, but what is almost equally impor- 
 tant, I found last fall upon removing this lime from 
 its bod, that the wounds, (and some of them were 
 quite serious ones,) which I had inflicted on the base 
 of the tree in removing the grubs, were healed up, 
 and in as good and healthy condition as any part of 
 the tree ; and now my trees are in a more healthful 
 and promising condition than they ever have been. 
 This process of liming, however, should be renewed 
 every spring. 

I do not know whether this expei-iment of mine is 
 original, but can confidently say that I never saw or 
 heard of its having Ijeen tried before. But be this as 
 it may, the information is before you, and if you think 
 it will in any degree promote the interest of horticul- 
 ture, it is at your service. 

Very respectfully your ob't serv't

 Baisiug Early Peas. 

The course prescribed by your correspondent in 
 the March number, for starting peas early, is certain- 
 ly a good one, and worthy of the adoption of every 
 lover of so rich and healthful a vegetable. We have 
 have tried another plan to effect the same results, 
 which, althought it may be no better, we have no hes- 
 itancy in commending to at least a trial. In the first 
 place we dig a trench where we design to plant our 
 peas, to a depth of, say six inches. This we fill two- 
 thirds full of recent horse manure, and make it as 
 compact as possible, wliich will leave a space of three 
 or four inches between it and the surfiice. Over the 
 the manure, put an inch and a half of tlie garden 
 earth, and sow the peas. We then take two straight 
 edged boards and nail them together in the form of a 
 Y. Itis is laid, inverted, over the peas, when it is
