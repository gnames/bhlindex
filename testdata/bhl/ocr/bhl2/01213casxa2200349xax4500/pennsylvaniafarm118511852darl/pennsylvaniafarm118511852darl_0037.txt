OUR TERMS—READ THEM ! 

In order that the Farm Journal may be placed 
 within the reach of every one who feels interested iu 
 the progress of Agriculture, vre ask attention to the 
 following terms : — 

Single Copies, - $1 00 Per Aiiiuim. 

Five " - - 4 0(> " " 

Ten " - 7 50 '• " 

Twenty « - - 15 OO " " 

It is not required that all papers in a club should 
 be sent to one office. We will mail them (in wrap- 
 pers,) to as many different offices as may bo necessa- 
 ry. We make this arrangement in order that persons 
 residing in different neigborhooda may unite, and 
 form large clubs, and thus secure the " Journal" at 
 the very lowest club rates. 

Sj)ccimen copies of the Journal will be sent on ap- 
 plication, Post-paid, to the publisher. 

Post Masters, are by law, authorized to remit sub- 
 scription money to the publisher, free of postayc. — 
 Particular attention is asked to this fact, as it will 
 save expense both to subscribers and publisher. 

Our Terms are cash in advance. The exceedingly 
 low rate at which the Journal is furnished renders 
 this imperative. Subscriptions may be sent at our 
 risk, and money at par where subscribers reside, will 
 be taken. Where the sum to be sent is large we pre- 
 fer that a draft should be procured, if possible. 

Subscribers and Post Masters are invited to act as 
 Agents. A receipt will always be sent with the first 
 number of the copy subscribed for. 

All letters must be addressed, post ptaid, to the pub- 
 lisher. A. M. SPANGLE K,

Specimen Numbers. 

We shall send copies of the first number of The 
 Farm Journal, to such persons as we are led to be- 
 lieve feel desirous of subscribing themselves, or of 
 prevailing upon their friends and neighbors to do so. 
 A very little effort on their part, will secure a great 
 many subscribers ; and we earnestly request that they 
 will aid us in extending our circulation to every por- 
 tion of the State. The terms are so favorable, that 
 an hour's effort, rightly put forth, will secure a hand- 
 some club list, and at the same time a fair remunera- 
 tion to the person getting it up. 

Postage. 
 Letters enclosing original Communications may be 
 sent at our expense. All other Letters must be post 
 PAID. We are compelled to require this, as our Post- 
 age Bill has already become onerous.

A Few Facts for the People. 

The complete failure of every previous attempt to 
 establish in Pennsylvania, a successful Agricultural 
 paper led us to ponder long and well before engaging 
 in the publication of The Farm Journal. AVe care- 
 fully investigated the causes which led to the failure 
 of every similar attempt — we strove to ascertain the 
 correct sentiments of the friends of Agriculture on 
 the subject — we took counsel with kind friends whoso 
 opinions we valued, and after patient and persevering 
 inquiry were led to believe tluit the day had arrived 
 lelien Pennsylvania would support an Ayricultural 
 Journal of lur men. 

Under this impression, we issued our Prospectus, 
 and through the kindness of the members of both 
 branches of the Legislature, were enabled to circulate 
 it extensively in every portion of the State. The re- 
 sult was all we could have desired, and more than wo 
 anticipated. Kind friends sprung up in every quar- 
 ter — encouraging letters flowed in upon us — club lists 
 were formed and forwarded to us, and many of the 
 most intelligent, influential and devoted friends of 
 Agriculture in the State tendered their influence ia 
 behalf of our contemplated enterprise. 

With such encouragement we could no longer hes- 
 itate. The difficulties in the way have been removed, 
 and with a confident spirit we offer the first number of 
 THE FARM JODKNAL 

to the People of Pennsylvania, and ask for it a gener- 
 ous support. We appeal to Pennsylvania State Pride 
 for encouragement. We ask that the apathy hitherto 
 manifested in regard to our own Journals, may be 
 removed, and that our farmers and friends of Agri- 
 culture generally, will come to the rescue and aid us 
 in building up a publication, which, with proper en- 
 couragement, can, we feel confident, be made fully 
 equal to any other in the Union. AVe ask that our 
 thousands of able Agricultural writers, will give us 
 their support, and that the contributions which hitli- 
 erto, (for want of a Pennsylvania Journal) have en- 
 riched the columns of the Agricultural papers of oth- 
 er States, may now be given to the world through the 
 medium of The Farm Journal. 

This is asked in no spirit of selfishness, but because 
 it is clearly apparent, that upon a compliance with 
 this request, depends entirely, the success of our pa- 
 per. If our writers will assist us, nothing shall bo 
 left undone on our part, to render the Journal worthy 
 the confidence of the People of the Commonwealth, 
 whose great leading interests it is intended faithfully 
 to represent. In confirmation of this, we refer with 
 pride to the appearance of our first number. The 
 arrangement of the articles, it is true, is not such aa 
 was intended ; the late hour at which several commu- 
 nications were received, having interfered with our 
 t plans. In subsequent numbers this difficulty will be
