IMPORTANT TO FARMERS 
 And Thresbin^ Machine MaUers. 

THE subscriber respectfully begs leave to inform the public 
 that he has lately perfc-ctoda new Threshing Machine and Horse 
 Power, which in point of strength, durability, lightness of draught 
 and convenience in moving is not surpassed or equalled by any 
 Machine in the United States; he also confidently affirms that no 
 Machine of its strength and durability can be afforded as low — 
 The invention of this Machine hag been the result of several 
 years experience and hard study. We do not claim to have dis- 
 covered any new principle in philosophy — but we do claim to have 
 discovered a plan by which old philosophical principles are more 
 correctly and advantageously applied than on any other Machine. 
 This invention is secured by a caveat. 

These Machines can be had at L^racl W. Groff's Machine Shop 
 and at Prime Sc Colestock's Sash Factory in North Duke street, 
 Lancaster city, at retail or by wholesale on the most reaaonablo 
 terms. 

The Power weighs 600 pounds. It is made entirely of Iron with 
 Steel Journals, and is warranted to huld 8 Horses should it any 
 time be necessary to use so many. From 2 to 4 Horses are a suffic- 
 ient number for common threshing. We are about getting up 
 one much lighter for Shop purposes that will be the cheapest and 
 jii'jst convenient thing in use; it might also be used with 2 or 3 
 Horses for threshing; the Powers and Cylinders and Concave can 
 be had by the Machine makers throughout the country oa the 
 most reasonable terms. 

<J^« All orders directed to the subscriber at Lancaster city will 
 be thankfully received and promptly attended to.
