Entomology, or the study of insects, is interesting 
 on account of the vast number of species and indivi- 
 duals, and the great variations exhibited in their 
 structure and habits. Some are predacious, living 
 upon other insects ; some feeding upon decaying ani- 
 mal matter, and others upon decaying vegetables, 
 these acting as scavengers to remove offensive matter. 
 But the greater part live at the expense of vegeta- 
 bles, various species attacking every part, from the 
 root to the seed. 

It is chiefly Tvith the last that the farmer, gardener, 
 and forester are concerned, and in Europe the subject 
 has been deemed of sufficient importance to call for 
 national aid in making investigations and publishing 
 histories of insects in their relations to man. 

It is sometimes difficult to tell what insects are 
 hurtful and what beneficial, and in some cases a spe- 
 cies which was the destroyer of the real enemy has 
 been mistaken for the cause of the mischief Even 
 when a destructive larva is seen, the perfect insect 
 which comes from it may not be the species which 
 the larva should have produced, because the natural 
 enemies of some insert their eggs in the flesh of the 
 latter, upon which their young feed. The attacked 
 larva, before it dies, is often able to form a cocoon, 
 and from this the parasite makes its appearance. — 
 For these and similar reasons it is necessary to have 
 some knowledge of entomology to enable us to guard 
 against the insects likely to injure us. 

Wo intend to give an account of various insects in 
 a series of articles of which this is the first, and altho 
 the history of some of them may seem to have no 
 practical application, it must be remembered that a 
 knowledge of any species may throw light upon others, 
 and afford hints for their proper investigation. Most 
 general works on natural science published in this 
 country are devoted to foreign species which tho 

reader may never bo able to see, whilst the commoi>- 
 est American kinds are unrepresented. To remedy 
 this defect, we have determined to give figures illus- 
 trative of American species and habits, taken from 
 the specimens themselves. 

Elaphidion putator. — This is 'a small coleopter 
 (an insect with tlie true wings generally pi-otceted by 
 hard wing covers or elytra) of a brown color, with pale 
 scattered spots. The an- 
 tenna) are as long as tho 
 body in the female, a?id 
 longer in the male. The 
 larva lives in tho small 
 branches (generally in tho 
 centre,) of oak, hickory 
 and chosnut, forming a 
 flattened perforation some 
 Fig. 1. inches in length. The lar- 

va is a soft whitish grub, v>-ith stout black jaws, and 
 when it has attained its full 
 size (about the end of sum- 
 mer) it cuts the branch from 
 the tree by a tranverse cut, 
 leaving the bark entire. Th 
 storms of the fall and the 
 winter cause the branch to 
 fall with its tenant, but pre- 
 viously to tliis, it has nicely 
 closed tho end of its perfora- 
 tion with a plug made of 
 shreds of wood and suffieientr 
 ly close to exclude water. 

The annexed figure (2) re- 
 presents a fragment of a 
 branch of shellbark hickory 
 which was probably cut off 
 by a different species, at both 
 ends, with a plug (In) in each. 
 It is cut open to exhibit the 
 larva, which is represented 
 at [a). It has the anterior 
 end large, somewhat as in 
 the larva of buprestis. This
