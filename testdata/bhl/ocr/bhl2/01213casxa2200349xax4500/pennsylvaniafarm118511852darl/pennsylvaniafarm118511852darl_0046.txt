enlargement disappeara just before it cbangos to the 
 pupa state, and most of the specimens are found in 
 this condition about the middle of April in Pennsyl- 
 vauia. The larva has three pair of minute feet which 
 assists it in moving along its Ijurrow. 

The fragments of wood which it inhabits arc from 
 two to four inches long and the part to whicli it con- 
 fines itself when it closes the ends, is usually two or 
 tliree inclies in length. The plues are usually insortr 
 ed at the ends, altho' they are sometimes half an inch 
 from them. The fragments cut oif vary in tliicknoss 
 from the fourth of an inch to 
 an inch, and figure 3 es- 
 hiljits an end view of a 
 thick one. The mandibles' of 
 the imago or perfect insect 
 are sufficiently strong to en- 
 able it to eat its way out of 
 the prison it had constructed 
 for itself 
 Oncideres cingulatus. This insect was first de- 
 scribed by Say in the Journal of the Academy of 
 Natural Sciences, vol. 5 p. 272, 1825, and its habits 
 were discovered by us and published in our " Mate- 
 rials towards a History of the Coleoptera longicornia 
 of the United States;" Am. Phil. Trans, vol. 10, p. 
 52, 1837. 
 "in our walks through the forest our attention was fre- 
 quently drawn to the branch- 
 es and main shoot of young 
 hickory trees (carta alba) 
 which were girdled with a 
 deep notch in such a manner 
 as to induce an observer to 
 believe that the object in view 
 was to kill the branch beyond 
 the notch ; and extraordinary 
 as it may appear, this is ac- 
 tually the fact, and the opera- 
 tor is an insect whose instinct 
 was implanted by the Al- 
 mighty power which created 
 it, and under such circum- 
 stances that it could never 
 have been acquired as a ha- 
 bit. Tho knowledge of gird- 
 ling is unknown to the insect, whose life is too short 
 to perceive its cfieots and to foresee the necessities of 
 ite progeny during the succeeding season. 

This insect may be seen in Pennsylvania during 
 the two last weeks in August and the first week 
 in September feeding upon the bark of the tender 
 branches of the young hickories. Both sexes are 
 rather rare, particularly the male, which is rather 
 smaller than the female, but with longer antennas. 

The female makes perforations in the branches of 
 tlio tree upon which she lives, which are from Iialf 
 an inch to less than a quarter of an inch thick, in 
 which she depositee her eggs; she then proceeds to 

gnaw a groove of about a tenth of an inch wide and 
 deep, around the branch, and below the place whera 
 the eggs are deposited, so that the exterior portion 
 dies and the larva feed upon the dead wood, a food 
 which is essential to many insects altho' but few have 
 the means of providing it for themselves or their pro- 
 geny by an instinct so remarkable. 

Were this insect abundant, it would cause much 
 damage to young forests of hoop-poles by the destruc- 
 tion of the principal shoot. We have known insects 
 which from their rarity, could hardly be regarded 
 as "noxious," increase to such an extent as to be 
 very destructive, and the locust trees (Robinia pseu- 
 dacacia) have had their foUage withered during the 
 few last summers from such a cause. Should the 
 insect in question increase so as to become trouble- 
 some, the infected branches should be cut off in July 
 and burnt.

 is a slightly modified representation of the top of a 
 hickory tree, from a specimen now Ijcfore us, which pre- 
 sents the unusual numljer of sis girdlings, which were 
 probably made in as many successive years. First 
 the principal shoot at a was cut, and before the young 
 shoot below it had acquired suflicient size to tempt an 
 attack, the second cut h was made; then c probably 
 followed, and a downward shoot was the result ; and 
 this being cut, e and f may have followed. As thÂ« 
 decaying portion which is not eaten by tlie larva is 
 apt from its tender attachment and the rapidity of
