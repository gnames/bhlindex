Corn Planting. 

[The following remarks were prepared as an ap- 
 pendix to Judge Hayes' article on page of tho last 
 number, but ommitted by the printer.] 

In soaking seed grain, care should bo taken not to 
 steep it too long, as it will bo likely to rot in the 
 ground, if there happens to be a spell of wet weather. 
 Judge Buel soaked his seed corn from twelve to 
 twenty hours in hot water, with a few ounces of salt- 
 petre dissolved in it ; and to eight quarts of seed he 
 afterwards added half pint of tar diluted in a quart 
 of warm water. After being stirred in the tar mix- 
 ture, the corn was taken out and mixed with as much 
 plaster as would stick to it. This preserved the seed 
 from birds &c., and caused it to germinate readily. — 
 The Genesee Farmer recommends a coating of soft 
 soap and plaster. 

Q,uack Medicines. 

Wq were annoyed at finding an advertisement of 
 u "cherry pectoral" on the cover of the first num- 
 ber, which was inserted whilst tho publisher was 
 at Ilarrisburg. The means to which the maker of 
 this nostrum resorts, may be judged from the follow- 
 ing caution from the cover of tho American Journal 
 of Science, the editor of which is represented with all 
 Ills titles of Professor, M. D., LL. D., &c., as the au- 
 thor of one of the recommendations given. 

As Professor Silliman is a doctor of Medicine, and 
 as some physicians occupy the very questionable 
 position of druggists, we are bound to state that it la 
 unprofessional to vend or advertise a nostrum tlie 
 maker of which uses the name of a member of tho 
 profession to deceive the public. 

TO THE PUBLIC. 

The recommendation of the Cherry Pecioral (so 
 ealled) signed by my name is a. forgery.

Encouragement. 

Almost every mail brings us encouraging commu- 
 nications from friends throughout the State; ah extract 
 from one of which we give below. With such friends 
 to sustain us we go on trustingly; feeling confident 
 that the effort we are making to build up a journal 
 worthy the support of the farmers of Pennsylvania, 
 will certainly prove successful: 

Greessburqu, Api-il 17, 1851. 

Sir: — I am greatly gratified by the appearance 
 and contents of the first number of the " Farm Jour- 
 nal," and sincerely hope that, with such excellent in- 
 ducement, the farmers of Pennsylvania may at length 
 prove that they are sensible of the advantages of 
 having a periodical of their own. I liave had pain- 
 ful and costly experience of the feet that many of the 
 suggestions of Agricultural papers puldished else- 
 where are so unsuited to our siiil and climate that 
 they are injurious rather than advantageous. This 
 is of itself, to say nothing of what of a decent self re- 
 spect seems to demand, a sufScient reason for giving 
 your journal that liberal support which is necessary 
 to make it worthy of the cause which it advocates and 
 the State in which it is published. 

Feeling a deep interest in the success of your pe- 
 riodical as connected with the agriculture of our 
 State, it will give me pleasure to contribute, by any 
 means within my power, to aid in securing that suc- 
 cess. 

Horticuitural Society's Medal. 
 The new medal of the Pennsylvania Horticultural 
 Society is a beautiful specimen of art, which must be 
 highly valued by those to whom it is a^varded as a 
 prize. It is two inches in diameter and contains a 
 seated figure of Pomona, her left hand resting upon 
 the shield of the arms of Pennsylvania, and her right 
 holding a pruning knife. In front a boy presenti 

Incorporation of the Pennsylvania State Agricultu- 
 ral Society. 

As the provisions of the act incorporating this So- 
 ciety do not appear to be generally understood, we 
 herewith present those most important to be knovTn. 
 The following is the principal section: 

"Resolved, That the sum of two thousand dollars is 
 hereby appropriated to said Society, and annually 
 thereafter a sum equal in amount to that paid by the 
 members thereof into its treasury; an affidavit of 
 which fact, and the amount so raised by the Treasu- 
 rer of the Society being first filed with the Stat« 
 Treasurer: Provided that such sum shall not exceed 
 two thousand dollars in any one year." 

It will be seen, that after the first year tho amount 
 of the appropriation is made to depend upon the 
 amount paid into the Treasury by the members. — 
 This fact should arouse the friends of the Society, 
 and induce them to spare no efforts to secure addi- 
 tional names. 

The same provision is made to apply to County 
 Agricultural and Horticultural Societies, except that 
 the appropriation is to be paid from the County 
 Treasuries, and is limited to one hundred dollars pe 
 annum. Where two Societies are fiirmed in the same 
 county, but one is entitled to receive such appropria- 
 tion in any one year under this act. 

These appropriations though small, will neverthe- 
 less have the effect of stimulating tlie efforts of those 
 who pioneered tlic way to the formation and incorpo- 
 ration of the present Society. ■" "" ° °'"' '^"-
