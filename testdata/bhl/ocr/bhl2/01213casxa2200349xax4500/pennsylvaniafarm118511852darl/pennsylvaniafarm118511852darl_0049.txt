green, when examined closely, wixs of a hue fast ap- 
 proximating to yeUow; while for about afoot upwards 
 from the ground, it was quite yellow. The ears too 
 were more open, the chafi' tinged with various shades 
 of yellow and green, the grain itself when separated, 
 Boft and pulpy, but not near so full of fluid as before." 
 At the end of another fortnight (September 1,) he 
 housed the sheaf cut August 18, which had remained 
 exposed to the weather in the interval. This was 
 ripe — not meaning thereby, says Mr. Hannam, " that 
 degree of ripeness when the straw breaks, the ear 
 curls, and the grain shakes out, but the condition in 
 which it is customary to commence reaping it — when 
 the straw from the roots to the ear, is uniformly yel- 
 low and has lost all symptoms of vivid health." 

On the 14th of September, the third sheaf was taken 
 from the field and carefully preserved along with the 
 other two till the first of November, when out of each 
 ho selected 100 ears or heads, and put each parcel 
 into a separate bag. The straw from each of these 
 parcels was carefully preserved. 

The ears in bag No. 1, (or that cut very grcon) 
 were now threshed, the chaff carefully separated, and 
 the gross weight of the wheat yielded, ascertained by 
 nn extremely accurate balance. The weights of a 
 fixed measure, of a certain number of grains were 
 next found. To avoid error, this was repjeated several 
 times. 

No. 2, (cut raw) and No. 3, (ripe) underwent the 
 ■game process; and the results are exhibited in the 
 following table: —

As this table is merely comparative, (Mr. Ilan- 
 nom remarks,) the weights used being in parts and 
 decimal parts of the same, for the convenience of 
 minute experiments, he furnishes another table of 
 the absolute weight of each sample, in ounces, 
 drachms, scruples, and grains, Troy, as follows: 

Comparative weight of 100 straws of an equal 
 length, belonging to the samples, Nos. 1, 2, 3. 

No. 1. (green) =550 

No. 2. (raw) =475 

No. 3. (ripe) =450 
 lie next proceeded to ascertain the comparative 
 worth of each description, consulting an extensive 
 grain grower as to the values of the respective sam- 
 ples according to the prices of the day, and an exten- 
 sive grain factor and miller as lo his opinion of their 

value, and what he would give for tlie same. Takint* 
 the mean of their estimates, he found that 
 No. 1 was worth Gls per quarter, or 7.". 7 J d. ner bu 
 No. 2 " " 63s 6d. " " " 7g IIM " "" 
 No.3 " " GlsOd. " " "-Js. sW. " " 

He deduced fi-om these tables the conclusion, that 
 the wheat reaped a fortnight before it was ripe had 
 the advantage of the ripe in every point: 

1. In weight of gross produce 13 J per cent. 

2. In weight of equal measures i per cent, nearly. 

3. In weight of equal number of grains 2| per cent, 
 nearlv. 

4. In quality and value above 3 J per cent. 
 . 5. In weight of straw above 5 per cent. 

The sample No. 3, (ripe) he observes was very bold 
 but rather coarse, feeling rough in the hand; while 
 No. 2, (raw) was quite as bold but very fine and thin 
 in the skin. No. 3, (green) was also a good and clear 
 sample, hut much smaller than either of the others. 

He next supposes three acres of wheat of uniform 
 quality, one of which reaped when ripe, yields thirty 
 bushels of grain and one ton of straw — the value of 
 this produce he fixes as follows, viz: 

£ d. s. 
 30 bushels of wheat at 61s 6(f per quarter, 11 10 7} 
 1 ton of straw, - - - - -168 

12 17 3J 
 And according to the data fiirnished by the forego- 
 ing experiments, he finds the produce of the other 
 two acres — and its value as follows: the acre reaped 
 a month before ripe, yields £ 5. d. 

26-1356 bushels at 61s. per quarter, - 9 19 3| 
 195,5-9 stones of straw, - - - 1 12 7 

11 11 lOi 
 And the acre reaped a fortnight before the ripe, 

£ s. d. 

Yields 30.1307 bus. at 636\ 6i7. per quarter, 11 19 IJ 

168 stones of straw, - - - 1 8 IJ 

13 7 3} 

Showing a loss of about 10 per cent, by cutting 
 very green, and a gain of ten shillings per acre, on 
 nearly 4 per cent, by reaping in a raw state, or a fort 
 night before it was ripe. He concludes that it is the 
 farmer's interest, to cut his wheat before it becom-es 
 thorouc/hly ripe; and though others should distrust 
 his deductions on account of their importance and 
 the limited character of the experiments, yet having 
 retraced step by step his investigations without any 
 variation, he could no longer refuse to believe it true. 
 There are some other advantages which he points out, 
 independently of the 4 per cent, gain, by reaping 
 wheat a fortnight before it is ripe : 1st. Straw of a 
 better quality; 2d. A better chance of securing the 
 crop, and 3d. A saving in securing it. 

In a communication to the Quarterly Journal of 
 Ai/ricuUure, March, 1842, Mr. Hannam remarks in 
 relation to these experiments, "At the time I ■nTote 
 you last, I stated that the bulk of the wheat reaped 
 by me during the present harvest was unthreshed. —
