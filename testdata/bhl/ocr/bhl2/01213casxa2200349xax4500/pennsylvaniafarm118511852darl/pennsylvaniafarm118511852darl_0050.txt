I could, therefore, only give you an idea of the raw 
 and the ripe, hy opinion, from a sample sheaf. Since 
 then the various cuttings (for I made several) have 
 been threshed and ground: the result of which was, 
 3J bushels of the ripe gave 10 stone 111b of good flour, 
 1 St. 91b of seconds, (technically termed "sharps") 
 and 2 st. 51b of bran: 3i bushels of raw, gave 12 st. 
 Gft) of flour, 12ib of sharps, and 2 st. lib of bran. — 
 From which it appears, that the raw cut wheat gave 
 sis and four-seventh pounds of flour to the bushel, 
 more than the ripe gave, while the latter gave three 
 and one-seventh pounds more sharps and one and 
 one-eighth pounds more bran, than the former, per 
 bushel." 

The editor of the Cultivator (of Albany,) noticing 
 the above facts, adds — "A farmer friend of ours, 
 found last season that one of his fields of wheat, then 
 in a very raw state, was badly struck with rust, lie 
 determined to cut it at once and did so, amid the laugh 
 and pity of his neighbors, who thought him little bet- 
 ter than crazy. The adjoining fields sufiered little 
 from rust, and stood till fully ripe ; yet at threshing, 
 the wheat first cut, gave the finest flour and the best 
 yield." A. L. Hayes.

Agricultural Schools, No. 2. 

In your last paper I gave a short account of 
 the number of Agricultural Schools in Europe — 
 of the extreme interest that those governments 
 show, in spreading a knowledge of Agriculture, 
 among their people, which we supposed to be 
 mere crushing despotisms, and without the slightest 
 sympathy, with the great mass over whom they rule. 
 I also ventured an opinion, of the truth of which I 
 have been for some years convinced, that this country, 
 sooner or later, must feel itself compelled to adopt 
 some system — some general and popular plan, by 
 which that large body of yeomen, who cultivate their 
 own farms, and who form the great moral and politi- 
 eal centre of our institutions, shall be able to re- 
 ceive instructions in the art, by which they are to live, 
 As yet, nothing has been done, except by a few indi- 
 viduals, whose success, though perhaps but moderate, 
 has shown the more than possibility of more extend- 
 ed usefulness, and a wider influence, if patronage 
 and support were generally given to them. But the 
 exertions of individuals, however energetic, cannot 
 do all that is necessary for the instruction of the im- 
 mense body of our farming population. There must 
 be a system, established tliroughout the whole State, 
 by which every fiirmer's son can be taught the prin- 
 ciples of agriculture, its theory and its practice, and 
 the elementary parts of all those sciences, which 
 form the basis of the art. There are persons, who 
 belong to the stagnant school of indiiFerence, who 
 will say that Pennsylvania is not prepared for such a 
 plan — that her legislature is not wise enough to frame 
 or support one, and that her people are not yet suf- 

ficiently advanced to receive the idea or to act upon 
 it. Although this is a very common remark, we be- ^ 
 lieve that it wrongs, and does injustice to the people 
 of the State. The fault, or deficiency, if there be 
 any, is not with the people, but with those who lead 
 the people. Let these men, turn from being poli- 
 ticians, to the being patriots, give up the slang and 
 cant of party, devote their minds to higher purposes, 
 and more generous duties, endeavor to distributo 
 useful knowledge with as much zeal, as they now 
 take to advance themselves ; open wide the portals of 
 science, take the pieople by the hand, and lead them 
 towards them, and wo have no doubt whatever, they 
 will find an intelligent, a willing, and a numerous 
 audience. Over the whole of this broad Common- 
 wealth, in every county and in every school in every 
 county, where the elements of each science allied to 
 agriculture, jwhich form, indeed its essential parts, 
 should be taught. 

Those are not mysteries, to bo acquired only 
 by the few — Chemistry and Botany, are not more 
 more difficult than Mathematics. Carbonates, Ace- 
 tates, and Sulphates, that now seem to alarm, as if 
 they were sheeted ghosts, are not less readily under- 
 stood, than Triangles, Parallelograms, or than even 
 the simple rules of arithmetic. All that is necessary 
 for a lad to know of those two sciences, should be 
 taught, as an amusement, and not as an intellectual 
 exercise or task. A very short instruction would give 
 an intelligent boy enough, to make him master of 
 many of those things that now seem to him, deep, 
 inscrutable and inaccessible mysteries. Why, then, 
 is it not possible, to attach to every school, a small 
 Laboratory, a small cabinet of minerals, illustrations 
 of the geological character of the neighborhood, and 
 the State ; models of agricultural implements, with a 
 collection of books on agriculture, mechanics, itc. — 
 The expense would be very little, the utility infinite, 
 for, of all the objects that one who has at heart the in- 
 terests of the great body of farmers should work hard 
 to secure, there is not one of more importance than 
 that of making them students of their art, and with 
 it, students of nature. Now, the larger part of a farm- 
 er's life is passed in dull and unintelligent drudgery: 
 his toil, severe as it is, is not enlightened toil, it has 
 no pleasures, unless in the hope of gain, neither his 
 heart nor his brain are interested ; his daily round of 
 occupations, is regarded as a matter of mere duty, or 
 of necessity, while God's works about him bring 
 neither admiration or enjoyment. All this would be 
 changed, by enlarging his knowledge of his art, by his 
 understanding the phenomena that are ever passing 
 before him, by his being able to think and reason in- 
 telligently upon all those splendid exhibitions of pow- 
 er which it is his particular privilege to see daily and 
 be ever among. The plan laid before the people of 
 the State by the Secretary of tho Commonwealth, able 
 and excellent as it was, is, we fear, too much abovo 
 tho general tone of thought of the mass of our citi-
