zens. It would be an Agricultural University, and 
 not a primary school, and the expense of its educa- 
 tion would make it impossible for much the larger 
 portion of our farmers to use the advantages that it 
 would offer. Such an institution would unquestion- 
 ably place Pennsylvania in advance of her sister 
 States, and give her a lofty position. It would, in- 
 deed, place her beyond all other countries, as not one 
 has sketched or adopted a plan so comprehensive. 

But the elementary kind of education to which we 
 have alluded in these remarks, might be carried out 
 by the State, at a very small expense. The chief 
 obstacle, and it is one that will not be easily over- 
 come for some time yet, is, the difficulty of finding 
 competent instructors. Young men in this country, 
 of good education and respectable talents, would not 
 accept the office and undertake the arduous duties 
 of a teacher, upon a salary very little more than is 
 demanded and paid to a day laliorer. Our people do 
 not yet seem aware that the brain is a very different 
 machine from the body — that mental toil is ten-fold 
 more exhausting than physical — that teaching is one 
 of the most anxious, laborious, life-wearing occupa- 
 tions, in wliich men can engage, and that, if they 
 ■wish to secure the services of well instructed men, 
 and induce such persons, to enter upon and con- 
 tinue the career of teacher, they must tempt by suffi- 
 cient compensation. To do away, as far as is possi- 
 ble with this difficulty, which is certainly one of no 
 small magnitude, the County Agricultural Societies 
 might employ lecturers, and make the collection of 
 a library, a cabinet of minerals, of implements, &c., 
 a part of the special object of their foundation. 

The State Agricultural Society has the education of 
 farmers, as a portion of its constitution. If this asso- 
 ciation succeeds in all its designs, and is well support- 
 ed by the people of the State, there is very little doubt 
 that in five years from this time, every farmer in the 
 Commonwealth will be fully alive to the importance of 
 instruction, in his art, scientific as well as practical, 
 will also duly appreciate his own position, and then 
 go forward in a body, and demand that all those aids 
 shall be placed within his reach, by which he pro- 
 poses to elevate himself and his occupation to a real 
 and not nominal dignity and distinction. Thorough- 
 ly to effect this, Uberal minded men must devote them- 
 selves laboriously to the interests of their fellow-citi- 
 rens, make, if necessary, even severe sacrifices, of 
 time and toil and labor too, without reward or the 
 hope of it. Their enthusiasm must he fed from their 
 own hearts, they must feel the impulse of a high pur- 
 pose — find their support in a generous love of their 
 country, and, never for a moment, be checked or dis- 
 couraged, by doubt or indifference, both of which 
 will clog their path, and impede every movement.

The use of lime as a fertilizing substance for land, 
 has long been known, and in many parts of the coun- 
 try has been brought to groat perfection. There is, 
 however, great difficulty in the practical use of this 
 valuable manure, as no universal rule can be adopted 
 for its application. For instance, the quantity must 
 be graduated, according to the character of the soil, 
 and the neglect of this fact alone has produced the 
 great difficulty. Deep soil, filled with vegetable 
 matter, wiU take three times more lime, than 
 should be applied to thin soil, containing a much 
 more limited quantity. Then again, wet land will 
 bear a much larger proportion than dry. The only 
 safe rule to adopt is, for every man to experiment for 
 himself, and after understanding fully the nature of 
 lime and the character of his soil, he cannot go astray. 
 It is very common to hear fiirmers, who have been 
 induced to use limo, say that their land has received 
 no benefit from it. The problem is easily solved — 
 they^did not know how to use it. 

I have tried upon my land, for several years, Ta- 
 rious experiments, and have constantly become wiser 
 in the mode of using it. I have never failed to find 
 that my land was most materially benefitted by it, 
 and I feel great confidence in recommending it to 
 others. I shall proceed, very briefly, to give my 
 views of the character and efficacy of lime, as a ma- 
 nure. I wiU state in the first place, that the use of 
 this manure is so imperfectly understood, as well as 
 the office which it performs, that, it is proper to place 
 it, in a practical form. 

Lime forms a constituent part of some grains such 
 as wheat and rye, as is ascertained by chemical 
 analysis ; and where no lime exists in the soil, the 
 crop becomes sickly and imperfect. But in most 
 vegetables it is a mere decomposer of the vegetable 
 matter in the soil, furnishing by this means a con- 
 stant nutriment to the plant. This at once ex- 
 plains the reason, why light soil, containing but 
 little vegetable matter requires less lime, than that 
 which is more strongly impregnated. I have tested 
 this in various ways, and on a variety of soils, and 
 every experiment confirms its truth. If I were to put 
 one hundred bushels of limo upon an acre of poor 
 soil, I am certain I should raise no crop for two or 
 three years, for the simple reason that there would 
 not be sufficient vegetable matter for the lime to act 
 upon, and to use a common expression it would hum 
 the land. Before it could bo available, it would be 
 necessary for the lime to become neutralized in the 
 soil, and the additional aid of successive vegetation, 
 such as might grow, to remedy the difficulty. After 
 this process shall have taken place, it will produce in 
 abundance. Twenty or thirty bushels to the acre, 
 for the first dressing, is sufficient. It plainly follows 
 from what has been said, that a different soil, deeply 
 impregnated with vegetable mould, will bear a much 
 larger quantity of lime. For such land, one hundred
