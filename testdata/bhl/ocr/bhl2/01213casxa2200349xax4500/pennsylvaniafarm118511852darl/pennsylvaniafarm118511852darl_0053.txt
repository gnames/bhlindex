Experimental Farming. 

Mr. Editob,— Iu furwai-ding you my name as a 
 subscriber to your valuable journal, I have thougbt it 
 might uot be uninteresting to offer a few remarks in 
 reference to some experiments -wbich I have made in 
 forming. I profess to be but a plain farmer, and 
 vrhat I communicate -trill be probaljly only interest 
 those of the same class, if indeed it should impart in- 
 terest to any one. More than twenty years of my life 
 have been spent in Philadelphia, and my removal to 
 the country was on account of my health, which had 
 been impaired by close application to business. There 
 is a prejuLlice too in the country against what are 
 termed "citizen farmers;" though I doubt whether 
 many, who have been reared j^rac^'ra/J^j-iVifZ/jo'/sfc, 
 have performed more real hard labor in farming for 
 the last ten years than myself. 

I have resided upon my foi-m eleven years. When 
 I moved on to it, I found it in a very poor state of 
 cultivation, although it had the reputation of being 
 one of the best farms in the country. It had been 
 rented for more than ton years, and of course culti- 
 vated, as most rental farms are, to got all that is 
 possible to gain for the present, without much being 
 done for permanent improvement in the future. The 
 soil is mostly limestone, and the farm at present con- 
 tains 285 acres, two hundred and forty of which arc 
 in grass and under cultivation, and the remainder 
 woodland and lime quarries. 

One of the first attempts I made at improvement 
 was to remove the old fencing, and alter the size of 
 nearly all the fields, so as to be able to destroy all the 
 noxious weeds and other trash that had accumulated, 
 and were scattering their seed broadcast over the land. 
 I have brought into profitable cultivation more than 
 twenty acres of valuable meadow land by ditching, 
 that were of very little value before. More than 
 thirty thousand bushels of lime have been spread upon 
 the land in the eleven years it has been under my 
 direction. In addition to this I have expended large 
 sums for manure. But this latter plan of buying 
 manure I have found expensive, and I have been 
 trying for two years past to find a substitute in part 
 for this item. My plan now is, to manure all my 
 corn ground ; sow clover in my corn or oats field, and 
 the following year make open fallow of them for 
 wheat. In June, 1849, I ploughed down a light crop 
 of clover in a field of eighteen acres, and then sowed 
 the ground with corn, at the rate of two bushels to 
 the acre. This I left grow until it was from six to 
 ten feet high, when it was all plou(jhe(l tinder about 
 en inches deep with a heavy t;am. After letting the 
 ground lay until near seeding time, I had it well har- 
 rowed, and then drilled in the wheat, one and a half 
 bushels to the acre. I never saw larger wheat grow 
 on any ground, and there were hauled at harvest 
 sevent y-tico horse rack-wagon loads oj" straw and icheai 
 from the field. The wheat sowed was Jleditcrranean, 
 excepting sis acres, which was white wheat, and 

which was injured very much from the attack of an 
 orange colored worm about the size of a grain of 
 Timothy seed.* The season too was rather wet, and 
 the fields did not average quite twenty-five Ijushels to 
 the acre. Adjoining this, I had a field of twenty-six 
 acres (all Mediterranean) which was oat stubble, 
 thoroughly manured, the yield of which was twenty- 
 sis bushels to the acre. The field in which the corn 
 was plouglied' under had but about sis loads of ma- 
 nure on some dry ridges. On the two fields, forty- 
 four acres in all, I sowed Timothy in the fall and 
 clover in the spring following, and now (April 19) 
 the grass in the field where the corn was turned under 
 is decidedly the best. 

In order to test again the advantage of plougMng 
 down green corn, I pursued the same course last sum- 
 mer with ten acres, in a field of forty-one acres, for 
 wheat. The corn was not sown until about the 
 first of July, and then did not grow well ; was only 
 about four feet high and not as thick on the ground 
 as I wished to have it when ploughed under. On this 
 ten acres there was not put a fork-full of manui-e, and 
 the clover had been pastured down pretty close pre- 
 viously to ploughing for the corn. The remainder of 
 the field was well manured. The ten acres of coi-n 
 ground were not seeded until a week after the other 
 part of the field, and now (April 19) I would rather 
 take my chance with this part for a crop of wheat 
 than the rest of the field. It is true the part manured 
 is larger in growth, but it was seeded a week eailier 
 and much of it is now too rank. 

There was much speculation among farmers about 
 the field of corn ploughed under in 1849, many assert- 
 ing that the heavy growth of fodder could never be 
 got under, others that it would make the ground sour 
 and the whole would prove a failure. But all was 
 neatly accomplished, even beyond my most sanguine 
 expectations. I may here remark too, that a portion 
 of the corn nearest my dwelling (which was the last 
 turned under) was so luxuriant that I gathered more 
 than a dozen ears suitable for boiling. 

I fear I liave wearied the patience of your readers 
 and I must now close these hasty remarks. I may 
 drop you a line upon the same subject after harvest 
 if life is prolonged. EespoctfuUy, iSrc.
