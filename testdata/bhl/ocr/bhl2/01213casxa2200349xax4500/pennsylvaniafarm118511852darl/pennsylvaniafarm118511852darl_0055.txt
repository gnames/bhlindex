tant functions in a soil. It promotes the decomposi- 
 tion of vegetable matter, and thus causes it to yield 
 the different mineral substances which it contains, 
 03 means for the production of another gro-svth. It 
 improves the mechanical texture of land ; this is but 
 one of its smallest uses. It poivcrfully aids the dis- 
 integration of the minerals (grains of sand) in a 
 soil, which contains many of the necessary ele- 
 ments of plants, and ivhich -prithout the fluxing or 
 fusing power of lime, would still retain them. This 
 is one of its greatest and most important uses ; and 
 wo cannot yet say, whether or not lime, when applied 
 to a soil, does not act more beneficially in this way 
 tlian in any other. More investigations by chemical 
 analysis, assisted by practical expei-imcnts, must be 
 made than have yet been, to settle this question, and 
 to determine in what manner, under what circum- 
 stances, and in what quantities, lime acts best. In 
 none of the soils which I have examined, has it been 
 found in sufficient quantities, except where at some 
 time or other, it has been applied artificially." 

The particular combination or proportion of each 
 (if the necessary constituents of soils, that will give 
 the greatest yield, has not yet been determined. It 
 can only be ascertained by many careful analyses of 
 fertile soils, in order to see what quantities are pres- 
 Kent in them ; and, by the analyses of soils which are 
 unproductive ; then, to find by the application of the 
 necessary manure, the smallest quantity that will 
 prcxluoe the greatest benefit. " The experiments 
 hitherto made determine nothing but the mere fact, 
 that some particular manure has acted well on- some 
 particular soil. As long as we remain in ignorance 
 of the composition of the soil, so long wo can learn 
 almost nothing." To obtain a knowledge of the best 
 manure by its mere application to a soil, without ref- 
 erence to the compositions of the soil itself, ho pro- 
 nounces empirical. The science of Agriculture, like 
 all others, has fixed laws, and must be studied in a 
 rational manner. Each known fact in Agriculture, 
 to bo useful, must be developed with all of the causes 
 which led to it. A successful or unsuccessful appli- 
 cation of manure, is a fact of little value, unless the 
 composition of the soil upon which it was used be 
 determined. " Then all the causes influencing its 
 nction will be manifest, and each experiment made, 
 will lead us onward to a perfect system ; every trial 
 of a manure will teach us how it should bo used, and 
 when rejected." A. L. H.

Corn Sowed for Fodder. — ^^^ho has tried sweet 
 corn for this purpose? Our own experiments have 
 been limited; but for milch cows we believe it is 
 preferable to other kinds of fodder, as it may be sown 
 thickly by using a full dose of special manure, and 
 as too thickly sown to form ears, the stalks will con- 
 tain a large quantity of sacharine matter, and may 
 be sown frequently so as to keep a continuous supply 
 during the whole summer and fall months. — Frof.

Agricultural Education. 

Mr. Editor : In a previous communication, I at- 
 tempted to show the importance of an agricultural 
 Journal to the practical farmer, and in a spirit of un- 
 affected earnestness, urged upon the friends of agri- 
 culture the expediency of ginng their countenance and 
 support to your undertaking. It appeared to me that 
 a State so essentially agricultural as ours is, should 
 at least bo able to sustain one periodical exclusively 
 devoted to the interests of farming. If every work- 
 ing farmer or his son, and every amateur farmer, 
 with every Storekeeper and Miller, would subscribe 
 to the " Farm -Journal," it would do away at once with 
 the reproach that Pennsylvania with her broad acres 
 of tillable land, cannot afford sufficient encourage- 
 ment to a paper, published with the view of benefit- 
 ting those who live by the soil. 

It should not surprise that storekeepers and mil- 
 lers are included in the category of patrons to such 
 a publication. Who will deny the relevancy in this 
 connection. Where is the storekeeper who is not 
 deeply interested in the success of farming ? Not 
 one. They all must admit, that when harvests are 
 most abundant, their sales are proportionably largo 
 and profitable. A dollar in the year is but a trifle 
 to every inland storekeeper in the State, compared to 
 even the nominal benefit received in the general pros- 
 perity, independent of the intrinsic value of twelve 
 numbers of a journal, every one of which will prove 
 to the subscriber an interesting monthly visiter, 
 which at the end of the year, when stitched or bound 
 together, will become an engaging family companion. 
 Then as to the miller, he is emphatically the most 
 interested in the matter. Is sound, heavy flouring 
 grain nothing to him ? Do not smut, rust, garlic, 
 cockle and cheat, annnoy him whenever they pre- 
 sent themselves ; and can he hesitate to spend a 
 a dollar a year upon a work that will show the grain 
 growers how to get rid of those pests, or at least" 
 to avoid them ? If ho does, no one should sympa- 
 thise with him if his millstones smell of garlic for a 
 month, or if he should be doomed to grind bad wheat 
 for a whole season as light as fifty pounds to the 
 bushel. 

But I must not forget that I set out to say a few 
 words on the subject of agricultural education, the 
 expediency of training our j'outh intellectually, mor- 
 ally and physically, so that they may be able when 
 men, to acquit themselves well, and cleverly, in every 
 position in which as intelligent citizens they may 
 claim to be placed, either to subserve their own inte- 
 rests or those of the public, while they can boast a 
 proficiency in agricultural and horticultural skill, — 
 a Pennsylvania farmer, possessing largely the es- 
 sentials of a sound, practical education, a man suited 
 for public, as well as private ends.
