Assembly mot, within our recollection, whilo thou- 
 sands upon thousands of dollars v^ero being appro- 
 priated to literary institutions and other systems, 
 what kind of reception would such a proposition have 
 had? Why, in all likelihood, the mover of the meas- 
 ure, would liave been considered as little loss than 
 demented, the motion thrown on or imder the table, 
 or, at least, the want of means would be sure to have 
 suggested the impossibility of granting the gratuity. 
 This want of means will always, in the very nature 
 of things, bo a standing, convenient excuse for 
 refusing to grant whenever it would appear to be 
 popular to withhold, however right and proper the 
 granting might be. So long as the Legislative body 
 is merely a representation of political parties, it will 
 eshiliit all the elements that governed in the election 
 of its members, and the Treasury will be made to feel 
 the influences of functions devoted exclusively to par- 
 ty — the funetionai-y looking to no other constituency. 
 The industrial classes have no representation re- 
 spectively. The farmers being the largest class, suffer 
 most for the want of Representatives intimately ac- 
 quainted with their wants, and sedulously disposed 
 to their interests. Is it not time we should have less 
 partizanisra, and more of farmingism, mechanicism, 
 and the like. jNIust not every reflecting mind con- 
 cede, that such a change would prove highly salutary 
 in lessening the waste of public time and money, in 
 abating the bickerings and heart-burnings of partizan 
 strife, and in recalling our erring affections, to be 
 united in a pure and primitive devotion to "Virtue, 
 Lilierty and Independence!" 

If the feeble light I have attempted to throw upon 
 the condition of the farming community, will afford, 
 to the considerate and well disposed among them, but 
 a glimpse at the circumstances of the case, the cause 
 and effect, they will, I trust, be induced to look far- 
 ther into the fatuity that dooms so large a portion of 
 farmers to unproductive drudgery and toil, that keeps 
 them insensible to their claims to a better destiny; 
 and if they will rally upon some plan, by which Ag- 
 riculture, with those engaged in its pursuits, may be 
 made to rise to the dignity that sometimes poetically 
 is claimed for it, they will not only do a ser^•ico to 
 themselves, but to the State likewise. ' 

It is no easy matter to eradicate a disease that is 
 chronic, nor to subdue habits and prejudices of long 
 standing; therefore, with the old and confirmed in 
 apathy, little or nothing can be done in the way of 
 improvement or change ; but there are those with 
 whom, and for whom, much can and should be done. 
 I allude to the rising generation. Here is ground 
 suited to seeding, this is the field for operation, to 
 which I invite every friend of Agriculture to labor 
 with a zeal commensurate with the groat objects and 
 interests to be achieved. Let no farmer who respects 
 his calling, or loves Pennsylvania, be backward to 

enter this field, and having entered, let him never 
 think of quitting it till the work is finished, till the 
 goal is reached, and the prize awarded — the prize. Ax 
 Agricultural College or Colleges, instituted by 
 the State, wherein every farmer's son may receive a 
 literary and professional education compatible with 
 the dignity of Agriculture, and the pre-eminence 
 which Pennsylvania, in wise and liberal institutions, 
 should assume. 

To Jlr. Pvussell, the present Superintendent of the 
 Common Schools, are we indebted for the first effort, 
 I believe in this behalf, by any public functionary of 
 Pennsylvania, — an effort, under tho circumstances, 
 as bold, and manly, as its motives, no doubt, were 
 pure and patriotic, and which should bo held in 
 grateful remembrance, by every liberal minded farm- 
 er throughout the land. Did ho but know, or could 
 I express the sense of obligation I felt to him, on 
 reading the project of an Agricultural College in hia 
 late ofiicial report, it would in ■some measure compen- 
 sate for the disinterested service ho has rendered to 
 the cause, should there not be found another indivi- 
 dual so inclined, but there is no danger that I shall 
 be alone in the expression of thanks, so justly his 
 due. 

The Report referred to, suggests one college for 
 the instruction of five hundred pupils and a farm of 
 not less than one thousand acres. With all duo de- 
 ference it strikes mo, that the size of tho farm and 
 the number of pupils under instruction, in one insti- 
 tution at a time, are on a scale too large for profit and 
 efiicionoy. The same outlay contemplated for one 
 college, if apportioned to four colleges, having two 
 hundred and fifty acres each, at appropriate looali- 
 ities, with buildings for the ■ accommodation of not 
 more than one, to one hundred and fifty pupils, would 
 prove more beneficial. 

The expediency of an Agricultural College is not 
 a new idea with me, but one upon which I have long 
 meditated, as is well known to most of the intelligent 
 agriculturists throughout the whole country. But as 
 this article has already outgrown perhaps the space you 
 can allot to it, and the want of time not permitting to 
 go farther into detail at present, 1 must reserve further 
 remarks on this interesting subject until another oc- 
 casion. In the meantime, I submit the few hints al- 
 ready thrown out, to the candid consideration of 
 your readers. Kespectfully yfiurs,

Hoof-ail in cattle. — To cure this complaint, 
 wash the hoof dean with warm soap suds, very par- 
 ticularly between the claws ; then apply linseed oil 
 and sulphur, mixed in about equal parts. The ani- 
 mal should bo kept in the stable with a plenty of dry, 
 clean litter. By applying the mixture once in two 
 days, (the foot always being well washed previously) 
 the animal will generally be well in one week — ^^and 
 I have known quite bad cases cured within forty-eight 
 hours, with only one application. — Rural New Yorker.
