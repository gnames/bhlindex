Remedy for Burns. — ^Dr. Reese, physician of Bel- 
 ivue Hospital, New York, has been making experi- 
 ments concerning the best mode of healing burns and 
 scalds and checking acute sufl'ering. He has found 
 that flour, thrown on with a common dredging box, 
 is one of the best and most efilcient remedies yet dis- 
 covered. The external air is one cause of suiSering, 
 and the flour thus applied, both heals and closes the 
 wounds to the atmosphere. The edges of the wounds 
 which remained open he dressed with lime and oU, 
 applied by a feather. Dr. Reese says the above ap- 
 plication made to wounds by fire, hot water, gunpow- 
 der, &c., has been most happy in tho practice at the 
 Hospitals. 

To Iron Silk. — Silk cannot be ironed smoothly 
 so as to press out all the creases, without first sprink- 
 ling it with water, and rolling it up tightly in a tow- 
 el — letting it rest for an hour or two. If the iron is 
 the least too hot, it will injure the color, and it should 
 first be tried on an old piece of the same silk. Bright- 
 colored silks or ribbons, such as pink, yellow, green, 
 &c., always change color on the application of an 
 iron. Black, brown, olive, grey, &c., generally look 
 very well after ironing. Silks should always be iron- 
 ed on the wrong side.
