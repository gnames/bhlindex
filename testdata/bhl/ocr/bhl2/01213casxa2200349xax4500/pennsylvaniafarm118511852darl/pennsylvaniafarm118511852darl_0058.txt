The lioail of the Devon ox is small, very singularly 
 go relatively to his hulk ; yet it has a striking 
 breadth of forehead. It is clean and free from flesh 
 about the jaws. The eye is very prominent, and the 
 animal has a pleasing vivacity of countenance, dis- 
 tini'uisliing it from the heavy aspect of many other 
 bre'eds. Its neck is long and thin, admirably adapt- 
 in" it for the collar, or the more common and ruder 

yoke. 

It is accounted one of the characters of good cat- 
 tle that the line of the neck from the horns to the 
 ■withers should scarcely deviate from that of the back. 
 In the Devon ox, however, there is a pecular rising of 
 the forehead, reminding us of the blood-horse, and 
 essentially connected with the free and quick action 
 by which this breed has ever been distiugnishcd. It 

has little or no dewlap depending from its throat. 

The horns are longer than those of the bull, smaller, 
 and fine even to tlie base, and of a lighter color and 
 tipped with yellow. Tlie animal is light in the with- 
 ers ; the shoulders a little oljlique ; the breast deep 
 and the bosom open and wide, particularly as con- 
 trasted with the fineness of the withers. The fore- 
 legs are wide apart, looking like pillars that have to 
 support a great weight. The point of the shoulder is 
 rarely or never seen. There is no projection of the 
 bone, but there is a kind of level line running on to 
 the neck. 

These arc characteristic and important points. 

Angular bony projections are never found in a Ijeast 
 that carries much flesh and fat. The fineness of the 
 slanting direction of the shoulder, and the broad and 
 open breast, imply strength, speed, and aptitude to 
 fiitten. A narrow-chested animal can never be use- 
 ful either for working or grazing. 

With all the lightness of the Devon ox, there is a

point about him, disliked in the blood or riding-horse, 
 and not aj )prcivod in the horse of light draught — the legs 
 are farunder thochest.or rather the breast projects far 
 and wide Ijefore the legs. We see the advantage of this 
 in the beast of slow draught, who rarely breaks into 
 a trot except when he is goaded on in catrhinj times, 
 and the division of whose foot secures him from stum- 
 bling. The lightness of the other parts of his form, 
 however, counterbalances heaviness here. 

The legs are straight, at least in the best herds. If 
 tliey are in-kneed or crooked in the fore-legs, it argues 
 a deficiency in blood, and comparative incapacity for 
 work ; and for grazing, too, for they will be hollow 
 behind the witliers, a point for which nothing can 
 compensate, because it takes away so much from the 
 place where good flesh and fot should be thickly laid 
 on, and diminishes the capacity of the chest and the 
 power of creating arterial and nutritious blood. 

The fore-arm is particularly large and powerful. 
 It swells out suddenly above the knee, but is soon 
 lost in the substance of the shoulder. IJelow the 
 knee, the bone is small to a very extraordinary de- 
 gree, indicating a seeming want of strength ; but 
 tliis impression immediately ceases, for the smallness 
 is only in front — it is only in the bone ; the leg is 
 deep, and the sinews arc far removed from the bone, 
 promising both strength and speed. It naiy perhaps 

be objected that the leg is a little to long. It would 
 be 60 in an animal destined only to graze ; but this 
 is a working animal, and some length of leg is ne- 
 cessary to get him actively over the ground. 

There is a very trifling fall behind the withers, but 
 no lioUmcness, and the line of the back is straight 
 from them to the setting out of the tail. If there in 
 any seeming fault in the beast, it is that the sides are 
 a little too flat. It will appear, however, that thi^ 
 does not interfere with feeding, while a deep, al- 
 though somewhat flat chest is best adapted for speed. 

The two last ribs are particularly bold and prom- 
 inent, leaving r<jom for the stomachs and other parts 
 concerned in digestion to lie fully developed. The 
 hips, or buckles, are high up, and on a level with the 
 back, whether the beast is fat or lean. The hind quar- 
 ters, or the space from the hip to the point of the 
 rump, are particularly long, and well filled up — a 
 point of importance b(jth for grazing and working. — 
 It leaves room for flesh in the most valuable part, 
 and indicates much power behind, equally connected 
 with strength and speed. This is an improvement 
 quite of modern date. The fullness here ami the 
 swcUinij out of the thigh below, are of much tnore cot- 
 sequence than the prominence of fat which is so 7nuth 
 admired on the rump of many prize cattle. 

The setting on of the tail is high ; on a level with
