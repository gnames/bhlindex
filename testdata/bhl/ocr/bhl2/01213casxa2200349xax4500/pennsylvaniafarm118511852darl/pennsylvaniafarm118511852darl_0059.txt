the back ; i-avcly much elevated or depressed. This 
 is another great point, as connected with the perfec- 
 tion of the hind quarters. The tail itself is long and 
 small, and taper, with a round bunch of hair at the 
 bottom. 

The skin of the Devon, with his curly hair, is ex- 
 ceedingly mellow and elastic. Graziers know that 
 there is not a more important point than this. Wlicn 
 the shin can be easily raised from the hips, it shows 
 that there is room to set on fat below. 

The skin is thin rather than thick. Its appearance 
 of thickness arises from the curly hair with which it 
 is covered, and curly in proportion to the condition 
 and health of the animal. These curls run like lit^ 
 tie ripples on water. Some of these cattle have the 
 hair smooth, but then it should be fine and soft. — 
 Those with curled hair arc more hardy, and fatten 
 more kindly. The favorite color is a blood red. This 
 is supposed to indicate purity of breed ; but there 
 are many good cattle approaching almost to a bay 
 dark. If tho eye is clear and good, and the skin 
 mellow, the paler colors will bear hard work, and 
 fatten as well as others : but a beast with pale hair, 
 and hard under the hand, and the eye dark and dead, 
 ■will be a sluggish worker, and an unprofitable feeder. 
 Those of a yellow color are said to be subject to di- 
 arrhoea, or scouring. 

These are the principal points of a good Devon os: 
 but he used to be, perhaps is yet, a little too fiat- 
 gided, and the rump narrowed too rapidly behind the 
 hip bones ; there was too much space between the 
 hip bones and the last rib; and ho was too light for 
 tenacious and strong soils. 

A selection from the most perfect animals of true 
 breed — the bone still small and the neck fine, but the 
 brisket deep and wide, and down to the knees, and 

' not an atom of flatness all over the side — these have 
 improved the strength and bulk of the Devon ox, 
 without impairing, in the slightest degree, his activi- 

• ty, his beauty, or his propensity to fatten. 

tainous ranges of our country from Alloglisiny to Ala- 
 bama—a high, moist, and verdant, but healthy and de- 
 lightful region, that needs only classical associations to 
 elevate it in the public regard, even above the far-famed 

Varieties of Sheep. 

No part of the frame-work of animals, whether races 
 of men or beasts, serves so well as the head to indicate 
 the family to which they belong even if it does not show 
 the particular temper and character of the individual. 
 Thus people accustomed to notice the marks that dis- 
 tinguish from each other the various breeds of horses 
 and cattle at once, on a view of the head alone — the fine 
 muzzle, full eye, thin skin, silken coat, well-defined 
 veins, and hard flinty bone of the high-bred southern 
 courser, will at once distinguish him from the soft-boned, 
 coarse-haired, cold-blooded, flabby and phlegmefic Con- 
 estoga ; aud in like manner, on a view even of a lierd of 
 beef cattle, will be prepared with confidence to say, as 
 it passes — This is touched with the blood of the Alder- 
 ney, or Channel Islands breed, as seen in the ewe neck 
 and deer-like head; thatshows the neat head and square 
 frame of the short horn; this again betrays the Wood of 
 the Hereford, and that of the Devon, while that beyond 
 sports tho long drooping horn of the BakewcU, carrying 
 all his fat veneered on the outside of his frame. 

Here we give the Acatis only of two well known breeds 
 of sheep. The first is that of a Cheviot tup. 

The only importation of this race, of which we are 
 aware, was by tlie Farmer of Marshfield, who probably 
 designed them for his native granite hills of New Hamp- 
 shire, so well typified by the compact, close-grained, 
 solid nature of his own mind, and mode of reasoning. 

The name of this family of the svine race, implies 
 their origin in the Cheviot Hills of Northumberland. — 
 They occupy, in fact, n,early all the pastoral hills in the 
 south of Scotland, and the best part of the Grampian 
 mountains, and may be regarded as a hardy race, and 
 ought, one would think, to be well suited to the moun- 


climate of Italy. Yes! there is prob.ibly no spot on th« 
 globe superior in delightfulness in climate to the moun- 
 tain lands of Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, the 
 Carolinas, Georgia, and Eastern Kentucky, and Tennes- 
 see. 

The wool of the Cheviot is short, thick set, and of 
 rather fine quality, fit for the manufacture of inferior 
 broadcloths. In this breed, the fore-quarters are light- 
 er, in proportion to the whole carcass, than in the Bake- 
 well. The flesh is said to be " fine grained, often well 
 intermixed with fat, and is generally esteemed for the 
 table;" but like our frontier settlers, they have rather 
 a disposition to rove and stray off, and do not come to 
 maturity at so early an ago as the Dishley or Bakewell, 
 with the blood of which the Cheviot would probably 
 mingle kindly, giving to the former (a more artificial 
 breed) more hardiness of constitution. 

The portrait which illustrates this sketch represents 
 the head of a Cheviot tup, which gained the first prize 
 of his class at the Highland Agricultural Society's 
 Show at Aberdeen in 1840. It will be observed that 
 its face is longer than that of the Leicester, muzzle not 
 so fine, eye not so full, ears not set so high and hand- 
 somely on the top of the head, while it resembles the 
 Leicester in the white fiice and want of horns. 

The next are portraits of quite a different character, 
 being those of a " black-faced" ram and ewe. 

The first is that of a ram exhibited at the Highland 

Agricultural Society's Show at Berwick-upon-Tweed, 
 in 1841, where he took the first prize of his chiss. 

As indicative of the long time and care with which 
 this breed has been kept distinct and cultivatedj notice
