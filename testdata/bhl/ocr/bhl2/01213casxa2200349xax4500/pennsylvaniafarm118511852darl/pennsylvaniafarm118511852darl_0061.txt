Pomological Remarks. 

Early in the present century several French gen- 
 tlemen in Philadelphia imported from the land of 
 their nativity a number of Pear Trees of varieties 
 ■which, at that period, enjoyed the highest reputation. 
 Among these liinds were the Brovrn Beurre, Chau- 
 montelle, Colmar, Doyenne Gris, St. Germain, and 
 many others ■with which the markets of Paris were 
 then abundantly supplied. The trees •were planted 
 at their country seats, in the vicinity of the city. — 
 After the lapse of some years they came into bearing. 
 But great was their disappointment, on finding the 
 quality of the fruit altogether inferior to that ■which 
 the same varieties possessed in their ©■wn country. — 
 This inferiority in quality ■was attributed, by them, 
 to our soil and climate. Others, among whom were 
 the leading nurserymen of Philadelphia, very natu- 
 rally imbibed the notion that these varieties had been 
 over-rated, and that they really did not possess the 
 intrinsic merit that had been ascribed to them. In 
 consequence of this opinion, they viewed, ■with distrust 
 and suspicion, all fi'uits, however highly extolled, ■with 
 ■which they ■were not familiar. Instead, therefore, of 
 testing the value of the new kinds, ■which shortly 
 afterwards made their appearance, from Belgium, 
 France, and England, they at once determined to 
 have nothing to do ■with them. On this account, 
 Pennsylvania did not keep pace ■with the improve- 
 ments in Pomology; she fell behind" the times. — 
 Within a few years, however, a view, more in accord- 
 ance ■with the American character, has rapidly been 
 gaining an ascendancy. And no^w, there is a grow- 
 ing disposition to become acquainted ■n-ith all of the 
 now varieties of alleged merit, by subjecting them to 
 a rigid scrutiny, and recommending such as, on 
 impartial trial, are found to possess qualities deserv- 
 ing commendation. This change of sentiment has 
 resulted in the introduction into Pennsylvania of a 
 number of no^w fruits fully equal, nay superior to the 
 old kinds even in their palmiest days. Such are the 
 Bartlett or Williams' Bon Crcticn, Beurre Bosc, 
 Beurre d'Anjou, Beurre d'Aremberg, Doyenne Bous- 
 Bock, Duchess d'Angouleme, Duchess d'Orlcans, Flem- 
 ish Beauty, Fondante d'Automno, Glout Morceau, 
 Golden Beurre of Bilboa, Louise Bonne de Jersey, 
 Paradise d' Automne, Rostiezer, St. Andre, Urbaniste, 
 and many other foreign varieties. Still the oxcater

number of those introduced from abroad do not sus- 
 tain the high character heralded on their advent, and 
 which many of them still sustain in their native land. 
 This circumstance has induced American Pomologista 
 to direct their attention vrith more favor to the fruits 
 that originate in our O'wn country. 

Already the United States has produced a number 
 of kinds of great exccllenoo. Some of these have 
 found their vray to foreign countries where their me- 
 rit is unhesitatingly acknowledged. It is not my 
 purpose, at this time, to enter into a detailed account 
 of our native Fruits. On the present occasion I shall 
 merely designate the names of a few of them, and the 
 States to which they owe their origin. 

To New York are we indebted for the Bloodgood, 
 Canandaigua, Columbia, Frcderika Bremer, La^w- 
 rence, Muscadine, Onondaga, Osband's Summer, Os- 
 wego Buorre, Sheldon and Stevens' Genessee pears, — 
 the Early Joe, Esopus Spitzenberg, Hawley, Jona- 
 than, Ladies Sweeting, Melon, Northern Spy, New- 
 to^wn Pippin, Swaar, and Wagener apples, — the Co- 
 lumbia, Jefferson, La^wrence's Favorite, and Wash- 
 ington plums. 

Massachusetts is the birth-place of the Andrews, 
 Cabot, Cross, Gushing, Dearborn's Seedling, Dix, 
 Harvard, Heathcot, and Johonnot pears, — the Bald- 
 win, Benoni, Hubbardston Nonesuch, Lysoom, Porter, 
 and Roxbury Russet apples. 

Rhode Island presents us with the Abbot, Capsheaf- 
 Knight's (R. I.) Seedling, Pratt, Westcott, and Wilk- 
 inson pears — Peck's Pleasant, and Rhode Island 
 Greening apples. 

Connecticut has given us the Ilowell, and the late 
 Gov. Edward's, Calhoun, Citron, Dallas, Elizabeth and 
 Henrietta pears, — and the Chandler apple. 

Most of the other States have likewise originated 
 fruits of excellent quality. 

As might have been expected, Pennsylvania has 
 not withheld her quota of fine Native Fruits. Her 
 Seckel is universally acknowledged to be the Prince 
 of Pears. The parent tree is still in existence, stand- 
 ing on the Girard Estate, now the property of the City 
 of Philadelphia, within two or three miles of the town; 
 and continues to yield its annual crop of luscious 
 fruit. Scarcely inferior to the Seckel, is one of her 
 offspring, the Ott, raised by Mr. Samuel Ott, of Mont- 
 gomery County. Possessing the same high and po" 
 culiar ilavor as its parent, its period of maturity is at 
 a different season of the year. Instead of being an 
 autumn, it is a summer variety, and proudly chal- 
 lenges competition with any known summer pear. — 
 The Jloyamensing is another Pennsylvania summer 
 pear of excellent quality. Besides the three no^w 
 mentioned, Pennsylvania has given origin to the 
 Brandywine, Chapman, Chancellor, Eshleman, Feas- 
 ter, Kerper, Kingsessing, Lodge, Pennsylvania, Po- 
 tro, and Tyson, — and several other pears of a quality 
 at least equal to nine-tenths of those we receive from 
 abroad. Of the Plums which have originated in our
