appear more rural when clothed with verdure. The 
 jasmine, the monthly clematis and climbing monthly 
 roses are all very appropriate. Of Roses the follow- 
 ing six are fine monthly climbing sorts: 

White Microphylla, Phillipart, pink; Fellenberg, 
 red; Janne de prey, buflf; Infant dc Ajaeio, crimson; 
 and Glory of Rosamond, scarlet. For monthly bush 
 roses select Ilermosa, pink; Souvenir, blush; Cels, 
 blush & pink ; Luxemborg, buff; Louis Phillippe, crim- 
 son; Queen of Lombardy, deep rose; Lyomais, rose; 
 Saffrana, yellow buff; Devoniensis, creamy white; 
 and Isabel, pure white. These vn\l furnish a suc- 
 cession of bloom from May tiU December, and can be 
 procured from any respectable Florist for a trifling 
 amount. Add to the above a dollars worth of choice 
 Flower seeds, including Mignonette, German Asters, 
 Russian ton week stocks. Phlox Drummondii, Blue 
 Grove, Love Sweet Alyssum, &c. Plant the roses in 
 fresh grotmd, well manured. Sow the seeds very 
 thinly in light rich soil made very fine. Sow the 
 seeds on the surface, rake them evenly, press the soil 
 with the back of the spade. Keep clean of weeds 
 and your labors will be crowned with success.

The C;iItivatiou of (he Pear on the Q,ui]:ce Stock. 
 Mr. Editor : — The cultivation of the Pcaf on the 
 Quince stock, is now attracting more attention than 
 at any former period, and large importations are an- 
 nually made from Europe. Our own nursery men 
 are preparing to supply the demand, and give us the 
 advantage of growing our native varieties, whicli are 
 unequalled in point of hardihood, flavour and pro- 
 ductiveness. 

Presuming that many of your readers are inter- 
 ested in the growing of choice fruits, I wish to call 
 their attention to the advantages possessed by 
 this stock under proper management. It has been 
 asserted that the pear on the quince, is short-lived. 
 Fortunately this is mere assertion, not sustained by 
 facts. The prominent objection to the quince stock 
 is, that it is liable to be attacked by the "borer" in 
 common with apples. It is well* known, that the 
 quince propagates by cuttings with the greatest 
 facility, producing from the part inserted, numerous 
 fibres, and the older the wood, the more readily it 
 roots. Advantage has been taken of this, to plant 
 the stock some five or six inches below the surfiice of 
 the earth. Thus planted, it is exempt from attack, 
 and the quince roots to the junction with the pear, 
 giving additional thrift and support to tlie tree. 

The quince grows well in almost any soil, but thrives 
 best in a damp situation; and to be successfully 
 grown, requires an annual application of well-rotted 
 manure two or three inches in depth, and in quantity 
 proportionate to the size of the tree. It may be ap- 
 plied in the month of November, on the surface of 
 the earth, and by spring, what remains can be turned 
 under with the spade. The application of manxire 

directly to the roots of trees, especially to those just 
 planted, is a most pernicious practice, and very often 
 fatal to the tree. 

The merits of this stock arc — First, It comes very • 
 early into bearing, producing a fair crop of fruit the 
 third year from the bud. 

Second, It adds greatly to the size and flavour of 
 the fruit. Indeed the contrast between the fruit 
 grown on the pear stock, and tliat grown on the 
 quince, is almost innedible, as regards both size and 
 flavour, and many of your readers if shown a Seckcl 
 pear, a Bartlett or a Beurre du roi (the deteriorated 
 Virgalieu) grown on this stock, would scarcely recog- 
 nise them. 

Third, The limited space required to grow the 
 trees ; which seldom attain an altitude beyond twenty 
 feet, thereby giving facility for collecting the fruit 
 without injury. 

Fourth, It transplants with certainty, without 
 checking the fruiting qualities of the tree. As an 
 instance, in March I transplanted a Buerre Did 
 pear tree on the quince stock; it was then showing 
 flower-buds — the following September I sent the fruit 
 to the Horticultural Society's Exhibition, where it 
 received a premium. The trees were about six feet 
 high nearly en quenouille or cone shaped. 

It has also been asserted that the pear or quince is 
 not adapted to orchard purposes. I think time and 
 experience will prove the assertion an error. It is 
 certain, the French and Belgians have used it, and 
 are now using it most extensively for orchards, and 
 find their profit in it. We do not claim for this stock 
 that it will produce the quantity of fruit that the 
 pear stock will, but we do claim, that from a given 
 number of square yards under cultivation, it wiU pro- 
 duce a greater weight of fruit and of better quality. 
 The French ft-uit growers have almost invariably 
 adopted the conical or quenouille style of training, 
 and plant the trees in rows eight or ten feet apart. 

Fortunes have been realized from the cultivation of 
 the peach ; at best but a very uncertain crop, and un- 
 der the most favorable circumstances, a fruit which 
 decays within a week after ripening. The tree itself is 
 of short duration, not existing beyond a period of ten 
 years under the best management, and thousands of 
 peach trees in the orchards of New Jersey are ex- 
 hausted in half that time; whereas, we can point to 
 pears on the quince stock twenty years of age, pro- 
 ducing regularly, heavy crops of fruit, and yet they 
 do not exhibit the first symptoms of decay. Added 
 to which, the superior keeping qualities, and the im- 
 mense variety of this delicious fruit, succeeding each 
 other from July to April, renders it worthy the atten- 
 tion of every cultivator of the soil. 

Our climate is every way adapted to the culture of 
 the pear on this stock, and we hope to see tlie day 
 when orchards not "few and far between" wUl am- 
 ply repay in a pecuniary point of view, the enter- 
 prising husbandman. J.111KS D. FuLios.
