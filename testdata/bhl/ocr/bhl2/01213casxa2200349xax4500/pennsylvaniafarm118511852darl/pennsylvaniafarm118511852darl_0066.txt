FKINCIPAL FLOOI!. 

This dwelling is intended for the country house of 
 a farmer of wealth, who wishes to give his dwelling a 
 dignified and superior character, without indulging 
 io too much ornament. 

The exterior, as shown in the elevation, is varied 
 and picturesque, expressive of solidity, convenience, 
 comfort, and a considerable degree of elegance. The 
 bay-window and veranda, taken in connection with 
 the construction, bestow a villa-liko character on the 
 design, while the large kitchen chimney and the ab- 
 sence of all tracery to the gables, indicate a country 
 house of less pretension than the highly ornamental 
 cottage or villa. 

Accommodation. The plan of the first floor shows 
 an entrance hall, 10 feet wide. On eitlicr side of 
 these are the two principal apartments — the living- 
 room and the parlor. IJy connecting these rooms 
 and the hall with large sliding doors, the wliole can 
 l>e thrown into one handsome suite on any occasion, 
 and the arrangement will always add to the coolness 
 and airiness of the rooms in summer. 

At the end of the entrance hall is a staircase pas- 
 •sage 6J foot wide, loading to the kitchen, dairy or 
 milk-room, wood-liouse, etc. 

The kitchen has a large pantry, and the living-room 
 a small one, both lighted by one of tho front windows.
