OUU TJERJIS— READ THEM. 

In or.ler that the Farm Journal may be placed 
 within the reach of every one who feels iuterestod in 
 the progress of Agriculture, txo ask attention to the 
 following terms : — 

Single Copies, - §1 00 Per Annum. 

Five " - - 4 00 " 

Ten " - 7 50 " 

Twenty " - - 15 00 " " 

It is not required that all papers in a club should 
 be sent to one office. We will mail them (in wrap- 
 pers,) to as many different offices as may be necessa- 
 ry. AVe make this arrangement in order that persons 
 residing in different neighborhoods may unite, and 
 form large club.s, and thus secure the " JonRNAL" at 
 the very lowest club rates. 

Specimen copies of the Journal wiUbo sent on ap- 
 plication, Ponf-paid, to the publisher. 

Post Masfcis, are by law, authorised to remit sub- 
 scription money to the pulilLslier, /rcc of postage. — 
 Particular attention is asked to this fact, as it will 
 save expense both to subscribers and publisher. 

Our lerms are cash in advance. The exceedingly 
 low rate at which the Journal is furnished renders 
 this imperative. Subscriptions may be sent at our 
 risk, and money at par where subsscribers reside, will 
 be taken. Where the sum to be sent is large we pre- 
 fer that a draft should be procured, if possible. 

Subscribers and Post Masters are invited to act as 
 Agents. A receipt will alwaj-s be sent with the first 
 number of the copy subscribed for. 

All letters must be addressed, post paid, to the pub- 
 Usher. A. M. SPANGLER,

It will be seen by the annexed resolutions which we 
 copy from the proceedings of the Executive Committee 
 of the Pennsylvania State Agricultural Society.at their 
 meeting at Ilarrisburg on Tuesday, April 29, that our 
 Journal has heeminanimousli/ adojited b.s iho Orrtanot 
 the Society. An endorsement from so high a source, 
 is certainly most complimentary and gratifying to us, 
 and in i-oturn for it, we can only promise that no ef- 
 fort of ours will be spared to render the "Farm Jour- 
 nal " worthy this generous expression of favor. 

If our friends will now give us their promised as- 
 sistance, we shall be enabled to redeem our promise. 

Reso.'red, That we deem the csfahUshment and stic- 
 cess of an Arfricultural Journal pnhlishcd in Pennsyl- 
 vania as essential to the proper exposition of the prin- 
 ciples of ar/ricullure as practised in our State. 

Resolved, That loe apjirove of the plan of the " Penn- 
 sylvania Farm Journal," published in the city of Lan- 
 eastcr, by A. M. Spangler and edited by Prof S. S. 
 Haldeman : that J'or the present it be adopted as the 
 organ of tlie State Soeteiy : and that farmers and all 
 others interested in the subject of agritidture be ad- 
 vised to patronize it and contribute information to its 
 columns. 

J^g^-As WG are desirous of having the Journal 
 ready for delivery to subscribers on the first of the 
 month, we hope our correspondents will send in their 
 articles in time. 

State Agricultural Exhibition. 

The Executive Committee of the Pennsylvania 
 Agricultural Society, at their meeting on Tuesday 
 the 29th ult., appointed the first exhiljition of the 
 State Society to be held at Ilarrisburg, in the ensu- 
 ing October, as will be seen by reference to their pro- 
 ceedings published in this number. Our agricultural 
 friends at Harrisburg and the citizens of Dauphin, 
 appear to have been fully awake upon this subject, 
 having pledged themselves to provide all tlie suitable 
 conveniences of lands and buildings, with fifteen 
 hundred dollars, certainly, and five hundred dollar* 
 more, if necessary, to defray expenses. While ws 
 may regret that our City and County did not offer 
 stronger inducements to secure the important advan- 
 tage of having the exhibition in our midst, we can- 
 not but concede to the men of Dauphin the proper 
 reward of their enterprize and spirit. Let us try to 
 do better in future. 

In the mean time, Lancaster County must bestir 
 herself to prepare for the exhibition. Her farmers 
 know they have a character abroad ; that the fame 
 of their agriculture is widely diffused, and that, for 
 fertility, prosperity, and practical skill, Lancaster 
 County stands second to no other district or section 
 in the Commonwealth. It is right and proper, that 
 their share, in the coming exhibition, should not fall 
 short of their position and character. We do not en- 
 tertain a doubt, that this county can make, with 
 moderate efforts, a splendid contribution to the State 
 Agricultural Fair. We have seen a drove of 50 fat 
 bullocks pass through our streets eastward, within 
 ten days, which were fattened by Christian Herr, 
 of Manor township, and which would have graced 
 any agricultural show in the United States. There are 
 in the County many fine cattle of improved English 
 breeds — some of which have been further improved 
 by crossings with our native stock. Horses we are 
 sure can be furnished from this County, equal to any 
 in beauty and blood, to be seen elsewhere, not to 
 speak of the majestic Conestoga draft-horse, which ia 
 so widely celebrated. Our farmers, too, have liberal- 
 ly patronized the various agricultural machines and 
 implements which have been invented of late years 
 for facilitating and saving labor. Many of these 
 have been introduced and approved among them,and 
 may form very interesting objects at the exhibition. 

As to the products of her soil, th'^y are as various as 
 the soil itself. There can be no want of fine speci- 
 mens in this department; and nothing can bo a 
 legitimate subject of exhibition, than those fruits of 
 the earth, which are the principal care of the agri- 
 culturist. We are also of opinion, that Lancaster 
 County, in the article of arboreal fruits — of apples 
 and pears especially, can make an admirable display. 
 We happen to know, that an English farmer who ar- 
 rived in this country about three years ago, was
