What a little effort can accomplish. 

It has probably never occurred to the friends of the 
 Farm Journal, how small an amount of individual 
 effort is necessary to place it beyond the possibility 
 of failure. There are, we believe, sixty-four counties 
 in Pennsylvania. Now, if each county will furnish 
 one Tiundred subscribers, we shall be enabled to pre- 
 sent them with a journal, which will truly and faith- 
 fully represent the agricultural interests of the State, 
 and prove a welcome and valued visitor to every 
 household. 

Will not our friends in each county lend a helping 
 hand to this good cause ? We have secured the good 
 will and services of a number of Pennsylvania's 
 ablest contributors, and every mail adds to this num- 
 ber. Unless our assurances are deceptive, every de- 
 partment of our Journal will Ije ably filled. We shall 
 spare no expense to render its illustrations and typo- 
 graphical appearance fully equal to any of our eon- 
 temporaries elsewhere, whilst the exceedingly low 
 rates at wjiicli we furnish it, places it within the reach 
 of every farmer's moans, however limited they may 
 be. 

Shall we have one hundred subscribers from each 
 county in the State ? Shall we have the means for 
 making our Journal all that the Pennsylvania Farm- 
 ers could desire, or shall we, after having expended 
 our capital, sit down -u-ith the mortifying conscious- 
 ness that our efforts have proven unavailing? 

The encouragement wliieh we have already received 
 forbids us to anticipate anything but complete success, 
 and relying, therefore, upon the assistance of our 
 friends we shall persevere in our efforts to render 
 the Journal worthy the p ttronage of all who feel in- 
 terested in the prosperity 01 Pennsylvania agriculture. 

t^^Hussey's Reaping, Mowing and Hemp Cutting 
 Machine is attracting much attention now, and should 
 command more. So far as our knowledge goes, it is 
 decidedly the best in use, although several others 
 claim for theirs, advantages which it does not pos- 
 sess. A more general introduction of this Machine 
 into the principal Agricultural Districts of Pennsyl- 
 vania, would doubtless remove the prejudices which 
 many iarmers now entertain in regard to improved 
 Farming Implements. Lancaster County fiirnishes a 
 fine field for testing its good qualities, and Mr. Hus- 
 se.y will do himself and the public a favor by placing 
 one or more of them in such places as v>"ill afford the 
 grain growers of this section an opportunity of as- 
 certaining thoroughly the principles upon which it is 
 operated. See advertisement. 

- On the second page of the cover will be found 
 a description of Croasdah's Patent Seed Drill and 
 Broad Cast Sower, a new implement of which from 
 tlie favorable representations received, we are induced 
 to think well. Wherever used, it has been found to 
 answer a most admirable purpose. 

Our New Dress, 

It will be seen that the present number of the 
 Joui-nal appears in an entire new dress. The gen- 
 erous encouragement extended to our first number 
 dissipated every doubt of success, and in order to 
 merit this hearty approval, we concluded to clothe it 
 in such a dress as would render it worthy of preser- 
 vation and fit for binding. The new type, which are 
 really beautiful, are from the well known foundry of 
 L. Johnson & Co., No. 6. Sansom St., Philadelphia. 

Notices of the Press. 

The exceedingly kind manner in which the News- 
 paper Press of our o^vn and other States has noticed 
 the first number of the Farm .Journal, places us under 
 deep obligations. The best return that we can make, 
 will be to endeavor to deserve the commendations 
 they have so freely bestowed. 

The Potato Rot. 

We copy from the Germantown Telegraph cxtracta 
 from several articles on the suliject of the '" Potato 
 Rot," by Tracy E. Waller, who it will be seen, confi- 
 dently asserts, that he has a remedy for the disease. 
 Our experience has not enabled us to say whether 
 the plan pursued and recommended by Mr. W. is 
 likely to prove effectual; but from the fact that he 
 has so much confidence in it himself, we shall be 
 glad to see a fair trial given it, and the results made 
 known. Since the ofier of a reward by the State of 
 Massachusetts of ten thousand dollars to the person 
 who discovers an effectual remedy for this disease of 
 the Potato, a host of claimants have entered the lists 
 as competitors for the prize. Of course many of the 
 suggestions are worthless, yet we may hope, that 
 some plan will eventually be discovered, which will 
 prove entirely sticcessful. 

" Now I undertake to say, and will hereafter 2)rot>e, 
 to the satisfaction of every farmer in the Union, if he 
 will apply the test which I am about to propose, that 
 the disease originates in the defficienoy of certain in- 
 gredients in the soil. The fact that millions of bush- 
 els (notwithstanding the loss of one-third or more of 
 the crop by the rot,) of as good potatoes are grown 
 every year in the United States as were ever raised 
 before the appearance of the disease, attbrds to my 
 mind, without more positive proof, sufficient reason 
 to disbelieve the statement recently made, that the 
 plant dies like an animal, in consequence of " the 
 feebleness of old age." I shall not ask the Legislature 
 of our State to give me 810,000 for my discovery. I 
 shall be amply rewarded if, on a fair and efiicieut 
 trial, it will settle the question. I shall not be alone 
 if it be proved that I am mistaken ; and as my rem- 
 edy will add to the fertility of the soil in proportion 
 to the extent it may be applied, no one can lose any- 
 thing by the trial of it. 

I therefore assert, as my firm belief, that Charcoal, 
 properly ap>p)lied, will always, and everywhere, prevent 
 the disease knoion as the " Potato Hot." 

The use ef charcoal as a fertilizer is not a new 
 thing, though it is only within the few last years that 
 agriculturists have taken much notice of it. let it is 
 apparent that but few farmers in this country under-
