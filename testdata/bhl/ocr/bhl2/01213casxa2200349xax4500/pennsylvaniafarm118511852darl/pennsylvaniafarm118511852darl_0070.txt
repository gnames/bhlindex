stand its value— its necessity to tlie soil. Prof. J. 1 . 
 Mapes, the able editor of the Working Farmer, has 
 advocated its use more, I think, than any other man 
 in our country. But even he has not spoken of it to 
 my knowledge, as a means of preventing the potato 
 rot. Nor can I learn that any other person has. A 
 writer in the American Agriculturist, January, 1851, 
 in speaking of the injury to the crops in some sec- 
 tions of New York and New Jersey, last year, says 
 of his own crop, " I mixed charcoal with the compost 
 of a small portion of the ground planted: where this 
 was done there was no rot." 

This is the second year that I have entertained the 
 views I am now advancing: and so far as I have had 
 opportunity to test them, I have reason to believe 
 that my labor will not be in vain. I would therefore 
 recommend farmers this season (it being now so near 
 planting time) to try it on a small scale, and proceed 
 in the following manner : Take one-eighth of an acre 
 in a field to be'planted, either in rows through the 
 field or on one side of it — ground that was plowed 
 last fall or early this spring will be the best; spread 
 the compost (as directed to be prepared in my article 
 last week,) evenly over it, and plow it in. Strike 
 out the rows in the ordinary manner — take good 
 sound potatoes, middling size, cut them in half length- 
 wise, so that each part will have an equal portion of 
 the eye or seed end, and place them in the furrows 
 cut side down, one foot apart. The rows should be 
 at least three feet apart. Then tlirow a handful of 
 charcoal dust over each piece, and cover with a hoe. 
 Cultivate during the season as you do the rest of the 
 field, and immediately after they have blossomed, go 
 through the rows with a Tiag or basket of charcoal 
 dust, and sprinkle a handful on each hill at the root 
 of the vines. Kopeat this again about three weeks 
 before the tubrcs have attained their ordinary growth. 

The alkalies in the compost are necessary as food 
 for the plant, but they will not prevent the rot; that 
 is the office of the charcoal. The chemical and phi- 
 siological action will be explained in the treatise I 
 . conteiiiplate puljlishing nest fall or winter. The 
 quantity of charcoal, (and perhaps in some respect 
 the moilc of ajiplying it,) as I before mentioned, may 
 have to be varied. 

On account of the lateness of the season, I would 
 suggest that farmers who may be induced to try the 
 remedy I have proposed, prepare at once a compost 
 for one-eighth of an acre (which will be sufficient for 

a trial this year,) as follows: 

Pulverised charcoal 250 pounds. 

Bone dust, or best guano, ... 25 " 
 Salt, 15 

One large wagon load of wet and 

well-rotted barnyard manure. 
 Mix well together and let it lay until time to plant, 
 say two or three weeks. 

Next fiill I shall be happy to hear by letter or oth- 
 erwise from all who make a trial of the remedy. — 
 The labor and expense attending it will be light and 
 easy. The compost which I would recommend when 
 an acre or more is to be planted, will differ somewliat 
 from that advised in last week's paper ; and I hope 
 to be able to give some desirable information on this 
 interesting subject for the use of farmers next year. 
 I shall lie satisfied for the present if am instrumen- 
 tal by these articles in eliciting a more thorough in- 
 vestigation into the nature of the potato disease.

Agriculture and Geology. 

The passage of the act appropriating eight thou- 
 sand annually, to the publication of the final report 
 on the geology of our noble State, will be hailed with 
 satisfaction, by every friend of Scientific Agriculture. 
 This sum is to be appropriated annually for four 
 years, in order that the most/ careful scrutiny may be 
 given the work as it goes through the press ; and 
 also to ensure the completion of it within the stipu- 
 lated time, in the style required by the nature of the 
 publication, and with a proper regard to the reputa- 
 tion of the State. When completed, it will con- 
 tain several hundred maps, sections, views, &o., to- 
 gether of important revisions with valuable locar 
 tions in which mining operations have opened nume- 
 rous avenues to knowledge, not accessible at the time 
 when the original survey was made. 

From an ai'ticle prepared for the first number of 
 the Farm Journal, but which was not received in 
 time for pulilication, we make the following extracts, 
 showing the important relations existing between the 
 publication of the Geological Report and the interest* 
 of Agi'iculture. — [-Ed.] 

" Of the contributions which such a report must 
 make to the benefit of our mineral interests, it would 
 bo easy to multiply examples ; but we confine our- 
 selves to its influence upon the aijricvlture of Penn- 
 sylvania ; a subject more directly connected with the 
 plan of this Journal. It is now well understood by 
 all intelligent men, that the theory and practice of 
 farming rests upon a knowledge of the soils to be 
 farmed ; and it is the business of the geologist to as- 
 certain the locallity, extent, and peculiar general 
 characteristics of each principal variety of soil. How 
 thoroughly this may be done will appear upon an in- 
 spection of any good geological map. The science of 
 chemistry, going hand in hand with practice in the 
 field, has been discovering and explaining the man- 
 ner in which the difiereut crops receive their nour- 
 ishment — what kinds of food they require — what 
 proportion of such food each soil contains — when ar- 
 tificial supplies are needed, and what kind of aid is 
 to be given, whether by carrying other soils, lime, 
 stable manure or other materials, or by turning up 
 sub-soils, &e. : and with the help of geology the 
 methods of drawing and watering have been devel- 
 oped and reduced to rule. With a good geological 
 map before us there would be little ditiiculty in pre- 
 paring such directions for the farming population of 
 each locality, as would advance our agriculture to a 
 den-ree not dreamed of by a majority of our citizens. 
 If ^e are to have (as we ought) a State School in 
 which the sons of farmers may obtain an acquant- 
 anco with the results of experiments and observation 
 in this department, and where they may enjoy facili- 
 ties equal to those now open to persons of other pro- 
 fessions, it will be essential to have a good represen- 
 tation of our various soils, the boundaries of which 
 are vory intricate. This must be the basis of our 
 elementary education. Some time will be needed 
 after the publication of the report, to prepare suita- 
 ble abstracts for the young farmers ; and this con- 
 sideration should hasten the conclusion of the work" 
 With respect to a general estimate of our agricul- 
 tural wealth, and the natural routes to the great 
 markets, no man who has not personally examined 
 every county of the State can be well informed 
 without the aid of a geological map and particular 
 description."
