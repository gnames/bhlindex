A CHALLENGE! !! 

THE deep interest now taken by j^griculturi^ts in all descrip- 
 tions of manure, would seem to justify any expedient, by 
 •which fair and unprejudiced experiments may be made of the Ta- 
 rious descriptions uf manure at this time attracting the attention 
 of the public. In view of this, and the undersigned honestly be- 
 lieving that the Chemical Compound, manufactured by them, is 
 the bL-st manure of which any knowledge is had for a Corn CiOp; 
 challenges Guano to the test upon the following condition: — lie 
 will forltit One Hundred Dollars, to be presented to the Maryland 
 Agricultural Society, if any advocate of Guano will do the same, 
 that the Renovator compounded by Kettlcwell & Davison, will 
 produce upon any soil, the largest crop of weighed corn, without 
 regard to the .size of the stalk, provided the Trcsident of the State 
 Agricultural Society will select some person, in his judgment 
 qualified, to superintend the experiment. The nature of the soil 
 to be described, so that each party can direct the mode ot appli- 
 cation; two barruls of the Salts to be used per acre, costing $6 
 and 300 lbs. ot the Guano, costing $7 £0, the party making the 
 experiment to receive the manure free of cost. And the same 
 amount agaiust any manure as a top di'cssing upon timothy or 
 clover. John Kettlf.well. 

Kttllewell ,J- Davison again call the attention of Agriculturists 
 to their various Chemical Manures — and in so doing, tbcy would 
 be insensible to common gratitude, if they failed to express their 
 profound acknowledgments for the constant and increasing de- 
 mand, which flows in upon them for their simple and compound 
 manures. Each season has greatly increased their sales, extend- 
 ing as far south as South Carolina. 

They can give no stronger evidence of their faith in the vir- 
 tues of their manure, as the best known for a corn crop, than the 
 tenders they make above ; and the certificates which Ihcy here- 
 with present. In the offer of a test, it is not the amount involv- 
 ed, but the willingness to challenge result, that speaks their in- 
 tegrity and coulidence. We could add any amount to the testi- 
 mony we publi.^h; but if the names we refer to. do not command 
 confidence, no additional number could. We have never boasted 
 of the quality of our ai-ticle. we have been content to leave a de- 
 cision to time, demand and experiment, that has been in our fa- 
 vor— hoping, if we have less ot " Bi-phosphates," the public would 
 discover it. as they would if it was found we had more of ■' sand " 
 than any thing else. Kettlewell & Davison.

Bl-PHOSPHATES. 

"We keep constantly on hand this valuable manure. Bones, 
 ■with a proper portion of the Sulphate of Ammonia, dissolved in 
 Sulphuric Acid. The Chemists of this country and Europe have 
 been pressing this mode of using bone-dust upon the atten- 
 tion of farmers, with great zeal and ability of recent years. Ev- 
 ery experiment has confirmed the truthfulness of their theory; 
 and we hazard but little in saying that in a very brief time it 
 ■will be used in no other way. It is prepared so as to be sown sim 
 JIar to the salts, at the rate of one or two barrels to the acre. — 
 The price of this article is $4 per barrel. Let the tarmer who 
 doubtSj try it at a less expense than the old mode of using bono- 
 dust. _ 

TOBACCO GENERATOR. 

This is a chemical compound, made expressly for the growth ot 
 the Tobacco plant. We will call more special attention to it at 
 the proper season. 

CHEMICAL RESIDIUMS. 

We have constantly on lianil Chemical ResiJhims of every 
 description. Full information of which can be had by applica- 
 tion to us. 

COMBINATION OF GROUND PLASTER AND 
 POTASH. 

This is a preparation made for soil deficient in Potash, of which 
 deficiency there is. unfortunately, too many instances in much of 
 our Maryland land. For this ctmipound we are indebted to the 
 suggestion of an accomplished Agriculturist of Prince George's 
 county, who may at some future day present the result of his ei- 
 pcriment. The price of this is i.2 OO per barrcL 

DIRECTIONS. 

The mode of using the Eenovntor is simple, inexpensive, and 
 reauirin" but little labor. The farmer must bear in mind, that 
 in the preparation of his soil ho shares an c(iual responsibility in 
 testing the merits of any manure. Laud negligently or badly 
 cultivated gives no manure a fair chance. How to put land in or- 
 der he ou'Tht to know better than Kc can teach him ; and if he 
 don't know, should learn a« speedily os possible. The land, then, 
 in order-if one barrel to the acre is used— and this quantity de- 
 pends upon the quality of the laud— it should, lor gram be sown 
 Iroad cast, and slightly harrowed in. . ,^ .,. 

If two barrels are used, one as stated above, and the other as a 
 ton-dressing upon the wheat or rye, early in the spring at the 
 OTmmencement of the first thaw. Upon grass it should be sown 
 broad-cast upon the timothy or clover. On corn, cither broad- 
 est or in the hill. Where two barrels are used, one each way

 Their Powers and Threshers have been sold in ne.-irly every State 
 in the Union, during the past year, and their superiority has been 
 acknowledged by numerous testimonials, not only from Agricul- 
 tural Societies but from persons who have used them. They 
 have been awarded the First Premiums at all the principal Fairs 
 where they have been exhibited in operation, including the Penn- 
 sylvania State Fair, the Provincial Fair of Upper Canadi. and the 
 iVlichigan and Ohio State Fairs, together with numerous County 
 Exhibitions in the different States.
