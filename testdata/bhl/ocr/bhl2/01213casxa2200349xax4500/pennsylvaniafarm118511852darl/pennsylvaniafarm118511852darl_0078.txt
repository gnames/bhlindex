ing them in bottles of ■water by cbildren — to be re- 
 peated year after year during the period of their ap- 
 pearance; but it is very evident that this cannot be 
 extensively practised. 

Clytus campestris of Olivier, (or C. tehminans 
 Fabeicius) figure 4, is about Ihree-flfths 
 of an incli long, of a darli brown color, 
 the elytra varied vrith ashy do\^-n, and 
 having two yellow quadrants near the 
 base. The thorax is rough above, with 
 four yellow spots in the corners, arranged 
 in a square. The thighs are thickened 
 towards the end. The perfect insect ap- 
 pears in Pennsylvania in May and June, and occurs 
 from Massachusetts to Carolina and Mississippi. 

The larva does considerable damage to fallen ches- 
 nut timber, particularly that which is cut for fencing 
 rails. The younger larvae burrow between the bark 
 and wood, but the older ones penetrate into the wood, 
 forming holes which the rain can enter. 

Painc's Oxygeu liight. 

Mr. Paine has promised the editor of the Worces- 
 cester (Mass.) Spy, that in the course of a week he 
 will illuminate the editor's ofiice by his new mode of 
 producing light. The oxygen light is a new discov- 
 ery of Mr. Paine, wliich the Spy says is a process of 
 catalising the oxygen of the atmosphere, andrender- 
 ing it highly luminiferous, at a mere nominal ex- 
 pense, without the cost of machinery, or any other 
 apparatus than an air receiver, capable of holding 
 common air. 

In this new discovery of Mr. Paine oxygen is to be 
 catalised (that is, united with the vapor of turpen- 
 tine) to form light. One mode of doing this is as 
 follows: The turpentme is to be mixed with other 
 ingredients (then called hurniiu/ fadd, &c.) and put 
 into an apparatus technically called a lamp, which ter- 
 minates above with a vertical longitudinally perfo- 
 rated metallic cylinder, through which one extremity 
 of a loosely spun piece of cotton (technically called a 
 wick) is passed into the catalising fluid, the other ex- 
 tremity being left exposed at the top of the apparatus 
 or lamp, where it soon becomes saturated by capil- 
 lary attraction, and is ready for action. If flame be 
 now applied to the exposed wick, a complete catalisa- 
 Hon of the oxygen of the air ^vill take place, and a 
 fine light win be the result. The cost of the appara- 
 tus is "nominal," and of the oxygen nothing, so that 
 the expense of the hurning fluid alone need be taken 
 into account. 

A second mode of using the air for lighting pur- 
 poses, is to pass the rays of the sun through it; but 
 as this is only adapted for daylight, the old mode of 
 extracting " sunbeams from cucumbers" will have to 
 be resorted to for night use, unless a squash is found 
 to be more luminous, — and in our early d.ays we ac- 
 tually saw a luminous pumpkin. This, like Paine's 
 late ingenious contrivance, had been formed "into an 
 ail receiver capable of holding common air," and was 

carved so as to reseml)le a skull, the mouth being 
 armed with a foi-midable set of teeth like those of a 
 cross-cut saw. The light came from the eyes and 
 mouth, and was probably due to a union of oxygen 
 and ialloic. This light is quite safe, unlike Mr. 
 Paine's hat full of hydrogen, which exploded "like a 
 six-pounder." 

Obituary. 

Samuel George Morton, JI. D. a distinguished 
 uaturahst and physician of Philadelphia, died on the 
 15th of Blay, aged 53. Besides various medical and 
 scientific works, he was the author of Crania Ameri- 
 cana and Crania Mgyjitiaca, in which these portions 
 of the human race are characterised from the skulls. 

Dr. Morton was a person of many virtues, of mild 
 manners, a lover of peace and concord, a liboi-al sup- 
 porter of science, a sincere friend, and the ready ad- 
 viser of the uninitiated upon their entrance into the 
 domain of science, when a little assistance and en- 
 couragement is of so much value. All lovers or cul- 
 tivators of science, in whatever sphere of life they 
 moved, were welcomed with equal hospitality, so that 
 it was unusual to spend an evening at his house witii- 
 out meeting one or more cultivators of science from 
 various parts of the United States or Europe. 

At the period of his death. Dr. Morton was presi- 
 dent of the Academy of Natural Science, Philadel- 
 phia, to the interests of which he devoted much of 
 his time, and where (next to his bereaved family) his 
 loss will be most deeply felt. 

Fine Sheep. 

Mr. Benjamin Hood, of Williston, Chester county, 
 informs us that last winter he disposed of three sheep 
 to Mr. Paul, of Philadelphia, whose age and weight 
 wore as foUows: 

One, three years and ten mouths old, weighed alive, 
 322 pounds; neatly dressed, 234 pounds. Twins, a 
 year younger, live weight, 286 and 285 pounds; 
 dead and dressed, 202 and 192 pounds. 

Mr. Hood also states that he sheared twelve sheep, 
 the average weight of the fleeces being something 
 more than eleven pounds. The heaviest was 14J 
 pounds. His stock is comprised mainly of the Cots- 
 wold and Leicester breeds. 

With such evidences of highly successful sheep 
 raising in Pennsylvania, why should it not claim 
 more attention than has heretofore been given it. 

Wonderful! — ^^Ve learn from an advertisement in 
 the Ledger of May 24, that a person with eye^ like 
 balls of fire, who had lost the use of his had; and 
 whose head was laid on his shoulder, obtained a bot- 
 tle o{ Panacea, "and before he had used it he could 
 hold his head erect!" 

The quantity of ashes lefl by a ton of wheat straw 
 is sometimes as much as three hundred and sixty 
 pounds.
