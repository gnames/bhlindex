Mr. Editor: — It is impossible to overrate the value 
 of education to the farmer, or, indeed, to any citizen 
 of our free country, -n-hatever may bo his profession 
 or calling. I have read ^vith pleasure the essays of 
 your correspondents, on this subject. There is much 
 in their tone that I like, though I may not be able to 
 concur in all their views. The interest which they 
 are adapted to excite in the cause of agricultural 
 improvement, if it should not lead to the foundation 
 of a university or colleges for the exclusive instruc- 
 tion of farmers, m.ay, at least, induce our legislators 
 to devise some plan for adding, to our existing insti- 
 tutions of learning, professorships charged with the 
 duty, and endowed with the means of imparting ef- 
 fective instruction in the branches particularly related 
 to the cultivation and improvement of the soil. Any 
 such plan must, of course, be materially different from 
 the schemes of manual labor, which have occasionally 
 been attempted and always failed. 

With respect to education, there are some conside- 
 rations, that ought not to be overlooked. In the first 
 place, most of the tuition bestowed upon the youthfiil 
 mind, must alwaj's, without regard to the destination 
 of the pupil, have for its special object the formation 
 of sound mental habits and the right development of 
 the aftcctions. Again, although we sometimes speak 
 of the science of agriculture, yet there is no peculiar 
 Bcience of that sort. It is true, there are many sciences 
 which may and should be made subsidiary to the prac- 
 tice of agriculture ; — such as chemistry, geology, bo- 
 tany, entomology, &c., and the application of these 
 sciences to the analysis of soils and vegetable produc- 
 tions, and the protection of plants and fruits, has con- 
 ti'ibuted more than any thing else of late years, to its 
 improvement. Moreover, in speaking of progress, — 
 it should not be forgotten, that there is a progress 
 downward as well as upward; and that the former is 
 not less' to be avoided, than the latter is to be sought. 

Let us not cast away anything that is good in our 
 present institutions, but rather improve upon the 
 foundations we have. What we want, is more in- 
 struction and better. Let us persuade our agricultu- 
 ral friends to avail themselves of the numerous semi- 
 naries and schools within their reach, to give their 
 eons the superior education which these institutions 
 will supply. Lot us persuade those who have the 
 power and direction, to infuse into the instruction 
 more of a scientific character, more that has relation 
 to the business of life, and especially the business of 
 agriculture. 

But something may be done immediately, and with- 
 out waiting for another generation. There is mani- 
 festly a spirit abroad propitious to agricultural im- 
 provement. Let us try to make it available. Our 
 communities are conveniently divided, territorially, 

into townships. Are there not, in every township, a 
 sufficient number of persons interested in farming, to 
 form a club — a fixrmers' club — who will meet every 
 month, or two months, at some central place, for mu- 
 tual instruction, — Toho will make up a small fund to 
 purchase agricultural works for the use of the mera^ 
 bers — hv'mg with them specimens, vegetable or mine- 
 ral, of whatever may be rare or remarkable, which 
 they may have found in tlieir neighborhood, — relate 
 their experience and observations and trials of various 
 methods of farming, with the results, and have a brief 
 record made and kept of all that may be deemed use- 
 ful and worthy of preservation? 

By this means, township lycenms might be estab- 
 lished all over the country, to the great advantage of 
 the present, as well as of the rising generation, and 
 would constitute the best medium for the diffusion of 
 knowledge in agriculture from the great centres — the 
 universities, colleges, and State Agricultural Society 
 — through all the ramifications of coimty and district 
 associations, acting reciprocally, too, by returning to 
 those central reservoirs, notices of the various experi- 
 ments and observations, made from time to time, in 
 the several townships, of which records should be 
 kept by the clubs. 

In commencing a farmers' club, it is of consequence 
 to avoid attempting too much. Let there be no over- 
 strained effort. Many useful purposes may be ac- 
 complished without requiring much time or pecuniary 
 outlay. 

1. With respect to a library, a good beginning 
 would be a subscription, for the use of the club, to 
 the nearest agricultural periodical works. These are 
 so cheap that the contribution — where there were but 
 a few members — would be a mere trifle. To this 
 might be added the volumes containing the former 
 numbers ; then other agricultural works ; such as, 
 the Farmers and Planters Encyclopedia, Colman'a 
 Practical Agriculture, Liebig's Organic Chemistry of 
 Agriculture and Physiology, &c., &c. 

2. The proceedings of the club, after appointing a 
 chairman and secretary, might consist , among other 
 things of the statements by members of such fact* as 
 the following, viz: 

a. The average quantity in acres of the farms in 
 their respective neighborhoods. 

6. The number of hands cmploj-ed in tilling them. 

c. The number of horses, oxen, mules, cattle, sheep, 
 and swine. 

d. The number of fields of particular farms and 
 the rotation of crops. 

e. The relative quantity of woodland, arable, and 
 meadow ; and the species of timber. 

f. The nature of the soil — whether limestone, gra- 
 vel, or slate, &c. 

g. The manures employed, how made or obtained, 
 how used, and with what cfiect. 

h. The quantity of seed sowed or planted to the 
 acre, the mode and time of sowing, ifec. and the yield. , 

i. The time of harvesting or securing tho crop, and 
 the meihod of doing it.
