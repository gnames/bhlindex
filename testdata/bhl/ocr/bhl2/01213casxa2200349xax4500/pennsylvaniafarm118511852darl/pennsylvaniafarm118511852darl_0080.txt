k. The various crops or products raised in the re- 
 spective neighborhoods ancl their sale. 

I. The prices of sales of land, and the wages of 
 labor; and the terms and usages of renting. 

These statements might be made orally or in wri- 
 ting. If in writing, they should be numbered and 
 filed ; if orally, reduced to writing by the secretary 
 or any member, and the writing numbered and filed. 

Besides this, the club might attend, (when time 
 permitted,) to the reading of useful and interesting 
 articles on agriculture from the books of the club, or 
 others, and to the hearing of occasional lectures on 
 agricultural sulijects. 

3. The chairman or secretary, acting as treasurer, 
 might also take care of the books, papers, and other 
 things belonging to the club. 

Such primary associations would thus be easily 
 formed and managed, and could not fail to be pro- 
 ductive of benefit to themselves and others. "I have 
 witnessed," says Dr. Iliggins in his valuable Report, 
 " the great good done by associations of practical 
 farmers, with frequent meetings for the discussion of 
 agricultural subjects, and as great aids to improve- 
 ment, would recommend their formation in every 
 neighborhood of our State." A. L. Hayes.

Mr. Editor: — The business of farming difiers ma- 
 terially from other pursuits in that it confines one 
 more to his home, and his own broad acres, and al- 
 lows less leisure to travel and collect from the prac- 
 tice of others hints for his own management, than the 
 merchant, manufacturer, or even mechanic. This 
 disadvantage can only be remedied in one way, by 
 tlio circulation of agricultural periodicals like the 
 " Farm Journal," which, in fact, are nothing more 
 than the practice and science of good farming record- 
 ed in a book, certainly not the less valuable .on tliat 
 account ; and thus reaching many a corner of the 
 land otherwise inaccessible. The fatal prejudice 
 against book farming, which is only observations on 
 culture printed instead of spoken, has, in a great 
 measure, passed away, and our practical farmers now 
 find their true interests to consist not only in reading 
 agricultural journals, but in writing for them. 

Among other innovations on old systems brought 
 about in this way, the heading of this article is one. 
 I have somowhero seen the observation that there is 
 some excuse for the yearly renter of a farm to plough 
 shallow, but none for the owner of the soil. The one 
 •wants to get all he can, even at the expense of the 
 and, the latter permanently to improve, while crop- 
 ping it. I doubt whether it is to the advantage of 
 either renter or owner to plough shallow. 

In the spring of 1844, I broke up a stiff sod for 
 corn, with a heavy plough, (Prouty's 5^') drawn by 
 two yoke of oxen, to the depth of nearly eight inches. 
 I then followed immediately behind with a subsoil 
 plough, which stirred up the subsoil to the depth of 

six or seven inches more. After the ploughing and 
 harrowing were finished, a stick could be pushed 
 down in nearly every part of it, to the depth of four- 
 teen or fifteen inches of loose earth. It was well 
 ploughed and the experiment was a fair one. We 
 may remember that that summer was a very dry one. 
 Not only wore our pasture fields burnt up and bare, 
 but the summer crops suffered greatly. Cattle were 
 foddered for some time. I went to England in the 
 spring of that year, and did not return till the crop 
 was harvested in the fall. It proved a full average, 
 and I was told it had been a common remark of the 
 neighbors and passprs-by, how green and luxuriant 
 it continued through the season, compared with others 
 around it. This was an instance of the benefit of 
 deep ploughing in a dry season, and I hold it would 
 have been equally perceptible in a very wet one. — 
 Tho depth of soil, would have allowed the superabun- 
 dant moisture to pass off, and thus relieve the roots 
 of growing crops. In wet or dry seasons, in rich or 
 poor land, I contend for deep ploughing. To be sure, 
 in an exhausted soil, or in a naturally deficient one, 
 very deep ploughing is not to be at once adopted, but 
 the system is correct, each year to go a little deeper. 
 It is surprising to see the practice of many farmers, 
 working for years, ploughing, manuring, and plant- 
 ing but four or five inches deep, fearful of touching 
 the hard yellow substratum. Ask the question, and it 
 will l>e admitted, that if there was twelve inches of 
 depth as rich as four inches, it would l)e a fine thing; 
 but how to accomplish this, unless by ploughing and 
 turning it up to the influence of tho atmosphere, would 
 be difficult to answer. The larger the source from 
 whence growing crops derive their nutriment, of 
 course the larger the crop. A given amount of sur- 
 face, representing ten inches deep of good soil, of 
 course supplies more food to plants, than the same 
 amount of surface only four inches deep. A fear is 
 often expressed of burying out of reach by deep 
 ploughing, the shallow surface soil, but tho advantage 
 of turning up the hard substratum to the influence of 
 the sun and air and atmospheric gases, and its con- 
 sequent speedy melioration, is lost sight of. Deep and 
 thorough ploughing, thorough pulverisation of the 
 particles of soil, allowing of the free admission of air 
 between them, coupled with the use of plaster and 
 lime on the surface, and repeated harrowings or stir- 
 rings, will soon render productive and profitable a 
 subsoil hitherto valueloss.'and thus greatly augment 
 the supplies and sources of food for plant.?.

Ammonia is regarded by Dr. Hayes as being a poi- 
 son to plants, though he attaches great value to it as 
 a neutralizing agent to the acids of soils, and as serv- 
 ing to convoy other ingredients, such as carbonic acid 
 and tho organic acids of soils, into the circulation of 
 plants.
