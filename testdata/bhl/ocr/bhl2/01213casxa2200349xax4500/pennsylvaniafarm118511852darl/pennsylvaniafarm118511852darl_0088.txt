CULTIVATION OF TOBACCO. 

[June, 

JES^ Wo have, on seTcral occasions, been asked for 
 the best work on the cultivation of tobacco. AVe 
 knovr of no American book on the subject, and tliere- 
 fore present our inquiring friends -svith the following 
 essay written by Peter Miner, of Virginia. We copy 
 the article from the Plough, Loom and Anvil, where 
 it received a hearty recommendation from Mr. Skin- 
 ner. As tobacco growing is attracting much atten- 
 tion in parts of Pennsylvania, and especially in Lan- 
 caster county, the essay will be of importance to new 
 beginners in the business. We shall complete it in 
 our subsequent numbers. 

Notes on the cultivation & mauagement of ToTiacco, 

From ilie plant bed to the prize — according io the most 

approved practices in Albermarle and the adjacent 

counties in Virginia. 

1st. of the choice of lands for the plant-beds, and 

mode op pkeparing it. 

A rich virgin loam with a slight mixture of sand is 
 ascertained to be the best soil for raising tobacco 
 plants. Such spots are indicated by the growth of 
 alder and hazle bushes in bottoms and on the margin 
 of small streams, and if the situation has the com- 
 mand of water for irrigation it is on that account to 
 be preferred — the spot being selected, the first opera- 
 tion is to burn it with a strong fire. For this purpose 
 the growth of every kind is cut off, (not grubbed up) 
 and the whole surfixce raked very clean. The burn- 
 ing should be done before Christmas, or as soon after 
 as the weather will jiermit — and if done thus early it 
 cannot be well too heavy, even bringing the soil to a 
 hard cake. The wonderful fertility imparted to soil 
 by fire, has of late years been clearly proved and de- 
 veloped by various experiments in this and other 
 countries, but judging from long established practice, 
 ■we suppose it is a fact that has been long known to 
 tobacco planters; that this fertility is imparted by fire, 
 and no ways dependent upon the ashes left by the 
 process is clearly proved from the fact, that the same 
 results will ensue if the ashes are swept off entirely 
 clean. Or take another piece of ground of equal qua- 
 lity, cover it with as much or more ashes, and pre- 
 pare it in every respect similar except ))uruing, and 
 plants cannot be raised in it. Hence the necessity 
 and propriety of regular and uniform burning, the 
 want of which is always manifested by a diminutive 
 yellow and sickly growth of plants in those spots not 
 Bufficiently acted on liy the fire. 

After the ground becomes cool from burning, the 
 ■whole surface should be swept with a coarse twig 
 broom to take out the coals. In this operation some 
 of the ashes will be removed, but that is of no conse- 
 quence ; it should thou be broken up about two inches 
 deep with grubbing hoes, in which ojieration and in 
 repeated choppings afterwards with hilling hoes, all 
 roots will be cut and finally got out with a fine iron 
 tooth rake which will leave ground in proper order 
 to receive the seed. 

The most approved time for sowing is about the 
 first of Feljruary, the beds previously prepared being 
 suffered to lie and mellow by the frost and snows to 
 that time. But it will do very well to liurn and sow 
 after that time, as late as the first of March, taking 
 care not to have the heat so great. The quantity of 
 seed is as much as can bo taken up in a common ta- 

ble spoon"* for 100 square yards, and that in propor- 
 tion. This quantity of seed should be mixed Avith 
 about one gallon of clean ashes, and half that quanti- 
 ty of plaster of Paris, and the whole well incorporat- 
 ed, and then strewed uniformly over the bed at two 
 operations, crossing at right angles to ensure regular- 
 ity. Cabbage seed for early planting, tomato, cele- 
 ry, and lettuce seed may be sowed in small quanti- 
 ties ^with the tobacco seed, without material injury 
 to the growth of the plants. After sowing the seed 
 the ground is immediately trodden over closely with 
 the feet, and covered thick with naked brush. If the 
 frost is severe from this time it is common to take off 
 the brush sometime in the month of Jlarch, before 
 the plants appear, and tread the bed again, and at the 
 same time give the ground a slight dressing of ma- 
 nure. The dung of fowls of all sorts, is sought after 
 for this purpose, which being beaten, is sifted over 
 the bed through a coarse basket or riddle. The brush 
 is then restored, and not finally removed until the 
 leaves of the plants are half an inch in diameter ; 
 when the dressing of manure is again applied, taking 
 care to wait the approach of rain for that purpose. — 
 Any grass or weeds that may have sprung up in the 
 meantime are carefully picked out. In diy seasons, 
 if the situation admits of it, the bed must be irrigated, 
 by training a small stream of water around the edge 
 of it. If not it should be watered every evening with 
 a common watering pot, or pine bushes dipped in 
 water and shook over the bed until sufficient moisture 
 is obtained. 

Under a careful observance of this management, 
 the plants according as the seasons have been favor- 
 able or not, will be fit to transplant from the 15th of 
 May to the 10th of June. A planter thinks himself 
 lucky, if he can get his crop pitched by the 10th of 
 June. After th.at, the seasons are uncertain from 
 the heat of the weather, and the chances of success 
 for a crop precarious ; though it has been known to 
 succeed when planted in the middle of July. 

* This quantity of plant bed is generally consider- 
 ed under good circumstances as sufficient to set t«n 
 thousand hillis in good time. But the prudent plan- 
 ter taking into consideration the casualties of fly, 
 drought, &c., will do well to make a larger allowance. 
 We know of no certain remedy or antidote against 
 the fly which destroys the early plants. 

The Directors of the public schools of the several 
 wards have been improving and ornamenting the 
 grounds of the Reading Academy, in Fourth street, 
 by planting shrubbery, roses, &c., and adding trees 
 here and there where they are needed. Buildings 
 of this character should be rendered as attractive as 
 possible. It indicates taste and refinement on the 
 part of those having them in charge, and reflects cre- 
 dit on the whole community in which they are located.

A Prolific People. — The census marshal of New 
 Mexico cites, as an evidence that the people of that 
 region are prolific, that Ojo Callento Jose Antonio 
 Prugillo lias twenty-five children living — thirteen 
 sons and twelve daughters — by one wife. Jose and 
 liis wife were living, in good health, at the venerable 
 ages, respectively, of 90 and 86.
