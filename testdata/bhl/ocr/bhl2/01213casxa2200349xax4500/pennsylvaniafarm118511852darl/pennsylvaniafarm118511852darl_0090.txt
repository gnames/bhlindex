THE HORSI 

[Juke, 

men ■will not require any explanation; lest, however, 
 the reader bo unacquainted with some of those terms, 
 a plate is annexed, having references to the parts 
 themselves in the figure of a horse. It requires some 
 experience, but more attentive observation, to 1)e what, 
 in modern horse-phraseolor/;i, is called a good judge; 
 i. e. (if we are asked to define a good judge,) to know, 
 at once, by a cast of the eye, whether the nag, as soon 
 as ho is pulled out, is likely to suit; is he cut out for 
 a Jiaekiiey, or is he calculated for harness? Does he 
 look like a Jmnter^ or has he any good looks about him? 
 Does he show any blood, or is he cdl over a mongrel? 
 In fine, is he the sort of thing you want, or won't he 
 do until he meets with a greenhorn? These, and va- 
 rious other important considerations we hope to un- 
 ravel the nature of in the course of this inquiry, offer- 
 ing such remarks, from time to time, as may prove 
 of practical service to the young and inexperienced 
 horseman. At first sight of a horse, a judge takes a 
 general survey of him, and if he observe any appa- 
 rent disproportion or deformity, his attention is at 
 once fixed to tliat particular point. Every horse, for 
 example, that is tolerably well formed, should exhibit 
 due proportions of limb and carcass ; in fact, nine out 
 of ten have as much carcass as is equal to the area of 
 the space occupied by the legs in ordinary standing; 
 but should his legs be extraordinarily long, or his 
 carcass disproportionately small, he is said to have 
 too much daylight under him, and that is certainly 
 no mean objection. Should his head be very large, 
 his neck of disproportionate length, his fore legs stand 
 under him, or his quarters be ragged and ugly, such 
 glaring imperfections cannot fiiil to attract our notice 
 as soon as, or even before the groom has sot him on 
 liis leo-s. But we shall have occasion to particularize 
 these things in a detail of the perfections and imper- 
 feotionrof the diflorent parts entering into the compo- 
 sition of the animal. 

The exterior of the horse may be divided, for the 
 convenience of thus describing his several parts, into 
 head, neck, body and legs. First, we shall delineate 
 a good head. The nob should be small. A large 
 head is not only a plain head, but a bad point, inas- 
 much as it really, under certain circumstances, de- 
 tracts from the powers of the horse: ho has, in fact, 
 more to carry — it is a burden to him, and the only 
 way in which he can possibly carry it to advantage, 
 is at the extremity of a short and U)iright neck. — 
 Like the weight of a pair of steelyards, if it is sup- 
 ported by a long and horizontal neck, its burden be- 
 comes enormously augmented, so that the weight 
 transmitted to the fore extremities (for those parts 
 support the head and neck as well as half the car- 
 case) is much increased, and, from the natural pre- 
 ponderance of it before, is very likely to prove the 
 cause of the horse's falling down, more especially if 
 the rider is heavy, every trip or mis-stop he may 
 chance to make. In addition to all this, a lawyer (or 
 big-headed horse) is apt to have a hard mouth, or 
 rather, we say, no mouth, so that we are always ap- 
 prehensive of his being heavy in hand, and unplea- 
 sant tJ ride. It ia proper, however, to state, before 
 wo proceed farther, lost we incur censure for these 
 remarks, that the formation of the neck, and the 
 mode in which the head is set on, and how ho carries 
 it, will have much to do with the head being olijec- 
 tionablc from its size, and with his being light or 
 heavy in hand ; for we have known many big-headed 
 horses ride well, and be as safe as any others. Next 
 to size, its shape becomes a consideration. Every 
 feature should give animation to the countenance; let 
 the forehead be broad and flat; the eye staring and 
 full of fire; the cars thin, fine, and often erect; the 

nostrils circular, dilated, and reddened within; the 
 lips soft, thin, and hairless; the jowls extended and 
 the cheeks well marked. 

"Fire from his eyes, clouds from his nostrils, flow.'' 

This, at least, is what we would have it in the tho- 
 rough-bred, and as a general rule, the nearer that of 
 any other description of horse approaches to it, the 
 better the family he springs from, and the more san- 
 guine we may be in our prognostic of his al^ilities. — 
 That such a horse looks like a sticker, or is a perfect 
 gentleman about his nob, are no uncommon nor very 
 unmeaning expressions in the mouths of sportsmen 
 and capers. But his head may be very long, or it 
 may be very short, though we do not know that either 
 is particularly objectionable, except as an eye-sore, 
 if the countenance is something like what we have 
 just described ; imless he be a Yorkshircman, and 
 then, certainly, we should not fall in love with such 
 a big canister. The race ought to be perfectly straight, 
 (see plati>,) and the muzzle, in the blood horse, square, 
 and such as will go into a pint pot; a Roman nose 
 (one in which the race is curved) is by no means de- 
 sirable, though his napper be but of ordinary dimen- 
 sions; it is seen more couunonly, however, in a big 
 head, which it, in a side view, makes appear not only 
 much larger, but excecdingly'ugly ; tliis may be said to 
 constitute a plain Yorkshire head. Withal, the head, 
 to render it handsome, should be well set on ; its 
 junction with the neck should form a sort of curve, 
 so as to leave ample space in the throat for a large 
 and prominent gullet, by which we may judge him to 
 be a good-winded horse. 

The neck now demands our attention; if good, the 
 crest will form an arch of agreeable curve from the 
 poll to the withers, 

"With neck like a rainbow, erecting his crest." 

It will be of proportionate length, and progressive 
 increase in breadth, as it approaches the chest. A 
 long neck, if it be straight, or but little curved, is ob- 
 jectionable for the reasons we stated when speaking 
 of a large head; a short one, however excellent it 
 may be on the principle of the steelyards, is never 
 handsome and seldom exists without rcndciing even 
 a good hackney piggish. That short-necked horses 
 are betler winded than others, because the air has 
 less distance to and from the lungs, is an opinion to 
 which we cannot subscribe. The neck should also 
 be thin, not thick and heavy, and rounded and straight 
 along its lower margin; should the canal of the jug- 
 ular vein be deep, and the windpipe full and promi- 
 nent below it, we may regard it as a sign of good 
 wind. When the arch of it is reversed, i. e. below 
 instead of above, and the crest, or what ought to be 
 the crest, near the withers, is hollow and sunken, the 
 horse is said to have an ewe-neck, one of the greatest 
 natural deformities common to these parts. Under 
 these circumstances it is usual for a dealer to say that 
 the neck is put on the wrong side upward; but, in 
 reality it appears to arise from the j unction of it with 
 the chest being too low do'v^Ti.

 from the Plough, Loom and Anvil, to the publishers 
 of which journal we are indebted for the engr.aving 
 which accompanies it. The length of the article pre- 
 cludes the possibility of publishing it entire in a sin- 
 gle number. We shall therefore give the remainder 
 in our subsequent numbers. — Ed.]
