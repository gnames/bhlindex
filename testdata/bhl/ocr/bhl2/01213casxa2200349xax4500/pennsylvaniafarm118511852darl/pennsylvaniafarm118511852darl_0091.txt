The China Goose. — Of this vai-iety, three heautiful 
 sijecimens were exhibited at the hvte Agricultural 
 ShoTV held in the county of Philadelphia. Tliey were 
 owned by a gentleman, whose name I forget, living 
 in the vicinity of Tacony, near this city. In intro- 
 ducing this variety to the reader, Jlr. Dixon says: — 

There is something in the aspect of this creature, 
 the dark brown stripe down its neck, its small bright 
 eye, its harsh voice, its ceremonious strut, and its af- 
 fectation of seldom being in a hurry, which seems to 
 say that it came from China. It would perfeotl}' har- 
 monize in a picture of Chinese still life ; or in a Chi- 
 nese garden, with artificially arranged rooks, dwarf 
 trees, crooked trellises, and zigzag pathways ; or, in 
 a more extended landscape, it would group well on a 
 broad river, beside a boat filled with shaven fisher- 
 men, with their trained cormorants and pig-tailed 

children. If it docs come from China, it has no doubt 
 been domesticated for many hundred year.«i, perhaps 
 as long as the peacock or common fowl. They may 
 be made to lay a large number of eggs by an in- 
 creased supply of nourishing food. This is very dif- 
 ferent from the disposition to "lay everlastingly,'' as 
 seen in the Guinea fowl, and some varieties of the 
 domestic hen — the Black Spanish for instance; be- 
 cause the China goose does in the end feel a strong 
 desire to incubate as soon as her protracted laying is 
 done, whereas entire exemption from the hatching 
 fever is the great merit of the " everlasting layers." 
 If liberally furnished with oats, boiled rice, &e., the 
 China goose will in the spring lay from twenty to 
 thirty eggs before she begins to sit, and again in the 
 autumn, after her moult, from ten to fifteen more. I 
 have never observed any disposition to sit after the 
 autumnal laying. It is not, as in the Guinea fowl, 
 a spontaneous flow of eggs, for which the ordinary

diet of the cre^re is suflicicnt, but is as much de- 
 pendent on feecliiig as the fatness to which a bullock 
 19 brought. A goose that I supplied with as much 
 oats as she could eat, besides grass, potatoes, and 
 cabbages, laid eggs larger than ordinary ; one of them 
 (with a double yolk) weighed seven and a lialf ounces, 
 nearly half a pound. I need hardly say that double- 
 yolked eggs arc very rare, except among birds that 
 arc highly fed. 

The prevailing color of the plumage of the China 
 goose 18 a brown, which has been aptly compared to 
 the color of wheat. The different shades are harmo- 
 niously blended, and are well relieved by the black 
 tuberculated bill, and the pure white of the abdomen. 
 Their movements on the water arc graceful and swan- 
 liks. It is delightful to see them, on a fine day in 
 spring, lashing the water, diving, rolling over through 
 mere fun, and playing aU sorts of antics. Slight va- 
 liatious cccur in the color of the feet and legs, some 

having them of a dull orange, others black: a deli- 
 cate fringe of minute white feathers is occasionally 
 seen at the base of the bill. These peculiarities are 
 hereditarily transmitted. But the white China goose, 
 if it be not speoificially distinct, is a variety so deci- 
 dedly marked as to demand a separate notice. 

The eggs of the China goose are somewhat less 
 than those of the domestic kind, of a short oval, with 
 a smooth thick shell, white, but slightly tinged with 
 yellow at the smaller end. The goslings, when fii-st 
 hatched, are usually very strong. They are of a dirty 
 green, like the color produced by the mixing of In- 
 dian ink and yellow ochre, with darker patches here 
 and there. The legs and feet are load-color, but af- 
 terwards change to a dull red. If there is any thing 
 like good pasturage for them, they require no i'urther 
 attention than what their parents will afford them. — 
 After a time a little grain will strengthen and for- 
 ward them. If well fed, they come to maturity very
