trees from the hosts of noxious insects which now in- 
 fest them, and the yearly increase of which is truly 
 formidable and alarming. 

If I remember rightly, by an Act of General As- 
 sembly, the destruction of insectivorous birds in 
 Lancaster County, at any time between the first of 
 April and the first of October, is made a penal of- 
 fence. Why is not this law enforced against the lazy 
 men and boys who may be seen daily in pursuit of 
 the birds? I never meet one of these straggling 
 louts without feeling strongly inclined to give him a 
 good drubbing. What a triumph it must be to them 
 to kill a harmless little wood-robin or field-lark ! No 
 man possessed of a single spark of humanity would 
 be guilty of doing it, while no one can plead neces- 
 sity as an excuse for his barbarous conduct. One 
 half the time and effort, (to say nothing of the ex- 
 pense of powder, shot, and wear and tear of clothing,) 
 if expended in almost any honest work would pay far 
 better. If, therefore, it cannot be a matter of profit, 
 it must be one of sport, and the man's mind must 
 be an empty one, and his heart a cold one, who can 
 find either amusement or sport in such an unmanly 
 pursuit. 

I appeal to the farmers and friends of the little 
 birds in our o^vn county as well as in every section of 
 the State, to assist in preventing this exterminating 
 warfare against harmless and useful birds.

Kitchen Garden. 
 JIr. Editor : — Though gardening was the first 
 profession of which history gives an account, yet it 
 appears strange to us at the present day to see it so 
 feebly practised. At this period of the season, the 
 gardener must have a head and an eye to his second 
 crops, or in other words, to plan out his succession, 
 »o as to keep the gi-ound covered and properly culti- 
 vated. A succession of bush or snop-short beans is 
 indispens.able; plant a few every ten days till Au- 
 gust. Turnip rooted and long blood beet will pro- 
 duce a good crop sown as late as the 4th of July; soak 
 the seed in water a few hours before sowing, and if 
 the weather is dry, water the drills. Never sow tur- 
 nips on ground from which a crop of cabbage has 
 been just taken or' even one year previous. Plant 
 out celery for early use — manure and moisture is in- 
 dispensable to its growth. The soil should be dry or 
 ploughed deep and well pulverized. Soap suds once 
 a week is very conducive to its luxuriance.

To Destrot the Caterpillar. — In answer to many 
 inquiries for the best mode of destroying caterpillars 
 on trees, which have caused such havoc of our hopes 
 the present year, I would say that three drops of 
 lamp oil poured into their nest will effeciually de- 
 stroy them. — Albany Cultivator.

The stated meeting was held in th.e Chinese Saloon, 
 Philadelphia. May 20th, 1851. The President in the 
 Chair. The JLiy meetings of the Society are usually 
 among the most attractive occuring at a season so far 
 advanced as to preclude all danger by sudden atmos- 
 pheric changes to green house plants. Proprietors 
 therefore permit their choicest specimens to bo sent 
 for the gratification of members and visiters, who 
 throng the Hall and enjoy the scene with unmingled 
 delight. On this occasion many embraced the oppor- 
 tunity who assuredly must have been pleased, hav- 
 ing spread before them extensive tables covered with 
 a great variety of beautiful flowering plants, and cul- 
 inary vegetables in profusion. Of the former, Peter 
 Mackenzie exhibited a handsome collection of Calce- 
 olarias, Fuchsias, Cinerarias, and a large specimen of 
 Azalea variegata, completely enveloped with its re- 
 splendent flowers, an object of much attraction. Rob- 
 ert Buist, a collection of Pelargonia, many of which 
 were the new fonoy varieties and shown for the first 
 time, and all were of the choicest kinds, fine Azale- 
 as, new Calceolarias, and a number of plants of re- 
 cent introduction and now for the fii'st time brought 
 into notice — Tetratheca vertieillata, a pretty delicate 
 upright plant with very narrow leaves in whorls and 
 cerulean flowers — Ceutranthus microsiphon, another 
 of delicate habit bearing numerous slender flowers 
 in umble form of a pink hue — Henfreya Scandens, a 

climbing plant bearing clusters of white flowers a 

seedling Mirnutus of marked colors and beauty, 
 named "Jupiter," and Azalea coronata. We would 
 remark hero that both of the above collections were 
 not ofiered in competition, but in a liberal manner 
 furnished for the gratification of visitors. John 
 Lambert's gardener, a collection containing fine Pe- 
 largonia, Cinerarife, two specimens of Rhodcndron 
 ponticum in full bloom, etc. Benjamin Gulliss and 
 William Hall each choice Roses. A very large and 
 beautiful basket of cut flowers was shown by the 
 President's gardener. 

Of Fruits — there were ripened Grapes of the whit« 
 Constantia and Chasselas of Fontenbleau, varieties 
 from the President's houses — Strawberries of open 
 culture from J. M. Tage, Burlington, N. J. The Lo- 
 quat grown and exhibited by Mrs. Jno. R. Latimer of 
 Wilmington. Two Seedling Apples of merit by 
 Wm. Haines, Pricetown, Berks Co. 

Vegetables — John Riley, gardener at the Asylum 
 for the Insane, exhibited Cauliflowers which for great 
 size and luxuriance far surpassed any former occa- 
 sion. Cucumbers of large size were shown from the 
 houses of Geo. W. Carpenter, Germantown; Samuel 
 C. Ford, Cedargrove ; Isaac Newton, Delaware Co., 
 and Harry Ingersoll. _ Rhubarb of gigantic propor- 
 tion, some stalks of which measured from three to four 
 feet in length, and it was thought that half a dozen 
 stalks would weigh full twenty pounds, by Samuel 
 Cooper, Henry Cooper, John Riley, William Hobson 
 and Willi.am Hall. Asparagus of great weight by 
 James M. Tage, Burlington. Forced Potatoes of 
 the ash leaved kidney variety, by C. Cope's gardener, 
 and very full displays by Anthony Felton, jr.; by Miss 
 Gratz's gardener ; by John Lambert's gardener, and 
 a few specimens by Wm. Johns.
