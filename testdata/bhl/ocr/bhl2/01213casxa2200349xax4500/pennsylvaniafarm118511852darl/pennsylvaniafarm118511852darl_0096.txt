Farming in California. — The country north of 
 San Francisco Bay is one of the finest farming dis- 
 tricts of California. A correspondent of the Alta 
 Californian writes: 

Annally, my farm, has under cultivation 150 acres 
 potatoes, 30 do. onions, 30 do. wheat, 10 do. barley, 
 10 do. turnips, 25 do. beets, cabbage and maize 250 
 acres. For tenants — potatoes arid other vegetables 
 120 acres. Independent of this, there will be within 
 a radius of fifteen miles from Port Podega no .less 
 than 700 acres of potatoes planted this season, be- 
 sides 200 acres of barley and wheat, and about 54 
 acres of vegetables. The whole quantity of potatoes 
 planted in this section of country will amount to 950 
 acres; which, allowing a yield equal to that of last 
 year's crop in Annally, (being ten tons per acre,) we 
 will have an aggregate quantity of 9500 tons, which 
 of itself will go far toward supplying San Francisco 
 market. In Sonoma, Napa, Suisun, Suscol and Pata- 
 I loma, there will bo large crops planted.
