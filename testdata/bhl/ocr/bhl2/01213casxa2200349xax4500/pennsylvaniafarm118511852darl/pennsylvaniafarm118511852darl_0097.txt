Female Industry, Accomplishment and Duty. 

Mr. Editor : — In contemplating woman, skilled in 
 the various arts of life, thoroughly accomplished and 
 complete in character, so constituted by her own ef- 
 forts and acquirements, we feel there is something to 
 admire — something real and true and abiding — some- 
 thing that will live, and last, when the tine complex- 
 ion has lost its rose-tint, the eye its glow, and the hair 
 its lustre. 

Females of this ago have not the same duties nor 
 the same urgent necessities for untiring and unceas- 
 ing toil, as those of an earlier period. Everything is 
 changed, both in the facilities, and requisitions of la- 
 bor. Yet woman need not, should not be useless, or 
 feel herself exonerated from all responsibility, be- 
 cause her burden is a liglder one to bear. Neither 
 should she feel the necessity of departing from her 
 appropriale sphere for employment and occupation. 

There is enough in her own allotted station to de- 
 velope and engross her highest powers both of body, 
 mind, and character, and if occupied as she should 
 be, will never feci that her sphere is narrow and un- 
 important. 

A thorough and right education, would open her 
 eyes to the magnitude of her duties, and tlie strength 
 of intellect requisite, to meet the demands of life, 
 upon her highest capabilities. 

There are a great variety of methods, in which fe- 
 male talent and industry may find ample scope. — 
 The past furnishes many brilliant illustrations, and 
 we may point to many in the present who are build- 
 ing monuments of lasting renown to female industry 
 and effort. 

But it is only by dint of application and persever- 
 ence that great results are over accomplished. Un- 
 less there is some hahit formed, something undertaken, 
 life will pass away with but the trifles of the hour, 
 and no trace will be left that an active human being 
 bad ever lived ! 

How full of blessing we may make every day of 
 this short life, by our ceaseless industry. Every gift 
 which God has in his wisdom bestowed, should be 
 cultivated to its highest capacity, that "He may re- 
 ceive Ilis own with usury." The mind — has not our 
 Heavenly Father bestowed thinking, reasoning, intel- 
 ligent faculties, that should not lie idle? 

AVhatever be the bestowment, use it as a priceless 
 gift. There is time enough, means enough, employ 
 them. Genius was formerly needed to aid forward 
 the great car of necessity and labor, now there is am- 
 ple room, and scope, for all that the human mind has 
 power to accomplish. 

If the time given to idleness, folly and extrava- 
 gance, were appropriated to literature, science, art, 
 and the various departments of usefulness in domestic 
 life and society, what a wreath of beauty would blos- 

som, where hang now but the dark withered leaves 
 of the industry of a former age. 

"Wealth should not exonerate, but give the more 
 liesure for real, lofty achievement, and successful ef- 
 fort, and a deeper and wide-spread influence through 
 the great channels of benevolence and education. — 
 Whose heart will not glow and beat with a warmer 
 emotion when the female talent of America, inspired 
 by active industry and real goodness has deserved the 
 applause of an approving world and the calm bright 
 smile of Heaven. L. 6. A.

JIr. Editor. — As you have done me the honor to 
 forward to my address the April No. of your Penn- 
 sylvania Farm Journal, you will perhaps allow me, 
 while making my acknowledgments, to add a remark, 
 and offer a suggestion. 

Your Journal will no doubt be eminently useftil, 
 and I trust also eminently successful. Such a publi- 
 cation, widely circulated, will give the hard-working, 
 industrious farmcr,all the benefits of such experiments 
 and improvements, as agriculturists of means and 
 leisure, may make and adopt. The great majority of 
 the tillers of the ground are necessarily short of school 
 learning. For instance, a va.z.n goes into a new sec- 
 tion of country and commences farming, His means 
 are small, and there is a vast amount of work to be 
 done; much of which, such as weeding, making hay, 
 and picking stones, can be done by small childi'cn. — 
 He has children, he is unable to hire men, the work 
 must be done, ergo, the children must stay out of 
 school, and do it. They are not, however, necessarily 
 igtwrant; they have books, newspapers, and the great 
 book of nature ; but they have small opportunities for 
 scientific research, and generally do as their fathers 
 did before them. Such a publication as your Jour- 
 nal wiU be especially useful to this large class of 
 men, as I before observed, and I trust that it will be 
 widely patronized by the farming community. 

But — while there are so many efforts made for the 
 benefit of farmers ; so many experiments tried, and 
 the results noted; so many useful inventions made, 
 for the speedier and easier performance of his labor; 
 so much said and printed for his especial benefit; 
 why is it that so little is said and done for the benefit 
 of the farmer's wife, and the indoor economy and 
 comfort of his establishment? I am certain that- no 
 class of women, on the face of the earth, work so hard 
 and incessantly, and under such inconveniencies as 
 the wives and daughters of our pioneer agriculturists. 
 I know very many women who, with several smajl 
 children to take care of, perform all the work of their 
 house, make butter and cheese, spin wool and flax, 
 sew, knit, perhaps weave, and all this with no assis- 
 tance whatever and no allowance for indisposition ; 
 for whatever they are unable to do this week, must 
 lie over and be added to next week's task. Shoulii
