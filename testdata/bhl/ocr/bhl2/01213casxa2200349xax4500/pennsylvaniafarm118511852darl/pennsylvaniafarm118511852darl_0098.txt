not something Ijo done for the alleviation of their la- 
 bors, and their improvement in their methods, and 
 habits of household economy ? 

A simple suggestion, or statement of a fact, might 
 save a large amount of labor, beside enabling the 
 housewife to produce a better article, with a consid- 
 erable saving of material. There are many, very 
 many vromen, (ladies if you please.) in Pennsylvania 
 ■who are capable of giving such instruction ; many 
 vrho, in passing through the trials of pioneer life, 
 lighted upon improvements, and made little inven- 
 tions, which not only tended to lighten their burden 
 then, but have conduced largely to their present pros- 
 perous and comfortable condition. These ladies are 
 capable, and probably willing to give their younger 
 or l«ss fortunate sisters, the Ijenefit of their discover- 
 ies, if they had a medium through which to commu- 
 nicate. 

Now, Mr. Editor, suppose you gentlemen, just for 
 once, forego your jealously guarded prerogative of 
 doing all the talking, and all the writing, and give up 
 a page or so of the Farm Journal to our use, as a 
 Domestic Department, and invite the "wise women" 
 to contriljute of their intellectual wealth ? All the 
 benefits, you know, would ultimately accrue to your- 
 selves, in the increase of your wealth and home com- 
 forts. And then you might allow us to aid each other 
 in the management and education of our children, 
 and also to enlighten each other on improved modes 
 of floriculture ; and to give useful recipes and speci- 
 fics for such ills as afflict children, chickens, &c. 

By the way, I have made a discovery in the floral 
 kingdom wliich is worth disseminating. It was acci- 
 dental like all important discoveries. I gave a sick 
 cliild some hyacinths to amuse himself with, merely 
 the flower stalks carelessly broken off, and the next 
 morning, as they lay withering on my table, I pitied 
 them, as I do all drooping things, and taking tliem 
 up, thrust, with my pen-holder, holes in the earth of a 
 pot in which plants were growing, and fixed the 
 stalks in the damp earth. After a few hours they 
 revived, but a few days subsequent, after the blos- 
 soms were withered, I drew them out to throw them 
 away, and was surprised to find that they had formed 
 bulbs at the bottom of the stems. Since then I have 
 repeated the experiment, always with success. They 
 invariably wilt at first, and sometimes do not straight- 
 en themselves up, until the seventh or eighth day. I 
 have not tried any other flower, but intend this sum- 
 mer to make the experiment with tulips. Any lady 
 may, in this manner, rear hyacinths from a withered 
 boquet. L\'dia Jane Pieeson.

One cow well fed will be of more profit than two 
 kept on the same fodder. This will also apply to 
 other stock. 

One ton of hay cut when the grass begins to blos-

 the seed is ripe.

JTorthumberlaud Agricultural Society. 

Our friends in Northumberland are moving ener- 
 getically, as will be seen by the following extract 
 from a letter of a correspondent at that place : 

" We have just organized an Agricultural Societyl 
 Our success very far exceeded our best hopes. Men 
 from all parts of the county were present to partici- 
 pate — men of energy and character — and we have 
 started under circumstances that lai'ger couutiea 
 might well envy.

 C. Horton, Alexander Jordan, John B. Heller, Saml. 
 Shannon, Henry Reader, Daniel Lenker, Elisha Kline,

 whose names I have forgotten. 

We will try to make Northumberland furnish her 
 one hundred subscriljers to the Farm Journal." 

Lancaster County Agricultural Society. 

Mr. Editor : — I attended a special meeting of the 
 Lancaster County Society on the 19th of May, 
 and was much pleased with the spirit which charac- 
 terized the proceedings, although I could not but 
 regret that the attendance was so very slim. Scarcely 
 a quorum was present, although business of impor- 
 tance claimed attention. This should not be, and 
 our farmers and friends of the Society should now 
 put forth a special effort to secure not only a full at- 
 tendance at the meetings, but to render these meet- 
 ings profitable and influential. Almost every county 
 in the State is forming a Society. The Susquehan- 
 na, Montgomery, Bucks, and other County Socie- 
 ties are making preparations for holding their Annu- 
 al Exhibitions. The Chester County Horticultural 
 Society holds its Semi-Annual Exhiljition during the 
 coming month, and on every side we behold eviden- 
 ces of progress on the part of the farming communi- 
 ty. Where is Lancaster, the "Garden Spot" of 
 Pennsylvania — the agricultural centre of the State — 
 the district which for a century, almost, has hold the 
 first place in agricultural importance ? What is she 
 doing to help the great reform that is going on 
 throughout the State 1 I am sorry to say, literally 
 nothing. A few noble, persevering men, arc strain- 
 ing every point to wake up her farmers to a just 
 sense of the importance of moving energetically and 
 in a body : but so lukewarmly are they supported, 
 that hope has almost abandoned them. The pros- 
 pect ahead, (if the past be taken as a criterion) is 
 any thing but cheering, yet those who have perse- 
 vered thus far should not despair. There is a better 
 day coming, although discouragement has marked 
 every step for months past. Let us hope that the 
 day will come and speedily, when this apathetic 
 spirit will give way to energetic action — when our 
 farmers will feel the importance of the position tliey 
 occupy, and with a hearty good will, engage in plac- 
 ing our noble county in her true position.
