Elements of Latin Pronunciation, for the use of stu- 
 dents in Lanijuarie, Law, Medicine, Zoolorjy, Botany, 
 and the sciences (jeneraUy in which Latin words are 
 used, by S. S. Ilaldeman, A. M., Professor of Na- 
 tural History in tlio University of Pa. Pliilad. 
 Lippineott, Grambo & Co. 1851. 8vo. pp. 76. 
 It is somcwliat singular that among the numerous 
 works devoted to Latin instruction vrhich are publish- 
 ed every year, the important subject oi pronunciation 
 should have been neglected to such an extent that 
 this is the first American book upon the suliject. 

The assertion of John "Walker, that the pronuncia- 
 tion of Latin cannot be ascertained, is still believed 
 by many, although the suljject has been fully dis- 
 cussed _ by the ancient grammarians; and upwards 
 of fifty ancient author.s have thrown light upon va- 
 rious poiu'a. For example, the ancients assert that 
 C and K have the same power, and that A E have a 
 double sound, so that the first syllables of the Gorman 
 Kaiser and leid, and their originals, the Latin Cresar 
 and Lajdo, are identical. The Portuguese retain the 
 original sound of se, and as they were the first to 
 write many names of maritime cities, &c., we are 
 thereby made acquainted with the mode of pronoun- 
 cing words like ShanJjhae (shang-high.) 

We observe a few typographical errors, such as a 
 diaeresis mark in the middle of a word in P29. The 
 name vilcsia on page 76 should have been viLxii; 
 and if the 6tli line from the bottom on p. 61, is in- 
 tended as an imitation of Virgil's first line, the third 
 and fourth words should have been tjelow and sad. 

Some new principles of etymology are laid down, 
 and the origin of several words pointed out which 
 were previously doubtful. According to these, it 
 would seem preferrable to refer the name vaccinum 
 (now applied to the hucldeherry) to bacca a tjerry, 
 rather than to ny.ACiNTHCs, to which the dictionaries 
 refer it. 

Parents interested in the question will of course 
 have to determine whether their children shall be 
 taught Latin, or some jargon which goes under the 
 name; whilst those who are entrusted with this 
 branch of education should study the subject more 
 fully than the ordinary grammars enable them to do. 

Rural Economy in its relation with Chemistry, Phy- 
 sics, and Meteorology; or. Chemistry applied to 
 Agriculture. By J. B. Boussingault. New York. 
 D. Appleton & Co. 18.50. 12mo. pp. 507. 
 The author of this volume is a member of the 
 French Institute, and well known as a ma,n of great 
 scientific research. The work is extensive, and is 
 devoted to those branches of rural economy which 
 can bo illustrated with the aid of the physical sciences. 
 It consequently treats of the composition of vegetables 
 and soils, the nature and applicability of the various 
 kinds of mineral and organic manures, the theory of 
 the rotation of crops, the maintenance of live stock, 
 and the bearings of meteorology, or the general effects 
 of temperature and atmospheric agents. The valua- 
 ble researches of Mr. Boucherie on the preservation 
 of timber are detailed in it. 

We have been favored with a copy of the above 
 works by Messrs. Jones & Co., Booksellers, 4th and 
 llace streets, Philadelphia. 

T7ie Compute Farmer and Gardener. By Thomas 
 G. Fessenden, New York: C. M. Saxton. 1851. 
 pp. G50. 

This thick volume of sixiiuudred and fifty pages, 
 is made up of two works bound together, the one 
 devoted to fiirming, and the other to gardening. This 
 is the tenth edition improved and enlarged, of the 
 former ; and the thirtieth edition of the latter, which 
 had nine years start of the other. Such an extensive 
 demand proves both the high estimation in which 
 these books are held, and the extent to which a de- 
 sire for information from reliable sources, has spread 
 among the community of cultivators. The latter fact 
 is also proved by the great nvimljer of works from 
 small manuals to large Encyclopaedias, issued for the 
 benefit of the same class of readers. 

Mr. Fessenden's position as editor of the Keic Eng- 
 land Farmer, gave him fooilities for preparing these 
 works, and he has made a judicious use of his ma- 
 terials. 

The Agriculture and Rural Economy of France, Bel- 
 gium and Switzerland ; from personal ohsercation. 
 By Henry Colman. Boston, 18-18. Arthur D.Phelps. 
 8vo. pp. 304. 

" In regard to any agricultural operation, or crop, 
 or improvement, the most full, explicit, and practical 
 directions are given, and every peculiar feature 
 brought prominently forward. Many things are 
 omitted because they are of doubtful utility, or of 
 uncertain authority. His great object has been, not 
 to publish theories, but to state facts ; and the deter- 
 mined results of enlightened, exact, and conclusive 
 experiments." — Author's preface. 

Bulletin of the American Art-Union, Keio York. Se- 
 ries for 1851. April, No. 1. 

The American Art-Union publishes for its mem- 
 bers alone. The Bulletin of the American Art Union, 
 a monthly Journal of Art. The first number for 
 1851, has been received. We perceive that it con- 
 tains the affairs and plan of the institution, with in- 
 teresting varieties of art-literature, including essays, 
 descriptions, anecdotes, criticisms, and foreign and 
 domestic correspondence, — also of a dictionary of 
 art, embracing biographical notices of artists, ancient 
 and modern, American and foreign, living and dead, 
 technical terms of art and science, &.c. Each Bulle- 
 tin is also to be illustrated by several original en- 
 gravings, outlines, and prints of an interesting char- 
 acter. The whole will form, annually, a beautiful 
 and useful quarto volume, for amusement, instruction 
 and reference.
