Spanish Merino.—" The history of this celebra- 
 ted race of sheep, so far as it is known, has so oft- 
 en been brought before the public that it is deemed 
 unnecessary liere to recapitulate it. Tlie first impor- 
 tation r«f them into the United States took place in 
 1801. Four were shipped by Mv. Delessert, a bank- 
 er of Paris, three of which perished on the passage. 
 Tlie fourth arrived in safety at llosondale, a form 
 owned by that gentleman near Kingston, in this 
 State. The same year Mr. Seth Adams, of Massa- 
 cliusetts, imported a pair from France. In 1802, 
 two pairs were sent from France by Mr. Livingston, 
 the American Minister, to his estate on the Hudson ; 
 and later the same year, Jlr. llumphrys, our Span- 
 ish Minister, shipped two hundred, on his departure 
 from that country, for the United States." Hon. 
 William Jarvis, of Weathersfield, Vermont, then 

American Consul at Lisbon, sent home large and 
 valuable flocks in 1809, 1810, and 1811. The par- 
 ticularly favorable circumstances for obtaining the 
 choicest sheep of Spain, under which these were 
 procured, j'ou will hud detailed in a letter to me 
 from Mr. Jarvis, dated December, 1841, published in 
 the Transactions of the New-York State Agricultu- 
 ral Society of that year. Various subsequent impor- 
 tations took place, which it is not important to par- 
 ticularize. 

The Merinos " attracted little notice, until our dif- 
 ficulties with England led to a cessation of commer- 
 cial intercourse with that power, in 1808 and 1809. 
 The attention of the country being then directed 
 toward manufacturing and wool-growing, the Merino 
 rose into importance. So great, indeed, was the in- 
 terest excited, that from a thousand to fourteen hun- 
 dred dollars a head was paid for them." Unfortu- 
 nately some of the latter importations "arrived in 

MERINO RAM.

the worst condition, bringing with them those scour- 
 ges of the ovine race, the scab and foot-rot. These 
 evils and tlie increased supply, soon lirought them 
 down to less than a twentieth part of their former 
 price ; they could now be bought for $20 a head. — 
 ^Vhen, boAvevcr, it was established, by actual experi- 
 ment, that their wool did not deteriorate, as had 
 ,been feared by many, in tliis country, and that they 
 l5ecame readily acclimated, they again rose into fa- 
 vor. But the prostration of our manufactories, which 
 soon after ensued, rendered the Merino comparative- 
 ly of little value, and brought ruin to numliers who 
 had purchased them at their previous high prices. — 
 The rise which has since taken place in the value of 
 fine wool, as well as the causes which led to it, are 
 too recent and well understood to require particu- 
 lar notice. With fJie rise of wool, the value of the 
 sheep which Ijcars it has of course kept pace. 

" The Merino has been variously described. This 
 arises from the fact that it is but the general appella- 
 tion of a breed, comprising several varieties, present- 
 ing essential point of difference in size, form, quality 
 and quantity of wool." And writers of high author- 

ity differ even in their descriptions of these families 
 or varieties. M. Lasteyrie, so celebrated as a writer 
 on sheep, and particularly on the Merino, and Mr. 
 Jcr\ns directly contradict each other on several 
 points. It is scarcely necessary now to quote their 
 conflicting statements, or inquire which is riglit — as 
 the questions involved possess no practical imjior- 
 tance. The families have, generally, been merged, 
 by interbreeding, in the United States and other 
 countries wliich have received the race from Spain. 
 Purity of Merino blood, and actual excellence in tlie 
 individual and its ancestors, has long since been the 
 only standard which has guided sensible men in se- 
 lecting sheep of this breed. Families have indeed 
 sprung up, in this country, exhibiting wider points 
 of difference than did those of Spain. In some cases 
 they doubtless owe it to particular courses of breed- 
 ing — but more often, proljably, to concealed or for- 
 gotten infusions of other blood. ' 

The American Merino has, as is already intimated, 
 diverged into families or varieties presenting wide 
 points of difference. The minor distinctions are nu- 
 merous, but they may all, perhaps, bo classed under
