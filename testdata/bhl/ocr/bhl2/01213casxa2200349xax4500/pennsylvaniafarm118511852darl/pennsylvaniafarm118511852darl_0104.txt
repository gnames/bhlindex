Croasdale's Seed Deill and Broadcast Sower. — 
 Since our last,\ve have had an opportunity of examin- 
 ing this useful implement, and cheerfully commend 
 it to the attention of the farming community. Sim- 
 ple in construction, yet accurate in its work, and at 
 the same time furnished at a price which places it 
 ■within the reach of every farmer, we cannot but 
 think that it will become the favorite drill for farmers. 

For the benefit of our Lancaster County readers, 
 we state that one of these drills may be seen for a 
 short time at Hubley's Swan Hotel, Lancaster City, 
 •where Mr. Carr is in attendance to give all necessary 
 information in regard to it. 

The annexed certificate from a practical farmer in 
 our immediate vicinity, will be read with interest in 
 connection with the advertisement to be found on the 
 second page of the cover of this number, to which 
 ■we call attention. 

I certify that I used Croasdale's Patent Seed Drill 
 and broadcast Sower in putting in part of my wheat 
 crop last fall. 

It was put two drills in each furrow on a corn 
 stubble and the whole work was done at one opera- 
 tion, (seeding and plowing at the same time) in the 
 most satisfactory manner. 

AVlicre known it must come into general use — in 
 my judgment it surpasses all other drills, because it 
 can be attached to anv plow and used wherever a 
 plow will work; it puts the seed in one drill of any 
 width you choose to plow or two drills in each fur- 
 row, or it will spread the grain over the furrow any 
 width preferred. It is the simplest, )jest and cheap- 
 est machine that I have seen. 

From the aljove it will be seen to be more rcqjid 
 than the largo drills. Daniel Potts.

FOR SOD AND SUB-SOIL. 

THIS Plow, in the language of the Report of Committee on the 
 great trial of Plows in June last, appointed by the New York 
 State Agricultural Society, (by whom it was awarded a special 
 premium): " We regard this implement as a moat useful present 
 from the mechanic to the farmer, and in our opinion will effect a 
 great improvement in the tillage of land, ]i pulverizts the soil in 
 an excellent manner, which, to be fully appreciated, must be seen; 
 and it accomplishes this pulverization with an amount of power 
 which, in reference to the work performed, is certainly not large. 
 It buries the sod completely, aud covers it with ,a coating of loose 
 earth which makes a seed bed almost as perfectly a,s a spade." 

At Boston, last season, this Plow was awarded a ({old Medai.-, 
 and at every County Fair in the State of New York, at which it 
 was exhibited, the Proprietor received a Premium.
