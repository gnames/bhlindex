A CHALLENGE ! ! ! 

THE dppp interest now taken by AgricuUuripta in all descrip- 
 tions of manure, would seem to justify any expedient, by 
 which fair and unprejudiced experiments may be made of tile th- 
 rious descriptions of manure at this time attracting the attention 
 of the public, in view of this, and the undersigned honestly be- 
 liering that the Chemical Compound, manufactured by them, is 
 the best manure of which any knowledge is had for a Corn CrOji; 
 challenges Guano to the test upon the following condition;— He 
 will forfeit One Hundred Dollars, to be presented to the Maryland 
 Agricultural Society, if any advocate of Guano will do the same, 
 that the Renovator compounded by KettlewcU Si Davison, will 
 produce upon any soil, the largest crop of weislied corn, without 
 regard to the size of the stalk, provided the President of the State 
 Agricultural Society will select some pcr.son, in his judgment 
 qualified, to superintend the experiment. The nature of the soil 
 to be described, so that each party can direct the mode of appli- 
 cation; two liarrels of the Salts to be used per acre, costing f6. 
 and 3U0 lbs. of the Guano, costing $7 20, the party making the 
 experiment to receive the manure free of cost. And the same 
 amount against any manure as a top dressing upon timothy or 
 clover. JoH.^ Ketti^ewell. 

Ketthwell ^- Dnvi^on again call the attention of Agriculturists 
 to their various Chemical Manures— and in so doing, they would 
 be insensible to common gratitude, if they failed to express their 
 profound acknowledgments for the constant and increasing de- 
 mand, which flows in upon them for their .simple and compound 
 manures. Each season has greatly increased their sales, extend- 
 ing as far south as South Carolina. 

They can give no stronger evidence of their faith in the vir- 
 tues of their manure, as the best known for a corn crop, than the 
 tenders they make above ; and the certificates which they here- 
 with present. In the offer of a test, it ia not the amount involv- 
 ed, but the willingness to challenge result, that speaks their in- 
 tegrity and confidence. We could add any amount to the testi- 
 mony we publish; but if the names we refer to, do not command 
 confidence, no additional number could. \Ve have never boasted 
 of the quahty of our article, wo have been content to leave a de- 
 cision to time, demand and experiment, that has been in our fa- 
 vor—hoping, if wo h■^ve less of •' Bi-phosphates," the public would 
 discover it, as they would if it was found we had more of" sand " 
 than any thing else, Kettleweli, & Datisos,

BI-PHOSPHATES. 

M''e keep constantly on hand this valuable manure. Bones, 
 ■with a proper portion of the Sulphate of Ammonia, dissolved in 
 Sulphuric Acid. The Chemists of this country and Europe have 
 been pressing this mode of using bone-dust upon the atten- 
 tion of farmers, with great zeal and ability of recent years. Ev- 
 ery experiment has confirmed the truthfulness of their theory; 
 and we hazard but little in saying that in a very brief time it 
 will be used in no other way. It is prepared so as to be sown sun 
 liar to the salts, at the rate of one or two barrels to the acre — 
 The price of this article is $4 per barrel. Let the farmer who 
 doubts, try it at a less expense than the old mode of using bonc- 
 - dust. 

TOBACCO GENERATOR. 

This is a chemical compound, made expressly for the growth ot 
 the Tobacco plant. We will call more special attention to it at 
 the proper season. 

CHEMICAL RESIDIUMS. 

We have constantly on hand Chemical Residinms of every 
 description. Full informaiion of which can be had by applica- 
 tion to us, 

COMBLNATION OF GROUND PLASTER AND 
 POTASH. 

This is a preparation made for soil deficient in Potash, of which 
 deficiency there is. unfortunately, too many instances in much of 
 our Maryland land. For this compound we arc indebted to the 
 suggestion of an accomplished Agriculturist of Prince Gcorge'.s 
 county, who may at some future day present the result ot his ox- 
 periment. The price of this is $3 50 per barrel. 

DIRECTIONS. 

The mode of using the Renovator is simple, inexpensive, and 
 rcjuiring but little labor. The farmer must hear in mind, that 
 in the preparation of his soil he shares an equal responsibility in 
 testing the merits of any manure. Land neghgently or badly 
 cultivated gives no manure a fair chance. How to put land in or- 
 der he ought to know better than we can teach him; and if he 
 don't know, should learn as speedily as possible. The land, then, 
 in order— if one barrel to the acre is used— and this quantity de- 
 pends upon the quality of the land— it should, for grain be sown 
 broad cast, and slightly harrowed in. 

If two barrels arc used, one as stated above, and the other aa a 
 top-dres.sing upon the wheat or rye, early in the spring at the 
 commencement of the first thaw. Upon grass it should be sown 
 brnad-cast upon the timothy or clover. On corn, either broad- 
 cast or in the hill. Where two barreLs are used, one each way

CONTINUE their manufactory at the corner of Liberty and 
 Hamilton streets. ALB.ANV, where they are prepared to fill 
 all orders with despatch. 

ORDERS FOR 

Wheeler's Patent Railway, Chain Horse Foifers, and 
 Overshot Threshers and Separators, will re- 
 ceive their prompt attention. 

,Qf5" The large and increasing demand for these Machines haa 
 induced the Proprietors to erect a New and Spacious Manufacto- 
 ry, and otherwise extend their means of promptly filling orders.— 
 Their Powers and Threshers have been sold in nearly every State 
 in the Union, during the past year, and their superiority has been 
 acknowledged by numerous testimonials, not only from Agricul- 
 tural Societies but from persons who have used them. They 
 have been awarded the First Premiums at all the principal Fairs 
 where they have been exhibited in operation, including the Penn- 
 sylvania State F.iir. the Provincial Fair of Upper Canada, and the 
 .Michigan aud Ohio State Fair.s. together with numerous County 
 Exhibitions in the different States. 

The TWO HORSE MACHINE, with from three to five hands, 
 will thresh from 125 to 200 bushels of Wheat per day, or twice that 
 quantity of Oats, 

The One Horse Machine will thresh rather more than half that 
 quantity.

Machines will be shipped to order to any part of the United 
 States or the Canada,s, &^ and warranted to give satii/action to 
 the purchaser, or they may he returned within sixty days. 

The subscribers also manufacture and will furnish to order tha 
 most approved kinds of
