Cicada septeudecim. 

For the purpose of ascertaining the length of time 
 that this insect lives after the period of depositing its 
 eggs, Tce took four pair on the 11th of June, which 
 •were attached together. These we kept in a vessel in 
 the house without food except a bit of the branch of 
 an apple tree, which soon withered. On the 13tli, one 
 pair being nearly dead, was rejected, and one pair 
 was placed upon a small birch tree, and the other 
 two pair upon a low branch of an apple tree. In 
 each case a glass jar covered with gauze was sus- 
 pended over the insects and branch, so that they 
 could be kept safe and readily observed. 

Of the pair upon birch, the male soon commenced 
 inserting its haustdlum or snout into the bark for the 
 purpose of sucking the sap. The female did not com- 
 mence making perforations and depositing her eggs 
 until the afternoon of the loth, and she seems to have 
 oviposited but once. She and her mate are still liv- 
 ing on the 18th. 

Of the three pair placed on the apple branch on 
 the morning of the 13th, one female oviated on the 
 afternoon of the same day. 

14th. Morning — Two males and one female have 
 died. More eggs deposited in the afternoon by both 
 of the two surviving females. 

15th. Morning — One of the two females is ovipo- 
 siting. 

16th. Both females are ovipositing forenoon and 
 afternoon. 

17th. One of these dies in the afternoon, and upon 
 being opened, is found to contain a number of unde- 
 positod eggs. 

18th. The remaining female is still living. 

In forming a perforation for her eggs, the female 
 stands lengthways upon the branch (her head being 
 cither towards or from the tree) when she raises her 
 body and brings her ovipositor or boring organ ver- 
 tically upon the branch, and although it sometimes 
 slips aside, she finally fixes it by pressing the point 
 of the middle or gouge-shaped portion on the bark, 
 where she moves it up and down about twice in a 
 second, supported by the two side pieces, which are 
 kept quiet upon the surface and follow it afterwards 
 as rapidly as the size of the hole admits. In two 
 minutes the point has entered, when she lowers her 
 body, which gives the instrument a slanting direction 
 backwards and downwards, and permits her to use it 
 as a lever to raise the fibres. She proceeds along the 
 branch boring and depositing at the rate of about an 
 inch an hour. It requires about fifteen minues from 
 the time of commencing a perforation until the ovi- 
 positor is inserted at its base in the wood. The eggs 
 are pearly white, tapering towards both ends, and 
 about a twelfth of an inch long and one-seventieth 
 in diameter. According to Dr. N. Potter, of Balti- 
 more, the eggs hatch in Jtfty-itco days. 

A few individuals of this insect appear every year. 

and it is probable that the time must arrive whelk 
 they ^vill be annual like the ordinary species. Some 
 have supposed that they may occasionally retard of 
 anticipate their usual period by a year or two, but 
 there is no evidence of such being the case, early and 
 late individuals being probably descended from oth- 
 ers which were equally out of the range of the regu- 
 lar appearance. 

The sting of this insect seems to be dangerous, but 
 there is no account of the organ with which the punc- 
 ture is made. This is probably the ovipositor of the 
 female, as the haustel'um (which inflicts a poisonous 
 wound in some insecis belonging to the same order) 
 is hardly strong en«ugh to the pierce the skin. 

Suildiug Material. 

An effort is making in "Washington to have tbt 
 public buildinjs hereafter constructed of the inferior 
 sandstone usei in the Capitol and Patent office, rath- 
 er than of thj more durable and ornamental marble, 
 but it is to le hoped that there is sufficient science in 
 Washingtoi to prevent such a result. Some sand- 
 stones are good and durable, and that used for the 
 Smithsonian building seems to be of an exeelleni 
 quality, although rather dark in color. 

Cast iron is coming into use as a building material, 
 but some imagine that it is necessary to paint it hlaclt 
 to resemble the natural shade of iron, but iron is not 
 black, but grey when freshly broken, and some shade 
 of brown or oolire extern^ly, so that black is not 
 suggestive of the material. Moreover, as it is lot 
 customary to paint wooden coliunns so as to indicste 
 whether they are of pine or oak, there is no necessilj 
 of making this indication with iron. Much black la 
 too conspicuous among light colors to make a plea- 
 sant impression, and on this account it should be 
 avoided. 

To Correspondents. 
 J. S. BLeller. — Two insects which resemble each 
 other pretty closely, destroy garden vegetables. Of 
 one of these we have a cut, which we 
 give here, and the other ( Galeruca viL 
 tata) will be^figured hereafter. In the 
 mean time, a single figure, with some 
 explanations, will serve for the identifi- 
 cation of both. 
 CRiocERis The crioceria is about half the size 
 TRiLiNEATA. of the figure, or a fourth of an inch 
 long, of a brownish yellow, with two black dots up<» 
 the prothorax or part following the head, and three 
 black lines along the elytra as represented in the cut 
 This species is common upon potato vines, and Dr. 
 Harris (Injurious Insects, p. 96,) recommends them 
 to be brushed into shallow vessels of salt and water, 
 or vinegar. 

The insects sent by our correspondent came crush- 
 ed. They are the Gideruca vittaia, which is one-fifth 
 of an inch long, pale yellow above, with the bead aod
