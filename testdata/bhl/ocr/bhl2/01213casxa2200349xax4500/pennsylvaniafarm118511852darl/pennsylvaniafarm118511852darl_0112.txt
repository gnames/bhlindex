three stripes along the elytra black, the under parts 
 heing mostly black. Dr. Harris (p. 101) has brought 
 together various remedies, as charcoal dust or scotch 
 snuif sprinkled when the plants are wet vith dew, an 
 infusion of tobacco or red popper mixed, of elder or 
 ■walnut leaves, hops — a solution of an ounce of Glau- 
 ber salts in a quart of water. " As these insects fly 
 by night as well as by day, and are attracted by 
 lights, lighted splinters of pine knots, or of staves of 
 tar-barrels, stuck in the ground during the night, 
 around the plants, have been found useful in destroy- 
 ing these beetles. The most effectual prcsorvative 
 against these insects, and the equally destructive 
 black flea-bootlcs which infest the vines in the spring, 
 consists in covering the yoiinij v't^ies u'itJi milUnd 
 stretched over small wooden frames.'' 

The flea-beetles here sjluded to are 
 minute Cohoptera of the g?nus Haliica, 
 of various species. They aie often term- 
 ed cucumber fleas on account of their 
 small size and leaping powers, We give 
 an enlarged figure of one species as an 
 example. 
 Mr. Levi Bartlett describes his milliuet frames as 
 flows in the N. England Farmer, vol. 2, p. 305, co- 
 ed in Fessenden's American Farmer, p. 91. "Take 
 strip of pine board (about three-fourths of an inch 
 j thickness is most suitable) eight or ten feet in 
 /Dgth, and four or five inches in width— plow one 
 'me edge of it with a carpenter's plotr or match plain 
 i — tlen work off an equal number of side and end 
 j pie'CS ; before sawing the side pieces run a brad-awl 
 ' tlvough where you want to drive your nails, as it is 
 Hot so likely to split as after it is sawed. The side 
 pieces eleven inches long — the end pieces eight inches 
 long. They must be of this particular size, because 
 one yard of millinet will just cover nine boxes ; or a 
 third of a yard will make three covers. After having 
 nailed your boxes and divided your millinet, have 
 some strips or tongues, as the carpenters call them. 
 Press these with the edges of the covers into the 
 grooves, which fastens them much cheaper and more 
 lespeditiously than small nails. I made about twenty 
 hast season, and they effectually secured them from 
 Uie yellow bug, and (by sinking the edges of them in 
 the earth a little) from worms. But if they were of 
 /bo use but •to guard against insects, they would be 
 / ■worth having, as they keep off the cold winds, and 
 / greatly promote the growth of the vines in the early 
 / part of the season." 


Lard Candlm. — A correspondent of the Michigan 
 Farmer, gives the following method of making can- 
 dles of hog's lard, which he says prove of the best 
 quality. Put all the lard, say enough for 5 lbs. of 
 candles, in the smelter; after it attains a heat of 
 about 200 Fahr. throw in 3 or 4 ounces of lime, and 
 about an ounce of aquafortis, and then mould them. 
 The lime purifies the grease and the acquafortis 
 hardens it. 

State Agricultural Fair. 

The following circular addressed to the people of 
 Pennsylvania, by Hon. Frederick Watts, President 
 of the State Agricultural Society, is a forcible appeal, 
 and one to which we ask the careful attention of our 
 readers. It should be remembered by every far- 
 mer in Pennsylvania, that this, the first exhibition 
 ever held under the auspices of the State, is looked 
 forward to with groat interest by the friends of agri- 
 culture elsewhere. Active preparations arc going on 
 in other States to provide articles for exhibition. — 
 Will our own people stand back and be mere specta- 
 tors, or will they, with true State pride, put forth a 
 strong and vigorous effort in behalf of the cxhibitiou? 
 We hope and believe they will, and we confidently 
 look forward to such a display as will reflect credit 
 upon the State. 

To THE People ov Pennsylvania: 

It will not be forgotten that the State Agricultural 
 Society of Pennsylvania has fixed Harrisburg as the 
 place, and the 23d, 24th and 25th of October next as 
 the time for their Annual Exhibition. There is no 
 State in the Union whose climate, soil and the habits 
 of whose people afford more ample resources than our 
 o^mi for a creditable exhibition of their skill and in- 
 dustry. There is nothing raised, grown or manufac- 
 tured upon the face of the earth, which is not more 
 or less interesting in the study and science of Agri- 
 culture. The farmer, the horticulturist, the inventor, 
 the mechanic, are all cordially and earnestly invited 
 to contribute and partake in the interest which will 
 be excited l.iy the occasion ; and especially do we in- 
 vite the aid, countenance and presence of our moth- 
 ers and daughters, upon whose handy-work and good 
 example we are so dependent for all the domestic 
 comforts of li^e. 

Arrangements are now being made for enclosing 
 the grounds, and providing separate and safe places 
 for all articles which shall be presented for exhibition. 
 All the canals and railways of the State will be open 
 free of charge for their transportation to Harrisburg, 
 and visitors wiU come and go on them at one half the 
 usual rates. 

The young men of the State are reminded that the 
 Ploughing Match will afford them an opportunity 
 for the display of their skill, the training of their 
 teams and the fitness of their instruments. 

While we address this communication to the peo- 
 ple of our State, it will not bo understood that it is 
 designed to exclude the citizens of other States ; much 
 less to avoid the honorable competition which their 
 contributions may afford. Now is the time to pro- 
 pare. By dii'oction of the Executive Committee.

TuE disease which has so seriously affected the 
 orange groves of Florida, for several years past, is 
 passing away, and orange growers are again turning 
 their attention to this profitable cultivation. 

There are about one hundred and seventy mills in 
 Lancaster county, and wheat enough raised to keep 
 them all busy.
