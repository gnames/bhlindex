The Potato. 

Mr. Editor : — This plant is a native of Chili, 
 South America, and was first described by Clausius, 
 a German botanist, of which there is a plate among 
 his rare plants. Sir Walter Raleigh found the In- 
 dians cultivating it in Virginia, and he carried some 
 of the tubers home to England on his return from 
 America in 1586. How it got from South America 
 to Virginia is not satisfactorily known. It is still 
 found growing wild in its native localities, but the 
 tubers are said to be small, and to possess an insipid 
 taste. The Indians called tljem iaraloiijiis, in Virgi- 
 nia they were called openawk. The Spaniards called 
 them Battatas. The Spanish name now is Batatina; 
 the German DicKautoffd; and French Pomme de ierre. 

It belongs to i\\e fifth class and first order in the 
 artificial system of Linnoeus, and to order Solanacea: 
 in the Natural System of Adamson. It was described 
 under four diflferent names. Solanum tuberosum, by 
 Linnajus ; Solanum csculentu7n,hj 'HackcT; Solamt?ii 
 parmenterii, by Molina; and Lycojpersicuni tuberosum 
 by P. Miller. The meaning of Solanum is uncertain, 
 but it is an ancient name and there are about five 
 hundred well defined species of this genera described. 
 The potato is evidently a Solanum, as well as the 
 white and purple egg plants, the former of which is 
 called Solanum melongena, and the latter Solanum 
 esculentum. The specific name of Linnjeus is univer- 
 sally adopted, and means tuberous Solanum. The 
 varieties of this species are very numerous, above 
 two hundred have been described, and new ones are 
 constantly being introduced, which is done by plant- 
 ing seeds chosen from the ripe potato apples. The 
 surest and best way to proceed is to squeeze out the 
 seeds and preserve them until the following spring in 
 dry sand. In March plant the seeds iu a hot bed or 
 in a bos in the house, and after the frosts are over 
 the seedling plants should be raised with as much 
 dirt around them as possible, and planted out in rich 
 and well pulverized ground, in rows about eighteen 
 inches apart, and the plants sot about sis inches 
 asunder. The ground should then be kept loose 
 around them and free from weeds: when ripe, the 
 roots should be cautiously kept from the frost. The 
 next season the roots should be planted out in the 
 common soil of the farm, and if properly attended to 
 they will arrive at their full size and perfection. 

The potato has many enemies, and from time to 
 time has been violently assailed with disease and 
 threatened with estermination. 

In 177(5, in the prineipality of Geottingen, a disease 
 called the curl made its appearance on the stem and 
 leaves of this plant; in 1779 it appeared in Hanover; 
 in 1780 in the British Isles; in 1792 it threatened to 
 exterminate potatoes in England; and in 1800 it pre- 
 sented the same disposition in Prussia. Some as- 

signed the cause to an insect called Phytocoris, bu 
 others attributed it to over ripe tubers. The remedy 
 was found to be, to change the seed for that from 
 higher latitudes. 

In 1780, a disease called the rust, attacked the po- 
 tato, similar to the rust in wheat. It raged in Ger 
 many with groat severity; and at difi"erent times and 
 places the rusts, mildews, &c., have frequently de- 
 sti-oyed the crops of this vegetable. They are attri. 
 buted to the attacks of several species of fungus 
 among which are several species of Botrytis, Uredo 
 tuberosum, Fusiporium solanii and Fusiporium spo- 
 rotrichoides. The Protomyces solanii often attacks 
 the potato in cellars, and badly ventilated places. — 
 Plaster, lime, sulphur, salt and ashes, are beneficial 
 applications in these diseases: fermenting and slowly 
 decomposing vegetable matters appear to be the prin- 
 cipal cause of these diseases. 

In 1782, a disease called the scab made its appear- 
 ance in Europe and prevailed to a considerable ex- 
 tent. A dry sandy soil, and high cultivation, seemed 
 to be the best preventative. 

In 1769, a disease called the rot, and nearly allied 
 to the disease now prevailing, made its appearance in 
 Germany; in 1783 in Prussia; in 1830 in France ; in 
 1834 iu Great Britain, where it threatened the total 
 destruction of the potato crop ; in 1839 in Kussia ; 
 and in 1840 in Bohemia. Some assigned the cause 
 of this disease to the habit of cutting the seed into 
 thin slices, others however assign it to the attacks of 
 a fxingi or peculiar species of mushroom. A healthy 
 condition of the soil, and strong sound plants were 
 the best preventatives. 

In 1829, a disease called the blue rot or blue tumor, 
 made its appearance in Germany, and spread through 
 Saxony and the Upper Hartz. "Blue spots and ris- 
 ings are first observed on the skin of the tubers, af- 
 terwards a dark colored texture similar to a rhizomc- 
 pha appears, which surrounds the tuber, penetrating 
 even its interior, followed by blue spots and streaks 
 in the heart of its substance." A mixture of saw 
 dust with dung, it is said, was the cause of it. 

In 1840, an insect called the Phytocoris lincolarig 
 attacked the potato in some of the New England 
 States, ahd about the same time tJie Aphis vastaior 
 in Europe, but they did not produce much mischief. 

In 1843, the existing murrain or potato rot made 
 its appearance in Prussia and in the United States ; 
 in 1844 in the south of Europe ; and in 1845 it spread 
 over nearly all the middle and north of Europe, to- 
 tally destroying the whole crop in many places, and 
 leaving famine behind it. It has spread more gener- 
 ally and been more destructive than any other dis- 
 ease that has assailed this important vegetable. Nor 
 does it seem to be confined to the potato alone ; in 
 some districts tulips, hyacinths, carrots, onions, to- 
 matoes, and in Jamaica, the yams and cocoa have 
 suffered from the same or a similar disease. 

The cause is yet a mystery. It appears like a veg-
