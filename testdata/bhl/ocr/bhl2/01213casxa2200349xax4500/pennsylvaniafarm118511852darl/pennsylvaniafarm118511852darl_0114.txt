etable cholera, and moves with singular rapidity and 
 precision. This vegetable cholera is, no doubt, the 
 result of a vegetable parasite, similar to the entophoza 
 that attacks the mucous membrane of animals. It 
 appears that dry gravelly soils are the best suited to 
 avoid the attacks of the disease. Putrescent manures 
 should be avoided, and a free use of charcoal, salt 
 and lime, are among the best preventatives. Plant 
 early and dig the potatoes before the ground gets 
 wot and cold in the fall ; then pack them away in 
 charcoal, and you will probably escape the rot. I 
 ^aw a large amount of potatoes opened this spring 
 that had been packed away in "coal hreys," at one 
 of our furnaces, and they were generally sound, while 
 some that, had been stowed away in the visual 
 ■manner entirely perished. I would suggest this plan : 
 lay down a layer of potatoes, slightly cover with fine 
 charcoal, then another layer of potatoes and charcoal, 
 and thus form a heap, which cover in the usual loay. 

We have reason to believe that in a few years the 
 disease will disappear, and we will be again permit- 
 ted to enjoy the use of this favorite esculent.

Remedy for a Cow who sucks herself. 

Mr. Editor : — Hearing recently an effectual cure 
 for this inveterate habit, and at the same time a very 
 simple one, which has been tried in this vicinity and 
 found to answer completely, I send it for insertion in 
 the Farm Journal. 

Draw the cow up by a halter to a fence corner, or 
 stall in the stable, and insert in the same manner as 
 a ring is put into a bull's nose, a round stick through 
 the cartilage which divides the nostril, (and which 
 is quickly done by a single blow with a mallet,) say 
 about six inches long, and let it remain. It will oc- 
 casion no inconvenience to the cow, and whenever 
 ehe attempts to suck herself, it will cause such a 
 strain on the nose as to make her desist instantly. — 
 The proper length for the stick to extend each side 
 of the nose, can better be told upon trial, as it may 
 be lengthened or shortened, as may be found neces- 
 ary. To make it still more effectual it might be 
 pointed at each end. 

The habit of sucking herself in the cow, is one al- 
 Jnost impossible to break by any contrivance of yokes 
 Or muzzles, and it is not dissimilar to intemperance 
 In the human subject. Total abstinence being the 
 only safety, a taste being once had, self-control is 
 gone. I once had a valuable heifer, (I raised from 
 the celebrated McElroy cow,) who made 16 lbs. of 
 butter in a week, and which I was obliged almost to 
 give away on account of this habit. She promised to 
 bo equal to her dam in butter qualities, and many 
 expedients were tried to break her, but ineffectually. 
 A stiff muzzle was put on her, well supplied with 
 sharp spikes. Her udder, so violent was her fond- 

ness for her ovm milk, would often be scored with 
 deep cuts, and drops of blood, but she would still get 
 it. A stiff yoke on the neck was also tried, which 
 looked as if it would entirely prevent her turnihg her 
 head round. This also hurt her heep and was inef- 
 fectual. 

Had this cow been cured of this habit, she would 
 now have been worth $100. Her mother was a most 
 remarkable animal for deep milking, and her former 
 owner, before I purchased her, was said to have sent 
 to market from her, 17 lbs. of butter per week. She 
 made with me nearly 15 lbs. of butter a week, on grass 
 alone. Edge Cope, residing about two miles from 
 this place, and whose statement can be entirely re- 
 lied upon, now owns a heifer from her, who made 
 last season, when she was on trial and milked three 
 times a day, 17 lbs. of butter in a week. The milk 
 was weighed each time, instead of being measured, 
 and reached about 75 lbs. per day. He weighed it 
 himself to avoid mistakes. 

The simple recipe here given, and also one by 
 James Gowen in the first number of the Farm Jour- 
 nal, of the hay rope in cases of hoven, (and which I 
 also tried and thereby saved the life of a durham 
 bull which cost me S550,) are strong illustrations of 
 the value of agricultural journals, and are worth the 
 price of many years' subscription.

The Education of Farmers' Daughters. 

Mb. Editor: — As I cannot think the Farm Jour- 
 nal designed to lay before its readers such matters 
 only as relate to plowing, planting, mowing, reaping, 
 &c., and the education of farmers' sons, I ask a place 
 in your columns for a few remarks on a subject in- 
 teresting alike to all — the education of farmers' daugh- 
 ters. 

Much has been said and written on the subject of 
 education. The merits of colleges, academies and 
 agricultural schools have been thoroughly discussed. 
 But those all refer to the boys, while the girls arc 
 wholly uncared for, as though the cultivation of their 
 intellects was a matter of trifling importance. The 
 general impression appears to be, that they would 
 make just as good wives and daughters with no more 
 education than enabled them to read their Biblo 
 and almanac, as if their intellectual training were 
 such as every fanner's daughter should be. Does not 
 the mother exert a controlling influence over her 
 child ; and do not her teachings and example, in nine 
 cases out of ten, mould its future character? Many 
 of the greatest and best men who have ever lived, at- 
 tribute their virtues and greatness to the tender coun- 
 sels of their mothers. Who among us, does not owe 
 much that is commendable in our characters to the 
 same source ? How frequently do we hear the folly
