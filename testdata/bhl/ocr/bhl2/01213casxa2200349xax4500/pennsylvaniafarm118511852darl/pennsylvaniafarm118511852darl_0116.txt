a practical Agricultural Society among the tillers of 
 the soil, ill this State, was started. Dr. Darlington 
 and Charles Miner took a leading, active part, in 
 promoting its establishment, and Thomas Gold being 
 the President of the Berkshire Associaiion for the 
 same object, he wrote to him to send us an account 
 of their doings, with such hints as might occur to 
 him. Enclosed is a copy of his reply, which as it 
 contains a little history of "the first Society in the 
 world, icliich adopted a practical course, &c," you may 
 think it worth presenting to your readers now. 

A Friend to Agriculture. 

Mr. Miner : In answer to a request made at your 
 instance, on Ijehalf of the proposed Agricultural So- 
 ciety in this county, the enclosed communications 
 have been received from Thomas Gold, Esq., of Pitts- 
 field, Mass., one of the original promoters and some- 
 time President of the Berkshire Society. You will 
 no douljt think those passages of the letter which 
 have been marked, well worthy of publication, and 
 calculated to promote the object of a similar associa- 
 tion in this county. The writer is certainly entitled 
 to our best thanks, for the interest he has expressed 
 in our success, and for the pains which he has taken 
 to communicate his views. 

The Ode breathes the pure spirit of poetry, and 
 ■will no doubt grace a corner of your next Parterre. 

Lot the other papers, consisting of the By-Laws 
 of the Berkshire Society, Mr. Gold's Addresses in 
 1817, and ISIS, projiosals of premiums, &c., remain 
 in your office for the perusal of those who are inte- 
 rested in the establishment of such a Society here. 

Is it not possible to raise twice the quantity of pro- 
 duce annually in Chester county, to what is now 
 raised, and will not an Agricultural Society tend to 
 effect this object ? Who that compares our present 
 products with what they were twenty years ago, and 
 recollects that they are still one hundred per cent, 
 less than what is produced in many parts of Great 
 Britain, will despair of improvement ? " The man 
 who causes two blades of grass to grow where there 
 was but one before, renders more service to mankind 
 than all the statesmen and warriors that arise in a 
 century." Civis. 

" I avail myself of the first leisure to comply with 
 your request, viz : to forward a copy of the Constitu- 
 tion of the Berkshire Association, with such informa- 
 tion as I may deem useful. I now enclose you a copy 
 of our by-laws, which [is^the foundation of our pro- 
 ceedings. The Society was incorported in 1811. The 
 act contains only a general grant of all powers requi- 
 site to estaljlish and carry on the Society. The by- 
 laws contain the rules by which the powers granted 
 are to bo executed. These laws are subject to annu- 
 al improvement, as experience and circumstances may 
 require — accordingly we have made some small amend- 
 ments." 

_ "Your Society, no doubt, will conform its regula- 
 tions to its circumstances. It mil be well, however, 
 to avoid multiplicity of regulations, and to render 
 them plain, explicit, and easy of execution. 

"It will always be important to success, that you 
 appoint men of good standing, of considerable means, 
 of competent learning, much given to enquiry, read- 
 ing and experiments. This will bo all important at 
 the out set — and they should bo ready and alert in 
 the discharge of every duty. Much must bo written 

and dispersed among the members. There must be 
 used, means of extensive excitement. The business 
 must be impressed, as primary the foundation of all 
 other pursuits, agriculturists must be taught to re- 
 spect themselves and their eraploj'inents. They are 
 the real*uobility of our rcpuljlican country. At your 
 meetings, and especially the anniversary, much must 
 be done to explain and enforce the olijects of the 
 society — to prescribe the means and the measures, 
 and to convince them of the utility of the results — 
 in fact it should be a great occasion of excitement — 
 we occupy two days industriously. 

"Tlie most important means of prosperity in these 
 associations are adequate funds. In the early stages 
 of our society, we relied on subscriptions and private 
 contributions-^these were precarious. Three years 
 ago our legislature voted us $200 a year for three 
 years ; and a few months ago, they adopted a perma- 
 nent system for the encouragement and support of 
 such societies, by which each society may receive 
 1600 yearly : provided the society or others, will 
 place out on a permanent footing, a sum that will 
 also produce $000 a year, or any less sum. The plan 
 was for the state to furnish a moiety of the funds, 
 and the society the other moiety. We have executed 
 the act by obtaining good notes of say §51' each, 
 from respimsiblo men, bearing an interest of six per 
 cent, payable yearly, which constitutes our perma- 
 nent fund ; and so much as this produces, the state 
 allows an equal sum. This arrangement has placed 
 us on a foundation that will enable us to adopt 
 some additional measures, promotive of our useful- 
 ness. 

"This society, as you remark, has attained too 
 much distinction in our country. It was the first so- 
 ciety in the world, which adopted a practical course 
 for exciting and bringing into action the physical 
 means and energies of the country and population. 
 The plan was original, novel ; and at first was doubt- 
 ed. Time has removed all doubt, and the good sense 
 of our country has sanctioned the great experiment. 
 The success and extensive usefulness of this Institu- 
 tion is acknowledged througliout our country, and 
 we have many who regard us with cordial good will. 
 The Massachusetts society, though general and of 
 long standing, never were able to extend themselves 
 beyond theories ; they therefore honored us with the 
 appellation of " Parent Society." During the period 
 I was at the head of the society, we furnished plans 
 and instructions for numerous associations not only 
 in iS^ew England, but New York, Connecticut, North 
 and South Carolina and Virginia. We presume, 
 however, that the good sense of these sections of 
 country have made many, and valuable improve- 
 ments ; the only merit we have is that our plan is 
 practical and has succeeded beyond human expecta- 
 tion. Wo infer from these incidents that it is wisely 
 suited to the present condition of the communivy ; 
 the events that time oontinu.ally gives birth to, con- 
 firm our impression of the utility, and the necessity 
 of the associations. The peculiar situation of the 
 civilized world, teaches us that we must rely on our- 
 selves ; our resources are equal to every purpose. If 
 our government will do their duty effectually we shall 
 not long remain emliarrassed. The efforts made to 
 influence Congress are great ; they deserve all possi- 
 ble success ; they must succeed in a considerable 
 degree." 

An evidence of the progress of Agriculture, as a 
 profession, is the fact that in almost everj- county in 
 this State there is an Agricultural Society.
