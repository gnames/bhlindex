Farmers' Clubs. 

Mr. Editor : — Supposing the idea of establishing 
 Farmers' Clubs in the townships to be approved, 
 some difficulty may occasionally bo felt, at the outset, 
 from inexperience in organizing associations. It may 
 be said, "Yes; this might do, if we only had a fair 
 start; but how are we to begin?" Allow me, if no 
 better plan bo devised, to suggest the following, viz : 
 There being two or three farmers together, and talking 
 over this matter, let them agree to meet on the next 
 Saturday, at 2 o'clock, at some appointed place, and 
 each, in the mean time, invite as many of his 
 neighboring farmers as he may see to join them at 
 the meeting, ia order to form a club. Such a meet> 
 ing, at the time and place, being assembled, some one 
 may be chosen as chairman who shall call the meetr 
 ing to order; then a secretary, and next a committee 
 may be appointed, the latter to report rules for form- 
 ing and regulating a farmers' club. 

To assist in that operation, I would further suggest 
 the following form, that is to say: 

ARTICLES OP THE FARMERS CLUB OF ■ 

■ TOWNSHIP. 

1. The Xame of this association, shall be, "The 

Farmers' Club of ," and its object, the mutual 

improvement i,f its members in the business of Agri- 
 culture. 

2. The officers shall be a President, Secretary, and 
 Treasurer. 

The President shall preside at the meetings of the 
 Club, regulate discussions and debates, put the ques- 
 tions to vote, and announce the decisions. 

The Secretary shall keep memorandums of the 
 proceedings, file and keep all papers intended to be 
 preserved, and take care of all books and other things 
 belonging to the club. 

The Treasurer shall receive the contributions of 
 the members, pay out, on the order of the President, 
 and keep an account of the receipts and disburse- 
 ments for the inspection of the club. 

The same person may be elected Secretary and 
 Treasurer. 

There shaU be an annual election of the officers. 

3. As soon as these articles are adopted, the Club 
 shall proceed to elect by a majority of votes, a Presi- 
 dent, Secretary, and Treasurer, to serve one year and 
 until their successors are chosen. 

4. These officers shall prepare and report at the 
 next meeting Bj--Laws, which when approved by the 
 Club, shall govern the same until altered or repealed. 

5. The By-Laws shall prescribe the time and place 
 of meeting, the terms of admission of new members, 
 the time and mode of electing the officers, rogidations 
 for conducting the proceedings of the club, and other 
 matters conducive to its prosperity. 

They may bo amended or changed on such condi- 
 tions, as the Club may determine. 

With respect to the advantages of such associations, 
 1 wiU add, that they would diffuse a knowledge of 
 the best and most successful modes of farming, re- 
 form slovenly and wasteful practice, and increase the 
 profits of agricultural industr}-. "We imitate what 
 we see others do in our line, if wo fiml that it is bet- 
 ter and more profitable, than we have been accus- 
 tomed to do ourselves ; for all men seek their own 
 advantage, by the law which obliges all to pursue 
 their happiness. It is want of true knowledge alone, 
 that causes so much error in this pursuit. But no 
 means of knowledge are more positive and sure, than 
 an interchange uf useful ideas, and the communica- 
 tion of authentic facts in the actual business of life. 
 This advantage would necessarily result from the 
 meetings of the club. The best farmer in the neigh- 
 borhood would be a pattern for aU the rest, who 
 would gradually and speedily rise towards his level. 
 For whatever variety of grain he uses, or improved 
 farming implements, manures, or methods of cultiva- 
 tion, his superior success would recommend to their 
 ready adoption. It would only be necessary, that 
 they should bo known and explained. Tliis is the 
 natural and rational effect of example: no theoreti- 
 cal argument is so influential. 

But the benefit would not be confined to- the mere 
 following of a good example. The' statemsnt of the 
 facts, would lead to conjectures, reasonings, discus- 
 sions, and the formation of judgments. A farmer 
 speaking of the work of an improved plow, or drill 
 machine, or any new method of planting, or applica- 
 tion of a manure to his soil, would naturally state 
 how, in his opinion, the effects were produced, tracing 
 them to their particular causes; others, upon the 
 same facts, might suppose the result could be differ- 
 ently accounted for, and in the comparison of ideas, 
 it would soon be discovered how much the progress 
 and improvement of agriculture depend upon the 
 activity of the intellect and mental training. As the 
 desire of knowledge is increased by its acquisition, 
 the meetings of the clubs would greatly promote both. 
 They would bring to the notice and consideration of 
 the members a large amount of useful practical facts, 
 and habituating them to reason upon those facts as 
 well as apply them to their business, would lead them 
 to make new applications and improvements, and thus 
 assist in the progress and onward march of agricul- 
 ture. 

Nor is it to be supposed, that when a club should 
 become possessed of all the positive knowledge of the 
 township in regard to the business of farming, it 
 would remain satisfied with that advantage. Nothing 
 would be more natural, than the disposition to look 
 further, and inquire after the improvements of neigh- 
 boring to-n-usbips; and as opportunities are, every 
 year, in our free and active communities, afforded to 
 all persons, of frequently meeting their fellow citizens 
 of different sections of the county, such inquiries 
 would be extended to all its borders. The love of
