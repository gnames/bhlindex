knowledge "growing by what it feeds on," would 
 thus impel our clubs to a species of self-education by 
 inducing the members to observe, inquire, and think; 
 and the inestimable aid of agricultural journals and 
 treatises, would be eagerly sought and employed. 

They would begin to sec how much they had lost 
 by neglecting hitherto the means of improvement now 
 laid before them in the pages of those works ; and 
 their regret would not be fruitless. The long winter 
 evenings at home, would be most profitably spent in 
 examining and studying their contents; and the con- 
 clusion would be readily attained, that it is now their 
 duty to do that for their sons, which they cannot but 
 Tvish had been done for themselves. Reflecting how 
 much they might be now advanced, by having been 
 well educated at their start in life, they will clearly 
 perceive that it would bo better to give those who are 
 to succeed them, a good education even with some- 
 thing less of property, to begin with, than leave them 
 to struggle with the world, purblind and destitute of 
 the labor-saving helps of science. 

One of the most cheering results of the proposed 
 clubs, would therefore be, to make our agriculturists 
 efficient patrons of liberal education. The time is 
 coming when the highest course of instruction will 
 not be considered as useful and proper, exclusively, 
 to what has hitherto been termed the learned profes- 
 sions, but will 1)0 as manifestly advantageous to other 
 callings, and especially to the honorable vocation of 
 a cultivator of the soil. Our young men will then, 
 upon the completion of their academical or collegiate 
 course, return to their homes with the intention of 
 engaging in whatever pursuit may appear to afford 
 them the best prospect of success in life, conscious 
 that they have qualified themselves to reach its lofti- 
 est attainments, and that real honor consists not so 
 much in the fact of a man's being of this or that pro- 
 fession, as in the superior excellence which he can 
 achieve in the business or calling he may have 
 adopted. 

But what avocation can be more intrinsically hon- 
 orable, than tliat which is concerned in subduing the 
 oartli to the uses of men, in reclaiming the wilder- 
 ness, and substituting the life-sustaining harvests and 
 golden fruits of fields and orchards for our primeval 
 forests and wide extended prairies, and in renovating 
 the worn out soils of our earlier settlements? When 
 the pen of history shall be guided by the hand of truth, 
 more real glory will be ascribed to this country for her 
 generous sympathy in supplying abundantly, as she 
 did in 1847 from the exuberant pi-oducts of her agri- 
 culture, food to the famishing millions of Europe, 
 than for all the splendid triumphs of her arms on the 
 plains of Mexico and the acquisition of the " golden 
 sands" of California. The time is at hand, when the 
 opinion of the English sage will no longer be deemed 
 extravagant, " That whoever could make two oars of 
 corn or two blades of grass grow upon a spot of 
 ground, where only one grew before, would deserve 

better of mankind and do more essential service to 
 his country, than the whole race of politicians put 
 together." A. L. H.

On the Cucumber Bug; 

in a letter addressed to the Editor, by J. S. Keller, of 
 OriDigshurg, Pa. 
 Enclosed I send you two bugs, a male and female, 
 with provision to keep them alive till they arrive in 
 your office. This insect is of vast injury to the farm- 
 ers, especially to those who are engaged in raising 
 watermelons and cucumbers. It attacks the tender 
 plants as soon as they are out of the ground, and 
 continues on for several weeks. When approached 
 in a warm day, it flies away, if not taken and killed 
 immediately. In cool weather it drops off when the 
 plant is touched, and remains motionless for a short 
 time, or hides among the little clods. I had almost 
 all my watermelons and early cucumbers eaten by 
 this hungry insect. I tried lime dust, ashes, black 
 pepper, plaster, flour of sulphur, and chicken dung, 
 (the latter having heretofore been considered a good 
 remedy,) and all availed nothing. I killed thousands 
 with my hand, and that is the only remedy I found 
 to stop their ravages. Where this bug deposits its 
 eggs I am not able to say. 

Any person discovering a remedy either to destroy 
 or prevent this insect from eating the plants, ia de- 
 serving of a premium of no ordinary nature, and Mr. 
 Ilarlachef, (vegetable farmer at Hamburg, Berks co.) 
 offers a promium of fifty dollars to any person dis- 
 covering an effective remedy against them. 

The Schuylkill County Agricultural Society will 
 meet on the 28th of June to organise finally, and 
 adopt By-Laws.

The way to be uappy. — Some think it a hardship 
 to work for their bread, although for our good it was 
 meant ; but those who don't work have no right to be 
 fed, and the idle are never content. An honest em- 
 ployment brings pleasure and gain, and makes us our 
 troubles forget ; for those who work hard have no time 
 to complain, and 'tis better to labor than fret. And 
 if we had riches, they could not procure, a happy 
 and peaceful mind; rich people have trouble as wcU 
 as the poor, although of a different kind. It signi- 
 fies not what our stations Iiave been, nor whether 
 we're little or great; for happiness lies in the temper 
 within, and not in the outward estate. AVe only need 
 labor as well as we can for all that our bodies may 
 need, still doing our duty to God and to man, and we 
 shall be happy indeed. — Selected. 

True. — A Western writer thinks that if the proper 
 way to spell tho is " though," ate " eight," and bo 
 " beau," tho proper way to spell " potatoes" \npough-
