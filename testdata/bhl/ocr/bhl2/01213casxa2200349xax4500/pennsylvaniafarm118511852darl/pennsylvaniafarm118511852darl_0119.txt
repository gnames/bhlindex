Mr. Russel's Prqject of an Agricultural College. 

Mr. Editor : I haye reail with pleasure the articles 
 ill tiiO Journal, upon the subject of Agricultural 
 Schools and Education, written by Dr. Elwyn, Mr. 
 Gowcn, and Mr. Garber. 

The able report of the Superintendent of Conimou 
 Schools, has awakened an interest to the subject 
 throughout the Commonwealth, which though it may 
 have been felt by individuals, did not before reach 
 the public eye, the public ear, the public heart. 

I have not failed myself, on every suitable occasion, 
 to express the deep obligations of the Agricultural 
 community to Mr. Russcl, for the noble and disinte- 
 rested service he has rendered them. His project ev- 
 idences talent, extensive research, and close thought 
 — it does credit to his head and his heart. It furnish- 
 es to all disposed to invito or declaim upon the 
 subject a text, that will b^ used until Pennsylva- 
 nia shall boast of its University, and by the ex- 
 tent of that University, to excel " Ireland with 
 her sixty-three, Russia with her sixty-eight, or 
 France with her seventy-five Agricultural Schools." 

It is but a few years since legislation was first had 
 upon the subject of Common Schools in Pennsylva- 
 nia. The system entailed taxation — taxation in town 
 and township — it met with opposition — its principles 
 were discussed — the public mind was enlightened — 
 opposition ceased, and we now exceed in provision 
 for common school instruction, every country iu Eu- 
 rope, except it be Prussia. So I trust that it will 
 be with our agricultural schools — that a general sys- 
 tem will be established, and that it will be the pride 
 of every farmer to have his sons taught the " princi- 
 ples of agriculture, its thoorj- and its practice" — and 
 that it shall not be said of the next generation, that 
 the business of farming is left to those who "only talk 
 of oxen." 

Much complaint is made of the incompetency of 
 teachers, and I find friend Garber is loud in his de- 
 nunciations of those, " who teach school at the ex- 
 pense of the tax payers, merely to qualify themselves 
 for higher branches, careless of their charge, and the 
 consequence is the children go to school j'ear after 
 year, and are none the wiser in the end." There must 
 necessarily be difficulties in all great reforms, and 
 certainly the system of public school instruction, is 
 such. There is a wide demand for teachers, not only 
 in our own, but several of the neighboring States, 
 and the evil of incompetent teachers is being rapidly 
 corrected. I have been a director myself, with the 
 exception of a short period, for the last twelve years, 
 and I am proud of the great improvement in disci- 
 pline, in the deportment of the children, and in the 
 enlargement of the branches taught. In schools, 
 where but a few years ago, the very first rudiments — 
 the ABC were taught, I had the gratification on my 
 last visit, of hearing large classes declaim with credit 

to themselves and to their teachers — and other classes 
 reciting from the last pages of their works on phi- 
 losophy and surveying. I am thankful for what has 
 been done, and not disposed to repine over what has 
 not yet been accomplished. But I am digressing. 

I propose to each member of the State Society, that 
 — e carry out the spirit of the resolution unanimously 
 adopted by iho convention recommending agricultu- 
 ral education, by taking w'il.'i us to the State exhibi- 
 tion in October, a, short memorial to the Legislature, 
 prepared for signature, and then have our friends sign, 
 asking for a college to be endowed by the State, as 
 recommended by Mr. Russel. Such an array of 
 names, and such an influence will not be disregarded 
 by the Legislature. 

I propose further to each member of the County 
 Societies throughout the commonwealth, that we call 
 meetings — discuss the subject of agricultural educa- 
 tion, and in a body memorialize, each our own repre- 
 sentatives and senators, to exert their influence in fa- 
 vor of an agricultural college. 

The college, must precede common school educa- 
 tion. Teachers will there be prepared for imparting 
 knowledge in this branch of science in common 
 schools, as they are now prepared in high schools 
 and colleges and sent forth by the hundred to give 
 instruction in the ordinary studies of English and 
 classical education. 

The Legislature promptly and liberally responded 
 to the call for aid by the State Society, made at a 
 late day of the session. For the promptness with 
 which our memorial was answered we are much in- 
 debted to the worthy and active chairman of the com- 
 mittee on agriculture, Mr. Ilaldcman, and I take 
 pleasure iu acknowledging thus publicly our indebt- 
 edness. With equal promptness the Legislature re- 
 sponded to the call of the State Society for the publi- 
 cation of Prof. Rogers' geological survey. 

The agriculturists compose two-thirds of the popu- 
 lation of our State. By concert of action through our 
 State and county societies we can bring such an ar- 
 ray of influence as will be irresistible. Much has 
 been done, and very properly and profitably for the 
 endowment of colleges for the benefit of the learned 
 professions — let there now be a very liberal appro- 
 priation toward carrying out Mr. Russel's project of 
 an agricultural college. Let us ask for something 
 definite, and if in the wisdom of the members of the 
 legislature, they can devise a measure better suited 
 to the wants of the farmer, to them be the praise.

Estherton, June, 1851. 

The wash of the drain from a farm house when 
 well mixed with loam, is excellent manure. Loam 
 will soon neutralise all the foul effluvia arising from 
 the putrid waters.
