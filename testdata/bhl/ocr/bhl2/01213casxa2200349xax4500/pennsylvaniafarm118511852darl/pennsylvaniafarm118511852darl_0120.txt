Sketch of the history of Cicada septendecim, 

BY D. W. HARTMAN, M. D., OF WEST CIIESTEB, PA. 

[Read before the CliesUr Co. SortkuUural Society.] 

The usual period having arrived for the visitation 
 of the Cicada septendecim, commonly called the sev- 
 enteen year locust, I deem a few remarks relative to 
 their economy appropriate on the preseut occasion. 

The common name of locust was given to this in- 
 Eect from the circumstance of their appearing in large 
 Bwarms periodically, like the locusts of eastern coun- 
 tries. This name, however, is an error. The locust 
 of eastern countries being what we term here a grass- 
 hopper. That the locusts spoken of in scripture, 
 (which to this day are the curse of eastern countries,) 
 were not like the insect under consideration, is read- 
 ily proven from the account given of them. They 
 are represented as " devouring every green thing," 
 and to be able to accomplish this they must be pro- 
 vided with jaws as the true locusts or grasshoppers 
 are, while our insect possesses a hausiellum or sucker, 
 and takes its nourishment principally while in the 
 larva state under ground. The vulgar name of har- 
 vest fly is more appropriate to this insect from the 
 fact that most of the species in the United States be- 
 longing to the genus Cicada appear about the time 
 of harvest. The Locusta proper, or grasshopper, be- 
 longs to a diiferent order, and has quite a diiferent 
 sti'ucture. We have several other indigenous spe- 
 cies, only two of whieb, however, are common to this 
 vicinity, C. canicularis, and C. pruinosa, both of 
 which appear later in the season than the septende- 
 cim. 

The insects of the order Hcmiptera (to which Cica- 
 da belongs) live by suction only, and for this end 
 they are provided with a haustellum or sucker tlii-o' 
 which they imbibe the juices of animals and plants. 
 The bed-bug, squash-bug, plant lice or Aphides and 
 the Coccides or bark lice are ftimiliar examples of 
 this order. 

The ti'ivial name septendecim appropriately refers 
 to the periods of their visit, which is once every sev- 
 enteen years, and although this is the regular period 
 for tlieir return, circumstances may retard or accele- 
 rate their progress to maturity. I noticed the song 
 of one or two individuals last year, that from some 
 cause or other anticipated the usual time, and others 
 have occasionally observed a few individuals the year 
 following the regular period. 

Though they appear but once in seventeen years 
 within certain circumscribed limits, yet from the pub- 
 lished accounts of those who have written on the 
 subject, tliey are found witliin some parts of the 
 United States every year, observing, however, (with 
 the exceptions before mentioned) their regular law 
 of periodicity. In some districts of country neigh- 
 boring swarms overlap, and in such places they ap- 
 pear once every eight or nine years respectively. — 

At the present time if you dig a few inches beneath 
 the surface of the soil, particularly beneath large 
 trees, you will come upon their chambers, which are 
 from six to twelve inches long, and five-eighths of an 
 inch in diameter. Tlie sides and tops of these cham- 
 bers are covered with a varnish by the insect, which 
 renders it water proof. During warm, pleasant 
 weather they ascend to the top of the chamber, but 
 retire to the bottom on the least appearance of cold 
 or rain, and as the period for their final transforma- 
 tion arrives, they ascend nearer the sui-face, where 
 they can enjoy the benefit of light and air. 

The time having arrived in which they are to as- 
 sume the winged state, they leave the ground, and 
 crawling up the trunks of trees and other objects 
 which may happen in their way, they cast ofT the 
 shell enclosing the chrysalis, which is often left stick- 
 ing by the claws to the place where the change oc- 
 curred. The process of casting the skin of the chry- 
 salis is usually accomplished towards day or early in 
 the morning. Their bodies and wiugs after this are 
 for a time moist and soft. If performed late in the 
 day, the wings would become dry before they could 
 have time to expand, and thus render them unfit for 
 flight. The same circumstances influence the period 
 of metamorphosis of many other insects, particularly 
 those kinds possessing wings of a delicate texture, as 
 Neuroptera (dragon-flies), Diptera (flies) and Lcpi- 
 doptera (butterflies). The usual time of their ap- 
 pearance when in the winged state is about the 20th 
 of May, bnt it depends in a great measure upon the 
 season, being a few days earlier if the spring is for- 
 ward and tlie weather warm, and later if cold and 
 wet. In the south they appear as early as February 
 and March, while in the eastern States they do not 
 appear until June. North of forty-four degrees lati- 
 tude the Cicada septendecim have not been found. 

In about two weeks from the time they first make 
 their appearance, they will all have assumed the 
 winged state; and from this time until the latter end 
 of June or begining of July they are engaged iu pro- 
 viding for a continuance of their species. 

Should any of our horticultural friends possess any 
 favorite tiees or shrubs, this will be the period to see 
 that they are protected from the attacks of the female 
 Cicada, who, in her instinctive desire to continue her 
 species, deposits her eggs alike on all trees or shrubs, 
 except pines or other trees containing turpentine. — 
 For small trees and shrubs a covering of millinet is 
 recommended ; would not a coating of thick white- 
 wash, applied with a small brush, to the upper sur- 
 face of the smaller limljs and shoots answer equally 
 as well, or what perhaps would prove more offensive 
 to the insect, a coating of coal tar or whale oil soap ? 
 The smaller limbs and young shoots are preferred by 
 the parent insect, as some suppose, on account of her 
 grasping these more readily by her legs, which ena- 
 bles her to make great pressure upon the point of
