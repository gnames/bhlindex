THE HORSE. 

AN ESSAY ON THE EXTERNAL FORMATION Oil 

STRUCTURE OF THE HORSE, AND ON THE 

DISORDERS ORIGINATING THEREIN. 

[Continued from page 78.] 

Of all points of a horse, the shoulder, for a hack- 
 ney, or a hunter, is of the utmost consequence ; ■n-ith- 
 out a good shoulder, no horse can ride well ; ho may 
 be a good harness horse, or he may race well ; but it 
 is physically impossible for him to carry his rider 
 ■with ease and pleasure on the road. These arc no 
 speculative opinions, but facts, grounded on the ex- 
 perience of all men who know a horse when they see 
 one, and the result of our own overy-day observations 
 — so much does the action of the fore extremities de- 
 pend on the structure of this part. And now, what 
 is it that constitutes a good shoulder, and how are wo 
 to know a good from a bad one? In order to render 
 our answers to these questions intelligible, it will be 
 necessary for us to deviate a little, and say something 
 on the internal mechanism of the part. The scapulro, 
 or shoulder blades, are attached to the ribs by many 
 powerful muscles, which move them, during the ac- 
 tion of the animal, round their own axis, or, at least, 
 in a very similar way ; and though they can only re- 
 volve through the small segment of a circle, that seg- 
 ment is greater in proportion as they are more ob- 
 liquely jilaccd against the sides of the chest; hence it 
 will be seen, that what is called an oblique shoulder 
 is most advantageous. for motion. Again, the best 
 shouldered horses have, generally, thin withers; but 
 this is not indispensably necessary to the formation 
 of a good shoulder, for we know some, and good 
 judges, who are of a contrary opinion. We must 
 confess, however, for our own part, that we prefer 
 fine withers. The thickness of the withers will de- 
 pend on the conformation of the chest and obliquity 
 of the scapulaj, and not so much as some persons, 
 high in veterinary repute, have supposed, on the 
 length of the dorsal spines.* Now, if, in viewing the 
 fore parts of a horse, we find he rises upon the with- 
 ers, (and we must take <'are that this be no illusion, 
 produced by placing his fore legs upon rising ground,) 
 and that no traces of his blade-bone can be scon un- 
 der the skin, but all appears smooth and level, we 
 may conclude that the shoulder is oblique; though a 

■* Bones of the withers. It is contended, on an- 
 other side, that the situation of the scapuL-E has no- 
 thing to do with the thickness of the shoulder, but 
 that it is wholly owing to the length of the spinous 
 processes of the dorsal vertebroe. To establish this 
 opinion must be proved two data, viz: 1st, that these 
 spines are short, or comparatively so, in all thick- 
 shouldered horses, and long in thin-shouldered ones ; 
 and, 2dly, that the converse of this never happens. — 
 To one who has dissected shoulders, these are cer- 
 tainly home-thrusts; such, at least, as we could not 
 parry; though we know that these bones may and do, 
 like those of most others, vary in difi'erent horses. — 
 But they also vary in their degrees of inclination ; 
 and may not this circumstance alone, in some mea- 
 sure, efl'ect the construction of it? At all events, we 
 know these facts, dray or cart horses have wide chests 
 and thick shoulders; others with wide chests have 
 thick shoulders, but with narrow chests thin, unless 
 the scapuloe be upright. Now, if they who diifer with 
 us, mean to assert that all this arises solely from the 
 length of the dorsal spines, we can only say, credat 
 jtcdmus appella. 

more direct proof is furnished us by carrying the eye 
 from the summit of the withers to the extremity of 
 the point of the shoulders. If it is upright, or nearly 
 so, unloss.it be in a thorough-bred horse, (such a 
 shoulder is only fit for the collar,) we shall perceive 
 an irregularity under the skin, just below the with- 
 ers, by passing our hand over the part, and find, on 
 grasping the part, that if is thick and clumsy, be- 
 cause we are actually at the time grasping the blade- 
 bone as well as wither-bone; though (as before ob- 
 served) these may be thick from the construction of 
 the chest. 

A lean shoulder is one having thin withers, cover- 
 ed with fine and genuine muscle; a loaded, or over- 
 loaded, one with thick withers, clothed with coarse 
 and flabby muscles ; and the thickness of the wither, 
 as we said before, depends on the obliquity of the 
 shoulder-blades, and the proximity of their superior 
 borders to the dorsal spines. That horses have been 
 fast runners on the turf with bad shoulders, is no 
 proof that they would not have galloped bettor and 
 quicker with good ones; and we must recollect that 
 in a racer the hind quarters are of primary import- 
 ance, the fore quarters only of secondary considera- 
 tion ; but, on the road, we know that bad-shouldered 
 horses are never pleasant nor safe hackneys; they 
 step short, are puddling walkers, roll about in their 
 trot, and are exceedingly likely to go to prayers. 

The fore-leg should descend in a straight line from 
 the bottom of their shoulder, i. e. in a lateral view; 
 but when seen in front, it ought to incline gently in- 
 ward. If the elbow projects gently backward, and 
 the toe points with precision forw.ard, we may rest 
 satisfied that the horse is not twisted in his fore legs. 
 Turning the toe in or out in standing is apt to be 
 accompanied with distortion, or deformity of the limb. 
 This circumstance, therefore, is seldom seen without 
 materially lessening the value of an animal. Of the 
 two faults, turning them out is the greater, for the 
 pointing inward is seldom carried to the extreme. — - 
 A good arm is broad and thick, long, when compared 
 to the leg, and marked exteriorly by muscular pro- 
 minences. The elbow cannot project too far back, 
 and the plumper the muscle is immediately above it, 
 the greater we may conclude to be the animal's pow- 
 ers. 

The knees ought to be large, broad in front, and 
 distinctly marked with several bony knobs; lateral 
 thickness is, also, of much importance. When the 
 radius, (the bone of the arm,) instead of descending 
 in a straight line, is directed backward, so that the 
 knee appears to recede from it, the horse is said to 
 be calf-kneed, a term that well conveys the idea we 
 have of this formation: it is always olijectionable for 
 the saddle, but not for the collar. The leg should fall 
 in exactly perpendicular from the carcass, and be 
 short when compared with the arm, the converse of 
 this being indicative of weakness; and of sufiicicnt 
 breadth to enable a purchaser, even at a distance, to 
 distinguish the tendons and bone, with perfect clear- 
 ness, in their relative situations ; for, if he cannot do 
 this, there is reason for suspecting that he is gummy, 
 the effect of hard work or premature use, and never 
 a natural defect. Should the legs bo round and 
 straight below, they are called stilty, and are never 
 firm and good. But the best and only correct way 
 to judge of legs, is to pass the hand down them; if 
 they measure much round, and the sinews feel firm, 
 hard, and distinct, like well-braced cords, and if the 
 intervening spaces between bone and sinew be clean 
 — free from gum — we may pronounce that they are 
 good. 
 The fetlock, aa a joint, should be of largo dimen-
