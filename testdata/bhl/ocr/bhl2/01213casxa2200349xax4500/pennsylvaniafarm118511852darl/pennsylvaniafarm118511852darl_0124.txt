The breeding of cattle has been, from time almost 
 immemorial, the principal ohjeet of pursuit Tvith the 
 GalloTvay farmer. The soil and face of tlio country 
 are admirably adapted for this. The soil, altliough 
 rich is dry and healthy. There are many large tracts 
 of old grass land, that have not been plowed during 
 any one's recollection, and which still maintain their 
 .superior fertility; ■vvliilethe finer pastures ai'e tliickly 
 covered with natural white clover, and other valuable 
 grasses. The surface of the ground is irregular, 
 sometimes rising into small globular hills, and at 
 other times into abrupt banks, and thus forming 
 small fertile glens, and producing shelter for the cat- 
 tle in tl'.e winter and early vegetation in the spring. 
 In the low districts there is little frost and snow, but 

the climate is mild and rather moist; and thus a lan- 
 guid vegetation is supported during the winter, and 
 pastures constantly retain their verdure. 

The young cattle are chiefly bred and reared to a 
 certain age upon the higher districts, or upon the in- 
 ferior lands in the lower grounds. A few oowa are 
 kept in the richer soils to produce milk, butter, and 
 cheese for the families; but it is found the more pro- 
 fitable to breed and rear the cattle upon the inferior 
 lands, and afterwards to feed them upon the finer 
 ground and the rich old pastures. There would be 
 no objection to this if the Galloway farmers would 
 afford their young stock a little shelter from the driv- 
 ing blasts of winter. 

The regular Galloway lireeders rarely sell any of 
 their calves for veal ; which is obtained only from 
 those who keep cows for supplying the villagers with 
 milk, and from the few dairy forms where cows are 
 kept for making cheese. — Youatt d- Martin on Cattle. 

GAILOWAV OX IN GOOD CONDITION. 

Larv.b of the locust and fruit tubes. — A gentle- 
 man who had several fruit trees in a declining condi- 
 tion at the time of Miss Morris' announcement of the 
 discovery of the fact that the larvae of the locust at- 
 tach themselves permanently to the roots of trees, 
 informs us, that ho waited upon that lady, believing 
 the sickly condition of his trees to proceed from these 
 insects. A conversation with Miss M. satisfied him 
 of the correctness of his impression. Instead of dig- 
 ging around the roots and detaching the larvEe, he, in 
 in the fall of the year, bored a half inch auger hole 
 in the body of each tree to a depth of two or three 
 inches, which he filled with the flour of sulphur and 
 plugged shut. The highly flourishing condition of 
 his trees the following spring, convinced him that he 
 had effectually removed the cause of their former un- 
 heal thincss. 

A GOOD master is kind to his beast. 

Fleas. — A correspondent who has been sorely an- 
 noyed by these pests, informs us that he has succeed- 
 ed in ridding his house of their presence and himself 
 and family of their bites, by spreading the floors 
 morning and evening, for a few days with a decoction 
 of sassafras. The remedy is simple and easily tried. 

Glazed Pots are the most suitable for plants kept 
 in balconies, where they are much exposed to the air, 
 as they do not admit of transpiration from the side», 
 and consequently the earth contained in them doe» 
 not so soon become drv. 

Tue entire imports for Canada for 1849 was £3,002,- 
 599, in 1850 £4,245,517 ; about one-third of the whole 
 import was from tlie United States. The trade of 
 Canada with this country is yearly increasing, and 
 becoming of importance and consequence.
