find no difficulty in pushing through butweou the 
 wires, although cattle may bo held. This was the 
 case with my first fence made of No. 10 wire, posts 
 16 feet apart, at a cost of about 60 cents a pannel 
 (16 feet.) The best fence I have put up is along a 
 public road infested by village cattle and hogs which 
 are generally considered a pretty fair test, and I find 
 it proof against any kind of farm stock whatever. — 
 The fence has been in use for more than a year and 
 is now as perfect as over. My mode of construction is 
 either to start from a good tree, or sink a very heavy 
 post, well framed and braced, into a good sill 20 or 
 30 inches below the surface of the ground and secured 
 so as to hold firmly against the strain of the wires 
 without settling up. This is all important, as the 
 strength of the fence depends greatly upon the ends. 
 The posts are then planted 20 or 30 feet apart and 
 the wires drawn along through half inch holes pre- 
 viously bored in the posts. I also string on every five 
 feet a pine lath or picket' for the purpose of stiffening 
 the fence and preventing the wires being forced apart. 
 After getting one or two wires through the whole 
 length, I apply a sma I frame containing a crank and 
 a pair of cog wheels to the end of the wire and strain 
 it up to sufiicient tension, say 6 to 800 lbs. to each. — ■ 
 While in this position we drive a pin or plug into the 
 holes at every post. This in a measure prevents a 
 recoil while securing the ends which is simply to coil 
 it once around the post and wrap it several times 
 very tightly around the main wire. This is the course 
 pursued with every wire and the fence is completed. 

One difficulty will generally bo found in making 
 joints of the several strands in a long line of a fence, 
 if not very well made, they cannot bear the tension. — 
 la fact, in all cases I find them the weak place of the 
 fence, as I never yet could break a wire at any other 
 place. The best joints I can make is to heat the ends 
 red hot in a portable furnace so as to thoroughly an- 
 neal them, lay the ends together, parallel, and lap- 
 ping 8 or 10 inches ; screw on a couple of light hand 
 vices with their jaws facing each other about 3 inches 
 apart. The space between them is then turned into 
 a close twist. Eemove one vice and with a pair of 
 stout pliers wrap the end very close and tightly 
 around the main strand, the other vice is then re- 
 moved and set further back {on tTie Joint) and the 
 other end served in the same manner coiling it in the 
 opposite direction and of course around the other 
 main wire. If the ends are not drawn around very 
 closely they will slip or draw together, which at once 
 breaks the joint, as one wire invariably twists off the 
 other if they slip or give in the least ; so that it is 
 very important that the wires lock at once in fitting 
 them together, and this cannot possibly be done with- 
 out being thoroughly annealed. 

A fence well put up in this manner will defy stock of 
 any kind, and should cattle or horses accidentally run 
 against it, the elasticity of the wire is sufficient to 

throw them upon their haunches without the least in- 
 jury to the animal or fence. Upon this account, the 
 wire is better unannealed, as under a great force the 
 pores of the iron will give in a measure, and the wire 
 becomes slack, if softened. In fact, the bright wire 
 works better in many ways, and is far preferable to 
 put up. Number 8, I think as light as should be 
 used for a good fence. Bline cost about one dollar 
 and ten cents a panel of 20 feet, 4 feet high, or 9 
 strands, commencing 3 inches from the ground then 
 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, and 8 inches apart. 

The advantages in plugging up the holes in the 
 posts are, that it throws any unusual strain upon sev- 
 eral posts at the same time, and in case a joint be 
 broken the ends will not recoil for more than a few 
 pannels, and can easily be repaired. 

In giving the cost of this fence at §1,10 for 20 feet, 
 about the cost of good post and rail of 10 or 11 feet, 
 you will of course understand the posts used are cul- 
 lings and such as are too light to mortice, and con- 
 sequently of not half the value of good sized posts.

Leaving Lancaster for Baltimore about 12 o'clock, 
 we reached Columbia where a snow storm welcomed 
 us. Like ourselves it tarried but a little while, al- 
 though on reaching York county, we found it to be 
 two inches deep. Before we reached Baltimore, how- 
 ever, it had all disappeared. 

In looking at the fine yards and gardens in the 
 vicinity, we could not but be struck with the advixnce 
 vegetation had made, and how mnch more forward it 
 was than with us. We soon left for Washington, 
 and on our journey thither, were surprised to find 
 that little or no change had taken place in the agri- 
 cultural character of the country between the two 
 cities. Ten years ago, this was almost a barren 
 waste, supporting a very thin coat of mere grass. — 
 It is so still on the left side of the road, although, on 
 the right hand were fin; Wheat, Oats, Clover and 
 Timothy. We arrived at Washington in good season; 
 and as the dinner hour at the fashionable hotel at 
 which we stopped, approached the supper hour of 
 a Pennsylvania farmer, we found that we had since 
 time to spare, which we devoted to a visit to the 
 Patent Office. Free admission is given to all visitors. 
 We could not but think, that the manner in which 
 the thousands of beautiful models of invention were 
 packed in the large cases, was not very well calcu- 
 lated to give the visitor a proper idea of their char- 
 acter. This difficulty will be obviated so soon as the 
 new wings now being erected, are completed. The 
 National Gallery in the same building is well worth 
 a visit, and months might be pleasantly spent in au 
 examination, of the varied contents.
