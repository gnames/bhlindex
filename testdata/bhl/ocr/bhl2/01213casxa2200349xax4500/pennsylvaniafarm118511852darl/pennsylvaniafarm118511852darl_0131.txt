On Wednesday, May 7, we took passage on board 
 the fine steamer Mount Vernon, for Riclimond. AVe 
 steamed it rapidly down the broad Potomac, and 
 when some distance below "Washington, the view of 
 AVashington, Georgetown and the vicinity was beau- 
 tiful in the extreme. We arrived at Alexandria 
 where the steamer tarried but a few minutes, brief 
 33 was our stay, we could see that the glory of this 
 city had departed. The large empty warehouses 
 aud the few small vessels lying at the wharf, all gave 
 evidence of a meagre trade. 

A few miles below, the mansion of the Father of 
 his country, was pointed out to us. As the boat 
 neared it, the bell of the Steamer, as was the custom, 
 was tolled, the tilling being continued until we had 
 passed the sacred spot. Here the river widens, and 
 except a few lonely dwellings on the high banks and 
 the fishermens huts below, nothing of peculiar inter- 
 est presented itself. On arriving at the Rail Road 

Depot at we saw a few knolls that gave signs 

of vegetation. Some luxuriant looking half grown 
 peas and potatoes fiUed the garden, the soil of which 
 was almost entirely sand. 

We entered the cars, and proceeded through a peb- 
 bly country, skirted by abrupt hills on the one side 
 and swamps on the other. In many places the origi- 
 nal timber was still standing, but it was slim and 
 scrubby. The finest lands had been cleared, and as 
 is usual in Virginia, its fertility exhausted, and now 
 abandoned and growing up with pines, sassafras, 
 broom grass and blackberries. 

On reaching Fredericksburg, the rusty looking 
 brick mills and the woodwork without paint, satisfied 
 us that here too the spirit of progress had departed. 
 The farms in the vicinity are very large, generally 
 from 3 or 400 acres to a thousand, and most miser- 
 ably cultivated. There is little variation in the soil 
 between Fredericksburg and Richmond, and except 
 a few fine bottoms which are in a good state of culti- 
 vation. The soil is a sandy loam, without stones.— 
 A large portion of the land was ploughed for oats and 
 corn, although it had all been exhausted by the pre- 
 vious tobacco crops. 

A farm of a thousand acres has no more stabling 
 and storage for fodder, than a farm of 40 acres would 
 have here ; hay I have seen none, except from meadow 
 and that stacked where it grew. Cornfodder is 
 stacked in the same way. The ordinary houses are 
 generally Ijuilt of log, with wooden chimneys attached 
 to the outside. Lime there is none in this section 
 but what Is brought from a distance of 40 to 60 miles; 
 nature has supplied a strong red clay from 2 to 6 
 feet below the snrface, which answers for ordinary 
 plastering. At 5 J o'clock W3 rrrived in Broad street 
 in the city of Richmond, and in my next I wiU give 
 a fuU description of it and its vicinity.

 Friend Sp angler: — Agreeably to your request and 
 my promise, I send you the account of a Scaling 
 Ladder, verbatim et literatim, published in the Gen- 
 tlemen's Magazine, (London) for April, 1747. 

I remain yours, &c. AV. SJ

Fig. 1 and 2 represents a model of a sealing lad- 
 der, which may be useful on many occasions. Its 
 rounds or steps A B are fastened at a proper dis- 
 tance from each with the cords C. These rouads 
 are thicker at one end than at the other. The lig- 
 ger end is made hollow like a fosset, and the small 
 end is make to fit into it like a spiggot so th it by 
 putting the small ends into the large they form the 
 long pole D at the upper end of which is a great iron 
 hook or holdfast E. 

This pole being long enough to reach to the top of 
 the wall, or place which Is to be mounted, it is easy 
 to fasten it by its hook E and there is nothing more 
 to be done than to pull the lower end, that is the first 
 round and all the rest will be drawn out the one from 
 the other and your pole wiU be turned into a ladder. 

These ladders are very convenient .and are the 
 more proper for secret expeditious, as they are very 
 light, and may be put into a sack and removed from 
 place to place without giving any suspicion that you 
 carrying a ladder. It may be erected in the street or 
 put out of a window to assist people to escape .i,t fires; 
 and probably may be improved by master Ephraim 
 Hadon who advertises his skill in rope ladders.
