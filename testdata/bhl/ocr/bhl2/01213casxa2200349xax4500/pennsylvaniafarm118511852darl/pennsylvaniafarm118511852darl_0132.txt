OUK TERMS— READ THEM. 

In order that the Farm -Journal may be placed 
 ■within the reach of every one who feels interested in 
 the progress of Agriculture, we ask attention to the 
 following terms : — 
 Single Copies, - $1 00 Per Annum. 

Five " - - 4 00 " 

Ten " - 7 50 " 

Twenty " - - 15 00 " 

It is not required that all papers in a club should 
 be scut to one ofBce. We will mail tliem (in wrap- 
 pers,) to as many different offices as may be necessa- 
 ry. We make this arrangement in order that persons 
 residing in different neigliborhoods may unite, and 
 form large clubs, and thus secure the "Journal" at 
 the very lowest club rates. 

Specimen copies of the Journal will be sent on ap- 
 plication, Fost-pakl, to the publisher. 

Post Masters, are by law, authorised to remit sub- 
 .soription money to the publisher, free of posta(jc. — 
 Particular attention is asked to this fact, as it will 
 save expevise both to subscribers and publisher. 

Our Terms are cash in advance. The exceedingly 
 low rate at which tlie Journal is furnished renders 
 this imperative. Suljscriptions may be sent at our 
 risk, and money at par where subsscribers reside, will 
 be tak<'n. Where tlie sum to be sent is large we pre- 
 fer tliat a draft should be procured, if possible. 

Subscriliers and Post Masters are invited to act as 
 Agents. A receipt will always be sent with the first 
 number of the copy subscribed for. 

All letters must be addressed, jyoit paid, to the pub- 
 lisher. A. M. SPANGLER,

Correction. — In our last number our proof reader 
 was not as careful as he should have been. Several 
 errors crept in, amongst whicli were three or four in 
 the article on agricultural education, by Mr. Gowen, 
 which the reader will attribute to an oversight of the 
 proof reader. 

Tall Rve. — We were shown, a few days since, a 
 number of stalks of rye from the farm of Mr. Konig- 
 macher, near Ephrata, in Lancaster county, which 
 measured eight feci and six inches! 

Premiums I Premiums ! ! 

We observe by the Genesse Farmer, that our friend 
 Jacob Frantz, of Paradise township, has been award- 
 ed the sum of twenty dollars, as a premium for the 
 largest number of subscribers obtained liy an individ- 
 ual. The number procured liy ]\Ir. Frantz, was 414, 
 and it is due him to say, that this large list was pro- 
 cured before he was aware of the fact that the publi- 
 cation of the Farm Journal was contemplated. We 
 are pleased to observe such liberal subscription on 
 the part of our farming community, and would be 
 glad to have them extend it in the direction of the 
 Farm -Journal. In order to induce them to do this, 
 we offer the following terms to the Lancaster county 
 Ag. Society, or any other county society in the State: 

For 500 subscribers at our Club rates, at 75 cents- 
 each, we will pay a premium of Fifty dollars worth 
 of Agricultural,Books, for the Society's Library. The 
 books shall be furnished at the publishers' lowest 
 prices. 

For any number of subscribers less than five hun- 
 dred, but more than one hundred, we will pay a pre- 
 mium of ten dollars worth of Agricultural or other 
 books, for each hundred. 

For one hundred subscribers, whether furnished by 
 an individual or a Society, a copy of Colman's Euro- 
 pean Agriculture, The American Farmer and Plant- 
 ers Encyclopedia, (new edition) and a copy of Dixon 
 & Kerr's Domestic Poultry. 

For Seventy-five subscribers, either Colman's Agri- 
 culture or the Farmer's Encyclopedia, and Dixon & 
 Kerr's Poultry Book. 

For Fifty subscribers, Colman's European Agri- 
 culture or the Farmer's and Planter's Encyclopedia. 

For Thirty subscribers, Dixon & Kerr's Domestic 
 Poultry and Youatt & Martin's celebrated work on 
 Cattle. 

For Twenty subscribers, either of the last named 
 works. 

The whole number of any of the above Clul)S must 
 be forwarded at the same time, with the Cash, the 
 subscription to commence with the first of the vol- 
 ume. It is not necessary that the Club packages 
 should be sent to any particular office. We will mail 
 them to as many different points as desired. 

As the above list of premiums is a far more liberal 
 one than has ever been offered, we hope our friends 
 will endeavor to secure them, and thus aid in extend- 
 ing our circulation. 

How the New Postage liaw affects us. 

Although the Farm Journal cannot be sent free of 
 postage through Lancaster county, the rates of post- 
 age will be so very low that no one will oljjeot to 
 them. The postage for the whole year will be only 
 two and a half cents, and to any portion of the State 
 the whole year's postage will anjount to only five 
 cents.
