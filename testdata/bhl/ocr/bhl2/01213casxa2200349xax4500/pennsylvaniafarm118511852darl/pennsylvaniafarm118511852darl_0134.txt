A Visit to West Chester. 

To the exclusion of much other matter, vre publish 
 the proceedings of the Horticultural and Industrial 
 Exhibition at West Chester. Having frequently 
 heard of the interesting and instructive character of 
 these Exliibitions, we visited West Chester on the 12th 
 and 13 th of June, for the purpose of ascertaining 
 whether the glowing accounts we had heard were 
 not somewhat exaggerated. To our surprise and ex- 
 treme gratification, we found them all they had been 
 represented. 

The Exhiliition was held in the Horticultural 
 Hall, a splendid building erected expressly for the 
 purpose, and evincing in its structure both liberality 
 and taste. The arrangement of the Hall is such as 
 to display every thing to the best advantage, and we 
 could not but admire the elegant taste evinced by 
 the enterprising managers in the arrangement of the 
 « articles for Exhibition. Every thing was in perfect 
 and harmonious order and the effect produced re- 
 markably pleasing. 

The interest manifested by the citizens of Chester 
 and the adjoining counties, was highly encouraging 
 to the Society. The large Hall was crowded with 
 delighted visitors from an early hour in the day, un- 
 til late at night, and thus for three successive days. 

Combining, as these Exhibitions do, the Industrial 
 ■with the Agricultural, all classes of the community 
 are interested in their success. The consequences 
 are, — they arc largely attended — the display of skill, 
 ingenuity and taste is extensive and varied, and the 
 effect produced upon the mind of the visitor far more 
 pleasing and instructive, than where the products of 
 only a single class are exhibited. Why should not 
 .every county in the State boast similar enterprise ? 
 Why should not Lancaster with her hundred thousand 
 inhabitants, and Berks and York, Dauphin and Cum- 
 berland, and many others ? There is no good reason 
 why the laudable energy and taste of the people of 
 Chester County should not be followed in three- 
 fourths of the counties of Pennsvlvania. 

We cannot close this article without thanking the 
 Managers of the Exhibition for the gentlemanly 
 courtesy extended to us. Our visit to West Chester 
 was one of pleasure and profit, and as such will long 
 be remembered. 

Extensive Agricultural Warehouse. 

Paschall Morris & Co., of West Chester, have re- 
 cently erected a large and elegant warehouse, where 
 may be had all the improved agricultural implements 
 of the day. In connection with the warehouse is one 
 of the best nurseries in the State, under the superin- 
 tendance of Mr. Morris, whose practical and scientific 
 skill as an agriculturist is conceded by all who know 
 him. Any of our readers desu-ing fine plants, fruit, 
 shade and ornamental trees will be able to procure 
 them at this establishment either by personal selec- 
 tion or written order. 

Guauo. 

We are pleased to find our farmers giving attention 
 to guano as a manure, and earnestly hope there may 
 be a more general use of it in Pennsylvania. In some 
 of our eastern and southern counties a considerable 
 number of enterprising farmers are using it upon a 
 large scale with marked success, and many others 
 are experimenting with smaller quantities. In York 
 county, we understand, the judicious application of 
 it has resulted in bringing many of the thin lauds in 
 the southern part of that county into fine condition ; 
 the harvest promising as richly there, as in the most 
 fertile limestone regions. This is certainly very en- 
 couraging, and will, we hope, open the way for its 
 more general introduction. To aid in bringing about 
 so desirable a result, we earnestly request those gen- 
 tlemen who have used guano, to give us the benefit 
 of their experience, in order that we may present 
 the subject in its true light to our readers. 

Many of the failures in the use of guano, are at- 
 tributable to the impositions practised upon purcha- 
 sers by the dealers. An adulturated article is sold 
 for the genuine, and few but skilful chemists will de- 
 tect the imposition. The best plan is, therefore, to 
 deal with persons whoso integrity can be relied upon. 
 The advertisements of three such will be found in this 
 number, and we take pleasure in commending them 
 to the attention of our readers. 

The Crops in Pennsylvania. 

As a general thing the crops of Pennsylvania never 
 promised finer. At pi-esent writing, June 20, the 
 weather for hay making is, and has for several days 
 past been very propitious. The grass is very heavy 
 and the hay well cured. The grain could not be 
 better. In some counties violent storms have beaten 
 it down, but this is not generally the case. The cool- 
 ness of the early part of the season has retarded 
 the corn, though the genial showers of the past few 
 days, with the fine summer weather we now have, 
 will bring it on rapidly. We hear that harvest hands 
 are scarce, in many sections, and that the grain and 
 grass reaping machines will be more extensively used 
 this harvest than ever before. 

Brevity. 

As the number of our correspondents is rapidly 
 increasing and we are very desirous to give our read- 
 ers as great a variety as possible, we have to request 
 that correspondents will be kind enough to make 
 their communications as brief as they can, consistent- 
 ly with the character of their subjects. AVe make 
 this request for another reason. The great object 
 contemplated by the Farm Journal being the dissemi- 
 nation of valuable agricultural information, it be- 
 comes important that the articles be of moderate 
 length, in order that our weekly newspapers may 
 copy them without inconvenience. Short articles 
 are more generally read than long ones, and conse- 
 quently more generally useful.
