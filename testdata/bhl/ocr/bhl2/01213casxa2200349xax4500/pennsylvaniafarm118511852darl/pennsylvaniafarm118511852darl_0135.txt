Atteutiou to Young Cattle. 

The essential requisite to perfection- in an animal 
 is generous and careful feeding from its birth. Many 
 farmers neglect their }"Oung cattle and expect to re- 
 pair the neglect by over feeding when fattening for 
 market. This is a gross error. The constitution of 
 young animals suffer severely from hard fare, and 
 the farmer vrho neglects his yearlings, -will never suc- 
 ceed in rearing as fine cows and oxen, as he that 
 from the hour of their birth gives his stock his care- 
 ful attention and provides good feed in suitable quan- 
 tities, and comfortable shelter from the inclemencies 
 of the weather. By careful attention we do not mean 
 unnatural forcing, as this is frequently as prejudicial 
 as neglect, but a kind, generous, judicious treatment 
 which keeps the animal continually thriving. 

Lancaster, June 23, 1851. 

Mr. Spangler — I send you herewith a stalk of 
 Coad wheat, which was raised in St. Mary's county, 
 Md., from a specimen obtained from the Patent of- 
 fice. It was presented to me on the 19th inst., by 
 Mr. Sands, editor of the American Farmer, Baltimore. 

Mr. S. informed me that he travelled nearly one 
 hundred miles to see a field of one hundred acres in 
 which it grew. It is judged the whole field will 
 average forty bushels per acre. 

The valuable qualities of this wheat are: its re- 
 markably well filled head, together with a stalk of 
 uncommon thickness, amply able to sustain it. It 
 has a strong resemblance to a kind called Sool's 
 wheat, which was introduced in the Genuesse coun- 
 try in 1845, although somewhat different in appear- 
 ance ; the Sool's wheat had no beard and was lighter 
 in the straw. On good land it would yield thirty or 
 more bushels to the acre, while it seldom lodged, the 
 straw being very strong in proportion to its height. 

Our farmers while harvesting their prostrate wheat 
 this season, will probably see the necessity of intro- 
 ducing something of this kind. 

Respectfully yours, vSamuel Peltox, -Jr.

Circular. 

We have received "a Circular expressive con 
 cisely of the objects, advantages and claims of the 
 Pennsylvania Horticultural Society." After enume- 
 rating the (jcncral benefits which have resulted to the 
 community in the great improvement of vegetables, 
 fruits, flowers, &c., the new varieties introduced, the 
 improved intelligence of gardeners and nurserymen, 
 &c., the circular concludes with the following claim : 

The only claim that will at present be set up in 
 behalf of the Society is, that all who approve of and 
 would perpetuate and extend the objects and advan- 
 tages herein represented and allnded to, should, with- 

out delay, be numbered among its contributing mem- 
 bers — which may be done by application one month 
 prior to admission, at an expense of three dollars an- 
 nually, or twenty-five dollar for life. A further in- 
 ducement to admit and discharge this claim, by an 
 early application for admission to membership is, that 
 in addition to the ordinary privileges granted, the 
 members are allowed, both at the hall and at home, 
 the free use of the library (embracing the best works 
 on almost every scientific and useful subject,) and that 
 each member is allowed free tickets of admission for 
 two ladies and himself, to the annual and all the 
 monthly exhibitions and business meetings of the So- 
 ciety, which, independently of all other considera- 
 tions, should be deemed more than equivalent to the 
 small contribution required. 

Delaware Couutj'. 

We are glad to learn that an enterprise well cal- 
 culated to advance the agricultural and manufactur- 
 ing prosperity of Delaware and Chester counties, is 
 undertaking by their citizens. It is proposed to make 
 a Rail Road from West Chester to Philadelphia, pass- 
 ing through the heart of Delaware county. The want 
 of a more direct communication with Philadelphia, 
 has long been felt, and by the want of Delaware 
 county. The superior dairying advantages possessed 
 by Delawarejcounty, should induce the Philadclphians 
 to lend vigorous aid to the undertaking.
