Cure for Murrain. 

Friend Spangler : — The idea has long been enter- 
 tained by drovers, that cattle driven from the AVcstr 
 em Reserve and from Erie county, would escape that 
 disease so fatal to them, called Jlurrain. Experience, 
 however, proves this not to be the fact. Last spring 
 I lost two pair of fine oxen and one cow, by murrain. 
 One pair of the oxen was from the Western Reserve, 
 the other from Erie. The cow was of my own rais- 
 ing. Every remedy of which I had ever heard was 
 tried with them, but without success. One after an- 
 other died, the disease seeming to set all medicine at 
 defiance. 

A short time since, one of my best feeders took the 
 disease. I did not discover it until he appeared to 
 be beyond hope of recovery. His eyes were sunk in 
 his head, and his urine was apparently nothing but 
 blood. In moving from one spot to another he stag- 
 gered rather than walked, and his general appear- 
 ance was such, that I did not expect that he would 
 live five hours. The discouraging results of my 
 former efforts to check the disease, had so disheart- 
 ened me, that I concluded to let the poor fellow die, 
 without an effort to save him. A worthy member of 
 ray family, more hopeful than myself, resolved to try 
 her skill. She accordingly procured a lump of cop- 
 peras, of the size of a hulled w.alnut, and pulverized 
 it, after which she dissolved it in a pint of water. — 
 This was in the morning. Some poke-root was then 
 procured and a tea-cup-full grated, which was after, 
 wards boiled in a pint of milk. A tca-cup-full of 
 molasses was added to the poke-root and milk, and 
 the bullock drenched with it while it was lukewarm. 
 This last drench was given in the evening. For three 
 successive days the same course of treatment was 
 pursued. On the fourth morning, half a pound of 
 Glauber Salts dissolved in water was given him, and 
 on the fifth morning I discovered that his urine had 
 assumed a healthy appearance. He began to eat 
 freely, and contrary to mine, and the expectation of 
 all who saw him, he is now as healthy as any of the 
 other of my feeders. 

I had almost forgotten to say that during the time 
 the medicines were being used no water was given 
 the animal, and this should be the treatment always. 

I have great faith in the remedy, and believe it 
 infallible if .strictly adhered to, as above described.

liiquid Fertilizer, 

1 lb. Nitrate of Potash, 4 lb. Sulphate of Soda, 4 
 oz. Oarbon.ate of Ammonia, 1 lb. Muriate of Soda, 1 
 ib. Carbonate of Lime, 1 peck sifted wood ashes. — 
 mix these ingredients with 2 gallons of water in a 
 tub, let them stand at rest for 8 or 10 hours, then 
 add them to about SO gallons of water, stir well, and 
 jt will be tit for immediate use. 

Mr. Editor : Above I send you a recipe for pre- 
 paring an excellent Liquid Fertilizer, containing 

most of the active constituents of Guano, in a Chem- 
 ical state of combination, and which I have for year* 
 past made use of very successfully in the cultivation 
 of various kinds of vegetables, particularly cabbages, 
 cauliflowers, beans, cucumbers, melons, celery — giv 
 ing each aI)out 1 gill of the Fertilizer, several times 
 a week. To celery plants in trenches, I give a water- 
 ing-can full to every 150 plants twice a week. 

On account of its highly stimul.ating and nourish- 
 ing qualities it causes a very vigorous and rapid 
 growth in all plants and greatly increases the size of 
 vegetables. 

In transplanting, as a general rule, I pour about 
 half a pint into e.ach hole intended to receive the 
 plant, and when it has sunk into the soil, the planta 
 are set therein. I have found by experience,that they 
 droop less, than when set out without its beneficial 
 influence. 

If, after seeds are sown and raked in the soil, a 
 good sprinkling be given from the rose of a watering- 
 can, it will cause a more rapid and speedy germina- 
 tion of the seed, and in a great measure prevent the 
 depredation of worms and insects which often prey 
 on the vegetating seeds. 

It will be found well adapted for Flowers, Pot- 
 plants and Shrubbery. 

The above ingredients may be made into an arti- 
 ficial Guano, for using broadcast, or for on Corn, Po- 
 tatoes, &c., by incorporating them when dissolved in 
 two gallons of water, as above directed, with half 
 bushel of ground plaster, and the same quantity of 
 good earth, without stones, preserving in good tight 
 barrels. J. F. IIeinitsh.

Good .\nd b.\d vinegar. — If a mixture of sulphuric 
 acid and water, (known to be such,) were offered for 
 sale as a substitute for cider vinegar, few persons 
 could be induced to taste, much less to purchase it 
 for general family purposes. And yet a very largo 
 proportion of the liquid called white wine vinegar is 
 made in this way. Sometimes it is colored to give it 
 the appearance of the ordinary cider vinegar. Sul- 
 phuric acid is a poison and its effects upon the ,sy.s- 
 tem, when used in the form above mentioned, are mQst 
 deleterious. It possesses corrosive qualities and dif- 
 fers greatly from acetic acid, which, when properly 
 diluted, as in vinegar, promotes the digestion of crude 
 vegetables, such as salads, &c. Too much care can- 
 not be taken to avoid these impositions in the pur 
 chase of vinegar. Many families use it at every meal, 
 and if composed mainly of sulphuric acid, it w illde. 
 stroy the teeth and lay the foundation for cancer in 
 the stomach. The presence of sulphuric acid may 
 be detected in vinegar, by adding a small quantity 
 of chloride of barium, which will cause a white pre 
 cipate to be thrown down.
