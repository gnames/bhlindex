The following ode, upon tho anniversary of the 
 Berkshire (Mass.) Ayriadiural Society of 181S, was 
 published in Penn.sj'lvania ( anonymously ) thirty 
 years ago, and much admired. It is from the pen 
 of Will. C. Bryant, a name not then known to the 
 public — now at the head of our poets. w. h. d. 

Since last our Tales these rites admir'd, 
 Another year has come and flown, 

But where her rosy steps retir'd, 
 lias left her gifts profusely strown. 

No killing frost on germ and flower. 
 To blast the hopes of spring, was nigh, 

No wrath condensed the ceaseless shower, 
 Or sealed tho fountains of the sky. 

But kindly suns and gentle rains. 
 And libera! dews and air of health, 

Rear'd the large harvests of tho plains 

And nursed the meadow's fragrant wealth. 

As if the indulgent Power, who laid, 
 On man the great command to toil, 

Well pleased to see that law obey'd, 
 llad touched in love the teeming soil. 

And here, while autumn wanders pale 

Beneath the fading forest shade, 
 Gathered from many a height and vale 

The beauties of the year are laid. 

Here toil, whom oft the setting sun. 

Has soon at his protracted task, 
 Demands the palm his patience won, 

And art is come his wreaths to ask. 

AVell may the hymn of victory flow, 
 And mingle with the voice of mirth, 

AV'hile hi-re are spread the spoils that show 
 Our triumphs o'er reluctant earth. 

[ We make the following extracts from a " Lecture 
 on Hair, Wool, and Sheep breeding," delivered by 
 Peter. \. Browne, L. L. D., before the Central 
 Southern rights Association of Virginia, and pub- 
 lished in the Southern Planter at Richmond.] 

Cotton was grown in Georgia as early as 1787, but 
 was not seriously thought of as a great American 
 staple until about 1790. From Oct. 1st, 1790, to 
 Sept. 30th, 1791, tho United States exported 189,216 
 lbs. of cotton. In 18.35, the lands used in the United 
 States lor the cultivation of cotton were estimated at 
 three hundred and twelve millions of dollars. Sheep 
 breeding, for fine wool, dates as late as 1800. and yet 
 it would not be hazarding too much to say that, even 
 not, the raising of sheep and the wool interest, are as 
 important in the United States as was tho cotton in- 
 terest in 1835, and 1 venture to predict, (let who will 
 sneer at it,) that in thirty years from this time, wool 
 will become as [/real an American staple as cotton. 

Until the census is published, we have no very ac- 
 curate means of ascertaining what is the number of 
 sheep in the United States; but we suppose it may 
 safely be put down at thirty-tive or forty millions. — 
 Now if we value these at two dollars a piece, which 
 considering that individuals of good breed are often 
 sold for several hundred dollars, is moderate enough, 
 we have seventy or eighty millions ; then if we add 
 three shillings per head for the land and buildings 
 necessary for their shelter and support, we have one 
 hundred and five to one hundred and twenty millions. 
 But there are many persons who hear me, who re- 

collecting with what avidity everything was received 
 in 1835, that was calculated to improve tho growth of 
 cotton, will be at a loss to discover why what is ad- 
 vanced by trlchology, in regard to breeding and rais- 
 ing sheep and Improving the quantity and quality of 
 wool. Is now heard with such app.oi'ent Indiflerence. 
 Is the examination of a subject which regards thirty- 
 five or forty millions of domestic animals and one 
 hundred mlilions of real estate so insignificant? 

The General Government through the Patent Oflico, 
 a few years since, sent a special agent to Europe to 
 collect specimens of all the fine wools. Ho brought 
 back with him samples from Russia, Hungary, Sile- 
 sia, Prussia and Saxony. They were divided into 
 parcels and sent to the" Governors of the difierent 
 States. The one sent to Pennsylvania lately came to 
 my hands. 1 measured the wools and compared 
 them with the growth of our own country, and had 
 the pleasure of announcing what had never before 
 been known, or even suspected, viz : 

That we cax raise as fine wool in the United 
 States as any country in the world, and finer 

THAN ANY EXCEPT SaXONY. 

This important information, showing that the Uni- 
 ted States has It In her power to create another great 
 staple, equal in Importance to her cotton, was pub- 
 lished in " The Plough, the Loom and the Anvil,"— 
 was read, — has never been Contradicted — and is now 
 almost forgotten ! • _ 

Lot us now examine this subject in another point 
 of view. Let us assume that the number of sheep in 
 the United States Is thirty-five millions. In Germany 
 the average annual produce of fleece Is put down at a 
 trifle over two pounds. In England, where the wool 
 is coarser and less valuable, tlie average is four 
 pounds. Our average Is put at from two and a half 
 to two and three quarters, but I am persuaded that It 
 Is underrated, for I have in my cabinet specimens of 
 fine wool, grown In the United States, from three and 
 a half to four and even as high as five pounds. But 
 suppose we say three pounds ; this will glye_ us an 
 annual produce of one hundred and five millions of 
 pounds: which, at forty cents a pound, will make 
 forty-two millions of dollars. And observe, that in 
 this calculation nothing Is said about the Increase of 
 lambs. The annual production of all the gold and 
 silver mines of North and South America was esti- 
 mated by Baron Humboldt at nine millions of pounds 
 sterling — at present, (except the recent discoveries in 
 California,) it Is less than five millions of pounds or 
 twenty-five millions of dollars. 

Mr. Hughes, a London wool broker, ujion his ex- 
 amination before the House of Lords In England, In 
 1828, on the subject of wool and woolen manufac- 
 tures, thus delivered himself: 

" Other countries are making rapid strides to cam- 
 pete with us, [England,] particularly North America. 
 Within the last twelve months there have been up- 
 wards of five thousand bags of foreign wool, shipped 
 from the port of London alone, for that country, for 
 the purpose of being manufactured. They [tho peo- 
 ple of the United States] are now making very rapid 
 strides and I have no hesitation In believing that, In 
 a few years they will be independent of us for coats, 
 as they now are for hats." 

I did every thing within my power to have our fine 
 wools exhibited at the AVorld's Fair ; had I succeeded, 
 the House of Lords might have learned that Mr. 
 Hughes was a prophet; and that the time has arrived 
 when the American people can not only bo indepen- 
 dent of Great Britain for their own coats, : but that 
 they can furnish wool, of the growth of the United 
 States, fine enough for the most fastidious of Europe.
