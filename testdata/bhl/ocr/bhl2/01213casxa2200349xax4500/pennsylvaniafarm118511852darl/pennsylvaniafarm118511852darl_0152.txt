been still more successful. Admitting however that 
 only twenty plants can be raised in this way in a 
 season ; then in the same ratio in two years the pro- 
 duce from a single plant will bo 400 — in three years 
 SOOO — in four years 160,000 — and in five years 
 3,200,000. 

The root of the raspberry is replete with eyes, visi- 
 ble or dormant. It may bo divided therefore into 
 very small portions. The best time to make the di- 
 vision is at the commencement of the winter or early 
 in the spring. The pieces should be planted in small 
 pots and placed in a cold frame — in a green house at 
 a low temperature — or in a room in the house with- 
 out fire, but with a southern exposure. During the 
 past winter, I have raised several hundred plants 
 from root cuttings in rooms with a northern aspect, 
 without fire, and where the thermometer sometimes 
 was as low as 32° Fahrenheit. This plan, however, 
 of propagating the raspberry, in a room where the 
 sun never enters, cannot be recommended, as the 
 solar rays are essential to a healthy and vigorous 
 growth. 

Having occupied enough ot your space for the pre- 
 sent, I must defer to a future occasion some other 
 remarks I purposed making on this subject, and es- 
 pecially in relation to a kind of food to which the 
 raspberry is particularly partial.

Dwarf Pear Trees. 

Mr. Editor: — My experience in the cultivation of 
 pear trees on quince stocks, is similar to that of ^Ir 
 Eshleman, as recorded in the " Farm Journal " for 
 July. Nine years ago, I grafted some seedling quince 
 trees with scions of choice descriptions of pears. — 
 They all took and grew well during the first season. 
 Several of them attained the height of four feet, and 
 upwards. In the following year, however, most of 
 them ceased growing, and their discolored leaves 
 gave signs of disease and decay. Various suggested 
 remedies were tried — tlie application of sulphate and 
 oxide of iron, charcoal, &c. — without beneficial re- 
 sults. Stirring the soil, and the use of fertilizers and 
 stimulants, were equally unavailing. In the ensuing 
 spring several were found to be dead, and the re- 
 mainder made no progress in growth subsequently, 
 though the cifect of careful transplanting was tried. 
 Last fall I had only two remaining. Both of these 
 put forth leaves this spring; though one of them died 
 within six weeks thereafter. The other blossomed ; 
 tlie corymbs opened finely, but set no fruit; and no 
 new wood has been made. Latterly, it shows, un- 
 mistakeably, symptoms of " the sere and yellow leaf;" 
 and will scarcely survive the winter. 

These experiments were made on seedlings of the 
 common quince. I have two dwarf pear trees, pro- 
 cured from New York, which are said to be on stocks 

of Portuguese quince. These have grown finely, make 
 new wood freely every season, are good bearers, and 
 are now in a very thriving state. From the roots of 
 them, several suckers came up, on three of which I 
 have grafted pear tree scions. These are now grow- 
 ing, and will be set out separately next spring. — 
 Should they live and do well, I shall have to conclude 
 that success depends on the hind of quince which 
 constitutes the stock. 

I have several seedling pear trees, on which I de- 
 sign making an experiment at dwarfing. I shall graft 
 them next spring with scions of improved fruit, as 
 close to the collet or base of the stem as practicable, 
 and allow them to grow one year. In the ensuing 
 spring I shall regraft them one inch higher up, with 
 scions of a diiferent variety, though still of select fruit; 
 and will repeat this operation for two more consecu- 
 tive seasons. The effect will probably be, to dwarf 
 the tree, and possibly may improve the quality of 
 the fruit. The process is certainly a slow one; but 
 it can scarcely be more protracted and less success- 
 ful, than the attempt to produce dwarf trees on stocks 
 of the common quince. 

Cats have a strange penchant for whetting their 
 claws on the stems of dwarf trees, and thus deeply 
 lacerating the bark. A piece of twine, looped to one 
 of the lower limbs, and wound spirally but loosely 
 around the stem, down to the ground and there fas- 
 tened, will prevent injury from this source. Five or 
 six turns to the foot, are suflieient. 

I heard lately of a sapient operator, who grafted a 
 Bonne Louise scion, this spring, on the topmost shoot 
 of an old quince tree, duly trimmed up. He may, 
 perhaps, be more successful in raising dwarfs, than 
 either Mr. Eshleman or myself! W. 

[The partiality of the liorer and other destructive 
 insects for the quince stock is well known, and unless 
 proper precautions are taken to guard against their 
 attacks, they almost invariably destroy them. We 
 have, at this time, quite a number of dwarf pear 
 trees under our care. Most of them were imported 
 from France a few years since, and all of them are 
 grafted on the quince. When first planted, every 
 attention was given them; but, as in the case of those 
 referred to by our correspondents W. and Dr. Eshle- 
 man, they gave unmistakeable evidence of a dying 
 condition. Unwilling to lose them, the gentleman 
 who then had the trees in charge, determined to make 
 a last effort to save them. lie dug a trench around 
 them, which ho filled with suitable manure, and then 
 heaped the earth around the tree until the quince 
 stock was completely underground. The good effects 
 of tills treatment was soon apparent. The trees re- 
 covered their healthy appearance — new wood was 
 rapidly formed, and at present writing nearly all of 
 them are filled with fine fruit. Whether their recov- 
 ery is attributable to the trenching and manuring, or 
 to the covering of the quince stock with earth so as 
 to secure it from the borer, we leave it for others to 
 determine, though we cannot but think the protection 
 afforded the quince stock was the cause of their re- 
 covery. We shall be glad to hear more on this sub- 
 ject. — Ed.]
