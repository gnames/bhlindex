much -wider surface, is of a much deeper green, and 
 more glossy, and we think on all accounts much more 
 desirable than the Auierican balm. The under sur- 
 face of the leaves has two white linos running length- 
 wise, giving it a silvery appearance, whence its name. 
 This tree is very apt to make more than one leading 
 shoot, which of course should be shortened in and 
 kept back so as not to interfere with the main one. 
 In Europe they consider this the true balsam fir, and 
 our balm of gilead the spurious one. It will reach, 
 here, the height of sixty feet. I will resume this list 
 in the next number. PAScn.tLi, Morris.

The circumference of the hole in which the tree is 
 to be planted, should not be barely sutficient to re- 
 ceive the roots, but considerably larger, so that in 
 extending themselves, the roots may find a more loose 
 and porus soil wherein to spread. 

In digging the hole, the surface soil, or mouldy 
 should bo thrown out to the right hand, and the sub- 
 soil to the left; and when planting the tree, the sur- 
 face soil, being richer, should bo thrown iu first, or 
 returned directly on and around the roots, and the 
 poorer subsoil placed thereon, to be subsequently 
 improved by the action of the atmosphere and the 
 application of manure. If any well rotted manure 
 is used at the time, it must be put in only after 
 the roots have been covered with the surfiicc soil and 
 a layer of the subsoil has been placed thereon ; and it 
 should be at once thoroughly mixed or incorporated 
 with this reserved subsoil. 

After the hole has been dug and the tree is planted 
 therein, the roots must be carefully spread out, so 
 that none are doubled in or bent, and thus forced to 
 take a wrong direction. If their natural growtli has 
 been such as to leave considerable vacancies about 
 the stem, the roots may be drawn towards each other 
 at those points, and pinned down with wooden pegs, 
 80 as to distribute them with as much regularity as 
 possible. 

Tlie ground which is placed immediately on the 
 roots should he free from stones and thoroughly 
 broken up, that it may surround and cover them well 
 without leaving hollows or vacant spaces; and, before 
 treading the ground down, the tree should be slightly 
 lifted once or twice, and gently shaken, to settle the 
 fine earth among the fibrous roots. "When all the 
 roots have been thus covered, the ground thould be 
 lightly pressed down by treading. The subsoil, re- 
 tained for this purpose as before directed, is now to 
 be thrown in and pressed down. The damper the 
 ground is at the time, the slighter must be the pres- 
 sure used, or the growth ef the tree will be retarded, 
 if not wholly prevented. 

Where a stake is to be applied, it must be placed 
 in its proper position before any ground is deposited 
 on the roots. If driven in after the planting is fin- 
 ished, as is the usual practice, some of the roots and 
 fibres will be cut or bruised, and the tree injured. — 

The stake should be long enough to extend to the 
 head or crown of the tree, and should have an inch 
 auger hole bored through it five or six inches above 
 its lower end, in which a pin of locust wood, a foot 
 long, should be inserted, so as to project an equal 
 distance on either side. This will add to the steadi- 
 ness of the stake, and prevent it from being drawn 
 out after the ground has become settled. 

The tree should not be set deeper than it stood be- 
 fore its removal ; at least not more than an inch or two 
 deeper, especially if the soil be heavy — lighter soil 
 will settle more. It can easily be seen how deep the 
 tree stood previously. The upper roots, however, 
 should be covered about six inches with earth, let the 
 lower ones extend to whatever depth they maj'. 

When a J'oung tree, just taken from a nursery, is 
 to be planted, it is not necessary to be particular 
 about giving its branches the same exposure they had 
 before. But in transplanting an older or bearing 
 tree, it is of great importance that those branches 
 which had a northern exposure, should be so placed 
 again ; and the northern side should therefore be 
 marked, in such cases, before the tree is taken up. — 
 In planting a young tree, however, it will be of ad- 
 vantage to give a southern exposure to those branches 
 which appear to be the weaker, or to that side of the 
 tree which has the fewer branches. The genial in- 
 fluence of light and heat will then conduce to modify 
 and improve tho shape and appearance of the tree 
 in its subsequent growth. 

It is never advsiable to plant a fruit tree on a lawn 
 or a grass plot. But if, for any reason, it be done, 
 the hole should be dug two or three feet deep, and at 
 least six feet in diameter, that the ground may thug 
 be thoroughly loosened over a large space and the air 
 have ready access to the roots. This area should also 
 be kept free from grass and weeds, be mulched with 
 saw-dust or pine loaves or covered with clean gravel, 
 or be occasionally well hoed up. On beginning to 
 dig the hole, the sod must first be carefully pared ofl' 
 and laid aside, to be inverted and placed in the bot- 
 tom of the hole before inserting the tree. When so 
 placed, it should be covered with some fine surface 
 soil or mould to the depth of several inches, and the 
 planting be then proceeded with as before directed. 

In planting an orchard, the direction of the rows 
 and the distribution of the various kinds of trees, is 
 of great importance. The rows should so run as to 
 permit the rays of the sun at noon to reach all the 
 trees equally ; and they should be so far apart as to 
 allow the trees to develope themselves fully, accord- 
 ing to their natural habits of growth. The trees 
 themselves should be set in alternate ranges, or in 
 quincunx order, thus — 

Trees of lower growth, such as peaches, apricot*, 
 nectarines, plums, quinces, should be set in the rowi 
 on the eastern side of the lot. In the next succeed-
