COTSWOLD SHEEP.

The Cotswold Sheep. 

The Cotswolds, until improved by modern crosses, 
 were a very large, coarse, long-legged, flat-ribbed va- 
 riety, light in the fore-quarter — shearing a long, 
 heavy, coarse fleece of wool. They were hardy, pro- 
 lific breeders, and capital nurses. They were deficient 
 in early maturity, and did not possess feeding pro- 
 perties equaling those of the Down or New Leices- 
 ter. To a cross with the latter variety we owe the 
 modern or improved Cotswold. Having had no per- 
 sonal experience with the breed, I prefer quoting the 
 descriptions.of the later standard Lnglish writers, to 
 the task of compilation. 

" The Cotswold is a large breed of sheep, with a 
 long and abundant fleece, and the ewes are very pro- 
 lific and good nurses. Formerly they were bred only 
 on the hill*, and fatted in the valleys, of the Severn 
 and the Thames ; but with the inclosure of the Cots- 
 wold Hills and the improvement of their cultivation. 

they have been reared and fatted in the same district. 
 They have been extensively crossed with the Leices- 
 ter sheep, by which their size and fleece have been 
 somewhat diminished, but their carcasses considera- 
 bly improved, and their maturity rendered earlier. — 
 The wethers are now sometimes fattened at 14 
 months old, when they weigh fnmi 15 lbs. to 24 lbs. 
 per quarter, and at two years old increase to 20 lbs. 
 or 30 lbs. The wool is strong, mellow, and of good 
 color, though rather coarse, C to 8 inches in length, 
 and from 7 lbs. to 8 lbs. per fleece. The superior 
 hardihood of the improved Cotswold over the Leices- 
 ter, and their adaptation to common treatment, to- 
 gether with the prolific nature of the ewes and their 
 abundance of milk, have rendered them in many 
 places rivals of the New Leicester, and have obtaineii 
 for them, of late years, more attention to their selec- 
 tion and gcner.al treatment, under which manage- 
 ment still farther improvement appears very probable. 

THE COTSWOLD SHEEP. 

fhey have ^Iso been used in crossing other breeds, 
 and, as before noticed, have been mixed with the 
 Hampshire Downs. It is, indeed the improved Cots- 
 wold that, under the term new or Improved Oxford- 
 shire Sheep, are so frequently the successful candi- 
 dates for prizes offered for the best long-wooled sheep 
 at some of the principal Agricultural meetings or 
 shows in the kingdom. The quality of the mutton 
 is considered superior to that of the Leicester, the 
 tallow being less abundant, with a larger develop- 
 ment of muscle or flesh. We may, therefore, regard 
 this breed as one of established reputation, and exten- 
 ding itself throughout every district of the kingdom." 
 " The degree to which the cross may be carried 
 must depend upon the nature of the stock, and on the 
 situation and character of the farm. In exposed sit- 
 uations, and somewhat scanty pasture, the old blood 
 should decidedly prevail. On a more sheltered 
 Boil, and on land that will bear closer stocking, 
 & greater use may be made of the Leicester. — 

Another circumstance that will guide the farmer is 
 the object that he principally has in view. If he ex- 
 pects to derive his chief profits from the wool, he 
 will look to the primitive Cotswolds ; if he expects to 
 gain more as a grazier, he will use the Leicester ram 
 more freely." 

Cotswold sheep of good quality have been imported 
 into the United States by Messrs. Corning & Sotham, 
 of Albany, and arc now bred by the latter gentle- 
 man. I believe there were several earlier importa- 
 tions — but of their dates or particulars I am not ad- 
 vised. — Randall's Sheep Husbandry. 

[It will be remembered that some of the best sheep 
 raised in Pennsylvania are of the Cotswold crossed 
 with the Leicester. Mr. B. Hood, of Chester county, 
 and other gentlemen in various sections have tried 
 them and found them, when crossed as above, a most 
 valuable breed. — Ed.]
