Good Farming; Implements. 

Every farmer should not only provide a complete 
 set of farming implements ; but that set should be 
 of the most approved construction, and the best qual- 
 ity. It is wretched economy to place awkward, un- 
 wieldy tools in the hands of your laborers, when 
 light, convenient, and equally durable ones may be 
 had for the same price. But admitting the price of 
 the convenient implement to be double that of the 
 inconvenient one, the prudent farmer will gladly pay 
 the difference. He thereby, not only spares his work- 
 men, but in the end secures a greater amount of 
 work. With what care should the farmer select his 
 plows. How earnestly endeavour to procure those of 
 the lightest draught, and easiest management. The 
 comfort of his horses demands this, and the extra 
 amount of time and care consumed in the selection, 
 will be more than repaid, by the good condition of 
 his horses or oxen, and the superior manner in which 
 his work is done. 

Many farmers are in the habit of purchasing infc, 
 rior implements for their boys to use. This, again, is 
 miserable policy, and no prudent farmer will ever be 
 guilty of it. If men cannot perform good work with 
 bad implements, how much less inexperienced boys, 
 Give the boys tools of the best kinds, and where 
 practicable, let them be adapted in size' to their 
 strength and capacity for handling them. 

Every farmer should provide himself with a com- 
 plete set,' of Horticultural Implements, and these too, 
 should be of the most improved kinds. One great 
 reason why gardens are so wretchedly cultivated, — 
 why weeds are permitted to outgrow and smother 
 valuable plants — why fruit trees become barren and 
 decay, is, the want of a good set of Horticultural 
 implements, with which to guard against these evils. 
 How frequently does the farmer in a leisure hour, 
 observe the wants of a favorite tree — that it needs 
 prunning — that his hedge needs trimming — that a 
 favorite fruit should be budded, or a thousand other 
 things which should be attended to, but are not, be- 
 cause the suitable tools are not within reach. 

Every farm should boast a tool house so arranged, 
 that every implement should have its proper place 
 assigned it ; and a fixed principle with the master 
 should be to see and require every thing to be in 
 its proper place as soon as the workmen are done 
 with it. A system itic arrangement of this kind 
 fully carried out, would in a short time beoeme a
