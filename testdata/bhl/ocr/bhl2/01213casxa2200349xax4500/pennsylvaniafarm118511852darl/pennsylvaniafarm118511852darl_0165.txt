What we have doue~What we intend doing* 

When we commenced the publication of the Farm 
 Journal, wo promised that no effort should be spared 
 to render it vrorthy a generous support. Agreeably 
 to that promise, we have labored with the al)ilitj' we 
 possessed to lay before our readers such matter as 
 we conceived best adapted to interest and benefit 
 them. We have secured the assistance of some of 
 the most reliable pens in the State, and have good 
 reasons for believing the Journal a publication which 
 every farmer in Pennsylvania may read with profit. 
 This much we have done. 

What wc intend doing. To say that we will make 
 the Farm .Journal better than it has been, would per- 
 haps be saying too much. But, good reader, "ice 
 Kill try." The list of our correspondents is rapidly 
 increasing in numbers and ability. Our scientific 
 and practical men are giving us the benefits of their 
 observations and experience. A highly valued and 
 capable correspondent has offered to translate for us 
 an article from the German, on Agricultural Chemis- 
 try, which will occupy portions of several succeeding 
 numbers of the Journal. This article contains the 
 latest summary of this all-important suliject, from a 
 most competent source, and will, in itself, bo worth 
 five times the price of the Journal to our readers. — • 
 The various subjects treated of, will be fully illustra- 
 ted, which will materially increase its value. 

In addition to this, the articles on Entomology, 
 will be continued, with entirely original illustrations, 
 showing the habits and character of noxious insects, 
 and in that familiar style which renders them so val- 
 uable to every reader who cultivates trees or plants. 

This and much more that will give a permanent 
 value to the Journal, we intend doing. ^\'ill our 
 friends sustain us? We do not complain of the sup- 
 port we have received. It has been liberal beyond 
 our most sanguine expectations ; but we must have 
 more subscribers. Our expenses of publication are 
 heavy, and, kind reader, our family must live. We 
 have a plan to propose, a very simple plan — a favor 
 to ask. We have said what we will do, an<l having 
 said so, will make good our word. In return for 
 these renewed efforts and increased expenses, all that 
 we ask is, that each one of our present subscribers will 
 send us the name of one other subscriber. How easily 
 might this be accomplished? How comfortable it 
 would make us feel. What a vast amount of good 
 would be accomplished by it, for the farming inter- 
 ests of Pennsylvania. Only one subscriber each. — 
 Remember that, only one, and the Farm Journal will 
 go on prosperously. 

The Corn Crop, in Pennsylvania, is as promising 
 as could be desired, and there is every indication that 
 it will be as abundant as the wheat and rye. 

Strawberries . — Those who purpose planting 
 Strawberry beds, should do so during the present 
 month or early in September. 

The Harvest. 

Surely our farmers have reason to rejoice and be 
 glad. The harvest is over, and a more bountiful one 
 they have never been blessed with. The grateful 
 earth has repaid their toil, by yielding her increase, 
 and their barns and granaries are now fiilled to over- 
 flowing. Never within our roenllection has there been 
 such a harvest. The yield has been must abundant- 
 while the crops, so far as we have heard, have all 
 been secured in the finest condition. The weather 
 during the whole of the harvest, was all that could 
 have been desired, so that little difficulty was expe- 
 rienced, and far less expense than usual incurred. 

Severe storms occurred in some sections, but did 
 not do much damage, nor continue sufficiently long 
 to interfere materially with the progress of the harvest. 
 Our neighbors of New York, Maryland and Ohio, 
 are rejoicing over their abundance; the crops in those 
 States, having been equally good. 

ToB.tcco. — The cultivation of tobacco has never 
 been carried on to as great an extent in Pennsylvania 
 as this season. The high prices which good Penn- 
 sylvania tobacco commanded last year, has given this 
 impetus to its cultivation, and caused many persons 
 to engage in it who never before attempted it. The 
 most extravagant rents have been paid for land, to be 
 used for raising tobacco. In some sections of Lan- 
 caster county as much as seventy-five dollars per acre 
 has been asked and freely given. The present indi- 
 cations are, that the coming crop will not be an ave- 
 rage one, and consequently, there must be heavy losses 
 to the growers. With a few exceptions, all the fields 
 wa have seen give poor promise of a good yield. We 
 hope, however, that the balance of the season will 
 prove more propitious, and that the crop will be an 
 average one at least. 

The State Fair. — A letter from one of the Com- 
 mittee of arrangement, informs us that preparations 
 of the most ample character will bo made at Ilarris- 
 risburg, for the accommodation of exhibitors. This 
 is as it should be. There will doubtless be an im- 
 mense display, and nothing should be wanting on the 
 part of the Committee to give every contributor suf- 
 ficient room for the favorable exhibition of his articles. 

AVe have received two barrels of Kentish's Artifi- 
 cial Guano, the fertilizing qualities of whicli we in- 
 tend trying. It comes to us recommended by a host 
 of highly intelligent farmers and gardeners. It was 
 the high character of the recommendation that in- 
 duced us to purchase it. We will try it, and give 
 the honest results. If what is said of its powers as a 
 manure be correct, it undoubtedly commends itself 
 to farmers as the cheapest and best fertilizer known. 

Several able and interesting communications havo 
 been crowded out. They shall appear in our next.
