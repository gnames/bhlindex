The Fi-iiit groxcer's Hand book ; a concise Manual of 
 direction.^ for the selection and culture of the best 
 Hard// Fruit in the garden or orchard. By William 
 G. Waring, Boalsburg, Centre county, Pa., 1851. 
 16 mo. pp. 134. 

We have seldom met with a book to correspond as 
 ■well with its title as this Hand book does. It com- 
 mences with tables, having various fruits arranged 
 in the order in which they ripen, so that the orch- 
 ardist, in making his selections, is enabled to have a 
 succession of bearing trees during the entire fruit 
 season. Then follows a descriptive list of various 
 fruits in alphabetical order, the qualities being indi- 
 cated by varying the size of the type in such manner 
 that the eye immediately recognizes the superior 
 kinds. The book is illustrated with many well exe- 
 cuted wood cuts which will be of great use in ena- 
 bling the reader to distinguish the varieties. 

The diseases and insects which infest fruit trees 
 arc noticed, and every necessary information that can 
 be compressed into a volume of this size. The pro- 
 nunciation of many of the foreign names is given, 
 but we notice on page 73 that the German z is given 
 dz instead of ts. 

The second part of the book is entitled " IIow, 
 when, and where to plant," and is accordingly devo- 
 ted to cultivation, including an outline of vegetable 
 physiology. 

We recommend this manual to all who arc inte- 
 rested in the cultivation of fruits, and congratulate 
 the citizens of the interior counties of Pennsylvania 
 upon the advanced state of horticulture amongst 
 them, as indicated by the publication of such a meri- 
 torious work in their midst. 

tables, such as cabbages and roots, amounts to more 
 than 80 or 85 per cent, of their weight in a fresh state, 
 The second reduces their volume, augments their 
 density, making it equal to that of pine wood, and 
 thus facilitates their preservation and storage. It is 
 sufficient to soak them in warm water from thirty to 
 forty-five minutes, when they re-absorb all the water 
 which they have lost; they are then boiled for an 
 hour or two according to their nature, and season in 
 the usual way. A number of experiments made by 
 the Navy department establish the quality and per- 
 fect preservation of these products after voyages of 
 four years. 

Journal of the Franklin Institute — devoted to Mechani- 
 nical and Physical science, civil engineering, the 
 arts and viamifactures, and the recording cf Ameri- 
 can and other patented inventions. 
 This large and valuable monthly journal is edited 
 by Prof. J. r. Trazer, and published by the Franklin 
 Institute at $5.00' a year. It is well illustrated by 
 plates and figures, and cannot well be dispensed with 
 by those interested in the subjects to which it is do- 
 voted. We extract the following translation from 
 the French. 

Method of Preserving Vegetable alimentary sub- 
 stances. By M. Masson, chief gardener to the Central 
 Horticidtural Society of France. The author has ar- 
 rived at a simple and very practical method for dry- 
 ing vegetable substances without altering their con- 
 stitution, and for reducing them to a very small 
 volume without losing their flavor or nutritious pro- 
 perties. The process consists in drying them at a 
 low temperature in stoves heated to about 95° Fahr., 
 and in a very powerful compression by hydraulic 
 press. The first operation deprives the substances 
 of the superabundant water, which, for certain vege- 

Report of the American Pomological congress held in 
 the city nf Cincinnati on the 2d, 'id, and Ath of 
 October, 1850. Published by the Ohio State Board 
 of Agriculture. Columbus, 1851, pp., 79. 

This Congress is made of members from different 
 parts of the United States and Canada, and the report 
 of its last meeting contains various matters of interest. 
 Fruits brought together and compared before such a 
 Congress will eventually be known by the same name 
 over the Union, so that a great source of error and 
 confusion will be avoided. An important feature of 
 these meetings is the vote for and against certain va- 
 rieties of fruit, the list having become so enormously 
 large that it is next to impossible for a purchaser to 
 select; or a nurseryman to supply the kind likely to 
 be called for. The Congress has already placed a 
 consideraljle number of varieties upon their list of 
 fruits unworthy of being cultivated, but the corres- 
 ponding list of what constitute the best fruits, advan- 
 ces very slowly, owing to the great diversity of opinion 
 among those who have their favorites. 

The list of " State Fruit Committees" is full except 
 with respect to Rhode Island and North Carolina. 

The officers of the meeting were Prest. — W. D. 
 Brincklc, M. D., Penna.; Vice Presfs. — J. A. Kcnni- 
 cott. III.; Lawrence Young, Ky.; James Dungall,

Proctor, Jr. Philadelphia. Published Quarterly

This Journal is devoted to Pharmacy, Chemistry, 
 Zoology, Botany, Mineralogy, &c., in their relations 
 with Materia medica ; and we are glad to find that 
 advertisements of quack medicines are not admitted. 
 In a sensible article on the recent homicide case in
