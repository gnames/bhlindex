furmers better informed on the subject, they would 
 withdraw their suggestion as being pregnant with 
 evils far greater than those they propose to remove. 
 For instance, take the root of Hydrastis canadensis, 
 one physician would direct, 'Take of (jolden seal 
 root,' another, 'Take of yellow root,' a third, 'Take 
 of oranye root,' and a fourth, 'Take of piiccoon root,' 
 and they would all mean the same thing. Would 
 not the license thus given tend to multiply the diffi- 
 culty already existing? We think so."

To Fry You.n'g Chickens. — As this is the season 
 for young chickens, we commend the following recipe 
 for frying them, to our lady readers. Take your 
 chickens from the coop, just when you are ready to 
 clean them. Chop or wring off their heads — instantly 
 disemljiiwel them — wash them thoroughly with hot, 
 (not cold) water, and drop them into a pan of boiling 
 hot, nice sweet lard. Let them fry until nicely 
 browned, then serve them with rich cream gravy. — 
 Having once tried this plan, those who glory in fried 
 chicken will never try any other. It is the ne plus 
 ultra mode. 

To Fry Potatoes. — The usual practice of frying 
 potatoes until they are brown and crisp, is an abomi- 
 nable one. Fried potatoes to be of the right sort, 
 should be boiled, suffered to get cold, cut in 
 slices, sprinkled with salt and pepper, and thrown in- 
 to a pan containing an abundance of hot fat. They 
 should be left in the lard only a sufficient length of 
 time to heat them thoroughly, then taken out, thrown 
 into a cullender to drain, and served up as soon as 
 ready. Try this plan. 

To Cure a Good Ham. — Take 12 hams of common 
 size, 8 lbs of brown Sugar, crystalized Saltpetre half 
 a pound, and five pounds fine Liverpool Salt. Hub 
 the hams well with mixture, and lay them in a cask, 
 with the skin down, where they should remain for a 
 week. Then make a brine strong enough to bear an 
 egg, add two or three quarts of ley from hickory 
 ashes, and refine the whole by boiling and skimming. 
 Cover your hams with the brine — let them remain 
 three or^ four weeks, then hang them up in a smoke 
 house, and smoke well with hickory wood. 

To MAKE Lemon Whey. — Pour into boiling milk 
 as much lemon-juice as will make a small quantity 
 quite clear ; dilute with hot water to an agreeable 
 smart aeid, and put in a bit or two of sugar. This 
 is less heating than if made of wine, and, if only to 
 excite perspiration, answers as well. — Lady's Book. 

How TO DESTROY Flies. — Pour a little simple oxy- 
 mel (an articlesold by druggists) into a common tum- 
 bler glass, and place in the glass a piece of cap paper, 
 made into the shape of the upper part of a funnel, 
 with a hole at the bottom to admit the flies. At- 
 tracted by the smell, they readily enter the trap 
 in swarms, and by the thousands soon collected 
 prove that they have not the wit or the disposition to 
 return. 

An excellent wash for the mouth is made of half 
 an ounce of tincture of myrrh and two ounces of Pe- 
 ruvian bark. Keep in a phial for use. A few drops 
 in a glass of water are sufficient. 

Melon Bug Bane. 

Mr. Editor: — I send you the recipe for a mixture 
 which 1 think Mr. Keller will find efl'ectual for the 
 destruction of the bugs which annoy him and. his 
 neighbors so much. I have found it so for many 
 years, and therefore confidently recommend it. — 
 Should it answer the purpose, the fifty dollars offered 
 may be forwarded to you. 

1 lb. Black walnut leaves cut small. 

1 lb. rasped quassia wood. 

J lb. soot from chimney. 

1 gallon water. 

J pint potash soap, (family soft soap.) 

Boil for thirty minutes, then add six gallons of wa- 
 ter, pour the whole into a keg and after having ma- 
 cerated for twenty-four hours it will be fit for use, 
 and may be strained through a muster bag by ex- 
 pression. To be sprinkled on melon, squash, cucum- 
 ber vines, and upon all other plants infected with 
 bugs and insects, by means of a brush or the rose of 
 a watering can early in the morning or at close of 
 the dav. J. F. H. 

To KEEP Clothes Pure. — Lay between the folds of 
 garments that have acquired an unpleasant odor from 
 being laid away for some time, pieces of newly made 
 charcoal. The charcoal will absorb the odor and 
 render the clothes sweet and nice.
