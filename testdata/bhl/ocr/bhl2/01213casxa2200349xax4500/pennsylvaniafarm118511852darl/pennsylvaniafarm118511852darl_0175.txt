We have received the following communications on 
 Guano, in anavrer to our request for the results of ex- 
 periments : 

PniLADELpniA, Aug. 5, 1851. 
 Dear Sir : — In your mimbor for this month, you 
 ask for the results of experiments with guano. I will 
 give you my experience with that celebrated manure. 
 I tried it on grass, clover, potatoes and turnips, 
 in the spring of 1845. As the experiments were 
 given in detail in the Farmer's Cabinet, Sept. No.^ 
 for that year, I will do no more now than to mention 
 the results in a general way. 

My success, in every experiment, was fully up to 
 the character of the manure. The next year I tried 
 it on wheat, at the rate of three hundred pounds to 
 the acre, but no effect was seen, unless the ruin of the 
 crop on the portion which received the guano, be 
 taken as the result of that experiment. 

I formed several conclusions from the results of 
 my experiments, that I will take the liberty of giving 
 to your reader.s, for their consideration. 

It is too delicate and dangerous a manure for gen. 
 eral use, for where it does no good it does much mis- 
 chief. You might just as well expect vegetative 
 action from electricity or gunpowder as from this ar- 
 ticle. T he three conditions absolutely necessary 
 be observed, when designing to use it, make it incon^ 
 venient to employ, unless in small quantities. These 
 conditions are, to put it in during a rain, immediate- 
 ly after a rain, or just before a rain. If these are 
 not observed, it will burn all before it. 

Then the trouble of pounding it to a powder and 
 mixing it with mould or plaster, gives additional trou- 
 ble and labor to the man who has no extra hands, and 
 who will find no pleasure in an uncertain experiment, 
 merely for the philosophy or science of the thing, 
 which stands him in, eight dollars the acre. Then 
 again if the land is rich and in good order, the appli- 
 cation is superfluous, as it makes clover grow several 
 feet in height, but with a stalk so stiff, cattle might 
 as well chew the rails of the fence. Wheat too, it 
 will send into the air, vigorously and loftily, but 
 gives no proportionate amount of grain. On the 
 whole, I came to the conclusion, that on good soils, 
 in good condition, it would not pay; but on poor soils, 
 or worn-out soils, if carefully managed, its value is 
 inestimable. Delaware and Maryland are evidences 
 of this truth. In the latter State, a farmer applied it 
 on t«n acres of corn, and harvested eleven hundred 
 measured bushels as his crop. Also to gardeners it 
 is of great value, but the working farmer of small 
 capital, must look before h« leaps. 

Very respectfully yours, A. L. Elwyn*. 

Mr. Ebitor: — Your repeated calls in the Farm 
 Journal, for the results of experiments made io our 

county with guano, has induced me to give the re- 
 sult of mine, which, though very limited, you may 
 dispose of as you see proper. 

In 1846, I bought a barrel (about 300 lbs.) of gna. 
 no, part of which 1 mixed with an equal quantity of 

plaster, and sowed it on grass intended for hay. 

Another part I sowed unmixed alongside the mixed. 
 Some I sowed on wheat at the same time, and to t«st 
 its effects, 1 varied the quantity, at the rat« of from 
 one to three bushels per acre. From all this I could 
 see no beneficial results. 

About tlie half of the barrel I kept for the corn, 
 part of which I put on, mixed as above, and some 
 pure, and when the corn was up, the result was the 
 same as on grass and wheat. 

But before 1 had planted the corn, a neighbor 
 handed me a pamphlet on guano, its application, &<;., 
 and as I had no prejudice against book farming, I 
 strictly followed its directions, which were, as near 
 as I remember, as follows: " When your corn ground 
 is marked out, spread about half a gill of guano at 
 the mark for every hill, cover it half an inch with 
 earth, drop the corn on this, and cover it in the usual 
 way." A square of twenty hills each way, the aver- 
 age quality of the field, was planted in this manner, 
 and the result here was visible as soon as the com 
 came up. It was of a darker green, and more luxu- 
 riant growth than any around it, and soon had the 
 start and maintained it during its growth, being from 
 six to twelve inches taller than the rest immediately 
 surrounding it. But the season being very favorable 
 and the soil (a clayey limestone a little mixed with 
 sand) in a pretty good condition, the yield was not so 
 great as it was during its growth. I was not, however, 
 particular enough to weigh the corn of this, and an 
 equal number of hills alongside, anfl compare them, 
 to know what the exact difference in quantity was.

Mr. Editor:— a writer .in your paper speaks of 

the backwardness of Pennsylvania in agriculture. 

This is a mistake, the truth is the other way, and I 
 have no hesitation in asserting, that agriculture as an 
 art, is no where in this country understood as well 
 or practised as well as in Lancaster, Chester, Dela- 
 ware, Montgomery and Bucks. In New York, or 
 New England, or in some other States, there may be 
 individuals who cultivate their lands as well or bet- 
 ter than it is done in these counties, but no where 
 on this continent is agriculture so well advanced a« 
 there. We shall see what will be done at Ilarrisbur" 
 — Cumberland, Franklin and Dauphin are fine coun- 
 ties, and if not too modest, may make Pennsylvanians 
 proud of their State. But when the exhibition is 
 held at Lancaster, Norristown, Newtown, or West 
 Chester, I am satisfied that the triumph and exulta 
 tion will be immense. Let Pennsylvania put herself 
 a little more forward and bristle up a little, and you 
 will see several other States droop their crests. E.
