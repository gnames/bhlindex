TRANSLATED FOR THE FARM JOURNAL. 

Agricultural Chemistry. 

Lobe's Encyclop.bdia of Agriculture, from which 
 the following article is translated, is a German serial 
 now in the course of publication at Leipzig. Twen- 
 ty-six livraisons or parts have been issued, and the 
 whole is to be comprised in forty, illustrated with 
 wood cuts. This publication difiers, in its plan and 
 execution, from others of like name or similar char- 
 acter, mainly by the arrangement of the subjects 
 treated of in comprehensive classes and the discus- 
 sion of each fully and independently. Hence, the 
 reader is not annoyed and perplexed by vexatious re- 
 ferences from one article to numerous others, nor 
 compelled to collect and in a great measure compile 
 for himself the information he seeks. It possesses, 
 besides, a decided advantage in being the first publi- 
 cation of its class issued since agriculture has pro- 
 perly become elevated to the rank of a science. Its 
 editor (who is also the publisher of an agricultural 
 paper, and of the Year Book of agricultural progress, 
 discovery and statistics.) is aided by numerous com- 
 petent assistants, among whom are practical farmers, 
 scientific gentlemen, principals of farm schools, and 
 professors in agricultural colleges. The article on 
 agricultural chemistry prepared for this work, has 
 been selected for translation, under the impression 
 that the manner in which the subject is treated fits it 
 peculiarly for the first volume of the Farm Journal — 
 a periodical circulating extensively among practical 
 cultivators of the soil, a portion of whom, probably, 
 have not hitherto had their attention turned in this 
 direction. To such, a general view of a subject, ac- 
 knowledged by those conversant with it, to be of 
 great importance to husbandmen, can scarcely fail 
 to be interesting at»d instructive ; and will serve to pre. 
 pare them for the profitable perusal and study of 
 more elaborate treatises. W.

 Aoricultural chemistry is the application of the 
 principles and processes of chemical science to the 
 operations of rural economy. The numerous, impor- 
 tant and various benefits which the natural sciences 
 in general confer, directly and indirectly, on the cul- 
 tivation of the soil — aside from the gratification and 
 mental improvement which the study of them imparts 

can scarcely be suiEciently appreciated. Relying 

on the ascertained and demonstrated principles and 
 truths of these sciences, the agriculturist is enabled 
 to investigate, solve and explain every natural phe- 
 nomenon or occurrence falling within the province 
 of his occupation or pursuits, and thereby not unfre- 
 quently to reJute and explode antiquated or false 
 views, erroneous practices and pernicious prejudices. 
 From personal observation and reflection, he will be 
 able, also, to deduce and develope valuable principles 
 applicable in the routine of his avocation. On the 

basis of independent logical induction, he may devise 
 and apply new processes and improved methods of 
 culture; proceed intelligently and with confidence in 
 the composition and application of artificial stimu- 
 lants and fertilizers; may quality' himself to estimate 
 with precision the value of soils, manures and pro- 
 ducts; and, finally, be able to form a correct opinion 
 of the worth or worthlessncss of proposed innovations 
 in practice, and of the ti-utli or falsity of novel theo- 
 ries in science. 

Among the natural sciences, chemistry, though 
 held in low estimation by many practical farmers, 
 has undoubtedly a most intimate connection with 
 agriculture, and yields to it the most important aid. 
 Thaer, one of the most eminent and successful prac- 
 tical cultivators, and a highly distinguished agricul- 
 tural writer, did not fail to pursue the study of this 
 science with untiring assiduity ; and the celebrated 
 Humpurev Daw, in the introduction to his course 
 of lectures on agricultural chemistry, says : — 

" Information collected after views of distinct in- 
 quiry, would necessarily be more accurate, and more 
 capable of being connected with the general princi- 
 ples of science; and a fevr histories of the results of 
 truly philosophical experiments in agricultural che- 
 mistry, would be of more value in enlightening and 
 benefitting the farmer, than the greatest possible ac- 
 cumulation of imperfect trials, conducted merely in 
 the empirical spirit. It is no unusual occurrence for 
 persons who agree in favor of practice and experience, 
 to condemn generally all attempts to improve agri- 
 culture by philosophical inquiries and chemical me- 
 thods. That much vague speculation may be found 
 in the works of those who have lightly taken up agri- 
 cultural chemistry, it is impossible to deny. It is not 
 uncommon to find a number of changes rung upon 
 a string of technical terms, such as oxygen, hydro- 
 gen, carbon and azote, as if the science depended 
 on words rather than on things. But this is in 
 fact an argument for the necessity of the establish- 
 ment of just principles of chemistry on the subject. 
 Whoever reasons upon agriculture, is obliged to re- 
 cur to this science. He feels that it is scarcely pos- 
 sible to advance a step without it ; and if he is satis- 
 fied with insufficient views, it is not because he pre- 
 fers them to accurate knowledge, but generally be- 
 cause they are more current. If a person journeying 
 in the night wishes to avoid being led astray by the 
 ignis fatuus, the most secure method is to carry a 
 lamp in his own hand. It has been said, and un- 
 doubtedly with great truth, that a philosophical che- 
 mist would most probably make a very unprofitable 
 business of farming; and this certainly would be the 
 case, if he were a mere philosophical chemist; and 
 unless he had served his apprenticeship to the prac- 
 tice of the art, as well as to the theory. But there is 
 reason to believe that he would be a more successful 
 agriculturist than a person equally uninitiated in far- 
 ming, but ignorant of chemistry altogether; his 
 science, as far as it went, would be successful to him. 
 It undoubtedly happens in agricultural chemical ex- 
 periments, conducted after the most refined theoreti- 
 cal views, that there are many instances of failure 
 for one of success. This is inevitable from the capri- 
 cious and uncertain nature of the causes that operate, 
 and from the impossibility of calculating on all cir- 
 cumstances that may interfere. But this is far from 
 proving the inutility of such trials; one happy result,
