■which can generally improve methods of cultivation, 
 is worth the labor of a whole life; and an unsuccess- 
 ful experiment well observed, must establish some 
 truth or tend to remove some prejudice." 

In point of fact, also, chemistry has already ren- 
 dered no small service to agriculture. If we regard, 
 in the first place, the science of vegetable production, 
 it will be evident in advance that chemistry must 
 have a direct bearing on this branch of agriculture, 
 since the germination, growth, developement, and 
 maturity of plants are results of chemical processes. 
 It is very certain that by making the farmer acquaint- 
 ed with the various inorganic substances requisite for 
 the due growth of plants, and teaching him to em- 
 ploy those substances for their nourishment, as also 
 the best modes for preparing artificial manures, and 
 the proper composition and mixture of substances 
 suited for the food of plants, chemistry has already 
 conferred benefits on agriculture, the importance of 
 which has been practically demonstrated by opera- 
 tions founded on theory. On a closer examination 
 moreover, we find that chemistry has taught that all 
 nitrogenous combinations intended to be produced bj' 
 the organism of plants — such as albumen, gluten, 
 caseine, &o., substances most essential to and most 
 efScient for the sustenance of animals — must obtain 
 their nitrogen in the form of ammonia; because no 
 organic substance can serve as food until it has by 
 the putrefactive process assumed the form of inor- 
 ganic elements (ammonia, carbonic acid, and water, 
 the products of this process) ; and that, consequently, 
 no organic combination is susceptible of being 
 brought, by the organism of plants, into the form 
 requisite to enable these to seize and appropriate the 
 nitrogen it contains. Furthermore, since chemistry 
 has demonstrated that it is pre-eminently the liquid 
 animal manures which contain nitrogen in large 
 quantity, farmers have been induced to collect and 
 preserve them very carefully, subjecting them to fer- 
 mentation and applying the resulting volatile carbon- 
 ate of ammonia to their land, not in a form in which 
 it would speedily escape into the air to be again pre- 
 cipitated by rain, for the benefit of distant soils, but 
 in combination with such salts as chemistry has 
 pointed out, as being best adapted to fix the ammo- 
 nia in a soluble form and thus enable the plants to 
 appropriate it gradually and without loss. 

From the foregoing remarks it is manifest that 
 chemistry is by no means devoid of practical value in 
 the cultivation of plants ; and that consequently this 
 hranch of agriculture may derive immediate and 
 highly important advantages from the resources of 
 this science. As regards the phenomena of vegetable 
 gi-owth, chemistry has certainly furnished the most 
 satisfactory explications of observed appearances, of 
 the nature of which agriculturists had previously very 
 vague and obscure notions. And though all the ex- 
 planations hitherto submitted, should not be confirm- 
 ed by further research or future discovery, she will 

ever retain the merit of having incited to renewed in- 
 vestigations, and of having largely contributed to 
 elevate agriculture to the rank of a science. Tliough 
 farmers may hitherto have derived no practical ben- 
 efit from the remarkable elucidations furnished by 
 chemistry of the nature of assimilation and growth; 
 of the relation which humus bears to plants ; of the 
 composition of manures in view of their effects ; of 
 the nature and elements of rain water; of the effect 
 of gypsum or leguminous plants ; of the conditions 
 requisite for the formation of albumen, gluten, &c. ; 
 and of numerous other subjects and observed pheno- 
 mena, which is explained in so interesting a manner 
 by chemistry; still the explanations and elucidation 
 themselves, will be of the greater interest to every 
 intelligent farmer, because they have rendered clear 
 and plain to him many a process and phenomenon 
 not previously understood. He will now, moreover, 
 not unfrequently be able, by combination and induc- 
 tion, to derive from those explanations, the means of 
 rendering his knowledge practically useful as occa- 
 sions occur. 

But, apart altogether from the practical value of 
 chemistry, every thinking farmer will bo anxious to 
 give a scientific aspect to his pursuits, intimately con- 
 nected as those are with living nature ; for it is sci- 
 ence alone which confers true enjoyment in the busi- 
 ness of life, and elevates man above mere dead ma- 
 chinery. 

With respect to the influence and effect of chemis- 
 try on the management of soils, it must be conceded 
 that by her aid only did it become practicable to as- 
 certain their constituents and composition, and to 
 arrange them in systematic order. So also, with re- , 
 spect to the rearing of domestic animals, chemistry 
 may claim the undoubted merit of having made the 
 cattle-breeder acquainted with the substances which 
 contain real nutriment, as well as with their nature 
 and component elements, and their effects in the ani- 
 mal economy. Chemistry may also take credit for 
 having scientifically demonstrated the truth of those 
 observations as to the comparative value and the ' 
 composition of various kinds of food, which had been 
 gathered and treasured up from the experiments a.nd 
 experience of the breeder ; and of having first explain- 
 ed, and arranged under simple laws, the remarkable 
 and inseparable connection which exists between the 
 vegetable and the animal kingdoms. 

Though, despite of the obvious importance of che- 
 mistry, and of her undeniable influence on agricultu- 
 ral pursuits, the practical farmer has so long and so 
 generally struggled, and is still struggling, against 
 devoting to chemical science, the time, space, atten- 
 tion, and labor requisite for determining with-greater 
 precision the nature and extent of this importance, 
 the fact itself, singular as it may appear, need not 
 create surprise. New ideas and practices have rare- 
 ly been introduced and obtained currency without
