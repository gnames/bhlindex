The Potato Rot. 
 Mr. Editor : — I have read various Essays on the 
 Bubject of the potato rot, and as I dissent entirely 
 from the conclusions of these ■nriters, I am induced 
 to put forth my own opinion through the medium of 
 your valuable paper. 

My views are entitled to no other consideration, 
 than as embodying the result of my own observation 
 and experience, and while these have satisfied me, I 
 do not pretend that they ought to satisfy othors. — 
 Some suppose that this disease originates from the 
 natural decay of the plant, and that it is necessary to 
 renovate it, by planting the ball, and by this means 
 rear a new seed. Others believe that an insect pro- 
 duces the decay. I repudiate both of these notions, 
 and assert from my own observation that these causes 
 do not generate the disease. The first potato rot, as 
 a general epidemic in this section of the country oc- 
 curred in 1842. I had a field which looked very pro- 
 mising for a large crop. In August, after the crop 
 was nearly matured we had a heavy rain, succeeded 
 by a hot sun. It was ascertained that the potatoes 
 immediately commenced rotting, and when they were 
 dug, a large portion were found unfit for use. The 
 ground on which this crop grew, was a clay soil, which 
 retained the water, and prevented its rapid escape. 
 Under similar circumstances I noticed for several 
 successive years, a like result : but attributing it to 
 the popular opinion that the plant had degenerated, 
 or that an insect had caused the decay, and adopting 
 the belief that lime would obviate the difBculty, I had 
 a piece of ground prepared last year according to the 
 most approved motliod of preventing the rot. The 
 land was deeply drilled, and heavily manured. In 
 the drills lime was added, and on this the potato was 
 planted. The growth of the vine was vigorous, and 
 gave indications of a large crop, until the heavy rain 
 the first of September. The ground was level, and 
 the water remained upon the surface until it either 
 evaporated or settled below the surface. This rain 
 was followed by a hot sun, and when my potatoes were 
 dug it was found that at least one-half were rotted. 
 Some were slightly touched, but the process of decay 
 continued, and out of a large crop I had difficulty in 
 selecting enough for my family use. Having adopted 
 every precaution suggested by the different writers 
 upon this subject, I have been forced to fall back 
 upon my own opinion, and to maintain that the rot 
 is produced by the peculiar character of the season, 
 and from no other cause. A heavy rain in August, 
 succeeded by intense heat, where the ground is fa- 
 vorable, will inevitably produce the potato rot, and 
 the reason is obvious. The ground is saturated with 
 water — an August sun pours its heat upon it, and the 
 steam process in the ground affects the surface of the 
 potato, and causes its rapid decay. When this pro- 
 cess of decomposition once commences, its progress 
 continues, and communicates the disease to others. 

I have observed that the first affected are near the 
 surface, and I have also noticed that some are struck 
 hardly skin deep. By exposing such to the atmos- 
 phere the progress of decay may be arrested. Upon 
 sandy soil, such as our river bottoms the rot is un- 
 knovrn, and the reason is, the water settles at one* 
 below the potato, and consequently the action of the 
 sun does not affect it. 

The only argument against this theory of mine is 
 that the rot has not universally prevailed until within 
 the last few years, and it may be urged that the same 
 cause would have produced the same effect. My only 
 reply is, that the potato rot is not of recent origin. — 
 It has always existed under similar circumstances, 
 and though partial in its operations, like causes have 
 produced like effects. Then again our seasons for a 
 few years past have been favorable to the develop- 
 ment of the disease, which has caused it to becoma 
 more universal. 

I have now to suggest the remedy. By planting 
 the potato near the surface, upon ground where the 
 water can easily escape, the rot will be avoided. I 
 would recommend the process of ridging the land bv 
 turning two furrows together and planting upon th-' 
 top of the ridge. The water will then settle away and 
 prevent the chemical action which produces the rot. 
 By exercising care in planting and in the selection 
 of the ground, I am satisfied this scourge which has 
 so extensively prevailed can be avoided. 

While talking upon the subject of potatoes, I am 
 induced to advert to an experiment which I tried last 
 fall. I planted a plot about the middle of November, 
 by making deep drills and depositing about four 
 inches of horse manure, upon which the potato was 
 planted and covered sufficiently deep to escape the 
 frost. The result was that I have had a full supply 
 of potatoes a month earlier than I ever had them be- 
 fore. This may not be new to others, but I took the 
 hint from observing that potatoes left in the ground 
 after digging sprang up much earlier than those 
 planted in the spring. I shall try the experimer.t OLi 
 a larger scale this fall, and I have no doubt of ita 
 success. L. KiDDEtt.

Three Important Facts. — Never be influenoel by 
 external appearance in forming your judgment of a 
 person's worth. This is an important rule, for many 
 a noble spirit is covered by habiliments of the v, orst 
 kind. Dean Swift said that nature has given every 
 man a capacity of being agreeable, though not of 
 shining in company; and " there are a hundred men 
 sufficiently qualified for both, who, by a very few 
 faults, that they may correct in half an hour, are not 
 so much as tolerable." The world would be more 
 happy if persons gave up more time to an intercourse 
 of friendship. But money engrosses all our defer- 
 ence; and we scarce enjoy a social hour, because we 
 think it unjustly stolen from the main business of 
 life. — Selected
