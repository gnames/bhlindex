protected, although the latter had consumed one-fiftli 
 more food. 

The results of similar experiments made by various 
 farmers have led to a similar conclusion, namely, that 
 warmth is, to a considerable extent a substitute for 
 food. The reports of some other experiments seem 
 somewhat discordant, but there are good reasons for 
 believing that in making these, the animals were ex- 
 posed to injurious influences 'which interfered with 
 the results that might have been obtained under more 
 favorable conditions. 

The following practical observation of Dr. Play- 
 fair cannot receive too much attention from our far- 
 mers. " Warmth" he says, " is not only essential to 
 iheir health and fattening progress, but this must be 
 a dri/ and a wholesome warmth. To confine sheep, 
 as is sometimes done, over putrefying masses of fold, 
 shed, or farm-yard dung, in an atmosphere saturated 
 with the fumes of ammonia and the gases of putre- 
 faction, is to substitute one drawback upon the health 
 and comfort of the animal for another, which pro- 
 duces a greater evil than cold. The sheep, in a state 
 of nature, carefully avoids all these things ; it leaves 
 to the ox the deep rank growing grasses of the damp 
 lowland pastures. It carefully seeks its food and its 
 habitation on the highest elevations, amid dry rocks 
 and heath-producing soils, far away from all great 
 masses of decomposing organic matter. The domes- 
 tic sheep of our inclosed lands, by always occupying 
 the most elevated portions of the field, clearly indi- 
 cates that its natural instinct in this respect is still 
 unchanged by all the efibrts of the breeder. Follow, 
 then, the sheep from his upland pastures, in the clear, 
 dry, warm climate of Asia, and view him placed in 
 our cold temperature, in a warm shed it is true, but 
 with tlie floor of that shed covered to the depth of 
 many inches with a mass of putrefying dung, and 
 then let us ask ourselves, ' is this the way fairly to 
 test the advantages of shelter and of warmth to the 
 domestic sheep ? Is this the way to fairly try the 
 economy of raising the temperature of the atmosphere 
 in which it is placed ?" 

The noxious influences to which sheltered stock 
 are so often subjected and the loss sustained there- 
 from, have been already referred to in an article fur- 
 nished by us in the first number of the Farm .Journal," 
 on " The importance of Ventilation, Cleanliness and 
 Draining, for the preserration of the Health of Do- 
 mestic Animals." Mr. George Debits, the author of 
 a most valuable prize "essay on fattening cattle," 
 published in the Royal Agricultural Society of Eng- 
 land, remarks, that cleanliness, warmth, and quiet 
 are the great points to be insisted upon, coupled of 
 course with good feeding. He makes no mention of 
 free ventilation or the necessity for an ample supply 
 of fresh air, which we regard as an important omis- 
 sion. 

As immediately connected with this subject, those 
 sufficiently interested would do well to consult the 

tables very recently furnished, showing the propor- 
 tions of the elements in different kinds of food which 
 go to the formation of flesh, and the substance of ani- 
 mal heat. Those furnished by vegetables destined to 
 the formation of flesh and perfectly identical with 
 similar elements found in the completion of animal 
 structures, and known by the names of gluten or glue, 
 albumen, of which a pure example is furnished by the 
 white of an egg, fibrin, or flesh, and casein, curd or 
 cheesy matter. The elementary portions of vegeta- 
 bles which are suited for the supply of animal heat 
 are of a very difierent kind from those just enumera- 
 ted as entering into the composition of ficsli, and con- 
 sist of sturch, gum, svgar, &c. Knowing tliese facts 
 it becomes a money question as to the value of par- 
 ticular kinds of food for the support of animals, whe- 
 ther the profit from these is to be derived from the 
 accumulation of fat and flesh, or from the other de- 
 velopment of muscle for accomplishing more work. 
 Along with much interesting information relating 
 to this subject, several tables are furnished in 
 the Farmer's and Planter's Enc!/clo}]a:dia, {Articles 
 Ventilation, <£'c.) showing the quantities of turnips, 
 potatoes, meat, bread, oatmeal, beans, and various 
 other kinds of food necessary to produce one pound 
 of flesh, and the money-cost of its production, as well 
 as the value of various kinds of food considered as 
 fuel to sustain animal heat, to furnish flesli and fat.

Agricultural Societies. 

Mr. Editor: — Since the organization of the Stat« 
 Society last winter and the liberal action of the Le- 
 gislature, several county agricultural societies have 
 been formed in the western part of the State. Brad- 
 ford and Luzerne are among the number. Susque- 
 hanna and Wayne had previously organized their 
 societies and been a few years in operation. Wyo- 
 ming, Pike and Jlonroe will not be long in following 
 the example. 

The importance of local societies in connection 
 with the State Society cannot be over-estimated. In 
 addition to the general impulse given to the cause of 
 agriculture they are the means of elevating the cha- 
 racter of the farmers in their own estimation. Among 
 many of the sons of farmers an erroneous opinion has 
 prevailed that their vocation was not as honorable as 
 that of the physician, the lawyer, and the merchant. 
 In consequence of the prevalence of this pernicious 
 error, many young men have pressed into the profes- 
 sions and into mercantile pursuits, who would^have 
 been much more useful and prosperous in the pur- 
 suit of agricultural science. One of the blessed ef- 
 fects of these organizations is to correct this error by 
 giving the young farmer a just estimate of the honor- | 
 able character of his profession. 

Tliey have also furnished a stimulus to higher ef- 
 fort. This is an exciting influence in the competition
