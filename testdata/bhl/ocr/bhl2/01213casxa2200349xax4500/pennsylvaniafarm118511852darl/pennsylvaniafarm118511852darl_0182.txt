iatroduced by these institutions, productive of most 
 salutary effects upon the farming interests. 

The science of agriculture has been too much neg- 
 lected in Pennsylvania. While every other branch 
 of national industry has been excited by progressive 
 discovery and improvement many farmers have been 
 content to trudge on in the old beaten path unmind- 
 ful of the improvements made and making in their 
 own department. They have seemed to think and 
 act upon the supposition that there was to be no alle- 
 viation of the primeval curse and that " the sweat 
 of the brow" alone was to produce the bread which 
 they eat. But a brigliter day is dawning and a spi- 
 rit of inquiry is afloat for the best means of removing 
 the severity of toil and labor to which farmers have, 
 unfortunately, deemed themselves and their posterity 
 doomed. 

The local societies are doing much to aid in this 
 good work and not only alleviating toil by the intro- 
 duction of improved modes of working the land, but 
 furnishing to the minds of the farmer, by means of 
 books and papers suited to his tastes and adapted to 
 his profit and pleasure, most suitable themes for re- 
 flection. 

In connection with those organizations I hope for 
 much good from tlie introduction into every farmer's 
 family in the country of your Farm Journal. I have 
 derived great profit from its perusal and should not 
 consider myself as entitled to rank among the intelU- 
 gent farmers of the country, if I did not regularly 
 read its valuable and interesting articles. 

I hope to send you a larger subscription list short- 
 ly. Yours, Wm. Jessup.

Eemarlis on the improvement of Sheep. 

To THE Editor op the Farm JouR>fAL. — Since the 
 days of Bakewell, who was the first great modeller 
 and improver of the shape and form of animals, much 
 has been done by other eminent breeders to improve 
 the character and constitution of cattle, sheep and 
 e^vine, and to perpetuate the good work. 

The long wooled sheep of certain districts in Eng- 
 land, have obtained great weight of carcass and of 
 fleece ; weighing from 40 to G5 lbs. per quarter, and 
 producing from 10 to 18 lbs. of wool each. See 
 Youatt on Sheep, p. 332. 

The South Downs have also been bred to great 
 weight of carcass and wool, the latter of medium 
 quality and well suited for general purposes. They 
 are hardy and thrifty animals. A cross with the bucks 
 of either of the above breeds on good common or na- 
 tive ewes, produces valuable stock, worth at least one- 
 third to one-half more than the native kind, either for 
 I mutton or wool. Farmers in the interior would find 
 it greatly to their advantage to use such bucks. 

They may be raised vs<ith great profit also on rich 
 and dry-lands within a reasonable distance of large 

cities, on account of the great value of their mutton 
 and wool, and the constant dem.and^therefor. 

Many persons over feed their high bred sheep, 
 causing them to become too fat, which I consider a 
 useless waste of food, as such meat can only be eaten 
 by few persons. The South Downs are thought to pro- 
 duce the finest mutton that we have in the Philadel- 
 phia market, having more flesh in proportion to the 
 fat, and that better mixed than any of the large 
 breeds of sheep, and had they the mountain range 
 of pastures, their flesh would perhaps be as delicate 
 and high flavored as that of any of the small breeds. 

I am glad to see that many farmers are turning 
 their attention to the improvement of their flocks, and 
 were they not constantly subjected to the risk and 
 danger of their sheep being destroyed by worth- 
 less and useless dogs many more flocks would be kept. 
 This evil should be remedied. The most valuable 
 animal in the world should not be destroyed by the 
 most worthless. 

Some very large and heavy sheep were exhibited 
 and slaughtered in this city during the last winter 
 and spring, amongst wliich were tliree wethers fed by 
 Mr. Benjamin Hood, of Chester county, one of which 
 weighed when dressed 234 lbs., the other two 202 lbs. 
 and 192 lbs. The largest sheep, a four years old, 
 was of the Cotswold and Leicester blood, bred by Mr. 
 Pasohall Morris, of Chester county, the other two 
 were Cotswold and Leicester, with one-fourth south 
 down, bred by Jlr. Julm Worth, Jr., also of Chester 
 county, from a pure bred Cotswold buck that I ob- 
 tained from J. M. Mclntyre, Esq., ol N. York, in 1845, 
 and sold to him in 1846, with some ewes of the same 
 breed. The wether bred by Mr. IMorris was also 
 sired by Mr. Worth's Cotswold buck. The buck and 
 one of the ewes had taken the highest prizes oflfered 
 for long wooled sheep at the State Fair held at Al- 
 bany and also at the American Institute, New York. 
 Mr. Worth was the only breeder of fine sheep in this 
 part of the country that could be found willing to pay 
 a liberal price for those fine animals at that time. 

As Mr. Hood purchased those wethers when they 
 were quite young, he certainly deserves much credit 
 for his perseverance and good management in feed- 
 ing them and causing them to arrive at such great 
 weight — one of them being the heaviest sheep ever 
 slaughtered in this country. 

A buck purchased by mo of Mr. Clayton B. Rey- 
 bold, of Delaware, two years old tlie last spring, budd 
 from his imported Oxfordshire stock, produced at 
 shearing, in May last, 16J lbs. of wool. And three 
 yearlings bred from one of his bucks averaged about 
 11 lbs. each. The above is evidence of what good 
 stock will do with good keeping.
