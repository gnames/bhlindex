 Mr. Editou: — In a late number of the Eichstadt 
 " Bienenzeitiing," Dr. Alefeld states that, in the sum- 
 mer of 1850, he phvced a number of grubs or larvfe 
 of the bee-moth ( J^inea cereana) in a glass tumbler, 
 and supplied them with empty honey-comb, to have 
 an opportunity to study their habits and ascertain 
 their periods of development. They devoured the 
 food grc-odily, and all of them spun cocoons, save one 
 — the color of which changed to a yellowish brown, 
 and the insect perished soon after. On opening it, 
 for examination, he was surprised to find its body 
 filled with the larvaj, and a few pupfe, of some spe- 
 cies of ichneumon fly. He was anxious to preserve 
 these, in order to ascertain the particular species to 
 which they belonged ; but, being called from home, 
 he found the whole dried up on his return, though 
 he had carefully closed up the cut in the body of the 
 worm and avoided doing it further injury. This was 
 to him a serious disappointment; for having thus ac- 
 cidentally discovered, as he believed, that a natural 
 enemy and destroyer of the bee-moth exists, he was 
 very desirous of procuring the insect in its perfect 
 state, that its proper order and class might be deter- 
 mined. Conceiving that this parasitic insect, if known, 
 might be made available by apiarians for the purpose 
 of checking the ravages of the bee-moth, he solicits 
 the attention of entomologists to the subject — of those 
 especially, who are apiarians also. 

If, as "the books" say, and as is generally believed, 
 Ike bee-moth in this country is of European origin, it 
 is possible that, though in its native clime it has a 
 natural enemy, designed to keep it in check, that 
 enemy may not have accompanied it across the ocean. 
 The hive or comb, which introduced the Tinea cere- 
 ana, may, when it left Europe, have contained only 
 the undeveloped eggs of the insect — thus presenting 
 no suitable nidus for the eggs of the parasite, and 
 precluding its simultaneous introduction here. This 
 may also be one (or the chief) reason why the bee- 
 moth is so much more destructive in this country, 
 than it appears to be on the continent of Europe. — 
 Apiarians there generally succeed in preserving their 
 stocks, by mere ordinary care; whereas, in this coun- 
 try, tliis can be accomplished only by unremitting 
 attention — particularly ■\^here the common straw 
 hive is used. In the five volumes of the " Bienenzei- 
 fung" now published, containing communications 
 from practical bee-culturists in all parts of Germany, 
 Belgium, Switzerland, Poland, Hungary, &c. there is 
 not a single article that represents the ravages of the 
 bee-moth as constituting any special obstacle, or pre- 
 senting any peculiar difficulty, in bee-culture. In 
 formal treatises also, on the management of the ho- 
 ney bee, the matter is indeed introduced; but is 
 passed over as of comparatively little importance. — 
 The moth is certainly regarded there as pernicious 
 and occasionally destructive; but where stocks are 

kept populous, and are otherwise in a healthy nor- 
 mal state, there seems to bo no difficulty, from this 
 source, in prosecuting bee-culture with success and 
 profit. 

As the moth is on the wing only after dusk or night- 
 fall, and lies concealed in crevices and nooks during 
 the day, it is comparatively little exposed to the dan- 
 gers which other noxious insects have to encounter. 
 And it has therefore a better chance to multiply and 
 become destructive here, if nature have not provided 
 some special means of limiting its increase and thus 
 restricting its depredations. The fact stated by Dr. 
 Alefeld renders it probable that such provision was 
 made and exists, in the native region of the moth; 
 though it is possible that we have not the benefit of 
 its services in this western hemisphere. The matter 
 may therefore be worthy of investigation, and per- 
 chance some of our entomologists, if thoir attention 
 be turned thereto, may be able to ascertain, whether 
 the supposed~ichneumon fly is to be found here; or 
 whether the antidote has failed to accompany the 
 bane in its transition to this country. 

It has been remarked that very few moths hare 
 made their appearance this summer. Early in April, 
 I found one, but have not seen any since ; though I 
 have frequently observed the workers dragging out 
 struggling larvEB from an old straw hive. This they 
 continued to do till after the middle of June. Judging 
 from the strength and present industry of this stock, 
 I doubt whether a single larvas eluded their vigilance, 
 or was allowed to mature. 

The scarcity of swarms, this season, is also a sub- 
 ject of remark and general complaint among bee- 
 keepers — very few stocks having sent forth colonies. 
 This is usually the case, when bees, whose hives are 
 well filled with comb, pass the winter in good condi- 
 tion, and a spring succeeds remarkable, like the past 
 one, for abundance of forage, and weather favorable 
 for its collection. The cells are then stored with 
 honey, as rapidly as the early brood emerge ; and 
 unless an eke be given to the hive, in which new 
 comb may be built, the queen will find but few empty 
 cells wherein to deposite eggs. Under such circum- 
 stances the weight of the hive increases rapidly, 
 whilst, from deficiency of brood, the increase of po- 
 pulation is little more than sufficient to supply the 
 daily losses from birds, insects, and accidental causes. 
 Swarming is then, of course, out of question — how- 
 ever large the mass of bees hanging out, from want 
 of room, rather than from excessive heat, within. — 
 Occasionally, this state of afiairs results in the pro- 
 duction of swarms in July, when forage has become 
 less abundant and the consumption of honey affords 
 room for brooding. Such swarms are worth little ; 
 and the proper course, if drones still aliound, is, to 
 search for and destroy their queen immediately, and 
 let the bees return to the parent hive — which then 
 supplying itself with a young queen, will bo of in-
