creased value as a stock hive, from the large stores 
 of pollen or bee-bread, ■which vrill be collected in the 
 brief interval during which it will contain no brood. 
 It has of late been alleged, as a fact confirmed by 
 obsei'vation in Eui-ope, that the bee-moth will not pri- 
 marily attack honey comb which does not contain 
 pollen. This, if true, is of importance ; and therefore 
 merits investigation. It is also stated that planting 
 hemp, in the vicinity of the apiary, will have the ef- 
 fect of keeping off the moth, as the insect appears to 
 have an aversion to the odor of that plant — which is 
 said to be of like efficacy in expelling the mille from 
 a cabbage garden. Experiments should be made to 
 ascertain whether these statements are correct.

CANADA THISTLE — CURSED THISTLE, OB CRISP THISTLE. 

French — Chardon aux anes. German — Die acker 
 kratzdistel, or Die ackerdistel. 

Cirsium arvense, Scopoli. Carduus arvensis, SmitJi. 
 Carduus serratuloides, Nccker. Carduus hremorrhoi- 
 dalis, — Sorratula arbonsis, Linncvus. Cnicus arven- 
 sis, Pursh, (this name is adopted by most old Ameri- 
 can botanists.) Breea arvensis, Les.iing. 

It is evidently not a Cnicus, for the marginal flow- 
 era are not neutral, the puppus is plumose, and the 
 seeds are not ribbed ! The name of Scopoli, therefore, 
 takes precedence, because this plant is a true Cir- 
 sium ; a genus established by Tournefort about 1G81, 
 and which now contains one hundred and sixty spe- 
 cies. Torry and Gray describe nineteen species as 
 growing in North America ; two of these are exotics, 
 and four of them are but little known, having been 
 discovered by Nuttall and Drummond in the region 
 of the rocky mountains. Seven of them have been 
 found in Pennsylvania. 

Cirsium comes from the Greek word kirsos, signi- 
 fying a swelled or enlarged vein, for which the thistle 
 ■was a reputed remedy, and arvense signifies growing 
 in a field. It belongs to the V3ili class [Sijntjene^ia,) 
 and the \st order (/Equalis,) of the Artificial System 
 of LinnaBus. To order Compositce, tribe Cardui, in 
 the Natural System of Adamson, — but tribe Cynaria, 
 in the Flora of North America. This species is a 
 native of Europe and Asia, and was introduced into 
 the New England State in " timothy seed," and is 
 the most detestable weed that ever invaded the farm. 

The stem grows to from one to three feet high, 
 —<v^, and marked with longitudinal lines, irregularly 
 wanohed from nearly to the base; branches slen- 
 der and covered with a sort of loose wool. The 
 leaves are sometimes a little woolly on the lower side, 
 they are scalloped and toothed, each tooth terminated 
 with a spine, they clasp the stem and are slightly 
 continued down it. The branches are terminated 
 ■with egg-shaped heads from one-fourth to two-thirds 
 of an inch in diameter, with rose purple flowers, the 
 filaments of which are smooth. The leaves around 
 the head (involucre) are oblong ovoid, scarcely termi- 

nated with a prickle, smooth on both sides, with a 
 few hairs on the edges. The seeds are slightly four 
 cornered, ■with the hairs on the crown branched, or 
 plumose, so that when they are matured, they float 
 through the air and disseminate themselves far and 
 wide. 

The roots are extremely creeping, and produce ad- 
 ventitious buds which throw up stems in all direc- 
 tions. To convoy an idea of their tenacity of life, I 
 will copy a short article published by the Bath Agri- 
 cultural Society: 

" April 1st, 1778. I planted in a garden a piece 
 of the root of this thistle, about the size of a goose 
 quill and two inches long, with a small head of leaves 
 cut off from the main root, just as it was springing 
 out of the ground. By the 2d of November follow- 
 ing, this small root had thrown out shoots, several 
 of which had extended themselves to the distance of 
 eight feet — some had even thrown up leaves five feet 
 from the original root. Most of the shoots, which 
 had thus far extended tliemselves, were about six 
 inches under ground, other.s had penetrated to the 
 depth of two feet and a lialf; the whole together, 
 when dug up and washed from the earth, weighed 
 four pounds. In the spring of 1779, contrary to my 
 expectations, this thistle made its appearance on and 
 about the spot where the small piece was originally 
 planted. There were between fifty and sixty young 
 heads, which must have sprung from the roots which 
 eluded the gardener's search, though he was particu- 
 larly careful in extracting them." 

All the other thistles are only biennial, that is, the 
 first year^they produce only leaves, the second year 
 perfect their flowers and fruit, and then die. They 
 are, therefore, easily eradicated, by merely prevent- 
 ing them from going to seed. But the Canada this- 
 tle not only propagates itself by its seeds but by its 
 roots. Although it is generally regarded as perennial, 
 the slight acquaintance I have had with it, induced 
 me to regard it as a biennial. The stem and leaves 
 die down to the ground the second season, but it 
 seems to provide itself with new roots which produce 
 new plants, these in turn live only two years. The 
 only means to destroy it, is to prevent it from pro- 
 ducing leaves, for as soon as the leaves expand, the 
 roots must strike off and produce new plants. 

Many other plants have been mistaken for the 
 Canada thistle. I saw an account somewhere of an 
 ordinance being passed by some city against the 
 Canada thistle, which prfh'ed to be the Xanthium 
 spinosum, "thorny clot-bur." Some species of the 
 Centaurea, Onopordon, Carlina and the different this- 
 tles have been mistaken for it, particularly the Car- 
 duus horridulum, or "yellow thistle," but the flow- 
 ers of this are yellow, and often near two inches in 
 diameter. This thistle may be distinguished l>y its 
 small heads, crisped leaves, smooth stem, and the 
 smooth filaments of the flower. 

It is growing in this county at " Centre line," and 
 tlio indifference ■with v>-hich it is regarded by the far- 
 mers in that vicinity, has already permitted it to ob- 
 tain a pre-emption right that ■\vill be extremely diffi-
