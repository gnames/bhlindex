cult to extinguish. If it is prevented from extending 
 itself in the adjoining valleys it must receive decided 
 attention, and be kept from producing seed. If the 
 whole of the thistles were deeply covered vrith lime 
 and suffered to remain for several years it would 
 effect its destruction. J. M. McMinn.

The proper quantity of Lime on an acre. 

Mr. Editor: — An idea has prevailed, very gener- 
 ally, that lime, applied as a fertilizer, should be 
 spread upon a limestone soil in double the quantity 
 that wiiuld be sufficient and proper for a sandy or 
 gravelly soil. Fifty bushels to the acre have been 
 thought to be the right quantity for the former, and 
 twenty-live or thirty for the latter. 

In the northern and eastern parts of Lancaster 
 county, there are sandstone ridgos, where lime ope- 
 rates with magical effect. Twenty or thirty bushels 
 produce an obvious improvement in whatever crops 
 it is applied to ; but experiments have shown, that 
 the benefit increases in proportion to the quantity, to 
 the extent of more than a hundred bushels to the 
 acre. A farmer, in order to test the effect, measured 
 off accurately a square perch, in his field, and spread 
 over this perch exactly one bushel of lime, which was 
 at the rate of one hundred and sixty bushels to the 
 acre. The crop grown upon it, compared with the 
 rest of the field, satisfied him that no portion of the 
 lime was useless. The gentleman from whom this 
 inforiuation is derived, remarked that, from what he 
 had observed of the effects of lime on such a soil, he 
 believed two hundred bushels of it upon an acre 
 would be more efficacious than any smaller quantity; 
 in other words, that the grass or grain would be in 
 proportion to the amount of lime applied, at least to 
 that extent. H.

Murrain. 

Me. Editor. — Having had many a loss from that 
 most fatal disease, called murrain ; it was with no 
 small gratification that I observed in the August 
 number of your valuable paper, that by the skill of a 
 member of the family of J. B. S., of Fruit Hill, a 
 cure has been discovered. 

The interests of the farming community will be 
 much enhanced by this sine qua non to the safety of 
 herds — particularly should it prove, as J. S. B. be- 
 lieves, an infallible remedy. Believing it well worth 
 the attention of agricultural societies, I would sug- 
 gest that awards suitable to the importance of the 
 occasion should be given for discoveries of value to 
 the farmer and horticulturist, by our State Society. 
 and inasmuch as the benefits are likely to be general, 
 would not this be the proper awarder ? 

Mr. Ilarlacher should not be allowed to pay, from 
 his own pocket, for a remedy against the ravages of 
 the cucumber bug ; though I am not so sure fifty 

dollars should be paid to save pickles merely. This 
 would make the ^ice of recipes of such a value, that 
 the product of the skill of a worthy member of the 
 community would be of too high a price to be propor- 
 tionate, and too onerous to the donors. 

But I think I could go to work upon a case of dis- 
 ease, (should I be so unfortunate as to have to do so,) 
 with more confidence in the means were these more 
 satisfactorily proven to be infallible. 

The belief of J. S. B. is either fixed upon a single 
 trial, as previous to this case, he says, "every remedy 
 of which I had ever heard, was tried with them, but 
 without success" — or he must have made his conclu- 
 sions of infallibility of remedy from the certainty of 
 effects following causes, and a knowledge of the na- 
 ture of the affection, as well as the modus opcraiuli 
 of the medicines. 

That this is the cause of his confidence we are led 
 to believe, partly from tlic prohibition of water, show- 
 ing investigation of the complaint by unerring science. 

We have tried poke-root alone, and have been as- 
 sured that it has cured, by those whose voracity we 
 would not question — but the results are only au oc- 
 casional cure at best — and we would suggest that our 
 friend J. S. B. be not too sanguine, unless he has 
 more ground of faith than an isolated cure ought to 
 beget — seeing no one case is sufficient to establish a 
 rule. 

AV'e hope, however, the discovery, is a good one; 
 and we think the name of such public benefactor 
 should be known, so as to be remembered, at least, 
 with gratitude. 

We wish to hear again from J. S. B. desiring a 
 more full exposition of the nature of this malady call- 
 ed murrain ; as much ignorance prevails as to its na- 
 ture or its cause. 

" An ounce of preventive is better than a pound 
 of cure," and if we could have some insight into the 
 complaint, we might have a preventive that would be 
 worth more than a cure. C. H. L.

P. S. Since, upon conversing with some brother 
 farmers, one suggests that this is the identical cure 
 used very effectually in the neighborhood where he 
 formerly resided. If this be so, it may not still de- 
 tract from the merit of the worthy memlier, seeing 
 the remedy has never been heard of there ; and hence 
 the credit due to investigation and discovery, still be- 
 longs to our correspondent's family — and infallibility 
 the more effectually established. C. L. II. 

Sorrel is a perennial, and prefers a poor soil. — 
 Plowing while in blossom will destroy it, and liming 
 and deep plowing will prevent its growth. The sour 
 t»st« in the weed is caused by the binoxaiate of pot- 
 ash. 

It requires more courage to think differently from 
 the multitude than it does to fight them. The first 
 hero, therefore, was not he who made the first con- 
 quest, but he who uttered the first doubt.
