Progress Iii 
 It is not known to many who have'boen accustom 
 ed to hear of the fertility of Lancaster county, that 
 there is a considerable portion of her broad acres, 
 which is a thin, poor soil. Standing upon one of the 
 eminences, in or near the city, you will behold, at 
 the distance of ten or fifteen miles, a girdle of moun- 
 tainous elevations, which seem to encompass you 
 whichever way you turn. These are ))ranches of 
 the South Mountain, and embrace, within our bord. 
 ers, the Conowago, Chesnut, Turkey, Martic, Octora- 
 ra, and Mine Hills, the Welsh Mountains and Mount 
 Hope; and descend with various grades to the lime- 
 stone valleys and plains, whose extent and fertility 
 have contributed so much to the fame of Lancaster 
 county; for being originally productive, they soon 
 enriched their first proprietors. But the hills and 
 mountains, with a thin, gravelly surface, and a 
 grudging soil, poorly rewarded the labor bestowed on 
 them; and it cost the hardy inhabitants a severe 
 struggle, to enable them, with the strictest economy, 
 to rear their families and hold their own. Many of 
 them, hopeless of bettering their situations in the 
 neighborhoods in which they were born, emigrated 
 to the far west. Few are aware of the great drain 
 of population, which Lancaster county has suffered 
 from this cause. The last fifteen or twenty years 
 have, however, produced a gratifying change. It 
 commenced with plaister of Paris, which was found 
 to have a marvellous effect upon the grass and grain, 
 clothing the almost barren fields on these hill sides 
 with luxuriant vegetation. • 

Farmers began to discover, that it was better to 
 confine their labors to so much land as they could 
 prepare for their crops by a proper application of 
 manure, than by a vain effort to increase their profits 
 by extending the area of their culture to the utmost. 
 After using plaister for a few years, they perceived 
 that its efficacy was diminished, and they began to 
 turn their attention to lime; which was, every way, 
 fortunate, as this supplied more abundantly what 
 the soil required to fertilize it, and at a cheaper rate. 
 Besides, the fertility occasioned by lime is permanent 
 and the material is obtainable in our county, and in 
 the vicinity of the lands where it was needed. It is 
 amazing to see the improvement of this hilly region. 
 Instead of the sterile fields marked with a sparse 
 "•rowth of stunted grass and brambles, and the mis. 
 erable wooden tenements and rickety fences, which 
 vrere formerly the disagreeable features presented to 
 view, you now behold comfortable brick or stone man- 
 sions and good bank barns, in due season well filled, 
 tl\e fields neatly enclosed and teeming with the rich 
 products of agriculture, and orchards laden with 
 fruit. Taking whole neighborhoods together, wo are 
 informed that the yield of grain has been increased, 
 by improved cultivation, five fold; and where no 
 grass was formerly grown, they have now abundant 

crops. The selling value of real estate, has advanced 
 in a similar i-atio; and this is a natural result. This 
 hill country abounding in springs of the purest wa- 
 ter, and fanned by healthy breezes, is one of the most 
 salubrious in the world ; and since it is ascertained, 
 that they can by proper cultivation raise as good 
 crops here, as in the neighboring valleys, the motive 
 and the desire to emigrate have ceased. Tracts are 
 divided to accommodate the multiplying population, 
 a process, by the by, which is much extended — so 
 that the farms of Lancaster county will hardly aver- 
 age at the present time, one hundred acres each. 

Among the mineral resources of our county, there 
 is one whose value, I think, is not fully appreciated 
 — I mean the limestone. It is a most important fer- 
 tilizer. It has already trebled the worth of many a 
 farm, and will ultimately double the productive ca- 
 pacity of every cultivable acre within our borders.

Mr. Editor : — Is not your Fruit Hill correspond- 
 ent too sanguine in pronouncing a remedy infallible 
 from its effects in a single case ? Several plants in 
 different sections of the country are called pokeweed. 
 Does he mean the Phytolacca decandra of Ijotanists?* 
 In the work referred to this is said to be actively 
 emetic. What is intended to be its mode of operating 
 in J. S. B.'s case? What are the cause and nature 
 of the disease? Without this knowledge our prescrip- 
 tions must be entirely empyrical. Is it not analagous 
 to dysentery in the human system? If so, then all 
 the 'palhy's and 'ism's from alio to chronothcrmal 
 have failed to find a remedy infallible however "strict- 
 ly adhered to." 

It is not intended to find fault with your corres- 
 pondent, but with yourself. Would it not bo well, 
 for the acknowledged scientific editor, to add a note 
 of comment upon articles which might mislead ; or 
 are the readers of the Farm Journal presumed to be 
 so scientific, as to receive without allowance such ex- 
 tracts as the following in your first No.? "One 
 Shanghae cock and two hens will produce more eggs 
 in three months time than five times that number of 
 ordinary hens will do in one year." That is, if each 
 hen lays an egg every day — perhaps the cock lays 
 two (too) — it would amount to one hundred and eigh- 
 ty. Now to make this number, the ten would require 
 to produce eighteen each in the year. If the Rev. S. 
 A. B. will designate the variety so extraordinary he 
 will benefit us farmers by enabling us to avoid them.

 [As the particular kind of pokeweed used by J. 
 S. B. was not communicated to us, we, of course, 
 cannot answer J. K. E.'s inquiry, but hope our Fruit 
 Hill correspondent will. 
 In regard to the Shanghae chickens, we assure J
