THE HACKNEY. 

Under this term are cumprised the following: — the 
 cover hack, the park hack, the lady's horse, the road- 
 ster, the i-ob, the galloway, and the poney. 

The difficulty of procuring really good hacks is ad- 
 mitted by all persons who have kept them for the va- 
 rious purposes of cither business or pleasure and for 
 the following obvious reasons, — that very few people 
 try to breed hackneys, therefore, although we require 
 them to be nearly perfect in shape and action, (and 
 perfect they should be to be "really good hacks,") 
 thev may be said to be failures in the breeding stud 
 after all. 

TOE lady's horse. 

The lady's horec is, after all, the most difficult to 
 obtain, because he ought to approach very noar to 
 perfection. His paces, mouth, and tempur, should 
 each be proportioned to the power and capability of 
 his rider; and he ehould be proof against alarm from 

either noises or sights which otherwise might cause 
 him to run away. This description of horse should 
 likewise be well bred, as in that case his action will 
 l)e easier, and his appearance and carriage more in 
 character with the generally elegant appearance of 
 his rider. His pace should be the canter; the trot 
 causes an ungraceful movement in the person of a 
 v.'onian, to rise to it ; and if she do not rise to it, she 
 is much shaken in b.er scat. Neither is the form of 
 the side-saddle fitted for the trot; and the canter of a 
 well-bitted horse is more safe, because his haunches 
 arc more under him in that pace than they can be in 
 a trot. A goodTaold walk, however, with the head in 
 proper place, is essential to a horse that has to carry 
 a woman ; and his action should be very true, that is, 
 he should not " dish," or throw his legs outward, as 
 the term is, in any of his paces, or he will cover the 
 lower garments of his rider with mud when the roads 
 are wet and dirty. To provide against the latter in- 
 convonionce, however, all horses intended for thJs
