purpose, should not be much under fifteen hands and 
 a half in height, which size corresponds with the 
 lengthened drapery of a lady's riding costume. As 
 a preventive against accidents, ladies' horses, how- 
 ever well broken and bitted, should not be too highly 
 fed; and, if at all above themselves, should bo ridden 
 by a careful servant, with good use of his hands, be- 
 fore ladies mount them. It is, however, an acknowl- 
 edged fact, that horses go more quietly under women 
 than they do under men, which is accounted for by 
 the lightness of their hand, and the backward posi- 
 tion of the body, in the saddle. We have, in fact, 
 known several instances of horses being very hard 
 pullers with men, standing up in their stirrups, and, 
 consequently inclining their bodies forward, but going 
 perfectly temperate and at their ease under women. 

The height of a road hackney must be regulated 
 by the size of the person to ride him ; Ijut, generally 
 speaking, from fourteen hands to fourteen hands and 
 a half is the proper height. His strength must also 
 be thus calculated, for a light man does not ride plea- 
 santly on a horse equal to double his weight. But a 
 road hackney should have strength of shoulder, with 
 a round barrel, but not a large carcass, which only 
 wears out his legs. His constitution and feeding can 
 only be proved upon trial ; but there are certain in- 
 dices, such as deep ribs, brown color, hardy muscle, 
 &c., wliich very rarely deceive us. As to the neces- 
 sity of well-placed hinder-legs, it is most clearly 
 shown by the answer given to the following question: 
 If a horse make a serious blunder forward, and the 
 centre of gravity of his body fall beyond the pillars 
 of support, and is for a moment lost, what restores 
 the cciuilibrium? Is it merely the chuck under the 
 chin to an animal of his bulk and weight, and that 
 " chuck" given perhaps by the weak, powerless wrist 
 of a feeble old man, or delicate young lady? No: the 
 main effect of the bit, or curb, in this case is, first, 
 warning the horse of his danger; and, next, by mo- 
 mentary raising of his head, he is better able to bring 
 a hinder-leg instantly to his assistance, by advancing 
 it under 1h6 body, and thus restoring his equilibrium. 
 In the walk, in fact, the horse actually begins to 
 move by advancing the hinder-leg under the body; 
 before the fore-leg quits the ground; and if he did 
 not do so, there would be no equal support for the 
 body, during the suspension of the fore-leg in the air, 
 nor could the body be moved forwards, until the hind- 
 er-leg had, by quitting its station, taken a new point 
 of support. Seeing, then, that in the walk, as in all 
 other paces, the centre of gravity in the horse is 
 maintained, as well as the body propelled, by the ac- 
 tion of the hinder-legs, the greatest attention should 
 be paid to the position and action of them in the 
 hackney, as the best safeguard against his falling. — 
 We should observe, then, when he is exhibited to our 
 view, that, in his walk, the hinder-foot oversteps the 
 fore-foot, at least a shoe's length, which a horse with 
 straight, ill-formed hinder-legs cannot do ; and if such 
 action be accompanied by generally good hind-quar- 
 ters, it is a great indication of safety, so far as one- 
 half of the body of the horse is concerned. But as 
 the false step is made, not with the hinder, but the 
 fore-leg, the chief safeguard against falling is to be 
 found elsewhere, namely, first, in the length of the 
 shoulder, which throws the centre of gravity further 
 back than a short one ; and, secondly, proceeding also 
 fi-om the free use of the shoulder, in the act of setting 
 the fore-foot down on the ground. It is a general 
 but very mistaken notion, that the safety of a road- 
 ster depends upon his lifting his fore-legs high from 
 the ground, when he is said to "go well above his 

ground;" wheioas it all depends on the manner in 
 which he places them down upon it. Not only are 
 the highest goers often the most unsafe to ride, for, 
 when they do fall, they fall with a violence propor- 
 tioned to the height of their action; but, although 
 we do not advocate such extremes, there are thou- 
 sands of instances of horses going very near to the 
 ground, and never making a trip. It is, however, a 
 well-established fact, that if the form of a horse's 
 shoulder, and the consequent position of the fore-leg, 
 enable him to put his foot to the ground, flat, with 
 the heel well down, his lifting up his foot high, is not 
 at all necessary ;,whereas, on the other hand, if, by any 
 improper position of the leg, issuing out of a short, 
 upright, ill-formed shoulder, tlie toe touches the 
 ground first, and, as it were, digs into it; no matter 
 how high such a horse may lift up his leg in any of 
 his paces, ho will always be dangerous to ride. —

Hiving Bees. 

BY MRS. L. G. ABELL. 

Reliable and useful facts, and hints, will make the 
 Farm Journal the indispensable companion of the 
 agriculturist, and if not already known to your read- 
 ers, the following recent incident may be useful. 

I threw open my blinds a few days since and raised 
 a window, to inhale the pure air and take a morning 
 look at the gay flowers that were in full blossom un 
 der the windows, when I heard a most unusual hum- 
 ming of bees; not seeing any on the flowers I looked 
 into the air, and just over my head they were in agi- 
 tated commotion preparatory to swarming from the 
 hive of a near neighbor. On a fine locust, near the 
 front door, they were soon settled, but before any ef- 
 fort could be made to hive them, they commenced 
 flying, and aU returned to the old hive. Next day 
 they came out again, and a man who knew somethino- 
 of bees, was sent to hive them. He called for a long 
 woolen stocking, and drew it on to the end of a pok, 
 and placed it where the bees seemed thickest near a 
 tree, as if they had selected it as a place where to 
 light. He held it a few moments, and the stocking 
 was very soon covered completely with the whole 
 swarm. 

A table had been spread with a white clotli and a 
 hive aU ready. He laid his pole or rather stocking 
 of bees upon the table, and then put the hive over 
 while he carefully drew out the pole. In an hour or 
 two the bees were all in the hive, and placed in the 
 bee house — and in a short time more, they were at 
 work furnishing their new home. While they were 
 upon the table they " cleaned house" and dislodged 
 every particle of dust and old matter adhering to their 
 new abode. 

In two days more another swavm came out from 
 the old hive, and in the same manner the son and fe- 
 males of the family secured, in this simple and easy 
 way, another fine swarm. The ladies told me as I 
 watched their movements, they could now do it any 
 time alone.
