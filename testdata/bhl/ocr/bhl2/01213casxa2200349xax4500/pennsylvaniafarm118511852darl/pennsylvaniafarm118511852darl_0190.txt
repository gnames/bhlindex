Dwarf Pear Trees. 

Being disappointed in the hope that some more 
 able pen would have come to the rescue of the dwarf 
 pear trees, and in reply to my friend Dr. Eshleman, 
 in last month's number of the Journal, I venture a 
 few remarks, in the belief that this mode of propa- 
 gating the pear, is a valuable acquisition to the fruit 
 grower, and that it is rapidly coming into general use. 
 So far as the experience of this immediate vicinity 
 goes, it has been quite successful ; a large number 
 that we have sold during the last two years being 
 now in full bearing, and thrifty and vigorous. I had 
 the pleasure of demonstrating this fact recently to the 
 Dr. himself, in showing several varieties of dwarf 
 trees, standing in the nursery rows, with several spe- 
 cimens of fair fruit each. They very often bear the 
 same season they are transplanted, and I have at this 
 time in my yard, an Easter Beurre with nine perfect 
 pears on, moved last spring. How then are we to ac- 
 count for Dr. Thomas's trees which have been refer- 
 red to, " as eight to ten feet high, well branched and 
 cultivated with the greatest care," producing no fruit. 
 The probability is that his exposure is unfavorable. 
 He informs mo that there have been a profusion of 
 blossoms, and that the trees are vigorous, and as they 
 bear abundantly at West Chester, only a few miles 
 off, but at an elevation of some hundred feet higher 
 than his residence in the valley, it is most likely that 
 his failure results from the same cause that other 
 fruit trees are unproductive in certain situations and 
 exposure, viz : a liability to be cut off by late frosts. 

Another reason why the pear on quince does not 
 slways succeed is, its being worked on our common 
 orange quince. It has been fully ascertained that 
 this stalk will not answer. I have known seve- 
 ral cases in this neighborhood, where it has been 
 tried and failed entirely. Even where they unite 
 readily, it is found they will not grow freely together, 
 the pear soon becomes stunted, dwindles and dies. 
 In a conversation at the first convention in New York 
 two years ago, with P. Barry, the experienced nur- 
 seryman, at Rochester, he stated this to be his expe- 
 rience, and that when failures occurred, it might ge- 
 nerally be traced to this cause. The proper stalk for 
 grovring the pear on,is the imported Angler's quince, 
 which is a mere variety of the orange, but is so free 

a grower that it is almost exclusively used by nur- 
 serymen. We imported, last year, seven thousand 
 stalks of it for this purpose, some of which have pear 
 shoots on them four to five feet, the growth of this 
 season. The Portugal quince is also a free grower, 
 but does not strike readily from cuttings. It is quite 
 distinct from either the orange shaped, both in the 
 fruit and growth. Its leaves are broader, larger and 
 more downy. It has no advantage whatever over the 
 Anger's variety, as a stalk for the pear, even if its 
 high price wore not an objection. 

Another difBculty sometimes occurs with dwarf 
 pears in the quince borer. This insect works at the 
 surface of the ground, and his attacks may easily be 
 avoided, by planting the tree so deep as to cover the 
 point of union. This rule should always be observed. 
 The quince is not injured by deep planting like other 
 trees, and throws out radicles under such circum- 
 stances very readily. 

It has also been said the dwarf pear tree is short 
 lived. This is mere assertion. The proof, so far, is 
 decidedly the-other way. T. Rivers, and there is no 
 higher authority, says they are growing perfectly 
 healthy a;id vigorous in the gardens of the Horticul- 
 tural society, Cheswick, England, twenty-five years 
 old, ^nd that he has seen them on the continent forty 
 years old equally healthy. In the gardens of many 
 of many of the private residences in Philadelphia, 
 they may be found eight and ten years planted, bear- 
 ing delicious pears, with no sign of want of vigor, 
 but quite^the contrary. The pear on quince is less 
 liable to blight than on its own stock, and the fruit 
 of many varieties more perfect, and much improved 
 in flavor. The finest, largest and most perfect butter 
 pears we have ever seen, were grown on dwarf 
 trees. The same may be said of the Duchesse d'An- 
 gonlfeme and Louise Bonne de Jersey, two varieties 
 at least second rate on pear stocks, but of the highest 
 flavor on the quince, and standing in the first rank 
 for beauty, size and quality. They are in fact spe- 
 cially to be recommended for this mode of culture, 
 and for our own taste we should be satisfied without 
 experimenting on the four hundred other varieties 
 now known, for fear we might bo in the predicament 
 of the judge, who declined to hear the counsel for the 
 other side, saying he was entirely satisfied of the 
 merits of the case and was fearfnl if he heard more 
 he might be confused. Most persons after tasting 
 the fine buttery and juicy richness of these two pears, 
 would be satisfied and ask for nothing better. 

Certain kinds do better on quince stock than othr 
 ers, and are improved as before remarked in size, 
 flavor and productions, and others only succeed at 
 all by double working. The list of those which do 
 well, embraces some twenty-five or thirty, amply large 
 enough for the great majority of cultivators and in- 
 cluding such well known fine kinds as White and 
 Grey Doyenn^, Buerrfe Diel, Glonx Morceaax, Made-
