To sum up the advantages in faror of dwarf pears, 
 tiiey are very hardj, come into bearing often after 
 the first season of being moved, with good rich cul- 
 ture which they should always have, grow vigorously 
 and bear plentifully. They may be planted eight to 
 ten feet apart, thus taking up but little room, answer- 
 ing well to fill up the intervals in an orchard, and 
 with the present scarcity of fine pears in the markets 
 of our Atlantic cities, will probably yield, for the 
 ^ound occupied, a better return than any other kind 
 of fruit culture. Paschall Morris.

P. S. It is a very common but erroneous practice 
 to plant tender fruit, such as apricots, nectarines, &c. 
 on a warm exposure, such as the south side of a 
 house. A mild spell of weather in winter, or an ear- 
 ly spring, brings on a premature development of the 
 bud, only to be nipped by a succeeding frost. Such 
 fruit trees, and indeed all others, from the great va- 
 ;-'ableness of our climate and the liability to sudden 
 changes, should rather be planted on high ground, 
 ■where there is a free circulation of air, and if possi- 
 ble with northern exposures, so as to retard their 
 growtli. 

Notes for Septcmbsr. 

The cultivator who has been absent during previous 
 months is now the proud spectator of the fine autum- 
 nal growth of his young trees, and rich in the profu- 
 gion and variety of autumnal fruits from older ones. 

But trees lacking culture, standing in hard soil or 
 smong strong grass or weeds, make no " second 
 growth" while yonng, nor can they yield rich fruit 
 if old. 

It is now too late to urge a growth this season — 
 the late unripened shoots would be caught by frosts 
 before they would become sufiiciently woody and 
 hardened. Unseasonable luxuriance of growth is 
 one of the greatestsourcesof mischief incident to our 
 irregular climate, and a common precursor of dis- 
 ease. 

Instead, therefore, of stimulating growrti at this 
 teason, it is exceedingly desirable to bring it gradu- 
 •iy to a close. Thrifty, well-fed young trees, such 
 as the dwarf pear trees alluded to in the July No. 
 of the Journal (p. 114) may be checked with good ef- 
 fect by lifting or moving them in the ground so as to 
 dissever one-half or more of the roots, especially the 
 Tortical roots. 

Those who have not set out their Strawberry 
 PLANTS, may do so now in a bed of good sod. They 
 ■wiU become so well rooted as to be out of danger by 
 lifting or freezing out during winter and will yield a 
 partial crop of fruit next spring. In making the bed 
 it is well to estimate how many rows of plants there 

to procure just enough of the very best staminato and 
 and pistillate sorts to fill even rows of each. Thu? 
 in a bed 33 feet square there may be 20 rows and 
 20 plants in each row; and these might be arranged, 
 for example, in something like the following order. 

One row of White Bush Alpine, s. 

Four rows Hudson, p. 

One row Ross' Phoenix, s. 

Four rows Rival Hudson, p. 

One row Boston Pino, s. 

Four rows Ilovey's Seedling, p. 

One row Early Scarlet, s. 

Four rows Hovey, p. 

One row Red Bush Alpine. 

Growing trees may he pruned moderately now, as at 
 any other season of the year (popular proverbs to ths 
 contrary notwithstanding). It is well to prune a lit 
 tie at different seasons, when much is required, as 
 severe pruning at any time is always prejudicial. — 
 Occasion for it is avoided by training young trees at 
 first as they should afterwards grow. 

Old Raspberry canes which have fruited may be 
 cut away. Sometimes tlie young canes start a vigor- 
 ous tender growth afterwards; they will especially 
 need protection in November. 

Bddding is yet in season. One good rule is to 
 place the bud promptly and boldly, without any sub- 
 sequent displacement or adjusting. The tree should 
 be well set with buds according to the size of the top 
 so as to avoid necessity for cutting away many 
 branches larger than the finger. 

Instead of taking the first scions at hand, select the 
 best sort, and such as wiU yield fruit of a kind or 
 season in which the garden is deficient. A few buds 
 of a prime sort can be safely be sent in a letter to a 
 considerable distance. If there is too large a propor- 
 tion of some varieties of fruit in a garden, or if some 

t . O ' 

recs produce inferior fruit, the sooner they aw 
 changed the better, provided they are young and 
 healthy ; if they are old, they will scarcely repay the 
 trouble of grafting, and the much greater consequent 
 trouble of dressing. • W

Gen'. Hand Plums.— Dr. B. Parry, of Lancaster, 
 has laid on our table several superb plums of the 
 Gen. Hand variety. On measuring them we found 
 them to be 71 inches each in circumference and 
 weighing each one-fourth of a pound, less three 
 eighths of an ounce. Although of extraordinary size, 
 these are not as large as several taken from the tre« 
 last season, one of which measured 8J inehes. Whila 
 in point of rich melting flavor the Hand plum is infe- 
 rior to the Washington and several other varieties, it 
 undoubtedly stands at the head of the list of plums 
 in point of size, and for preserving purposes is much
