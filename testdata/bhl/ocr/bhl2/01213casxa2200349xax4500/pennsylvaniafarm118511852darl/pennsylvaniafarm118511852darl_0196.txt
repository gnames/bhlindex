Fruit stealing. 

Will some of our readers, versed in the philosophy 
 of morals, define for us the difference in criminality 
 between robbing a man's orchard and robbing his 
 house. The law, we are aware, mak^s a broad dis- 
 tinction between the two ; but this is a distinction 
 without a difference. Why the theft of a man's house- 
 hold property or money should be considered a more 
 heinous crime in the eye of the law, than the plun- 
 dering of his orchard or garden, and the mutilation 
 of his fruit trees, is beyond our comprehension. Yet 
 such is the case, and without legislation on the sub- 
 ject, such it is likely to remain. To such an extent 
 are these outrages upon the rights of fruit growers 
 practised, that there is a loud call for protection, and 
 we urge upon our farmers and fruit growers, the pro- 
 priety of laying their grievances before the legislature 
 and demanding redress. 

The complaint is general, and what renders it more 
 aggravating is the fact that many of these fruit 
 thieves are persons . loudest in their condemnation of 
 dishonest practices. We know persons who shrink 
 with holy abhorrence from the most remote imputation 
 of theft, yet who, without any scruples of conscience, 
 enter a neighbor's orchard or garden, and clandes- 
 tinely carry away his choicest fruits. We know pa- 
 rents who encourage thieving practices in their child- 
 ren, by receiving the fruit thus taken by them from 
 others without permission. And yet these same pa- 
 rents would feel highly indignant were their children 
 called thieves. They send them to sabbath schools, 
 punish them for profanity, will not permit them to as- 
 sociate with bad boys; but indirectly encourage them 
 to steal a neighbor's fruit. Strange inconsistency, 
 but no less strange than true. We cannot conceive 
 how any man or boy possessed of a single spark of 
 moral honesty, can so far forget the duty he owes his 
 conscience and society, as to rob a fruit tree. We 
 consider the man who steals his neighbor's apples or 
 peaches as much a thief, as he who picks his pocket, 
 and were we the arbitrers of justice would punish him 
 as severely. And such should be the estimate placed 
 upon this mean pilfering by the whole community. — 
 If the voice of public sentiment were raised against 
 it, and the fruit thief regarded as he should be — an 
 equal with the pickpocket and burglar — there would 
 then be some little encouragement to cultivate choice 
 fruits ; but so long as he is regarded and treated as 
 an honest man so long will our farmer's orchards be 
 be plundered and the product of years of anxious toil 
 carried away by dishonest men. 

the fact that in the vicinity of Lancaster alone, may be 
 found more than twenty choice varieties of pears, ap- 
 ples, peaches, plums and cherries, which, although 
 well known and appreciated by our citizens, have 
 never been described by Mr. D., or any other author. 
 Other sections of our State are doubtless equally rich 
 in fine seedling fruits, and it is our intention, as soon 
 as practicable, to trace their history and furnish 
 illustrations and descriptions of them. In further- 
 ance of this object, we earnestly request that those 
 who have seedling fruits will be kind enough to fur- 
 nish us with samples of them, to be placed in the 
 hands of competent persons who will decide upon 
 their merits and describe them, and the newspaper 
 press of our State will confer a special favor by no- 
 ticing our request. ^ We regret that the lateness of 
 the season as well as the general defectiveness of fruit 
 this year prevents us from entering upon this work 
 at once, with those fruits which are grown in our 
 immediate vicinity. Next season we shall commence 
 the good work in time. 

Pennsylvania Seedling Fruits. — It is universally 
 conceded that Downing's Fruits & Fruit Trees of 
 America is a work of rare merit — the best on the sub- 
 ject, and indispensable to every horticulturist — yet 
 it is far from comprehending the whole of our choice 
 fruits, and in confirmation of this opinion we refer to 

Hope's Improved Plow. 

The abov(; cut repri.^sents a plow with Hope's new 
 improvement attached. A great difficulty with plow- 
 men has always been the clogging of their plows and 
 the want of adequate means for cleaning away the 
 weeds, grass, stubble, &c. Many attempts have been 
 made to remedy this evil, but with only partial suc- 
 cess, as no improvement with which we are acquaint- 
 ed has been entirely successful in clearing away the 
 impediments to the sinkingof the plowinto the ground. 
 Mr. Hope claims for his, a complete triumph over the 
 difiiculty. Its merits were severely tested a few days 
 since on the farm of W. Dunlap, Esq., near Philadel- 
 phia, and the result was most satisfactory. Wet rye 
 straw was placed before it to the depth of six or seven 
 inches, and plowed under without the least difiiculty. 
 Reports of the trial state, that it was impossible to 
 choke it with rubbish. 

This improvement, as will be seen by a reference 
 to the engraving, is of the most simple character and 
 may be added to any of the ordinary plows now in 
 use, at a trifling expense. It consists of the recurved 
 point of the mould board, which effectually turns asid'. 
 and guides backward the choking material. We havi 
 not seen the plow in use, but hope that it may realize 
 the inventor's most sanguine expectations, as an ef- 
 fectual plow cleaner has long been a desideratum 
 with our farmers. 

Seeds should always be kept in bags, in a dry, 
 airy situation.
