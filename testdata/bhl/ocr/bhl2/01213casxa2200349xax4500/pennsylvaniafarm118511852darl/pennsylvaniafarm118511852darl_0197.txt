Horticultural Implements. 

For tho following cuts of gardening tools and the 
 accompanying description, vcc are indebted to Robert 
 Buist, Esq., nurserj'man of Philadelphia. They ap- 
 peared originally in the "Family Kitchen Gardener," 
 a work which should be in the hands of every farm- 
 er, and of which Mr. B. is the author. We know of 
 no treatise on gardening, we can more confidently re- 
 commend. The diS'erent sulijects are treated in a 
 clear, familiar style, and from the extensive practical 
 experience of the author, may be confidently relied 
 upon. 

It is not our intention to go into a detail of all the 
 useful articles connected with the culture of the gar- 
 den, which would take us beyond our limits. Our 
 object will be only to point out those most useful and 
 essential to carry on the cultivation of the soil. The 
 materials of which they are composed are chiefly of 
 iron and wood; the best quality of both should be 
 used, nothing purchased merely for its being cheap. 
 The cheapest is the best and most durable to accom- 
 plish the end. 

The spade is a very common tool, and should be of 
 steel, with a hickory or ash handle, having two rivets 
 through its head. No. 2, of the manufactory, is the 
 most convenient size. Some American spades are 
 equal to any of British manufacture. 

The Eake (Figure 1.) 
 should be of the best 
 ■wrought iron, with teeth 
 about 2J inches long and 
 Ih apart. The head is 
 of any size from six to 
 twenty inches. There 
 are also rakes of mallea- 
 ble iron, and wooden 
 rakes with steel teeth: 
 the latter sort are very 
 convenient for rou g h 
 ground. The handle should be round, made of pine, 
 or any light wood, and from six to eight feet long. 

Beet Make, (Fig. 2.) — This very useful implement 
 is composed of hard wood, with steel teeth, obtusely 
 pointed, about two inches 
 wide, five inches long, and 
 from nine to twelve inches 
 apart. It is exceedingly use- 
 ful in drawing drills in which 
 to sowBeets, Carrots, Onions, 
 ^ig- 2. and all small seeds or roots. 

jIn using it, strain the line, and draw with some 
 strength; when three drills will be made at once, 
 saving the labor of moving the line so frequently as 
 when the work is accomplished by a bore. 

Hoes are of many and 
 varied descriptions and 
 shapes. Fig. 3 gives an 
 idea of tho most useful. 
 They should be of the 
 very best of steel, with 
 rather strong, round han- 
 dles, five feet long. They 
 are in sizes from three to 
 ten inches. Those of three, five, seven and nine inches 
 are generally use"d. ' 

Pronged Hoes, Fig. 4, 
 U) are very useful, indeed 
 ' j indispensable, for stir- 
 Ij ring the soil and destroy- 
 ing weeds. They are 
 of steel or malleable iron

the latter is generally used, though tho former is pre- 
 ferable ; handles four and a half feet long. 

ffl«l The Dutch, or Sniffle 
 Hy Hoe, Fig. 5, is very use- 
 ful for cleaning walks 
 and cuttingweeds where 
 the ground is of a light 
 nature. It is also called 
 a Thrust Hoe, (being 
 used by pushing from 
 you) in contradistinction 
 to the Draw Iloe, Fig., which is best adapted for all 
 heavy work. 

The Bed and Line, Fig. 0. The 
 reel is of wood or iron ; the latter is 
 preferable. It consists of two parts, 
 the shank and head. The head 
 turns round on the shank and winds 
 up the line or cord, which can be 
 of any length. 

The Trowel, Fig. 7. is very use- 
 ful for removing plants and lifting 
 them with balls of earth for trans- 
 Fi". 6. planting. It should be of the best 

iron or steel, with a square socket into the handle. 

Fig. 7. 
 and from five to nine inches long, exclusive of the 
 handle. 

The DibhJer is a short piece of round wood, gener- 
 ally made from an old spade or shovel handle, about 
 one and a half feet long, obtusely pointed, frequently 
 shod with iron on the one end, and conveniently 
 formed for the hand on the other. It should be well 
 made, as it is of very general use, and if iron-shod, 
 will last half a century. 

Who's to blame? — What is wrong with the Phila- 
 delphia post office ? Quite a number of our city sub- 
 scribers complain that they have failed to receive 
 their Journals regularly. Now, were it not for th« 
 fact, that we have been scrupulously careful in mail- 
 ing the Journal to every subscriber, we would be 
 wiUing to believe that we were in fault ; but having 
 on several occasions mailed numbers a second and 
 even a third time, which failed to reach the persons 
 for whom they were intended, we charge the delin- 
 quency on the post master, and hope he will endeavor 
 to avoid this neglect in future. 

Strawberry Plants. — ^^Ve received on the 13th 
 ult., from Messrs. EUwanger c% Barry, of Rochester, 
 N. Y., a basket coutaining ten varieties of strawberry 
 plants, all in good condition. Our ground being rea- 
 dy, we immediately set them out, and they are now 
 looking very well. The following are the varieties : 
 EUwanger & Barry's seedling. No. 1, Bishop's orange, 
 Large early scarlet. Burr's new pine, Hovey's seed- 
 lino-, Boston pine, Genessee, Prolific hautbois. Rural, 
 Hudson. We refer our readers to Messrs. E. &, B's. 
 advertisement in another part of the Journal.
