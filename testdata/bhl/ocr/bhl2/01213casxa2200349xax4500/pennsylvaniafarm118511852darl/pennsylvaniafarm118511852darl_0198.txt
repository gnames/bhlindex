Iiancaster County Plowing Match. 

A large and highly respectable meeting of those 
 friendly to a Plowing Match, to be confined to Lan- 
 caster county plows and plowmen, was held in Lan- 
 caster on the 30th ult., Hon. A. L. Hayes, chairman, 
 A. M. Spanglor and Jacob Eshleman, Secretaries. — 
 A committoc of arrangements composed of five per- 
 sons was appointed, as follows: Jacob Frantz. Henry 
 M. Reigart, Jacob Rohrer, Christian B. Herr, and 
 Jacob Peters. An assistant committee, composed of 
 one person from each township in the county was 
 also appointed. We are compelled to omit the names 
 (rf this committee for want of space. Monday, Sep- 
 tember 29th, was the day appointed, and the imme- 
 diate vicinity of Lancaster the place for holding the 
 match. 

Daniel Hamaker, C. B. Herr and John Bachman 
 were selected as judges. The rules and regulations 
 will be nearly the same as those governing plowing 
 matches generally. 

We are pleased to see Old Lancaster at length 
 making an advance in this direction. Every effort to 
 get up a county fair this fall, failed. Such, however, 
 will not be the case with the plowing match, as the 
 premiums are very liberal and already a number of 
 competitors have announced th:!mselves ready for the 
 contest. The premiums are as follows : 

For the best plowman. $40 00 

" " second do. 30 00 

" " third do. 20 00 

" " fourth do. 10 00 

" " fifth do. 5 00 

For the best plow, 10 00 

" " 2d do. 5 00 

The warmest interest is manifested in every part 
 of the county in regard to this match, and we predict 
 that it will pave the way to a regular annual plowing 
 match and fair. At least we hope so. 

County Agricultural Fairs. 

During the months of September and October the 
 different county societies in the State hold their an- 
 nual and semi-annual exhibitions. We regret that 
 we are unable to give a complete list of these socie- 
 ties, their location, and time of holding their exhibi- 
 tions. Will not the Secretaries be kind enough to 
 keep us advised of these things? 

The State Fair will be held at Harrisburg on the 
 23d, 24th and 25th of October. 

Chester co. Ilort. Society, 11th, 12th & 13th of Sept. 

Montgomery co. 1st and 2d October. 

Bucks CO. 1st of October. 

Phila. CO. Agr. Society, 8th and 9th of October. 

Grand Plowing Match at Norristown, first Tuesday 
 of October. 

Lancaster co. Plowing Match, September 29. 

Several valuable communications have again been 
 crowded out. They will appear in our next. 

Club Sdbsceibers. — Several friends who have 
 kindly raised club lists for our Journal wish to know 
 whether we will receive additional subscricers to their 
 lists already famished, at club prices. Certainly. — 
 We shall be pleased to send the Journal to any per- 
 sons who may wish it, at our lowest club prices, if 
 their names are forwarded by any of our friends who 
 have already sent in club lists. 

The Grand Autumnal Exhibition of the Pennsylva- 
 nia Horticultural Society will be held in the Museum 
 Building, on 9th & George sts., Philadelphia, on the 
 17th, 18th and 19th days of September inst. This 
 doubtless will be one of the handsomest displays yet 
 offered to the public, great efforts are being made by 
 the committee having it in charge to that end.

The American Pomologist: containing finely colored 
 drawings, accompanied by Ictier-press descriptions 
 of Fruits of American origin. Edited W. D. 
 Brinckle, A.M., M.D. Published by A. Hoffy, 193 
 S. 7th street, Philadelphia. 1851. 

Dr. Brinckle is well known to the horticultural 
 world as an ardent cultivator and successful experi- 
 menter in the department of fruits, of which he has 
 originated some important varieties ; whilst his sound 
 judgment and general knowledge of the subject pe- 
 culiarly adapt him for the task he has undertaken. 

Mr. Hoffy is an excellent artist upon subjects of 
 this kind, and he not only makes the original paint- 
 ings from the specimens, but transfers them to stone, 
 and superintends the coloring, so that every care is 
 taken to have the illustrations accurate. 

The first number is now ready, and is a stout quar- 
 to with ten beautiful plates, colored by hand in a 
 careful and chaste style, affording an excellent repre- 
 sentation of the various subjects. These comprise 
 four varieties o{ pear, one apple, one peach, one apri- 
 cot, one cherry, and two 7-aspberrics, the last being 
 among the doctor's originals. Having recently seen 
 these growing on the editor's premises, we can vouch, 
 for them as being superior varieties in point of size 
 and flavor. 

This work is well printed upon the best paper, at 
 the low price of two dollars a number, and whilst it 
 interferes with no other work (being devoted exclu- 
 sively to the varieties which have originated in Ame- 
 rica) it has peculiar claims upon all who are desirous 
 of knowing the names and quality of our choice fruits 
 and the advanced state of their cultivation amongst 
 us ; whilst its merits as an ornamental volume must 
 secure for it a place amongst. illustrated works on 
 flowers and kindred subjects. It will be published 
 not oftener than once in three months, and four num- 
 bers will form a volume. It can be received by mail 
 without injury to the plates, as it is sent in a roll and 
 not creased by folding.
