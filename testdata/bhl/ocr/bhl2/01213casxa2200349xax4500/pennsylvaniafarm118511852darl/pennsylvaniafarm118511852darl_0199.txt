FARMERS PROTECT YOUR HOUSES & BARNS. 

So many accideiitshave happened from lightning during the past 
 Sammer, that every prudent and careful farmer should at once 
 adopt such means as will be most effectual in preventing them.— 
 When it is remembered that certain safety may be secured at a 
 very trifling expense, it becomes the duty of every farmer and 
 good citizen to avail himself the proffered means. By so doing, 
 he uot only secures his property from fire by lightning, but pro- 
 tects also his family and tho le around him. These are important 
 considerations and should have great weight. Those who desire a 
 a Lightning Rod, p'onounced by the first Scientific men in our 
 country, the very best in use, will find it on application to THOS.

 3 doors above 12th, Philadelphia. These Rods are finished with all 
 the improvements at nearly the same prices as the old kind. (tl.

MONTGOMERY'S 

UNRIVALLED IMPROVED ROCKAWAY 
 SCREENER. 

This celebrated FAN has been thoroughly tested and found to 
 excel all others now in use forcleaniiig the different kindaof grain. 

This improvement by Montgomery & Brother, consists in a dou- 
 ble shoe- the larger shoe— A as commonly attached to winnowing 
 machines, having groove's into which the screens, sieves or sieve 
 boards are slid and rest. 

B. The curved apron npon which the grain falls after passmg 
 through a hopper above. 

C. The door which is made to extend across the curved apron 
 B and opening back on hinges towards the front end of shoe A, 
 rests flat up(Mi the front part of the apron B. The grain passes 
 along the curved apron B and through the aperture of tne door C 
 and falls npon the screen D underneath. The apron is carried 
 over the screen D on to the screen uiideriiealh, whilst the screen- 
 ings puss tiirough the screen D into tne shoe G underneath, and are 
 carried along the bottom of the shoe G to the cemie, where a spout 
 H receives the screenings and carries them down behind into a 
 box below the bottom of the shoe A. The grain is carried back on 
 to the grain board underneath perfectly screened. 

The persons who have already used these GRAIN FANS have 
 not only spoken in flattering terms of them, but prefer them to all 
 others they have used— and very many of the best Agriculturists 
 have given their certificates that the fact of these machines screen- 
 ing the grain twice by one and the same operation is the very im- 
 provement they have long desired. Our farmers will now have 
 the most perfect winnowing machine, which spreads the gram 
 over the upper screen more perfectly than any others now in use. 
 This improvement is so valuable as to have induced the inventors 
 and manufacturers to make application for Letters Patent. 

All orders fur the machines will be promptly attended to by the 
 undersigned. J. MONTGOMERY St BROTHER,
