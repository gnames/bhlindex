ANALYTICAL LABORATORY, 

Yale College, New Haven, Connecticut. 
 JOHN P. NORTON, Professor of Scientific Agricultuhb. 

This Laboratory is now fully organised for instruction in all 
 branches of analyses connected with the examinution of soils, 
 manures, minerals, ashes, animal and vegetable substances, &c. — 
 Full courses are given in each of these departments, and also in 
 general Chemistry, both organic and inorganic. 

Students can tlius fit themselves to become instructors in the 
 various branches of Chemistry, or to apply so much of that and 
 kindred sciences as may be necessary to the practical pursuit of 
 agriculture or manufacturing. The demand fur teachers and pro- 
 fessors in the various branches of chemistry, cBpecially agricultu- 
 ral, is now great and increasing, so that this is a fair field Tor thoee 
 w^ho have a taste for such pursuits, 

A course of Lectures onScientific Agriculture, by Professor Nor- 
 ton, commences in January of each year, aad continues for two and 
 a half months. This course is designed especially for the practical 
 farmer, and has given great satisfaction to those who have attend- 
 ed it in previous years. It embraces a plain connected outline of 
 the leading points in improved agriculture, treating in succession 
 of the composition of the soil, the plant and the animal ; of their 
 connections with each other, and of all the improvements in culti- 
 vation, manuring, feeding, and fattening, which have been adopted 
 in the best agricultural regions This course is made so plain and 
 practical, that the farmer who attends it can understand the whole, 
 and apply it in his own experience. v 

More ean be learned by attendance upon such lectures, by read- 
 ing in connection with them, and by associating with others who 
 are also desirous of obtaining a better knowledge of their profcB- 
 sion than in years away from such advantages- The young farmer 
 learns to think for himself, to see that a practice is not necessarily 
 right because it is old, to understand the reasons for all that he 
 does, and with this increase of knowledge is better able to make 
 farming profitable as well as interesting. 

Board and lodging may be procured at from S2 to S3 per week, 
 and the Ticket for the Lectures is SlO. 

In connection with the Lectures is a short Laboratory course, by 
 means of which those who desire it, are taught to test soils, man- 
 ures, marls, &c . in a simple \vay, and to make many elementary 
 examinations of a highly useful character. The charge for this 
 course is S25. 

To those students who go through the full Laboratory course, 
 the charge is abont S200 per annum, and they can be admitted at 
 any period of the year at a proportional charge.
