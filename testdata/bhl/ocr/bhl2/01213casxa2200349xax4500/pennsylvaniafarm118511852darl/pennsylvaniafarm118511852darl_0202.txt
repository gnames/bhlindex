A CHALLENGE!!! 

THE deep interest now taken by Agriculturists in all descrtp- 
 tions of manure, would seem to justify any expedient, by 
 which fair and unprejudiced experiments may be made of the va- 
 rious descriptions of manure at this time attracting the attention 
 of the public, lu view of this, and the undersigned honestly be- 
 lieving that the (Chemical Compound, manufactured by them, ii 
 the bLst manure of which any knowledge is had for a Corn Croa; 
 challnngps Guano to the tost upon the foUowini; cnndition: — H« 
 will forfeit O'lf Hundred I>o//a?-s, to be presented to the -Vlaryland 
 Agricultural Society, if any adTocate of Guano will do the same, 
 that the Renovator compounded by Kettlewell ia. Davij^on, will 
 produce upon any soil, the largtist crop of wei-^fted corn, withoul 
 regard to the size of the stalk, provided the President of the State 
 Agricultural ;*ociety will select some person, in his jiulgment 
 qualified, to su|)erintend the experiment- The nature of the soil 
 to be (leHcribed. BO that each party can direct the mode ot appil- 
 cutittii; two barrels of the Salts to be used per iicrc, costing ^t^t 
 and 3i;0 lbs. ot the Guano, costing $7 20. the party making tb« 
 expiTinicut to receive the manure free of co.st. And the same 
 amituut agaiuKt any manure as a top dressing upon timothy or 
 olover. John Kettlkwull. 

Kettlewvll 4' Darison again call the attention of AgriculturiMw 
 to their various Chemical Manures — and in so doing, they woulU 
 be insent^ible to conimou gratitude, if they failed to express their 
 profound aekoowk-dgmenis for the constant and increasing d«- 
 maud, which Hows iu upon them for their simple and compound 
 manures. Each reason has greatly increased iheir sales, extead- 
 iug as far .south as South Carolina. 

'I'hey can give no strongei evidence of their faith in the vir- 
 tues of their manure, its the bent known for a corn crop, tlian th« 
 lenders they make above ; and the certificates which they here- 
 with present. In the offer of a test, it is not the amount involv- 
 ed, but the willingness to challenge result, that speaks their In- 
 tegrity and conlidence. We could add any amount to the testi- 
 mony we publish; but if the names we refer to. do not command 
 coulidence. no additional number could. We have never boasted 
 of the quality of our article, wo have been content to leave a de- 
 cision to time, demand and experiment, that hne been in our ft^ 
 vor— hoping, if we have less ot ■■ Bi-phosphiLtefl," the public would 
 discover it. as they would if it was found we had more of"' sand" 
 than any thing else. Kkttlewell St Davison.

BI-PHOSPHATES. 

We keep conetantly on hand this valuable manure. Booefl, 
 with a proper portion of the Sulphate of Ammonia, dissolved in 
 Sulphuric Acid. The Chemi.sta of this country and Kurope have 
 been pressing this mode of using bone-dust upon the atten- 
 tion of farmers, with great zeal and ability of recent years. Ev- 
 ery experiment has contirmed the truthfulness of their theory- 
 and we hazard hut little in saying that in a very brief time it 
 will be used in no other way. It is prepared so as to be sown sun 
 ilar to the saltB, at the rate of one or two barrels to the acre.—* 
 The price of this article is $4 per barrel. Let the farmer who 
 doubts, try it at a less expense than the old mode of using boo«- 
 dust. 

TOBACCO GENERATOR.

COMBINATION OF GROHND PLASTER AND 
 POTASH. 

This is a preparation made for soil deficient in Potash, of which 
 deficiency there is, unfortunately, too many instances in much of 
 our Maryland land. For this compound we are indebted to the 
 suggestion of an accomplished Agriculturist of Prince George's 
 county, who may at some future day present the result of his e»- 
 periment. The price of this is $2 50 per barrel. 

DIRECTIONS. 

The mode of neing the Renovator is simple, inexpensive, nnd 
 requiring but little labor. The farmer must bear in mind, thai 
 in the preparation of his soil he shares an equal responsibility in 
 testing the merits of any manure. Land negligently or badly 
 cultivated gives no manure a fair chance. How to put land in or- 
 der he ought to know better than we can teach him; and if be 
 don't know, ehould learn as speedily as possible. The land, then, 
 in order— if one barrel to the acre is used— and this quantity de- 
 pends upon the quality of the land— it should, lor grain be sown 
 broad cast, and slightly harrowed in. 

If two barrelfl are used, one as stated above, and the other aa n 
 top-drcBsing upon the wheat or rye, early in the spring at the 
 commencement of the first thaw. Upon grass it should be «o»n 
 broad-caat upon the timothy or clover. On corn, either broed- 
 OAfit or in the hill. Where two barrels are used, one each war
