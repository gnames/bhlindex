Plowing down green corn as a manure — Grasslioj]- 
 pers — Drought in Bucks count!/. 
 Mr. Editor: — ^Yours of the 10th inst., reminding 
 nie of my promise to communicate something for j^our 
 Taluable joui-nal after harvest, I received by due 
 course of mail. What I had reference to in my arti- 
 cle last spring, was principally the result of the ten 
 acres of " green corn" I had plowed down for vrheat; 
 and in fulfilment of that promiye, I now state that the 
 result is quite as good as that of last year, the yield 
 l)eing at least thirty bushels to the acre, the same as 
 the remainder of the fifty acres seeded in the usual 
 way. I am now satisfied, that where ground is in 
 good heart and lieavihj limed, two bushels of corn to 
 the acre, sowed broadcast about the 15th of June, left 
 o-row until well out in tassel, and then thoroughly 
 plowed under, will produce the same beneficial result 
 as the usual amount of manure upon the same ground. 
 This remark not only applies to the wheat crop, but 
 to the grass afterwards. 

Believing that I have this year manure sufficient 
 for all purposes, and having no field that I could con- 
 veniently spare, I did not sow any corn broadcast. — 
 I am now sorry that I did not do so, for if I had not 
 used it for plowing under, it would have answered a 
 valuable purpose for feeding my cattle this dry sea- 
 son. I shall not willingly let any year again pass 
 without pursuing my favorite plan. 

This has been a very dry season in this portion of 
 Bucks county, and the result will be light crops of 
 corn and potatoes. The early part of the spring was 
 cold and wet, and farmers were backward in getting 
 in their corn, and in many cases when got in, the 
 ground was too wet. I have about forty acres in 
 com, nearly all heavily manured ; but the result will 
 be little more than one-half of what I anticipated, 
 though my corn looks quite as well as that of my 
 neighbors. About twenty-five acres of the above is 
 meadow land. This portion was plowed late last fiiU 
 about ten inches deep, and the manure turned under 
 at the time. In the spring, so wet was the ground, 
 that notwithstanding all my expense at draining, I 
 was compelled to open large ditches to convey away 
 the standing water, before I could enter upon it for 
 cultivation. When it became sufficiently dry, I plow- 
 ed the whole again about five inches deep, harrowed 
 and rolled it, and planted the corn about the middle 
 of May. The season soon after became dry, the corn 
 grew badly, and for a while I thought it would come 
 to nothing. A few genial showers, however, gave it 
 a start; and I think I may safely say the yield will 
 be at least fifty bushels to the acre, while the upland 
 equally well manured and better cultivated, will not 
 produce half that amount. As I passed through Lan- 
 caster county the latter part of June, I could not but 
 contrast the appearance of the corn there growing, 
 with that of Bucks. While that in your county was 

three and four feet high, much of ours was little more 
 than a foot above the ground. Indeed, in some cases 
 in this county the corn was not planted until early in 
 June. The present month, thus far, has been unusu- 
 ally warm, and we have had several refreshing rains 
 which will help on the late corn, if not overtaken too 
 soon with frost. 

In addition to the drought of the season we liave 
 been visited in many sections of our county with my- 
 riads of Grasshoppers. The destruction caused by 
 them was almost equal to that of the " Locusts of 
 Egypt." Where the drought had not destroyed the 
 pastures entirely, the balance was eaten by the grass- 
 hoppers, and this to such an extent that many of the 
 fields looked as if they had been burned. After de- 
 stroying the pastures, they attacked the fields of buck- 
 wheat and corn. They eat up, for me, two acres of 
 buckwheat, and parts of my corn fields look as if a 
 hail storm had passed through them. After cutting 
 the tender part of the blade, they likewise eat up the 
 silk and upper part of tlie ear, and in some cases cut 
 holes in the husk aud destroy the grain on one side 
 of the ear. About sunset you might find the fences 
 and bodies of trees covered with them — their nightly 
 resort for repose. About ten days since they com- 
 menced leaving us, many going off in clouds in a 
 southerly direction. We have now but few remain- 
 ing. I should like to know whether the grasshopper 
 of the present year is the same as those we annually 
 meet with, for the destruction caused by them ap- 
 pears unprecedented. Probably your intelligent Phi- 
 ladelphia correspondent, who has given much atten- 
 tion to insects, would enlighten your readers upon 
 this subject. 

To give you a proper idea of what some farmers 
 have suffered from the two causes above referred to, 
 I may here remark, that during the early part of the 
 season, I hauled out my barn-yard manure and spread 
 it upon a twenty-five acre field, well set with clover, 
 intending to make open fallow for wheat. But so 
 completely have my pastures been ruined, I was com- 
 pelled to keep this field for my cattle, and to cut off 
 a patch of corn fodder and feed to them in addition 
 thereto. The top-dressing of manure kept the ground 
 moist, and for several weeks this field was my main 
 dependence for pasture for forty head of cattle. For 
 some reason there were but few grasshoppers in this 
 field. The clover in my oat stuble failed, and I am 
 now plowing it up for wheat without manuring, to 
 take the place of the field retained for pasture. You 
 need not, therefore, next year expect to hear of any 
 large crop of wheat on my farm.
