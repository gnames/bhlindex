neously extinguished, aud it will scarcely combine 
 with any other substance. Atmospheric air consists 
 principally of nitrogen : it forms four-fifths of the air 
 ■vre breathe, but mixed vs-ith oxygen, ■whereliy its pow- 
 er and effects are modified. Nitrogen is a principal 
 constituent of both vegetable and animal bodies ; but 
 as it cannot be inhaled in its purity, it is introduced 
 therein by various processes, as will be seen hereaf- 
 ter. Nitrogen is specifically somewhat lighter than 
 atmospheric air, from which it may re.adily be ob- 
 tained, by placing on a piece of cork floating on the 
 water in the pneumatic trough, a small porcelain cup 
 containing a little cotton moistened with alcohol (fig.

it and the containing cup, a glass jar or receiver with 
 its edges immersed in the water, the oxygen of the 
 air will be consumed and during the combustion, the 
 volume of air will be diminished whilst the water 
 will rise in the jar and occupy about one-third of it. 
 When all the oxygen has thus been consumed, what 
 remains in the jar is nitrogen. Purer nitrogen, how- 
 ever is procured by conducting chlorine gas through 
 a solution of ammonia in water. The apparatus 
 shown hyfiff. 5, is used for this purpose. Chlorine 

gas is evolved in the flask, from a mixture of two 
 jjarts hydrochloric or muriatic acid and one part 
 powdered peroxid of manganese, by the application of 
 heat, and is conducted through a bent glass tube into 
 a glass jar or reservoir containing the aqueous solu- 
 tion of ammonia. The resulting nitrogen passes ofl' 
 through another glass tube provided for it, and is col- 
 lected in a suitable receiver in the pneumatic trough. 
 It is a fixed gas which has not hitherto been reduced 
 to a liquid form by pressure, on the application of 
 artificial cold. It is specifically lighter than air, and 
 is not chemically combined with the oxygen of the 
 atmosphere. 

Hijdroyen is a gaseous element, capable of combin- 

ing very intimately with oxygen, in which state it is 
 no longer triform, but constitutes water. Hydrogen 
 possesses the property of uniting chemically with oxy- 
 gen. It is much lighter than common air, and rises 
 up in it. It is readily procured by the decompositio)i 
 of water (which contains it in the greatest abund- 
 ance,) by means of the galvanic pyle. This is effect- 
 ed by acidulating water with a few drops of sulphuric 
 acid, and introducing it into the funnel of the appa- 
 ratus, /?(/. G. If now, the two wires lie connected with , 

the two poles of the biittery, the water will be sepa- 
 rated into its elements — forming two volumes of hy- 
 drogen and one volume of oxygen. The most simple 
 apparatus for the production of hydrogen is repre- 
 sented mflg- ". A quantity of iron or zinc, in small 

pieces or fragments, is put into the flask, which i> 
 then closed tight by a cork through which is inserted 
 a funnel-topped glass-tube for the introduction of 
 sulphuric acid, and another straight tube for the es- 
 cape of the gas evol"ed. The diluted acid is poured 
 in through the funnel, and the gas is conveyed by 
 the other tube to the receiver standing in the pneu- 
 matic trough. Numerous bubbles are immediately 
 evolved, on the introduction of the acid. After the 
 process has continued a few minutes, a small quan- 
 tity of gas is passed into a vial Jto test its quality by 
 combustion. If it bum steadily, without explosion, 
 the gas is pure. 

Carbon is a solid combustible element, having the 
 property of uniting readily with oxygen, thus passing 
 into a gaseous state and forming a substanca of very
