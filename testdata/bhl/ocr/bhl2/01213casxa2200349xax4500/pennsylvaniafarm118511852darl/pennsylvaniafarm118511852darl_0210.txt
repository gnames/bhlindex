taking up from the atmosphere, even when not burn- 
 ing, — and it is luminous in the dark. Phosphorus 
 is prepared in largo quantities from burnt bones, 
 which contain it in the phosphate of lirao. The 
 bones are first boiled to remove the gelatine, and arc 
 then calcined until they become quite white. After 
 being pulverized, they are digested in dilute sulphu- 
 ric acid. After standing a day or two, the clear li- 
 quid is decanted from the sediment, or passed through 
 a filter to free it from the insoluble sulphate of lime, 
 resulting from the action of the oil of vitriol on the 
 bones. It is next evaporated to the consistence of 
 syrup, mixed with pulverized charcoal, and dried. — 
 The dry mass is then introduced into a stoneware 
 retort, the neck of which is connected with a wide 
 cojlper tube {f(j. 11.). This tube passes through a 

Fig. u. 

cork into a glass receiver containing water enough to 
 cover the open end of the tube. A smaller tube, also 
 passed through the cork, conducts off the useless 
 gases evolved. The retort being placed in a furnace 
 is very gradually In-ought to a red heat. Gas alone 
 is evolved at first, but is soon succeeded by vapor 
 ■which becomes condensed in the wide tube down 
 which it flows into the receiver as phosphorus. The 
 operation requires great care, as there is always dan- 
 ger of failure from the breaking of the retort. Phos- 
 phorus is never found free in nature, though it is a 
 substance of the utmost importance in the cultivation 
 of cereal crops, as without its presence the grains 
 cannot be perfectly formed. It exists ki some com- 
 bination in almost all plants ; and is found, as phos- 
 phate of lime, in the bones of animals. It is insolu- 
 ble in pure water, but readily soluble in alcohol or 
 oil; and its solutions have the smell and taste of 
 garlic. 

4) Silicon. This is a substance as yet very imper- 
 fectly known, though of great importance to the far- 
 mer, being the chief constituent of silicious earth and 
 of pure sand. As it does not occur pure in nature, 
 it is rarely seen even by chemists ; and the prepara- 
 tion of it is a difficult process. In nature, it is found 
 only in combination with oxygen, or silica, and is one 
 of the most abundant as well as most important sub- 
 stances known, constituting probably one-sixth part 

of the entire crust of the globe. To obtain silicon in 
 its pure state, the double fluorid of silicon and potas- 
 sium is mixed with the metal potassium cut into small 
 pieces, and the mixture is heated over a spirit lamp 
 in a glass test tube. As soon as the bottom is heated 
 to redness a lively ignition ensues and pervades the 
 entire mass. When cooled, after the ignition has 
 subsided, the residuum is treated with water, which 
 dissolves the fluorid of potassium, and the pure sili- 
 con remains. The silicon thus obtained is a dark 
 brown powder, without metallic lustre, and is a fee- 
 ble conductor of electricity. 

In combination with oxygen, as silicious eartli, it 
 constitutes the principal part of most minerals and 
 soils, and is found among the incombustilile elements 
 of plants, some of which — the reeds and grasses — 
 have a thick crust of it deposited in their bark or 
 outer coat. It occurs also, though in remarkably 
 small quantity, in the bodies of animals, particularly 
 in the bones; and it is found in almost all spring 
 water. In combination with alumina and oxid of 
 iron, it forms clay; but does not become plastic by an 
 admixture of water alone. 

The grasses and cultivated grains require large 
 supplies of silicious earth, and it is therefore essential 
 not only that that the soil contain it, but that it be 
 found there in a state readily soluble in water, cfr as 
 a hydrate. Many soils, however, contain it in such 
 superabundance, in this state of solubility, as to be 
 sterile mainly from this cause — the plants receiving 
 greatly more silicious earth than they can assimilate. 
 But some soils, also, contain less silicious than is re- 
 quired by them, to be productive ; as is shown by the 
 chalk lands of England, vfhich are speedily improved 
 and Ijecome fertile on receiving a dressing of sand — 
 the cultivated plants, particularly the cereal grains, 
 being thus enabled to supply themselves with the re- 
 quisite proportion of silicious earth. ■ Elm, pine, and 
 birch trees thrive in sandy soils, because they require 
 much silicious earth for their growth. 

Potato Rot.— While our neighbors of Now York, 
 Massachusetts, and other States are complaining of 
 the extensive prevalence of the potato rot, thus far, 
 we have heard no complaint from any portion of our 
 own State. In our own immediate vicinity, the early 
 potatoes were never finer. How the later ones will 
 turn out, remains to be seen, though from present 
 appearances, we do not anticipate the prevalence of 
 the rot to any serious extent. 

Nothing sits so gracefiilly upon children and 
 makes them so lovely, as habitual respect and dutiful 
 deportment towards their parents and their superiors.
