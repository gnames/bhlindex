Spring Wheat. 

This grain is already very important to large farm- 
 ing districts in Pennsylvania and may most profitably 
 be cultivated in many parts of the State where winter 
 wheat in a great measure fails. The objections urged 
 against it generally, are three. 1. That it is inferior 
 in quality. 2. That it is liable to smut; and 3. That 
 it is an uncertain crop owing to its being so frequent- 
 ly blighted and shrunk by mildew. But from an ex- 
 perience and examinations of seven years I am con- 
 vinced that these objections are not well grounded. 
 As in all crops, the quality depends much upon culti- 
 vation. With good cultivation the Italian wheat 
 weighs sixty to sixty-two pounds and yields forty to 
 forty-three pounds of superfine flour to the bushel. — 
 The flour, although not quite as white, makes as good 
 bread as any winter wheat. It has usually a slight 
 yellowish tinge. If wheat were not too much judged 
 of by the whiteness of its flour, I doubt not that good 
 Italian wheat would soon rank as high in the market 
 as Mediterranean winter wheat. 

The second objection is entirely obviated by a pro- 
 per preparation of the seed. I have had no smut for 
 many years except where I have sown wheat without 
 washing and liming. My process is to wash my 
 wheat thoroughly in strong lime, which raises to the 
 surface, all oats and other light seeds, which are 
 skimmed off. While wet it is thrown upon the barn 
 floor and finely" pulverised quick lime in small 
 quantities is sifted over it. The whole is so mixed 
 that every kernel is coated with lime. It may 
 safely be left in this way for several days before sow- 
 ing. If sown immediately, the lime is unpleasant to 
 the hand, and to prevent its injuring the sower a 
 small quantity of gypsum is scattered over it. No 
 smut is ever found in spring wheat prepared in this 
 manner. The salt, lime and gypsum are all admira- 
 ble manures. 

The third objection is obviated by early sowing. — 
 In large districts in the northern part of the State it 
 is difficult to plow early. The soil is a heavy clay 
 and loam and retains the water very long. It is ab- 
 solute ruin to the crop to plow while wet, and conse- 
 quently the farmer who relies upon spring plowing 
 for his wheat will be unable to sow before the last of 
 April or the first of May — a month too late here. — 
 The plowing must be done in the fall and the sowing 
 at the earliest practicaljle day after the frost is out 
 of the ground. The best spring wheat in quantity 
 and quality, which I have ever known raised, was 
 upon a green sward, which had been turned under 
 late in November and upon which the wheat was sown 
 without further plowing, the latter days of March. — 
 A very light dragging lengthwise of the furrow, be- 
 fore sowing and the wheat lightly was dragged in so 
 as not to raise the sod. Sown in this way it will be fit 
 to harvest the latter part of July. Wheat which 
 ripens in July is seldom affected by mildew. Two 
 bushels of seed should be sown per acre. 

I have tried the Baltic wheat, which is said to be 

successfully cultivated in Vermont, but it is greatly 

inferior in quality as well as quantity to the Italian.

Education of Farmers' Daughters. 
 No. 2. 

Mr. Spangler: — Agreeably to promise, I offer a 
 few more suggestions in regard to the education of 
 farmers daughters, believing, as I before asserted, 
 that the columns of your valuable Journal should not 
 be entirely monopolised by the " lords of creation." 

The very prevalent but erroneous idea, that woman 
 is mentally inferior to man, has exercised a powerful 
 influence upon the mind of the farmer in regard to 
 the education of his daughters. Many parents con- 
 ceive their daughters fit only to become familiar with 
 household duties — to spin, sew, knit, understand cu- 
 linary operations, and attend to household affairs 
 generally. All these duties should be thoroughly 
 understood, and the parents who' neglect instructing 
 them in these important departments, are scarcely 
 less remiss than those who neglect the cultivation of 
 their intellects. Fortunately, however, this perni- 
 cious error is fast dying away. The school house 
 and newspaper are shedding abroad through the land 
 their genial influences, and fast dispelling the clouds- 
 that have hitherto intervened between the minds of 
 many persons and the education of their children. 

Speaking of woman's natural inferiority, recalls- 
 school-boy associations. How often have we seen 
 boys made to blush at their own ignorance- in the re- 
 citation room, as the girls at their side would pp&mpt- 
 ly answer the questions which had sorely piszzlod 
 them. And yet, when arrived at a suitable age, the 
 boys are sent away to academies, boarding sciwols 
 and colleges, while the girls, according to long estab- 
 lished custom, have their places assigned them ia the 
 kitchen, to perform the drudgery there. JUavr is oot 
 this morally wrong. To say nothing of the partiality 
 shown the boys, is it not a pernicious error, io endea- 
 vor to impress upon the minds of the future mothers 
 and heads of families that their sex is unfit for any 
 other duties than those which ill advised ecoBiomy has 
 for centuries assigned them. You, Mr. Edtor, should 
 give the aid of your pen in behalf of the enaaEcipation 
 of our farmers' girls from the cruel and unjust servi- 
 tude to which they are subjected. Bat londerstaQd 
 me, I do not by this mean that our girls should not 
 be taught to work, or that they should have a fash- 
 ionable boarding school education — \» taught to de- 
 spise honest industry — to prefer croch^ work to the 
 knitting of good warm hose for thems^es and fath- 
 ers and brothers — to thump fashionably \ipon a guitar 
 or piano, and not know how to cook a pot-tto or fry 
 a beefsteak. I would have them instructed in all use- 
 ful branches which would fit them, when done with 
 their household dutie3, to sit iji the parlor and con •
