verse intelligently. I would have them familiar with 
 liistory and geography, and thoroughly versed in 
 grammar, and where time and opportunity allowed 
 it, the more elegant branches should be taught them. 
 This would fit them to lay the foundation for the 
 education of their own children, independent of the 
 schoolmaster. Who will pretend to estimate the im- 
 mense change that would be wrought in the intelli- 
 gence of coming generations, if the mothers that are 
 to be, were educated sufficiently well to enable them 
 to impart the rudiments of all the important branches 
 of education, before placing them under the care of 
 teachers, who, unfortunately, are too frequently betr 
 ter qualified to dig than train youthful intellects. — 
 How greatly would it enhance the respect which 
 children entertain for parents, if they found in them 
 competent instructors, ready and willing to assist 
 them in their studies and give them the information 
 they generally are unable to procure from country 
 schoolmasters. What more enchanting sight than 
 that of an intelligent mother laying the foundation 
 of a son or daughter's future intellectual development. 
 How kind and patient her teachings. Understanding 
 fully the temperament and abilities of her child she 
 adapts her system of teaching accordingly and the 
 consequence is, they pursue their stjidies more cheer- 
 fully and understandingly.

the base, smooth on both sides, with the edges cut 
 into rounded teeth. The heads of the flowers are 
 from one to two inches in diameter and but one on a 
 branch, the rays of the flower are white, and in length 
 about equal to the yellow central part. The leaves 
 around the head (involucre) has rusty brown mar- 
 gins, and the seeds are smooth and of a dark purple 
 color. 

This plant somewhat resembles the " feverfew," 
 and the " garden chrysanthemum," but is readily 
 distinguished by its large flowers, and very white 
 rays. Its annual roots, and hardy nature, make it 
 difiioult to eradicate. It produces seeds in great pro- 
 fusion, and if permitted, soon takes possession of a 
 farm to the exclusion of important plants. I believe 
 it is utterly worthless, though I have seen some cows 
 occasionally crop it. It has been asserted that it im- 
 proves the quality of butter, but I am assured that 
 this is a mistake. 

It is very abundant in the upper end of Bald Eagle 
 valley, and is rapidly extending itself Annual 
 cropping and plowing appears to be the most efiectual 
 method of destroying it that I am acquainted with, 
 ))ut even by this means the whole community muet 
 co-operate, and vigilantly destroy every vestige of it, 
 for it is almost useless for one farmer to contend 
 against it, if his neighbor's field constantly furnishes 
 seeds for new plants. J. M. M'Minn.

It is a true Leucanthemum, a genus established by 
 Turneforte. The name is derived from the Greek 
 Leuhos, white, and Anthemon a flower in reference 
 to its white rays. The genus contains twenty-two 
 species. But three are found in North America, two 
 of these are natives of Arctic America, and the third 
 is the plant under consideration, which is a native 
 of Europe, but which has become extensively natu- 
 ralized, and is a vile weed, wherever it is found. 

It belongs to the 19th class, Syngenesia, and the 
 1st order yEqualis, in the Artificial System of Lin- 
 nseus — to order Compositas and tribe Senecioranidea 
 <if De Candille and to subtribe Anthemidie in Torrey 
 and Gray's Flora of North America. 

The root lives for many years, and seeds up many 
 stems every year. 

The stem grows from one to two feet high, mostly 
 simple, but sometimes branched ; it is marked with 
 lines that are purplish and somewhat hairy. The 
 leaves are one or two inches long and one-third to 
 two-thirds of an inch wide, wedge shaped tapering to 

The Potato Rot and a Remedj'. 

To the farmers of Pennsylvania I would say, the 
 potato disease is not a worn out subject. It is again 
 in our midst, and still invites inquiry, and with us it 
 is likely to remain so long as a certain winged insect 
 continues to infest the plants. The season being so 
 for advanced, I will reserve a description of this de- 
 structive insect for a future communication. Yet if 
 in the meantime, any of my fellow farmers feel in- 
 credulous upon the subject, and are desirous of hav- 
 ing a sight of the pest, they can be gr.atified by call- 
 ing, within twenty days, at Pleasant Mount, Wayne 
 county, and visiting, with me, the potato fields of this 
 region, from eight to ten o'clock in the morning, or 
 from five to seven o'clock in the evening of any clear 
 day. I will show them their mode of attacking the 
 vines — how their poison comes in contact with the atr 
 mosphere, and in conjunction with it, impregnates the 
 sap, carrying disease and death with it. Wherever 
 there is a change of atmosphere, from genial warmth 
 to cold or chilly weather; with the return of the warm 
 weather, we have certain evidence that the destroyer 
 passed in and out during the change. 

A certain remedy against the potato rot will, I fully 
 believe, be found in the foUovring mixture sprinkled 
 or dusted upon the vines, commencing, for early po- 
 tatoes, three weeks after they appear upon the ground, 
 and for later ones, two weeks, or when the stalks are 
 about sLs inches in height. This dusting is to be
