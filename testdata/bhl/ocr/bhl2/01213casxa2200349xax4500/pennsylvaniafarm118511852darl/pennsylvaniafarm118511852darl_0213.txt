continued at least twice a week, until the potatoes 
 are matured, and always on the first clear or moder- 
 ate dajj after a rain. 

My mode of cultivation is this. After having 
 plowed my ground at least ten inches deep, I plant 
 the potatoes three inches deep, covering them imme- 
 diately with thoroughly pulverised earth. I never 
 manure in the hill unless it is to drop half a gill of 
 air slacked lime on the potatoes in each hill. If the 
 soil is a stiff clay, or rests on a hard pan, then it 
 should always be subsoiled to the depth of fourteen 
 inches or more, and if turf, the slice should be turn- 
 ed six inches thick, and the subsoil stirred to the 
 depth of eight to ten inches more. Harrow well with 
 a double hinge harrow, planting on the surface or 
 making a broad shallow hole with the hoe, and be 
 careful not to cut through the turf. 

The mixture to which I have referred above, is as 
 follows: Two pounds of Scotch snuff or finely ground 
 tobacco ; two quarts of lake or Nova Scotia plaster, 
 eight quarts of fine sifted, air slaked lime, mix these 
 ingredients well. Procure a stone jar that will con- 
 tain four gallons, into which place a large handful 
 of green tansey leaves, and on the top of the tansey 
 place the above mixture. Cover the jar and let it 
 stand for one or more days. The mixture will then 
 be ready to be dusted over the vines, which may be 
 done by procuring a tin vessel with the bottom per- 
 forated like a flour duster or popper box. Continue 
 tlie dusting twice a week, until the potatoes are tho- 
 roughly ripened. Where this plan is pursued, no 
 ]X)tato rot will be found.

 [We give the above a place in our columns, not be- 
 cause we have much faith in its eificacy as a remedy 
 for the potato rot, but because wc feel desirous of 
 liearing all that can be said on the subject, hoping 
 that finally, we shall arrive at the true cause of the 
 disease. — Ed.] 

Statements of yields. 
 Mr. Editor: — Permit me to suggest to your con- 
 sideration, the propriety of devoting a considerable 
 department of your Journal to statements of common 
 yields from improved soils — their condition when 
 first tenanted by their proprietors — by what process 
 ' >f cultivation they have been improved, &c. Articles 
 i>f this character would have a tendency to stimulate 
 the readers of your Journal to active exertion, and 
 prompt them to efforts for increased improvements in 
 every department of farming. Such statements would 
 also increase the number of your readers, as well as 
 the popularity and patronage of your journal. 

The almost invariable result of publishing accounts 
 uf very extraordinary yields and their expensive cost 
 of attainment, by wealthy farmers, or merchants, 
 lawyers or other professional men, being entirely be- 

yond the reach of the great mass of farmers, are read 
 — merely read and admired, perhaps spoken of; but 
 the experiment of attempting similar results by the 
 same means is rarely undertaken. The desired ef- 
 fect is thus lost, and the consequence is, a deep-root- 
 ed prejudice on the part of farmers of moderate 
 means against all " book farming." My idea of a 
 Pennsylvania Farm Journal is, that it should be con- 
 ducted on principles that will have a tendency to 
 draw out the knowledge of the common farmer, and 
 furnish him with a medium through which to publish 
 the same. 

The adoption of such a course would render it an 
 interesting and valuable monthly visitor to every far- 
 mer's fireside, however humble his means, and would 
 also naturally increase its popularity. The leading 
 characteristic of nearly all the agricultural papers 
 published in the United States is, a disposition to 
 portray in their most glowing colors, the experiments 
 of men whose wealth enables them to spend more 
 for the success ef a single experiment, than the en- 
 tire amount of many small farmer's yearly income. 
 They do not sufiiciently consult the interests of the 
 great mass of farmers, and consequently much of the 
 good they might effect, is lost. This will account for 
 the comparative scarcity of agricultural papers. The 
 great question with the conductor of an agricultural 
 periodical should be, what course shall we adopt to 
 induce the mass of farmers to enter the field and give 
 us the valuable results of their observation and ex- 
 perience? I would answer this query by saying to 
 you, adapt your journal to the tastes and capacities 
 of the great majority of our farmers — those of mod- 
 erate means — invite them to write for the Journal 
 and let them know while doing so, that others of 
 their class are doing the same. By this means, 
 the vast amount of valuable practical experience and 
 observation which is now confined to the family cir- 
 cle, or small neighborhoods, will find its way to every 
 farm house and prove a source of inestimable benefit 
 to our agricultural interests. 

If the few plain suggestions I have offered, be worth 
 an insertion in your journal, I shall feel gratified. — 
 If they are not, throw tliem aside, and I shall not be 
 displeased. I fervently desire the perpetuation of the 
 Farm Journal, and do all in my power to sustain it, 
 and it is only with the hope of aiding in establishing 
 it beyond the contingency of a doubt, that I write 
 you this. 

I do not wish you to infer from what I have writ- 
 ten that I object to the publication of the results of 
 extensive and costly experiments. I do not. My 
 object is, not to exclude them, but to pave the way 
 for the publication of such statements as are calcu- 
 lated to benefit the every day farmer also. Let them 
 go hand in hand, only give the small farmer a chance 
 of being heard also. 
 I purpose communicating to you several statements
