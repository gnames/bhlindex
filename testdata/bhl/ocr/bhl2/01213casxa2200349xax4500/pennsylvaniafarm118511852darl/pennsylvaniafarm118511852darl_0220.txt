inches of fine sand, turn the whole two or three times 
 the succeeding summer, still covering, when turned, 
 with fine sand, and in the succeeding spring, sift the 
 sand from the seed, and having a seed bed in high 
 tilth and very fertile, spread the seeds evenly over 
 the l)ed, sift quarter of an inch of sand or loose earth 
 on them and protect the bed from the sun, except 
 early morn and near evening, by making a light 
 scaffold over the bed a foot high and covering the 
 scaffold with branches of trees or straw. "Weed dur- 
 ing the summer and give water in very dry seasons. 
 The quicks may be planted out at one or two years old; 
 but the ground in which they are to be planted should 
 have a yea»'s preparation, made perfectly clear of 
 weeds and grass, very fertile and well plowed or dug 
 over several times in the season. Some species of 
 thorns have small berries about the size of a grain 
 of allspice, the seeds of which will generally come up 
 the first year, and may be planted the spring after 
 they were gathered. 

The Osage orange or Marhira aurayiUaca, a native 
 of the southwestern States, has been spoken highly 
 of as a plant for hedging, and many plants are now 
 raised for that purpose. Although a southern tree, 
 it is hardy with us, and is sufficiently stiff and thorny 
 to prevent horses or cattle from breaking through. — 
 It produces seed abundantly wlion staminate and 
 pistillate plants are planted in the neighborhood of 
 each other, but I fear it will be difficult to restrain it 
 ■within hedging bounds. I have a tree that was 
 planted about twenty or twenty-five years ago, which 
 is now one foot in diameter and twenty-five feet high, 
 and its yellow, mulberry lik'! roots, extend probably 
 twenty-five feet from the bottom of the tree. Some 
 care is taken so to trim it, as to render the trunk .ap- 
 ■ proachable, but shoots from the trunk frequently 
 come out and grow sis to eight feet in a single sea- 
 son. I have some hope that by a different mode of 
 tre*tmont in trimming, and 1)y planting wider apart 

say thre» feet or thereabout — they may form good 

hedges. It will require much experience to deter- 
 mine the best mode of treatment, and will require the 
 roots to be cut or a ditch kept on each side to prevent 
 them from affecting the productiveness of the adjoin- 
 ing laud. Seed will, ere long, bo abundant, and 1 
 believe may now be obtained in the winter or spring 
 at the seed stores. The seeds are large, and may be 
 sown in the spring. They come up soon. 

The iloNEV Locust or Glediischia triacanthns is a 
 hardy tree, not less thorny than the Osage orange, 
 and growing to a large size. I have seen some at- 
 tempt to form a hedge of this tree ; but with appa- 
 rently much neglect. It made a hedge used 
 for many years as an enclosure ; but showing 
 occasionally a gap mended with a fence rail. The 
 result of the experiment was more favorable than I 
 should hivve anticipated. The plants are easily raised 
 and the seed large and abundant. 

There is another class of small trees of which I 
 have some hope that they may be so reduced as to do 
 service as hedge plants, as the stems and branches 
 are stiff and unyielding and the terminal buds and 
 spurs partake somewhat of the form and nature of 
 thorns. In this class are the Buckthorn or Rham- 
 nus cathartkus, the buffalo berrj' or SheplienUa argcn- 
 iea, the sheep berry or Vihurnum prunifoUum, tlic 
 red plum and sloe or Pi-unus amerkana and Spinosa. 
 Of the Buckthorn I have seen one hedge at the Bar- 
 tram farm, planted, as I suppose, by .John Bartram, 
 the elder, but at the time I saw it, it was permitted 
 to grow wild, and was not kept as an hedge or fence. 
 It appeared as though it could be made effective. It 
 is now very much vaunted as an hedge plant by wri- 
 ters in the Northern States and in the nursery cata- 
 logues it is marked ten dollars the thousand. The 
 Buckthorn and all the others of this class are small 
 trees and may tlierefore be permitted to grow vigor- 
 ously without nmtil.ation. Whilst I propose to re- 
 sume this subject hereafter, I desire that those who 
 have given attention to the raising of hedges and 
 h.ave succeeded well, will give us the result of their 
 experience through the Farm Journal.

Hon' to cultivate fine Cauliflowers. 

Mr Spangler: — In compliance with your wish, I 
 send you a brief account of the cauliflowers, you no- 
 ticed so favorably in a former number of the Farm 
 .Journal. The seed (which was of superior quality, 
 I procured of Thomas F. Croft, seedsman, Philadel- 
 phia,) was sown about the middle of September, in 
 an open border. When of the proper size I trans- 
 planted them into a cold frame, in which they were 
 kept until the first of -January, at which time they 
 were transplanted into a hot-bed previously prepared 
 as follows; Leaves two feet deep, covered with very 
 rich compost to the depth of sixteen or eighteen inch- 
 es. They were kept dry during the winter, but when 
 they began to grow, plenty of water was given tliem, 
 particularly when about heading. As much light 
 and air was given them as the weather would permit.

[The cauliflowers above referred_to, we noticed in 
 the proceedings of the Penna. Horticultural Society, 
 as well as editorially in the June No. of the Journal. 
 They were certainly the most superb ones we ever 
 saw, and Mr. Riley will accept our thanks for ena- 
 bling us to lay before our readers his mode of treat- 
 ment. It is simple, and within the reach of every 
 one who desires an early supply of this favorite vege 
 table.— Ed.] 

Early Nonpareil cabbage is one of the best sorts 
 in cultivation. It heads freely, rnd is of a good size, 
 and very delicate flavor.
