Milk and its management. 

f- Here are some wholesome suggestions in regard to 
 milliing and the management of milk, in the dairy, 
 which we condense from an English work on the sub- 
 ject. 

The operation of milking should be performed gen- 
 tly, not harshly. If harshly performed it becomes 
 painful to the cow, who not unfrequently brings into 
 action her faculty of retaining her milk at pleasure. 
 AVhen gently performed, milking generally gives 
 pleasure to the cow. Many instances are recorded 
 where cows which would not let down a single drop 
 of milk to one dairy maid, would let it flow in abun- 
 dance whenever another approached them. 

Cows that are ticklish or skittish should always be 
 treated with the utmost gentleness, and when the ud- 
 der is hard and painful, it should be tenderly foment- 
 ed with luke-warm water and softly rulibed. Such 
 treatment will bring the cow into good temper, and 
 induce her to yield her milk freely. 

Whenever a cow's teats becomes scratched or 
 wounded, so as to produce foul milk, such milk should 
 on no account be mixed with the sweet milk, but be 
 given to the pigs without being carried to the milk 
 house, lest its presence there should taint the atmo- 
 sphere and prove injurious to the other milk. 

It is well to comb and curry cows as it promotes 
 cleanliness. The fact is, where clean milk is an ob- 
 ject, the comb and brush, together with the thorough 
 washing of the udder are indispensable. 

Snuff-takers and slovens should never be permitted 
 to assist about the dairy, nor should the milkers be 
 permitted to enter it with a dirty apron covered with 
 hairs from the cow house. 

1. Of the milk from any cow at one time, that part 
 which comes off the first is always thinner, and of a 
 much worse quality for making butter, than that af- 
 terwards obtained; and this richness continues to in- 
 crease progressively to the very last drop that can be 
 obtained. 

2. If milk be put into a dish, and allowed to stand 
 till "it throws up cream, the portion of cream rising 
 first to the surface is richer in quality, and greater in 
 quantity, than that which rises in a second equal 
 space of time; and the cream which rises in the se- 
 cond interval of time is greater in quantity, and rich- 
 er in quality than that which rises in a third equal 
 space of time; that of the third is greater than that 
 of the fourth, and so of the rest ; the cream that rises 
 continuing progressively to decrease in quantity, 
 and to decline in quantity, so long as any rises to the 
 surface. 

3. Thick milk always throws up a much smaller 
 proportion of the cream which it actually contains 
 than milk that is thinner; but the cream is of a rich- 
 er quality ; and if water be added to that thick milk, 
 it will afford a considerably greater quantity of cream, 
 and consequently more butter than it would have 
 done if allowed to remain pure ; but its quality is, at 
 the same time, greatly debased. 

4. Milk, which is put into a bucket or other proper 
 vessel, and carried in it to a considerable distance, 
 80 as to ])e much agitated, and in part cooled before 

it is put into the milk-pans to settlefor cream, never 
 throws up so much, or so rich cream, as if the sani'^' 
 milk had been put into the milk-pans directly after it 
 was milked. 

From these fundamental facts, the reflecting dairy- 
 ist will derive many important practical rules. Some 
 of these we shall enumerate, and leave the rest to be 
 discovered. Cows should be milked as near the dai- 
 ry as possible, in order to prevent the necessity of 
 carrying and cooling the milk before it is put int<5 
 the creaming dishes. Every cow's milk should be 
 kept separate till the peculiar properties of each is 
 so well known as to admit of their being classed, 
 when those that are most nearly allied may bo mixed 
 together. When it is intended to make butter of a 
 very fine quality, reject entirely the milk of all those 
 cows which yield cream of a bad quality, and also 
 keep the milk that is first drawn from the cow at 
 each milking entirely separate from that which is 
 last obtained, as the quality of the butter must other- 
 wise be greatly debased without materially aug- 
 menting its quantity. For the same purpose, take 
 only the cream that is first separated from the first 
 drawn milk. Butter of the best quality can only be 
 economically made in those dairies where cheese is 
 also made; because in them the best part of each 
 cow's milk com be set apart for throwing up cream, 
 the best part of this cream can be taken in order to 
 be made into butter, and the remainder, or all the 
 rest of the milk and cream of the dairy, can be turn- 
 ed into cheese. The spontaneous separat'on ( f cream, 
 and the production of butter, are never effe txl but 
 in consequence of the production ot acid in the milk. 
 Hence it is that where the whole milk is set apart 
 for the separation of cream, and the whole of the 
 cream is separated, the milk must necessarily have 
 turned sour before it is made into cheese ; and no 
 very excellent cheese can bo made from milk which 
 has once attained that state. 

Eastern Virginia. — Nowhere has the farming in- 
 terest advanced with more rapidity than it has of late 
 years in the Tidewater District of Virginia. It was 
 stated by a gentleman from Lancaster county, the 
 other day, that there was annually more than double 
 the quantity of wheat now sown in his district than 
 was reaped in his district twenty years ago. Anoth- 
 er large proprietor stated that he had realised up- 
 wards of fifteen per cent, on his investment in land 
 cultivated in wheat. This change has been brought 
 about by the discovery and application of marl, inex- 
 haustible in that quarter, and the free use of guano, 
 — one farmer in Westmoreland, we learn, having last 
 year applied twenty tons of that manure with striking 
 effect, in the improvements of his lands. — Wincheaier 
 Virginian. 

Agriculture in this country is a highly respectar 
 ble, and at the same time a most attractive pursuit. 
 It is not only resorted to as a means of acquiring an 
 honest independence, but as a dignified and pleasur- 
 able occupation by men of science and letters, by 
 statesmen and warriors, merchants and navigators — 
 in short, by all who have wealth, honor, and distinc- 
 tion in other pursuits of life. — Senator S. A.Douglass.
