liody in any small quantity, the result is called a 
 pcroxid, being an imperfect oxid, in -wliich the pecu- 
 liar qualities of substance ■n'hich the oxygen unites 
 with are still largely predominant. But if the quan- 
 tity of oxygen be so large that a kind of mutual 
 saturation takes place, tht resulting combination is 
 called a protoxhl. In these the peculiar qualities or 
 properties of both substances are totally changed. — 
 When the quantity of oxygen absorbed is in excess 
 the combination is termed a Jiypercxid, which pos- 
 sesses properties more closely approximating those of 
 oxygen. But if the oxygen predominate so greatly 
 that the combinations become acid, and act corrosive- 
 ly when in a concentrated form, tliey are termed 
 acids. But all bodies do not aljsorb oxygen in such 
 f[uantity as to become acid. Of the simple substan- 
 ces, carbon, sulphur, phosphorus, and silicon alone 
 do so ; others, such as potassium, sodium, calcium> 
 magnesium, aluminum, iron and mang.anese, will 
 take up only so much oxygen as suffices to form oxids. 
 But these oxids, again, possess the property of uniting 
 with the oxids of the first mentioned class, and the 
 resulting combinations are termed salts. Other sub- 
 stances, however, may also form salts. All the va- 
 rious acids do not possess the same degree of affinity 
 for the several elements, uniting more readily with 
 some than with others, as though more closely rela- 
 ted to some than to others. This affinity extends so 
 far, that when acid has taken a particular substance, 
 and then meets another for which it has a stronger 
 attraction, it will forsake the former and combine 
 with the latter. The oxid which, by combination 
 with an acid, forms a salt, is called the base. Basic 
 bodies, accordingly, are oxids, whilst their counter- 
 parts are acids. 

An old farmer's method of planting Corn. 

Mb. Editor. — Although not the season for corn 
 planting, I give you herewith an account of the plan 
 which I always pursue, and after an experience of 
 nearly forty-eight years, have found ^under all cir- 
 cumstances to produce the best crops. Many year's 
 observation, has satisfied me of the fact, that my sys- 
 tem will answer as well as any other in favorable sea- 
 sons, and far better during such an one as that just 
 passed. 

I always make it a point, when practicable, to put 
 corn on sod ground, which may bo plowed in the fall, 
 and with excellent effect, but which should be, at the 
 earliest possible period in the spring. I always plow 
 eight inches in d»pth, then score out my ground very 
 deep, leaving the distance between the furrows three 
 feet. The corn is then dropped, single grains, twelve 
 inches apart. Where the ground is strong, the dis- 
 tance may be less. My ten-toothed harrow is next 
 brought into play, be!ng fashioned as follows : four- 
 teen inches in width in front, and eight inches be- 
 hind. This is tfarefuUy drawn through the furrow, 

thinly covering the corn, and the field permitted to 
 lie in this condition for sis or seven days, when, with 
 my twelve-toothed harrow I go over the whole, most 
 thoroughly, covering the corn. The efiect of this last 
 harrowing is to retard somewhat the first appearance 
 of the corn, (which, by the way is not an objection,) 
 and to keep down the weeds and grass. When about 
 four inches high, I go through the furrows lengthwise 
 with a shovel harrow, which is another deathlilow to 
 the weeds and grass, and when it has reached the 
 height of twelve inches I give it another and final 
 dressing with one of Il.arnley's corn plows. This 
 last dressing effectually destroys the weeds and leaves 
 the ground in a fine mellow condition. 

The advantages I claim for this method are these: 

First, the deep plowing gives the roots of the corn 
 a fine chance to penetrate the soil to a considerable 
 depth, in search of suitable food. The depth which 
 they reach, secures them in a great measure against 
 the effects usually produced by drought. A second 
 good result of the deep plowing is, that in very wet 
 seasons, the over-moisture will affect the young corn 
 less than where the plowing is shallow, because, not 
 being obstructed at a depth of four or five inclios by 
 the hard pan beneath, it has a chance to sink several 
 inches lower. 

Secondly. The heavy harrowing, after the corn has 
 been six or eight days planted, completely exposes to 
 the sun and air. the seeds of weed and grass which 
 have commenced germinating, and cither kills them 
 completely, or so injures them, that their future 
 growth and vigor is retarded so much as to place 
 them completely at the mercy of the shovel harrow 
 and corn plow, with which the after dressings are 
 given. Again, the last dressing with the corn plow 
 keeps the mellow earth around the stalk, and in most 
 cases the result is, a second set of roots which give in- 
 creased vigor to the growing stalk and ear. 

By the plan above detailed I have rarely, if ever, 
 failed to have an average crop, even in the most un- 
 favorable seasons, and when the seasons have been 
 good, I have been led to think the yield to be fully 
 equal to any of my neighbors. 

As before remarked, this article may be somewhat 
 out of season ; but as the long evenings are approach- 
 ing, some of your readers, who may think it worth 
 their while to test my plan, will have an excellent 
 opportunit}' of reading and reflecting upon the sub- 
 ject, before plowing time arrives.

The modes of sowing barley are either broad-cast 
 or in rows by the drill or ribbing. The broad-cast 
 mode is almost universally adopted ; unless in lands 
 much infested with annual weeds, where drilling and 
 hand-hoeing, and in particular cases horse-hoeing, 
 may be employed to advantage.
