Mr. Editor. — It is a source of satisfaction to ob- 
 serve the increased attention paid to lime as a fer- 
 tilizer. Notwithstanding the persevering efforts of 
 interested persons to press upon the farmers the ex- 
 tensive use of guano, and other highly vaunted ma- 
 nures, it is apparent that the common sense of the 
 community is fast triumphing over these labored ef- 
 forts, and our o'svn native fertilizers adopted to a 
 much greater extent than heretofore. 

As a manure, lime undoubtedly deserves to be 
 classed amongst the best, not only on account of the 
 permanent fertility it imparts to most soils, but also 
 from its abundance and cheapness. It is a well es- 
 tablished fact, that guano, while it rapidly imparts a 
 high fertility to many soils, loses its virtues in a com- 
 paratively short period ; thus rendering its frequent 
 repetition necessary. This involves an expense which 
 the generality of farmer's receipts will never justify, 
 hence its universal adoption, at once becomes imprac- 
 ticable. Lime, on the other hand, is not only cheap- 
 er, but when once applied in the requisite quantity, 
 many years elapse before another application is 
 needed. 

Chemical analysis has satisfactorily shown, that 
 lime exists in combination with an acid, in nearly 
 all plants, it therefore becomes an almost indispen- 
 sable ingredient of the food which should be supplied 
 to them. There are also but few soils of which it 
 does not form a part, and for this reason its adapta- 
 bility to the general uses of farming is greater than 
 that of any other manure — that of the farm yard ex- 
 cepted. Wherever, I believe, the presence of lime 
 has not been detected in greater or smaller propor- 
 tions, there the soil has been found unfit for cultiva- 
 tion. 

However, notwithstanding the almost universal 
 adaptability of lime to farming purposes, it is appa- 
 rent that its true value as a fertilizer is but imperfect- 
 ly understood. Farmers are frequently met with, 
 whose experience with it has been anything else than 
 satisfactory. If, however, inquiry is made, it will be 
 found that where it has failed to accomplish the do- 
 sired purposes, it has' been the fault of the farmer 
 and not of the lime. The general and very correct 
 impression, that it is useful upon nearly every kind 
 of soil, has led many to err in its application, they 
 supposing that all soils require it in equal quantities. 
 Writers upon the subject, pretend to fix the precise 
 quantity requisite for an acre, and following these 
 wise prescriptions, many persons apply it in the same 
 quantities to every variety of soil. Than this, there 
 could not be a more pernicious evil in farming. 

The quantity of lime to be used on an acre of ground 
 should of course vary with the character of the soil. 
 As one of its principal virtues consists in its action 
 upon organic substances ; that soil will of course bear 
 it in the largest quantities where 'animal and vegeta- 

ble remains most largely abound. Again, as lime is 
 most frequently deemed necessary, by the inexperi- 
 enced, where there is, to a considerable degree, an 
 absence of organic matter, the consequence is, that 
 it is frequently applied in too large quantities, to do 
 aught else than absolute harm, and the experimenter 
 tm-ns from it with disappointment and dissatisfaction. 

If more pains were taken to inculcate proper ideas 
 in regard to the use of lime as a fertilizer — if, instead 
 of \\Titers, lauding its general adaptation to all soils, 
 and in just such quantities as the farmer's means 
 will admit of, they would be particularly careful to 
 point out the character of the soils and the quantity 
 in which it should be applied to each, we should 
 soon find it gro^ving into favor, and our farmers reap- 
 ing the benefits of its virtues. 

I have penned the above, Mr. Editor, hoping that 
 it will be tlie means of drawing abler pens than mine 
 to this important subject. If your correspondent P. 
 S. L.'s views in relation to the deterioration of the 
 soil of Pennsylvania be correct, it is high time to 
 look around iis, and see what means are within our 
 reach to arrest the evil. There are doubtless many, 
 but it appears to me that there is no.one so thorough- 
 ly available as the judicious use of lime, and as our 
 coal regions are being intersected at every point by 
 rail roads, and as limestone exists in inexliaustible 
 quantities in a large portion of our State, the use of 
 lime will, in a few years, be brought within the reach 
 of the generality of farmers. Let us, therefore, un- 
 derstand its use perfectly, in advance.

A Practical Farmer's testimony in behalf of deep 
 plowing;. 

Mr. Editor : — In travelling through various sec- 
 tion of Pennsylvania, my attention has been arrested 
 by the very shallow plowing done by most farmers 
 This reprehensible practice prevails to as great an 
 extent in counties where the soil admits of plowing 
 to the depth of seven or eight inches, as in those 
 where it is thin and poor; and it appears to me that 
 it is the result not so much of a desire to evade the 
 diflference in the amount of labor as of an ignorance 
 of the immense value of deep plowing. 

I am a plain former, pretending to no scientific 
 knowledge, althougli I have the advantage of some 
 forty years practical [experience. 1 will not, there- 
 fore, attempt to give you any scientific reasons for 
 my strong faith in deep plowing, but will call your 
 attention to a few facts which spsak more loudly to 
 the minds of practical men than scientific theories. 

In the year 1847, I purchased the farm on which 
 I now reside. The condition of it at the time of pur- 
 chase was most wretched. Fences were torn down, 
 the house was fast going to decay, and the barn and 
 outbuildings too bad to shelter stock or protect pro- 
 duce from the weather. The land was in worse con-
