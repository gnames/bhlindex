dition still. For years it had been rented out, and 
 as is usually the case ■with tenants, every thing was 
 taken from the soil which it would yield, and when 
 at length it was worn out completely, it was turned 
 out, like an old horse to die. 

The land was originally as fine as any in Lancas- 
 ter county, a fact of which I was fully aware. I had 
 for years observed the mode of plowing adopted by 
 the tenants,, and felt satisfied that one of the princi- 
 pal causes of the wretched condition of the farm was 
 the " skinning" system pursued by them. My first 
 step, therefore, was to remedy this evil. My horses 
 being of the kind familiarly known as the " Conesto- 
 gos" and my plows, those manufactured in our own 
 county, (which, for adaptation to heavy soil are 
 the best I know of ) I commenced the work of renova- 
 tion. A good motto for every farmer is, " go to the 
 bottom of things." I determined to foUow it and 
 went to tlie bottom of the soil on my farm. It was 
 hard work, and my " Conestogo team" felt it. But I 
 fed well, and continued the undertaking. Every acre 
 was plowed to tlie depth of eight inches, and soil was 
 brought to the light and air which had not seen either 
 for a quarter of a century. Some of my neighbors 
 looked in upon me and nearly all predicted that I 
 would get tired before I was done. This, however, 
 did not discourage me. 1 persevered until the whole 
 was completed, applying to the land all the farm yard 
 manure I could gather, and when that failed, putting 
 on lime. 

What was the result? The result was that the 
 first crops of wheat and corn were treble the quantity 
 of those taken from the farm when under lease. I 
 had nearly thirty bushels of first rate wheat to the 
 acre, which was as good a yield as that of any of my 
 neighbors farms. A field from which, all told, six 
 small two horse loads of hay had been gathered ; two 
 years after yielded me thirty-nine larger loads. My 
 corn was good and I was satisfied with the result of 
 my experiment. 

As my means of feeding stock multiplied, I increas- 
 ed the number, so that my manure heap grew in size 
 and value. The deep plowing was persisted in, and 
 with this gratifying fact accompanying it, that where 
 I with difficulty plowed to a depth of eight inches 
 before, I could now plow to the same depth with as 
 much ease as my neighbors could to a depth of five 
 inches. This was another spoke in my wheel and 
 my neighbors began to see it. I was pleased to ob- 
 serve that several of them set their plows a little 
 deeper, and that the benefits of giving the sub-soil a 
 chance to speak, were beginning to be appreciated. 

During the past season I have had my faith in deep 
 plowing greatly strengthened. AYhile many farmers 
 complain of considerably less than an average crop 
 of corn, mine has never been better. During the 
 drought, when in other fields the corn looked sickly 

and yellow, mine grew strong and vigorous, and 
 throughout the season retained a rich green color. 

Now, Mr. Editor, while I give the lime and ma- 
 nure, I have applied to my farm, all the credit they 
 deserve, I attribute its present good condition mainly 
 io deep ]phu-ing, and in concluding this plain state- 
 ment of facts, permit me to say to farmers every 
 where, that the first plowing is the only one that 
 need be .looked upon with dread. "When once the 
 soil is loosened thoroughly to the depth of eight 
 inches, it can be kept loose with very little more la- 
 bor than where the average depth of plowing is five 
 inches. And I am fully convinced of the fact that 
 were the labor double that of shallow plowing, it 
 will pay better to go to the bottom, every year, than 
 merely to " skin " tlie surface.

liate Seeding. 

INIr. Editor. — The calamitous effects of blight in 
 our grain crops some ten or twelve years back, led 
 subsequently to early seeding, which in general is 
 the safest practice, although not a specific against 
 blight ; for I have frequently seen blighted wheat 
 which had been sown early. There are, and ever 
 will be cases of blighted grain, arising from causes 
 other than late seeding, which the want of time will 
 not permit me to enter upon now, but hope to be able 
 at some future time to explain. My object at present 
 is to say a few words on the necessity there will be 
 to guard against the "wintering out," as it is term- 
 ed, of the forthcoming crop, and to secure against 
 blight, as under tlio circumstance of late seeding. — 
 The prevailing drought pending the present seed 
 time producing a condition of things tantamount to 
 late sowing, will require some additional attention 
 on the part of farmers, in order to secure the young 
 grain and grass, feeble and exposed as they will Ix', 
 from the freezing and thawing of the coming winter. 

At this date, last season, most of the grain crops 
 looked so luxuriant and so much in advance of the 
 season, that fears were entertained by many, that so 
 premature a growth would injuriously aflfect the crop 
 by smothering it under the snow, or in promoting the 
 increase of the fly from the congenial shelter it would 
 afiijrd for its propagation; and hence some resorted 
 to depasturing, and not a few to mowmg, to provide 
 against the apprehended contingencies. The case is 
 widely different now, as many of the grain field.s 
 look as if left to fallow unsown. The seed if germi- 
 nated, has sent forth but feeble plants, having but 
 little hold in the ground, and should November be 
 oven'so favorable as common, still the young grain 
 can make but little progress in root or blade, to fit it 
 to withstand the severity and changes of the winter. 

The question then is, how can the danger be avert- 
 ed or the evil modi^ed? I answer, through a judicious
