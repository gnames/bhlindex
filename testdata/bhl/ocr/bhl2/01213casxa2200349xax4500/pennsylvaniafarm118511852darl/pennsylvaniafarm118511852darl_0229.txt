Johnson's too. Determine to give two hours at least 
 of eaoh evening to the study of thorn, and make it an 
 unalterable rule to fix in your mind at least one 
 important truth every evening. Persevere a few 
 weeks, and as one great truth is added to another, 
 you ■R-ill be surprised at the growing interest that is 
 awakening witiiin you. Thus continually and stead- 
 ily advance in your studies, and by the time spring 
 arrives, and you are prepared to resume your out-door 
 work, you will have laid up such stores of knowledge 
 as will not only repay you for the mental labor you 
 have undergone, but your daily toil, instead of being 
 drudgery, will become a source of delightful interest 
 to you. You will work more intelligently and conse- 
 quently more advantageously. Understanding the 
 character of the soil you cultivate, the manures you 
 apply and the crops you grow, you will be enabled to 
 adapt one to the other and thus produce the most de- 
 sirable results, with the least possible expense. 

In mentioning Johnson and Liebig only, do not 
 suppose that I wished to convey the idea that their 
 works should alone engage your attention. There 
 are many others, on subjects intimately allied to agri- 
 culture, vliich should also be attentively studied, and 
 which your own taste and judgment will enable you 
 to select. But remember this one fact; if you desire 
 to build up a reputation for being a true ecientific 
 practical farmer, agricultural chemistry must be the 
 corner stone of the structure you wish to raise. — 
 Without it you may farm, and farm successfully, but 
 your labor will not be intelligent labor. A¥ith it, 
 your toil will be lessened in fact, while the conscious- 
 ness that you understand the various processes that 
 engage your attention, will lend to it a charm that 
 will beguile many an otherwise tedious hour, and 
 lead you step by step, deeper into those glorious mys- 
 teries of nature's workings, that are a "sealed book" 
 to the uniformed. Young man, how will you spend 
 the long winter evenings ? Franklin.

Mr. Editor: — Some time since I purchased a cow, 
 which, at the time of purchase, was very thin in flesh. 
 She gave a large quantity of milk, and I was led to 
 believe that with careful feeding I could soon improve 
 her appearance. But my hopes have been vain. — 
 She eats freely and gets as much as she can eat, but 
 she will not fatten. The amount sf milk has also in- 
 creased very perceptibly, but not the fiesh. Can you 
 account for this ? J. S.

[Answer. — Good milkers are rarely ever full flesh- 
 ed. The curd and butter of milk are formed from 
 the same material as the fat and muscle of the cow, 
 consequently, so long as she continues to yield a 
 large quantity of milk, she will not become fivtter. — 
 Whenever the cow begins to fatten her milk falls off 
 i n quantity. 

Dear Sir: — Agreeably to promise I send herewitli 
 a small sample of wheat grown by me this season. — 
 I procured the seed from the Waljash valley, Ca»s 
 county, Indiana — and quote the words of a letter 
 from the friend tp whose kindly office I am indebted 
 for the seed. "The wheat was raised on the barrens 
 or oak cpenings, and yields, with western farming, 
 thirty to thirty-five bushels per acre. The seed wa.^ 
 originally sent in a letter from the Baltic, weighs 
 sixty-four poimds to the bushel, and is considered the 
 best in the country — commanding $1 per bushel for 
 seed." 

I sowed the three bushels of seed on an acre and 
 a half of ground which had been in potatoes, they 
 having been sowed in tlio sod well manured with 
 barn yard manure. The yield was fifty-two bushels. 

Owing to the delay in forwarding the seed it was 
 not sowed until the 11th of October and was harvest- 
 ed on the 8th of July — one day after a field of Medi- 
 terranean wheat sowed on tho 13th of September. — 
 It is a white beardless variety — bearing a full head 
 not so long as the Mediterranean but equal in bulk 
 upon a remai-kably stiff straw, much tho color of 
 bright bamboo. 

Upon the 30th ultimo I seeded twelve acres witii 
 this wheat, having manured the oats stubble freely 
 with barn yard manure, plon ed threo times, sowed 
 broadcast two bushels to the acre and harrowed in. 

It will afford me pleasure to communicate the re- 
 sult at the proper season. 

From the very gratifying success of tho first sow- 
 ing I am encouraged to hope this may prove what we 
 so much desire in this region, an early white wheat. 

I intend having the ground accurately surveyed 
 and the return of the miller to whom tlio crop was 
 sold. Very respectfully. 

Your obedient servant,

To Measure an Acre op Ground. — In measuring 
 land, 30i square yards make one square rod, and 40 
 square rods make on square rood, four of Vv'hich, or 
 IGO rods, make one acre. It is evident, therefore, 
 that 40 rods long by 4 rods wide will make an acre. 
 The same result may be arrived at by measuring 299 
 feet in length, and 198 feet in width, or by measur- 
 ing 73 J 'yards in length, by CO yards in breadth. To 
 lay out an acre square, 209 feet on each side is the 
 nearest amount that will make an acre, being les.s 
 than an inch each way over the exact distance ; 43 
 560 superficial feet, or 208 95—100 feet on eaoh side 
 constitute an acre of ground. 

An Englishman observed a stone roll down a stair- 
 case. It bumped on every stair till it came to the 
 bottom ; there, of course, it rested. " That stone," 
 said he, " resembles the national debt of my country; 
 it has bumped on every grade of the community, but 
 its weight rests on the lowest."
