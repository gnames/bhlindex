Propagation of the vine. 

(Ciintiuued from page 209.) 

Some c\iltivators take single eyes with about half 
 an inch of the wood above and belq^y, rounding off 
 both ends somewhat, and place them in a hotbed or 
 in pots, horizontally, so as to leave the apex of the 
 bud or eye even with the surface of the soil — cover- 
 ing the whole slightly with moss, which is to be kept 
 moderately moist. 

In connection with the pi'cceding, Mr. Matlack 
 gives his system of pruning or dressing, based on the 
 physiology of the vine ; which being an essential 
 part of the after culture, deserves to be quoted in his 
 own language. 

" Every joint of a grape vine has its own separate 
 pith. This most important circumstance commences 
 at the lowest leaf that has a clasper opposite. A 
 solid woody substance, passing from the leaf to the 
 clasper, through the vine, and connecting them to- 
 gether, cut off entirely the communication between 
 the pith of the joint below and that of the joint nest 
 above ; and so on upwards at every joint throughout 
 the whole length of the vine. In the after stages of 
 the growth of the vine, this takes ] lace also where 
 the first branch of grapes stands opposite to a leaf — ■ 
 the bunches never failing to stand below all the clas- 
 pers, which are indeed barren fruit stems, whose 
 chief office is to support the vine and the clusters be- 
 low them. It is important to be known and kept in 
 mind, that all the eyes below the first clasper are 
 fiirmed in the bosom of smaller and more feeble 
 leaves ; and that the base of these eyes does not ex- 
 tend across the vine so as entirely to cut off the pith 
 of the joint below from connection with that of the 
 joint next above it. These eyes are tlierefore imper- 
 fect, and whenever you trim the vine ought to be 
 rubbed off. 

" It is at the first trimming of a vine grown from a 
 cutting, that we begin to apply the principle here 
 laid down ; and it is only on this occasion that there 
 can be any difficulty in the application of it. This 
 difficulty can only arise when the growth of the vine 
 * has been so feeble, as not to have produced a clasper 
 in any part of it. This seldom occurs, but if it 
 should happen, the vine must l)e cut off at half an 
 inch abovd the lowest strong full eye ; otherwise it is 
 to be cut off at half an inch above the first clasper ; 
 and in both cases, all the eyes below are to be 
 carefully cut off. 

" The eye thus left will sometimes produce more 
 than one shoot, in which case all but the strongest 
 should be rubbed off, and that supported and pro- 
 tected. This, except the keeping the ground free 
 from woods, is all the care required this year. 

" In tlie following February the vine is to be again 
 cut off just above the second clasper from below ; that 
 is leaving on two eyes to grow this season, and rub- 
 bing off all the eyes below the lowest clasper. Both 
 these shoots should be permitted to grow to their ut- 

most extent — which, if the soil bo favorable, will bo 
 very considerable ; and there will be reason to hope 
 for fruit the next season. 

" The lower clasper issues higher up on some kinds 
 of vine than on others. On some it appears at the 
 third leaf, on some at the fourth, and on some kinds 
 as high up as at the fifth leaf. But the same rule is 
 to be applied to all ; and every eye below the lowest 
 clasper is to be rubbed off. 

" In the third February, three eyes may be left on 
 each shoot ; l>ut not more, however strong the shoots 
 may appear to be. From this time forward all the 
 side branches from'the shoots of the year are to be 
 rubbed off, taking care not to injure the leaf from 
 which they spring, which is the nurse of the bud at 
 the liase of the stem. 

" At the fourth time of dressing the vine, and from 
 that time forward, it may be out from about the end 
 of October to the middle of February. Four eyes 
 may be left on each shoot at this time ; and five eyes 
 may be left on each at the fifth dressing. But more 
 than five eyes should never be left on a shoot even of 
 the most vigorous growth, at any age of the vine ; for 
 however pleasing the increase for the year may be, 
 the injury done thereby to the vine, will be seen and 
 lamented in the following and probably many suc- 
 ceeding years." 

So much for the readiest modes of raising the vine 
 from cuttings, and its subsequent treatment. But tlie 
 propagation of this plant by seed, also deserves atten- 
 tion and trial, because valuable now varieties are not 
 unfrequcntly thus obtained, and seedlings generally 
 prove to be hardier and more productive than the pa- 
 rent plant, thriving in inferior soils, and being less 
 susceptible of injury from atmospheric influences. — 
 For this purpose the most perfect and earliest ma- 
 tured seeds of approved grapes arc chosen, separated 
 from the pulp, and dried. About the close of April, 
 a bed having a western or northern exposure is to be 
 prepared, by depositing a layer of leaves, or fresh 
 horse dung about a foot high, and coverin;^ it with 
 about four inches of rich garden mould. The seed 
 is then dibblsd in three inches apart in rows six in- 
 ches distant from each other, and covered about half 
 an inch. The ground is to bo kept moderately damp, 
 and about the middle of May the young plants will 
 make their appearance. During the summer the bed 
 must be kept clear of weeds, and oceasionallyVatered 
 if the season be dry. In August the seedlings must be 
 pruned down to eight or nine inches, and at the end 
 of October taken up and preserved in moist sand or 
 earth, over the winter, in a well ventilated cellai.- - 
 In the following spring, they may be sot out in rows, 
 or planted where they are to remain permanently, 
 and the subsequent treatment is to be in accordance 
 with the directions given by Mr. Mattack. 

An excellent liquid manure for tlie vine, may be 
 prepared as follows : Take one bushel of cow dung, 
 ten gallons of water, three gallons of bullock's blood, 
 and two quarts of unslacked lime. Incorporate the 
 whole wall, stirring it frequently during two weeks, 
 and water the plants therewith in the spring, shortly 
 before the buds begin to start W.
