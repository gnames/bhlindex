 A HaTilt of Obserratioii Essential to Success with 
 tlie Farmer. 

BY FR.INKLIX B. HOUGH, M. D. 

Persons accustonipd to follow a reojular routine of 
 business, whieh admits of but little variation, and re- 
 quires little beyond a well trained exercise of muscu- 
 lar action, are liable to fall into a habit of inattention, 
 and the mind unaccustomed to active exercise be- 
 comes by disuse enfeebled in its power, and disquali- 
 fied for active thought. It is emphatically true with 
 the mental, as with the material part of our natures, 
 tliat exercise strengthens our power, and enables us 
 the better to exert them when occasion offers. The 
 common remarks, that great events call forth great 
 men, and that the supply in literature and the fine 
 arts, as well as in the commercial world, always 
 equals the demand, are founded in the principle of 
 our natures. In the mechanic arts, there is loss op- 
 portunity for this mental exercise than in agricultur- 
 al operations, and practice of the fine arts. 

Yet even in the most simple and monotonous em- 
 ployment, a busy mind will ever find exercise, and 
 not unfrequently originate an idea which when devel- 
 oped and applied, is<;apable of working the greatest 
 changes. 

It has been said that on the first introduction of 
 the steam engine, a boy was employed to open and 
 close the valves. By watching the motions of the 
 several parts of the machinery, he contrived to attach 
 a fixture which performed his task with precision. — 
 Here was a labor as monotonous as could well be 
 imagined, and to many, as barren of subjects for 
 thought as could be selected ; — but a fertile mind was 
 not to lay idle, and ingenuity was found able to per- 
 fect a great discovery. 

If we may believe tradition, some of the greatest 
 discoveries in science, have been suggested by events 
 so common as to pass by daily unheeded by the mass 
 of mankind. The operations of the animate world 
 around us, involve the application of principles in 
 mechanics which contain the germs of the greatest of 
 human discoveries. The operations of the aeronaut, 
 the diver and the sailor have their analogies in the 
 spider, and the nautilus, which practiced their arts 
 before the Montgolfiers launched into the air the pa- 
 per_balloons, or the adventurous diver sought to carry 
 air with him into the watery element, or the rudest 
 sail was spread to the breeze. 

To the husbandman in an especial manner, is the 
 book of nature opened for perusal, and his attention 
 is invited to the operation of agencies so wonderful, 
 that if they could be exhibited for the first time to a 
 person who had never seen them, would call forth ex- 
 clamations of surprise at their operations. If a seed, 
 cast into the 8oil,should germinate, spring up, grow 
 into a treo, blossom, and bear fruit within an hour, 
 few persons would look upon such a wonder without 
 awe and astonishment; yet the operation is not 

the less curious, or less worthy of admiration and 
 study, because the successive changes are insensible, 
 and require years for their consummation. 

The natural habits and requirements of plants, — 
 the circumstances that favor or retard their growtlj, — 
 the soil and manures which are best suited to their 
 wants, — tlie changes which a given soil requires in 
 "order that it may yield the greatest profits, for tlie 
 longest time, and at the least expense, — the accidents 
 and injuries to which plants may be liable, and tlie 
 methods by which they may bo protected from them ; 
 the best time and circumstances for seed time and 
 harvest, — and lastly the best manner of preparing the 
 soil, of rearing, collecting, and preparing for market 
 the productions of his farm, all require an exercise of 
 thought, and admit of improvements in the ways and 
 means which the farmer has given to habits of obser- 
 vation, will not fail to notice and employ. 

A similar remark might be applied to the rearing 
 of domestic animals, and to every department of ag- 
 ricultural operations. 

Under equal circumstances and habits of industry, 
 it will universally be found, that the most observant 
 farmer is the most successful, and that success is di- 
 rectly proportioned to the skill and care bestowed 
 upon the adaptation of wants or requirements in the 
 varied labors of the farm. Without suitable reflec- 
 tion, one may build a wall on a soil which heaves witli 
 the frost, and thus lose in a short time the labor 
 which might in proper situations have lasted a life- 
 time, — or persists in cultivating the same crop in a 
 field, when another would yield him thrice the profits, 
 or continues in the raising of certain grain, or stock, 
 while the market should have warned liim to adopt a 
 more profitable course, — or rejects a new improve- 
 ment in implements for cultivating the soil, thereby 
 placing the labor of his own hands, in competition 
 with the horses of his neighbors,— or allows to run 
 to waste a hundred sources of fertilizing manures, 
 which might profitably and cheaply be applied to his 
 soil, — or penuriously denies himself and family the 
 opportunity of learning of the new discoveries in the 
 science of agriculture, by neglecting to supply him- 
 self with journals and papers devoted to that subject ; 
 who in short, continues to follow in the steps of his 
 father and grandfather, regardless of circumstances, 
 without reflection, for no other reason than because 
 they did thus and so. 

By close observation, a practical knowledge of 
 the quality of a given soil may be estimated from the 
 kinds of timber or wild plants which flourish upon it 
 in the state of nature, and an ordinary acquaintance 
 with the principles of chemistry, will enalile one to 
 apply a few tests to determine the quality of soil, 
 and judge of the kind of crop best suited to the lo- 
 cality. By closely observing the changes of the 
 weather, one may by habit acquire the means of 
 judging with some probability of accuracy, _the au-
