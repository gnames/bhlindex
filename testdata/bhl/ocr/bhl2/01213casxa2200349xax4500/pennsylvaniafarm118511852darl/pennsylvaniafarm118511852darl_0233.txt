A habit of order and economy would be acquired 
 by keeping these records, which could not fail to 
 evince itself in all the details of the farm, and if this 
 duty be enjoined upon the youth while assisting in 
 agricultural labors, before leaving the paternal roof, 
 the additional advantage would be attained of an 
 I'arly formed and lasting Isabit of observation, which 
 would ultimately become a second nature and as in- 
 <lispen8able as existence itself. 

AVhen a person attains the merid'an of life, now 
 'labita are acquired with difficulty, and old ones 
 nl.iaudoned with gi'eat reluctance. It is therefore to 
 the youth, and those still forming those habits which 
 they must carry with them through life, that the sen- 
 timents of this paper are commended with the earn- 
 est hope that they will receive mature reflection, and 
 tlie suggestions therein contained will be adopted as 
 a rule of life. They enjoin no self-denial, they require 
 no pecuniary expense, and they will consume no por- 
 tion of time which should be assigned to other duties. 
 Every one looses daily in odd moments a hundred 
 times more time than would be required, without no- 
 ticing the loss, which if devoted to the acquirement 
 I'f useful knowledge would serve as a fund for reflec- 
 tion and pleasure in old age, when man ceases to di>- 
 rive gratification from the busy world around him, 
 .and must rely upon the stores of memory, and the 
 recollection of a well or ill spent life for his pleasant 
 or miserable associations.

I The fiowgrs are scattered onlhe stem,— large and 
 showy, the upper part pale greenish yellow, the low- 
 er part bright orange yellow. It flowers from June 
 till September. The pod is of a cylindrical form, 
 opening by several divisions at the tup, divided into 
 two cells, containing numerous black, irrcgul.arly 
 shaped seeds, roundish dotted in the centre. 

It is said to have been introduced into Philadel- 
 phia, by a Mr. Kanstcad, a AVelshman, as a garden 
 flower. It has now become a great nuisance in many 
 places, and will require much persevering effort to 
 extirpate it. Continued culture with the hoe, is 
 among the best means to destroy it. Although a vile 
 weed to the farmer, it is not entirely useless. It is 
 the principal ingredient in Wolph's celebrated oint- 
 ment for the piles. It is also used for dropsies, jaun- 
 dice, and cutaneous eruptions, and LinniBus savs, it 
 is used as a poison for flies. 

The plant has a bitterish and saline taste, and 
 when rubbed emits a smell resembling that of elder. 
 Nothing will eat it, and every vestige of it should be 
 destroyed by the farmer as soim as it makes its ap- 
 pearance on the farm. J. M. M'-Mixx.

It is a Linaria, a genus established by Tourneforte. 
 The name is derived from the Celtic Llin, the name 
 for flax, because the leaves resemble those of that 
 plant. It belongs to the 14th class, Dldynamia, and 
 the 2d order, Arigiospermia, in the artificial system 
 of Linnreus, — to order Scrophulariacae, of Sprongel. 
 and tribe Antirrhinidoa in Gray's Botany of the 
 Northern and Middle States. 

The genus contains 13G species. Two of them are 
 natives of the United States, and two more are natu- 
 ralized. The one under consideration is a native of 
 Europe, but is found estensively in this country, and 
 is becoming a very pernicious weed. It does not 
 seem to have spread itself alarmingly until recently, 
 now it takes almost exclusive possession of the soil 
 in some vicinities. 

The root lives for many years and is almost as te- 
 nacious of life as the Canada thistle. The stem grows 
 from one to two feet high, not branched except near 
 the summit, smooth and leafy. The leaves are fcom 

The advantage of keeping good cows. 

Mr. Editor: — There is one subject which I think 
 should claim the special attention of the farmers of 
 Pennsylvania, but which for some unaccountable 

reason appears to hare been strangely neglected I 

mean the raising of the most improved breeds of cat- 
 tle. For several years I kept only the common stock, 
 that is. only such stock as is generally brought into 
 our neighborhood by drovers from the western coun- 
 ties. Stock of this character, although apparently 
 very cheap, prove in the end much the dearest. Af- 
 ter a fair trial, I found this to he the case ; many of 
 the cows I kept, scarcely paying the expense of keep- 
 ing, and having satisfied myself of this fact, I sold 
 off my entire stock and purchased instead, some of 
 the best devon heifers I could procure. To the im- 
 provement of these I have devoted much time and atr 
 tention, and find myself well repaid for both. 

I will give you a few facte in relation to one of my 
 cows, which took the first premium at our county ex- 
 hibition on the 1st and 2d of October. We com- 
 menced milking her on the 14th of December last, 
 and on the first week made 13 J lbs. of butter, and the 
 average yield of butter for eleven successive weeks 
 was 10 lbs. or 110 Ibf. in all. On the 23d of May, 
 the yield of butter from this cow was 8J lbs. per 
 week, and when within six weeks of calving, 4i lljs. 
 per week. The yield of butter during the year was 
 400 lbs. the whole of which was printed and sent to 
 market, where it commanded an average price of 
 twenty cents, thus making ^sO worth of bulter. —
