of the exliibitors. Nothing was left undone that was 
 required, or of whicli they had notice in time, and 
 we are gratified in being alile to state that their ef- 
 forts to please were fully appreciated by the immense 
 crowd. 

The Marshals under the command of John C. 
 McCallister, Esq., of Ilarrisburg, Chief Marshal, dis- 
 charged their duties admirably, as the remarkable 
 order and decorum maintained during the whole ex- 
 hibition fully proved. 

R. C. Walker, Esq., of Elizabeth, Allegheny county. 
 Secretary of the Society, and G. H. Bucher, of 
 lloguestown, 'were at their posts at all hours and 
 with their efiicient clerks, succeeded in supplying the 
 heavy demand for certificates of membership and 
 tickets of admission. They as well as the President 
 and A'^ice Presidents are the persons to whom appli- 
 cation for membership may be made. 

The manner in whicli the duties of the various 
 committees wore discharged, and the general satisfac- 
 tion their awards of premiums and diplomas gave, 
 entitle them to honorable mention. Several of the 
 ' committees, but especially, the one on Agricultural 
 implements, were entirely too small. This was the 
 result, not of any desire to withhold a fair examination 
 of all the implements, but from the fact that »he dis- 
 play in this department was so much greater than 
 had been anticipated. This will be corrected in fu- 
 ture exhibitions. 

The display of stock was not extraordinary, al- 
 though it was fully equal to public anticipations. — 
 Had it not been for the wretched arrangements of the 
 Central Rail Road Company it would have been much 
 better, as a large number of fine cattle from the east- 
 ern counties, and New Jersey, intended for the ex- 
 hibition did not reacli the grounds for want of 
 suitable conveyances. This is a matter to be deeply 
 deplored. None could have been more deeply inter- 
 ested in the success of the exhibition than the com- 
 pany, both for the present and the future, and yet, 
 their arrangements wore faulty both in regard to the 
 conveyance of stock and passengers. We shall at- 
 tend to this department more fully, hereafter, as there 
 were many animals on exhibition of the best breeds 
 well deserving of notice. 

The display of horses was good in some respects, 
 and defective in others. We should have been proud 
 to see a larger number of our Pennsylvania draught 
 horses. Quite a number of superior blooded and 
 other stallions were exhibited, as well as promising 
 brood mares, colts, Ac. 

The display of articles of domestic manufacture was 
 highly creditable. Hero the ladies had the sway, 
 and we most cheerfully accord to them the high 
 praise they deserve. We would suggest to the Ex- 
 ecutive committee, the appointment of a committee of 
 ladies to this department. 
 1^ The agricultural produce department wa6 tolerably 

well represented, as was also the mechanical. The 
 contributions in Floral Hall were good, though not 
 large in number. 

The Ploughing match attracted much attention. — - 
 We considered it one of the most important features 
 of the exhibition, and were glad to perceive that 
 the large majority agreed with us. There is yet 
 room for important improvements in ploughs and the 
 more attention given to their construction and work, 
 the sooner their improvement will be effected. Some 
 of the ploughing was excellent, and deserves special 
 mention hereafter, while others were deficient in all 
 tluit constitutes good work. 

Wo were highly gratified to observe that with a 
 few exceptions, the plows were all manufivctured in 
 our own State, and gave evidence of superior me- 
 chanical skill, both in their construction and finish. 

The contributions of fowls were excellent, and at- 
 trac^ted as much attention as any other part of the 
 exhibition. The lien fever seized the people, and 
 every chicken on the ground from the tiny Bantam 
 to the tall Shanghae, that could be bought, was pur- 
 chased at high prices and sent in various directions 
 through tJie State. 

Refreshments of excellent quality v\ere served up 
 in abundance by Mr. llinkle of Columbia. His ar- 
 rangements, though extensive, were not as ample as 
 they should have been. Tliis h ^wever was the result 
 not of any want of disposition to accommodate, but of 
 a mistaken notion in regard to the number of persons 
 who would be in attendance at the fair. Mr. II. will 
 know better next tijae. 

The only objectionable feature we observed, was the 
 permission granted a number of itinerant venders of 
 worthless articles, to display their wares, and by non- 
 sensical declamation, divert the attention of the crowd 
 from the careful examination of the implements, stock, 
 &c., thus defeating one of the great objects of the 
 exhibition. 

It may be confidently asserted and we refer to the 
 fact with pleasure, that never, on any occasion did so 
 large a crowd assemble, and continue in close prox- 
 imity for so long a period with as little disturl)anoe. 
 All were agreeably surprised at the extent of the dis- 
 play and the magnitude of the crowd, and it was 
 heart cheering to us, who have never for a single in- 
 stant wavered in our faith in the ability of Pennsyl- 
 vania to stand with the foremost in an agricultural 
 point of view, to hear from thousands of lips, " thia 
 is well, but next year we will do better." Not a 
 drunken man was seen on the gnmnds nor did any 
 thing occur to mar in the slightest degree the harmo- 
 ny and good feeling that prevailed. It was a proud 
 event for the Keystone State, and one that will tell 
 powerfully upon her future grcitnoss. The number 
 of persons in attendance was variously estimated at 
 from 35,000 to 45,000. 

In concluding this very hasty and imperfect sketch
