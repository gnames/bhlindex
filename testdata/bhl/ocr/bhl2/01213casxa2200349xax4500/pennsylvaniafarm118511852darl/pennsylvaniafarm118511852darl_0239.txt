of the fiir, vcc beg leave to tender to the committee of 
 arraHgemonts, as well as all the officers our unfeigned 
 thanks for the many courtesies extended us. A tent 
 was provided in which we opened our office, and in- 
 vited our friends to call. They did call, by scores 
 and hundreds, and the greetings we exchanged with 
 them were of the most pleasant and friendly charac- 
 ter. It may not be out of place to remark, that our 
 subscription list was largely increased. 

The Central Rail Road Company. 

AVe regret the necessity that compels us to speak of 
 the conduct of the Central Kail R(jad Company in re- 
 gard to the transportation of passengers an 1 stock to 
 tlio State Fair. Instead of throwing open all their 
 trains at half price and permitting visitors to the 
 State fair to take passage in any one of them, two 
 trains only were set apart for this purpose, and these 
 wholly insufficient to accommorlate the vast crowd 
 desirous of visiting the fair. AVe may safely assert 
 that thousands of persons from Lancaster city and 
 county were prevented from going by the slimness of 
 the company's accommodations and the unreasonable 
 hours at which the trains reached llarrisburg. We 
 will not advert to the character of the cars, nor the 
 insolence of some of the conductors. We have re- 
 ceived several letters from gentlemen of the highest 
 respectability in which the conduct of some of the 
 c-onductors is spoken of, and we think it becomes the 
 duty of the President and Managers to enquire into 
 this matter. Amongst those who strove to aecommo- 
 d.ate passengers we are pleased to mention, Mr. Paul 
 Hamilton, who left nothing undone that would in any 
 way conduce to their comfort. 

The arrangements for the transportation of stock 
 were equally deficient, and had the effect of render- 
 ing this department of the exhibition far less credita- 
 ble than it would otherwise have been. 

It is incomprehensible to us, why the most ample 
 accommodations were not afforded. It certainly was 
 a profitable afiiiir for the company and would have 
 been more so, had they manifested a little^ more li- 
 berality. We know that the entire motive power of 
 the Columbia Rail Road was placed at the disposal of 
 the Central Rail Road Company, by the Canal Com- 
 missioners for the conveyance of passengers and stock 
 if necessary. Where then is their apology ? We can 
 and do assure them, that a feeling of deep indigna- 
 tion pervades the community and wo tliink, very pre - 
 perly. 

Fruit jlkd Orxajientai. Trees. — We have made 
 arrangements to supply orders to any extent for fruit 
 ami ornamental trees of every description at nursery 
 prices. Persons ordering from us may rest assured 
 that the trees furnished will be all they .are repre- 
 sented, and that no pains will be spared to guard 
 them against imposition. Catalogues may be had at 
 our office. 

PliUadelphia Society tor the Promotion of .Agricul- 
 ture. 

The annual exhibition of this vencraVde society 
 was held at the Rising Sun village en the 8th and 
 9th of October. Having a leisure day or two, we de- 
 termined to spend it with_ our Phihidelphia friends, 
 knowing that we could not pass the time more agree- 
 ably or profitably. 

The first thing which struck our attention on en- 
 tering the grounds was the superb display of poultry, 
 embracing fine specimens of the most select breeds. 
 We examined this department with feelings of deep 
 interest, and think we are safe in asserting that the 
 display has never been equalled at any county exhi- 
 bition elsewhere. Amongst the contributors were 
 Messrs. Hague, Wistar, Ditmar, McGowen, Bunk, 
 Hendricks, Leonard and Bumstead. An object of 
 special interest was a Shanghae hen, the first ever 
 imported to the United .States. She is seven years 
 old, looks well, and we were informed lays well. A 
 brood of her chickens were on exhibition and bore 
 unmistakeable evidence of purity. She was import- 
 ed by express order, liy A. T. Xewbold, Esq., of Phi- 
 ladelphia, who has given great attention to fowls, 
 and has been highl3- successful in breeding them. — 
 We regret that our limits forbid a more extended no- 
 tice of this interesting department of the exhibition. 
 There was a fine display of njat cattle, including 
 the Durham, Aldcrney, Devon, Ayrshire and other 
 choice breeds. The animals looked well and wero 
 generally admired. The princip.al contributors to 
 this department were Gen. Cadwallader, Owen Slie- 
 ridan. James Gowen, Samuel Williams, Dr. Barton, 
 George Blight and others. If our Philadelphia coun- 
 ty friends could infuse a little more of their spirit 
 into other portions of the .State, Pennsylvania would 
 soon be without a rival in this department. 

AV'e did not consider the display of horses good. — 
 A few were exhibited possessing fine points, but as a 
 general thing the display was poor. 

A large number of swine were exhibited of the 
 Berkshire, black and white, Chester county and 
 Duchess, together with some fine crosses of the Berk- 
 shire and Chester county breeds. This department 
 was creditably filled, all the animals bearing evi- 
 dence of superiority of kind. 

Of Sheep, the display was limited but highly select. 
 One of the principal attractions in this department 
 was a superb New Oxfordshire Buck, exhibited by 
 Aaron Clements, Esq., of Philadelphia. Mr. Hood, 
 of Chester county, exhibited a number of chuice Cots- 
 wolds, South Downs and Bakewells. Mr. Johnson 
 was also a contributor to tliis department. 

The display of impl.'ments was large, and inter- 
 fasting. Many implements of tlie nidst api>roved con- 
 struction were shown by Messrs. Prouty and Barrett. 
 C. B. Rogers, Mr. Wilkinson of Mount Airy, and 
 others.
