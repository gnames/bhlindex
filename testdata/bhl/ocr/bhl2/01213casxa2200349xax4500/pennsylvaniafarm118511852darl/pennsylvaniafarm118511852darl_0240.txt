[November, 

The contributions of agricultural productions -were 
 excellent in quantity and quality, notwithstanding 
 the unprecedented draught which prevailed. 

The annual Address wiwi delivered by our friend 
 John S. Bowen, Esq., of Chester county, than ■whom 
 a better could not have been selected. It was 
 li.stened to with marked attention by the larp;p crowd, 
 and abounded in mucli tluit was valualjle and inte- 
 resting. 

According to custom, the Society with the Com- 
 mittees and invited guests, sat down to a most boun- 
 tiful repast provided by that caterer of good tilings 11. 
 B. Jones, of the Excluuige Hotel, Philadelphia. — 
 Amongst the guests present were Jlr. Howard of the 
 Albany Cultivator, Dr. J. Davis President of the 
 Montgomery county Society, Jacob Frantz, Esqr., 
 President of the Lancaster County Society, llov. Dr. 
 Choles of Rhode Island, Gen. llichardson of Rich- 
 mond Va., and other distinguithed gentlemen. The 
 President of the Society, -James Gowen, Esq., presided 
 at the table, with dignity and ease. After the 
 cloth was removed, speeches were made by Mr. How- 
 ard, Gen. Richardson, Gen. Cadwalader, A. S. Rob- 
 erts, Dr. Choles, J. Price Wetherill and others, all of 
 which breathed a warm devotion to the cause of Ag- 
 riculture. Everything passed of pleasantly and 
 agreeably. 

In concluding this hasty sketch, we cannot forbear 
 alluding to the narrow limits of the grounds occupied 
 by the Society for their exhibitions. It appeared to 
 us, that the pioneer Society of agriculture in the U. 
 States, the influence of whose example has been felt 
 and acknowledged in every section of our country, 
 should have ample room for their operations. Their 
 existence as a Society is no longer a problem. For 
 sixty-six years they have flourished, and with each 
 succeeding year arc growing more spirited and 
 stronn-er, and we hope to see the day when this vene- 
 rable association shall have grounds of their own, 
 worthy the character of the Society and the good 
 cause for which they have so long and nobly battled. 

TuE PniLADELrnn Po.st Office. — Will the Post 
 Master at Philadelphia be kind enough to inform us 
 why so many and such frequent complaints of failures 
 of the Farm Journal to reach its proper place of des- 
 tination in the city and county are made to us. So ^ 
 frequent have been these complaints, that wo are al- 
 most afraid to meet a subscriber from that section, 
 lest his first inquiry should be, "why have I not re- 
 ceived my Journal." Now it is very evident that there 
 is something wrong aliout this ofiice. If we were not 
 particularly careful in mailing our Journal, we would 
 willingly take a part of the blame upon our own 
 shoulders; but knowing as we do, that the fault is 
 ■ot with us, we know not where to place it but at the 
 door of the Philadelphia Post Office. We therefore 
 ask more attention to this matter on the ] rt of Uie 
 Post Ma;t;r. 

The farmer who had nothing to learn. 
 There are in every community, farmers, who con- 
 ceive it impossible to add anything to their already 
 acquired stock of knowledge. We met one ef this 
 class a few days since, who in answer to our inquiry 
 whether he was a subscriber to an agricultural pa- 
 per, indignantly replied that " book farming was a 
 humbug, and that he knew more of farming than any 
 body could tell him." AVe did not argue the point 
 with him, conceiving it to be worse than useless ; but 
 as we left him, we took a few notes of the condition 
 ot this model farmer's premises, which we present to 
 the readers of the Journal, with the hope that they 
 will prove of service. 

The paling fence enclosing the house yard, was 
 broken down in several places ; one of the hinges 
 was torn off the gate, and directly in front of the 
 kitchen door several lank looking swine were wallow- 
 ing in the mud hole.where, for dear knows how long. 
 the slops of the kitchen had been carelessly thrown. 
 Wo thought, that were he really as wise as he con- 
 ceived himself to be, that fence would have been re- 
 paired, that gate hinge fastened, — a good breed of 
 swine would have replaced those hungry lookinf^ 
 ones, and the rich slops of the kitchen would have 
 been applied to a bettor use, than to create an un- 
 wholesome and unpleasant wallowing place for swine. 

The barn stood on an eminence, and directly in 
 front of it, a small stream flowed. From the manure 
 heap to this stream; the rich manure water was flow- 
 ing, in a silent but steady stream, and beneath some 
 cherry trees that skirted the lawn, I observed larj^i 
 quantities of the excrements of the fowls, exposed to 
 the action of the weather, and aiding materially the 
 growth and vigor of the wilderness of weeds around. 
 Had he been so very wise, he would have checke<l 
 the waste of that precious manure, and instead of 
 permitting his fowls to roost upon the cherry trees, 
 (and thus not only expose them to the inclemencicR 
 of the weather, but lose in addition their very valua- 
 ble manure,) he would have given them a place of 
 shelter and by that means secured their comfort and 
 productiveness, as well as their excrement. 

An orchard of young apple trees was almost en- 
 tirely destroyed by the borei — the fences that en- 
 closed his meadows were in a ruinous condition. — 
 Several hogs were actively engaged in turning up the 
 sod, and as we attempted to close the gate that led 
 from the main road to the house, we found it wholly 
 impracticable, one hinge being completely torn ofl', 
 the other so twisted as to render the effort vain. — 
 Want of time prevented further observation, but we 
 had seen enough to satisfj' us, that the careful pern- 
 sal of any good agricultural journal, and a practical 
 application of some of the hints contained in it, 
 would have been hundreds of dollars value to 
 over-wlsc farmer.
