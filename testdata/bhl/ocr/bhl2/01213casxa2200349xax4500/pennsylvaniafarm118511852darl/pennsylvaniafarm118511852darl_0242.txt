expressed themselves highly pleased with the contest. 
 We regard this match as one of the utmost import- 
 ance, upon which may l:e built a prouder reputation 
 for Lancaster co. than she even now possesses. Its 
 complete success, and tlie deep interest felt in regard 
 to it throughout the entire county, has served to dis- 
 pel the erroneous impression, that there was not a 
 spirit amongst her farmers, to encourage such a con- 
 test. We kiew better, and we now predict that next 
 September one of tlie finest Agricultural County Ex- 
 hibitions in Pennsylvania, will be held at Lancaster. 
 It is already 'a fixed fact. The farmers have taken 
 hold of the matter themselves,and are determined to 
 permit no County in the Commonwealth to outstrip 
 the "Garden Spot" in spirited enterprise. 

The following were the successful competitors : 
 D. S. Herr, S40.— .James Boon, ?30.— Reuben 
 Weidler, §20.— Isaac Lantz, $10. — David Goeha- 
 neur, ijj. 

It is but justice to all the plowman to state, that 
 tlie judges had no little difficulty in deciding upon 
 their respective merits, and that their decision was 
 made in strict accordance with the publislied regula- 
 tions. 

We are indebted to a frienl for the following 
 spirited account of the supper of the Agricultural So- 
 ciety at Ilarrisburg. We wore present during the 
 early part of the oyoning, but felt too much fatigued 
 to remain during the wliole time. 
 The Baniiuet. 
 Tlie officers of the Society gave a closing banquet 
 on Friday evening to Hon. Andrew Stevenson, the 
 orator of the day, and other distinguished strangers 
 and invited gue.sts. The supper was furnished liy 
 Mr. Ilerr in his usual good taste. Owing to the lat - 
 ness of the hour fixed for the occasion, in the evening 
 of the last day of the exhibition, the company was 
 not as numerous as could have been wished. Many 
 had left for their homes, among th;m, we had to re- 
 gret the absence of E. P. Prentice, Esq., of Mount 
 Hope, B. P. Johnson, Esq., of Albany, who witli L. 
 G. Morris, Esq., of Mount Fordhani, composed the 
 deputation from the New York State Agricultural So- 
 ciety. Notwithstanding, a goodly number sat down 
 to table to discuss the provoking subjects laid before 
 them by their provident host, in the shape of roast 
 turkey, duck, partridge and other viands, with spark- 
 ling champagne and other eshilirating wines — to all 
 of which, in order and detail, the companj- addressed 
 themselves with a determination, that promised a 
 zealous and patriotic investigation, which throughout 
 the whole sitting never seemed to abate or flag, until 
 the whole bill of fare had been gone through. The 
 greatest order and good feeling prevailed, though now 
 and then there occurred some occasional cross firing, 
 and the popping up of some cork before it had leave 
 to speak, which brought out other corks calling the 
 delinquent to order, creating for a tim? a hubbub, 

which could only be allayed by letting thorn all pour 
 out, ad libitum, whatever they had to offer. These 
 little episodes were not only evanescent and amusing, 
 but seemed to produce more harmony and good hu- 
 mor, imparting a freshness and vigor, by way of 
 change and recreation, to the officers and managers, 
 who had toiled through a three days exhibition witli 
 all its attendant cares and anxieiies. 

The Hon. Frederick Watts, of Carlisle, President 
 of the Society presided, .supported by Vice President 
 James Gowen, of Mount Airy, Philadelphia county ; 
 Ex-Governor Porter was on the right of the President, 
 Governor Johnson being unavoidably detained at 
 home in business, the Hon. A. Stevenson of Virginia 
 on the left. The Board of Canal Commissioners, 
 with other invited guests were in charge of the Vice 
 Presidents. The following were among the regular 
 toasts, announced from the chair. 

" The President and constituted authorities of the 
 United States." 

" The Governor and constituted authorities of the 
 commonwealth of Pennsylvania." 

" Agriculture, Commerce, and Manufactures — 
 speed the plow that turns the furrow — the ship that 
 plows the wave — the shnttle that threads the woof." 

" The New York, Ohio aud Maryland State agri- 
 cultural societies, and other kindred associations 
 throughout the United States — May the only rivalry 
 found among them be, which can best promote tlie 
 great cause of agriculture," 

" The Coal and Iron fields of Pennsylvania — May 
 they soon be made to yield abundant and remuner- 
 ating harvests."

Americ.vn Cutlery. — It is truly gratifying to olj- 
 serve the progress, we, as a people, are making in 
 the various departments of arts and science. The 
 recent triumphs achieved by our countrymen at the 
 World's Fair, will doubtless be followed by beneficial 
 lesults, and will lead the way to still more creditable 
 productions. Amongst the many commendable spe- 
 cimens of skill and ingenuity which have recently 
 fallen under our notice, we know of none more de- 
 serving of notice, or in which the abilities of Ameri- 
 can workmen are more strikingly manifest, than in 
 the superior cutlery from the establishment of the 
 Watcrvillc JIanufacturing Companj'. Until within 
 a few years, the idea of competing with the English 
 cutlers was not to be thought of. Their superiority 
 was universally acknowledged, and felt and it is but 
 justice to them to say that the cutlery of England 
 well deserved the praise it received. Now, however, 
 l^ankee ingenuity arrays itself in opposition to Eng- 
 lish skill and a most formidable rival it is. We saw 
 a few days since a case of cutlery — fine knives prin- 
 cipally, designed for exhibition at our State Fair, 
 which for beauty of finish, elegance of design, and
