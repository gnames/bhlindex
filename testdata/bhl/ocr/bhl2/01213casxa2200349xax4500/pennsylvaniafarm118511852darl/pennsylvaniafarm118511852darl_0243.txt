goodness of quality, equals, we think, any English 
 cutlery wo have over seen. For several years past 
 we have used the pocket knives made by this enter- 
 prising company, and cheerfully testify to their fine 
 quality. We want no better for any purpose. Their 
 pruning knives are superior, and farmers will do well 
 to examine them when about making a purchase. 

To Contributors. 

As the present number of our Journal has been 
 somewhat delayed by the State Fair, we hope our 
 contributors will bear the fact in mind, and forward 
 at as early a day as practicable the articles intended 
 for the December number. At the same time we 
 take occasion to repeat our requast to our friends to 
 favor us with articles for our columns. AVe want 
 facts^the experience and observations of our practi- 
 cal formers. Do not let the fact that you are not in 
 the habit of writing for publication deter you from 
 attempting it. Give us the outlines and we will put 
 them in shape. If men of observation and experi- 
 ence but know how much they could aid us in our 
 efforts to spread broadcast throughout our StatS val- 
 uable agricultural information, they would certainly 
 lend a helping hand. A fact worth five dollars to one 
 farmer, is equally valuable to another, and may be to 
 ten thousand. We therefore repeat it, send along 
 the documents and we will circulate them. 

Tillingh.vst's Premium CnuRN. — One of these ex- 
 cellent churns has been left at our oiBee by the pa- 
 tentee. During the State Fair we had an opportunity 
 of witnessing its operations. Excellent butter was 
 churned with it in seven and a half minntes, in the 
 presence of the Committee on Agricultural Imple- 
 ments, and we are assured by the proprietor, that this 
 can be done at any time. The body of the churn is 
 of the Ohio Iron Stone ware, most beautifully finish- 
 ed, and admirably adapted to that great essential in 
 butter making — cleanliness. We shall be glad to 
 show the churn to thoso who desire it, leaving them 
 to test more fully its merits. 

Worthy of ImUation. 

Wg are pleased to learn that the Bucks county Ag- 
 ricultural Society, at their last exhibition, sulistituted 
 the Farm Journal on their list, for the dollar usually 
 given as a premium for certain articles. If the same 
 plan were pursued by every other Agricultural society 
 in Pennsylvania, our list would be largely increased. 
 Our Bucks county friends h.ave our warmest thanks 
 for their kindness. We will endeavor to deserve it. 

Superior Flour. — We are indebted to Sir. Benj. 
 Snavely of Lancaster county, for a barrel of superb 
 White Wheat Family Flour, manufoctured at Stoll's 
 Steam Mills, Lancaster City. We have tried it in 
 various ways, and think it superior to any flour we 
 have ever used in our family. If Mr. S. supplies all 

his customers with an article of such quality, we im- 
 agine there are few complaints. StoU's Mills were 
 put in operation last spring, and now supply an ex- 
 cellent article of Farina, as well as all the products 
 of grist mills generally, and we are pleased to leam 
 are well patronized. 

Reply of Mt. Bumstead. 

RoxDOROUGU, Oct. 7, 1851. 

Mr. Editor: — In the last number of the Farm 
 Journal, jou call for an explanation of the " extrava- 
 gant statement " in my letter, in my ktt3r as pub- 
 lished in Dr. Kerr's recent work on Poultry. 

If you will examine the letter as there given, j'ou 
 will find, that what constitutes the pith of the para- 
 graph has been (unintentionally no doubt,) left out 
 in the extract. The sentence from which the extract 
 is made, is as follows: " Tell our Pennsylvania farm- 
 ers that one Rooster and two hens of the Shanghai 
 breed, will give them more eggs in three months time, 
 of a greater size and richer qualif;/, than five times 
 that number of ordinary hens will do in one year 
 and will hatch out a finer brood, with less trouble 
 and more certainty, than any fowls they have hereto- 
 fore possessed." 

The meaning of the paragrapli is, that two AVhitc 
 ShanghM hens, with the attendance of a good cock , 
 of the same breed, will lay more eggs of a larger size 
 and riclier qiialili/, than five times the number of or- 
 dinary hens will do in one year; or, that so many 
 hens of the ordinary breed will not lay as many egga 
 of the same size and qualifi/. " 

That the sentence may admit of a different con- 
 struction and such as might mislead those unacquain- 
 ted with the habits of fowls, the writer willingly con- 
 cedes. For this inadvertence he has no apology to 
 offer. If, unfortunately, it has fallen into such hand?, 
 he has only to practise the duty he has taught to 
 others, to confess their foults and make such expla- 
 nation as the facts require. 

Ho thinks, however, that there is some palliation 
 for the supposed error, arising from the fact, that the 
 letter was not designed for publication entire ; but 
 was furnished as a reference for the author of the 
 book to glean some facts from, in relation to the 
 Sh.anghaj breed of fowls, lie feels indebted to the 
 editor of that work, for his kindness in inserting his 
 letter entire, which was not expected, or he should 
 have wi'itten the whole with a more careful construc- 
 tion. 

So far as it regards the present extract, the writer 
 embraces the only and the earliest opportunity which 
 he has had, or could have, to correct the supposed 
 error. Trusting that it may be received as a satis" 
 factory explanation, by you and the readers of your 
 Journal, I am with due respect, 
 Yours, &c., 

Saml. a. Bumstead.
