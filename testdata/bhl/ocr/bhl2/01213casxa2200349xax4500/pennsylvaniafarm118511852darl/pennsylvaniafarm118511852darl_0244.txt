[November, 

I^ist of Articles 

Exhibited at (he Slate AgricuUural Fair at Harris- 
 hnrg, together with the names of exhibitors and place 
 of residence. 

We have been at consideraHe pains and expense 
 to procure a full and complete list of all the articles 
 esliiljited at the State Fair, with the names of the 
 contributors. 

It will be more interesting, years hence, than at the 
 present time, as it will servo to show the advance 
 Pennsylvania makes in her Agricultural exhibitions. 
 Our limits for the present month are too narrow to 
 give the list complete ; we shall conclude it in our 
 next.
