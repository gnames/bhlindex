Special lleport : The Committee on Plants and 
 Flowers report, that on the 28th August last, they 
 yisited Spring Brook farm, the Country seat of Caleb 
 Cope, and exaniinsd the wonder of the vegetalile 
 kingdom, the far famed Victoria regia. Without en- 
 tering into an elaborate description, your Committee 
 lieg leave to say, that they found the plant growing 
 in a circular tank, some 24 feet in diameter, in a 
 beautiful and costly house, constructed expressly for 
 its growth and display. At the time of our visit, the 
 plant exhibited five mature leaves and one embryo 
 leaf, all floating on the surface ; the mature leaves 
 measured feet and 5 inches in diameter, they are 
 perfectly round, some of them have the margin turn- 
 ed up, presenting a most singular appearance. In col- 
 our they are a beautiful light green, the underside of 
 the leaves with their immense rope-like foot stalks is 
 of a dark purple hue, and literally covered with 
 strong spines, inclming, to the centre of the leaf. — 
 The embryo leaf with its array of dark spines pre- 
 sents a formidable aspect and from the singular 
 manner in which it is folded up, is not the least cxi- 
 rious part of this superb Water Lily. The flower is 
 immense, rising a few inches above the surface to 
 display its many pure white petals, it is beautiful. As 
 the expansion proceeds, it assumes in the inner pe- 
 tals, a fine rose color, it is then magnificent. The 
 flower when expanded, measured seventeen inches in 
 diameter. 

From the germination of the seed on the 10th of 
 .Vpril, until the first inflorescence of the pdant on the 
 21st August was but a period of a little over four 
 months. When we consider that the plant was entire- 
 ly unkno-wn in this country, its habits but partially 
 understood, and its cultivation a mystery, we are sur- 
 prised at the success of the experiment. 

Your Committee are proud that the first flowering 
 i>f this Queen of Aquatics in the United States was 
 produced by the liberality and munificence of a mem- 
 ber of the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society : 
 a.side from which, the influence to be expected from so 
 raunifieent'an expenditure in the field of Horticul- 
 ture, will give a new impulse to persons of wealth — 
 the example set will create a desire to do likemse. 

Y'our Committee recommend that the Society's 
 Gold Medal be awarded to Caleb Cope, for his libe- 
 rality in having brought to mature growth the Victo- 
 ria regia, to which the Society unanimously assented. 

The reports of the Committees of Superintendence 
 and tlio Committees appointed to award premiums at 
 the twenty-third Exhibition were read, and the spe- 
 cial awards approved of. The Committee on flowers 
 and designs recommended a special premium of 
 twenty-flve dollars to -John Ellis, gardener to Caleb 
 Cope, for skill shown in'cultivating the Victoria regia.

West PniLAOELPniA, Sept. 25. 1851. 
 The recond annual exhibition of the Hamilton 
 Horticultural exhibitiou which has just closed, ex- 
 ceeded in every respect the expectations of its most 
 sanguine friends. The drought which has prevailed 
 in tlie surrounding country during the past summer, 
 so dried up all vegetation, that it was judged by 
 many inadvisable to hold an exhibition, notwithstand- 
 ing which, the society determined to do the best they 
 could towards having one, and they succeeded hand- 
 somely, and very creditably to themselves and their 
 numerous contributors. 

There not being in all Wes' Philadelphia a public 
 hall largo enough to accommodate such an exhibi- 
 tion, the Society accepted Mr. N. B. Browne's kind 
 oSer of his house and grounds, which are admirably 
 adapted for the purpose. The eyes of the numerous 
 visitors were feasted with a profusion of the products 
 of the earth in endless variety — from tho mastodon 
 pumpkin to the potato of half an inch in diameter — 
 from Mr. Cope's gigantic leaf of Victoria Regia to 
 the humblest specimen of pot plant, all arranged 
 with the greatest possible taste and iieauty. Boquets 
 in great abundance and every conceivable shape and 
 size, and several very large and handsome designs 
 of cut flowers, betokened that the society was under 
 groat obligations to the fair sex. So tempting was 
 the display of fruits as to cause innumerable breaches 
 of the tenth commandment, and not a few of the 
 eighth, as was evident from tho diminished state of 
 some of the baskets after the exhibition. So far as 
 we could learn, every one of tlie visitors went away 
 gratified, and every thing passed off with tho greatest 
 order and harmony. 

The previous exhibition of this infant society was 
 held in September, 1850, at the house of Wm. W. 
 Keen, Esq., its Vice President, and though a very 
 handsome display, was surpassed by this one. 

It is expected that tho Odd Follows Hall which 
 has just been commenced, will be finished in time for 
 tho next autumnal exhibition, so that the society will 
 not again be compelled to trespass on private gener- 
 osity. T. 

We are indebted to the Hon. Thomas Ewbank, 
 Commissioner of Patents, for a copy of the Patent 
 Office Report for 1850-51, and to the Hon. Thaddeus 
 Stevens for a similar favor. We have also received 
 several parcels of wheat from the Patent Office which 
 we have placed in the hands of excellent farmers.
