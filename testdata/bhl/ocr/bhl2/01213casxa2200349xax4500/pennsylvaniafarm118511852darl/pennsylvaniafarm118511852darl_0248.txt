A Practical Trealine on Manures. From tlic rcccn'' 
 publication of tlio British Society for the diffusion 
 of Useful Knowledge ; with Additional notes by 
 the American Editor. Philad. E. S. Jones & Co. 
 pp. 204. 

A.S manures must be derived from mineral, vegeta- 
 ble, or animal substances, a treatise vrhich is devoted 
 U> the subject in its three dep.artments can be used in 
 every country, no matter where it was originally 
 printed, — thus difForing from those books on agricul- 
 tural subjects which must be adapted to the circum- 
 stances of each locality. This book therefore, al- 
 though prepared ander the auspices of a celebrated 
 English society, goes so fully into the various branch- 
 es of the suliject, American farmers will find much in 
 it exactly to their purpose — and they do not require 
 to bo told how much depends upon judicious manur- 
 ing. 

The book is valuable, because besides giving an 
 account of an infinity of manures adapted to various 
 localities, it gives directions for employing them to 
 tlic best advantage. 

The subject is divided into eighteen chapters the 
 contents of which are stated in such a manner as to 
 wiable the reader to find what he wants, without 
 reading large portions of the whole. 

The mechanical execution is creditable, and the 
 book will bo a valuable addition to the library of the 
 farmer.

Mr. .Steveusou's Address. 
 At the moment of going to press we received a 
 copy of the address delivered before the State Agri- 
 cultural Society at Ilarrisburg. We regret that we 
 have neither time to speak of its merits, nor space for 
 it in our columns. Better judges than ourselves 
 speak highly of it, and we have no doubt that it is a 
 document that will be read with interest and profit 
 by every farmer in Pennsylvania.
