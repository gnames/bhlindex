AGKTCULTUKAL ADDRESS. 

[December 

time, two sentiments of a lively nature ! lie probably 
 spoke tlie truth ; for, purrounded by scenes for the 
 last three days, which might well have justified vari- 
 ous emotions of the most animated and delightful na- 
 ture, one alone seems to have occupied my mind and 
 h'^art: namely, that of deep and heartfelt gratitude! 
 And here let me congratulate the Society and every 
 friend of agriculture, upon the character of their 
 great exhibition; and the auspicious circumstances 
 i;nder which it has taken place ; and whilst it may 
 be true that you have not for the first time, Mr. Pre- 
 sident, made a display equal to the many imposing 
 and praiseworthy spectacles of a similar character 
 which for some years past have distinguished many 
 cf your sister States of the north and east, and Mary- 
 land in the south, (and few, if any, are before her,) 
 you have had enough to aiford great encouragement 
 and promise of better things hereafter. Your exhi- 
 bition, as a first effort, has been remarkable; and 
 does great honor to your Society and the State at 
 largo. Indeed, to have witnessed such an assemblage 
 of enlightened and patriotic men, brought together 
 from all parts of your own State, as well as from 
 those adjoining, for purposes so lofty and patriotic ; 
 acting spontancoutly and harmoniously togetlier, 
 with no collision of antagonist interests, and apart 
 from all political and party considerations, was de- 
 lightful and refreshing, as well to the feelings as the 
 intellect. Mr. President, in times like these, after 
 such scenes of excitement into which Pennsylvania 
 lias lately been thrown, and especially on such occa- 
 sions as this, it ie good to inhale an atmosphere neith- 
 er agit.ated by the din of controversy, nor tainted 
 with party polemics — and when, moreover, wo consi- 
 der the objects which brought together such an as- 
 sembly — the place of meeting, (the metropolis of this 
 old and renowned Commonwealth,) a State not less 
 famed for its love of lil)ertT and order, than for its 
 general intelligence; for its devotion to literature and 
 science, and above all, for that sober, calm, reflecting 
 pense which, without abating the energies of popular 
 feeling, directs it in its legitimate course, by peacea- 
 ble and patriotic means, to the attainment of safe and 
 legitimate ends ; it cannot fail to make a deep and 
 lasting impression upon the hearts of all present, and 
 8nd give token of the successful advancement of the 
 great objects for which your Society has been fiamied. 
 AVhat American could witness the scenes which have 
 transpired here within the last three days, and not 
 feel deeply impressed and elevated? Whose bosom 
 did not throb witli exultation ? What Pennsylvanian 
 did not feel proud in being the citizen of such a State? 
 1 wish most sincerely, that not only the good people 
 of your own State, Jlr. President, but every farmer 
 and planter of America, could have been here, and 
 witnessed your proceedings — hallowed by such large 
 and liberal and patriotic views as those that animated 
 the bosoms of the thousands tiiat were present, and 
 participated in your fostivities I 

Then would there come from every hill-top and 
 valley of this vast confederacy, a response not unlike 
 the Macedonian cry of old, inspiHog the timid with 
 courage, and stirring up the spirits of the boldest 
 friends of agriculture ! 

It is not my purpose, Mr. President, upon this oc- 
 casion, to enter at all into the minute details of prac- 
 tical tarming, or the manner of cultivating the vari- 
 ous and diversified soils of a State like Pennsylvania. 
 This would be a field of endless extent, and as un- 
 suitable to an addre.ss of the character I am about to 
 deliver, as to the objects of your society. Into such 
 a field I shall not enter. If, therefore, the value of 
 an Agricultural address is to be tested alone in pro- 

portion as it may convey information, apjilicable tr> 
 mere details of every day farming, I shall fail in ih? 
 efiijrt I am about to make on tliis occasion. Indeed, 
 without personal knowledge w acfiuaintance with the 
 various soils and lands of a State like vours, or ot 
 the prevailing modes of cultivation, of which I r.m 
 ignorant; how could it be expected, or desired, th.it I 
 should occupy the attention of such an audience, com- 
 posed of so many enlightened and practical farmers, 
 by entering into the details and routine of ordinary 
 farming operations ? These more properly belong tc> 
 the various auxiliary societies of your State, to whcmi 
 they can more safely bo contiijed. My purpose will 
 be one wholly different, and of a more enlarn-ed and 
 general character. I shall, in the first place, make a 
 brief examination of agriculture, in connection with 
 with the other great branches of national industry, 
 and maintain its importance and pre-eminence in a 
 national point of view. Secondly — I shall attempt 
 to show that the prosperity and existence of the old 
 Atlantic States, and especially Pennsylvania, Dela- 
 ware, Maryland and Virginia, must hereafter mainly 
 depend upon restoring and increasing the fertility of 
 their lands, and the amount of their productions ; or 
 they must consent to abandon them. And thirdly — 
 That the only means of accomplishing this, will be 
 by a system of improved and scientific cultivation ; 
 by placing the agriculture of the country upon its 
 true basis, and raising the agricultural classes to a 
 higher and more elevated standard ! If I can suc- 
 ceed in doing this, I shall have obtained all I desired, 
 in this address, and all that the society could reason- 
 ably expect. 

Of the importance and value of agriculture, few, I 
 presume, are now disposed to doubt, whatever their 
 opinions may be as to their relative merits compared 
 with commerce and manuf;icturos ! That, whether 
 we consider agriculture as an art, or in its effects 
 upon the moral, social, or political character of our 
 government and people, in America, at least, it must 
 be regarded as forming the foundation upon which 
 our prosperity and free institutions must ever repose I 
 To maintain this, it may be necessary to contrast 
 agriculture with the other branches of national in- 
 dustry, here and elsewhere, as sources of national 
 wealth and greatnes.s; and follow it up with a sum- 
 mary review of the agricultural condition and capa- 
 city of most of the Atlantic States, and the means 
 they possess for high and improveil farming. This, 
 however, I am aware, is a subject upon which there 
 may be, and are, various opinions. Political writers, 
 in aU ages, have differed more or less with respect to 
 the true sources of the wealth of nations — some as- 
 cribing it to agriculture; some to commerce and man- 
 ufactures ; and others to labor and capital employed 
 in all these. But yet all admit, that whilst manu- 
 factures improve, commerce gives value, and labor 
 and capital stimulate, it is agriculture alone that ori- 
 ginates ! Conflicting, however, as these opinions may 
 have been, and still are, with respect to these hypo- 
 theses, all political economists concur in opinion that 
 whatever may be the value imparted by the labor and 
 ingenuity of man, the earth is the parent and foun- 
 tain of them all. That agriculture is the art by which 
 these productions are multiplied, so as to meet the 
 wants of civilized man, and which are common to all 
 — to the agriculturist, to the manufacturer and sea- 
 man, as well as to the artist, the statesman, and man 
 of letters — and as all equally derive their origin from 
 the cultivation of the earth, all must be equally de- 
 pendent upon it for sustenance. Regarding it then 
 as the basis of all other arts, it justly claims pre-emi- 
 nence over all others ; and such is its connection with
