all the comforts of the luimaii race, that it mayjustly 
 l>e eakl, in a political jidiiit of view, that agriculture 
 ia the only firm and stable foundation of national 
 greatness ! 

But, Mr. President, Tve all know that nations, as 
 well as individuals, are too often governed by exter- 
 nal appearances and first impressions, until philoso- 
 phy and science, by teaching men to think, enable 
 them to trace effects to their true causes, and assign 
 to them their relative importance; and henoe it is, 
 that Commerce, from the display it makes before tlie 
 world, has oft-en been considered the first and great- 
 est agent in the production of national wealth ; and 
 manufactures next; whilst modest and peaceful agri- 
 culture, hidden in the privacy of the cuuntry, is neg- 
 lected or forgotten ; or remembered only to be under- 
 rated, and, might I not say, too often despised! And 
 what though it does perform its labors in retirement, 
 and out of view of the busy multitude ? What though 
 the arts throng the cities and the public haunts of 
 men ? What though commerce hoists its gaudy flag, 
 spreads its swelling sails, and traverses the globe? 
 These belong not to the peaceful calling of the hus- 
 bandman; and for one I rejoice that they do not. — 
 And yet, in saying this, I do not mean to speak dis- 
 paragingly of commerce ! Far, very far from it. I 
 tnow that civilization and liberty have ever been iden- 
 tified with the history of commerce. It is not only 
 the patron of art and science, but every where the 
 friend of liberty and religious toleration. No man 
 admires more the enterprise and couunercial spirit of 
 our country than I do, or can Ijc more willing to do 
 it honor. Its spirit, moreover, is peaceful, and that 
 gives it additional claims to favor. It is true, that 
 when we cast our eyes back a century ago, when 
 agriculture had fallen from its high estate, we find 
 the cultivation of the soil formed the occupatiou, al- 
 most exclusively, of the humbler orders of the peo- 
 ple, without knowledge or capital to enable them to 
 improve it. Nor was it until political economy as- 
 sumed the form of a sck'nce, and caused rulers and 
 statesmen to be more sensible of the value and im- 
 portance of an improved state of agriculture, that it 
 attracted more attention from the better informed 
 and wealthier classes of society, and exciting the 
 energies of the learned and scientific attracted that 
 consideration which its importance so justly merited. 
 This great work first commenced in Europe, and 
 more particularly in England and Scotland, and no- 
 thing had such a powerful effect in attracting to it 
 public patronage and support, as practical science 
 and the establishment of Agricultural societies and 
 associations. These were the levers that first put 
 the ball in motion, and placed agriculture, as an art, 
 upon its true and ancient basis. 

Then it was that patriotic men of rank, fortune 
 and talents, gave to it their attention and by personal 
 OKamplo, drew to themselves the regard and support 
 of that class of people who had the means of conduct- 
 ing improvements upon the most enlarged and liberal 
 scale, and the Board of British Agriculture was es- 
 tablished. This was principally brought about by 
 the labors of a few distinguished individuals, at 
 whose head was Sir -John Sinclair, an able and en- 
 lightened projector, and a friend of Washington. — 
 And then commenced a new era in agriculture, not 
 only in England and Scotland, but throughout a part 
 of Europe. This Board, whilst it served as a centre 
 of information to agriculturists, performed the same 
 office to the British Government, and pointed out the 
 means of prosperity and safety to the nation. And 
 here allow me to say that it was under the combined 
 influence of this Board, and the numerous societies 

which were afterwards established throughout Eng- 
 land and Scotland, that agriculture became inspired 
 with a new spirit and activity. Men of science, and 
 political philosophers, began to examine and analynji 
 with deeper scrutiny the sources of Britain's power, 
 and then it was ascertained that wide-spread as hot- 
 commerce, and extended as her manufactures were, 
 it was to her skilful agriculture, more than to both 
 the other great interests, that England was indebted 
 for the support of her colossal system of public cre- 
 dit — a system that enabled her to breast the flood of 
 Europc^'s rage; and roll back its waves upon the tv'- 
 rant, who had disturbed the peace, and at one tiiil j 
 threatened the liberties of the world ! 

For this we h&fc. Jirf.t the statistical results of th's 
 taxes levied by Great Britain during her war with 
 France; and, secondhj, the authority of Napokon 
 himself, and Sir John Sinclair. Upon referring to 
 the statistics of England, we find that the proceed.s 
 of the tax alone imposed upon the proprietors and 
 occupiers of land, amounted to six and a half mil- 
 lions of pounds: whilst the whole product from all 
 other classes, (including merchants, manufacturers, 
 office holders and professional men, &c.,) was only 
 between three and four millions; less than one hall 
 the .amount received from the agricultural classes, 
 whilst the number of proprietors and oi-i-upicrs ol 
 land, who came within the operation of the inconio 
 tax, was three times as large as that fjf all other 
 classes. And here I will ask you to refer to the er- 
 rors into which some of the public writers of Europe, 
 and more particularly France, seem to have fallen w* 
 to the true sources of U. Britain's wealth. They seem 
 to take it for granted that the principal part of her 
 industry is devoted to the manufacturing of goods for 
 foreign markets. Tliis is not so. 

From the late official returns of her Board of Trade, 
 it appears that the total value of exports of principal 
 articles of British and Irish manufactures, for the 
 year 1849, was only fifty- eight millions of pounds, 
 including the value of the raw material, which, in re- 
 lation *o many important articles of British export, 
 was of foreign production. Now, this sum is litth; 
 less than one eighth of the whole productive wealth 
 of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland 
 of which three hundred millions according to one of 
 her ablest st.atists, is annually created from the culti- 
 vation of the soil. Here then is the startling fact, 
 that nearly fifteen hundred millions of dollars arc 
 wrung from a soil possessing inferior advantages fo 
 those of your own State, Mr. President, and especially 
 those of New York and Ohio, and I might add, Vir- 
 ginia. Well then might it be said, that in England's 
 darkest hour, when invasion threatened her coasts 
 and her shock-gathering perils appalled the merch- 
 ants and fund holders of the kingdom; where, but 
 among the yeomanry of the land were found the stojjt 
 hearts and sb'ong arms that presented an impassaU^t 
 barrier to her foes ? 

On this subject. Sir -John Sinclair, in one of hi.* 
 addresses to the conveners of Scotland, which I hold 
 in ray hand, [as late as 1820] says: " I have lorkg 
 been endeavoring, in concurrence with a number ot 
 respectable friends to promote the interests and pros- 
 perity of agriculture. But unless some great exer- 
 tions are made, all our past efforts will have been in 
 vain ; I augur, however, better things for the fiiture. 
 It has proved during the late war with France that 
 national prosperity founded ou the liasis of agricul- 
 ture, was solid and efficient. The cause of agricul- 
 ture saved England from the yoke of Napoleon.'' — 
 And let us hear what he thought of this matter. £ 
 have seen it stated in some of the memoirs of his lii^
