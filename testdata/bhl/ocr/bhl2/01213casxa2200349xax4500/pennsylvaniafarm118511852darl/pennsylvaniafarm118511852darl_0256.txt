AGRICULTURAL ADDRESS. 

[December-, 

i!i:it he was in the habit of reading the reports of the 
 British Boarils of Agriculture with great attention, 
 and particuhivly those of Scotland, in relation to 
 wiiieh, he is rejwrtcd on one occasion to have said : 
 That the Scotch •griciilturists had made their coun- 
 try, which was one of the most sterile, one of the 
 most fertile in all Europe, and that they were the 
 rin-ht arm of the Britisli government, and but for their 
 exertiens he should have been enabled to have over- 
 thrown England.' " 

And yet, Creat Britain did little or nothing for her 
 agriculture and rural economy until within the last 
 century; and in fact never bronght this great branch 
 of national industry and wealth to any perfection un- 
 t after the establishment of her British Board of 
 jVn-riculture, and those numerous associations scat- 
 tered throughout the whole kingdom. And here I 
 cannot do better than to refer to the opinion of Gen. 
 "Washington, as to the importance and value of this 
 board and of agricultural education. When the first 
 lioard of agriculture was established. Sir John Sin- 
 clair forwarded to General Wasliiiigton the proceed- 
 ings of the board, with a diplor.ia constituting him 
 an"honorary member. In a letter of thanks of the 
 10th July, IT'Jo, he says: — "From the first intima- 
 tion which you were pleased to give mo of this insti- 
 tution, I conceived the raost favorable ideas O'f its 
 utility, and the more I reflected on the plan since, 
 the more convinced I am of its import.ince in a na- 
 tional point of view, not o-uly to your own country 
 but to all others which are not too much attached to 
 old and bad habits to forsake them, and to new conn- 
 tries which are just ln'ginning to form systems for the 
 improvement of their husbandry." 

"In another letter he says: "I have read with 
 pleasure and approbation the work you paitronise ; 
 6>o much to your own honor and the utility of the 
 public; such a general view of the agriculture of 
 lireat Britain cansiot fail to 1* beneficial to the agri- 
 cultHr:\l interests of your country and tr> those of 
 every other where they are read, and must er>title 
 vou to their warmest thanks for having set such a 
 plan on foot. I am much pleased with it myself and 
 pray you to have the goodness to direct your book- 
 sellers to continue to forward them to me. I know 
 of no pursuit in which more yeal and important ser- 
 vice can be );endered to any eouuti-y than by improv- 
 ing its agriculture, its breed of useful aniaials and 
 other liranches of husbandry — nor can I conceive any 
 plan more conducive to this end than the one you 
 have introduced, bringing to view the actual state 
 of those in all parts of the kingdom, by which good 
 ssnd bad habits are exhibited in a manner too plain 
 t« be misconceived, for the accounts given to the 
 board of agriculture appear in general to be drawn 
 in a masterly manner, so as to answer the expecta- 
 tions formed in the plan which produced them, af- 
 fording a fund of information useful in political eco- 
 nomy-^serviceable in all countries;" and again: "it 
 will be some time I fear, before an Agricultural So- 
 ciety will be established in thi.s country. We must 
 walk as other countries have done, before we run. 
 Smaller societies must prepare the way for greater, 
 Ijut with the lights befo'-e us, I hope we shall not be 
 so slow in maturation as other nations have been. — 
 An attempt as you will perceive liy the enclosed out- 
 lines of a plan is making to establish a State Society 
 in Pennsylvania for agricultural improvements. If 
 it succeeds it will be a step in the ladder; — at present 
 it is too much in embryo to decide on the result." 

Well, Mr. President, your State has at last suc- 
 ceeded in being able to run, after walking half a 
 century. It was just fifty-seven years since this let- 

ter was written, announcing the attempt to form a 
 State Agricultural Society, before it was accom- 
 plished. 

Kather a longer walk I dare to say, than General 
 Washington had imagined. But it has come at last, 
 and I hope with healing on its wings, to the honor of 
 your State, and her patriotic sons. 

N"ow he-re is authority, that even the most iDvete^ 
 rate of cor unscientific friemls wilt be disposed to 
 respect. Allow me in connexion 'vvith those letters 
 of General Wiishiagton, to express a singlo thought. 

What a singuJar and ren>arksble occnrronee, that 
 a man in such rm CKalted sitnation. (and that man 
 Washington) with all tho cares and responsibilities 
 of the chief magistracy of such a nation npan hiitt. 
 should have hied the tinjo and iRclinartioD to writ,? 
 with his own hand, so nvany arN] such long letters,t.'> 
 a total stranger,, in a foreign land, upxm- th^e valucv 
 and iraportainee, and deMghts of Kural Agi-i^-utture. 

And then, again, how oinch more wonderfid is it 
 that a men like Najwleon Bonarpate, at the moment 
 he was planning his l)attles and marshalling his for- 
 ces to trample down the liberties of the world — in- 
 deed, amid the din of battle and the shonts of victo- 
 rious armies — should hare had Jeisure to be pouring 
 ©■ver the statistiral and agricwltoral i-eports of his. 
 enemy. Whait a proud tribute to the agricultural 
 advancement, both of Englan<l and America ! 

And now coming back to the subjec-t of these ear- 
 ly efforts to revive agricttltare, may it iK)t v\-ith truth 
 be said that it was to these associutioRS, acd to an 
 increasing taste for scientific farming tlia* the agri- 
 cultnre of all Europe was indel.>tod for its vast im- 
 provements and success. One of these associations, 
 I allude to the Royal sgrieultural Society of Eng- 
 land, formed only tt-m oi- tweJve years a:go, contains 
 nc-w move then ten thousand members, embracing 
 ever}' class, from the throne to the cottage, with am- 
 ple fauds to carry out all it.-* schemes for improve- 
 ment. And it i.* these associations and societies that 
 have contributed so largely to make England, so far 
 as agriculture is concerned, the garden of Europe ; 
 and I venture to say that there now exists withia 
 the British dominions » greatei- fund of solid ability 
 and scientific infornmtion, and :j large? variety of 
 active and efticient capital, thaa in aay ether country 
 upon earth of the same exteat and popAilatioa^ 

And to what Mr. President, are we to ascribe aH 
 this ; uot to so^il and elimarte certainly, because there 
 are few countries wHh a less propitions climate, less 
 genial sun, or natural richness of soil than- the Eng- 
 lish can boast. No I mo ! — it is to be foimd in thaA 
 fact that she surpassoss all other countries in the 
 universe ia the- art of cultivating land, ia judicious 
 cropping, in her systems of enekising, draining, ma^- 
 uuriug, and in the breeding of d^menticsnimalsjand 
 especially sheep and cattle. And such are the re- 
 sources growing oat of British industry, that with a 
 population one-third less than that of France, she ex- 
 ceeds her from eight hundred to a thousand millions 
 sterling capital employed in husbandry. Is it not 
 idle then, to suppose that any thing else can raainly 
 have contpibntcd to this, but agrietiltural knowledge 
 and education, practical science with all its discove. 
 lies, and the establishment of sscieties throughout 
 the whole kisgdom, and the efforts raada-to rouse up 
 the nation to regard agriculture ia ii» proper and 
 triae light ! 

It was because husbandry becaave the road to 
 wealth,, and power, and respectability. Hear what 
 has Ijeen recently said on this subject st one of the 
 annual meetings of the Royal Agricultural Society ". 

" The Society have the satisfaction at the close of
