AGRICULTURAL ADDRESS. 

2ei 

the year, of congratulating its members on the steady 
 advance of, the Society in the accomplishment of its 
 prospects aivd resources, amongst which it cannot fail 
 to allnde to the establishment of the nun)er(3us local 
 societies for the discussion of agricultural subjects 
 which have mainly originated from the attention 
 which the exertions «f this iSociety have attracted to 
 *he iiKprovements of Agri'cnltare, and which have 
 led to such great and boEeficial results, raid they 
 recommend that a chemical analysis of tlie plants 
 grown in different localities and soils throughout 
 the Kingdom shall be made at the expenses ci the 
 society, and funds were voted for that purpose. 

And what, Mr. President, would be the ?.ns\ver of 
 •our friends, the " uBscientifics and good enoughs," 
 ito this array of evidence in favor of agricultural edu- 
 <;ation and sciisice. That I suppose which Cincinna- 
 4us is reported to have given centuries ago — " We 
 jirefer the good old way." 

And if such \\e the relative importance of agricul- 
 ture m <.!reat i?ritain, whose commerce and manufac- 
 tures ai ■• <o extended, liow inKnitely more important 
 must it be to the agricultural classes in such a coun- 
 try as ours, whose territory extends now from the 
 Atlantic to the Pacific ! f mlccd, without running 
 into the errors of the economisr^ or adopting their 
 theos'ies, where on earth can the paramovint import- 
 since of this pursuit be so safely asserted as in the 
 iJnited States 1' Here the cultivation of the soil has 
 advantages over every othor portion of the globe, be- 
 cause so intimately connected with our national i'h;> 
 racter ajid our free institutions ; acting so powerfully 
 upon tlM" constitutions of our people! And if it be 
 true, as it has been supposed, that in regiuns like 
 Switzerland and America, whose mountains lift them- 
 selves to such vast elevations aljove the sea, the torch 
 of liberty burns with a purer and brighter lustre, and 
 the hardy spirit of freedom and independence of 
 thought and actioJi, more peculiarly Ijelong, then have 
 we advantages which no other nation on earth can 
 boast. And then if we look to your own State, and 
 snore especially to Xew York and 3Iarylaud, and to 
 the wh lie of New England, we shall the effects of 
 agricultural knowleilge and practical science, strong- 
 ly exemplified, though, as I shall in another part of 
 this attempt to show, that high as their impro\ements 
 may Ije, they are f;ir, very far below the standard it 
 ought to have reached, with the means and foeilities 
 they have had at their command. What, theti, shall 
 the conjectural scruples of the prophetic calculators 
 Jn our OWE country avail against this mass of practi- 
 cal evidence whicli three-fourths of a century have 
 accumulated ? Why, if the only effect of these socie- 
 ties and associations was to bring together the culti- 
 vators of the soil in the various portions of the Union : 
 awakening their attention to what had been done, 
 and what was doing elsewhere; leading them to an 
 interchange of views and feelings, and animating 
 them to enterprise and emulation, who is there (hat 
 doubts but that these societies rested upon an un- 
 questionable basis of utility? And why do these in- 
 dividuals who set themselves up against all scientific 
 and book-farming, as they call it, imagine that no- 
 tliing new is to be learned in the arts of life, and es- 
 jiecially in relation to the cultivation of the soil — 
 that agriculture has reached its goal? l>o thcyknow 
 that there is no obstacle to the march of mind and 
 improvement, so insurmountable as the conceit that 
 we are either wise or good enough: and that it is 
 t'lis .self-gratulation that so long closed the eyes of 
 enf(uirers and shut out the lights of knowledge as to 
 the cultivation of the earth ? Do they know, or have 
 t!iey forgotten that it was many thousand years after 

the world began, before it w.as known how to make a 
 plow? That Cincinnatus (n'ho is held up as their 
 great pattern for husbandry,) and who was satisfied 
 with the "good old way," turned up his land ■with 
 the limb of a tree for his plow, and a knot to it for a 
 coulter and share: and when the patriarchs were 
 grinding their corn with pe^t^ls and stones? — and 
 bye the Isye, it rany be within the recollection of some 
 who are now present, wlien this species of grinding 
 was resorted to in portions of the western country — 
 possibly in jiarts of Pennsylvania, which are now 
 filled with steam mills, and machinery of the most 
 costly kind? Why, how long has it been since the 
 use of the potato was found out and used? Need I 
 remind you, Mr, President, or this assembly, that it 
 w.as the ferocious soldier and liigottcd fanatic of Spain 
 who gave to the world this treasure, by transferring 
 the wild potatoes from the waters of La Platte, anil 
 the mountains of Chili to Europe : and in doing so 
 saved a larjje portion of the Old AVorld from the de- 
 solations of famine ? And how strong is the good- 
 ness of Cod, manifested every way? Yes — these 
 same hands which destroyed human life without 
 measure or mercy, gave to countless millions the 
 means of living: and moreipver, by the introduction 
 of the bark of Peru into medicine, removed from the 
 earth a desolating scourge which destroyed more 
 nations than the plagues of Egypt ! It has been well 
 said, that this is a period in which the fields of sci- 
 ence and useful knowledge are largely and success- 
 fully employed in a country where the means of cor- 
 rect information are as free as the air we breathe. — 
 A spirit of enquiry has gone abroad in every depart- 
 ment of science, an<l what may perhaps be justly 
 claimed as distinguishing the present age above for- 
 mer times, is the fact, that the lights of science have 
 been pressed into the aid of all the useful arts, and 
 no longer waste their strength in looking through 
 metaphysical disquisitions, for the discoverj- of truths 
 that have no practical use. Learning, thank God, is 
 no bmger subject to nnmopoly, but is actively en- 
 gaged in the service of the arts ; and what has hith- 
 erto been deemed the province of the schools, is now 
 the property of «// for the benefit of all ! And agri- 
 culture, that gloricius art, which was so long dogradcii 
 from its rightful place in the scale of human occupa- 
 tion, is now assuming its just rank; and the namo 
 ef farmer has ceased to carry to the mind the idea 
 of inferiority or dependence. It is no longer a plod- 
 ding art, but has bwome a science; in which all the 
 powers of the human mind have been called into ac- 
 tion, and the sources of mechanical power put in 
 ref|uisition to aid its progress and improvement. 

Chemistry, Botany, < rcology, Mineralogy, and the 
 principles of mechanical power, are no longer the 
 source of usidess experiment to the philosopher and 
 scholar, but have been jiressed into the service of 
 agriculture and manufactures, and every branch of 
 pnictical science, rendered subservient to satisfy our 
 wants and Uie gratification of a refined taste. We 
 live indeed in an eventful period ! An age of agita- 
 tion and progress — of b(rld ajid lofty intellect! The 
 who'e world seems to be undergoing change ! Events 
 pregnant with instruction and warning, and of a 
 .startling character, sut-cecd each other with a rapid- 
 ity that excites our special wonder ! There has been 
 no period since the commencement of the world, in 
 whii-h so many importsnt discoveries have been made 
 as within the last half century. I will take a few of 
 the most striking instances, for which I am indebted 
 to one of your own distingtiished journalists. Fifty 
 years ago, there was not a steamboat in'esistence, 
 and its application to machinery unknown; the first
