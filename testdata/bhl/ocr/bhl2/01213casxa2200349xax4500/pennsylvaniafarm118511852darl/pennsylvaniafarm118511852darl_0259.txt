AGRICULTURAL ADDRESS.

gle and unaided powers of each individual who cul- 
 tivates the soil can bring to it at least a reasonable 
 state of perfection. And then, again, we have an- 
 other class of persons, quite numerous, wlio, I re- 
 gret to say, unite in this war against agriculture. 

AVhy, Sir. President, every day presents the ex- 
 amplcof men of the highest mental endowment ; men 
 whoso talents and knowledge would render them ca- 
 pable of enlightening by their writings, and oharm- 
 mg by their eloquence^ who not only do nothing in 
 aid of this great constitutional bulwark of defence, 
 l)ut who ridicule and reproach those who are attemjit- 
 ing to rouse up the nation and the friends of agricul- 
 ture, to the dangers that threaten them. And yet, 
 how many of these men do we see devoting every 
 • faculty of their minds, and every hour of their lives, 
 to the allurements of what they regard as the digni- 
 ties and honors of life ? sacrificing the good of our 
 country, and their own substantial happiness, in 
 pursuit of shadows, or what may be regarded as 
 worthy enjoyments. And this, I feel no hesitation 
 in saying, is another and not the least of tlie evils to 
 which improved agriculture is doomed in our coun- 
 try, and where one is sometimes almost disposed to 
 think that if anew commandment had Ijeen given by 
 God. to hate the earth, it could not have been better 
 fulfilled than in some of these old States of our Union. 
 And then comes the danger of these obstacles becom- 
 ing more insuperable as we live on, and our passions 
 take a wider reach. And although we know from 
 experience that the deeper the bed of the torrent the 
 more impossible and difficult to change its current, 
 yet we must not despair or relax our eiforts in the 
 good cause : however agriculture may have been 
 (sorely punished it is to be hoped that it is not do- 
 voted. 

My confidence is iu the spirit of this agt of mope- 
 meiit, and when we see States and Empires, arts and 
 sciences, customs and manners, and laws and gov- 
 ernments feeling and acknowledging this inevitable 
 vicissitude and change, it is to be hoped that agricul- 
 ture alone is not to remain unchanged or unchange- 
 able. 

Nor will the change be confined to Agriculture. — 
 All the Alechanic Arts are asserting their rightful 
 <;laims under the influence of that public opinion 
 which is destined to govern the whole world — and 
 every profession and calling will soon be doomed to 
 acknowledgede the influence of practical science and 
 mechanical power. Mr. President, it has been said 
 that the man who ciiuld make two blades of grass 
 grow where only one grew before, was one of the 
 greatest benefactors of his species? And shall not 
 those who can introduce a new plant ; or eradicate a 
 destructive weed; who can teach us to improve our 
 djmestic animals or guard us against the ravages of 
 dc structivc insects, who has invented a new plow or 
 instrument of husbandry, or determined even an im- 
 proved angle to the mould board, be equally regarded 
 as benefactors of their country, and entitled to its 
 g-atitude? Why, sir, the memories of such men will 
 1)3 cherished and go down to posterity, when the 
 names of wariors and heroes, and statesmen and poli- 
 trcians, will be buried in eternal oblivion ? 

In this great battle of public opinion. Agriculture, 
 I trust, will be found in its proper place ; floating its 
 flag the highest .and its crew the boldest, to grajjple 
 ■with those events which seem to be hurrying us on 
 with an accelerated progress, that no human sagaci- 
 ty can forsee. 

And then again I would inquire, has Pennsylvania 
 no forests yet remaining to subdue ; no swamps to 
 drain; no tracts of waste and uuproduotiv*; lands ca- 

pable of improvemetit, and wanting notliing but the 
 plow, the hoe and the hod, to make them productive 
 and fruitful fields, • 

lias she no lands not under culture, but abandon- 
 ed as barren and desolate, and rarely* now troddea 
 by the foot of man or wild boasts, that might not 
 again be brought into successful cultivation? 

Are there no deserted habitations, falling into ruin, 
 no depopulation, no separation from friends and con- 
 nections, and erratic emigrants in search of new 
 homes, now places for their herds, now fields to skin 
 and exhaust as fast as ruinous cultivation can ac- 
 cumplish the work ? 

Has she no railroads, turnpikes or Viridges to erect 
 for facilitating further the internal and external com- 
 merce of such a State! 

If, sir, you feel any delicacy upon this subject, let 
 me appeal to every intelligent and candid yeoman of 
 your State to answer these enquiries, and say whetli- 
 er the agricultural condition of Pennsylvania is what 
 it ought to be! 

And if it be so, as I fear it may be, do the people 
 of this time-hvinored Commonwealth require to be CO!?- 
 vinced that means exist, and in abundance by whicii 
 these evils nRiy be arrested, their population and 
 power retained, their lauds restored, and rendered 
 more productive, and the comforts of life increased; 
 and that these means are within the reach of the great 
 body of the cultivators of her soil ? 

And here allow me, before I jjass from this branch 
 of the subject, to make one or two suggestions upon 
 the subject of Emigration to which I have just alluded, 
 and which ought to be regarded as one of vital im- 
 portance to the old States, and to none more so than 
 Pennsylvania and Virginia. 

Every hour of every day, we witness portions of 
 our population abandoning their homes, and friends, 
 for the terrestrial Paradise of the Emigrant — the 
 far West, This is au evil of a fearful character, and 
 should be arrested, .and all must see that this can 
 only be done by restoring the lands of the Atlantio 
 States to a high state of fertility, and liy improved 
 and scientific cultivation. 

Of the prospects and progress of our western breth- 
 ren I need say nothing here. Their destiny is fixefi, 
 and they are marching on to fulfil it with rapid strides 
 and richly do they deserve success. Indeed, every 
 path of human enterprise and improvement has been 
 explored by these wonderful people, with an energy, 
 foresight and industry worthy of the epoch, and of 
 admiration of the whole world, and no one rejoices 
 at it more than I do. But, Mr. President, we must 
 not consent to sacrifice ourselves, and these mothers 
 of States, to add to the strength and power of tliis 
 new country, covered with flourishing cities and towns 
 and filled with millions of the most industrious and 
 thriving population. 

If we have not the fertility of their lands, the'r 
 boundless plains, their trackless forests, and their 
 magnificent verdure, have we not our own advantages? 

Have we not bold and noble rivers, delightful cl'- 
 mates, and the more valuable productions of southern 
 suns? And then are there not other and stronger 
 considerations than those which operate on the em- 
 grant to bind us to our native land ? Are there not. 
 ties dearer to the heart than even gold or rich lands? 

Is it not the land of our birth; the homes of our 
 childhood? The habitations of our fathers for past 
 generations? Arc we not in tlio midst of the monu- 
 ments and graves of our Revolutionary Sages and Pa- 
 triots? 

Why, Mr. President, is this sacred relic of our pas 
 history, [hero Sir, Stevenson turned and put his hand
