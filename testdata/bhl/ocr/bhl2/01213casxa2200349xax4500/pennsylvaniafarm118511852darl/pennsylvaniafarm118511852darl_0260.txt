AGRICULTURAL ADDRESS. 

[Decembeh, 

upon the Spcakor's chair,] this chair, so long pre- 
 served with s>ioh jealous vigilance, which was occu- 
 pied by John Hancock when he' signed the Declara- 
 tion of Independence and removed from the old im- 
 mortal State House in Philadelphia to this splendid 
 liall, so dear to the hearts of I'ennsylvanians, and 
 may I not adil of every American ? The answer is 
 to be found in that principle of association, which 
 i-ompols us to look with interest upon the relics and 
 memories connected with great events or names of 
 renown, and which having come down to us from our 
 fathers will descend to future generations, increasing 
 in interest as they increase in years I And are these 
 monuments and memorials of past times, which ap- 
 peal to the best emotions of the human heart to avail 
 nothing? Are these hallowed sympathies of tender- 
 ness and veneration for our homes and country to bo 
 so easily broken, and when broken, forever? The 
 remedy is in our own hands, and we shall be false 
 to ourselves and our children if we fail to avail our- 
 selves of it — that rcmedj', I must again repeat, is in 
 restoring our lands to fertility, and in elevating the 
 agricultural classes — in scientific and high farming. 
 And here, Mr. President, let me say that Penn.sylva- 
 nia has other and most important interests, besides 
 lier agriculture, to urge her on in the course of im- 
 provement and enterprise, and these are to be found 
 in her vast mineral resources, and especially in her 
 mines of coal and iron. Indeed the possession of such 
 immense fields of coal within a reasonable distance 
 of the seaboard, may be regarded as a boon of ines- 
 timable value, and the main source to which she 
 nmst now look to elevate her to superiority as a com- 
 niorcial and manufacturing State. 

As late as 1840, one of her representatives in Con- 
 gress is reported to have said, that only fifty years 
 before, coal was unknown in the conntrj'; and that 
 it then gave employment to four millions of days 
 wcn'k annually. That it kept in movement a thou- 
 ^■and ships of one hundred tons each ; and afibrdcd a 
 nursery for the training of sis thousand seamen, who 
 '■arned three millions of dollars yearly! That it g.ave 
 circulation to a capital of fifty millions of dollars ! — 
 Kept in activity fifty thousand souls, who annually 
 consumed upwards of two millions worth of agricul- 
 tural products, and more than three and a half mil- 
 lions of dollars worth of merchandize ! What has 
 been the increase since '46, we can now only conjec- 
 ture ! What a field is opened here, Mr. President, 
 for enterprise, in such a State as Pennsylvania, in 
 all the branches of national industry and wealth I — 
 Why these hlaclc diamonds of her's alone, will prove 
 iif far more value than all the gold of California, or 
 the mines of Mexico. Is it not calculated to baffle 
 all speculation as to the point it is yet to elevate her! 
 And yet, would it not be passing strange that at 
 such a time at this, when skill, and zeal and industry 
 are pushing on all the other arts of civilized life to 
 their utmcjst perfection, that art which fill's the purse 
 and sustains the sword of the nations: the art by 
 which under God we live and move and have our be- 
 ing, should be the only neglected and despised in a 
 country like ours? Most sincerely do I wish that I 
 had the power of that victorious language, which 
 could carry deep and solid conviction upon tliis sub- 
 ject to the minds and hearts of every cultivator of 
 the soil, not only in your noble and patriotic State, 
 ))ut into every hole and corner of this vast confeder- 

acy ! 

Having in the earlier part of this address, referred 
 to the st^ite of English and Scotch agriculture, and 
 given estimates to show their increased productive- 
 ness from improved and scientific cultivation alone ; 

let me now, Mr. President, add one or two examples 
 from some of the smaller States of the Old World, 
 as to the wonderful results that have been wrought 
 by improving and fertilizing poor soils, and I select 
 from States whose agriculture has probably not re- 
 ceived the attention and consideration it merits. I 
 allude to Ireland and Belgium! And first as to Ire- 
 land! She, with a territory not mjre than half as 
 large as that of Pennsylvania or Virginia, certainly 
 not of \ew York, supports not only a population of 
 more than nine millions, but exports more than fifty 
 millions worth of products ! And when wo pass over 
 to Belgium, a comparatively small principality, we 
 find her sustaining an agricultural population of more 
 than three hundred and thirty to the square mile. — 
 Now Pennsylvania and Virginia, with a population 
 equally dense, could each sustain a population of 
 more tlum twenty millions, just by the same system 
 of farming and improved cultivation! 

M'CuUoch, in his great statistical work, in alluding 
 to the agriculture of Belgium, remarks: "That her 
 soil, artilirially enriched, produces more than double 
 the quiiiitity of wheat required for the consumption 
 of its i;iliabitants, amounting annually to more than 
 sixteen millions of bushels." 

No-s\' these statements, striking and marvellous as 
 they appear, are no doubt true, and then the inquiry 
 follows: — IIow is it all produced? The'answer is, by 
 improved and scientific cultivation, but especially in 
 the making and keeping of manures, and in the wise 
 and judicious application of them! Well may these 
 bo regarded as startling results and calculated to 
 carry conviction and confidence to every candid and 
 unprejudiced mind. And if such are the residts and 
 rewards of highly improved modern husbandry in the 
 Old World, let us see what are the losses sustained in 
 this new one of ours, from a totally different system 
 of farming and cultivating our lands, and no where 
 will the contrast be more apjdicable, than to our 
 own States of Peun.sylvania and Virginia, and a few 
 others which I need not name. In doing this, how- 
 ever, I shall need official and statistical data, and in 
 the absence of legal provisions in Pennsylvania for 
 procuring such statistical information, I must resort 
 to some other States that can furnish it. For this 
 purpose I shall select New York as an example, to 
 show the probaljle and estimated loss that is annual- 
 ly sustained from the impoverishment of soils and 
 the want of more improved cultivation. And her 
 case will be entirely applicable as well to Pennsylva- 
 nia as to most of the other old States. The census 
 of 1840 will be the basis of the calculation I am about 
 to submit, and for it I am indebted to one of the of- 
 ficial report.s of the Patent Office, a publication, by 
 the by, of great value, and containing a fund of the 
 most interesting information upon all branches of 
 national industry. 

Now, according to this statement, it appears that 
 New Y'orkhas twelve millions of acres of imtroved 
 LAND, cultivated by five hundred thousand laborers, 
 being an average of 24 or 25 acres to each laborer. — 
 Of these twelve millions one million is so calculated 
 as to become richer each succeeding year. It is in 
 the hands of some forty thimsand skilful farmers, who 
 take and read agricultural journals and papers, and 
 not only sustain, not only e great State Society, but 
 the numerous auxiliary societies scattered tlu-ough 
 that great Commonwealth — Empire, rather, let me 
 call it ! 

Three millions more of the twelve are so managed 
 as barely to hold their own in point of fertility 1 — 
 They belong to a class of farmers who, we are told, 
 do as well as tliey can from personal observation, and
