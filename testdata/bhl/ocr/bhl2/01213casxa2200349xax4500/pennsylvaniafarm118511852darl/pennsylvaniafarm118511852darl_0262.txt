AGRICULTURAL ADDRESS. 

[DECEMnEH, 

nurse of oartlily happiness ? Whore can man indulge 
 his love for nature, or render greater benefits to his 
 fellow men, undisturbed by envy or prejudice, or the 
 vanities of the world, than in the retirement of the 
 country, and seeking the bread of industry by the 
 sweat lit his brow iu cultivating the soil? 

And is it true that agriculture has fallen from its 
 high estiitt', to one of a low and grovelling character? 
 Neviir had it a right to stand higher, even in the 
 palmiest days of Roman greatness ! And do they, 
 Mr. President, who now attempt to disparage it, re- 
 member what it then was? If they look into the 
 civil institutions of Home, when she was mistress of 
 tlie w.irhl, they will see how deeply it entered into 
 her policy, not only to promote, but to dignify agricul- 
 ture and its professors. Why, Pliny tells us, ''that 
 then the earth took pleasure in being cultivated by 
 the hands of men crowned with laurels and decorated 
 with the higliest honors." And Cicero deolaroa "that 
 nothing in the world was more useful, more agreea- 
 ble, or more v.urthy of freemen, than agriculture,'' 
 and in saying «ii, he pronounced not his own opinion 
 only, but t!ie public judgment of his ag! and coun- 
 try. If troiips were to be raised for the defence of 
 the Itepublic, whore, but in the in'Ims rusticus, were 
 the nurserl^'.-i of the Legions? Did the emergencies 
 of the slate require a General or Dictator ? where was 
 ho sought — in the schools or in the forum? No, sir. 
 No, he was taken from the plough. Were their ser- 
 vices to be rewarded, and if so, with gold, or medals, 
 or high office ? Not at all. It was done by dona- 
 tions of land; and the quantity just so much as a 
 man could plow himself in one day. A compensa- 
 tion, which by the bye, I fear, in our days of pros- 
 pe,rity and greatness, Mr. President, would not be 
 esteemed, by our warriors, a very liberal compensa- 
 tion. 

Agriculture a degraded occupation? Why I blush 
 whilst I repeat it ! What is there, let me ask, in 
 human duties, wliat in science or in arts, what in 
 m<jrals, philo.sophy or religion, that may not to be 
 found amiingst the cultivators of the soil in as great 
 a degree a.s in any other calling on earth ? What 
 occupation more full of dignity ; duties more full of 
 joy, tlian those of the husbandman, in all that invcists 
 man with simplicity, practical sense and enlightened 
 benevolence, and with all that is lovely, valuable or dis- 
 interested in wiiman ? AV'hen was it that man ever 
 rose from a state of servitude and dependence to own- 
 ership of laud, tliat ho did not learu self-respect and 
 hecomo mcn-e elevated in his own esteem. This it is 
 that breathing no low or abject spirit, he reaps from 
 the soil the harvest of virtue : the sobriety of the fa- 
 ther, the eoontjmy of the mother, the devoted labor of 
 the S(ui, the chastity of the daughter. These, those. 
 Mr. President, are the fruits of glorious agriculture, 
 and this is tlu^ answer to all who decry it! To the 
 little minds in other countries who regard the pur- 
 suits of the husbandman as ignoble, (and there are 
 such,) we have abundant vengeance for our contempt, 
 when we recollect the homage paid to it in every slage 
 of the world by the oollossal abilities of tlieir day ! — 
 When it is assailed in America we have but one an- 
 «wcr to give, and that is, that the plow can never be 
 regarded as an ignoble instrument — which was guided 
 by Washington ! Tlie one — the first — the last — the 
 best ! And now I come lastly, to the enquiry, .shall 
 this state of things which now exists be suftijred longer 
 to do 80 ? Shall the spirit of improvement that has 
 totiilly changed the agriculture and the conditiou ol 
 the greatest portion of the old wcn-ld, and so much of 
 the new, be banished from the good old states of the 
 Uuion ? If not, what is the remedy to bo applied ? 

I answer fearlessly — an improved and enlightened 
 .system of cultiv.ation, agricultural education and leg- 
 islative aid ! These are necessary and must be had. 
 Soils must be analysed ; and for this agriculturjiJ 
 chemists are needi'd. Agricultur.al implem.<nts mu'^f 
 be improved ; and for these agricultural soi^ieties lib- 
 erally endowed will be able t'> furnish models of im- 
 provemimts and machinery. The plow must be 
 driven deeper into the soil. Lime and plaster and 
 fertilising manure must be made to stimulate the 
 sleeping energies of soils newly turned up to the fer- 
 tilising dews of heaven ! Clover and other improving 
 crops must restcre to exhausted soils the vegetable 
 matter so indispensable to fertility I Farmers must 
 be invoked to push their enquiries to the extent of 
 their capacity, and their experiments as prudent 
 economy will permit it. and to make no otiier use of 
 the good old w.ay than to adhen^ to it mitil a better 
 is pointed out ! Every State should have a State So- 
 ciety, such as yours, with am|de means of carrying 
 out its meritorious objects ! This must be the foimda- 
 tion stone of all agricultural improvements upon a 
 large and liberal scale ! Nothing can bo done with- 
 out it! 

And here I will say that one great advantage, if 
 none other, which v.ould grow out of the meetings of 
 such associations properly organized, and endorsed by 
 the state, would be bringing together in one great 
 social body, most of the leading and efficient friends 
 of agriculture from all parts of the State at some cen- 
 tral point. Their views vrouhl be similar, their o1> 
 jects would accord, and theirmeeting would be friend- 
 ly and social. They would come together as yoij 
 have done, animated by a kindred spirit, and de- 
 voted to kindred pursuits, act iu concert and part 
 with the kindest feelings. 

Could anything but unmixed good come out of such 
 associations ? Politi(/al and party spirit would he 
 bauislicd, and no interest would claim attention but 
 such as gentlemen and Christians would conscienti- 
 ously support. Sucli meetings would serve to bind 
 together the people in the different portions of such 
 States as Pennsylviuiia and Virginia, and would be 
 useful if they did not even give such an impulse to 
 agriculture as I have attempted to prove and most 
 strongly believe. 

AV'^iiat scene more dignified and delightful than to 
 see, as we have done here, hundreds and thousande 
 of Iiappy, intelligent and independent farmers, col- 
 lei;ted from all parts of yuur State, not to engage in 
 political and party strife" but meet together for their 
 country's good, consulting how best to promote the 
 great interests of agriculture, with no jarring ele- 
 ments, no hoart^ljurnings of any sort, but peace and 
 good will, and benevolence animating every bosom ! 
 And then the various county and auxiliary^ socie- 
 ties would send their delegates' and combine in one 
 body upon every anni\'ersary of the State Society, an 
 immense mass of intelligence collected from all parts 
 of each State, bringing into social and prolitable in- 
 tercourse those who would otherwise remain strangers 
 to eacli other, and would thus collect a mass of infor- 
 mation not only upon farming, but other great inter- 
 ests of the State. 

And as the occupation of the plough is of no party, 
 as tlie times are those of temperance (and I omitted 
 to put tliis along with the other improvements of the 
 age), as farmers are characterized by the love of or- 
 der, and their calling the foundation upon which rests 
 the welfare and happiness of all, there can be co 
 danger of any sort apprehended from these gather- 
 ings, but they will come and pass off as the jubi- 
 lees of farmers always do, iu the greatest order aod
