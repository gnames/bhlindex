«oil become thoroughly dry, the action of the air on 
 it ceases in a great degree or becomes suspended, )jc- 
 cause the oxygen itself of the atmosphere requires a 
 certain degree of humidity to enable it to combine 
 witii other substances. Water, moreover, serves as 
 a vehicle fur many substances, which arc found only 
 n combination with a certain portion of moisture, or 
 n a liquid state. This combination is meant when 
 wo say hat water dissolves such substances, or holds 
 them in solution ; and in such a state of solutiim al- 
 most all substances must be, if they are to serve a.s 
 ood for plants. On the other hand, there are many 
 substaRces which are insoluble in water. If these 
 consist of or contain ingredients which, under differ- 
 cjit circumstances, would serve as food for plants, 
 they must still be regiuded as though not present i 
 and of no effect or value, so long as they are not ren- i 
 dered soluble. Happily however, tlicre are many 1 
 substances which can be used to render soluble those 1 
 whicli are not directly soluble in water. For osample, ' 
 iron, exposed to dampness or moisture, comlnnes 1 
 with oxygen, forming protoxyd of iron. This, com- i 
 bined with carbonic acid becomes soluble; and when 
 in excess, proves injurious to plants. As water has 
 the property of taking up or dissolving other sub- 
 stances, it never occurs pure in nature, but always 
 contains more or less foreign matter. Even rain wa- 
 t«r is never entirely pure. The fjreign matter con- 
 tained in water, is almost always fertilizhig. 

The chemical operation of water consists rather in 
 tills, that, by the influence of other substance?, it be- 
 comes decomposed into its elements, oxygen and hy- 
 drogen ; and in this way large quantities of water 

are used or appropriated in the growth of plants. 

Water appears under UifiFerent forms, according to 
 the degree of lieat it contains. At low temperatures 
 it appears solid, as ice, at ordinary temperatures as a 
 Uciuid, an.l at very liigh temperatures as vapor. Of 
 the latter the atraospliere can receive and absorb a 
 vci'y large quantity, which it does not again yield up 
 or part from, until it is reduced to a lower tempera- 
 ture. If this occur in the higher regions of the air, 
 douds are formed; and, by further atmospheric 
 changes, these become condensed and are precipita- 
 te<l, in whole or in part, as rain. But the atmosphere 
 also, when reduced to a lower temperature, though 
 no clouds be formed, parts with a portion of its mois- 
 ture in the form o{ dew. 

Next to air and water, the most important and most 
 Widely diifuscd compound substance is carhonic acid, 
 ■which is a i ombination of oxygen and carbon. Car- 
 bonic acid is produced by the combustion of carbona- 
 ceous matters in .atmosplieric air; also during the 
 processes of petrcfaetion and fermentation. It is 
 likewise a product of tlie act of breathing. It is 
 commonly procured fnirn limestone or marble, pieces 
 of which are placed in a suitable apparatus (fig. 12), 
 and muriatic acid diluted with water being then 

ourcd en them, the rapidly developed gas is received, 
 n a vessel, under water in the pneumatic trough. — 

Fig. 12. 
 But if the gas be required dry, it is to be passed over 
 d y chloride of calcium in a horizontal tube, whereby 
 every trace of moisture is removed from it. Carbonic 
 acid is aboxit one and a half times as heavy as com- 
 mon air. At the common temperature it is a color- 
 less, transparent gas. It combines readily with wa- 
 tor, and is attracted and absorbed by it, and hence 
 moist earth takes it up freely. It is wholly unfitted 
 for respiration, and does not support combustion. — 
 As largo quantities of carbunic acid are developed by 
 decaying vegetables, much of which is taken up and 
 retained by water, it is probable that it is thus intre- 
 ducod into plants by the absorption of such water, 
 and is then decomposed to appropriate the carbon. — 
 But plants .also absorb it from the atmosphere ; and 
 this appears to be the principal mode by which they 
 supply themselves with carbon. Another property 
 of carbonic acid, is, that it can be taken up in excess 
 by many substances, as by water for example. Many 
 substances which are insoluble in water containing 
 only a small portion of carbonic acid, become readily 
 soluble when a larger proportion is introduced. — 
 This is the reason why water containing it in excess 
 will decompose substances on which it would other- 
 wise have little or'no effect. Carbonic acid is evolved 
 in large quantities, fr?m natural sources, in volcanic 
 districts. It is frequently contained in wells and 
 caverns, and is produced abundantly by the explo- 
 siims which occaeiimally occur in coal mines. It is 
 always pi-escnt in the air, being given off by the res- 
 piration of animals, and by uniting with alkaline 
 bases, it forms an important class of salts, the car- 
 bonates; all of which are decomposable' by muriatic 
 acid, evolving carbonic acid gas in the process. 

Another very important compound substance is, 
 sulphuric acid — a combination of oxygen and sulphur. 
 For the production of this article, the sulphurous 
 acid resulting from the combustion of sulphur, and 
 which is its lowest compound with oxygen, is con- 
 ducted (fig. 13.) into a chamber A lined throughout 
 with sheet lead, and thence into chamber B, contain- 
 ing broad shallow vessels filled with concentrated ni- 
 tric acid. The actual formation of the sulphuric acid 
 takes place in chamber C, the floor of which is cov-
