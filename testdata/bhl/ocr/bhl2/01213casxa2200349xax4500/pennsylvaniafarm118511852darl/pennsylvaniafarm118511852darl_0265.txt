iiig through the chambers A, B, C, and D, the sul- 
 phuric acid formed, collects in the large cistern or 
 reservoir E. A free current of air must be provided 
 for, so that there may never be a deficiency of that 
 essential requisite, atmospheric air. Tlie necessary 
 supply of water is obtained from the steam evolved 
 iu the boiler F, and is conducted into the lead cham- 
 bers by the tubes G, G. The sulpliuric acid thus ob- 
 tained is freed from vratcr l.iy evaporation by leaden 
 vessels, till it attains a specific gravity of 4,848. It 
 is one of the most important compounds known ; and 
 very extensive use is made of it in the arts, for the 
 manufacture of nitric and muriatic acid, sulphate of 
 copper, and alum, as also in dyeing establishments. 
 Sulphur is an essential constituent of many plants, 
 though in its pure state it is wholly insoluble in wa- 
 ter; but in combination with oxygen, or in the form 
 of sulphuric acid which unites with oxygen to form a 
 salt, it becomes more readily accessible to plants. — 
 {sulphuric acid is also decomposed by certain sub- 
 stances, and the liberated sulphur then unites with 
 certain other substances, as hydrogen for example, 
 and is absorbed by them. As sulphuric acid is of a 
 very corrosive nature, it can be applied only in a very 
 diluted state. It renders excellent service if occa- 
 sionally, forced, in small quantity, into the tank con- 

taining urine or liquid manure, and the liquid thus 
 acidulated be used for wetting manure heaps or com- 
 post. During the fermentation of animal manures, 
 certain valuable fertilizing substances or elements 
 are liberated, escape into the air, and are lost. But 
 by the use of sulphuric acid their escape is prevent- 
 ed, the sulphuric acid combining with them and 
 forming noa-volatile salts — thus retaining and ren- 
 dering them available as fertilizers, as they subse- 
 quently became decomposed again, and furnish nu- 
 triment for growing plants or crops. 

Phosphoric acid, a combination of oxygen and 
 phosphorus, is likewise a substance of great import- 
 ance to the farmer. This acid greatly promotes the 
 growth of plants, even when watered with ouly a weak 
 solution of it in water. Such manuring, however, 
 would be very expensive. But the far mer introduces 
 phosphoric ac'd info the soil, generally without Ijeing 
 aware of the fact, since almost every description of 
 manure embr ices more or less substances contajining 
 combinations of phosphoric acid; besides which, 
 such combina^ons, in greater or smaller quanti'.y, 
 are fovind in a'most every soil. 

The phosphoric acid taken up by plants contri- 
 butes mainly 1 1 the formation of the grain or seed, 
 especially of the cereals. When this substance has 
 been exhausted from the soil, by several successive 
 crops of grain, it can be supplied again by means of 
 bonodust, which, before its application to the soil, 
 should be well moistened with dilute sulphuric acid, 
 and permitted to remain sometime in the heap. — 
 Bones consist chiefly of phosphate of lime : but the 
 greater affinity of the sulphuric acid for the lime, 
 causes these to combine — leaving the phosphoric acid 
 in an insoluble state. Whilst phospheric acid gene- 
 rally exists in a nearly insoluble condition, we also 
 find it regularly undergoing mutation and circulation. 
 Thus it is absorbed from decaying oi-ganic matter by 
 li^-ing plants; and these, in turn, or their products, 
 are consumed by men and animals. The pho.sphoric 
 acid they contain is thus reaccumulated, and what is 
 not appropriated for the production of bono and flesh, 
 is at once returned to the soil in the form of excre- 
 ment. 

Silicic acid — a substance of great importance in 
 ao-riculture — is a combination of oxygenated silicon. 
 Silicic acid is cfmimonly termed silicious earth, which 
 is a principal constituent of soils, but predominates 
 too much in those which are termed sandy. It is 
 also found intimately combined with other earths, 
 and then forms calcareous, aluminous and other soils, 
 in which silicious earth, though not preponderating, 
 still acts a principal part. 

Silicious earth possesses the following important 

properties. First, it absorbs very little water and 

readily parts with it again — hence sandy soils speed- 

j ily become dry. Secondly, it appears to bo insoluble 

■ in water ; though this is true only to a certain extent.
