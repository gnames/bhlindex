bo fountl to contain many of the constituents of fer- 
 tility that having been consumed by the exhausting 
 tiUage of the surface, no longer, of course, exist there. 
 Here, then, is a great resource. In many instances, 
 deep plowing .and the subsoil plow especially, will 
 enable the farmer almost to realino at once, the ori- 
 ginal fertility of his laud. Reason will show, that 
 the fertilizing materials applied to the surfoco will 
 sink into the ground by the natural process of infil- 
 tration occasioned by the melting of snows and the 
 absorption of rains and dews. Rains have been 
 known to penetrate the earth for several hundred feet 
 below the surface, and the great variety of particles 
 which administer to the growth of plants and which 
 aro applied to the surface will bo carried to various 
 depths. It is known that the eartli is replete with 
 the seeds of an infinite variety of plants, some of 
 which have sprung up spontaneously out of the 
 ground raised from great depths and exposed to the 
 air and sun. More frequently still, it has been ob- 
 served that the gromid raised from the bottom of 
 canals several foot, and other excavations and .'-pread 
 oat, has proved to be more fertile and productive than 
 the adjoining soil, which had been cultivated for 
 many years. No one can suppose that all the mine- 
 ral, vegetable, and animal matter, which has been 
 deposited in whatever way upon the earth, has re- 
 maiued_^within six inches of the surface. The very 
 tendency of vegetation to push its roots downwards 
 in search of food instructs us better. Deep plowing, 
 therefore, is suggested by the simple information of 
 common sense. 

But that alone is not sufficient. Nothing can fully 
 restore and maintain the worn out .soil, but the actual 
 addition of fertilizing materials to the surface from 
 without ; thus returning tci it what the course of for- 
 mer tillage had abstracted. All vegetation depends 
 for its growth upon the supply of the elements which 
 constitute its various parts, and enable the organs 
 of the vegetable to elaborate its structure. Manures 
 are those matt^rials which supply plants, directly or 
 indirectly, with these constituent elements. The 
 highest agricultural skill implies much more, than 
 neatness and perfection of the mechanical processes 
 of cultivation. It implies a knowledge of these con- 
 stituents of vegetables and of the chemical composi- 
 tion of the soil. Such knowledge enables the agri- 
 culturist to determine with certainty what tho soil 
 requires, to produce any particular class of plants, 
 and to apply his manures with the greatest possible 
 efficacy and economy-. It also enables him to accu- 
 mulate and preserve the essential food of plants, 
 which is suffered, to an extent quite incredible, to go 
 to waste, in tho form of drainage from barn-yards, 
 cattle sheds, manure heaps, and kitchens; of animal 
 and vegetable refuse and offals, and also in the form 
 of gaseous exhalations from these sources. Liebig 
 •ays — " that with every pound of ammonia which 

evaporates, a loss of sixty pounds of wheat is sus^ 
 tained, and that with every pound of urine, a pound 
 of wheat might be produced," and he truly adds, 
 " that the inditfcrcnce with which these liquid excre- 
 ments are regarded, is incomprehensible." The skil- 
 ful farmer will so manage as to save if possible every 
 drop of this liquid manure. 

The drainage of the cattle sheds contains, it has 
 been saiil, the essential elements of vegetables in % 
 state of solution; yielding aumnmia, potash, soda, 
 lime, magnesia and silica, with albumeu, mucus, 
 chlorine and several acids. So of the drainage from 
 manure heaps and barnyards, consisting of urine and 
 the richest matter of dung and compost. The wash- 
 ings, scourings, and drainage of kitchens and houses, 
 contain animal and vegetable refuse, &c., prolific in 
 ammonia, fatty matters rich in carbonic acid, and 
 soap, a compound of fat and soda. The highest evi- 
 dence has been given of the importance of these in- 
 gredients. These liquids applied directly to the grow- 
 ing crops, or, to all sorts of vegetable refuse, weeds, 
 stickheaps, &c., to convert them into manure, will 
 amply repay the care bestowed. 

The gaseous exhalation carries oflf the carbonia 
 acid and the vegetable and animal substances in the 
 manure heap during the process of fermentation, — 
 They escape in the form of ammonia and carbon ; 
 thus losing the best part of the manure which evapo- 
 rates first. The maxim is, that " nothing be allowed 
 to run away in the form of a fluid, or fly away in the 
 disguise of a smell." 

With respect to the refuse vegetable and animal 
 matters of the farm, it may be stated, that whatever 
 has had life or contains tho materials of which the 
 living structure is ccmiposed, ought to be preserved 
 for manure. Hence tho various weeds, stubble, 
 gi'ass, leaves, ditch-scourings, saw dust, bones and 
 other animal matters should be collected, as useful 
 in furnishing directly the proper constituents of fu- 
 ture vegetation, or for admixture with other highly 
 azotized substances. Many of tho vegetables whicli 
 may be collected about a fiirm contain much more 
 nitrogen than the straw of grain ; and are also verv 
 rich iu the inorganic elements, especially tho saline, 
 giving the farmer the means of greatly increasing his 
 compost heap. For this purpose the animal mat^s 
 which may be gathered, are still more valuable, as 
 they may be mixed with any oarthy substance; and 
 flesh, bones, hair, wool, &c., are extremely useful to 
 vegetation, giving off during decomposition much c-a]> 
 bonic acid and ammonia. It has been found by ae- 
 tual analysis, that 154 lbs. of flesh, bones, blood and 
 hair, contain as much nitrogen as 1000 lbs. of farm 
 manure, and a carcass of a dead liorse is believed to 
 be worth more than a ton of the best quality of such 
 manure. 

The above remarks indicate tlie necessity of much 
 gi-eat-er attention to the collection and prcservatiou
