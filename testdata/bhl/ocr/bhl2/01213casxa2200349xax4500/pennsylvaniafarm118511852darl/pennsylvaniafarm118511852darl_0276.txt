SHANGHAE FOWLS.

Improved Fowls. 

We are iiKlebted to Messrs. E. II. Butlor & Co., 
 the onterprieing publishers of Dixon & Kerr's popu- 
 lar work on Ornamental and Domestic Poultry, as 
 well as many other elegant and valuable books, for 
 tlie beautiful illustrations we give below. They arc 
 the same as those given in Dixon & Korr, and are, 
 we think, the iinest and most beautiful ever offered 
 to the American puljlic. As wo have received the 
 outiro set of cuts, we shall present them from time to 
 time to our readers, through the Journal, in regular 
 order, accompanying each with a description suffi- 
 ciently full to enable them to judge of the merits of 
 I he various kinds of fowls now claiming pulilic utton- 
 tion. As will be perceived, nearly all of the illustra- 
 tion are portraits taken from life, and heuce may Ije 

relied upon as faithful representations of the various 
 breeds. 

The following is a sufficiently minute and accurate 
 description of tliis variety. The Cock, when full- 
 grown, stands about twenty-eight inches high, that 
 is. if he bo a good specimen — the female about twen- 
 ty-two or twenty-three inches. I have never seen a 
 large comb or heavy wattles on tl;e hen, at any age; 
 whereas, the comb of the male is high, deeply indent- 
 ed, and his wattles double and large. I regard, how- 
 ever, as the chief characteristic of this variiHy, not 
 the comb and wattles, nor even the reddish-yello>v 
 feathered leg, but the abundant, soft, and downy c: v- 
 ering of the thighs, hips and region of the vent, to- 
 gether with the remarkably sliort tail and large 
 mound of feathers, piled ov(;r the upper part (jf it-i 
 root, giving rise to a considerable elevaticm on that 
 part of the rump. It should be remarked, also, that

the wings are quite short and small in proportion to 
 the size of the fowl, and carried verv high up the 
 body, thus exposing the whole of th*e thigh, and a 
 considerable portion of the side. I'hese characteris- 
 tics are not found in the same degree in any other 
 lowl of which I have any knowledge. Tliis peculiar 
 ai-rangement of feathers gives the Shanghae fowl in 
 .■ippearanoe, what it has in reality, a greater depth 
 of cpiarter, in proportion to the depth of brisket, than 
 ■Any other fowl. As to the legs, they are not very pe- 
 ,.uliar. The color is usually reddis'h-white or flesh- 
 (•olor, or reddish-yellow, mostly covered down the 
 utside-, even" to thi; end of the toes, with feathers. — 
 This last is not always the case. The Stai'-, in the 
 preceding illustration, lias no feathers on his legs, 
 while the Pullets, his sisters, are rather heavily fea- 
 thered, lie is, however, an exception to the rule, so 
 ar, at least, as his particular family is concerned. — 
 Jiut other families of Shanghaes, equally pure, are 

but very lightly feathered. A gentleman of my ac- 
 quaintance, Mr. A. Ncwbold, of Pliiladelphia, re- 
 ceived, in the .spring of 1847. from Captain Lock- 
 wood, direct frdm the city of Shanghae, a cock and 
 hen, as pure as any Shanghaes I have seen, differing 
 from other importations only in being nearly smooth- 
 legged, and not attaining to the weight of other spe- 
 cimens. In the second or third generatitm there was 
 scarcely a feather-legged Shanghae on the ]n'emises. 

The plumage of the thonmgh-bred Shanhae is re- 
 markably soft and silky, or rather downy, and is, in 
 my opinion, equally as gooil for domestic jiurjioses 
 as tliose of the Goose. They are certainly quite as 
 tine and .soft, if not as abundant. 

The fertile qualities of this breed may be inferred 
 from what has been attested concerning it. The 
 gentleman from whom I procured the stock jirevious- 
 ly herein portrayed, wrote to me concerning the im- 
 ported pair, that, although tliey had been for sevoraj
