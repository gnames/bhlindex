months from the grounJ, ami, when they arrived, 
 poor and verminous, yet, on turning them out about 
 the hitter end oi' May, troni that time to the first of 
 l\v ensuing Oe,tober, tlie hen laid forty-eight eggs 
 :ind liatrhed out two broods. The last brood ineludod 
 twelve chicks, ton of which he raised through the 
 winter, thus proving themselves able to endure our 
 <,'ver-(;hanging climate. 1 myself have ibund the 
 |iure vShanghao to equal, if nut to excel, any other 
 fowl in laying (jualtie.s — pei-haps, the Black Poland 
 Fowl or the Creole may lay a few more eggs in a 
 year, in e<msoquence of not Iteing so frequently 
 liroody, but their eggs are not so rich and nutritious. 
 J\cad the testimony of Mr. T. Ames, of Marshtield, 
 Mass. lie says, "that one of his neighbors, Mr. 
 Phillips, has a pullet of tliis brood, which laid one 
 Imndred and twenty eggs in one hundred and twcnty- 
 f.ve day.s, then stopped six days, then laid sixteen 
 <!ggs more, ancl stopped four days, and ami is now 
 laying; and that he (Mr. Ames) has one tliat has 
 done equally well." The eggs are generally of a 
 y>ali! yellow or nankeen color, not remarkably largi? 
 compared with the &\i(i of the fowl, and generally 

blunt at the ends. I have known but one thorough- 
 bred hen that iaid a long egg, and have never yet 
 known one to lay what arc cailed double eggs. The 
 comb is generally single, though I bave, in some spe- 
 cimens, seen a slight tendency to rose. 1 have never 
 seen one v; ith a top-knot.

MR. R. COPE'S COCHIN CHINA. 

(Imported.) 

COCHIN CHINA FOWLS. 

Very little is known of the origin of the Cochin 
 China Fowl, further than that some gentleman, three 
 or four years ago, presented a lew to tlie Queen of 
 Englaml. who subsequently had them bred at Wind- 
 sor Park. In order to promote their propagation, her 
 Majesty niad(! presents of them occasionally to such 
 persons as she supposed likely to appreciate them. — 
 They differ very little in their qualities, habits, and 
 general appearance from our Shanghaes, to which 
 they are undoubtedly nearly related. The lOgg is 
 nearly the same size, shape, and color ; both have an 
 equal developcmcnt of comb and wattles, the Coeh- 
 ns slightly differing from the Shanghaes, chiefly in 

being somewhat deeper .and fuller in the breast, not 
 quite so deep in the quarter, and being usually 
 smooth-legged, while the Shanghaes, generally, arc 
 more or less heavily feathered. The plumage is mucli 
 the same in both cases, nor have I discovered any 
 dill'erence in the Crow, it being in both equally sono- 
 rous and prolonged, diff'ering considerably from that 
 of the great Malay. Mr. Nolan says, ••thatful* 
 grown Cocks, from one and a half to'tvro years old, 
 average a weight of from ten to twelve jiounds, \hv 
 Hens from eight to nine pounds. Tae male bird 
 stands about two feet high; the female about twenty- 
 two inchs The Cock's comb is usually single, 

serrated, and erect, oi a brilliant .vcarlet, but not\l-
