Our Office. 

Those having business to transact vrith us will 
 phjase call at the Book Store of W. H. Spanglcr, in 
 Xorth Queen street, Lancaster, where we or our re- 
 presentative will at all times be in attendance. 

Absence of the Editor. — Tho unavoid.iMe ab- 
 srtrice of Prof, IIai.demax for several weeks past, is 
 tho apology we offer for the want of our usual amount 
 of editorial matter. 

For tlie above reason it will also be out of our 
 power to answer as satisfactorily as might be do- 
 sired, the query of our friend of the Daniwr i>/ IM 
 Union. We will, however, take the ros])onsil)ii;ty of 
 Mjing, that the sentence reffirred to, was certaiidy 
 not designed to convoy the idea that we, as a people, 
 «ii0uld not justly be proud of the mechanical skill of 
 <iaf countrymen, or that our progress in almost every 
 branch of tho mechanic arts, was not fully equal to 
 that of any of the nations of Europe. We mo.'t cor- 
 dially endorse the sentiments of tho editor of the 
 lianiier of the I'likm in regard to this honorable and 
 most useful class of the community, and assure him 
 Bhat our respect for them is only equalled by our 
 lieartfelt desire to see them advanchig .still more r.a- 
 pidly than they are now doing, towards the highest 
 position it is possible to attain. In .saying this, we 
 f«.K)l perfectly satisfieil that we aro but uttering the 
 »ontimentB of Prof. Ilaldcman. 

Mr. Stevenson's Address.— We ask the »tt<^ntion 
 «<" our readers to Air, Stevenson's able address, which 
 we give entire in the present number. It abounds in 
 home truths, and will well repay a perusal. Owing 
 to its length we have been cumpcllcd to oralt the con- 
 tinuation of our article on tho State Fair. Wc will 
 give it in our next. 

What is the Postage on the Farm Jodexal?— 
 This question is frequently asked us. We reply, the 
 postage, )/ prepaid, ii one cmt per month, or Ihrcf 
 '•■enis per quartei: All will see the adtonta^-c of pre- 
 psjTnent, as it s.avcs one-half. 

What will Penusylvauia Farmers do for the 
 Journal ! 

It will no doubt afford tho sincere friends of Agri- 
 culture in Pennsylvania, some gratification to kuow, 
 that our subscription list has gouo on steadily incrcii- 
 sing, until our circulation is sufficiently largo to justify 
 us in asserting that the Farm Journal is now placc<I 
 upon a basis which certainly .secures its continuance. 
 For this wished for result, wc are indebted mainly, to 
 the kind friends who have given their time and t.al- 
 ents to the good work, and to them our warmest tliaJil.H 
 .ore due. 

But while we thus individually express our gratifi- 
 cation and tender our thanks, we would not have the 
 Farm Journal regardeil as an individual enterprise. 
 .'Vny losses, it is true, which might be sustained l»y it, 
 would fall upon us, wbilo a; t'n .same time wc should 
 receive the profits, if any : Imt wc arc desirous of 
 awakening a more general feeling of interest in it« 
 favor. AVith an honest, heartfelt desire to give oiii- 
 farmers a chance to be hoard through a Journal of 
 their own — a Journal reprosontiug truly, tho charac- 
 ter of Pennsylvania Agriculture, and sustaining it.s 
 interests — we commenced its publication, relying up- 
 on those whose reputation wc desired to maintain and 
 whose interests we had resolved to support, for the 
 assistance necessary to sustain our enterprise;. Many 
 liredicted failure — we never thought of it. A few en- 
 couraged us, .and we went on with a contidint spirit. 
 We felt satisfied that the claims of the Farm Journal 
 ^vould one day be acknowl dgod, and that State pride 
 would not permit it to die fur want of support. Nor 
 were we deceived in our o])iiiion. A liberal su])port 
 has already been extended it, and tho reproach that 
 Pennsylvania would not encourage an Agricultural 
 .Journal of her own has been wiped away. 

We have s.aid, that our circulation is sufficiently 
 hirgo to secure the permanency of the Journal ; but 
 it is not large enough to enable us to render it whiit 
 it should be. Our esteemed neighbor of tho Ohio 
 Cultivator asks, and asks confidently too, for to* Ihou- 
 sand subscribers, and our impression is, that he will 
 get tliom. The circulation of the Albany Cultivator 
 is now Jificen ikousond, and that of the Ucnasece
