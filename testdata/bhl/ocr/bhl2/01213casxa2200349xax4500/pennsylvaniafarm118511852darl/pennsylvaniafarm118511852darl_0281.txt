TO wnirn was a'O'aiided the 

FIRST PREMIUM 

At the Pennsylvania Asncultaral Fa;r. after a trial tlie fairness nf 
 which CduUI iif)t he dip|>ute(l. These Fans, the inventor ciintnieiiE- 
 )y asserts, art* the only ones nr)W in use entirely adecjnate lo the 
 wants of the farmer. The nhjet-t df the inveiitur was not J i reeled 
 alone, to the purpose nf eleunin^ grain, hut (if cleanin;; it ant) 
 saving at tlie same time the fanner the truulde of gailiering it 
 from the H'lnr, thus not only avoiding lahor. tint keeping the grain 
 from the diit on the floor. In addition tothis, these Fans, possess 
 jtreatT advantages than those constructeil upon the old plan. — 
 These advantages are sis folhiws : 

First- The arrangement is such that a quick shake can he ob- 
 tained hv turning slowly, thua suturing when desired, a leas quan- 
 tity of for small eeeds. 

Second. When necessary a s'ow shake can he secured, by rapid 
 turiiMig. This is of immense advantage, as it adapts the fun, to 
 tUe cleaning of all kindsof seeds. 

Third. A new method of adjusiing the riddles and screws. This 
 gives the operator the advantage of placing them in any position 
 bes!. adapted to accomplish the purpnses of a grain Fun. Every 
 riddle and screen has a separate adjusfnien":. so that each one can 
 be fixed at any angle withoQl the necessity of taking them out 

Fourth, The grain, instead of falling on the Jloor, as is Ufcually 
 the case, is discharged, hy means of a small trough, into the half 
 bushel, or other measure that may he placed under it. By tliis ar- 
 rangement the grain is all measured, hy the time it is cleaned, 
 thus saving not only labor, but time, and consequently expense, as 
 well as keepinir the grain from eonticl with the dust and dirt on 
 floor. For this reason; tlie fan, can he pui in op'ra^ion anywhere, 
 with as little trouble as the common fans can be used in a ham 
 floor. 

Fiftft, The simplicity of their constructions renders them less 
 liable to get nut of repair than other mills. 

For the above reasons, we confidently rccnmmend our F.nis to 
 public patronage. Privileges to manufacture will he granted on 
 reasonable terms Satisfactory informatnm can he promptly had 
 by addressing post paid^ the subscriber at Norristowii, Montgome-

This new and heautif jl dnnher, recently introdnccd from China 
 by Mr. Fortune, proves perfectly hardy in New Knglaiid, having 
 stood in the grounds here two winters without protection. Train- 
 ed toa single pillar, say.ten leet in height, it is very striking and 
 heaulil'ul object from Jane till cold weather, during which time it 
 is covered with a profusion nf its large double flowers of a delicate 
 rose color. It is very ornamental planted in patches like Verbe- 
 uas; makes an admirable screen; and is very eirective in >oung 
 plantations, belts or shrid>tteries, trailing prettily on the surface, 
 and running among the lower branches nf tlie trees in a very pic- 
 turesque manner. Its culture is very simple, and it will thrive in 
 common garden soil. If requireiL in considerable tiuantitiea the 
 tubers may be divided into single eyes, planting each in a four inch 
 pot of good light compoit. in February, under glass, or in hot beds 
 in the spring ; or larger pieces contaniing several eyes may be 
 planted in the open ground iu May. Plants P3 per dozen. Tubcr.s
