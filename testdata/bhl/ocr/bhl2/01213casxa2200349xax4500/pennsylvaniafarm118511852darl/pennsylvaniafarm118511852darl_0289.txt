enough to make the examination, they will find that 
 the second growth of potatoes almost invariably af- 
 fects the first to such a degree as to cause them 
 (the first) either to rot entirely, or partially. This is 
 especially the case in wet seasons, and for this rea- 
 son, I invariably select for seed the large first growth 
 potatoes, believing that I thereby not only secure 
 better crops, but insure myself perfectly against 
 the rot, now the theme of so much learned discus- 
 sion. 

If any of your readers have a better theory, let 
 them " trot it out." All that I ask is, that they will 
 offer the result of a few experiments to test its value. 
 I have tried mine, and found it t > answer as well in 
 practice as in theory. Elton.

 Wheat Culture. 

In the interior of Pennsylvania, from whence we 
 date, wheat and corn may be said to be our staple 
 productions. Of the cultivation of the former, being 
 the more important, we propose to treat at present. 
 Our soil is limestone, a tenacious red clay, highly im- 
 pregnated with iron, and in many localities with an 
 infusion of flint gravel. Wheat is usually put in land 
 manured after an oats crop has been taken off, or up- 
 on a clover sod, plowed either before or after harvest. 
 If the farmer desires to enrich his land by turning 
 in a coat of clover, the work should always be done 
 before harvest, and the reason for this is more impor- 
 tant than obvious ; for if plowed at this early stage 
 of the season, the grass lias had time to undergo 
 the necessary fermentation, so that when the sea- 
 son arrives for stirring, it is in a better condition 
 for mixing more intimately with the soil and diffusing 
 its benefit more extensively to the growing grain; but 
 if the plowing in of the grass be deferred to a later 
 period, nearly approaching the time for sowing, the 
 germination of the seed and the fermentation of the 
 grass are going on at the same time, and these natural 
 actions of both are wholly uncongenial with each 
 other. The heat and sourness of fermentation cer- 
 tainly operates to prevent a healthful germination of 
 the seed ; and this we think is a most important pe- 
 riod for the ultimate success of the crop ; for we think 
 it may be said, in perfect accordance with all expe- 
 rience, that no good crop ever resulted from an imper- 
 fect or unhealthy germination of seed. And here, in 
 connection with this idea, it may be remarked, that 
 the time for sowing should always be regulated by 
 the condition of the ground, taking care that it should 
 be neither too wet or too dry, but just in such a state 
 of moisture as will ensure the most speedy and ac- 
 tive germination and growth. Seed sown in ground 
 too wet and cold has a tardy and sickly growth, 
 while that put in ground too dry has no growth at 
 all, until it gets moisture, and by this time, the seed 
 is so injured by exposure, as rarely, if ever to pro- 
 duce a remunerating crop. Much discussion has 

been had, and great difference of opinion exists with 
 regard to late and early sowing ; our experience 
 teaches, that there is no better rule by which to gov- 
 ern the subject, than this : â€” Sow at any time before 
 the first of September, when the ground is in good 
 order. You thus give the plant an active, healthy 
 growth, and a constitution which enables it to with- 
 stand the many vicissitudes of the fall and the ap- 
 proaching winter. 

The mode of plowing the ground, and the imple- 
 ment with which it is done, is worthy of much more 
 consideration than is usually given to it. There are 
 very many erroneous notions extant among farmers 
 on this subject. A clover sod upon our limestone 
 land is of a very tough and tenacious cha* acter, and 
 the plo ,'. s in general use are calculated to make ex- 
 ceedingly bad work ; for that which is called pretty 
 plowing, when every land slice exhibits its exact 
 shape and due proportion, in a mass as or even more 
 solid than before it was turned up, is a wretched 
 mode of accomplishing the object. If the work of 
 plowing be thus done, there is much less difference 
 which side of the sod be uppermost than is usually 
 imagined. If we but reflect that the earth is a set of 
 mouths and lungs that constantly feed upon the pro- 
 ductions of the natural elements, and that air and 
 light and heat are as essential to its profitable exis- 
 tence as they ore to that of the animal : and that the 
 object of plowing is to open these mouths and lungs 
 instead of compacting it and making it Impervious to 
 light and heat and food, we cannot hesitate about the 
 use of an implement that will attain that object in 
 the highest degree. If the farmer will but look with 
 the eye of a mechanic upon his plow, and find the 
 relative position of its beam and land-side to bs such 
 that they are tending in different directions, he will 
 perceive at once how much more power he is using 
 than would be necessary, if his implement were a good 
 one. But this is not the greatest objection, for one 
 which we deem of higher importance, is the great 
 pressure against the land-slice which is made by such 
 a plow, giving it a solidity which can be only over- 
 come by repeated harrowings. The centre-draught 
 plow, which derives its name from its mechanical 
 structure, is not obnoxious to these objections ; while 
 it requires much less power, must necessarily press 
 more lightly upon the land slice, leaving it to fall in- 
 to a pulverized state as it separates from the mould- 
 board. Light is beginning to shine in upon this im- 
 portant operation, and it is to be hoped that farmers 
 will study more the policy of doing good, rather than 
 pretty work. 

Wheat, with us, is now almost universally put in 
 with a drill. It is sufficient to say in commendation 
 of this mode that all the seed you use is actually 
 planted and covered just at that depth which the ex- 
 igencies of your soil and your own judgment dictate. 
 The implement, if a good one, places this subject en-
