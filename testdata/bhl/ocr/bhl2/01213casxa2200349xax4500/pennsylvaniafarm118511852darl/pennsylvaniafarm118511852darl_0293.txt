A coniljination of lime and sulphuric acid consti- 
 tutes sulphate of lime, ot gypsum. This possesses nei- 
 ther acid nor caustic properties, and does not appear to 
 be soluble in water; though it is really slowly taken up 
 by water, when present in suffieientquantity. Gypsum 
 is decomposed by other substances which the soil con- 
 tains, and its constituents serve as food for plants. — 
 Thus the ammonia in the soil has a stronger affinity 
 for sulphuric acid than the lime, and withdraws it 
 therefrom, to form with it the highly fertilizing and 
 very soluble sulphate of ammonia. The lime remains 
 either uiicombined or united with carbonic acid, and 
 is thus absorbed in turn. By these and similar pro- 
 cesses, plants are supplied with sulphur, nitrogen 
 and lime, substances essentially requisite to their 
 growth. On many kinds of soil gypsum is altogether 
 inoperative, either because they already contain a 
 sufficient supply, or because the substances indispen- 
 sable to its solution and decomposition are not pres- 
 ent. But by the application of manures containing 
 carbon and ammonia, the more rapid decomposition 
 of sulphate of lime may be effected. If gypsum con- 
 tain a considerable proportion of common salt, it 
 will prove the more valuable for agricultural purposes. 

Nitrate of lime, also, is an excellent promoter of 
 vegetation ; but the artificial preparation of it would 
 render it too expensive for use. It can, however, 
 sometimes bo obtained cheap, in the shape of lime 
 rubbish from old buildings — the lime it contains hav- 
 ing combined with saltpetre — and may then be ben- 
 eficially applied to the soil. It is occasionally met 
 with in marl, greatly enhancing the fertilizing qual- 
 ities of that article. This effect is attributable mainly 
 to the large proportion of nitrogen it contains ; and 
 it is transient chiefly because this salt is exceedingly 
 soluble in water, and therefore easily leached out of 
 the soil by rain. It has been alleged that after land 
 has been marled, nitrate of lime is formed in the 
 soil, and that this is the chief benefit derived from 
 marling. But admitting that nitrate of lime is thus 
 formed, the quantity produced cannot still be suffi- 
 ciently great to justify us in attributing the chief 
 value of marl thereto. In fact the meliorating qual- 
 ities cannot be ascribed to any one of its constituents, 
 to the exclusion of the rest. 

Another combination is lime with phosphoric acid, 
 or phospate of lime. This is very valuable to the 
 farmer as a means of introducing phosphoric acid to 
 the soil ; but as phosphate of lime is not readily solu- 
 ble, the use of sulphuric acid in its application is to 
 be recommended. This substance constitutes the 
 principal part of the bones of men and animals. It 
 is found in a crystalized state in the mineral called 
 apatite; and uncrystalized m phosphorite and moroj;- 
 ite. Most kinds of marl contain it ; and it is found 
 in the ashes of most vegetables, especially of legumi- 
 nous and cruciforous plants and cereal grains. 

From a combination of lime with silicic acid, is 

formed silicate of lime, a substance decomposible by 
 almost any acid, .and found in various minerals. As 
 it is wholly insoluble in water, the soil may contain 
 a large proportion of it, without any advantage to the 
 growing crop derivable therefrom, till it is acted on 
 by humic or other acid. 

Furthermore, from the combination of oxygen with 
 aluminum, ahimina is produced— a substance by no 
 means to confounded with clay, which is an intimate 
 combination of alumina with silicic acid, some calca- 
 reous earth, potash, soda, &c. Clay is produced by 
 the gradual disintegration of stones and minerals, 
 particularly of felspar. As alumina is not soluble 
 in carbonic acid, it is rarely, and then only in very 
 limited quantity, absorbed by plants, and is conse- 
 quently not to be regarded as supplying them with 
 aliment. On the contrary it possesses the property 
 of preparing the soil itself for the reception of ali- 
 mentary matters. Alumina is distinguished by the 
 following characteristics : — 1. It can imbibe a large 
 quantity of water and thereby become plastic. "When 
 dried it hardens, contracts very much, and becomes 
 fissured. 2. It is soluble neither in water nor in car- 
 bonic acid, but readily enters into combination with 
 various other acids, then however acting injuriously 
 on -vegetation. Clay, on the other hand, not only 
 imbibes carbonic acid readily, but also the oxygen 
 of the atmosphere and ammonia — thus establishing 
 its great importance in agriculture. 

The combination of oxygen with magnesium forms 
 magnesia. This substance frequently occurs combi- 
 ned with calcareous earth or silica, but more gener- 
 ally with carbonic acid. Almost all plants require 
 some magnesia, and to a few it is altogether indis- 
 pensable. But when magnesia predominates in the 
 soil, its efi'ects are invariably pernicious, as in all the 
 cold soils. If a field be dressed with lime containing 
 a very large proportion of magnesia, the ensuing 
 crops are very likely to be injured, because the mag- 
 nesia re-absorbs very slowly, from the atmosphere, 
 the carbonic acid of which it has been deprived by 
 heat. It consequently remains long in a condition to 
 combine with any acid which the soil may contain ; 
 and the formation of humate of magnesia speedily 
 ensues ; which requiring but little water for its solu- 
 tion, supplies the growing plants with much more 
 magnesia than they are able to assimilate. Pure 
 magnesia alone could not injure plants so extensively, 
 as it is soluble only in 5142 parts of water. 

The combination of oxygen with iron, forms the 
 protoxjjd and the peroxyd of iron. The protoxyd of 
 iron is produced when iron and oxygon combine 
 while there is not enough of the latter present to pro- 
 duce entire saturation. The difference between the 
 protoxyd and the peroxyd of iron consists in this, 
 that the former is very soluble in water containing 
 carbonic acid, whilst the latter is not. Hence the 
 former becomes injurious when the soil contains it in
