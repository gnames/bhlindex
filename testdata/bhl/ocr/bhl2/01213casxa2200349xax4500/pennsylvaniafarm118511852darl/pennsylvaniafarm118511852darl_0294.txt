excess, -wlnlst the latter continues inoperative, and 
 consequently harmless. The injuriousness of the pro- 
 toxyd of iron manifests itself very obviously there, 
 for example, where the soil is plowed very deep at 
 once. If a large quantity of the protoxyd of iron 
 has been deposited on the bottom of the furrow by 
 abrasion from the sole of the plow in previous years, 
 this is now brought up at once and mixed with the 
 surface soil. It is thus dissolved by the rain water 
 which has absoi-bed the carbonic acid of the soil, and 
 the plants are thug injured by an excessive supply of 
 this substance, furnished by the water which holds it 
 in solution. Such a soil does not again recover its 
 former fertility, till the protoxyd has been converted 
 into a peroxyd, by the gradual absorption of oxygen 
 from the atmosphere. Hence, when a soil is found 
 to conta'n too h r ^e a proportion of protoxyd of iron, 
 the proper course is to plow it very frequently, that 
 it may as speedily as possible, absorb from the atmos- 
 phere as much oxygen as is requisite for the conver- 
 sion of the protoxyd of iron into peroxyd. A dressing 
 of fi-esh burnt lime also renders excellent seivioe in 
 such cases, because the lime withdraws the excess of 
 carbonic acid from the water, and thus diminishes its 
 powcr'uf solution. 

Again, oxyd of iron combines with acids. Thus 
 protoxyd of iron unites with sulphuric acid, and 
 forms sulpliaie of iron, which, if it occurs in excess 
 in the soil, destroys vegetation, though by virtue of 
 its sulphuric acid, it acts as a fertilizer, if the soil 
 contain it in minute quantity only. The injury re- 
 sulting from the presence of iron in excess, may be 
 removed or modified by the application of calcareous 
 earth, burnt lime, or ashes to the soil. The ji^^osplia- 
 ted protoxyd of iron occurs abundantly in swampy or 
 marshy soils, and in the deposites of old stagnant 
 ponds. It may be recognised by the bluish color of 
 the clay, when recently uncovered, which turns brown 
 or rusty when exposed to the air for a season. This 
 substance is insoluble in water, and is scarcely solu- 
 ble in carbonic acid, but is readily taken up by am- 
 monia ; and in this combination may be advantage- 
 ously appli ;d to cultivated crops. But where it exists 
 in excess, in this state, united with various other sub- 
 stances, which lender it soluble, it may become inju- 
 rious by its superabundance.

Mr. Editor: — As you have stated that if the out. 
 lines are given, you will fill up the rest, I send you 
 a few facts, which you can use or not, as in your 
 judgment may seem best. 

In the fall of 1848, I undertook the management 
 of certain portions of my farm, and feeling somewhat 
 interested in the progress which was making every 
 where around me, I determined upon experimenting 
 a little, and here are the results. 

After cider-making, I had a largo lot of pumice. 

the disposal of which bothered me a little. I might, 
 it is true, have done as I have seen hundreds of oth- 
 ers do, haul it into a ditch by the road side, or cart 
 it into the stream, but believing that it could be ap- 
 plied to a better purpose, I ordered it to be drawn 
 on my wheat land. My foreman raised many objec- 
 tions to this, and my neighbors predicted failure. — 
 But I went ahead, and the result was the finest crop 
 of wheat I ever saw. It was decidedly better than 
 where the lime and manure had been applied alone. 
 [The quantity of pumice and the extent of surface 
 to which it was applied should have boon mentioned. 
 Ed.] 

Having a considerable amount of ditching to do, I 
 had the rich soil from the ditches mixed with an 
 equal quantity of good short manure, and to this I 
 added lime at the rate of five bushels to eight cart 
 loads of the above mixture. In the fall and spring I 
 had the whole mass worked over by means of spade 
 and hoe, until it was throroughly mixed. AVith this 
 compost, I gave my corn a good top-dressing, and the 
 result was, that wherever it was applied, I had an 
 increase of at least ten bushels to the acre. 

Weeds generally grow more readily along fences, 
 than in the middle of the field. My plan to eradicate 
 them, is to remove my fences every six years, and the 
 advantages I claim for it, are these : First, it eflec- 
 tually destroys the briars, elder bushes, and other 
 troublesome plants. In the second place, it enables 
 me to repair my fences in a proper manner ; and last- 
 ly, I find that the fine yields on that portion of the 
 field formerly covered by the old fence, will fully pay 

the expense of removing it."*

 Permanent value of lime as a fertilizer—Composts. 

Mr. Editor : — Some ten years since, my father 
 was engaged in burning lime, for the purpose of lim- 
 ing some land on another farm. After applying the 
 requisite quantity, we found that there wore about 
 sixty bushels remaining in the kiln. From a drain 
 from the public road we collected about four loads 
 of rich sandy loam. We mixed the sixty bushels of 
 lime with the loam, in the fall, by putting alternate 
 layers of each. In the spring, the mass was as mel- 
 low as an ash heap. The whole of the heap was 
 then di a\vn upon an acre and a half of timothy sod, 
 which had been previously plowed to a depth of eight 
 inches, and carefully spread and harrowed it in. It 
 was then put in corn, and although we did not mea- 
 sure the crop, I am satisfied that the yield of the acre 
 and a half composted, was at the rate of a hundred 
 bushels to the acre. The next year it was put in 
 corn, and the yield was equal to that of the preced- 
 ing year. We then put in wheat. The average of 
 the whole field, of which the acre and a half was a
