The rotation of crops generally observed here is to 
 plow* stiff Slid, plant corn, followed vrith oats, then 
 uiaaurc and stu);l.ile. Wheat comes next in order, 
 after ■n-hich it is laid down in clover and permitted to 
 remain one, two or throe years for hay or pasture 
 when it is again put in corn or wheat. 

Comparatively few county societies have an exist- 
 once in this district. Twelve years ago we had a 
 flourishing agricultural soeietj', which for some cause 
 which I cannot explain, was permitted to languish 
 and finally die. Since then there appears to exist a 
 prejudice against such associations. Many of our 
 farmers, however, having attended the State Fair, and 
 being well pleased with their visit, I indulge the hope 
 that the importance of associated effort will be more 
 generally felt and appreciated. The only complaints 
 I heard were in relation to the Railroad company's 
 selling in one instance twice as many tickets as they 
 could accommodate peiM^ns, and then refusing to re- 
 fund the money to those who could not get into the 
 cars. Another complaint was, the estravag.ant pri- 
 ces charged at Ilarrisburg. Our farmers did not ex- 
 pect to pay more than one dollar per day, but were 
 charged much higher prices, and compelled to la}' on 
 the floor at that. My own impression is, that the So- 
 ciety should make an arrangement by which only one 
 dollar a day should be charged. More than this is 
 too much when wheat commands only 75 cents per 
 bushel, and if this were the fixed price, and published 
 by the Society, it would be the means of bringing 
 many thousands more to the fair. The increased 
 number in attendance would obviate, I think, the ne- 
 cessity of requiring money from the citizens of the 
 place where it is to be held, while at the same time 
 it would give much more general satisfaction.

[Although we cannot suppo.50 that the clause in 
 the constitution referred to by our correspondent, 
 contemplated the publication of the reports in the 
 Farm Journal, we hope that every officer will follow 
 Mr. Gund3''s example and enable us to present to our 
 readers, the agricultural condition of the various sec- 
 tions of the State. 

In relation to the charges of landlords at Ilarris- 
 burg, our correspondent will bear in mind the fact 
 that such occasions always require increased accom- 
 modations, and that provisions, such as poultry, but- 
 ter, &c., are always higher in price. Wo should be 
 glad to see such an arrangement made in regard to 
 prices for boarding as that proposed by Mr. G. but 
 wc fear it would be impracticable. — Ed.]

 A tetter from Venango County. 

Mr. Editor: — Our county is comparatively now, 
 some parts of it quite so, but it is rapidl}' improving. 
 Where, recently, the forest stood, fields of wheat now 
 cover the ground. Where, but a few years ago, the 
 wolf and bear prowled, smiling villages are now 
 springing up, real estate is rapidly advancing in va^ 
 lue, and the citizens generally are augmenting their 
 wealth. The only exception to general prosperity 
 seems to be with those engaged in developing the 
 mineral resources of the county, and this seems to be 
 a sad exception. If the iron business were in a pros- 
 perous state, it would form a very important item in 
 the business of this section of country. But the most 
 permanent business in this county is tilling the soil, 
 and in that are tiie most of its citizens engaged. 

Something has seemed to awaken anew the farm- 
 ers of Pennsylvania to the subjoot of agricultural im- 
 provements, and the formation of agricultural socie- 
 ties for their promotion. 

An agricultural society has recently been formed 
 in this county, which is to meet at the Court House 
 in Franklin, on tlie 24th inst., to choose its officers 
 and transact such other business as may come before 
 the meeting. Warren county has a society, which 
 held its first annual fair in September last, and Penn- 
 sylvania was destined to hold her first State Agricul- 
 tural Fair in 1851. 

It is much better to awaken to the importance of 
 this subject at the sixth or even the eleventh hour, 
 than not to awaken to it at all. But why need we, 
 of Pennsylvania, be so much in the rear of our fel- 
 low citizens of our sister States in these matters ?— 
 New York, Massachusetts and other States have de- 
 voted a degree of attention to this subject, unknown 
 in Pennsylvania, and they have been richly rewarded 
 for it. They have received their reward in many 
 ways ; in their'Morgan and other fine races ol horses 
 — in their superior cattle, Short-horns, Devons, Ayr- 
 shires, &c. — their superior sheep and swine, and 
 above all, in their improvements in agricultural im- 
 plements, their reapers, their mowers and their 
 threshers, by means of which such a vast amount of 
 luiman labor is saved. A man, a boy, and a pair of 
 horses with a good mower will cut as much grass in 
 a day as ten or twelve men with scythes, and the 
 same of other implements. 

It is from tlie labor-saving machines that the great- 
 est benefit is to be di rived. The doctrine that disaj)- 
 proves of the use of machines because it throws so 
 many men out of employment is but " the blind 
 leading the blind." It was urged at the introduction 
 of the printing press and the spinning jeunj', but 
 what revolutions have they not wrouglit in litera- 
 ture and manufactures ? And revolutions, approxi- 
 mating to these in some degree have already been 
 wrought in agricultural labor and progress.
