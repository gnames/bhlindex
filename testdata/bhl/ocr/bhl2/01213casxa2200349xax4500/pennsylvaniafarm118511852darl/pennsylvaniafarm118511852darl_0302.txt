CnEAT, CHESS. 

French, Brome Seigle. German, Roggen Trespe. 
 Bromus secalinus Lin. Bromus arvensis; and Bromus 
 vltiosus, of Wcigel, but not B. arvensis, of Lin. Bro- 
 mus Ehrharte, Roem, B. hordeacens Gort, B. maxi- 
 mus Gilib, not of Delf. and B. squarrosus, Lam. not 
 of Linn. 

The name of this genus was proposed by Monte 
 about 1720. It is derived from the Greek Broma 
 ■which signifies food, and its specific names come from 
 the Celtic, sega, a sickle— to cut -with a sickle, or per- 
 haps from Rye, meaning rye grass. The genus now 
 contains about 112 species, 4 are natives of the Uni- 
 ted States, and 3 or 4 more have been introduced. 

It belongs to the 3rd class, Triandria and 2nd, Or- 
 der Digynia in the Artificial System of LinnKus. — 
 to Order Graminas and Tribe Fcstucinaj in the Nat- 
 ural System. 

The Natural Order Graminese, or in other words 
 the " true grasses," is a very large one, and contains 
 nearly 2500 species, which preserve a remarkable 
 similarity of character, for whether we examine a mi- 
 nute Poa, or a mighty bamboo 60 feet in height, wo 
 are often perplexed with the general resemblance in 
 the characters and habits of all the members. 

Every farmer knows this too common weed, and it 
 is, therefore, useless to describe its general appear- 
 ance. But, as a notion prevails, that Clieat is noth- 
 ing but a degenerate wheat, I vrill try to find out some 
 of the distinctive characters of the two plants, a task, 
 difBcult for me to render intelligible, without recourse 
 to botanical terms. But the two plants are very dis- 
 tinct and do not belong to the same sub-division in 
 the Natural system. 

CHEAT. 

The flowers disposed on 
 secondary stalks, wliich 
 are loose and variously and 
 irregularly sub-divided. 

The flowers in cUisters 
 of from 8 to 10 a little re- 
 mote at the base, and not 
 lying over each other, turn- 
 eddownwards! Theseclus- 
 ters, loose, 8lender,swelled, 
 smooth, and generally all 
 producing fruit. 

Outer chaff' boat shaped, 
 lengthwise, the lower chaff" 
 shorter than the upper, with 
 5 ribs tapering to a small 
 sharp point. The upper 
 one blunt and 7 ribbed, 
 tivo cleft. 

The seeds are differently shaped and the two plants 
 are quite distinct throughout. 

I hear that a distinguished botanist in Europe has 
 asserted that it is possible for this transmutation to be 
 effected, but 15 years of careful examination on all 
 the varieties of soil in the Middle States, from the 
 marshy diluvian of the Delaware to the plateau of the 

WHEAT. 

The flowers in a compact 
 bead at the top of the stem 
 presenting 4 sides. 

The flowers in clusters 
 of from 3 to 5 lying over 
 each other, with scarcely 
 any footstalk, upright, 3 of 
 them usually producing 
 fruit and2of them abortive. 

These clusters egg sha- 
 ped, blunt flatted, rough on 
 the upper surface, outer 
 chaff", swelled out in the 
 middle, crosswise egg sha- 
 ped, blunt and nearly equal 
 in length, not ribbed, not 
 notched. 

Allegheny Mountains — from the sands of the New 
 Jersey beaches to the rocky cliff's of the lakes; has not 
 furnished me with any positive evidence of this trans- 
 mutation, and I have had hundreds of farmers, firm 
 in the belief, engaged to furnish the fact. The seed 
 from which the cheat springs can, atalmostany season, 
 be found attached to the root, and in every instance, 
 when examination has been made, it has been found 
 to he cheat! and ?ioi wheat ! The plant under con- 
 sideration is one of great unformity of character, sub- 
 ject to but few varieties, if indeed any. Its charac- 
 ters are the same among all kinds of wheat, whether 
 white or red, bearded or smooth, mediterranean or 
 blue stem, winter wheat or spring wheat, Polish 
 wheat or spelt, rye or barley, oats or timothy ; in the 
 swamp or on dry ground — the serpentine barrens at 
 West Chester, or the coal shales of Clearfield — from 
 England, France, Germany, or the valley of the Mis- 
 sissippi. Again, the " hessian fly" does not attack 
 it — the " smut" aff"ect it — or the " rust" take hold 
 of it. It seems to escape the diseases incident to 
 wheat, and the attacks of the insect, peculiar to that 
 grain. It has peculiarities of its own. Its seeds 
 are more hardy, the embryo smaller, the whole plant 
 more prolific, both in the number of stalks from one 
 root, and the amount of fruit it produces. It has 
 its own diseases, and insects peculiar to it are found 
 on it. 

The erroneous ideas respecting its origin has filled 
 the " earth" with its seed, and untiring zeal and in- 
 dustry can only remove one of the greatest nuisances 
 that ever invaded the fa-m. J. M. McMinn.

 Guano vs. I,ime. 

5Ir. Editor : — In the November number of the 
 ".Journal" an article upon Lime, by Enoch Lewis, 
 is calculated, I fear, to underrate the importance of 
 embracing all the means of fertilization that we may 
 obtain — particularly that highly valuable manure, 
 guano. 

While I wish it understood that Lime is not under- 
 valued by me, but considered one of the valuables — 
 operating to change the nature of compounds — -liber- 
 ating useful material — and rendering soluble that 
 which is insoluble — still we are inclined to question 
 the propriety of too much use of this, independent of 
 other manures. An acre of wheat contains some 1 
 lbs. of lime, by analysis, exhibiting the necessity of 
 other manures than this, which must be supplied, if 
 not already on hand. Dr. Dana (Muck Manual, p. 
 45,) ,«ays: 

" All soil contains enough of lime, alkali, and other 
 inorganic elements for any crop grown on them." — 
 And this, too, for a great many generations, a repe ti 
 tion of cropping being pursued. It is also exhibited 
 by the same writer that the silicates, uretes, &c. being 
 according to chemical affiaity unavoidable, we are
