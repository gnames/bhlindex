required to disturb the combinations by creating new; 
 thus liberating, and rendering soluble the required 
 stimulus to growth. 

A little lime judiciously applied will operate fur 
 good, \yhile an excess will render inert that which 
 might have been food. 

Just so, " too much of a good thing is worse than 
 nothing." Super-geates made by lime are useless — 
 Too much devotion to one idea prevents improvement.

Here is a rare combination of salts and gein, and 
 is certainly one of the most powerful manures we 
 can apply. 

It is not necessary to refer to the surprising effects 
 produced on the waste lands of New Jersey, Mary- 
 land and Virginia for proof. Every one can see it 
 must be highly valuable, from its very strong array 
 of fertilizing materials. E. L. admits that it rapidly 
 imparts a high fertility to many soils." He continues 
 " it loses its virtues in a comparatively short period," 
 &c. 3Iay I not ask, what is lost by an increased 
 wheat crop of some eight or ten bushels per acre? — 
 Are we not paid too by increased manure piles ? 

One good crop of clover will be the means of pro- 
 ducing another. Its long tap roots penetrating the 
 lower soil will bring to the surface, in the stalk and 
 leaves to be embodied, (and, if plowed down, and 
 mixed with the upper mould by turning,) the en- 
 riching material of the lower earth made available 
 food for plants. 

Thus, may I not say, once begun, we have yearly 
 benefits dating to our first application of guano, a 
 hundred fold repaying. 

Gypsum in its power of collecting ammonia will 
 cause a larger growth of clover, and of any grain re- 
 quiring nitrogen. This is an expensive manure, and 
 so light as to be, apparently, almost too insignificant 
 to warrant the cost. Yet is not the impetus given to 
 our crop, oftentimes the means of enlarged growth 
 again and again ? 

I hope we consent to seize hold the chances of in- 
 creased fertility by other means than lime alone that 
 is more an agent than a manure. We will find our 
 lands grow fatter and our purses larger — our stigma 
 of being skinners removed and all classes benefitted.

 Poultry. 
 5Ir. Editor: — When modern poultry fanciers as- 
 sert that to be of pure breed, Shangbre's must be of 
 a particular color ; Cochin China's of a certain other 
 color; Polands entirely black, except the crest, which 
 must be white ; and Jersey Blues entirely blue ; do 
 they not go too far ? Is it not almost universally ad- 
 mitted, that domestication changes the color of ani- 
 mals, as well as birds ? Look, for instance, among 
 our turkeys, of comparatively recent domestication. 
 Have we have not the jet black, pure white, bronze, 
 and every intermediate shade ? Have we not also, 
 pure white, almost entirely black, and many shades 
 between, of Guinea fowls? So, too, might be instanced 
 on the best authority, particular cases of isolated pairs 
 of Canary birds, and Poland chickens, whose descen- 
 dants in a few years, materially changed their color. 
 Who would dare to assert that these are no longer 
 Turkeys, Guinea's, Polands or Canarys of pure 
 breeds ? 

Why should venders of particular breeds declaim 
 against the impurity of those sold by others, because 
 of color? And is it not equally absurd, to sweep in- 
 discriminately into one class of Mongrels, and en- 
 deavor thereby to stigmatize, all chickens that breed 
 of different colors ? Is it not known that these con- 
 temptible mongrels may, with care, be "bred to a 
 feather ?" But who desires so to do ? Is not a varie- 
 ty of coloring desirable, as well for beauty as to dis- 
 tinguish individuals ? Have we not already white, 
 red, speckled and buff Shanghae's? Might we not 
 have had a greater variety, had our importations been 
 direct from China, instead of London, where, no doubt, 
 the utmost care is taken to breed of a saleable color. 
 AVho that is disinterested can for a moment doubt, 
 that our Bucks county ostrich fowls were originally 
 derived from the same stock as Cochin Chinas or 
 ShanghMs, and that the Jersey Bluos are their cross 
 ed descendants ? Why then pay twenty, ten tr five 
 dollars for chickens 7iO heile?- than those we have or 
 caji have for six or eight cents per pound. 

As to the productiveness of different varieties let 
 fanciers tell their own tales. 

One asserts, to be the best, the Chittagong; (which 
 another pronounces a mongrel,) another a Poland; a 
 third the Black Spanish; a number the Shanghae, 
 buff and white, and Cochin China: and still a greater 
 number, the Creole.* Would it not appear from this 
 that individuals of every kind are prolific ? If a dis- 
 position existed to add to this excitement, instances 
 of productiveness could be given of dunghill mongrels 
 — is that low enough, Mrs. Shanghai — that would as- 
 tonish every thing but natives. 

Then again, these modem prodigies produce eggs
