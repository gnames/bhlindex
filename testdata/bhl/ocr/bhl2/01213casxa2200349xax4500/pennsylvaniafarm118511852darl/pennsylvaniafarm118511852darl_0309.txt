decision of the Committee respecting it. As a Sod 
 plow it worked admirably, effecting a complete invei'- 
 sion of sod and sufficient pulverization to cover entire- 
 ly every vestigo of grass. This was as effectually done 
 by the plows already named, though we think they had 
 somewhat the advantage in the thinness of the sod, 
 and lightness of the soil. 

To Hall and Speer of Pittsburg, the fifth premium 

was given for tiieir Iron Plow, l^o. 10. No imple- 
 ments on the ground attracted more attention than the 
 plows exhibited by these gentlemen. Finished in the 
 most beautiful style, and of a construction admirably 
 adapted to good work, the favorable impression crea- 
 ted by their appearance was strengthened by trial. 

IMany other plows of excellent make were entered 
 and to quite a number of which diplomas of merit 
 were awarded, and favorable mention made by the 
 Committee on implements. Our space will not enable 
 us to particularize. 

Grain Drills — Of these quite a number were exhi- 
 bited of the most approved construction. It being 
 impossible to test the merit of these drills by actual 
 trial, the Committee awarded diplomas to all. Seve- 
 ral of those exhibited were entirely new to us. The 
 principles npon which they were constructed ap- 
 peared to promise good work, but with the drill as 
 with the plow, we require to see them in actual ope- 
 ration before we feel willing to pass our opinion upon 
 them. And here we take the liberty of suggesting to 
 those who may have the selection of Committees for 
 the next State Fair, the propriety of appointing a se- 
 parate Committee, to each particular class of imple- 
 ments, in order that the true value of those exhibi- 
 ted may be fully understood. The award of a pre- 
 mium to any kind of implement, by a Committee of 
 the State Society, is a matter of no small moment, 
 and should therefore be made only after the most 
 careful investigation. First premium implements 
 generally command the best sale. Purchasers are 
 biassed in their favor, and more readily admit their 
 introduction on their farms, from the fact of their 
 having received the premium from a body Jof competent 
 judges. Hence the necessity of a greater number of 
 Committees, and vigilant care in the awards. One 
 of the pirincipal objects of a State Fair, is the more 
 general Introduction to public notice, of the very best 
 and most improved implements. To attain this ob- 
 ject no pains should be spared, and we think, that if 
 after the plowing match, a trial of the drills should 
 be made,it would be the most effective method of as- 
 certaining their true worth. 

Although we can speak only in general terms of the 
 large majority of Drills exhibited, we can particular- 
 ize a few, from the fact of having seen them in use, 
 and witnessed the result i when the grain sown by 
 them was ready for the harvest. One of these was 
 Moore's Patent, several of which were exhibited by 
 different makers. The drill of this patent, manufactu- 

red by Messrs. Lee, Pierce & Lee, of Ercildoun, Ches- 
 ter County, was certainly one of the most beautifully 
 finished implements on the ground and attracted 
 much attention, not merely from the elegance of its 
 finish, but the simplicity of its movements. "Wher- 
 ever these drils have been tried they have, we believe 
 given, satisfaction. We know of a number of farm- 
 ers who use them, aU of whom speak of tliem in the 
 highest terms. 

Custer's Drill, exhibited by Jenkins & Lamb, is 
 also an excellent implement, and is being extensively 
 introduced. 

Pennock's Drill, has been long and favorably 
 known, and is one of the first introduced of Ameri- 
 can invention, possessed of merit. It is a heavier im- 
 plement than Moore's and more complicated, but does 
 its work well. 

It havixg been rumored abroad that the citizens 
 of Ilarrisburg designed purchasing thirty acres of 
 ground, erecting on it permanent fencing, shedding, 
 &c., and donating it to the State Society upon the 
 condition that Ilarrisburg be selected as the perma- 
 nent place for holding the annual exhibitions of the 
 Society, several correspondents enquire whether 
 there is any foundation for the rumor, and if so, 
 whether it would be expedient for the Societj- to ac- 
 cept the proposition. 

In reply to the first inquiry we would state that we 
 have heard the same rumor, and believe there is truth 
 in it, although we cannot speak positively. 

As to the propriety of permanently locating the 
 State exhibitions at ani/ one particular plari\ we for 
 one cannot think it advisable, at least, not in the in- 
 fancy of the Society. The propriety of holding the 
 State fair permanently at Columbus, is a topic of dis- 
 cussion with our brethren of Ohio, and the editor of 
 the Cultivator speaks our views on this sulijoet so ful- 
 ly, and so much more clearly than we could, that we 
 copy his arguments against the proposition, thinking 
 them as well adapted to the climate of Pennsylvania 
 as of Ohio. So long as there are other towns in the 
 State, and there are several such, whose railroad fa- 
 cilities and accommodations are equal to those of Ilar- 
 risburg, just so long there will be claimants for the 
 exhibition. Already, several are in the field, and the 
 number will doubtless be increased. But hear Mr. 
 Bateham : — 

" The first and principal argument advanced, is 
 that by having permanent grounds appropriated and 
 fitted up for the purpose, as might be done here, a 
 heavy item of the expenses might be saved. Second: 
 the grounds and buildings, &c., would be more suit- 
 able and convenient than if designed merely for one 
 occasion. Third : the officers and their assistants, 
 clerks, police, &c., would become accustomed to their 
 work, and their duties would be better performed ; 
 and lastly, the hotel and boarding house keepers
