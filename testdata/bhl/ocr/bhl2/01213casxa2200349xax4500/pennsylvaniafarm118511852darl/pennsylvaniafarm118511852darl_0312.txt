[The Whole complete in Six Volumes, Royal Octavo, with 277 plates.] 

The figures in these three additional volumes comprise one hundred and twenty-one plates, fine color- 
 ed, mostly of new subjects, or such as have not been before published in the Sylva, executed with the strict- 
 est fidelity to nature, under the eye of the Author. Additional remarks on the uses and economy of the 
 Forest Trees of the I nited States will also be given, so as to complete, as far as possible the requisite infor- 
 mation on this important subject. 

It is quite unnecessary to say anything in praise of JIICIIAUX'S magnificent work on the Forest Trees 
 of ourcountry â€” the well established reputation of NUTTALL, the autlior of the additional part of the 
 work, is a sufficient guarantee for its accuracy and the style of its execution. The plates are finely and care- 
 fully coloured equal to French editions ; and the twcKWorks form the most splendid series ever published 
 in America. 

The persons who possessed the former edition of MICHAUX'S work can procure the three addi-ional 
 volumes by NUTTALL separately, and thus complete their copies. 

CONDITIONS. 
 The whole work in six volumes. Royal Octavo, in gilt edges, and gold stamped cloth, or in stamped 
 sheep, will be furnished for forty-five dollars. 

Or in extra full turkey gilt, for fifty-five dollars.
