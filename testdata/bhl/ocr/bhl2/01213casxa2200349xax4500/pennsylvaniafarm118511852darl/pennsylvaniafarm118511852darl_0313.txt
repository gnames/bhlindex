So many accideiitshave happened from lightning during the past 
 Summer, Ihat every prudent and careful farmer should at once 
 adopt such means as will be most eiTectnal in preventing them — 
 When it is remembered that certain safety may be secured at a 
 very trifling expense, it becomes the duty of every farmer and 
 good citizen to avail himself the proffered means By so doing, 
 he not only secures his property from fire by lightning, but pro- 
 tects also his family and tho;e around him. These are important 
 considerations and should have great weight. Those who desirea 
 a Lightning Rod, p'onnunced by the first Scientific men in our 
 country, the very best in use, will find it on application to THOS.
