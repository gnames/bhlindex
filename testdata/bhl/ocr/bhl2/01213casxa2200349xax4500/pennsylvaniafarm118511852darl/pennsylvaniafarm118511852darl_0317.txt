Agricultural Educatlou. 

Although discussions on agricultural education 
 have occupied a good deal of space in the Farm 
 Journal, the subject has not received more attention 
 than it deserves. Our own views are given to a cer- 
 tain extent in our notice of Mr. Russell's plan for an 
 Agricultural College, on page 59, to which we refer 
 our readers, as well as to the essays of our correspon- 
 dents upon the same subject. 

Agriculture being more important than all other 
 branches of industry combined, its good or bad con- 
 dition must aflfect the welfare of the country in a 
 greater degree than the fluctuations of any other in- 
 dustrial pursuit. It is therefore important that a 
 knowledge of its principles should be taught as sys- 
 tematically and as fully as in Law or Bledicine. 

When those who are interested directly or indirect- 
 ly in the cultivation of the soils are disposed to give 
 their sons a liberal education they have no resource 
 but to send them to institutions where more attention 
 is paid to literature and the studies required by pro- 
 fessional students, than to science ; and as a result, 
 the farmer's son soon acquires a distaste for the pur- 
 suits of his father, and fancies he may have a genius 
 for becoming a lawyer, doctor, or retailer of merchan- 
 dise. This accounts for the number of professional 
 men and retailers which swarm in every town of any 
 size. 

This evil would be lessened if agricultural colleges 
 were established, in which this and collateral branch- 
 es of science would be taught. Let agriculture be 
 cnderstood as a science, and it takes rank as a pro- 
 fession, with all the dignity which professional pur- 
 suits acquire, from the extent to which they give 
 employment to the reasoning faculties. 

A college of this kind would be adapted in a great 
 degree to the higher educational wants ef the coun-

try; and as it would be frequented by many students 
 who wish to have a more practical education than 
 they can get in esclusivcly literary institutions, tliese 
 would be compelled to modify or extend their course 
 of instruction. The result would be a rise in the 
 general standard of education, so that agricultural 
 colleges would be the final triumph of our educational 
 system. 

The information disseminated by these institutions 
 would have a tendency to advance the general stand- 
 ard of education, and its influence would be very ben- 
 eficial, even in the case of those students who would 
 not become practical agriculturists after completing 
 their course ; as they would be able to discuss and 
 explain the various subjects which are continually 
 presenting themselves in an agricultural community. 

There are materials enough within reach to enable 
 a legislative committee to decide upon the extent and 
 organization of an institution of this kind so that it 
 need not be discussed here ; but dev9ted as we are 
 to the great farming interest, we call the attention 
 of our legislators to this most important subject, with 
 the hope that it will be acted upon at the earliest pos- 
 sible period. 

The employment of agricultural lecturers to tra- 
 verse the State, has been proposed ; but this would 
 not be sufiiciently practical ; and it would be very 
 difficult to collect audiences among a, population 
 which is necessarily thinly distributed. 

Mice in Barns. — A writer in the Sural New York- 
 er, who has suffered greatly by these pests to the 
 farmer, states that he has found that hay-mows hav- 
 ing speur-mint in them, were free from rats and mice 
 while others, in the same barn, having none of thii 
 herb scattered about, were nearly destroyed by them. 
 Other experienced farmers concur in the opinion that 
 spearmint is a complete antidote against their opera 
 tions. This is an easily tried remedy, and our farm- 
 ers, suffering from the same cause, are recommended 
 to apply it.
