For the Farm Journal. 
 Guaiio. 

As this subject has not occupied much space in the 
 Farm Journal, and indeed some experiments have 
 been detailed rather discouraging and unfavorable to 
 its use, it may be vrell to examine the matter a little 
 and a few remarks are here oifered more vs'ith a vievr 
 to elk-it than to convey information. 

The farmers of this State have, perhaps, made less 
 use of it than in adjoining States, probably more from 
 want of appreciation of its value, than that the in- 
 crease of their crops and the value of their land would 
 not have been promoted. It is inconceivable that a 
 manure, which has restored and made productive and 
 quadrupled in value many of the worn out farms in 
 Virginia, Maryland and Delaware, and in every oth- 
 er State where it has been tried, a largely increased 
 quantity is annually demanded, should not be very 
 valuable to the farmers of Pennsylvania. In Great 
 Britain, the amount imported last year was over 160,- 
 000 tons, being a steady increase, excepting in one 
 year, since 1841. 

In regard to the use of lime, some of our Chester 
 county farmers when asked as to the best method of 
 applying it, whether fresh from the kiln, or after ir 
 has again become a carbonate ; whether in spring or 
 fall ; on sod or mellow ground ; have replied, that 
 the main thing is to get it on. Now this getting it 
 on, does not seem, from all accounts, to be all that is 
 necessary with respect to guano, for its active prinoi- 
 ciple, volatile salts, may easily (jd off, and pass away 
 into the atmosphere and be lost. 

What general rules must be observed in the appli- 
 cation or preparation of guano ? 

Under what circumstances of the atmosphere, or 
 season of the year, is its efficiency most promoted ? 

Is there any important difference in the qualities 
 of guano ? 

To what crops is it most serviceable, or is it equal 
 ly beneficial to all ? 

IIow and in what quantities should it bo applied ? 

These are questions in which every reader of the 
 Farm Journal is interested, and it is hoped that 
 those who have experimented with it, will be willing 
 to contribute their experience. In the vicinity of 
 West Chester are about the best farms and farmers 
 in Pennsylvania. Where over one hundred bushels of 
 com has been raised to the acre without manure, 
 forty to fifty of wheat, eighty and ninety of oats, it 
 might well bo thought guano was not badly needed, 
 and accordingly very littU has been used, till the 
 present fall, when we have supplied from our agricul. 
 tural warehouse a: considerable quantity of the gou- 
 uiue Peruvian article for the wheat crop, and shall 
 bo able by another season to speak of its effect as 
 compared with barn yard manure for wheat, on good 
 coils. 

1st. As regards the general rules for its application. 
 It is mostly conceded that it ought to be plowed in, 
 immediately after sowing and neither left on the sur- 
 face or merely harrowed in, otherwise the highly vo- 
 latile carbonate of ammonia, the active principle of 
 good guano is dissipated and in a measure lost. — 
 There have been instances where it was sown in tha 
 bottom of a deep furrow, and stirred in afterwards 
 with the subsoil plow, and the benefit felt for several 
 croppings. There is probably more danger of it» 
 being covered too shallow than too deep. A go«d 
 plan doubtless is, to prepare it some time befow 
 using, by mixing it with plaster, say one part of plas- 
 ter to three of guano. The sulphuric acid of the 
 plaster having a greater afiinity for anmionia than for 
 lime, unites with it, making a sulphate of ammonia,^ 
 which is not volatile, and is soluble in water, a per- 
 maaent manure thus being produced. The use of 
 plaster with guano, would probably reconcile the con- 
 flicting statements about its durability. 

In respect to the season of the year to apply it. I 
 would recommend the fall by all means, either for 
 winter or spring crops. Plow it in deep in the fall, 
 so as to be dissolved and incorporated through the 
 soil by the rain and snows of winter, and to bo ready 
 for immediate action on the roots of growing crops. 
 If that is impossible let it be applied broad-cast im- 
 mediately before or at the time of rain. It has been 
 observed that the effect of guano, as of plaster, wta» 
 not so perceptible in a very dry season. 

As to the different kinds of gtiano in the market, 
 careful analysis has settled the question, that its va- 
 lue consists in its containing cliifjiij ammoniacal salts, 
 phosphate of lime, with some animal matter, and the 
 proportions of these determine the quality. An ana- 
 lysis of Peruvian, Chilian and African resulted as &lr 
 lows :

Peruvian guano commands the highest price in th» 
 market, and is most to be relied on, as is shown by 
 the above. 

The " prepared and improved guanos," so much 
 extolled by the manufacturers, should be entirely tlis- 
 carded. There is no doubt about their being "pr«- 
 piared," but very much about their being " improved." 
 The preparation may consist of about ninety per ceat. 
 of soil, with a pinch of bonedu.st, and charcoal for a 
 coloring matter. Those who are resolved on put- 
 chasing these nostrums, should insist, where so much 
 soil is used, that it, at least, should be of a fair qual 

ity. 

In respect to the kinds of crops, where it may 1)« 
 used. The experience of the country seems to shoTr, 
 as its constituent principles would also demonstrate, 
 that it is applicable to every kind of field and garden 
 CTops, fruits, flowers and vegetables. Aa eminent
