The author of the article referred to observes, that 
 the well known influence exerted by the moon in 
 causing the tides, has tended to keep the idea of the 
 extension of her power in the production of other phy- 
 sical phenomena, including the ordinary changes of 
 the weather. But the r.gency which gives rise to the 
 tidal wave, is purely one of gravitation, whilst that 
 governing the changing conditions of the atmosphere, 
 connected with wet and dry weather, is mainly tem- 
 perature. Watery vapor owes its suspension in the 
 atmosphere entirely to heat, deprived of which through 
 any means, it becomes condensed, giving rise to 
 clouds, rain, and other aqueous precipitations. The 
 (juestion of wet or dry weather, is therefore one of 
 temperature alone, mih which the moon has nothing 
 to do, the only agency eserted by hor being limited 
 to the power of gravitation. It is by thus drawing 
 the proper distinction lietween two mighty agents 
 operating in the production of natural phenomena, 
 namely gravitation and temperature, that we are 
 enabled to understand, why the moon may influence 
 the affairs of our planet in one way, and yet liave no 
 power to control the states of the weather. 

After referring to the supposed agencies exerted 
 by the moon upon animal substances, vegetable 
 growth, &c., and giving rational and very interesting 
 explanations of them, the article concludes with the 
 following statement of principles regarded as demon- 
 strated : 

1st. Wet and dry weather, are matters regulat«d 
 Bolely by changes of temperature, over whicli the 
 moon has no control : 

2d. The mutual influence exerted between the 
 earth %mi moon, as shown in the ocean and atmos- 
 pheric tides, depends upon the play of another and 
 entirely distinct principle, namely gravitation or at- 
 traction. 

3d. Most, if not all the effects upon animal and ve- 
 gc'.able substances, popularly ascribed to the action 
 rf)f the moon, are to be traced to natural agencies, en- 
 tirely independent of this satellite. 

Kotwitstanding our skepticism in regard to the 
 supposed influence exerted by the moon at certain 
 of her so-called changes,— for, as Mr. Taggart has 
 truly remarked, real changes she has none,— still we 
 «iWinot help thinking, that mauy who have been led 
 iby iheir credulity to a strict observance of lunar 
 ^hacfes received benefits irom so doing, simply lie- 
 .oause tlipy were impelled to greater exactness in

Daukos is the ancient Greek name of the carrot. 

It belongs to the 5th class Pentandria, and 2d or- 
 der Digijnia in the Artificial System of Linnaeus. It 
 belongs to the natural order tfmbdlifera, and tribe 
 Dancinm in the Flora of Nortli America. 

Between forty and fifty species of the genua are 
 known ; one of these found in the Soutliern Statef, 
 and one which is thought to be only a variety of the 
 Southern one, is found west of the Rocky JIuuntains. 

The one under consideration is a native of the 
 East, and has long been under cultivation, and in 
 this situation presents sever.al strongly marked varie- 
 ties. The wild carrot is the common cultivated one 
 in a wild condition. It is only when it escapes from 
 cultivation aud degenerates into a useless weed that 
 it becomes a nuisance. I have seen whole districts 
 covered with it, choking out almost every other spe- 
 cies of vegetRtion, and although only a biennial, when 
 it thus takes the field, it is extremely difficult to be 
 defeated, being a great producer of seeds, like the 
 mullen, rag weel, and cheat, it springs up whenever 
 the conditions by wliioh it is surrounded prove favor- 
 able for its gerniiua4ion. 

It grows from two to four feet high, erect, round, 
 furrowed, hairy, and branched ; the leaves below are 
 lari-o, all cut winged and gnashed ; those on the stalk 
 gradually smaller toward the top, all cut and hairy. 

The flowers are on long footstalks, disposed in the 
 form of the braces of an umbrella, which when in 
 flower, form a fiat surface on the top, but when the 
 fruit begins to ripen, they draw together in the mid- 
 dle, and often present somewhat the appearance of a 
 bird's nest, whence one of its common names. 

The flowers are white or yellowisli ; the fruit is 
 en'g shaped and partially covered with bristle-like 
 hairs, they have a light aromatic smell aad a warm 
 aci'id taste. 

The roots of the wild carrot are frequently given to 
 children as a vermifuge. The expressed juice is used 
 in calculus complaints, and for the sore mouths of 
 infants, and a poultice of the scraped carrot is first 
 on the list among our domestic remedies, to abate 
 pain and remove the stench of foul ulojra. 

When under proper cultivation it becomes one of 
 the most important vegetables. They are raised in 
 Europe in prodigious quantities; the white Belgian 
 produces sometimes thirty tons to the acre. They 
 are used extensively mixed witii flour to make bread. 
 Horses and all kinds of stock are fond of them, and 
 the butter made from cows fed on them, is of th« 
 finest quality. One hundred bushels of carrots con- 
 tain as much nutriment as one ton of hay. They are 
 said to contain fourteen per cent, of casein and starch.
