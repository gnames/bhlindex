The carrot has been found to bo very productive 
 in this country. In an article in the Farmer's Month- 
 ly Visitor, dated Concord, Nov. 7th, 1845, it is stated 
 that 304^ bushels were raised on one-fourth of an 
 an acre. 

In the Genessee Farmer, for January, 1840, it is 
 stated 410 bushels were raised on one-fourth of an 
 acre, which would be equal to 1640 bushels on one 
 acre, equivalent to almost IGJ tons of hay. 1000 
 bushels are frequently raised on an acre, which from 
 the fact that it is one of the hardiest of the root crop 
 and at the same time possessing so many valuable 
 qualities, must sooner or later recommend its cultiva- 
 tion more general and extensive.

The last combination of oxygen, which we shall 
 notice, is that with manganese, the protoxijd and the 
 peroxyd of manganese. These are closely related to 
 the piotoxyd and peroxyd of iron, and their proper- 
 ties are nearly the same. Almost all soils, and many 
 plants, contain a small portion of one or the other of 
 these oxyds. 

Not oxygen only, but nitrogen also, forms combi- 
 nations with other substances. Among these of spe- 
 cial importance to the farmer, is the combination of 
 nitrogen and hydrogen, forming ammonia — which 
 acts so important a part in vegetable economy. Am- 
 monia consists of four parts nitrogen and one part 
 hydrogen. It belongs to the class of basic salts, as 
 it re-acts with acids in the same manner as potash, 
 soda, &c. Ammonia never occurs free, but always in 
 combination with hydrochloric acid, as salammoniac. 
 It is formed likewise in the process of putrefaction 
 and decay, and by the dry distillation of nitrogenous 
 organic substances. It appears also in the exhala- 
 tions of certain animals and plants, and is produced 
 in all the processes of oxidation which take place 
 under the simultaneous influence of air and water. — 
 To procure ammonia as a gas, salammoniac and fresh 
 burnt lime are mixed and heated in a retort. The 
 caustic lime unites with the chlorine forming chloride 
 of calcium, and the ammonia is given off as a gas,

which is collected in a receiver over mercury. For 
 the production of aqua ammonia " WouliFe's appa- 
 ratus" (fig. 15,) is employed. Ammonia has a strong 
 affinity for water. With the acids it forms salts, 
 which are readily soluble, and when not present in 
 excess, exert a very favorable influence on vegetation. 
 Ammonia, whether pure or mixed with water, is ex- 
 ceedingly volatile, and hence is constantly escaping 
 from dung heaps and manure pits. But when com- 
 bined with an acid, it loses its volatility, and unless 
 again decomposed will remain unchanged and un- 
 wastcd in the soil. Various other substances, such 
 as alumina, also possess the power of absorbing and 
 retaining ammonia. The ammonia in manure may 
 be fixed by strewing earth or gypsum over it ; or by 
 adding sulphuric acid to the urine and occasionally 
 pouring the mixture over the manure heap. As cul- 
 tivated soils always contain more or less decaying on- 
 ganic matter, this constantly furnishes opportunity 
 for the formation of ammonia, and hence scarcely 
 any soil is found to be wholly destitute of it. Am- 
 monia is very readily decomposed into its chief ele- 
 ments, by growing plants ; and as plants require 
 large quantities of nitrogen and hydrogen for their 
 sustenance, it is evident how beneficial to them must 
 be the presence of ammonia in the soil. The excess 
 of ammonia beyond what can be taken up by the 
 acid present, frequently causes horse manure, when 
 recent, to destroy or burn up vegetation if applied in 
 dry weather on poor sandy soils. Horse manure, 
 from its very nature, produces an abundance of am- 
 monia ; and consequently requires, during its decom- 
 position, a large amount of acid to neutralize or fix 
 the ammonia. But, on sandy soils and in dry weath- 
 er, the requisite quantity of acid is not supplied, and 
 thus the ammonia acts destructively as a caustic. — 
 A similar result follows the application of other ma- 
 nures in a fresh or rank state. Fresh urine also acts 
 thus destructively on vegetation : but this can readily 
 be prevented by mixing sulphuric acid with such 
 urine till eflervescence ceases to take place. In ad- 
 dition to what they receive from the soil, plants like- 
 wise absorb ammonia from the atmosphere. Ammo- 
 nia, as has been stated before, readily combines with 
 all aeids. One such combination is the carbonate oj 
 ammonia, which plants eagerly take up, and which 
 is rapidly produced when warm and damp weather 
 favor and promote the decomposition of organic sub- 
 stances. The carbonate of ammonia, when abund- 
 ant in the soil, causes the cereals especially to shoot 
 up suddenly, with weak spindling stems, having a 
 tendency to lodge, and producing small, imperfect 
 grain. In such cases the formation of carbonic acid 
 and ammonia is predominant, and the decomposition 
 of the more earthy substances is retarded or prevent- 
 ed. 

The sulphate of ammonia has already been advert- 
 ed to, when speaking of gypsum. It is a resulting
