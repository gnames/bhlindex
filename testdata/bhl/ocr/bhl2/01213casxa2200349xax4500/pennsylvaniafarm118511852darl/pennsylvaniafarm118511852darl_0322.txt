product in the manufacture of gas from bituminous 
 ooal, and where it can be procured at a ^ow price, 
 may be usefully employed by the farmer. If applied 
 to soils containing much carbonate of lime and mag- 
 nesia, it vrill speedily be decomposed, producing gyp- 
 gum, sulphate of magnesia, &c. ■which cannot Ijut 
 prove beneficial to the soil. The muriate of ammonia 
 lal ammoniac, as also the nitrate of ammonia, are 
 ^cellent fertilizers ; but as the application of them 
 ■would be too expensive for practical use, ■vre shall 
 pass them by -svithout further notice. Of much great- 
 er importance and value, on the other hand, is the 
 phosphate of ammonia, 'which is introduced into the 
 »oil by urine, and supplies it •with tvro substances 
 Tcry essential to vegetation — phosphorus and nitro- 
 gen. It is therefore the more to be regretted that the 
 use of the pure salt is attended with too great expense 
 to be at all admissable in practical farming. The 
 phosphate of ammonia contained in urine, undergoes 
 decomposition, as soon as it meets with the carbon- 
 istes of lime or magnesia in the soil, or with the prot- 
 oxyds or peroxyds of iron or manganese; — the phos- 
 phoric acid parting from the ammonia, and uniting 
 ■with one of these bases. And since all soils contain 
 at least one of these substances, and the phosphates 
 influence plants mainly by means of the phosphoric 
 acid tliey contain, it makes very little difference whe- 
 tiier we employ phosphate of lime or phosphate of 
 ammonia, as manure; for, though phosphate of lime 
 bo insoluble in water, it is soluble in humic acid, 
 ■whjch is found in all cultivated soils. 

Another combination interesting to the farmer, is 
 that of hydrogen with chlorine, forming hydrochloric 
 or muriatic acid. This acid is procured by pouring 
 dilute sulphuric acid on commBn salt, in a retort 
 Mid collecting the gas evolved, in the pneumatic 
 trough over mercury. Muriatic acid in combination 
 ■with soda forms common salt. It has all the proper- 
 ties of an acid, yet but slightly promotes vegetation, 
 because plants in general require ver}' little chlorine. 
 Pure salt acts on plants only by means of the soda 
 it contains, and must be applied in smill quantity 
 only, not to bo injurious. 

In conclusion we shall notice the substance termed 
 Immus. Formerly it was thought that plants grew 
 and became developed only by absorbing, through 
 their roots, an aqueous solution of humus, and digest- 
 ing or assimilating it. Subsequently humus was sub- 
 jected to a more rigid examination, and was found to 
 oontain several combinations of oxygen. The first 
 and more common of these was called humic acid, 
 and was regarded as the proper pabulum or nutri- 
 ment of plants. The still more recent investigations 
 of Liebig, however, have shown that this humic acid 
 is not destined to enter plants in that form. Ac- 
 oording to Liebig's views, humus and humic acid 
 have no direct agency in nourishing plants, but hu- 
 snus is merely intended to be gradually acted on by 

the oxygen of the atmosphere, decomposed and con- 
 verted into carbonic acid ; which is then absorbed, aa 
 a gas, by the plants, and decomposed into its ele- 
 ments, carbon and oxygen. The carbon is appropri- 
 ated and assimilated by the plants, but the oxygen 
 is, in the main, again returned into tbe atmosphere. 
 Humus consists of the remains of pre-existing plants 
 and animals,deoomposed by putrefaction and dec.ay,but 
 which hlave not yet become combined with the oxygen 
 of the atmosphere, nor commenced a new career of cii^ 
 culation as carbonic acid. As many accidental causes 
 may concur to prevent the perfect decomposition of 
 these remains in the soil, so also the humus itself 
 may be more or less decomposable. Some kinds hav« 
 in a greater or less degree assumed the form and cha- 
 racter of mineral coal or carbonaceous matter, and 
 from this cause offer more protracted resistance to th« 
 action of oxygen, and are besides less soluble in tbis 
 state than other kinds are. This has been denomi- 
 nated carbonized humus, and constitutes the principal 
 portion of the black, friable and turfy soils. Anoth- 
 er species of humus has become combined with an 
 acid, acetic acid, for instance, and thus resists furth- 
 er decomposition. This is the acid humus. On the 
 contrary, that kind of humus which is readily suscep- 
 tible of decomposition by oxygen, is called mild hu- 
 mus, whilst humic acid is that form of humus which 
 already contains a greater proportion of oxygen, 
 though still not enough to enable it to assume a 
 gaseous state as carbonic acid.' Wherever much so- 
 luble humus exists, there much carbonic acid must b« 
 formed and plants are supplied plentifully with nu- 
 triment. Now, since humus has originated from the 
 decomposition of vegetable and animal remains, and 
 these do not consist of carbonaceous matter exclusiv®- 
 ly, but also of hydrogen, nitrogen, sulphur, phosphor- 
 us, potash, itc, the source of the efficiency of humui 
 in supporting vegetable life is sufficiently obvious. — 
 Superadded to this is the fact, that nearly all those 
 substances are present in a soluble state, and can 
 theiefore the more readily be absorbed and assimi- 
 lated by plants. Another favorable effect of humui 
 is that it serves to keep the soil loose and porous, thui 
 enaliling the roots of plants to penetrate it with ease 
 in all directions, and allowing the oxygen of the at- 
 mosphere to enter and penetrate it — thus facilitating 
 decomposition and the preparation of aliment for fu- 
 ture crops. Yet none of these advantages would re- 
 sult from even an increased abundance of humus, if 
 that substance did not possess the property of absorb- 
 ing a very large amount of moisture from the atmos- 
 phere, and retaining it; so that a soil containing much 
 humus, will also retain moisture much longer than 
 any other. During the decomposition of humus several 
 kinds of acids may be produced, which, if not suffi- 
 ciently concentrated, will arrest or retard its thorougjh 
 decomposition or transformation. When this is the 
 case the humus becomes acid and unfitted to sup-
