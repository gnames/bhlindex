port Tegetation. Marshy or boggy soils generally 
 contain much acid humus. The excess of acid in 
 Uiem may he detected by boiling an ounce or two of 
 the soil in rain vrater, and dipping litmus paper in 
 the solution. If this turn red, there is an excess of 
 add in the soil. Soils rendered infertile by acid hu- 
 mus, may be reclaimed by a dressing of carbonate 
 of lime or -wood ashes, which will combine with the 
 acid and form a neutral salt. 

It is, however, not sufficient that the farmer pos- 
 sess a knowledge of the different substances which 
 have been enumerated. He must also know which 
 •f them are most requisite or essential to the growth 
 of plants; which of them are supplied by the soil, 
 and which of thera are derived from the atmosphere ; 
 as also, what means are to be used to furnish plants 
 aX all times with their necessary aliment. This leads 
 ns, in tlie next place, to the consideration of the nour- 
 ishment of plants. Plants develope themselves and 
 grow by receiving their aliment in part from the soil 
 and in part from the air. From the soil they receive 
 •arbonic acid combined with oxyds, and ammonia 
 eombined with acids, in so far as these salts are solu- 
 ble in water. With water they receive also those in- 
 •ombustible substances which are not presented to 
 them in a gaseous form, but which occur only in the 
 •oil and being dissolved by water are thus furnished 
 to the plants — such as silicic acid, potash, soda, mag- 
 nesia, lime, phosphorus, sulphur, iron and manga- 
 nese. These substances are taken up partly in com- 
 bination with carbonic acid, and in part they are 
 converted into salts by the acids generated in conse- 
 quence of the excess of oxygen or chlorine. From the 
 air plants derive oxygen, but chiefly carbonic acid 
 and ammonia, and the extremely minutely divided 
 particles or atoms of substances originally not vola- 
 tile. All these are appropriated and assimilated by 
 plants according to their natural affinities or propen- 
 sities, so that one receives more of one particular sub- 
 stance and another of another. Even the several 
 parts of the same plant require for their proper de- 
 velopement more of one substance than of another. 
 Thus, the stem or stalk of a cereal plant contains 
 much silicic acid, while a greater proportion of phos- 
 phorus, or sulphur, or nitrogen is found in the seed 
 W grain. Other plants again contain more carbon, 
 or lime, or carbonic acid, or nitrogen, or oxygen, &c. 
 (ki this difference in the requirements and constitu- 
 ents of plants is based the theory or system of a 
 rotation of crops. But there is another chief differ- 
 ence in the constituent elements of plants to which 
 TTe must pay attention, and which is of the utmost 
 importance. If a vegetable be burned, or a plant or 
 animal die and decay, a portion of its component in- 
 gredients passes off invisibly into the air in a gaseous 
 form. These aie those elements of plants and ani- 
 mals, which originally consisted of gaseous substances 
 aad which now reserve their original form. These 

elements are likewise, in the main, supplied to plants 
 from the atmosphere; and are, as it were, condensed 
 or solidified in them, subsequently to resume again 
 their native gaseous form. These subst.mces are 
 termed volatile or combustible. But after the incin- 
 eration or decay of plants or animals, there remain 
 as ashes, certain other substances which were origi- 
 nally derived from the soil. These are the non-vola- 
 tile, indestructible or incombustible substances — th« 
 earths, the metals, phosphorus, and sulphur, &c. — 
 These remains are usually called ashes. The rela- 
 tive quantities of combustible and incombustible mat- 
 ter which plants contain is always in proportion to 
 the quantity of aliment derived by them from the at- 
 mosphere or the soil respectively. To the farmer th« 
 indestructible or incombustible elements of plants 
 are the more important, because the gaseous elements 
 can be, and in most instances are supplied by the at- 
 mosphere. Plants cannot themselves produce those 
 elements, but must find them already prepared for 
 their use, if they are to thrive vigorously. Now the 
 preparation of these necessary alimentary substances 
 is almost constantly going on in the soil and in ths 
 air ; and the farmer has for the most part only to taks 
 measures that the requisite quantities are supplied to 
 the crops in due season. Ho must also know which 
 and how much of the several substances they need, 
 because otherwise he may make a wasteful or inju- 
 rious application of his materials. Furthermore, ths 
 difference between the amount of combustible and in- 
 combustible matters contained by a plant deserves to 
 be noted. As but a small proportional quantity of 
 ashes remains after incineration, it is manifest that 
 plants require for their growth a much larger quan- 
 tity of gaseous or jeriform, tlian of solid substances. 
 Nor is the fact unimportant, practically, that plants, 
 in order to thrive, require that the alimentary Bub- 
 stances they need should be present or be presented 
 in certain relative quantities. An excess of one in 
 proportion to another may frequently arrest growth 
 and developement altogether. The incombustibl* 
 elements are more apt to be present in excess than 
 the other, because a very small quantity of them is 
 usually needed, and an over-supply may consequent- 
 ly the more readily occur; and if one of these sub- 
 stances be much more soluble than the rest, it may 
 easily cause the destruction of the plants. But it not 
 unfrequently happens, also, that there is an entire 
 absence or want of some particular substance; which 
 must then be supplied, unless, as is sometimes ths 
 case, the plants have it in their power to substituta 
 other substances in lieu of it. It is likewise an as- 
 certained fact that different ;lants possess in very dif- 
 ferent degrees the power of assimilating nutriment; 
 and this difference is found to obtain even in different 
 varieties of the same species of plants. It probably 
 results from or depends on the greater or smaller ds- 
 "■ree of vegetative power with which each particular
