plant is naturally endowed. The farmer may turn 
 this fact to account, by cultivating plants possessing 
 the higher degree of vegetative power, in soils which 
 do not part with their nutritious matters as readily 
 aa others ; while his richer soils are allotted to those 
 plants which possess a more feeble vegetative power.

 Agricultural Education—Change of Seed, &c, 
 Mr. Editor : — Permit me to congratulate you upon 
 the indications that the Fai-ni Jovrnal is about to be- 
 come the " hand-book" of Pennsylvania farmers. To 
 give the most profitable effect to agricultural essays 
 they should be made up of thought, observation and 
 experience gathered in the midst of their readers. — 
 Foreign facts are always more or less weakened in 
 their influences, by the suspicion, at least, that they 
 are surrounded by untold or unexplained circum- 
 stances. With regard to this peculiar subject, there 
 is reason, then, why a farmer should read the produc- 
 tions which emanate from kindred thought and ac- 
 tion. Zealots in agriculture could not fail to be 
 pleased with the practical character of your January 
 number. " The importance of Agricultural Educa- 
 cation," which graces its first pages, I trust may 
 make its impression upon many readers. If the 
 farmer, unlearned himself, would but be convinced, 
 how much pleasure and happiness he has it in his 
 power to bestow upon the whole future life of his 
 children ; — if he would but believe that his heavy 
 hand is constantly pressing upon the germ of intel- 
 lect, buried in the mind of his own ofispring, which 
 only wants an opportunity and his aid to enable it to 
 spring into liberty, and light, and life ; — if he would, 
 in his imagination, but follow his untaught boy as 
 he follows the plow, and through the medium of his 
 unenlightened countenance enquire the subject of his 
 thought, and find it to be but a single grade above 
 that of the animal he drives ; if his heart did not 
 gink within him it would bo because he had no heart 
 for grief. But if, on the contrary, he found there a 
 countenance brightened by it: own thought — a pur- 
 suit of labor made easy by the intellectual hope that 
 that his observations and discoveries were adding 
 something to the stock of knowledge — if when sur- 
 rounding the evening fire, he had the advantage ef a 
 mind which constantly recurred to its own resources, 
 which brought home its own reflections upon its own 
 observations, that was always adding something new 
 to the ear of a willing hearer, there would be a plea- 
 sure in this which may be better imagined than de- 
 scribed. And this is " the importance of Agricultu- 
 ral Education." 

In my practical' operations on the farm, I have 
 made it a rule to doubt all dogmas. That theory for 
 which no reason has been assigned, and none can be 
 imagined, should be suspected, at least. The article 
 " on change of Seed" deserves attention, the more so 
 b cause it is from the pen of one so able to bring the 

light of philosophy to the aid of practical experience- 
 It has become almost a self-evident truth, with farm- 
 ers, that seed should be changed, but with us the 
 change is* not only of the seed, but from sandy or 
 slate land to limestone land ; and vice versa. It is 
 not to be denied that profitable results have been at- 
 tained by this change ; the experience of very many 
 attest the fact. " My observation is decidedly against 
 it." And in my judgment, the exper'enje of others 
 on this point is found in the fact, that he who goes 
 from home after seed, goes after (jeod seed, better 
 than Ilia own. But if there be any thing true in nature, 
 it is, " none but the best and most perfect should be 
 used for the re-production of its kind." How pro- 
 cure it? To prepare fifty bushels of seed, takeseventy 
 five, and blow it down to the required quantity, then 
 wash it in water made slightly salt, partially dry it, 
 and to make it feed regularly in the drill, mix a little 
 plaster-paris with it and run it fast through the rol- 
 ling screen. The product of seed, thuSj prepared will 
 afford your neighbors additional proof of the advan- 
 tage of going abroad after good seed. The difierence 
 will be as great as the effect of fcod upon a well- 
 groomed horse, and one never touched by a brush or 
 curry-comb. But it is said " this takes so much 
 trouble and labor," — so it does, and we rejoin : — -it is 
 labor most profitably spent. 

In reply to a query put by the writer, I reply that 
 it is never deemed judicious to sow old seed when 
 you have new wheat of good quality. Old wheat 
 does not exhibit the evidence of want of vitality. It 
 may have been heated, and its germinating power 
 thereby destroyed, and this the eye cannot discover. 
 But new wheat, prepared as I have suggested, never 
 wants vitality, and is ready to spring into life as soon 
 as committed to the soil. 

Elton's " Small Potatoes vs. Large Potatoes for 
 seed," is another illustration of the value of good 
 seed ; and it would have been just as forcible with- 
 out the reason that small potatoes are sometimes of 
 the second growth. 

In the article on " Wheat Culture" your composi- 
 tor has made me to say that wheat may be sowed at 
 any time " before" the first of September — instead 
 of after that period. Feed'k. Watts.

Mr. Editor: — Bear Sir — I have received your 
 •Journal from its commencement. I also receive sev- 
 eral of the leading Agricultural Publications of the 
 country, and I think the " Farm .Journal" is behind 
 none in Practical and Scientific instruction. If eve- 
 cry cultivator of the soil in the State of Pennsylva- 
 nia would subscribe for your .Journal, and then read 
 and follow its teachings as far as they may be appli- 
 cable to their particular situations, not being afraid
