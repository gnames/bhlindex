of that hug-hear called Book-farm imj, but willing to 
 learn from the Practical experience of others, even 
 if it should be found recorded in a Book â€” I am con- 
 fident they could not expend a dollar to better ad- 
 vantage. 

If each of your readers would furnish you a page 
 of their experience, from time to time, in the man- 
 agement of their farms, stock, &c., I am sure it 
 would assist you very much in your efforts to furnish 
 them a useful and interesting Journal, As making 
 a beginning, I have a mind to give you my methed 
 of protecting fruit trees from being girdled by mice, 
 Some of your readers that may be so fortunate as not 
 to be troubled with them, may think it a small sub- 
 ject to write about, but I can assure you that in this 
 part of the country, they are not to be overlooked. If 
 they were, in the spring we would discover that the 
 mice had not overlooked our Apple-trees. 

I procure sheet lead, the lining of old tea chests, 
 cut in strips of from ten to fifteen inches in length, 
 and of a width to just go around the tree, lapping it 
 an inch or two, securing it with a bit of twine. I have 
 found effectual. 

Last winter I had my trees banked up as usual, 
 but a heavy fall of snow occurring, I was fearful the 
 mice might be at work at my young trees. Three or 
 four days after, as soon as the weather cleared up I 
 gent my man to examine the trees in a young orchard 
 of fifty trees. He found seven quite badly barked. 
 We then procured some lead and had it put on, which 
 prevented further loss. 

As to the expeuses, twenty-five cents will buy lead 

enough for fifty trees, and the trouble cannot be 

more than to bank them. Jlr. Editor, it you think 

this way will be new to any of your subscribers, you 

can tell them of it. There is, undoubtedly other ways 

of securing the same object, which may be equally 

good ; but in one case I heard of the experiment of 

coating the tree with tar, which proved very injurious.

Pruning Trees. 

SELECTED AND ALTERED BY R. BTJIST, JR. 

At this leisure season of the year when the farmer 
 has time to look over his grounds and trees it may 
 be asked what is pruning ? This is a question which 
 has been little attended to. There are two opera- 
 tions on trees, very difierent in their principles and 
 results, both of which usually pass under that name. 
 The most common, which may more properly be 
 termed " lopping," is the rude practice of cutting off 
 branches large and small indiscriminately, to in- 
 crease the length of the stem, or as is supposed the 
 growth of the tree; the other, which is properly "pru- 
 ning," is the stopping or shortening gradually by 
 guccessive annual amputations, such branches as are 
 tending unduly to enlarge themselves, and, by divert- 
 ing the sap from the proper central leading stem, to 

form a spreading and unsightly head. This is an 
 operation which, if commenced at an early period of 
 its growth, and completed before the age of ten years, 
 cannot be injurious to the tree or derange its econo- 
 my, like that of suddenly depriving it of large 
 branches in a state of luxuriant growth. Some of 
 the branches of two inches in diameter and under, 
 treated in this manner, may be destined to lie even- 
 tually removed when the flow of sap to them has 
 been sufficiently deadened, and the stem of the tree 
 sufficiently enlarged to render the wound relatively 
 small. But in by far the greater number, probably 
 nineteen in twenty, the branches, when sufficienily 
 shortened by a clean diagonal or slanting cut, at a 
 properly placed leading twig, is left to cicatrise and 
 remain permanent. This operation is particularly 
 suited to boundary, avenue or street trees, where ele- 
 vated heads and clean elongated stem are important; 
 but may be occasionally useful in park trees, to stop 
 an ambitious or unruly limb. If pruning be begun, 
 however, as it ought to be, in the nursery, and the 
 main growth of the plant directed to the central stem, 
 the after pruning of trees will be rarely and sparing- 
 ly required. The best season for pruning, I conceive 
 to be between September and the end of February, 
 when the sap having been elaborated in the leaves is 
 beginning to descend and be distributed for the ma- 
 terial of next year's growth ; and when the vital econo- 
 my of the plant will not be deranged by the operation. 
 The results of pruring performed on this plan wiU 
 be found very satisfactory, and the most un)iromising 
 and unsightly heads gradually brought in a few 
 years in a symmetrical form, without any perceptible 
 checks to the luxuriant growth of the tree. When 
 the wound is one inch or more in diameter, a little 
 hot tar, gum shellac or oil paint laid on with a brush, 
 will prevent the growth of moss or fungus until 
 closed. No doubt the new wood formed over the 
 wound does not unite with it ; but this is of little 
 consequence when the wound is small, and in avenue 
 or park trees, cultivated rather for ornament than for 
 timber; and I think the operation performed on the 
 above system will not deserve the hard terms in 
 which "pruning trees" is sometimes spoken of. It is 
 proper to state that different trees require different 
 degrees of pruning. The poplar and maple may be 
 pruned pretty freely witliout injury ; next to these 
 the linden and the ash, whilst the horse chestnut, the 
 elm and sycamore, require milder treatment ; the am- 
 putation of the two or three last annual sliouts of a 
 branch will sensibly check its growth. The birch 
 bears pruning least of any, and should rarely be 
 touched. In fruit trees we deprecate the idea of be- 
 ing armed with the axe and the handsaw; all the re- 
 quisite implements is one of Buisfs best pruning 
 knives, with which the apple and the pear, the peach 
 and the cherry can be kept in perfet: Hearing order. 
 The plum and the quince should be , ,iaringly dealt 
 with, unless to shorten exuberant shi s.
