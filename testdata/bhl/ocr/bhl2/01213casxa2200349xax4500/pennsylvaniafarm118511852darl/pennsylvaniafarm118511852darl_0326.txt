TuESDAV, January 20, 1852. 

In accordance with the fourth section of the Consti- 
 tution of the Pennsylvania Staie Agricultural Socie- 
 ty, the said Society met in the Hall of the House of 
 llepreseutatives, more than fifteen members being 
 present. 

The President being absent, the meeting was or- 
 ganized by Vice President A. 0. Hiester being called 
 to the chair. 

On motion of David Mumma, Jr., it was 

Resolved, That when this meeting adjourns, it ad- 
 journ to meet in the same place this evening. 

Adjourned. 

EVENING SESSION. 

On motion of A. JI. Spangler, the Hon. A. 0. Hies- 
 ter was called to the chair. 

On taking his seat Judge Hiester remarked — the 
 meeting was called in obedience to the 4th Section of 
 the 1st Article of the Constitution, and read from the 
 Constitution the clause which requires the members 
 of the Society to meet at Harrisbui-g, on the 3d Tues- 
 day of J.anuary in each year, to elect officers of the 
 Society for the ensuing year. He said they did not 
 meet at this time to make or hear speeches, but to 
 transact business — and yet he must ask the indul- 
 gence of tiic Society for a few moments, th.at he might 
 congratulate them on the favorable auspices under 
 which they met. But one year ago they had assem. 
 bled at this place tov the purpose of organizing a 
 State Society. They have accomplished "the object 
 most harmoniously — they were fortunate in selecting 
 officers, competent, and with the requisite zeal to at- 
 tend to the duties assigned them. The first exhibition 
 had been held. It exceeded far the most extravagant 
 expectations of the most enthusiastic friends of the pro- 
 ject, in the gtnerai interest it excited — the largo attend- 
 •ace of farmers, the grand grand display of agricultu- 
 ral products, implements and stock, and they found 
 themselves now with all the expenses paid, and sev- 
 eral thousand dollars in the treasury. He closed his 
 remarks by saying that the Convention a year ago 
 had been harmonious, and the choice of officers good, 
 lie trusted they would be equally conciliatory and 
 •qually fortunate to-night. 

On motion of David Mumma, Jr., it was 

Resolced, That when this meeting adjoui-ns it ad- 
 jottrn to meet in this place to morrow afternoon, at 
 3 o'clock. 

On motion, the Treasurer's report was read and 
 adopted.

Robert C. Walker, Secretary of the Society, sub-

 To llie members of the Pennsylvania State Agricultural 

Society. 

Gentlemen — In laying before you a report for tb« 
 first year's proceedings ef the Pennsylvania Stata 
 Agricultural Society, I am pleased to say that, in- 
 stead of only having to record the proceedings of a 
 few nominal meetings of a few theorists, met for tha 
 purpose of figuring upon paper what can only be ae- 
 complished by the practical working of the bona fid* 
 farmers, I have registered the doings of a society 
 whose members compose two thousand and ninety of 
 the farmers, mechanics and artizans of Pennsylvania. 
 Only a year has elapsed since the organization of thi» 
 association, and we are now about to enter upon the 
 second of its operations. What was considered a 
 problem by many at its commencement, namely, 
 whether the proper elements existed in our Stata t«
