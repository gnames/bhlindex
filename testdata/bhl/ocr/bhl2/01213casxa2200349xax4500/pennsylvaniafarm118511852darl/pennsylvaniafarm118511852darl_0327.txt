build up and carry forward, with success, an agricul- 
 tural society, has been solved, and our institution, al- 
 though in its infancy, has taken an honorable rank 
 among the kindred associations of the world. In ac- 
 oordance with the prayers of the memorialists of a 
 convention, held in Ilarrisburg, on the 21st and -'Id 
 days of January last, the Legislature of this State 
 has, by its act, approved the 29th day of March, 
 1851, incorporated the Pennsylvania State Agricultu- 
 ral Society, the provisions of which are herewith pre- 
 sented.— t^SO, Pamphlet Laics, 1851. 

Thus has the Legislature of Pennsylvania, with a, 
 liberality characteristic of the State, appropriated di 
 reotly to the ase of said society, two thousand dollars, 
 with a like amount annually hereafter to that paid 
 in by its members, provided such sum does not ex- 
 ceed two thousand in any one year. Not only has 
 our Legislature rendered ef&cient aid in the great 
 cause of agriculture by appropriating money to our 
 State Society, but by the provisions of our act of in- 
 corporation it authorizes the treasurer of every coun- 
 ty in the Commonwealth to pay the sum of one hun- 
 dred dollars to a c unty society, to be disbursed for 
 the promotion of agricultural knowledge and im- 
 provement. From the fact that over two thousand 
 persons have already become members of this associ- 
 ation, we have reason to believe that our annual ap- 
 propriation from this time forward will not be dimin- 
 ished. 

There have been twelve meetings of the Executive 
 Committee and one of the Society, since the adoption 
 of the Constitution, each of which disposed of a pro- 
 portionate amount of business required in making 
 preparations for the Annual Exhibition. At a meet- 
 ing of the Executive Committee, held in Ilarrisburg, 
 CQ Thursday, the 27th day of February last, it was 
 EesoJi-cfl, ' That Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, 
 the 22d, 2.3d and 24th days of October, 1851, be fixed 
 as the time for holding the first Annual Exhibition 
 of the Pennsylvania State Agricultural Society. 

At a special meeting, held in Ilarrisburg, on Sep- 
 tember Idth, 1851, pursuant to a call of the President, 
 the following preamble and resolution were unani- 
 mously adopted ; 

Whereas, It has accidentally happened that the 
 Pafinsylvania State Agricultural Society, and the 
 Maryland State Agricultural Society have fixed the 
 game days for their Annual Exhiljitii>n, which may 
 operate unfavorably to both,and as our Society desires 
 to reciprocate facilities with, and promote the success 
 of all other societies that have for their olyect the 
 improvement of agriculture and the mechanic arts ; 
 Therefore 

Resoh-ed, That the time heretofore fixed for the Ex- 
 hibition of the Pennsylvania State Agricultural Soci- 
 ety, be and the same is hereby changed and fixed to 
 be upon the 20th, 30th and .jlst days of Octolier, '51. 
 It was Uesoh-ed, That A. 0. Iliester, Geo. 11. Buch- 
 er. Dr. Luther Riley, David Mumma, jr., and Isaac 
 Cr. M'Kinley. Ije a committee of arrangement, whose 
 duty it shall be definitely to act upon all subjects per- 
 taining to the first i\jinual Exhibition ; and that they 
 •hall have power to employ such aid and assistance 
 as necessity shall require. 

A committee consisting of Frederick Watts, John 
 C, M'Allister, A. O. Hiester and Isaac Updegrove, 
 were appointed to visit the annual exhibition of the 
 New York State Agricultural Society. 

A committee consisting of Isaac G. JIcKinley, D.a- 

Tid Mumma, Jr., Joseph Lescuro and Geo. II. Buch- 

er, was also appointed to attend the annual exhibition 

of the Maryland Sta*e Agricultural Society. 

A committee was also appointed to invite the offi- 

cers of other Agricultural Societies, and distinguished 
 gentlemen of this and other States, to bo present and 
 participate in the ceremonies of ourannu-'l exhibition. 
 The committee appointed to select and invite a 
 suitable person to deliver the annual address at the 
 Agricultural Exhibition, selected the Hon. Andrsw 
 Stevenson, of Virginia, who in accordance with tha 
 invitation extended, was promptly on thi; ground arul 
 contributed gvcatly, by his excellent address, to the 
 edification of afi-^ho had the pleasure of hearing 
 him, and did lasting service to the cause he so ably 
 advocated. 

The address was published by the Society in pamph- 
 let form, and one copy sent to each of its members. 

It was resolved by the Executive Committee tha.» 
 we deem the establishment and success of an Agri- 
 cultural Journal, published in Pennsylvania, as es- 
 sentia! to the proper exposition of tho principles of 
 agriculture as practised in this State: and that we 
 approve of the Pennsylvania Farm Journal, publishr 
 ed at the city of Lancaster, by A. JI. Spangler, and 
 edited by S. S. Haldeman. 

That for the present it be adopted at the organ of 
 the State Society, and that farmers and all others in- 
 terested in the subject of agriculture, be advised to 
 patronize it and contributeinformation to its columns. 
 It was also resolved that the proceedings of this 
 meeting be published in the American Farmer an 
 Agricultural Journal, pulilished in the German lan- 
 guage, in Harrisburg, by J. M. Beck, and that this 
 periodical be recommended to the patronage of th« 
 German farmers of Pennsylvania. _ . 

A resolution was passed asking the different Coun- 
 ty Agricultural Societies of this State to inform thii 
 Society of their existence. This resolution was pub- 
 lished in the newspapers, but as yet no such society 
 has furnished the desired information. 

Suitable books have been procured in which havo 
 been transcribed the Constitution, and act of incor- 
 poration of this society; also books in which has 
 been made an alphabetical arrangement of the name* 
 of its members with their residence and post office. 

Certificates of annual membership have been pro- 
 cured and issued to nearly every member of tlie so- 
 ciety ; also certificates of life memljcrship, ncme of 
 which, however, have been issued, probably in conse- 
 quence of the fee for life membership being fixed at 
 too high a price. 

A box of minerals and soil has been presented to 
 the society for analyzation, by II. P. Robinson, of 
 Berks county. 

In consequence of the Maryland State Agricultu- 
 ral Society having decided to hold its exhiljition on 
 the 22d, 23d and 24th days of October last, our firs* 
 annual exhibition was not hold until the three last 
 days of October, 1851. Although held too late in 
 the season for the presentation of many fruits and 
 vegetables, and at a time when good weather could 
 hardly be expected, the display of articles, animal* 
 and stock of all kinds was far greater than the most 
 sanguine anticipators had reason to expect. 

During the three days of the exhibition it is thought 
 that more than twenty thousand persons were in at- 
 tendance. The ground chosen by the committee of 
 arrangement, upon which to hold the fair, was pecu- 
 liar in its adaptation to the purpose, and was located 
 about a mile above Ilarrisburg, on the eastern sids 
 of the Susquehanna, embracing nearly fifteen acrea 
 which was substantially enclosed by a fence ten feet 
 high. 

On the side of the entrance was the office of tha 
 treasurer, and on the other that of the secretary. — 
 In the latter, all articles for exhibition were entered
