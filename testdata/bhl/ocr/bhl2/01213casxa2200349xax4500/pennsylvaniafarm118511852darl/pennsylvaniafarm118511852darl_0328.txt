Wiii;i!KAS, The President of the United States hag, 
 in his last and previous annual messages, recommend- 
 ed to Congress the establishment of an Agricultural 
 Bureau : And whereas. This society agreeing fully 
 with the views expressed by the President, upon this 
 important subject, inurging its-importance upon Con- 

gress, in which he briefly, yet so ably urges the im- 
 portance of the subject: therefore, in expressing the 
 views of the society, we adopt his own language : â€” 
 " Agriculture may justly be regarded as the groat 
 interest of our people. Four-fifths of our active pop- 
 ulation are employed in the cultivation of the soil, 
 and the rapid expansion of our settlements over new 
 territory is daily adding to the number of those en- 
 gaged in that vocation. Justice and sound policy, 
 therefore, alike require that the Government should 
 use all the means authorized by the Constitution, to 
 promote the interests and welfare of that important 
 class of our fellow citizens. And yet it is a singular 
 fact that whilst the manufactur ng and commercial 
 interests have engaged the attention of Congress du- 
 ring a large portion of every session, and our statutes 
 abound in provisions for their protection and encour- 
 agement, little has yet been done directly for the ad- 
 vancement of agriculture. It is true, that this re- 
 proach to our legislation should be removed, and I 
 sincerely hope that the present Congress will not 
 close their labors without adopting sufBcient means 
 to supply the omission of those who preceded them. 

" An Agricultural Bureau, charged with the duty 
 of collecting and disseminating correct information 
 as to the best mode of cultivation, and of the most 
 eflicient means of prescrnng and restoring the fertil- 
 ity of the soil, and of procuring and distributing 
 seeds and plants, and other vegetable productions, 
 with instructions in regard to the soil, climate and 
 treatment best adapted to their growth, could not fail 
 to be, in the language of Washington, in his annual 
 message to Congress, "a very cheap instrument of im- 
 mense national benefit," therefore 

Resolved, That our Senators and Representatives 
 in Congress are hereby requested to use their utmost 
 endeavors to carry out the recommendations of the 
 President upon this subject. That the Secretary is 
 hereby instructed to furnish each of our Senators and 
 Representatives in Congress with a copy of the above 
 preamble and resolutions. 

A preamble and resolutions submitted by D. 3Ium- 
 ma, .Jr., relative to a National Convention of agricul- 
 turists from the several States of the Union, was, on

Resolved. That all the officers to be elected should
