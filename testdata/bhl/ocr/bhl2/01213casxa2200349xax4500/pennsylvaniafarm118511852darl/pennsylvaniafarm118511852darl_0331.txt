it off. This moulting process may occupy two oi- 
 three days; during -which time the larva is languid, 
 and takes little or no food. Shortly alter it has forced 
 itself from its old skin, its ravenous appetite returns 
 with renevred vigor. At intervals of six or eight 
 days, a second and a third moulting takes place. — 
 These moultings are always succeeded b_v an increase 
 of voracity; which in some instances is so great, that 
 a caterpilL'.r will consume, in twenty-four hours, one 
 hundred and tifty times its own weight of food. 

The larva, at length, attains its full size ; it then 
 ceases to eat and prepares for its last moulting. It 
 gelects an appropriate place, where it spins its web, 
 makes its cocoon, reposes for a few days, ami finally 
 oasts off its larval skin for the last time ; after which 
 its form is so essentially different from what it had 
 previously been, that it would not be recognised as 
 the same insect, by one not conversant with these 
 transformations. 

It is now in its second state of existence, and is no 
 longer termed a larva, but is denominated a pupa, 
 aurelia, or chrysalis. Some caterpillars pass into the 
 pupa state in their larval skin without moulting ; and 
 some without weaving a cocoon. In its pupal period 
 of existence, when the metamorphosis is complete, 
 the insect is quiescent, and takes no food. In tliis 
 form, resembling in some measure a mummy swath- 
 ed in its cerements, it remains for weeks or months, 
 when it bursts its pupa case or shell, and assumes its 
 final configuration. 

It is now termed an Imago or Perfect Insect, and is 
 furnished with wings, '■■ and various other organs and 
 appendages, including the sexual, which were before 
 either absent or in a state of imperfect development, 
 and divested of many that it previously possessed. — 
 And although still the same insect, its form and gen- 
 eral aspect are so materially altered, that it no long- 
 er retains a vestige of its former identity. f 

Several orders of insects (Orthoptera, Ilemiptera, 
 and some of the Neuroptera) never pass through the 
 transformations now described and which apply chief- 
 ly to the butterflies and moths, (Lepidoptera.) Nev- 
 ertheless, they also undergo certain changes which 
 are termed an incomplete metamorphosis. Notwith- 
 standing they cast their skin several times, their con- 
 formation continues to bear more or less similitude 
 to that of the perfect insect. This is the case with 
 grasshoppers, cockroaches, the cicada;, ttc. The ru- 
 diments of the wings are perceptible soon after the 
 first moulting. On the completion of the second, the 
 insect is called a Nymph, which corresponds with the 
 Pupa of other orders. The third moulting terminates 
 the final change, and the Nymph becomes an Imago. 
 Those insects that undergo this incomplete metamor- 
 phosis, are, in all their stages, capable of locomotion. 

A knowledge of the various transformations, we 
 have now been considering, will enable you to en- 
 gage in many curious and interesting entomological 
 investigations, by which you will obtain much prac- 
 tical information. For instance, you occasionally 
 find, on your fruit trees, plants or vegetaliles, clus- 
 ters of small eggs, and you are probably anxious to 
 know by what insects they were deposited. This can 
 readily be ascertained by placing the eggs, with the 

4- Tbe females of several species of insects are destitute of 
 wings, and are on that account are apterous. 

[In the order CoUopUra there are a few instances where both 
 male^nd female are without wings; as in some of the Carabidee, 
 BtapsideB and other terrestrial darkling beetles, which have no use 
 for wings, in these the sutures that usually divides the elytra or 
 ^iog-covers of the winged species, is firmly united, forming a solid 
 •hield.— Sub-Ed.] 

fSome insects are two or three years in undergoing their meta- 
 morphoses; and the seventeen years locust (cicada septendicim) 
 requires seventeen years to complete its larval ar.d pupal stages 
 of life. 

wood or leaf to which they are attached, in a phial, 
 and closing the mouth with g.^uze or some suitabto 
 contrivance that will admit a sufficient supply of at- 
 mospheric air. Generally, in the course of a few 
 days or weeks, the eggs hatch, and the insect makes 
 its appearance in its young larva state. It is perhaps 
 even now unknown to j'ou ; in which case you must 
 endeavor to find out its appropriate aliment, Ijy fu»- 
 nishing it with food of different kinds. ShouUrthese 
 attempts to discover its proper nourishment prove ud- 
 suocessful, they will, at least, reveal to you the sub- 
 stances on which it does not feed, — nn item of no lit- 
 tle importance. But if the kind of food it requires bo 
 ascertained, you can then furnish an adequate daily 
 supply for its requirements till its full grown is at- 
 tained ; after which it completes its metamorphoses, 
 and you will have the gratification of seeing the pcF- 
 fect insf et. Again, you often notice on vegetable pro- 
 ductions a great variety of larvie differing essentially 
 in their form, color, and general aspect. Now by con- 
 fining and feeding these larv;\j in the manner just 
 mentioned, you will be able to watch their several 
 transformations. Some, you will find, will be meta- 
 morphosed into beetles, some into moths or butter- 
 flies, and .some into insocis belonging to the various 
 other orders. Many insects, after completing their 
 larval existence, always burrow in the ground to firt- 
 ish their transformations. In such cases, it is neces- 
 sary to place an inch or two of earth in the bottom 
 of the glass vessel; and if this precaution be not 
 taken, the larva usually perishes without undergoing 
 its final metamorphosis. The worms you meet with 
 in plums is of this description. If, when fully grown, 
 you confine it in the way and under the conditions 
 just pointed out, in a few weeks you will have an op- 
 portunity of seeing a small beetle which you have 
 often heard of, though probably you have never seen 
 before — the far-famed and destructive Oorculio or 
 Plum-weevil (Khynchoenus nenuphar). But theworm, 
 so commonly met with in the apple and pear, is capsk- 
 ble of completing its metamorphoses witiiout burrow- 
 ing in the ground. It is unnecessary, therefore, to 
 place earth in the bottom of the ]ihial in which it io 
 confined. The mouth of the vessel, however, in this 
 case, should be secured with a glass stopper; for if 
 cork be used for this purpose, the worm will readily 
 liberate itself from its captivity, by cutting its way 
 through it. When it finds escape impracticable. It 
 proceeds to spin a web or cocoon, passess into its 
 pupa state, and eventually is metamorphosed into the 
 codling moth (Carpooapsa pomonella) so often seen 
 sporting and hovering around the light in our man- 
 sions on summer evenings. 

All of you, I trust, vrill embrace every opportunity 
 of putting into practice the plan now designated, 
 whenever grubs, caterpillars, and other larva% may 
 come in your way. You will find it, not only an 
 amusing and gratilying recreation, but a most fasci- 
 nating mode of acquiring much interesting and use- 
 ful knowledge, in regard to the economy and habits 
 of many of our destructive insects in their different 
 forms of existence. Care must be taken, however, 
 not to confound the perfect insect of a larva, with 
 some of its parasites. For certain Dipterous or Hy- 
 menopterous insects, as you will presen ly lie inform- 
 ed, are hatched and live within the egg, larva, and 
 pupa, of other insects, till their final transformation- 
 is accomplished; when they escape in the form of a 
 two-winged fly, or an ichneumon. 

To the dry details of the anatomical structuro of 
 Insects, it is not intended that your attention should 
 be directed in this place, or at this time. It is ne- 
 cessary, however, that you should not be altogether
