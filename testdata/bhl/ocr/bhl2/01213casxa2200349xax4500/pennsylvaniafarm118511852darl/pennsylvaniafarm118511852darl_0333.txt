 Management of Fowls. 

Mr. Editor. — Since everything connected with the 
 farming interest, rightfully claims a place in the 
 Journal, permit me to offer a few suggestions in rela- 
 tion to the management of poultry, beliering it to be 
 a branch of domestic agriculture entitled to greater 
 attention than it generally receives. 

Many farmers keep a large number of fowls run- 
 ning at large, paying little or no attention to them, 
 presuming that food suiEcient for them will be found 
 about the barn, or in the fields adjoining it. The 
 result, as a matter of course, is, that they are unpro- 
 fitable stock. Others again keep comparatively few, 
 which are kept in a yard, well fed, and cared for, 
 and during the season when they could damage crops 
 not permitted to range at large. Facts prove that 
 the smaller, but better fed stock is the most pro- 
 fitable. 

Now the whole secret of making fowls profitable 

lies in a nut shell. Where a large number is kept, 
 the amount of animal food they find in the barn yard, 
 ifcc, is wholly insufiiciont to make them good layers. 
 This is especially the case during the winter months, 
 and hence the necessity of supplying the deficiency. 
 This can bo done by giving them a small quantity of 
 meat. The ofial from the table should always, in- 
 stead of being thrown into the slop barrel and given 
 to the pigs, be thrown to the chickens. They will 
 devour it readily. When the quantity of scraps is not 
 large, a little fresh meat should be thrown to them 
 occasionally. 

During the moulting season they should be parti- 
 cularly well fed, and comfortable shelter provided for 
 them. The food should also be varied somewhat, as 
 chickens love a change occasionally. If fowls are 
 neglected through the moulting season, (during which 
 time they always cease laying) they rarely commence 
 laying again before the spring months, when eggs are 
 cheap. The object of the former should be to keep 
 keep his fowls laying through the winter months'when 
 eggs command a good price. 

By pursuing this plan, chickens will generally lay 
 during the whole of the winter months, and prove 
 profitable ; and a small number well fed will be 
 more valuable, than a larger number badly kept.

MR. J. WISTAR'S GRAY GAME FOWLS. 

THE GAME FOWL. 
 Of all the varieties of Domestic Fowls, except, per- 
 haps, the Smooth-legged Bantam, the Game Fowl is 
 the most symmetrical. It is more slender in the body, 
 the neck, the bill, and the legs, than other kinds, and 
 the various hues of the plumage are more brilliant 
 and showy. Their flesh is white, compact, — like that 

of the race-horse as compared with the scrub, — deli- 
 cate and very nutricious ; but the extreme difiiculty 
 of rearing the Chickens, owing to their natural pug- 
 nacity, which shows itself at a very early period, de- 
 ters most breeders, excepting those who breed for the 
 cock-pit. "Whole breeds, scarcely feathered, are 
 sometimes stone-blind from fighting, to the very smal-
