Having premised thus much, permit me to state 
 my mode of managing manures. I do not offer my 
 plan, because it possesses any novelty, hut because 
 there may be some who will peruse it to their advan- 
 tage. 

For the last two years, I have always kept on hand 
 a quantity of ground plaster, and whenever my sta- 
 bles are cleaned and the manure drawn to the heap, 
 I sprinkle over the fresh manure a portion of the 
 plaster. My object in doing this is to retain as much 
 possible of the fertilizing properties of the manure. 
 We all know that oije great end to be secured, is the 
 application of manure to the soil in as well rotted 
 state as may be, without too much waste of ammonia. 
 Chemists, I believe, agree, that the value of plaster 
 for agricultural purposes, consists, not in any pecu- 
 liar fertilizing properties it possesses but in its power 
 to fix the gases essential to the life of plants, and my 
 own experience satisfies me that it can be applied for 
 this purpose in no way more beneficially than as 
 above stated. 

I am led to think that stable manure will rot much 
 sooner when plaster is mixed with it, and that as it 
 fixes the ammonia, a load of it is far more valuable 
 than where it is left exposed to the action of the sun 
 and rain. J. F. ILerr.

 The dignity of labor. 

I honsr the man of achievement ! It matters not 
 whether his employment be that of the hands or of 
 the head, he of all others has my respect and venera- 

Ile who regards Labor as ennobUng and elevating, 
 is the man who will earn respect and gains it, when 
 the pride of the weaker and more indolent has been 
 like a strong chain binding the faculties and powers, 
 and dragging liim downward into obscurity, or want. 
 Who tills our fields — rears our cities — builds our 
 navies ? Who has invented and skilfully manufac- 
 tured our world of polished machinery, and who 
 drives it with a power that none can comprehend in 
 labor for the good of mankind ? From what source 
 starts into life and being, the magic works of Art, 
 that ornament our public buildings, and private re- 
 sidences ? It is patient, persevering Toil and Labor, 
 that has achieved whatever is great, and good, and 
 noble ! Then who would not be a, laborer, and hold 
 in silent scorn the being who in his " low iliougld " 
 -may consider it servile or degrading to wield a manly 
 strenn-th in the useful and honorable achievements 
 and occupations of life. 

It has been sAid, and that most truthfully, that 
 " Aoricultural labor has the sympathies of the uni- 
 versal conscience of mankind. It is indeed co-oper- 
 atinf with Nature in the most interesting, because 
 most useful parts of her work; and who like the 
 farmer sowing the seed, reaping the harvests, culti- 

vating and gathering the fruits, rearing tlie animals 
 and investigating subjects connected with such em- 
 ployments, has higher claim to respect, if with it he 
 connects that degree of intelligence which his suc- 
 cess and advancement as an intelligent being de- 
 mand. 

A brighter day is dawning on the Agricultural in- 
 terests of our country. Chemistry is throwing now 
 and brilliant rays into the secret operations of nature 
 and is there unfolding the wants of the plant and the 
 soil so plainly, that he who reads may understand, 
 and the enriched eartli in consequence is pouring out 
 her increased treasures into the granaries of the 
 husbandman. 

Practical science has become a need of the farmer 
 and a part of his business. The improvements and 
 developments constantly coming to light, and given 
 to the public, must and will have their effect. 

Peace, Plenty and Contentment are in his abode, 
 even when discordant elements may l^e all around 
 him. The domestic ties strengthen and the best af- 
 fections are cultivated away from the noise and tur- 
 moil of life. 

There is time and place also for calm thought, and 
 intellectual improvement which gives dignity to the 
 character and will inevitably command tlie highest 
 respect of mankind. L. G. A.

Mr. Editor : — I take the liberty of inquiring, 
 through the medium of your valuable Journal, the 
 best mode of cultivating the Flax Plant, also the pro- 
 cess of rotting and preparing it for use. Can you 
 inform me on this subject? I can find but fewbooks 
 written on this subject, it being a comparatively new 
 one in this country ; having, I believe, never been 
 carried on to any great extent. If you, or any of 
 your subscribers, can give me some information on 
 this subject, you will much oblige your friend, 

W. H., a Philadelphia Subscriber.

Mr. Editor : — Can you, or any of your subscri- 
 bers, inform me how I can obtain the Bush Cranber- 
 ry, and also the Barberry ? If any one having them, 
 or either of them, would be so kind as to send me a 
 few seeds of each kind, properly labelled, or give me 
 any information by which I might obtain them, I 
 would be greatly obliged to them for their trouble. 
 Respectfully yours,
