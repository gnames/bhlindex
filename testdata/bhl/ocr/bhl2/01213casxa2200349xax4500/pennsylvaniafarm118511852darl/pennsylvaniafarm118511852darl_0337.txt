Mr. Editor: — I senilyou below a short chapter of 
 my experience in farming. 

Some years ag;o, wishing to hasten the improve- 
 ment of my laud by extraneous manuring, and not 
 understanding chemistry, I had to work for answers 
 by experiments. The first one was in plowing down 
 about three acres of oats after it was in head, and 
 about the time it began to change color. The ground 
 was sown with wheat along with the rest of the field, 
 all of it having been manured alike from the yard. — ■ 
 There was no perceptible diiference in favor of one 
 part over the other. I considered the oats a total 
 loss. 

The next experiment was in plowing down buck- 
 wheat. On six acres of medium quality soil, I ap- 
 plied 240 bushels of lime, and sixty-six three-horse 
 cart loads of stable manure. The ground was pre- 
 pared and the buckwheat sown sometime in June. — 
 It grew finely, and when in full bio im, and much of 
 it from four to five feet high, I drew the harrow over 
 it in the direction that I wished to plow; we followed 
 with Wiley's iron plow. No. 76, which, by the by, is 
 admirably calculated for that kind of work. "While 
 plowing it down, an aged neighbor, whose knowledge 
 was drawn from observation and experience, assured 
 me that it would not answer ; that there was no good 
 in it applied in that way. However, I wished to try 
 and see for myself. I therefore finished the job and 
 sowed it at the usual time with wheat. The appear- 
 ance of the crop was never promising, and resulted 
 in a decided failure. The wheat was evidently spoil- 
 ed by the buckwheat. 

My next experiment was with saw dust. A neigh- 
 bor had a large heap of saw dust, which had been 
 accumulating for several years, made chiefly from 
 poplar and partly in a state of decay. This I pur- 
 chased for ?5, and hauled it up in th« winter on part 
 of a sod field that I intended-for corn. The dust was 
 spread in the spring, and the whole field limed at the 
 name time with from fifty to sixty bushels of lime 
 per aoi-e. I guessed that the lime might neutralize 
 the acidity contained, and easily detected in the saw 
 dust. It was all plowed dovm together, and the 
 ground planted with corn. Shortly after it came up, 
 that part growing over the saw dust assumed a yel- 
 low color, compared with the rest, and never grew so 
 well. The result of this experiment was a loss of at 
 least one-third of the crop on the dusted portion, 
 which contained about seven acres. 

The next experiment was in hauling out barn yard 
 manure in the spring of the year— a thing that is 
 rarely done hereabouts, unless it be a few loads for 
 potatoes. I had seen it recommended some .vhere on 
 the authority of a distinguished farmer of New York, 
 that manure so applied was worth as much to the suc- 
 ceeding or second crop, as if it had been left lay in 

the barn yard during tlie summer. Seventy-five cart 
 loads were applied to about five acres of sod ground, 
 which was planted with corn. The corn crop was 
 about doubled, I presume, in virtue of the manure. 
 At the proper time the crop of corn was removed and 
 shocked on a strip of sod ground, along one side of 
 the field, — the stubs hoed ofi' — the ground plowed and 
 partly manured again, and the whole sowed with 
 Jlediterranean wheat. The result was a very heavy 
 crop where the land had reeoivcd a second applica- 
 tion of manure, and a very light one where it had not. 
 I cannot say whether there was a loss or gain in this 
 trial. But there arc difiiculties in the way of apply- 
 ing stable manure on a large scale to spring crops 
 with a view of securing the same ground in the fall, 
 that cannot well be overcome, and will, I presume, 
 always prevent it from being received into common 
 favor. Hauling out and spreading would occur at a 
 very busy period. The ground is generally too soft 
 to haul over, and the manure much heavier than it is 
 in autumn. Besides that, it makes a very heavy job 
 in the fall, and must necessarily be done in a hurry, 
 as the wheat should be sown about the tunc that the 
 corn is fit to remove from the ground. Any consid- 
 erable delay at that time from wet weather or any 
 other cause, would generally be fatal to the wheat 
 crop following. 

I have generally town clover with oats and plowed 
 it down the following year for wheat, applying the 
 stable manure to the same crop either before or after 
 plowing down the clover. This appears to be an ad- 
 vantage to the wheat, but there are sometimes difii- 
 culties in getting it plowed at the proper time on ac- 
 count of 'dry weather. I am not sure that the gain 
 in the wheat will compensate for the additional trou- 
 ble and partial loss of the land, for it is not best gen- 
 erally to pasture it the same season after the oats has 
 been removed. So far as my experience goes, there 
 seems to be but little use in plowing down anything 
 as food for crops, except stable manure, and that I 
 apprehend had better be left on top. If there really 
 is anything lost by evaporation from exposure, I 
 have been unable, in a practice of more than twenty 
 years, to discover it. On the contrary, manure so 
 applied, has invariably done the best for me. If 
 we can secure the solid and liquid parts of the ma- 
 nure, we can, I think, afibrd to let the gasses go for 
 the benefit of the world at large. A. W. "W.
