 thousand recipes, consistiny of directions for select- 
 ing, preparing and cooking all kinds of meat, fish,

 Philadelphia, Lippincott, Grambo & Co. 

This useful volume is presented to the public as 
 the result of many years practical experience, in the 
 various departments of -which it treats. While the 
 country is flooded with books relating to culinary 
 matters, but few of the many yet published are suffi- 
 ciently practical in their character for general use. 
 Mrs. Bliss' work is an exception to this rule, and 
 from an examination of its contents we cannot but 
 think that it will prove a most valuable acquisition to 
 evei'y family library.

We have for some time past,_been in receipt of this 
 excellent journal. For spirit and freshness it is un- 
 doubtedly the leading periodical of the day. Its 
 readers are furnished weekly with the spice of the 
 foreign Reviews, &c., embodying a valnable exposi- 
 tion of the current literature of the English language. 
 The selections are, generally speaking, of a solid and 
 substantial character, and as such eminently adapted 
 to the tastes and wants of the American reader. The 
 plan of the work is such as to commend it to all, and 
 we are pleased to loarn that the enterprising publish- 
 ers are meeting with the encouragement they so rich- 
 ly deserve.

This fine work continues to improve in character 
 as it progresses. We again commend it to those who 
 desire an excellent work on rural architeoture. 

B. P. Johnson, Esq., of Albany, will please accept 
 our thanks for five bound volumes of the Transactions 
 of the New York Agricultural Society, from 1846 to 
 1850 inclusive. These volumes are noble evidences 
 of the interest manifested by the people of New York 
 on the great subject of Agriculture. 

Benevolence is daily more and more generally 
 acknowledged as the true rule of conduct. The max- 
 im, "Live and let live," will soon be superseded by a 
 still nobler principle of action, "Live and help live."
