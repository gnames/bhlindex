NO. 23, SOUTH EIGHTH STREET, PHILADELPHIA, 
 AGENT for Birkinbines Patent improved Hytlraulie Ram, 
 Force Pumps, Street Stops, Fire Plugs, and Hydraulic Machmery 
 in general. 

Tlie superiority of these Rams over all others is the great 
 amount oi water thrown to that wasted, the large size they can be 
 constructed, the durability of them, as well as the small amount 
 of attention and repairs they require— many running at present for 
 4 and 5 years, without any repair. At the present time there are 
 in the United States, Cuba, Mexico and South America, about 
 2000 in successful operation. 

The town of Naples in the State of New York is supplied with 
 water by one of these Rams, throwing 20,000 gallons a day. Many 
 more could be mentioned if space would permit. 

Persons wishing Rams sent to them by measuring the amount of 
 water their brook or spring aftbrds, per minute, the head and fall 
 they can procure, the elevation to be overcome, and distance to be 
 conveyed, can have the proper Ram and Pipe sent them, with di- 
 rections for putting up. 

The expense, in most cases, is smaller than a well and pump. — 
 Letters post-paid, will meet with prompt attention. When desired 
 an experienced person will be sent to put them at a small addition- 
 al expense. Lead and iron Pipe for sale. These Rams are war- 
 ranted in every respect. (Jan. 1852.

IMPORTANT TO FARMERS! 

JESSE ROBERT'S PATENT UNITED STATES 

GRAIN AND SEED FAN. 

TO wnicn iv'AS attarded the 

FIRST PREMIUIM 

At the Pennsj-lvania Agricultural Fair, after a trial the fairness of 
 which coukl not be disputed. These Kaiis, the inventor confident- 
 ly asserts, are the only ones now in use entirely adequate to the 
 wants of the farmer. The object of the inventor was not directed 
 aione, to the purpose of cleaning grain, but of cleaning it and 
 saving at the same time the farmer the trouble of gathering it 
 from the floor, thus not only avoiding labor, but keepnig the grain 
 from the dirt on the floor. In addition to this, these Fans, possess 
 greater advantages than those constructed upon the old plan. — 
 These advantages are as follows : 

First. The arrangement is such, that a quick shake can be ob- 
 tained bv turning slowly, thus securing when desiredj a less quan- 
 tity of for small seeds. 

Second. When necessary a slow shake can be secured, by rapid 
 turning. This is of immense advantage, as it adapts the fan, to 
 the cleaning of all kinds of seeds. 

Third. A new method of adjusting the riddles and screws. This 
 gives the operator the advantage of placing them in any position 
 bes". adapted to accomplish the purposes of ii grain Fan. Every 
 riddle and screen has a separate adjustment, bo that each one can 
 be fixed at any angle \vithout ilie necessity of taknig them out 

Fourth, The grain, instead o( falling on the floor, as is usually 
 the case, is discharged, by means of a small trough, into the half 
 bushel, or other measure that may be placed under it. By this ar- 
 rangement the grain is all mensurcd, by the time it is cleaned, 
 thus saving not only labor, but time, and consequently expense, as 
 well as keepins^ the grain from contact with the dust and dirt on 
 floor. For this reasr)n; the fan, can be put in operation anywhere, 
 with as little trouble as the common fans can be used in a barn 
 floor. 

Fifth, Tlie simplicity of their constructions renders them less 
 liable to get out of repair than other mills. 

For the above reasons, we confidenily recommend our Fans to 
 public patronage. Privileges to manulacture will be granted on 
 reasonable terms. Satisfactory information can be promptly had 
 by addressing postpaid, the subscriber at Norristown, Montgome-

No. 29. Market Street, Pkila. 
 HERE the subscriber has onened an extensive assortment of 
 GRASS AND GARDEN SEEDS, of his owii raisiiig, oT recciit impo»- 
 tation, and warranted to be as represented. 

He is, also, manufacturing all the most approved Agricultural 
 Implements, among w^hicli he would call the attention of Farmers 
 to a new article of Plow, of his own invention, called Cast-Steel, 
 Extending Puint, Self-Sharpening, Surface and Subsoil Plows, 
 which for durability and easy of draft is yet unequalled. 

The great advantages these Plows possess over all others, are 
 their peculiar construction and the substitution of Cast-Steel in the 
 place of Cast-Iron, which only wants to be seen to beappreciated; 
 aJI of which will be sold on the most reasonable prices by 
 May, 1801. C. B. RO&EHfc.
