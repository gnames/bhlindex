ANALYTICAL LABORATORY, 

Yale College, Neiv Haven, Connecticut. 
 JOHN P. NORTON, Pkofessor op Scientific Agricitlturk. 

This Laboratory is now fully organised for instruction in all 
 branches of analyses connected with the examiimtiun of soils 
 manures, minerals, ashes, animal and vegetable substances &c.— 
 Full courses are given in each of these departments, and also in 
 general Chemistry, both organic and inorganic. 

Students can thus fit themselves to become instructors in th« 
 various branches of Chemistry, or to apply so much of that and 
 kindred sciences as may be necessary to the practical pursuit of 
 agriculture or manufacturing. The demand for teachers and pro- 
 fessors in the various branches of chemistry, especially agricultu- 
 ral, is now great and increasing, so that this is a fair field for those 
 who have a taste for such pursuits. 

A course of Lectures ouScientific Agriculture, by Professor Nor- 
 ton, commencesin January of each year, aad continues for two and 
 a half months. This course isdesigned especially for the practical 
 farmer, and has given great satisfaction to those who have attend- 
 ed it in previous years. It embraces a plain connected outline of 
 the leading points in improved agriculture, treating in succession 
 of the composition of the soil, the plant and tiie animal; of their 
 connections with each other, and of all the improvements in culti- 
 vation, manuring, feeding, and fattening, which have been adopted 
 in the best agricultural regions This course is made so plain and 
 practical, thatthe farmer who attends itcan understand the whole 
 and apply it in his own experience. ' 

More ean be learned by attendance upon such lectures, by read- 
 ing in connection with them, and by associating with others who 
 are also desirous of obtaining a better knowledge of their prufea- 
 sion than in years away from such advantages. The young fanner 
 learns to think for himself, to see that a practice is not necessarily 
 right because it is old, to understand the reasons for all that he 
 does, and with this increase of knowledge is better able to malte 
 farming profitable as well as interesting. 

Board and lodging may be procured at from S2 to S3 per week, 
 and the Ticket for the Lectures is glU. 

In connection with the Lectures is a short Laboratory course, by 
 means of which those who desire it, are taught to test soils, mai»- 
 ures, marls, &.C . in a simple way, and to make many elementarj' 
 examinations of a highly useful character. The charge for thie 
 course is S'25. 

To those students who go through the full Laboratory course, 
 the charge isaboat S'200 per annum, and they can be admitted at 
 any period of tlie year at a proportional charge.
