 Application of Poudrette to Corn Fields — Surface 
 Manuring. 

Mr. Editor: — Believing that your Journal is des- 
 tined to be the means through which the farmers of 
 Pennsjlvania will eventually communicate all such 
 fads and experiments as may be useful to each other, 
 and feeling much indebted to those who have been 
 leretofore contributors to other agricultural publica- 
 cions, I, as a citizen of our good old commonwealth, 
 intend to make her Farmer's Periodical, the medium 
 of communicating my experience to the public. And 
 if you can succeed in inducing farmers to give, in 
 their own plain and intelligent manner, their success 
 (and failures also) in the cultivation of crops, with 
 minute descriptions of quantities, expense, &c., its 
 usefulness would be greatly enhanced. 

To add -example to precept, I propose occasionally 
 to report to you my operations at " Cream Hill," and 
 shall at present confine myself to the subject of 
 " Surface Manuring," or rather to give a detailed 
 statement of my success in the application of pou- 
 drette to a crop of corn. 

Some sis years since, in making an exchange of 
 land with a neighbor (to straighten our lines) I came 
 into possession of about four acres of cold, moist, poor 
 clay land. It was covered with oxeye daisy and car- 
 rot roots, with, in the lower parts, an occasional 
 patch of alder bushes. After I had planted my or- 
 dinary crop of corn in the beginning of May, I made 
 several French drains through this piece of land, 
 thereby effectually drawing off all the water which 
 had heretofore risen to the surface. The drains are 
 from two and a half to three feet deep with about fif- 
 teen inches of small field stone in the bottom, covered 
 first with shavings from the carpenter shop, which I 
 deem best for the purpose, and filled up with earth. 
 Afler preparing the land well, I procured from the 
 VOL I — L. 

manufactory, thirty bushels of poudrette, at thirty 
 cents per bushel, and commenced planting by putting 
 first, about a gill, perhaps a little more, of the ma- 
 nure in a hill, and dropping the corn thereon, cover- 
 ing from two to three inches deep. After planting 
 four rows in this manner, I put in four others with- 
 out manure, then again four with, and four without. 
 The remainder of the lot was planted, with poudrette 
 used as above described, except the last twelve rows, 
 which, from want of time, it being late in the even- 
 ing, and having the appearance of rain, I was com- 
 pelled to plant without manure. I should have said 
 this was on the first day of June. On the next day, 
 I put on the surface of the hills in the last named 
 twelve rows, the same quantity of manure as on the 
 other parts of the lot. 

The season was a fair one for the corn crop. The 
 following was the result. On the four first rows ma- 
 nured (outside) I had twenty baskets full, of well 
 matured corn. On the first four without manure, 
 fourteen baskets of very inferior corn, much of it un- 
 ripe; on the third four rows manured, nineteen bask- 
 ets; on the next four without manure, fourteen bask- 
 ets of like quality as before ; and on the next four 
 rows manured, nineteen baskets of good corn. I neg- 
 lected to measure any more of it, although I have 
 since regretted that I did not measure the four rows 
 where the manure was placed on the surface at the 
 same time, as I believe, from its size and appear?nce 
 that it was little, if any better, than that where there 
 was no manure. 

Afler I had plowed the land and before planting, 
 I put on fifty bushels of lime per acre, which had 
 been burned the year before, and contained about 
 thirty per cent, of magnesia. 

The next season the lot was sown with oats, and 
 during its growth I could distinguish at the distance 
 of a quarter of a mile, where every corn hill in it had 
 been manured. The efiect, however, was not as ma- 
 nifest where it was manured on the surface, as where 
 the poudrette was buried with the com. 

I have since that time used poudrette, guano and
