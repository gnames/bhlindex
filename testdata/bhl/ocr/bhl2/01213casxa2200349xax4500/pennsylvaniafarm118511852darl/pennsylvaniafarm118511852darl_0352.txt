bone-dust ■n'ith various results. So far, however, al- 
 ways failing to derive any benefit from guano, and 
 yet so satisfied with the advantages which some of 
 my neighbors have derived from its application, that 
 I have again bought a ton of the " best Peruvian " 
 with which I propose to renovate an old field of six 
 acres, of stale land, which has been thrown out for 
 fifty years. I shall plow it in, in connexion with a 
 like quantity of Plaster of Paris, leaving as I always 
 Jo, a few rows without any manure to test its value. 

If the above should prove acceptable to you and 
 your readers, I may, at a future period, give you the 
 result of an experiment with barnyard manure, pou- 
 drette and guano, upon a field of wheat, grown sub- 
 sequently to the foregoing detailed experiment with 
 corn. Kespectfully,

 Dissolved Bones. 

Mr. Editor ; — Wishing to cultivate a field of five 
 acres, that had been farmed for some ten or twelve 
 years without any application of lime or other reno- 
 vator, until it had become very poor, I determined in 
 the fall of 1850 to put it in Wheat. It had been in 
 corn and yielded a very meagre crop, then in oats, 
 and after the oats in clover, that made a very scanty 
 covering; the stocks keeping a respectable distance 
 from one another, and even the clover was pastured 
 off, so that the promise for a wheat crop was a poor 
 one. After giving it a dressing of lime at the 
 rate of 30 bushels to the acre, on the sod, it was plow- 
 ed in August to the depth of six inches, the soil not 
 permitting deep plowing. Then, when the ground 
 was in its rough state, I applied the following prep- 
 aration, viz : 13 bus. bones, dissolved by 300 lbs. of 
 sulphuric acid — The bones were very coarsely ground, 
 and required more acid and time to dissolve them 
 than if they had been finer. When sufiiciently dis- 
 solved, I had them mixed with a cart load of saw 
 dust, and after leaving it for a few days in a pile to 
 heat, mixed with it 500 lbs. of Guano, sowed it broad 
 east on the field, at the rate of 2} bushels of bones 
 and 100 lbs. of guano to the acre. 

The wheat grew finely in the fall, looked well 
 through the summer, and when harvested, yielded a 
 small fraction over 29 bushels to the acre; fuUy 15 bus. 
 more to the acre than the land would have produred 
 without the bone, sawdust and guano. It was seeded 
 in clover and timothy,which grew so rank in the low 
 and more wet part of the field,as in a measure to in- 
 jure the wheat; making a thick mat aU over the 
 ground, and promising a fineyield the coming season, 
 which will abundantly compensate for all the outlay 
 incurred, without the additional amount of wheat. 

lalsoapplied thedissolved bones, butvrithoutguano, 
 on part of a field of cora. The result was equal to 
 that of the wheat. The part of the field to which it 

had been applied, grew ofi' from the first, stronger and 
 greener; so that many persons that examined the field 
 were able to point out the very row where the bones 
 had been applied. There was evidently from 10 to 
 20 bushels more to the acre on that part of the field. 

As ground bones are difBcult to be obtained in 
 suflicient quantity to be largely appUed in their 
 ground state, I believe it is much more economical 
 and profitable to dissolve them in acid. The after 
 crop of clover which it most benfits, will much more 
 than pay all the expense of the acid. S. D.

[The above communication from one of the best 
 farmers in Chester county, will, we are sure, be read 
 with interest, and should be, with profit, by every 
 subscriber of the Journal, who is desirous of impro- 
 ving the quality of his soil. The use of bones as a 
 fertilizer, although extensively practised in England, 
 and in portions of the United States, is not common 
 in Pennsylvania. It is a well known fact that ship 
 load after ship load of bones has been sent from the 
 port of Philadelphia to England, by English agents 
 located there expressly for that purpose. Many of 
 these bones are collected in the interior of our State, 
 and sent by canal and otherwise to Philadelphia. A 
 gentleman residing near that city informs us, that a 
 few years since, desirous of procuring several tons of 
 bones, he found the bone market so completely mo- 
 nopolized by English agents, that he eventually suc- 
 ceeded in getting the quantity he wished, only because 
 tha vessel designed to carry them to England, was 
 unable to take them. Facts of such a character are 
 worthy the most serious consideration of our farmers. 
 If English farmers can afibrd to keep their agents in 
 the United States to collect, pay the freight across the 
 Atlantic, and yet find bones amongst the best and 
 cheapest of their fertilizers, why should they not be 
 equally valuable to the Pennsylvania farmer, who 
 has them at his very door ? If other of our readers 
 have experimented with bones, we respectfully request 
 that they will enable us to lay before our subscriers 
 the results of their experiments. — [Ed.

 It belongs to the 5th Class and 2d Order in the 
 Artificial System of LinnjEus, and to Order Solanacea 
 in the Natural System. The meaning of Solanum is 
 uncertain. There are about 500 species of the gene- 
 ra described, about ten of which are natives of North 
 America. The Potato and Egg plants are species of 
 this genus. The pilant under consideration is a na- 
 tive of the Southern States. It grows to the height 
 of 1 or 2 feet, has a shrubby appearance, but is an- 
 nual, the stem is hollow, branched, and armed with 
 sharp spreading prickles, the leaves are 4 or 5 inches 
 long, and 3 or 4 inches vride, egg shaped but are va-
