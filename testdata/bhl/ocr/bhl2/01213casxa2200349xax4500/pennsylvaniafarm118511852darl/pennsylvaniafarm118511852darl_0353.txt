riously scalloped, prickly on both sides ; the foot- 
 stalks, both of the leaves and flowers, half an inch 
 to one and a half inches long ; the stem of the flow- 
 ers grows opposite to the leaves, often 5 or 6 inches 
 long. The flowers ore bluish white ; the fruit is or- 
 ange yellow in little balls about one third of an inch 
 in diameter. 

This vile weed, not much remote from the Canada 
 thistle, is found growing in many parts of the State 
 in cultivation under the name of "Adam's Apple." 
 "When it gets fairly introduced it is almost impossible 
 to get rid of it, it is so tenacious of life. In some 
 parts of the Southern States it is very abundant. It 
 grows in patches, and its numerous spines deter stock 
 from feeding among it. It was introduced into Mar- 
 shall's garden in Chester county, and has now be- 
 come a pernicious weed in that vicinity. 

I can discover some beauty in every plant, but this 
 is one that has but few characters to recommend it, 
 and will hardly warrant the risk of seriously injuring 
 the whole agricultural district for all the beauty it 
 affords, and should be promptly eradicated wheiever 
 it is found. J. M. M'Minn.

For the Farm Journail. 
 The influence of the Moon. 

Mr. Editor : — I do not quite like the tone of the 
 article with the above caption, in your January No. 
 It appeared to me both uncandid and ungenerous. 
 I would humbly suggest to your correspondent, that 
 dogmatism is not argument, or ridicule, reason. 

This generation is emphatically " wise in its own 
 conceit." Whatever it does not understand, it re- 
 jects as foolishness. Even Science, in the pride of 
 her newly fledged pinions, soars aloft, and imagines 
 that her vision takes in all, that God has made visi- 
 ble; and because she does not discern objects or 
 colors, of which her teachers have spoken, declares 
 positively that they never existed except in the brains 
 of superannuated dreamers. Young people are always 
 ridiculing " old women's whims," — but what do we 
 learn from the fact, that as fast as they arrive at the 
 age of matured experience, they invariably adopt 
 those same " ridiculous whims?" only, that age has 
 given them wisdom, also. Thus we have a class of 
 philosophers who, in warring against Superstition, 
 sometimes attack the invincible array of Truth. — 
 Thus, because illiterate superstition imputes too much 
 to the lunar influence, they deny that the moon has 
 any influence whatever. 

But we must proceed with your correspondent's 
 declaration as we would with a stocking which we 
 designed to unravel ; we must commence at the toe 

If the Creator of all the " systems of vast and in. 
 finite worlds" — deigns Himself to control the desti- 
 nies of earth, and her feeble children, is it unreason, 
 able to spppose that He has so endowed and arranged 

the "vast and infinite worlds" that they shall mutu- 
 ally influence and benefit each other? If, as Astro- 
 nomy teaches, the moon is a naked ball, without 
 oceans, or rivers, or even a surrounding atmosphere, 
 and therefore, is unfitted for the habitation of animal 
 life, or the growth of any organic production ; for 
 what purpose was she created ? To light the earth ? 
 Certainly not, for Wisdom would in that case have so 
 disposed her, that the illuminated hemisphere should 
 always have been toward the earth. I am rather 
 skeptical, however, as to the uninhabitableness of the 
 m .on. I cannot believe that the God who has so 
 bountifully diffused " the living creature" through 
 our earth would have created so vast a waste. Yet 
 if it be so, then the moon accompanies the earth, for 
 the especial benefit of herself and her children ; and 
 since it is not merely to give light, she must be ap- 
 pointed for other purposes. Your correspondent ad- 
 mits her agency in producing the tides, overlooking 
 however the " spring tides" and " neap tides," eon- 
 sequent upon her "changes." 

It is hardly probable that any ignoramus imagines 
 that the moon "jumps" from one place to another, 
 or that she changes her form or her substance. We 
 have always ignorantly supposed that these changes 
 had reference to the differences of her position with 
 regard to the sun in the quadrature of her orbit. — 
 Certainly the earth receives from her, more reflected 
 sunlight when her whole bright side is toward us, 
 than when she turns from us the half of her efful- 
 gence, giving the remainder obliquely ; or when she 
 turns her back altogether. This difference is demon- 
 strated by the difference in the tides ; I mean that 
 the position of the moon with respect to the earth, and 
 the sun does cause this difference. If, then, the moon 
 does so attract or influence the waters of the ocean, is it 
 irrational to suppose,'that her influence acts upon all 
 aqueous particles, either on the earth or in her sur- 
 rounding atmosphere ? Does not the fact that the 
 moon is specially appointed to wait upon the earth 
 in her revolutions, suggest the beliaf, that she has 
 some special office with reference to our earth ? This 
 office is not merely to give light as we have shown ; 
 and besides, it seems to me evident, that the Creator 
 intended that we should sleep at night, which we can 
 do very well without moonlight. It is, therefore, my 
 humble opinion that the light which the moon re 
 fleets upon us, is an influence intended for more im- 
 portant purposes, than to light beasts to their prey, 
 or robbers and assassins to their desperate work. 

If the water is influenced by the Moon, since our 
 atmosphere is essentially an aqueous body, it must 
 be subject to this influence. No person will deny 
 that all vegetation is sustained by the water and 
 gases of the atmosphere. Every observant gardener 
 knoios, that some vegetables do grow taster when the 
 Moon is near the full, than when she gives little or no 
 reflected light, because the atmosphere, when satura-
