stable manure. As regards the gases generated by 
 and evolved from them, they may be divided into 
 two principal classes — the one producing more car- 
 bonic acid than ammonia; and the other, at least in 
 its earlier stages, producing more ammonia than car- 
 bonic acid. To the first class belong the manures 
 produced by horned cattle ; to the second, that pro- 
 duced by horses. The custom of applying the two 
 kinds of manure in combination, or of using that of 
 cattle in preference on light and warm soils, and of 
 appropriating that of horses to colder or clayey lauds, 
 is based on the fact that the latter evolves ammonia 
 in large quantity, which in the absence of absorbents, 
 in which light soils are deficient, acts injuriously on 
 vegetation ; whereas such injury is not caused by it 
 when used on clayey land. For the same reason, 
 experienced practical farmers in general avoid apply- 
 ing fresh manure to light soils, because, in such ma- 
 nures the formation and evolution of ammonia pro- 
 ceeds with great and not unfrequently destructive 
 rapidity, owing to the absence of suitable absorbent 
 substances. In other respects also, fresh or recent 
 manure produces comparatively less effect than fol- 
 lows the application of an equal quantity of well de- 
 composed dung, for the vegetable remains which it 
 contains, and from which humus is to be formed, are 
 yet only partially in a decomposed state and not re- 
 duced into a homogeneous mass, and its incombusti- 
 ble elements are likewise too greatly diffused, so that 
 proportionally a smaller amount is supplied to the 
 soil. But where it is designed to effect a mere me- 
 chanical loosening of the soil, it is useful to apply 
 fresh manure, which should for this purpose be plow- 
 ed in as thickly as possible. When the increased 
 formation of carbonic acid is promoted by the use 
 of fresh manure, the solution of the silicates in the 
 soil is at the same timehastened, andthe incombustible 
 elements, in which such manure is deficient, will thus 
 be supplied, if the manure be applied in large quan- 
 tity. On the whole, fresh manure acts with greater 
 efficacy in wet seasons or wet soils than such as is 
 well rotted; because decomposition does not then 
 proceed with such rapidity as to cause an injurious 
 evolution of ammonia, and the straw and coarser sub- 
 stances mixed with it, which longer resist decompo- 
 sition, prevent the soil from becoming compacted by 
 heavy rains. 

The principal action of stable manure, as a fertil- 
 izer, is based on the following facts. Domestic ani- 
 mals are fed with grain and grasses or hay. By 
 means of this food they receive all the various ele- 
 mentary substances which the plants have withdrawn 
 from the soil during their growth. The animals 
 themselves require for their sustenance a proportion- 
 ally small part only of these substances, the remain- 
 der passing off mainly in the form of excrement. — 
 The manure they produce must therefore contain and 
 return to the soil, in the proper proportions, the ele- 

mentary substances required by plants or cultivated 
 crops, and contain them in such state of solution, 
 sub-division and combination, as is best adapted to 
 promote vegetable growth. 

As regards the quantity of barnyard manure to he 
 applied, as much as possible should be allotted to the 
 land to be cultivated, yet not so much as to cause the 
 cereals to Jodijc and thus prevent the formation of 
 perfect grain. Still it is always better to manure too 
 bountifully than too sparingly, because the effect of 
 excessive manuring may be remedied by thin seed- 
 ing, drill culture, and by frequently stirring the soil 
 while the plants are growing, if the crop cultivated 
 admit of it. Jloreover, plentiful manuring is allow- 
 able and justifiable where neither straw, hay, nor 
 grain is sold from the premises; because the quanti- 
 ty of manure produced on such a farm is constantly 
 increasing, since plants, by means of the elementary 
 matters which they derive from the soil and the air, 
 and by the continual decomposition of the mineral 
 substances of the soil, are enabled to, and actually 
 do, supply more than they receive from the manure, 
 even after allowing for what is carried away in the 
 form of beef, pork, butter, milk, &c. And it is this 
 excess which goes to enrich and increase the fertility 
 or productiveness of the soil. 

For litter, straw is undoubtedly the best material 
 that can be used, because other substar:ces change 
 and deteriorate the nature and composition of the 
 manure produced, as well by the different proportions 
 and mixture of their ingredients, as also by their in- 
 ferior efficacy in promoting the loosening of the soil 
 and the decomposition of its mineral ingredients. — 
 Other materials can be used advantageously for litter 
 only, when they can be properly mixed with straw. 

As to the treatment and preservation of manure, it 
 should be constantly borne in mind that it consist^ 
 of substances, some of which are volatile and others 
 incombustible. The former naturally escape almost 
 as rapidly as they are evolved, and escape the more 
 easUy, the more the mass becomes heated in the pro- 
 cess of fermentation. But the escape of these vola- 
 tile substances is very injurious, and the farmer's ef- 
 forts should be assiduously directed to prevent such 
 escape and injury, as much as possible. As moisture 
 absorbs both carbonic acid and ammonia, these two 
 substances may be retained by keeping the ma^iure 
 heap constantly in a moist state, so as to moderate 
 the heat of fermentation and fix at least in part, the 
 volatile matters evolved. Or the manure heap may 
 occasionally be strewed over with fresh dug earth 
 which will absorb the ammonia, whilst the carbonic 
 acid will render soluble again the silicates present. — 
 If, in addition to strewing earth over the manure 
 heap, it be occasionally sprinkled over with dilute 
 sulphuric acid, the volatile ammonia evolved will be 
 retained and converted into sulphate of ammonia — a 
 salt which is not volatile, but which is readily solu-
