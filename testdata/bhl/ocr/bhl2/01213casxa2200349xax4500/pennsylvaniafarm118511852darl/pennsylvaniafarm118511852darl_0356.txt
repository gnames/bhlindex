ble in water and is a powerful fertilizer. If gypsum 
 1)6 strewed over the manure it will underj^o decompo- 
 sition. Its sulphuric acid will unite with the ammo- 
 nia and form sulphate of ammonia, and the lime will 
 talce up the carbonic acid ; thus the escape of their 
 volatile substances will be prevented. 

As regards the depth to which manure should be 
 introduced in the soil, much depends on the object 
 which it is intended to accomplish. In this view we 
 must distinguish between manures whicli are design- 
 ed to operate rather by the volatile and soluble sub- 
 stances they contain, and such as consist chiefly of 
 incombustible though soluble substances. If the 
 former — usually recent animal manures — are to be 
 appliel, they should be covered deep, because the 
 gases which will be evolved therefrom, naturally as- 
 cend and m\ist find above the manure, the soil on 
 which they are to act, and in sufiioient quantity or 
 depth to be perfectly absorbed. The more rotted or 
 decomposed manure is when applied, the less atten- 
 tion do its volatile matters deserve, but the more 
 careful should we be to preserve the valuable and 
 liighly soluble salts it contains. These substances 
 are washed or leached down into the subsoil by rainS' 
 and are thus placed beyond the reach of many plants. 
 The greater the amount, therefore, of soluble salts, 
 which such manures contain, the more shallow should 
 they bo plowed in. 

The crojis also, for which we manure, must be taken 
 iato consideration. For tap-rooted plants the manure 
 should be placed deeper in the soil than for those 
 whose roots do not penetrate deep. As manure which 
 is plowed in shallow acts more quickly than that 
 which is covered deep, because the atmospheric air 
 has more ready access to it, the farmer has it in his 
 power in a great degree, to regulate the consumption 
 of the manure in accordance with the wants of the 
 plants he cultivates. It is also to be observed Uiat 
 land which has been manured, may, in the ensuing 
 years be plowed deeper than before, because much 
 of the more thoroughly decomposed portions of the 
 manure sink deep in the soil. In the last place, we 
 may remark also that a principal effect of barnyard 
 manure, is, that by its decomposition it serves to 
 condense and store up in the atmospheric air imme- 
 diately surrounding or in contact with it, large quan- 
 tities.'of carbonic acid and nitrogen; thus providing 
 the crop with an abundant supply of those substances, 
 which plants by means of their leaves, are destined 
 to absorb as nutriment. 

For the Farm Journal. 
 Mules for general farming purposes. 

Mr. Editor: — There is one subject which should 
 claim the special attention of our farmers in Penn- 
 sylvania ; but which, for some unaccountable rea- 
 son, has been strangely neglected. I refer to the in- 
 troduction into more general use, of that valuable 
 animal, the mule, for farm purposes. 

For some years I have been a practical farmer, and 
 like most farmers in their noviciate, I purchased such 
 horses as to me, appeared best adapted to my pur- 
 poses. Little attention was paid to the quantity of 
 grain necessary to keep them in decent condition 
 from year to year. After using horses four or five 
 years, I came to the conclusion that my farm work 
 could be done as well and as quickly, and that nearly 
 one-half of my horse feed might be saved; and I hoped 
 to accomplish all this by substituting mules for my 
 horses. 

For a year or two previous to the introduction of 
 the mules on my farm, I urged upon my neighbors 
 the expediency of using them. I did this on the 
 ground of their superior activity, strength, hardiness, 
 cheapness of keeping, longe\-ity, &e. But my neigh- 
 bors, like the generality of farmers, had adopted the 
 prevailing opinion that they were hard to manage, 
 vicious and unruly. This slander upon the mule 
 seems to have had its origin in the fact that iron 
 masters, canal boatmenand others, who employ mules 
 largely, entrust them to merciless hirelings, who in- 
 humanly abuse the poor animals, by beating, whip- 
 ping, &c., until fright, &c., producing something like 
 a feeling of self-defence, drives them to desperation, 
 and viciousness ensues. If gentle means were used, 
 and tie mule treated as every useful creature should 
 be, with a properdegree of humanity, they w„uld be- 
 come as quiet and tractable as the horse. 

To those who would desire to purchase mules, I 
 say, select and purchase them before they arc broken 
 to harness, at the age of three years. Place them, 
 one at a time, in harness beside a gentle horse, and 
 work for a day or two. Let the most soothing means 
 be used. If the mule becomes refractory, instead of 
 beating him into submission, try the power of kind- 
 ness, and my word for it, in a very short time he 
 will work well wherever you choose to place him. 

For the purpose of illustration I will give you my 
 own experience in the matter. I have now in niy 
 possession, a pair of dun mules, three years old, that 
 ten mouths ago never had bridle or harness on. — 
 These mules are as perfectly broke to single or dou- 
 ble harness, as any of the horses that I have worked 
 for years. This was accomplished by gentle treat- 
 ment, and I am satisfied that the same course, if gen- 
 erally pursued, would soon redeem the character of 
 the mule from the unjust censure so freely heaped 
 upon him by those who have always treated him 
 harshly. 

The mules above referred to, were awarded a spe- 
 cial premium at the late State Fair. They are not 
 only gentle and kind, but I can do more plowing with 
 them in the same space of time, than with any two 
 horses I ever had ; with this advantage in favor of 
 the mules, that they keep sleek and fat on one-half 
 the feed required for the horses. 

Another argument in favor of mules is, the com-
