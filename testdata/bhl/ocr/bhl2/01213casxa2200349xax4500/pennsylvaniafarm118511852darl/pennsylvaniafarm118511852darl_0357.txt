parative ease with which they can be reared. With 
 such a, soil and climate as Pennsylvania, the cost of 
 raising a mule need not exceed that of a three year 
 old steer. The mule at that age, even though an 
 ordinary one, will command one hundred dollars, and 
 if a first rate one, from one hundred and twenty to 
 fifty dollars ; while nine-tenths of our horses at three 
 years old, are not worth more than eighty dollars, 
 although the cost of feeding and attention is nearly 
 twice as great. Samuel Mumma.

 targe Seed Potatoes vs. Small. 

Mr. Editor: — The question of large versus small 
 potatoes for seed, seems at present to engage a large 
 share of attention in several of our agricultural jour- 
 nals. Perhaps a statement of an experiment on a 
 larger scale than usual will be of interest at this time. 
 In the fall of 1848 I measured oS two acres of ground 
 and had it deeply plowed. The soil is a warm sandy 
 loam, with a deep sandy subsoil, and was at the time 
 of plowing, down to timothy meadow, three years 
 from the sowing. It was plowed in the fall for the 
 purpose of exterminating the cut worm,which abound- 
 ed. The following April we hauled upon it one hun- 
 dred two horse wagon loads of well rotted barnyard 
 manure, spread it evenly and plowed nine inches 
 deep, harrowed well, marked out drills four inches 
 deep and three feet apart, and planted with fine large 
 Neshannock potatoes, chosen and preserved carefully 
 for the purpose. The potatoes were cut and planted 
 at the rate of twenty bushels to the acre. The large 
 seed was insufficient to complete the planting and we 
 were forced to have recourse to the culls, about the 
 size of walnuts. The whole patch was planted in one 
 day. The plants came up well, and were well work- 
 ed with the cultivator. No apparent difference be- 
 tween the large and small seed. They were dug about 
 the middle of September, commencing at the rows 
 planted with the small seed, (about a quarter of an 
 acre). We were surprised to find the potatoes so large 
 and the yield so good, it having been a favorite theo- 
 ry of mine that the largest potatoes alone should be 
 planted, to make a good return. We measured care- 
 fully several rows, and made large calculations on 
 the probable yield of the large seed. Judge then of 
 our surprise, when measuring several rows of the 
 latter, to find that they fell a little short of the former, 
 both in quantity and quality. 

Another acre and a half which we planted a few 
 days later than the first patch, on deep alluvial soil, 
 in a very careless manner and entirely with the 
 smallest potatoes, produced as fine a lot of large po- 
 tatoes as I have ever seen. The yield of the two 
 acres was 400 bushels, and of the one and a half acres 
 200. 

In 1850 I lost aU of my seed potatoes by storing 
 too large a quantity together ; and seed being very 

scarce in this neighborhood, I was forced to plant 
 such as could be purchased, red potatoes, large and 
 small mixed. I planted on newly cleared land at the 
 rate of nine bushels to the acre, and had a much bet- 
 ter crop than could have been expected from the 
 quantity of seed, viz: 800 bushels from three acres. 
 Vfe sorted out all the small ones, about the size of 
 walnuts and hen eggs, for seed, and in April, 1851, 
 planted 7| acres of rich new land in rows three feet 
 apart, and at the rate of nineteen bushels to the acre, 
 potatoes whole, or when an unusually large one oc- 
 curred, cut in two. When dug, they were assorted 
 on the ground, the large ones sent to market and the 
 small ones stored for seed. I measured carefully the 
 product of one acre, and found 320 bushels, of which 
 one fourth were culls and the other three fourths the 
 best quality of merchantable potatoes ; and as such 
 they commanded a high price in market. I will also 
 mention, that my potatoes have never been infected 
 with the rot, except in one or two spots where the 
 water of a spring occasionally flowed over the cround 
 after heavy rains, although my neighbors for several 
 years past, until the present season, have lost nearly 
 their entire crops. I do not pretend to assign any 
 reason for my exemption from the scourge, except 
 perhaps, early planting. Yours respectfully,

Webb's Patent Straw Cutter. 

Our attention has been called to this Straw Cutter 
 by S. Hayden, of Bradford county, who is now intro- 
 ducing it into this State. He has sold most of the 
 South Eastern counties to Paschall Morris, of West 
 Chester, Chester county, of whom Machines may be 
 obtained. 

The improvement consists in adapting two straight 
 knives to a horizontal shaft, so as to strike obliquely 
 against a circular plate of iron, giving the knife the 
 position to cut with greatest ease, with the least force, 
 and with the most expedition of any jMachine we 
 have seen. 

The knives are attached to the shaft by movable 
 arms, capable of being set at any angle you choose, 
 may be sharpened without removal, and used for a 
 great number of years without renewal. In short, 
 the Machine is simple in its construction, and efficient 
 in its execution. It was invented by .Joseph W. Webb, 
 of Cayuga county. New York, and patented by him 
 October 8th, 1850. 

Mr. Editor : — I notice in one of our Journals an 
 enquiry. What will prevent Bugs from eating cucum- 
 bers, etc.? I will tell you what I do with very good 
 success — I put a box around the hill just large enough 
 to enclose the plants about eight inches deep — place 
 it before the plants emerge from the ground. This 
 process has been very successful with me and such of 
 my neighbors as have tried it. Yours, &c.,
