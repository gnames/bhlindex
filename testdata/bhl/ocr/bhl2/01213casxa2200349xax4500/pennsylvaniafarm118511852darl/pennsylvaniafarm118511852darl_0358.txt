THE TURKEY. 

This is one of those Fowls, that, as yet, are found 
 in the wild, as well as in the domestic state. How 
 long this may he, is hard to say ; prohably, not long; 
 for as civilization and improvements advance in 
 North America, the country to which they belong, 
 tliey will doubtless share the fate of the Dodo and 
 Bustard, and be known only in history, or by the 
 specimens to be seen in the barn-yard. 

Among the living tributaries to the luxury of Man, 
 the Turkey is an example of the results yet to be ex- 
 pected from the exploring spirit of our day. It is 
 the most recent, and, except the Hon and the Goose, 
 the most valuable of our domesticated birds. We 
 may, indeed, call it quite a new introduction : for 
 what, after all, is a period of three hundred years 

compared with the time during which Man has had 
 dominion over the earth and its brute inhabitants ? 
 The obscurity which hangs- over the transmission of 
 the Turkey from America, and -which there is little 
 chance of clearing away, except by industrious fer- 
 reting amongst old family records and memorandum 
 books, shows that those who brought it to tlie Old 
 World had no idea of the value of what they were 
 importing ; but prohably regarded it like any other 
 remarkable production of nature — a Macaw or a Tor- 
 toise. The young would be distributed amongfriends 
 with the same feeling that Golden Pheasants and 
 such like are with us ; these again would thrive and 
 increase, and the nation would suddenly find itself 
 in the possession of a race, not of pleasing pets; but 
 of a valuable prolific, and hardy stock of Poultry.

 incubation, so that the Eggs may be brought home

from_ day to day, there being no need of a nest Egg, 
 as with the common Fowl. She will lay from fifteen 
 to twenty Eggs, more or less. If thereare any dead 
 leaves or dry grass at hand, she will cover her nest 
 with these ; but if not, she will take no trouble to 
 collect tliem from a distance. Her determination to 
 sit, will be known by her constantly remaining on the 
 nest, though empty ; and as it is seldom in a position 
 sufficiently secure against the weather or pilferers, a 
 nest should be prepared for her, by placing some 
 straw, with her Eggs, on the floor of a convenient out- 
 house. She should then be brought home, and gentr 
 ly and kindly placed upon it. It is a most pleasing 
 sight to witness the satisfaction with which the bird 
 takes to her long-nest Eggs, turning them about, pla- 
 cing them with her bill in the most suitable positions, 
 packing the straw tightly around and under them, 
 and finally sinking upon them with the quiet joy of 
 anticipated maternity. 

Some ladies deem it necessary to turn the Eggs 

once a day, but the Hen does that herself many time? 
 a day. If the Eggs are marked, and you notice their 
 position when she leaves the nest, you will never find 
 them arranged in the same order. A person who ob- 
 tained ninety-nine Chicks from an hundred Eggs, 
 took the great trouble to turn each Egg every day 
 with her own hand, during the whole time of incuba- 
 tion. The result appears favorable ; but, in fact, on- 
 ly amounts to this, that sueh officiousness did no harm 
 with a good, patient, quiet creature like the sitting 
 Turkey, but it would probalily have worried and an- 
 noyed any other bird into addling her whole clutch. 
 We will at once reject, as utterly absurd and unnat- 
 ural, all directions to immerse or "try" the Eggs in 
 a pail of water, hot or cold. 

Give them nothing ; do nothing to them ; let' them 
 be in the nest under the shelter of their mother's 
 wings, at least eight or ten hours ; if hatched in the 
 afternoon, till the following morning. Then place 
 her on the grass, in the sun, under a roomy coop. —
